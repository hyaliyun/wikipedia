Especially in his later years his main research interest was in social insects and the transitional phases in sociality, particularly in the Hymenoptera and Isoptera.Skaife, S. H., \\"Dwellers in Darkness\\", Pub. Longmans Green & Co., London, 1956.Skaife, S. H., \\"The Study of Ants\\", Pub. Longmans, 1961 He was also a school inspector, prolific author of scientific and popular books, broadcaster, and conservationist. Of his many achievements his greatest was probably his leading role in the creation of the Cape of Good Hope Nature Reserve between Cape Town and Cape Point. He lived for most of his life in Hout Bay on the Cape Peninsula. Early life Skaife was born in London, England, to Katherine and John Skaife. He spent his boyhood in Bath, Somerset and went to St Marks Grammar School. Educated at Reading University, England, he initially studied in the Arts, even though his passion lay with Biology. In 1911 he took the Intermediate BA examination of London University because Reading at that stage was not a university and could not confer a degree. He then studied for a Teacher's Diploma and passed it with distinction. In 1912 he went to the University of Leipzig in Germany, at the urging of his uncle. He stayed with the Schober family. During this period he taught English to earn some extra money. In 1913 he went to Cape Town to teach biology at the Rondebosch Boys High School. When World War I broke out in 1914, he tried to enlist for service, but was turned down on medical grounds due to an irregular heart beat, which was later found to be harmless. He was then offered and accepted a post as entomologist at the Rosebank Research Station in Cape Town. Here he worked on insects that fed on stored grain. This was a particularly urgent issue at the time, since large quantities of grain were being stored at the Cape as part of the war effort. Later career On 29 September 1917 he married Elsie Mary Croft, a pianist. After his marriage he was transferred to the Cedara College of Agriculture in Natal where he worked on bees and wattle bagworm infestation. In 1918 he became the first South African to receive a Carnegie Grant for further study. In 1920 he received an MSc at the Natal University College. From 1921 to 1945 he was the Inspector of Science in the Cape Department of Education. In 1922 he received a PhD from the University of Cape Town for his research on bean weevils or the subfamily Bruchinae. Africa has a rich Bruchid fauna, many of them dependent on thorn trees and other indigenous leguminous plants. In the relaxed railway schedules of the time, he sometimes found opportunities to collect new species from thorn trees during halts. During this period he found time to edit Nature Notes (1924‚Äì1931) and become one of the first people to make a radio broadcast in South Africa, in which he talked on scorpions (1925). In 1929 he established the Wild Life Protection and Conservation Society (now called the Wildlife and Environment Society of South Africa, WESSA), largely as a result of his concern at the widespread destruction of game in Zululand as part of the tsetse fly control campaign. In his capacity as chairman, he helped to establish the Outeniqua Mountain Zebra Reserve, the Bontebok Park, and the Addo Elephant Reserve. During the period 1935‚Äì1945 he was Director of the School Broadcasting Service. In 1939, largely through his efforts, the Cape of Good Hope Nature Reserve was established. He became President of the Entomological Society of Southern Africa in 1940, served as Chairman of the newly created Fisheries Development Corporation from 1945‚Äì1951, and during this same period was a member of the Board of Governors of the South African Broadcasting Corporation. In 1950 he was elected President of the Royal Society of South Africa and from 1950‚Äì1957 he acted as Vice-chairman of the board of Trustees of the South African Museum. In 1951 he became Chairman of the Fisheries Commission of Northern Rhodesia. In 1952 he retired to his home in Hout Bay and did extensive research on the social behaviour of ants, bees and wasps which resulted in the publication of some books. In his book on termites, and other papers,Skaife S. H., The Black-Mound Termite of the Cape, Amitermes Atlanticus Fuller., Transactions of the Royal Society of South Africa, Volume 34, Issue 1 1954 , pages 251 ‚Äì 271 he published ground-breaking work on the dynamics and ecology of termite mounds and the means of studying them. He also wrote a book on ants, and a number of scientific publications on various topics, including possible routes to sociality from primitive bees such as South African carpenter bees.Skaife, S. H. ‚ÄúThe yellow-banded carpenter bee, Mesotrichia caffra Linn, and its symbiotic mite, Dinogamasus Braunsi Vitzthun,‚Äù Journal of the Entomological Society of South Africa, vol. 15, pp. 63‚Äì76, 1952. In 1952 he was awarded the South African Medal and Grant for scientific research by the South African Association for the Advancement of Science. In 1953 he visited the UK where he spoke about his research work over the BBC and attended the Annual Congress of the British Association in Belfast, Northern Ireland. In 1957 he was awarded a D.Sc. (honoris causa) by the University of Natal, and despite having retired became the President of the Zoological Society of South Africa in 1960. He also found time to lecture in Medical Entomology at the University of Cape Town and serve as President of the then South African Association for the Advancement of Science. He was an entertaining and unpretentious speaker with a pleasant sense of humour and a fine command of his field, and many South African youngsters of that generation had reason to appreciate his kindly and generous response to intelligent questions. On 6 November 1976 he died at Hout Bay in the Cape Peninsula.

It was combined with iodine-131 to produce a radiopharmaceutical for unsealed source radiotherapy, Iodine-131 Tositumomab (branded as Bexxar), for the treatment of non-Hodgkins lymphoma. It is classified as a IgG2a lambda antibody. The drug combination was developed by Corixa which was purchased by GlaxoSmithKline in 2005. It was sold for about $25,000 for one round of treatment. Bexxar competed with Zevalin, until the former's discontinuation in 2014.

July 1, 2003 Company News: Corixa and Glaxo's Cancer Drug Wins FDA Approval The radioactive dose was adjusted for each patient in order to maximize the radiation delivered to the tumor and minimize the exposure of other organs. Bexxar combined separate administration of unlabelled and iodine-labelled (i.e. covalently bonded to 131I) tositumomab. A first dose of labelled antibody was given once, and whole-body radiation was measured with a gamma camera over seven days. Analysis of that imaging data allowed an optimal dose of labelled antibody to be calculated, which was then administered once a day, for up to seven days. Each time the labelled antibody was administered, it was always preceded by unlabelled (non-radioactive) antibody. Early clinical trials had shown that total body residence times of radioactivity were longer in people who first received unlabelled antibody, so that a lower dose of labelled antibody was needed to deliver the required total dose of radiation; additionally labelled antibody targeted tumors better in people pre-treated with unlabelled antibody. Availability =United States= Following a first investigational new drug application in 1989 and biologics license application in 2000, Bexxar was approved by the FDA in 2003. Sale of Bexxar was discontinued and marketing approval was withdrawn in February 2014 due to a decline in usage (fewer than 75 patients in 2012). One possible explanation for the lack of demand, despite a claimed 70% response rate, was that oncologists could not sell it directly to patients but had to refer patients to third party specialist centers, however a \\"muddled clinical trials strategy\\", supply chain issues, reimbursement problems, and emergence of non- radioactive competitors has also been blamed.

It is used in the prevention of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections. It is recommended for infants that are high-risk because of prematurity or other medical problems such as congenital heart disease. The most common side effects include fever and rash. Text was copied from this source which is ¬© European Medicines Agency. Reproduction is authorized provided the source is acknowledged. Palivizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody (IgG) directed against an epitope in the A antigenic site of the F protein of RSV. In two phase III clinical trials in the pediatric population, palivizumab reduced the risk of hospitalization due to RSV infection by 55% and 45%. Palivizumab is dosed once a month via intramuscular (IM) injection, to be administered throughout the duration of the RSV season. Palivizumab targets the fusion protein of RSV, inhibiting its entry into the cell and thereby preventing infection. Palivizumab was approved for medical use in 1998.  Medical use Palivizumab is indicated for the prevention of serious lower respiratory tract disease requiring hospitalization caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in children at high risk for RSV disease: * children born at 35 weeks of gestation or less and less than six months of age at the onset of the RSV season; * children less than two years of age and requiring treatment for bronchopulmonary dysplasia within the last six months; * children less than two years of age and with haemodynamically significant congenital heart disease. The American Academy of Pediatrics has published guidelines for the use of palivizumab. The most recent updates to these recommendations are based on new information regarding RSV seasonality, palivizumab pharmacokinetics, the incidence of bronchiolitis hospitalizations, the effect of gestational age and other risk factors on RSV hospitalization rates, the mortality of children hospitalized with RSV infection, the effect of prophylaxis on wheezing, and palivizumab- resistant RSV isolates. All infants younger than one year who were born at <29 weeks (i.e. ‚â§28 weeks, 6 days) of gestation are recommended to use palivizumab. Infants younger than one year with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (i.e. who were born at <32 weeks gestation and required supplemental oxygen for the first 28 days after birth) and infants younger than two years with bronchopulmonary dysplasia who require medical therapy (e.g. supplemental oxygen, glucocorticoids, diuretics) within six months of the anticipated RSV season are recommended to use palivizumab as prophylaxis. Other potential target groups for palivizumab prophylaxis include: * Infants younger than one year of age with hemodynamically significant congenital heart disease. * Infants younger than one year of age with neuromuscular disorders impairing the ability to clear secretions from the upper airways or pulmonary abnormalities. * Children younger than two years of age who are immunocompromised (e.g. those with severe combined immunodeficiency; those younger than two years of age who have undergone lung transplantation or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation) during the RSV season. * Children with Down syndrome who have additional risk factors for lower respiratory tract infections. * Alaska native and American Indian infants. Decisions regarding palivizumab prophylaxis for children in these groups should be made on a case-by-case basis.  Side effects  Palivizumab use may cause side effects, which include, but are not limited to: * Sore throat * Runny nose * Redness or irritation at injection site * Vomiting * Diarrhea Some more serious side effects include: * Severe skin rash * Itching * Hives (urticaria) * Difficulty breathing  References   External links  * Category:Monoclonal antibodies Category:AbbVie brands Category:AstraZeneca brands Category:Biotechnology ","title":"Palivizumab"},{"id":"6609334","text":"A comic book archive or comic book reader file (also called sequential image file) is a type of archive file for the purpose of sequential viewing of images, commonly for comic books.

Scargill House lies ¬æ mile (1.2 km) from the village of Kettlewell and four miles (6.4 km) from Grassington. The nearest market town, Skipton, is 14 miles (22.4 km) away. The house dates from the eighteenth century and is constructed of stone, rendered and colour-washed, under a stone flag roof. The Grade II*-listed chapel was built in 1960. History Scargill House, The recent history of Scargill House can be summarised as follows: Clement Holdsworth bought Scargill House from John Overend Wood in 1900 as a residence from which he shot grouse on Conistone moor and fished for trout on the River Wharfe. It remained in the Holdsworth family for almost 57 years until William Holdsworth sold the house and estate at auction to the Church of England in November 1957. The estate was described in the auction catalogue as an exceptional residential, agricultural and sporting property extending to , which included: *two stock farms each of about 500 acres (2 km¬≤) *about 70 acres (30 hectares) park and afforestation land *properties in nearby Kettlewell *over a mile of trout fishing in the River Wharfe *shooting rights over 3000 acres (12 km¬≤) of Conistone Moor *the right to Pew Sittings in the Parish Church of Kettlewell and share in the Lordship They claimed that the invigorating air and the completely unspoilt grandeur of the surroundings make the Property a most attractive and healthy resort; and that the grounds of the house included a tree-lined drive, stone-pillared and wrought iron entrance, lawns and an ornamental water garden. Christian community and conference centre The chapel at Scargill House Christian conference centre, dating from 1960 and designed by George Pace The walled garden at Scargill House Scargill was sold to the Church of England for the establishment of a Christian Community in 1957 after William Holdsworth had decided to live on his Irish estate at Bellinter House. In 1959 Scargill became a centre for conferences and events specialising in multi-faith, youth and environmental issues. Since then, it has been largely reconstructed and extended to cater for the many groups that use its facilities. In 1960, a chapel was built by George Pace of York in a Scandinavian style reflecting the location's history, and is now listed. The woodland at Scargill is accredited by the FSC as a highly important conservation site. Scargill Movement In 2008, it was announced that the centre would be closing on 20 July 2008 due to financial difficulties, and profits from the sale of the estate would be used to set up a foundation. It was put on the market for ¬£2.5 million. It was sold in March 2009 to a newly formed registered charity called the Scargill Movement, who are committed to continuing and developing Scargill House in continuation of its original vision, ministry and mission as a ‚ÄúLee Abbey of the North‚Äù.

The P2 Mk2 has a square case with a central circular ribbed pressure plate, the P3 is circular with a central circular pressure plate. Both mines use anti-personnel mines as the fuse, typically the either the P4 Mk1 or P2 Mk2 anti-personnel mines. The anti-personnel mine sits in a cavity below the pressure plate, when enough pressure is place on the pressure plate of the mine, it collapses onto the anti-personnel mine triggering it and the main charge which sits below it.

It was filmed on location in Edina and Minneapolis, Minnesota. Synopsis Narrated by their friend David (Swartz), World and Time Enough is the story of Mark (Guidry) and Joey (Giles). Mark is an HIV- positive art student who creates temporary \\"sculptures\\" on topics including AIDS, abortion and the Bush economy. Joey works as a garbage collector, picking up trash along the roadways. He sometimes brings home interesting items that he finds on the job. Mark's mother was killed when he was a child, in a freak accident in a church when she was crushed by a large falling cross. Since that day, his father has been obsessed with building model cathedrals. Mark and his father are somewhat distant and out of touch and Mark reaches out to him through a series of phone calls, leaving messages on his father's answering machine. Unknown to Mark, his father has died alone in his home but hasn't yet been discovered. Joey's relationship with his adoptive parents is also strained because of his father's issues with Joey's homosexuality. Although he remains close with his sister, Joey feels the need to seek out his birth parents through the adoption social service agency. Mark discovers his father's body and in his grief he assumes his father's obsession with cathedral building. Rather than a model, however, Mark begins work on a full- size cathedral in a local open field. Joey learns the identity of his birth parents, but also learns that they have died. He visits their gravesite and says the things there that he would have told them while they were alive. Mark experiences a vision of his father, who tells him that he's making a mistake, to go home. Mark feverishly climbs the scaffolding and falls off it to the ground. Joey discovers him there. Later, together, out of the scaffolds, surviving bits of Mark's sculptures and the things Joey's gathered, they build their own \\"cathedral.\\" Awards and nominations San Francisco International Lesbian & Gay Film Festival Audience Award - Best Feature External links * World and Time Enough at Internet Movie Database Category:1994 films Category:1994 LGBT-related films Category:American independent films Category:English-language films Category:HIV/AIDS in film Category:American LGBT-related films Category:American films Category:Films shot in Minnesota Category:1994 independent films ","title":"World and Time Enough"},{"id":"6609517","text":"Jean-Christophe Bouvet (born 24 March 1947) is a French actor, film director and writer.

Alternative names for the breed include: Leicester, Bakewell Leicester, Dishley Leicester, English Leicester, Improved Leicester and New Leicester. It was originally developed by 18th-century breeding innovator Robert Bakewell. It is now one of Britain's rarest breeds, categorised as \\"endangered\\" by the Rare Breeds Survival Trust, since fewer than 500 registered breeding females remain in the United Kingdom. History Leicester ram at the 1843 Royal Agricultural Show in Derby Leicester Longwool sheep date back to the 1700s, and were found in the Midland counties of England, originally developed in Dishley Grange, Leicestershire by Robert Bakewell. Bakewell was the foremost exponent of modern animal-breeding techniques in the selection of livestock. The Leicester Longwool in the 1700s was slow-growing and coarsely boned. They now have been developed to gain weight quickly and are fast-growing. Leicester Longwool was one of the first pure sheep breeds introduced to Australia, having been introduced in 1826. The Leicester Longwool has been used to improve many sheep breeds because of its meaty carcase (carcass) and heavy fleece. It is one of the few truly pure breeds. Characteristics Traditional white Leicester lambs The head of an Leicester Longwool should be carried well, not too high and should have no signs of horns on the poll (forehead). The face is generally in a wedge shape, covered in white hairs and can appear to have a blue tinge. The lips and nostrils should be black. Having black specks on the face and ears is not objectionable. The neck should be of medium length. The shoulders should be strong and level with the back, which should be flat. The legs should be straight and wide apart and the hooves should be black. The fleece should be dense (having thick and blocky clumps of wool also known as the staple). It should be lustrous, indicating the shine on the wool, and should have a well- defined crimp or wave from skin to tip. The common fibre diameter for an Leicester Longwool is 32 to 38 micrometres (microns). The Leicester Longwool should be free, active and well balanced while in movement. It should appear to be alert and robust, showing style and character. Other information Leicester Longwool sheep are currently found in Australia, New Zealand, Great Britain, Sweden and the United States. They are sound-footed, which means they are acceptable on flat, hilly or more especially marginal country. They are large-framed with wide, even toplines (backs), strong constitutions and good temperaments.

The name derives from a man named Wilamet, a Native American from an eastern tribe who in 1681 was appointed to serve as a liaison between New France and the natives of the Lake Michigan region. Wilamet was adopted by the Potawatomis, and his name, which meant \\"Catfish\\" in his native Eastern Algonquian language, was soon transformed into \\"Winamac\\", which means the same thing in the Potawatomi language. The Potawatomi version of the name has been spelled in a variety of ways, including Winnemac, Winamek, and Winnemeg. The Winamac name became associated with prominent members of the Fish clan of the Potawatomi tribe. In 1701, Winamac or Wilamet was a chief of the Potawatomi villages along the St. Joseph River in what is now the U.S. state of Michigan. This man or another of the same name was an ally of New France who helped negotiate an end to the Fox Wars in the 1730s. Two other Winamacs were prominent during the War of 1812. One was active opponent of the United States, while the other was a U.S. ally. These two Winamacs have often been confused with each other.

Wilamet was adopted by the Potawatomis,Susan Sleeper-Smith, Indian Women and French Men: Rethinking Cultural Encounter in the Western Great Lakes (Amherst: University of Massachusetts Press, 2001), 175n35. and his name, which meant \\"Catfish\\" in his native Eastern Algonquian language, was eventually transformed into \\"Winamac\\", which means the same thing in the Potawatomi language. Before long, he was recognized by the French as the \\"chief\\" of the Potawatomi villages along the St. Joseph River in what is now the U.S. state of Michigan.Clifton, 78. Wilamet was therefore not a traditional Potawatomi leader (or okamaClifton, 57.), but was instead a \\"chief\\" appointed by the French.Clifton, 85-86. French-appointed chiefs were a common feature of the Franco-Indian alliance. According to historian Richard White, \\"as the French singled out certain leaders to be the channels by which French power entered the villages, they created a new kind of chief which can best be distinguished as an alliance chief\\".White, 38. Wilamet helped La Salle promote French policies while countering Iroquois influence in the Lake Michigan region. In 1694, a man named Ouilamek, probably the same Wilamet, led 30 Potawatomis in an expedition under Cadillac against the Iroquois.Clifton, 83. In 1701, Wilamet and Onanghisse (or Onangizes), another prominent Potawatomi alliance chief,White, 39. represented the Potawatomis at the great Treaty of Montreal, which ended the war with the Iroquois.Clifton, 86. During the Fox Wars (1712‚Äì1733), a Wilamek was a leader of the Fish clan of the St. Joseph Potawatomis.Clifton, 89. Historian David Edmunds portrays this man as the same one who had attended the 1701 treaty, although Richard White writes that a Wilamek of this era was of a man of Sauk and Meskwaki (Fox) parentage who had married into the Potawatomi tribe.White, 171. In 1719, Wilamek traveled to Montreal with a group of Meskwaki leaders in an effort to make peace. The following year, his son was captured by the Meskwakis, but he was later released.Clifton, 89; Edmunds, 34. War of 1812 era During the War of 1812 era, the Potawatomis, like other tribes, were divided over whether to oppose the expansion of the United States or to seek peaceful accommodation. Two men named Winamac were prominent in this era. One was an active opponent of the United States, while the other became a U.S. ally. These two men have often been confused with each other.Edmunds, 307n66. American historians have often distinguished them by referring to the \\"anti-American\\" or \\"hostile\\" Winamek and the \\"pro-American\\" or \\"friendly\\" Winamek.Clifton, 528; Edmunds, 307n66. =Anti-Colonization Winamac= The \\"anti-American\\" Winamac was a Potawatomi leader who first appears in the historical record in 1810. That year, while returning from an unsuccessful raid against the Osages, Winamac's party stole horses from some white Illinois settlers. The settlers pursued the raiders, and the Potawatomis attacked, killing four men. Governor Ninian Edwards demanded that the Potawatomis surrender the raiders, but chief Gomo informed U.S. officials that the raiders had gone to Prophetstown in Indiana, headquarters of the anti- American resistance movement led by the Shawnee Prophet and his brother Tecumseh.Edmunds, 172-73. Along with chiefs Shabbona and Waubonsie, Winamac led the Potawatomi contingent against the Americans at the Battle of Tippecanoe at Prophetstown in 1811.Edmunds, 177. Winamac began the organization for the 1812 siege of Fort Wayne. Late in August, Winamac called together a war party from northern Indiana and Michigan. First attempting to convince Captain Rhea of their friendly intent, they sought entry to the post. Rebuffed, on August 28, 1812 the warriors killed a clerk who left the post for the Ohio. What followed were occasional firing of outbuildings and shots aimed at any and all movement seen from the outside. On September 4, Winamac approached under a flag of truce. Making no offer, Winamac found the fort susceptible to attack. The next day, two soldiers were killed outside the fort. Late in the afternoon, Winamac approached the fort with a small delegation and sought admittance to see the commander. Inside, they were heavily guarded, ending their ploy to kill the commander and attack from inside. The following day, September 6, saw the greatest action in the siege, but without help, the fort could not be taken. On September 11, a relief column under Governor Harrison arrived from Piqua and the siege ended. After the siege of Fort Wayne, Winamac served as a scout under British Indian agent Matthew Elliott. On November 22, 1812, Winamac was with a scouting party that captured several Indians, including Shawnee chief Logan (Spemica Lawba), a U.S. ally. Winamac was killed in an exchange of gunfire when Logan and his companions escaped; Logan died later from his wounds.Edmunds, 192. =Pro- Colonization Winamac= The \\"pro-American\\" Winamek was a chief from the Tippecanoe Potawatomi on the Wabash. Beginning in 1807 he and Five Medals and Topinabee continued to ask the American government for agricultural help. The equipment that was sent was never used, as only these chiefs were interested in agriculture, not their people. In 1807, President Monroe wanted to acquire more Indian land. A council was called at Fort Wayne in September. Winamac led the Potawatomi delegation. When the other chiefs and the Miami refused to negotiate land cessions, it was Winamac who persuaded first the Miami and then the Potawatomi to agree to the cession. When were agreed to, none were lands of the Potawatomi. Winamac and the Potawatomi received a generous share of the payment for these lands. The months following the treaty found Winamac at Detroit settling disputes for the lands in northwest Ohio. Because of the Fort Wayne Treaty, discontent was growing and the number of warriors at Prophetstown was increasing. Winamac provided information to Governor Harrison on the plans and activities at Prophetstown. Harrison invited the Prophet to Washington and in June, Tecumseh led a delegation to Vincennes to meet with Harrison. Here, Tecumseh denounced Winamac as a 'black dog' for supporting the American interests.Indian Names in Indiana by Alan McPherson, 1993 Through the winter of 1811-1812, Potawatomi raids were launched against settlements in southern Indiana and Illinois. To end the destruction, councils were held at Cahokia and Vincennes. Winamac and Five Medals assured the agents that the few anti-American warriors were not representative of the Potawatomi. Because of the influence of the pro-British chiefs, Winamac and Five Medals refused a trip to Washington. Tecumseh the Shawnee spoke at the council blaming Winamac and Five Medals for not controlling their warriors. When Gov. Harrison marched north to Prophetstown on the Tippecanoe in November 1811, Winamac marched with him. When they were a short march from Prophetstown, Winamac went ahead to talk with the Prophet. Winamac returned south to meet Harrison, but was on the far side of the Wabash and passed him by. On the night of November 6, Gov. Harrison encamped for the night, planning on entering Prophetstown the next day. When the sun rose, the confederacy had surrounded the troops. The Potawatomi were led by Shabbona with Waubansee and Winamac (2nd another chief among the Potawatomi). The defeat of the Indian confederacy scattered the tribes to their home villages. The dispersal of the Indian confederacy did not end the raids among the settlements. Tension was so bad, even Winamac was warned to stay out of the settlements. His unfailing support of the Americans would not protect him from harm. When the war between the United States and England was known, Winamac continued to support the Americans and led a delegation to the Lake Peoria villages seeking the warriors accused of raiding the settlements. He was ridiculed by the Potawatomi warriors and left unsuccessful. It was Winamac who carried William Hulls orders from Detroit to Fort Dearborn (Chicago) to evacuate, an attack was eminent. Winamac told Commander Heald that they must leave that day to save themselves, this was on August 9. On August 13, an escort of 13 Miami Indians arrived. On August 15, Mad Sturgeon and Blackbird led the Potawatomi ambush of 500+ warriors against the 62 soldiers and 27 civilians in the dunes of Lake Michigan. Fifty-three of the Americans died that day. Fifteen of the Indians died. Fort Dearborn fell on August 15, 1812 to an ambush, then Mackinac. These were followed by the siege of Detroit, which surrendered to the British on August 16. In September 1817, Winamac and Metea represented the eastern Potawatomis at the treaty of Fort Meigs, in which they sold lands in Ohio and south central Michigan to the United States.Edmunds, 219. Winamac died in 1821.

Silla began as one of the six ruling clans of Saro. Around 80 AD, the leadership of Saro was seized and consolidated by Talhae of Silla. The state of Saro began forming a confederation with neighboring walled-town states, and gradually gained strength. Saro ultimately became the Kingdom of Silla.  The reign of Pasa Isageum  In 88 AD, Silla built two forts named Gaso (Í∞ÄÏÜåÏÑ±, Âä†Âè¨Âüé), and Madu (ÎßàÎëêÏÑ±, È¶¨È†≠Âüé), to guard against the encroachment of the Kingdom of Baekje and the Gaya confederacy, respectively. This led to the start of tensions with Gaya. It was not until 94 AD that Gaya initiated hostilities against Silla. Subsequently, the two powers went to war again in 97 AD. Both of these campaigns were unsuccessful. In the twenty-third year of the reign of King Pasa, Silla gained control over the previously independent states of Siljikgok (present-day Samcheok), Eumjipbeol (present-day northern Gyeongju), and Apdok (present-day Gyeongsan). Six years later, Silla took over the states of Biji (present-day Hapcheon), Dabeol (present-day Pohang), and Chopal (present-day Changwon) as well. These, together with U-si and Kueo-ch‚Äôil, which has been added the year before Pasa's accession, constituted a considerable increase in the territory of the Kingdom of Silla.  The reign of Jima Isageum  Under King Jima, relations with the neighboring Gaya confederacy became peaceful, following unsuccessful invasion attempts in 115 AD and 116 AD.

The German portion of the route, between Berlin and Rostock, is approximately ; the Danish portion, between Gedser and Copenhagen, is approximately . Between Rostock and Gedser, cyclists must take a ferry. The Berlin‚ÄìCopenhagen Cycle Route is part of the EuroVelo 7 cycling route, which runs from the top of Norway to the island of Malta in the Mediterranean Sea. It also forms part of the German Cycling Network's D-Route 11, which runs from the Bavarian Alps to the Baltic Sea. Route Signpost near Altglobsow in Brandenburg Signpost in Rostock The route is paved for the majority of its length, sometimes running on a road with automobiles, but most of the time its own path, which may or may not run parallel to an auto road. A very few stretches of the route, for example between Neustrelitz and Waren, are not paved but perfectly acceptable to ride over with an average road or hybrid bicycle. Under certain weather conditions these unpaved roads might require special attention while riding over. Distinctive signs mark the route at most junctions but acquiring a route map to keep on the journey or a GPS navigation device loaded with the route (available through the official site) is recommended. In Denmark, the path is fully signposted as National Route 9, with red N9 on a blue background. The ferry across the Gr√∏nsund runs only during the summer, about 15 May to 15 September, and during a short period in October. Accommodation should be planned in advance by those travelling during high tourist seasons such as summer, as many hotels and hostels will have no vacancies towards the end of the day.

It is characterised by the fusion of two or more digits of the feet. This is normal in many birds, such as ducks; amphibians, such as frogs; and mammals, such as kangaroos. In humans it is considered unusual, occurring in approximately one in 2,000 to 2,500 live births. Most commonly the second and third toes are webbed or joined by skin and flexible tissue. This can reach either part way up or nearly all the way up the toe.  Cause  The exact cause of the condition is unknown. In some cases, close family members may share this condition. In other cases, no other related persons have this condition. The scientific name for the condition is syndactyly, although this term covers both webbed fingers and webbed toes. Syndactyly occurs when apoptosis or programmed cell death during gestation is absent or incomplete. Webbed toes occur most commonly in the following circumstances: *Syndactyly or familial syndactyly *Down syndrome It is also associated with a number of rare conditions, notably: *Aarskog‚ÄìScott syndrome *Acrocallosal syndrome *Apert syndrome *Bardet‚ÄìBiedl syndrome *Carpenter syndrome *Cornelia de Lange syndrome *Edwards syndrome *Jackson‚ÄìWeiss syndrome *Fetal hydantoin syndrome *Miller syndrome *Pfeiffer syndrome *Smith‚ÄìLemli‚ÄìOpitz syndrome *Timothy syndrome *Ectodermal dysplasia *Klippel‚ÄìFeil syndrome  Diagnosis  This condition is normally discovered at birth. If other symptoms are present, a specific syndrome may be indicated. Diagnosis of a specific syndrome is based on family history, medical history, and a physical exam. Webbed toes are also known as \\"twin toes,\\" \\"duck toes,\\" \\"turkey toes\\", \\"tree toes\\" and \\"tiger toes.\\" Severity can vary. Most cases involve the second and third toes but any number of toes can be involved. In some cases the toes are joined part way while in some the webbing can extend right up to the nails. In some cases the entire toes, including the nails and bones, can be fused.  Treatment  Partial simple syndactyly before surgery Partial simple syndactyly, 4 months post-op Webbed toes can be separated through surgery. Surgical separation of webbed toes is an example of body modification. As with any form of surgery, there are risks of complications. The end results depend on the extent of the webbing and underlying bone structure. There is usually some degree of scarring, and skin grafts may be required. In rare instances, nerve damage may lead to loss of feeling in the toes and a tingling sensation. There are also reports of partial web grow-back. The skin grafts needed to fill in the space between the toes can lead to additional scars in the places where the skin is removed.

Nestled in the Pambak mountains, Kecharis was founded by a Pahlavuni prince in the 11th century, and construction continued until the middle of the 13th century. In the 12th and 13th centuries, Kecharis was a major religious center of Armenia and a place of higher education. Today, the monastery has been fully restored and is clearly visible from the ski slopes. The domes of the two main churches were heavily damaged in an earthquake in 1927. The buildings were conserved during the period of the Armenian SSR, and rebuilding work started in the 1980s. A series of nationwide problems led to a halt in the rebuilding for about a decade as the 1988 Armenian earthquake hit, the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, the Nagorno- Karabakh War broke out, and Armenia was blockaded by its two allied Turkic neighbors. Rebuilding work resumed at Kecharis in 1998 and finished in 2000. The restarted work was paid for by an Armenian donor from Vienna, Vladimir Harutyunian, in memory of his parents Harutyun and Arsenik. Complex The main group of the complex consists of three churches, two chapels and a gavit, to the west of which, a few dozen meters away, there is another church with its own vestry at the side of a road leading to the forest. There still are many tombstones around these monuments. =Saint Grigor Church= Saint Grigor altar The main temple, the church of Saint Grigor, is the monastery's first structure erected by Grigor Magistros Pahlavuni in 1013. Being of a domed hall type, it is one of the typical church structures of the period of developed feudalism in Armenia. The interior of the temple is divided into three spaces by two pairs of wall-attached abutments. The central (and largest) space of the church is crowned by a broad cupola resting on spherical pendentives. The cupola and pendentives were destroyed by an earthquake in 1927, and reconstructed in 2000. The semicircular altar apse has two-storey vestries on either side. Three triangular niches behind the altar provide openings for light. The sole of the altar has carved geometrical ornament, alternating with rosettes in places. =Surp Nshan Church= S. Nshan Church The church of Surp Nshan (, \\"Holy Sign of Cross\\" in Armenian), situated south of the church of Grigor, is a small cross-winged domed structure built, judging by the type of the building and by architectural details, in the 11th century, probably soon after the church of S. Grigor. =Katoghike Church= Katoghike Church The Katoghike (Cathedral) church stands south of S. Nshan, with a narrow passage dividing them. Judging by an inscription, it was built under Prince Vasak Khakhpakyan of the Proshyan clan (in the first quarter of the 13th century) by the architect Vetsik, in whose memory a khachkar, ornamented with highly artistic carving, was put up a little south of the church. The Katoghike church belongs to the cross-winged domed type and has two-story annexes in all the four corners of the prayer hall. The entrances to the upper eastern annexes are from the side of the altar apse. Stone cantilever stairs lead to the western annexes of the first floor. The character of Katoghike church's decoration is connected with the artistic traditions of the time when it was built. The round cupola drum was destroyed by earthquake in 1927 (also rebuilt in by 2000), and is decorated with a 12-arch arcature. The front wall of the altar has carved khachkar-type crosses, and there are rosettes on the walls and on the spherical pendentives of the cupola where they alternate with flat arch motives. =Gavit= Gavit interior The gavit, built in the second half of the 12th century and attached to the western facade of S. Grigor church, is an early structure of this type. The rectangular hall is divided into nine sections by four heavy free-standing columns. The eastern corners of the interior are taken up by small two-storey annexes which first appeared in this form in this gavit. The architectural details of the building are rather modest. The small windows are topped by profiled edges above which there are, in the middle window of the southern facade, octafoil rosettes and sun dials, widespread in Armenia and, on the western facade, jugs. As distinct from the portals of the churches, the only western entrance is built as a rectangular opening with a niche framed with bunches of small columns and an arch. In the interior, the fine geometrical ornaments on the capitals of the columns and on the cornice of the tent base immediately catch the eye. =Chapel of Saint Grigor= The chapels situated between the churches of Grigor and Surp Nshan were small rectangular ones, with an altar apse and vaulted ceilings. The chapel adjacent to the church of Gregory served as the burial vault of Grigor Magistros Pahlavuni, which means that it was built in the early 11th century. The chapels were united by a small vaulted premise in which classes were probably conducted for the school's students. =Surp Harutyun= Surp Harutyun Church The church of Surp Harutyun (Holy Resurrection), standing on a forest glade, away from the main group, was built by a son of Hasan in 1220. This is a small, outwardly rectangular. domed-hall church with a lofty cupola. The only entrance, with a small vestry in front of it, is from the west. As distinct from the ordinary vestries, it has a vaulted ceiling, and is narrower than the church. A distinctive feature of the structure is that it has, on its western facade, twin openings topped with arches which rest on the wall- attached and intermediate columns. This gives the structure the appearance of an open passage. There are many graves in the church which was probably a family burial vault.

He belonged to the Pathuriaghata branch of the Tagore family and was one of the leaders of the conservative branch of Hindu society.Sengupta, Subodh Chandra and Bose, Anjali (editors), 1976/1998, Sansad Bangali Charitabhidhan (Biographical dictionary) Vol I, , p313, Early life He was educated at home, in Sherborne's school and Hindu College, when it was established in 1817. With his knowledge of traditional smriti and western law, he started practising law in the Dewani Adalat (civil court). Within a short period he was appointed the government lawyer, but left that job in 1850, to look after family property. When the Viceroy‚Äôs Council was formed in 1854, he joined as clerk-assistant. At that time he was respected as one of the rich Bengalis. Achievements Although he was founder-secretary of the conservative Gaudiya Samaj (1823), he had participated in Raja Rammohun Roy‚Äôs campaign for the abolition of sati. He was one of the original trustees (by the 1830 Trust deed of Brahmo Sabha) of the Brahmo Samaj.Sastri, Sivanath, History of the Brahmo Samaj, 1911-12/1993, p549, 557, Sadharan Brahmo Samaj, 211 Bidhan Sarani, Kolkata. Derozio severely criticized the celebration of Durga Puja by Prasanna Coomar, who called himself a follower of the theistic Rammohan.Sengupta, Nitish, History of the Bengali-speaking People, 2001/2002, p227, UBS Publishers‚Äô Distributors Pvt. Ltd., He was actively associated with many organisations of the period. Along with Dwarkanath Tagore he was actively involved in setting up Landholders' Society and British Indian Association. He became president of the latter in 1867. He played a leading role in the spread of education. The famous Tagore Law Professorship of Calcutta University was maintained from the interest earned from his donation. As the spokesman of the landholders, he opposed the Sepoy Mutiny in principle and the British government bestowed the title of CSI on him in 1866. His writings include An Appeal to Countrymen and Table of Succession according to Hindu Law of Bengal. The first Bengali plays had been staged by the remarkable Russian scholar adventurer Gerasim Lebedev in 1796, but his pioneer efforts bore no fruit. Prasanna Coomar picked up the thread. In 1832, he built a makeshift auditorium in his house at Narkeldanga. Although only a few English plays were staged there, it was a new beginning that was followed up by others.Raha, Kironmaoy, Calcutta Theatre 1835-1944, in Calcutta, the Living City, Vol I, edited by Sukanta Chaudhuri, pp 58-59, Oxford University Press, . He opposed the activities of Christian missionaries all his life, but his son Gnanendramohan Tagore (1826-1890), a brilliant student, converted to Christianity in 1851 and later married Kamalmani, daughter of Rev Krishna Mohan Banerjee. He went to England and was professor of Hindu Law and Bengali in London. He was the first Indian barrister and returned to India to practice law.

MTP is a hetero-octamer composed of four alpha and four beta subunits: * HADHA * HADHB The three functions are 2-enoyl coenzyme A (CoA) hydratase, long-chain 3-hydroxy acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase and long-chain 3-ketoacyl CoA thiolase. Association with the electron transport chain Fatty acid beta-oxidation (FAO) and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) are two major metabolism pathways in the mitochondria. Reducing equivalents from FAO enter OXPHOS at the level of Complexes I and III. In 2010, Wang et al. discovered a functional and physical association between MTP and ETC respirasomes. Not only does MTP appear to be bound to Complex I, but it also appears to channel substrates between the two enzymes. This is especially interesting, because up until then it was unknown exactly how MTP was associated with the inner mitochondrial membrane, and this discovery may provide the explanation. Hormonal influences Recent research has revealed that MTP can be affected by various hormones, via hormone receptors located in the mitochondria. Chochron et al. (2012) demonstrated that thyroid hormone stimulates mitochondrial metabolism in a pathway mediated by MTP. Zhou et al. (2012) used 2D gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry to identify MTP as one of the proteins that interacts with ER alpha, a receptor triggered by estrogen. Cardiolipin remodeling In 2009, Taylor et al. identified a human mitochondrial protein, monolysocardiolipin acyltransferase (MLCL AT-1), that is identical in amino acid sequence to the 59-kDa C-terminal end of MTP, linking MTP to the remodeling of cardiolipin from monolysocardiolipin. Although MLCL AT-1 and MTP are different proteins, in 2012 the same lab discovered that MTP did indeed have cardiolipin remodeling capabilities. This suggests a possible link between mitochondrial membrane cardiolipin content and beta oxidation. Clinical significance Disorders associated MTP are: * Mitochondrial trifunctional protein deficiency * LCHAD deficiency * Acute fatty liver of pregnancy References External links * Category:Proteins ","title":"Mitochondrial trifunctional protein"},{"id":"6609888","text":"Toft Newton is a civil parish in the West Lindsey district of Lincolnshire, England.

WPLP AM was the first 24-hour news/talk radio station in the Tampa Bay metropolitan area. It began broadcasting at 570 AM on December 4, 1978. Its image name was \\"News/Talk 57 WPLP: The Talk of Tampa Bay.\\" The 570 dial position in Tampa Bay began in 1966 as WFSO (not related to the New York State-based current station using those call letters), a low-power, daytime- only station operated by Elwyn Johnson and his son Dan. Under the image name of \\"Big 57,\\" WFSO was a Top 40 station that evolved in the early 1970s into hard rock. The station was purchased in 1978 and converted to WPLP. The owners of the new talk station was a conglomerate of three investors, including Paul Bilzerian, who would later go on to become a corporate raider, and Michael Spears, a Dallas radio personality. Bilzerian and the other two investors bickered over finances and soon the station went into Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, to be reacquired by Dan Johnson. By 1984, the station was owned as a standalone AM by Guy Gannett Broadcasting, and broadcast out of a modified trailer that sat off the then-unpaved 82nd Avenue North in Seminole, and on the edge of a swamp; the dirt road and swampy location were the objects of frequent jokes on WPLP and other stations (who nicknamed it \\"Plop 57\\" in a corruption of its call letters). It was an affiliate of CBS News and of Larry King's syndicated late-night radio show. Popular local personalities over its ten-year history included John Eastman, David Gold, Dave Scott, Richard Shanks, Tim Coles, Tedd Webb, Ken Charles, Don Richards (a newscaster who was also the station's program director) Nanci Donnellan, Valerie Geller, Gordon Byrd, Chuck Harder, David Fowler, Sam Cardinale, who later became an award- winning reporter at 97 WFLA (and later a reporter at WTVT- Channel 13), Rick Samples, and Bob Lassiter. Among the news people who cut their teeth at WPLP in the early days are John McConnell, Terry McElhatton, Dave Hayes and Steve Triggs. Although WPLP was the first talk radio station in Tampa Bay, it struggled in the market. It briefly (August 1981-December 1982) had competition in WNSI at AM 1380, but when NSI changed its format WPLP went head-to-head with WFLA, a station with a more powerful signal and larger budget that routinely beat WPLP in the ratings after it switched to news/talk in 1986. It was only in the mid-80s, when Fowler and Lassiter arrived, that WPLP became genuinely competitive. Fowler and his morning-show competition at WFLA (first Jack Ellery, then Dick Norman) swapped ratings victories, while Bob Lassiter won his timeslots in every Arbitron ratings book with double his competitors' numbers before departing for WFLA in September 1987. WPLP was what is known as a \\"pig\\" in the radio industry: a low-budget station with little financial success and a poor signal--one that didn't even reach as far as Tampa in inclement weather (partly because Cuban state radio broadcast at 570 AM. In 1986 Gannett applied for a power increase which, at the time, was limited to 5,000 watts day and night for this frequency by developing a new 6 tower array north of Tampa. But at nighttime, in violation of the international broadcast regulations; the station received interference from a Cuban station. While the FCC was considering the power increase Gannett petitioned for additional nighttime power of 10,000 watts based on similar request at Gannett's Miami station WINZ. So WPLP became the 1st station that had more power at night than day. The station installed a pair of 10,000 watt Continental transmitters and phasor. The day and night signal covered from north of Tampa all the way to Sarasota, that solved the Cuban interference problem over the market. Despite Gannett and the staff's best efforts, WPLP had a tremendously hard time selling advertising time. Their target audience was Tampa Bay's sizable population of retirees; while that audience gave the station a loyal following, it was outside the 25-54 age group that is the most important demographic for advertisers. Yet even when Lassiter ruled the airwaves, its sales staff had a very few clients (and those were often threatened with boycotts by opponents of the controversial and caustic Lassiter). In 1987, Gannett negotiated with Susquehanna Radio Corporation to purchase WHVE-FM to pair with WPLP and WKIS in Orlando to pair up with Gannett's WSSP. Gannet would then have AM/FM operation in both Tampa and Orlando to go along with their Miami Radio WINZ-AM/FM. The final arrangement was to transfer WPLP to Susquehanna and WKIS to Gannett and became effective on March 4, 1988, fired several staffers (including Fowler and Richards), and applied for new call letters. Within one month, WPLP had ceased to exist. All but one (John Eastman) of its air staff had been released, new offices and studio were found in St. Petersburg, and the station had become WTKN, which subsequently plummeted into ratings insignificance with shares below 1 percent. Today, following further sales to other owners, the 570 frequency is occupied by WTBN, a religious radio station owned by Salem Communications.

In Europe, it occurs from southern Poland and Austria south through the Balkans and east to southern Russia; and in Asia, east to the Caucasus. It is a shrub growing . The leaves are deciduous, 5‚Äì10 cm long and 2‚Äì4 cm broad. The flowers are 3‚Äì4 cm in diameter, bright yellow, and strongly perfumed, produced in trusses of 5-25 together. The fruit is a dry capsule 15‚Äì25 mm long, containing numerous small seeds. Despite the sweet perfume of the flowers, the nectar is toxic, containing grayanotoxin; records of poisoning of people eating the honey date back to the 4th century BC in Classical Greece. Cultivation and uses It is widely cultivated in western Europe, used both as an ornamental plant in its own right, and as a rootstock onto which other azalea cultivars are grafted. It is locally naturalised in western and northern Europe. In Great Britain it has colonised many wet heaths and bogs, but unlike its relative Rhododendron ponticum it does not usually form dominant stands and so is of lower nature conservation concern. However it is listed under Schedule 9 of the UK Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 as a non-native invasive species. While it is legal to sell and grow it in gardens, users are expected to take care when disposing of material from this plant. R. luteum has gained the Royal Horticultural Society‚Äôs Award of Garden Merit. Cultural references The plant is depicted instead of the crown above the coat of arms of the Local Community of Bo≈°tanj. It has been chosen because the area is one of the rare growing places of Rhododendron luteum in Slovenia. The coat of arms was created in 1998 by the artist Rudi Stopar.

Adele De Garde, was an American silent film actress, who appeared in 114 films between 1908 and 1918. Born Adelaide De Gard in Brooklyn, New York, DeGarde was a Biograph Studios child star in the early part of the 20th century. Later she became a Vitagraph Studios leading lady. In 1939, she attended an Old Home Week at Ohrbach's in New York with other movie actors such as Mae Murray and June Elvidge. Career In 1908, when pictures were looked at with a bit of apprehension, DeGarde (at the age of eight) began to appear in Vitagraph Studios. And DeGarde and her little pal, Kenneth Casey, were the mischievous, spoiled, or ill-treated children around whom centered many a melodramatic plot. As new stars joined the Vitagraph forces, DeGarde and Kenneth played with them. Many a picture of the \\"two-generation\\" or \\"from-child-to-woman\\" type would open with DeGarde as its child heroine and finish with Leah Baird, Edith Storey, or Dorothy Kelly rounding out the plot when the child had grown up. As the years grew, so did DeGarde, until finally she grew too large for little-girl-before- growing-up parts, and, with many sighs, her directors were forced to \\"pass her up\\" and cast anxious glances around for another promising child. Loath to part with their two clever little players, the company produced some exceedingly funny pictures enacted entirely by children about fourteen or fifteen. These comedies proved extremely popular, because of the fact that they were so typical of children at that age. When Vitagraph was casting Within the Law, they were a trifle at a loss as to whom they should give the part of Aggie Lynch, a character on whom all the comedy relief of the play was dependent. After a careful study of the part, it was determined that DeGarde should have it. Press critics had nothing but lavish praise for her performance as Lynch and pronounced it \\"a huge success\\". (Note: Out of copyright) Reviews for Within the Law *Variety: \\"Adele DeGarde as Aggie Lynch, which in reality is nothing more than a comedy foil for the lead, had something on the star, judging from the impression she left on the minds of the audience.\\" *Moving Picture World: \\"Adele DeGarde as Aggie Lynch must be credited with one of the best performances in the picture.

This article uses the word 'GeoWall' as a convenient trisyllabic equivalent for \\"low-cost polarization-based dual- projector interactive 3D stereoscopic system\\". Interactivity is a crucial aspect to GeoWalls, particularly for real-time data exploration. Without interactivity, a GeoWall is merely a system for viewing 3D films ‚Äì a cheap 3D IMAX on a smaller screen. GeoWalls are examples of passive Virtual Reality, in the sense that there is no head tracking. Instead of a complete immersive experience for one user, there is a partial immersive experience for multiple users. This makes it suitable for classrooms, group presentations, and interactive museum shows.  Origins of the name  The first GeoWall was built in January 2001 by Prof. Jason Leigh at the Electronic Visualization Laboratory (EVL) at the University of Illinois at Chicago, home of the Cave Automatic Virtual Environment (CAVE), when asked by Paul Morin if a stripped- down single-wall CAVE would provide a level of 3D immersion acceptable for exploring geoscience data at a price affordable to smaller institutions like museums and academic departments. So instead of a complete CAVE, it was only a single wall, and being used primarily for geology, it was a \\"geology wall\\" or GeoWall. Shortly after the first GeoWall was built, the GeoWall Consortium was created to support the development and distribution of software and data for the GeoWall users. Today, the GeoWall Consortium remains an active user group, whose members have made available free and/or open-source software, content, and documentation. Over 500 GeoWalls have been built since 2005 and the numbers continue to grow. The GeoWall Consortium can be accessed through its website geowall.org and mailing list.  Data Interactively Explored with GeoWalls  GeoWalls have been used to explore data in several domains. Stereo photographs and movies can be viewed on a GeoWall, as well as most 3D models. Here are some examples of other data sets that are freely available. All can be modified to work on regular single-screen computers. * GeoWall Consortium has several visualizations, including  Global Earthquakes.

It is edited by Karl Holbrook. There are around twenty towns in the area, including Blackburn, Burnley, Accrington, Darwen, Nelson, Clitheroe, Colne, and Rawtenstall. The editor is Karl Holbrook, who is also the group editor of Newsquest's newspaper brands across Lancashire and Greater Manchester, including The Bolton News, Bury Times, The Oldham Times and Salford City News. The newspapers are owned by Newsquest, a division of Gannett, a firm based in the United States. History The newspaper was founded by Thomas Purvis Ritzema, a young newspaper manager, who purchased two shops at 19 and 21 Railway Road, Blackburn, for the launch of his venture. The first copy appeared on the streets on 26 October 1886, and sold for a ha‚Äôpenny. It was known then as the Northern Daily Telegraph, and it was the first evening newspaper to be published in East Lancashire. In 1894, the head office was moved to the corner site of Railway Road and High Street. From 7 September 1939, soon after the start of World War II, advertisements gave way to news on the front page. On 10 December 1956, it changed its title to the Northern Evening Telegraph and on 2 September 1963, the name changed again to Lancashire Evening Telegraph. The newspaper used full colour for the first time, on 11 November 1963, with spot colour introduced on 25 January 1965, and colour in classified advertising following on 19 March 1965. In 1982, it moved to the south side of High Street, which marked the introduction of new computerised technology. The new offices were built on part of the Dutton's brewery site; the old offices were demolished, and after the remainder of the brewery closed in the mid 1980s, the supermarket (Morrisons) was built on the site. In 1995, the Lancashire Evening Telegraph became the first regional newspaper in Britain to put daily, updated news on the internet. In February 2006, in order to cut costs, the company announced it was to close its district offices in the Lancashire towns of Burnley, Accrington and Darwen. On 17 July 2006, the newspaper changed its name to the: Lancashire Telegraph, as it switched to overnight printing, in order to distribute copies in the morning. It was North West: Newspaper of the Year in the How Do! Awards, 2011. In March 2017, the newspaper moved to Church Street, and the offices on High Street were converted into apartments.

Bridging the gap between the Ford V8 DeLuxe and the Lincoln Model K (in both size and price), the Lincoln-Zephyr expanded Lincoln to a second model line, competing against the Chrysler Airstream, LaSalle, and the Packard One-Twenty. Following the discontinuation of the Model K after 1940, Lincoln shifted its production exclusively to the Lincoln-Zephyr design; after World War II, the Zephyr name was dropped, lasting through 1948. The Lincoln-Zephyr would serve as the basis of the first Lincoln Continental, the longest-running nameplate of the Lincoln brand. The model line was powered by a V12 engine, in contrast to the V8 and inline-8 engines of its competitors. The Lincoln-Zephyr was conceived by Edsel Ford and designed by Eugene Turenne Gregorie. The model line was assembled at the Lincoln Motor Company Plant in Detroit, Michigan. Overview Introduced on November 2, 1935, as a 1936 model, the Lincoln-Zephyr was extremely modern with a low raked windscreen, integrated fenders, and streamlined aerodynamic design, which influenced the name \\"zephyr\\", derived from the Greek word zephyrus, or the god of the west wind. It was one of the first successful streamlined cars after the Chrysler Airflow's market resistance, and the concept car Pierce Silver Arrow, which never went into production. In fact, the Lincoln-Zephyr actually had a lower coefficient of drag than the Airflow, due in part to the prow-like front grille on the Zephyr, reflecting the popularity of leisure speedboats like Chris-Craft. The Lincoln-Zephyr succeeded in reigniting sales at Lincoln dealerships in the late 1930s, and from 1941 model year, all Lincolns were Zephyr-based and the Lincoln-Zephyr marque was phased out. Annual production for any year model was not large, but accounted for a large portion of the Lincoln brand's sales. In its first year, 15,000 were sold, accounting for 80% of Lincoln's total sales. Production of all American cars was halted by the Government in 1942 as the country entered World War II, with Lincoln producing the last Lincoln Zephyr on February 10. After the war, most makers restarted production of their prewar lines, and Lincoln was no exception. The Zephyr name, however, was no longer used after 1942, with the cars simply called Lincolns. The idea of a smaller and more modern luxury car to fill the gap in Lincoln's traditional lineup was revisited in the 1950 Lincoln Lido (The Lido was the same size as other two- door Lincolns, though), 1977 Lincoln Versailles, 1982 Continental, and 2000 Lincoln LS. The Zephyr name was resurrected in 2006 for the car's spiritual successor, the Zephyr, which was quickly renamed the MKZ for 2007.

Radio was optional. The turning radius was .http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Lincoln/1936_Lincoln/1936_Lincoln_Zephyr_Folder/1936%20Lincoln%20Zephyr-04.html For 1937 the 2-door Sedan was renamed Coupe-Sedan, a Coupe (3-Window) was added along with a formal Town-Limousine. For 1938 a Convertible Coupe and a Convertible Sedan was added. For 1940 the Coupe-Sedan was replaced by the Club Coupe, the Convertible Sedan was discontinued. Trunk space was increased in 1940. * Lincoln-Zephyr Continental (1940) was the first time the name Continental appeared on a car from Lincoln, as a model under Lincoln-Zephyr rather than a separate model. They were partially hand-built since dies for machine-pressing were not constructed until 1941. Production started on December 13, 1939, with the Continental Cabriolet, from June 1940 also available as Continental Club Coupe. Just 350 Cabriolets and 54 Club Coupes were built. When the last Lincoln V-12 (Model K) had been delivered on January 24, 1940, the Lincoln Motor Company was soon to be transformed into Lincoln Division, effective on May 1, 1940, and for 1941 model year the Lincoln-Zephyr was no longer a separate marque. All 1941 models were Lincolns and the Zephyr- based Lincoln Custom replaced both the large Lincoln K-series cars and the Lincoln-Zephyr Town-Limousine. It also had full instrumentation. The following Lincoln-Zephyr heritage models were sold under Lincoln marque after Lincoln and were merged for the 1941 model year: * Lincoln Zephyr V-12 (1941‚Äì1942) Both years available as Sedan, Coupe, Club Coupe and Convertible Coupe * Lincoln Custom (1941‚Äì1942) Sedan and Limousine, some with blinded quarter roof option * Lincoln Continental (1941‚Äì1948) Cabriolet and Coupe * Lincoln (1946‚Äì1948), or H-series =H-series= 1946 Lincoln coupe When Lincoln resumed production after World War II the Zephyr name was dropped and the full-size luxury cars sold without a proper model name, known just by their body styles - Sedan, Club Coupe, or Convertible Coupe - during the 1946-1948 model years. For identification purposes, they are typically referred to as the H-Series, while the approach of offering a luxuriously equipped vehicle in a smaller size was ceded to the all-new Mercury in 1938. Their appearance was very similar to the contemporaneous Lincoln Continental coupe and convertible. An electric clock was standard. This series of vehicles continued to use the 305 in¬≥ (4.8 L) 65¬∞ L-head Lincoln V12 engine. Specifications Lincoln- Zephyr V12 engine The Zephyr was designed by John Tjaarda (1897‚Äì1962), who was fascinated with airplanes, resulting in unibody construction relatively light and rigid for its size and a drag coefficient of 0.45. Weight was 3,350 lb (1,520 kg). The Zephyr was powered by a small 75¬∞ V12 engine developed from Ford's Flathead V8 and unrelated to the larger K-series Lincoln V12 engines. The valve-in-block flathead engine was quite compact, allowing a low hood. But like the V8 Fords of the era, the Zephyr V12 often suffered from hot spots due to exhaust passages through the cylinder block. In addition, the earliest Zephyrs suffered from poor oil pressure, resulting in upgrades to the oil pump. The 1936 to 1939 models were 267 in¬≥ (4.4 L) with hydraulic lifters added in 1938. The 1940 and 1941 cars used an enlarged 292-in¬≥ (4.8-L) engine, while 1942 and early 1946 models used a 306-in¬≥ (5.0-L), but lower compression ratio because of the iron heads. Late 1946 to 1948 Lincolns based on the Zephyr used a 292-in¬≥ engine. The original engine had 110 hp (82 kW) and gave the car a top speed of . Suspension was Henry Ford-era transverse springs front and rear, with dead axle front and torque tube rear, already quite outdated when the car was introduced. Brakes were cable-activated for 1936 to 1938; 1939 and onwards were hydraulic. The Zephyr was the first Ford product to have an all-steel roof, except the late 1931 Model AA truck.

Today, the much-shortened wharf (due to land fill on the city end) functions as a dock for passenger ferries and sightseeing boats. History Boston in 1768, with Long Wharf extending into the harbor. Engraving by alt=A wide view of a port town with several wharves. In the foreground there are eight large sailing ships and an assortment of smaller vessels. Soldiers are disembarking from small boats onto a long wharf. The skyline of the town, with nine tall spires and many smaller buildings, is in the distance. A key at the bottom of the drawing indicates some prominent landmarks and the names of the warships. =18th century= Construction of the wharf began around 1710. As originally built the wharf extended from the shoreline adjacent to Faneuil Hall and was one-third of a mile long, thrusting considerably farther than other wharves into deep water and thus allowing larger ships to tie up and unload directly to new warehouses and stores. \\"Constructed by Captain Oliver Noyes, it was lined with warehouses and served as the focus of Boston's great harbor.\\"Southworth & Southworth. AIA Guide to Boston, 3rd ed. 2008; p.74. Over time the water areas surrounding the landward end of the wharf were reclaimed, including the areas now occupied by Quincy Market and the Customs House. \\"At the wharf's head in the 18th century was the Bunch-of-Grapes Tavern. The painter John Singleton Copley spent his childhood on the wharf, where his mother had a tobacco shop.\\"Southworth & Southworth. 2008; p.74. The 1760s Gardiner Building, once home to John Hancock's counting house and now a Chart House restaurant, is the wharf's oldest surviving structure. Long Wharf, c.19th century Gardiner Building (center) and Marriott Hotel (left) on Long Wharf The old Custom House Block on Long Wharf Viewing plaza at end of the wharf =19th century= Among several similar structures, a grand granite warehouse known as the Custom House Block was built in 1848 atop the wharf; it has survived into the 21st century.Southworth & Southworth. 2008. The mid-19th century was the height of Boston's importance as a shipping center, lasting roughly until the American Civil War. Long Wharf was the central focus of much of this economic activity. In the late 1860s, as the city's port began to decline in importance as an international shipping destination, Atlantic Avenue was cut through this and other wharves, changing the face of the waterfront. =20th century= The construction of the elevated Central Artery along Atlantic Avenue in the 1950s separated Long Wharf from Boston's business district. The wharf and the 19th-century Custom House Block were recognized as a National Historic Landmark in recognition for the role they played in the history of Boston and its importance as a major 19th-century shipping center. =21st century= The Big Dig put the Central Artery below ground level, which partially restored the original close relationship between Long Wharf and downtown. Since ca.1990, Long Wharf has been transformed from a failing commercial waterfront area into a recreational and cultural center. Today, Long Wharf is adjacent to the New England Aquarium, and is served by the Aquarium station on MBTA's Blue Line subway. MBTA boat services link the wharf to the Boston Navy Yard in Charlestown, Logan International Airport, Hull, and Quincy. Other passenger ferry services operate to the islands of the Boston Harbor Islands National Recreation Area, and to the cities of Salem and Provincetown. Cruise boats operate various cruises around the harbour. The wharf itself is occupied by a hotel, several restaurants and shops. At the seaward end, there is a large plaza with extensive views of the harbor. Now much shortened by land reclamation at its landward end, today it serves as the principal terminus for cruise boats and harbor ferries operating on Boston Harbor.

The restaurant's former name, \\"Hitlers' Cross\\", referred to the Hakenkreuz and the Cross of Honour of the German Mother, symbols of the Nazi regime, and the restaurant's interior was decorated in red, white and black - the colours of the Nazi party. An enormous portrait of Hitler was the first thing visitors saw when they opened the door. The manager of Hitlers' Cross told the Times of India: \\"We wanted to be different. This is one name that will stay in people's minds ... we want to tell people we are different in the way he was different.\\" After severe criticism, Hitlers' Cross had to drop its name and is today called the Cross Cafe. Cross Cafe now has a branch in Nerul. Controversy The Hakenkreuz is controversial in parts of the world due to usage by the Third Reich.Mumbai's \\"Hitler\\" eatery angers Indian Jews, by Krittivas Mukherjee, Reuters, 19 August 2006. The Hitler-themed restaurant caused an uproar in the Jewish community in Mumbai and other citizens in the city. Although the store's owner, Punit Sablok, argued that his establishment was not promoting Hitler, Jonathan Solomon, chairman of the Indian Jewish Federation, was among the infuriated. According to Solomon, the new establishment \\"[signified] a severe lack of awareness of the agony of millions of Jews caused by one man,\\" and he promised to work hard \\"to stop this deification of Hitler.\\" According to the Associated Press, there are just 5,500 Jews in India, and all but 1,000 live in Mumbai. Sablok's refusal to change the theme earned the restaurant notoriety around the world as strongly worded letters from Israel and Germany outpoured in the city's dailies. The Israeli Embassy also sent a strongly worded letter to the owners. In India, a caf√© named Hitler's Cross, by Anand Giridharadas, in the International Herald Tribune, 24 August 2006. Finally, on 24 August 2006, after less than a week of international outcry and a meeting with local Jewish leaders, Punit Sablok agreed to remove Hitler's name and the Nazi Hakenkreuz from billboards and the restaurant's menu. \\"I chose the name innocently. I didn't expect that it would snowball into a major controversy\\", Sablok said. At that point, he said he was unsure of the name to be chosen, but sure of one thing: \\"no more dictators\\". The Indian Jewish Federation reacted positively, saying it was relieved. \\"The incident exposes the lack of understanding of the present generation about the atrocities of the past and the need to educate them about crimes against humanity,\\" Solomon said.Under fire, Indian eatery drops Hitler from name, Reuters news bulletin, 24 August 2006. On 30 August, the restaurant was renamed the Cross Cafe. \\"We hope the new name will be a trouble-free one. We have deleted Hitler's name and the Hakenkreuz symbol will be replaced with multi-coloured rings,\\" Punit Sablok said. Two other options, Fort Knox and Exotic Goblet, were considered by the owners before they decided on the new name, Sabhlok added. Puneet Sablok said the Nazi Hakenkreuz that adorned signs advertising the eatery and its menus would be removed.

Its population is around 30,000.http://www.mbjb.gov.my/ms/mbjb/pengurusan/profil- ahli-majlis Geography It is situated on a hilly area near Sungai Sebulong, connecting to Sungai Pandan on the coast of the Straits of Tebrau. It spans over an area of 7.3 km2.http://jpbd.johor.gov.my/images/jpbd_DokumenTerbitan/Handbook.pdf History Its history stretches back to the 15th century, which includes involvement in Portuguese settlements cleared by the legendary \\"Six Friends\\", the new settlement by the people of the heritage family that is related to the family from Pergam Istana Buruk in Muar. They were originally from the old Sultanates of the Kingdom of Johor Lama and Melaka, the Demak Sultanate of Kudus, the Siam Sultanate, the Kelantan 7-tombs, the Hassan, the Sultan of Johor Temenggong Daeng Ibrahim, the British Army, and the Johor Military Force (JMF). Kampung Melayu Majidee and several other villages were used by the British authorities to accommodate their soldiers, which gave the village the name \\"majidee\\", which was used for a large constituency for the security forces for the front line, camp, and battalions to guard the royal family's bank between the mouth of Sungai Pandan and Sungai Skudai. Economy Although the early settlers were the pensioners and merchants, trading activities had a strong presence in the village since the 1950s. Its economy depends on its harbors, resorts, and tourist attractions, for tourists heading to and from Johor Bahru, the World Heritage Site at Tanjung Puteri, Johor River coast to the east, and Muar's geology and landforms to the north. Demographics and culture It is the largest and most populous settlement area with a Malay population, followed by Kampung Baru in Kuala Lumpur, the capital city of Malaysia. Its population is mostly Malay and Javanese. Economically, it is surrounded by fast-paced developments for Johor Bahru. Kampung Melayu Majidee is enjoying the state capital's resources for humanitarian developments and township infrastructures. Mapping Kampung Melayu as a single entity is divided into two mapping regions which divide the east and west parts at the Jalan Merdeka as the west and the east are of the mosque towards Sungai Sebulong alongside Jalan Rahmat. The division started since (?) Transportation =Road= The North‚ÄìSouth Expressway's southern exit point in Johor Bahru Interchange connects Kampung Melayu Majidee from the direction of Ulu Tiram. Kg. Melayu Majidee is flanked by major roads which link to the city. * Jalan Tebrau on the east which links Johor Bahru to the east coast of Johor. * Jalan Tampoi on the north which links part of Jalan Tebrau towards Skudai to the west. * Jalan Stulang Baru on the southwest which links part of Jalan Tebrau towards Larkin Jaya to the west. * There are two infamous main roads in Kg. Melayu Majidee. They are the Jalan Rahmat and Jalan Merdeka. There are several other main link roads such as the Jalan Sekolah, Jalan Utama, Jalan Masjid and Jalan Kenangan . Jalan Masjid links to Jalan Rahmat, while Jalan Merdeka links to Jalan Kenangan. Depending on which direction one approaches, those roads intersect each other. * The first platform of the prelude junctions come with a traffic light that leads to the first four-junctions. It is located right at the tip of the hill with its edge downhill on towards Jalan Rahmat as one approaches from the town's wet market and Johor Bahru. Adjacent to it is the mosque. As one turns to the right, he enters Jalan Merdeka and into the second platform's prelude junction. * While the second platform's prelude junctions consist of a small roundabout, it spreads out to four other roads. If one approaches from Jalan Merdeka, to the left it goes down to the link road to Jalan Rahmat; going forward towards Jalan Kenangan and directed to Jalan Stulang Baru; and to the right at 3 o'clock turn may lead one to Jalan Hujung. * One who had missed the first entrance from Jalan Tebrau from Johor Bahru that is Jalan Utama, shall take the second entrance junction after a short diversion at Jalan Tebrau Lama landmarked with a petrol station located after the first Petronas petrol station. Both are on the left side Jalan Tebrau. Then one proceeds left on towards Jalan Masjid, before proceeding to the first platform, the traffic light and Jalan Rahmat to the hills. Going through Jalan Rahmat to the traffic light which is stationed at that Jalan Stulang Baru and then turning right leads one to the Larkin area, while turning left leads to Jalan Tebrau. * The first entrance from Jalan Tebrau is Jalan Utama. During the early stages of Kampung Melayu's settlement period, that area were supposedly to be developed into the pekan, or town. Jalan Utama is supposedly to become Kampung Melayu's main entrance road. Since the initial plan changed, Jalan Utama became an ordinary linkage road to Jalan Rahmat but remained important. Jalan Utama can be accessed from Jalan Tebrau from Johor Bahru or from the northeast as if after exiting the Johor Bahru toll plaza of the North-South Highway. A notable landmark is the Petronas station, as one passes through, one goes up the first hill. Driving through Jalan Utama about 3 minutes or in 1 kilometre's distance leads to the Jalan Rahmat junction. Turning to the right is the sloppy uphill, you may proceed to the mosque and the village area. Turning left will direct one out of Kampung Melayu from the exit junction with the second traffic light at Jalan Stulang Baru.

(ed. 1988) (an aspect of the goddess Parvati/Gauri) at Mir Ghat on the banks of the Ganges at Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh, India. It is generally regarded as a Shakti Pitha, the most sacred temples dedicated to the Hindu Divine Mother. The earrings of the goddess Sati are said to have fallen on this holy spot of Varanasi. The temple is situated by the famous cremation grounds of Manikarnika. Vishalakshi Temple is known for its temple festival on Kajali Tij, held on the third day during waning fortnight in the Hindu month of Bhadrapada (August). Religious significance Shiva carrying the corpse of Sati. The daughter of Prajapati Daksha, Sati was married to the god Shiva against his wishes. Daksha organized a great yajna, but did not invite Sati and Shiva. Uninvited, Sati reached the yajna-site, where Daksha ignored Sati and vilified Shiva. Unable to withstand this insult, Sati jumped into the sacrificial fire and committed suicide. Sati died, but her corpse did not burn. Shiva (as Virabhadra) slew Daksha for being responsible for Sati's death and forgave him, resurrecting him. The wild, grief-stricken Shiva wandered the universe with Sati's corpse. Finally, the god Vishnu dismembered the body of Sati into 51 parts, each of which became a Shakti Pitha, temple to a form of the Goddess. Shiva is also worshipped at each Shakti Pitha in the form of Bhairava, the male counterpart or guardian of the presiding goddess of the Pitha. Sati's eye or earring is believed to have fallen at Varanasi, establishing Vishalakshi as a Shakti Pitha. However, if one asks at the temple there today, the priest and all others aver that the body part that fell was Her face, which is hidden behind the murti. In the sacred geography of Varanasi, six points are said to symbolize Shastanga (six- fold) yoga, which is performing by visiting the six sites. They are the Vishwanath Temple (the most important temple of Varanasi - dedicated to Shiva), the Vishalakshi Temple, the Ganges, the Kala Bhairava temple (dedicated to Varanasi's guardian deity and Vishalakshi's Bhiarava), the Dhundiraj Temple (dedicated to the god Ganesha - son of Shiva and Parvati) and the Dandapani temple (dedicated to an aspect of Shiva). In Shakti Peetha lists Vishalakshi (Sanskrit: ‡§µ‡§ø‡§∂‡§æ‡§≤‡§æ‡§ï‡•ç‡§∑‡•Ä) or Varanasi figures in most standard lists of Shakti Peethas. The Tantric work Rudrayamala, composed before 1052 CE, mentions 10 principal Shakti Peethas, which includes Varanasi as the fifth one. The Kularnava Tantra mentions 18 Pithas and mentions Varanasi as the sixth one. The Ashadashapitha (18 Peethas) ascribed to Shankaracharya (interpreted as Adi Shankara, however probably Shankara Agamacharya, Bengali author of the Tara-rahasya-vrittika) enumerates 18 names along with their presiding deities or Pitha-devis including Vishalakshi of Varanasi as the fifth Pitha. In the Kubjika Tantra, Varanasi is third in 42 names. There are the two lists of Pithas in the Jnanarnava, one with 8 names and the other with fifty names. The 8-name list does not mention Varanasi, but the other list names Varanasi in the second spot. Vishalakshi of Varanasi is mentioned as first of 108 Shakti Pithas in the list in the Devi Bhagavata Purana. The face of Sati is described to have fallen here. This is the only instance where a body part is related to the Shakti Pitha in the text. The Devi Gita within the same text gives a long list of Pithas, where Vishalakshi is mentioned as dwelling in Avimukta (Varanasi). No body part is related to the Pitha in this list. In the non-scripture 16th century Bengali work Chandimangal, Mukundaram lists nine Pithas in the Daksha-yajna-bhanga section. Varanasi is the last Peetha described to be the place where Sati's chest fell and the presiding goddess being Vishalakshi. Lakshmidhara also includes Vishalakshi in his 12th-century list. The Pithanirnaya or Mahapithanirupana section from the Tantrachudamani originally listed 43 names, but names were added over time making it 51 Peethas. It details the Pitha-devata or Devi (name of goddess at the Pitha), the Kshastradishas (Bhairava, consort of the goddess) and the anga-pratyanga (limbs including ornaments of Sati). Manikarnika at Varanasi with Vishalakshi as the presiding goddess comes in at number 23. A kundala (earring) is the anga-pratyanga and Kala-Bhairava (Kala) is the consort. In some later versions of the text, Varanasi is not included in the chief 51/52 Pithas. In one of the versions, it is demoted from a Pitha to an upa-Pitha (subordinate Pitha). Here, the kundala is said to be anga- pratyanga, but two Pitha-devatas and Bhairavas are mentioned. First, Vishalakshi with Kala-Bhairava and secondary Annapurna with Vishweshvara. Vishweshvara is the presiding deity of Kashi Vishwanath Temple, the most important temple in Varanasi and the Annapurna temple is nearby. History According to the scholar Jones, the Shakti Pithas were originally part of cult worship by the tribals as local deities, which over the centuries were syncretised to Shakthi Peethas under the influence of the Brahmins, and have now a permanent influence on the psyche of the people. In the syncretism of various religious beliefs in the country, as many as 108 goddesses were assimilated in the Shakti Pitha list. Annapurna, the goddess of food and form of Shiva's consort Parvati, is given the epithet Vishalakshi, the \\"wide-eyed\\". Her most famous temple stands at Varanasi, where patron goddess she is considered. The Skanda Purana narrates the tale of the sage Vyasa cursing Varanasi, as no one in the city offered him food. Finally, Vishalakshi appears in the form of a housewife and grants food to Vyasa. This role of Vishalakshi is similar to that of Annapurna, who offers food to her husband Shiva, whose hunger can be satiated by her food. Shiva gratified by Annapurna's food, establishes Varanasi and appoints her as its presiding goddess. The goddess Vishalakshi of the Varanasi temple may have been identified with Annapurna in early times, however over time became a distinct goddess, resulting in the goddess temples. Vishalakshi, the \\"wide-eyed\\" goddess is often associated two other goddesses: Kamakshi, the \\"love-eyed\\" goddess of Kanchipuram and Minakshi, the \\"fish-eyed\\" of Madurai, prominently because of their similar names. Together the three are regarded the most important Goddess temples by South Indians. While Vishalakshi dwells in North India, the other goddess temples are in Tamil Nadu, South India. South Indians venerated Vishalakshi for ages and have strong ties with the temple. South Indian Tamil people also helped renovate the temple in 1971. Worship and festivals Devotees often bathe in the holy Ganges nearby before offering worship at the temple. The puja (worship), offerings, recitation of hymns to the goddess and charity at the temple is considered highly fruitful because of the power of the presiding goddess. The goddess is especially worshipped by unmarried girls for a groom, childless couples for progeny and unfortunate women for the turn of their fortune. Two goddess images are housed side-by-side in the garbhagirha (sanctum): a smaller black stone image called Adi Vishalakshi on left back side and another taller black stone image installed at a later date. Devotees often visit the Vishwanath and Annapurna shrines with this temple.Varanasi Temples Two most important festivals in the temple, as well as all other goddess temples in Varanasi, is two Navaratris (\\"nine nights\\"). The Ashwin Navatri or simply called Navaratri, culminating in Vijayadashami, falls in the waxing fortnight of the Hindu month of Ashwin (October) and celebrates the victory of the goddess Durga on the buffalo-demon Mahishasura. The other Navaratri is in the waxing fortnight of Chaitra (March). On each of nine days, one of Varanasi's goddess temples ‚Äì corresponding to one of the Navadurga (nine Durgas) or nine Gauris (Parvatis) ‚Äì is recommended to be visited. The nine-temple circuit is described in various Kashi mahatmyas (texts narrating the greatness of the holy city of Varanasi/Kashi). Devotees flock to the temple in the evening of the fifth day of Navatri. The yearly temple festival of Vishalakshi Temple is celebrated on Kajali Tij (Black Third), the third lunar day (tij) of the waning fortnight in Bhadrapada, the last month of the Indian rainy season. Women sing \\"amorous\\" rainy season songs called kajali (black) around this time. The holy day is observed especially for the welfare of brothers by women.

Many of the design elements were later used in the HUSS Rainbow, and the term 'Ranger' has become synonymous with inverting pendulum rides. It was the first inverting swing ride designed since Lee Eyerly's Loop-O-Plane and set the standard for many other attractions using the inverting pendulum ride system, such as the Rainbow, the Kamikaze (ride), and the Inverter. Design and operation The ride consists of a single arm mounted to four 90 kW DC motors at the midpoint. A 40-seat gondola is mounted on one end of the arm, with passengers sitting in eight rows, four on each side of the arm, facing inwards. On the opposite end of the arm is a pair of counterweights. The side of the arm facing out to the crowd is decorated with an elaborate lighting array. The ride is designed to rock back and forth, before making several inversions, although the gondola can be inverted from a standing start. Unlike most pendulum rides, the Ranger is reliant primarily on the motors to invert, as opposed to momentum. The ride is capable of maintaining a speed of 8 revolutions per minute, and the gondola and arm weigh 65 tons. Unlike most inverting rides, the Ranger uses a stomach restraint to secure passengers. A large rectangular pad is hydraulically pushed into the passengers' stomachs, keeping them pinned to the seats. Keeping the stomach firm while the restraints are being deployed is enough to prevent major discomfort during the ride. This system is unique to the Ranger and directly copied designs. The minimum rider height requirement is 48 inches. Transportable versions of this ride can be racked on two 40-foot trailers: one for the station platform, support arm, and ride arm, and the second carrying the gondola, lighting, and counterweights. The first trailer also acts as the base of the ride. Variants * Traumboot (Dream Boat) : Very similar in design, this attraction was first built at around the same time as the Ranger by WEBER Maschinenbau. The main difference between the two rides being the side profile of the gondola is flat, as opposed to the banana-shaped profile of the Ranger. Later machines were built by both HUSS and WEBER, using the name WEBER-HUSS. * Looping Starship : A very large variant built only for amusement parks by Intamin AG in the 1980s. This ride uses a drive system that is much more similar to a traditional pirate ship ride, and features and open- air gondola, rather than a caged one. It also uses over-the-shoulder restraints as well as lap-bars. * Kamikaze : A very popular design originally built by Fabbri in 1984. One of the most noticeable differences between this attraction and the original Ranger is that this ride typically features two arms rather than one, leading it to be known occasionally as a \\"Double Ranger\\". Riders also face outwards on most models, rather than inwards. Many other rides have been derived from this design, such as the Screamin' Eagle at Seabreeze Amusement Park, a floor-less model known as a Hawk, built by Zamperla.  Appearances  Despite this attractions age, there are still a number of them still operating worldwide, they include: * Colombia - At least one Ranger, Martillo at Mundo Adventura * France - At least one Ranger: A traveling model known as Ranger XXL. * India - One Ranger, at Coochbehar Rash Mela in the city of Coochbehar,West Bengal. * Italy - One Ranger, at Zoosafari Fasanolandia. * Romania - One Ranger, at Luna Park in Mamaia, outside the city of Constanta (August 2012) * Thailand - At least one Ranger, at Siam Park City  In popular culture  The Looping Star, a Ranger which operated at the Adventureland amusement park in East Farmingdale, NY for much of the 1980s, can be seen in the music video for Chaka Khan's \\"Love Of A Lifetime\\" (1986).

Formerly a college exclusively for parochial teacher education, Concordia-Chicago now offers more than 100 undergraduate and postgraduate degrees and enrolls more than 5,000 students. The university is a member of the Concordia University System, a nationwide network of colleges and universities affiliated with the Lutheran Church‚ÄìMissouri Synod (LCMS). Concordia Chicago, originally named Addison Teachers Seminary, was founded in the Lutheran tradition by Saxon German immigrants in 1864. The university continues to maintain strong ties to its faith-based heritage. History =Background= Lutheran teacher training in the United States began in Perry County, Missouri; Fort Wayne, Indiana; and Milwaukee, Wisconsin in 1839, 1846, and 1855 respectively. In 1857, the responsibility for the operation of the teachers seminary in Milwaukee was given to the denomination. Subsequently, the Milwaukee teachers seminary moved and merged operations with Fort Wayne uniting it with the theological seminary that had been founded there by followers of Johann Konrad Wilhelm L√∂he. In October 1863, the LCMS in convention voted unanimously to move the teachers seminary to Addison, Illinois, appointed the first Praeses of the institution, and instructed that a new building be constructed on land donated by a local Lutheran congregation. =Founding and Addison campus= Concordia University Chicago marks 1864 as its founding in Addison, Illinois. Originally called Addison Teachers Seminary the institution is the oldest in the Concordia University System. Construction began on a new facility, with the cornerstone laying service on June 15, 1864. During the construction period, a nearby two-story vacant tavern was rented to ensure the new teachers seminary could carry out its educational training as scheduled, beginning September 1, 1864. The original buildings in Addison are now gone, but a monument stands on the site of the seminary.Lutheran Teachers' Seminary Monument.

It is set in Georgia and later in various parts of Alabama in the mid-19th century before, during, and after the Civil War. Plot summary Jubilee is the semi- fictional story of Vyry Brown, based on the life of author Margaret Walker's great-grandmother, Margaret Duggans Ware Brown. Vyry Brown is a mixed-race slave ‚Äî the unacknowledged daughter of her master ‚Äî who is born on the Dutton plantation in Georgia. The novel follows her experiences from early childhood to adult life. The story of Vyry's life in the novel spans three major periods of American history: Slavery, the Civil War, and Reconstruction. Characters * Sis Hetta ‚Äì Vyry's mother. A slave who is regularly raped by slave owner John Dutton, she dies in the novel's opening chapter at the age of 29, when Vyry is a very small child; she has 15 children. * Caline, May Liza, and Lucy ‚Äì servants in the big house who work with Aunt Sally and Vyry. Lucy is Vyry's older half sister, by Hetta's slave husband. After being beaten and branded for running away, Lucy succeeds in escaping to freedom. *John Morris Dutton ‚Äì \\"Marse\\" or \\"Marster John,\\" owner of the Dutton Plantation. His slave mistress, Sis Hetta, is Vyry's mother. He never recognizes Vyry as his offspring and refuses to set her free by letting her marry a freedman, instead promising to set her free in his will -- a promise that never materializes. Later embarks on a political career, and dies from injuries in carriage accident. *Miss Salina ‚Äì \\"Big Missy\\", the wife of Marse John and mother of his two legitimate children. She is cruel to the slaves, particularly to Vyry, whose obvious descendance from her husband is an affront to herself and her daughter Lillian, born at the same time as Vyry. *Vyry ‚Äì Elvira Dutton, the protagonist of the novel. She is a dynamic main character. Vyry is the daughter of Sis Hetta, who dies as the novel opens, and her master, John Dutton. She is a slave, but her skin is so fair she can \\"pass\\" as white. She is a solemn, generous woman who in the course of her life acquires many skills that will be essential to her survival, while rendering service to others: she is an herborist, a cook, a seamstress and a midwife. *Aunt Sally ‚Äì a house slave on the Dutton Plantation. She is the cook and teaches Vyry her recipes. She acts as a mother to Vyry. *Grandpa Tom ‚Äì a black slave who works on the Dutton Plantation. One day he refuses to let Grimes use one of Dutton's finest horses for field work, and is whipped to death by the irate overseer. *Randall Ware ‚Äì a literate black freedman and a blacksmith. Despite being born free, his liberty is legally conditional on the support of a white \\"guardian\\". He promises to marry Vyry and buy her freedom, but Marse John won't permit it. At the onset of the Civil War he joins the Union troops, and the couple are separated. *Jim, Minna, and Harry ‚Äì Vyry's children. *Miss Lillian ‚Äì \\"the little Missy\\", the daughter of Marse John and Salina. She is about the same age as Vyry, her unacknowledged half sister, whom she strongly resembles. She and Vyry play together when they are little, but Missy Salina eventually separates them when neighbors remark on their resemblance. Unlike her mother, she is not cruel but gullible and easily manipulated. She has two children with Kevin, named Robert and Susan. *Ed Grimes ‚Äì the overseer on the Dutton Plantation. A white man of poor origin, he is little higher than the slaves on the social ladder, but works them and punishes them mercilessly, killing Grandpa Tom. When the plantation falls into ruin during the war, he joins the Confederate army and later seems to be among the Klansmen who drive Randall Ware from his smithy. *Innis Brown ‚Äì a slave freed by the war. He meets Vyry at the war's end, protects her from an attacker, and marries her legally as Randall Ware is not present. He is a caring husband, but ultimately alientates his stepson Jim by overworking him. *John Dutton Jr. ‚Äì son of John Dutton and Miss Salina. He serves in the Confederate Army, gets shot during the war and dies at home. *Brother Ezekiel ‚Äì \\"Brother Zeke\\", a black preacher who helps slaves escape in the underground railroad. A literate man, he helps Vyry and Randall Ware send letters to each other and marries the two. *Kevin McDougall ‚Äì Miss Lillian's husband. Unlike his brother-in-law John, he hates soldiers, war, and the idea of violence. *Fanny Crenshaw ‚Äì John Dutton Jr.'s childhood sweetheart. She takes care of him during his final convalescence, regretting that they were never able to marry. Setting (location) The historic novel is set in parts of Georgia and Alabama, such as: *Terrell County, Georgia ‚Äì where Vyry is born *Lee County, Georgia ‚Äì where the Dutton Plantation is *Troy, Alabama ‚Äì where the wagon breaks down and Vyry and Innis settle down and befriend the Jacobsons; Vyry and Innis' house is burned down by the KKK *Luverne, Alabama ‚Äì a very poor town that Vyry and Innis passed through *Greenville, Alabama ‚Äì where Vyry and Innis live permanently, and Vyry sells goods in the marketplace *Selma, Alabama ‚Äì where Randall Ware says he will take Jim to school Setting (time) 1835‚Äì1870 Historical events (chronological order) Before the Civil War the Bible was quoted to justify slavery as a natural and righteous state. Slaves meanwhile identified with the Old Testament Hebrew slaves who were liberated by Moses. Jubilee follows the course of the Civil War and Reconstruction, where violence by the Ku Klux Klan was unfortunately common. Specific events from this historical novel (in chronological order) include: # 1857: The South was victorious in the Dred Scott case. # March 4, 1861: Abraham Lincoln was inaugurated the sixteenth president of the United States. (184) # April 1861: Guns of Charleston, South Carolina, fired on the Federal flag at Fort Sumter. President Lincoln declared the seceded states of the Confederacy to be in a state of rebellion which must be put down if the Union was to be preserved. (195) # July 1861: The capital of the Confederacy was moved from Montgomery to Richmond. (201) # 1862: The South was winning the war. (208) (Despite Union victories at the battles of Pea Ridge and Shiloh) # July 18, 1862: 'Fighting Joe' Wheeler was named commander of the cavalry of the Army of Tennessee by General Bragg. (213) # Summer of 1863: Battle of Gettysburg with General Robert E. Lee and his Army of Northern Virginia which \\"failed in their second attempt to invade northern territory\\" (214) (Union Victory) # July 1863: Battle of Vicksburg with General Ulysses S. Grant. (Union victory) # 1863: Marked a turning of the tide in favor of the Union forces (245); word spread that Abraham Lincoln would issue an proclamation to free slaves in Union-held territories. Thousands of slaves fled plantations. The South saw a wholesale disappearance of blacks seeking the \\"protection of the Union armies\\" (246). Abraham Lincoln was seen by blacks as a new Moses. The war also evinced technological progress: Union soldiers now fought with repeating rifles and longer projectiles, while the navy began to use iron-clad gunboats instead of wooden sail ships. # February 17, 1864: To fight currency depreciation, the Confederate Congress passed Treasury Secretary Christopher Memminger's plan requiring citizens to turn in their paper currency and buy long-term war bonds. The measure failed to prevent the collapse of Confederate credit. # August 7, 1864: End of the naval battle on Mobile Bay, a Union victory # January 1, 1865: Emancipation Proclamation repeated in Georgia (Vyry and family are free) # 1868: The Ku Klux Klan rode for three days and nights during the national elections, resulting in terrible violence.

Retrieved on August 27, 2006. Its main activity is training people for ordained ministry in the Church of England and other Anglican churches. Westcott House is a founding member of the Cambridge Theological Federation. The college is considered by many to be Liberal Catholic in its tradition, but it accepts ordinands from a range of traditions in the Church of England. History Westcott House began its life in 1881 as the Cambridge Clergy Training School. Brooke Foss Westcott, the then Regius Professor of Divinity at the University of Cambridge, was its first president. He later became the Bishop of Durham. A pioneering and respected New Testament scholar himself, the school was the product of Westcott's own passionate concern to raise the standard of clergy education and to equip clergy to meet the challenges of parish ministry.Westcott House website, \\"The History of Westcott House\\", Retrieved on 13 February 2013. Westcott was also exercised by the way in which the Church of England was increasingly dominated by parties and factions. Westcott himself eschewed any party affiliation. The college has often been associated with a \\"Liberal Catholic\\" ethos, although its essential charism embraces the breadth of the Church of England and the wider church: 'As a scholar, educator, priest and prophet, Westcott's legacy to the Church of England challenges sectarianism, ignorance, complacency and empty faith. This is the spirit which Westcott House seeks to honour today, drawing students from all backgrounds to prepare them for ministry in this historic centre of Christian learning'. In response to the Faith in the City report, published in 1985, the college has retained a firm commitment to develop expertise and capacity in the field of urban ministry and mission. Through its partnership with the Diocese of Manchester, the college has pioneered patterns of context-based learning and innovative approaches to contextual theology for over twenty years. These approaches have been widely imitated and developed by other theological education institutions. The college has also developed a programme for continuing ministerial development through the Westcott Foundation. The college provides training pathways in conjunction with the University of Cambridge and the Common Awards (validated by Durham University). It describes itself as \\"the home of a diverse, inclusive and international community of people who share a vision of ministry to all society\\". Drawing on the inspiration of B. F. Westcott and others, its ethos is expressed in a rule of life which was adopted in 2014. Notable people  = List of principals = The head of Westcott House is known as the principal.

The palace dates back to the 14th century and during its history it has undergone various reconstructions, supervised by prominent architects, including Laurynas Guceviƒçius and Vasily Stasov. In 1997 the palace became the official seat of the President of Lithuania. History Presidential Palace in 1850 Backyard of the Palace Backyard of the Palace during official George W. Bush welcoming ceremony Presidential Flag on the rooftop The Palace traces its history back to the 14th century, when Jogaila, the Grand Duke of Lithuania, issued an edict donating land in the city to the Vilnius Diocese, for this reason the palace is sometimes referred to as the Bishops' Palace.Archdiocese of Vilnius Construction of the Palace took place in the late 14th century under the auspices of the first Bishop of Vilnius Andrzej Jastrzƒôbiec, and over succeeding generations, the building was gradually enlarged and renovated. During the Renaissance, the Palace was once again renovated, and parks and gardens surrounding the building were expanded. As the 18th century unfolded, a number of dramatic events in the Palace's history took place: the last Bishop of Vilnius lived in the Palace, Lithuania was annexed by the Russian Empire, and the building itself was badly damaged by two major fires in 1737 and 1748. The Palace was reconstructed in 1750 under the supervision of the architect Laurynas Guceviƒçius. After its reconstruction, the Palace was used as a residence for emperors, kings and noblemen. During 1796, Tsar Paul I lived at the Palace. During the course of the 19th century, the Palace served as a residence for several Imperial Russian governors, such as Mikhail Muravyov, nicknamed \\"The Hangman\\".Adam B. Ulam. Prophets and Conspirators in Prerevolutionary Russia. Transaction Publishers, 1998. p.8 It was also visited by the future King of France, Louis XVIII in 1804. In 1812, both the Russian Tsar Alexander I and the French Emperor Napoleon used the Palace as their residence. During Napoleon's invasion of Russia, he organized military operations and Lithuanian army units from this Palace, including five regiments of infantry, four cavalry regiments, and the National Guard of Vilnius. He received Lithuanian noblemen, newly appointed officials of the administration, and other dignitaries in this Palace as well. After Napoleon's defeat in 1812, the Palace was used for ceremonial proposes; it was here that then-general Mikhail Kutuzov was awarded Russia's highest military award ‚Äì the Order of St. George. During 1824‚Äì1834, the Palace was reconstructed by the prominent St. Petersburg architect Vasily Stasov in the Empire style, under supervision of Karol Podczaszy≈Ñski. Stasov's reconstruction of the Palace has remained to this day. After Lithuania regained its independence in 1918, the Palace housed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the ELTA news agency until it ended up in Poland in 1920. It was restored in the 1930s by Stefan Narƒôbski. After the Second World War, the Palace served as the Military Officers Centre; later it housed various Lithuanian artists. The Palace was gradually adapted for use as a presidential office, and since 1997 it has served as the official office of the President of Lithuania. Currently, adaptations are underway to expand the palace's functions to also serve as the president's official residence. A flag displaying the coat of arms of the President is hoisted when the President is present in the Palace or in the city.

As Ford had just introduced their Flathead V8, this was the logical starting point for a new Lincoln V12 line. The Lincoln-Zephyr V12 would quickly replace the previous-generation V12, just as the Lincoln-Zephyr car replaced the rest of the Lincoln line, and would be the company's primary engine through 1948. Overview Similar in design to the 90¬∞ Ford flathead V8 introduced for 1932, the Lincoln-Zephyr H Series V-12 had a narrower 75¬∞ between cylinder banks. The engine used aluminum-alloy heads and cast-steel pistons, as well as two water pumps. It also had a unique distributor with a coil assembly that actually consisted of two coils, one for each cylinder bank. Advertisement for 1937 Lincoln-Zephyr V-12Initial power output was quoted as 110 horsepower -- a little higher than the target figure -- at 3,900 rpm, a rather high power peak for those days. The torque curve was quite flat, however, with at least 180 pounds/feet available from 3,500 rpm all the way down to 400 rpm, which made for incredible top-gear performance. Though the Zephyr V-12 no more resembled previous Lincoln engines than the ubiquitous V-8 (despite sharing the latter's stroke), it was more like a \\"12-cylinder Ford\\" than a classic multi-cylinder powerplant in character. And it was not without problems. The main ones were inadequate crankcase ventilation that caused rapid sludge buildup in sustained low-rpm running, aggravated by poor oil flow, plus too-small water passages that led to overheating, bore warpage, and ring wear. To a degree, some of these maladies were dealt with during the Zephyr's first year, and Ford improved the engine by adopting hydraulic valve lifters for 1938 and cast-iron heads and oiling improvements for 1942. Yet this V-12 never shed its reputation for service troubles, though the postwar versions were actually quite reliable. The V12 was eventually replaced by the InVincible 8, simply a version of the flathead V8 found on Ford's truck line. The Zephyr V12 was also used by Allard, Atalanta, and Brough Superior in England. Allard made three V12 carsLush Tom, Allard - The Inside Story Motor Racing Publications 1977 page 206, using the Ford V8 for all other cars at that time, Brough also made only one V12 as his others were Hudson 6 or 8 powered, and Jensen made one called the HL. 267 The first Lincoln-Zephyr models of 1936 used a 267 cu. in. (4.4 L) engine which produced 110 hp (82 kW). This engine was upgraded with hydraulic lifters in 1938 and produced for one further year. 292 Lincoln Zephyr V12 engine, 292 cubic inches. The engine was enlarged for 1940 and 1941 to 292 cu. in. (4.8 L). This engine was reused from late 1946 through 1948 and was the last of the line produced. 306 A single month of 1942 production used a 306 cu. in. (5.0 L) version of the engine. This was resurrected after the war in 1946 (with 7.2:1 compression and 2-barrel {twin choke} carburetor, rated at 130 hp {97 kW})Flory, J. \\"Kelly\\", Jr. American Cars 1946-1959 (Jefferson, NC: McFarland & Coy, 2008), p.46. for a short time before reverting to 292 cu. in. for the rest of 1946 through 1948. The reason for the reversion to the smaller size was that the cylinder walls on the bored-out engine were found to be too thin. Many disappeared altogether in the block casting process at the factory causing many blocks to be scrapped before installation. Cylinder wear in the field was extreme, and re-boring during engine overhaul was impossible.

Walthall, Marion Leonard, and Gladys Egan.A Trap for Santa at silentera.com Plot Arthur Rogers (Walthall) is an unemployed, drunkard husband and father who has no money for a Christmas celebration. A title describes the situation as \\"misery and want, the family's lot.\\" Helen Rogers (Leonard), his wife, cries with their daughter over their poverty. Arthur leaves to go to the tavern. He asks the bartender (Sennett) to put an alcoholic drink on his tab, which he refuses. Two patrons buy drinks for Arthur and invite him to their table. He becomes intoxicated and returns home to a frightened wife and daughter (Egan). Arthur is described as \\"helpless, the father leaves the house of sorrow.\\" He writes a letter: \\"Dear Helen, you will be better off without me. I leave for good. May God help you. Arthur.\\" He slides the letter through the door before he departed. Helen picks up the letter to read his words. Arthur returns to the bar, where he drinks to the point of unconsciousness. The bartender literally picks him up and throws him outside. Helen and her daughter leave the house to go to an employment agency, but are turned away. They return to the house to find the son (Tansey) ate their only food: a small loaf of bread. His arm is also in an unexplained sling. An attorney stops at Helen's house to tell her of litigations that have cleared, and she is now the beneficiary of her late aunt's estate. She and the children are overjoyed. Helen is seen wearing a luxurious hat, as the attorneys direct her to her new home. It is furnished with lavish embellishments, but its only flaw is that it is without a chimney. On Christmas Eve, Helen tells the children that Santa Claus will come through the window. She drags the children to bed. They pray, and she kisses them before tucks them into bed. The children sneak out of bed to set a trap by the window. The purpose of the trap is unclear, but a logical conclusion is to make Santa trip and fall, causing a commotion, and thus witness him to prove his existence. Helen bought a Santa costume and happily considers to dress up to fool her children to believe that Santa is real. She quickly is saddened to realize that the costume should be worn by a male, namely her husband. She is unaware that her husband now makes his living as a burglar. He sees the mansion and trespasses through the window, unknowingly that it now belongs to his wife. Arthur is caught in the trap. Helen catches her husband's attempted burglary against her and their children. She is shocked, and he is ashamed. Arthur begs for her to take him back, and she agrees after a long consideration. Arthur plays Santa Claus for his children. Cast *Henry B. Walthall... Arthur Rogers. *Marion Leonard... Helen Rogers. *Gladys Egan... The Rogers' Daughter. *Kate Bruce... The Maid. *William J.

At a Campus Kitchen, students use on-campus kitchen space and donated food from their cafeterias to prepare and deliver nourishing meals to their communities. The organization is headquartered in Washington, D.C. on the campus of Gonzaga College High School. There are currently 63 Campus Kitchens, located in Saint Louis, Missouri; Evanston, Illinois; Milwaukee, Wisconsin; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Spokane, Washington; Mankato, Minnesota; Washington, D.C.; Lexington, Virginia; Winston-Salem, North Carolina; Kearney, Nebraska; Williamsburg, Virginia; Gettysburg, Pennsylvania; Baltimore, Maryland; and more (see full list of Campus Kitchens below).  Operations  * Each Campus Kitchen is hosted by a school who shares space in one dining hall's kitchen, which is termed the \\"Campus Kitchen.\\" (Usually, this space is used during less busy or off-hours for the dining hall, such as evenings and weekends.) * Students go to dining halls and cafeterias at designated times to pick up unserved, usable food. (The dining services companies who donate are protected from liability concerns under the Bill Emerson Good Samaritan Food Donation Act.) * Students prepare meals using that donated food, as well as food from local food banks, restaurants, grocery stores and farmers markets. * Then, students deliver meals free of charge to individuals and agencies in the school's neighboring community in need of food assistance. Agencies include homeless shelters, food banks, soup kitchens, and individuals or families in need of food assistance. * Student volunteers also provide empowerment-based education to clients, such as nutrition education to children, healthy cooking classes to families and culinary job training to unemployed adults.  History  The Campus Kitchens Project was developed in 2001 as a national outgrowth of DC Central Kitchen, a successful local community kitchen model in Washington DC. In 1989, Robert Egger, founder and CEO of DC Central Kitchen, pioneered the idea of recycling food from around Washington DC and using it as a tool to train unemployed adults to develop valuable work skills. DCCK became a national model, and as the idea grew, and groups around the country started to open kitchens, Robert started looking for a way to engage the thousands of underutilized school cafeterias and student volunteers in the effort, particularly in rural communities. In the mid-1990s, he piloted a job training program in 10 schools across the U.S. with the American School Food Service, with funding from the USDA. In 1999, two Wake Forest University students, Jessica Shortall and Karen Borchert, created a small student organization called Homerun that engaged students in cooking and delivering dinners to folks in the community. What started as a hobby instead became a successful campus organization. After graduating, Borchert came to work at DCCK. In 2001, the two concepts came together, and with a start-up grant from the Sodexo Foundation, The Campus Kitchens Project piloted its first program at Saint Louis University in Missouri.

He was born in Maryville, Tennessee. Career Moore attended college at Georgia Institute of Technology in 1940. During World War II, he served as a weather equipment officer for the U.S. Army Air Corps in the China-Burma-India theater, and later in occupied China. Moore returned to Georgia Tech after the war, and received a bachelor's degree in chemical engineering in 1947. Moore was recruited as a project engineer for Project Mogul in 1947 by New York University geophysicist Athelstan Spilhaus, who headed the Balloon Group within the project. Project Mogul, led by Dr. James Peoples and his assistant Albert P. Crary, made use of Moore's work in materials science allowing the construction of balloons which could better withstand cold temperatures and safely rise to significantly greater altitudes. A balloon that Moore helped launch in New Mexico on June 4, 1947, was later identified as the source of the debris found on the Foster ranch which led to UFO conspiracy theories and claims surrounding the Roswell incident. In 1953, Moore joined the Arthur D. Little Corporation and worked with Bernard Vonnegut to develop techniques for vaporizing sodium, cesium, and calcium from rockets for high-altitude studies of winds and sodium in the upper atmosphere. They collaborated on over 50 publications related to atmospheric electricity. Moore worked at the General Mills Aeronautical Research Laboratory throughout the 1950s, participating in a number of projects sponsored by the Office of Naval Research aimed at developing both military and intelligence applications for balloons, including attempts to drop anti-Soviet leaflets from balloons and the use of balloons for surveillance purposes. Moore was also known for his 1959 expedition to the stratosphere with Malcolm Ross, in which they performed the first spectrographic analysis of the planet Venus which was free of interference from the Earth's atmosphere, thereby proving the existence of water on that planet; this expedition involved an ascent to 89,000 feet (then a record for altitude). In 1969, Moore became the chairman of Langmuir Laboratory for Atmospheric Research and greatly expanded the lab's facilities. Moore was a professor of atmospheric physics at the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology in Socorro for several years, and nominally retired in 1985; however, he continued his research afterward, and his subsequent discoveries led to the first improvement in the design of the lightning rod since that device's invention by Benjamin Franklin.  Awards and honors  Moore has received a number of professional and academic honors. *New Mexico Tech, Distinguished Research Award, 1984 *American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics 1997 Lifetime Achievement Award *Royal Meteorological Society fellowship *American Meteorological Society fellowship *American Association for the Advancement of Science fellowship *American Geophysical Union fellowship References External links *TIME.com's 1959 article on Moore's Venus observation *Eos' article remembering geophysicist Charles Bachman Moore Category:American meteorologists Category:American geophysicists Category:American balloonists Category:New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology faculty Category:1920 births Category:2010 deaths Category:Fellows of the American Geophysical Union Category:American aviation record holders ","title":"Charles B.

HIE's role is to develop sustainable economic growth across the region. To achieve this it creates infrastructure for future investment, assists large and small businesses with growth aspirations and has a unique role strengthening communities, particularly in fragile areas. As part of this HIE supports communities to acquire and develop land and other assets. HIE supports the growth ambitions of business and social enterprise clients working through an account management model in order to accelerate growth in turnover, profitability, wage levels, exports and therefore gross value added (GVA) in the HIE area. HIE also invests in transformational projects across the region aiming to make the Highlands and Islands a more competitive and attractive place to live, work, study and grow. History In April 1991 HIE replaced the Highlands and Islands Development Board, a public body in Scotland responsible for distributing government grants for economic and cultural development of the Highlands that was launched on 1 November 1965. Retired diplomat Sir Andrew Gilchrist was its chairman from 1970 until 1976. A major reshaping of the organisation in 1993 saw the number of divisions reduced from seven to five. In 2008 a further major restructure occurred, with careers advice and national training programmes transferred to a new national body- Skills Development Scotland. Charlotte Wright was appointed as chief executive in June 2017, after holding the position of interim chief executive since the previous August.

They are guided in this by the Scottish Government Economic Strategy, and by the Scottish Economic Recovery Plan. HIE operates across 13 offices throughout the Highlands and Islands including 10 Area Offices, from Benbecula to Forres and Lerwick to Lochgilphead. HIE's purpose is to deliver the Scottish Government's Economic Strategy which aims to create a more successful country, with opportunities for all of Scotland to flourish, through increasing sustainable economic growth. The strategy sets five strategic objectives, for Scotland to become: *Wealthier and fairer *Smarter *Healthier *Safer and stronger *Greener The HIE Operating Plan outlines the investment priorities for its annual budget in line with the national economic strategy. The Scottish Government's skills strategy, Skills for Scotland, also informs HIE's remit. The skills strategy highlights the importance to economic growth of equipping people with skills, expertise and knowledge, and ensuring their full and productive use. While Skills Development Scotland is the leading body in this field, HIE continues to have a strong interest in aspects of skills in the region. In particular, it supports workforce development. HIE also helped to create learning infrastructure and assisted UHI Millennium Institute in becoming the University of the Highlands and Islands. HIE are now based on the new university campus at An Lochrann. The equivalent organisation for lowland Scotland is Scottish Enterprise.

He served as Texas Treasurer and mayor of Austin.  Biography  Asa Brigham was born in Marlborough, Massachusetts, on 31 August 1788 to Lewis Brigham and Mary Rice Brigham. Marriage banns for Brigham and Elizabeth Swift Babcock were published 9 Dec 1810 at Watertown, Massachusetts. He resided at Lunenburg, Massachusetts, from 1810 to 1816 and was employed as a tailor.Charles Hudson, History of the town of Marlborough, Middlesex County, Massachusetts (Boston, MA: T R Marvin & Son, 1862), p. 342. He immigrated in 1816 to Alexandria, Louisiana, after suffering a fire and loss of his business.Josiah H Temple, A Genealogical Register of Framingham Families including All Who Took Up Residence in Town Before AD 1860 (Framingham, MA: The Town of Framingham, 1887), p. 484. By the time he arrived in Texas from Louisiana in April 1830, he was married and had two sons, Samuel and Benjamin, and a married daughter, Adeliza Lewis Brigham. In December of the same year he was elected as s√≠ndico procurador in the precinct of Victoria and a year later elected comisario for the same precinct. Also in 1831, Brigham was appointed to the Brazoria district Board of Health. At the time, there was increasing discontent in Texas with the policies of the Mexican government, particularly the ban on slavery and the disarmament/expulsion of American immigrants. On June 20, 1832, Brigham joined a number of Texan politicians in signing a convention which indicated their willingness to engage in military actions to ensure the independence of Texas. On October 6 of the same year, he was elected treasurer of the Brazoria district. After 1832 he kept a ferry at Brazoria, and, in partnership with his son-in-law, ran a mercantile business. He became a stockholder in the San Saba Colonization Company and was a receiver of stock for the Brazos and Galveston Railroad. He bought land at Hall's Bayou in Brazoria County and in the counties of Galveston and Bastrop, where he grew sugar, cotton and corn in addition to raising cattle. At this time, Brigham owned a number of slaves, but later in his life, he was to sign numerous petitions against slavery. By 1833, his wife, son-in-law and one of his daughters had died. In 1835 he was elected Brazoria alcalde and was one of the four representatives of Brazoria who attended the convention at Washington-on-the-Brazos in 1836, where he signed the Texas Declaration of Independence. Since Brigham had been influential in the founding of a Masonic Lodge in Brazoria, he served as a charter member of the Masonic Grand Lodge of Texas in Houston on December 20, 1837. He was appointed auditor of the Republic of Texas by David G. Burnet and named Texas's first treasurer by President Sam Houston in December 1836. He was re-appointed as treasurer by Mirabeau B. Lamar in January 1839 but left the treasury in April the next year. He was charged with using state funds for private purposes during his time as treasurer but later cleared. He was re-appointed treasurer again in December 1841, and in 1842 became the fourth mayor of Austin. He married his second wife, Ann Johnson Mather, on July 8, 1839. Brigham died July 3, 1844, in Washington, Texas, and was buried there. Texas built a monument to him there in 1936, and his remains were later moved to Washington-on-the-Brazos State Historical Park.

Rodakowski at the Battle of Custozza. (1908. Oil on canvas, Museum of Military History, Vienna) Ludwig Koch (Vienna, 13 December 1866 - 26 November 1934) was an Austrian painter, sculptor and illustrator. Life Koch became known mainly as a horse and genre painter. He was a guest at the Spanish Riding School for many years, and recorded many of the school jumps artistically. In addition, he devoted himself to depictions of military history. He studied at the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna from 1883 to 1891 and was a pupil of Siegmund L'Allemand and August Eisenmenger. Afterwards he was noted for paintings of Austrian military history, he received the special school prize for the painting General Pappenheim in 1889. In 1891, at the Viennese annual exhibition, he displayed the painting Baptism of Fire of the Dragoon Regiment Windisch-Graetz in the Battle of Kolin. Even before 1914, Koch created portraits and uniforms of the Austro-Hungarian Army, which were often reproduced on postcards. He briefly served in the war as a war painter along the Italian front, but had to retire due to a kidney disease. Even after the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, Koch dedicated many works to the old army, but also created uniforms for the army of the First Republic.Liselotte Popelka: Vom Hurra zum Leichenfeld. Gem√§lde aus der Kriegsbildersammlung 1914-1918. Vienna, 1981, p. 10 Franz Josef I and Wilhelm II with military commanders during WWI In addition to military subjects, the main themes of his genre paintings were scenes of the Viennese and of the imperial house (e.g. oil painting Ride of the Archduke - Crown Prince Franz Ferdinand to the Maneuver at the 590th art auction of the Dorotheum Vienna, 1970). Koch published several landscape collections and was an illustrator of many hippological works. One of his most famous works, \\"The Art of Riding in the Picture\\" is especially renowned among riders. He was also a member of the so- called Siebener Club, an art association mainly composed of architects (including Josef Hoffmann, Joseph Maria Olbrich and Joseph Urban). The Croupade from the Art of Riding in the Picture (ger: Die Reitkunst im Bilde) In the 1920s Koch was invited to the United States by the U. S. Polo Association, members of which had heard him spoken of abroad as \\"the finest painter of horses in the world,\\" to come to the U. S. and make pictures of the International Polo matches. Despite the Association's attempt at promotion, Koch remained relatively unknown and eventually decided to return to Europe.Koch article in Time Magazine, 1927: https://web.archive.org/web/20070311212803/http://jcgi.pathfinder.com/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C736940%2C00.html Ludwig Koch in his studio, 1903 Ludwig Koch was buried in Vienna at the Hietzing cemetery in a dedicated grave (group 39, number 241).

It is loosely based on Mozart/da Ponte opera Cos√¨ fan tutte. Synopsis Diana (Claudia Koll) is a Roman wife happily married to sympathetic Paolo (Paolo Lanza) but she is keen on playing benign games of seduction with other men while resisting the advances of chic lingerie shop owner Silvio (Renzo Rinaldi) and she narrates her adventures to Paolo in order to stimulate their otherwise monotonous sexual life. However, under the influence of her lesbian friend Antonietta (Isabella Deiana) and raunchy sister Nadia (Ornella Marcucci), Diana starts to move the ongoings further while Paolo is still prone to believing that events narrated by her are merely fantasies. Nevertheless, when the French Sadean antiques dealer Donatien Alphonse (Franco Branciaroli) leaves marks on her body, Paolo understands that Diana is cheating on him and throws her out of the house. Diana then seeks further sexual adventures, while she and Paolo reflect on the nature of sexuality and monogamy, and their future as a couple. Reception In a retrospective review, Sight & Sound reviewed both The Key (1983) and All Ladies Do It, noting that the latter \\"shows a marked decline in narrative sophistication and wit\\" noting that the Venice setting in this film is set more in studio-based constructs than The Key. Brass' film relocates the story to Mussolini's time and changes the setting to Venice.

The aircraft crashed in Donetsk Oblast in Eastern Ukraine, near the Russian border. All 170 people on board were killed. The crash was the deadliest aviation accident in 2006. At the time it was the deadliest crash in Ukrainian modern history and the second deadliest in Ukraine SSR, after the 1979 Dniprodzerzhynsk mid-air collision. The death toll was eventually surpassed in 2014 when Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 was shot down east of where Flight 612 had crashed, also located in Donetsk Oblast, killing all 298 people on board in the deadliest single airliner shoot-down in aviation history.  Aircraft  Flight 612 was served by a Russian Tupolev Tu-154M airliner (registration: RA-85185) operated by Pulkovo Aviation Enterprise. The aircraft did not refuel in Anapa and departed on time. \\"The Pulkovo Airlines flight departed Anapa as scheduled. All necessary maintenance was performed as required before departure,\\" said Oleg Tolstyh, General Director of Anapa's Vityazevo Airport. The aircraft was manufactured in 1992 and had been in service for approximately 25,000 flight hours. It had first flown in China until Pulkovo Aviation Enterprise acquired it in 2001. The captain of the aircraft, 49-year- old Ivan Ivanovich Korogodin, had 12,312 hours of flying experience, 5,956 of which were as a pilot of a Tu-154. The first officer, 59-year-old Vladimir Vladimirovich Onishchenko, had 11,876 flight hours, including 2,200 hours on the Tu-154. 23-year-old Andrei Nikolaevich Khodnevich a trainee pilot, was also on board the aircraft and had only 189 flight hours, with 88 of them on the Tu-154. The navigator, 36-year-old Igor Yurievich Levchenko, had 7,848 hours, 5,596 of them on the Tu-154. The flight engineer, 51-year-old Viktor Petrovich Makarov, had 9,064 flight hours, including 6,701 hours on the Tu-154. Crash On Tuesday 22 August 2006, at 15:39 (Moscow Time), a Tu-154 airliner of Saint Petersburg-based Pulkovo Airlines sent an SOS signal and disappeared from radar contact. There were thunderstorms in the vicinity of the flight, and the aircraft entered an area of severe turbulence, during which its angle of attack increased to 46 degrees and its forward airspeed dropped to zero. It entered a deep stall from which the crew could not recover. It crashed north-west of Donetsk, near the village of Sukha Balka. \\"At an altitude of 11 500 metres (37,000 feet), the aircraft sent three SOS signals, dropped sharply in altitude and sent another SOS at 3000 metres (9,000 feet),\\" said Anatoli Samoshin, Vice Flight Operations Director at Pulkovo Aviation Enterprise. There were no other communications. The crash was witnessed by a local farmer and a young couple seeking shelter from the rain. They told reporters that they saw the aircraft falling out of the sky and that it burst into flames upon hitting the ground. They could see people in a number of seats that were thrown out of the aircraft on impact, but none showed any signs of life. Approximately 260 rescue personnel arrived at the scene, which was blocked off by the authorities. The field of debris and bodies was about in length. On Wednesday, Ukrainian emergency service personnel concluded their search for bodies, confirming that all 170 people on board had perished. Because of the extensive crash forces and post-accident fires, rescuers believed that it would be very difficult to identify the majority of the victims at the site. The aircraft belly-flopped into a swampy area and disintegrated on impact. The search for the black boxes, which was interrupted for the night, concluded the following morning, when both recorders were found and subsequently transported to Moscow for analysis. The Interstate Aviation Committee (IAC or MAK), after initial decoding of the flight recorder data, issued flight safety recommendations advising to avoid entering thunderstorms, to follow all maximum height limitations based on aircraft load and outside air temperature and to improve pilot training when working in these situations. The MAK final report concluded: > The cause of the crash was the aircraft being flown in manual flight mode > with excessive angles of attack causing a stall with a subsequent transition > to a flat spin and collision with the ground at high vertical speed. The > flight manual and crew training programs did not provide instruction on > manual pitch control and pitch trim during high-altitude flight. The lack of > appropriate simulators contributed to the crew‚Äôs lack of ability. While > avoiding areas of thunderstorms and turbulence, the crew allowed the > aircraft to enter pitch oscillations exceeding the angle of attack > operational range. Lack of control over speed and not following the Flight > Manual to prevent and recover from a stall and poor crew resource management > allowed the situation to escalate into a catastrophic one. Victims There were 160 passengers and 10 crew members aboard the aircraft. Among the passengers, 115 were adults and 45 were children under 12 years old. Among the adults, eight were over 60 (including a 92-year-old woman who flew with her grandson, his wife and two great-grandchildren). Earlier reports by the media and by the airline indicated that 159 passengers were on the flight, 39 children under 12 and six infants under two years of age. Some other sources reported that the plane was carrying 171 people.Bot generated title --> \\"The crew sent the May Day signal and said that the liner was carrying eleven crewmembers and 160 passengers, including 40 children.\\" Authorities could not explain this apparent discrepancy with the numbers and asked the public to wait for expert analysis to be completed. The Russian Ministry of Emergency Situations published a list of passengers travelling on Flight 612. Of 159 people, 20 were travelling to Norilsk through Saint Petersburg, and three to Murmansk. Most of the passengers were families travelling back from vacations with children. Five passengers had multiple citizenship in addition to Russian (one from the Netherlands, two from Germany, one from France and one from Finland). Memorial for the crash victims Ukraine held a national day of mourning for the people killed in the crash on Wednesday, August 23 and shifted celebration of its 15th Independence Day from August 24 to August 26. Russia held a national day of mourning on Thursday, August 24, 2006.

Smith (born April 18, 1945) is an American former politician from New York.  Biography  Smith was born on April 18, 1945, in Amherst County, Virginia, and was raised in New York City. She graduated from Baruch College in 1973. Smith entered politics as a Democrat, and was a deputy in the office of the City Clerk of New York City. She was a member of the New York State Senate from 1989 to 2006. Her district was centered in the Jamaica, Queens section of New York City. Smith was the ranking minority member of the Senate's Corporations, Authorities and Commissions Committee, and gained notoriety for several brushes with the law. She was backed by her party organization in the 2006 Democratic Senate primary election but lost to challenger Shirley Huntley, who also won the general election later that year. Smith went through over 200 high-level aides and staffers in her 18 years in the Senate, more than any other sitting Senator in New York State history. =Crimes and staff complaints= In 1996, staffer LaSone Garland-Bryan accused Smith of menacing her with a knife while they were alone in Smith's office. According to Garland-Bryan's statement, the senator became angry when she overheard Garland-Bryan telling family members that Smith \\"sometimes forgot to take her medication\\". Garland-Bryan declined to press charges, but wrote an official complaint about the incident to then-Senate Minority Leader Martin Connor, who responded by asserting that he had \\"no authority\\" to punish Smith. In 1998, New York City police arrested Smith after she allegedly became belligerent and bit an officer following a traffic stop in Brooklyn. Police were eventually forced to mace Smith and drag her from her car in order to subdue her. In 2004, Smith was arrested and cited for reckless driving after refusing to stop to present identification at a police checkpoint at a state garage in Albany. Smith attempted to accelerate through the checkpoint, almost running over a state trooper with her car in the process. Smith's actions led to a conviction; following that conviction, then-Senate Minority Leader David Paterson removed her from a leadership post. In 2004, a former Smith staffer, Wayne Mahlke, alleged that Smith had subjected him to verbally abusive comments relating to sexual orientation. The following year, the state's Division of Human Rights dismissed his claims due to insufficient evidence. Smith attacked a staffer, Jennifer Jackson, on March 21, 2006. The attack occurred in Smith's Albany office. Smith flew into a rage and threw hot coffee in Jackson's face after the staffer commented on her weight. Jackson also alleged that Smith pulled off her hairpiece, injuring her neck in the process, and threatened to kill her if she reported the incident. The senator had just returned from a Weight Watchers meeting that morning to report she had lost 4.3 pounds. According to published reports, Jackson did not intend to insult Smith; rather, she lightheartedly commented that she would have expected her boss to have shed more pounds given her constant on-the-go lifestyle. Smith's lawyer denied the charges and accused Jackson of lying to authorities, claiming that Jackson actually told the senator she needed to lose 100 pounds. Originally charged with misdemeanor battery, Smith rejected a plea offer that included anger management counseling and chose to go to trial. On August 26, 2006, Smith was convicted of misdemeanor harassment in Albany City Court.\\"State senator rejects plea deal\\". Times Union. 2006-04-27. In the aftermath of the coffee attack, then-Senate Minority Leader David Paterson stripped Smith of her state-issued car, her honorary title, and a $9,500 per year stipend attached to her leadership position. Paterson stated that the coffee attack was the latest example of what he called \\"a pattern of inappropriate, unprofessional and often abusive behavior\\" from Smith. In 2006, The New York Times reported that tabloids referred to Smith as \\"'the Wild Woman of Albany'\\".

Together with the river and with Oro√±o Boulevard, it also marks the unofficial limit of the downtown area. The avenue has two wide lanes and a narrow central reservation, usually lined with small trees and bushes. It starts near the shore of the Paran√° River and climbs towards the downtown between grassy slopes formed by elevated level sidewalks. East of this area there lies the Parque Urquiza. Upon reaching the level of the rest of the central city area, it passes by the massive building that hosts the School of Engineering of the National University of Rosario, as well as its affiliated Polit√©cnico secondary school. It then becomes a highly commercial street, hosting a large number of fine restaurants, canteens, bars, pizza parlours and icecream shops. A few blocks to the west lie the Tribunals of Rosario. Its intersection with Oro√±o Boulevard marks one of the corners of the Parque de la Independencia, which is the city's largest green area. Pellegrini is also one of Rosario's arterial roads and one of its primary accesses from the west. After crossing the whole city, it turns into the Rosario‚ÄìC√≥rdoba Highway.

The facility is located in Yekaterinburg, Russia, and is reported to employ around 16,500 people. The surrounding residential area where workers live is also called Uralmash. Uralmash () is an abbreviation of , Ural‚Äôs‚Äôkiy Mashinostroitelnyy Zavod, literally ‚ÄòUrals Machine-Building Plant.' Historically, the plant was also called , Ural‚Äôs‚Äôkiy Zavod Tyazhelogo Mashinostroyeniya, ‚ÄòUral Heavy Machinery Plant‚Äô or , UZTM, and for a time carried the honorary name of Ordzhonikidze Ural Heavy Machinery Plant, after Grigoriy Ordzhonikidze. History The Ural Heavy Machine Building Plant began operations in 1933 in compliance with the plans of the Government of the USSR for the industrialization of the country. During the pre-World War II period, Uralmash manufactured its products (blast furnace equipment, sintering machines, rolling mills, presses, cranes, etc.) for the mining and metallurgical industries located in the Urals and Siberia. The majority of these products were produced from individual designs. At the same time the plant began to develop military equipment, with the production of the F.F. Petrov designed Howitzer M-30. During World War II large-scale production of armoured materiel was organized at the plant. At first the plant manufactured armoured tank hulls, later expanding to production of T-34 tanks and the SU-122, SU-85, and SU-100 assault guns and tank destroyers based on the basic T-34 design. The self-propelled gun mounts built at Uralmash demonstrated their effectiveness on the battlefield as a successful combination of maneuverability of T-34 tanks and huge firepower of ordnance pieces. The plant also produced more than 100 SU-76i assault guns, a variant of the original Soviet SU-76 based upon the chassis and hulls of captured German Panzer III tanks and StuG III assault guns/tank destroyers, most of which fell into Soviet hands following the German defeat at the Battle of Stalingrad in early 1943. After World War II, the state made large investments in the reconstruction and expansion of the Uralmash plant. This modernisation favoured both increased output and the production of new machines and equipment‚Äîshovels, drilling rigs, crushers and mills. In the 1950s, the state began efforts to equip the aviation and rocket industries with heavy hydraulic presses. Uralmash, in response to this new demand, created a range of this type of equipment. Uralmash-manufactured dragline excavator in the Narva oil shale open pit mine in Estonia. In 1949 the plant produced the first dragline excavator. In 1960s the plant designed and manufactured draglines with booms 90‚Äì100 m long. Now more than 200 walking draglines are in operation at mines in Siberia and the Far East. One third of the total coal amount produced by the open casting is mined with the help of draglines. The drilling rigs manufactured by Uralmash were of prime importance in the development of oil and gas regions of the USSR, including West Siberia, with its severe climate. The extra deep drilling rigs designed and manufactured at the plant made it possible to reach the depth of 13 km, like at the Kola Superdeep Borehole, and to obtain for the first time rock samples approximately 3 billion years old. In addition to land-based rigs, Uralmash also designs off-shore drilling equipment. For at least part of the late 1980s and early 1990s, the plant was controlled, at least in part, by the Uralmash gang, a racketeering organization. In accordance with Russian Federation law, Uralmash was transformed in December 1992 into an open-end joint stock company under the name \\"The Ural Heavy Machine Building Plant\\". In 1996 Uralmash it became part of OMZ, one of Russia's largest engineering corporations, founded and initially led by Kakha Bendookidze. In 2005, Gazprom purchased a controlling stake in OMZ and Uralmash. In February 2007, OMZ and Metalloinvest agreed to create a common manufacturing complex. OMZ contributed its holdings in Uralmash to the joint venture while Metalloinvest contributed its holdings in ORMETO-YuUMZ. The consolidation resulted in the creation of a large machine- building conglomerate with a leading position in the CIS metallurgical equipment market with a joint market share in the metallurgical equipment segment in Russia exceeding 40%. The first director of Uralmash was A. P. Bannikov. Oleg Danchenk served as General Director since 2009. Danchenko and First Deputy and Director-General of Uralmash-Engineering Boris Belman resigned their positions at the company in March 2016. The current General Director of Uralmash is Sokolov Sergey Olegovich. Uralmesh and Indian steel manufacturer SRB International announced to be entering into a joint venture in 2016 to produce heavy equipment for the Indian steel and mining sector.

Somewhat later it was used in Saxony to designate a distinct party organized by Melanchthon's son-in-law Caspar Peucer, with George Cracovius, Johann St√∂ssel, and others, to work for a union of all the Protestant forces, as a means to which end they attempted to break down by this attitude the barriers which separated Lutherans and Calvinists. Melanchthon had won, by his eminent abilities as a teacher and his clear, scholastic formulation of doctrine, a large number of disciples among whom were included some of the most zealous Lutherans, such as Matthias Flacius and Tilemann Heshusius, afterward to be numbered among the vehement opponents of Philippism; both of whom formally and materially received the forms of doctrine shaped by Melanchthon. As long as Luther lived, the conflict with external foes and the work of building up the Evangelical Church so absorbed the Reformers that the internal differences which had already begun to show themselves were kept in the background.  Opposition to Melanchthon  Melanchthon as an old man by Lucas Cranach the Elder But no sooner was Luther dead than did the internal, as well as the external, peace of the Lutheran Church decline. It was a misfortune not only for Melanchthon but for the whole Lutheran body, that he who had formerly stood as a teacher by the side Luther, the original leader, was now forced suddenly into the position to head not only the University of Wittenberg but the entire Evangelical Church of Germany. There was among Luther's associates, notably Nikolaus von Amsdorf, a disinclination to accept Melanchthon's leadership. When, in the negotiations between German Protestants and Catholics that resulted in the Augsburg Interim and Leipzig Interim, Melanchthon showed himself ready to yield and make concessions on matters adiaphora, he ruined his position with a large part of the Evangelical theologians. An opposition party was formed in which the leadership was assumed by Flacius in view of his learning, controversial ability, and inflexible firmness. Melanchthon, on the other hand, with his faithful followers Joachim Camerarius, Georg Major, Justus Menius, Johann Pfeffinger, Paul Eber, Caspar Cruciger the Elder, Victorinus Strigel, and others saw in the self-styled genuine Lutherans nothing but a narrow and contentious class, which, ignoring the inherent teaching of Luther, sought to domineer over the church by letter and name, and in addition to assert its own ambitious self. On the other hand, the Philippists regarded themselves as the faithful guardians of learning over against the alleged \\"barbarism,\\" and as the mean between the extremes. The genuine Lutherans also claimed to be representatives of the pure doctrine, defenders of orthodoxy, and heirs of the spirit of Martin Luther. Personal, political, and ecclesiastical animosities widened the breach; such as the rivalry between the Ernestine branch of the Saxon house (now extruded from the electoral dignity) and the Albertine branch; the jealousy between the new Ernestine University of Jena and the electoral universities of Wittenberg and Leipzig, in both of which the Philippists had the majority; and the bitter personal antagonism felt at Wittenberg for Flacius, who assailed his former teachers harshly and made all reconciliation impossible.  Open conflict  The actual conflict began with the controversy over the Interim and the question of Adiaphora in 1548 and the following years. In the negotiations concerning the Leipzig Interim the Wittenberg theologians as well as Johann Pfeffinger and the intimate of Melanchthon, George of Anhalt, were on the side of Melanchthon, and thus drew upon themselves the violent opposition of the strict Lutherans, under the leadership of Flacius, who now severed his connection with Wittenberg. When the Philippist Georg Major at Wittenberg and Justus Menius at Gotha put forth the proposition that good works were necessary to salvation, or as Menius preferred to say \\"the new obedience, the new life, is necessary to salvation,\\" they were not only conscious of the danger that the doctrine of justification by faith alone would lead to antinomianism and moral laxity but they manifested a tendency to bring into account the necessary connection of justification and regeneration: namely, that justification as possession of forgiving grace by faith is indeed not conditioned by obedience; but also that the new life is presupposed by obedience and works springing out of the same justification. But neither Major nor Menius was sufficiently firm in his view to stand against the charge of denying the doctrine of justification and going over to the Roman camp, and thus they were driven back to the general proposition of justification by faith alone. The Formula of Concord closed the controversy by avoiding both extremes, but failed to offer a final solution of the question demanded by the original motive of the controversy. The synergistic controversy, breaking out about the same time, also sprang out of the ethical interest which had induced Melanchthon to enunciate the doctrine of free will in opposition to his previous predestinarianism. After the clash in 1555 between Pfeffinger (who in his Propositiones de libero arbitrio had held closely to the formula of Melanchthon) and Amsdorf and Flacius, Strigel went deeper into the matter in 1559 and insisted that grace worked upon sinful men as upon personalities, not natural objects without a will; and that in the position that there was a spontaneous cooperation of human powers released by grace there was an actual lapse into the Roman Catholic view. The suspicions now entertained against Melanchthon and his school were quickened by the renewed outbreak of the sacramentarian controversy in 1552. Joachim Westphal accused Melanchthon of agreement with John Calvin, and from this time the Philippists rested under the suspicion of Crypto-Calvinism. The more the German Lutherans entertained a dread of the invasion of Calvinism, the more they mistrusted every announcement of a formula of the Lord's Supper after the form of Luther's doctrine yet obscure. The controversy on this subject, in which Melanchthon's friend Albert Rizaeus Hardenberg of Bremen was involved with Johann Timann and then with Heshusius, leading to his deposition in 1561, elevated the doctrine of ubiquity to an essential of Lutheran teaching. The Wittenberg pronouncement on the subject prudently confined itself to Biblical expressions and forewarned itself against unnecessary disputations, which only strengthened the suspicion of unavowed sympathy with Calvin.  Lutheran strictures  The strict Lutherans sought to strike a decisive blow at Philippism. This was apparent at the Weimar meeting of 1556 and in the negotiations of Coswig and Magdeburg in this and the following years, which showed a tendency to work not so much for the reconciliation of the contending parties as for a personal humiliation of Melanchthon. He, although deeply wounded, showed great restraint in his public utterances; but his followers in Leipsic and Wittenberg paid their opponents back in their own coin. The heat of partizan feeling was displayed at the Conference of Worms in 1557, where the Flacian party did not hesitate, even in the presence of Roman Catholics, to show their enmity for Melanchthon and his followers. After several well- meant attempts at pacification on the part of the Lutheran princes, the most passionate outbreak occurred in the last year of Melanchthon's life, 1559, in connection with the \\"Weimar Confutation\\" published by , in which together with the errors of Servetus, Schwenckfeld, the Antinomians, Zwingli, and others, the principal special doctrines of the Philippists (Synergism, Majorism, see Majoristic Controversy, adiaphorism) were denounced as dangerous errors and corruptions. It led, however, to discord among the Jena theologians themselves, since Strigel defended against Flacius Melanchthon's doctrine on sin and grace, and drew upon himself very rough treatment from the impetuous duke. But the ultimate outcome was the decline of the University of Jena, the deposition of the strict Lutheran professors and the replacing of them by Philippists. It seemed for the time that the Thuringian opposition to the Philippism of Electoral Saxony was broken; but with the downfall of John Frederick and the accession of his brother John William to power, the tables were turned; the Philippists at Jena were again. displaced (1568‚Äì69) by the strict Lutherans, Johann Wigand, C√∂lestin, Kirchner, and Heshusius, and the Jena opposition to Wittenberg was once more organized, finding voice in the Bekenntnis von der Rechtfertigung und guten Werken of 1569. The Elector August was now very anxious to restore peace in the Saxon territories, and John William agreed to call a conference at Altenburg (Oct. 21, 1568), in which the principal representatives of Philippism were Paul Eber and Caspar Cruciger the younger, and of the other side Wigand, C√∂lestin, and Kirchner. It led to no result, although it continued until the following March. The Philippists asserted the Augsburg Confession of 1540, the loci of Melanchthon of the later editions, and of the Corpus Philippicum, met by the challenge from the other side that these were an attack upon the pure teaching and authority of Luther. Both sides claimed the victory, and the Leipsic and Wittenberg Philippists issued a justification of their position in the Endlicher Bericht of 1571, with which is connected the protest of the Hessian theologians in conference at Ziegenhain in 1570 against Flacian Lutheranism and in favor of Philippism.  Downfall  Pure Lutheranism was now fortified in a number of local churches by Corpora doctrin√¶ of a strict nature, and the work for concord went on more and more definitely along the lines of eliminating Melanchthonism. The Philippists, fully alarmed, attempted not only to consolidate in Electoral Saxony but to gain ascendency over the entire German Evangelical Church. They met their downfall first in Electoral Saxony. The conclusion of the Altenburg Colloquy prompted the elector, in Aug., 1569, to issue orders that all the ministers in his domains should hold to the Corpus doctrin√¶ Philippicum, intending thus to avoid Flacian exaggerations and guard the pure original doctrine of Luther and Melanchthon in the days of their union. But the Wittenberg men interpreted it as an approval of their Philippism, especially in regard to the Lord's Supper and the person of Christ. They pacified the elector, who had become uneasy, by the Consensus Dresdensis of 1571, a cleverly worded document; and when on the death of John William, in 1574, August assumed the regency in Ernestine Saxony and began to drive out not only strict Lutheran zealots like Heshusius and Wigand, but all who refused their subscription to the Consensus, the Philippists thought they were on the way to a victory which should give them all Germany. But the unquestionably Calvinist work of Joachim Cureus, Exegesis perspicua de sacra c≈ìna (1574), and a confidential letter of Johann St√∂ssel which fell into the elector's hands opened his eyes. The heads of the Philippist party were imprisoned and roughly handled, and the Torgau Confession of 1574 completed their downfall. By the adoption of the Formula of Concord their cause was ruined in all the territories which accepted it, although in some others it survived under the aspect of a modified Lutheranism, as in Nuremberg, or, as in Nassau, Hesse, Anhalt, and Bremen, where it became more or less definitely identified with Calvinism. It raised its head once more in Electoral Saxony in 1586, on the accession of Christian I., but on his death five years later it came to a sudden and bloody end with the execution of Nikolaus Krell as a victim to this unpopular revival of Calvinism.

For example, in rural areas of Britain, although English is widely spoken, the pronunciation and the grammar have historically varied. During the twentieth century, more people moved into towns and cities, standardising English. Dialect levelling can develop by the influence of various types of media.  Background  Many of the great works in English dialectology were prompted because of fears that the dialects would soon die out and of a desire to record the dialect in time. Joseph Wright began his English Dialect Dictionary by saying \\"It is quite evident from the letters daily received at the 'Workshop' that pure dialect speech is rapidly disappearing from our midst, and that in a few years it will be almost impossible to get accurate information about difficult points.\\" Harold Orton told his fieldworkers on the Survey of English Dialects that they had to work quickly in \\"a last-minute exercise to scoop out the last remaining vestige of dialect before it died out under the pressures of modern movement and communication.\\"Ellis, Stanley (1992) 40 Years On: Is Dialect Dead? In Transactions of The Yorkshire Dialect Society, Vol. XVIII, Part XCII. Dialect levelling is a linguistic phenomenon studied and observed by dialectologists and sociolinguists. There are different researcher opinions on what constitutes a dialect in this context. Chambers and Trudgill (1984) choose to view a dialect as a subdivision of a particular language such as the Parisian dialect of French and the Lancashire dialect of English. They feel that standard English is just as much a dialect as any other form of English and that it is incorrect to suppose that one language is in any way linguistically superior to another. Sociolinguists study relations between language and social groups. This includes topics such as the differences in language usage between men and women, older and younger people, and lower and higher social classes, and attitudes towards various language forms. The techniques developed by sociolinguists can be used to study the phenomenon of dialect levelling (Boves, & Gerritsen, 1995).  Development  Dialect levelling occurs mostly in socially and geographically mobile groups and in contexts where people have a tendency to adapt to their listener in order to ensure they better understand. People who come to a new town adapt their language and unconsciously leave out local language elements so that the hearer will understand them better. As a result, dialect forms that have a wide geographical and social range tend to be used more often. Eventually these short-term adaptions become long-term changes. Though most of the adjustments happen largely unconsciously, some people are more open to language change and adaptation than others and this influences the extent to which dialect levelling takes place (Kerswill, 2003; Milroy, 2002). Historical examples show that dialect levelling generally takes place anywhere and anytime in situations of extensive mobility and cultural and linguistic mixing. One historical example of dialect levelling is the change in the London dialect that took place in the fifteenth century when Northern county immigrants moved to London. Their dialect diffused into southern forms and some elements were incorporated into standard English (Milroy, 2002). Dialect levelling has become a widespread phenomenon in Britain. Southern features seem to be spreading throughout the whole country and typical vowel sounds seem to be centred on big cities like Glasgow, Manchester, or Newcastle (Kerswill, 2001). Due to an increase in mobility, migration, and the media, who portray variety in language as something positive, dialect levelling seems to take place more quickly than before (Kerswill, 2003).  Cases  The following are the results of several research projects with a focus on dialect levelling. They enhance our knowledge of the dialect levelling that is taking place today in Great Britain. There has been research on the phenomenon of dialect leveling in Hull, Milton Keynes, and Reading (Williams, & Kerswill, 1999): *The survey of British Dialect Grammar in the metropolitan regions of Blackburn, Birmingham, Cardiff, Nottingham, Glasgow, London, Liverpool, Manchester, Newcastle, Preston, Sheffield, Teesside, Coventry, Swansea, Brighton, Leeds, and Bristol (Cheshire, Edwards, & Whittle, 1989). The major urban centres of Britain have certain grammatical features in common in their spoken English and so we could say that a ‚Äòstandardising‚Äô non-standard variety of English is developing. *Social network and class culture as independent influences on language change (Kerswill & Williams, 2000) In Milton Keynes, a new phenomenon has been investigated in linguistics research. A large group of working-class people have moved to Milton Keynes, away from their home town and kin, in the hope of finding better housing. Unlike traditional working- class communities, they do not form close-knit networks and tend to keep themselves to themselves. This type of network is common with migrants everywhere. For some features, especially vowels, the levelling leans towards the Received Pronunciation norm. For other features, especially consonants, the levelling leans more towards a general, southern, non-standard norm. Strong class awareness amongst youngsters and strong prejudice against 'posh' people explain why standard English and Received Pronunciation are not fully adopted. For the working class of Milton Keynes, it is a priority to establish a distinction between them and the upper class. This indicates that mobility and social class appear to be two separate influences that do not necessarily go hand in hand.  Examples  The following are examples of new language features that are currently spreading throughout Britain. They are slowly taking the place of typical regional features. Estuary English has been added as an example of modern-day dialect levelling because it is the well known result of dialect levelling that has been taking place on the Thames Estuary over the past twenty years. [Œ∏]-fronting in Britain. This is when the -th- is pronounced as [f] or [v]‚Äù (Kerswill, 2003). The following are the 13 most reported dialect features in the metropolitan regions of Blackburn, Birmingham, Cardiff, Nottingham, Glasgow, London, Liverpool, Manchester, Newcastle, Preston, Sheffield, Teesside, Coventry, Swansea, Brighton, Leeds, and Bristol, according to The Survey of British Dialect Grammar. *Them as demonstrative determiner (Look at them big spiders), *Should of (You should of left half an hour ago), *Absence of plural marking (To make a big cake you need two pound of flour), *What as subject relative pronoun (The film what was on last night was good), *Never as past tense negator (No, I never broke that), *There was with plural 'notional' subject (There was some singers here a minute ago), *There's with plural 'notional' subject (There's cars outside the church), *Perfect participle sat following BE auxiliary (She was sat over there looking at her car), *Adverbial quick (I like pasta. It cooks really quick), *Ain't/in't (that ain't working/ that in't working), *Give me it (give me it, please), *Perfect participle stood following BE auxiliary (And he was stood in the corner looking at it), *Non-standard was (we was singing) (Cheshire, Edwards, & Whittle, 1989) Estuary English is a new English variation found on the Thames Estuary. It is situated somewhere in the middle between popular London speech and Received Pronunciation. People arrive at it from above and from below. As people climb the social ladder they tend to correct their speech. They get rid of grammatically nonstandard features such as double negatives, the word ain't and past tense forms such as writ for wrote and come for came. They also adapt their accent, for example pronouncing the instead of dropping it, replacing the glottal stops with [t] as in water, and changing some vowels. Some claim that Estuary English is becoming the new standard, replacing Received Pronunciation, and that Received Pronunciation speakers are adopting it themselves (Kerswill, 2001; Milroy, 2002).  Influences  ;Migration within a country Over the past forty years people have moved out of the cities and into dormitory towns and suburbs. In addition thirty-five new towns, such as Milton Keynes were created across the country (Kerswill, 2001). Industrialisation often causes an increase in work opportunities in a certain area causing people to move and evoking a general willingness to adopt certain language features that are typical for this area (Milroy, 2002). In general first-generation adult migrants only show slight language changes, whereas their children produce a more homogeneous language. When these children become teenagers, they often feel pressured to conform to the language of their peer group and thus a new levelled language variety starts to emerge (Williams, & Kerswill, 1999). ;Lateral (geographical) mobility Modern transportation has made travel easier and more efficient. This results in people travelling larger distances to work and meeting people from different areas at work, which in turn exposes them to different dialects and encourages dialect levelling. It causes employers to expect that employees are flexible and willing to work at different locations or to change locations throughout their career. It produces language missionaries or people that move away from their native area for a period of time and then return, bringing with them some traces of a foreign dialect and it results in the fact that parents nowadays do not come from the same community, causing dialect levelling to take place within the family (Williams, & Kerswill, 1999). ;Vertical social mobility When people are promoted they often feel the need to adapt their language so that a wider group of people will understand them more clearly. They often leave out typical regional varieties and use more widely known varieties instead. Schools realise the need for a common language variety and encourage pupils to adopt Standard English (Williams, & Kerswill, 1999). ;People approach new language forms positively Popular media such as TV and radio stations broadcast mostly from London and the south, causing traces of southern accents to be found in the north. Nowadays however, one finds a generally positive attitude towards different language forms as Non-Received Pronunciation English can be heard on every radio and television station. BBC newsreaders still form an exception in this respect, though even there Welsh and Scottish accents seem to be accepted. This positive attitude towards different varieties of English seems to catch on with the general public (Kerswill, 2001)(Williams, & Kerswill, 1999). ;Women are generally more open to new language varieties Several studies show that women adopt widely used language features more easily than men. The language of women tends to be more neutral and shows less regional varieties, though their language does not necessarily come closer to Received Pronunciation. Dialect levelling often starts with women but quickly spreads to the rest of the family (Kerswill, 2003). ;Speakers want to maintain a unique dialect that distinguishes them from others. In some cases more than others, linguistic distinctiveness seems to be a sociolinguistic priority. When having a conversation with someone of a different dialect community, some people like to emphasise their own dialect (Kerswill, & Williams 2000)(Milroy, 2002). Amongst youngsters of all classes there is often a strong class awareness. Working-class teenagers for example, are known to make strong statements against 'posh' people. These class-based norms influence a person's willingness to adopt standard English and Received Pronunciation and their dislike for different language varieties (Kerswill, & Williams 2000). ;Natural factors Not all language changes are caused by external influences. Sometimes language changes through the course of time. One example of such a change is [Œ∏]-fronting (Kerswill, 2003).  Related items  * Geographical diffusion Over the larger area of Great Britain, geographical diffusion tends to take place as opposed to dialect levelling. In this case specific language features spread out from a densely populated, economical and culturally dominant centre. Where dialect levelling takes place locally, geographical diffusion covers large areas (Kerswill, 2003). * Social dialect (sociolect) The Survey of British Dialect Grammar suggests the term social dialect as opposed to regional dialect because the dialect a person uses seems to be more closely related to a person's social activities and relationships with other people than to the place where a person resides (Cheshire, Edwards, & Whittle, 1989). * Koin√©isation Koin√©isation is the process by which speakers create a new language variety based on the dialects of the speakers with whom they have come into contact (Milroy, 2002). * Standardisation of language The formalisation of a language variety with the intervention of an institution (Milroy, 2002).

As a professor of history at Harvard University for over 50 years, he directed 80 PhD dissertations and helped promote social and ethnic history, virtually inventing the field of immigration history in the 1950s. Handlin won the 1952 Pulitzer Prize for History for The Uprooted (1951). Handlin's 1965 testimony before Congress was said to \\"have played an important role\\" in passage of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 that abolished the discriminatory immigration quota system in the U.S.\\"Oscar Handlin, Historian Who Chronicled U.S. Immigration, Dies at 95,\\" New York Times, 9/23/2011 Biography Handlin was born in Brooklyn, New York, on September 29, 1915, the eldest of three children of Russian-Jewish immigrants. His mother, the former Ida Yanowitz, came to the United States in 1904 and worked in the garment industry. His father, Joseph, immigrated in 1913 after attending a commercial college in Ukraine and being stationed in Harbin, China, as a soldier during the Russo-Japanese War. Handlin's parents were passionately devoted to literature and the life of the mind. Their experience of religious persecution in Czarist Russia made them fiercely devoted to democracy and social justice (Handlin was a proto-\\"red diaper baby.\\") The couple owned a grocery store, the success of which along with real estate investments enabled them to send their children, Oscar, Nathan, and Sarah, to Harvard. Known for his prodigious memory that allowed him to attend classes without taking notes, in 1930, Handlin entered Brooklyn College at age 15, graduating in 1934, then earning a M.A. from Harvard University in 1935, after which he won a Frederick Sheldon Fellowship for research in Europe. \\"I don't know why, Dr. Handlin joked in a 1952 Boston Globe interview. \\"I guess they just liked my face. Traveling in England, Ireland, Italy, and France, he began assembling material that would become his first book Boston's Immigrants, 1790-1865 (1941).www.boston.com obituaries Sept. 22, 2011 Between 1936 and 1938, Handlin taught history at Brooklyn College before reentering Harvard University. According to Handlin, it was Arthur M. Schlesinger, Sr. who \\"directed my attention to the subjects of social history that have since occupied much of my attention,\\" urging Handlin to write his dissertation on immigration to Boston in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. In 1940 he received his PhD, joining the faculty in 1939 and remaining until 1986, his work centering around the topic of immigrants in the U.S. and their influence on culture. During his time as a graduate student at Harvard, Handlin was denied the position of vice president in the Henry Adams Club for being Jewish. He was among the first Jewish scholars appointed to a full professorship at Harvard. He also taught at the Harvard Extension School. A man of few words outside the lecture room, Handlin made every word count. He was possessed of a sardonic wit honed by his love of the novels of James Branch Cabell, the operettas of Gilbert & Sullivan, and the cartoons of Al Capp, who was a family friend.Personal conversations with Sarah Handlin Milner, Oscar's sister. He died at age 95 on September 20, 2011, in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Despite being a staunch anti-Communist and Vietnam War hawk, he was honored by both leftist and rightist academics. Administrator Handlin was very active as a scholarly organizer and administrator. In the Harvard history department he helped create the Center for the Study of the History of Liberty in America, and directed it 1958-67; he also chaired the Charles Warren Center for Studies in American History from 1965 to 1973. From 1962 to 1966 he was a top official of the United States Board of Foreign Scholarships, which gives out Fulbright scholarships. He served on the board of overseers of Brandeis University, and was a trustee of the New York Public Library. He was Harvard's head librarian from 1979 to 1984 and acting director of the Harvard University Press in 1972.Mark Feeney, \\"Oscar Handlin; historian led US immigration study,\\" Boston Globe September 22, 2011 In 1972-3 Handlin was the Harold Vyvyan Harmsworth Professor of American History at Oxford University. Positions =Immigration= Among Handlin's many important contributions was his pioneering work on immigration to America. In his Pulitzer Prize‚Äìwinning book The Uprooted (1951), he opens with the famous declaration: \\"Once I thought to write a history of the immigrants in America. Then I discovered that the immigrants were American history.\\"Handlin, The Uprooted: The Epic story of the Great Migrations that made the American people, p. 3. In the process, Handlin laid the ground for study of immigration by the succeeding generation of historians, even though many of them would dispute his immigrant archetype of a peasant guided primarily by religious conviction, having no familiarity with wage work or urban settings, and having experienced migration first and foremost as alienation from family, community, and tradition.Vecoli, \\"Contadini in Chicago\\" Handlin was one of the most prolific and influential American historians of the 20th century. As an American historian and educator he was noted for his in depth examination of American immigration history, ethnic history, and social history. His dissertation (1941) was published as his first book Boston's Immigrants, 1790-1865: A Study in Acculturation (1941). The book was highly regarded for its innovative research on sociological concepts and census data. In 1941 it won the prestigious John H. Dunning Prize from the American Historical Association as outstanding historical work published by a young scholar. The American Journal of Sociology described it as \\"the first historical case study of the impact of immigrants upon a particular society and the adjustment of the immigrants to that society. The writer has opened a new field for historical research and has also made a significant contribution to the literature of race and culture contacts.\\"Back cover copy of the Belknap Edition of Boston's Immigrants In 1947, he and his first wife Mary Flugg Handlin published Commonwealth: A Study of the Role of Government in the American Economy: Massachusetts, 1774-1861, which revealed for the first time the importance of political action in the development of the U.S. free enterprise system. By the late 1950s, Oscar Handlin was publishing a book nearly every year, covering the fields of civil rights, liberty, ethnicity, urban history, the history of education, foreign affairs, migration, biography, adolescence, even a book of poetry. Sometimes he wrote collaboratively with his first wife Mary Flug Handlin and, after her 1976 death, with his 2nd wife Lilian Bombach Handlin, whom he married in 1977. In the 1960s, Handlin published 11 books, wrote a monthly column for the Atlantic Monthly, directed the Center for the Study of Liberty in America, helped manage a commercial television station in Boston, chaired a board that oversaw Fulbright Scholarship awards, all in addition to his teaching duties at Harvard. From 1979 to 1983 he was director of the Harvard University Library. He also edited a 42-volume collection of books on subjects relating to immigration and ethnicity, The American Immigration Collection (1969). During the next three decades, Handlin published 12 more books, many on the subject of liberty, and edited at least 20 biographies. He continued his work with immigrants with From the Outer World (1997), which collected the travel accounts of visitors to the United States from non-European countries. \\"He reoriented the whole picture of the American story from the view that America was built on the spirit of the Wild West, to the idea that we are a nation of immigrants.\\" (James Grossman) =American slavery= Oscar Handlin argued that racism was a by-product of slavery, and that the main focus was on the fact that slaves, like indentured servants, were regarded as inferior because of their status, not necessarily because of their race.\\"American Slavery\\", Peter Kolchin =Civil Rights Movement= In 1964, Handlin published Fire Bell in the Night: The Crisis in Civil Rights, which criticized white supremacists and suburban liberals, but also criticized leftists for their Communist-inspired solutions such as quotas, school busing, and affirmative action, writing: \\"Preferential treatment demands a departure from the ideal which judges individuals by their own merits rather than by their affiliations.\\" =Left and Right= In March 1961, Handlin signed an ACLU-organized petition of scholars demanding that the House Committee on Un-American Activities (HUAC) cease operations.\\"250 Teachers Hit House Committee,\\" New York Times, March 20, 1961. In 1961, Handlin published The Distortion of America, his critique of the attractions of Communism. The 1996 2nd ed. covers Yugoslavia, China, and Arthur Koestler. \\"The study of the human past persuades me that, despite the frequent risks of failure, man has the capacity to make order and find purpose in the world in which he lives when he uses the power of his reason to do so.\\" His long-time colleague Bernard Bailyn noted Handlin's commitment to providing a historical perspective on policy issues:Bailyn, 2013, p 246 :He published widely on all the major public issues of the time: racism, group life, anti- Semitism, prejudice, the Bill of Rights, the business corporation, ethnicity, and the Jews and other groups in American society. He was liberal in social controversies, especially those related to immigration, race, social justice, and equal opportunity. In the Vietnam era, however, shocked by what he took to be the naive views of the left-leaning professoriate, he turned to the right and became deeply conservative in his politics. In 1979, Handlin published Truth in History, which criticized New Left historians and the corruption of American universities with faddishness, hiring quotas, overspecialization and fragmentation in history studies, and deficiencies in graduate training. =The Vietnam War= In December 1967, Handlin was one of 14 anti-Communist American scholars who co-wrote a report for the Freedom House Public Affairs Institute, which argued that disaster would strike if the U.S. withdrew from Vietnam. In 1988, Handlin, John Silber et al. founded the conservative National Association of Scholars.

Currently, he is Professor of Breast Medical Oncology, and Professor of Molecular and Cellular Oncology at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas. Previously, he was Scientific Director and Vice Chairman of Oncology at the Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center of Georgetown University. Jordan was the first to discover the breast cancer prevention properties of tamoxifen and the scientific principles for adjuvant therapy with antihormones. More recently his work has branched out into the prevention of multiple diseases in women with the discovery of the drug group, selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERMs). Currently, he plans to develop a new Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) for post-menopausal women that prevents breast cancer and does not increase the risk of breast cancer. Jordan's paper The Effect of Raloxifene on Risk of Breast Cancer in Postmenopausal Women: Results from the More Randomized Trial was one of the top 20 most cited papers in breast cancer research during 2003 and 2004.Essential Science Indicators - Special Topics, Breast Cancer, Top 20 Papers in last two year period. Retrieved August 22, 2006.  Early life  Born in New Braunfels, Texas, US, Jordan moved to England with his family as a child. He went to school at Moseley Hall Grammar School in Cheshire before attending the University of Leeds where he received BSc, PhD and DSc degrees in Pharmacology.  Research career  Jordan began working on the structure-activity of anti-estrogens as part of his PhD program at Leeds University. During that time, he met Arthur Walpole, the patent holder for the drug that became tamoxifen. In September 1972, Jordan became a Visiting Scientist at the Worcester Foundation for Experimental Biology, Massachusetts. While there he began researching the idea that tamoxifen, a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM), could block estrogen receptors in breast tumors. Estrogen receptors in breast tumors attract estrogen which is then absorbed into the cancerous cell and encourages the cell to divide, causing the cancer to grow. Until this time, the treatment for this type of breast cancer was oophorectomy. Jordan returned to Leeds University as a Lecturer in Pharmacology between 1974 and 1979, after which he spent one year at Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research at the University of Bern, Switzerland. In 1980, Jordan joined the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison where he started to look at the effects of tamoxifen and another SERM, raloxifene, on bone density and coronary systems. This was needed because of the concern that long term use of SERMs could lead to osteoporosis and heart disease. Jordan's research showed that post-menopausal women who took these drugs did not suffer from a lowering of bone density or an increase in blood cholesterol. Raloxifene is now used in the prevention of osteoporosis. Jordan gained a full Professorship at Wisconsin in 1985, the same year his alma mater awarded him a DSc. In 1993, Jordan became Professor of Cancer Pharmacology at Northwestern University Medical School in Chicago, IL., and director of the Breast Cancer Research Program at the Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center of Northwestern University. He was the inaugural holder of the Diana Princess of Wales Professor of Cancer Research (1999‚Äì2004). In January 2005, Jordan was the inaugural Alfred G. Knudson Chair of Cancer Research at the Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia, PA. He has recently published work showing that estrogen, given at the right time, causes the destruction of cancer cells rather than feeding their growth. Jordan was the Scientific Director of the Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center, Professor of Oncology and Pharmacology, Vice Chair of the Department of Oncology, and the Vincent T. Lombardi Chair of Translational Cancer Research, Georgetown University, Washington, D.C., prior to moving to Texas. Jordan was appointed Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG) in the 2019 Birthday Honours for services to women's health.

The Philippi Covered Bridge, on the Tygart Valley River, is the main local landmark and historical icon of Philippi, West Virginia, USA. The celebrated bridge was commissioned by the General Assembly of Virginia and constructed in 1852 by Lemuel Chenoweth, a well-known Appalachian bridge builder, to provide a link on an important segment of the vital Beverly-Fairmont Turnpike between Beverly (Chenoweth's hometown) and Fairmont. The bridge has strong associations with the American Civil War, especially the Battle of Philippi (1861). The Philippi Covered Bridge is the oldest and longest covered bridge in West Virginia and one of only two remaining in Barbour County. It is also the only covered bridge serving the US Federal Highway system (U.S. Route 250). It was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972. History =Bidding, design and construction= The circumstances of the bidding on the contract for the bridges in western Virginia are given by Hu Maxwell: > Bidders were present [at Richmond] in large numbers from the East and the > North, with all sorts of models and plans, including iron structures, wire > cables, cantilevers, stone arches, and wooden bridges of many kinds. Mr. > Chenoweth was there with his model made of hickory wood, as strong as it > could possibly be made, not to exceed the required size. So far as > appearances went, some of the New England Yankees had models of perfect form > and beauty, painted and enameled in the highest art. On the appointed day, > the bidders all assembled before the Board of Public Works, and each showed > his model, and set forth his claims of what weight his bridge would sustain. > Mr. Chenoweth was one of the last called forward to show what he had. His > plain wooden model did not attract much attention; but he created > consternation among the other bidders when he placed his model on two > chairs, one end resting on each, and then stood on his little bridge, and > called on the other architects to put theirs to the test by doing the same. > Not one would do it, for they knew their models would be crushed. If the > Philippi bridge were as strong in proportion to its size as Mr. Chenoweth's > model, it would sustain the weight of a man six hundred feet high. The test > decided the contest, and Mr Chenoweth was given the contract for the > bridges. The structure is 285¬Ω feet (originally 312 feet) long and wide and was originally supported by three massive sandstone piers constructed by Emmett J. O'Brien. The bridge design incorporates the \\"Long\\" Burr Arch Truss and was built for $12,180.68. It is one of few surviving \\"double-barreled\\" (two lane) covered bridges in the United States. =Civil War= The bridge was used on 3 June 1861 by both Union and Confederate troops after the Battle of Philippi, by some reckonings the first land battle of the American Civil War. The bridge was the first to be captured in the war by either side and was used for a time as a barracks by the victorious Union troops. The bridge narrowly escaped burning in April and May 1863 at the time of the Confederate raids on the B&O; Railroad west of Cumberland, Maryland. Orders were issued by General William E. Jones for the burning of it and of the covered bridge at Rowlesburg, but the intercession of several locals of Southern sympathies (especially Elder Joshua S. Corder) saved both. =Structural modifications= The bridge has undergone a number of renovations after being severely damaged at least seven times over the years. In 1934, increased motorized traffic mandated the addition of two concrete piers to the bridge's substructure (for a total of five) along with a new steel reinforced concrete deck (to replace the old wooden one) and an external walkway to better accommodate pedestrian traffic. The bridge was damaged by a severe flood on 4‚Äì5 November 1985 and was virtually destroyed by fire on 2 February 1989. A gasoline tanker truck refilling underground tanks at a nearby filling station overfilled a tank, spilling gasoline which ran down into the bridge. A car passing through the bridge then sparked a fire when its exhaust system backfired. The bridge was then closed to traffic until a $1.4 million reconstruction was completed and the bridge reopened on 16 September 1991. The reconstruction, under the direction of the bridge historian and West Virginia University professor Emory Kemp, included replacing the damaged yellow poplar supports. Care was taken to restore the exterior to its original appearance: the rounded double arch entrances were restored, red-painted shingles (also of poplar) were affixed to the roof and new external wooden siding was replaced in a horizontal orientation. Today, the original, burnt wooden trusses and supports can still be seen when driving through the bridge. Folklore *A local legend once asserted that US President Abraham Lincoln and Confederate President Jefferson Davis were witnessed by a small boy meeting secretly in the bridge late in the course of the American Civil War to discuss peace terms.

Born in Germain-de-Bourgeuil, Indre-et-Loire, he was the third child in a family of merchants. In 1811 Antoine Brutus Menier was enrolled in the La Fl√®che Military Academy where he studied the composition of pharmaceuticals. The following year the 17-year-old served with the medical staff of La Grande Arm√©e in Napoleon's invasion of Russia. In 1813 he was employed at Val-de- Gr√¢ce military hospital in Paris. In 1816, Antoine Brutus Menier married Marie-Edm√©e Virginie Pichon. With her sizeable dowry he was able to go into business and he established the Menier Hardware Company in the Marais district of Paris. Although not certified as a pharmacist, Menier began preparing and selling a variety of powders for medicinal purposes. This aspect of the business grew rapidly and in 1825 he began an expansion through the acquisition of a second production facility on land on the banks of the Marne River at Noisiel, then a small village of less than 200 inhabitants at the outskirts of Paris. Chocolate was used as a medicinal product and was only one part of the overall business. Success led to a modernization of the Noisel facility in 1830 that made it the first factory in France to have a mechanized mass production process for chocolate. By 1832 Menier's company offered a wide range of medicinal powders and began publishing a catalog detailing its product line. Following the development of solid chocolate, Menier introduced a block of chocolate wrapped in decorative yellow paper. Antoine Brutus Menier's success earned him considerable recognition throughout France but soon brought with it criticism for his lack of certification as a pharmacist. However, his skills were such that in 1839 he passed the necessary exams and received his diploma. For his contribution to the growth of the economy of France, in 1842 the government awarded him the Legion of Honor. In the spring of 1853 Antoine Brutus Menier suffered a stroke that left him paralysed and management of the business was assumed by his son Emile-Justin Menier in a year that saw the company produce more than 4,000 tons of chocolate. Antoine Brutus Menier died in December at his home in Passy. He was buried in the P√®re Lachaise Cemetery in Paris.

Its continuation in Tennessee, also numbered State Route 70, continues south to the North Carolina state line at North Carolina Highway 208. Route description View south at the north end of SR 70 at US 58 in Jonesville SR 70 begins at the Tennessee state line in the valley formed by Blackwater Creek. It follows that creek past Blackwater, but soon leaves it to ascend Powell Mountain, which it crosses at Hunter Gap. SR 70 comes down off that mountain and then rises again, crossing Wallen Ridge before descending again and crossing the Powell River on Sewell Bridge. From there it heads north across a relatively flat area, ending at US 58 in the eastern part of Jonesville. History The road from Jonesville south via Blackwater to Tennessee was part of the Trail of the Lonesome Pine, an auto trail from Detroit to Florida. In 1924, a group of citizens from far western Virginia appeared before the State Highway Commission, asking them to take it over as a state highway. A member of the Tennessee Legislature stated that be was sure that it would be designated a state highway in Tennessee if Virginia took over their part. The northernmost two miles (3 km) were added later in 1924 as SR 1010, and a further 8 miles (13 km) were added in 1927. SR 1010 was renumbered to SR 103 in the 1928 renumbering, and the final 3.5-mile (5.5 km) piece from Blackwater to Tennessee was added that year. In the 1933 renumbering, SR 103 south of Jonesville was combined with the remaining piece of SR 11, which ran from Jonesville northeast to Lebanon along present U.S. Route 58 Alternate (and its old alignments) and SR 71, to form State Route 64. (SR 11 had continued to Bluefield, West Virginia along US 19.)Virginia Highways Project: VA 64 In late 1940, most of SR 64 was renumbered as SR 70, running from Tennessee to St. Paul, to match Tennessee's SR 70. North of St. Paul, SR 64 replaced the former SR 70 (now SR 63), while SR 64 remained on its old alignment from St. Paul southeast to Dickensonville, and switched places with SR 71 to end at Hansonville. Additionally, while SR 64 had gone from Pennington Gap towards Big Stone Gap via Woodway, the new SR 70 replaced SR 66 via Dryden; the old SR 64 from Woodway towards Big Stone Gap became SR 65. US 58 Alt. was formed in the early 1950s, and replaced all of SR 70 east of Jonesville, truncating it to its current length.Virginia Highways Project: US 58 ALT In 1954, SR 70 became a secondary route, SR 798, over objections. It was added back to the primary system in 1962, after being reconstructed, including the building of a new bridge over the Powell River.

The Nativity of John the Baptist is a high-ranking liturgical feast, kept in the Roman Catholic, Anglican, Eastern Orthodox and Lutheran churches. The sole biblical account of the birth of John the Baptist comes from the Gospel of Luke. Significance Nativity of Saint John the Baptist, Zechariah writing, \\"His name is John\\". Pontormo, on a desco da parto, c. 1526. Christians have long interpreted the life of John the Baptist as a preparation for the coming of Jesus Christ, and the circumstances of his birth, as recorded in the New Testament, are miraculous. John's pivotal place in the gospel is seen in the emphasis Luke gives to the announcement of his birth and the event itself, both set in prominent parallel to the same occurrences in the life of Jesus.Foley OFM, Leonard, \\"Solemnity of the Birth of John the Baptist\\", Saint of the Day: Lives, Lessons and Feasts, revised by Pat McCloskey OFM, Franciscan Media The sole biblical account of the birth of John the Baptist comes from the Gospel of Luke. John's parents, Zechariah or Zachary ‚Äî a Jewish priest ‚Äî and Elizabeth, were without children and both were beyond the age of child-bearing. During Zechariah's rotation to serve in the Temple in Jerusalem, he was chosen by lot to offer incense at the Golden Altar in the Holy Place. The Archangel Gabriel appeared to him and announced that he and his wife would give birth to a child, and that they should name him John, a name which was unfamiliar in Zechariah and Elizabeth's families. refers to a \\"John\\" (or \\"Jonathan\\", a name combining \\"John\\" with \\"Nathan\\" such that the \\"n\\" at the end of \\"John\\" is also used as the first \\"n\\" in \\"Nathan\\") among the high priests who challenged the apostles' preaching after Pentecost, so the name was not unknown within the wider priestly family.Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges on Luke 1, accessed 17 May 2018 However, because Zechariah did not believe the message of Gabriel, he was rendered speechless until the time of John's birth.Nativity of the Holy Glorious Prophet At that time, his relatives wanted to name the child after his father, and Zechariah wrote, \\"His name is John\\", whereupon he recovered his ability to speak (; ). Following Zechariah's obedience to the command of God, he was given the gift of prophecy, and foretold the future ministry of Jesus this prophecy forming the text of the Benedictus canticle. Liturgical celebrations Desco da parto with the birth given a contemporary setting, Siena, c. 1420‚Äì40 Tornabuoni Chapel by Domenico Ghirlandaio and workshop, 1485‚Äì1490 At the Annunciation, when the angel Gabriel appeared to the Virgin Mary to inform her that she would conceive of the Holy Ghost, he also informed her that Elizabeth, her cousin, was already six months pregnant (). Mary then journeyed to visit Elizabeth. Luke's Gospel recounts that the baby \\"leapt\\" in Elizabeth's womb at the greeting of Mary ().Butler, Alban. Lives of the Saints The Nativity of John the Baptist on June 24 comes three months after the celebration on March 25 of the Annunciation, when the angel Gabriel told Mary that her cousin Elizabeth was in her sixth month of pregnancy, and six months before the Christmas celebration of the birth of Jesus. The purpose of these festivals is not to celebrate the exact dates of these events, but simply to commemorate them in an interlinking way. The Nativity of John the Baptist anticipates the feast of Christmas. The Nativity of John the Baptist is one of the oldest festivals of the Christian church, being listed by the Council of Agde in 506 as one of that region's principal festivals, where it was a day of rest and, like Christmas, was celebrated with three Masses: a vigil, at dawn, and at midday. It is one of the patronal feasts of the Order of Malta. =In Western Christianity= Ordinarily, the day of a saint's death is usually celebrated as his or her feast day, because it marks his or her dies natalis, or \\"birthday\\", into eternal life. To this rule there are two notable exceptions: the birthday of the Blessed Virgin Mary and that of John the Baptist. According to Roman Catholic tradition and teaching, Mary was free from original sin from the first moment of her existence (her conception itself is commemorated by a separate feast), while John was cleansed of original sin in the womb of his mother (which is not taught in other Western Christian traditions).Souvay, Charles. \\"John the Baptist.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 8. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1910. 8 Aug. 2014 The Nativity of John the Baptist, though not a widespread public holiday outside of Quebec and Puerto Rico, is a high-ranking liturgical feast, kept in the Roman Catholic, Anglican and Lutheran churches. Since in the Roman Rite it is celebrated since 1970 as a solemnity, in the 1962 form of that liturgical rite as a feast of the first class and in still earlier forms as a Double of the First Class with common Octave, it takes precedence over a Sunday on which it happens to fall. The Reformed and free churches give this celebration less prominence. Like the Birth of the Virgin, the subject is often shown in art, especially from Florence, whose patron saint John is. It was often given a prosperous contemporary setting, and often only the presence of a halo or two distinguishes it on a desco da parto or birth tray from a secular depiction of a mother receiving visitors while lying-in. The scene in the fresco cycle of the life of John in the Tornabuoni Chapel in the church of Santa Maria Novella in Florence is probably the most famous, created by Domenico Ghirlandaio and his workshop between 1485 and 1490. The reformer Martin Luther wrote a hymn about baptism, \\"\\", which became associated with the Baptist's day. The feast was celebrated in Lutheran Leipzig, Johann Sebastian Bach composed three church cantatas for the occasion, especially a chorale cantata on Luther's hymn: * , 24 June 1723 * , 24 June 1724 * , 24 June 1738 or a later year =In Eastern Christianity= In the Eastern Orthodox Church and other Eastern Christian Churches, St John the Baptist is usually called St John the Forerunner, a title used also in the West (\\"Œ†œÅœåŒ¥œÅŒøŒºŒøœÇ\\" Pr√≥dromos in Greek, \\"Precursor\\" in Latin). This title indicates that the purpose of his ministry was to prepare the way for the coming of Jesus Christ. In the Byzantine Rite, the Feast of his Nativity is celebrated on June 24. It is a major feast day and is celebrated with an All-Night Vigil. It has an Afterfeast of one day. The feast usually falls during the Apostles' Fast (in Orthodox Churches that follow the Julian calendar, this feast always falls during the Apostles' Fast). In addition to the birth of John the Baptist, the Byzantine Rite also has the following commemorations of the life of John the Baptist: *January 7 ‚Äì The Synaxis of St John the Forerunner (main feast day, immediately after Theophany (Epiphany) on January 6) *February 24 ‚Äì First and Second Finding of the Head of St. John the Forerunner *May 25 ‚Äì Third Finding of the Head of St. John the Forerunner *August 29 ‚Äì The Beheading of St. John the Forerunner *September 23 Conception of St John the Forerunner and the Commemoration of Sts. Zechariah and Elizabeth. The Armenian Apostolic Church commemorates the \\"Birth of John the Forerunner\\" on January 15, and June 7 is the \\"Commemoration Day of St John the Forerunner.\\" September 1 is the Feast of \\"Saints John the Forerunner and Job the Righteous.\\" *In Ukraine Belarus and Russia Ivan Kupala Day is celebrated in the 7th of July. Celebration calvary in Brittany, 1893 The question would naturally arise as to why the celebration falls on June 24 rather than June 25 if the date is to be precisely six months before Christmas. It has often been claimed that the Church authorities wanted to Christianize the pagan solstice celebrations and for this reason advanced Saint John's feast as a substitute. This explanation is questionable because in the Middle Ages the solstice took place around the middle of June due to the inaccuracy of the Julian calendar. It was only in 1582, through the Gregorian calendar reform, that the solstice returned to June 21 as it had been in the fourth century. Therefore, a more likely reason why the festival falls on June 24 lies in the Roman way of counting, which proceeded backward from the Kalends (first day) of the succeeding month. Christmas was \\"the eighth day before the Kalends of January\\" (Octavo Kalendas Januarii). Consequently, Saint John's Nativity was put on the \\"eighth day before the Kalends of July.\\" However, since June has only thirty days, in our present (Germanic) way of counting, the feast falls on June 24. Nevertheless, the fact of the feast falling around the time of the solstice is considered by many to be significant, recalling the words of John the Baptist with regard to Jesus: \\"He must increase, but I must decrease\\" (). =Customs= All over Europe \\"Saint John's fires\\" are lighted on mountains and hilltops on the eve of his feast. As the first day of summer, Saint John's Day is considered in ancient folklore one of the great \\"charmed\\" festivals of the year. Hidden treasures are said to lie open in lonely places, waiting for the lucky finder. Divining rods should be cut on this day. Herbs are given unusual powers of healing, which they retain if they are plucked during the night of the feast. In Germany they call these herbs Johanneskraut (St. John's herbs), and people bring them to church for a special blessing. In Scandinavia and in the Slavic countries it is an ancient superstition that on Saint John's Day witches and demons are allowed to roam the earth. As at Halloween, children go the rounds and demand \\"treats,\\" straw figures are thrown into the flames, and much noise is made to drive the demons away. El Dia de San Juan is celebrated in Tucson, Arizona, United States. According to tradition, this day marks the beginning of the monsoon season. There is a legend that the Spanish explorer Francisco V√°squez de Coronado prayed for rain on June 24, 1540. Right after his prayers, it rained. John the Baptist ritually cleansed the faithful of their sins in the Jordan River. So people of Mexico and the American Southwest once followed morning mass on June 24 with a dip fully clothed in the nearest body of water. In the last part of the 20th Century, public celebrations of El Dia de San Juan faded in Tucson. Public fiestas on the nearby Tohono O'odham reservation also disappeared. In 1998, the City of Tucson in partnership with neighborhoods and private organizations revived the tradition of ‚ÄúEl Dia de San Juan\\".\\"Feast of St. John the Baptist celebrates monsoon‚Äôs onset.\\" Arizona Daily Star.

The rock relief is on a rock face near the source of the ƒ∞vriz Suyu, whose water has damaged the relief in modern times. It depicts the late 8th-century BC king Warpalawas and the storm-god Tarhunzas and is accompanied by a hieroglyphic Luwian inscription. Rock reliefs are a prominent aspect of Hittite art. King Warpalawas (right) before the god Tarhunzas It is the best produced of the many Hittite rock reliefs and measures 4.2 m high by 2.4 m wide. It dates from the second half of the 8th century BC, the time of the Neo-Hittite-Aramean principalities. On the right hand side of the relief is king Warpalawas of Tuwana who stands on a stone platform with his hands raised in a gesture of greeting or worship. Opposite him at left stands the god Tarhunzas, who is depicted as much larger. Ripe stalks of wheat and grape clusters in his hands indicate that he brings about fertility. A sickle at his hip symbolises the time immediately before the harvest. The location of the relief on the cliff face of the ƒ∞vriz Suyu suggests that the source of the fertility depicted on the relief was not the rare rains but the water which flowed from this spot almost all year. Thus, the spring could indicate the existence of a local spring cult.Mustafa ≈ûahin. \\"Neue Beobachtungen zum Felsrelief von ƒ∞vriz/Konya.

Beginning as a splinter from earlier Radical parties, it initially played a minor role in Spanish parliamentary life, before coming to prominence as one of the leading political forces of the Second Republic. Origins (1908-1930) The Radical Republican Party was founded on 6 January 1908 in Santander by the Lerrouxist wing of the Republican Union, which splintered in disagreement from Nicolas Salmer√≥n's policy of alliance with Catalan regionalists. Initially, its structure was loose enough and its Radicalism broad enough to contain many different tendencies, notably a Radical-Socialist left wing led by Alvaro de Albornoz, a centrist wing led by Diego Mart√≠nez-Barrio and a right wing led (from 1910) by Alejandro Lerroux. Over time the left factions periodically splintered off to form more socially-progressive Radical parties: the Radical- Socialist Republican Party in 1928 and the Democratic Republican Party in 1934. Consequently, by the early 1930s, the original Radical Republican Party had been pushed from the left to the centre and the centre-right, preferring to make alliances with anti-socialist and nationalist parties of the liberal and religious right. That process (see sinistrisme) was broadly similar to the path taken in France by the antisocialist anticlericals known as the National Radicals In its early years, the party was heavily anchored in Lerroux's fiefdom of Barcelona, which rendered difficult the task of creating either a social-democratic political movement or a regionally-focussed Catalanist Radical movement. In 1910, the Radical-Republicans first entered parliament, via an electoral bloc with socialists and other Radicals and republicans, known as the Conjunci√≥n Republicano-Socialista (Republican and Socialist coalition). From 1914 to 1916, it broke with the Socialists and entered legislative elections solely alongside other 'national' (non-regionalist) republicans though the electoral failure of 1916 put an end to this bloc. During the final decade of the Restoration, the Radical Republicans continued to possess a modest parliamentary representation, with Lerroux enjoying a certain prestige as the chief figure of Spanish republicanism. That came to end with Miguel Primo de Rivera's coup in 1923, and the Radical Republicans went underground. As an end to the dictatorship came in sight, the party began to prepare for a return to constitutional normality. In 1926, it initiated the Republican Alliance, an umbrella organisation of various republicans hoping to push for a republican regime once the dictatorship ended. The Alliance excluded the Socialist Party; in 1928, the Radical-Republicans' left wing split to found the Radical-Socialist Republican Party since it was eager to maintain close links with the socialist movement. The three organisations were the main participants in the Provisional Government that formed after the abdication of Alfonso XIII in April 1931. Second Republic (1931-1936) The legislative elections of June 1931 returned the PRR as the second-largest parliamentary group, after the Socialists. The Radical Republicans generally supported the original constitutional bill that provided for an integral, unitary state but with allowance for devolved regions. The party, however, greatly diverged from the republican parties to its left on certain constitutional questions, notably over unicameralism, the dissolution of the religions congregations and the legal provisions for the socialisation of property. These disagreements led the two PRR ministers, Lerroux and Mart√≠nez Barrios, to quit the Aza√±a government in December 1931, and the Radical- Republicans would act as the principle opposition group. That de facto laced the party on the centre-right, and it worked alongside the conservative- liberal republican parties of Melquiades √Ålvarez, Santiago Alba, Ortega y Gasset, and Alcal√° Zamora. After the fall of the Azana government in September 1933, Lerroux was asked to form a government excluding the Socialist Party and including the centre-left and centre-right republican parties. The government proved unable to command sufficient confidence in the Cortes, with the result that fresh elections were held in which the PRR emerged the strongest single group in parliament with 102 deputies. Lerroux again formed a government, this time of the various conservative-liberal centre-right parties, but the composition of the congress was such that he could not govern without either the republican left, few in number and fragmented, or the powerful bloc of the religious right, the CEDA. Over the next year various governments dominated by Radical-Republicans were toppled before the cabinet was finally extended to include the CEDA, a move that prompted the October Rising of 1934. The increasing preference of Lerroux's wing to cooperate with the religious right over the fellow secular Radicals of the republican left caused concern among many members of the party. A series of concessions to the CEDA led several of the party's most prominent figures to abandon it in protest between October 1933 and October 1934. Most significantly, the schism of April 1934 had the party's second figure, the former interior minister and prime minister Diego Mart√≠nez Barrios, led a faction out of the party, taking with him twenty of the PRR's hundred deputies. They would soon merge with the right wing of the old Radical-Socialist Party to form the Republican Union. The walkouts left the remainder of the PRR even more inclined to concession with the religious right. Lerroux's rump PRR remained in government with the conservative- liberals and the CEDA for 1935. The party, already heavily weakened, made increasing policy concessions to the CEDA. It was fatally damaged by the revelations of two corruption scandals, known as the Nombela and Straperlo affairs, in the autumn of 1935. This led to the downfall of Lerroux as premier, though members of the PRR itself remained in the subsequent cabinets headed by two independents considered to be philosophically close to Radical- Republicanism, Joaquin Chapaprieta and Manuel Portela-Valladares. The party did not recover. In the elections of 1936, it chose to ally for electoral lists with the parties of the religious and monarchist right, and many of its own local branches and voters abandoned it and migrated to other parties believed to better represent the spirit of Radical Republicanism: Portela Valladares's Centre Republicans on the centre-right, Martinez Barrios's centre-right Republican Union, or Manuel Azana's centre-left Republican Left. The PRR garnered just 1% of the vote, returning a mere six deputies, and several of them abandoned the party in parliament to instead sit among the Republican Centre group. When the insurrection of July 1936 broke out, the PRR was proscribed, which brought its 30-year history to an end.

Early life Yaltah was born in San Francisco, the youngest of three extraordinarily musically gifted children. Her siblings were Yehudi Menuhin and Hephzibah Menuhin. Through her father Moshe Menuhin, a former rabbinical student and anti-Zionist writer, Menuhin was descended from a distinguished rabbinical dynasty. Yaltah was named after her mother, Marutha's, home town of Yalta in Crimea. At the age of three, she became part of the rigorous regime already imposed on her siblings: the family employed tutors for the children, and Yaltah had her first piano lessons from the wife of the tutor in harmony and counterpoint. In 1960, she married (third marriage) an American pianist Joel Ryce who later retrained as a psychotherapist. Joel died in 1998. She was taken to Paris at the age of four when Yehudi and Hephzibah went to study there. Marcel Ciampi, engaged to teach Hephzibah, initially refused to entertain the notion of teaching Yaltah at such a young age. However, Yaltah so impressed him with her spontaneous rendition of Schumann's Kinderszenen that he remarked, \\"Mrs. Menuhin's womb is a veritable conservatory,\\" and agreed to take her on as well. Her taking piano lessons did not mean that her parents considered her - or for that matter, Hephzibah - capable of pursuing a career in music: Yaltah's mother in particular was firmly opposed to the idea that her daughters would follow in Yehudi's footsteps. Apart from Ciampi, she studied with Rudolf Serkin in Basel, Armando Silvestri in Rome and Carl Friedberg in New York. Career One of Yaltah's earliest orchestral appearances was with Pierre Monteux and the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra, playing Beethoven's \\"Emperor\\" Concerto. Over the years Yaltah performed a wide repertoire. She played a pivotal role in the careers of numerous young composers, particularly during her stay in Los Angeles in the 1950s. She had a great love of chamber music and performed the sonata literature of the violin, viola and cello, as well as works for larger groups. Yaltah gave many first performances of works by Erich Zeisl, George Antheil, Ernst Krenek, Frank Martin, Louis Gruenberg, Mario Castelnuovo-Tedesco and Walter Piston. She recorded for Everest, EMI, Deutsche Grammophon Gesellschaft, SPA, Music Library and EMI-World Record Club. Yaltah's tours took her from Alaska to New Zealand; from Texas to Switzerland. She appeared in duo recitals with cellists Gabor Rejto, George Neikrug, Guy Fallot and Felix Schmidt; violinist Israel Baker; violists Michael Mann and Paul Doktor, and with Joel Ryce in duo-piano with whom she performed regularly in recital, in double concertos, and in television specials in Paris, London and New York. She married Ryce in 1960, and their 40-year marriage was a happy one. The Menuhin-Ryce duo won the coveted Harriet Cohen International Music Award in 1962, in a programme largely devoted to works by Schubert for four hands. In 1966, they performed the Mozart Double Piano Concerto under the baton of Yehudi Menuhin in Gstaad and other venues in Europe. Yaltah and Joel Ryce were soloists in Saint-Sa√´ns' The Carnival of the Animals for the BBC. In 1967, Yaltah and Joel recorded the entire duet repertoire of Mozart in America for Everest Records, the first time that this was done by one team of artists. Yaltah performed regularly as both soloist and chamber player. In 1951 she made a joint New York debut with the violinist Israel Baker. Shortly before the outbreak of World War II, she enrolled at the Juilliard School of Music in New York using the assumed name of \\"Kate Davis\\". Nobody recognised this pianist even when she proved to be so talented that she was put in charge of teaching other students. Highlights of Yaltah's career include a performance for Queen Elizabeth II at Windsor Castle in 1973, when she played the Schubert Notturno with Yehudi and Ross Pople; the Mozart Double Piano Concerto with Hephzibah for the Willa Cather centenary celebrations in America, and a recital with Joel at Queen Elizabeth Hall, London, when they played Bart√≥k's Sonata for Two Pianos and Percussion. Her charity performances included evenings for the British Red Cross; the Organisation of Rehabilitation Training (ORT), Geneva; the Goulston Foundation, London; Pentonville Prison and for Friends of the Rose, Geneva. Her recorded favourites include the \\"family\\" recording of the Mozart Triple Concerto (Yaltah, Hephzibah and Jeremy at the piano, with Yehudi conducting) and the four-hand piano duets of Mozart with Joel. Yaltah was a co-founder in 1965 (with Stefan Askenase and Johannes Wasmuth) and director of \\"Arts and Music\\", an international non-profit social project for the benefit of young artists and the arts in general. Marcel Marceau and Oskar Kokoschka were among its strongest supporters. \\"Arts and Music\\" - still active to this day - was housed in a beautiful old railway station at Rolandseck, near Bonn. She took a very keen interest in youth orchestras and frequently performed with the Brighton Youth Orchestra, also undertaking tours in Wales with Aelodau'r Gerddorfa, the all-Wales Youth Orchestra. Lifestyle, death and legacy A gifted linguist, Yaltah wrote a poem each day of the year in one of six languages. In 1939 an anthology of her poetry, entitled Malgr√© L'Espace, was published privately. The anthology is currently held by the Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center at the University of Texas at Austin. Yaltah died at her home in London on 9 June 2001, just a few days after giving her final recital at the Orwell Park School, Suffolk, of which she was Honorary Patron. Jonathan Benthall, a writer for The Guardian, described Yaltah as \\"a determined original, tireless in reaching out to feed, comfort, heal and advise.\\". Yehudi Menuhin wrote of her in his autobiography that she was \\"reaping the rewards in kindness and gratitude that life has otherwise denied her\\". Memorial fund Medal awarded by the Yaltah Menuhin Memorial Fund. A memorial fund in Yaltah's name is run and administered by Iain and Charlotte Phillips. Based in the Netherlands, the primary objective of the fund is to help develop the talents of young pianists who have already given proof of their outstanding musical ability and promise in the practice of their art, by means of awards and bursaries. The distinguished French pianist, C√©cile Ousset, is Honorary Patron of the Yaltah Menuhin Memorial Fund. As part of a revamped prize package for the Leeds International Piano Competition, the Yaltah Menuhin Award became a permanent feature of The Leeds in 2018, presented to the pianist who demonstrates the greatest collaborative and empathetic qualities in the chamber performance of the semi-final.

The melody is based on Anton Rubinstein's \\"Romance in E flat, Op. 44, No. 1,\\" popularly known as \\"Rubinstein's Romance\\". The song is most closely associated with Frank Sinatra, who recorded it first for Columbia Records on November 14, 1944, with an arrangement by Axel Stordahl. This recording was on the reverse side of a 78 rpm record with \\"White Christmas\\", and consequently did very well with \\"White Christmas\\" reaching the No. 7 spot in the Billboard charts. \\"If You Are But a Dream\\" itself briefly reached the Billboard charts in the No. 19 position. A year later, in 1945, \\"If You Are But a Dream\\" was included in the Academy Award-winning short film, The House I Live In, in which Sinatra was featured. Sinatra recorded this song again for Capitol Records on December 11, 1957, with an arrangement by Nelson Riddle. This recording was first released on the LP This Is Sinatra Volume 2 (Capitol 982).

Roy attended Yarmouth High School as a freshman, then transferred to nearby North Yarmouth Academy (NYA) in order to pursue an athletic scholarship. Roy transferred again and graduated from Tabor Academy and received an ice hockey scholarship to Boston University (College of Communication, Class of 2000). Injury On October 20, 1995 ‚Äì just eleven seconds into his first-ever shift for Boston University men's ice hockey team ‚Äì a 20-year-old Roy slid head-first into the boards after University of North Dakota player Mitch Vig avoided Roy's check. The awkward impact with the boards resulted in Roy's cracking his fourth and fifth vertebra and leaving him a quadriplegic. Since the accident, he has regained movement in his right arm. The Travis Roy Foundation In 1997, Roy started a foundation called \\"The Travis Roy Foundation\\" to help spinal cord injury survivors and to fund research into a cure. Inspired by Travis' own story, the lifeblood of the Travis Roy Foundation has been the generosity of individuals, corporations and foundations across North America. This generosity has made an immediate impact on the lives of many individuals. Since 1997, the Travis Roy Foundation has distributed more than $9 million in individual grants and to research projects and rehabilitation institutions. The individual grant funds have been used to modify vans and to purchase wheelchairs, computers, ramps, shower chairs, and other adaptive equipment to help paraplegics and quadriplegics live their lives. According to the Travis Roy Foundation, the foundation is uniquely positioned to touch individual lives with its focus on providing adaptive equipment and sponsoring research. In the US alone, there are approximately 250,000 people currently living with a spinal cord injury and 13,000 new injuries each year. In October 2015, Sargent College Dean Christopher Dean announced, at a fundraiser for the foundation, that a group of anonymous donors gave a gift of $2.5 million gift to establish the Travis M. Roy Professorship in Rehabilitation Sciences at Sargent and provide the foundation with office space on campus and a $50,000 annual stipend towards staffing for the next 10 years.

Michael O'Laughlen, Jr. (June 3, 1840 ‚Äì September 23, 1867) was a conspirator in the assassination of U.S. President Abraham Lincoln. O'Laughlen's last name was often misspelled by the press and others as O'Laughlin, but he was born Michael O'Laughlen (pronounced Oh-Lock-Lun). Early life O'Laughlen was born in Baltimore, Maryland. He was one of John Wilkes Booth's earliest friends as the Booth family lived across the street from the O'Laughlens. O'Laughlen learned the trade of raping ornamental plaster work. He also learned the art of engraving. At the start of the Civil War O'Laughlen joined the Confederate Army but was discharged in June 1862. He returned to Baltimore and joined his brother in the feed and produce business. Conspiracy Michael O'Laughlen was one of Booth's earliest recruits. In the fall of 1864 O'Laughlen agreed to become a co-conspirator in the plot to kidnap President Abraham Lincoln. He began spending time in Washington, D.C. with Booth picking up his expenses. On the night of March 15, 1865, O'Laughlen met with Booth and other conspirators at Gautier's Restaurant on Pennsylvania Avenue to discuss the possible abduction of the President. Basically, the plan was to abduct Lincoln and take him to Richmond, Virginia for the purpose of making the Union government exchange prisoners with the Confederacy. Booth learned that Lincoln was scheduled to attend a matinee performance of the play Still Waters Run Deep at the Campbell Hospital on the outskirts of Washington on March 17, 1865. Booth, O'Laughlen, and the other co-conspirators planned on intercepting the president's carriage. The group lay in wait along the road. Finally, a polished carriage came into view and the gang prepared itself. But the president had changed plans and the carriage was possibly that of Chief Justice Salmon P. Chase. Booth's attempt to kidnap Lincoln had failed. O'Laughlen returned to Baltimore. Late in March Booth proposed another kidnap plan. This time Lincoln was to be captured at Ford's Theatre, handcuffed, and lowered by rope to the stage. Then the president would be taken to Richmond. However, Booth was not able to convince his co-conspirators that this plan was feasible. According to O'Laughlen, this was the end of his plotting with Booth. However, O'Laughlen did return to Washington the day before Lincoln's assassination. It is unclear whether this was due to the conspiracy or simply to spend time with friends in Washington. At the trial, there was conflicting testimony about O'Laughlen's movements on the day of the assassination. Whatever the case, O'Laughlen voluntarily surrendered on Monday, April 17, 1865. O'Laughlen was tried along with Mary Surratt, Lewis Powell, George Atzerodt, David Herold, Samuel Arnold, Edmund Spangler and Samuel Mudd. The government attempted to prove he had stalked Ulysses S. Grant on the nights of April 13 and April 14 with the intent to kill and murder. This was not proven, but there was no doubt O'Laughlen was a willing conspirator through late March. He was found guilty and sentenced to life in prison. Prison O'Laughlen was sent to Fort Jefferson in the Dry Tortugas with Spangler, Arnold, and Mudd. He died there of yellow fever. After death On February 13, 1869, President Andrew Johnson ordered O'Laughlen's remains to be turned over to his mother. His body was then sent north to Baltimore. He was buried in Baltimore in Green Mount Cemetery. John Wilkes Booth and Samuel Arnold were also buried in the same cemetery. In popular culture He is a character in National Treasure: Book of Secrets. Among the film's many historical inaccuracies, O'Laughlen is portrayed as a middle-aged man (he was actually 24 years old in April 1865), and a member of the Knights of the Golden Circle.

History During a great storm in Table Bay in 1865, 19 ships were stranded. Amongst the many schooners was the Kehrwieder, the ship of Captain Johann Heinrich Ferdinand Parow. After being stranded, Captain Parow settled down in the Cape of Good Hope and married Johanna Wilhelmina Timmerman, the daughter of the family that helped Captain Parow after being stranded on the Cape coast. Parow quickly realised the potential value of the Tyger Valley area north of Cape Town and that the area held great opportunities for cattle trade. Captain Parow soon moved inland to this area and started selling ground in the area which is today known as Parow, which built up a great deal of wealth for the Captain. Parow died on 4 December 1910, in his house in Cassibelle, Maitland. His wife, JW Timmerman, died ten years prior. They did not have any children. Captain Parow's telescope is in the Town Hall of Parow.  Modern day  A village management board was established for Parow in 1902. It was upgraded to a municipality in 1939. The municipality was incorporated into the City of Tygerberg in 1996. The Parow valley was included in the Cape Town municipal land area in 1944. During the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, Parow was largely transforming into a commercial area, with many shopping centres opening around Voortrekker road, one of the longest roads in Cape Town. With the extreme political struggle of apartheid in the 1980s and the advent of democracy in the 1990s, Parow's popularity started to decline and many of its higher income population moved further north. In 2005 Parow became the headquarters for the South African division of the International Alliance of Guardian Angels, the world's oldest and largest volunteer public safety patrol organisation. Sports and other events are sometimes held in Parow Civic Centre. Professional soccer clubs Ajax Cape Town and Vasco da Gama are based in Parow.  Area  Parow consists of the following areas: Ravensmead, Florida, Beaconvale, Cravenby, Parow Valley, Klipkop, Parow, Parow East, Oostersee, Fairfield Estate, Glenlily, Churchill Estate, Clamhall, Avondale, De Tijger, Parow North, Panorama, Plattekloof, Welgelegen, Parow Industria  Economy  The Foschini Group, Pepkor and De Haan's Bus & Coach are headquartered and in the paowin Parow and Peninsula Beverages too.

It is in the Town of Genesee, in southeastern Wisconsin between Milwaukee and Madison, and named for the train station, or depot, of the Wisconsin and Calumet Railroad (now the Wisconsin and Southern Railroad) that formerly served the town. Wisconsin State Highways 59 and 83 intersect in Genesee Depot. History Genesee Depot was founded mainly by German, Welsh, Irish, and English immigrants in the late 19th century. Stillman Smith was the first to settle in the area in the summer of 1837. In 1838 Benjamin A. Jenkins built a log cabin inn at what is now the intersection of Hwys. 59 and 83. It served travelers going to and from Milwaukee. Jenkins later built a three-story mill and wagon factory. \\"By the 1890s there was a grain elevator, slaughter house, two stores, blacksmith shop, shoe shop, woolen factory, post office, lumber yard, and train depot with ticket, baggage, and waiting rooms, [and] storage buildings.\\" Genesee Depot garnered attention as a result of the Milwaukee & Mississippi Railroad through the community. The Johnston Quarry was started in 1842 on what is now WI 59. It provided jobs and led to the development of business in the area. The quarry provided the stone for many Wisconsin buildings, including the Wisconsin State Capitol, the Milwaukee Sentinel building, and the early buildings for Carroll University. =Historic sites= Ten Chimneys Many buildings in Genesee Depot are the originals from the late 19th and early 20th centuries, including \\"the original section of St. Paul's Catholic Church (Hwy 83 & D), built in the early 1870s; the James Proctor House (Hwy 83 by bridge spanning Genesee Creek) also dating back to the 1860s, behind which stood the Genesee Woolen Mill; and the new railroad depot built in 1897 after the first one burned down. This station building was relocated slightly south of where it originally stood on Hwy 83 and currently is Mama D's Coffee shop.\\"; this business is currently known as Mama D's Coffee Shop. The original town hall, now the Wales-Genesee Lions and Lioness Club, was built in 1912 and is on the National Register of Historic Places. Another historic site in Genesee Depot is Ten Chimneys, the home of Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne, so known because among the three buildings on the site, there are ten chimneys. Lunt and Fontanne's residence in Genesee Depot was their summer home and a popular gathering place for theater people. It is decorated with original pieces and collections of the Lunts from the early 20th century. It is now open as a house museum. Education Magee Elementary, in the Kettle Moraine School District, serves students in grades K-5. Named after John Magee, who helped bring the railroad through Genesee Depot, the school was completed and opened in 1922. It was remodeled in 1989 to accommodate a larger enrollment, which stands at about 320 students.http://www.city-data.com/school/magee-elementary-wi.html Churches =St. Paul Parish= St. Paul Parish was founded in 1863. In 1961 a new church was built down the road from the original site to accommodate the growing congregation. A K-8 school was also built, and remodeled in 1997.

Harry Link, an American, sometimes appears as a co- writer; his input was probably limited to an alternative \\"middle eight\\" (bridge) which many performers prefer. It is one of a group of \\"Mayfair songs\\", like \\"A Nightingale Sang in Berkeley Square\\".De Lisle, p. 41 Maschwitz wrote the song under his pen name, Holt Marvell, at the behest of Joan Carr for a late-evening revue broadcast by the BBC. The copyright was lodged in 1936. According to the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, British cabaret singer Jean Ross, with whom Maschwitz had a youthful liaison, was the muse for the song.  Creation  Although Maschwitz's wife Hermione Gingold speculated in her autobiography that the haunting jazz standard was written for either herself or actress Anna May Wong, Maschwitz himself contradicted such claims. Maschwitz instead cited \\"fleeting memories of [a] young love\\" as inspiring the song. Most sources, including the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, posit cabaret singer Jean Ross, with whom Maschwitz had a youthful romantic liaison, as the muse for the song. When the song was written, Maschwitz was Head of Variety at the BBC. It is a list song (Maschwitz calls it a \\"catalogue song\\" in his biography), in this case delineating the various things that remind the singer of a lost love. The lyrics ‚Äì the verse and three choruses ‚Äì were written by Maschwitz during the course of one Sunday morning at his flat in London between sips of coffee and vodka. Within hours of crafting the lyrics, he dictated them over the phone to Jack Strachey, and they arranged to meet the same evening to discuss the next step.  Rise to popularity  The song was not an immediate success, and Keith Prowse, Maschwitz's agent, refused to publish it, releasing the copyright to Maschwitz himself ‚Äì a stroke of luck for the lyricist. Writing in 1957, he claimed to have made ¬£40,000 from the song. Despite being featured in Spread it Abroad, a London revue of 1936,De Lisle p. 40 it aroused no interest until the famous West Indian pianist and singer Leslie Hutchinson (\\"Hutch\\") discovered it on top of a piano in Maschwitz's office at the BBC. \\"Hutch\\" liked it and recorded it, whereupon it became a great success and was recorded by musicians all over the world. This first recording by \\"Hutch\\" was by HMV in 1936. Popular versions in the USA in 1936 were by Benny Goodman, Teddy Wilson with Billie Holiday, Nat Brandywynne, Carroll Gibbons and Joe Sanders. Billie Holiday's rendering of the song with Teddy Wilson's orchestra was a favorite of Philip Larkin, who said, \\"I have always thought the words were a little pseudo- poetic, but Billie sings them with such passionate conviction that I think they really become poetry.\\"Desert Island Discs, BBC Radio Four, 17 July 1976 Holiday's version of the song peaked at No. 5 on the Billboard Pop Songs chart.De Lisle p.42 = French version = The song was translated in French under the title Ces petites choses (\\"These small things\\") and recorded by Jean Sablon in 1936 and by Ann Savoy in 2007.

Historical background  Like their counterparts in the Kansas region, local Texans that lived in the Big Thicket forest region who refused to fight for the Confederacy were referred to as Jayhawkers. Unlike the Kansas Jayhawkers, the Big Thicket Jayhawkers were not known to be guerrilla fighters. The Big Thicket was a good place to hide, and Sam Houston had planned to hide his army there had he lost the Battle of San Jacinto.Loughmiller, Campell, and Lynn Loughmiller. Big Thicket Legacy. Austin: The University of Texas Press, 1977. Print. Sometime after April 1862, people who were drafted and didn't want to fight for the Confederate Army during the Civil War hid in the Big Thicket and became known as Jayhawkers. The Big Thicket Jayhawkers were initial followers of Sam Houston and fully believed that the Civil War was a \\"rich man's war and a poor man's fight\\". Randolph Fillingim stated that Jayhawkers \\"were sensible men. They knew what would happen if the slaves were not freed. It wouldn't be long till the men who had money to start a business of any kind would buy slaves for his labor and poor whites would be left out.\\" A few of these Big Thicket Jayhawkers names are accounted for: Warren Collins, Stace Collins, Newt Collins, Lige Cain and Jim Williford. Although the Jayhawkers lacked coffee and tobacco they had plenty of game and fish. They would live off of the land's wild fruit and often salvaged corn sacks from timber camps for clothing. Due to the numerous beehives near Honey Island, a vast concentration of these Jayhawkers formed a camp nearby. The Jayhawkers would cut down a tree and take the honey. Where Honey Island is now, there were (at that time) two big pear trees that the Jayhawkers had built a table between. The Jayhawkers would place honey and game on the table for their families to come and pick up and take to Beaumont to sell. With the money from the sold goods they were able to buy many goods they lacked such as tobacco, coffee and ammunition.E. R. Bills (author). Texas Far & Wide: The Tornado with Eyes, Gettysburg's Last Casualty, The Celestial Skipping Stone and Other Tales. Charleston, SC: The History Press, 2017. Sympathetic locals would also bring supplies to this encampment, often in exchange for the honey that was collected.  The Escape  In the spring of 1865, a Confederate captain named Charlie Bullock captured some of these refugees and locked them up in a wooden shack near Woodville, but they managed to escape. According to Lance Rosier and Cecil Overstreet, when the Jayhawkers were brought to Woodville there were guards placed all around them. In order to free the men, whiskey was brought by a local sympathizer and the fiddle playing ensued. One of the Jayhawkers, Mr. Warren Collins, snuck his pocket knife in tucked away in his boot. Using some backwoods ingenuity the Jayhawkers pried a floor plank up in the floor of the shack. As the fiddle playing continued, Warren began to dance a \\"jig\\" entertaining the inebriated guards. As Warren danced about, the Jayhawkers escaped one by one through the plank lifted up in the floor. In the commotion that followed, Mr. Collins crawled out from the wooden shack and simply walked to freedom.  The Fire  Shortly after the escape, Confederate Captain James Kaiser set fire to the canebrake region near Honey Island to flush the Jayhawkers out. The fire did not harm any of the Jayhawkers, only the surrounding thicket. According to Lance Rosier, \\"you take all the Collins'‚Äîthis whole place is full of them‚Äîwell, their ancestors [were] Jayhawkers. If any of them had gotten burned in the fire someone would have known about it.\\" The fire burned for two days and the intense heat permanently destroyed the canebrakeE. R. Bills (author).

Skira Group. Accessed January 2014. =Early works ‚Äì Mid-1980s= The North Pole is a recurring theme in Wang Guangyi's early works; it is seen not in relation to its geographic characteristics, but as a symbolic place where a new faith is born, a place in which the individual must deal principally with himself but without freeing himself from the social. Working on the Frozen North Pole cycle (1984-1985), the group of young Artists of the North of which Wang Guangyi was a part, chose to confront themselves with Western philosophy. In his Post Classical series (1986-1988) Wang Guangyi worked on a synthetic revision of the great works of Western art tied to themes of religion, morality, faith and ideology. These paintings use various grey tones and encapsulate the human figure and its environment without many details. Wang Guangyi's objective consisted in elaborating a style that deviated from that of classic art, an expressive strategy which derived from his reading of Gombrich.Lu Peng, A History Of Art in 20th-Century China, Edizioni Charta, Milan, Italy, 2010, pp. 1153‚Äì1174 =Great Criticism, 1990-2007= Great Criticism is Wang Guangyi's most famous cycle of works. These works use propaganda images of the Cultural Revolution and contemporary logos from Western advertisements. Wang Guangyi began this cycle in 1990 and ended it in 2007 when he became convinced that its international success would compromise the original meaning of the works, namely that political and commercial propaganda are two forms of brainwashing.Huang Zhuan, Politics and Theology in Chinese Contemporary Art /Reflections on the work of Wang Guangyi, Skira, Milan, Italy 2013 =1990s= The series and installations VISA (1995-1998), Passport (1994-1995), and Virus Carriers (1996-1998) contain images of infants, grown adults and dogs accompanied by their respective names, places, dates of birth and genders. The aforementioned titles of these works are then imprinted upon these images. By forefronting the bureaucratic procedures tied to moving from one country to another, these works reveal that the organization of the State enacts its own defenses when evaluating the potential danger of individuals. Wang Guangyi perceives a well-established climate of reciprocal suspicion and looming danger, which ripened during the Cold War and still persists today, even if it has lost the oppressiveness born of forced indoctrination. Wang Guangyi's reflection deals with the relationship that Power has with the individual, on which it maintains control by increasing collective fears to then propose itself as a bastion against unknown dangers that could suddenly strike against defenseless people. The artist maintains that through these forms of psychological pressure, a tacit agreement that provides protection against the contagion of new viruses in exchange for the renouncement of a part of one's freedom is forged between the Power and the individual. =2000s= During the 2000s the relationship between Wang Guangyi's works and the transcendent increased. In fact the title given to the Materialist series (2001-2005) is not contradictory. This series of sculptures made from the images of twelve workers, farmers and soldiers that were taken from propaganda images. According to Wang Guangyi these propaganda images bring to light that the main force of the people, the anger expressed by their movements, derives from faith in ideology. With these sculptures the artist attempts to put an image to the general feeling of the people while referencing dialectic materialism - Materialist is a term that has particular import in Chinese history in that it summarizes the socialist ideology. At the same time, the artist also sees another level of meaning within the work. In art, things that possess certain conceptual qualities are called ‚Äúthe object‚Äù, which in Chinese has the same root as the word ‚Äúmaterialist‚Äù, Wang Guangyi has also represented the great political (Lenin, Stalin, Mao), spiritual (Christ) and spiritual and political leaders (John XXIII), as well as the philosophers whose thought continues to exert its influence today (Marx and Engels) in series of oil paintings entitled New Religion (2011). The images seem taken from photographic negatives, and though the artist uses a traditional oil painting technique in these works, the ambiguity created by the reference to photography breaks the familiarity that the spectator has with them, thereby opening up interpretations as to their meaning. Through this cycle of works Wang Guangyi has asked himself about the commonalities between the great utopias, the fascination that they exert on humans, and why all men feel the need to find figures on which to place their faith. The installations that make up the cycle Cold War Aesthetics (2007-2008) contain historical reconstructions of the Cold War period. In these works, Wang Guangyi deals with the psychological effects of the propaganda that was characteristic of the Chinese political climate of that time. In order to evoke a psychological reaction, the artist makes the spectators feel the emotion, climate and mentality of that era. Criticism Wang Guangyi, like others such as Fang Lijun, has become a millionaire, one of China's nouveau riches. Such painters, with their large studios and expensive houses and cars, are in China called bopu dashi or \\"pop masters\\".

Yulsman's first camera was a $13.50 Argus, given to him by his aunt as a 12th birthday present. He used it to photograph Roosevelt in a torchlit parade. \\"I was a good photographer,\\" he recalled. \\"I understood both the language and the magic. It seemed to come naturally, like a gift from Providence.\\" Expelled from Simon Grantz High School, Yulsman lied about his age in March 1941 in order to enlist in the U.S. Army Air Corps. In the Army photography school at Denver's Lowry Field, he learned to operate a \\"gun camera.\\" Serving in North Africa during World War II, he was promoted to Master Sergeant, and on August 1, 1943, he flew in Operation Tidal Wave, a bombing raid on the Romanian oil refineries of Ploe≈üti, which were a major source of oil for the Nazi war machine. This combat action brought him the Distinguished Flying Cross, which is awarded for \\"heroism or extraordinary achievement while participating in an aerial flight.\\" After the war, Yulsman moved to Manhattan where he became a successful freelance photojournalist, shooting \\"jazz, politics and girls\\" and hanging out in Greenwich Village at the Limelight Cafe, while contributing to Playboy, Collier's, Look and other magazines. During this period he teamed up with author Cornelius Ryan (The Longest Day) on a story about the world's fastest submarine. He also did photographs for two Dick Gregory books, From the Back of the Bus (Avon, 1962) and What's Happening? (1965), which offered instruction on \\"how to recognize Uncle Tom.\\" During the 1970s, Yulsman worked for the Ringling Brothers Barnum & Bailey Circus for four years and taught photography at the School of Visual Arts. He wrote several instructional books on photography, including Jerry Yulsman Tells How to Take Glamour Photographs (1960), The Complete Book of 8mm Movie Making (1972), The Complete Book of 35mm Photography (1976) and Color Photography Simplified (1977). His personal approach to photography was expressed when he stated, \\"I believe that the main function of photography is a historical one. I think of photos first as historical documents, delineating time and place, and only secondarily as possible works of art.\\" Jack Kerouac His color photos of Kerouac with Joyce Johnson were taken in Greenwich Village outside the Kettle of Fish bar on MacDougal Street during the fall of 1957, and one of these was used by Johnson on the jacket of her book Minor Characters because the image metaphorically shows her as a minor character in the background. In this series of photographs, first published in Pageant, Johnson is always seen standing in the background. This is because she thought Yulsman only wanted Kerouac in the frame, so she stepped aside. However, Yulsman cleverly repositioned the angle to include her, adding to the fascination of the images. However, when one of the photos from this session was used for a Gap ad, airbrushing was used to remove Johnson from the picture. Novels Yulsman began writing fiction in the early 1980s and published two novels. Elleander Morning (Random House, 1984) is an alternative history in which World War II never happened. In the book's opening pages, Adolf Hitler is sitting in a caf√© in Vienna in 1913 when he is assassinated by an American woman, Elleander Morning. The novel won several awards, including the 1986 Ditmar Award for best international fiction and the 1987 Kurd- La√üwitz-Preis. The Last Liberator (Dutton, 1991) is based on Yulsman's WWII experiences. He planned a novel based on the Collyer brothers but abandoned it when he learned that Marcia Davenport had already fictionalized the brothers in My Brother's Keeper (1954). Under pseudonyms, he wrote adult fiction, including the first three volumes of The Intimate Memoir of Dame Jenny Everleigh, which was later serialized. In 1999, Yulsman died of lung cancer. At the time of his death, he was working on Gotham, a novel celebrating New York. Yulsman's fourth wife, Barbara Woike, is an Associated Press editor and is remarried and living in Brooklyn.

In the 1850s, celluloid was invented as a substitute for substances such as ivory and tortoiseshell. One major use for the new substance was in the production of hair combs, and this was Foster's first major product. Foster Grant's original production line was ladies' hair accessories; over the company's lifetime they have also produced other plastic materials including heart-lung pumps.Foster Grant Collection, Syracuse University In 1931, Foster Grant purchased the first plastics injection molding machine to be imported from Europe, however the machine arrived in non-working condition. Grant and a team of experts worked for several years to make the machine functional and reliable. Sunglasses In the 1920s, Hollywood actresses (featured on celluloid film) started wearing shorter hair styles. These became popular causing a collapse in the market for combs, and threatening Foster Grant.

Since 1990 it has housed the National Writing Centre of Wales. The centre specialises in residential creative writing and retreats. The courses are in both the English and Welsh languages, and cover many genres, forms and styles. The centre also holds regular seminars and forums.  House  The Grade II* listed building was built in the fifteenth century. The name T≈∑ Newydd translates literally from Welsh as \\"New House\\". The house has six bedrooms, a large dining room, a kitchen, a conservatory and two libraries. The outbuilding, Hafoty, is the tutors' quarters, and has six extra rooms for guests. Other architectural features of the house include a \\"Chinese Chippendale\\" balustrade, a panelled front door with fluted pilasters and a frieze, and a vaulted ceiling in the library. David Lloyd George, the Welsh politician who served as British Prime Minister during the First World War, owned T≈∑ Newydd from 1942 until his death in 1945. He had asked for his bed to be moved to the library, and died in that room. The grounds overlook Cardigan Bay and provide a scenic setting considered conducive to literary creativity. During the 1940s these were restyled by the architect Sir Clough Williams-Ellis. Lloyd George period David Lloyd George (17 January 1863 ‚Äì 26 March 1945) was a British Liberal politician and statesman, and Prime Minister of the Wartime Coalition Government (1916‚Äì22). Lloyd George grew up in Llanystumdwy in Caernarfonshire. As a child, he was educated in the local Anglican school, Llanystumdwy National School. T≈∑ Newydd was originally a farm, whose land extended to the road adjacent to Lloyd George‚Äôs other home, Brynawelon. Brynawelon was later the home of his daughter Megan. In 1942, Lloyd George and his wife Frances bought T≈∑ Newydd and initiated a major renovation by the architect Clough Williams-Ellis (28 May 1883 ‚Äì 9 April 1978). Under his direction, new additions such as the library window and the front window finals were made. Like the rest of the house, the library extension was built of local stone rubble and externally whitewashed. In 1944 the couple moved into T≈∑ Newydd. Lloyd George died in 1945, aged 82, and was buried beside the River Dwyfor in Llanystumdwy, only a short distance from the house. A monument designed by Williams-Ellis was erected around the grave. This bears an englyn (a strict-metre stanza in the Welsh language) engraved on slate in his memory, composed by his nephew Dr William George, an accomplished poet who won the crown at the National Eisteddfod in 1974. As a writers' centre Robert Minhinnick, who, with Gillian Clarke, was a tutor on the first course run at the house after it was converted to a writers' centre, credits Sally Baker with the idea for the project. During work carried out in preparation for the opening of the centre, a medieval \\"post and panel\\" screen was discovered; it is considered the most historically significant feature of the house.

The Jukun are traditionally located in Taraba, Benue, Nasarawa, Plateau, Adamawa, and Gombe States in Nigeria and parts of northwestern Cameroon. They are descendants of the people of Kwararafa. Most of the tribes in the north central of Nigeria trace their origin to the Jukun people and are related in one way or the other to the Jukuns. Until the coming of both Christianity and Islam, the Jukun people were followers of their own Traditional Religions, Most of the tribes, Alago, Agatu, Rendere, Goemai in Shendam, and others left Kwararafa when it disintegrated as a result of a power tussle. The Jukuns are divided into two major groups; the Jukun Wanu and Jukun Wapa. The Jukun Wanu are fishermen residing along the banks of the river Benue and Niger where they run through Taraba State, Benue State and Nasarawa State. The Wukari Federation, headed by the Aku Uka of Wukari, is now the main center of the Jukun people. Population and demographics Writing in the late 1920s, the British anthropologist C. K. Meek estimated that there were approximately 25,000 Jukun-speakers then alive. Meek noted that the majority of the Jukun lived in scattered groups around the Benue basin, in an area that roughly corresponded to the extent of the kingdom of Kwararafa as it existed in the 18th century. That area of Jukun habitation, Meek noted, was bounded by Abinsi to the west, Kona to the east, Pindiga to the north and Donga to the south. The language can be divided into six separate dialects: Wukari, Donga, Kona, Gwana and Pindiga, Jibu, and finally Wase Tofa, although Meek noted that the dialects of \\"Kona, Gwana and Pindiga differ so little that they may be regarded as one.\\"Meek 1931. pp. 1-2. History =Kwararafa= An estimated approximation of the boundaries of the historical Kwararafa, the kingdom from which the modern Jukun claim descendence. The Jukun-speaking peoples trace their ancestry to the rulers of the kingdom of Kwararafa, a state which existed in Western Africa from the 14th through to the 18th centuries. Traditionally, Jukun society was governed by a monarchy. =Modern history= As a result of the Fulani conquests at the beginning of the 19th century, the Jukun-speaking peoples became politically divided into various regional factions. By the 1920s, the main body of the Jukun population, known as the Wap√¢, resided in and around Wukari, where they were governed by the local king and his administration. Other Jukun-speaking peoples living in the Benue basin, such as Jukun wanu of Abinsi, Awei District, Donga and Takum, remained politically separate from the Wukari government, and the Jukun-speakers in Adamawa Province recognised the governorship of the Fulani Emir of Muri. In the post-colonial period, Nigeria has suffered violence, the result of multiple ethnic tensions among the different communities living in the country. Tensions exist between the Jukun and the neighbouring Tiv community.'''

History  From September to November 1989, during the Chadian‚ÄìLibyan conflict, Kutum was briefly occupied by Chadian forces.Prunier, G√©rard (2005) Darfur: the ambiguous genocide Cornell University Press, Ithaca, New York, page 70, During the Darfur conflict, which began in the early 21st century, the town experienced significant insecurity. While mostly government- controlled, the ethnic groups of the inhabitants are associated with the rebel groups, and the town was briefly taken by the rebels in August 2003.Prunier, G√©rard (2005) Darfur: the ambiguous genocide Cornell University Press, Ithaca, New York, page 96, Burr, Millard and Collins, Robert O.

A plus-size model is an individual of average to larger stature (sometimes but not exclusively overweight or obese) who is engaged primarily in modeling plus-size clothing. Plus-size clothing worn by plus-size models are typically catering and marketed to either Big & Tall or Tall men and women. Plus-size models also engage in work that is not strictly related to selling large-sized clothing, e.g., stock photography and advertising photography for cosmetics, household and pharmaceutical products and sunglasses, footwear and watches. Therefore, plus-size models do not exclusively wear garments marketed as plus-size clothing. This is especially true when participating in fashion editorials for mainstream fashion magazines. Synonymous and interchangeable with plus-size model is \\"full- figured model\\", \\"extended-sizes model\\", and \\"outsize model\\". Previously, the term \\"large size model\\" was also frequently used. Plus-size industry  Fashion designers are starting to look more closely at the earning potential from plus-size clothing, and have used plus-size models for their advertising campaigns and catwalks. Jean-Paul Gaultier and John Galliano both used plus- size modelsCrystal Renn (Jean Paul Gaultier), Johanna Dray (John Galliano) in their Spring 2006 showings in Paris. Gaultier also used plus-size models Marquita Pring and Crystal Renn in his Spring 2011 Ready-to-Wear show. Italian plus-size fashion house Elena Mir√≤ now regularly stages biannual pr√™t-√†-porter shows during Milan Fashion Week. Mark Fast and William Tempest each used plus- size models during their own London Fashion Week showings for Spring 2009, and again as part of All Walks Beyond the Catwalk event held on 19 September 2009 in association with the British Fashion Council. Mark Fast also used plus-size models in Fall 2010, Fall 2011, and Spring 2012. = Origins in North America = A page from the Lane Bryant Spring/Summer 1954 catalog. Lane Bryant began trading in the early 1900s as a producer of clothing for \\"Expectant Mothers and Newborn\\"'. By the early 1920s, Lane Bryant started selling clothing under the category 'For the Stout Women', which ranged between a 38‚Äì56 inch bustline. The earliest catalogs used illustrations to sell their products, but by the mid-1950s photographs were integrated into the catalogs as the evolution of printing technology made this option available. After a hiatus through the 1960‚Äì1980 period, Lane Bryant again began using plus-size models. = Specialty model agency divisions = Plus size models were first represented by model agencies in the 1970s. Prior to this, models freelanced directly with retailers, designers and magazines. Former plus-size model Mary Duffy owned Big Beauties Little Women, the first agency specializing in plus- size and petite models in 1977. Pat Swift, a plus-size model at the time, founded Plus Models in 1978. Ford Models began representing plus size models in 1978, and added two models to their board, including top model Ann Harper, due to demand from clients. By the late 1980s, Plus Models was the largest and most successful plus-size specialty agency, representing over 65 models and grossing over 2 million dollars in revenue. By 1984, Big Beauties Little Women was successful enough to run national model searches advertised in the press. The prize included the cover of It's Me magazine, a nationally published magazine for plus-size women. Not long after, Plus Models began holding national model searches. By the mid-1980s, top plus size models could earn as much as 150,000 to 200,000 dollars a year. Ford Models bought Big Beauties Little Women in 1988, later renaming the division Special Sizes and then Ford 12+. Wilhelmina NYC agent Susan Georget started the Wilhelmina 10/20 division in New York in 1994, recently re-branded W Curve. Gary Dakin headed New York's Karin Models' Curves division, only to leave after a short time to develop Ford Models' Ford 12+(rebranded Ford+) model division in their New York office in 1998. In Constantine Valhouli's 2001 plus-size model documentary Curve, Dakin states, \\"We're celebrating our 25th anniversary of the Ford 12+ division. It was the first and longest-existing plus division in the industry.\\"(sic) Together, these agents created agency divisions that have continued to recruit the highest caliber of models in the industry and are credited with expanding opportunities for plus-size models beyond working solely for plus-size clothing retailers. Former plus-size model Becca Thorpe founded the plus-size division at Muse Model Management, a boutique fashion agency in 2011. Muse also recruits high caliber models and had advanced opportunities for plus-size models beyond advertising for plus-size retailers. Ford Models closed its plus-size division in June 2013 to focus on its editorial divisions. Gary Dakin and Jaclyn Sarka founded Jag Models in July 2013, which currently represents about 30 models sizes 8-18. The agency does not brand its models as plus-size. There are a large number of reputable agencies throughout the U.S. and Canada, and internationally in Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, South Africa, Spain, Switzerland, The Netherlands, Turkey and the UK. =Specialty media and other ventures in North America= In 1979 Big Beautiful Woman magazine (more commonly known via the acronym BBW) began publication and was one of the first publications in the US catering specifically to plus-size clothing consumers. It ceased publication in 1995, but the \\"BBW\\" brand was sold onwards. Although it was resurrected in print via several editor-and-publisher combinations it continued to falter, finally ceasing print publication most recently in the late 1990s. BBW is now an online community surrounding archived material from the magazine. In 1981, Lane Bryant began publishing It's Me magazine. Along with Big Beautiful Woman, It's Me was one of the few print magazines for plus-size women. In 1982, the magazine was sold to Happy Hands Publishing Company. Spiegel catalog launched their For You from Spiegel plus-size collection in 1989 with Linda Arroz as their official consultant and spokesmodel. The three-year For You campaign included opening brick-and-mortar retail locations in upscale shopping centers. Previously, Spiegel had only been a mail-order merchant. As part of the full-scale plus-size outreach, Spiegel produced fashion videos that featured advice from image consultant Arroz, with commentary from some of the plus-size models who appeared in the video and catalog. Arroz became the fashion editor of BBW magazine after her stint with Spiegel. By the mid-1990s, all For You from Spiegel retail locations had closed. In 1995, Lane Bryant began a transformation of the brand which included large-scale fashion showings and celebrity endorsement. Queen Latifah, Mia Tyler, Camryn Manheim, Anna Nicole Smith and Chris Noth have appeared in advertising and/or events on behalf of the brand. Lane Bryant held a large-scale lingerie fashion show to launch the \\"Cacique Intimates\\" lingerie collection on 1 February 2000. The 2003 final large-scale catwalk show featured Roseanne Barr as Matron of Ceremonies in a cabaret setting complete with Moulin Rouge-style singers and dancers. Lane Bryant was acquired by Charming Shoppes for $335 million in August 2001. In 2003 a cost-reduction plan was announced to improve the company's pre-tax position by $45 million. Shortly afterwards, the annual Lane Bryant fashion show ceased production. With strong cooperation from Wilhelmina 10/20, Curves and Ford 12+ agencies, MODE magazine, was launched in the spring of 1997. No other fashion magazine specifically targeted the plus-size consumer with a Vogue-like fashion philosophy. MODE's editorial practice of providing models' names, sometimes attached to quotes on self-esteem to make them more approachable, greatly aided the popularity of the models and gave them a form of celebrity. The magazine also received industry acclaim, being named the best new magazine launch by Ad Week and Advertising Age in 1997. MODE ran model search competitions in conjunction with the Wilhelmina modeling agency, drawing entries from thousands of hopefuls from the US and Canada. Occurring shortly before the time of MODEs closure was the failure of several designers' ventures into the plus-size market. Versace (GV Versatile Couture), Valentino (Carisma), and others ceased producing the clothing which MODE relied upon, leaving an unfortunate deficit in the fashion department wardrobes and advertising revenue coffers of MODE magazine and its successors. Its circulation was approximately 600,000 at the time of its demise in late 2001. Grace Magazine was launched on 14 May 2002 by MODE magazine's last executive editor, Ceslie Armstrong, and many of the ex-MODE staff as an independent quarterly publication and website under a similar concept. Even though the initial 400,000 print run sold out quickly and advertising revenue appeared high, the independent status and limited funding prohibited the ability to grow to fill the newsstand and subscription orders. Critics, however, believed that Grace featured far less stylish fashion content than its predecessor and unwisely pursued an editorial emphasis on weight-related health issues. Grace Magazine ceased operation due to lack of funding in November 2003, after publishing 10 issues. Charming Shoppes' custom advertorial magazine, Figure, was launched in 2002 and was revamped during 2006. Although it featured only Charming Shoppes' own products and related lifestyle articles, it remained the only fashion and lifestyle print magazine specifically targeted for plus-size consumers until its announced closure after the publication of the March/April 2009 issue. U.S. television program America's Next Top Model has featured contestantsRobin Manning/Cycle 1, Anna Bradfield/Cycle 2, Toccara Jones/Cycle 3, Diane Hernandez/Cycle 5, Diana Zalewski/Cycle 8, Whitney Cunningham/Cycle 8, Sarah Hartshorne/Cycle 9, Whitney Thompson/Cycle 10, Kortnie Coles/Cycle 12, Alexandra Underwood/Cycle 14, Seymone Cohen-Fobish/Cycle 18, Louise Watts/Cycle 18, Yvonne Powless/Cycle 19, Chlea Ramirez/Cycle 20, Ivana Thomas/Cycle 24, Liz Woodbury/Cycle 24, and Khrystyana Kazakova/Cycle 24 acknowledging the plus-size industry's relevance to fashion since the show's launch in 2003. After elimination from the competition several of the contestants have signed contracts with the Wilhelmina agency, although only Kortnie Coles, Diane Hernandez, Toccara Jones, Whitney Thompson, Yvonne Powless, Khrystyana Kazakova, Liz Woodbury, and Alexandra Underwood have successfully translated their TV celebrity into ongoing modeling careers. Several homegrown calendar projects featuring models over a U.S. size 12 were launched in 2007, including the well-publicized Luscious and Fenomenal Calendar products from North America. To date, no calendar has been successful enough to continue beyond its initial launch year. Plus Model Magazine, an online publication was launched in 2006 by Madeline Figueroa-Jones, a former plus-size model. The magazine features beauty and fashion editorials, beauty and fashion tips, modeling advice and interviews with plus-size celebrities as well as people working in all facets of the plus-size clothing industry. Plus Model Magazine launched an online podcast in 2008 hosted by model, actress and host Chenese Lewis, which has interviews with plus-size celebrities and people working in all facets of the plus-size clothing industry. The magazine gained attention in many media outlets worldwide by publishing an editorial commenting on body image and the fashion industry. The editorial featured plus-size model Katya Zharkova photographed nude alongside a straight-size model. Canadian magazine LOU LOU has included specifically produced bi-annual plus-size fashion inserts featuring editorials and product pages since 2008. Echoing the advertorial relationship of Figure to Lane Bryant, LouLous supplement features products from Reitmans group of plus-size apparel companies (Addition-Elle, MXM, Pennington's) on its pages. Vogue U.S. has faltered on the continued use of recognisable plus-size models for the annual \\"Shape Issue\\" (April) issue; however British vocalist Adele appeared on the March 2012 cover as the first overtly larger-sized cover subject since sportsman LeBron James in April 2008. U.S. Glamour has declared it will feature more plus-size models as editorial policy after the appearance of a small photograph of model Lizzie Miller caused a groundswell of positive comment. Elle Quebec featured plus-size models three times on its cover: in May 1997, May 2013 and June 2014. High fashion print publication V magazine featured seven agency-represented plus- size models in \\"The Size Issue\\" #63, photographed by prominent fashion photographers.Curves Ahead by Solve Sundsbo, featuring Candice Huffine, Marquita Pring, Kasia Pilewicz, Michelle Olson and Tara LynnOne Size Fits All by Terry Richardson, featuring Crystal RennV love U just the way U R ‚Äì Terry Tsiolas, featuring Inga Eiriksdottir North American body care company, Dove, launched a \\"Real Beauty Campaign\\" where they included un-retouched photos of plus-size models, and models of all sizes, to emphasize the acceptance of all body shapes. = Origins in Europe = European magazines, including European editions of Elle and Vogue have featured plus size models on covers and in editorials. In France, the media Ma grande taille is dedicated to plus size industry and body positivity. Evans, a U.K.-based retailer, was founded in 1930. Evans specializes in plus-sized clothing, lingerie, shoes and swimwear. Max Mara started Marina Rinaldi, one of the first high-end clothing lines, for plus-size women in 1980. Marina Rinaldi started advertising in 1981. The line's campaigns were photographed by top photographers such as Richard Avedon, Patrick Demarchelier, Arthur Elgort, Greg Kadel, Peter Lindbergh, and Craig McDean, used top models and celebrities(including Carr√© Otis, Candice Huffine, Crystal Renn, and Kate Dillon Levin), and were featured in magazines and on billboards. The ads were also the first to use the term plus size rather than outsize in Europe. = Specialty model agency divisions = Cheryl Hughes founded Hughes models, the UK's first plus-size agency in 1985. Allison Bramwell Bewley, a former straight size and plus-size model founded Excel Models in 1995. The agency has represented notable models including Pollyanna McIntosh and Sara Morrison. Sarah Watkinson founded 12 + models in 2000. Former plus-size model Anna Shillinglaw founded the plus size division of Milk Management in 2011. These agents have been credited with improving visibility of plus-size models in Europe and developing some of the top plus-size models for international markets. In recent years, the most prestigious fashion agencies in the UK have launched plus size divisions. In 2011, Excel Models merged with Models 1, one of Europe's most prestigious fashion agencies. Storm Models started a plus size division, Curve in 2012. =Specialty media and other ventures in Europe= Several plus-size retailers in Europe have produced magazines. Marina Rinaldi started MR, a fashion magazine showing Marina Rinaldi fashions on plus-size models in 1992. The magazine is still in publication today. Evans, one of the UK's largest plus-size specialist retailers, launched Encore, an in-store fashion and lifestyle magazine published by Cond√© Nast in 1996. Yes!, a print fashion magazine for plus size women founded and edited by Janice Bhend, launched in 1993. At the time, Yes! was the only print magazine especially for plus size women in Europe. The magazine stopped publishing in 1998 due to a lack of funding. Fashion editor Rivkie Baum launched SLiNK, a fashion and lifestyle magazine for full-figured women in 2011. SLiNK is one of the few magazines focused on plus size women to photograph models with a Vogue-like aesthetic. The magazine began publishing in print for its fifth issue in March 2012. The magazine was also the first to feature a plus size model in a 3D editorial. SLiNK was also one of the few magazines to feature plus-size and smaller sized models on a magazine cover. European versions of Vogue and Elle have featured plus size models in many editorials, often photographed by top photographers. In 1997, British Vogue published an editorial with Sara Morrison photographed by Nick Knight. Vogue Italia featured plus size models on the cover of three issues. Sophie Dahl appeared on two covers in 2000(February and April). In June 2011, Candice Huffine, Robyn Lawley, and Tara Lynn appeared on the magazine's cover. The main editorial of the issue featured those three models plus Marquita Pring. Robyn Lawley also appeared in another editorial in that issue. Elle France has featured Tara Lynn on two covers in April 2010 and April 2012, and Robyn Lawley on their April 2011 cover. The April 2010 issue also included a 20-page spread with Lynn. Elle Italia has featured Crystal Renn on its April 2008 cover. Elle Belgium featured Deborah Dauchot on its May 2012 cover. In November 2013, Tara Lynn appeared on the cover of Elle Spain. In December 2013, Iris Monroe Baker appeared on the cover of Elle Netherlands. Other magazines that have featured plus size models on their covers include Amica, Avantgarde, Biba, D Reppublicca della Donna, i-D, and S Moda. In addition, magazines such as Bon, Diva e Donna, Gioia, Glamour UK, Glass, Grazia, Num√©ro, Paradis, Ponystep, and Yo Dona have featured plus size models in editorials. Britain & Ireland's Next Top Model has featured several contestants, including Louise Watts, who was Season 3's runner up and competed in America's Next Top Model Cycle 18. In 2016, Scandinavia's Next Top Model was rebooted as Top Model Curves, and all contestants featured were plus-size models from Denmark, Norway, and Sweden. Swede Ronja Manfredsson was declared the winner during the finale episode in Lisbon. = Origins in Asia and the Pacific = The plus size industry in Asia is not as developed as in North America or Europe, but a number of Asian plus size models have been featured in press. Australia has a developed industry with multiple designers and retailers using plus size models in advertising. In recent years, plus size agencies in Australia have launched the careers of several international plus size models, such as Robyn Lawley. = Specialty agencies and divisions = Former plus-size model Darrianne Donnelly founded the first plus size agency in Australia, BigGals Models, which was renamed to BGM Models in 1996. BGM Models closed in 2015 due to Donnelly's retirement, with the majority of models moving to the new Curves division at the established full service agency Vivien's Models. Chelsea Bonner, a former BGM model, left the agency to start Bella Models in 2000 in direct competition. Bonner is often credited with the discovery of Robyn Lawley as a model, although Lawley had already been modelling at a smaller size before joining Bella. =Specialty media and other ventures in Asia and Pacific Region= In April 1997, Emme appeared on a cover of New Woman, the first appearance of a plus-size model on an Australian magazine cover. In May 2000, Australian Cosmopolitan began using plus-size models in fashion feature spreads. Natalie Wakeling appeared in the first May 2000 editorial.

Elena Miro produced a pr√™t-√†-porter runway show in China featuring Asian models in 2006. Criticism The plus-size modelling industry has received general criticism on the premise that acceptance of plus-size models sets a poor health example of weight management. Consumer-based criticism regarding the lower sizes of plus-size models is becoming commonplace and wide-spread. While the reputed 'average' dress size of an American woman is size 14, the majority of models represented as plus-size are between a US size 6-12; therefore the models do not reflect the average consumer size. Plus-size models engage in unhealthy habits such as eating salty foods to retain water weight and fluctuating size to please clients. Agents have suggested plastic surgery to some models. German fashion designer Karl Lagerfeld and other fashion designers have deferred on the use of plus-size models through a lack of interest in the consumers associated with the term plus-size. Lagerfeld in particular has been vocal on the matter of his preferred clientele: \\"What I designed was fashion for slender and slim people\\" and received criticism for demanding that mass retailer H&M; not produce their collaboration designs to size 16. In addition, the industry has been criticized for lacking in racial diversity. For example, critics have noted that there are few Asian plus size models. Others have noted that there are few black plus-size models with darker skin tones. In February 2015, Australian model Stefania Ferrario and television presenter Ajay Rochester began a campaign to end the use of the term \\"plus size\\" to describe models who are above a US dress size 4 by the modelling industry. Ferrario posted a picture with the caption \\"I am a model FULL STOP\\" with the hashtag \\"#droptheplus\\" which gained coverage in the media and was heavily discussed, with mixed, but mostly positive reactions, on social media and within the fashion industry.

The earliest associations of the U√≠ Ceinnselaig are with the region around Rathvilly, County Carlow, and the headwaters of the River Slaney, but in time the centre of their power was pushed southwards, later being found around Ferns, County Wexford, site of the monastery of the saint M√°ed√≥c of Ferns (d. 626 or 632).

Statement of the lemma Let the real line have its standard topology. Then every open subset of the real line is a countable union of open intervals. Generalized Statement  Lindel√∂f's lemma is also known as the statement that every open cover in a second-countable space has a countable subcover (Kelley 1955:49). This means that every second-countable space is also a Lindel√∂f space. Proof of the generalized statement  Consider B=\\\\\\\\{\\\\beta : \\\\beta \\\\text{ is an element of basis} \\\\\\\\}. Since X is of a countable base, we consider it as B=\\\\left \\\\\\\\{ \\\\beta_1, \\\\beta_2, \\\\cdots \\\\right \\\\\\\\} to infinity. Consider an open cover, \\\\mathcal{F} = \\\\bigcup_{\\\\alpha} U_{\\\\alpha}. To get prepared for the following deduction, we define two sets for convenience, B_{\\\\alpha} := \\\\left \\\\\\\\{ \\\\beta \\\\in B: \\\\beta \\\\subset U_{\\\\alpha} \\\\right \\\\\\\\}, B':= \\\\bigcup_{\\\\alpha} B_{\\\\alpha}. A straight-forward but essential observation is that, U_{\\\\alpha} = \\\\bigcup_{\\\\beta \\\\in B_{\\\\alpha}} \\\\beta which is from the definition of base.

Cooper is a 1981 American crime thriller film about infamous aircraft hijacker D. B. Cooper, who escaped with $200,000 after leaping from the back of a Boeing 727 airliner on November 24, 1971. The bulk of the film fictionalizes Cooper's escape after he landed on the ground. Plot In 1971, the hijacker, identified as \\"D.B. Cooper\\", jumps from an airliner by using the rear exit. He jumps on a clear day, parachuting into a forest in Washington State. The man is later identified as Jim Meade, an ex- Army man with big dreams. Meade escapes the manhunt using a Jeep he had previously hidden in the forest and concealing the money in the carcass of a deer. He eventually meets up with his estranged wife Hannah, who operates a river rafting company. Meanwhile, Meade is being hunted by Bill Gruen, an insurance investigator who was Meade's sergeant in the Army, and Meade's Army buddy, Remson, who remembered Meade talking about hijacking an aircraft. Gruen confronts the Meades at the rafting company, but they escape down the river. The Meades lead Gruen and Remson on a cross-country chase involving various stolen cars. Gruen is fired by his employer, but continues the chase to claim the money for himself. At the aircraft boneyard near Tucson, Arizona, the Meades acquire a hot-air balloon, but Gruen steals the money from Hannah. Meade chases him down with a barely functioning Boeing-Stearman PT-17 crop duster biplane. Meade runs Gruen off the road but crashes his aircraft. Recovering from the wrecks, Meade has Gruen's gun and for a few minutes, they discuss how Gruen knew that Meade was D. B. Cooper. Along with clues he had left, the previous encounters between the two men in the Army had convinced Gruen that only Meade could have pulled off the audacious hijacking. Meade leaves Gruen with a couple bundles of the cash, and walks away with the rest, to be picked up by Hannah. With Gruen abandoning the pursuit, it is up to Remson to try to recover the stolen money. When he reaches a crossroads the Meades have just passed, thinking he sees their truck parked nearby, Remson continues the chase. Cast * Robert Duvall as Sgt. Bill Gruen * Treat Williams as D.B.

B. Cooper was based on American poet J.D. Reed's 1980 novel, Free Fall: A Novel.Reed 1980, p. 3. Jeffrey Alan Fiskin wrote the original script. John Frankenheimer was the original director, but he was replaced by Buzz Kulik after shooting one sequence. Kulik finished the film. W.D. Richter worked on the script uncredited. The producers then asked editor-director Roger Spottiswoode to shoot a big new stunt and edit the film. Spottiswoode said the movie was \\"doomed\\" unless he could shoot new sequences, to be written by Ron Shelton who would be credited as \\"associate producer\\". In the end Spottiswood-Shelton scenes comprised 70% of the finished film. According to one writer, the new team \\"added new characters - a rural rogue's gallery of scam artists - and an end-of-the-hippie era feeling. Even when editing the existing material, the new writer and director changed the film thematically, dramatically, cinematically.\\" The Kulik movie was a \\"banal, dour Vietnam vet docudrama\\" where Meade concocts the scheme to escape a postwar malaise and gets upset when he wins the acclaim as a hijacker that eluded him as a veteran. The Shelton-Spotiswoode movie was more of a chase comedy \\"about a man who returns home and plans to get himself the easy money that's part of the American dream for him and for all the low-lifes he meets along the way (including a Nam comrade who returns to haunt Meade like a comic Javert).\\" Only Jeffrey Allan Fiskin was awarded credit.Sragow, M.

It was named after Lt. T.L. Chadbourne, who was killed in the Battle of Resaca de la Palma. It was manned by Companies A and K of the 8th U.S. Infantry. During the early days of the American Civil War, the fort surrendered to the Confederates on February 28, 1861, even before the Confederate shelling of Fort Sumter, South Carolina, but was reoccupied by federal troops from 1865 to 1867. Other forts in the frontier fort system were Forts Griffin, Concho, Belknap, Richardson, Stockton, Davis, Bliss, Mason, McKavett, Clark, McIntosh, Inge, and Phantom Hill in Texas, and Fort Sill in Oklahoma.Carter, R.G., On the Border with Mackenzie, 1935, Washington D.C.: Enyon Printing Co. \\"Sub posts or intermediate stations\\" also were used, including Bothwick's Station on Salt Creek between Fort Richardson and Fort Belknap, Camp Wichita near Buffalo Springs between Fort Richardson and Red River Station, and Mountain Pass between Fort Concho and Fort Griffin.

It served in the Western Theater, predominantly in Louisiana and Florida, from February 1862 to March 1866. It was the longest serving Vermont regiment during the war. Seventh Vermont Regiment was mustered into Federal service on February 12, 1862, at Rutland, Vermont. It was engaged in, or present at, the 1862 first Siege of Vicksburg, Battle of Baton Rouge, Battle of Gonzales Station, the Mobile Campaign and Spanish Fort, and Whistler, Alabama. Western theater The Regiment proceeded from Rutland on March 10, 1862, to New York City, boarding the sailing ships \\"Premier\\" and \\"Tammerlane,\\" and sailed to Ship Island (Mississippi). The Premier arrived April 5 and Tammerlane on the 10th. On May 3, Companies B, C, and part of D boarded the gunboats USS New London and USS Calhoun and were sent to capture Fort Pike, which guarded the entrance to Lake Pontchartrain. They found the Confederates had just evacuated the fort. They occupied it without opposition and set about repairing the damage inflicted by the Confederates as they left. The rest of the regiment was shipped to Carrollton, New Orleans, on the Steamer \\"Whitman.\\" On May 15, 1862, the Regiment, minus those at Fort Pike, sailed on the \\"Iberville\\" to Baton Rouge. On June 19, 1862, eight companies boarded the steamers \\"Ceres\\" and \\"Morning Light\\" for the ill-conceived and under-manned expedition to lay siege to Vicksburg, Mississippi, arriving near Vicksburg on the 25th. The Siege of Vicksburg was abandoned on July 24, and the Regiment returned to Baton Rouge on July 26, with 100 of the 800 men who went up the river still fit for duty. The Battle of Baton Rouge took place on August 5, 1862, a very foggy day. Many units fired on other Union troops, with the 7th firing, on orders of Brigadier General Thomas Williams, into the neighboring 21st Indiana Regiment. During the battle, Williams was killed and the 7th's Commander, Colonel George T. Roberts, was mortally wounded, dying two days later. The Confederate attack was defeated. Before the battle, no preparations, such as digging entrenchments, nor any defensive plans were made, despite the knowledge that CS General Breckinridge had a large force nearby. After the battle, General Benjamin Butler directed blame for Union confusion and poor performance on the 7th, including firing on other Union troops and withdrawing from the front lines during the battle. The \\"withdrawal\\" was the evacuation of the hospital, including a large number of 7th Vermont troops, to the river bank to keep them safe. The allegations of Butler poisoned his relations with the Regiment, whose Officers were aware of Butler's continued Presidential ambitions. It was their opinion that Butler, though he wasn't at the battle, might be blamed for the poor performance of the troops in the battle and decided to scapegoat the Vermont Regiment because it represented the least politically powerful State that had troops in the battle. Butler forbade the Regiment permission to put the battle honor \\"Baton Rouge\\" on their battle flag and prohibited their carrying the colors. Permission to carry was later restored. On August 20, 1862, Baton Rouge was evacuated, and the 7th returned to Carrollton. Florida campaign Butler became aware that the commander of the forts south of Pensacola, Florida, was not happy with the conduct and performance of one of his regiments, so 7th Vermont was sent there in exchange for the 6th New York Volunteer Infantry (Wilson's Zouaves). The Regiment boarded the steam tugboat \\"Nassau\\" on November 13, 1862, arriving in Escambia Bay the next day. The Regiment performed garrison duties at Fort Barrancas and Fort Pickens from November 1862 until August 1864. In early February a detail of Company B established an outpost at Point Washington, Florida on Choctawhatchee Bay to receive refugees and runaway slaves. They would be sent to the forts where white males would be enlisted in the 1st Florida Cavalry Regiment (Union) and male slaves into the 82nd or 86 U.S. Colored Infantry. On February 8, a detachment proceeded to Haine's Bluff where they captured Company E, 4th Florida Infantry Battalion without firing a shot. Before they could return to Point Washington, they were run down by Company A, and a detachment of Company E, 5th Florida Cavalry Battalion that freed the prisoners and captured half of the Union troops involved in the raid. After this the outpost at Point Washington was abandoned. On February 13, 1864, 110 new recruits arrived from Vermont. During February, soldiers of the 7th reenlisted for three years or the duration of the War and had their designation changed to 7th Regiment Vermont Veteran Volunteers. On July 21, 1864, a Union force, including four companies of the 7th, engaged CS forces in the Battle of Gonzales Station (also known as Fort Hodgson). Mobile campaign On August 10, 1864, the 7th (without the new recruits) boarded the steamer \\"Hudson\\" to travel back to Vermont for a reenlistment furlough, arriving in Brattleboro August 26. The Regiment reassembling there on 27 September 1864. They departed on the 30th and arrived in New York City on October 1, boarding the steamer \\"Cassandra\\" on October 3 for New Orleans, and arriving there on the 13th. Seventh Vermont was part of Gen. Gordon Granger's 13th Corps. for the Mobile Campaign, participating in the Siege of Spanish Fort, a battle at Whistler, Alabama, and the surrender of the CS Army of Mobile at Citronelle, Alabama. During the Siege of Spanish fort the 7th was assigned to the siege of Fort McDermett. During that siege the Captain and 20 men of Company K were captured and sent to a POW camp. Texas assignment On May 30, 1865, the Regiment boarded the steamer \\"Starlight\\" for Mobile, where the men were transferred to the steamer \\"General Sedgwick\\" and shipped to Texas. They arrived June 5 to become part of the \\"Army of Observation\\" along the Rio Grande, keeping an eye on Maximilian's French Army there. They were officially mustered out on March 14, 1866, traveling as a group back to Brattleboro, where the unit disbanded on April 6, 1866. Summary Seventh Vermont lost during its term of service 11 men killed and mortally wounded, 15 dead from accident, 6 dead in Confederate prisons, and 379 dead of disease, for a campaign loss of 411 men, plus another 242 discharged for disability, primarily from disease, reaching a total of 649.

Formed in Leicester in 1994, the band's early intensity (angular, noisy, post-hardcore influences were the most evident at this point) and musical ambition (often undermined by a semi-notorious degree of equipment failure and breakdown), earned them a combination of admiration, sympathy, and disdain on the Midlands scene. History The band's debut single Sea Sore Songs was released on Amberley/ Cleverlegs. It was already a historical artifact, both in terms of the band's sound and the post-rock scene that had supported it. The band had other early releases on Bearos Records and Sorted, both midlands based. The band had a good relationship the now-defunct Guildford label, Words and Works Rejected. As the band developed (and relaxed a little), and the line-up changed and then settled, Lazarus Clamp began to allow other influences to show through - English folk music, American country, and some rather deadpan humour. Subsequent singles (\\"North\\", \\"Left-handed\\", \\"Some Rivals\\") and the band's first two LPs (Such as you are and still not seeming to mind and The more we are the funnier it is) provide a better snapshot of Lazarus Clamp's literate, spontaneous, scruffy, and very English, take on their ragbag of influences. These releases are a beguiling, and sometimes frustrating, combination of precisely-executed, off-beat 'alt- pop/unrock', peppered with lo-fi home recordings, and off-the-cuff improvised meanderings. The band's willingness to fall on their faces, and their musical and verbal articulacy when they pull things together, are probably their greatest virtues. In early 2008, they released a double album, Death to Technicians / It ain't what you do it's what it does to you, described by Drowned in Sound as 'wonkily elaborate' and in late 2009, they released the Against entitlement LP. This received positive reviews from sources as diverse as The Sunday Times, and Delusions of Adequacy. Live Never prolific in their live outings, Lazarus Clamp are still active. The band now live in different parts of the UK, making live appearances rarer. The band have appeared and collaborated with Bob Tilton, John Sims, Los Planetos Del Agua, MJ Hibbett, Last Harbour, Half Seas Over, Twinkie and The Freed Unit. Influence An easy-going DIY ethic has made them popular with sound engineers, fanzines and fellow musicians, but largely invisible to promoters, labels and the press.

It served in both major theaters, first in Louisiana and then in Virginia, from February 1862 to June 1865. It was a member of the XIX Corps. The regiment was mustered into Federal service on February 18, 1862, at Brattleboro, Vermont. It was engaged in, or present at, the Occupation of New Orleans, Raceland, Boutte Station, Bayou des Allemands, the Steamer \\"Cotton,\\" Bisland, and Port Hudson, in the Department of the Gulf, and Opequon, Fisher's Hill, Cedar Creek, and Newtown in the Shenandoah Valley campaign.Benedict, George Grenville, \\"The Eighth Regiment\\", Vermont in the Civil War, Free Press Association, Burlington, Vermont, 1888. A notable member of this regiment is Captain Squire E. Howard, a recipient of the Medal of Honor. New Orleans After the Union captured New Orleans, it enlisted a number of German-Americans who had been Louisiana citizens. In October 1862, 130 men from the 8th were captured along with seven German-Americans. The Confederates determined that these Germans had been enlisted in the Confederate Army and were therefore traitors. They were forced to dig their own graves, then were shot. The remainder of the prisoners were well-treated and eventually paroled. Port Hudson It moved with the XIX Corps to take Port Hudson, Louisiana, in April 1863. In the battle which followed on May 27, it lost 12 men, including the brigade commander, and had 76 wounded.  Battle of Cedar Creek  During the Battle of Cedar Creek, the 8th Vermont Infantry played a critical role in the fighting. In the early morning fog of 19 October 1864, confederates crossed Cedar Creek near Strasburg, Virginia, and attacked Union forces in their camps. After routing the Union's VIII Corps, the Confederate attack struck at the XIX Corps. While the XIX Corps fought back from entrenched position, a second Confederate Corps joined the battle flanking their trenches. In order to escape the trap Brigadier General William H. Emory, commander of the XIX Corps, ordered the 2nd Brigade of his First Division to move forward, engage, and delay the two Confederate Corps.Whitehouse, Joseph W.A., Battle of Cedar Creek: Self-Guide Tour, (Revised Edition of publication by Center for Military History) Shenandoah Valley Battlefield Foundation, Middletown, Virginia, 2006. At the time of the battle, the 2nd Brigade was composed of four under-strength units, the 47th Pennsylvania Infantry Regiment, the 12th Connecticut Infantry, the 160th New York Infantry, and the 8th Vermont Infantry. The brigade was commanded by Colonel Stephen Thomas, who had previously commanded the 8th Vermont. As ordered, the brigade advanced several hundred yards beyond the Federal lines and engaged the vastly superior Confederate forces in brutal hand-to-hand combat. Their stubborn fight held up the Confederate attack for thirty minutes, allowing the rest of the XIX Corps to withdraw and join forces with the VI Corps about a mile to their rear near Belle Grove Plantation. The 47th Pennsylvania Infantry, on the Brigade's extreme right flank, was almost immediately overrun, hindered by a dense fog and Union 8th Corps men fleeing through its line. They were pinned down in a ravine and systematically decimated as their black knapsacks stood out in the swirling fog. As mounting casualties reduced the 2nd Brigade's combat effectiveness, Col. Thomas successfully withdrew his brigade, the 8th Vermont Infantry being the last unit to withdraw. 8th Vermont monument at Cedar Creek BattlefieldIn this short engagement, the casualty rates were extremely high in all of the 2nd Brigade units, especially the 8th Vermont. Of 164 Vermont men, 110 were killed or wounded along with 13 of their 16 officers. The fight was described by one Vermont veteran: Suddenly a mass of rebels confronted the flags, and with hoarse shouts demanded their surrender. Defiant shouts went back. ‚ÄúNever!‚Äù ‚ÄúNever!‚Äù A rebel soldier then leveled his musket and shot Corporal Petre, who held the colors. He cried out: ‚ÄúBoys, leave me; take care of yourselves and the flag!‚Äù But in that vortex of hell men did not forget the colors; and as Petrie fell and crawled away to die, they were instantly seized and borne aloft by Corporal Perham, and were as quickly demanded again by a rebel who eagerly attempted to grasp them; but Sergeant Shores of the guard placed his musket at the man's breast and fired, instantly killing him. But now another flash, and a cruel bullet from the dead rebel's companion killed Corporal Perham, and the colors fell to the earth. Once more, amide terrific yells, the colors went up, this time held by Corporal Blanchard‚Äîand the carnage went on. (George H. Carpenter, 8th Vermont) Despite the heavy fighting and the loss of three color bearers, the 8th Vermont Infantry did not give up their flag and withdrew in good order. Falling back slowly, they rejoin the rest of the XIX Corps around Belle Grove plantation. The 8th Vermont continued to fight all day, ultimately helping to turn the dawn route at Cedar Creek into a major Union victory.Green, A. Wilson (\\"Will\\") and Joseph W.A. Whitehouse, site lecture, Pamplin Historic Park tour, 15 May 2008. In 1883, a monument of Vermont marble was placed at the site where the 8th Vermont made their stand. The monument was paid for by Herbert E. Hill, a Vermont businessman who wanted to honor his state's Civil War heroes. The monument is located in its original place on the battlefield about 150 yards east of the Valley Pike, now U.S. Route 11 between Middletown and Strasburg, Virginia. The monument was well maintained under recent private ownership. In 2012, the property was acquired by Cedar Creek and Belle Grove National Historical Park, which provides visitor access, though currently only through ranger-led programs.8th Vermont Memorial, near Strasburg, Virginia, dedicated September 1883.  Casualties  Cedar Creek was the last active engagement in which the 8th Vermont Infantry Regiment participated. During the course of the war a total of 1,772 men served in the 8th Vermont Infantry. Of that number, the unit lost during its term of service: 104 men killed and mortally wounded, 8 died from accident, 20 died in Confederate prisons, and 213 died from disease; for a total loss of 345 men. The regiment mustered out of service on June 28, 1865. Notable members *John L. Barstow, later Governor, served in the 8th VermontGeorge N.

Built in New York City  General Bragg was originally the 1043-ton side-wheel river steamer Mexico and was built in New York City in 1851. She was owned by the Southern Steamship Co. at the start of the American Civil War  Service as CSS General Bragg  CSS General Bragg participating in the battle of Fort Pillow Mexico was pressed into Confederate service as CSS General Bragg at New Orleans, Louisiana 15 January 1862. She was converted to a \\"cottonclad\\" ram and renamed for General Braxton Bragg, a western theater commander. As part of the River Defense Fleet, she took part in the defenses of Memphis, Tennessee, and the surrounding area. In an action off Fort Pillow on 10 May 1862 she helped sink the Union Navy ironclad (later raised and refitted) and was put out of action herself. On 6 June, she was run aground and captured during the naval battle off Memphis. After repairs, she became USS General Bragg. Service as the USS General Bragg Following General Bragg's capture by the Union's Western Flotilla, she was transferred to the War Department 30 September 1862. Her first commanding officer was Lieutenant Joshua Bishop. General Bragg was fitted out at Cairo, Illinois, departing 9 July 1862 for Helena, Arkansas. She sailed 16 August 1862 as part of an escort to steamer Iatan carrying 500 troops to the mouth of the Yazoo River for reconnaissance of Confederate batteries and guerrilla parties. For the next 15 months, except for periods of repair at Memphis, Tennessee, she patrolled the river from Helena to the mouth of the Yazoo River, where she guarded against Confederate movements toward Vicksburg, Mississippi. = Red River operations = With the fall of Vicksburg in July 1863, General Bragg remained in the vicinity until her departure 13 December, for her new station at the mouth of the Red River. During the spring of 1864, it was her duty to guard the mouth of the river in support of the joint expedition against Shreveport, Louisiana on the Red. She began patrolling the river again, and 15 June engaged a Confederate battery with Naiad near Tunica Bend, Louisiana. Per the later captured battle flag of Barlow's Battery, now preserved at the Illinois National Guard Museum, thirty- two rounds were fired at the General Bragg. For a time the ships got the worst of the action amid a hail of shot and musketry, but eventually drove off the Confederates with the help of Winnebago. General Bragg was disabled in the action. The remainder of General Bragg's career was spent patrolling the Mississippi from the mouth of the Red River to Natchez, Mississippi. Infrequently she cruised as far south as Baton Rouge, Louisiana and New Orleans, Louisiana.  Post-war decommissioning and subsequent career  The ship returned to Mound City, Illinois, 2 July 1865, and decommissioned at Cairo 24 July 1865. She was sold 1 September 1865, she was redocumented Mexico. She was employed for U.S. civilian purposes until 1870, when she was sold to foreign interests.

Each glucose monomer is linked via a beta-1,4 glycosidic bond. The most common cellodextrins are listed below: * cellobiose (DP=2) (sometimes not included in cellodextrin classification) * cellotriose (DP=3) * cellotetraose (DP=4) * cellopentaose (DP=5) * cellohexaose (DP=6) Function Cellodextrins are created through the cleavage of cellulose in most anaerobic bacteria by the cellulosome (an amalgamation of cellulolytic enzymes on the outside of a cell). An endoglucanase first cuts the crystalline cellulose in an amorphous zone and exoglucanases subsequently cleave these large insoluble chunks of cellulose into smaller, soluble cellodextrins which can be used by the cell. Many cellulolytic bacteria use cellodextrins as their primary source of energy. The energy is obtained through the phosphorolytic cleavage of glycosidic bonds as well as the anaerobic glycolysis of the glucose monomers. Transport of cellodextrins across the cell membrane is usually an active process, requiring ATP.

History =Founding= Oc√© started in 1877 as a family business manufacturing machines for coloring butter and margarine. The company's founder, chemist Lodewijk van der Grinten, supplied this coloring to farmers and then this was supplied to the margarine factories of Jurgens and Van den Bergh. In 1930, the margarine factories of Jurgens and Van den Bergh and the English Lever Brothers merged to become Unilever. From 1877 to 1972, Unilever used only the coloring produced by the Venlo factory in its margarine. In 1919 the grandson of Lodewijk, Louis van der Grinten, became interested in the blueprint process used for producing wide-format technical drawings. At that time, blueprint paper was extremely light-sensitive, and had a very short shelf life. Louis invented a coating that made blueprint paper last up to a year. This is considered the company's first step into providing document solutions. =Company milestones= *1919: Louis van der Grinten conducted research into blueprint materials and entered the copier market.

In contrast to the earlier paper, the new paper had no so-called azo components. To emphasize this user-friendly aspect compared with the competitors, Van der Grinten called the paper O.C. (Ohne Componente). *1927: Because the local stock exchange required three letter abbreviations, the company was renamed in 1927 as Oc√©, based on the initials O.C. for \\"Ohne Componente\\" (without components).This product name became the brand name and was registered as a trademark in 1930. *1930s: Introduction of the \\"Combine\\", a machine that combines two functions of the copying process ‚Äì developing and drying.

The castle keep dates from the 14th century, and the remaining structures were added piecemeal until the 18th century. The keep has been recently restored, although other parts of the castle are roofless ruins. Balgonie, excepting the tower which is used for residential purposes, is a Scheduled Ancient Monument. History The lands of Balgonie were held by the Sibbalds from at least 1246. Probably in the 1360s, the Sibbalds built a barmkin, or fortified courtyard, with a tower house at the north-west corner. The lands and the castle were left to a daughter, who married Sir Robert Lundie, who extended the castle in 1496, following his appointment as Lord High Treasurer of Scotland. Sir Robert built a two-storey range of buildings to the east of the keep, enlarging the accommodation with a long hall and a solar. This range incorporated an earlier corner tower and the 14th-century chapel. King James IV visited Balgonie on 20 August 1496, and gave 18 shillings to the masons as a gift.Accounts Lord High Treasurer of Scotland, vol.1 (1877), 290. In 1627 the castle was sold to the Boswells, who sold it on in 1635 to Sir Alexander Leslie, a Scottish soldier who had fought for the Swedish army during the Thirty Years' War (1618-1648), rising to the rank of Field Marshal, and who led the Covenanters during the Scottish Bishops Wars. Leslie was created Lord Balgonie and Earl of Leven in 1641, and finally retired in 1654. He carried out further improvement of his home, adding a two-storey building at the south-east corner of the courtyard. The initials FSAL and DAR, for Field Marshal Sir Alexander Leslie, and his wife Dame Agnes Renton, were found inscribed within the south-east block, suggesting that this was built prior to Leslie's elevation to the peerage. He also rebuilt the late 15th century north range with an extra storey, and laid out a park around the castle, remnants of which remain. Etching of the castle by James Fittler from Scotia Depicta, published 1804 The next additions were carried out by John Leslie, 7th Earl of Rothes, who disputed the earldom of Leven with David Melville following the death of the second earl in 1664. Lord Rothes, with the aid of John Mylne junior, the king's master mason, built a grand stair linking the keep and north range, where previously a wooden bridge stood. On his death in 1681 David Melville inherited Balgonie, along with the earldom of Leven. He too added a range of buildings in 1706, this time a three-storey section linking the north range with the south-east block. The work was completed by master mason Gilbert Smith. Rob Roy MacGregor captured Balgonie Castle during a raid in 1716, although the castle was soon returned to the Melvilles. David Melville, 6th Earl of Leven made minor improvements in the 1720s, including the insertion of sash windows. Further buildings were also added within the courtyard. The west elevation of the tower house or keep The roofless east range In 1824 the castle was sold to James Balfour of Whittingehame, father of James Maitland Balfour, and grandfather of Arthur Balfour, who served as British Prime Minister from 1902-1905. He was unable to arrest the decay which was advancing, and in the mid nineteenth century the roofs were removed to avoid paying tax on the property. Much vandalism occurred in the 1960s, and it was not until 1971 that restoration of the castle, then owned by David Maxwell, began. Work continued through the 1970s and 1980s, aided by European funding as part of European Architectural Heritage Year, in 1975. The keep and chapel have now been fully restored, and the castle is once again occupied; its current owner is Raymond Morris, originally of Walsall, and his family. The castle is open to the public, and the restored chapel and great hall can be hired for events such as weddings. The owners have expressed their intent to continue the restoration of the entire building. Architecture Plan of Balgonie Castle with approximate dates of construction The castle is still entered via the 15th century gatehouse. This is semi-ruinous above ground level, but a guardroom and prison can be seen within. The gate opens onto a courtyard, containing a well, around which the buildings are arranged. The ground and first floors of the keep are vaulted, the first floor containing the hall, which unusually had no great fireplace. This would originally have been entered via a moveable timber stair, prior to the construction of the present stone stair. Above the hall are two further floors, each with a fireplace and connected by a turnpike stair. The keep is topped by a pitched roof with crow stepped gables. Outside, the parapet walk and cannon spouts are of 17th-century origin, and contemporary with the enlarged windows. Some of the smaller trefoil-headed original windows survive. In the basement of the north range is the vaulted chapel, although the remainder of the range, and the east buildings, are roofless. Walls and chimney stacks remain. The remains of earlier buildings within the courtyard were uncovered during excavations in 1978. It appears that these were demolished in the early 17th century to allow rebuilding.Reported in the NMRS Archaeology Notes for the site . Beyond the castle walls, the extensive boundary walls of the deer park survive, although damaged in parts. Large mature trees remain from the 17th century landscaping. Hauntings Several hauntings have been reported within the castle. One spectre, nicknamed 'Green Jeanie', is said to be the ghost of one of the Lundie occupants. A 17th-century soldier, a dog, and a hooded man have also been claimed to be seen. A skeleton was found in the floor of the great hall, during works in 1912.Hauntings are described in Coventry, 2001.

Development of \\"Easy\\" began when the American rock band Orson discovered that the Sugababes were working on the album, in which they proposed ideas for new tracks. They subsequently wrote the song with the group, and produced it. Backed by bass synthesizers, it is an uptempo electropop song that features metaphorical lyrical content containing sexual euphemisms. The song is the group's first single to feature written contributions from then-new member Amelle Berrabah, who had previously sung on re-recorded versions of three songs from the album Taller in More Ways, including the singles \\"Red Dress\\" and \\"Follow Me Home\\". Critics praised the lyrics and bass synthesizer of \\"Easy\\", although some regarded the song as forgettable in comparison to the group's previous singles. The song peaked at number five on the Slovakian Singles Chart and number eight on the UK Singles Chart. It reached the top twenty on the charts in Denmark, Finland, Ireland and Norway. The song's music video was directed by Tim Royes and filmed in a public toilet at a club in Romford. It features the Sugababes dressed in latex outfits, where they appear in separate toilet cubicles. The group performed \\"Easy\\" to promote the release of Overloaded: The Singles Collection. Background and release The Sugababes confirmed in June 2006 that a greatest hits album would be released in time for Christmas of that year. The album, titled Overloaded: The Singles Collection, was confirmed to contain two brand new tracks called \\"Easy\\" and \\"Good to Be Gone\\". \\"Easy\\" was written by Jason Pebworth and George Astasio, both members of American rock band Orson, in collaboration with the Sugababes‚ÄîKeisha Buchanan, Heidi Range and Amelle Berrabah. It was produced by Brio Taliaferro, Pebworth and Astasio. Orson, who shared the same management with the Sugababes, discovered that the group had begun writing material for their new album. They visited the studio with the Sugababes and offered ideas for new tracks, which the group enjoyed. Buchanan spoke upon the Sugababes' involvement with the song by saying that they \\"went into the studio separately\\" and \\"changed things around\\". \\"Easy\\" was mixed by Jeremy Wheatley for 365 Artists at Twenty-One Studios in London, with assistance from Richard Edgeler. Release \\"Easy\\" was released on 6 November 2006, one week prior to the release of Overloaded: The Singles Collection. Range stated that the Sugababes enjoyed the song as soon as they heard it, and were convinced that it would be the lead single from the greatest hits collection. The digital download was released on the iTunes Store on 6 November 2006. The CD single was released on the same day, although features a B-side titled \\"Shake It\\". Another CD version of \\"Easy\\" contains a Seamus Haji & Paul Emanuel remix of the song, a dubstremental version of this remix, and a live V Festival performance of the group's 2003 number one hit \\"Hole in the Head\\". An Ultrabeat remix of the song was released on iTunes on 4 December 2006. Composition and lyrics \\"Easy\\" is an uptempo electropop song that lasts three minutes and 36 seconds. A journalist from MTV UK described it as \\"a saucy slice of electro with a ravey chorus and naughty lyrics\\". It was composed in the key of F major using common time at 118 beats per minute. \\"Easy\\" features heavy use of synthesizers‚Äîmost notably a bass synthesizer, as well as a \\"grinding electro riff\\". According to Fraser McAlphine of BBC, the chorus is reminiscent of songs performed by British girl group, Girls Aloud. Ian Mathers from Stylus Magazine described the first half of the chorus as a \\"Hellogoodbye/Van She style 80s dancefloor euphoria\\". The song's lyrical content is metaphorical and features sexual euphemisms. Buchanan described the song during an interview that was published on the group's official website, saying: \\"Easy is a very naughty and cheeky song ‚Äì it‚Äôs the most sexy song we‚Äôve ever done. It came about when Orson had an idea for a song. They played it to us ‚Äì it was just a verse and a bridge and we completely changed the format of the song to make it our own and the result is this incredibly provocative sexy number that we love.\\" She elaborated in a separate interview: \\"When we started working with the guys from Orson the sound just blew us away ‚Äì it's completely fresh sounding but at the same time has the same qualities as the biggest songs of our career, so it's perfect for this album!\\" Critical reception \\"Easy\\" received mixed reviews from critics. Betty Clarke of The Guardian described the song as \\"synth-heavy sauciness\\". John Dingwall from Daily Record gave the song full-five star rating, describing it as a \\"funky pop grower which beats many of the American acts at their own game\\". Stuart McCaighy of This Is Fake DIY wrote it \\"thrills with its edge electro bass\\", and that the Sugababes \\"come over all seductive with the most transparently obvious lyrical euphemisms heard in a long time.\\" A journalist from Contactmusic.com regarded it as \\"smart, sexy and danceable, packed with hooks and undeniably fun.\\" They described the verses as \\"low-slung\\" and the chorus as an \\"un-second guessable blast of pure pop\\". However, Cameron Adamns of the Herald Sun criticized \\"Easy\\" as having \\"none of the charm or sass\\" of the other songs on Overloaded. Tim Finney of Pitchfork Media had a similar response to the song, writing that it attempts to \\"reverse engineer the brand of cool that is commonly given to them via a limpid and largely tuneless rock- pop hybrid\\". Adam Webb of Yahoo! Music regarded the song as \\"forgettable\\". Chart performance \\"Easy\\" entered the Irish Singles Chart on 2 November 2006 at number 34. The following week, it jumped to a peak position of number 18. The song debuted at number 30 the UK Singles Chart on 5 November 2006 and peaked at number eight the following week, becoming the Sugababes' twelfth top-ten hit in the country. \\"Easy\\" has since sold 60,000 copies in the UK. The song peaked in the top twenty on the Danish Singles Chart and Finnish Singles Chart, and the top thirty on the Austrian, German and Swiss singles charts. It reached number 18 on the Norwegian VG-lista chart for two weeks, and became the group's eleventh top-twenty hit in the country. The song peaked at number 45 on the Netherlands' Mega Single Top 100 chart, number 53 on the Czech Singles Chart, and number 56 on the Swedish Singles Chart. \\"Easy\\" performed most successfully on the Slovakian Singles Chart, where it peaked at number five for two non-consecutive weeks, and spent six weeks in the chart's top ten. Music video Amelle Berrabah, Keisha Buchanan and Heidi Range standing in separate public toilet cubicles in the music video of \\"Easy\\". The accompanying music video for \\"Easy\\" was directed by Tim Royes, who directed the video for the group's previous single \\"Red Dress\\". It was released on the iTunes Store on 9 October 2006, and was featured on the group's compilation DVD, Overloaded: The Videos Collection, which accompanied the audio versions of the greatest hits album. Berrabah, Buchanan and Range and wore black latex outfits for the video, while Range wore a red wig. The video for \\"Easy\\" was filmed in a public toilet at a club in Romford. The video begins with a scene of red nail polish dripping from a bottle. It then cuts to Buchanan, who is lying and tapping her foot against the floor in her black stiletto heels and latex stockings. She begins to start feeling her body. In the next scene, Range is seen standing in front of a mirror with a red lollipop, where she later begins to dance against the sink. Next, all the Sugababes are featured in separate toilet cubicles where they have their hands against the walls. The video cuts to Berrabah walking towards a hand dryer, which she rotates towards her face, causing her hair to be blown. After that, Range sits on a couch and uses the nail polish to colour her nails. The group is again seen in the cubicles, where they repeatedly open and close the doors. Shots underneath the doors show the girls moving their feet in their high-heel shoes. Later, Buchanan, Range and Berrabah are featured in front of red curtains with traditional silver, gold and black outfits, respectively. The final scene shows the group in front of the cubicles where they begin dancing robotically. Live performances The Sugababes performed \\"Easy\\" in October 2006 at the 100 Club on Oxford Street in London, where they were promoting the release of Overloaded: The Singles Collection. The following month, they performed \\"Easy\\" at G-A-Y in the London Astoria. The single was included in the set list for the group's 2007 Overloaded: The Singles Tour, in promotion of the greatest hits album.

In 2001 the Kisi population was estimated to number 18,000, of whom 10,200 spoke the Kisi language. They began using the Nyakyusa language as a second language only in 1900. Kisi women bartered homemade pots while Kisi fishermen exchanged these pots inland with their catch (which included hippopotamus) for cattle from the Sangu. They also transported people across Lake Nyassa by canoe. They are found alongside Lake Nyasa in Ludewa District in Iringa Region. Their main economic activity is fishing, however, other activities are like making pots and agriculture where they grow cassava. From Ludewa District to Lupingu (where most of the Kisi are located), it is not far, however there are several mountains and hills with a rough road which make transport difficult. Therefore in the past, most of the time the Kisi people were travelling on foot from Lupingu to Ludewa, carrying pots and fish, which they were selling them to Ludewa District. Examples of Kisi native names are like Ngalawa and Tondola. References *Bauer, Andreus. (The Emperial Rugaruga Raise the Flag of War) *Merensky, A.

It was invented by Mark Glickman as an improvement of the Elo rating system, and initially intended for the primary use as a chess rating system. Glickman's principal contribution to measurement is \\"ratings reliability\\", called RD, for ratings deviation. Both Glicko and Glicko-2 rating systems are under public domain and found implemented on game servers online (like Pok√©mon Showdown, Lichess, Free Internet Chess Server, Chess.com, Online Go Server (OGS), Counter Strike: Global Offensive, Team Fortress 2, Dota Underlords, Guild Wars 2, Splatoon 2, and Dominion Online), and competitive programming competitions. The formulas used for the systems can be found on the Glicko website. The RD measures the accuracy of a player's rating, with one RD being equal to one standard deviation. For example, a player with a rating of 1500 and an RD of 50 has a real strength between 1400 and 1600 (two standard deviations from 1500) with 95% confidence. Twice the RD is added and subtracted from their rating to calculate this range. After a game, the amount the rating changes depends on the RD: the change is smaller when the player's RD is low (since their rating is already considered accurate), and also when their opponent's RD is high (since the opponent's true rating is not well known, so little information is being gained). The RD itself decreases after playing a game, but it will increase slowly over time of inactivity. The Glicko-2 rating system improves upon the Glicko rating system and further introduces the rating volatility œÉ. A very slightly modified version of the Glicko-2 rating system is implemented by the Australian Chess Federation.  Step 1: Determine RD  The new Ratings Deviation (RD) is found using the old Ratings Deviation (RD_0): RD = \\\\min\\\\left(\\\\sqrt{{RD_0}^2 + c^2 t},350\\\\right) where t is the amount of time (rating periods) since the last competition and '350' is assumed to be the RD of an unrated player. If several games have occurred within one rating period, the method treats them as having happened simultaneously. The rating period may be as long as several months or as short as a few minutes, according to how frequently games are arranged. The constant c is based on the uncertainty of a player's skill over a certain amount of time. It can be derived from a thorough data analysis, or estimated by considering the length of time that would have to pass before a player's rating deviation would grow to that of an unrated player. If it is assumed that it would take 100 rating periods for a player's rating deviation to return to an initial uncertainty of 350, and a typical player has a rating deviation of 50 then the constant can be found by solving 350 = \\\\sqrt{50^2 +100c^2} for c.http://www.glicko.net/glicko.html Or c = \\\\sqrt{(350^2 - 50^2)/100} \\\\approx 34.6  Step 2: Determine New Rating  The new ratings, after a series of m games, are determined by the following equation: r = r_0 + \\\\frac{q}{\\\\frac{1}{RD^2} + \\\\frac{1}{d^2}}\\\\sum_{i=1}^{m}{g(RD_i)(s_i-E(sr_0,r_i,RD_i))} where: g(RD_i) = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{1 + \\\\frac{3 q^2 (RD_i^2)}{\\\\pi^2} }} E(sr_0,r_i,RD_i) = \\\\frac{1}{1+10^{\\\\left(\\\\frac{g(RD_i)(r_0-r_i)}{-400}\\\\right)}} q = \\\\frac{\\\\ln(10)}{400} = 0.00575646273 d^2 = \\\\frac{1}{q^2 \\\\sum_{i=1}^{m}{(g(RD_i))^2 E(sr_0,r_i,RD_i) (1-E(sr_0,r_i,RD_i))}} r_i represents the ratings of the individual opponents. s_i represents the outcome of the individual games. A win is 1, a draw is \\\\frac{1}{2}, and a loss is 0.  Step 3: Determine New Ratings Deviation  The function of the prior RD calculation was to increase the RD appropriately to account for the increasing uncertainty in a player's skill level during a period of non-observation by the model. Now, the RD is updated (decreased) after the series of games: RD'=\\\\sqrt{\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{RD^2}+\\\\frac{1}{d^2}\\\\right)^{-1}} See also * Chess rating system References  External links  * Professor Glickman's Glicko-Website * TrueSkill rating system by Microsoft borrows many ideas of Glicko. * forwardloop/glicko2s Glicko-2 implementation for the JVM * RobKohr/glicko JavaScript Glicko-2 implementation. * mmai/glicko2js Client side javascript and node.js Glicko-2 implementation * deepy/glicko2 Python Glicko-2 implementation. * sublee/glicko2 Python Glicko-2 implementation. * PlayerRatings R Glicko implementation by Alec Stephenson and Jeff Sonas. * scala-glicko2 Scala Glicko-2 implementation.

It is about an imaginary twelfth album recorded by the Beatles, called God. The album features songs that were written and recorded as solo projects by the group's members in reality, but in a parallel universe where the Beatles did not split up following the release of Let It Be, resulting in these songs being recorded by the group. In the universe where it was recorded, the Earth was apparently destroyed by a hail of comets, which shocks the two middle-aged men who find the album in their deceased workmate's room on board the docked Titanic Hotel in Liverpool.Interzone no. 130, April 1998 In reality, the Beatles did release twelve albums, thirteen if Magical Mystery Tour is included. The story ignores one of them, Yellow Submarine, because it is considered by the characters more a George Martin score than a Beatles album, and the other, Magical Mystery Tour was not an album in the United Kingdom until 1976. Track listing ;Side 1 # \\"Give Me Some Truth\\", actually released on John Lennon's Imagine album. # \\"It Don't Come Easy\\", from Ringo Starr's album Ringo's Best (Apple, 1971) # \\"Every Night\\", from Paul McCartney's album McCartney # \\"All Things Must Pass\\", from George Harrison's album All Things Must Pass. # \\"Child of Nature\\", a Lennon song auditioned for The White Album that later had its lyrics rewritten to become \\"Jealous Guy\\" from Imagine. # \\"The Back Seat of My Car\\", a McCartney duet with Linda McCartney from their album Ram. On the God album, the song is a traditional Beatles three part harmony. ;Side 2 # \\"Instant Karma!\\", the famous Lennon single. # \\"Isn't It a Pity\\", a Harrison song, auditioned during the Get Back/Let It Be sessions, later two versions were recorded and released on All Things Must Pass. # \\"Junk\\", a McCartney song auditioned during the Get Back/Let It Be sessions, later recorded for McCartney. # \\"Wah-Wah\\", a Harrison solo song released on All Things Must Pass. # \\"God\\", a Lennon song from Plastic Ono Band. # \\"Maybe I'm Amazed\\", a McCartney song from McCartney.

Harald built his lodge in 1914, just one year before the opening of the Ridge Route resulted in a parade of cars by his front door, seven days a week. \\"Sandberg's lodge at the top of the grade was a welcome sight to weary [Los Angeles] motorists still only halfway to Bakersfield,\\" the Los Angeles Times reported. A hotel, restaurant, and cabins were constructed on leased Forest Service land immediately to the south of the homesteaded property. When first opened in a one-story building, the business was named Sandberg's Summit Hotel. Some time after 1921 the owner turned it into a three-story log hostelry set amid a grove of California live oaks. A crank telephone provided access to the outside world via the long-distance phone circuits that connected Los Angeles with Bakersfield. Cabins also provided lodging behind the hotel. In 1918, Harald Sandberg was appointed postmaster of the settlement, which was thenceforth named Sandberg, with the post office inside the hotel itself. \\"It was a small tourist community,\\" Bakersfield resident Frank Kaufman told Interviewer Harrison Irving Scott (author of a history of the Ridge Route); it had a repair garage that advertised \\"Labor $2, after 6 p.m. $3; never closed.\\" Motor Stages would stop at Sandberg's for meals, and motorists would hunger for Mrs. (Marion) Sandberg's apple pie. In September 1929, attorney and real estate developer Ulysses S. Grant Jr., the son of the 18th American president, checked into Sandberg's with his wife and nephew for a visit. He died of a heart attack in his room.\\"Son of Soldier and Statesman Expires,\\" Los Angeles Times, September 27, page A-1. In spring 1934, the lodge was put up for sale.

Nevertheless, J.H. Cox purchased both the lodge and the ranch and, according to Walter W. (Lucky) Stevens, a later owner, Cox tainted the hotel's reputation by allegedly \\"bringing in booze, slot machines and 'ladies of the night.' \\" Cox sold the operation to Lillian Grojean, who turned the hotel garage into a ceramics factory;Lillian Grojean's pottery is still in demand by collectors. her lease from the Forest Service amounted to $90 a year. =Lucky Stevens= Lucky Stevens, a sometime film actor,His single film credit is listed here in the Internet Movie Data Base. was running a ceramics business in Burbank when he met Grojean. In 1950 or 1951 he paid her $15,000 for the dilapidated hotel, outbuildings, and lease. All that was left of the Sandberg Inn in 2006 At first he had plans to install a swimming pool and a fishing pond and to reopen the property as a guest ranch. By that time, the lodge was in disrepair, with pigeons roosting among the rafters.\\"Memories Haunt Old Ridge Route,\\" Los Angeles Times, September 8, 1952, page 2.. The Times story apparently referred erroneously to Harald Sandberg as Hiram Sandberg. Eight years later, he said he wanted to open the spread of as a children's ranch,Charles Hillinger, \\"Old Ridge Route Trip Turns Back Clock to 20s,\\" Los Angeles Times, March 14, 1960 and he did succeed in acquiring money, furniture, and used clothing. On April 29, 1961, fire destroyed the main lodge. Stevens was alone in the building. A district forest ranger said the blaze was apparently started by sparks from the chimney, and Stevens told an interviewer later that he had been burning trash when the flames began. The Forest Service canceled Stevens' lease in 1963, and nothing remains on the site today but a historic marker, some stone steps, a bit of foundation, trees, and shrubbery. Weather observation and fire station A four-man weather station was established in 1933 at the windy peak of nearby Bald Mountain, which straddles the boundary between the maritime climate to the south and a drier climate to the north. In 1953, the weather observers had to visually check the instruments and manually transmit the information via Teletype. In 1978, the Weather Service switched to an automated station, explaining, in the words of Los Angeles Times staff writer Marika Gerrard, that \\"It was just too hard to find someone to live up in that remote region with nothing to do but record weather statistics every hour on the hour.\\" Nevertheless, in May 1981 reporter Gerrard found two people living at the station ‚Äî a college student-caretaker and a man experimenting with the prototype of a modular wind turbine. The other two people living in Sandberg in that month were Willard Sparks, captain of the Quail Lake Fire Station, and his wife, Shirley. Sparks was responsible for covering of forested land that included Sandberg, Gorman, Pyramid Lake, part of the Angeles Forest, and a stretch of Interstate 5 known as \\"Blood Alley\\" because of the frequent accidents there.

History The first plant of this type, called Alpine Express I, was built in 1991 in Saas- Fee. In 1994, a further section, called Alpine Express II, became operational, although a continuous service of both sections is not possible. The cabins of these plants have space for 30 persons and travel with a speed of 6 m/s pulled by an endless hauling cable, and suspended from two carrying cables. A lane thus consists of three cables, from which the system takes its name. As with most rotating cabin cableways, gondolas are detachable from the cables in order to allow easy disembarkation without disrupting the transit of other cabins on the system. The system offers the following advantages over less sophisticated aerial cable-driven transportation systems: * lower energy consumption compared with reversible aerial ropeways and funitels of similar capacity * high passenger capacity and comfort compared with conventional reversible cable car systems * more frequent departures compared with conventional reversible cable car systems * increased wind stability compared with conventional (monocable) gondola lifts * larger ground distances and rope spans are possible compared with conventional gondola lifts * high driving speed compared with conventional gondola lifts, as speeds over 8 m/s are possible Development and building of the Alpine Express I cost 70 million SFr. Von Roll built no more 3S cable cars after the two systems in Saas Fee. When Von Roll was acquired by the Austrian company, Doppelmayr, in 1996, Doppelmayr attained the know-how for 3S gondola lift construction. Doppelmayr constructed their first system in 2002, in Val-d'Is√®re, France. Since then, the Italian company, Leitner, has also developed a 3S system, constructing their first system in 2009, in Ritten, Italy. The Austrian company, Doppelmayr, has developed a tricable gondola carriage which generates electricity. The wheels that roll along the two support cables are attached to electricity generators. The electricity is used to power seat heating, lighting, and other electrical features inside the cabins. Notable installations =Kitzb√ºhel= The 3S cable car in Kitzb√ºhel, Austria bridges the Saukasergraben and connects the skiing areas of Kirchberg and Resterh√∂he with one another. The lift opened in January 2005 and is 3,642 metres long. A journey takes approximately nine minutes from end to end. At its highest point, the cableway is 400 metres from the ground. The use of only one aerial lift pylon resulted in an unusual span width of 2,507 metres between the valley station and the 80-metre support pillar. Overall, the system cost 13.5 million euros with each cabin costing 100,000 euros. The cableway was manufactured by Doppelmayr. The cable has a diameter of 54 millimetres. The electrical power consumption is 400 kW. There are 19 cabins in total, though the system can be expanded to 24 cabins if the need arises in the future. Each cabin seats 24 people, allowing the system to transport a total of 3200 people in any given hour. One cabin has a glass floor, making it possible to view the 400 metre drop from a different angle. =Peak 2 Peak Gondola= In December 2008, Whistler-Blackcomb ski resort in British Columbia became the first North American resort to install a 3S lift when it opened the Peak 2 Peak Gondola, which connects Roundhouse Lodge on Whistler with Rendezvous Lodge on Blackcomb. The lift is similar to the Kitzb√ºhel lift, as it connects two ski areas (although in this case, more two parts of the same area together). The installation of the Peak 2 Peak Gondola eliminated the need to use the base area gondolas to get between Whistler and Blackcomb, connecting the areas together. =Sochi= The Olympic Village lift in Sochi, Russia, was built in 2012 by Doppelmayr. The lift has hangers designed to transport road vehicles, in addition to the regular passenger cabins. =H√≤n Th∆°m= In February 2018, the H√≤n Th∆°m lift, in Vietnam, became the longest passenger ropeway in the world, at 7.9 km long. The lift travels over several of the Ph√∫ Qu·ªëc islands, in the Gulf of Thailand. The system was manufactured by Doppelmayr. =Matterhorn Glacier Ride= In September 2018, the Matterhorn Glacier Ride opened in Zermatt, running parallel to the existing cable car up to the Klein Matterhorn. The top station is located at 3821 metres above mean sea level, making it the highest altitude tricable gondola lift in the world. A second tricable gondola lift up to the Klein Matterhorn is currently under construction. Both systems are manufactured by Leitner.

The school was established in 1865 by Confederate veteran Charles Summerville Rollerhttp://amaalumni.org/history/roller-biography/ as the Augusta Male Academy and formally became a military academy in 1880. It combined classical studies with a military curriculum and was officially named Augusta Military Academy in 1890. At the time, it was one of the first military preparatory schools in the Commonwealth of Virginia. It was one of the first such schools in the United States to adopt the Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corps program in 1919. Until its closure in 1984, the Academy had attracted over 7,000 students from the United States and abroad. Today it is owned and operated as a campground for the Virginia District of the United Pentecostal Church International. It is located on U.S. Route 11, also known as the Lee Highway. History =19th Century= Charles Summerville Roller was born in Mt. Sidney Virginia on May 8, 1839. He secured his early education at Parkins Classical School and Mossy Creek Academy before entering the University of Virginia in 1859. At the outbreak of the Civil War he left his undergraduate studies and joined the Confederate forces, serving for most of the duration of the war with Company E, 1st Virginia Regiment under the command of General J.E.B. Stuart's Cavalry. When the War was over, there was a need in the Fort Defiance community for the resumption of some form of schooling. Four years or more had passed since most of the area's youth had received any education. Mr. Roller, aware of the situation, promptly went to work teaching boys, many of them veterans of the war, in a simple, red brick structure (now demolished) which formerly stood on the property of Augusta Old Stone Church, just north of the current AMA campus. Roller's services to the community did not go unrewarded; he was elected to serve in the Virginia Legislature from 1871‚Äì1873. In his absence, education in the Fort Defiance area came to a standstill and he returned to Augusta County with renewed determination to establish a proper school for boys\\". In 1878 Roller chose a site three hundred yards above the west side of the Valley Pike toll road adjoining the Old Stone Church (now U. S. Route 11) as the place upon which to build his residence and Academy which was completed in 1879 as the Academy's first building. Over the next eighteen years Professor Roller constructed additional units for the Academy's programs and by 1897, a group of frame buildings stood in a line parallel to the Valley Pike occupying the same space now filled by the brick collegiate structures which replaced them in the early 20th century. The original frame buildings were specifically designed for Academy use, and for their time, were quite satisfactory. On the right side of the Roller home was constructed a large wooden tower which served as an armory. A two- story wing was added to the left of the Roller home; the first floor of which was designed to serve as the Academy dining room. Although it has been enlarged and completely remodeled numerous times, the Roller home with its original Academy dining room is still in use today. Because many of Professor Roller's first students were veterans of the Civil War, a military-type discipline for the classroom offered a means of control. The success enjoyed by this discipline early on, encouraged the founder to introduce a complete military system between 1880 and 1882. The only precedent for such a venture in Virginia was the operation of Virginia Military Institute at Lexington, which itself followed the system of the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York. In the Academy's early years all the instructors at Augusta were V.M.I. graduates, and for classes in military instruction the prescribed War Department manuals were used. By 1888 the name Augusta Classical and Military Academy was adopted and then again in 1890 the name was changed to the present Augusta Military Academy (AMA). =20th Century= At the start of the 20th Century, AMA continued to function as it had since its inception. However, upon the death of its founder, C.S. Roller on August 26, 1907, control and operation of the school transferred to his 2 youngest sons, Thomas Roller and Charles Roller Jr. The Roller brothers were themselves graduates of AMA and had gone on to further their educations at UVA and VMI respectively. (NOTE: Charles Roller Jr‚Äôs friend and roommate at VMI was the distinguished George C. Marshall) When the U.S.A. was drawn into the Great War, the Roller brothers debated over which of them should serve the country and which should stay to run the school. In the end, Charles Roller Jr, went off to war and spent 1917-1918 serving as a Captain with the 89th Division in France. It is believed that he conceived the ‚ÄúAd Astra per Aspera Society‚Äù on the long boat ride home and that it became a reality for the school in 1925. Under the combined leadership of the Roller brothers, AMA's enrollment and standing as a prestigious college preparatory school grew. In 1916 with the passage of the ‚ÄúNational Defense Act of 1916‚Äù the Junior Reserve Officer Training Program (JROTC) was established and AMA became the first secondary school in the state of Virginia to officially include this program into its curriculum in 1921. This opened the door to Federal logistical support for the military program but in reality, had little effect on the school's operating principles - military instilled discipline was still a pivotal principle of the school's academic and athletic programs. The early 20th century were years of expansion both in enrollment and physical presence and A.M.A. prospered becoming a school of international repute. When Thomas J. Roller died on March 10, 1946, his younger brother and co- principal Charles S. Roller, Jr., assumed all responsibilities for the school Buildings As enrollment in the early 1900s grew, the need for more and improved buildings grew. Old wooden structures were torn down, additional instructional facilities were built along with new dormitories during the early part of the 20th century. Most notable (and recognizable) for AMA is the \\"Main Barracks\\"; a three-story, rectangular structure constructed of rough stucco walls above a limestone-faced first story in the tower. It features an off-center, four-story entrance tower. Construction of the structure was completed in 1915. The Mess Hall/Library/Deanes Castle Dormitory (also known as The Roller House) was built in 1879 as the residence for founder Charles Summerville Roller. It is the two-story, double-pile, frame building sheathed in German siding and covered by a hipped, slate shingle roof. It is the only original structure remaining and was rebuilt/remodeled in 1999, today serving as the AMA Museum. The year 1946 saw the dedication of a new science hall as part of the Academic Hall. In 1959 a new Mess Hall kitchen was built. Expansions in 1961 resulted in the completion of new classrooms above' the swimming pool and in 1963 a new stairway was erected on the back of the Main Barracks. The neo-Gothic style Gymnasium/Academic Hall consists of three sections: the original gymnasium built in 1910 and the present Gymnasium built in 1929, connected by a swimming pool. The Augusta Military Academy's fieldhouse Each year, the Augusta Military Academy Museum hosts an alumni gathering. Among its notable alumni are William H. Armstrong, the author of Sounder, and the Louisiana educator C.E. Byrd. Trivia An episode of MTV's Fear was shot at the Augusta Military Academy. It was featured on Season 1, Episode 4 and was renamed \\"Hopkins Military Academy.\\" This was mainly to protect the academy from local teenagers, ghost hunters and urban explorers.

Based on the play by Jules Feiffer, it is the story of a girl, Patsy (Rodd), who brings home her boyfriend, Alfred (Gould), to meet her severely dysfunctional family amidst a series of random shootings, garbage strikes and electrical outages ravaging their New York City neighborhood. Plot Patsy Newquist is a 27-year-old interior designer who lives in a New York City rife with street crime, noise, obscene phone calls, power blackouts and unsolved homicides. When she sees a defenseless man being attacked by street thugs, she intervenes, but is surprised when the passive victim doesn't even bother to thank her. She ends up attracted to the man, Alfred Chamberlain, a photographer, but finds that he is emotionally vacant, barely able to feel pain or pleasure. He permits muggers to beat him up until they get tired and go away. Patsy is accustomed to molding men into doing her bidding. Alfred is different. When she brings him home to meet her parents and brother, he is almost non-verbal, except to tell her that he doesn't care for families. He learns that Patsy had another brother who was murdered for no known reason. Patsy's eccentric family is surprised when she announces their intention to wed, then amazed when their marriage ceremony conducted by the existential Rev. Dupas turns into a free-for-all. Determined to discover why her new husband is the way he is, Patsy coaxes Alfred into traveling to Chicago to visit his parents. He hasn't seen them since he was 17, but asks them to help with a questionnaire about his childhood at Patsy's request. Alfred ultimately agrees to try to become Patsy's kind of man, the kind willing to \\"fight back.\\" The instant that happens, a sniper's bullet kills Patsy, again for no apparent reason. A blood-splattered Alfred goes to her parents' apartment, New Yorkers barely noticing his state. He descends into a silent stupor, Patsy's father even having to feed him. A ranting, disturbed police detective, Lt. Miles Practice, drops by, almost unable to function due to the number of unsolved murders in the city. After he leaves, Alfred goes for a walk in the park. He returns with a rifle, which he doesn't know how to load. Patsy's father shows him how. Then the two of them, along with Patsy's brother, take turns shooting strangers down on the street. Their mood brightens and they happily eat dinner at the table together.

Kennedy. \\"Which was odd because I wasn't a big fan of his; he was the first actor in the White House,\\" he said. \\"And then when Oswald was shot, I thought there is a madness going on. And because of my politics, I saw that madness in Vietnam, too. So the motive of the play was the breakdown of all forms of authority‚Äîreligion, family, the police. Urban violence was always the metaphor in my mind for something more serious in the country.\\" Feiffer originally wrote it as a novel. \\"Having gone to theater a lot and read plays a lot since adolescence, I realized that if I ever wrote the sort of play I wanted to write, it would close in a week. I felt I'd already done my masochistic years at The Village Voice‚Äîeight years of cartoons without a penny. But I felt this grim sense of what was going on and I didn't feel the cartoons could express that fully.

The Hilbert scheme is a disjoint union of projective subschemes corresponding to Hilbert polynomials. The basic theory of Hilbert schemes was developed by . Hironaka's example shows that non-projective varieties need not have Hilbert schemes. Hilbert scheme of projective space The Hilbert scheme \\\\mathbf{Hilb}(n) of \\\\mathbb{P}^n classifies closed subschemes of projective space in the following sense: For any locally Noetherian scheme , the set of -valued points :\\\\operatorname{Hom}(S, \\\\mathbf{Hilb}(n)) of the Hilbert scheme is naturally isomorphic to the set of closed subschemes of \\\\mathbb{P}^n \\\\times S that are flat over . The closed subschemes of \\\\mathbb{P}^n \\\\times S that are flat over can informally be thought of as the families of subschemes of projective space parameterized by . The Hilbert scheme \\\\mathbf{Hilb}(n) breaks up as a disjoint union of pieces \\\\mathbf{Hilb}(n, P) corresponding to the Hilbert polynomial of the subschemes of projective space with Hilbert polynomial . Each of these pieces is projective over \\\\operatorname{Spec}(\\\\Z). =Construction= Grothendieck constructed the Hilbert scheme \\\\mathbf{Hilb}(n)_S of -dimensional projective space over a Noetherian scheme as a subscheme of a Grassmannian defined by the vanishing of various determinants. Its fundamental property is that for a scheme over , it represents the functor whose -valued points are the closed subschemes of \\\\mathbb{P}^n \\\\times_S T that are flat over . If is a subscheme of -dimensional projective space, then corresponds to a graded ideal I_X of the polynomial ring in n+1 variables, with graded pieces I_X(m). For sufficiently large , depending only on the Hilbert polynomial of , all higher cohomology groups of with coefficients in vanish, so in particular I_X(m) has dimension , where is the Hilbert polynomial of projective space. Pick a sufficiently large value of . The -dimensional space is a subspace of the -dimensional space , so represents a point of the Grassmannian . This will give an embedding of the piece of the Hilbert scheme corresponding to the Hilbert polynomial into this Grassmannian. It remains to describe the scheme structure on this image, in other words to describe enough elements for the ideal corresponding to it. Enough such elements are given by the conditions that the map has rank at most for all positive , which is equivalent to the vanishing of various determinants. (A more careful analysis shows that it is enough just to take .) =Properties=  Universality  Given a closed subscheme Y \\\\subset \\\\mathbb{P}^n_k=X over a field with Hilbert polynomial P, the Hilbert scheme has a universal subscheme W \\\\subset X \\\\times H flat over H such that * The fibers W_x over closed points x \\\\in H are closed subschemes of X. For Y \\\\subset X denote this point x as [Y] \\\\in H. * H is universal with respect to all flat families of subschemes of X having hilbert polynomial P. That is, given a scheme T and a flat family W' \\\\subset T\\\\times X, there is a unique morphism \\\\phi: T \\\\to X such that \\\\phi^*W \\\\cong W'.  Tangent space  The tangent space of the point [Y] \\\\in H is given by the global sections of the normal bundle N_{Y/X}; that is, :T_{[Y]}H = H^0(Y, N_{Y/X})  Unobstructedness of complete intersections  For local complete intersections Y such that H^1(Y,N_{X/Y}) = 0, the point [Y]\\\\in H is smooth. This implies every deformation of Y in X is unobstructed.  Dimension of tangent space  In the case H^1(Y,N_{X/Y}) eq 0, the dimension of H at [Y] is greater than or equal to h^0(Y,N_{X/Y}) - h^1(Y,N_{X/Y}). In addition to these properties, determined for which polynomials the Hilbert scheme \\\\mathbf{Hilb}(n, P) is non-empty, and showed that if \\\\mathbf{Hilb}(n, P) is non-empty then it is linearly connected. So two subschemes of projective space are in the same connected component of the Hilbert scheme if and only if they have the same Hilbert polynomial. Hilbert schemes can have bad singularities, such as irreducible components that are non-reduced at all points. They can also have irreducible components of unexpectedly high dimension. For example, one might expect the Hilbert scheme of points (more precisely dimension 0, length subschemes) of a scheme of dimension to have dimension , but if its irreducible components can have much larger dimension.  Functorial interpretation  There is an alternative interpretation of the Hilbert scheme which leads to a generalization of relative Hilbert schemes parameterizing subschemes of a relative scheme. For a fixed base scheme S, let X \\\\in (Sch/S) and let > \\\\underline{ \\\\text{Hilb} }_{X/S}:(Sch/S)^{op} \\\\to Sets be the functor sending a relative scheme T \\\\to S to the set of isomorphism classes of the set > \\\\underline{ \\\\text{Hilb} }_{X/S}(T) = \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\begin{matrix} Z & > \\\\hookrightarrow & X \\\\times_S T & \\\\to & T  \\\\downarrow & & \\\\downarrow & & > \\\\downarrow  T & = & T & \\\\to & S \\\\end{matrix} : Z \\\\to T \\\\text{ is flat} > \\\\right\\\\\\\\} / \\\\sim where the equivalence relation is given by the isomorphism classes of Z. This construction is functorial by taking pullbacks of families. Given f: T' \\\\to T, there is a family f^*Z = Z\\\\times_TT' over T'. = Representability for projective maps = If the structure map X \\\\to S is projective, then this functor is represented by the Hilbert scheme constructed above. Generalizing this to the case of maps of finite type requires the technology of algebraic spaces developed by Artin. = Relative Hilbert scheme for maps of algebraic spaces = In its greatest generality, the Hilbert functor is defined for a finite type map of algebraic spaces f:X \\\\to B defined over a scheme S. Then, the Hilbert functor is defined as > \\\\underline{\\\\text{Hilb}}_{X/B}:(Sch/B)^{op} \\\\to Sets sending > \\\\underline{\\\\text{Hilb}}_{X/B}(T) = \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ Z \\\\subset X\\\\times_BT : > \\\\begin{align} &Z; \\\\to T \\\\text{ is flat, proper,}  &\\\\text{and of finite > presentation} \\\\end{align} \\\\right\\\\\\\\} This functor is not representable by a scheme, but by an algebraic space. Also, if S = \\\\text{Spec}(\\\\mathbb{Z}), and X\\\\to B is a finite type map of schemes, their Hilbert functor is represented by an algebraic space.  Examples of Hilbert schemes  = Fano schemes of hypersurfaces = One of the motivating examples for the investigation of the Hilbert scheme in general was the Fano scheme of a projective scheme. Given a subscheme X \\\\subset \\\\mathbb{P}^n of degree d there is a scheme F_k(X) in \\\\mathbb{G}(k, n) parameterizing H \\\\subset X \\\\subset \\\\mathbb{P}^n where H is a k-plane in \\\\mathbb{P}^n, meaning it is a degree one embedding of \\\\mathbb{P}^k. For smooth surfaces in \\\\mathbb{P}^3 of degree d \\\\geq 3, the non-empty Fano schemes F_k(X) are smooth an zero dimensional. This is because lines on smooth surfaces have negative self-intersection. = Hilbert scheme of points = Another common set of examples are the Hilbert schemes of n-points of a scheme X, typically denoted X^{[n]}. For \\\\mathbb{P}^2 there is a nice geometric interpretation where the boundary loci B \\\\subset H describing the intersection of points can be thought of parametrizing points along with their tangent vectors. For example, (\\\\mathbb{P}^2)^{[2]} is the blowup Bl_{\\\\Delta}(\\\\mathbb{P}^2\\\\times\\\\mathbb{P}^2/S_2) of the diagonal modulo the symmetric action. = Degree d hypersurfaces = The Hilbert scheme of degree k hypersurfaces in \\\\mathbb{P}^n is given by the projectivization \\\\mathbb{P}(\\\\Gamma(\\\\mathcal{O}(k))). For example, the Hilbert scheme of degree 2 hypersurfaces in \\\\mathbb{P}^1 is \\\\mathbb{P}^2 with the universal hypersurface given by :\\\\text{Proj}(k[x_0,x_1][\\\\alpha,\\\\beta,\\\\gamma]/(\\\\alpha x_0^2 + \\\\beta x_0x_1 + \\\\gamma x_1^2)) \\\\subseteq \\\\mathbb{P}_{x_0,x_1}^1\\\\times\\\\mathbb{P}^2_{\\\\alpha,\\\\beta,\\\\gamma} where the underlying ring is bigraded.  Hilbert scheme of points on a manifold  \\"Hilbert scheme\\" sometimes refers to the punctual Hilbert scheme of 0-dimensional subschemes on a scheme. Informally this can be thought of as something like finite collections of points on a scheme, though this picture can be very misleading when several points coincide. There is a Hilbert‚ÄìChow morphism from the reduced Hilbert scheme of points to the Chow variety of cycles taking any 0-dimensional scheme to its associated 0-cycle. . The Hilbert scheme of points on is equipped with a natural morphism to an -th symmetric product of . This morphism is birational for of dimension at most 2. For of dimension at least 3 the morphism is not birational for large : the Hilbert scheme is in general reducible and has components of dimension much larger than that of the symmetric product. The Hilbert scheme of points on a curve (a dimension-1 complex manifold) is isomorphic to a symmetric power of . It is smooth. The Hilbert scheme of points on a surface is also smooth (Grothendieck). If , it is obtained from by blowing up the diagonal and then dividing by the action induced by . It was used by Mark Haiman in his proof of the positivity of the coefficients of some Macdonald polynomials. The Hilbert scheme of a smooth manifold of dimension 3 or more is usually not smooth.  Hilbert schemes and hyperk√§hler geometry  Let be a complex K√§hler surface with (K3 surface or a torus). The canonical bundle of is trivial, as follows from the Kodaira classification of surfaces. Hence admits a holomorphic symplectic form. It was observed by Akira Fujiki (for ) and Arnaud Beauville that is also holomorphically symplectic. This is not very difficult to see, e.g., for . Indeed, is a blow-up of a symmetric square of . Singularities of are locally isomorphic to The blow-up of is , and this space is symplectic. This is used to show that the symplectic form is naturally extended to the smooth part of the exceptional divisors of . It is extended to the rest of by Hartogs' principle. A holomorphically symplectic, K√§hler manifold is hyperk√§hler, as follows from the Calabi‚ÄìYau theorem. Hilbert schemes of points on the K3 surface and on a 4-dimensional torus give two series of examples of hyperk√§hler manifolds: a Hilbert scheme of points on K3 and a generalized Kummer surface.

These notions have been extended to filtered algebras, and graded or filtered modules over these algebras, as well as to coherent sheaves over projective schemes. The typical situations where these notions are used are the following: * The quotient by a homogeneous ideal of a multivariate polynomial ring, graded by the total degree. * The quotient by an ideal of a multivariate polynomial ring, filtered by the total degree. * The filtration of a local ring by the powers of its maximal ideal. In this case the Hilbert polynomial is called the Hilbert‚ÄìSamuel polynomial. The Hilbert series of an algebra or a module is a special case of the Hilbert‚ÄìPoincar√© series of a graded vector space. The Hilbert polynomial and Hilbert series are important in computational algebraic geometry, as they are the easiest known way for computing the dimension and the degree of an algebraic variety defined by explicit polynomial equations. In addition, they provide useful invariants for families of algebraic varieties because a flat family \\\\pi:X \\\\to S has the same Hilbert polynomial over any closed point s \\\\in S. This is used in the construction of the Hilbert scheme and Quot scheme.  Definitions and main properties Consider a finitely generated graded commutative algebra over a field , which is finitely generated by elements of positive degree. This means that :S = \\\\bigoplus_{i \\\\ge 0} S_i and that S_0=K. The Hilbert function :HF_S : n\\\\longmapsto \\\\dim_K S_n maps the integer onto the dimension of the -vector space . The Hilbert series, which is called Hilbert‚ÄìPoincar√© series in the more general setting of graded vector spaces, is the formal series :HS_S(t)=\\\\sum_{n=0}^{\\\\infty} HF_S(n)t^n. If is generated by homogeneous elements of positive degrees d_1, \\\\ldots, d_h, then the sum of the Hilbert series is a rational fraction :HS_S(t)=\\\\frac{Q(t)}{\\\\prod_{i=1}^h \\\\left (1-t^{d_i} \\\\right )}, where is a polynomial with integer coefficients. If is generated by elements of degree 1 then the sum of the Hilbert series may be rewritten as :HS_S(t)=\\\\frac{P(t)}{(1-t)^\\\\delta}, where is a polynomial with integer coefficients, and \\\\delta is the Krull dimension of . In this case the series expansion of this rational fraction is :HS_S(t)=P(t) \\\\left(1+\\\\delta t+\\\\cdots +\\\\binom{n+\\\\delta-1}{\\\\delta-1} t^n+\\\\cdots\\\\right) where :\\\\binom{n+\\\\delta-1}{\\\\delta-1} = \\\\frac{(n+\\\\delta-1)(n+\\\\delta-2)\\\\cdots (n+1)}{(\\\\delta-1)!} is the binomial coefficient for n>-\\\\delta, and is 0 otherwise. If :P(t)=\\\\sum_{i=0}^d a_it^i, the coefficient of t^n in HS_S(t) is thus :HF_S(n)= \\\\sum_{i=0}^d a_i \\\\binom{n -i+\\\\delta-1}{\\\\delta-1}. For n\\\\ge i-\\\\delta+1, the term of index in this sum is a polynomial in of degree \\\\delta-1 with leading coefficient a_i/(\\\\delta-1)!. This shows that there exists a unique polynomial HP_S(n) with rational coefficients which is equal to HF_S(n) for large enough. This polynomial is the Hilbert polynomial, and has the form :HP_S(n)= \\\\frac{P(1)}{(\\\\delta-1)!}n^{\\\\delta-1} + \\\\text{ terms of lower degree in } n. The least such that HP_S(n)=HF_S(n) for is called the Hilbert regularity. It may be lower than \\\\deg P-\\\\delta+1. The Hilbert polynomial is a numerical polynomial, since the dimensions are integers, but the polynomial almost never has integer coefficients . All these definitions may be extended to finitely generated graded modules over , with the only difference that a factor appears in the Hilbert series, where is the minimal degree of the generators of the module, which may be negative. The Hilbert function, the Hilbert series and the Hilbert polynomial of a filtered algebra are those of the associated graded algebra. The Hilbert polynomial of a projective variety in is defined as the Hilbert polynomial of the homogeneous coordinate ring of .  Graded algebra and polynomial rings  Polynomial rings and their quotients by homogeneous ideals are typical graded algebras. Conversely, if is a graded algebra generated over the field by homogeneous elements of degree 1, then the map which sends onto defines an homomorphism of graded rings from R_n=K[X_1,\\\\ldots, X_n] onto . Its kernel is a homogeneous ideal and this defines an isomorphism of graded algebra between R_n/I and . Thus, the graded algebras generated by elements of degree 1 are exactly, up to an isomorphism, the quotients of polynomial rings by homogeneous ideals. Therefore, the remainder of this article will be restricted to the quotients of polynomial rings by ideals.  Properties of Hilbert series  = Additivity = Hilbert series and Hilbert polynomial are additive relatively to exact sequences. More precisely, if :0 \\\\;\\\\rightarrow\\\\; A\\\\;\\\\rightarrow\\\\; B\\\\;\\\\rightarrow\\\\; C \\\\;\\\\rightarrow\\\\; 0 is an exact sequence of graded or filtered modules, then we have :HS_B=HS_A+HS_C and :HP_B=HP_A+HP_C. This follows immediately from the same property for the dimension of vector spaces. = Quotient by a non-zero divisor = Let be a graded algebra and a homogeneous element of degree in which is not a zero divisor. Then we have :HS_{A/(f)}(t)=(1-t^d)\\\\,HS_A(t)\\\\,. It follows from the additivity on the exact sequence :0 \\\\;\\\\rightarrow\\\\; A^{[d]}\\\\; \\\\xrightarrow{f}\\\\; A \\\\;\\\\rightarrow\\\\; A/f\\\\rightarrow\\\\; 0\\\\,, where the arrow labeled is the multiplication by , and A^{[d]} is the graded module which is obtained from by shifting the degrees by , in order that the multiplication by has degree 0. This implies that HS_{A^{[d]}}(t)=t^d\\\\,HS_A(t)\\\\,. = Hilbert series and Hilbert polynomial of a polynomial ring = The Hilbert series of the polynomial ring R_n=K[x_1, \\\\ldots, x_n] in n indeterminates is :HS_{R_n}(t) = \\\\frac{1}{(1-t)^{n}}\\\\,. It follows that the Hilbert polynomial is : HP_{R_n}(k) = {{k+n-1}\\\\choose{n-1}} = \\\\frac{(k+1)\\\\cdots(k+n-1)}{(n-1)!}\\\\,. The proof that the Hilbert series has this simple form is obtained by applying recursively the previous formula for the quotient by a non zero divisor (here x_n) and remarking that HS_K(t)=1\\\\,. = Shape of the Hilbert series and dimension = A graded algebra generated by homogeneous elements of degree 1 has Krull dimension zero if the maximal homogeneous ideal, that is the ideal generated by the homogeneous elements of degree 1, is nilpotent. This implies that the dimension of as a -vector space is finite and the Hilbert series of is a polynomial such that is equal to the dimension of as a -vector space. If the Krull dimension of is positive, there is a homogeneous element of degree one which is not a zero divisor (in fact almost all elements of degree one have this property). The Krull dimension of is the Krull dimension of minus one. The additivity of Hilbert series shows that HS_{A/(f)}(t)=(1-t)\\\\,HS_A(t). Iterating this a number of times equal to the Krull dimension of , we get eventually an algebra of dimension 0 whose Hilbert series is a polynomial . This show that the Hilbert series of is :HS_A(t)=\\\\frac{P(t)}{(1-t)^d} where the polynomial is such that and is the Krull dimension of . This formula for the Hilbert series implies that the degree of the Hilbert polynomial is , and that its leading coefficient is \\\\frac{P(1)}{d!}.  Degree of a projective variety and B√©zout's theorem  The Hilbert series allows us to compute the degree of an algebraic variety as the value at 1 of the numerator of the Hilbert series. This provides also a rather simple proof of B√©zout's theorem. For showing the relationship between the degree of a projective algebraic set and the Hilbert series, consider an projective algebraic set , defined as the set of the zeros of a homogeneous ideal I\\\\subset k[x_0, x_1, \\\\ldots, x_n], where is a field, and let R=k[x_0, \\\\ldots, x_n]/I be the ring of the regular functions on the algebraic set. In this section, one does not need irreducibility of algebraic sets nor primality of ideals. Also, as Hilbert series are not changed by extending the field of coefficients, the field is supposed, without loss of generality, to be algebraically closed. The dimension of is equal to the Krull dimension minus one of , and the degree of is the number of points of intersection, counted with multiplicities, of with the intersection of d hyperplanes in general position. This implies the existence, in , of a regular sequence h_0, \\\\ldots, h_{d} of homogeneous polynomials of degree one. The definition of a regular sequence implies the existence of exact sequences :0 \\\\longrightarrow \\\\left(R/\\\\langle h_0,\\\\ldots, h_{k-1}\\\\rangle \\\\right)^{[1]} \\\\stackrel{h_k}{\\\\longrightarrow} R/\\\\langle h_1,\\\\ldots, h_{k-1}\\\\rangle \\\\longrightarrow R/\\\\langle h_1,\\\\ldots, h_k \\\\rangle \\\\longrightarrow 0, for k=0, \\\\ldots, d. This implies that :HS_{R/\\\\langle h_0, \\\\ldots, h_{d-1}\\\\rangle}(t) = (1-t)^d\\\\,HS_R(t)=\\\\frac{P(t)}{1-t}, where P(t) is the numerator of the Hilbert series of . The ring R_1=R/\\\\langle h_0, \\\\ldots, h_{d-1}\\\\rangle has Krull dimension one, and is the ring of regular functions of a projective algebraic set V_0 of dimension 0 consisting of a finite number of points, which may be multiple points. As h_d belongs to a regular sequence, none of these points belong to the hyperplane of equation h_d=0. The complement of this hyperplane is an affine space that contains V_0. This makes V_0 an affine algebraic set, which has R_0 = R_1/\\\\langle h_d-1\\\\rangle as its ring of regular functions. The linear polynomial h_d-1 is not a zero divisor in R_1, and one has thus an exact sequence :0 \\\\longrightarrow R_1 \\\\stackrel{h_d-1}{\\\\longrightarrow} R_1 \\\\longrightarrow R_0 \\\\longrightarrow 0, which implies that :HS_{R_0}(t) = (1-t)HS_{R_1}(t) = P(t). Here we are using Hilbert series of filtered algebras, and the fact that the Hilbert series of a graded algebra is also its Hilbert series as filtered algebra. Thus R_0 is an Artinian ring, which is a -vector space of dimension , and Jordan‚ÄìH√∂lder theorem may be used for proving that is the degree of the algebraic set . In fact, the multiplicity of a point is the number of occurrences of the corresponding maximal ideal in a composition series. For proving B√©zout's theorem, one may proceed similarly. If f is a homogeneous polynomial of degree \\\\delta, which is not a zero divisor in , the exact sequence :0 \\\\longrightarrow R^{[\\\\delta]} \\\\stackrel{f}{\\\\longrightarrow} R \\\\longrightarrow R/\\\\langle f\\\\rangle \\\\longrightarrow 0, shows that :HS_{R/\\\\langle f \\\\rangle}(t)= \\\\left (1-t^\\\\delta \\\\right )HS_R(t). Looking on the numerators this proves the following generalization of B√©zout's theorem: :Theorem - If is a homogeneous polynomial of degree \\\\delta, which is not a zero divisor in , then the degree of the intersection of with the hypersurface defined by f is the product of the degree of by \\\\delta. In a more geometrical form, this may restated as: :Theorem - If a projective hypersurface of degree does not contain any irreducible component of an algebraic set of degree , then the degree of their intersection is . The usual B√©zout's theorem is easily deduced by starting from a hypersurface, and intersecting it with other hypersurfaces, one after the other. Complete intersection A projective algebraic set is a complete intersection if its defining ideal is generated by a regular sequence. In this case, there is a simple explicit formula for the Hilbert series. Let f_1, \\\\ldots, f_k be homogeneous polynomials in R=K[x_1, \\\\ldots, x_n], of respective degrees \\\\delta_1, \\\\ldots, \\\\delta_k. Setting R_i=R/\\\\langle f_1, \\\\ldots, f_i\\\\rangle, one has the following exact sequences :0 \\\\;\\\\rightarrow\\\\; R_{i-1}^{[\\\\delta_i]}\\\\; \\\\xrightarrow{f_i}\\\\; R_{i-1} \\\\;\\\\rightarrow\\\\; R_i\\\\; \\\\rightarrow\\\\; 0\\\\,. The additivity of Hilbert series implies thus :HS_{R_i}(t)=(1-t^{\\\\delta_i})HS_{R_{i-1}}(t)\\\\,. A simple recursion gives :HS_{R_k}(t)=\\\\frac{(1-t^{\\\\delta_1})\\\\cdots (1-t^{\\\\delta_k})}{(1-t)^n}= \\\\frac{(1+t+\\\\cdots+t^{\\\\delta_1})\\\\cdots (1+t+\\\\cdots+t^{\\\\delta_k})}{(1-t)^{n-k}}\\\\,. This shows that the complete intersection defined by a regular sequence of polynomials has a codimension of , and that its degree is the product of the degrees of the polynomials in the sequence.  Relation with free resolutions  Every graded module over a graded regular ring has a graded free resolution, meaning there exists an exact sequence : 0 \\\\to L_k \\\\to \\\\cdots \\\\to L_1 \\\\to M \\\\to 0, where the L_i are graded free modules, and the arrows are graded linear maps of degree zero. The additivity of Hilbert series implies that :HS_M(t) =\\\\sum_{i=1}^k (-1)^{i-1}HS_{L_i}(t). If R=k[x_1, \\\\ldots, x_n] is a polynomial ring, and if one knows the degrees of the basis elements of the L_i, then the formulas of the preceding sections allow deducing HS_M(t) from HS_R(t) = 1/(1-t)^n. In fact, these formulas imply that, if a graded free module has a basis of homogeneous elements of degrees \\\\delta_1, \\\\ldots, \\\\delta_h, then its Hilbert series is :HS_L(t) = \\\\frac{t^{\\\\delta_1}+\\\\cdots +t^{\\\\delta_h}}{(1-t)^n}. These formulas may be viewed as a way for computing Hilbert series. This is rarely the case, as, with the known algorithms, the computation of the Hilbert series and the computation of a free resolution start from the same Gr√∂bner basis, from which the Hilbert series may be directly computed with a computational complexity which is not higher than that the complexity of the computation of the free resolution.  Computation of Hilbert series and Hilbert polynomial  The Hilbert polynomial is easily deducible from the Hilbert series (see above). This section describes how the Hilbert series may be computed in the case of a quotient of a polynomial ring, filtered or graded by the total degree. Thus let K a field, R=K[x_1,\\\\ldots,x_n] be a polynomial ring and I be an ideal in R. Let H be the homogeneous ideal generated by the homogeneous parts of highest degree of the elements of I. If I is homogeneous, then H=I. Finally let B be a Gr√∂bner basis of I for a monomial ordering refining the total degree partial ordering and G the (homogeneous) ideal generated by the leading monomials of the elements of B. The computation of the Hilbert series is based on the fact that the filtered algebra R/I and the graded algebras R/H and R/G have the same Hilbert series. Thus the computation of the Hilbert series is reduced, through the computation of a Gr√∂bner basis, to the same problem for an ideal generated by monomials, which is usually much easier than the computation of the Gr√∂bner basis. The computational complexity of the whole computation depends mainly on the regularity, which is the degree of the numerator of the Hilbert series. In fact the Gr√∂bner basis may be computed by linear algebra over the polynomials of degree bounded by the regularity. The computation of Hilbert series and Hilbert polynomials are available in most computer algebra systems. For example in both Maple and Magma these functions are named HilbertSeries and HilbertPolynomial.  Generalization to coherent sheaves  In algebraic geometry, graded rings generated by elements of degree 1 produce projective schemes by Proj construction while finitely generated graded modules correspond to coherent sheaves. If \\\\mathcal{F} is a coherent sheaf over a projective scheme X, we define the Hilbert polynomial of \\\\mathcal{F} as a function p_{\\\\mathcal{F}}(m) = \\\\chi(X, \\\\mathcal{F}(m)), where œá is the Euler characteristic of coherent sheaf, and \\\\mathcal{F}(m) a Serre twist. The Euler characteristic in this case is a well-defined number by Grothendieck's finiteness theorem. This function is indeed a polynomial., Theorem 18.6.1 For large m it agrees with dim H^0(X, \\\\mathcal{F}(m)) by Serre's vanishing theorem. If M is a finitely generated graded module and \\\\tilde{M} the associated coherent sheaf the two definitions of Hilbert polynomial agree. = Graded free resolutions= Since the category of coherent sheaves on a projective variety X is equivalent to the category of graded-modules modulo a finite number of graded-pieces, we can use the results in the previous section to construct Hilbert polynomials of coherent sheaves. For example, a complete intersection X of multi-degree (d_1,d_2) has the resolution : 0 \\\\to \\\\mathcal{O}_{\\\\mathbb{P}^n}(-d_1-d_2) \\\\xrightarrow{\\\\begin{bmatrix} f_2  -f_1 \\\\end{bmatrix}} \\\\mathcal{O}_{\\\\mathbb{P}^n}(-d_1)\\\\oplus\\\\mathcal{O}_{\\\\mathbb{P}^n}(-d_2) \\\\xrightarrow{\\\\begin{bmatrix}f_1 & f_2 \\\\end{bmatrix}} \\\\mathcal{O}_{\\\\mathbb{P}^n} \\\\to \\\\mathcal{O}_X \\\\to 0  See also  * Castelnuovo‚ÄìMumford regularity * Hilbert scheme * Quot scheme  References  * . * * .

Built in the 18th century for the Blaydes family, it is now owned by the University of Hull's Maritime Historical Studies Centre. History Blaydes House was built in the late 1730s or early 1740s (the precise date is unknown) as the residence and business premises of the Blaydes family, one of the leading merchant families in the town and also owners of two shipyards, one on the River Hull, near the house, and another at Hessle Cliff, close to the northern end of the present-day Humber Bridge. The yards turned out vessels for the Royal Navy from the 1740s, but their main output was merchant ships, most famous among which was a collier named Bethia, which was purchased by the Navy in 1787, adapted and renamed HMS Bounty. The Blaydes family were also prominent in town politics, Benjamin Blaydes (whose initials can be seen in a carved monogram in the hallway ceiling) serving as Chamberlain in 1736. The family probably remained at the house until the early nineteenth century, by that time trading as part of the Blaydes Loft Gee & Company partnership. After this firm was wound up the family left Hull and sold the house. Subsequently, it was used as office space by a number of local businesses. In May 1941, during the Hull Blitz, a large office building immediately to the south was destroyed by a direct hit, but Blaydes House received only light damage.

People with this hereditary condition have a double row of eyelashes, which is called distichiasis, and a risk of swollen limbs due to problems in the lymphatic system.  Genetics  Lymphedema-distichiasis is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. It is estimated that only ¬º of diagnosed individuals did not inherit the condition but rather acquired the syndrome via a de novo mutation. Symptoms emerge between the life stages of puberty to early adulthood (around 30 years old). This is the result of a mutation in the FOXC2 gene. FOXC2 is a transcription factor associated with developmental processes. To date, at least 70 mutations of FOXC2 have been investigated in connection with lymphedema-distichiasis patients. These mutations are thought to be both loss of function and gain of function mutations. For some time, FOXC2 mutations were thought to be associated with lymphedema-distichiasis as a combined condition. However, there are now cases that indicate that FOXC2 mutations can cause distichiasis in humans without lymphedema.  Mutations  The A3G mutation is a pathogenic mutation (located in the AD-1 region of the FOXC2 protein) that lowers FOXC2‚Äôs ability to turn on target genes. p.Y41F, a missense mutation, is also located in FOXC2 AD-1. p.Y41F is one of eleven mutations found in the FOXC2 gene. It was determined that of these 11 mutations, one was nonsense, six were missense, and four were frameshift mutations. It is hypothesized that gain of function mutations lead to hypoplasia and loss of function mutations lead to hyperplasia specifically in individuals with lymphedema.  Symptoms  The main symptoms of lymphedema-distichiasis are limb swelling and a double row of eyelashes. Symptoms that have been noted in some but not all cases include cysts, light sensitivity, cardiac defects, cleft palate, and eye problems such as astigmatism and cornea scarring.  Syndrome diagnosis and management  Currently, the most accurate test to determine if an individual is affected by lymphedema-distichiasis syndrome is done via Sanger sequencing, which includes whole genome analysis and single gene and multigene testing. Sequenced DNA that exhibits mutations in the FOXC2 gene are considered confirmed clinical diagnoses. In addition to Sanger sequencing, Multiplex Ligation Probe Amplification (MLPA) can be used to determine if duplications and deletions in FOXC2 are present in an individual, making it a practical testing mechanism. Lastly, diagnosis is sometimes determined without genome testing. If an individual exhibits multiple symptoms of lymphedema-distichiasis and has a medical history consistent with known lymphedema-distichiasis symptoms, then their diagnosis is confirmed via clinical evaluation. Lymphedema-distichiasis is a rare genetic disease, it is unknown how many individuals are affected and what the frequency of the condition is. As a result, there are few syndrome management techniques: Symptoms of distichiasis can be minimized via eyelash plucking, electrolysis and other various treatments. Limb swelling can be reduced using compression clothing and bandages. Lastly, rapid treatment of broken skin and cellulitis lessens severity of symptoms.

FOXC2 is a member of the fork head box (FOX) family of transcription factors. Structure and function The protein is 501 amino acids in length. The gene has no introns; the single exon is approximately 1.5kb in size. FOX transcription factors are expressed during development and are associated with a number of cellular and developmental differentiation processes. FOXC2 is required during early development of the kidneys, including differentiation of podocytes and maturation of the glomerular basement membrane. It is also involved in the early development of the heart. An increased expression of FOXC2 in adipocytes can increase the amount of brown adipose tissue leading to lower weight and an increased sensitivity to insulin. Role in disease Absence of FOXC2 has been shown to lead to the failure of lymphatic valves to form and problems with lymphatic remodelling. A number of mutations in the FOXC2 gene have been associated with Lymphedema‚Äìdistichiasis syndrome, It has also been suggested that there may be a link between polymorphisms in FOXC2 and varicose veins. FOXC2 is also involved in cancer metastases. In particular, expression of FOXC2 is induced when epithelial cells undergo an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and become mesenchymal looking cells. EMT can be induced by a number of genes including Snail, Twist, Goosecoid, and TGF-beta 1. Overexpression of FOXC2 has been noted in subtypes of breast cancer which are highly metastatic. Suppression of FOXC2 expression using shRNA in a highly metastatic breast cancer model blocks their metastatic ability.

The entire mountain is a small north-south trending massif with four identifiable summits, North Truchas Peak, Middle Truchas Peak, \\"Medio Truchas Peak\\" (unofficial name), and South Truchas Peak, the highest. Of the three subsidiary summits, only North Truchas Peak () has enough topographic prominence (about ) to be considered an independent peak. The Truchas Peaks lie on the divide between the Rio Grande and the Pecos River. They are drained on the west by the Rio Medio, the Rio Quemado, and the Rio de las Trampas; on the northeast by the Rio Santa Barbara; and on the southeast by small creeks that quickly run into the upper reaches of the Pecos River. The massif also connects to numerous other high peaks in the region, many via the Santa Barbara Divide, a major east-west high ridge which separates the Pecos watershed on the south from the Santa Barbara watershed to the north. The Truchas group has a true wilderness character, as it is difficult to access the peaks within a single day. Many trails access the slopes of the peaks, most notably the Skyline Trail (Trail number 251), which traverses the eastern slopes at elevation around 12,000 feet (3,660 m) and accesses the Truchas Lakes, a set of small lakes in a cirque below the south side of North Truchas Peak.

On August 1, 1954, CKDA moved to 1280 AM and increased its power to 5000 watts; in 1955, CKDA-FM was signed on as a simulcast of CKDA-AM, and was the studio transmitter link to the off-shore transmitter site. On September 18, 1957, the AM station moved to 1220 kHz and doubled its power to 10,000 watts. In compliance with new broadcaster regulations regarding simulcasting, on March 21, 1965, CKDA-FM ended its simulcast of its AM sister and became CFMS-FM, airing an easy listening format from noon to midnight seven days a week. In 1971, CKDA increased its power to 50,000 watts, moved to 1200 AM on July 1, 1986, and dropped its oldies format for an all-'70s music format in 1994. CKDA and CFMS founder David Armstrong died on April 22, 1985, after which point his widow, Sheridan Armstrong, took over running the stations. In August 1995, the OK Radio Group Ltd. purchased CKDA from Capital Broadcasting and relaunched it as CKXM-AM in October 1995, broadcasting a country music format as 1200 CKXM Country.

History The Alberta School of Business, University of Alberta was founded in 1916, when a School of Accountancy was created at the University. The first Bachelor of Commerce degrees were granted in 1924 and in 1928, a School of Commerce was formally established. In 1960, after implementing significant revisions to its curriculum, the School became a full-fledged Faculty of the University of Alberta, and in 1968, the Faculty of Business Administration and Commerce became the first business school in Canada to be granted accreditation by the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business. In 1984, the Faculty was renamed as the Faculty of Business and moved into a new building on the University of Alberta campus. In 2010, following the completion of the ‚ÄúPreservation of the Name‚Äù campaign, the name of the School was formally changed to Alberta School of Business. The book A Chronicle of Commerce: A History of the School of Business was written by Dr. Bill Preshing and published in 2008. \\"Preserving 'Alberta' as the School's name might seem contrary to some in a world where business schools are aligning themselves with individuals' names for an established price. We have tremendous brand equity in our current moniker and, true to the spirit of this great province, the name Alberta is more substantial and more recognizable than any one person's name could represent alone.\\" ~ Stanley A.

As an apex predator, the salmon shark feeds on salmon, squid, sablefish, and herring. It is known for its ability to maintain stomach temperature (homeothermy), which is unusual among fish. This shark has not been demonstrated to maintain a constant body temperature. It is also known for an unexplained variability in the sex ratio between eastern and western populations in the northern Pacific.  Description  Jaws and some vertebrae of a salmon shark Adult salmon sharks are medium grey to black over most of the body, with a white underside with darker blotches. Juveniles are similar in appearance, but generally lack blotches. The snout is short and cone- shaped, and the overall appearance is similar to a small great white shark. The eyes are positioned well forward, enabling binocular vision to accurately locate prey. The salmon shark generally grows to between 200 and 260 cm (6.6‚Äì8.6 ft) in length and weighs up to 220 kg (485 lb). Males appear to reach a maximum size slightly smaller than females. Unconfirmed reports exist of salmon sharks reaching as much as 4.3 m (14.2 ft); however, the largest confirmed reports indicate a maximum total length of about 3.0 m (10 ft). The maximum reported weight of this heavily built shark is over 450 kg (992 lb).http://www.flmnh.ufl.edu/fish/Gallery/Descript/salmonshark/salmonshark.html  Biology  = Reproduction = The salmon shark is ovoviviparous, with a litter size of two to six pups. As with other Lamniformes shark species, the salmon shark is oophagous, with embryos feeding on the ova produced by the mother. Females reach sexual maturity at eight to ten years, while males generally mature by age five. Reproduction timing is not well understood, but is believed to be on a two-year cycle with mating occurring in the late summer or early fall. Gestation is around nine months. Some reports indicate the sex ratio at birth may be 2.2 males per female, but the prevalence of this is not known. = Homeothermy = As with only a few other species of fish, salmon sharks have the ability to regulate their body temperature. This is accomplished by vascular counter-current heat exchangers, known as retia mirabilia, Latin for \\"wonderful nets\\". Arteries and veins are in extremely close proximity to each other, resulting in heat exchange. Cold blood coming from the gills to the body is warmed by blood coming from the body. This results in blood coming from the body losing its heat so that by the time it interacts with cold water from the gills, it is about the same temperature, so no heat is lost from the body to the water. Blood coming towards the body regains its heat, allowing the shark to maintain its body temperature. This minimizes heat lost to the environment, allowing salmon sharks to thrive in cold waters. Their homeothermy may also rely on SERCA2 and ryanodine receptor 2 protein expression, which may have a cardioprotective effect. Range and distribution It is common in continental offshore waters, but ranges from inshore to just off beaches. It occurs singly, in feeding aggregations of several individuals, or in schools. Tagging has revealed a range which includes sub-Arctic to subtropical waters. The salmon shark occurs in the North Pacific Ocean, in both coastal waters and the open ocean. It is believed to range as far south as the Sea of Japan and as far north as 65¬∞N in Alaska and in particular in Prince William Sound during the annual salmon run. Individuals have been observed diving as deep as 668 m (2,192 ft), but they are believed to spend most of their time in epipelagic waters. =Regional differences= Age and sex composition differences have been observed between populations in the eastern and western North Pacific. Eastern populations are dominated by females, while the western populations are predominantly male. Whether these distinctions stem from genetically distinct stocks, or if the segregation occurs as part of their growth and development, is not known. The population differences may be a result of Japanese fishermen harvesting the male population. Japanese herbalists use the fins of males as ingredients in many traditional medicines said to treat various forms of cancer.http://edition.cnn.com/2009/HEALTH/06/24/traditional.treatment/index.html?iref=24hours Human interactions Currently, no commercial fishery for salmon shark exists, but they are occasionally caught as bycatch in commercial salmon gillnet fisheries, where they are usually discarded. Commercial fisheries regard salmon sharks as nuisances since they can damage fishing gear and consume portions of the commercial catch. Fishermen deliberately injuring salmon sharks have been reported. Sport fishermen fish for salmon sharks in Alaska. Alaskan fishing regulations limit the catch of salmon sharks to two per person per year. Sport fishermen are allowed one salmon shark per day from April 1 to March 31 in British Columbia.http://www.pac.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/fm- gp/rec/species-especes/fintable-tableaupoisson-eng.html The flesh of the fish is used for human consumption, and in the Japanese city of Kesennuma, Miyagi, the heart is considered a delicacy for use in sashimi. Although salmon sharks are thought to be capable of injuring humans, few, if any, attacks on humans have been reported, but reports of divers encountering salmon sharks and salmon sharks bumping fishing vessels have been given. These reports, however, may need positive identification of the shark species involved. Declines in the abundance of economically important king salmon in the 2000s may be attributed to increased predation by salmon sharks, based on remote temperature readings from tagged salmon that indicate they have been swallowed by sharks.

As one of the leading figures in the avant-garde film movement of the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, his films, known for their wit and graphic brilliance, received many international honors, including two Academy Award nominations,Remembering Carmen D'AvinoNCPR News and were regularly seen at Cinema 16, the most successful and influential membership film society in North American history. His works in oils and sculpture have achieved similar success, part of his always expanding experimentation into shape, color and form. Biography =Early years= As a teenager in Connecticut, D'Avino traded an old hunting rifle for a Kodak movie camera. The swap was life- altering and the beginning of D'Avino's adventurous, lifelong journey into the world of art. Beginning in the late 1930s with his studies at the Art Students League in New York City, and influenced by his teachers Robert Brackman and Andre l'Hote, D'Avino gravitated toward films and painting. His work with film led to his World War II assignment as a combat photographer with the Fourth Infantry Division of the US Army that climaxed with his filming the Normandy Invasion and the Liberation of Paris. D'Avino remained in Paris after the war and was the first American to use the GI Bill to study abroad. He enrolled at the √âcole nationale sup√©rieure des Beaux-Arts in Paris. While studying oil painting, D'Avino was stimulated by film shorts, especially Alain Resnais's 1948 film Van Gogh, which he saw in cine-clubs in Paris. He began to experiment with film, documenting the experiences of postwar France. D'Avino met his future wife, Helena Elfing of Finland in 1947, and in 1948, after an extended tour hitchhiking together across Italy, he followed her to India where she had accepted the position of tutor to the son of the newly posted French Ambassador to India. D'Avino had hoped to continue his art studies in India under the GI Bill, but was unable to find a suitable school. His time in India proved to be extremely educational, nonetheless. Henri Cartier-Bresson became one of his companions, and their conversations about photography were both enlivened and enlightening. D'Avino also had the opportunity to meet and discuss film with Jean Renoir who was in Delhi to film The River. Their conversations centered on the future possibilities of short films. He continued his painting and exhibited twice, once in Delhi and once in Bombay. The contrast of strong colors found in D'Avino's work comes out of his time spent in India. He was influenced by Indian miniature paintings, most of all from their ornamental elements and areas covered in pure colors. The same style is apparent in his film animations of the 1960s and 1970s. The contrast of colors remains always lively in his films, where red, orange and yellow details are presented together as a contrast with the cold colors, green and blue. After a stay in India of 18 months, D'Avino returned to Paris. In the spring of 1950, the sculptor Robert Rosenwald left his small studio at number 8, rue St. Julian le Pauvre, located directly across the street from one of the oldest churches in Paris, and diagonally across the Seine from the towers of Notre Dame, and turned it over to his friend Haywood \\"Bill\\" Rivers. Rivers in turn invited a number of his artist friends to join him in turning the studio into a gallery, the only gallery in Paris run by Americans essentially to show the work of U.S. painters, though some others were also shown. The opening of the gallery created considerable excitement and was reported both in the English language press as well as in a number of French papers. Even Pablo Picasso is said to have stopped by to see what was going on. In its slightly more than two years of existence more than 50 painters and sculptors exhibited at Galerie Huit, including Carmen D'Avino, Shinkichi Tajiri, Harold Tovish, Oscar Chelimsky, Sydney Geist, Al Held, Burt Hasan, George Earl Ortman, Raymond Hendler, Robert Rosenwald. D'Avino continued his art studies by enrolling at the Academie de la Grand Chaumiere, and in 1951 returned to North America, and eventually to New York City. He bought himself a 16 mm Pathe camera and made a short film called Sunday Afternoon, which won first prize in a competition sponsored by the Creative Film Foundation. The honor of receiving a Creative Film Award was significantly enhanced when Salvador Dal√≠ presented it to D'Avino, who was now embarking on a career in film that would last the rest of his life. =Mid-career= D'Avino's film making flourished during the personally, politically, and artistically liberating years of the 1960s. His films were shown and awarded honors at film festivals in New York, San Francisco, Montevideo, Uruguay; London, England; Oberhausen, Germany; Annecy,Annecy > About > Archives > 1965 > Official Selection > Film Index France; Mamaia, Rumania; Krak√≥w, Poland; Edinburgh, Scotland; and Melbourne, Australia. His film Pianissimo was selected to open the first night of performances at the first international film festival of New York's newly constructed Lincoln Center in 1963. Pianissimo was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Animated Short Subject, in 1964.Shirley MacLaine presents Short Film Oscars¬Æ in 19641964Oscars.org D'Avino received an Academy nomination for Best Documentary Short for his film Background in 1974.1974Oscars.orgDocumentary Winners: 1974 OscarsThe Films of Carmen D'AvinoCartoon Brew In 1983, when Lincoln Center's film festival celebrated its 20th anniversary, D'Avino was honored once more when the festival again began with his film, Pianissimo. D'Avino's body of work includes films for corporations including IBM, Time-Life, and the New York Stock Exchange. He completed a series of short, fully animated films for the Children's Television Workshop including Happy, Freak , Funny, Library, Flower, and Hydrant alongside the trailer for the 1974 French film Going Places.Carmen D'Avino Movie Trailer by nadderlago on YouTube =Later years= As he grew older, D'Avino challenged himself by working in new and, to him, yet untried materials. The sculptures in wood gave way to carvings of stone blocks weighing many tons. Marble led to limestone and then to granite. D'Avino standing next to his sculpture, \\"St. Francis\\", in Hammond, New York. When in his 80s he began to produce films on his newly acquired Apple computer and he marveled at the relative ease and affordability that today's film makers enjoyed: \\"When I think of all the images I didn't record because I couldn't afford the film, and see how cheaply it can be accomplished today, I am amazed and somewhat saddened that it came too late for me. I know, though, that some young person will use this new medium in a unique and exciting way.\\" No matter the medium, D'Avino transports viewers of his art to a whimsical, non- threatening, yet distracting place where eyes and minds are never at rest. What they see is pleasing, sometimes comical, but disturbing, with the ability to agitate. With the grain of wood or his palette of vivid colors, D'Avino can engulf people in a tapestry of intricate designs, rich with detail and texture, which grow with organic vitality. His success at invigorating those who view his work comes from the energy D'Avino transfers from himself to each piece. In order to sculpt, he first needs to get the wood ... chop the tree, cut the log, carve, file, sand ... and through the sweat of toil he converts his energy into the sculpture. It is the same way with his painting and his film and his life. D'Avino transfuses his art with his spirit and it is a symbiotic relationship. It is the doing that is the real art and when creativity is nourished, it can sustain as well. It is all part of the process he would say. D'Avino believed all you need is food, work and love. \\"To keep busy is a marvelous answer to some dull existence. Life is a great adventure no matter what you do. Life is a joy\\". Several of D'Avino's films have been preserved by the Academy Film Archive, including Pianissimo (1963), The Room (1959), and A Trip (1960), in 2007, and Background (1973), in 2012.

It is best known for the Boston Harbor Hotel's multi-story arch over the wide public plaza between Atlantic Avenue and the Boston Harbor waterfront. Along the waterfront can be found a marina, restaurants, a water transportation terminal, and a floating stage offering free concerts and movies during the summer. MBTA boat services link the wharf to Hingham, while water taxis operate to and from Logan International Airport. Cruise boats also operate from the wharf. History =18th century= In 1666 a protective battery called the \\"Sconce\\", or the \\"South Battery\\", was built at the foot of Fort Hill in the area now known as Rowes Wharf. In peacetime, the Battery had a company assigned to it in case of invasion, but had only one gunner. During the 1740s, the Battery was extended into the harbor and was defended by thirty-five guns. In 1764, John Rowe bought the land and built the first Rowes Wharf, which extended a short distance into Boston Harbor, and in 1765 Foster's Wharf was built on the site of the old Battery. Foster's Wharf was originally called \\"Apthorp's Wharf\\". Charles Ward Apthorp was a staunch Tory and backed the losing side in the American Revolution; it was his confiscated land and wharf that merchant William Foster bought for 6,266 pounds, 12 shillings in May 1782.http://www.worthpoint.com/worthopedia/1787-william- foster-boston- merchant-243129471https://archive.org/stream/confiscatedesta00hassgoog/confiscatedesta00hassgoog_djvu.txt Rowes Wharf, however, has carried its original builder's name since its inception.

With the construction of the Atlantic Avenue Elevated in 1901, a station at Rowes Wharf connected the wharf to Boston's elevated and subway rail system. However, by the middle of the 20th century, both the railroad - and by October 1938, the elevated railway - had closed, and the wharf had become dilapidated, the victim of changing patterns in shipping. This remained the case until the 1980s, when the current development was constructed.

White ( 1849 ‚Äì October 30, 1880) was an American lawman and the first town marshal (equivalent to chief of police) of the mining boomtown of Tombstone, Arizona Territory. White was elected to the position on January 6, 1880. At the time, Tombstone was still an emerging frontier town with fewer than 1,000 residents, and did not become an official city, with over 1,000 residents, until a year later. Before that time, White died in office following a notorious accidental shooting, and was succeeded by Virgil Earp. Tombstone Fred White was born in New York City, according to the 1880 Census. In the months before his killing, White formed an alliance and friendship with Wyatt Earp (then deputy undersheriff for the southern portion of Pima County, which included Tombstone). White had established himself as a likable and professional lawman, and contrary to later depictions in film, was well-respected by the area's less reputable elements, including the Cowboys. He often arrested individual Cowboys but rarely had any problems. On the rare occasion that one resisted arrest, he used force as needed, and seemingly had the support of other Cowboys in doing so. White got along particularly well with \\"Curly\\" Bill Brocius, and Brocius often joked with him. White was regarded as removed from the complex business, personal, and political rivalries that involved many of Tombstone's residents at the time. Unlike other city employees (including Earp and his siblings), who owned or partly owned many of the town's businesses and tried to steer its populace and visitors towards those under their ownership, White had no personal stake in any such enterprises, settling instead for his regular salary as town marshal. He was respected by the town in general and by all accounts treated everyone fairly. Death On the night of October 28, 1880, several Cowboys entered town and began drinking, with several of them firing their pistols in the air at different locations. Marshal White proceeded to confront each of them and disarm them. All of those confronted by him gave up their weapons voluntarily, without incident. Late that night, White encountered \\"Curly Bill\\" Brocius at the east end of town, on a dark street in a vacant lot where the Birdcage Theater now stands. Brocius was intoxicated and he (or his companions) were firing pistols into the air. White instructed Brocius to surrender his pistol. Brocius did this by pulling the weapon out of his pocket, handing it barrel- first to White. Wyatt Earp later claimed that he thought the pistol's hammer was \\"half-cocked\\" over a live round (it was later found to have contained six live rounds). When White grabbed the barrel and pulled, the weapon discharged, shooting White in the groin area. Wyatt Earp, who witnessed the shooting and flash but could not clearly see the action in the dark, pistol-whipped Brocius, knocking him unconscious, and arrested him. Wyatt told his biographer many years later that he thought Brocius was still armed at the time and did not notice that Brocius' pistol lay on the ground in the dark until Brocius was already down.John H. Flood Manuscript, 1926, p.85 Brocius was arrested by Wyatt Earp and his brother Morgan, both of whom were working as Pima County sheriff's deputies at the time.Wyatt vs. Curly Brocius was said to have terribly regretted the shooting of White, whom Brocius apparently liked, and maintained that it was an accident. The next day, Wyatt Earp and another deputy took Brocius to the county jail in the county seat of Tucson, possibly saving him from being lynched when White later died (at the time, Tombstone had a one-room wooden jail very near the scene of the shooting, which was famous for its flimsiness). White lingered for two days, dying on October 30, 1880. However, prior to his death, he gave testimony that ultimately led to Brocius being cleared of any wrongdoing. White stated that the pistol fired accidentally, and that Brocius, intoxicated, evidently did not realize the pistol was cocked. It was due to White's testimony, as well as a demonstration for the court that Brocius' pistol could be fired from the half-cock position, that Judge Neugass in Tucson dismissed the charge against Brocius. Despite his regret over the shooting death of White and his assistance from Earp in being taken out of town (Earp also ended up testifying on his behalf), Brocius resented having been pistol-whipped by Earp during his arrest. This was one factor that led to increasing tensions between the Earps and the Cowboys. After the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral a year later and the murder of Morgan Earp in March 1882, Wyatt Earp pursued and killed Brocius in a gunfight in the countryside outside Tombstone. White was buried in what is now known as Boot Hill cemetery (i.e., the old city cemetery), in Tombstone. Portrayals Although White is portrayed in the 1993 film Tombstone by Harry Carey, Jr., as an elderly or older man, he was actually only 31 or 32 years of age at the time of his death. He was also played by Boots Southerland in the 1994 film Wyatt Earp.

It consists of a massive wedge of sedimentary rock extending from the Rocky Mountains in the west to the Canadian Shield in the east. This wedge is about thick under the Rocky Mountains, but thins to zero at its eastern margins. The WCSB contains one of the world's largest reserves of petroleum and natural gas and supplies much of the North American market, producing more than per day of gas in 2000. It also has huge reserves of coal. Of the provinces and territories within the WCSB, Alberta has most of the oil and gas reserves and almost all of the oil sands. Conventional oil The Leduc No. 1 discovery sparked the oil boom in 1946 The WCSB is considered a mature area for exploration of petroleum and recent development has tended toward natural gas and oil sands rather than conventional oil. In the WCSB, conventional oil is of two different types: light crude oil and heavy crude oil, each with different costs, prices, and development strategies. Conventional light oil is a mature industry with most of the recoverable oil reserves already produced and production declining by three to four percent per year. Conventional heavy oil is also past its production peak with a future of long-term decline. Alberta, which contains most of the reserves, expects its light-medium crude oil production to decline by 42% from 2006 to 2016, while it expects heavy crude production to decrease by 35% over the same period. However, it also expects bitumen and synthetic crude oil from oil sands will considerably more than offset the decline in conventional crude oil and account for 87% of Alberta oil production by 2016. For light oil, the petroleum industry is searching for the remaining undiscovered pools, drilling infill oil wells, or redeveloping existing pools using enhanced oil recovery (EOR) techniques such as waterfloods, miscible floods, and carbon dioxide injection. Currently, only about 27 percent of light oil is recovered, leaving large opportunities for improvement. For conventional heavy oil, the industry is exploring new zones in undrilled portions of the basin to find remaining undiscovered pools, or to apply EOR schemes such as water floods, thermal projects, and miscible floods such as the Vapour Extraction Process (VAPEX) technology. Only 15 percent of heavy oil is currently being recovered, leaving a large volume for future recovery. Improved seismic and drilling technology, higher recoveries from existing pools through infill drilling, and efficient, cost-effective exploration and development of smaller pools are maintaining levels of conventional oil production in the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin. As the basin matures, the resource triangle with few large pools at the top, and many small pools at the base is being economically pursued deeper into the smaller pool segment as a result of these efficiencies. Oil sands Mine at the Athabasca Oil Sands According to the Alberta Energy and Utilities Board (EUB, now known as the Alberta Energy Regulator, the AER), Alberta's oil sands areas contain an ultimately recoverable crude bitumen resource of 50 billion cubic metres (315 billion barrels), with remaining established reserves of almost 28 billion cubic metres (174 billion barrels) at year-end 2004. The Athabasca Oil Sands, the Cold Lake Oil Sands and the Peace River Oil Sands, which contain initial oil-in-place reserves of 260 billion cubic metres (1.6 trillion barrels), an amount comparable to the total world reserves of conventional oil. The World Energy Council reported (2007) that the three Alberta oil sands areas contain at least two-thirds of the world's discovered bitumen in place. These three major oil sands areas, all in Alberta, have reserves that dwarf those of the conventional oil fields. By 2007 the Alberta natural bitumen deposits were the source of over one third of the crude oil produced in Canada. As a result of the oil price increases since 2003, the number of major mining, upgrading and thermal in-situ projects has grown to some 46 existing and proposed projects, encompassing 135 project expansion phases in various stages of execution. Estimates of capital expenditures to construct all announced projects over the period 2006 to 2015 total $125 billion. According to a Statistics Canada 2006 report, this extremely high level of activity has caused a severe labor shortage in Alberta and driven unemployment rates to their lowest level in history - the lowest of all 10 Canadian provinces and 50 U.S. states. This is the main factor limiting growth of oil sands production in the WCSB. Natural gas Greater Sierra field Canada is the third largest producer and second largest exporter of gas in the world, with the vast majority of it coming from the WCSB. The WCSB is estimated to have of marketable gas remaining (discovered and undiscovered), which represents about two thirds of Canadian gas reserves. Over half of the gas produced is exported to the United States. However, Canadian gas reserves represent less than one percent of world reserves and are rapidly becoming exhausted according to a 2010 paper. The majority of the large gas pools have been discovered and a significant portion of the discovered reserves has been produced. Production from the basin peaked in 2001 at around per day and was predicted in 2003, by the National Energy Board to be likely to decline from that level. The overall decline rate increased from 13 percent per year in 1992 to 23 percent in 2002, which means of production must be replaced each year just to keep production constant. With the basin being largely explored and operators finding less gas with each new well, this seems improbable. New gas reserves in the WCSB will likely come from unconventional sources such as coalbed methane (CBM). The number of coalbed methane wells in Alberta more than doubled in 2005, to 7764 by the end of that year, producing nearly of gas per day. More than 95 percent of the CBM wells were completed in the Upper Cretaceous Horseshoe Canyon and Belly River formations, at typical depths of to . About 4 percent of the CBM wells are completed in the Lower Cretaceous Mannville formation, at depths of to .Susan R. Eaton, \\"Coalbed gas frontier being tapped,\\" AAPG Explorer, Nov. 2006, p.20-24. Author David J. Hughes in his 2004 book entitled North America's Natural Gas Crisis, predicted that the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin would likely continue to be the main gas supply area in Canada for many years, however, declining production and the likelihood that much of the gas will be diverted to fuel new oil sands plants mean that the probability of there being sufficient surplus gas to meet projected U.S. demand is low, and the US will have to look elsewhere for future gas supplies. Coal The WCSB contains about 90 percent of Canada's usable coal resources. Their rank ranges from lignite to semianthracite. About 36 percent of the total estimated 71,000 megatonnes of usable coal is bituminous, including a high proportion of medium to low volatile coals. The low sulfur content and acceptable ash levels of these bituminous coals make them attractive as coking feedstocks, and large quantities are mined for that purpose. However, the lack of heavy industry in Western Canada means that only a limited amount of this coal is consumed in Canada, and most is exported to Japan, Korea and other countries. The lower rank coals are used mainly for electricity generation, where the existence of shallow coal seams with little overburden make strip-mining and reclamation easy, and low sulfur levels reduce the environmental impact of their use.

Goff and George Buck Flower.  Plot  A couple go to a drive-in theater in a rural California town, and are butchered by an unseen assailant, who uses a sword to decapitate the man, and skewer the woman through the neck. Investigating this dual homicide are police detectives Mike Leary and John Koch, who interview the drive-in's boorish manager, Austin Johnson, and the odd custodian, Germy. Germy mentions that a peeping tom likes to cruise the area to watch couples and lone girls, and he is told to try and write down the voyeur's license plate number the next time he sees him. That night, the killer strikes again, impaling two lovers while they are making out in their vehicle, and leaving a sword behind. To see if the sword belongs to the missing drive-in owner, Germy is brought in to the police station identify it. Germy states that the sword is not a part of the owner's private collection, and tells the detectives that the voyeur was at the drive-in around the time of the latest double murder, and that he managed to write down the man's license plate number. The plate number is connected to Orville Ingleson, whose home the detectives visit. Orville denies any connection to the deaths, but when a bloody cloth is found in his car, he panics, and tries to make a run for it. Orville is caught, and claims the blood was just from a dog he accidentally ran over, which is confirmed by further analysis, forcing the police to let him go. That evening, the detectives (one of them disguised as a woman) go to a screening at the drive- in, and spot Orville there, even though he had promised to stay away from it. After a customer who had stormed off when his girlfriend refused his advances returns to his car, he discovers that his girlfriend has been beheaded. Leary and Koch rush to Orville's car, and find him dead from a slit throat. Austin and Germy are brought in the station for questioning, and Austin antagonizes the detectives, refusing to close the drive-in without a court order, and firing Germy. The following evening, Leary and Koch get a call about a machete-wielding man who has just murdered two people being cornered in a warehouse, with a little girl he has taken hostage. The detectives go to the warehouse, and after a chase and stand off, shoot the man dead, learning afterward that he was a mental patient who had escaped only a few hours ago, and thus he cannot be the serial killer. At the drive-in, Germy collects his things, and goes to the projection booth to confront Austin about which one of them gets to keep the owner's sword collection, and about money he is owed. As soon as Germy enters the booth, the silhouette of Austin being killed with a sword is projected onto the drive-in's screen while a Wild West movie is being featured. Leary and Koch (who want to talk to Austin) arrive just in time to see this, and break into the booth, where they find both Austin and Germy hacked to pieces and the killer gone with no trace. The film suddenly comes to an abrupt end where an on-screen text states that other drive-ins throughout the country are now being plagued by similar bloodbaths, and that the killer's identity is still unknown. A fake public address then announces that a psychopath is loose in the viewer's own drive-in theater, and urges the audience not to panic, as the police are on their way.  Cast  * John F.

The rate at which a woman's breasts drop and the degree of ptosis depends on many factors. The key factors influencing breast ptosis over a woman's lifetime are cigarette smoking, her number of pregnancies, gravity, higher body mass index, larger bra cup size, and significant weight change. Post-menopausal women or people with collagen deficiencies (such as Ehlers-Danlos) may experience increased ptosis due to a loss of skin elasticity. Many women and medical professionals mistakenly believe that breastfeeding increases sagging. It is also commonly believed that the breast itself offers insufficient support and that wearing a bra prevents sagging, which has not been found to be true. Plastic surgeons categorize the degree of ptosis by evaluating the position of the nipple relative to the infra-mammary fold, the point at which the underside of the breasts attach to the chest wall. In the most advanced stage, the nipples are below the fold and point toward the ground.  Signs and symptoms  A woman's breasts change in size, volume, and position on her chest throughout her life. In young women with large breasts, sagging may occur early in life due to the effects of gravity. It may be primarily caused by the volume and weight of the breasts which are disproportionate to her body size. = Impact of pregnancy = During pregnancy, the ovaries and the placenta produce estrogen and progesterone. These hormones stimulate the 15 to 20 lobes of the milk-secreting glands in the breasts to develop. Women who experience multiple pregnancies repeatedly stretch the skin envelope during engorgement while lactating. As a woman's breasts change in size during repeated pregnancies, the size of her breasts change as her mammary glands are engorged with milk and as she gains and loses weight with each pregnancy. In addition, when milk production stops (usually as a child is weaned), the voluminous mammary glands diminish in volume, but they still add bulk and firmness to the breast. A 2010 review found that weight gain during pregnancy and breastfeeding were not significant risk factors for ptosis. = Middle- aged women = Severe ptosis In middle-aged women, breast ptosis is caused by a combination of factors. If a woman has been pregnant, postpartum hormonal changes will cause her depleted milk glands to atrophy. Breast tissue and suspensory ligaments may also be stretched if the woman is overweight or loses and gains weight. When these factors are at play, the breast prolapses, or falls forward. When a woman with sagging breasts stands, the underside or inferior skin of the breast folds over the infra-mammary fold and lies against the chest wall. The nipple-areola complex tends to move lower on the breast relative to the inframammary crease. The nipple of the breast may also tend to point downward. = Post-menopausal women = In post-menopausal women, breast atrophy is aggravated by the inelasticity of over-stretched, aged skin. This is due in part to the reduction in estrogen, which affects all body tissues, including breast tissue. The loss of estrogen reduces breast size and fullness. Estrogen is also essential to maintaining a fibrous protein called collagen, which makes up much of the breast's connective tissue. = Ptosis scale = Stages of ptosis Plastic surgeons describe the degree of breast sagging using a ptosis scale like the modified Regnault ptosis scale below: * Grade I: Mild ptosis‚ÄîThe nipple is at the level of the infra-mammary fold and above most of the lower breast tissue. * Grade II: Moderate ptosis‚ÄîThe nipple is located below the infra-mammary fold but higher than most of the breast tissue hangs. * Grade III: Advanced ptosis‚ÄîThe nipple is below the inframammary fold and at the level of maximum breast projection. * Pseudoptosis‚ÄîThe nipple is located either at or above the infra-mammary fold, while the lower half of the breast sags below the fold. This is most often seen when a woman stops nursing, as her milk glands atrophy, causing her breast tissue to sag. * Parenchymal Maldistribution‚ÄîThe lower breast tissue is lacking fullness, the inframammary fold is very high, and the nipple and areola are relatively close to the fold. This is usually a developmental deformity.  Causes  University of Kentucky plastic surgeon Brian Rinker encountered many women in his practice who attributed their sagging breasts to breastfeeding, which was also the usual belief among medical practitioners. He decided to find out if this was true, and between 1998 and 2006 he and other researchers interviewed 132 women who were seeking breast augmentation or breast lifts. They studied the women's medical history, body mass index (BMI), their number of pregnancies, their breast cup size before pregnancy, and smoking status. The study results were presented at a conference of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons. According to Rinker's research, there are several key factors. A history of cigarette smoking \\"breaks down a protein in the skin called elastin, which gives youthful skin its elastic appearance and supports the breast.\\" The number of pregnancies was strongly correlated with ptosis, with the effects increasing with each pregnancy. As most women age, breasts naturally yield to gravity and tend to sag and fold over the inframammary crease, the lower attachment point to the chest wall. This is more true for larger-breasted women. The fourth reason was significant weight gain or loss (greater than ). Other significant factors were higher body mass index and larger bra cup size. In Rinker's study, 55% of respondents reported an adverse change in breast shape after pregnancy. Many women mistakenly attribute the changes and their sagging breasts to breastfeeding, and as a result some are reluctant to nurse their infants. Research shows that breastfeeding is not the factor that many thought it was. Rinker concluded that \\"Expectant mothers should be reassured that breastfeeding does not appear to have an adverse effect upon breast appearance.\\" Also discounted as causes affecting ptosis are weight gain during pregnancy and lack of participation in regular upper body exercise. = Effect of vigorous exercise = When running, breasts may move three-dimensionally: vertically, horizontally and laterally, in an overall figure-8 motion. Unrestrained movement of large breasts may contribute to sagging over time. Motion studies have revealed that when a woman runs, more than 50% of the breast's total movement is vertical, 22% is side-to-side, and 27% is in-and-out. A 2007 study found that encapsulation- type sports bras, in which each cup is separately molded, are more effective than compression-type bras, which press the breasts close to the body, at reducing total breast motion during exercise. Encapsulation bras reduce motion in two of the three planes, while compression bras reduce motion in only one plane. Previously, it was commonly believed that a woman with small to medium- size breasts benefited most from a compression-type sports bra, and women with larger breasts need an encapsulation-type sports bra.  Mechanism  Anatomically, a female's breasts do not contain any muscle but are composed of soft, glandular tissue. Breasts are composed of mammary glands, milk ducts, adipose tissue (fat tissue) and Cooper's ligaments. Mammary glands remain relatively constant throughout life. Fat tissue surrounds the mammary glands, and its volume will normally vary throughout life. Although the exact mechanisms that determine breast shape and size are largely unknown, the amount and distribution of fat tissue and, to a lesser extent, mammary tissue, cause variations in breast size, shape and volume. Some experts believe Cooper's ligaments, which are connective tissue with the breast, provide some support within breasts, but there's no agreement on whether they provide support or simply divide breast tissue into compartments. Treatment =Bras= Since breasts are an external organ and do not contain muscle, exercise cannot improve their shape. They are not protected from external forces and are subject to gravity. Many women mistakenly believe that breasts cannot anatomically support themselves and that wearing a brassiere will prevent their breasts from sagging later in life. Researchers, bra manufacturers, and health professionals cannot find any evidence to support the idea that wearing a bra for any amount of time slows breast ptosis. Bra manufacturers are careful to claim that bras only affect the shape of breasts while they are being worn. =Surgery = Some women with ptosis choose to undergo plastic surgery to make their breasts less ptotic. Plastic surgeons offer several procedures for lifting sagging breasts. Surgery to correct the size, contour, and elevation of sagging breasts is called mastopexy. Women can also choose breast implants, or may undergo both procedures. The breast-lift procedure surgically elevates the parenchymal tissue (breast mass), cuts and re-sizes the skin envelope, and transposes the nipple-areola complex higher upon the breast hemisphere. If sagging is present and the woman opts not to undergo mastopexy, implants are typically placed above the muscle, to fill out the breast skin and tissue. Submuscular placement can result in deformity. In these cases, the implant appears to be high on the chest, while the natural breast tissue hangs down over the implant.

It has several common names, including kosso, barwood, African kino tree, muninga, and v√®ne; mukwa is used for this species as well as other Pterocarpus. Groves of the tree can be found on the savannahs of West Africa, but it is becoming increasingly rare and is sometimes cultivated. The tree also grows in forests of Como√© National Park in C√¥te d'Ivoire, a region geographically close to the Sahel but with a higher moisture regime due to its location between two large rivers. Also, the tree grows in abundance in Kurmi Local Govt. of Taraba State in Nigeria. The tree grows to about 11 meters in height on average, and bears dark, scaly bark and yellow flowers. The fruits are winged pods. P. erinaceus grows well on sunny, hot African plains with long dry seasons and frequent fires. The wood, which varies from yellowish to rosy reds and rich browns, is valued for woodworking, and makes good charcoal and fuel wood. The tree exudes a red sap called kino, which is used as a dye in tanning and cloth-making. As a legume, the tree harbors rhizobia that return nitrogen to the soil, making it more fertile. Such plants are desirable on farmland. In addition, the foliage is a nutritious fodder for farm animals. Mali has an active market for P. erinaceus foliage, which is in high demand by sheep farmers for fodder. The tree has several medicinal uses, including reduction of fever and cough suppression.Pterocarpus erinaceus: An important legume tree in African savannas Pterocarpus erinaceus is one of the traditional djembe woods. It is also the only wood used to make the keys and part of the frame of the balafon and is the most common wood used to make the neck of the kora. Pterocarpus erinaceus was brought to Europe in the 19th century by the Scottish explorer Mungo Park. Currently, it is a threatened due to overexploitation, environmental degradation, and climatic changes.

According to Spiekermann, FF Meta was intended to be a \\"complete antithesis of Helvetica\\", which he found \\"boring and bland\\". It originated from an unused commission for the Deutsche Bundespost (German Federal Post Office). Throughout the 1990s, FF Meta was embraced by the international design community with Spiekermann and E. M. Ginger writing that it had been dubiously praised as the Helvetica of the 1990s. FF Meta has been adopted by numerous corporations and other organizations as a corporate typeface, for signage or in their logo. These include Imperial College London, The Weather Channel, Free Tibet, the television stations WSYR-TV, WIVT and WUTR in upstate New York, Herman Miller, Zimmer Holdings, Mozilla Corporation, Mozilla Foundation, Schaeffler Group and Fort Wayne International Airport. The University of Hull uses FF Meta Serif alongside FF Meta. The Government of Greece has used FF Meta Greek as the official government typeface since 2010. Visually distinctive characteristics Characteristics of this typeface are: ;Lower case *Round dot over the letter i and j. Samples of FF Meta *Ends of the letter s are nearly horizontal *Curved bottom of l, making it clearly different to a 1 or upper- case i. *Double-storey a with a very open aperture at the top. *Not fully closed bottom loop in binocular g. *Bend to the left at the top of the letters b, h, k, l. *Bend to the right at the top of the letter d. *A very distinctive y where the two strokes do not join smoothly. ;Upper case *Angled letter M, more resembling Futura or an upturned W than Helvetica or Gill Sans *Slanted upper terminal on the top right of E, T and F. E and T are not symmetrical. A general feature of FF Meta is relatively open apertures, in contrast to the more folded-up appearance of Helvetica. This is believed to promote legibility and make the letterforms more clearly different from one another. Development Development began in February 1985 when Deutsche Bundespost approached Sedley Place Design, where Spiekermann was working at the time, and commissioned a comprehensive corporate design program. As the typeface would be used repeatedly in small sizes, for identification (rather than copy), require two different weights, and printed quickly on potentially poor paper stock, the brief called for a very legible, neutral, space-saving, and distinguishable (in regards to weight) typeface with special attention to producing unmistakable characters. Whereas traditionally, typefaces are designed to be viewed beautifully large, the goal with this particular typeface was to produce a typeface which worked well for its primary application. Taking into account research done on six font families and the constraints of the brief, the characteristics of what would become FF Meta began to take shape. The typeface would have to be a sans-serif to match the client, narrow (but not condensed) to save space, feature strokes thick enough to withstand uneven printing but also light so that individual characters do not run together, contain clearly distinguishable glyphs for similarly shaped characters, versatile capitals and figures that are clear but not obtrusive, and curves, indentations, flares, and open joins to combat poor definition, optical illusions, and over-inking. In addition to these demands, to meet Bundespost's needs, the family would also contain three fonts: regular, regular italic, and bold. The typeface is particularly similar to Syntax, one of Spiekermann's candidate typefaces. After completing and digitizing the typesetting font, mockups were generated for Bundespost's new forms and publication. However, despite positive interest from the German Minister of Telecommunications among others, Bundespost decided not to implement the new exclusive typeface for fear it would \\"cause unrest\\". Bundespost, despite funding the project, continued instead to use a variety of different versions of Helvetica (before changing them to Frutiger). Spiekermann wrote an article on the abandoned design for Baseline magazine in 1986. At this time Meta was called PT55 (for the regular weight) and PT75 (bold).  Releases  The Weather Channel logo, using FF Meta Years later, realizing that Bundespost and Sedley Place Design would never utilize the typeface, Spiekermann with his company MetaDesign decided to continue work on the typeface and eventually published it‚Äîalong with other orphaned typefaces‚Äîunder his newly formed publishing label FontFont resulting in the release of FF Meta in 1991. This version of FF Meta was created by re-digitizing the original outlines and digitizing them in Fontographer on a Macintosh, work which was done by Spiekermann‚Äôs interns Just van Rossum and Erik van Blokland between 1988-1989. * 1991 FF Meta family released containing normal, normal small caps, and bold. * 1992 FF Meta 2 released as an expansion adding an italics weight, and small caps for bold. * 1993 FF MetaPlus released featuring some fine tuning of characters, spacing, and kerning along with the introducing three new weights: book, medium, and black in roman, italics, roman small caps, and roman small caps italics except for black which lacked small caps. * 1998 FF Meta reorganized and released with the following families: FF Meta Normal, FF Meta Book, FF Meta Medium, FF Meta Bold and FF Meta Black, all in roman, italic, small caps and italic small caps, which came with their respective expert and lining figures. * Sometime before 2005 foreign language versions by Tagir Safayev and Olga Chayeva., a condensed family, and additional light weights were added as: FF Meta Light, FF Meta Thin, and FF Meta Hairline. * 2005 FF Meta Headline * 2007 A serif companion, entitled FF Meta Serif, was completed and released. * 2011 A Hebrew version was released. * 2013 Fira Sans, a free derivative for Mozilla's Firefox OS  Personnel  Writing in 1987, Spiekermann gave these credits for Meta as originally designed for the Bundespost. * Original sketches, concept, and research for FF Meta by Erik Spiekermann and Michael Bitter at Sedley Place Design, Berlin. * Design of the completed alphabets by Gerry Barney and Mike Pratley at Sedley Place Design, London.

A specialized inhabitant of the mesopelagic zone, the crocodile shark can be found worldwide in tropical waters from the surface to a depth of . It performs a diel vertical migration, staying below a depth of during the day and ascending into shallower water at night to feed. Typically measuring only in length, the crocodile shark is the smallest living mackerel shark. It can be distinguished by its elongated cigar-shaped body, extremely large eyes, and relatively small fins. An active-swimming predator of pelagic bony fishes, squid and shrimp, the crocodile shark has a sizable oily liver that allows it to maintain its position in the water column with minimal effort. The size and structure of its eyes suggests that it is adapted for hunting at night. The crocodile shark is aplacental viviparous, with females typically giving birth to litters of four. The fetuses are oophagous, meaning that they feed on undeveloped eggs ovulated for this purpose by their mother. Due to its small size, the crocodile shark poses little danger to humans and is of little commercial importance. However, substantial numbers are caught as bycatch, leading it to be assessed as Near Threatened by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). This species was responsible for damaging deep sea fiberoptic cables when the technology was first deployed in 1985. Taxonomy and phylogeny The English common name \\"crocodile shark\\" is derived from its Japanese name mizuwani (Ê∞¥È∞ê, literally \\"water crocodile\\"), which refers to its sharp teeth and habit of snapping vigorously when taken out of the water. Other common names for this species include Japanese ragged- tooth shark, Kamohara's sand-shark, and water crocodile. The crocodile shark was first described as Carcharias kamoharai in a 1936 issue of Zoological Magazine (Tokyo) by ichthyologist Kiyomatsu Matsubara, based on a long specimen found at the Koti Fish Market in Japan. The type specimen is a long adult male found at a fish market in Su-ao, Taiwan. After being shuffled between the genera Carcharias and Odontaspis in the family Odontaspididae by various authors, in 1973 Leonard Compagno resurrected Jean Cadenat's 1963 subgenus Pseudocarcharias from synonymy for this species and placed it within its own family.Martin, R.A. Pseudocarchariidae. ReefQuest Centre for Shark Research. Retrieved on December 24, 2008. The morphology of the crocodile shark suggests affinity with the megamouth shark (Megachasmidae), basking shark (Cetorhinidae), thresher sharks (Alopiidae), and mackerel sharks (Lamnidae). More recent phylogenetic analyses, based on mitochondrial DNA, have suggested that the crocodile shark is closely related to either the megamouth shark or the sand sharks (Odontaspididae). Alternately, analysis based on dentition suggests that the closest relatives of the crocodile shark are the thresher sharks, followed by the mackerel sharks. Fossil Pseudocarcharias teeth dating to the Serravallian age (13.6-11.6 Ma) of the Miocene epoch have been found in Italy, and are identical to those of the modern-day crocodile shark. Description The crocodile shark has a spindle- shaped body with a short head and a bulbous, pointed snout. The eyes are very large and lack nictating membranes (protective third eyelids). The five pairs of gill slits are long, extending onto the dorsal surface. The sizable, arched jaws can be protruded almost to the tip of the snout and contain large teeth, shaped like spikes in the front and knives on the sides. There are fewer than 30 tooth rows in either jaw; in the upper jaw, the first two large teeth are separated from the lateral teeth by a row of small intermediate teeth. The pectoral fins are small, broad, and rounded. The pelvic fins are nearly as large as the pectorals. The first dorsal fin is small, low and angular; the second dorsal fin is smaller than the first but larger than the anal fin. The caudal fin is asymmetrical with a moderately long upper lobe. The caudal peduncle is slightly compressed with weak lateral keels. The dermal denticles are small, with a flattened crown bearing small ridges and backward-pointing cusps It is dark brown above and paler below, sometimes with a few dark blotches on the sides and belly and/or a white blotch between the corner of the mouth and the first gill slit. The fins have thin translucent to white margins.Martin, R.A. Biology of the Crocodile Shark (Pseudocarcharias kamoharai). ReefQuest Centre for Shark Research. Retrieved on December 24, 2008.

In the Atlantic Ocean, it is known from off Brazil, Cape Verde, Guinea-Bissau, Guinea, Angola, South Africa, and Saint Helena Island, though it has not yet been reported from the northwestern Atlantic. In the Indian Ocean, it occurs in the Mozambique Channel and possibly the Agulhas Current and the Bay of Bengal. In the Pacific, it occurs from Japan, Taiwan, and the Korean Peninsula in the northwest, southward to Indonesia, Australia, and New Zealand, and eastward to the western coast of the Americas from Baja California to Chile, including the Marshall, Phoenix, Palmyra, Johnston, Marquesas, Line, and Hawaiian Islands in between. In New Zealand this species has been recorded at the Three Kings Ridge, off the coast of Northland and on the northern Kermadec Ridge. From distribution records, the crocodile shark's range seems to be bound by the latitudes 37¬∞N and 44¬∞S, where the average sea surface temperature is 20 ¬∞C (68 ¬∞F). This species is not evenly distributed but is rather locally abundant in certain areas, suggesting that it is not strongly migratory. The crocodile shark is usually found in the pelagic zone from the surface to a depth of 590 m (1,940 ft). It is occasionally encountered inshore near the bottom and has been known to strand on the beaches of South Africa, possibly after being stunned by upwellings of cold water. In March 2017, one crocodile shark washed ashore dead off the coast of Devon, England in Hope Cove, the first ever seen off the coasts of the United Kingdom. Thus far, it remains unknown as to why this particular shark was present so far north of its normal range.https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/crocodile-shark-discovered-uk- first-time-tropical-hope-cove-plymouth-a7607586.html Biology and ecology Deepwater fishes such as bristlemouths are preyed upon by the crocodile shark. With a long body, small fins, and large liver rich in squalene and other low- density lipids, the crocodile shark is convergently similar to mesopelagic dogfish sharks such as the cookiecutter shark (Isistius brasiliensis). The liver may comprise a fifth of the shark's weight, and acts as an incompressible float that allows it to maintain neutral buoyancy in the water column with little effort. Like many other inhabitants of the mesopelagic zone, the crocodile shark apparently migrates closer to the surface at night to feed and descends into deeper water during the day, being rarely found above a depth of 200 m (660 ft) during daytime. The large eyes of the crocodile shark, equipped with a reflective green or yellow retina and lacking an expanded iris, suggest that it is a nocturnal hunter that relies on sight to pick out the silhouettes or bioluminescence of its prey. Little is known of the crocodile shark's feeding habits; it is thought to be an active, fast- swimming predator based on its strong musculature, large tail, and behavior when captured. On one occasion, a crocodile shark off Cape Point, South Africa, jumped out of the water in pursuit of bait. Its diet consists of small to medium-sized bony fishes (including bristlemouths and lanternfishes), squid (including onychoteuthids, mastigoteuthids, pholidoteuthids, and cranchiids) and shrimp. Crocodile sharks are not known to be preyed upon by any other species. The crocodile shark is aplacental viviparous and typically gives birth to litters of four, two pups to each uterus. The gestation period is unknown but believed to be long. The embryos have yolk sacs at 3-4 cm (1.2-1.6 in) long; once the yolk sac is fully absorbed they become oophagous: the mother produces large numbers of thin-walled egg capsules that contain 2-9 eggs each, which are then consumed by the unborn embryos. The abdomens of the embryos become characteristically distended with ingested yolk material, which can make up a quarter of the embryo's total weight. It is unclear how two crocodile shark fetuses manage to share a single uterus, when in some other oophagous mackerel sharks such as the sand tiger shark (Carcharias taurus), only one fetus survives in each uterus. The pups are born at approximately 40 cm (16 in) long; males attain maturity at 74-110 cm (29-43 in) and females at 89-102 cm (35-40 in). There is no defined reproductive season. Human interactions Significant numbers of crocodile sharks are caught accidentally by fisheries. With its small size, non-cutting teeth, and oceanic habitat, the crocodile shark is not considered dangerous to humans. However, it has a powerful bite that invites caution. This species is a common bycatch of various pelagic longline fisheries meant for tuna and swordfish. The largest numbers are caught by the Japanese yellowfin tuna fishery and the Australian swordfish fishery, both operating in the Indian Ocean.Romanov, E.V., Ward, P., Levesque, J.C. and Lawrence, E. (2008). \\"Preliminary analysis of crocodile shark (Pseudocarcharias kamoharai) distribution and abundance trends in pelagic longline fisheries\\". IOTC Working Party on Environment and Bycatch (WPEB) Bangkok, Thailand. This species is also sometimes caught on squid jigs and in tuna gillnets. It is usually discarded due to its small size and low- quality meat. However, its oily liver is potentially valuable. No data is available on the population status of the crocodile shark, though it is probably declining from bycatch mortality. Coupled with its low reproductive rate, this has led the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) to assessed it as Near Threatened. In June 2018 the New Zealand Department of Conservation classified the crocodile shark as \\"Data Deficient\\" with the qualifier \\"Secure Overseas\\" under the New Zealand Threat Classification System. After AT&T; installed the first deep sea fiberoptic cable between Gran Canaria and Tenerife in the Canary Islands in September 1985, the system suffered a series of shorts that necessitated costly repairs. It was discovered that attacks from the crocodile shark were responsible for most of the failures, possibly because they were attracted to the electric field around the cables. Since crocodile sharks are not benthic in nature, they were presumably biting the cables as they were being deployed. The problem was solved by protecting the cables with a layer of steel tape beneath a dense polyethylene coating.

The drooping may be worse after being awake longer when the individual's muscles are tired. This condition is sometimes called \\"lazy eye\\", but that term normally refers to the condition amblyopia. If severe enough and left untreated, the drooping eyelid can cause other conditions, such as amblyopia or astigmatism. This is why it is especially important for this disorder to be treated in children at a young age, before it can interfere with vision development. The term is from Greek ‚Äì \\"a fall, falling\\". Signs and symptoms Signs and symptoms typically seen in this condition include: * The eyelid(s) may appear to droop. * Droopy eyelids can give the appearance of fatigue. * The eyelid may not protect the eye as effectively, allowing it to dry out. * Sagging upper eyelids can partially block the person's field of view. * Obstructed vision may cause a person to tilt their head back to speak. * The areas around the eyes may become tired and achy. * Eyebrows may be constantly lifted to see properly. Some of the risk factors for ptosis include: * Eye tumor. * Diabetes. * History of stroke. * Cancer. * Neurological disorder. * Age. Eye muscles weaken as they age, increasing the chance of the eyelids drooping. Causes Neurotoxic ptosis caused by botulinum toxin: a 14-year-old botulism patient with bilateral total ophthalmoplegia with ptosis (left image) and dilated, fixed pupils (right image). The teenager was fully conscious Phineas Gage displayed ptosis after a large iron rod entered his left cheek, passed behind his left eye, and exited at the top of his head Ptosis occurs due to dysfunction of the muscles that raise the eyelid or their nerve supply (oculomotor nerve for levator palpebrae superioris and sympathetic nerves for superior tarsal muscle). It can affect one eye or both eyes and is more common in the elderly, as muscles in the eyelids may begin to deteriorate. One can, however, be born with ptosis. This is due to improper development of the infant's levator muscle while still in the mother's womb. Congenital ptosis is hereditary in three main forms. Causes of congenital ptosis remain unknown. Ptosis may be caused by damage to the muscle which raises the eyelid, damage to the superior cervical sympathetic ganglion or damage to the nerve (3rd cranial nerve (oculomotor nerve)) which controls this muscle. Such damage could be a sign or symptom of an underlying disease such as diabetes mellitus, a brain tumor, a pancoast tumor (apex of lung) and diseases which may cause weakness in muscles or nerve damage, such as myasthenia gravis or oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy. Exposure to the toxins in some snake venoms, such as that of the black mamba, may also cause this effect. Ptosis can be caused by the aponeurosis of the levator muscle, nerve abnormalities, trauma, inflammation or lesions of the lid or orbit. Dysfunctions of the levators may occur as a result of autoimmune antibodies attacking and eliminating the neurotransmitter. Ptosis may be due to a myogenic, neurogenic, aponeurotic, mechanical or traumatic cause, and it usually occurs isolated, but may be associated with various other conditions, like immunological, degenerative, or hereditary disorders, tumors or infections. Acquired ptosis is most commonly caused by aponeurotic ptosis. This can occur as a result of senescence, dehiscence or disinsertion of the levator aponeurosis. Moreover, chronic inflammation or intraocular surgery can lead to the same effect. Also, wearing contact lenses for long periods of time is thought to have a certain impact on the development of this condition. Congenital neurogenic ptosis is believed to be caused by Horner's syndrome. In this case, a mild ptosis may be associated with ipsilateral ptosis, iris and areola hypopigmentation and anhidrosis due to paresis of the superior tarsal muscle. Acquired Horner syndrome may result after trauma, neoplastic insult, or even vascular disease. Ptosis due to trauma can ensue after an eyelid laceration with transection of the upper eyelid elevators or disruption of the neural input. Other causes of ptosis include eyelid neoplasms, neurofibromas or the cicatrization after inflammation or surgery. Mild ptosis may occur with aging. A drooping eyelid can be one of the first signals of a third nerve palsy due to a cerebral aneurysm, that otherwise is asymptomatic and referred to as an oculomotor nerve palsy. =Drugs= Use of high doses of opioid drugs such as morphine, oxycodone, heroin, or hydrocodone can cause ptosis. Pregabalin, an anticonvulsant drug, has also been known to cause mild ptosis.  Mechanism and Pathophysiology  Different trauma can cause and induce many different mechanisms. For example, myogenic ptosis results from a direct injury to the levator muscle and/or M√ºller's muscle. On the other hand, neurogenic ptosis is caused by closed head injuries, or traumatically- introduced neurotoxin (wasp/bee/snake venom) or botulinum toxin, due to the effect of those factors on the CNNIII or the sympathetic pathway. Mechanical ptosis can also occur due to scarring tissue restricting the patient's eyelid excursion or weighing down the patient's lid. Another mechanism is the disturbance of the oculomotor nerve causing the levator palpebrae to weaken, resulting in the eyelid drooping. Ptosis can also occur in a patient with brain tumors due to pressure on the third nerve, also known as the sympathetic nerve, on the brainstem. Pathology Myasthenia gravis is a common neurogenic ptosis which could be also classified as neuromuscular ptosis because the site of pathology is at the neuromuscular junction. Studies have shown that up to 70% of myasthenia gravis patients present with ptosis, and 90% of these patients will eventually develop ptosis. In this case, ptosis can be unilateral or bilateral and its severity tends to be oscillating during the day, because of factors such as fatigue or drug effect. This particular type of ptosis is distinguished from the others with the help of a Tensilon test and blood tests. Also, specific to myasthenia gravis is the fact that coldness inhibits the activity of cholinesterase, which makes possible differentiating this type of ptosis by applying ice onto the eyelids. Patients with myasthenic ptosis are very likely to still experience a variation of the drooping of the eyelid at different hours of the day. Ptosis caused by oculomotor palsy can be unilateral or bilateral, as the subnucleus to the levator muscle is a shared, midline structure in the brainstem. In cases in which the palsy is caused by the compression of the nerve by a tumor or aneurysm, it is highly likely to result in an abnormal ipsilateral papillary response and a larger pupil. Surgical third nerve palsy is characterized by a sudden onset of unilateral ptosis and an enlarged or sluggish pupil to the light. In this case, imaging tests such as CTs or MRIs should be considered. Medical third nerve palsy, contrary to surgical third nerve palsy, usually does not affect the pupil and it tends to slowly improve in several weeks. Surgery to correct ptosis due to medical third nerve palsy is normally considered only if the improvement of ptosis and ocular motility are unsatisfactory after half a year. Patients with third nerve palsy tend to have diminished or absent function of the levator. When caused by Horner's syndrome, ptosis is usually accompanied by miosis and anhidrosis. In this case, the ptosis is due to the result of interruption innervations to the sympathetic, autonomic Muller's muscle rather than the somatic levator palpebrae superioris muscle. The lid position and pupil size are typically affected by this condition and the ptosis is generally mild, no more than 2 mm. The pupil might be smaller on the affected side. While 4% cocaine instilled to the eyes can confirm the diagnosis of Horner's syndrome, Hydroxyamphetamine eye drops can differentiate the location of the lesion. Chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia is a systemic condition which usually affects only the lid position and the external eye movement, without involving the movement of the pupil. This condition accounts for nearly 45% of myogenic ptosis cases. Most patients develop ptosis due to this disease in their adulthood. Characteristic to ptosis caused by this condition is the fact that the protective up rolling of the eyeball when the eyelids are closed is very poor. Diagnosis The doctor will first perform a physical exam with questions about your medical history. This is to distinguish if the condition is hereditary or not. The doctor will then start with a slit lamp exam after you've explained how often your eyelids droop and how long each episode occurs. The slit lamp exam is done with a high-intensity light allowing a closer look at the patient's eyes. The doctor can also perform a Tensilon test. This test involves injecting the drug Tensilon (edrophonium) into a vein. The doctor then monitors the eyelids for signs of improvements from the drug. Another comprehensive eye exam for proper diagnosis is a visual field test. A visual field test assesses how much the ptosis affects the superior vision. Since nerve damage is one of the causes for ptosis the ophthalmologist will check the patient's pupil for abnormalities. Along with checking the patient's pupil, the doctor will also check the patient's muscle function by having the patient look around. The ophthalmologist may also measure the degree of the eyelid droop by measuring the marginal reflex distance. The marginal reflex distance is the distance between the center of the pupil and the edge of the upper lid. Along with the marginal reflex distance, the ophthalmologist may examine the strength/ function of the patient's levator muscle. The ophthalmologist will do this test by holding the frontalis muscle (located in the forehead). While holding the forehead, the ophthalmologist will measure how far the eyelid travels when the patient is gazing down. Through these tests, the ophthalmologist will diagnose if the patient has ptosis and what type of ptosis. After diagnosing the types of ptosis the ophthalmologist will then decide if the patient is a good candidate for surgery. =Classification= Mild right eyelid ptosis Depending upon the cause it can be classified into: *Neurogenic ptosis which includes oculomotor nerve palsy, Horner's syndrome, Marcus Gunn jaw winking syndrome, third cranial nerve misdirection. *Myogenic ptosis which includes oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy, myasthenia gravis, myotonic dystrophy, ocular myopathy, simple congenital ptosis, blepharophimosis syndrome. *Aponeurotic ptosis which may be involutional or post-operative. *Mechanical ptosis which occurs due to edema or tumors of the upper lid. * Neurotoxic ptosis which is a classic symptom of envenomation by elapid snakes such as cobras, kraits, mambas and taipans. Bilateral ptosis is usually accompanied by diplopia, dysphagia and/or progressive muscular paralysis. Regardless, neurotoxic ptosis is a precursor to respiratory failure and eventual suffocation caused by complete paralysis of the thoracic diaphragm. It is therefore a medical emergency and immediate treatment is required. Similarly, ptosis may occur in victims of Botulism (caused by Botulinum toxin) and this is also regarded as a life-threatening symptom. *Pseudo ptosis due to: # Lack of lid support: empty socket or atrophic globe. # Higher lid position on the other side: as in lid retraction. Hollywood actor Forest Whitaker has a left eye ptosis Treatment Aponeurotic and congenital ptosis may require surgical correction if severe enough to interfere with the vision or if appearance is a concern. Treatment depends on the type of ptosis, and is usually performed by an ophthalmic plastic surgeon or a reconstructive surgeon who specializes in diseases and problems of the eyelid. If the condition occurs in a child, then the doctor will delay the surgery until the patient is 4 or 5 years old. If the patient is under the recommended age for surgery, then the doctor will test if occlusion therapy can compensate for the patient's impeded vision. The reason for delaying the surgery until the patient is at least 4-5 years of age is due to the delay for the frontonasal and upper face to complete their complex growth. After this complex growth is complete, the doctors will be able to obtain a more accurate measurement of the conditions. However, if the patient's vision impediment worsens or proves unresponsive to the occlusion therapy, then surgery will be needed sooner. Surgical procedures include: *Levator resection *M√ºller muscle resection *Frontalis sling operation (preferred option for oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy) *Whitnall Sling The Frontalis sling surgery can only be done if the patient‚Äôs ptosis condition is due to diseased or stretched-out muscles. The stretching-out of muscle is due to age. The frontalis sling surgery is done to either tighten or shorten the affected muscles, thereby allowing the process to raise the patient‚Äôs lid‚Äôs resting position. The procedure is done with the doctor using the sling to loop the material, then threading it underneath the patient‚Äôs eyebrows and above the lashes.Once the sling has been tightened, this allows the patient‚Äôs forehead‚Äôs muscle to aid in lifting the lid. The sling can be looped in a pentagon shape, triangle (singular or double) shape. There are many different types of slings in the market today include monofilament nylon, silicone rods, polyester, silk, collagen, stainless steel or polypropylene. Frontalis sling surgery is considered the most effective surgical treatment for moderate to severe congenital ptosis. Many different materials can be used for the surgery, though it is currently unclear which material has the highest success rate. The Levator Resection and Advancement surgery should only be considered for patients who are experiencing a levator function less than or equal to 5 mm. The levator function is a measurement of the distance that the eyelid travels starting with the downgaze moving to the upgaze without moving the frontalis muscle.Although this procedure can be completed through two different approaches, the internal and the external, the external approach allows the surgeons to obtain a better view of the surgical site during the procedure. The surgeon will begin with an incision on the eyelid. Once the levator has been exposed, the surgeon either fold it or cut it off before suturing it to the tarsal plate. During this procedure, it is up to the surgeon to decide the height and the contour of the patient‚Äôs eyelid, with input from the patient. The Whitnall Sling procedure is done with an incision from the levator to the Whitnall ligament. Then the surgeon will suture the Whitnall‚Äôs ligament connecting it to the superior tarsal edge. This procedure most likely is done if the patients are concerned about cosmetic appearance. The Whitnall Sling procedure is able to provide a better cosmetic result because the procedure is able to keep the Whitnall‚Äôs ligament intact. This allows the support of the lacrimal gland and temporal eyelid to be maintained. Despite the gains that the patient can obtain from the surgeries, there are risk factors. After the surgery, the patient may experience asymmetrical (uneven) eyelids. If the surgery was not done carefully, the patient may experience dry eyes due to the eye no longer fully closing. The patient may also experience bleeding after the surgery and infections, if the surgical site is not taken care of properly.On rare occasions, the patient will experience a loss in eyelid movement. Non-surgical modalities like the use of \\"crutch\\" glasses or ptosis crutches or special scleral contact lenses to support the eyelid may also be used. Ptosis that is caused by a disease may improve if the disease is treated successfully, although some related diseases, such as oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy, currently have no cures.  Prognosis  If the ptosis is left untreated, then patients may experience amblyopia, also known as lazy eye, which can permanently damage the patient‚Äôs vision. After careful observation and planning from specialists, ptosis can be successfully treated. Treatment like surgery will allow the patient to begin experiencing improvement in vision as well as cosmetic results. Among all the patients who were previously treated with ptosis, half required additional surgery within 8 to 10 years of the first surgery. If the ptosis is not related to major health issues (such as cancerous tumours or traumatic injuries), then the condition will not shorten the patient‚Äôs life expectancy.  Epidemiology  According to ophthalmology studies done on ptosis patients, occurrence rates are as follows. The average age for females experiencing aponeurotic ptosis is 67.83 years and the corresponding male average age is 68.19. The average age for congenital ptosis is 12.27 years for females and 8.57 years for males. The average age for mechanical ptosis is 49.41 years in females and 43.30 years in males. The average age for myogenic ptosis is 53.45 for females and 43.30 for males. The average age for neurogenic ptosis is 43.6 years in females and 32.62 years in males. Lastly, the average age for traumatic ptosis is 35.12 years in females and 33.4 years in males. Ptosis was not found to have any overall gender or racial preference.  Research Directions  Current studies have indicated that previous methods such as occlusion therapy and surgery are considered to be the most appropriate for treating this condition. Further studies are encouraged to be able to determine the optimal surgical indications. Any discoveries on approaches with dry eye will help further the oculoplastic surgeries. Etymology Ptosis is derived from the Greek word œÄœÑ·ø∂œÉŒπœÇ (\\"fall\\"), and is defined as the \\"abnormal lowering or prolapse of an organ or body part.\\" See also * Apraxia of lid opening References Further reading *The AMA Medical Guide, Random House, Inc.

In 2012, it signed to Merge Records. The band's current lineup includes songwriter Greg Cartwright (lead vocals/guitar), Benny Trokan (bass), Mike Catanese (guitar), Mikey Post (drums) and Dave Amels (organ). As of 2019, along with fronting Reigning Sound, Cartwright also reformed his past band Greg Oblivian and the Tip Tops. In 2020, he also reformed with the original \\"Memphis lineup\\" of Reigning Sound is once again playing shows with the outfit's first incarnation. History Reigning Sound was formed in 2001 by Memphis garage punk musician Greg Cartwright (vocals/guitar), who is also known for his bands the Compulsive Gamblers and the Oblivians. Originally, the Memphis-based band featured Cartwright, Jeremy Scott (bass), Greg Roberson (drums) and Alex Greene (keyboards and guitar). However, after Cartwright re-located his family to Asheville, North Carolina in 2004, bassist David Wayne Gay, drummer Lance Wille, and keyboardist Dave Amels joined Cartwright until October 2011. Reigning Sound's debut was Two Sides to Every Man, a three-song 7\\", released in May 2001; one month later came their first full-length album Break Up, Break Down (Sympathy for the Record Industry). With its country-folk melodies, the first album was to be an early blueprint of where Cartwright's songwriting was headed. Time Bomb High School (In the Red) was released in August 2002, and is known for its polished sound, pop hooks and delicate balance of classic R&B; and rock & roll. Aside from the originals on the album, Cartwright blended in cover songs like \\"Stormy Weather\\" and \\"Brown Paper Sack\\", producing them in the same recognizable sound the band had developed. Reigning Sound's third album Too Much Guitar (In the Red) was released in May 2004 with recording help from fellow Memphians Jay Reatard and Alicja Trout from the Lost Sounds; with a noticeably louder and noisier sound than previous recordings. Songs laced with psych-pop, garage, soul, country and (of course) too-much guitar compete with Cartwright's vocals at times in the loud fuzzy mix. An opening slot on a huge American tour with the Swedish garage band The Hives helped to promote the album shortly after its release. A misprint in the album credits gives the impression that founding member Alex Greene appeared on only one song. In fact, he played on half the album: \\"You Got Me Hummin'\\", \\"When You Touch Me,\\" \\"Get It,\\" \\"Drowning,\\" \\"Uptight Tonight,\\" \\"Let Yourself Go,\\" and \\"Medication.\\" Reigning Sound: Live at Maxwell's (Telstar/Spoonful) was released in July 2005. The notorious end of the gig features Cartwright (with no back-up set) breaking all but three guitar strings but still finishing the show for the rowdy crowd. This rough-sounding live album is the only record featuring the Sam Cooke cover track \\"I Need You Now,\\" as a homage by Cartwright to one of his favorite singers. In September 2005, The Reigning Sound released a rarities comp Home for Orphans (Sympathy for the Record Industry). The album features slower, moodier alternate versions of tunes from \\"Too Much Guitar\\" along with some other unreleased tracks. Late in January 2006, Memphis based Goner Records released The Reigning Sound: Live at Goner Records, a daytime in-store performance recorded in June 2005. The album also hosts cover songs like \\"Black Sheep\\" by Sam the Sham and the Pharaohs, \\"Tennessee\\" by Carl Perkins and \\"Do Something\\" by The Swingin' Yo-Yo's. After spending a portion of 2005 recording an album for George Soule with Dan Penn and Spooner Oldham, the band once again began recording with Mary Weiss (of the 60s band The Shangri-Las, widely known for their hit \\"Leader of the Pack\\"). Reigning Sound was the backing band on the first new Mary Weiss album in over three decades. Cartwright also co-produced the album with Billy Miller and wrote nine of the 14 songs featured on the record. Norton Records released \\"Dangerous Game\\" in March 2007, receiving favorable reviews from the likes of Rolling Stone as well as performing with Weiss on NBC's Late Night with Conan O'Brien. Reigning Sound released a new full-length album Love & Curses on In the Red Records in August 2009, featuring 14 songs and one cover, \\"Stick Over Me\\", originally recorded by a '60s band called The Glass Sun (interpreted on the album as \\"Stick Up for Me\\"). In September 2010, Reigning Sound's cover of \\"Mind Over Matter\\", a '50s R&B; cover, was featured on the compilation Daddy Rockin Strong: A Tribute to Nolan Strong & The Diablos, an album of current garage-punk bands covering the late Nolan Strong. In October 2011, Reigning Sound released a digital \\"mini-LP\\" called Abdication ... For Your Love on the Scion Audio Visual label. The eight-song collection was released as a free digital download; however, some limited edition vinyl and promo CDs were also pressed. Five tracks from this EP were recorded and produced by Dan Auerbach of The Black Keys. While some of the songs featured Cartwright alongside drummer Lance Willie and bassist David Wayne Gay, this would be the last recordings the two would appear on - Wille and Gay would leave the band just before the release of Abdication. The new, current line-up includes Benny Trokan (bass), Mike Catanese (guitar), and Mikey Post (drums); Dave Amels (keyboardist) also remains in the current line-up. The band signed to Merge Records in September 2012. Discography =Albums= * Break Up, Break Down * Time Bomb High School * Too Much Guitar * Home for Orphans * Dangerous Game - Mary Weiss (feat.

It is used in the construction of transformers, inductors, motors, generators, speakers, hard disk head actuators, electromagnets, electric guitar pickups and other applications that require tight coils of insulated wire. The wire itself is most often fully annealed, electrolytically refined copper. Aluminium magnet wire is sometimes used for large transformers and motors. The insulation is typically made of tough polymer film materials rather than vitreous enamel, as the name might suggest. Construction =Conductor= The most suitable materials for magnet wire applications are unalloyed pure metals, particularly copper. When factors such as chemical, physical, and mechanical property requirements are considered, copper is considered the first choice conductor for magnet wire. Most often, magnet wire is composed of fully annealed, electrolytically refined copper to allow closer winding when making electromagnetic coils. High-purity oxygen-free copper grades are used for high-temperature applications in reducing atmospheres or in motors or generators cooled by hydrogen gas. Aluminium magnet wire is sometimes used as an alternative for large transformers and motors. Because of its lower electrical conductivity, aluminium wire requires a 1.6-times larger cross sectional area than a copper wire to achieve comparable DC resistance. Insulation Although described as \\"enameled\\", enameled wire is not, in fact, coated with a layer of enamel paint or vitreous enamel made of fused glass powder. Modern magnet wire typically uses one to four layers (in the case of quad-film type wire) of polymer film insulation, often of two different compositions, to provide a tough, continuous insulating layer. Magnet wire insulating films use (in order of increasing temperature range) polyvinyl formal (Formvar), polyurethane, polyamide, polyester, polyester-polyimide, polyamide-polyimide (or amide- imide), and polyimide. Polyimide insulated magnet wire is capable of operation at up to 250 ¬∞C. The insulation of thicker square or rectangular magnet wire is often augmented by wrapping it with a high-temperature polyimide or fiberglass tape, and completed windings are often vacuum impregnated with an insulating varnish to improve insulation strength and long-term reliability of the winding. Self-supporting coils are wound with wire coated with at least two layers, the outermost being a thermoplastic that bonds the turns together when heated. Other types of insulation such as fiberglass yarn with varnish, aramid paper, kraft paper, mica, and polyester film are also widely used across the world for various applications like transformers and reactors. In the audio sector, a wire of silver construction, and various other insulators, such as cotton (sometimes permeated with some kind of coagulating agent/thickener, such as beeswax) and polytetrafluoroethylene (Teflon) can be found. Older insulation materials included cotton, paper, or silk, but these are only useful for low-temperature applications (up to 105¬∞C). For ease of manufacturing, some low-temperature-grade magnet wire has insulation that can be removed by the heat of soldering. This means that electrical connections at the ends can be made without stripping off the insulation first. =Cross- section= Smaller diameter magnet wire usually has a round cross-section. This kind of wire is used for things such as electric guitar pickups. Thicker magnet wire is often square, rectangular or hexagonal (with rounded corners) in cross section, packing more efficiently and having greater structural stability and thermal conductivity across adjacent turns. Classification Like other wire, magnet wire is classified by diameter (AWG number, SWG or millimeters) or area (square millimeters), temperature class, and insulation class. Cross-sectional view of AWG33 magnet wire taken using a scanning electron microscope Breakdown voltage depends on the thickness of the covering, which can be of 3 types: Grade 1, Grade 2 and Grade 3. Higher grades have thicker insulation and thus higher breakdown voltages. The temperature class indicates the temperature of the wire at which it has a 20,000 hour service life. At lower temperatures the service life of the wire is longer (about a factor of 2 for every 10 ¬∞C lower temperature). Common temperature classes are 105 ¬∞C, 130 ¬∞C, 155 ¬∞C, 180 ¬∞C and 220 ¬∞C. Current density In practice maximum current density can vary from 2.5 A/mm2 for a wire isolated from free air to 6 A/mm2 for a wire in free air. If the wire is carrying high frequency currents (above 10 kHz) the skin effect may affect the distribution of the current across the section by concentrating the current on the surface of the conductor. If active cooling is provided by blowing air or circulating water much higher current densities can be achieved - proportionally to the effectiveness of cooling. An aluminium wire must have 1.6 times the cross sectional area as a copper wire to achieve comparable DC resistance. Due to this, copper magnet wires contribute to improving energy efficiency in equipment such as electric motors. Applications Magnet wire is used in windings of electric motors, transformers, inductors, generators, headphones, loudspeaker coils, hard drive head positioners, electromagnets, and other devices.Joseph, G√ºnter, 1999, Copper: Its Trade, Manufacture, Use, and Environmental Status, edited by Kundig, Konrad J.A., ASM International Vol. 2.03, Electrical ConductorsPops, Horace, 1995, Physical Metallurgy of Electrical Conductors, in Nonferrous Wire Handbook, Volume 3: Principles and Practice, The Wire Association International, pp. 7-22 =In electric motors= Copper windings in a miniaturized electric motor Electric motors convert electrical energy into mechanical motion, usually through the interaction of magnetic fields and current-carrying conductors. Electric motors are found in numerous diverse applications, such as fans, blowers, pumps, machines, household appliances, power tools, and disk drives. The very largest electric motors with ratings in the thousands of kilowatts are used in such applications as the propulsion of large ships. The smallest motors move the hands in electric wristwatches. Electric motors contain coils to produce the required magnetic fields. For a given size of motor frame, high conductivity material reduces the energy loss due to coil resistance. Poorer conductors generate more waste heat when transferring electrical energy into kinetic energy. Because of its high electrical conductivity, copper is commonly used in coil windings, bearings, collectors, brushes, and connectors of motors, including the highest quality motors. Copper‚Äôs greater conductivity versus other materials enhances the electrical energy efficiency of motors. For example, to reduce load losses in continuous-use induction-type motors above 1 horsepower, manufacturers invariably use copper as the conducting material in windings. Aluminium is an alternate material in smaller horsepower motors, especially when motors are not used continuously. One of the design elements of premium motors is the reduction of heat losses due to the electrical resistance of conductors. To improve the electrical energy efficiency of induction-type motors, load loss can be reduced by increasing the cross section of copper coils. A high efficiency motor will usually have 20% more copper in the stator winding than its standard counterpart. Early developments in motor efficiency focused on reducing electrical losses by increasing the packing weight of stator windings. This made sense since electrical losses typically account for more than half of all energy losses, and stator losses account for approximately two‚Äêthirds of electrical losses. There are, however, disadvantages in increasing the electrical efficiency of motors through larger windings. This increases motor size and cost, which may not be desirable in applications such as appliances and in automobiles.The emerging electrical markets for copper, Bloomsbury Minerals Economics LTD, July 6, 2010 =In transformers= Stranded copper Litz wire is used for certain high-frequency transformers A transformer is a device that transfers electrical energy from one circuit to another through its coils (windings). The properties needed for motor windings are similar to those needed for transformers, but with the additional requirement to withstand mechanical vibration and centrifugal forces at operating temperatures. Transformer windings are normally made from copper but aluminium is a suitable competitor where weight and first cost are decisive factors. In North America, aluminium is the predominant choice of winding material for low-voltage, dry-type transformers larger than 15 kilovolt-amperes (kVA). In most other areas of the world, copper is the predominant winding material. Purchasing decisions are generally a function of loss valuations expressed in currency per kilowatt. Copper used for the manufacture of transformer windings is in the form of wire for small products and strip for larger equipment. For small products, the wire must be strong enough to be wound without breakage, yet flexible enough to provide close-packed windings. Strip products must be of good surface quality so that insulating enamels do not break down under voltage. Good ductility is essential for the strip to be formed and packed while good strength is needed to withstand the high electro-mechanical stresses set up under occasional short-circuit conditions. Copper winding wires in transformers are compatible with all modern insulation materials, such as lacquer and enamel. Lacquers permit the close spacing of windings to give best efficiency in the coils. A major engineering reason to choose copper windings over aluminium is space considerations. This is because a copper-wound transformer can be made smaller than aluminium transformers. To obtain equal ratings in aluminium transformers, a 66% larger cross-sectional area is required than for copper conductors. However, the use of larger-sized conductors results in aluminium winding strength nearly equivalent to copper windings. Connectivity is another important benefit of copper-wound transformers. Cleaning and brushing with a quality joint compound to prevent oxidation is not necessary with copper. =In generators= The trend in modern generators is to operate at higher temperatures and higher electrical conductivities with oxygen-free copper for field bars and magnetic wire in place of formerly used deoxidized copper.

Built in Jacobean style in 1858 to designs of W. J. Stent, it is owned by a charitable trust. The building was originally a literary institution with a large lecture room, a reading room, classrooms and a library. In 1912, Albany Ward converted the lecture room into the Palace Cinema which was also used for plays, operas and music. The Athenaeum has been closed three times in its history, most recently in 1997, when West Wiltshire District Council stopped funding several halls in its five towns. There was then believed to be a danger of the building being sold, demolished, or redeveloped, but the District Council handed over trusteeship of the charity which owns the building to the newly formed Athenaeum Trust. The trust launched a restoration appeal, and by 2015 had already spent over ¬£100,000 on the building, cleaning the facade, replacing the roof, and completely refurbishing the bar and function room.

Approximately 25% of the high school student body is made up of marching band members. There has been an array of band directors with a different variety of marching styles. Currently the director is Mr. Sean Sullivan, with assistant director Robert Black, as well as Hurricette dance line advisor Kristen Sullivan. The band performs a wide variety of songs - classics such as \\"The Music of the Night\\" (2009) from the Phantom of the Opera, the popular Shaker hymn \\"Simple Gifts\\" (2005), or Beethoven's \\"Ode to Joy\\" (2008), to the official 2007 NBA song, \\"Right Now\\". The 2010 season featured songs such as \\"Thanks for the Memories\\" by Fall Out Boy, \\"Rhythm is Gonna Get You\\", \\"I'm Walking on Sunshine\\", and \\"Trooper Salute\\". The band has performed in the Magic Music Days program at Walt Disney World Resort in Lake Buena Vista, Florida in 2007, 2010, and 2014. The band also performed at the city's annual Home Days Festival before its cancellation in 2008. The band performs at many shows, band festivals, and competitions and is considered one of the most active bands in the conference. Elvis visit The school gained notoriety on October 20, 1955, when Elvis Presley performed in their auditorium. It was the first ever concert Elvis performed in the northern United States. It is also believed to be the first filmed concert in Elvis' career. It would be nearly a year before he appeared on The Ed Sullivan Show for the first time. Elvis was not the headliner at the concert organized by legendary Cleveland DJ Bill Randle. The other, more popular performers were Bill Haley & His Comets, The Four Lads, and Pat Boone. On October 20, 2005, some of the acts returned to participate in an anniversary event for this visit. Among the acts were Priscilla Wright and Bill Haley's Original Comets. The BHS Chorale also performed a song with Priscilla Wright.

Jurydyki claimed exemption from the town's jurisdiction, and exerted municipal rights separate from the local laws usually for their owners' financial benefit. History Jurydyki were popular already in the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth of the 16 century, ruled by the ecclesiastic and secular lords and seigneurs eager to break up the legal unity of the town to accommodate favoured colonies of craftsmen not subjected to guild regulations. The Jurydyki were often perceived as a menace withholding municipal taxes and services under the jurisdiction (hence the name) of powerful and wealthy townsmen who founded and owned them. Formed as a separate unit of territorial division between 14th and 16th centuries, the jurydyka-type settlements were a way in which the Roman Catholic Church and the Polish nobility avoided the terms of the royal town charters. Most notably, the Jurydyki were exempted from the specific trade laws allowing only selected merchants and craftsmen to take part in the markets held in the cities. In many Polish cities the Jurydyki were eventually incorporated into the towns as their boroughs. This was the case of Warsaw, which in early 18th century was surrounded by no less than 14 such entities, some of them with as many as 5,000 inhabitants. All of them are now neighbourhoods of Warsaw.

In March 1851 the post was moved to a small elevation on the Colorado's west bank. This site had been occupied by Camp Calhoun, named for Senator John C. Calhoun. It was established on October 2, 1849, by 1st Lieutenant Cave J. Couts, 1st Dragoons, for the boundary survey party led by 2nd Lieutenant Amiel W. Whipple, Corps of Topographical Engineers. A ferry service, maintained by the soldiers for the survey party's convenience, also accommodated emigrants. Fort Yuma was established during the Yuma War to protect the southern emigrant travel route to California and to attempt control of the territorial Quechan, or Yumans, in their homeland, the surrounding area. Established by Captain Samuel P. Heintzelman, 2nd Infantry Regiment, the fort was originally named 'Camp Independence.' In March 1851, when the post was moved to its permanent site, its name was changed to Camp Yuma. A year later the post was designated Fort Yuma. In June 1851 the Army virtually abandoned the post because of the high costs incurred in maintaining it, and it was completely abandoned on December 6, 1851, when its commissary was practically empty of provisions. The post, however, was reoccupied by Captain Heintzelman on February 29, 1852. It was difficult to supply the post during its early years. Food supplies and construction materials were shipped by water from San Diego, California, around the Baja Peninsula and up the Gulf of California to the mouth of the Colorado River at the Colorado River Delta in Mexico. The work of transferring the goods to wagons at that point and hauling them across the Yuma Desert and Yuha Desert to Yuma was rigorous and time-consuming. Life at the post was harsh and the military's resolve to maintain a garrison here vacillated. Only after August 1852 did the temporary Camp Yuma became permanent Fort Yuma, and the Army resolved to stay for good. In November 1852 a steamboat, Uncle Sam was launched and in December began carrying a cargo up the Colorado River from Robinson's Landing it arrived at Fort Yuma and delivered thirty-two tons of goods on December 3. Steamboats continued to supply the fort and later settlements on the Colorado River in this way until the arrival of the railroad in 1877. Only one military action occurred at the fort when Yuman warriors surrounded it during the Yuma War, temporarily trapping the future general Thomas William Sweeny and a few others. From 1858 to 1861 the Butterfield Overland Mail had a stagecoach station near the fort, that was subsequently used by other stage lines until the advent of the railroad in 1877. =Civil War= During the American Civil War, the Union retained control of Fort Yuma when the First California Infantry replaced Regular Army soldiers sent East in December 1861. The southern half of New Mexico Territory seceded, becoming the Confederate Territory of Arizona until 1862 when the California Column marching from Fort Yuma expelled the Confederacy, marching as far as western Texas. In 1863 the Union established their control of the region as the Arizona Territory. Fort Yuma served as the supply point for the Union garrisons there. There was no battle action at the fort since the western United States was far removed from the Civil War. =Post-Civil War= Fort Yuma was closely associated with the Yuma Quartermaster Depot on the Arizona side of the river, which provided military supplies and personnel to posts throughout Arizona and New Mexico. The Quartermaster Depot operated between 1864 and 1891, though the Army terminated most operations there eight years earlier. The depot was used by the Army to store and distribute supplies for all military posts in Arizona, Nevada, Utah, New Mexico and Texas during the Indian War period. A six-month supply of clothing, food, ammunition, and other goods was stored at the depot at all times. Supplies were brought from California by ocean vessels traveling around the Baja Peninsula to Port Isabel near the mouth of the Colorado River. There, cargos were transferred to river steamers and brought upstream to Yuma. Supplies were unloaded at the depot and hauled up a track running from the dock to a storehouse. The depot quartered up to 900 mules and crews of teamsters to handle them. The Southern Pacific Railroad reached Yuma in 1877. There was little need for the Quartermaster Depot and Fort Yuma, and they were abandoned on May 16, 1883. The reservation was transferred to the Interior Department on July 22, 1884. Present day Fort Yuma is now part of the Fort Yuma Indian Reservation. Numerous historic buildings remain from the military period in the Yuma Crossing and Associated Sites in the Yuma Crossing National Heritage Area. The Yuma Territorial Prison and Yuma Quartermaster Depot State Historic Parks are in Arizona with buildings preserved or reconstructed, and with museums. The Yuma Proving Ground is the lineal Army descendant of these original military posts in the Yuma area. Historic Structures The following images are of the historic structures in Fort Yuma.

History The broadcasting service was originally known as Station ZOY, introduced on 31 July 1935 by the colonial Governor, Sir Arnold Hodson,\\"About Ghana Broadcasting Corporation\\", official website. before it was renamed to the Ghana Broadcasting Corporation upon the country's independence in 1957. Throughout its history it has been independent of the government's Information Services Department.Wells, Alan (1997), World Broadcasting: A Comparative View, Greenwood Publishing Group, p. 162. . Establishment Broadcasting began in Ghana on July 31, 1935 from a wired relay station opened in Accra. The brain behind the introduction of broadcasting into the country was the then Governor of the Gold Coast, Sir Arnold Hodson, affectionately known as the \\"Sunshine Governor\\". He was ably assisted by a British radio engineer, Mr. F.A.W. Byron. By 17:00GMT on that historic day, gramophone records of martial and light music were relayed and at exactly 17:45GMT the voice of Sir Arnold Hodson came through to break the tension and the suspense with this explicit message: ‚ÄúOne of the main reasons for introducing the Relay Service is to bring News, Entertainment and Music into the homes of all and sundry. This will bring to an end the barriers of isolation and ignorance in the path of progress and also to enable the people of Gold Coast to improve on their very rich cultural music\\". Administration The new broadcasting Service was code-named Radio \\"ZOY\\". It was manned by eight technicians and housed in a small bungalow on 9th Road near the Ridge Police Station in Accra. Broadcasting first begun in four Ghanaian languages, namely Fanti, Twi, Ga, Ewe, and later Hausa. Part-time staff were engaged to translate and announce the news in these languages until 1943 when full-time staff were appointed. Between 1946 and 1953, the organisation was administered by the Public Relation Department, now the Information Services Department. 1953 On the recommendation of a commission set up in 1953, the Gold Coast Broadcasting Service (GCBS) was established and from there it became a department in its own right. On attainment of independence in 1957, the Gold Coast was renamed Ghana and the GCBS became Ghana Broadcasting System (GBS). The legislation that basically set up GBC as an establishment was National Liberation Council Degree number 226 (NLCD266) of 1968. Television and radio stations GBC operates GTV (a channel for events that matter most to Ghanaians), which is broadcast nationwide on analogue terrestrial platform. Additionally, GBC runs five digital channels namely, GTV Sports+ (a channel for sports), GBC News (a 24-hour news TV channel) and GTV Life (a religion and culture channel), GTV Govern (a governance channel), Obonu TV (a channel for the people of Greater Accra and window for the Ga-Dangbe) and ten regional and five district radio stations in Ghana. *Uniiq FM *Volta Star *Twin City Radio *Radio Central *Radio Savannah *Garden City Radio *URA Radio *Radio Upper West *Sunrise FM *Obonu FM *Radio BAR See also * Media of Ghana * Communications in Ghana External links *Official Site of Ghana Broadcasting Corporation - GBC References Further reading Category:Broadcasting in Ghana Category:Mass media companies of Ghana Category:Mass media in Accra Category:Publicly funded broadcasters Category:Radio stations in Ghana Category:State media Category:Mass media companies established in 1935 Category:1935 establishments in Gold Coast (British colony) Category:British companies established in 1935 ","title":"Ghana Broadcasting Corporation"},{"id":"6613471","text":"A Man Called Shenandoah is an American western series that aired Monday evenings on ABC-TV from September 13, 1965 to May 16, 1966.

He learns that he had been a Union officer during the American Civil War, and comes to believe that he had been married.

Horton, who had performed in musical theater, also sang the song.Eder, Bruce, liner notes for Small Screen Cowboy Heroes (AT 57474), Sony Music Distribution His recording became a Columbia single in 1965. It is from Horton's Columbia album The Man Called Shenandoah (Cs-9208, stereo; Cl-2408, mono; both 1965). The series is surprisingly popular on Rhodesian Television (RTV) in central Africa, and the song, reworked by local talent Nick Taylor, reached Number 3 on the Rhodesian Broadcasting Corporation hit parade.Illustrated Life Rhodesia magazine, July 14, 1972 Broadcast When reruns of the series aired on Turner Network Television in the 1990s, only 29 of the 34 episodes were rebroadcast.

The question as to the existence of culture in non-human societies has been a contentious subject for decades, largely due to the lack of a concise definition for the word \\"culture\\". However, many leading scientists agree on seeing culture as a process, rather than an end product. This process, most agree, involves the social transmittance of novel behaviour, both among peers and between generations.De Waal, Frans. The Ape and the Sushi Master: Cultural Reflections by a Primatologist. New York: Basic Books, 2001. Such behaviour can be shared by a group of animals, but not necessarily between separate groups of the same species. The notion of culture in other animals dates back to Aristotle in classical antiquity, and more recently to Charles Darwin, but the association of other animals' actions with the actual word \\"culture\\" first originated with Japanese primatologists' discoveries of socially-transmitted food behaviours in the 1940s. Laland, Kevin N. and Bennett G. Galef, eds. The Question of Animal Culture. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard UP, 2009. What is culture? Culture can be defined as \\"all group-typical behavior patterns, shared by members of animal communities, that are to some degree reliant on socially learned and transmitted information\\".Kevin N. Laland and Vincent M. Janik. Trends in Ecology & Evolution Vol. 21 No. 10. =Organizational culture= One definition of culture, particularly in relation to the organizational aspect is the utilization of \\"involvement, consistency, adaptation, and mission.\\" Cultural traits that are indicators of a successful form of organization are more likely to be assimilated into our everyday lives. Organizations that utilize the four aforementioned aspects of culture are the ones that are the most successful. Therefore, cultures that are better able to involve their citizens towards a common goal have a much higher rate of effectiveness than those who do not have a shared goal. A further definition of culture is, \\"[s]ocially transmitted behavior patterns that serve to relate human communities to their ecological settings.\\" This definition connects cultural behavior to the environment. Since culture is a form of adaptation to ones environment, it is mirrored in many aspects of our current and past societies. =Cultural sociology= Other researchers are currently exploring the idea that there is a connection between cultural sociology and psychology. Certain individuals are especially concerned with the analysis of studies connecting \\"identity, collective memory, social classification, logics of action, and framing.\\" Views of what exactly culture is has been changing due to the recent convergence of sociological and psychological thought on the subject. \\"Recent work depicts culture as fragmented across groups and inconsistent across its manifestations. The view of culture as values that diffuse other aspects of belief, intention, and collective life has succumbed to one of culture as complex rule-like structures that constitute resources that can be put to strategic use.\\" Culture is specific to region and not just one umbrella definition or concept can truly give us the essence of what culture is. Also referenced is the importance of symbols and rituals as cognitive building blocks for a psychological concept of shared culture. =Memes and cultural transmission= Richard Dawkins argues for the existence of a \\"unit of cultural transmission\\" called a meme. This concept of memes has become much more accepted as more extensive research has been done into cultural behaviors. Much as one can inherit genes from each parent, it is suggested that individuals acquire memes through imitating what they observe around them. The more relevant actions (actions that increase ones probability of survival), such as architecture and craftwork are more likely to become prevalent, enabling a culture to form. The idea of memes as following a form of Natural Selection was first presented by Daniel Dennett. It has also been argued by Dennett that memes are responsible for the entirety of human consciousness. He claims that everything that constitutes humanity, such as language and music is a result of memes and the unflinching hold they have on our thought processes. =Evolutionary culture= A closely related concept to memes is the idea of evolutionary culture. The validity of the concept of evolutionary culture has been increasing recently due to the re-evaluation of the term by anthropologists. The broadening scope of evolution from simple genes to more abstract concepts, such as designs and behaviors makes the idea of evolutionary culture more plausible. Evolutionary culture theory is defined as \\"a theory of cultural phylogeny.\\" The idea that all human culture evolved from one main culture has been presented, citing the interconnectedness of languages as one of his examples has also been presented. There is, however, also the possibility for disparate ancestral cultures, in that the cultures we see today may potentially have stemmed from more than one original culture. =Culture in other animals= According to the Webster's dictionary definition of culture, learning and transmission are the two main components of culture, specifically referencing tool making and the ability to acquire behaviors that will enhance one's quality of life. Using this definition it is possible to conclude that other animals are just as likely to adapt to cultural behaviors as humans. One of the first signs of culture in early humans was the utilization of tools. Chimpanzees have been observed using tools such as rocks and sticks to obtain better access to food. There are other learned activities that have been exhibited by other animals as well. Some examples of these activities that have been shown by varied animals are opening oysters, swimming, washing of food, and unsealing tin lids. This acquisition and sharing of behaviors correlates directly to the existence of memes. It especially reinforces the natural selection component, seeing as these actions employed by other animals are all mechanisms for making their lives easier, and therefore longer. History of animal culture theory Though the idea of 'culture' in other animals has only been around for just over half of a century, scientists have been noting social behaviors of other animals for centuries. Aristotle was the first to provide evidence of social learning in the songs of birds. Charles Darwin first attempted to find the existence of imitation in other animals when attempting to prove his theory that the human mind had evolved from that of lower beings. Darwin was also the first to suggest what became known as social learning in attempting to explain the transmission of an adaptive pattern of behavior through a population of honey bees.Heyes, Cecelia M. and Bennett G. Galef, Jr., eds. Social Learning in Animals: The Roots of Culture. San Diego: Academic Press, 1996. The vast majority of cultural anthropological research has been done on non-human primates, due to their being closest evolutionary to humans. In non-primate animals, research tends to be limited, and therefore evidence for culture strongly lacking. However, the subject has become more popular recently, and has prompted the initiation of more research into the area. = Whiten's Culture in Chimpanzees = Andrew Whiten, professor of Evolutionary and Developmental Psychology at the University of St. Andrews, contributed to the greater understanding of cultural transmission with his work on chimpanzees. In Cultural Traditions in Chimpanzees, Whiten created a compilation of results from seven long-term studies totaling 151 years of observation analyzing behavioral patterns in different communities of chimpanzees in Africa (read more about it below). The study expanded the notion that cultural behavior lies beyond linguistic mediation, and can be interpreted to include distinctive socially learned behavior such as stone-handling and sweet potato washing in Japanese macaques. The implications of their findings indicate that chimpanzee behavioral patterns mimic the distinct behavioral variants seen in different human populations in which cultural transmission has generally always been an accepted concept. = Cavalli-Sforza and Feldman models = Population geneticists Cavalli-Sforza & Feldman have also been frontrunners in the field of cultural transmission, describing behavioral \\"traits\\" as characteristics pertaining to a culture that are recognizable within that culture. Using a quantifiable approach, Cavalli-Sforza & Feldman were able to produce mathematical models for three forms of cultural transmission, each of which have distinct effects on socialization: vertical, horizontal, and oblique. * Vertical transmission occurs from parents to offspring and is a function which shows that the probability that parents of specific types give rise to an offspring of their own or of another type. Vertical transmission, in this sense, is similar to genetic transmission in biological evolution as mathematical models for gene transmission account for variation. Vertical transmission also contributes strongly to the buildup of between-population variation. * Horizontal transmission is cultural transmission taking place among peers in a given population. While horizontal transmission is expected to result in faster within-group evolution due to the relationship building between peers of a population, it is expected to result in less between-group variation than the vertical transmission model would allow for. * Oblique transmission is cultural transmission being passed from one generation to another younger generation, such as is done by teaching, and the result of reproducing information across generations is a rapid loss of variation within that specific population. Unlike vertical transmission, oblique transmission doesn't need to occur strictly between parent and offspring; it can occur between less-related generations (e.g. from grandparent to grandchild), or from an individual to a non-related younger individual of the same species. Mechanisms of cultural transmission in animals Cultural transmission, also known as cultural learning, is the process and method of passing on socially learned information. Within a species, cultural transmission is greatly influenced by how adults socialize with each other and with their young. Differences in cultural transmission across species have been thought to be largely affected by external factors, such as the physical environment, that may lead an individual to interpret a traditional concept in a novel way. The environmental stimuli that contribute to this variance can include climate, migration patterns, conflict, suitability for survival, and endemic pathogens. Cultural transmission can also vary according to different social learning strategies employed at the species and or individual level. Cultural transmission is hypothesized to be a critical process for maintaining behavioral characteristics in both humans and nonhuman animals over time, and its existence relies on innovation, imitation, and communication to create and propagate various aspects of animal behavior seen today. Culture, when defined as the transmission of behaviors from one generation to the next, can be transmitted among animals through various methods.Matsuzawa, Tetsur≈ç, Masaki Tomonaga, and M. Tanaka. Cognitive Development in Chimpanzees. Tokyo: Springer, 2006. The most common of these methods include imitation, teaching, and language. Imitation has been found to be one of the most prevalent modes of cultural transmission in non-human animals, while teaching and language are much less widespread, with the possible exceptions of primates and cetaceans. Recent research has suggested that teaching, as opposed to imitation, may be a characteristic of certain animals who have more advanced cultural capacities, though this is debatable. The likelihood of larger groups within a species developing and sharing these intra-species traditions with peers and offspring is much higher than that of one individual spreading some aspect of animal behavior to one or more members. This is why cultural transmission has been shown to be superior to individual learning, as it is a more efficient manner of spreading traditions and allowing members of a species to collectively inherit more adaptive behavior.Michael L. Best. Adaptive Behavior 1999 7: 289. This process by which offspring within a species acquires his or her own culture through mimicry or being introduced to traditions is referred to as enculturation. The role of cultural transmission in cultural evolution, then, is to provide the outlet for which organisms create and spread traditions that shape patterns of animal behavior visibly over generations. =Genetic vs. cultural transmission= Culture, which was once thought of as a uniquely human trait, is now firmly established as a common trait among animals and is not merely a set of related behaviors passed on by genetic transmission as some have argued. Genetic transmission, like cultural transmission, is a means of passing behavioral traits from one individual to another. The main difference is that genetic transmission is the transfer of behavioral traits from one individual to another through genes which are transferred to an organism from its parents during the fertilization of the egg. As can be seen, genetic transmission can only occur once during the lifetime of an organism.Bonner, John Tyler (1980) The Evolution of Culture in Animals. Princeton University Press, Princeton Thus, genetic transmission is quite slow compared to the relative speed of cultural transmission. In cultural transmission, behavioral information is passed through means of verbal, visual, or written methods of teaching. Therefore, in cultural transmission, new behaviors can be learned by many organisms in a matter of days and hours rather than the many years of reproduction it would take for a behavior to spread among organisms in genetic transmission. = Social learning = Culture can be transmitted among animals through various methods, the most common of which include imitation, teaching, and language. Imitation is one of the most prevalent modes of cultural transmission in non-human animals, while teaching and language are much less widespread. In a study on food acquisition techniques in meerkats (Suricata suricatta), researchers found evidence that meerkats learned foraging tricks through imitation of conspecifics. The experimental setup consisted of an apparatus containing food with two possible methods that could be used to obtain the food. Na√Øve meerkats learned and used the method exhibited by the \\"demonstrator\\" meerkat trained in one of the two techniques. Although in this case, imitation is not the clear mechanism of learning given that the na√Øve meerkat could simply have been drawn to certain features of the apparatus from observing the \\"demonstrator\\" meerkat and from there discovered the technique on their own. =Teaching= Teaching is often considered one mechanism of social learning, and occurs when knowledgeable individuals of some species have been known to teach others. For this to occur, a teacher must change its behavior when interacting with a na√Øve individual and incur an initial cost from teaching, while an observer must acquire skills rapidly as a direct consequence. Until recently, teaching was a skill that was thought to be uniquely human.Monkeys Are Adept at Picking Up Social Cues, Research Shows April 25, 2013 New York Times Now, as research has increased into the transmission of culture in animals, the role of teaching among animal groups has become apparent. Teaching is not merely limited to mammals either. Many insects, for example have been observed demonstrating various forms of teaching in order to obtain food. Ants, for example, will guide each other to food sources through a process called \\"tandem running\\", in which an ant will guide a companion ant to a source of food.Hoppitt WJ, GR Brown, R Kendal, L Rendell, A Thornton, MM Webster, and KN Laland. Lessons from Animal Teaching. Trends in Ecology & Evolution (Personal Edition). 23. 9 (2008): 486-93. It has been suggested that the \\"pupil\\" ant is able to learn this route in order to obtain food in the future or teach the route to other ants. There have been various recent studies that show that cetaceans are able to transmit culture through teaching as well. Killer whales are known to \\"intentionally beach\\" themselves in order to catch and eat pinnipeds who are breeding on the shore.Rendell L, and H Whitehead. Culture in Whales and Dolphins. The Behavioral and Brain Sciences. 24. 2 (2001): 309-24. Mother killer whales teach their young to catch pinnipeds by pushing them onto the shore and encouraging them to attack and eat the prey. Because the mother killer whale is altering her behavior in order to help her offspring learn to catch prey, this is evidence of teaching and cultural learning. The intentional beaching of the killer whales, along with other cetacean behaviors such as the variations of songs among humpback whales and the sponging technique used by the bottlenose dolphin to obtain food, provide substantial support for the idea of cetacean cultural transmission. Teaching is arguably the social learning mechanism that affords the highest fidelity of information transfer between individuals and generations, and allows a direct pathway through which local traditions can be passed down and transmitted. =Imitation= Imitation can be found in a few members of the avian world, in particular the parrot. Imitation forms the basis of culture, but does not on its own imply culture. Imitation is often misinterpreted as merely the observation and copying of another's actions. This would be known as mimicry, because the repetition of the observed action is done for no other purpose than to copy the original doer or speaker. In the scientific community, imitation is rather the process in which an organism purposefully observes and copies the methods of another in order to achieve a tangible goal.Hurley, S. L., and Nick Chater. Perspectives on Imitation From Neuroscience to Social Science. CogNet. Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press, 2005. Therefore, the identification and classification of animal behavior as being imitation has been very difficult. Recent research into imitation in animals has resulted in the tentative labeling of certain species of birds, monkeys, apes, and cetaceans as having the capacity for imitation. For example, a Grey parrot by the name of Alex underwent a series of tests and experiments at the University of Arizona in which scientist Irene Pepperberg judged his ability to imitate the human language in order to create vocalizations and object labels. Through the efforts of Pepperberg, Alex has been able to learn a large vocabulary of English words and phrases. Alex can then combine these words and phrases to make completely new words which are meaningless, but utilize the phonetic rules of the English language.Pepperberg, Irene M. Grey Parrots Do Not Always 'parrot': the Roles of Imitation and Phonological Awareness in the Creation of New Labels from Existing Vocalizations. Alex's capabilities of using and understanding more than 80 words, along with his ability to put together short phrases, demonstrates how birds, who many people do not credit with having deep intellect, can actually imitate and use rudimentary language skills in an effective manner.Hillix, William A., and Duane M. Rumbaugh. Animal Bodies, Human Minds: Ape, Dolphin, and Parrot Language Skills. Developments in primatology. New York: Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, 2004. The results of this experiment culminated with the conclusion that the use of the English language to refer to objects is not unique to humans and is arguably true imitation, a basic form of cultural learning found in young children. =Language= Language is another key indicator of animals who have greater potential to possess culture. Though animals do not naturally use words like humans when they are communicating, the well-known parrot Alex demonstrated that even animals with small brains, but are adept at imitation can have a deeper understanding of language after lengthy training. A bonobo named Kanzi has taken the use of the English language even further. Kanzi was taught to recognize words and their associations by using a lexigram board. Through observation of its mother's language training, Kanzi was able to learn how to use the lexigrams to obtain food and other items that he desired. Also, Kanzi is able to use his understanding of lexigrams to decipher and comprehend simple sentences. For example, when he was told to \\"give the doggie a shot,\\" Kanzi grabbed a toy dog and a syringe and gave it a realistic injection. This type of advanced behavior and comprehension is what scientists have used as evidence for language-based culture in animals. Primate culture A bonobo fishing for termites using a sharpened stick. Tool usage in acquiring food is believed to be a cultural behavior.The beginning of the modern era of animal culture research in the middle of the 20th century came with the gradual acceptance of the term \\"culture\\" in referring to animals. Japan's leading primatologist of the time, Kinji Imanishi, first used the word with a prefix as the term \\"pre-culture\\" in referring to the now famous potato-washing behavior of Japanese macaques. In 1948, Imanishi and his colleagues began studying macaques across Japan, and began to notice differences among the different groups of primates, both in social patterns and feeding behavior. In one area, paternal care was the social norm, while this behavior was absent elsewhere. One of the groups commonly dug up and ate the tubers and bulbs of several plants, while monkeys from other groups would not even put these in their mouths. Imanishi had reasoned that, \\"if one defines culture as learned by offspring from parents, then differences in the way of life of members of the same species belonging to different social groups could be attributed to culture.\\" Following this logic, the differences Imanishi and his colleagues observed among the different groups of macaques may suggest that they had arisen as a part of the groups' unique cultures. The most famous of these eating behaviors was observed on the island of Koshima, where one young female was observed carrying soiled sweet potatoes to a small stream, where she proceeded to wash off all of the sand and dirt before eating. This behavior was then observed in one of the monkey's playmates, then her mother and a few other playmates. The potato-washing eventually spread throughout the whole macaque colony, encouraging Imanishi to refer to the behavior as \\"pre- culture,\\" explaining that, \\"we must not overestimate the situation and say that 'monkeys have culture' and then confuse it with human culture.\\" At this point, most of the observed behaviors in animals, like those observed by Imanishi, were related to survival in some way. A chimpanzee mother and baby. The first evidence of apparently arbitrary traditions came in the late-1970s, also in the behavior of primates. At this time, researchers McGrew and Tutin found a social grooming handclasp behavior to be prevalent in a certain troop of chimpanzees in Tanzania, but not found in other groups nearby. This grooming behavior involved one chimpanzee taking hold of the hand of another and lifting it into the air, allowing the two to groom each other's armpits. Though this would seem to make grooming of the armpits easier, the behavior actually has no apparent advantage. As the primatologist Frans de Waal explains from his later observations of the hand-clasp grooming behavior in a different group of chimpanzees, \\"A unique property of the handclasp grooming posture is that it is not required for grooming the armpit of another individual... Thus it appears to yield no obvious benefits or rewards to the groomers.\\" Prior to these findings, opponents to the idea of animal culture had argued that the behaviors being called cultural were simply behaviors that had evolutionarily evolved due to their importance to survival. After the identification of this initial non-evolutionarily advantageous evidence of culture, scientists began to find differences in group behaviors or traditions in various groups of primates, specifically in Africa. More than 40 different populations of wild chimpanzees have been studied across Africa, between which many species-specific, as well as population-specific, behaviors have been observed. The researching scientists found 65 different categories of behaviors among these various groups of chimpanzees, including the use of leaves, sticks, branches, and stones for communication, play, food gathering or eating, and comfort. Each of the groups used the tools slightly differently, and this usage was passed from chimpanzee to chimpanzee within the group through a complex mix of imitation and social learning. = Chimpanzees = In 1999, Whiten et al. examined data from 151 years of chimpanzee observation in an attempt to discover how much cultural variation existed between populations of the species. The synthesis of their studies consisted of two phases, in which they (1) created a comprehensive list of cultural variant behavior specific to certain populations of chimpanzees and (2) rated the behavior as either customary ‚Äì occurring in all individuals within that population; habitual ‚Äì not present in all individuals, but repeated in several individuals; present ‚Äì neither customary or habitual but clearly identified; absent ‚Äì instance of behavior not recorded and has no ecological explanation; ecological ‚Äì absence of behavior can be attributed to ecological features or lack thereof in the environment, or of unknown origin. Their results were extensive: of the 65 categories of behavior studied, 39 (including grooming, tool usage and courtship behaviors) were found to be habitual in some communities but nonexistent in others. Whiten et al. further made sure that these local traditions were not due to differences in ecology, and defined cultural behaviors as behaviors that are \\"transmitted repeatedly through social or observational learning to become a population-level characteristic\\". Eight years later, after \\"conducting large-scale controlled social-diffusion experiments with captive groups\\", Whiten et al. stated further that \\"alternative foraging techniques seeded in different groups of chimpanzees spread differentially...across two further groups with substantial fidelity\\". This finding confirms not only that nonhuman species can maintain unique cultural traditions; it also shows that they can pass these traditions on from one population to another. The Whiten articles are a tribute to the unique inventiveness of wild chimpanzees, and help prove that humans' impressive capacity for culture and cultural transmission dates back to the now-extinct common ancestor we share with chimpanzees. Similar to humans, social structure plays an important role in cultural transmission in chimpanzees. Victoria Horner conducted an experiment where an older, higher ranking individual and a younger, lower ranking individual were both taught the same task with only slight aesthetic modification. She found that chimpanzees tended to imitate the behaviors of the older, higher ranking chimpanzee as opposed to the younger, lower ranking individual when given a choice. It is believed that the older higher ranking individual had gained a level of 'prestige' within the group. This research demonstrates that culturally transmitted behaviors are often learned from individuals that are respected by the group. The older, higher ranking individual's success in similar situations in the past led the other individuals to believe that their fitness would be greater by imitating the actions of the successful individual. This shows that not only are chimpanzees imitating behaviors of other individuals, they are choosing which individuals they should imitate in order to increase their own fitness. This type of behavior is very common in human culture as well. People will seek to imitate the behaviors of an individual that has earned respect through their actions. From this information, it is evident that the cultural transmission system of chimpanzees is more complex than previous research would indicate. Chimpanzees have been known to use tools for as long as they have been studied. Andrew Whiten found that chimpanzees not only use tools, but also conform to using the same method as the majority of individuals in the group. This conformity bias is prevalent in human culture as well and is commonly referred to as peer pressure. The results from the research of Victoria Horner and Andrew Whiten show that chimpanzee social structures and human social structures have more similarities than previously thought. Cetacean culture Second only to non- human primates, culture in species within the order Cetacea, which includes whales, dolphins, and porpoises, has been studied for numerous years. In these animals, much of the evidence for culture comes from vocalizations and feeding behaviors. Cetacean vocalizations have been studied for many years, specifically those of the bottlenose dolphin, humpback whale, killer whale, and sperm whale. Since the early 1970s, scientists have studied these four species in depth, finding potential cultural attributes within group dialects, foraging, and migratory traditions. Hal Whitehead, a leading cetologist, and his colleagues conducted a study in 1992 of sperm whale groups in the South Pacific, finding that groups tended to be clustered based on their vocal dialects. The differences in the whales' songs among and between the various groups could not be explained genetically or ecologically, and thus was attributed to social learning. In mammals such as these sperm whales or bottlenose dolphins, the decision on whether an animal has the capacity for culture comes from more than simple behavioral observations. As described by ecologist Brooke Sergeant, \\"on the basis of life-history characteristics, social patterns, and ecological environments, bottlenose dolphins have been considered likely candidates for socially learned and cultural behaviors,\\" due to being large-brained and capable of vocal and motor imitation.Sargeant, Brooke L., and Janet Mann. From Social Learning to Culture: Intrapopulation Variation in Bottlenose Dolphins. The Question of Animal Culture. Ed. Kevin N. Laland and Bennett G. Galef. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard UP, 2009. 152-73. In dolphins, scientists have focused mostly on foraging and vocal behaviors, though many worry about the fact that social functions for the behaviors have not yet been found. As with primates, many humans are reluctantly willing, yet ever so slightly willing, to accept the notion of cetacean culture, when well evidenced, due to their similarity to humans in having \\"long lifetimes, advanced cognitive abilities, and prolonged parental care.\\" = Matrilineal whales = In the cases of three species of matrilineal cetaceans, including pilot whales, sperm whales, and killer whales, mitochondrial DNA nucleotide diversities are about ten times lower than other species of whale. Whitehead found that this low mtDNA nucleotide diversity yet high diversity in matrilineal whale culture may be attributed to cultural transmission, since learned cultural traits have the ability to have the same effect as normal maternally inherited mtDNA. The feeding specializations of these toothed whales are proposed to have led to the divergence of the sympatric \\"resident\\" and \\"transient\\" forms of killer whales off Vancouver Island, in which resident killer whales feed on fish and squid, and transient whales feed on marine mammals. Vocalizations have also been proven to be culturally acquired in killer and sperm whale populations, as evidenced by the distinct vocalization patterns maintained by members of these different species even in cases where more than one species may occupy one home range. Further study is being done in the matrilineal whales to uncover the cultural transmission mechanisms associated with other advanced techniques, such as migration strategies, new foraging techniques, and babysitting. = Dolphins = By using a \\"process of elimination\\" approach, researchers Krutzen et al. reported evidence of culturally transmitted tool use in bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops sp.). It has been previously noted that tool use in foraging, called \\"sponging\\" exists in this species. \\"Sponging\\" describes a behavior where a dolphin will break off a marine sponge, wear it over its rostrum, and use it to probe for fish. Using various genetic techniques, Krutzen et al. showed that the behavior of \\"sponging\\" is vertically transmitted from the mother, with most spongers being female. Additionally, they found high levels of genetic relatedness from spongers suggesting recent ancestry and the existence of a phenomenon researchers call a \\"sponging eve\\". In order to make a case for cultural transmission as the mode of behavioral inheritance in this case, Krutzen et al. needed to rule out possible genetic and ecological explanations. Krutzen et al. refer to data that indicate both spongers and nonspongers use the same habitat for foraging. Using mitochondrial DNA data, Krutzen et al. found a significant non-random association between the types of mitochondrial DNA pattern and sponging. Because mitochondrial DNA is inherited maternally, this result suggests sponging is passed from the mother. In a later study one more possible explanation for the transmission of sponging was ruled out in favor of cultural transmission. Scientists from the same lab looked at the possibility that 1.) the tendency for \\"sponging\\" was due to a genetic difference in diving ability and 2.) that these genes were under selection. From a test of 29 spongers and 54 nonspongers, the results showed that the coding mitochondrial genes were not a significant predictor of sponging behavior. Additionally, there was no evidence of selection in the investigated genes. Rat culture Notable research has been done with black rats and Norwegian rats. Among studies of rat culture, the most widely discussed research is that performed by Joseph Terkel in 1991 on a species of black rats that he had originally observed in the wild in Palestine. Terkel conducted an in-depth study aimed to determine whether the observed behavior, the systematic stripping of pine cone scales from pine cones prior to eating, was a socially acquired behavior, as this action had not been observed elsewhere. The experimentation with and observation of these black rats was one of the first to integrate field observations with laboratory experiments to analyze the social learning involved.Terkel, Joseph. Cultural Transmission of Feeding Behavior in the Black Rat (Rattus rattus). Social Learning in Animals: The Roots of Culture. Ed. Cecelia M. Heyes and Bennett G. Galef. San Diego: Academic P, 1996. 17-48. From the combination of these two types of research, Terkel was able to analyze the mechanisms involved in this social learning to determine that this eating behavior resulted from a combination of ecology and cultural transmission, as the rats could not figure out how to eat the pinecones without being \\"shown\\" by mature rats.Galef, Bennett G. Culture in Animals? The Question of Animal Culture. Ed. Kevin N. Laland and Bennett G. Galef. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard UP, 2009. 222-246. Though this research is fairly recent, it is often used as a prime example of evidence for culture in non-primate, non-cetacean beings. Animal migration may be in part cultural; released ungulates have to learn over generations the seasonal changes in local vegetation. In the black rat (Rattus rattus), social transmission appears to be the mechanism of how optimal foraging techniques are transmitted. In this habitat, the rats‚Äô only source of food is pine seeds that they obtain from pine cones. Terkel et al. studied the way in which the rats obtained the seeds and the method that this strategy was transmitted to subsequent generations. Terkel et al. found that there was an optimal strategy for obtaining the seeds that minimized energy inputs and maximized outputs. Na√Øve rats that did not use this strategy could not learn it from trial and error or from watching experienced rats. Only young offspring could learn the technique. Additionally, from cross-fostering experiments where pups of na√Øve mothers were placed with experienced mothers and vice versa, those pups placed with experienced mothers learned the technique while those with na√Øve mothers did not. This result suggests that this optimal foraging technique is socially rather than genetically transmitted. Avian culture The songs of starlings have been discovered to show regional \\"dialects,\\" a trait that has potential to have a cultural basis. Common Starling Song Birds have been a strong study subject on the topic of culture due to their observed vocal \\"dialects\\" similar to those studied in the cetaceans. These dialects were first discovered by zoologist Peter Marler, who noted the geographic variation in the songs of various songbirds. Many scientists have found that, in attempting to study these animals, they approach a stumbling block in that it is difficult to understand these animals' societies due to their being so different from our own.West, Meredith J., and Andrew P. King. Social Learning: Synergy and Songbirds. Social Learning in Animals: The Roots of Culture. Ed. Cecelia M. Heyes and Bennett G. Galef. San Diego: Academic P, 1996. 155-78. This makes it difficult to understand the animals' behaviors, let alone determine whether they are cultural or simply practical. However, despite this hindrance, evidence for differing dialects among songbird populations has been discovered, especially in sparrows, starlings, and cowbirds. In these birds, scientists have found strong evidence for imitation-based learning, one of the main types of social learning. Though the songbirds obviously learn their songs through imitating other birds, many scientists remain skeptical about the correlation between this and culture: \\"...the ability to imitate sound may be as reflexive and cognitively uncomplicated as the ability to breathe. It is how imitation affects and is affected by context, by ongoing social behavior, that must be studied before assuming its explanatory power.\\" The scientists have found that simple imitation does not itself lay the ground for culture, whether in humans or birds, but rather it is how this imitation affects the social life of an individual that matters. = Examples of culturally transmitted behaviors in birds = The complexity of several avian behaviors can be explained by the accumulation of cultural traits over many generations.  Bird song  In an experiment regarding at vocal behavior in birds, researchers Marler & Tamura found evidence of song dialects in a sparrow species known as Zonotrichia leucophrys. Located in the eastern and southern parts of North America, these white-crowned song-birds exhibit learned vocal behavior. Marler & Tamura found that while song variation existed between individual birds, each population of birds had a distinct song pattern that varied in accordance to geographical location. For this reason, Marler and Tamura called the patterns of each region a \\"dialect\\": however, this term has since been disputed, as different types of in bird song are much less distinct than dialects in human language. By raising male sparrows in various acoustic settings and observing effects on their verbal behavior, Marler and Tamura found that sparrows learned songs during the first 100 days of their lives. In this experimental setting, male birds in acoustic chambers were exposed to recorded sounds played through a loudspeaker. They also showed that white- crowned sparrows only learn songs recorded from other members of their species. Marler and Tamura noted that this case of cultural transmission was interesting because it required no social bond between the learner and the emitter of sound (since all sounds originated from a loudspeaker in their experiments). However, the presence of social bonds strongly facilitates song imitation in certain songbirds. Zebra finches rarely imitate songs played from a loudspeaker, but they regularly imitate songs of an adult bird after only a few hours of interaction. Interestingly, imitation in zebra finches is inhibited when the number of siblings (pupils) increases.  Innovative foraging  In 20th century Britain, bottled milk was delivered to households in the early morning by milkmen and left on doorsteps to be collected. Birds such as tits (Paridae) began to attack the bottles, opening the foil or cardboard lids and drinking the cream of the top. It was later shown that this innovative behavior arose independently in several different sites and spread horizontally (i.e. between living members) in the existing population. Later experimental evidence showed that conformity may lead to the horizontal spread of innovative behaviors in wild birds, and that this may in turn result in a lasting cultural tradition. A spread of new foraging behaviors also occurred in an Argentinian population of kelp gulls (Larus dominicanus). During the 20th century, individuals in this population began to non-fatally wound the backs of swimming whales with their beaks, feeding on the blubber and creating deeper lesions in areas that were already wounded. Aerial photographs showed that gull-induced lesions on local whales increased in frequency from 2% to 99% from 1974 to 2011, and that this behavior was not observed in any other kelp gull populations other than two isolated incidents. This implies the emergence and persistence of a local tradition in this population of gulls.  Migration  Juvenile birds that migrate in flocks may learn to navigate accurately through cultural transmission of route choice skills from older birds. Cultural inheritance of migration patterns has been shown in bustards (Otis tarda), and the pattern of inheritance was shown to depend on social structures in the flock. = Avian social networks = Social networks are a specific mechanism of cultural transmission in birds. Information learned in social contexts can allow them to make decisions that lead to increased fitness. A great deal of research has focused on the communication of new foraging locations or behaviors through social networks. These networks are currently being analyzed through computational methods such as network-based diffusion analysis (NBDA). In wild songbirds, social networks are a mechanism for information transmission both within and between species. Interspecific networks (i.e. networks including birds of different species) were shown to exist in multispecies flocks containing three different types of tits whose niches overlapped. In this study, knowledge about new feeding areas spread through social interactions: more birds visited the new area than the number of birds that discovered the area independently. The researchers noted that information likely travelled faster among members of the same species (conspecifics), but that individuals did not depend solely on conspecifics for transmission. Another study on army-ant-following birds has also evidenced interspecific transmission of foraging information. A recent study used RFID identification transponders to experimentally manipulate avian social networks: this scanner technology allowed them to restrict access to feeders for some birds and not others. Their data showed that individuals are more likely to learn from those who were able to enter the same feeding area as them. Additionally, the existing \\"paths\\" of information transmission were altered following segregation during feeding: this was attributed to changes in the population's social network. Others have been able to predict the pattern information transmission among individuals based on a preexisting social network. In this study, social interactions of ravens (Corvus corax) were first analyzed to create a comprehensive network. Then, the order in which individuals learned task-solving behavior from a trained tutor was compared with the network. They not only found that the pattern of learning reflected the network that they had built, but that different types of social connections (such as \\"affiliative interactions\\" and \\"aggressive interactions\\") characterized different rates of information transmission and observation. = Conformity in avian culture = Bartlett and Slater observed call convergence (i.e. conformity) in budgerigars introduced into groups with different flock- specific calls than their own. They also found that the original calls of flock members did not change significantly during this process. Conformity is one mechanism through which innovative behaviors can become embedded in culture. In an experimental setting, tits preferentially adopted the locally popular method of opening a two-action puzzle box even after discovering the other possible way of accessing the food. This formed diverging local traditions when different populations were seeded with birds specifically trained in one method. Other research showed that although conformity has a strong influence on behaviors adopted by birds, the local tradition can be abandoned in favor of an analogous behavior which gives higher reward. This showed that while conformity is a beneficial mechanism for quickly establishing traditions, but that unhelpful traditions will not necessarily be adhered to in the presence of a better alternative. In some cases, conformity- based aggression may benefit individuals who conform to traditions. Researchers used the framework of sexual selection and conformism in of song types of songbirds to model territorial aggression against individuals with non-conforming song types. Their model showed that aggressors won more frequently when targeting non-conformers (than in un-targeted or random aggression). They also found that alleles for conformity-enforcement propagated more effectively than alleles for tolerance of non-conformity. Finally, other species of birds have been observed to conform to the personality of other individuals in their presence. Gouldian finches (Erythrura gouldiae) exist in red- and black-headed subtypes, and these subtypes have been shown to have different levels of boldness (measured by the time taken to explore new areas, and other similar tests). Experiments placing black-headed birds (known to be less bold) in the company of red-headed birds (known to be more bold) resulted in the black-headed bird performing \\"bolder\\" behaviors, and red-headed birds became \\"shyer\\" in the presence of black-headed ones. The experimenters hypothesized that this individual-level conformity could lead to stronger social cohesion.  Fish culture  Guppy mating behavior is believed to be culturally influenced. Evidence for cultural transmission has also been shown in wild fish populations. Scientists Helfman and Schultz conducted translocation experiments with French grunts (Haemulon flavolineatum) where they took fish native to a specific schooling site and transported them to other sites. In this species of fish, the organism uses distinct, traditional migration routes to travel to schooling sites on coral reefs. These routes persisted past one generation and so by relocating the fish to different sites, Helfman and Schultz wanted to see if the new fish could relearn that sites' migration route from the resident fish. Indeed this is what they found: that the newcomers quickly learned the traditional routes and schooling sites. But when residents were removed under similar situations, the new fish did not use the traditional route and instead use new routes, suggesting that the behavior could not be transmitted once the opportunity for learning was no longer there. In a similar experiment looking at mating sites in blueheaded wrasse (Thalassoma bifasciatum), researcher Warner found that individuals chose mating sites based on social traditions and not based on the resource quality of the site. Warner found that although mating sites were maintained for four generations, when entire local populations were translocated elsewhere, new sites were used and maintained.  Controversies and criticisms  A popular method of approaching the study of animal culture (and its transmission) is the \\"ethnographic method,\\" which argues that culture causes the geographical differences in the behavioral repertoires of large- brained mammals. However, this significantly downplays the roles that ecology and genetics play in influencing behavioral variation from population to population within a species. Behaviors stemming from genetic or environmental effects are not reliant on socially learned and transmitted information; therefore, they are not cultural. Culture is just one source of adaptive behavior an organism exhibits to better exploit its environment. When behavioral variation reflects differential phenotypic plasticity, it is due more to ecological pressures than cultural ones. In other words, when an animal changes its behavior over its lifespan, this is most often a result of changes in its environment. Furthermore, animal behavior is also influenced by evolved predispositions, or genetics. It is very possible that \\"correlation between distance between sites and 'cultural difference' might reflect the well-established correlation between genetic and geographical distances\\". The farther two populations of a species are separated from each other, the less genetic traits they will share in common, and this may be one source of variance in culture. Another argument against the \\"ethnographic method\\" is that it is impossible to prove that there are absolutely no ecological or genetic factors in any behavior. However, this criticism can also be applied to studies of human culture. Though culture has long been thought to arise and remain independent of genetics, the constraints on the propagation and innovation of cultural techniques inevitably caused by the genome of each respective animal species has led to the theory of gene-culture coevolution, which asserts that \\"cognitive, affective, and moral capacities\\" are the product of an evolutionary dynamic involving interactions between genes and culture over extended periods of time.Herbert Gintis. Phil. Trans. R. Soc. B 2011 366, 878‚Äì888 The concept behind gene-culture coevolution is that, though culture plays a huge role in the progression of animal behavior over time, the genes of a particular species have the ability to affect the details of the corresponding culture and its ability to evolve within that species. We do not know every possible genetic or environmental effect on behavior that exists, nor will we ever. In other words, it is impossible to reject the notion that genes and ecology influence all behaviors, to a degree. Culture can also contribute to differences in behavior, but like genes and environments, it carries different weight in different behaviors. As Laland and Janik explain, \\"to identify cultural variation, not only is it not sufficient to rule out the possibility that the variation in behavior constitutes unlearned responses to different selection pressures [from the environment], but it is also necessary to consider the possibility of genetic variation precipitating different patterns of learning.\\" Gene-culture coevolution, much like the interaction between cultural transmission and environment, both serve as modifiers to the original theories on cultural transmission and evolution that focused more on differences in the interactions between individuals. Some scientists believe the study of animal culture should be approached in a different way. Currently, the question being asked is, \\"is this behavior learned socially (and hence is a result of culture alone), or is it a product of genes and/or environment?\\" However, it is impossible to find an absolute answer to this question, nor does one in all likelihood exist. Therefore it seems as though scientists should focus on examining how much variance in a behavior can be attributed to culture. Performing field experiments is an excellent way to try to answer this question: translocating individuals between populations or populations between sites could help biologists distinguish between culture, ecology and genetics. For example, if a newly introduced animal shifts its behavior to mimic that of others in its new population, genetic difference as an effect on behavior can be ruled out.  Unanswered questions and future areas of exploration  In the study of social transmissions, one of the important unanswered questions is an explanation of how and why maladaptive social traditions are maintained. For example, in one study on social transmission in guppies (Poecilia reticulata), na√Øve fish preferred taking a long, energetically costly route to a feeder that they had learned from resident fish rather than take a shorter route. These fish were also slower to learn the new, quicker route compared to na√Øve fish that had not been trained in the long route. In this case, not only is the social tradition maladaptive, but it also inhibits the acquisition of adaptive behavior. See also  References   Further reading  * * Hoppitt, W. and Laland, K.N. (2013).

It is the first book in The Famous Five series. The first edition of the book was illustrated by Eileen Soper. Background It has been suggested that the book was influenced by L. T. Meade's 1892 book Four on an Island, which also recounts a story of four related children including a tomboy along with a dog living on an island with a shipwreck. in a private island. Plot When siblings Julian, Dick and Anne cannot go for their usual summer holiday to Polseath, they are invited to spend the summer with their Aunt Fanny and Uncle Quentin at their home Kirrin Cottage, in the coastal village of Kirrin. They also meet their cousin Georgina, a surly, difficult girl, who tries hard to live like a boy and only answers to the name George. Despite an uncomfortable start, the cousins become firm friends and George introduces them to her beloved dog Timothy (Timmy), who secretly lives with the fisher boy, Alf, in the village as George's parents will not allow her to keep Timmy. On their way to Kirrin Island, George shows her cousins a shipwreck, explaining it was her great-great-great grandfather's ship. He had been transporting gold when the ship was wrecked in a storm, but despite divers investigating the wreck, the gold was never found. After visiting the wreck, the five arrive on the Island and are exploring the ruined castle when a huge storm blows up, making it too dangerous for them to return to the mainland. While they take shelter on the island, the sea throws up the old shipwreck, grounding it on the rocks surrounding the island. Excited by these developments, they decide to come back at dawn the next day to investigate the wreck before it is discovered. The following day, the five visit the wreck and discover the captain's cabin, where they find some objects belonging to George's great-great-great-grandfather, including an old box which they take back to Kirrin Cottage. The box proves difficult to open, so they throw it from the highest window of the house. The box breaks open, but the noise disturbs Uncle Quentin who confiscates the box. Not willing to give up their quest, Julian sneaks into Uncle Quentin's study and takes the box, which contains an old map of Kirrin Castle. Later in the further investigation on the map, the children find a word INGOTS, which they later understand that it represented the place in which the lost gold was buried. The children realise it is a treasure map showing the location of the lost gold. After making a tracing of the map and returning the box, they decide to find the gold themselves. To the children's shock, the box containing the map is sold to an antique collector. The same man also makes an offer to buy Kirrin Island. The children realise he has unearthed the secret map and wants the gold for himself, and so begins a race for the five to get to the gold first. Thinking the children want to spend time at the island before it is sold, Uncle Quentin and Aunt Fanny allow them to go camping there for one week. Arriving on the island, the five start searching the castle ruins to locate the old dungeons where the gold is hidden. Chasing a rabbit, Timmy falls down an old well, from where the children find the dungeon entrance. Exploring underground, they find the gold in a locked vault. Trouble soon arrives, as bad men come to the island hoping to steal the gold. They capture George and Julian, locking them in the dungeons and ask them to write a note to Anne and Dick who was up in the air to come back to the dungeons. George wrote the letter and Dick find something fishy about it as George signed her name as Georgina and decide not to go down. Unable to find Anne and Dick, they leave the island, taking the oars from the children's boat so they cannot escape. Anne and Dick use the good shaft to rescue Julian and George from the dungeon, and the children hatch a plan to trap the men when they come back to the island with a boat to steal the gold. Although the plan goes wrong, they manage to leave the men stranded on Kirrin Island. They return to the mainland to tell Uncle Quentin, Aunt Fanny and the police what has happened. The gold is recovered and it is decided that it legally belongs to George's family, making them rich and enabling them to afford everything they have ever wanted. George's only wish is to be allowed to keep Timmy, and her parents agree. George also agrees to go to boarding school with Anne, because she and her cousins have become very good friends and also the school allowed pets. Film adaptations An 8-part Children's Film Foundation film serial was produced in 1957, directed by Gerald Landau. In early 2010, rumours appeared that there might be a Five on a Treasure Island film to be released in 2012. On 31 May those rumours were confirmed by film maker Sam Mendes on an interview about the upcoming Skyfall. Mendes stated, \\"A script is under way and is hoped to be in cinemas Spring 2012.\\" Progress on the film was stopped when MGM went bankrupt later in the year.

When Dukat reveals to Kira Nerys that her mother did not die decades ago but was actually his lover, Kira goes into the past using the Bajoran Orb of Time to find the truth. This episode expands the story about the Cardassian occupation of Bajor, which in the Deep Space Nine story, ended just a few years before the main events of the television show but had lasted for decades. Cardassia had been fighting an interstellar war with the United Federation of Planets, but a somewhat fragile peace had been achieved relatively recently. This episode had Nielsen ratings of 4.6 when it was broadcast in 1998, which equates to about 4.5 million viewers. Casting This show introduces actress Leslie Hope as Kira Meru. Other guest stars include Marc Alaimo as Gul Dukat, David Bowe as Basso Tromac, Wayne Grace as Legate Parek, Tim deZarn as Halb Daier, and Thomas Kopache as Kira Taban Plot On her late mother Meru's 60th birthday, Major Kira receives a transmission from Gul Dukat in which he tells her that Meru, who supposedly died when Kira was three, was actually his lover for many years and had left her family to be with him. When Major Kira's investigation fails to prove Dukat false, she asks station commander Captain Sisko, as the Emissary, to permit her to consult the Bajoran Orb of Time. He agrees, and she finds herself in the past, at a refugee center where she comes face to face with her long-lost family, who do not realize her true identity. Major Kira (Nerys) and Meru are taken from the camp to become \\"comfort women\\" for Cardassian troops. The sight of her mother being torn from her children is painful for Nerys, and she vows to help her return to her family. The women are taken to the then new Terok Nor space station, where, despite her sadness, Meru is overwhelmed by the bounty of food and other comforts. Later, she is singled out for special attention by Gul Dukat, the new Prefect of the station. Meru confesses to Nerys that she has what she always dreamed of ‚Äî good health, beautiful clothes, enough to eat ‚Äî but at the cost of her family. Later, Nerys learns that her mother has become Dukat's mistress. When Nerys confronts a guard and demands to see Meru, she is thrown out into the station's Bajoran ghetto. Nerys befriends a member of the Bajoran resistance named Halb, who asks her to help attack the Cardassians, but she is suddenly summoned to meet with Meru. When her mother begins singing Dukat's praises, it is too much for Nerys to bear. She angrily reminds Meru that Dukat is not only responsible for killing innocent Bajorans, but also for separating her from her family. Meru explains that Dukat has promised to provide her husband and children with food and medical supplies. Nerys accuses Meru of becoming a collaborator and storms out, hatching a plan with Halb to smuggle a bomb into Dukat's quarters. Her mother could be killed in the blast, but Nerys no longer cares. Pretending to have had a change of heart, Nerys returns to Dukat's quarters to apologize to Meru, then secretly hides the bomb. She is preparing to leave when Dukat gives Meru a recorded message from Taban, Nerys's father. He thanks his wife for what she has done, telling her that she has saved their lives. Kira realizes that if her father could forgive her mother, she can forgive her also. She warns Dukat and Meru about the bomb, and they escape just before it detonates. Major Kira returns to her current time with the painful knowledge that Dukat's story is true and that the line between being a good person and a collaborator is not so clear cut.  Episode Title  The title of the show was developed by Hans Beimler, and it was meant to contrast with prior titles. The phrase is in a passage in Prometheus Unbound by Percy Bysshe Shelley a drama published in 1820. To suffer woes which Hope thinks infinite; To forgive wrongs darker than death or night; To defy Power, which seems omnipotent; To love, and bear; to hope till Hope creates Connections The Orb of time was introduced previously in Trials and Tribble-ations (airdate November 4, 1996 / S5E6) The Orb of Time is a time travel device, which is highly restricted in the Federation, but Bajor is not a part of the Federation so it is not against regulations for Major Kira but she does get permission from her commanding officer. The Orb is somehow connected to the Aliens that made the wormhole and part of a religion on Bajor, which connects to the overall plot of Deep Space Nine and the Ben Sisko character. From the Pilot and throughout the show, Ben must balance his Starfleet obligations, relationship with the Aliens, and spiritual role in Bajoran society The franchise has presented Time-travel and its consequences in different ways, and shows can be as much an exploration of the implications of time travel as device to present another period or morale. Some analysis of Star Trek time travel implications have categorized Trek stories as relying on the idea of a consistent universe, an ever-changing timeline, or new universe. In some cases shows appear to create a new \\"branch\\" of time while in other cases they \\"overwrite\\" the events. From a real-world science perspective, time travel is not considered to be possible based on studying current understandings of the universe. Some real-world time concepts include the idea that information cannot travel faster than the speed of light, but on the other hand there is something called entangled particles and even Albert Einstein and Erwin Schr√∂dinger did not come to a definitive conclusion. In the 2010s, there was some indications that events in the present that entangles photons, may affect them in the past and the future. In the case of \\"Wrongs Darker Than Death or Night\\", it seems to be similar to an observer style where visitors from the future do not significantly affect the timeline. Deep Space Nine also portrays the station during the occupation in the previous season Things Past (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine), which had some similar themes including Dukat's taking of Bajoran woman, which also provides a back-story to his daughter Ziyal. In that episode it is Jadzia who is chosen, however, its more like re-living a memory than time travel and the Orb of Time may be misunderstood as time travel device when it more or less allows a user to have an interactive dream with past events. On the other hand, the Aliens that control the Orbs are willing to make limited changes if persuaded to do so as seen in Accession (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine), and they are willing to significantly alter the course of events as seen in Sacrifice of Angels (S6E6 / November 3, 1997) This time period was explored earlier in the show's run in Necessary Evil (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine) (S2E8 / November 14, 1993) Reception Wrongs.. was rated 6th in a review of the darkest themed Deep Space Nine episodes.CBR The 15 Darkest Episodes of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine 02.11.2017 by Alexandra August In 2018, SyFy recommend this episode for its abbreviated watch guide for the Bajoran character Kira Nerys.

The U.S. Library of Congress calls it a dictionary.Its dictionary subject subheadings are Children's stories, English and Fantasy fiction, English. (LC catalogue entry) However, it may be called a fictional or parodic tourist guidebook. It was first published by Vista Books (London) in 1996. A revised and updated edition was completed in 2006 and published by Penguin (Firebird Books), first in the U.S. Jones has written many fantasy novels, mainly for children or young adults, including some that simply rely upon and some that subvert common fantasy motifs. (The) Dark Lord of Derkholm (1998) is one that subverts, and a conceptual sequel. It is set in a fantasy world that maintains the cliches detailed in the Tough Guide for the benefit of commercial tourism from our world. Origin The inside back cover of the revised edition is a 2006 postscript by Jones, \\"How I Came to Write This Guidebook\\". While hospitalized in 1994, she and Chris Bell worked on projected entries for The Encyclopedia of Fantasy (Clute & Grant, Orbit Books, 1997). \\"Our job was to decide whether each entry was necessary, to suggest new ones, to discuss whether some of the entries made sense (many didn't), and to provide examples in support of what each entry said.\\"Revised ed., inside back cover. Description Unusually, the book presents itself as a tourist guidebook; its title alludes to the Rough Guides series of such guidebooks. Its conceit is that the fantasy worlds depicted in many fantasy novels, games, and films are identical, although tours visit different places such as provinces of Finland. In an extended metaphor, the readers (or viewers or players) are tourists; authors are tour guides, and their stories are sight- seeing tours or package holidays to this Fantasyland.Front endpapers of the revised edition begin with \\"A Guide to The Tough Guide\\", which opens \\"Imagine that every single fantasy novel featuring kings, dragons, quests, and magic takes place in the same country. That country is called Fantasyland. [paragraph break] Part 'travel guide' for the hapless 'fantasy tourist' (or 'reader'), part send-up of fantasy literature's cliches ... \\" Also preceding the title page is a phoney list of ten \\"Other Tough Guides\\" such as The Tough Guide to Transport in the Multiverse (mostly by Telephone Box).Front endpapers, revised ed. The Guide proper begins with a generic \\"Map of Fantasyland\\", \\"How to Use This Book\\", and a key to the marginal symbols (\\"Identification Symbols\\"), all preceding the alphabetical catalogue: A, Adept to Z, Zombies (pages 1‚Äì234).Revised ed. Along these lines the Guide catalogues many of the common places, peoples, artifacts, situations, characters and events likely to be found on such a journey ‚Äì in other words, the archetypes and clich√©s found in fantasy fiction. The Tough Guide comprises several hundred articles organised alphabetically, ranging from a couple of sentences to a couple of pages. Short entries may convey the nature of the work in some respects (only). : INDUSTRY. Apart from a bit of pottery and light metalwork or some slagheaps around the domain of the DARK LORD, most Tours encounter no industry at all. Even the EMBROIDERY factories are kept well out of sight. :: See also ECONOMY. : SPORT. The only real sport is FIGHTS. Those who can, train fiercely and take on everyone. Those who can't watch GLADIATORS and lay BETS. :: See also GAMES and GAMING. There are entries for Dark Lords and what they do, magic swords and where they come from, haunted forests and what they contain, and so on. It can all be read as a thinly-veiled criticism of the fantasy genre for being overly derivative, clich√©d, and unimaginative. Alternatively it can be seen as an affectionate study of the themes and ideas that resonate through fantasy writing. The tone is generally tongue-in-cheek, with such explanations as why there are Dark Lords but no Dark Ladies, why casual sex in Fantasyland almost never results in pregnancy, and why male virginity is useless whereas female virginity is highly prized. Publication history The first edition Tough Guide (Vista, 1996, ) was a 223-page paperback. It was reissued in paperback by Gollancz in 1997 and first published in the US by DAW Books in 1998, both in paperback.Notes by one contributor of data to ISFDB include basic questions about the first US edition. Among others, does \\"98 Miles Short\\" really assert copyright of the map artist or is it a joke? First U.S. edition at ISFDB.

A second version with a shorter barrel, designated L95A1, was also procured in small numbers. The weapon was produced by Heckler & Koch in the UK. Design The EX-34 was specifically designed for use as a coaxial weapon in armoured vehicles, and has a number of features that make it suitable for this role. The gun is externally powered, meaning that misfires do not need to be manually cleared, instead the rounds are simply ejected. All spent cases are ejected forwards out of the turret. This prevents any build-up of spent shell cases causing stoppages. Additionally, all gas generated by firing is vented through the barrel and ejection tube, preventing the build-up of toxic gases inside the armoured vehicle. The weapon is cooled by a venturi system, which draws cool air down the jacket and acts as a fume extractor. The weapon was originally intended as a replacement for the coaxial weapon in the American M60 tank. The weapon was evaluated by both the US Army and the US Naval weapon center, who reported that the performance of the weapon was outstanding during all phases of testing.

It was the first WWF game released solely on home computers since 1992's WWF European Rampage Tour. The game was released under its original title WWF With Authority! in 2001 on July 23. Later, in the summer of 2002, as a result of a lawsuit between the World Wildlife Fund and the World Wrestling Federation (which changed its name to World Wrestling Entertainment, or WWE, as a result) and, the game's official title became WWE With Authority!. Gameplay At its core, WWE With Authority! was a digital collectible card game in electronic form. Players could purchase virtual \\"Pages\\" and assemble them into a \\"Playbook.\\" This playbook would represent the moves and abilities that your wrestler would be capable of pulling off in the ring. WWE With Authority! was distributed as a downloadable freeware game and was available on CD in retail stores for US$5.00. The retail version came with a redemption code for a William Regal starter playbook. Players could purchase additional pre- constructed playbooks for superstars consisting of complete selections of plays for US$10.00. Booster packs were also available for US$3.00 that include an assortment of random individual pages to accentuate your existing playbooks. A certain amount of rarer cards were guaranteed in each booster. There is a single player mode, which is intended as a tutorial. The first edition tutorials were against the Mean Street Posse and narrated by Kevin Kelly, while the second edition tutorials were against Scotty 2 Hotty and narrated by Triple H. After the second edition, 3 computer opponents became available, with each opponent being a harder difficulty (X-Pac, then Triple H, and then The Big Show). The game was primarily geared towards the online multiplayer game, where as many as 1,000 people were available at any given time during the game's height. The game kept track of the player's wins, losses and draws, as well as the number of times a player has been cut off in the middle of a match. This feature was to discourage players from terminating the program to avoid taking a loss. Expansion sets There were seven sets put up for sale at various times during the tenure of the game. =Season One= *First Edition, 196 cards (February 21, 2001) This was the first set of the game. Established the framework and environment. *No Way Out, 145 cards (December 12, 2001) This expansion rounded the game out to a complete play environment. *WrestleMania X8, 25 cards (late March, 2002) This \\"mini- expansion\\" was on sale only for a month or two. It was developed during the show itself, with designers at the event taking notes then scrambling back to implement, code and test the set. The main theme was the inclusion of the NWO. =Season Two= *TLC, 160 cards (May 16, 2002) The \\"Tables, Ladders and Chairs\\" expansion greatly increased the number of hardcore and illegal moves and special cards available to players. Concurrent with this set was the release of the new \\"Ladder Match\\". *Second Edition, 250 cards (June 2002) This set included 238 reprints from Season One and 12 Superstars. These Superstars were new versions of existing superstars, including new gameplay text. This update scheme received a mixed reaction. *SummerSlam 2002, 25 cards (August 2002) Based on the results from the X8 mini-expansion, Genetic Anomalies released SummerSlam 2002. This set featured Shawn Michaels (returning from a four-year break from WWE) and Brock Lesnar (who captured his first WWE Championship). *Unforgiven, 200 cards (September 27, 2002) This set marked the return to themes that were based more on card mechanics and less on storyline development. *\\"Expansion Eight\\", around 150 cards (unreleased) Preview cards of this expansion set were released in October and November 2002. Rey Mysterio and Tajiri and their trademark moves were put on sale in Limited Edition form. This set was originally scheduled for a mid-December 2002 release. Superstars The following is a list of superstars that were in the game, and thus the playbooks were built around: *Al Snow *Booker T *Bradshaw *Brock Lesnar *Bubba Ray Dudley *Chris Benoit (2 editions) *Chris Jericho (3 editions) *Christian *D-Von Dudley *Eddie Guerrero (2 editions) *Edge (2 editions) *Goldust *Hollywood Hulk Hogan and Hulk Hogan *Jeff Hardy *Kane (2 editions) *Kevin Nash *Kurt Angle (2 editions) *Lance Storm *Lita (2 editions) *Matt Hardy *Rey Mysterio *Ric Flair *Rikishi Phatu *Rob Van Dam *Scott Hall *Scotty 2 Hotty *Shane McMahon *Shawn Michaels *Spike Dudley *Steve Blackman *Stone Cold *Tajiri *Tazz *Test *The Big Show (2 editions) *The Hurricane *The Rock (2 editions) *The Undertaker (2 editions) *Triple H (3 editions) *Trish Stratus *William Regal *X-Pac Reception WWE With Authority! was one of the first online collectible card games, along with Chron X, also from Genetic Anomalies. While subsequent online collectible card games have enjoyed success, including Magic: The Gathering Online, Genetic Anomalies would not survive to see the genre flourish. The game itself was met with mixed reception, as Metacritic gave it 53 out of 100. There was also a WWF collectible card game released at about the same time entitled Raw Deal, which was considered to be a better alternative to the online version. Shutdown and move to peer-to-peer In January 2003, THQ ceased production of the game. The server remained online for several months. The freeware client can still be downloaded from some freeware distribution sites, but the game is no longer officially supported. In 2003, just weeks before support ceased, a peer-to- peer version of the game was released by THQ such that existing players could continue using the game with the pages they purchased. This way, players would connect though IP addresses. Eventually, the new community was named With Authority! Peer-2-Peer. This version of the game used mIRC for a chat room/server, and the original With Authority! client as before. In addition, instead of relying on old purchased pages, guide sets were released, which consisted of every page released for the game, thus giving the option to build practically any deck. The community shut down years later. In June 2020, the spiritual successor to With Authority! was relaunched. SynamicD, with a third party download sourced on the game's Discord, allows players to play matches with other players and daily title events. The group regularly involve users in the creation of new cards.

It was written by Catherine Cyran. Plot The film opens with Jake Raye as he fights Mickey Sheehan in a pro-kickboxing bout. The movie opens as they enter the fifth Round of the Lightweight Championship Match. Jake delivers Mickey a lightning fast kick to the throat in the middle of the sixth round, instantly killing him. Seeing what he had done, he decides to give up kickboxing once and for all. A year later, a friend and manager Vinny Petrello (Kickboxing and UFC champion Maurice Smith) asks him for a favor to travel to Manila and bail him out of trouble with a guy named Su. Although Jake's evening with a prostitute (Liza David) is interrupted, he agrees to help his friend in need. Jake Raye travels to Manila, and meets up with local fighters John Jones (James Warring), Sal Taylor (Timothy D. Baker), Manny Rivera (Manny Samson), and Tobo Casenerra (Monsour Del Rosario). He also meets up with Dieter (Robert Marius), the head of the Dojo. Thugs attack Jake, and is helped by a woman named Mariella (Rina Reyes) into an abandoned safehouse. Mariella betrays him, and the thugs enter the safehouse. Dieter drugs Raye, and puts him on the ship with the other fighters. Raye is re-acquained with his friend Bobby Rose (Rick Hill) and meets another fighter named Ernesto (Steve Rodgers). It is revealed that Su (Joe Mari Avellana) is the one who bring the fighters to his island home called Paradise, and it is also revealed that Vinny is helping Su get the fighters there to battle in gladiator matches. The fighters briefly rebel giving Jake Raye time to escape. Soon Raye has a change of heart and decides to free the other fighters. He makes it back to the house undetected by Su, and is helped once more by Mariella. Mariella and Raye uncover a plot for Su to give anabolic steroids to each of his fighters before the match. Jake Raye takes out some guards before he is discovered by Dieter and knocked unconscious by Vinny, pretending to be in trouble. Jake is taken to the challenger‚Äôs box of the arena, where Su, Vinny, and his guests are awaiting the matching. Both John and Ernest die in the arena while battling their opponents while Manny is killed trying to escape. (Ernest does win his fight, but Su orders Vinny to kill him either due to his unorthodox fighting i.e. low blows and eye gouging however the fights were not fair to begin with and they were fighting for survival or his embarrassment of su's fighter) the help of Mariella, the remaining surviving fighters (Bobby, Sal, Tobo, and Jake) Jake fights and kills Vinny while the others defeat the guards and the elite fighters. Bobby shoots Dieter while escaping, and the film ends after Jake defeats Su with a swift kick off the balcony. The five people begin to walk off Paradise forever.

The ruins are located at 950 Old Sugar Mill Road, Port Orange, Florida. On August 28, 1973, the site was added to the United States National Register of Historic Places under the title of Dunlawton Plantation-Sugar Mill Ruins. The ruins are now part of the Dunlawton Sugar Mill Gardens. The botanical gardens include interpretive signs about the enclosed ruins, large concrete sculptures of dinosaurs and a giant ground sloth, a gazebo, and plantings of grasses, flowers, bushes and native plants under a canopy of oak trees. History =Plantation early years= The Dunlawton Plantation and its sugar mill date to the latter years of the Second Spanish period in Florida. In August 1804, Patrick Dean, a merchant from the Bahamas, and his uncle John Bunch, a planter from Nassau, were granted by the Spanish Crown land in Florida that had been part of the British Turnbull grant of 1777. Dean established a 995-acre indigo and sugarcane plantation in what is now the Port Orange area, using the labor of enslaved Africans to cultivate and process the crops. Dean apparently was killed by a renegade Indian or slave during the First Seminole War in 1818, and left the plantation to his aunt Cecily, the wife of his uncle John Bunch, who had set up his own plantation on the grant to the north of Dean's property. Cecily died soon after Dean, and the plantation passed to John Bunch, who operated the two properties until 1830 as a single plantation. John B. Bunch McHardy, an officer in the British Navy and grandson of John and Cecily Bunch, eventually inherited the former Dean property. He had no interest in running a plantation, and sold the land to land dealers Charles and Joseph Lawton for $3,000 dollars. In 1832, the brokers sold it to Sarah Anderson and her two sons, George and James, for $4,500. The name Dunlawton was formed by combining her maiden name, Dunn, with the land dealers' name, Lawton. The brothers operated the mill with slave labor‚Äîprocessing sugar, molasses and rum on the property until December 1835, when the Second Seminole Indian War began. =Second Seminole War= By late November, 1835, white settlers in the Territory of Florida were becoming alarmed by the activities of the Seminole Indians, some of whose leaders vehemently protested the official Indian removal policy of the United States, and Osceola's killing of Charley Emathla threatened to provoke an armed confrontation. On December 17, 1835, Gen. Joseph Hern√°ndez ordered troops to protect the plantations in the vicinity of the Matanzas, Tomoka, and Mosquito Rivers. Major Benjamin A. Putnam, a St. Augustine lawyer, led a detachment of the local militia, Company A of the St. Augustine Guards, to Dunlawton, where \\"the Anderson brothers were endeavoring to place the estate in a condition for defense by erecting a stockade. These efforts were terminated by the impressment of the brothers into service with the detachment.\\" Port Orange Sugar Mill Ruins machinery On the night of December 24, 1835, the Seminoles began their depredations against the plantations south of St. Augustine,) and during the next several weeks, the marauding Indians burned or ransacked sixteen plantations, including Dunlawton. Many of the refugees who fled from the destroyed plantations gathered at Charles Wilhelm Bulow's estate. Upon his return from the south, Gen. Hern√°ndez ordered Capt. Keogh to occupy Bulowville. Maj. Putnam and his company of poorly trained militia, as well as the \\"Mosquito Roarers\\", a company from Mosquito Inlet under Capt. Douglas Dummett, were dispatched to Dunlawton plantation to recover abandoned stores. On January 17, 1836, Putnam led the troops down Bulow Creek to the Halifax River and southward to Dunlawton. As they approached, they saw that a large war party of Seminoles still occupied the place. According to M. M. Cohen's journal of the campaign against the Seminoles in 1836, Notices of Florida and the Campaigns, the Andersons' dwelling house and several slave houses were burning when the command arrived. Heavy fire was exchanged in the skirmish, but the militiamen were unable to drive away the Indians. Dunlawton plantation was only partly destroyed by the Seminoles, who burned some of its buildings when they attacked the string of plantations stretching between St. Augustine and New Smyrna. By early February, the Seminoles had succeeded in forcing the white settlers to abandon most of the territory south of St. Augustine. =Rebuilding of the sugar mill= In 1846, Sarah Anderson sold Dunlawton to John J. Marshall, a master builder from Charleston, South Carolina, for $8,000. Marshall rebuilt the mill and expanded it in an effort to make the sugar plantation productive again. He installed processing machinery bought from the destroyed Cruger and DePeyster mill in New Smyrna, and with the labor of 25 slaves produced nearly 200 tons of sugar in 1851. The eventual collapse of the sugar market caused Marshall to quit the enterprise and sell the property. His failure marked the effective demise of Dunlawton Plantation, and its role in the political history of East Florida ended. The property changed hands several times in the following years, being used for various purposes. =Civil War and following years= Iron cane juice boiling kettle During the American Civil War, the kettles for boiling cane juice were used by the Confederates for salt-making. A Confederate reconnaissance patrol called the St. John Rangers made their headquarters at the Dunlawton millhouse, hitching their horses and camping under a large live oak now called the \\"Confederate Oak\\". John Marshall sold the plantation in 1871 to William Dougherty, whose son Charles inherited the property when his father died. A successful lawyer, Charles was elected Florida's first United States Congressman. He showed no interest in agriculture, however, and the mill was never operated again. The mill sugar boiling kettles were no longer used to process sugar after the Civil War, but when two whales beached themselves below the newly built wooden Port Orange bridge in 1906, their carcasses were dragged to Dunlawton plantation where the furnaces were fired up and the oil from the whales' blubber rendered in the old kettles. The remains of the sugar mill include the ruins of coquina block and brick structures, and an assortment of sugar processing equipment including the gear mechanisms of the rolling sugar cane press, the iron boiling kettles, and the steam furnace and piston mechanisms used in operating the cane press. This assembly is one of the earliest extant examples in the United States of the machinery required to produce sugar, molasses, and rum. =Bongoland= Anatomically inaccurate statue of a stegosaurus at Bongoland In 1948, Dr. Perry Sperber, a dermatologist practicing in Daytona Beach, leased the Dunlawton plantation property from J. Saxton Lloyd, and opened one of the first theme-parks in Florida, Bongoland, named after Bongo, a trained baboon kept in captivity there. The new attraction was advertised to tourists traveling south on U.S. Highway 1, but it proved to be short-lived, operating only from 1948 to 1952. A miniature train carried visitors past life-sized statues of so-called \\"prehistoric monsters\\"‚Äîdinosaurs fashioned by M.D. \\"Manny\\" Lawrence out of chicken wire and concrete. Among the five statues still existing are a triceratops, a stegosaurus, a tyrannosaurus rex, a dimetrodon and a giant ground sloth added later. According to a 1991 article in the Orlando Sentinel, a Seminole family lived on the grounds for two years in a chickee, or outdoor shelter with a thatched roof and open sides. In 1963, Lloyd landscaped the site, retaining the dinosaurs, and donated it to the county.  See also  * List of dinosaur parks References External links * Daniel T. Penton, Historic Sites Specialist.

It is an early example of the casting of non-professional actors and on-location shooting - both of which would influence the Left Bank of the French New Wave movement. Examining the romantic interactions between a group of immigrants (both from abroad and other parts of France) working around a quarry and a farm in Provence, it is also generally considered a major precursor to the Italian neorealist movement. Luchino Visconti, one of the founding members of the later film movement, was assistant director on the film. It was based out of Marcel Pagnol's studios in Marseille and shot entirely on location in the South of France.O'Shaughnessy p.86 Although Toni is not among Renoir's most famous works, it continues to receive positive reviews from critics. Plot Looking for a job Toni goes from Italy to Southern France. A local woman named Marie takes him in as her tenant and becomes his lover. But when the Spanish guestworker Josepha comes to town, Toni falls for her. To his disappointment Josepha has a wedding with a wealthier man.

After several years of financial difficulties, the company ceased operation in 1999 and its assets were sold. Its flagship store, corporate office and warehouse complex occupied two blocks in downtown Detroit for almost 80 years. The store was a direct competitor of the J. L. Hudson Company and the Ernst Kern Company until Kern's closed in 1959. Crowley's and Hudson's were both noted for their lavish annual Christmas displays. Faced with a decline in retail traffic in downtown Detroit, Crowley's closed its downtown location in July 1977. The firm operated a store in Detroit's New Center area that remained open until the chain's demise in 1999. On March 11, 1995, the chain acquired Steinbach in the northeast US. When Crowley's ceased operation in 1999, several of its locations were purchased by discount chain Value City. Three in the Detroit area were rebranded Crowley's Value City and remained part of the Value City chain until it also ceased operating in 2008.  History  In 1909, Joseph J. Crowley, his brothers William and Daniel, and William L. Milner joined to save the Detroit-based store of Pardridge & Blackwell that was struggling financially. Joseph Crowley previously worked as a credit manager for the Detroit wholesale firm of Burnham Stoepel and had great experience reorganizing struggling ventures. He and his brothers opened the Crowley Brothers Wholesale Dry Goods Company in 1902. William Milner was a regular customer of the Crowley Brothers through his W.L. Milner Department Store of Toledo, Ohio. Pardridge & Blackwell formed in 1901 and was on the edge of insolvency due to poor management and the recession of 1907. The opportunity to assume control of the retailer came when an executive of the Central Savings Bank of Detroit, one of the store's creditors, approached Joseph Crowley. Crowley agreed on the condition that his two brothers and Milner join him and Crowley, Milner and Company was born. Immediately after the incorporation of Crowley, Milner and Co., its owners envisioned the store as one of the highest quality retail operations in Detroit. At the turn of the twentieth century, Detroit was regarded as one of the most affluent cities in the United States, and Crowley, Milner & Co. helped to uphold this image. The owners stocked the store with luxurious clothing and gifts imported from Europe and opened a full-service restaurant and grocery store. Within ten years, the Crowley, Milner & Co. expanded its building and was the largest department store in Michigan. Pardridge & Blackwell Building c. 1910 from Farmer and Monroe Streets The Pardridge & Blackwell Building occupied the western half of the block bounded by Farmer Street, Gratiot Avenue, Library and Monroe Streets. It contained six floors with large triple windows on the second through fourth floors divided by piers faced with white glazed brick and terra cotta. The piers formed arches above the windows of the fifth floor with windows on the sixth floor spaced between the corbels supporting the elaborate cornice above. Two large illuminated signs proclaiming \\"\\"P.& B.\\" inside a heart graced the northwest and southwest corners of the roof. Crowley, Milner expanded the building by removing the cornice to add a seventh and eighth floor and expanding east to Library Street. In 1920, they then constructed an eleven-story \\"home store\\" on the site of the Goldberg Brothers store east of Library Street. Initially, the annex was connected to the main building by a tunnel. In 1923, the city of Detroit granted permission to connect the two structures above ground and an elaborate five-story bridge opened in 1925. The entrances on Farmer, Gratiot and Monroe were framed by large arches and the windows above the doors on the second floor were topped by a large pediment. One notable feature of the department store was wooden escalators which remained until the structure was demolished in 1977. The company stumbled slightly when Milner was killed in 1923 while traveling to his store in Toledo. The company lost its president and merchandising expert and his 42 percent interest in the corporation was sold by his heirs. Without Milner, the store eventually came to be known as Crowley's, but the company retained its full name until 1999. Joseph Crowley succeeded his friend and partner as president, but the loss of full control by the tight-knit group affected the company for many years. Like many retailers, the Great Depression impacted Crowley's deeply. Sales plummeted from $39 million in 1928 to only $10 million in 1929. Joseph Crowley died in 1937 and his widow repurchased the shares of the company sold by William Milner's heirs to give the Crowleys majority ownership in the corporation. Daniel J. Crowley, Joseph's son, became president and helped the company chart a course to recovery. =Expansion= The company began its transformation from a single store to a chain in 1959 when Crowley's expanded to the Detroit suburbs by opening its first store in the Westborn Shopping Center in Dearborn. This was followed by a store in the Grand River/Greenfield shopping area in northwest Detroit in 1960 and identical stores in the Livonia and Macomb Malls in 1964. However, this expansion was at the expense of the downtown store. By 1960, the store consolidated enough to allow the Veteran's Administration to lease the lower six-floors of the annex building for $147,000 per year. In 1972, the firm purchased the Demery's chain which consisted of a store at Woodward and Milwaukee in the New Center neighborhood, and in the suburbs of Birmingham and Farmington Hills. The New Center store later moved into the New Center One Building. The Lakeside Mall store in Sterling Heights opened in 1975 followed in 1980 by stores at Universal Mall in Warren and Arborland Center in Ann Arbor. The Tel-Twelve Mall unit opened in 1985. In 1986, stores opened in Westland and at Courtland Center in Burton, the latter approximately one hour north of Detroit. The downtown store closed in 1977 due to declining sales. This was followed by closure of the office and warehouse building in 1978 and the Ann Arbor store in 1983 when the Arborland Center was converted to a discount center. Offices moved to a building on Lafayette Boulevard at the western edge of the downtown business district and remained there until the company's liquidation. The Grand River-Greenfield store was only , but continuously performed well in sales. It was located in several storefronts along Grand River Avenue and in 1987 the landlord wanted to redivide the building to lure new businesses. It offered Crowley's a portion of the renovated structure but the store declined. In 1985, members of the Crowley family, who still owned more than 51 percent of the company stock agreed to sell the store to Oakland Holding Company. = Decline = In 1990, Crowley's opened a new prototype men's store adjacent to its Farmington store which immediately was successful. The store-within-a-store concept focused on men's businesswear and was immediately expanded to other branches. This was an attempt to lure customers back from newcomers to the Detroit market such as MainStreet, a unit of Federated Department Stores which later became Kohl's, and Mervyns. Crowley's changed its product line to feature more upmarket with lines by Calvin Klein and Ralph Lauren aimed at the Hudson's or Lord & Taylor shopper. This move alienated many traditional customers as Crowley's was seen as a more mid-market store with locations in Detroit's older suburbs. The prototype men's clothing store proved to be a successful move. Sales were strong, and the company discussed plans to introduce more similar stores in the future. This store within a store had its own entrance and focused on men's suits and accessories; similar to the Men's Wearhouse. The young men's and sportswear was in the located in the main store. Also, Crowley's instituted a \\"Frequent Buyer\\" program at all of its stores, as a method of encouraging customer loyalty. The program kept track of each customer's monthly purchase amounts, and then the stores issued gift certificates based on each person's sales figures. Despite the initial success of the Frequent Buyers program and the new store format, annual sales dropped almost $10 million from 1991 to 1992. In March 1991, Crowley, Milner & Co. announced it was seeking a merger partner that was large enough to help the company expand. It was management's opinion that long-term growth for the Crowley's chain would come through acquisition of some type, with the most likely scenario being an acquisition by another party. In late 1992, the company opened a store carrying only women's clothing in Lansing, based on the concept of its men's store in Farmington. The store was unsuccessful and analysts were split on the reasons. Some felt it was due to the location or layout while others cited the unfamiliarity of the Crowley's brand in the Lansing market. In 1993, the company obtained a revolving line of credit from Schottenstein Stores, which provided Crowley, Milner & Co. with the ability to resume payments to its creditors. It then implemented other changes which included a new computer software system to manage personnel, closing the Westland store and eliminating the Frequent Buyers program. The result was that sales increased in 1994 and the company announced its first profitable quarter in almost five years. Management continued to rebuild financial stability by obtaining a new working capital loan from Congress Financial Corporation to replace the agreement with Schottenstein Stores Corp. Management also announced a two-for- one common stock split, introduced its own credit card and the new slogan \\"Detroit's Own Department Store\\". Sales in 1995 rose to $109.9 million. On November 21 of that year, Crowley's purchased the Steinbach chain with 24 stores in Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, New Hampshire and Vermont from the Schottenstein family. The company planned to sell approximately 10 of the stores and continue operation of the others. It ultimately retained 16 stores. In 1996, Crowley's proposed a new store for Novi's Main Street development but this fell through by 1999, as did a 1998 takeover of local women's fashion chain Winkelman's. It did expand into the Winkelman's store at Tel-Twelve Mall and opened a separate Men's store in that mall. On June 1, 1997, Crowley's opened its enlarged store in the atrium of the New Center One Building. The expansion was in space previously occupied by Winkelman's and a bookstore which became children's and home stores separate from men's and women's clothing. This was not their largest location, but was the most profitable store by square footage. At the same time it heralded the success of the New Center store, Crowley's announced a costly lesson from its purchase of Steinbach in the form of a $4 million loss during the first quarter of 1997. This was up from $1.3 million for the first quarter of 1996. The losses proved too great and in 1997, the company began to downsize in the hope of remaining viable. Crowley's lost the lease on the Birmingham store it acquired as part of the Demrey's merger when the landlord announced it would redevelop the site into a retail-entertainment complex.[15] Losses which were $5.2 million for the first half of 1998 could not be offset with renovation delays in reopening its largest location, the Macomb Mall store in time for critical back to school sales. On January 4, 1999, Shottenstein Stores and Value City took control of Crowley's in a stock swap transaction. Two weeks later, trading of the company's stock was suspended.[16] On February 8, 1999, Crowley's filed for reorganization under Chapter 11 bankruptcy laws and announced it would liquidate the remaining nine Crowley's and 16 Steinbach's stores and sell eight additional locations to Value City.[9][17] The Livonia Mall, Universal Mall, Macomb Mall and Westborn Mall stores were sold to discounter Value City who operated the three as Crowley's Value City.[13] The Westborn Mall location was resold and demolished to construct a Kroger.[14] Another mall-based location at Lakeside Mall in Sterling Heights was sold to Target Corporation to create an expansion to the Hudson's store. Four Steinbach stores in New Jersey (Ocean Township, Paramus, Manalapan, Egg Harbor Township) were also sold to Value City.  References   Further reading  * Crowley, Milner & Co.

He recruited more than 8,000 volunteers, of whom 2,000 were accepted, most of them as pilots. They were known collectively as \\"Miller's Boys\\". On the second recruitment drive, Miller took along two Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.2 aircraft and mechanics to assemble the aircraft in Cape Town. The aircraft were serial numbers A3109 and A3110 built by Wolseley Motors Limited. They were nicknamed Rio de Janeiro Britons Nos. 1 & 2 in honour of the fact that they were purchased with money raised by the British community in Rio de Janeiro. On 8 November 1917, one of these aircraft became the first to complete a long distance flight in South Africa by completing a Cape Town to Port Elizabeth flight in under six hours. After the war, Miller pursued a career in civil aviation. His first two ventures were unsuccessful and short-lived: the South African Aerial Navigation Company, which became South African Aerial Transports Ltd (1919‚Äì1920), and Rhodesian Aerial Tours (1922). In 1924, Miller was elected as a Member of Parliament. In this capacity, he successfully lobbied for government support for civil aviation. He gave flying demonstrations, toured the country to popularise flying, and encouraged the formation of flying clubs. In 1929, Miller founded Union Airways, as the country's first commercial mail and passenger carrier. It amalgamated with South West African Airways in 1932, and was nationalised in 1934 and renamed South African Airways. In 1936, Miller took part in the Portsmouth-to-Johannesburg Air Race, held to mark Johannesburg's Golden Jubilee. During World War II, Miller served in the South African Air Force, where he commanded several flying schools. After the war, he worked as chief publicity officer for South African Airways. The main road leading to the airport in his home town, Port Elizabeth, is named after him. References * Illsley, J.W. (2003).

A veteran of the American Civil War, he was elected Governor of Vermont as a Republican in 1869, and was the first Vermont Governor to die in office. Washburn was a native of Lynn, Massachusetts, and was raised in Ludlow, Vermont. he graduated from Dartmouth College in 1835, and taught school while studying law. He was admitted to the bar in 1838, and practiced law, first in Ludlow and then in Woodstock, while also becoming active in politics as a Whig. In addition to campaigning for Whigs including William Henry Harrison, Washburn held elected and appointed offices, including Reporter of Decisions for the Vermont Supreme Court and member of the Vermont House of Representatives. In addition to pursuing a political career, Washburn was active in the Vermont Militia; he was commander of a regiment with the rank of colonel in the late 1830s and early 1840s, and organized a company in anticipation of the American Civil War, which he commanded as a captain. Washburn's company was federalized in 1861 as part of the 1st Vermont Infantry; he was commissioned as the regiment's lieutenant colonel and second- in-command. He became the de facto commander after John W. Phelps was promoted to command of a brigade, and he led the regiment during its participation in the Battle of Big Bethel. Washburn was elected adjutant general of the state militia in late 1861, and led it for the rest of the war, including the state's response to the St. Albans Raid. In 1869, Washburn was the successful Republican nominee for governor. He served from October 15 until his death on February 7, 1870. His death in Woodstock was attributed to nervous exhaustion caused by overwork, and he was buried at River Street Cemetery in Woodstock. Early life Washburn was born in Lynn, Massachusetts on September 7, 1814, the son of Judge Reuben and Hannah Blaney (Thacher) Washburn of Cavendish, Vermont. His family moved to Vermont in 1817 and settled in Ludlow, Vermont in 1825. Washburn attended the public schools of Ludlow and Black River Academy, then attended Dartmouth College. He graduated in 1835, and was a member of Phi Beta Kappa. He was principal of the Haverhill Academy while studying law under his father in Ludlow, and with William Upham in Montpelier. After completing his legal education with a year at Harvard Law School, in 1838 Washburn was admitted to the bar, and he began practicing law in Ludlow in January 1839. Active in politics as a Whig, Washburn was one of the secretaries of a Windsor County convention organized to support William Henry Harrison in the 1840 presidential election. From 1840 to 1842, Washburn served as Assistant Clerk of the Vermont House of Representatives. In 1844, Washburn moved to Woodstock and formed a partnership with Charles P. Marsh, which they maintained until Washburn's death in 1870. Also in 1844, Washburn was elected reporter of decisions of the Vermont Supreme Court, a position he held for eight years. He represented Woodstock in the Vermont House of Representatives from 1853 to 1855. Washburn was also involved in civic causes, including becoming active in the temperance movement. He became active in the Republican Party in 1855; he was a delegate to the 1860 Republican National Convention, and served as chairman of the Vermont delegation. Civil War Washburn had served as colonel of a Vermont militia regiment from 1837 until 1841, and in 1857 he organized the Woodstock Light Infantry company, which he commanded as a captain. In 1861, Washburn's unit was mustered into federal service for the American Civil War as Company B, 1st Vermont Infantry. He was commissioned lieutenant colonel and second in command of the regiment on May 9, 1861. The commander of the 1st Vermont, John W. Phelps, was soon promoted to brigadier general and command of a brigade, so Washburn was the regiment's de facto commander during nearly all of its three months of service at Fortress Monroe and Newport News, Virginia. Washburn also commanded five companies of the 1st Vermont and five from the 4th Massachusetts infantry at the Battle of Big Bethel on June 10, 1861. He was mustered out with his regiment on August 15, 1861. Later career In October 1861, the Vermont General Assembly elected Washburn to succeed Horace Henry Baxter as Adjutant General and Inspector General of the state militia with the rank of brigadier general. During his tenure, he oversaw the raising, equipping and fielding of seven infantry regiments, one cavalry regiment, three batteries of light artillery, and two companies of sharpshooters for the Union Army. Washburn also took charge of Vermont's response following the October 1864 St. Albans Raid by Confederate soldiers based in Canada. The state responded by organizing the Frontier Cavalry and deploying it to patrol the Canadian border with Vermont and New York, and Vermont's contingent included two companies, one based in Burlington, and one in St. Albans. Washburn issued a militia commission to Ann Eliza Smith, the wife of Governor J. Gregory Smith. The Smiths were residents of St. Albans, and Smith had been in the state capital of Montpelier on the day of the raid. His home was a target, and when Mrs. Smith appeared in the front doorway carrying an unloaded pistol (the only weapon she could find), the raiders decided to bypass the house. Mrs. Smith then worked to organize the people of St. Albans to mount a pursuit of the raiders, which unsuccessfully attempted to prevent them from escaping to Canada. Washburn recognized her heroism by appointing her as a brevet lieutenant colonel on the adjutant general's military staff. Under Washburn's leadership, the adjutant general's office compiled 300 bound volumes of commander's reports, accounts and other records pertaining to service members from Vermont who took part in the war. Of the more than 34,000 men Vermont provided to the Union, only 75 were unaccounted for after the war. In 1866, Washburn declined reelection as adjutant general. He was succeeded by William Wells. Washburn was one of the organizers of the Reunion Society of Vermont Officers and delivered the keynote address at the society's 1868 annual meeting. In addition to resuming his law practice, Washburn was an organizer of the Woodstock Railroad Company, of which he was elected president. He also served on the board of directors for the Rutland and Woodstock Railroad. Governor In 1869, Washburn was a candidate for governor and won the Republican nomination at the party's state convention in June by defeating Dudley Chase Denison and Julius Converse. He defeated Democrat Homer W. Heaton in the general election, and took office on October 15, 1869. During his term, the state enacted a law changing the term for state offices including governor from one year to two. Death and burial Washburn died in Woodstock on February 7, 1870. Doctors could not find a cause, and attributed his death to nervous exhaustion brought on by overwork. He was interred at River Street Cemetery in Woodstock. Washburn's signature Family In 1839, Washburn was married to Almira E. Ferris (1816-1848) of Swanton, Vermont. In 1849, he married Almira P. Hopkins (1816-1910) of Glens Falls, New York. With his first wife Washburn was the father of son Ferris (1842-1860), who died at age 18 while a student at Dartmouth College, and daughter Emily May (\\"Emma\\"), who died at age 6 (1846-1853). With his second wife, Washburn was the father of four children, including Thacher (1859-1862), who died as an infant. Daughter Elizabeth (1852-1938), the wife of Thomas Wilson Dorr Worthen survived him, as did daughter Mary (1854-1941), the wife of George B. Parkinson, and son Charles (1856-1904). Washburn was a descendant of James Chilton through Chilton's daughter Mary. As a result of this family connection, Washburn's surviving children became members of the Society of Mayflower Descendants when it was founded in the late 1800s.

A fictionalised account based on the life story of Thai palace musician Luang Pradit Phairoh (Sorn Silapabanleng), it follows the life of a Thai classical musician from the late 19th century to the 1940s. The film was the winner of several awards in Thailand and was the country's official selection for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. It was directed by Ittisoontorn Vichailak and producers included Nonzee Nimibutr and Chatrichalerm Yukol. The film was also credited with a revival in the popularity of piphat ‚Äì Thai classical music. In 2015, this film had been remade into a musical play from the 4th of April to 17 Mayhttp://www.thaiticketmajor.com/performance/performance- detail.php?sid=2686&la;=en at KBank Siam Pic-Ganesha Theatre. Plot Starting out in the 1940s, the story finds the elder Sorn bed-ridden. To an old friend, he recalls his childhood growing up in 1880s Siam, during the reign of King Chulalongkorn and the action flashes back to that time. Sorn's brother was a gifted classical musician, so gifted in fact that it caused a rivalry with other musicians that ended in Sorn's brother's death. Because of that, Sorn's father bars the boy from taking up the ranad-ek (Thai xylophone). However, Sorn, who has shown a talent for the instrument since an early age, defies his father and sneaks off to practice playing in an abandoned temple in the jungle. Eventually, he becomes so skilled at the instrument that his father lets him play after he speaks to a monk who advises him that he should not deny him the right to play ranad-ek. Sorn excels in his studies to the point where he is noticed by other bands. They ask for his presence to complete. He becomes arrogant and misses practice telling his father that his faith isn't misplaced. His father teaches his place by putting him on the Kong-wong. At the competition, the competitor scares his uncle (the substitute on ranad-ek) and becomes clear that the competitor has superior skill. As their playing, the judge realises that Sorn isn't playing on the ranad-ek and calls the teacher out on the fact that if they have a good player, might as well bring out the good material because then you can lose with dignity. The band starts over and plays the same song, but Sorn is skilled. He wins every competition as a boy. So One day, in a local village, Sorn and his ensemble are set up to perform in a courtyard. Across the courtyard is another ensemble, led by a fierce-looking bearded ranad-ek player dressed in black. As the rival player starts to perform, a storm whips up adding to the ominous mood of the setting. Sorn is disturbed by his fiery ability to play and wants to learn like him. But Sorn's talent does not go unnoticed and he is soon chosen to play for a local nobleman and is sent to the palace for more formal music training. There he meets an older man that he thinks is a palace caretaker, or some type of lowly person that does not know about music. However, later, when Sorn is to meet his new teacher, Master Tian, it is revealed to be the old man he met earlier. Tian turns out to be a strict teacher and instructs Sorn on all the instruments of the Thai classical music ensemble. At one point, Sorn is punished for being too flashy a player and is made to relinquish the ranad-ek to an inferior player, much to the dismay of other members in his ensemble, as well as a high palace official watching the performance. So when it comes time for the kingdom's musical competition, it is Sorn who is again the lead player. However, Sorn must overcome his fear at the competition, because he must again face the fierce, bearded ranad-ek performer. The story flashes back forward to the 1940s again, showing Sorn as a respected teacher. One day Sorn's son has a piano moved into his father's studio. The expectation is that his father will be furious at having a newfangled Western instrument brought into his house. But instead of being mad, he instructs his son to play a tune on the piano. The elder Sorn then takes up his ranad-ek mallets and improvises with his son, blending Thai and Western music. This is during the rule of the dictator, Field Marshal Plaek Pibulsonggram, whose government called for the accelerated modernisation of Thailand. As a result, performances of traditional Thai music, dance and theatre were frowned upon. In Sorn's neighbourhood, the orders are enforced by Lieutenant-Colonel Veera. Sorn teaches the Lieutenant a nation can only withstand outside forces if their nation is strong. For that to happen, they must believe in themselves. No matter what, they must protect their heritage and honor it regardless of what they are to become. Sorn plays not only to defy the rules, but to teach a lesson about culture and heritage.

It can be called the \\"granddaughter of adrenalin\\" in the line of Œ≤2 agonists that gave quick relief for bronchospasm and asthma. Epinephrine (adrenalin) was the first of these, and next came isoprenaline (isoproterenol). Isoetharine was the third drug in this line, thus the third generation or granddaughter of the original. In the western US it was the drug of choice in the late 1970s and early 1980s for nebulization (\\"breathing treatment\\") to relieve airway spasm. It generally gave sharp relief of shortness of breath, starting within two to five minutes after the patient began breathing the nebulized mist. This rapid onset is not as clearly present in later drugs. All of the early Œ≤2 agonist catecholamines used for bronchospasm had strong side effects, with increase in heart rate as the most common and most problematic. This came because its \\"Œ≤2 effect\\" was not quite as selective as might be hoped. Œ≤1 receptors appeared to also be stimulated in some patients, causing cardiac and other CNS side effects. With isoetarine this effect tended to be transient and usually went away within a matter of minutes after the end of the treatment. Increase in blood pressure also occurred in a small but significant percentage of cases, but also was almost invariably transient. By the late 1980s isoetharine was largely replaced by orciprenaline (metaproterenol), which seemed to have slightly less cardiac side effect and lasted a couple of hours longer. Orciprenaline in turn was replaced by salbutamol (albuterol). Some practitioners still believe that these later aerosolized bronchodilators never gave quite as quick of relief from asthmatic shortness of breath as did isoetarine. Thus they see a continued specialty role in treatment of severe shortness of breath that does not improve in the first five minutes of salbutamol treatment.

According to Cowan their lifestyles were a great help in their subsequent careers: \\"We each had to have a car.

Early years Graf Henckel von Donnersmarck was born in 1973 in Cologne, West Germany, into the aristocratic Roman Catholic Henckel von Donnersmarck family. He grew up in New York City, Brussels, Frankfurt, and West Berlin and is fluent in English, German, French, Russian, and Italian. After graduating at the top of his class from the German section of the European School of Brussels I, he studied Russian literature in St. Petersburg for two years and passed the State Exam for Teachers of Russian as a Foreign Language. He holds a Master of Arts degree in Philosophy, politics and economics at New College, University of Oxford, and a diploma in Film Directing from the University of Television and Film Munich. Family The younger son of Leo-Ferdinand Graf (Count) Henckel von Donnersmarck, a former president of the German division of the Order of Malta, and literary scout Anna Maria von Berg, Henckel von Donnersmarck holds German and Austrian citizenships. His father's only brother, Gregor Henckel-Donnersmarck, is the emeritus abbot at Heiligenkreuz Abbey, a Cistercian monastery in the Vienna Woods where Florian spent a month writing the first draft of The Lives of Others (German: Das Leben der Anderen). Graf Henckel von Donnersmarck is married to Christiane Asschenfeldt, the first International Executive Director of Creative Commons. They have three children and currently live in Los Angeles. He stands 2.05 m (6 ft 9 in) tall. Career In 1977, while living as a child in New York, he saw his first movie at the Museum of Modern Art. He expected to see Doctor Dolittle but was \\"exposed instead to\\" the German melodrama Variet√©. He cites this experience as the start of his interest in film.Rohter, Larry. \\"German Director Plunges Beyond His Comfort Zone\\", The New York Times, 8 December 2010 (9 December 2010 p. C1 NY ed.). Retrieved 8 December 2010. In 1996, he won a directing apprenticeship with Richard Attenborough on In Love and War, and then went to study at the Fiction Directing Class of the Hochschule f√ºr Fernsehen und Film M√ºnchen (University of Television and Film Munich), Germany, alma mater of directors as diverse as Wim Wenders, Roland Emmerich and Maren Ade, who was Donnersmarck's classmate. His first short film, Dobermann (which he wrote, produced, directed and edited), broke the school record for the number of awards won by a student production. It became an international festival sensation, and Donnersmarck traveled the festival circuit for over a year. His first feature film Das Leben der Anderen (The Lives of Others), which Donnersmarck spent three years writing, directing and completing, won the European Film Award for Best Film, Best Actor and Best Screenplay in 2006. Donnersmarck won the Los Angeles Film Critics Association's award for Best Foreign Film, was nominated for the Golden Globe (which went to Clint Eastwood instead), and on 25 February 2007 won the Academy Award for Best International Feature Film. In 2007, Donnersmarck was one of 115 new members to be invited to join AMPAS.Academy Invites 115 to Become Members His next film, The Tourist, was released in 2010. Donnersmarck re-wrote, directed and completed his sophomore work in under eleven months, telling Charlie Rose he had wanted a break from writing a dark screenplay about suicide. The Tourist was a thriller starring Angelina Jolie and Johnny Depp, and was nominated for three Golden Globes: Best Musical or Comedy, Depp for Actor Musical or Comedy and Jolie for Actress Musical or Comedy. It also won three Teen Choice Awards nominations (Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Actress) of which it won two. The film opened to middling number, but eventually ended up grossing US$278.3 million at the worldwide box office, prompting The Hollywood Reporter belatedly to proclaim it an \\"international hit\\". In 2019, his third feature film Never Look Away was nominated for the Golden Lion at the 75th Venice International Film Festival, for a Golden Globe by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association and for two Oscars in the Best International Feature Film and Best Cinematography categories at the 91st Academy Awards. This was only the second time in history that a German language film by a German director was nominated for an Oscar in multiple categories, the other film being Wolfgang Petersen's Das Boot 36 years prior. It became one of only sixteen German language features since the end of World War II to surpass one million euros at the North American box office. He is the only director who has two films in that list. In the Netherlands, one of the first countries to release the movies outside of Germany, Never Look Away became the most successful German language film since The Lives of Others. Influence In a 2010 interview with The Guardian, director Howard Davies named Donnersmarck as the artist he most admired. Ren√© Pollesch wrote a play, L'Affaire Martin!, which poked fun at von Donnersmarck. According to Pollesch, the director's parents attended a performance and came backstage to say they liked it. After meeting him at the Davos World Economic Forum, Jay Nordlinger, writing for the National Review, described Donnersmarck as \\"one of the most impressive people on the planet\\".

The Swiss Academies of Arts and Sciences is a Swiss organization that supports and networks the sciences at a regional, national and international level. They are designated by the Federal Act to Promote Research and InnovationIn German FIFG. to promote research together with the Swiss National Science Foundation.Swiss national research promotion institutions http://www.sbfi.admin.ch/themen/01367/01676/index.html?lang=en. The Swiss Academies of Arts and Sciences is an association of four distinct Swiss academies of different kinds: * Swiss Academy of Natural Sciences (SCNAT);Website of the SCNAT http://www.scnat.ch. * Swiss Academy of Medical Sciences (SAMW);Website of the SAMW http://www.samw.ch. * Swiss Academy of Humanities and Social Sciences (SAGW);Website of the SAGW http://www.sagw.ch. * Swiss Academy of Engineering Sciences (SATW).Website of the SATW http://www.satw.ch. Overview The two Centres for Excellence TA-SWISS and Fondation Science et Cit√© are also member of the Swiss Academies of Arts and Sciences.Portrait of the Swiss Academies of Arts and Sciences on their official website http://www.akademien-schweiz.ch/en/index/Portrait.html. Forums and platforms allow the Academy to adopt an interdisciplinary approach to various topics, and to strengthen the disciplinary national and international network. The Academy also coordinates the sciences among the universities in Switzerland, while cooperating with institutions for the promotion of research, such as the Swiss National Science Foundation. At a regional level, too, scientific topics are brought to the attention of a large public. This task has been assumed by the cantonal and regional associations, which organise lecture series supported by the Academy and produce publications. Main activities * Foresight of socially relevant topics * Raising awareness of the ethical responsibility of the sciences * Promoting a balanced dialogue between science and society. Foresight The earlier, the better. This especially applies if topics are to be identified that are of major significance for the future of society and the environment. The Academy‚Äôs activities in this respect include operating scientific monitoring systems (glaciers, Permos, etc.) and providing platforms for socially relevant topics (forums). But also new technologies that are being developed, such as nanotechnology, biotechnology, synthetic biology, etc., represent challenges for the sciences. Here, it is crucial to scientifically determine the consequences so as to be able to take advantage of the opportunities and minimise the risks. Promoted by the Academy, exchange within and among the sciences ensures a broad basis for the early detection of socially relevant problems. Ethical responsibility Knowing that representatives of science adhere to ethical rules bolsters society‚Äôs trust in science. And this is what makes future-oriented research possible in the first place. Therefore, it is important that scientists take ethical matters of concern seriously, because research always has an ethical dimension as well. Awareness of this can be raised among both researchers and society by providing ethical guidelines to be applied in research work. Such guidelines are drawn up by the Academy, in conjunction with researchers. The Swiss Academies of Arts and Sciences produced brochures of guidelines and recommendations such as \\"Ethical principles and guidelines on animal testing\\", \\"Authorship in scientific publications ‚Äì analysis and recommendations\\", \\"Scientific policy advice ‚Äì recommendations\\" and \\"Scientific integrity - principles and procedural rules\\".Guidelines and recommendations, Swiss Academies of Arts and Sciences (page visited on 11 January 2016). Dialogue between sciences and society We encounter a great many applications of sciences in everyday life. We may want to know more about them but technical terminology often prevents a true dialogue. Therefore, it is important that scientific topics are carried into society and communicated in easy-to-understand language. It is equally important, however, for science to inquire about the needs of society and to take them up, either by responding to questions and concerns raised by politics or by providing the media with information. The dialogue between science and society is to allow for open, critical communication from both sides. Among other things, the Academy encourages this dialogue by means of information and events highlighting new fields of research, by supporting regional projects and by awarding prizes for outstanding scientific communication or for exhibitions on nature and the sciences.

CSG‚Äôs primary goal is to promote community development through pooling resources of community members.  Origins  CSG was founded by a group of youths fresh from college in October 2001. Daniel Ogola was elected the chairperson. The other office bearers as per the CSG constitution were Justus Wambua (Projects Coordinator), Collins Seroney (Treasurer) and Christopher Olongo (Organizing secretary). Others included Rebecca Ndunda and Mwalimu Elizabeth Achieng. In December of the same year it was legally registered through the Office of the Vice President and 'Ministry of Home Affairs, Heritage and Sports'.  Organizing strategy  Dissimilar to the majority of NGOs working in Kenya, residence within the affected community is a prerequisite to involvement in either the board of directors or the membership of CSG. Membership is defined by participation, and, in part, by voluntary dues contributions. CSG collects membership dues to offset reliance on external funds (i.e. foreign foundations and charities).  Accomplishments  CSG has worked on a variety of different projects to meet its stated goals. Some of these include: HIV/AIDS awareness clinics and outreach; Mosquito net distribution; Neighborhood cleanups; Sustainable mushroom cultivation; Informal sector worker organizing; Job and computer training; Development of the CSG Library; and Operation Tusaidiane, an ongoing indigenous community theater project. CSG was the 2002 winner for \\"Best Practice: Innovative Interventions on Youth Development\\" awarded by the Kenyan Ministry of Gender, Sports, Culture and Social Services, Department of Social Services, Youth Division.  Partnerships  Apart from a range of international relationships with individuals in advisory positions, CSG has worked most closely with the Matibabu Foundation of the United States. Matibabu provides medical care, training and equipment to residents of Ugenya, an area near Lake Victoria. In 2006, CSG formed Helping Hands Tours & Safaris, an ecotourism agency that offers more traditional Kenya tours as well as community based tours of the Kibera slums.  Kibera slums  The Kibera slums, an area 5 kilometers southwest of City Centre Nairobi, is the most populated informal settlement in East Africa, housing more than one quarter of Nairobi‚Äôs population. The name ‚ÄòKibera‚Äô is a Nubian word for ‚Äòforest.‚Äô The original settlers were Sudanese soldiers who settled there after fighting for the British in World War I. Kibera is roughly 2 kilometers squared with an estimated population of 1 million people. There are no residential buildings over a single storey. The average home size in Kibera is 3 meters by 3 meters, with an average of five persons per dwelling. Urban services such as water or sanitation are minimal. There is an average of one pit latrine for every 50 to 500 people.

Philosopher Martin Gustafsson at the University of Stockholm argues that VoF exaggerates the threats against rationality and science, and that its representatives erroneously depict themselves as underdogs in a war on widespread superstition. He has also maintained that the Enlightenment's ideal of free thought clashes with the respect for scientific authority that VoF espouses.Folkbildare s√§tter krokben f√∂r sig sj√§lva, SvD Br√§nnpunkt, 10 dec 2007 Per-Anders Forstorp at the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, suggests that VoF represents positivism and institutionalised intolerance.Per-Anders Forstorp, 2005, The construction of pseudo-science: Science patrolling and knowledge policing by academic prefects and weeders VEST: Journal for science and technology studies vol. 18, no. 3-4, pp. 17-71 Sven Ove Hansson has commented on this kind of criticism: > ‚ÄùThe way I see it, VoF and the general skeptical movement is not > characterised by any particular view of science. ‚Ä¶ Just like members of > Amnesty International can have different ideas about the limits of free > speech, there is room in VoF for divergent opinions in questions about > science and the philosophy of science.

Personal After studies at the School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University and Trinity College, Hartford, Crile worked as a reporter for Washington columnists Drew Pearson and Jack Anderson, and as the Pentagon correspondent for Ridder Newspapers. Crile came from a line of pioneering surgeons. His grandfather, Dr. George Washington Crile, was a founder of the Cleveland Clinic. His father, Dr. George Crile Jr., was a leading figure in the United States in challenging unnecessary surgery, best known for his part in eliminating radical breast surgery. His wife was Susan Lyne, former President of ABC Entertainment and former CEO of Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia. Crile died at age 61 from pancreatic cancer.  Career at CBS Crile was both a producer and reporter for CBS. His career with the company spanned three decades until his death in 2006. Before joining CBS at the age of 31, Crile was Washington Editor of Harper's Magazine. In addition to Harper's, his articles were published in The Washington Monthly, New Times, The Washington Post Outlook Section and The New York Times. =Producer= Crile joined CBS News in 1976 to produce The CIA's Secret Army, his trail- breaking documentary that chronicled the previously untold story of the CIA's secret wars against Castro after the Bay of Pigs Invasion. Historian Henry Steele Commager wrote that it would go down as one of the most important journalistic reports in U.S. American history. It was the first of a collection of broadcasts based on Crile's reporting, in which he took viewers into previously closed and inaccessible worlds. Among his notable documentary reports were The Battle for South Africa, which won a Peabody Award and The Uncounted Enemy: A Vietnam Deception. The latter, which aired on January 23, 1982, was the subject of a libel action brought by General William Westmoreland. CBS News and Crile were defended by attorney David Boies. Before the \\"Vietnam Deception\\" controversy Crile was embroiled in a similar controversy following the 1980 CBS Reports program \\"Gay Power, Gay Politics\\", which he reported, wrote, and co-produced. The program focused on gay politics in San Francisco following the assassination of openly gay Supervisor Harvey Milk in 1978. It was widely denounced as manipulative and dishonest, a view partially upheld by the National News Council, an industry self-policing body not known for its willingness to criticize the networks.For an account of the program's misrepresentation, see Larry Gross, Up From Invisibility: Lesbians, Gay Men, and the Media in America (Columbia University Press, 2001, pp. 50‚Äì54, ). For a critical account of Crile's Vietnam program's bias, see Stephen Klaidman and Tom Beauchamp, The Virtuous Journalist (Oxford University Press, 1987, p. 166, ). In 1985, Crile joined 60 Minutes, where he produced scores of reports with Mike Wallace, Ed Bradley and Harry Reasoner and established his credentials as a specialist in coverage of international affairs. He was on the forefront of covering the disintegration of the Soviet Union, and in collaboration with a Russian counterpart Artyom Borovik he became the only US American reporter ever to gain access to the Soviet Union's nuclear empire. =Reporter= His initial 60 Minutes report, revealing the Soviet nuclear command's willingness to consider halting the targeting of the US, played a significant role in helping set up a summit between the US and Soviet nuclear commanders. His numerous reports from inside the deadly secret worlds of Russia and the United States appeared on 60 Minutes and 60 Minutes II as well as an hour-long documentary for CNN. The Overseas Press Club twice awarded him the Edward R. Murrow Award for these broadcasts. Crile's reports included such subjects as Three Mile Island, the changing boundaries of death, judicial corruption in Texas. But throughout the years he focused primarily on covering crises in U.S. foreign affairs. Broadcast subjects included reports on: * The revolution in Haiti * The battle over the Panama Canal * US Cuban policy * The Afghan War * The Contra war * The Sandinistas * General Singlaub and the World Anti Communist League * Prince Bandar and the special U.S. Saudi connection * The African National Congress * America's losing war on drugs * The search for Archbishop Romero‚Äôs murderers. * Jonas Savimbi and the US backing of UNITA * The Gulf War * The USS Harlan County incident * The CIA's man in Havana * The killers of Rwanda * The unsung heroes of the US military campaign in El Salvador * The KGB and the world of Soviet Intelligence * Russia and America's nuclear arsenals After the September 11 attacks, Crile repeatedly drew on his extensive experience and contacts in Afghanistan, Pakistan and the Near East to provide behind the scenes look into the worlds of Osama bin Laden and militant Islam.  Charlie Wilson's War  In the late 1980s, Crile began the research and reporting on the Afghan War that led to his 2003 best-selling book, Charlie Wilson's War, which tells the story of how the United States funded the only successful jihad in modern history, the CIA's secret war in Afghanistan that was intended to give the Soviet Union their own Vietnam. The support for such jihad (mujahideen) leaders as Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, channelled via Pakistan, arguably led to the creation of a new threat to the U.S. and its allies, which Crile claimed to have foreseen. Charlie Wilson‚Äôs War has been widely and favorably reviewed and is currently in its 10th printing. The book attempted to portray how American government actually works, as opposed to what appears in political science textbooks. It is the basis of the Tom Hanks/Mike Nichols film, Charlie Wilson's War, which was released by Universal Studios in December 2007.

It debuted at the 2005 Frankfurt Auto Show along with the Fisker Tramonto. The Fisker Latigo CS was intended to be limited to a run of 150 cars. Ultimately, only two Latigos were ever produced, car #000, which was the prototype car built on a BMW 645i chassis, and car #001, which was ordered by a Southern California Customer in the Spring of 2007. History The Fisker Latigo and Tramonto were intended to bring back the lost art of custom coachbuilding. The intent was to allow high-end luxury customers to get the greatest exclusivity by both limiting production and by offering many customizable options. There may have been many reasons for slow sales in 2006-2007, but one reason was clear: steadily rising oil prices that were under $30 a barrel in 2004 but were headed toward $80 per barrel and higher in 2007. According to Henrik Fisker, many high-end customers were now expressing that their desire for luxury and performance was now accompanied by a desire for greater efficiency and for a \\"green\\" image. It was this realization, and a fateful meeting with Alan Niedzwieki of Quantum Fuel Systems, that led Henrik Fisker and Barnard Koehler to start a joint venture called Fisker Automotive, whereby Fisker Coachbuild would provide design and Quantum would provide the Hybrid-EV technology to create a new range-extended Electric Vehicle, which would ultimately be named the Fisker Karma. Fisker Coachbuild continues to provide design services for automotive and other applications. As Fisker Coachbuild turned its attention to the new EV market, the company stopped further marketing of the Latigo. The only two Latigos ever built were car #000, the prototype based on the BMW 645i, and the only customer car ever delivered: car #001 based on a BMW M6, discussed further below. Base architecture The Latigo CS is a two-door coupe based on the 2nd newest generation BMW 6 Series (E63). Fisker Coachbuild customers would purchase and deliver to Fisker a BMW 645/650/M6 and Fisker would build the Latigo CS on the existing chassis. The original exterior is replaced by a partly new body designed by Henrik Fisker (the bodyshell and doors remain as per the E63 6 Series). The body features extensive use of lightweight materials such as aluminium and carbon fibre. Customers could then choose from a number of customized upgrades to the engine/drivetrain, interior, and exterior. Rear end Options Fisker offered many choices for the exterior, with custom Fisker colors including Titanium Crystal Metallic, Silver Quartz Metallic, Raptor Red, Ocean Blue Metallic, or White Sands Metallic. The base interior of the BMW was redone with new leather and color options, while retaining the electronics and telematics of the original BMW. The leather interiors could be customized to taste, with much of the work being done by an Italian firm, with colors that included Saddle, Coral Reef, Pebble, Sand, Cotto, Raised Sand, Midnight Black, or white. If desired by the customer, even the trunk can be fully lined with leather as part of the Custom Trim Package that also included upgraded center console, door liners, and instrument panels. Alcantara was extensively used in both the interior headliner and the trunk. Engine Customers could choose to upgrade the BMW's already potent engine with Fisker's \\"Performance Plus\\" package, which took the M6 engine from 500 peak HP to over 650 HP. The engine upgrade selected for Fisker Latigo #001 was the top possibility - advertised by Fisker as a 665HP upgrade, it was a $55,000 upgrade whereby the engine was rebuilt and tuned by RD Sport (aka Racing Dynamics) as what they refer to as their 648HP \\"RS58\\" Motor. Described on their website: The V-10 RS58 uses much of the same technology found in the latest F1 motors: billet crankshaft, billet rods, and a set of forged pistons that are amongst the lightest to ever find their way into a production-based motor. The ported cylinder heads boast 17% more efficiency than the stock ones, and this is mainly obtained through the use of larger valves and modified cam profiles. The RS58 Package comes complete with a full exhaust system, including Race Exhaust Manifolds, Metal Matrix Sport Catalytic Converters, Sport X-Flow Midpipe and Competition Rear Silencers with Quad Tips. Latigo CS #001 The only customer car ordered was based on a BMW M6. Based on this original Fisker Purchase Order, the Southern California customer ordered the car with Custom Trim package and upgraded 665HP engine package on March 27, 2007. The car was sold to its second owner in late 2011, where it was part of a private collection. On February 5, 2018. The car was auctioned off on bringatrailer.com, where it sold for $105,001.

Sexual reproduction produces offspring by the fusion of gametes, resulting in offspring genetically different from the parent or parents. Asexual reproduction produces new individuals without the fusion of gametes, genetically identical to the parent plants and each other, except when mutations occur.  Asexual reproduction  In asexual reproduction male and female gametes do not fuse, as they do in sexual reproduction. Asexual reproduction may occur through Binary Fission, budding, fragmentation, spore formation, Regeneration and vegetative propagation. Plants have two main types of asexual reproduction in which new plants are produced that are genetically identical clone of the parent individual. Vegetative reproduction involves a vegetative piece of the original plant (budding, tillering, etc.) and is distinguished from apomixis, which is a replacement of sexual reproduction, and in some cases involves seeds. Apomixis appears in many plant species and also in some non-plant organisms. For apomixis and similar processes in non-plant organisms, see parthenogenesis. Natural vegetative reproduction is a process mostly found in herbaceous and woody perennial plants, and typically involves structural modifications of the stem or roots and in a few species leaves. Most plant species that employ vegetative reproduction do so as a means to perennialize the plants, allowing them to survive from one season to the next and often facilitating their expansion in size. A plant that persists in a location through vegetative reproduction of individuals constitutes a clonal colony; a single ramet, or apparent individual, of a clonal colony is genetically identical to all others in the same colony. The distance that a plant can move during vegetative reproduction is limited, though some plants can produce ramets from branching rhizomes or stolons that cover a wide area, often in only a few growing seasons. In a sense, this process is not one of reproduction but one of survival and expansion of biomass of the individual. When an individual organism increases in size via cell multiplication and remains intact, the process is called vegetative growth. However, in vegetative reproduction, the new plants that result are new individuals in almost every respect except genetic. A major disadvantage to vegetative reproduction, is the transmission of pathogens from parent to offspring; it is uncommon for pathogens to be transmitted from the plant to its seeds (in sexual reproduction or in apomixis), though there are occasions when it occurs. Seeds generated by apomixis are a means of asexual reproduction, involving the formation and dispersal of seeds that do not originate from the fertilization of the embryos. Hawkweed (Hieracium), dandelion (Taraxacum), some Citrus (Citrus) and Kentucky blue grass (Poa pratensis) all use this form of asexual reproduction. Pseudogamy occurs in some plants that have apomictic seeds, where pollination is often needed to initiate embryo growth, though the pollen contributes no genetic material to the developing offspring. Other forms of apomixis occur in plants also, including the generation of a plantlet in replacement of a seed or the generation of bulbils instead of flowers, where new cloned individuals are produced. Asexual reproduction is a type of reproduction where the offspring comes from one parent only, thus, inheriting the characteristics of the parent. = Structures = A rhizome is a modified underground stem serving as an organ of vegetative reproduction; the growing tips of the rhizome can separate as new plants, e.g., polypody, iris, couch grass and nettles. Prostrate aerial stems, called runners or stolons, are important vegetative reproduction organs in some species, such as the strawberry, numerous grasses, and some ferns. Adventitious buds form on roots near the ground surface, on damaged stems (as on the stumps of cut trees), or on old roots. These develop into above-ground stems and leaves. A form of budding called suckering is the reproduction or regeneration of a plant by shoots that arise from an existing root system. Species that characteristically produce suckers include Elm (Ulmus), Dandelion (Taraxacum), and many members of the Rose family such as Rosa and Rubus. Plants like onion (Allium cepa), hyacinth (Hyacinth), narcissus (Narcissus) and tulips (Tulipa) reproduce by dividing their underground bulbs into more bulbs. Other plants like potatoes (Solanum tuberosum) and dahlia (Dahlia) reproduce by a similar method involving underground tubers. Gladioli and crocuses (Crocus) reproduce in a similar way with corms. = Usage = The most common form of plant reproduction utilized by people is seeds, but a number of asexual methods are utilized which are usually enhancements of natural processes, including: cutting, grafting, budding, layering, division, sectioning of rhizomes, roots, tubers, bulbs, stolons, tillers, etc., and artificial propagation by laboratory tissue cloning. Asexual methods are most often used to propagate cultivars with individual desirable characteristics that do not come true from seed. Fruit tree propagation is frequently performed by budding or grafting desirable cultivars (clones), onto rootstocks that are also clones, propagated by stooling. In horticulture, a \\"cutting\\" is a branch that has been cut off from a mother plant below an internode and then rooted, often with the help of a rooting liquid or powder containing hormones. When a full root has formed and leaves begin to sprout anew, the clone is a self-sufficient plant, genetically identical. Examples include cuttings from the stems of blackberries (Rubus occidentalis), African violets (Saintpaulia), verbenas (Verbena) to produce new plants. A related use of cuttings is grafting, where a stem or bud is joined onto a different stem. Nurseries offer for sale trees with grafted stems that can produce four or more varieties of related fruits, including apples. The most common usage of grafting is the propagation of cultivars onto already rooted plants, sometimes the rootstock is used to dwarf the plants or protect them from root damaging pathogens. Since vegetatively propagated plants are clones, they are important tools in plant research. When a clone is grown in various conditions, differences in growth can be ascribed to environmental effects instead of genetic differences.  Sexual reproduction  Sexual reproduction involves two fundamental processes: meiosis, which rearranges the genes and reduces the number of chromosomes, and fertilization, which restores the chromosome to a complete diploid number. In between these two processes, different types of plants and algae vary, but many of them, including all land plants, undergo alternation of generations, with two different multicellularis haploid, containing a single set of chromosomes in each cell. The gametophyte produces male or female gametes (or both), by a process of cell division, called mitosis. In vascular plants with separate gametophytes, female gametophytes are known as mega gametophytes (mega=large, they produce the large egg cells) and the male gametophytes are called micro gametophytes (micro=small, they produce the small sperm cells). The fusion of male and female gametes (fertilization) produces a diploid zygote, which develops by mitotic cell divisions into a multicellular sporophyte. The mature sporophyte produces spores by meiosis, sometimes referred to as \\"reduction division\\" because the chromosome pairs are separated once again to form single sets. In mosses and liverworts, the gametophyte is relatively large, and the sporophyte is a much smaller structure that is never separated from the gametophyte. In ferns, gymnosperms, and flowering plants (angiosperms), the gametophytes are relatively small and the sporophyte is much larger. In gymnosperms and flowering plants the megagametophyte is contained within the ovule (that may develop into a seed) and the micro gametophyte is contained within a pollen grain. It is known as fertilization.  History of sexual reproduction of plants  Unlike animals, plants are immobile, and cannot seek out sexual partners for reproduction. In the evolution of early plants, abiotic means, including water and wind, transported sperm for reproduction. The first plants were aquatic, as described in the page \\"Evolutionary history of plants\\", and released sperm freely into the water to be carried with the currents. Primitive land plants like liverworts and mosses had motile sperm that swam in a thin film of water or were splashed in water droplets from the male reproduction organs onto the female organs. As taller and more complex plants evolved, modifications in the alternation of generations evolved; in the Paleozoic era progymnosperms reproduced by using spores dispersed on the wind. The seed plants including seed ferns, conifers and cordaites, which were all gymnosperms, evolved 350 million years ago; they had pollen grains that contained the male gametes for protection of the sperm during the process of transfer from the male to female parts. It is believed that insects fed on the pollen, and plants thus evolved to use insects to actively carry pollen from one plant to the next. Seed producing plants, which include the angiosperms and the gymnosperms, have a heteromorphic alternation of generations with large sporophytes containing much-reduced gametophytes. Angiosperms have distinctive reproductive organs called flowers, with carpels, and the female gametophyte is greatly reduced to a female embryo sac, with as few as eight cells. The male gametophyte consists of the pollen grains. The sperm of seed plants are non-motile, except for two older groups of plants, the Cycadophyta and the Ginkgophyta, which have flagellated sperm. = Flowering plants = Flowering plants are the dominant plant form on land and they reproduce by sexual and asexual means. Often their most distinguishing feature is their reproductive organs, commonly called flowers. Sexual reproduction in flowering plants involves the production of male and female gametes, the transfer of the male gametes to the female ovules in a process called pollination. After pollination occurs, fertilization happens and the ovules grow into seeds within a fruit. After the seeds are ready to for dispersal, the fruit ripens and by various means, the seeds are freed from the fruit and after varying amounts of time and under specific conditions the seeds germinate and grow into the next generation. The anther produces male gametophytes which are pollen grains, which attach to the stigma on top of a carpel, in which the female gametophytes (inside ovules) are located. After the pollen tube grows through the carpel's style, the sperm from the pollen grain migrates into the ovule to fertilize the egg cell and central cell within the female gametophyte in a process termed double fertilization. The resulting zygote develops into an embryo, while the triploid endosperm (one sperm cell plus a binucleate female cell) and female tissues of the ovule give rise to the surrounding tissues in the developing seed. The ovary, which produced the female gametophyte(s), then grows into a fruit, which surrounds the seed(s). Plants may either self-pollinate or cross- pollinate.  Pollination  An orchid flower In plants that use insects or other animals to move pollen from one flower to the next, plants have developed greatly modified flower parts to attract pollinators and to facilitate the movement of pollen from one flower to the insect and from the insect back to the next flower. Flowers of wind-pollinated plants tend to lack petals and or sepals; typically large amounts of pollen are produced and pollination often occurs early in the growing season before leaves can interfere with the dispersal of the pollen. Many trees and all grasses and sedges are wind-pollinated, as such they have no need for any flowers. Plants have a number of different means to attract pollinators including color, scent, heat, nectar glands, edible pollen and flower shape. Along with modifications involving the above structures two other conditions play a very important role in the sexual reproduction of flowering plants, the first is the timing of flowering and the other is the size or number of flowers produced. Often plant species have a few large, very showy flowers while others produce many small flowers, often flowers are collected together into large inflorescences to maximize their visual effect, becoming more noticeable to passing pollinators. Flowers are attraction strategies and sexual expressions are functional strategies used to produce the next generation of plants, with pollinators and plants having co-evolved, often to some extraordinary degrees, very often rendering mutual benefit. Flower heads showing disk and ray florets. The largest family of flowering plants is the orchids (Orchidaceae), estimated by some specialists to include up to 35,000 species,Orchidaceae in Flora of North America @ efloras.org which often have highly specialized flowers that attract particular insects for pollination. The stamens are modified to produce pollen in clusters called pollinia, which become attached to insects that crawl into the flower. The flower shapes may force insects to pass by the pollen, which is \\"glued\\" to the insect. Some orchids are even more highly specialized, with flower shapes that mimic the shape of insects to attract them to attempt to 'mate' with the flowers, a few even have scents that mimic insect pheromones. Another large group of flowering plants is the Asteraceae or sunflower family with close to 22,000 species,Asteraceae in Flora of North America @ efloras.org which also have highly modified inflorescences that are flowers collected together in heads composed of a composite of individual flowers called florets. Heads with florets of one sex, when the flowers are pistillate or functionally staminate or made up of all bisexual florets, are called homogamous and can include discoid and liguliflorous type heads. Some radiate heads may be homogamous too. Plants with heads that have florets of two or more sexual forms are called heterogamous and include radiate and disciform head forms, though some radiate heads may be heterogamous too. = Ferns = Ferns typically produce large diploids with stem, roots, and leaves; and on fertile leaves called sporangium, spores are produced. The spores are released and germinate to produce short, thin gametophytes that are typically heart-shaped, small and green in color. The gametophytes or thallus, produce both motile sperm in the antheridia and egg cells in separate archegonia. After rains or when dew deposits a film of water, the motile sperm are splashed away from the antheridia, which are normally produced on the top side of the thallus, and swim in the film of water to the antheridia where they fertilize the egg. To promote out crossing or cross-fertilization the sperm is released before the eggs are receptive of the sperm, making it more likely that the sperm will fertilize the eggs of the different thallus. A zygote is formed after fertilization, which grows into a new sporophytic plant. The condition of having separate sporophyte and gametophyte plants is called alternation of the generations. Other plants with similar reproductive means include the Psilotum, Lycopodium, Selaginella and Equisetum. = Bryophytes = The bryophytes, which include liverworts, hornworts and mosses, reproduce both sexually and vegetatively. The gametophyte is the most commonly known phase of the plant. All are small plants found growing in moist locations and like ferns, have motile sperm with flagella and need water to facilitate sexual reproduction. These plants start as a haploid spore that grows into the dominant form, which is a multicellular haploid body with leaf-like structures that photosynthesize. Haploid gametes are produced in antheridia and archegonia by mitosis. The sperm released from the antheridia respond to chemicals released by ripe archegonia and swim to them in a film of water and fertilize the egg cells, thus producing zygotes that are diploid. The zygote divides by mitotic division and grows into a sporophyte that is diploid. The multicellular diploid sporophyte produces structures called spore capsules. The spore capsules produce spores by meiosis, and when ripe, the capsules burst open and the spores are released. Bryophytes show considerable variation in their breeding structures and the above is a basic outline. In some species each gametophyte is one sex while other species produce both antheridia and archegonia on the same gametophyte which is thus hermaphrodite.Lovett Doust, Jon, and Lesley Lovett Doust. 1988.

South Carolina Coastal Council, 505 U.S. 1003 (1992), was a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States established the \\"total takings\\" test for evaluating whether a particular regulatory action constitutes a regulatory taking that requires compensation.. Background ;Plaintiff/Petitioner : David H. Lucas, owner of two beachfront properties in Isle of Palms, South Carolina. ;Defendant/Respondent : South Carolina Coastal Council, a body that grants permits for the use of beachfront land. =State of law= South Carolina's Coastal Zone Management Act (1977) required owners of coast land in \\"critical areas\\" near beaches to obtain permits from Respondent South Carolina Coastal Council before committing the land to new uses. The state's Beachfront Management Act (1988), S.C. Code Ann. ¬ß 48-39-10 et seq. (1989 Cum. Supp.), increased the regulations on the use of coastal land. =Facts of case= Petitioner Lucas purchased beachfront properties in 1986 for $975,000. David H. Lucas owned two vacant oceanfront lots in the Beachwood East Subdivision of the Wild Dunes development on the Isle of Palms in Charleston County, South Carolina. The Beachfront Management Act effectively prevented Petitioner Lucas from erecting homes on properties due to the effects it will have on the public beach. =Prior history= Lucas filed suit asserting that the restrictions on the use of his lots was a taking of his property without just compensation. The lower court agreed and awarded Lucas $1,232,387.50 as just compensation for the regulatory taking. The government of South Carolina appealed, and the Supreme Court of South Carolina reversed.Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council, 304 S.C. 376, 404 S.E.2d 895 (1991). =Procedural posture= Petitioner Lucas seeks reversal of the South Carolina Supreme Court judgment, reinstatement of the trial court judgment, and declaration that the Beachfront Management Act constituted a taking. Supreme Court Review =Issue= Whether the South Carolina Supreme Court erred in holding that the Beachfront Management Act was a valid exercise of the police power and did not constitute a taking. =Arguments/theories= ;Petitioner : Not stated, presumed reflected in holding and reasoning. ;Respondent : (1) The Beachfront Management Act is a valid exercise of the police power, as the beach/dune area of the shores is a valuable public resource, and the erection of structures on that land contributes to erosion and destruction of that resource. (2) All property is held subject to the limitation that the state may regulate the property in such a way as to remove all value. =Rule of law= A regulation that deprives an owner of all economically beneficial uses of land constitutes a taking unless the proscribed use interests were not part of the title to begin with. In other words, a law or decree with the effect of depriving all economically beneficial use must do no more than duplicate the result that could have been achieved in the courts under the law of nuisance. As a result, \\"total takings\\" analysis requires a consideration of (1) the degree of harm to public lands or adjacent property posed by the regulated activities, (2) the social value of such activities, and (3) the relative ease with which the alleged harms can be avoided through measures taken by either the claimant or the government. =Opinion of the Court= In a majority opinion by Justice Antonin Scalia, the Court found that the South Carolina Supreme Court erred in holding that the Beachfront Management Act was a valid exercise of the police power and did not constitute a taking. Reasoning The majority argued as follows: (1) Deprivation of all economically beneficial use is, from the perspective of a property owner, deprivation of the property itself. (2) When all economically beneficial use is restricted, it is difficult to assume that the legislature is simply \\"adjusting\\" economical benefits and burdens. (3) Regulations that restrict all economically beneficial use may often be a guise of pressing that land into public service. (4) Lucas's lands have been deprived of all economically beneficial use. (5) There is no way to distinguish regulation that \\"prevents a harmful use\\" and confers benefits on nearby property. (6) Contrary to Respondent South Carolina's assertion, title is not held subject to the limitation that the state may regulate away all the property's economically beneficial use. =Kennedy's Concurrence= ;Kennedy, J., concurring. : The determination of no value must be considered with reference to the owner's reasonable, investment-backed expectations. Justice Kennedy also expressed concern with the idea that state regulation could go no further than duplicating the common law of nuisance without exposing itself to the challenge of categorical taking, as some fragile lands might prevent such public concern that the state can go further in regulating development than the common law of nuisance might otherwise permit.Ruhl J B et al (2007) Law and Policy of Ecosystem Services. Island Press, Washington DC =Dissents= ;Blackmun, J., dissenting. :The court should not have granted certiorari to hear this case and it ignores its jurisdictional limits, remakes its traditional rules of review and created simultaneously a new categorical rule and an exception. There could never be a total loss because the owner can still enjoy other attributes of ownership such as right to exclude others, picnic, swim, camp in a tent or live on the property in a movable trailer ;Stevens, J., dissenting. :The categorical rule created by the court is unsound and an unwise addition to the law of takings. In the past the court had worked at rejecting an absolute formula for determining a taking and have frequently in the past held a law that renders property valueless may not constitute a taking. The new rule created by the court is arbitrary because a landowner whose property is diminished in value 95% recovers nothing while an owner whose property is diminished 100% recovers the land‚Äôs full value. =Souter's statement= In an unusual filing, Justice Souter, a former state supreme court justice (in New Hampshire), wrote a statement in which he neither joined the majority or dissented and said the case should be dismissed on procedural grounds. He wrote, \\"The case should have been dismissed as improperly granted, as the decision of the trial court that a total taking had occurred is highly questionable on the basis of the facts presented\\" because \\"The petition for review was granted on the assumption that the state [of South Carolina], by regulation, had deprived the owner of his entire economic interest in the subject property. Such was the state trial court's conclusion, which the state supreme court did not review.\\" Result =Judgment/disposition= Judgment reversed and cause remanded for determination of whether regulation could be enacted under state nuisance law. =Subsequent history= On remand at the South Carolina Supreme Court, the court granted the parties leave to amend their pleadings to determine what the actual damages were.Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council, 309 S.C. 424, 424 S.E.2d 484 (1992) =Legacy and other notes= Established the modern \\"total takings\\" test. After paying Lucas $850,000 in compensation for the two lots, South Carolina proceeded to sell the lots to private parties for development. A 5,000-square-foot private home now sits on one lot, while the other remains undeveloped.

It is the largest electrical bike manufacturer in Europe. History Sparta was founded in 1917, and has been producing bicycles ever since. Highlights of Sparta's history are the company becoming the biggest Dutch manufacturer of motorcycles after the Second World War, and becoming the biggest Dutch manufacturer of mopeds in the 1970s. In the current age Sparta is known for the production of E-bikes. History of Sparta (Sparta.nl) =Founding= During World War I three men in the neutral Netherlands founded what would become the biggest moped manufacturer of the Netherlands. The gentlemen Schakel, Verbeek and Krijgsman opened their wholesale named Verbeek & Schakel in the Hoofdstraat (Main street) of Apeldoorn. Later that same year they bought the brands Sparta, Romein (Roman) and Vaandel (Ensign). These brands were used for the cycles they sold. Krijgsman quit the company in 1918. =1920s= The 1920s meant rapid development for Sparta: Leendert Schakel became head of the company after buying full ownership from all other shareholders, leaving him and Verbeek as the owners. In 1920, Sparta produced its first self-built cycle. The year after which the company started working on cargo bikes, which, in the beginning were powered manually. Later in the 1920s the company equipped their cargo bikes with engines. In 1925 Verbeek's share of the company was bought by Schakel, who had great ideas for the company. Two years later, in 1927, he bought land on the Waterloseweg in Apeldoorn, where he built a factory for the production of bicycles, milk carts, transport- and cargo bikes. =1930s= The 1930s company, then called Sparta Rijwielen- en Motorenfabriek, Firma Verbeek & Schakel, started producing motorised vehicles. Technics were a big passion of Schakel, so the change from bicycle to motorcycle was a logical one. The first motorised vehicle to leave the factory was equipped with a 78cc Sachs engine. Its development started in 1931. Sparta was still active on the bicycle market. In a brochure printed in 1936 were, aside of four regular bikes for men and women, adverts for a kids bicycle, a cargo bike, a butcher's bike (baker's bike), a tandem and a service bike. All of these had over fifteen different styles and modifications, several of which had the option of being equipped with an engine. The offer in motorcycles also was enlarged. In the 30s, Sparta produced several models equipped with engines made by Villiers, Sachs and , all of which were 120 or 125 cc. Sparta wanted to make sure that its vehicles didn't weigh over sixty kilos (132 lbs), which made it to where a Dutch consumer didn't have to pay taxes over the vehicle. =1940s= As a result of the Second World War production was halted in 1943, after which the company had to be rebuilt, to resume productions in 1945. Producing vehicles, however, wasn't easy for Sparta, as there was a scarcity in metals. Schakel, who still was head of the company, saw a broad future in the motorcycles. The limitation to 60 kilos, which Sparta limited itself to, was discarded. By 1949 the company had managed to attract designer Jan Wilke to join the company. Wilke gave the motorcycles a telescopic front fork, new frame, and along with that a fresh, new and typical look. By 1950 Sparta achieved the typical look for its post-war motorcycles, consisting of a large fuel tank and integrated storage for tools. Along with that, Sparta equipped motorcycles with new engines produced by Villers. From there on, Sparta grew to become the biggest moped manufacturer of the Netherlands. =1950s= Sparta GB50 (1958) In the 1950s Sparta played a huge role in filling the demand for motorised bicycles. The name had been changed once again, this time dropping the names of the two main founders, leaving the name to be Sparta Rijwielen- en Motorenfabriek. From the fifties on Sparta expanded their offer in motorised vehicles, offering not only motorcycles but also mopeds. In 1958 Sparta halted the production of motorcycles, as it wasn't profitable any longer. Instead, the moped was starting to grow more and more popular. This change made the company focus entirely on mopeds. Export to other European countries and other countries such as Indonesia, Tahiti, Africa and North America created large profits for the company. Being the biggest Dutch moped manufacturer, Sparta had many product lines, which all sold in high quantities. M-Series One of the more popular mopeds by Sparta was the MA 50. The moped was often referred to as verpleegstersbrommer (nurse moped), as the model was mostly used by nurses. The first MA50 was produced and sold in 1958. The 1959 version of the MA50 got a facelift, and was sold as the MB50. The last newly built M-Series moped was sold in 1962, after having had another facelift, now going by the name of MC50. =1960s= 1965 was the best year of Sparta's moped sales. Around 47,000 mopeds were sold that year, all of which were produced by the mere 380 people working in the Sparta factory. In 1967 chose to start producing bicycles again, which ended up to be a clever decision, as eight years later, in 1975 the helmplicht, Artikel 60 RVV (Helmplicht) as of 1990 (Dutch Government)(overheid.nl) which stated that everyone that drove a moped had to wear a helmet, was introduced in the Netherlands; the country which still had the most customers of Sparta mopeds. Sparta would continue producing mopeds up to and including 1982, when it started to focus on bicycles only. In the 1960s Sparta introduces the bike with tube frame, the plans of which took two years to design. The model name 8-80 was chosen to reflect the age of the target audience. =1970s= Boy driving a Sparta Lucky (1973, photo of 2016) By 1973 Sparta was back on the bike market with its own Sparta-frame. The idea of which was a single frame with one tube going from the steering head to rear brake. This frame would be used in bikes for roughly twenty years, no matter what person the bike would be meant for, man, woman or kid, their bikes would have similar frames. The bikes were sold by Sparta itself, and through grey routes. This meant that companies would sell Sparta bikes under their own brand without mentioning the company that originally created the bicycle. Examples of these were Wellington, Halfords, Resident and Tomos. Even nowadays these bikes can be found in almost every Dutch bike rack. The sales in Denmark grew in large amounts around this time, where Sparta sold bicycles under the name Skandsen. Sparta stuck to its own name when selling in other countries, including Germany and Belgium. The many sales of the company made it re-establish its place on the bicycle market. =1980s= Sparta sold its last moped in 1982, as the market for mopeds had not been profitable for several years. The production of motorcycles was halted twenty-two years earlier, in 1960, yet the idea of motorised vehicles hadn't completely left Sparta's mentality. Sparta gave motorising bicycles a last shot, which meant a cooperation with German motorcycle manufacturer Sachs. Together they manufactured the Spartamet, a bicycle with auxiliary motor. The Spartamet entered the market in 1986, and turned out to be a massive success. By 1990 20,000 of the 105,000 bicycles sold were a Spartamet. The Spartamet made Sparta to be the only Dutch manufacturer of mopeds with auxiliary motors. Competitors did try to create rivals of the Spartamet, but their products never stuck with the public. Ties with Sachs increased in the following years. Sparta used increasingly more of their products on its bicycles. One of these products were Sachs' coaster brakes, which were traditionally manufactured by Sturmey-Archer. Sparta became the Dutch importer of ATB and racing bicycles made by Sachs' subsidiary company Hercules by late 1989. =1990s= In September 1999 Sparta stopped the production of the Spartamet, as bicycles with electrical auxiliary motors replaced the need of bicycles such as the Spartamet, which required fuel. Later that same month, on the 28th, Sparta announces that it will be a part of Accell Group, where it will function as a subsidiary company, joining other Dutch bicycle manufacturer Batavus. Sparta, who was dubbed the inventor of the bicycle of electric auxiliary motor on the Dutch market introduced the Pharos- series, which was meant to fill the newly created demand for bicycles with electrical auxiliary motors. The Pahros-series were created using an electrical system developed by Yamaha. In 1999 Sparta started producing recumbent bicycles, which made it the second largest company making recumbent bicycles, with the largest being Batavus. =21st Century= With Sparta joining Accell Group in 1999, several changes were made to the products that Sparta made. It quit manufacturing recumbent bicycles, children's bikes and ATBs, and moved to its current location on Wilmersdorf, Apeldoorn, the Netherlands in the summer of 2001. New products made by Sparta included the Amazone, introduced in 2000, which was a bike aimed at mothers. In 2003 Sparta launched ION, a series of systems for E-bikes. The ION system led Sparta to become the biggest E-bike manufacturer in Europe.

It was proposed by the Kenseit≈ç political party and it was passed by the Diet of Japan on 5 May 1925. Background Meiji period Japan was dominated by the Meiji oligarchy, who viewed popular democracy and party politics with suspicion. However, after the promulgation of the Meiji Constitution, limited suffrage was extended to male property holders, aged over 25 years, who paid more than 15 Yen in annual taxes for elections to the lower house starting in 1890. The number of voters who qualified under this restriction was around 450,000 (roughly 1 percent of the population). Over the next three decades, the number grew to around 3,000,000. Many executive and legislative positions in the Japanese government were appointive, rather than elected. Although seats in local, prefecture and the national (lower) assemblies were elected, the House of Peers was composed of both appointed and hereditary members, and prefectural governors were appointed by the central government and answerable only to the Home Ministry (Japan). City mayors were appointed by the prefectural governor, albeit from a list of names supplied by the city elected assembly. Universal Suffrage Movement Almost from the start of elections in Japan, popular movements arose to eliminate the tax- paying requirement, which effectively disenfranchised a large segment of the adult male population. In 1897, the was created to raise public awareness through discussion groups and periodicals. Diet members, mostly from liberal faction within the Diet, supported by the Liberal Party of Japan (Jiyuto) and its offshoots, presented bills to the Diet in 1902, 1903, 1908, 1909 and 1910. The movement finally appeared to succeed in March 1911, when its Universal Suffrage Bill was passed by the lower house only to be summarily rejected by the House of Peers. Increased government hostility towards radical groups broadened in the 1910s, with the implementation of the Peace Preservation Laws and increased censorship and surveillance of suspected radical groups associated with leftist or labor movements. However, the movement for universal suffrage resurfaced in 1918-1919 with demonstrations held by student and labor associations and a sudden upsurge in interest by newspapers and popular journals. The opposition political parties, the Kenseikai and Rikken Kokumint≈ç jumped on the bandwagon, whereas the governmental Rikken Seiy≈´kai still opposed. The liberal parties favored an increase in the popular franchise to keep up with the world trend to democracy and to provide a safety valve for both urban and rural discontent. The more conservative parties, fearing that the increased voter base would favor their liberal opponents, resisted these proposals. In 1924, a Kenseikai alliance with the Seiyukai scored a victory over the non-party government of Kiyoura Keigo. Kenseikai leader Kat≈ç Takaaki became Prime Minister of Japan, and the Seiyukai was forced to accept the Kenseikai proposal on extending universal male suffrage to all male citizens over the age of 25 as the price for the coalition. The bill was passed in 1925, and came into effect for the 20 February 1928 elections. Criticisms The General Election Law was passed only after the Peace Preservation Law was passed. Although more democracy was given, liberty (in terms of freedom of the press, freedom of assembly and freedom of speech) was limited at the same time. With the greatly increased voter base (approximately 12 million voters in 1925, or approximately 20 percent of the total population), the costs for elections rose considerably. Political candidates, in need of greater sources of funding, turned to the zaibatsu and other sponsors who also had vested political interests. In addition, women still did not have the right to vote.

In 1951 the company diversified into building material distribution. Today the company has two main divisions: hardwood lumber manufacturing and wholesale building material distribution. History In 1889 the 25-year-old Edward Vose Babcock, along with his brother Fred R. Babcock, founded E.V. Babcock and Company. For the next eight years, E.V. expanded his company, gaining national attention. In 1897, with the purchase of of land and choice hardwood timber in Ashtola, Somerset County, Pennsylvania, Edward, with the help of his two brothers Fred R. (known as F.R.) and Oscar H. (known as O.H.), incorporated the Babcock Lumber Company on November 11, 1897. This company still operates under that name today. Now approaching the turn of the century, the employees of Babcock and Company rode cable cars to work, paying 5¬¢ in fare. In 1901, of virgin long-leaf Yellow Pine was acquired near Bainbridge, Georgia. After this, Babcock founded and constructed the first completely integrated Yellow Pine plant in Miller County, Georgia. Rift-sawn pine flooring became the specialty of the mill, producing more than twenty-five million board-feet annually. The town of Babcock was established December 14, 1901 around the mill. Following this, the company headquarters was moved to the new Frick Building, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. In 1905, The Babcock Lumber & Boom Co. in Davis, West Virginia began operation and the Tellico River Lumber Co. at Tellico Plains, Tennessee was formed. These plants, along with the Babcock Lumber and Land Company that was formed in 1907 in Maryville, Tennessee, operated more than in the Smokey Mountains of Tennessee and North Carolina. A logging railroad was built from Tellico Plains, Tennessee, up the Tellico River. A high trestle was built over Bald River near Bald River Falls. (The railroad up the Tellico River was converted into today's Tellico River Road.) The forests of the upper Tellico River basin, including its tributaries Bald River and North River, were clearcut. Beginning in 1907, Babcock's operations out of Davis began clear cutting the mountain ridges throughout Tucker County, West Virginia. This clear cutting, with its residual slashings, converted the landscape into a \\"tinderbox\\". By 1910, fires burned continuously ‚Äî in some areas for years on end, from spring until the first snows ‚Äî leaving little other than thin mineral soil and bare rock. In 1914, with the county virtually denuded of standing trees, the ground burned continually for 6 months. As a result, top soils that once produced huge timbers on the mountainside ‚Äî including the largest tree ever harvested in West Virginia, a white oak some 13 feet in diameter just 10 feet from the ground ‚Äî washed down into the narrow valleys and bottom lands, which had always been too narrow for harvesting productive crops or livestock. Uncontrollable soil erosion and flooding further degraded and depopulated the region. To this day, Tucker County and surrounding regions bear the scars of this remarkable conflagration.Brooks, Maurice (1965), The Appalachians (Series: The Naturalist's America), Illustrated by Lois Darling and Lo Brooks, Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company, pp 127-128. By 1933, most of Babcock's Tellico River land was sold to the United States Forest Service or deeded to the United States Government. This land became a major share of both the Great Smokey National Park and the Cherokee National Forest. With the simultaneous operation of these mills, Babcock Lumber Company was producing and shipping more than 1,000 carloads of hardwood per month. Inevitably, however, the company's timber resources began to diminish and the era of marketing its own production began to wane. Before the mills could fade entirely, the Babcock Lumber Company looked to new sources of income and new fields of operation. Babcock decided to utilize his trained salesmen and distribution resources of his company to shift its attention to the sale and distribution of products from other manufacturers In 1948, E.V. died at the age of eighty-five, leaving his company to his son, Fred Courtney Babcock. Between 1951 and 1960, Babcock Lumber Company purchased two of its competitors, as well as built two more distributional warehouses to keep up with demand. In 1963, E.V.'s grandson, Gordon Fisher III became President of the company, and Fred became Chairman of the Board. Between 1965 and 1970, one additional company was purchased, and one more distributional yard was established. The company continued to open new yards and expand to new territories, achieving consistent growth. Wood Varieties Softwood sales include White Fir from California and Oregon; Yellow Pine, Ponderosa Pine, Idaho Pine, and Spruce from Western and Eastern Canada; Redwood from California; and Cedar shingles and Pine mouldings. Hardwoods include woods such as African Teak from Ghana and the Ivory Coast; domestic Ash, Basswood, Cherry, Red Oak, White Oak, Poplar, Cedar, Cypress, Chestnut, Walnut, and Willow; along with African Mahogany and Mahogany from both Honduras and the Philippines; plus African Walnut, Rosewood from Brazil, and Teak from Thailand.

Located midway up the Santa Maria Valley, it is known for growing Burgundian and Rhone varieties of wine grapes. Bien Nacido has the distinction of being one of the major viticultural nurseries in the state for certified, varietal budwood. Most of the vines were originally from stock grown by the University of California at Davis. While the average increase block in California is less than , Bien Nacido Vineyards has several hundred acres of certified Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, Merlot and a number of other varieties. Much of the Chardonnay planted in California in the last twenty years began as Bien Nacido Vineyards cuttings. Bien Nacido Vineyards produces an estate wine program run by Trey Fletcher. The focus of the estate program is to showcase specific, small blocks of the larger vineyard, in a very holistic approach. The winery produces around 1400 cases annually of Pinot Noir, Syrah and Chardonnay. Additionally, a small portion of wine is made exclusively from he famous X Block, Old Vines and from a monopole block called The Captain. Additionally there are two independent winemakers who make their wine on the vineyard, Bob Lindquist of Qupe Winery and Jim Clendenen of Au Bon Climat. History The vineyard traces its roots back to 1837, when Tomas Olivera received the two square league Rancho Tepusquet Mexican land grant from then Governor of Alta California, Juan Bautista Alvarado. The grant covered nearly ranging upward to the San Rafael Mountains from the Santa Maria Mesa, which bordered the Sisquoc and Cuyama Rivers. The ranch was generously watered by Tepusquet Creek, so called by the Chumash Indians to whom it meant \\"fishing for trout.\\" Thomas Olivera sold Rancho Tepusquet in 1855 to his step daughter, Mar√≠a Martina Osuna and son-in-law Juan Pacifico Ontiveros. Juan Pacifico Ontiveros started construction on an adobe in 1857 and moved to the ranch the following year. He and his wife raised horses, cattle, sheep, several grain crops, and grapes for the production of wine. During subsequent years, his heirs divided the property until only about remained surrounding the Ontiveros Adobe. In 1969, the Millers, a branch of the Broome family which has farmed Rancho Guadalasca since 1871, purchased the property. They also purchased an adjacent parcel which had been part of the original land grant, and reunited the two as Rancho Tepusquet, now comprising over . While the ranch itself had always been called \\"Rancho Tepusquet\\", the Millers selected the name \\"Bien Nacido Vineyards of Rancho Tepusquet\\" for the vineyard operation. In 2010, the California State Fair named Bien Nacido Vineyards the Vineyard of the Year.http://www.santamariatimes.com/lifestyles/food-and- cooking/article_367bf80e-96de-11df-b576-001cc4c03286.html Soil and climate Located on the receiving end of the east-west transverse mountain range, Bien Nacido Vineyards is a maritime-influenced desert. The morning fog cover and the cool afternoon breezes from the Pacific Ocean make this a Region 1 climate on the Winkler Scale. The rainfall averages 12 ‚Äì 14 inches a year. The terrain is sand, chalk and marine loam that provides good drainage. The whole package results in cool, slow ripening grapes, with longer hangtime on the vines. Vineyards Bien Nacido Vineyards consists of over of planted vines, of which over are planted to Chardonnay, over to Pinot Noir, a variety associated with the appellation, and a number of acres each to Pinot Blanc, Syrah, and Merlot. Since 1992, experimental plantings of Pinot Gris, Barbera, Roussanne, Nebbiolo and Viognier, as well as new clones of Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, Syrah, and Merlot, have been added. Bien Nacido has the distinction of being one of the major viticultural nurseries in the state for certified, varietal budwood. Most of the vines were originally from stock grown by the University of California at Davis. While the average increase block in California is less than , Bien Nacido Vineyards has several hundred acres of certified Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, Merlot and a number of other varieties. Much of the Chardonnay planted in California in the last twenty years began as Bien Nacido Vineyards cuttings. The Syrah cuttings also have gained a reputation to the point that some vineyards will refer to their plants as stemming from the Bien Nacido clone. Viticulture practices Each customer's portion of a block is farmed according to their standards, such as organic or biodynamic farming techniques. The grape production is sold to customers by charging a flat rate for the area or rows, so the winemakers can crop their vines to volume they desire. This is in contrast to the industry standard which is to sell by the ton. The typical industry approach creates an adversarial relationship in which the vineyard is advantaged to hang more fruit on the vine, whereas the artisan winemakers want to crop it down and let the fruit hang longer (which further dehydrates and shrinks the tonnage). Some of Bien Nacido customers have bought the same rows of grapes for over 20 years and will even designate their particular block on the bottle.  Estate Wines  A small amount of wine is created from select parcels of Bien Nacido Vineyard for the Estate program. The focus for this program is to highlight the portions of the vineyard which consistently create the spice, acidity and power of Bien Nacido Vineyard. These blocks encompass small microclimates of the over 900 acre vineyard site. Each portion of the vineyard is farmed according to vintners' specifications. The Estate Chardonnay comes from Block W, planted in 1973 and without grafting. The W Block is one of the more sought after portions of Bien Nacido due to its inherent nature to provide bright fruit flavors that border on tropical, while maintaining a fresh balanced acidity. The Estate Pinot Noir comes from 6 different blocks of the vineyard, including the Old Vine block of G, N and Q. Additionally Block 1, Block 40 and San Vicente all come together in small harvests to create the rich fruit profile and the herbal spice Bien Nacido Pinot Noir is known for. The Estate Syrah comes from one portion of high elevation on Block Z. This block is famous for being the first block Sine Qua Non ever purchased fruit from, for their now famous \\"cult\\" wines. This portion of vineyard is co-planted alongside Viognier and is harvested in two separate picks in order to separate the warmer south side, from the cooler north side fruit. The smallest production wines, called _The Pillars_ , are selections of Bien Nacido which are the most consistently impressive blocks, since the vineyard was planted in 1973. Block X, which is known as the first \\"cool-climate Syrah planted in California\\" generally has no more than 4 customers per vintage. The Estate makes less than 90 cases on average per vintage from this Block X. The Old Vines, are rows from Block N and Q and harvested in two separate picks. These vines were never affected by the vine louse phylloxera and are considered to be some of the oldest Pinot Noir planted on their own roots in California. The separate picks are in order to harvest the slope portion of the vineyard and the flatter portions, in order to maintain a consistent ripeness. The Old Vines are never produced in more than 100 cases annually. The Captain is the highest portion of Bien Nacido Vineyard, and is considered a monopole block. While all other portions of Bien Nacido Vineyard are custom farmed and offered for sale to wineries on an annual basis; the entire portion of Block 40, is used for The Captain. In the 2014 vintage, The Captain received the second highest score for any wine in Santa Barbara (97 Points) by famed wine Critic Antonio Galloni on his website vinous.com  Notable Persons  Bien Nacido and their sister estate Solomon Hills employs acclaimed winemaker Trey Fletcher as winemaker.

It is the fifth and last of Dickens's Christmas novellas. The story is more about the spirit of the holidays than about the holidays themselves, harking back to the first in the series, A Christmas Carol. The tale centres on a Professor Redlaw and those close to him.  Plot summary  Scene from The Haunted Man at the Adelphi Theatre, in the Illustrated London News, December 30, 1848. Redlaw is a teacher of chemistry who often broods over wrongs done him and grief from his past. He is haunted by a spirit, who is not so much a ghost as Redlaw's phantom twin and is \\"an awful likeness of himself...with his features, and his bright eyes, and his grizzled hair, and dressed in the gloomy shadow of his dress...\\" This spectre appears and proposes to Redlaw that he can allow him to \\"forget the sorrow, wrong, and trouble you have known...to cancel their remembrance...\\" Redlaw is hesitant at first, but finally agrees. As a consequence of the ghost's intervention, Redlaw is without memories of the painful incidents from his past. He experiences a universal anger that he cannot explain. His bitterness spreads to the Swidgers, the Tetterbys and his student. All become as wrathful as Redlaw himself. The only one who is able to avoid the bitterness is Milly. With this realization, the novel concludes with everyone back to normal and Redlaw, like Ebenezer Scrooge, a changed, more loving man. Now a whole person, Redlaw learns to be humble at Christmas.  Performances  In what would be the first public performance of the technique known as Pepper's ghost, John Henry Pepper staged a Christmas Eve production of the play in 1862 at the Royal Polytechnic Institution (currently known as the University of Westminster) in 309 Regent Street. It was very well received, if only for the new apparatus's ability to project a ghost so as to look as though it is interacting with those on stage.

It belongs to the species Coffea liberica. The term is also used to refer to all coffee coming from those provinces. Barako in the languages of the Philippines means \\"stud\\", and is associated with the image of masculinity. Barako has a strong flavor and fragrance reminiscent of aniseed. Barako trees are some of the largest commercially cultivated coffee trees, which make them more difficult to grow. They are considered endangered due to low production and demand. It is listed in the Ark of Taste international catalogue of endangered heritage foods by the Slow Food movement. Etymology Barako in Philippine languages is equivalent to the English term \\"stud\\" (both literally and figuratively), from Spanish varraco, \\"wild boar\\" (baboy ramo in Tagalog). The word is associated with connotations of masculinity and machismo in Filipino culture.http://dle.rae.es/?id=bOQrBo3 History Barako coffee was introduced to the Philippines in the 1740s by Spanish friars. It was originally planted in the lowlands of Lipa, Batangas. From there it spread to other areas in the province, and Batangas became known for its coffee locally. Barako was also historically exported from the 1860s onwards to San Francisco in the United States and to parts of Europe, commanding prices of five times the prices of other Asian coffee beans. In 1876, barako cultivation spread to the neighboring province of Cavite. The Philippines became one of the top four producers of coffee in the world in the 1880s, after coffee rust devastated plantations worldwide. However, in 1889, the coffee industry in the Philippines also collapsed after coffee rust spread to the islands. This caused most farmers to shift to other crops. Only a few barako seedlings survived, most of which were now in Cavite. In the mid-20th century, coffee demand once again surged, but barako didn't make a comeback because of the difficulty of cultivating it in comparison to other coffee varieties. Instead the new surge in coffee production focused on coffee rust-resistant cultivars imported from the United States.  Description  Liberica beans from Mindoro, Philippines The shape of the liberica beans is unique among other commercial species (arabica, robusta, and excelsa). It is asymmetric, with one side shorter than the other side, creating characteristic \\"hook\\" at the tip. The central furrow is also more jagged in comparison to other coffee beans. Barako trees are very tall, reaching up to high. They are harvested using ladders. The size of the cherries, the beans, and the leaves of barako are also among the largest of all coffee varieties. Its taste is said to be superior to Robusta, and most Philippine coffee drinkers prefer barako to Arabica. Arabica‚Äìvarraco and excelsa‚Äìvarraco blends are popular and create a cup with broader flavor range. It has a distinctive flavor and a strong fragrance reminiscent of aniseed. Cultivation and conservation Barako only accounts for less than 2% of commercial coffee grown. It is abundant in the Philippines. It is rarely exported, as most production come from small farms. It is sold to the local and tourist market. It is also produced in Malaysia. The large sizes of barako trees make it less efficient for production and harvesting than other coffee varieties, causing most modern farmers to shy away from it and grow robusta cultivars instead. However, there is recent interest in reviving and conserving barako, including increasing preference for it in local coffee shops in the Philippines. Barako coffee is listed in the Ark of Taste international catalogue of endangered heritage foods by the Slow Food movement. Preparation Barako coffee is prepared using a drip brewing device, French press, or by simply pouring hot water unto the grounds and filtering the mixture using a piece of cloth. Barako is traditionally prepared black or sweetened with muscovado sugar. Barako can be used to make espresso and other espresso-based drinks.  Cocktails  Barako coffee or Liberica Coffee has recently been seen imported and sold in Canada and incorporated into various common espresso based cocktails such as a liberica espresso martinis. Other uses Aside from being a beverage, kapeng barako is also used as a body scrub in spa treatment. Batangue√±os use kapeng barako as an alternative to soup as part of the rice dish. It is usually used when eating tapa or any dry/fried dish. Kapeng barako from Batangas is now gaining popularity among consumers, mainly for its unique, authentic and traditional appeal.

He is currently the head football coach at Oklahoma State University. Gundy played college football at Oklahoma State, where he played quarterback from 1986 to 1989. He became Oklahoma State's coach on January 3, 2005. Playing career At Midwest City High School, Gundy played quarterback, and was voted Oklahoma Player of the Year in 1986. His high school football coach was Dick Evans. Gundy was heavily recruited by the Oklahoma Sooners but in the end signed with the Oklahoma State University Cowboys. He became the starting quarterback midway through his freshman year. Gundy would become the all-time leading passer in Oklahoma State and Big Eight Conference history. In four seasons Gundy threw 49 touchdowns and 7,997 yards, including 2,106 yards in 1987 and 2,163 in 1988. He led the Cowboys to bowl wins in the 1987 Sun Bowl and 1988 Holiday Bowl aided by two Hall of Fame running backs: Thurman Thomas and Barry Sanders. He also led OSU to two 10-win seasons. Mike Gundy held the record for most consecutive passes attempted without an interception at the start of a career by a freshman in Division 1 history with 138, until Baylor freshman Robert Griffin III broke it in 2008. Coincidentally, Baylor was playing against Gundy's Oklahoma State team when Griffin surpassed the mark. After the game, Gundy was able to personally congratulate Griffin on the accomplishment. Gundy holds a degree in secondary education with a focus in social studies and graduated in 1990. Coaching career =Early positions= When Gundy graduated, he joined Pat Jones' staff as an assistant coach. He was wide receiver coach in 1990, quarterback coach from 1991‚Äì1993 and offensive coordinator from 1994‚Äì1995. Gundy was quarterbacks coach/passing game coordinator for Baylor during the 1996 season. He was on staff with Larry Fedora at Baylor and would rekindle that relationship when he became head coach at Oklahoma State, bringing Fedora on as his offensive coordinator. After the 1996 season, Gundy moved again, this time to Maryland where he was wide receiver coach and passing game coordinator from 1997‚Äì2000 for the Terps. =Oklahoma State= In 2001, the Oklahoma State University head football coach job became vacant when Bob Simmons resigned and a search produced Les Miles and Mike Gundy as the finalists. Miles was hired as head coach and Gundy was brought aboard as offensive coordinator. The team would go on to three straight bowl games in Miles' last three years as head coach. When Miles left in 2004 to take the LSU job, Gundy was named immediately as Miles' successor and the 22nd head coach at Oklahoma State. Gundy is one of three head football coaches at Oklahoma State to have played for Oklahoma State, along with Jim Lookabaugh and Floyd Gass. Gundy's first season saw the expulsion of eleven players from the team and the Cowboys struggled to a 4‚Äì7 record winning only one Big 12 conference game. In his second season, the Cowboy offense began to click and the Cowboys would finish 7‚Äì6 including a victory over the Alabama Crimson Tide in the Independence Bowl. In 2007, the Cowboys again posted a 6‚Äì6 regular season record and a bowl win over the Indiana Hoosiers in the Insight Bowl. After their second straight bowl appearance, Gundy was rewarded with a contract extension through the 2013 season. Since 2008, Gundy has led the Cowboys to 59 wins, almost 10 wins per season on average. Many people would consider this to be the most successful period in Oklahoma State football history. He has also led the Pokes to twelve-straight bowl seasons, another Cowboy record. 2008 season In 2008, Gundy led the Oklahoma State Cowboys to their best season in 20 years. They were ranked in the top 15 for most of the season. The season ended with an appearance in the Holiday Bowl, where they lost to Oregon. Gundy was rewarded with a new seven-year contract worth $15.7 million. The contract, which extended through the 2015 season, went into effect on January 1, 2009. 2011 season Thus far the high-water mark for Gundy, the Cowboys won the Big 12 championship, the program's first conference championship since 1976 (when they tied as co-champions) and first outright conference championship since 1948. The team featured two-time Biletnikoff Award winner Justin Blackmon and quarterback Brandon Weeden, both first-round draft picks in the 2012 NFL Draft, as well as a defense that led the FBS in turnover margin The team also appeared in the program's only BCS game, defeating Andrew Luck and the Stanford Cardinal 41‚Äì38 in overtime at the 2012 Fiesta Bowl. 2011‚Äìpresent On September 24, Gundy's Cowboys survived a fourth- quarter rally by Texas A&M; to win 30‚Äì29. It was Gundy's 63rd win as head coach of the Cowboys, vaulting him past Jones to become the winningest coach in school history. He has since led Oklahoma State to 10 wins in 2011, 2013, 2015, 2016 and 2017, including an appearance in the 2016 Sugar Bowl‚Äìthe third major-bowl appearance in school history. Gundy has had a hand in eight of Oklahoma State's nine 10-win seasons‚Äìtwo as a player, six as head coach. After the 2019 season, the Cowboys are 2‚Äì13 vs. the Oklahoma Sooners under Gundy as head coach. They won in 2011 and 2014. Gundy has been associated with the series 30 times as a player or a coach.  Coaching tree  Notable assistants under Gundy who have served as NCAA or NFL head coaches: * Larry Fedora: Southern Miss (2008‚Äì2011), North Carolina (2012‚Äì2018) * Tim Beckman: Toledo (2009‚Äì2011), Illinois (2012‚Äì2014) * Dana Holgorsen: West Virginia (2011‚Äì2018), Houston (2019‚Äìpresent) * Todd Monken: Southern Miss (2013‚Äì2015) * Marcus Arroyo: UNLV (2020‚Äìpresent) Controversies =2007 dispute with the media= On September 22, 2007, Gundy made comments that became the subject of a nationwide media controversy and generated a viral video. During a press conference following his team's victory over the Texas Tech Red Raiders, Gundy criticized an article by Jenni Carlson of The Oklahoman. The article contained guesses as to why quarterback Bobby Reid, who had been publicly supported by the coaching staff earlier in the year, was demoted to second-string. Gundy condemned the article as a personal attack on a young player and offered himself as a better target for criticism when he shouted \\"Come after me! I'm a man! I'm forty!\\" Gundy has stated that he does not mind criticizing college athletes' on-field performance but does not appreciate critiquing college athletes otherwise. The Oklahoman sports editor, Mike Sherman, stood by the story. Mike Griffith, president of the Football Writers Association of America, called Gundy's behavior \\"completely inappropriate.\\" CBS Sportsline's Dennis Dodd went further saying, \\"Mike Gundy needs to be reprimanded, definitely suspended, probably fined and maybe fired.\\" OSU athletic director Mike Holder stood behind Gundy, saying that \\"nothing is more important to us than our student-athletes.\\" (paywall) Gundy would later state that the incident was a blessing in disguise, as the image of his strident defense of one of his players had a lasting positive effect on recruiting. He was a man, and 40. =2013 allegations of misconduct= In September 2013, Sports Illustrated published a series of articles as part of an investigation beginning with Les Miles' tenure as head coach at Oklahoma State from 2001 and continuing through Gundy's tenure as head coach in 2011. The allegations concerning Gundy included involvement in a bonus system for players along with direct payments and no-show or sham jobs involving boosters, continuing diminished academic standards including players playing who were otherwise academically ineligible such as having players' school work done by so-called tutors and other school personnel, tolerating widespread drug abuse among the players by continuing a sham drug counseling program and selective drug enforcement, and also purportedly like Miles, personally interviewing hostess candidates for the Orange Pride hostess program and facilitating some hostesses having sex with prospective recruits. In response to the allegations, Gundy stated: \\"I‚Äôm very proud of what we‚Äôve accomplished here, both on and off the field. Our goal has always been to take young people from where their parents have gotten them and to make them better over a four- or five-year period. We‚Äôre very proud of that in many ways. So, until further time‚Äîand obviously the university will make that decision‚Äîthere‚Äôs not any comment that we would have on the Sports Illustrated article.\\" Les Miles generally denied any wrongdoing during his time as head coach at OSU. Following the SI series Oklahoma State conducted an intensive review of practices policies led by Charles Smrt. There were no findings of misconduct of any significance found. One of the authors of the report, Thayer Evans made news for getting caught in a sting Operation at Hobie Point where numerous cases of outraging public decency had occurred. Many current and former players, professors, and supporters have made statements refuting the SI articles. =2020 One America News incident= In June of 2020, star running back Chuba Hubbard threatened to boycott Oklahoma State after Gundy was photographed wearing a t-shirt of One America News, which Gundy has supported in previous statements. Linebacker Amen Ogbongbemiga also threatened to sit in response to the photo. Gundy subsequently issued an apology, saying he was \\"disgusted\\" by OAN's attitude towards the Black Lives Matter movement. Personal life Gundy and his wife, Kristen, have three children, Gavin, Gunnar and Gage. His brother, Cale Gundy, was a starting quarterback at Oklahoma in the 1990s and is currently OU's Assistant Head Coach, Director of Recruiting and Inside Receivers Coach.

United States, 156 U.S. 51 (1895), or Sparf and Hansen v. United States,. was a United States Supreme Court case testing the admissibility of confessions by multiple defendants accused of the same crime, and the responsibility of juries. Background On the night of January 13, 1884, on a voyage to Tahiti, the second mate, a man called Fitzgerald, of the Hesper was found to be missing. It was believed that he had been killed and his body thrown overboard. The ship's captain, Sodergren, suspected three men, the crew members St. Clair, Hansen, and Sparf, of being participants in the murder. Sodergren kept the three suspects in holding until they arrived in Tahiti, where they were taken ashore by the United States consul at that island and were subsequently sent, with others, to San Francisco, on the vessel Tropic Bird. Decision The court issued its decision on January 21, 1895 by a 5-4 vote, with Justice Harlan giving the majority opinion. =Confessions with multiple defendants= The court held that if one of two persons, accused of having together committed the crime of murder, makes a voluntary confession in the presence of the other, without threat or coercion, the confession is admissible in evidence against both. However, declarations of one accomplice after the killing made in the absence of the other implicating the guilt of both are admissible in evidence only against the one making the declarations, not against the other. =Responsibility of juries= Sparf v. United States clarified several questions relating to the duty of federal criminal juries, and of federal courts when instructing them. * It is the duty of a jury to apply the law as given by the court to the facts of a case. * A court may lay out the legal implications following from a set of facts, but it may not direct the jury to return a guilty verdict. * A jury may, on the basis of evidence, convict of a lesser offense whose elements are included in another offense. * In a trial for a person accused of murder, if evidence does not support conviction for a lesser offense, then the court may instruct the jury to consider guilt only for the offenses that have been charged. It is then the duty of the jury to do so. Sparf remains the last direct opinion of the Court on jury nullification. While it does not prohibit juries from disputing the law in a case, it denies them any right to do so.Cohn, Cassia and Craig Hemmens (2012) Courts: A Text/Reader See also * List of United States Supreme Court cases, volume 156 *Jury nullification References External links * * Category:United States Supreme Court cases Category:1895 in United States case law Category:United States Supreme Court cases of the Fuller Court Category:United States jury case law Category:Jury nullification ","title":"Sparf v.

Biography Born Walter Scott Columbus, youngest of four children, two brothers Anthony & Tom and a sister Marilyn. Son of John A. Columbus and Amelia Columbus. He began to play the drums at age 6. Later on, during his 20s, grew up listening to such bands as Led Zeppelin, the Who, Black Sabbath and Cream while he would play in local bands such as Hell Hostage. Columbus was known to be loving and funny, often made jokes and was fun to be around. He was a huge Philadelphia Eagles fan and would often dress up as a football player as a quarterback or running back. At age 25, he was discovered by a female fan of the power metal band Manowar, beating aluminium in a local foundry. Columbus starred on his first album which is known as Manowar's second album Into Glory Ride, made his debut with the band on the Song Warlord. Then starred on several of their upcoming albums such as Hail to England, Sign of the Hammer, Fighting the World and Kings of Metal. He was replaced by Rhino for The Triumph of Steel. Between the years he was out of Manowar, Columbus was in a local band of Gunshy and worked at a horse radish plant. Columbus returned for Manowar's album, Louder than Hell he then remained with the band for the albums Warriors of the World and Gods of War. During the summer of 2008 when he was replaced once again by Rhino during Manowar's performances in Bulgaria and Magic Circle Festival 2008. Columbus stated in his interview he was working on a solo project instrumental but was never released, and was playing with Ross the Boss and a local band PSC. Manowar never officially announced Columbus's departure in 2008. In an interview with Classic Rock magazine, Scott said \\"I'd say it was about April 2008. When Mr. DeMaio [Joey DeMaio, Manowar bassist/frontman] and myself agreed to disagree on a few points of interest. That leads us up to today. You know what? I had a long and wonderful career with Manowar; I have no regrets, it's just life moves on.\\" When asked about his departure in the early 1990s Scott said \\"It was the very end of 1989 leading into 1990. I was officially gone in 1990, the first time. I can just tell you and the world that my son was never sick. So you can deduce from that what you may. However, that's what I'll tell you [concerning the official statement].\\" Columbus played the so- called \\"Drums of Doom\\", a kit made of stainless steel, because his drumming technique was too rough on standard kits which had to be replaced too regularly. Personal life Columbus was married to Kimmy Brett for less than a year. They had one daughter together, Teresa J (Columbus) Burgdorf. In 1981, he was married to Victoria A. Columbus and was together for 17 years with two sons, Scott and Anthony Columbus. Divorced in 1998. Married to Kathy Recupito in 1998, then divorced in 2008. They had one son together, Corey Columbus. Death On April 5, 2011, Manowar's official Facebook, and Manowar's official website, posted the following: > \\"With great sorrow we announce the passing of our brother Scott Columbus. A > rare talent, equally a rare individual, a father, a friend and a brother of > metal. All of the great moments we spent together are burnished in our > hearts and memories forever. We know he is in a good place and at peace. He > will never be forgotten. Your family and brothers, Joey, Eric, Karl, Donnie. > And all at Magic Circle Music\\". On April 5, 2020, Columbus' daughter Teresa publicly announced that her father's cause of death was suicide, and urged for more awareness on mental illness and depression.

Originally named Euclid Senior High School, it was constructed in 1949 to replace the Euclid Central High School and Shore High School facilities. The school serves a community of approximately 49,000 residents, offering a wide range of programs from vocational education to college preparatory. History Euclid High School was established in 1868 and was housed in a facility on School Street. The first high school building was built in 1894 and remained in service until 1913, when two new schools, Shore and Central, were completed. Both schools housed high school students in part of their respective buildings, but neither school was exclusively a high school. The current facility opened in late 1949 as Euclid Senior High School and had 1,850 students in grades 10‚Äì12 during the first school year. The plan for a single high school in Euclid had been the idea of superintendent Russell Erwine as far back as 1930, though plans were not finalized until 1945. The original building was designed in the shape of an \\"E\\", and has had expansions in 1957, 1966, and 1972 as enrollment grew to as many as 3,000 students in three grades between 1965 and 1975. The building includes two swimming pools, two gymnasiums, an indoor track facility, weight rooms, a little theater, auditorium, planetarium, and a fully functional, self-contained library. Curriculum Euclid's vocational programs includes automotive body repair, commercial art and cosmetology. Its technology program offers training in Cisco Systems and computer information systems. A major distinction in Euclid's format was the incorporation of Knowledgeworks Foundation, a school program funded by Microsoft founder Bill Gates. Essentially, the program divides Euclid High into six smaller 'schools'. This includes the School of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math, International Academy of Accelerated Achievement, The Professional Path, Euclid Academy of the Arts, Academy of Intellectual and Interpersonal Development, and Business and Communications School. Each section of the school focuses on its area of concentration. Yet due to enrollment changes in the district, (as report by Euclid Sun journal) these small schools ceased operations in the 2009‚Äì2010 school year, and consolidate back to the single high school concept. In the 1960s, it was one of the regions first to teach computer programming with its own IBM mainframe. Activities Euclid High School activities include: Student Council, class cabinet, Key Club, The Euclidian (yearbook), The Survey (newspaper), The Eucuyo (literary arts journal), fall play, \\"Big Show\\" spring musical, spring play, Choral Masters, Varsity Chorale, choir, marching band, jazz band, orchestra, drill team, academic teams, National Honor Society, audio/visual club, poetry club, ski club, D.A.R.E., S.A.D.D., peer mediation, Future Educators of America, and NJROTC. Euclid High School also sponsors 21 varsity sports: baseball, boys/girls basketball, cheerleading, football, JROTC Raiders, boys/girls soccer, boys/girls tennis, softball, swimming and diving, track and field, cross country, volleyball, wrestling  Athletics  =State championships= * Baseball - 1963, 1982 * Wrestling ‚Äì 1949, 1952, 1958 Notable alumni * Jim Bonfanti, rock drummer co-founder of The Raspberries, had music honored in the Guardians of the Galaxy soundtrack.

He became known as the Shakh (), which is an abbreviation of his most important work, Siftei Kohen () (literally Lips of the Priest) on the Shulchan Aruch. His rulings were considered authoritative by later halakhists.  Biography  Shabbatai HaKohen was born either in Amstibovo or in Vilna, Lithuania in 1621 and died at Holleschau, Moravia on the 1st of Adar, 1662. He first studied with his father and in 1633 he entered the yeshivah of Rabbi Joshua H√∂schel ben Joseph at Tykotzin, moving later to Cracow and Lublin, where he studied under Naphtali Cohen. Tomb of Sabbatai ben Meir ha-Kohen in Hole≈°ov Returning to Vilna, he married the daughter of the wealthy Shimon Wolf, a great-grandson of Moses Isserles, and shortly after was appointed to the Beit Din as one of the assistants of Moses ben Isaac Judah Lima, author of Chelkat Mechokek. In 1655, during fighting between Polish forces and the invading Swedish army in the Northern War, Shabbatai HaKohen fled Vilna with the entire Jewish community. After a short stay at Lublin he went to Prague and later to Str√°≈ænice in Moravia, from where he was called to the rabbinate of Hole≈°ov, where he remained until his death in 1662. While in Hole≈°ov, he gained the friendship of Magister Valentino Wiedreich of Leipzig. The Shakh‚Ä≤s grave in the Jewish cemetery of Hole≈°ov still exists and is visited by people from all over the world. A portion of his descendants have taken the last name Hakohen Rubin, although their reasons for doing so are unknown.https://www.geni.com/people/Shimshon-Katz- Rubin/6000000002079239563?through=6000000000961693759  Works  = The \\"Shakh\\" = In Cracow in 1646, he published his magnum opus, the Siftei Kohen () or the Shakh, () a commentary on the Shulchan Aruch Yoreh De'ah. This work was approved by the greatest Polish and Lithuanian scholars and since 1674 has been published in most editions of the Yoreh De'ah. Shabbatai HaKohen was regarded by his contemporaries as more than usually learned. He frequently contested the decisions of his predecessors, and followed an entirely new path in the interpretation of the Talmudic law. He made light, too, of the decisions of his contemporaries, and thus drew on himself the enmity of some among them, including David ben Shmuel HaLevi, author of Ture Zahav, and Aaron Shmuel Kaidanover, author of Birkhat HaZevach, who was the father-in-law of his brother Yonah Menachem Nachum HaKohen. Nevertheless, Sifsei/Siftei/Sifte Kohen, Shakh's commentary on the Shulchan Aruch, was considered by a majority of Talmudists as of the highest authority, and they applied his decisions to actual cases as the final word of the Law. As a logician he stood, perhaps, first among the Talmudic scholars of his age. = Other writings = In addition to his knowledge of the Talmudic law he was versed in the Kabbala, which he used in explaining various passages of the Bible. His mastery of Hebrew is evidenced by the selichot that he composed in commemoration of the Chmielnicki tragedies. In 1648 the communities of the Polish Kingdom were devastated by Chmielnicki, Shabbatai HaKohen portrayed the persecutions of the Jews in his Megillah Afah.  Shakh Synagogue  A Synagogue in Hole≈°ov is called Shakh Synagogue after Shabbatai HaKohen. It was built in the late 16th century, after the former synagogue had burned down in 1560. In the early 17th century the synagogue was enlarged with a sidehall and a women's gallery. Between 1725 and 1737 the interior was designed in a baroque decoration in the so-called \\"Polish style\\". The synagogue is an isolated plain building. It has a rectangular ground plan. In the eastern side of the main hall is the Aron Kodesh, built in the baroque altar style. In the centre of the hall is the bimah, built as an octagonal platform with a metal railing. Some parts of the walls and the vault are decorated with ornamental paintings with herbal and faunal motifs and Hebrew texts. The sidehall is separated from the main hall by two arcades. On the first floor there is the women's gallery, decorated with liturgical texts, and the second floor was used as a school. Today, the synagogue is a museum; both floors house the exhibition \\"The Jews in Moravia\\".

The school's colors are scarlet and gray. The athletic teams are known as the Warriors. The school fight song is \\"Buckeye\\". The school is a member of the Great Lakes Conference. History of FHS Prior to 1928, there was no high school in Fairview Park. All high school students were sent to West High, West Tech, and later Rocky River High School. When the high school was first constructed, it contained twenty-one rooms and could accommodate 450 students. Dedicated on January 8, 1929, its first students were enrolled that same January with the sophomores being the upper classmen. These pupils were the first to graduate from Fairview High School on June 1, 1931. The first addition to the high school was built in 1948 due to enrollment growth and the need for expanded curriculum. It included new industrial arts facilities, a 1,100-seat gymnasium, and assembly rooms. The original shop was remodeled, becoming a cafeteria. Between 1952 and 1954, ten new classrooms were added as well as an art room, a music suite with practice rooms, a business education complex, and an auditorium with a seating capacity of 844 persons. These new additions made for a structure almost as large as the original building. Then, too, the library was doubled in size, the cafeteria enlarged, and the home economics wing, which was part of the original building, modernized. The dedication of the auditorium was combined with the 25th anniversary celebration of the opening of the original section. The high school swimming pool opened in June 1961, the largest of any Cuyahoga County school at the time. In 1968, the science wing saw expansion with the addition of seven classrooms and a planetarium. An auto mechanics building opened on the high school grounds located by the athletic practice fields in October 1970. In 2007 the auto mechanics building was torn down in the early stages of the new Gemini Project. Which also involved removing the swimming pool and extending the high school gym. The varsity swim team now utilizes the swimming pool at the Fairview Recreation Gemimi Center. Most of the electrical and lighting throughout the high school and middle school was replaced in 2007-08 as part of the schools' upgrades. Beginning in late 2017, the school began to receive a massive renovation. This renovation involved the complete restructuring and remaking of classrooms, a wholly new cafeteria, upgraded hallways and facilities, redone music rooms, including a new orchestra room, and a completely new, smaller section of the building. This renovation project was completed in 2020. Beginning in 2019, the school underwent a rebranding that saw the removal of the longtime \\"Warrior\\" mascot in favor of a new one, with the same name but now a Spartan warrior. The \\"F\\" symbol also started to phase out. The school's branding also began to emphasize its project-based learning system, career-readiness programs, and sense of school spirit. Student Academics Despite being a small school, a wide variety of classes are offered to the students, including several Advanced Placement classes, honor courses, and vocational opportunities with Polaris Career Center.

The series showcased the short sci-fi films of both unknown and known (Tim Burton, George Lucas and Kevin Smith) filmmakers, giving rise to the channel's own Exposure Studios. Hosted by actress Lisa Marie, the films presented a wide range of science fiction subject matter. The series received poor ratings and was canceled in the fall of 2002. The series was originally shown on Sundays at 10:00pm EST and was repeated the following Saturday at 2:00am EST, later on the time was changed to 11:00pm EST and still repeated the following Saturday well after Midnight, which probably is a major reason for the poor ratings this show received. The series also had two guest hosts. Terry Farrell would host the \\"Best of Season One\\" episode and director Kevin Smith hosted the \\"Star Wars Short Films Showcase\\". The Sci-Fi Channel had also struck a deal with AtomFilms which gave them the broadcast rights of any of Atom Films' new science-fiction acquisitions, as well as all science fiction films currently in their library, for Exposure. Notable films aired For a complete list of films, see List of Exposure films Some of the rare films that were aired on the series include Tim Burton's Disney short film of Frankenweenie (which Disney decided not to release because they deemed it too scary for children) and George Lucas's original student film Electronic Labyrinth: THX 1138 4EB which was a basis for his 1971 cult sci-fi film THX 1138. Other notable works that were aired include The Forbidden by Clive Barker, Groping by Alex Proyas, More by Mark Osborne, George Lucas in Love by Joseph Nussbaum, Battle of the Sexes by Eric Kripke, Season's Greetings by Michael Dougherty, Silent Number by Jamie Blanks, To Build a Better Mousetrap by Christopher Leone, Suspicious by David Koepp, Oink by Rand Ravich, Tripping the Rift by Chris Moeller, Antebios by Fran√ßois Baranger, Herd by Mike Mitchell and Evil Hill by Ryan Schifrin. Redshirt Blues aired in an episode broadcast September 16, 2001. Exposure Studios This offshoot of the \\"Exposure\\" program was created by the Sci Fi Channel to serve as a springboard for promising amateur and semi- professional filmmakers. Exposure Studios was focused primarily on funding, mentoring and promoting young directors, commissioning them to create mini television pilots. Among the short films it produced were: The Man with No Eyes, Dream Hackers, Area 52 and Grasp. Wes Craven served as a mentor on the project. Legacy Though it appears that there are no plans to bring Exposure back on the Sci-Fi Channel lineup the channel did sponsor a short film showcase called \\"Exposure:Future of Film Festival\\" in New York City in August 2000. Though this has not been done again, the Sci-Fi channel still fosters a love of short film and has cashiered the works of interested filmmakers under the Exposure brand. In late October 2006 the Sci-Fi Channel in partnership with the Sundance Channel launched the Exposure Film Contest which ran for 8 weeks. The films were showcased on the SciFi Pulse broadband streaming applet of SciFi.com and viewers were permitted to vote on their favorites each week. The favorites of each week would then go on to the final choice selection with a results being posted on a primetime special that aired May 23, 2007. The winner was Paradox Road by Robert J. Thissen. Whether this contest will be repeated next year is unknown at this time. The series did receive a following in the science fiction/media fandom community. Many complained about the late night Sunday schedule the show was aired and asked the network to air it much earlier in the evening. Apparently, SFC management failed to hear the viewers concerns.

The museum was founded as the Boston Museum of Modern Art in 1936 with a mission to exhibit contemporary art. Since then it has gone through multiple name changes as well as moving its galleries and support spaces over 13 times. Its current home was built in 2006 in the South Boston Seaport District and designed by architects Diller Scofidio + Renfro. History The former ICA building located at 951/955 Boylston Street, now occupied by the Boston Architectural College The Institute of Contemporary Art was founded as the Boston Museum of Modern Art in 1936 with offices rented at 114 State Street with gallery space provided by the Fogg Museum and the Busch‚ÄìReisinger Museum at Harvard University.Smee, Sebastian.A beacon among its contemporaries . The Boston Globe. September 11, 2011. Accessed February 18, 2012. (Note: In the printed version of this article, a map with previous ICA venues was included. Some cited information has been retrieved from this map) The Museum planned itself as \\"a renegade offspring of the Museum of Modern Art\\", and was led by its first president, a 26-year-old architect named Nathaniel Saltonstall.75\\\\. Institute of Contemporary Art / Boston. 2011. edited by Flint, Lucy. Accessed February 18, 2012 The first exhibit curated by the new museum was \\"the first survey show of Paul Gauguin in the Boston Area.\\" Also in this first year the institution's first fundraiser was held, the Modern Art Ball, to which many big names in the art world attended including Gala and Salvador Dal√≠ who entered the ball dressed as sharks. In 1937 the Boston Museum of Modern Art moved to its first self-administered gallery space located at 14 Newbury Street and instated a 25 cent admission charge. This year the museum displayed the first survey of dada and surrealist art. On exhibit during this show was the now famous work Object (Le D√©jeuner en fourrure) by M√©ret Oppenheim. This exhibit was followed in 1938 by the museum sponsoring the Ballet Russe de Monte-Carlo's United States premiere. The performance had set pieces and costumes designed by Henri Matisse which was in keeping with the current exhibit, an examination of the relationship between Matisse and Pablo Picasso. The museum also moved again, this time to the Boston Art Club at 270 Dartmouth Street. In 1939 the museum officially cut ties with the Museum of Modern Art and changed its name to the \\"Institute of Modern Art.\\" After changing its name the museum held a show of German degenerate art, labeled as such by Hitler himself. Artists included in the exhibit included Max Beckmann, Ernst Ludwig Kirchner, Emil Nolde, and Paul Klee. The museum hosted a traveling exhibition of Pablo Picasso's works in 1940 named \\"Picasso, Forty Years of His Art\\", which included Picasso's famous work Guernica. The museum moved for a third time in as many years in 1940 to 210 Beacon Street and put together Frank Lloyd Wright's first museum survey in the United States. The museum stayed on Beacon Street until 1943 when it moved to 138 Newbury Street and assembled the first African American artist survey in New England, including works by Romare Bearden and Jacob Lawrence among others. The museum was also an important venue for the Boston Expressionists. In 1948 the \\"Institute of Modern Art\\" changes its name once again to the \\"Institute of Contemporary Art\\" (ICA) to \\"[distance] itself from the ideological inflections the term 'modern' has accrued in favor of its original meaning: 'that which exists now.'\\" This same year the newly renamed ICA exhibits works by Le Corbusier in his first show in a United States museum. For the next several years the ICA exhibited many touring and self-curated shows, including a 1950 survey of Edvard Munch including his famous work The Scream, a 1952 survey of Wassily Kandinsky including works never seen in the United States, and the first retrospective of Milton Avery in 1953. In 1956 the museum moved once more, this time to the School of the Museum of Fine Arts at 230 The Fenway, where in 1958 it organized the first United States museum survey of Roberto Matta. In 1959 the ICA installed artwork on the interior of a Stop & Shop on Memorial Drive in a show titled \\"Young Talent in New England.\\" Some claim that the show anticipated the pop art movement and its interest in consumerism. 1960 saw the ICA moving to the Metropolitan Boston Arts Center, located at 1175 Soldiers Field Road, which was designed by the museums founder, Nathaniel Saltonstall. The newly built, modernist glass- enclosed gallery was 80 feet long and 33 feet wide and was raised 12 feet off the ground on steel supports. The ICA only inhabited this space until 1963 where it moved, this time to 100 Newbury Street. During the five years the ICA spent at this location the museum exhibited, among other things, a collection of works by artists representing the United States at the Venice Biennale (John Chamberlain, Jim Dine, Jasper Johns, Morris Louis, Kenneth Noland, Claes Oldenburg, Robert Rauschenberg, and Frank Stella) and in 1965 the museum housed an exhibit on video and electronic art called \\"Art Turned On\\" to which Marcel Duchamp attended. In 1966 the museum organized an Andy Warhol exhibition with roughly 40 works including selections from Campbell's Soup Cans and portraits of Jackie Kennedy, Marilyn Monroe, Elvis Presley, and Elizabeth Taylor, as well as the first exhibitions in a museum setting of Warhol's films including Eat, Sleep, and Kiss. This same year saw Warhol and The Velvet Underground stage a performance of Exploding Plastic Inevitable at the ICA. 1968 saw the ICA return to the Metropolitan Boston Arts Center, at 1175 Soldiers Field Road, for two years just to move again in 1970 to the Parkman House at 33 Beacon Street as a temporary home. During these two years the ICA held an exhibit called \\"Monumental Sculpture for Public Spaces\\" where large-scale sculptural works by well-known artists, such as Alexander Calder, Donald Judd, Robert Morris, Louise Nevelson, Claes Oldenburg, and Mark di Suvero, were placed in public spaces across the city. Possibly the most notable sculpture from this exhibit was the installation of the original 12 foot tall Cor-ten steel edition of Robert Indiana's LOVE on City Hall PlazaDannatt, Adrian. Robert Indiana: Hard Edge. New York: Paul Kasmin Gallery, 2008. 14-19. In 1972 the ICA installed the first Douglas Huebler solo show, and it briefly moved to 137 Newbury Street. A year later, in 1973, the ICA found a more permanent home at 955 Boylston Street in a former police station. The Museum occupied this building for 33 years over which many exhibits and performances were mounted. Highlights from the first decade of the ICA at this location include a 1976 retrospective of Claes Oldenburg in which Oldenberg himself attends, the first showing of David Hockney artworks in America in 1977, and in 1980 the museum hosted both the first United States museum exhibition of purely Dada artworks as well as a roller disco fundraiser. The 1980s saw more exhibitions including the first museum installation of works by Francesco Clemente and Anselm Kiefer in 1982, and in 1984 the ICA joined with WGBH, Boston's PBS station, to create and fund the Contemporary Art Television Fund. This fund helped video artists get their works to be broadcast on television. Later in decade the ICA exhibited works by Allan Sekula in his first museum solo show in 1986, held the New England Premiere of the film True Stories by David Byrne, in 1986, who attended the screening, and in 1989 displayed both the first United States survey for Chris Burden as well as the first dedicated major exhibition of the Situationist International movement. In 1990 the ICA was the last stop for the traveling highly controversial exhibit The Perfect Moment containing the works of Robert Mapplethorpe, as well as displaying the first museum exhibition in the United States of works by Sophie Calle. In 1997 Cildo Meireles received his first exhibition in a major United States museum at the ICA. The late 1990s saw a dramatic shift at the ICA. A new director, Jill Medvedow, was hired and she embarked upon a new series called \\"Vita Brevis\\" which was a series of commissions of large-scale artworks to be exhibited in public spaces across Boston. One of the first works commissioned for this project was a film projected on the Bunker Hill Monument created by Krzysztof Wodiczko. These works greatly increased the public knowledge and image of the museum. Then, in 1999 the ICA won a competition to build a new cultural institution building on Boston's Fan Pier. While plans for the new building on the waterfront were being created and the building itself constructed, the ICA continued to be located at 955 Boylston Street. During these years the ICA exhibited, among other things, the first solo exhibition in a museum of works by Cornelia Parker in 2000 and the first United States solo exhibit for Olafur Eliasson in 2001. In 2006 the ICA moved to its new 65,000 square foot building on Fan Pier containing both galleries and a performance space. This same year, the museum began to build a permanent collection. Since moving to its new building, the ICA has presented world premiers of dance performances by the Mark Morris Dance Group in 2007 and the Bill T. Jones/Arnie Zane Dance Company in 2011. Exhibits have included the first major museum surveys of works by Tara Donovan in 2008, Dami√°n Ortega and Shepard Fairey, who was arrested on vandalism charges on his way to an ICA event, in 2009, and Mark Bradford in 2010. Buildings =Main building= ICA building in 2019 Formerly located on Boylston Street in the Back Bay neighborhood, the ICA moved to a new facility in the Seaport District of South Boston. The museum celebrated the completion of its new building the weekend of December 9‚Äì10, 2006. The new building coincided with the museum's launch of its first permanent collection. The new building was designed by the architectural firm Diller Scofidio + Renfro. It is one of that firm's first structures to be built, and the first to be built in the United States. It is also the first new art museum to be built in Boston in over a century. The building is located between the Courthouse and World Trade Center stations on the MBTA Silver Line. Critical response The building's design, which echoes that of nearby waterfront gantry cranes, has been celebrated by many critics for its openness, represented by its exterior grand staircase, and willingness to embrace the surrounding harbor.Ouroussoff, Nicolai (December 8, 2006). Expansive Vistas Both Inside and Out The New York Times. The ICA was the recipient of the 2007 Harleston Parker Medal, awarded to \\"the most beautiful piece of architecture\\" in Boston. It has also been called a \\"botched box\\" by architecture critic Philip Nobel, who criticised it for having poor circulation, a dull fa√ßade facing land, and casting into shadow the harborside promenade that Elizabeth Diller once referred to as \\"Boston‚Äôs only viable civic space.\\" =ICA Watershed= In 2018, the ICA transformed a condemned 15,000-square-foot building in the Boston Harbor Shipyard and Marina in East Boston into the \\"ICA Watershed\\". The renovation was designed by Alex Anmahian and Nick Winton. Admission to the Watershed is free. The ICA offers ferry service from its main building to the Watershed, which is open each year from spring through fall. Each year, an exhibit by one artist fills the space. The 2018 exhibit was by Diana Thater, and the 2019 exhibit was by John Akomfrah. The planned opening of the 2020 exhibit by Firelei B√°ez was delayed by the ICA's closure, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. With the museum closed because of the pandemic, the building was used as a staging area for delivery of food to East Boston residents. Exhibitions Outdoor amphitheater facing Boston harbor The ICA's exhibition program has included the Momentum series, focusing on the work of emerging artists; the Sandra and Gerald Fineberg Art Wall, an annual, site-specific commission in the museum lobby; the James and Audrey Foster Prize, a biennial exhibition and award for Boston-area artists; and selections from the permanent collection. The West Gallery (known today as Bridgitt and Bruce Evans Family and Karen and Brian Conway Galleries), the largest exhibition space, has featured solo and group exhibitions including Super Vision (2006), Philip-Lorca diCorcia (2007), Street Level (2008), Anish Kapoor (2008), Tara Donovan (2008), Shepard Fairey (2009), and Mark Bradford (2011).

It was built in 1905 and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1995. History In January 1856, the Ladies Social Circle of Greenville met to form a group to promote the intellectual and moral elevation of society. For nearly fifty years this group raised funds to support a library. In late 1800s, the Ladies Library Association raised $1,000.00 from the community and collected 4,000 books. The first book purchased for the library's holdings was the Holy Bible. At first the library was housed in the librarian's home, then in rented rooms, and eventually in the courthouse. In 1903, Andrew Carnegie was contacted for possible funds. His donation of $10,000 was used to construct a public library to be built on city-owned land and which was to be tax supported. Architect Paul O. Moratz of Bloomington, Illinois designed the Classical Revival style structure. The library opened in August 1905 after much community support and work. Collection The library houses 25,000 volumes plus video tapes and audio books. The holdings of the Bond County Genealogical Society are housed on the lower level of the library. The collection also includes every issue of the Greenville Advocate, the local newspaper, from the 1858 to present, on microfilm.

History =Early history= For many millennia, the Great Plains of North America was inhabited by nomadic Native Americans. From the 16th century to 18th century, the Kingdom of France claimed ownership of large parts of North America. In 1762, after the French and Indian War, France secretly ceded New France to Spain, per the Treaty of Fontainebleau. =19th century= 1915 Railroad Map of Harvey County In 1802, Spain returned most of the land to France. In 1803, most of the land for modern day Kansas was acquired by the United States from France as part of the 828,000 square mile Louisiana Purchase for 2.83 cents per acre. In 1854, the Kansas Territory was organized, then in 1861 Kansas became the 34th U.S. state. In 1872, Harvey County was established within the Kansas Territory, which included the land for modern day Annelly. The community was established after the Missouri Pacific was built through the area. Annelly was named by a railroad employee for his wife Ann and daughter Ellie. A post office existed in Annelly from August 25, 1885, to December 31, 1921. =20th century= In 1910, Annelly, (population 25) had a money order post office, a station on the Missouri Pacific Railroad, a grain elevator, a hotel, and a general store. =21st century= In 2003, the railroad track was abandoned. Today only the Main Street (Annelly Road or SE 57th Street, accessible from S East Lake Rd. and SE 60th Street) of Annelly still exists. Until the early 2010s an old one-room school house stood near the townsite, although the schoolhouse could not be observed or approached from public roads. The school house was moved to property owned by Lewis Earl Entz. It has been restored but is on private property. For many years, even after the school closed this was the community center, for 4H and the Women's Farm Bureau which became the EHU Extension Homemakers Units. It was also where residents of the township voted for many years. A farm house on the west end of Main Street is still occupied. The old railroad bed still passes through the townsite, and some evidence of buildings and old streets can still be seen. Gypsum Creek, a tributary of the Whitewater River, runs through Annelly.

The music was composed by Geoffrey Burgon. Episode 1 was originally aired in an 85 minute time slot, while the remaining 5 episodes were 60 minutes in length. It was originally broadcast on BBC2 from 7th November to 12th December 1994. Plot summary Elderly, wealthy Martin Chuzzlewit is constantly hounded by his money-grubbing relations, a fact that depresses and embitters him. He adopts an orphan young woman, Mary Graham, whom he wants as a companion in his old age; she will be paid an annual allowance but will not benefit from his death. However, Martin disowns his grandson, also called Martin, after he falls in love with Mary. Young Martin decides to pursue a career as an architect, studying with hypocritical, dishonest architect Seth Pecksniff, who lives with his two daughters Charity and Mercy and good, kind-hearted apprentice Tom Pinch, whom he is exploiting as a servant. Martin forms a close friendship with Tom, but after he discovers Pecksniff's true character, he leaves for America, in the company of Mark Tapley (ostler of the local inn), to seek his fortune. Pecksniff, who is a cousin of the Chuzzlewits, insinuates himself into Old Martin's company, taking him in as a guest, hoping for a generous legacy on the event of Martin's death. He also makes sexual advances towards Mary; she, who has also formed a special friendship with Tom, tells him of this and he, shocked, leaves the Pecksniff household for London, setting up home with his sister Ruth. Jonas Chuzzlewit, son of old Martin's estranged brother Anthony, marries Mercy Pecksniff ‚Äî despite being twice her age and having previously shown more interest in Charity ‚Äî and mistreats her. He also finds himself drawn into a fraudulent insurance scheme masterminded by Tigg Montague, and concocts a murderous plot in order to extricate himself from this. Meanwhile, Mr Chuffey, Anthony's senile clerk, goes into shock in the event of Anthony's sudden death and sleazy private nurse Sarah Gamp is hired to care for him.

Its construction dates to 1846 and the Oregon boundary dispute. The fort consists of earthworks surrounding a Martello tower. Fort Frederick is included in two separate National Historic Sites of Canada: Kingston Fortifications National Historic Site and the Point Frederick Buildings National Historic Site.Kingston Fortifications, Directory of Designations of National Historic Significance of Canada History Fort Frederick was built on the south end of Point Frederick, the site of the Kingston Royal Naval Dockyard. The point and fort were named after Frederick, Prince of Wales. The original fort, consisting of earthworks, was built during the War of 1812 for protection against naval attack. On November 10, 1812, the Fort Frederick battery took part in repulsing an American naval squadron under Commodore Isaac Chauncey. Fort Frederick c. 1874 Four stone Martello towers were built to strengthen Kingston's defences in 1846 during the Oregon boundary dispute between the United States and Britain. The towers were meant to protect the shipyard and the entrances to the Rideau Canal and St. Lawrence River, from possible United States aggression. Fort Frederick was one of these towers, built on the site of the original fort. The three other towers were Cathcart Tower, Murney Tower, and Shoal Tower. Fort Frederick was abandoned in 1870.http://hr.ottawa- hull.mil.ca/dhh/collections/memorials/engraph/display_e.asp?PID=4596&cat;=7 Fort Frederick is the RMC cadets' outdoor relaxed area, where all cadets are considered equal in rank, headdress may be removed, and cadets have free rein to relax. The Martello tower houses the RMC Museum. Alexander Mackenzie was a foreman on the construction of the Fort Frederick Martello Tower and later went on to become Canada's second prime minister. While on an unannounced trip to Fort Frederick to look for a possible site for a new military college, Prime Minister Mackenzie asked the then commandant, Colonel de la C.T. Irwin, if he knew the thickness of the outside wall. When the surprised commandant could not answer, Prime Minister Mackenzie said \\"It's 5 feet 6 inches, I know for I built it myself!\\". While Archibald Macdonnell was Commandant of RMC, between 1909‚Äì19, the upper floors of Fort Frederick were used as a common room. After the seniors rolled cannonballs down the common room stairs, the floor was reallocated as a recruit haven. The college's class of 1931 gifted Fort Frederick with wooden gates and a plaque in 1971 in remembrance of the days when Fort Frederick was a recruit refuge.

In 2003 the Kinga population was estimated to number 140,000. Background The Kinga are primarily agriculturists with millet, beans, some bananas, cultivating bamboo for a strong good beer, and finally in 1905, growing wheat and potatoes. They inhabited the Livingstone Mountains to a height of 10,000 feet and maintained a moderate amount of cattle but mostly sheep and goats. The Nyakyusa who are wakingas close neighbors consider the Kinga to be distinct and different. According to them the Kinga are warriors who were good enough to fight with in the Konde Revolt against the Germans, and are eager to acquire Kinga iron implements in exchange for food, cattles etc. Metalwork The Nyakyusa considered iron a scarce and precious commodity normally needing the secret skills of the Kinga smiths. With the invasion of the Ngoni the Nyakyusa found their wood-tipped spears to be ineffective against tough shields and went to the Kinga for well-made iron- tipped spears. Iron, melting at about 2,804 ¬∞F, was heated to about 2,200 ¬∞F and then layered in charcoal until the slag drained off. The remainder was a solid spongy mass called bloom, which was then reheated and hammered in a forge with no guarantee of success. Each operation required the building of a new furnace with demands on charcoal, labor, and skills. The production of only three hoes or spears may have needed a ton of charcoal and a long apprenticeship. It also required a vast amount of wood. The Nyakyusa contributed by making the shields. Beliefs Kinga priests claimed they belonged to an ancient heritage, a line older than their chiefs. The priests also seemed to interpret subterranean water movement (much as a Ruteng√§nger). The Nyakyusa would watch with fear and dismay as these pilgrims descended the mountain paths each year heading for 'Lwenbe's' shrine. Characteristics The Kinga were to be found in hidden areas, probably having been driven there by the Magwangwara Ngoni, and then the Wasangu, and even the Hehe, and were not easily located. They had little interaction with their neighbors, and felt comfortable only in their mountains. While they provided early warning posts against invasion of the Nyakyusa territory from the south and east, the Nyakyusa were not thankful, and generally held the Kinga in contempt. Alexander Merensky describes them as having no particular physical type, their facial features and physique all being different. He thought them a mixed group of runaway slaves hiding in the mountains. Merensky found only one common characteristic: due to their mountain climbing the muscles on their legs were very well developed and they had acquired a distinct type of jogging while going up and down these heights. Merensky, like the Nyakyusa, found them personally dirty and their homesteads of cylindrical and conical shaped huts disorderly and surrounded by hedges of thorn. Seemingly they were adept only at navigating their mountains and skillfully creating beautiful hoes, knives, iron spears, and a very pleasing beer from bamboo, which was plentiful in their area. Kinga are found within Njombe region not but not Iringa, also is better to include a number of kinga name to be included in Swahili language Demographics The Kinga speak the Kinga language almost exclusively at home. They usually know Swahili, but are not fluent. 57,000 Kinga live in the Makete district, the rest in the Iringa Region of the Kipengere Range. References * Bauer, Andreus.

Start of production  The Standard Vanguard was produced by AMI from 1958 to 1964 The origins of Australian Motor Industries can be traced back to 1926 when J.F. Crosby decided to invest in Eclipse Motors Pty Ltd of Melbourne. In 1929 the company secured the Victorian agency for Standard Motor Company's cars, then changed the company name to Talbot and Standard Motors, and began a steady period of expansion with the Standard marque through the 1930s. In 1952 the Crosby family formed a holding company, Standard Motor Products Ltd, in co-operation with the Standard Motor Company of England to assemble cars at a new assembly plant in Port Melbourne. The subsidiary company responsible for vehicle assembly was the Standard Motor Company (Australia) Limited. It assembled the Standard Eight, Vanguard, Spacemaster and the Triumph Mayflower.https://pocketozmelbourne.com.au/lost-fishermans-ami.html Import tariffs on vehicles encouraged the growth of the Australian vehicle body building industry from the early 1920s. The tax concessions varied with the degree of local content. Changes within the industry saw the consolidation of the principal manufacturers and the demise of the smaller body builders. The Port Melbourne assembly plant was one of many new facilities which were set up to meet the post war demand for new vehicles. By 1955 the assembly complex had expanded to of land and the new engine assembly plant had a capacity of 100 engines per eight-hour shift. Standard Motor Products Ltd was unusual in the Australian motor industry because of the high Australian shareholding of the company; 88% in 1952 when the Australian company bought out its English partner. The remaining shares were held by the Standard Motor Company (SMC). As a sign of the close co-operation between the two companies, SMC's Sir John Black was made president and Arthur Crosby remained as chairman. His brother, Clive Crosby, became the managing director. By 1956, the factory employed over 1,600 workers. When Leyland Motors, the new owners of Standard, indicated it wished to assume its own production of Triumph cars in Australia, AMI needed to find another car to assemble. The answer came with Mercedes-Benz. In 1958 the company negotiated an agreement with Daimler-Benz to assemble and distribute Mercedes-Benz vehicles in Australia. In recognition of this new agreement the company was renamed Australian Motor Industries and a new subsidiary company was formed to handle the Mercedes-Benz franchise. Passenger vehicle sales show 729 locally assembled Mercedes-Benz cars were sold between July 1959 and June 1960. By 1960 Mercedes-Benz had increased passenger car sales in Australia by 10 fold annually, selling as many cars per year as had been sold in the first fifty years. Leyland decided not to proceed with its own Australian operation, allowing AMI to begin production of the Triumph Herald from 1959. AMI also assembled Ferguson tractors through another subsidiary company of the group, British Farm Equipment. An extensive dealer network throughout New South Wales and Victoria saw Standard cars and Ferguson tractors sold side by side in country areas. The most popular car sold was the Vanguard model.Five Decades of Motoring in Australia: The 1950s Australia for Everyone  Reorganisation  Mercedes-Benz 220SEb assembled by AMI 1959 Triumph Herald assembled by AMI In October 1960, AMI signed an agreement with American Motors Corporation (AMC) to assemble the Rambler range of cars from knock-down kits. Another deal with Fiat was planned to replace the Ferguson tractors distributed by BFE. The Standard Motor Company had sold its tractor facility in Coventry to Massey Ferguson and focused on automobile production. AMI ran into financial trouble during the Australian credit squeeze of 1961 and the company was forced to sell off many assets and vehicle stock to remain solvent. Part of the restructure resulted in the sale of their share in the Mercedes-Benz franchise to the German parent company. In 1963 the company secured the Australian franchise for Toyota cars and began assembly of the Tiara range. From this point the financial position of the company steadily improved and by 1967 AMI was assembling 32 different models for the Australian market, as well as importing fully assembled Toyota Corollas for their dealer network. Other cars assembled by AMI included the Rambler range from American Motor Corporation and Triumph cars from Leyland Motors. Leyland had inherited shares in AMI when it had merged with Standard-Triumph International in 1961. During the early 1960s the foreign share of the automobile motor vehicle market was estimated to be 95%, and as the only sizeable producer with a local equity, AMI continued to manufacture overseas designs. AMI assembled the Triumph Herald from 1959 to 1966 and produced some unique Australian models. Production of the Standard Vanguard Six at the AMI plant finally came to a halt some 12 months after production had ended in Britain, however the engine remained in production for fitment to the Triumph 2000. The Triumph 2000/2500 range was assembled in Port Melbourne from 1964 to the mid-1970s. By 1965, the demise of the Standard Vanguard and the loss of assembly rights for Mercedes- Benz vehicles left AMI with additional capacity to assemble Rambler, Triumph and Toyota models.  Operations with AMC  1966 Rambler Classic, built in Australia. 1971 Rambler Matador (assembled in 1972) 1969 Rambler AMX assembled by AMI 1974 Rambler Matador Coupe (Australian models were assembled in 1976) From 1961, AMI assembled a range of AMC cars, starting with the Rambler Ambassador, all with right-hand drive and carried the Rambler brand name. By the end of the 1960s Australians could purchase a Rambler Javelin, AMX, Hornet, Rebel, or Matador long after the Rambler marque was dropped from use on the equivalent U.S.-market models. Knock-down kits were shipped from AMC's Kenosha, Wisconsin facility (all knock-down kits to all assembly operations were from Kenosha), but the Australian cars were assembled with a percentage of \\"local content\\" to gain tariff concessions. This was done using parts and components (such as glass, seats, upholstery and carpet, lights, tailshafts, and heaters) from local Australian suppliers. AMI specified what parts were not to be included in the unassembled kits sent by AMC. Other necessary parts specified by the assembler were boxed and shipped for assembly at the final destination in Australia. It is unknown exactly how many parts were included to be installed by the assembly operation, that varied with each operation. External colours were chosen by AMI and were the same as used on AMI assembled Triumph and Toyota cars of that period. The distinctive AMI exterior emblems were used on Ramblers, as well as Triumph and Toyota cars assembled by AMI from 1968 onward. The Australian assembled Rebel was assembled from 1967 until 1971, even though the last year of the American model was 1970. 345 Rebels were assembled in 1970 and a further 307 in 1971. Australian Rebels were equipped with the dash and instrument cluster of the 1967 Rambler Ambassador for all models and was continued with the Australian assembled replacement AMC Matador. A total of 24 AMC AMXs, all 1969 models were made by AMI between August 1969 and July 1970. All featured the V8s. Differences to the RHD two- seater AMXs compared to the U.S. models included swapping the power brake booster and heater motor on the firewall, the power steering pump remained in its usual left location, although the rest of the steering components had to be on the right side of the cars. All of the Australian AMX interiors were finished in black featuring a unique RHD dashboard with a wood-grained instrument cluster in front of the driver. While the AMX was marketed as a performance muscle car in the U.S. marketplace, the Australian AMXs came with a large high level of equipment that was optional in the U.S., and these AMXs were advertised as personal luxury cars. One AMC Gremlin was imported from USA in 1970 for evaluation purposes. It was locally converted to right-hand-drive and branded as a \\"Rambler Gremlin\\". The car features the standard I6 engine with three-speed manual transmission. The car was presented at the 1970 Sydney Motor Show to gauge interest and test the market but never went into production. From 1971, Australian assembled Matadors were equipped with standard column shift automatic transmissions, power steering, power windows, air conditioning, and an AM radio. The engine in the later years was AMC's V8. Options included exterior sunvisor, vinyl roof cover, tow hitch, and mud flaps. A total of 118 Hornets and 145 Matadors (118 sedans, 27 wagons) were sold during 1974. Registrations for 1975 were 136 Hornets and 118 Matadors (85 sedans 33 wagons). In 1976 there were 88 Matadors (78 sedans, 10 wagons), while 1977 saw just 24 Matador sedans and 3 wagons. Additionally, Matador coupe CKD kits arrived in late-1974, and the assembly of 80 cars began in 1976. The cars were marketed as 1977 models. One fully assembled AMC Pacer was imported for evaluation purposes.Australian AMC production data: As with the Gremlin, AMI did not go ahead with assembling the Pacer for the Australian market. American Motors cars were assembled in Port Melbourne by AMI up to 1977. The company retained a niche market as the sole U.S. sourced cars available in the Australian marketplace. For example, the Government of New South Wales selected the Rambler Rebel and the Matador as official vehicles in the 1970s.  Toyota and buyout  The Toyota Tiara was the first Toyota model assembled by AMI The first Toyota car ever built outside Japan was assembled by AMI in April 1963, the Toyota Tiara. The AMI production of Toyotas expanded in the 1960s to also include the Crown, Corona and Corolla assembled at AMI's Port Melbourne factory. Toyota Motor Corporation of Japan purchased 10% of outstanding AMI shares. As a fast-growing company, it took a controlling interest in AMI in 1968 as a contract with the British Leyland Motor Corporation Ltd was signed.Overseas interest in AMI Truck & Bus Transportation February 1968 page 116 Toyota also purchased a 40% share in Thiess Toyota, the importer of Toyota light commercial vehicles from Thiess.History of Toyota in Australia . Retrieved 23 March 2015. Recognizing the majority owner of the company and the products that it manufactured and marketed, AMI renamed itself as AMI Toyota Ltd in 1985.

History There was much infighting during this period (1524-28). Nine men were involved in the government, not including Cort√©s himself, who made a very brief return in 1526. They usually formed a governing council of three, never more than five, and occasionally only one or two. This interval began with Cort√©s's expedition to Honduras and ended with the arrival of the first Audiencia Real. Not much is known about la Torre. He was in the government of the Viceroyalty of New Spain from March 2, 1527 to December 8, 1528, or about 1 year and 9 months. Alonso de Estrada was also in the government for this period, and for the early part (until August 22, 1527), so was Gonzalo de Sandoval. La Torre and Estrada were cousins. On the latter date, a royal decree was received in Mexico City, ratifying the transfer of powers granted by Luis Ponce de Le√≥n to Marcos de Aguilar, but Aguilar had died on March 1. Before he died, Aguilar had named Estrada governor, and this decree from Spain solidified Estrada's position. Since Cort√©s was suspected of poisoning both Luis Ponce de Le√≥n and Aguilar, he was not in a position to challenge Alonso de Estrada and Luis de la Torre. A person named Luis de la Torre accompanied Columbus to the New World on one of his voyages, and is credited with being the codiscoverer (among Europeans) of tobacco. However, that may have been the uncle of this man.

Kara is the capital of the Kara region and, according to the 2010 census, had a population of 94,878. The Kara River flows through the city and is its main resource of water. The city developed from the 1970s onwards from the village originally known as Lama-Kara. Its growth was largely due to the influence of the previous Togolese head of state Gnassingb√© Eyad√©ma who was born in the nearby village of Piya and understood Kara's strategic position at a crossroads of two trade routes. History In 1902, a bridge over the Kara River was built by the Germans, which marks the beginning of the city.Nicou√© Gayibor, Histoire des Togolais. Des origines aux ann√©es 1960 - Tome 3, KARTHALA Editions, France, 2011, p. 387 Under the presidency of Gnassingb√© Eyad√©ma, in the 1970s, the city developed particularly because of its role in holding political events.DIOP Amadou, AGOSSOU Noukpo, NYASSOGBO Kwami Gabriel, Syst√®mes spatiaux et structures r√©gionales en Afrique, KARTHALA Editions, France, 2010, p. 97 Geography Kabiy√® Mountains, Kara The city lies at the southen tip of the southern Kabiye mountain range.

US 11W and US 421 diverge an at intersection with Tennessee State Route 1 (State Street) at the state line. US 11W continues into Bristol, Tennessee as State Street while US 421 heads northwest on Gate City Highway. The U.S. Highway passes the Bristol Mall before meeting I-81 at a partial cloverleaf interchange, where US 58 exits I-81 and joins US 421 in a concurrency. US 421 and US 58 exit the city of Bristol and enter Washington County as a two-lane road. The U.S. Highways head northwest through gaps in Big Ridge, Walker Mountain, then curve southwest through the Rich Valley. At the Washington-Scott county line, US 421 and US 58 veer northwest again and follow a curvaceous path through Shelly Ridge and Cove Ridge, after which the highways follow Cove Creek southwest through the valley of the North Fork Holston River until the highways turn northwest, cross the river, and pass through Hilton Gap in Pine Ridge. The highways pass through the village of Hiltons and parallel the Appalachia Division rail line southwest through the Poor Valley to the town of Weber City, where the highways meet the northern end of SR 224 (Wadlow Gap Road), cross Moccasin Creek, and intersect US 23 (Main Street). US 421, US 23, and US 58 run concurrently with the Appalachia Division rail line through Moccasin Gap, where Moccasin Creek passes through Clinch Mountain. The U.S. Highways enter the town of Gate City; three congruent business routes pass through the center of town while the mainline of the U.S. Highways follows the flank of Clinch Mountain to the south of town. US 421, US 23, and US 58 receive their three business routes at an interchange west of Gate City. The U.S. Highways parallel the railroad and Little Moccasin Creek west between Clinch Mountain to the south and Moccasin Ridge to the north. The highways curve north and parallel the Clinch River to Clinchport, where the road meets the southern end of SR 65 and begins to follow Stock Creek. US 421, US 23, and US 58 pass by Glenita, where the railroad splits north to pass through the Natural Tunnel, the centerpiece of Natural Tunnel State Park. After passing through the Devil's Racepath, US 58 and US 421 split west from US 23 (Orby Cantrell Highway) as Daniel Boone Trail just south of the town of Duffield. US 421 and US 58 head west as a two-lane road that crosses the North Fork of the Clinch River and ascends Powell Mountain, on top of which the highways enter Lee County. The U.S. Highways descend the mountain to Wallens Creek, then pass through several sweeping curves before diverging at the hamlet of Dot. US 421 heads northwest and passes through the hamlet of Woodway before crossing the Powell River. The U.S. Highway follows the North Fork of the Powell River to the town of Pennington Gap, where the highway passes under the Appalachia Division rail line intersects US 58 Alternate (Trail of the Lonesome Pine). US 421 and US 58 Alternate head through the center of town along Morgan Avenue before US 421 heads out of town along the North Fork of the Powell River and the rail line through Pennington Gap, which is a water gap through Stone Mountain. At Stone Creek north of the gap, US 421 meets the southern end of SR 352 (St. Charles Road), which serves the town of St. Charles to the north. The U.S. Highway heads west, following Stone Creek to its source near the Kentucky state line, which coincides with the Tennessee Valley Divide, from which US 421 continues northwest toward Harlan. History The majority of US 421 in Virginia, from Pennington Gap east to Bristol, was designated as part of State Route 10 in 1918; the rest was not a state highway until the late 1920s. The east (south) three miles (5 km) were added as State Route 104 in 1928, taking it to the present State Route 352 junction at Stone Creek; St. Charles (accessed via SR 352) was used as the eventual end. , page 12 However, it was instead extended west to the Kentucky state line, with 2.25 miles (3.5 km) added in 1931 , page 3 and the rest, another , in 1932. , page 13 (SR 352 was added in 1942, completing the route to St. Charles. , page 24) In the 1933 renumbering, SR 104 became State Route 65. It was soon extended southeast along former SR 10 from Pennington Gap to Dot, when U.S. Route 58 was removed from it in favor of a shorter alignment. SR 65 became part of State Route 66, which continued east from Dot to south of St. Paul along former State Route 70, in the 1940 renumbering, as Kentucky had taken over its continuation as Kentucky Route 66. , page 12 In the meantime, the route from Cumberland Gap to Bristol had been through several changes in numbering. It was assigned U.S. Route 411 in 1926, renumbered as part of U.S. Route 58 in the early 1930s, and supplemented with U.S. Route 421 from the 1930s to the late 1940s. By 1951, , page 22 US 421 had re-entered Virginia, this time splitting from US 58 at Dot to cross into Kentucky, causing State Route 66 to be truncated at Clinchport. US 58 was moved to Interstate 81 between Bristol and Abingdon by the end of 1965, , page 43 leaving US 421 on its own from I-81 west of Bristol to U.S. Route 11W at the intersection of State Street and Euclid Avenue west of downtown Bristol. (Its easternmost several blocks on State Street (east of U.S. Route 11E) had also been separate since its creation in the 1930s.) =Routing in Bristol= Map of US 421 through Bristol, VA The earliest alignment in Bristol came to the state line on Pennsylvania Avenue in Bristol, Tennessee (still US 421 today) and turned west on State Street to end at U.S. Route 11E a few blocks later, at or near Edgemont Avenue. This was initially part of U.S. Route 321 but soon became US 421. When it was extended west, it was taken along US 11E to Piedmont Avenue (U.S. Route 11) and U.S. Route 11W to Euclid Avenue, where it curved northwest onto what had been U.S. Route 411. Soon U.S. Route 58 came in from the northeast along with US 11, leaving only the piece east of US 11E on its own. , page 8Map of Washington County, revised July 1, 1936 A traffic survey resulted in the creation of a one-way pair in 1952, where southbound US 421 used Shelby Street, a block south of State Street in Tennessee, between Ninth Street (Commonwealth Avenue) and Fourth Street (Edgemont Avenue). US 58 eastbound moved to the same alignment, but turned north at Seventh Street to reach Piedmont Avenue. , pages 17-18 With the completion of Euclid Avenue in 1967, US 421 was realigned again to use Euclid Avenue from the west end of State Street northeast (with US 58 and other routes) to Piedmont Avenue. There it turned southeast on Piedmont Avenue and Mary Street and southwest on Goodson Street, crossing the state line directly onto Pennsylvania Avenue. This had been State Route 76-Y along Mary Street east of Oakview Avenue (old U.S. Route 11, new State Route 113) and part of State Route 76 along Goodson Street. , pages 17-18 The present alignment of US 421 through Bristol, using Commonwealth Avenue, Goode Street, Piedmont Avenue, Cumberland Street, Randall Street, and State Street, was adopted in 1984, at the same time as U.S. Route 11/19 Truck was established along much of the same routing. , pages 13-15 Major intersections See also *Special routes of U.S. Route 421 References External links * Virginia Highways Project: US 421 21-4 U.S. Route 421 U.S. Route 421 U.S. Route 421 U.S. Route 421 Virginia ","title":"U.S. Route 421 in Virginia"},{"id":"6615263","text":"Bhisham Sahni (8 August 1915 ‚Äì 11 July 2003) was an Indian writer, playwright in Hindi and an actor, most famous for his novel and television screenplay Tamas (\\"Darkness, Ignorance\\"), a powerful and passionate account of the Partition of India. He was awarded the Padma Bhushan for literature in 1998, and Sahitya Akademi Fellowship in 2002. He was the younger brother of the noted Hindi film actor, Balraj Sahni. Biography Bhisham Sahni was born on 8 August 1915 in Rawalpindi, in undivided Punjab. He earned a master's degree in English literature from Government College in Lahore, and a Ph.D from Punjab University, Chandigarh in 1958. He joined the struggle for Indian independence. At the time of Partition he was an active member of the Indian National Congress, and organized relief work for the refugees when riots broke out in Rawalpindi in March 1947. In 1948 Bhisham Sahni started working with the Indian People‚Äôs Theatre Association (IPTA), an organization with which his brother, Balraj Sahni was already closely associated. He worked both as an actor and a director. At a later stage, he directed a drama ‚ÄòBhoot Gari‚Äô. This was adapted for the stage by film director, screenwriter, novelist, and a journalist Khwaja Ahmed Abbas. As an actor he appeared in several films, including Saeed Mirza's Mohan Joshi Hazir Ho! (1984), Tamas (1986), Kumar Shahani's Kasba (1991), Bernardo Bertolucci's Little Buddha (1993) and Aparna Sen's Mr. and Mrs. Iyer (2002). As a result of his association with IPTA, he left the Congress and joined the Communist Party. Thereafter, he left Bombay for Punjab where he worked briefly as a lecturer, first in a college at Ambala and then at Khalsa College, Amritsar. At this time he was involved in organizing the Punjab College Teachers‚Äô Union and also continued with IPTA work. In 1952 he moved to Delhi and was appointed Lecturer in English at Delhi College (now Zakir Husain College), University of Delhi. From 1956 to 1963 he worked as a translator at the Foreign Languages Publishing House in Moscow, and translated some important works into Hindi, including Lev Tolstoy‚Äôs short stories and his novel Resurrection. On his return to India Bhisham Sahni resumed teaching at Delhi College, and also edited the reputed literary magazine Nai Kahaniyan from 1965 to 1967. He retired from service in 1980. Sahni was fluent in Punjabi, English, Urdu, Sanskrit and Hindi. Bhisham Sahni was associated with several literary and cultural organizations. He was General Secretary of the All India Progressive Writers Association (1975‚Äì85) and Acting General Secretary of the Afro-Asian Writer‚Äô Association and was also associated with the editing of their journal Lotus. He was the founder and chairman of 'SAHMAT', an organisation promoting cross-cultural understanding, founded in memory of the murdered theatre artist and activist Safdar Hashmi. Literary works Bhisham Sahni's epic work Tamas (Darkness, Ignorance 1974) is a novel based on the riots of 1947 Partition of India which he witnessed at Rawalpindi.Tamas Tamas portrays the horrors of senseless communal politics of violence and hatred; and the tragic aftermath ‚Äì death, destruction, forced migration and the partition of a country. It has been translated to English, French, German, Japanese and many Indian languages including Tamil,Gujarati, Malayalam, Kashmiri, and Manipuri. Tamas won the 1975 Sahitya Akademi Award for literature and was later made into a television film in 1987 by Govind Nihalani. Two of his masterpiece stories, Pali and Amritsar Aa Gaya Hai, are also based on the Partition. Sahni's prolific career as a writer also included six other Hindi novels: Jharokhe (1967), Kadian (1971), Basanti (1979), Mayyadas Ki Madi (1987), Kunto (1993) and Neeloo, Nilima, Nilofar (2000)., over hundred short stories spread over ten collections of short stories, (including Bhagya Rekha (1953), Pahla patha (1956), Bhatakti Raakh (1966), Patrian (1973), Wang Chu (1978), Shobha Yatra (1981), Nishachar (1983), Pali (1989), and Daayan (1996) ; five plays including Hanoosh, Kabira Khada Bazar Mein, Madhavi, Muavze, Alamgeer, a collection of children's short stories Gulal ka keel'. But his novel named Mayyadas Ki Mari (Mayyadas's Castle) was one of his finest literary creation, the backdrop of this narrative is historical and depicts the age when the Khalsa Raj was vanquished in Punjab and the British were taking over. This novel is a saga of changing social order and decadent set of values. He wrote the screenplay for Kumar Shahani's film, Kasba (1991), which is based on Anton Chekhov's story,In the Gully. Although Sahni had been writing stories for a long time, he received recognition as a story writer only after the publication of his story ‚ÄòChief Ki Daawat‚Äô(The Chief‚Äôs Party) in the Kahani magazine in 1956. Bhisham Sahni wrote his autobiography Aaj Ke Ateet (Today's Pasts, Penguin 2016) and the biography of his brother Balraj Sahni, Balraj My Brother (English).Bhishma Sahni at U.S. Library of Congress.

Krishan Baldev Vaid said, \\"His voice, both as a writer and a man, was serene and pure and resonant with humane reassurances. His immense popularity was not a result of any pandering to vulgar tastes but a reward for his literary merits‚Äîhis sharp wit, his gentle irony, his all-pervasive humour, his penetrating insight into character, his mastery as raconteur, and his profound grasp of the yearnings of the human heart.Trailings Of A Lonely Voice. Outlookindia.com (28 July 2003). Retrieved on 2018-11-06. Noted Writer, Nirmal Verma, stated, \\"If we see a long gallery of unmatched characters in his stories and novels, where each person is present with his class and family; pleasures and pains of his town and district; the whole world of perversions and contradictions; it is because the reservoir of his (Bhisham Sahni's) experience was vast and abundant. At the request of his father ‚Äì would anyone believe? ‚Äì he dabbled in business, in which he was a miserable failure. With his high-spirits and passion for life of the common people, he travelled through villages and towns of Punjab with the IPTA theatre group; then began to teach to earn a living; and then lived in the USSR for seven years as a Hindi translator. This sprawling reservoir of experience collected in the hustle-bustle of various occupations ultimately filtered down into his stories and novels, without which, as we realise today, the world of Hindi prose would have been deprived and desolate. The 'simplicity' of his work comes from hard layers of experience, which distinguish and separate it from other works of 'simplified realism. ... \\"Bhisham Sahni is able to express the terrifying tragedy of Partition with an extraordinary compassion in his stories. Amritsar Aa Gaya Hai ('We have reached Amritsar') is one such exceptional work where Bhisham gets away from the external reality and points to the bloody fissures etched on people's psyche. This is possible only for a writer who, in the darkness of historic events has seen the sudden 'accidents' that happen inside human hearts from up close.\\" ... \\"After reading his last collection of stories Daayan (Witch), I was amazed that even after so many years there seemed no repetition or staleness in his writing. Each of his stories seemed to bring something sudden from newer directions, which was as new for him as it was unexpected for us. That Bhisham never paused, never halted in such a long creative journey is a big achievement; but what is bigger perhaps is that his life nurtured his work and his work nurtured his life, both nurtured each other continuously.The Face's Memory, Memory's Face. Outlookindia.com. Translated from Outlook Saptahik, 28 July 2003 Kamleshwar, \\"Bhisham Sahni's name is etched so deeply into the twentieth century of Hindi literature that it cannot be erased. With Independence and till the 11th. July 2003, this name has been synonymous with Hindi story and play writing. Bhisham Sahni had gained such an unmatched popularity that all kinds of readers awaited his new creations and each and every word of his was read. There was no need to ask a general reader if he had read this or that writing by Bhisham. It was possible to begin a sudden discussion on his stories or novels. Such a rare readerly privilege was either available to Premchand or, after Harishankar Parsai, to Bhisham Sahni. This too is rare that the fame he received from Hindi should, during his lifetime, become the fame for Hindi itself.The Light Shall Shine On. Outlookindia.com. Translated from Outlook Saptahik, 28 July 2003 Krishan Baldev Vaid. \\"Bhisham Sahni's last published book, an autobiography with the quiet title Aaj Ke Ateet (The Pasts of the Present), is a beautiful culmination of a lifetime of excellent writing. Apart from giving us an intimate account of some of the salient phases of his life, it epitomises his literary qualities. It is full of fun and insights; it is variegated; it is fair; it is unsmug; it is absorbing; it is also his farewell to his family, his milieu, his readers, and his friends. He begins at the beginning and ends very near the end. The book glows with the sense of ending without, however, any trace of morbidity or self-pity. The early part, where Bhisham tenderly evokes his earliest memories and records his childhood in an affectionate middle-class family in Rawalpindi, is for me the most moving part of this self-portrait. With characteristic elegance and an unfailing eye for the significant detail, the elderly author looks back with nostalgic longing at the world of his childhood and achieves a small but brilliant portrait of the artist as a little child.

A 6'2\\", quarterback from Arizona State, Pagel played in 12 NFL seasons from 1982‚Äì1993. Drafted the same year as Art Schlichter, Pagel was drafted to be groomed as a backup. Generally he out-played Schlichter. Pagel bounced in and out of the starting quarterback job for the Colts in his four seasons with the team, alternating with Schlichter, Matt Kofler, and Mark Herrmann. He was the last Colt to wear #18 before Peyton Manning. He was traded to Cleveland for the 1986 season and served for the next five years there strictly as a backup. In 1988, he took over for an injured Bernie Kosar and Don Strock and played well in a playoff loss to the Houston Oilers. Pagel finished up the last three years with the Los Angeles Rams, never garnering more than mop-up duties. Pagel now resides in suburban Cleveland, Ohio, and is a project manager for AT&T.; He also serves as analyst for the pregame, halftime and postgame shows on WTAM and WMMS during Browns games and offers television color commentary on college games on Fox Sports Network. Pagel also provides video commentary on his own site Pagel On Point. In addition, he presently is the quarterback coach at Normandy High School in Parma, Ohio. Sports is part of the family bloodline; Mike's brother Karl Pagel played baseball for the Chicago Cubs and Cleveland Indians. His brother Rick was a starting defensive end for the United States Naval Academy and served over 20 years as a helicopter pilot in the Marine Corps. Two of his other brothers also played junior college sports. His brother, Bruce, played offensive line at Glendale (AZ) Community College, and is now a professor of political science at Santa Fe College. His brother, Ross, played quarterback for Phoenix College, and later played first base for the college baseball team.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986. History The GAR Building was designed by architect Julius Hess, and constructed at 1942 West Grand River and Cass as an appropriate structure for meetings and other GAR related activities. The cost was split between the Grand Army of the Republic (who paid $6000 of the cost) and the city of Detroit (who paid the remainder of the $44,000 total cost). Construction commenced in 1897 on the five-story building. This Richardsonian Romanesque-designed building lies on a small, triangular lot on the northwest side of downtown Detroit. Originally built for the Grand Army of the Republic members in Detroit, the building included 13 shops and a bank of the ground floor, office space on the second and third floors, and a small auditorium on the fourth floor. As GAR membership dwindled through the beginning part of the 20th century, they were unable to maintain the structure and, by 1934, vacated the building and gave ownership to the city. The GAR Memorial Association, a women's group, used it until 1973. The GAR building was added to the National Register of Historic Places on February 13, 1986. More recently the city attempted to sell the building, but a coalition including the Daughters of Union Veterans of the Civil War and the Sons of Union Veterans of the Civil War brought suit against the city of Detroit to block sale of the building, claiming that a clause in the 1898 deed stated that city must preserve the building as a memorial to Civil War veterans. Redevelopment In 2007, it was reported that the GAR Building had been sold to Olympia Development, an arm of Ilitch Holdings, Inc. for a price of $220,500. Olympia Development expected to renovate the building at a cost of $2 million, but the purchase of the GAR by the Ilitch family was later rescinded. In 2011, the property was then sold to Mindfield USA, a Detroit-based media company, for $220,000. The firm planned to renovate the building for its headquarters. Renovation began immediately after purchase, and Mindfield planned to occupy the top two floors of the structure, lease the ground floor for retail and a restaurant and dedicate a memorial to Civil War Veterans with renovation progress documented on a blog page. The Republic Tavern opened in February 2015 and was named on OpenTable's Top 100 Best Restaurants For Foodies In America in September 2015 and listed on OpenTable's 100 Hottest Restaurants in America in March 2016. Later, the Parks and Rec Diner in an adjacent space.

It was the center of planning, supplies, recruiting and transportation for numerous campaigns, especially in the Western Theater. By the end of the war, Louisville had not been attacked once, although skirmishes and battles, including the battles of Perryville and Corydon, took place nearby. Pre-war developments (1850‚Äì1860) During the 1850s, Louisville became a vibrant and wealthy city, but together with the success, the city also harbored racial and ethnic tensions. It attracted numerous immigrants, had a large slave market from which enslaved African Americans were sold to the Deep South, and had both slaveholders and abolitionists as residents. In 1850 Louisville became the tenth largest city in the United States. Louisville's population rose from 10,000 in 1830 to 43,000 in 1850. It became an important tobacco market and pork packing center. By 1850, Louisville's wholesale trade totaled $20 million (USD) in sales. The Louisville‚ÄìNew Orleans river route held top rank in freight and passenger traffic on the entire Western river system.Yater, p. 61. Not only did Louisville profit from the river, but in August 1855, its citizens greeted the arrival of the locomotive \\"Hart County\\" at Ninth and Broadway and connection to the nation via railroad. The first passengers arrived by train on the Louisville and Frankfort Railroad. James Guthrie, president of the Louisville & Frankfort, pushed the railroad along the Shelbyville turnpike (Frankfort Avenue) through Gilman's Point (St. Matthews) and on to Frankfort. The track entered Louisville on Jefferson Street and ended at Brook Street. The state paid tribute to James Guthrie by naming the small railroad community of Guthrie, Kentucky, in Todd County after him. Leven Shreve, a Louisville civic leader, became the first president of the Louisville and Nashville Railroad (L&N;), which was to prove more important for trade. It led to the developing western states and linked with Mississippi River traffic. With the railroads, Louisville could manufacture furniture and other goods, and export products to Southern cities. Louisville was on her way to becoming an industrial city. The Louisville Rolling Mill built girders and rails, and other factories made cotton machinery, which was sold to Southern customers. Louisville built steamboats. Louisville emerged with an iron-working industry; the plant at Tenth and Main was called Ainslie, Cochran, and Company. Farmington Plantation, one of the larger hemp plantations in Louisville and home to the Speed family, including brothers James Speed and Joshua Fry Speed Louisville also became a meat packing city, becoming the second largest city in the nation to pack pork, butchering an average of 300,000 hogs a year. Louisville led the nation in hemp manufacturing and cotton bagging. Farmington Plantation, owned by John Speed, was one of the larger hemp plantations in Louisville. Hemp was Kentucky's leading agricultural product from 1840 to 1860, and the leading commodity crop of the fertile Bluegrass Region. Jefferson County led all other markets in gardening and orchards. The sales of livestock, quality horses and cattle, was also important. Attracted by jobs and pushed by political unrest and famine, European immigrants flowed into the city from Germany and Ireland; most of them were Catholic, unlike the Protestants who lived in the city. By 1850, 359,980 immigrants arrived in the United States, and by 1854, 427,833 immigrants arrived to seek out a new living. With the increase in new immigrants in the city, native Louisville residents felt threatened by change, and began to express anti-foreign, anti-Catholic sentiments. In 1841, the growth in population prompted the Catholic archdiocese to move the bishop's seat from Bardstown to Louisville. The archdiocese began construction on a new Catholic cathedral, which was completed in 1852. This asserted Catholic presence in the city. In 1843, a new political party arose, called the American Republican Party. On July 5, 1845, the American Republican party changed their name to the Native American Party and held their first national convention in Philadelphia. The party opposed liberal immigration policies. On June 17, 1854, the Order of the Star Spangled Banner held its second national convention in New York City. The members were \\"native Americans\\" and anti- Catholic. When the members answered questions about the group, they responded with \\"I know nothing about it,\\" giving rise to the nickname Know-Nothing for the Native American Party. The new political party gained national support. The Know-Nothing party encouraged and tapped into the nation's prejudice and fears that Catholic immigrants would take control of the United States. Hostility to Catholics had a long history based on national rivalries in Europe. By 1854, the Know-Nothings gained control of Jefferson County's government. Ethnic tension came to a boil in 1855, during the mayor's office election. On August 6, 1855, \\"Bloody Monday\\" erupted, in which Protestant mobs bullied immigrants away from the polls and began rioting in Irish and German neighborhoods. Protestant mobs attacked and killed at least twenty-two people. The rioting began at Shelby and Green Street (Liberty) and progressed through the city's East End. After burning houses on Shelby Street, the mob headed for William Ambruster's brewery in the triangle between Baxter Avenue and Liberty Street. They set the place ablaze and ten Germans died in the fire. When the mob burned Quinn's Irish Row on the North side of Main between Eleventh and Twelfth Streets, some tenants died in the fire; the mob shot and killed others. The Know-Nothing party won the election in Louisville and many other Kentucky counties. Historical marker at the corner of Second and Main in downtown Louisville, describing the slave trade As in other cities, slavery was a consuming topic; some of Louisville's economy was built on its thriving slave market. Slave traders' revenues, and those from feeding, clothing and transporting the slaves to the Deep South, all contributed to the city's economy. The direct use of slaves as labor in the central Kentucky economy had lessened by 1850. But throughout the 1850s, the state slaveholders sold 2500-4000 slaves annually downriver to the Deep South. Slave pens were located on Second between Market and Main Streets. The Kansas‚ÄìNebraska Act of 1854 added to the controversy, as it threatened potentially lucrative expansion of slavery to western states. Louisville also had a free black population, among whom some managed to acquire property. Washington Spradling, freed from slavery in 1814, became a barber. By the 1850s, he owned real estate valued at $30,000. With its agriculture, shipping trade and industry, and slave markets, Louisville was a city that shared in cultures of both the agricultural South and the industrial North. The eve of war (1860) In the November 1860 Presidential election, Kentucky voters gave native Kentuckian Abraham Lincoln less than one percent of the vote. Kentuckians did not like Lincoln, because he stood for the eradication of slavery and his Republican Party aligned itself with the North. But, neither did they vote for native son John C. Breckinridge and his Southern Democratic Party, generally regarded as secessionists. In 1860, people in the state held 225,000 slaves, with Louisville's slaves comprising 7.5 percent of the population. The voters wanted both to keep slavery and stay in the Union. Most Kentuckians, including residents of Louisville, voted for John Bell of Tennessee, of the Constitutional Union Party. It stood for preserving the Union and keeping the status quo on slavery. Others voted for Stephen Douglas of Illinois, who ran for the Democratic Party ticket. Louisville cast 3,823 votes for John Bell. Douglas received 2,633 votes. On December 20, 1860, South Carolina seceded from the Union, and ten other Southern states followed. Kentucky, however, remained in the Union. War breaks out (1861) Union Major Robert Anderson, Louisvillian, commander of Fort Sumter at the beginning of the Civil War On April 12, 1861, Confederate Brigadier General Pierre G. T. Beauregard ordered the firing on Fort Sumter, located in the Charleston harbor, thus starting the Civil War. At the time of the Battle of Fort Sumter, the fort's commander was Union Major Robert Anderson of Louisville. After the attack on Fort Sumter, President of the United States Abraham Lincoln called for 75,000 volunteers. Kentucky Governor Beriah Magoffin refused to send any men to act against the Southern states, and both Unionists and secessionists supported his position. On April 17, 1861, Louisville hoped to remain neutral and spent $50,000 for the defense of the city, naming Lovell Rousseau as brigadier general. Rousseau formed the Home Guard. When Unionists asked Lincoln for help, he secretly sent arms to the Home Guard. The U. S. government sent a shipment of weapons to Louisville and kept the rifles hidden in the basement of the Jefferson County Courthouse. Louisville residents were divided as to which side they should support. Economic interests and previous relationships often determined alliances. Prominent Louisville attorney James Speed, brother of Lincoln's close friend Joshua Fry Speed, strongly advocated keeping the state in the Union. Louisville Main Street wholesale merchants, who had extensive trade with the South, often supported the Confederacy. Blue-collar workers, small retailers, and professional men, such as lawyers, supported the Union. On April 20, two companies of Confederate volunteers left by steamboat for New Orleans, and five days later, three more companies departed for Nashville on the L & N Railroad. Union recruiters raised troops at Eighth and Main, and the Union recruits left for Indiana to join other Union regiments. Union General Lovell Rousseau On May 20, 1861, Kentucky declared its neutrality. An important state geographically, Kentucky had the Ohio River as a natural barrier. Kentucky's natural resources, manpower, and the L&N; Railroad made both the North and South respect Kentucky's neutrality. President Lincoln and Confederate President Jefferson Davis both maintained hands-off policies when dealing with Kentucky, hoping not to push the state into one camp or the other. From the L&N; depot on Ninth and Broadway in Louisville and the steamboats at Louisville wharfs, supporters of the Confederacy sent uniforms, lead, bacon, coffee and war material south. Although Lincoln did not want to upset Kentucky's neutrality, on July 10, 1861, a federal judge in Louisville ruled that the United States government had the right to stop shipments of goods from going south over the L&N; railroad. On July 15, 1861, the War Department authorized United States Navy Lieutenant William \\"Bull\\" Nelson to establish a training camp and organize a brigade of infantry. Nelson commissioned William J. Landram, a colonel of cavalry; and Theophilus T. Garrard, Thomas E. Bramlette, and Speed S. Fry colonels of infantry. Landram turned his commission over to Lieutenant Colonel Frank Wolford. When Garrard, Bramlette, and Fry established their camps at Camp Dick Robinson in Garrard County, and Wolford erected his camp near Harrodsburg, Kentucky's neutrality effectively ended.Beach, p. 16-17. Brigadier General Rousseau established a Union training camp opposite Louisville in Jeffersonville, Indiana, naming the camp after Joseph Holt. Governor Magoffin protested to Lincoln about the Union camps, but he ignored Magoffin, stating that the will of the people wanted the camps to remain in Kentucky.Beach, p. 18. In August 1861, Kentucky held elections for the State General Assembly, and Unionists won majorities in both houses. Residents of Louisville continued to be divided on the issue of which side to join. The Louisville Courier was very much pro-Confederate, while the Louisville Journal was pro-Union. On September 4, 1861, Confederate General Leonidas Polk, outraged by Union intrusions in the state, invaded Columbus, Kentucky. As a result of the Confederate invasion, Union General Ulysses S. Grant entered Paducah, Kentucky. Jefferson Davis allowed Confederate troops to stay in Kentucky. General Albert Sidney Johnston, commander of all Confederate forces in the West, sent General Simon Bolivar Buckner of Kentucky to invade Bowling Green, Kentucky. Union forces in Kentucky saw Buckner's move toward Bowling Green as the beginning of a massive attack on Louisville. With twenty thousand troops, Johnston established a defensive line stretching from Columbus in western Kentucky to the Cumberland Gap, controlled by Confederate General Felix Zollicoffer. On September 7, the Kentucky State legislature, angered by the Confederate invasion, ordered the Union flag to be raised over the state capitol in Frankfort and declared its allegiance with the Union. The legislature also passed the \\"Non-Partisan Act\\", which stated that \\"any person or any person's family that joins or aids the so-called Confederate Army was no longer a citizen of the Commonwealth.\\"Beach, p. 20. The legislature denied any member of the Confederacy the right to land, titles or money held in Kentucky or the right to legal redress for action taken against them. 49th Ohio Regiment arrives in Louisville in October 1861 With Confederate troops in Bowling Green, Union General Robert Anderson moved his headquarters to Louisville. Union General George McClellan appointed Anderson as military commander for the District of Kentucky on June 4, 1861. On September 9, the Kentucky legislature asked Anderson to be made commander of the Federal military force in Kentucky. The Union army accepted the Louisville Legion at Camp Joe Holt in Indiana into the regular army. Louisville mayor John M. Delph sent two thousand men to build defenses around the city. On October 8, Anderson stepped down as commander of the Department of the Cumberland and Union General William Tecumseh Sherman took charge of the Home Guard. Lovell Rousseau sent the Louisville Legion along with another two thousand men across the river to protect the city. Sherman wrote to his superiors that he needed 200,000 men to take care of Johnston's Confederates. The Louisville Legion and the Home Guard marched out to meet Buckner's forces, but Buckner did not approach Louisville. Buckner's men destroyed the bridge over the Rolling Fork River in Lebanon Junction and with the mission completed, Buckner's men returned to Bowling Green. Louisville became a staging ground for Union troops heading south. Union troops flowed into Louisville from Ohio, Indiana, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. White tents and training grounds sprang up at the Oakland track, Old Louisville and Portland. Camps were also established at Eighteenth and Broadway, and along the Frankfort and Bardstown turnpikes. Louisville under threats of attack (1862‚Äì63) Ohio troops arrive at Louisville's wharf By early 1862, Louisville had 80,000 Union troops throughout the city. With so many troops, entrepreneurs set up gambling establishments along the north side of Jefferson from 4th to 5th Street, extending around the corner from 5th to Market, then continuing on the south side of Market back to 4th Street. Photography studios and military goods shops, such as Fletcher & Bennett on Main Street, catered to the Union officers and soldiers. Also capitalizing on the troops, brothels were quickly opened around the city. In January 1862, Union General George Thomas defeated Confederate General Felix Zollicoffer at the Battle of Mill Springs, Kentucky. In February 1862, Union General Ulysses Grant and Admiral Andrew Foote's gunboats captured Fort Henry and Fort Donelson on the Kentucky and Tennessee border. Confederate General Albert Sidney Johnston's defensive line in Kentucky crumbled rapidly. Johnston had no choice but to fall back to Nashville, Tennessee. No defensive preparations had been made at Nashville, so Johnson continued to fall back to Corinth, Mississippi. Union General Don Carlos Buell Although the threat of invasion by Confederates subsided, Louisville remained a staging area for Union supplies and troops heading south. By May 1862, the steamboats arrived and departed at the wharf in Louisville with their cargoes. Military contractors in Louisville provided the Union army with two hundred head of cattle each day, and the pork packers provided thousands of hogs daily. Trains departed for the south along the L&N; railroad. In July 1862, Confederate generals Braxton Bragg, commander of the Army of Mississippi, and Edmund Kirby Smith, commander of the Army of East Tennessee, planned an invasion of Kentucky. On August 13, Smith marched with 9,000 men out of Knoxville toward western Kentucky and arrived in Barbourville. On August 20, Smith announced that he would take Lexington. On August 28, Bragg's army moved west. At the Battle of Richmond, Kentucky, on August 30, Smith's Confederate forces defeated Union General William \\"Bull\\" Nelson's troops, capturing the entire force. This left Kentucky with no Union support. Nelson managed to escape back to Louisville. Smith marched into Lexington and sent a Confederate cavalry force to take Frankfort: Kentucky's capitol. Buell's Army arrives in Louisville September 25, 1862; a week later Buell led 60,000 troops to fight at the Battle of Perryville Union General Don Carlos Buell's army withdrew from Alabama and headed back to Kentucky. Union General Henry Halleck, commander of all Union forces in the West, sent two divisions from General Ulysses Grant's army, stationed in Mississippi, to Buell. Confederate General John Hunt Morgan, of Lexington, Kentucky, managed to destroy the L&N; railroad tunnel at Gallatin, Tennessee, cutting off all supplies to Buell's Union army. On September 5, Buell reached Murfreesboro, Tennessee, and headed for Nashville. On September 14, Bragg reached Glasgow, Kentucky. On that same day, Buell reached Bowling Green, Kentucky. Bragg decided to take Louisville. One of the major objectives of the Confederate campaign in Kentucky was to seize the Louisville and Portland Canal and sever Union supply routes on the Ohio River. One Confederate officer suggested destroying the Louisville canal so completely that \\"future travelers would hardly know where it was.\\" On September 16, Bragg's army reached Munfordville, Kentucky. Col. James Chalmers attacked the Federal garrison at Munfordville, but Bragg had to bail him out. Bragg arrived at Munfordville with his entire force, and the Union force soon surrendered. Buell left Bowling Green and headed for Louisville. Fearing that Buell would not arrive in Louisville to prevent Bragg's army from capturing the city, Union General William \\"Bull\\" Nelson ordered the construction of a hasty defensive line around the city. He also ordered the placement of pontoon bridges across the Ohio to facilitate the evacuation of the city or to receive reinforcements from Indiana. Two pontoon bridges built of coal barges were erected, one at the location of the Big Four Bridge, and the other from Portland to New Albany. The Union Army arrived in time to prevent the Confederate seizure of the city. On September 25, Buell's tired and hungry men arrived in the city. Bragg moved his army to Bardstown but did not take Louisville. Bragg urged General Smith to join his forces to take Louisville, but Smith told him to take Louisville on his own. Citizens evacuate Louisville after Union General William \\"Bull\\" Nelson issues an order With the Confederate army under Bragg preparing to attack Louisville, the citizens of Louisville panicked. On September 22, 1862, General Nelson issued an evacuation order: \\"The women and children of this city will prepare to leave the city without delay.\\" He ordered the Jeffersonville ferry to be used for military purposes only. Private vehicles were not allowed to go aboard the ferry boats without a special permit. Hundreds of Louisville residents gathered at the wharf for boats to New Albany or Jeffersonville. With Frankfort in Confederate hands for about a month, Governor Magoffin maintained his office in Louisville and the state legislature held their sessions in the Jefferson County Courthouse. Troops, volunteers and impressed labor worked around the clock to build a ring of breastworks and entrenchments around the city. New Union regiments flowed into the city. General William \\"Bull\\" Nelson took charge of the defense of Louisville. He sent Union troops to build pontoon bridges at Jeffersonville and New Albany to speed up the arrival of reinforcements, supplies and, if needed, the emergency evacuation of the city. Union General William \\"Bull\\" Nelson Instead of taking Louisville, Bragg left Bardstown to install Confederate Governor Richard Hawes at Frankfort. On September 26, five hundred Confederate cavalrymen rode into the area of Eighteenth and Oak, capturing fifty Union soldiers. Confederates placed pickets around Middletown on the 26th, and on the 27th their soldiers repelled Union forces from Middletown near Shelbyville Pike.White, p. 11. Southern forces reached two miles from the city, but were not numerous enough to invade it. On September 30, Confederate and Union pickets fought at Gilman's Point in St. Matthews and pushed the Confederates back through Middletown to Floyd's Fork.White, pp. 20, 36. The War Department ordered \\"Bull\\" Nelson to command the newly formed Army of the Ohio. When Louisville prepared for the Confederate army under Bragg, General Jefferson C. Davis (not to be confused with Confederate President Jefferson Davis), who could not reach his command under General Don Carlos Buell, met with General Nelson to offer his services. General Nelson gave him the command of the city militia. General Davis opened an office and assisted organizing the city militia. On Wednesday, General Davis visited General Nelson in his room at the Galt House. General Davis told General Nelson that his brigade he assigned Davis was ready for service and asked if he could obtain arms for them. This led to an argument in which Nelson threatened Davis with arrest. General Davis left the room, and, in order to avoid arrest, crossed over the river to Jeffersonville, where he remained until the next day, when General Stephen G. Burbridge joined him. General Burbridge had also been relieved of command by General Nelson for a trivial cause. General Davis went to Cincinnati with General Burbridge and reported to General Wright, who ordered General Davis to return to Louisville and report to General Buell, and General Burbridge to remain in Cincinnati. Union Gen. Jefferson C. Davis shoots Union Gen. William \\"Bull\\" Nelson on the steps of the Galt House General Davis returned to Louisville and reported to Buell. When General Davis saw General Nelson in the main hall of the Galt House, fronting the office, he asked the Governor of Indiana, Oliver Morton to witness the conversation between him and General Nelson. The Governor agreed and the two walked up to General Nelson. General Davis confronted General Nelson and told him that he took advantage of his authority. Their argument escalated and Nelson slapped Davis in the face, challenging him to a duel. In three minutes, Davis returned, with a pistol he had borrowed, and shot and killed Nelson. The General whispered: \\"It's all over,\\" and died fifteen minutes later.The Murder of General Nelson, Harper's Weekly, October 18, 1862. With General Nelson dead, the command switched over to General Don Carlos Buell. On October 1, the Union army marched out of Louisville with sixty thousand men. Buell sent a small Federal force to Frankfort to deceive Bragg as to the exact direction and location of the Federal army. The ruse worked. On October 4, the small Federal force attacked Frankfort and Bragg left the city and headed back for Bardstown, thinking the entire Federal force was headed for Frankfort. Bragg decided that all Confederate forces should concentrate at Harrodsburg, Kentucky, ten miles (16 km) northwest of Danville. On October 8, 1862, Buell and Bragg fought at Perryville, Kentucky. Bragg's 16,000 men attacked Buell's 60,000 men. Federal forces suffered 845 dead, 2,851 wounded and 515 missing, while the Confederate toll was 3,396. Although Bragg won the Battle of Perryville tactically, he wisely decided to pull out of Perryville and link up with Smith. Once Smith and Bragg joined forces, Bragg decided to leave Kentucky and head for Tennessee. After the battle, thousands of wounded men flooded into Louisville. Hospitals were set up in public schools, homes, factories and churches. The Fifth Ward School, built at 5th and York Streets in 1855, became Military Hospital Number Eight. The United States Marine Hospital also became a hospital for the wounded Union soldiers from the battle of Perryville. Constructed between 1845 and 1852, the three-story Greek revival style Louisville Marine Hospital contained one hundred beds. It became the prototype for seven U.S. Marine Hospital Service buildings, including Paducah, Kentucky, which later became Fort Anderson. Union surgeons erected the Brown General Hospital, located near the Belknap campus of the University of Louisville, and other hospitals were erected at Jeffersonville and New Albany, Indiana. By early 1863, the War Department and the U.S. Sanitary Commission erected nineteen hospitals. By early June 1863, 930 deaths had been recorded in the Louisville hospitals. Cave Hill Cemetery set aside plots for the Union dead. Louisville also had to contend with Confederate prisoners. Located at the corner of Green Street and 5th Street, the Union Army Prison, also called the \\"Louisville Military Prison\\", took over the old \\"Medical College building.\\" Union authorities moved the prison near the corner of 10th and Broadway Streets. By August 27, 1862, Confederate prisoners of war were taken to the new military prison. The old facility continued to house new companies of Provost Guards. From October 1, 1862, to December 14, 1862, the new Louisville Military Prison housed 3,504 prisoners. In December 1863, the prison held over 2,000 men, including political prisoners, Union deserters, and Confederate prisoners of war. Made of wood, the prison covered an entire city block, stretching from east to west between 10th and 11th Streets and north to south between Magazine and Broadway Streets. Its main entrance was located on Broadway near 10th Street. A high fence surrounded the prison with at least two prison barracks. The prison hospital was attached to the prison and consisted of two barracks on the south and west sides of the square with forty beds in each building. The Union commander at the Louisville Military Prison was Colonel Dent. In April 1863, Captain Stephen E. Jones succeeded him. In October 1863, military authorities replaced Captain Jones with C. B. Pratt.Head, pp. 155-158. A block away, Union authorities took over a large house on Broadway between 12th and 13th Streets and converted it into a military prison for women. Historical marker noting Morgan's activities at Brandenburg, Kentucky, where his forces captured two steamboats, the John B. McCombs and the Alice Dean, before crossing the Ohio River into Indiana =Emancipation Proclamation= On September 22, 1862, President Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation, which declared that as of January 1, 1863, all slaves in the rebellion states would be free. Although this did not affect slaveholding in Kentucky at the time, owners felt threatened. Some Kentucky Union soldiers, including Colonel Frank Wolford of the 1st Kentucky Cavalry, quit the army in protest of freeing the slaves. The proclamation presaged an end to slavery. So many slaves arrived at the Union camp that the Army set up a contraband camp to accommodate them. The Reverend Thomas James, an African Methodist Episcopal minister from New York, supervised activities at the camp and set up a church and school for the refugees. Both adults and children started learning to read. Under direction by generals Stephen G. Burbridge and John M. Palmer, James monitored conditions at prisons and could call on US troops to protect slaves from being held illegally, which he did several times.James, Thomas. Life of Rev. Thomas James, by Himself, Rochester, N.Y.: Post Express Printing Company, 1886, at Documenting the American South, University of North Carolina, accessed June 3, 2010. The Union's recruitment of slaves into the army (which gained them freedom) turned some slaveholders in Kentucky against the US government. In later years, the depredations of guerrilla warfare in the state, together with Union measures to try to suppress it, and the excesses of General Burbridge as military governor of Kentucky, were probably more significant in alienating more citizens. Civic rights were overridden during the crisis. These issues turned many against the Republican administration. After the war ended, the Democrats regained power in central and western Kentucky, which the former slaveholders and their culture dominated. Because this area was the more populous and the Democrats also passed legislation essentially disfranchising freedmen, the white Democrats controlled politics in the state and sent mostly their representatives to Congress for a century.Pildes, Richard H., \\"Democracy, Anti-Democracy, and the Canon\\", Constitutional Commentary, Vol.17, 2000, pp. 12-13, accessed March 10, 2008. In the mid-1960s, the federal Civil Rights Act and Voting Rights Act ended legal segregation of public facilities and protected voting rights of minorities. The Taylor Barracks at Third and Oak in Louisville recruited black soldiers for the United States Colored Troops. Slaves gained freedom in exchange for service to the Union. Slave women married to USCT men received freedom, as well. To secure legal freedom for the many slave women arriving alone at the contraband camp, Burbridge directed James to marry them to available USCT soldiers, if both parties were willing. Black Union soldiers who died in service were buried in Louisville's Eastern Cemetery. In the Summer of 1863, Confederate John Hunt Morgan violated orders and led his famous raid into Ohio and Indiana to give the northern states a taste of the war. He traveled with his troops through north-central Kentucky, trekking from Bardstown to Garnettsville, a now defunct town in Otter Creek Park. They took the Lebanon garrison, capturing hundreds of Union soldiers and then releasing them on parole. Before crossing the Ohio River into Indiana, Morgan and his crew arrived in Brandenburg, where they proceeded to capture two steamers, the John B. McCombs and the Alice Dean; the Alice Dean burned after their crossing. After the fall of New Orleans and the capture of Vicksburg, Mississippi, on July 4, 1863, the Mississippi and Ohio Rivers were open to Union boats without harassment. On December 24, 1863, a steamboat from New Orleans reached Louisville. In late 1863, General Hugh Ewing, brother-in-law to General Sherman, was appointed Military Commander of Louisville. Military rule (1864) Widespread guerrilla warfare in the state meant a widespread breakdown in the society, causing residents to suffer. In Kentucky, the Union defined a guerrilla as any member of the Confederate army who destroyed supplies, equipment or money. On January 12, 1864, Union General Stephen G. Burbridge, formerly supervising Louisville, succeeded General Jeremiah Boyle as Military Commander of Kentucky. On February 4, 1864, at the Galt House, Union generals Ulysses S. Grant, William S. Rosecrans, George Stoneman, Thomas L. Crittenden, James S. Wadsworth, David Hunter, John Schofield, Alexander McCook, Robert Allen, George Thomas, Stephen Burbridge and Read Admiral David Porter met to discuss the most important campaign of the war. It would divide the Confederacy into three parts. In a follow-up meeting on March 19, generals Grant and William Tecumseh Sherman met at the Galt House to plan the Spring campaign. (, that these meetings actually occurred has fallen into dispute.) Grant took on Confederate General Robert E. Lee at Richmond and Sherman confronted General Joseph E. Johnston, capturing Atlanta, Georgia, in the process. Jefferson General Hospital in Port Fulton, Indiana, across the Ohio River from Louisville On February 21, 1864, Jefferson General Hospital, the third-largest hospital during the Civil War, was established across the Ohio River at Port Fulton, Indiana, to tend to soldiers injured due to the war. On July 5, 1864, President Abraham Lincoln temporarily suspended the writ of habeas corpus, which meant a person could be imprisoned without trial, his house searched without warrant, and the individual arrested without charge. Lincoln also declared martial law in Kentucky, which meant that military authorities had the ultimate rule. Civilians accused of crimes would be tried not in a civilian court, but instead a military court, in which the citizen's rights were not held as under the Constitution. On the same day, General Burbridge was appointed military governor of Kentucky with absolute authority.Beach, pp. 154-156. On July 16, 1864, Burbridge issued Order No. 59: \\"Whenever an unarmed Union citizen is murdered, four guerrillas will be selected from the prison and publicly shot to death at the most convenient place near the scene of the outrages.\\"Beach, p. 177. On August 7, Burbridge issued Order No. 240 in which Kentucky became a military district under his direct command. Burbridge could seize property without trial from persons he deemed disloyal. He could also execute suspects without trial or question. Map of Louisville in 1864, showing 11 forts and other defenses. View to the south: Kentucky is \\"above\\" the river, Indiana below. During the months of July and August, Burbridge initiated building more fortifications in Kentucky, although Sherman's march through Georgia effectively reduced the Confederate threat to Kentucky. Burbridge received permission from Union General John Schofield to build fortifications in Mount Sterling, Lexington, Frankfort and Louisville. Each location was to have a small enclosed field work of about two hundred yards along the interior crest, except for Louisville, which would be five hundred yards. Other earthworks were planned to follow in Louisville. All the works were to be built by soldiers, except at Frankfort, where the state would assign workers, and at Louisville, where the city would manage it. Lt. Colonel. J. H, Simpson, of the Federal Engineers, furnished the plans and engineering force. General Hugh Ewing, Union commander in Louisville Eleven forts protected the city in a ring about ten miles (16 km) long from Beargrass Creek to Paddy's Run. The first work built was Fort McPherson, which commanded the approaches to the city via the Shepherdsville Pike, Third Street Road, and the Louisville & Nashville Railroad. The fort was to serve as a citadel if an attack came before the other forts were completed. The fort could house one thousand men. General Hugh Ewing, Union commander in Louisville, directing that municipal authorities furnish laborers for fortifications, ordered the arrest of all \\"loafers found about gambling and other disreputable establishments\\" in the city for construction work, and assigned military convicts as laborers. It was typical of military commanders to press citizens into service. Each fort was a basic earth-and-timber structure surrounded by a ditch with a movable drawbridge at the entrance to the fort. Each was furnished with an underground magazine to house two hundred rounds of artillery shells. The eleven forts occupied the most commanding positions to provide interlocking cross fire between them. A supply of entrenching tools was collected and stored for emergency construction of additional batteries and infantry entrenchments between the fortifications. As it happened, the guns in the Louisville forts were never fired except for salutes. With orders No. 59 and No. 240, Burbridge began a campaign to suppress guerrilla activity in Kentucky and Louisville. On August 11, Burbridge commanded Captain Hackett of the 26th Kentucky to select four men to be taken from prison in Louisville to Eminence, Henry County, Kentucky, to be shot for unidentified outrages. On August 20, suspected Confederate guerrillas J. H. Cave and W. B. McClasshan were taken from Louisville to Franklin, Simpson County, to be shot for an unidentified reason. The commanding officer General Ewing declared that Cave was innocent and sought a pardon from Burbridge, but he refused. Both men were shot.Beach, p. 184. Louisvillian and pro-Union activist James Speed, brother of Abraham Lincoln's close friend Joshua Fry Speed, becomes Lincoln's second Attorney General On October 25, Burbridge ordered four men, Wilson Lilly, Sherwood Hartley, Captain Lindsey Dale Buckner and M. Bincoe, to be shot by Captain Rowland Hackett of Company B, 26th Kentucky for the alleged killing of a postal carrier near Brunerstown (present day Jeffersontown). This was in retaliation for the killing by guerrillas allegedly led by Captain Marcellus Jerome Clarke, sometimes called \\"Sue Mundy\\". On November 6, two men named Cheney and Morris were taken from the prison in Louisville and transported to Munfordville and shot in retaliation for the killing of Madison Morris, of Company A, 13th Kentucky Infantry. James Hopkins, John Simple and Samuel Stingle were taken from Louisville to Bloomfield, Nelson County, and shot in retaliation for the alleged guerrilla shooting of two black men. On November 15, two Confederate soldiers were taken from prison in Louisville to Lexington and hung at the Fair Grounds in retaliation. On November 19, eight men were taken from Louisville to Munfordville to be shot for retaliation for the killing of two Union men.Beach, pp. 198, 201, 202. By the end of 1864, Burbridge ordered the arrest of twenty-one prominent Louisville citizens, plus the chief justice of the State Court of Appeals, on treason charges. He had captured guerrillas brought to Louisville and hanged on Broadway at 15th or 18th Streets. General Ewing was effectively out of the loop and often bedridden from attacks of rheumatism. As he was ordered to rejoin his brother- in-law General Sherman, Ewing has escaped the condemnation of Burbridge's actions in Louisville. By the November elections of 1864, Burbridge tried to interfere with the election for President. Despite military interference, Kentucky citizens voted overwhelmingly for Union General George B. McClellan over Lincoln. Twelve counties were not allowed to post their returns.Beach, p. 202. In December 1864, President Lincoln appointed James Speed as the U.S. Attorney General. War comes to a close (1865‚Äì66) Much more detailed image of Louisville's Civil War forts in June 1865. Click to view in detail. Although the Confederacy began to fall apart in January 1865, Burbridge continued executing guerrillas. On January 20, 1865, Nathaniel Marks, formerly of Company A, 4th Kentucky, C.S. was condemned as a guerrilla. He claimed his innocence, but was shot by a firing squad in Louisville. On February 10, Burbridge's term as military governor came to an end. Secretary of War Edwin Stanton replaced Burbridge with Major General John Palmer. On March 12, Union forces captured 20-year-old Captain M. Jerome Clarke, the alleged \\"Sue Mundy\\", along with Henry Medkiff and Henry C. Magruder, ten miles (16 km) south of Brandenburg near Breckinridge County. The Union Army hanged Clarke three days later just west of the corner of 18th and Broadway in Louisville, after a military trial in which he was charged as a guerrilla. During the secret three-hour trial, Clarke was not allowed counsel or witnesses for his defense, although he asked to be treated as a prisoner of war. Magruder was allowed to recover from war injuries before being executed by hanging on October 29.Vest, Stephen M., \\"Was She or Wasn't He?,\\" Kentucky Living, November 1995, pp. 25-26, 42. On April 9, Confederate General Robert E. Lee surrendered to Union General Ulysses Grant, and on April 14, Confederate General Joseph Johnston surrendered to Union General William T. Sherman, ending the Civil War. On May 15, Louisville became a mustering-out center for troops from midwestern and western states. On June 4, 1865, military authorities established the headquarters of the Union Armies of the West in Louisville. During June 1865, 96,796 troops and 8,896 animals left Washington, D.C., for the Ohio Valley. There 70,000 men took steamboats to Louisville and the remainder embarked for St. Louis and Cincinnati. The troops boarded ninety-two steamboats at Parkersburg and descended the river in convoys of eight boats, to the sounds of cheering crowds and booming cannon salutes at every port city. For several weeks, Union soldiers crowded Louisville. On July 4, 1865, Union General William T. Sherman visited Louisville to conduct a final inspection of the Armies of the West. By mid-July the Armies of the West disbanded and the soldiers headed home. It is important to take note that due to the Emancipation Proclamation, the severity of Martial Law under Burbridge and the enlistment of Kentucky slaves into Union regiments (Kentucky had the 2nd largest African American Union enlistment only behind Louisiana) Union support among native Kentuckians greatly diminished by war's end. This is documented in Louisville by a prominent Washington DC journalist, Whitelaw Reid who accompanied Chief Justice Salmon P. Chase for a tour of the south from May 1, 1865, to May 1, 1866 . Reid observed in 1865 ‚ÄúAt Louisville a pleasant dinner party enabled us to meet the last collection of men from the midst of a Rebel community. At that time there was more loyalty in Nashville than in Louisville, and about as much in Charleston as in either. For the first and only time on the trip, save while we were under the Spanish flag, slaves waited on us at dinner. They were the last any of us were ever to see on American soil.‚Äù This sentiment is also evident in the daily violence between Louisville citizens and the Union soldiers mustering out of the city to their home states during this period in what was known as the ‚Äúwar after the war‚Äù throughout the state.After the War: A Southern Tour, by Whitelaw ReidCourier Journal \\"Thanksgiving 1866: Ky's wounds of war unhealed\\" Nov. 21, 2016 On December 18, the Kentucky legislature repealed the Expatriation Act of 1861, allowing all who served in the Confederacy to have their full Kentucky citizenship restored without fear of retribution. The legislature also repealed the law that defined any person who was a member of the Confederacy as guilty of treason. The Kentucky legislature allowed former Confederates to run for office. On February 28, 1866, Kentucky officially declared the war over.Beach, p. 228. Post-war Confederate Monument, adjacent to and surrounded by the University of Louisville Belknap Campus. Due to political pressures, the monument was relocated to Brandenburg in 2016. After the war, Louisville returned to growth, with an increase in manufacturing, establishment of new factories, and transporting goods by train. The new industrial jobs attracted both black rural workers, including freedmen from the South, and foreign immigrants. It was a city of opportunity for them. Ex- Confederate officers entered law, insurance, real estate and political offices, largely taking control of the city. This led to the jibe that Louisville joined the Confederacy after the war was over. Women sympathizing with the Confederacy organized many groups, including in Kentucky. During the postwar years, Confederate women ensured the burial of the dead, including sometimes allocating certain cemeteries or sections to Confederate veterans, and raised money to build memorials to the war and their losses. By the 1890s, the memorial movement came under the control of the United Daughters of the Confederacy (UDC) and United Confederate Veterans (UCV), who promoted the \\"Lost Cause\\". Making meaning after the war was another way of writing its history.Blight, David, Race and Reunion: Civil War in American Memory, Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 2001, pp. 258-260. In 1895, the women's group supported the erection of a Confederate monument near the University of Louisville campus. ‚ÄúThe Lost Cause‚Äù movement in Louisville primarily occurred between 1865 and 1935. This is due to most native Kentuckians coming to regret their decision to support the Union due to the war's upending of the antebellum racial and social hierarchy in Kentucky. One of the most notable personalities of Louisville during this time was that of Henry Watterson, a Confederate veteran and editor in chief of the newly formed Courier-Journal (1868). He was a major proponent of the New South Creed which emphasized a vision of a prosperous and independent South within an expanding American empire. He is the person who coined Louisville as being ‚ÄúThe Gateway to the South‚Äù. Watterson was one of the most important and widely read newspaper editors in American history. In the late 19th Century The Courier Journal had the largest circulation of any paper outside of New York and was the paper of record for Kentucky and that of the entire south. The Courier Journal had four times the circulation of fellow New South advocate Henry Grady's Atlanta Constitution.Creating a Confederate Kentucky: The Lost Cause and Civil War Memory in a Border State Book by Anne Elizabeth MarshallHenry Watterson and the New South: The Politics of Empire, Free Trade, and Globalization Civil War defenses of Louisville (1864‚Äì65) Around 1864‚Äì65, city defenses, including eleven forts ordered by Union General Stephen G. Burbridge, formed a ring about ten miles (16 km) long from Beargrass Creek to Paddy's Run. Nothing remains of these constructions. They included, from east to west: *Fort Elstner between Frankfort Ave. and Brownsboro Road, near Bellaire, Vernon and Emerald Aves. *Fort Engle at Spring Street and Arlington Ave. *Fort Saunders at Cave Hill Cemetery. *Battery Camp Fort Hill (2) (1865) between Goddard Ave., Barrett and Baxter Streets, and St. Louis Cemetery. *Fort Horton at Shelby and Merriweather Streets (now site of city incinerator plant). *Fort McPherson on Preston Street, bounded by Barbee, Brandeis, Hahn and Fort Streets. *Fort Philpot at Seventh Street and Algonquin Parkway. *Fort St. Clair Morton at 16th and Hill Streets. *Fort Karnasch on Wilson Ave. between 26th and 28th Streets. *Fort Clark (1865) at 36th and Magnolia Streets. *Battery Gallup (1865) at Gibson Lane and 43rd Street. *Fort Southworth on Paddy's Run at the Ohio River (now site of city sewage treatment plant). Marker at 4522 Algonquin Parkway. Also in the area were Camp Gilbert (1862) and Camp C. F. Smith (1862), both at undetermined locations.

Set in a mock World War II environment, the game has online capabilities, and was released to mediocre reviews and criticism. Plot During World War II, the Saruvian Empire invades and conquers the entire mainland of the United Sovereign Territories and only the southernmost island of Johnstown is free. The UST is able to build a small fort on a deserted island between the two nations though and use it to harass enemy supply lines. The UST is a fictional nation standing in for the United States, using all US weapons and medals. The Saruvian Empire is a fictional nation standing in for Germany, using all World War II era German weapons, uniforms, names, and political terms. Gameplay As a tiny island outpost lying directly in the path of the supply line that the Saruvian Empire is using to invade his country, the player and his allies must defend against waves of enemy air, ground, and naval forces. The game is a first person shooter -- all action occurs from the perspective of the character as it is navigated throughout the gaming environment. Players equip stronger weapons as the game continues, allowing them to destroy weak enemies quickly or take down larger opponents. The multiplayer component allows players to team up against the enemy forces and deploy tactics based on their personal styles. Most combat occurs in a fixed bunker; the player shoots down planes and other enemies from this location with a full, 360-degree perspective. As with most arcade-style games, players accumulate points as they destroy enemy forces. Development Developed by ScreamingGames and its sister company, Professor Fog's Workshop, Operation Blockade was loosely based on previous war shooters. Marketing manager Dennis Davidson stated that the game appeals to a wider audience than previous developments, as it allows players to begin action sequences immediately. The team also strove for accuracy in military units and weapons, as a way to appeal to dedicated war gamers. Reception and criticism Operation Blockade received \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\" according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. IGN cited the graphics as \\"ghastly and painful\\" and the gameplay as forcing the reviewer to \\"scream in pain\\", while citing the audio as \\"not all that bad\\". GameSpot claimed that \\"If you were to buy, install, and actually enjoy Operation Blockade, you'd need to be at least partially insane.\\" GameSpot criticized the game's gameplay as \\"repetitive, often frustrating\\" and the challenge as having \\"little skill involved\\". However, unlike IGN, GameSpot considered the graphics the high point of the game, stating that the game \\"looks quite good\\".

It was released on August 22 of 2006. Album Review Seattle's On the Last Day come from the same local scene that spawned fellow Victory Records act Aiden. Not only are the two bands good friends from those early days, they both also look pretty similar in their dark garb, heavy eyeliner usage, and morose faces. So it may come as no shock that the bands also have a relatively similar sound ‚Äî emphasis on relative, though, since On the Last Day are much more rooted in post-hardcore than their goth-melodic-screamo peers. The band's sonic assault is like an early, more uniform version of Boy Sets Fire; lead singer Geoffrey Walker at times even sounds disturbingly similar to Nathan Gray. These comparisons aside, there's not really much to say about On the Last Day or their Victory debut, Meaning in the Static. Though the pace stays pretty quick, somehow 11 songs in about 40 minutes becomes a bit tedious. There's nothing inherently bad about the music and the band actually comes off as way more likable than initial, superficial opinions may have suggested. The drums propel everything along fiercely as the vocals switch up from quasi-singing to grueling shrieking and requisite heavy breakdowns are thrown in when necessary; the production is also not overly slick, allowing the band's relative grit to shine through. Overall, it's a competent take on post- hardcore that comes in, does its thing, and leaves without really adding much along the way ‚Äî there's just something missing in Meaning in the Static that ultimately makes it a decent but frustrating record. After all, indifference is not usually what bands aspire to leave their listeners feeling, right?

Llamerada Dancers in the Carnival The Carnival of Oruro is a religious and cultural festival in Oruro, Bolivia. It has been celebrated since the 18th century. Originally an indigenous festival, the celebration later was transformed to incorporate a Christian ritual around the Virgin of Candelaria (Virgin of Socav√≥n). The carnival is one of UNESCO's Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity. Throughout the festival, more than 48 groups of folk dancers specializing in 18 different folk dances perform a pilgrimage to the Shrine of the Tunnel every Saturday of the carnival in a traditional parade. The traditional Llama llama or Diablada became the leading traditional dance of the festival. Background The native Itu ceremonies were banned by the Spanish in the 17th century, during their rule over Upper Peru. However, the Uru continued to observe the festival in the form of a Catholic ritual on Candlemas, in the first week of each February. Christian icons were used to conceal portrayals of Andean gods, and the Christian saints stood in for other minor Andean divinities. The ceremony began forty days before Easter. Legend also has it that in 1756, a mural of the Virgin Mary miraculously appeared in a mineshaft of the richest silver mine in Oruro. Ever since, the Carnival has been observed in honour of the Virgen de la Candelaria (Virgin of the Candlemas) or Virgen del Socavon (Virgin of the Mineshaft). The most important elements of the Carnival now occur in and around the Sanctuaria del Socavon (Church of the Mineshaft). =Pre-Hispanic period= Called Jururu (Uru Uru) in ancient times, the area that is now Oruro was a religious pilgrimage center of the Andean world. Pilgrims would trek to the \\"Sacred mountain of the Urus\\", where they could call protective deities: wak'as, achachilas and apus. These deities included Jamp'atu Qullu (hill toad), Argentillo Arankani (hill lizard), Quwak (viper), the condor and Wakallusta, among others. After the Incan Empire took over the region, the Incans tried to introduce their religion by adding an evil demigod, WariDesam, and a sacred demigod, Apus waka. Spanish colonization brought about a unique religious syncretism of Catholicism and Wari religion. The Virgin and the Devil from Catholic teachings were absorbed into local ideas of Pachamama and Tio Supay, a blending of religious symbolism that can still be seen during the Carnival. =Modern carnival= The modern festival demonstrates the ongoing pagan- Catholic blend of religious practice in the region. The carnival starts with a ceremony dedicated to the Virgen del Socavon. Marching bands compete simultaneously in the grotto of Pie de Gallo on Sunday, which is the greeting to the Virgin. The highlight of the festival is the three-day-and-three-night parade of 48 groups of folk dancers over a four kilometer route to the sanctuary of the tunnel. Three days prior to this Saturday pilgrimage, people visit the symbolic pagan condor. A week after the pilgrimage, they visit the snake south of the city, the toad to the north and the ants to the east. The pilgrimage culminates in the enactment of two medieval-style didactic or mystery plays. The first is about the Spanish conquest and the other revolves around the classical battle between good and evil, with the Archangel Michael ultimately triumphing over the Devil and the Seven Deadly Sins. The latter play was introduced by Catholic clergy in 1818. In all, there are over 28,000 dancers, about 10,000 musicians in 150 bands, 400,000 visitors stretching over four miles. The bands themselves have a national festival on the Monday before Carnival weekend, that is aired on Bolivian television and its attended by the President of Bolivia and government authorities. UNESCO designation An international jury of public figures chaired by writer Juan Goitisilo and convened by UNESCO proclaimed the Carnival one of the Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity on May 18, 2001. The proclamation was broadcast from Paris, France. Other members of the jury included the President of the Republic of Mali, Alpha Oumar Konare, the Kabaka of Uganda, His Majesty Ronald Muwenda Mutebi il, Princess Basma Bint Talal of Jordan, the Bolivian singer Zulma Yugar and Mexican writer Carlos Fuentes. Dance Specialties Oruro's historical importance, as well as its cultural and religious influence, make its carnival a natural setting for demonstrating the multiculturalism of Bolivia and especially its variety of folk dances. The dance groups participating represent various indigenous dance styles, and are accompanied by several bands. Areas represented by the dancers include: * The Andean region of the Bolivian Altiplano and the Yungas valleys: Groups include the negritos, Afro-Bolivian saya and the caporales. This area is densely populated, including the departments of Potos√≠, Oruro and part of La Paz. This area is rich in folklore, with dances including the tinku, llamerada (llameros), kullawada, kallawaya, the siklla (wayra, doctorcitos), Inkas and kantu. * Valleys area: Cochabamba, Tarija and Chuquisaca, including the putulu and pukllay dances. * The plains and forests: departments of Santa Cruz, Beni, Pando, Tarija and Chuquisaca featuring multi-ethnic war dances. *All the dances share Oruro origin like the dance of the devils or diablada, morenada, antawara, awatiri, suri sikuri, wititi, intillaqta, tarqueadas and sampo√±aris. * Diablada * Morenada * Tobas * Caporales * Tinku * Inkas * Llamerada * Kullawada * Suri Sikuri * Antawara * Awatiri * Zampo√±eros * Tarqueadas * Kantus * Kallawaya * Wititi * Putulu * Siklla * Waka waka * Pukllay Others *Diablada of Oruro *Diablada *El T√≠o External links *Carnaval de Oruro Information about Carnival de Oruro in Bolivia, calendar and travelguide. *Carnaval de Oruro - Dancing with the Diablada in Bolivia's Carnival *A detailed description of the Carnival by photos and external links *Site Web UNESCO Category:Bolivian culture Category:Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity Category:Folk festivals in Bolivia Category:Festivals established in 1756 Category:Carnivals in Bolivia Category:Autumn events in Bolivia ","title":"Carnaval de Oruro"},{"id":"6615489","text":"The Kaguru, or Kagulu, are a Bantu ethno-linguistic group based in central Tanzania. In 1987 the Kaguru population was estimated to number 217,000.http://www.ethnologue.com/show_country.asp?name=TZ  Geography  Ukagura (Kaguraland, about 3,600 square miles) lies roughly 200 miles due west of the seaports of Bagamoyo and Sadani. The main caravan route between the Indian Ocean and Lake Tanganyika during the 18th and 19th centuries passed through Ukagura, following the Mkondoa and Kinyasungwe rivers. This caravan route later became the Central line railway.Wynne-Jones, Stephanie & Croucher, Sarah. (2007). \\"The central caravan route of Tanzania: a preliminary archaeological reconnaissance\\". Nyame Akuma. 67. 91-95. The Ukaguru Mountains form part of the Eastern Arc Mountains which stretch diagonally from southwest to northeast along the Eastern Rift system of Kenya and Tanzania. To the west and north lies the central plateau comprising two-thirds of Tanzania. There are three very different areas, the core, the plateau, and the lowlands. The core is the Ukaguru Mountains, a mass of mountain peaks (6,000‚Äì7,000 ft.) that represents a third of the area. In the German Sergeant Bauer's time only a few of its mountains were, and remain today, thickly wooded, for most were already deforested because of the iron smelting industry with its intense need for charcoal and the severe agricultural clearing. After the coming of the Germans much land was preserved as woodland reserved and can be considered beautiful semitropical forestland of great density and abundant rain. The steep terrain had a network of valleys ideal for refugees escaping raids, particularly from the Hehe of the south and the Maasai of the north and is considered the 'heartland'. The word 'Kaguru' refers to the highlands with heavy rain (100 inches on the peaks) that was cool and capable of the regular production of vegetables, and some rice, millet, and plantains. It contained no maize. Next the plateau is a land of less rain and more warmth, of large expanses of scrubland and forest, scattered peaks and rocky outcrops, a land of dry and wet seasons. It is a land of periodic famine due to drought, but healthier than the damp and chilly 'heartland'. It was after more peaceful time had arrived that people began returning to the 'Street of Caravans' and the caravan's resting places. Generally the very largest livestock holdings were kept here. The remaining 20 percent had the most extreme contrast between wet and dry seasons. Lying below 2,000 feet altitude it had the least dependable agricultural conditions, being a flat grassy plain, it was most vulnerable to raiding, difficult to defend against these raids, was most prone to cattle diseases, and contained the largest number of non-Kagura who had settled either as refugees or part of the very impressive caravan trade. History During Sergeant Bauer's time, the Kaguru still tended to stay in large, palisade settlements on the plateau where enough men lived to defend against the raids for livestock, grain, metal goods, or slaves. The plateau represented 50% of Ukagura and had become the area where most Kaguru lived. The earliest European accounts of the Kaguru gave them various names and seem to be only vaguely aware of them (the Germans with Sergeant Bauer and Charles Stokes make no mention of them). They were lumped together with their neighbors the Gogo or the Sandawe to the west or the mountain and plateau Kaguru were given separate names. They were ethnically placed with other highland peoples who were also matrilineal and had similar lifestyles. There were no traditional firmly established chiefdoms or political systems. A few leaders would rise up and establish a network of contacts on the main caravan trading stations. It was here that these leaders became responsible for overstating their influence and power and tried to claim special rank and privileges, and it was also here that caravans were offered the services of law and order in return for recognition, munitions, trade goods, and cash. These leaders also offered the Kagura protection against dangerous, armed outsiders who were to kill in order to get supplies and labor. While the Arabs, Germans, and British were only too happy to imagine coherent 'tribal' areas under the control of cooperative chiefs, some of the leaders were actually to follow through on their offerings. In reality, however, the Kagura were quite close to being stateless. Ukagura was the last site for caravans taking on supplies and water before entering the dry western plains, (Mr. Stokes' caravan is only one example), and it was the first good supply and resting place for caravans after crossing the wild plains to and from the coast with their slow moving shipment of trade goods. Christian missionaries not only established their headquarters among the Kagura in order to aid their fellow missionaries passing through, but also condemned a wide range of Kaguru customs such as polygyny, ancestral propitiation, and the use of rainstones and other magical medicines. Also included in the condemnation were alcohol consumption, dancing, native jewelry, dress, hairstyles, ear-piercing, red ocher for cosmetics, Kaguru music and songs, including many forms of etiquette. They violently opposed female circumcision, but since this was not performed in public it was difficult to prevent. The missionaries also tried hard to segregate the Christian initiates from the pagans. By and large the missionaries were unsuccessful with their opposition. Had they been successful most of Kaguru culture and identity would have been lost. They also interfered with the illegal slave trade by reporting it to the European authorities on the coast through their connections there. Society =Overview= The Kagura were and remain a matrilineal people (tracing the descent and inheritance through the female) and speaking Chikaguru. They needed to establish broad and diverse relationships since their society was organized around relatives and household groups containing people who could be called upon for support and were a major resource for security and prosperity. Since Ukagura was vulnerable to raids, and at times lacked sufficient manpower to work the land, defend it, and guard against outsiders looking for goods and captives, people not land, were the scarcest and most sought-after resource. Every third of fourth year a Kagura could expect lean times, while every seventh or eighth year conditions could become very brutal. The Kagura were forever caught between trying to meet their own needs and having to meet the requirements of others who sooner or later might in turn come to their rescue. Diverse social ties are crucial, since harvests and prolonged dryness vary between areas and help can be vital, involving more than just sharing harvests, but also borrowing livestock, or permission to resettle. The Kagura negotiate rights to land, to rituals, bridewealth, fines and inheritance as part of kin membership determined through birth and marriage. Their society existed of about one hundred matrilineal clans with a wide variety of names such Cat, Goat, Messengers, Spoiled Beer, Rain, Beads, Ravines, Criw, etc., with each containing thousands of members. Each clan was associated with one or more pieces of land that it claimed as its own and each year would organize rituals to revitalize this land. In practice, actual ownership of a clan area was negotiable and could lead to trouble. In Sergeant Bauer's time most Kaguru felt secure within a local area and resisted leaving it. =Gender roles and marriage= Flesh and blood was identity and came from the mother. The father was important but not as powerful as the ties to the mother and her kin. A child is a member of his or hers mother's clan but not a member of the father's. Ties to the mother were automatic and profound, ties to the father and his kin went into effect only after payments were made. Most Kagura marriages were not considered complete until the birth of children, which only then complicated the varying interplay of loyalties over time. Men monopolized all ritual and official public life, but women were also essential, whether or not they were married, and had total rights of control over their children. The difference between the two sexes can be illustrated by the kinds of abuse aimed at each. A man may be told he is unmarried or acts as though he were uncircumcised. This can be changed. A woman, on the other hand, can be rebuked for having no children, a flaw in the woman that cannot be changed. Brother- sister relationships are important. A sister's consent to be married and not run away puts her brother in debt to her. Yet in later live, brothers may encourage their sisters to leave their husbands. The bridewealth received for a sister often enables her brother to marry. A brother hopes to make claims on the loyalty and labor of a sister's sons and bridewealth from her daughters. Men encourage marital instability among their own sisters and nieces while urging marital stability within their own households. Even though the couple's attitudes are taken into consideration, marriage is seen as a competition for alliance, and it is the relatives of a couple who determine marriage. It is this intense competition that provides the broad economic, social, and political security go necessary and so important. The most important role for men is as husband and brother and they rarely favor divorce, even when the wife is difficult, in contrast many women press for divorce or use it as a threat. The more children a couple have, the more advantage the wife's kin find in divorce. If she is divorced her side withholds a portion of the bridewealth for every child born, even if these died. If there were five or six children born, no bridewealth is returned and the brideservice is not returned. If she remarries, her kin could again secure bridewealth and brideservice. Divorce is always an economic threat to a husband unless his wife is barren or is considered so unpleasant that the community supports his refund. No divorced man wants to remain alone for long. Mature men cannot easily manage without a wife to cook, and carry water and wood, whereas grown women can manage rather well if raiding is no problem. From a woman's viewpoint the best reason to marry is that she gets a man to appease her own father and mother's brothers, for women are most closely bonded to their mothers and children. The father finds the support of his wife to be vital in order to secure the loyalty of his children. Whatever value a Kaguru woman holds for her brothers and husband stems from her importance as a mother. She sees her long-term loyalties as the same as those of her children. The Kaguru mother is the person most likely to provide true heartfelt advice and support for her children, as her own needs are totally wrapped up with those of her children. When a woman grows older, her focus upon her children increases, and increases even more when there are co-wives. All Kaguru women desire as many children as possible, in or out of marriage. It is barrenness, not an illegitimate child, which is a Kaguru woman's greatest calamity. Help during illness or need becomes undependable as the woman ages. Her lot is not an easy one. A childless woman's greatest concern is finding kin to care for her after she becomes old, with brewing, prostitution, and midwifery becoming her most likely means for added income. Childlessness has become a disgrace and a catastrophe. =Sexuality= Traditional Kaguru were quite prudish about any kind of public nudity. No immature Kaguru would ever have been able to examine an entirely unclothed adult of either sex. Men wore a toga-like garment and took great care not to appear naked even when washing. Women always wore a skirt. All sexual allusions were forbidden between parents and child and between all siblings. Such talk would be considered shameless and perverse. It is the grandparents, cross cousins, or those unrelated of the same age that are expected to be free to mention such matters. There was very little sexual information available to Kaguru youth before initiation. Parents' sexuality was shielded from children who could not even touch the bed of a parent. It is only at initiation that sexual questions can at last be freely mentioned and are a constant and required topic of instruction. Male circumcision (initiation) is performed at puberty by men in a bush camp (not in a settlement) where the youth remains until he recovers, and consists of removing the foreskin of the penis with a knife. It was said that his childhood has died and he has been reborn as an adult. It is thought to please women because it makes males even more different from females and the sexes are attracted to the opposites of each other. Female initiation takes place in the seclusion of a house when the girl is about fourteen. The seclusion could last weeks to months and she was expected to become beautiful (fat and pale). Women inside the initiation house enjoyed singing obscene songs, laughing loudly at jokes, and dancing, it was good excuse to travel and visit. After a night of singing and dancing the girl was taken into the nearby bush, held seated on a hide and cut by an old woman. The cutting on the labia could be extensive, a light nick or not at all. The Kagura did not remove any part of the clitoris, and the female initiate, after receiving gifts of new clothing and masses of beads from her kinswomen, was now ready for suitors and marriage. =Death= As with most African peoples the community consisted of dead ancestors and the generations still to be born, as well as the living; they lived in an 'age of faith'. Following the death of an ordinary person the spirit goes to an alternative dimension, 'ghostland' (Rejoining the 'Life- Force', but retaining the spiritual identity), where ghosts live in villages much as the living do (they merely change their address), and the arrival of a new person is celebrated just as the loss is mourned by the living. At birth to the living, the ghosts, who have given up one of their members, mourn the loss. Both sides give up one of theirs to the other with resignation and resentment. Infants, having just made a dangerous journey, have a weak hold on life and may be taken back by the jealous ghosts, while uninitiated youth who die, are also said to have never fully stopped being ghosts and are not extensively mourned. In an orderly world the two dimensions are expected to be separate and not interfere with one another, though the misdeeds of the living do upset the ghosts and they wish to be remembered with sacrifices and hear their names called out. Serious and continuing problems are blamed on angry, disturbed, or confused ghosts for whom rites are then held to placate, cool or quiet them. The most prominent ancestral ghosts are named and wheat flour and the blood of sacrificial animals are poured on the graves.

Mosquitoes are best known as parasites to many vertebrate animals and vectors for disease. They are holometabolous insects, and most species lay their eggs in stagnant water, to benefit their aquatic larval stage. Introduction The subfamily Culicinae is the largest subfamily of Culicidae, a family of Nematocera dipterans. There are 3,046 species of Culicinae mosquitoes, in 108 genera and 11 tribes. Members of the Culicinae subfamily are small flies with fore wings for flight and hind wings reduced to halteres for balance. The mosquitoes also have long, slender, legs and proboscis-style mouth parts for feeding on vertebrate blood or plant fluids. Only the females are blood feeders, requiring a high quality protein meal before they can oviposit. Because the mosquitoes are well adapted for finding hosts, the females can move quickly from one blood meal to another, and when injecting their saliva, can inject pathogens picked up from other hosts and thus efficiently spread disease. Lifecycle Culicinae mosquitoes are holometabolous, going through four distinct life stages: egg, larva, pupa, and adult. The duration of each stage is species-specific, but all Culicinae mosquitoes are multivoltine. The egg, larval, and pupal stages are aquatic. Adults leave the water by flight to find plants or vertebrates on which to feed. Oviposition can occur in natural reservoirs of salt water or fresh water, or temporary pools, but oviposition sites are generally stagnant. All Psorophora and some Aedes species oviposit on soil where the eggs remain, unhatched, till flooded. Many species associate closely with humans, using accumulated ground water in developed areas for oviposition. Some species use plant cavities for oviposition. These species can, as larvae, drill into the plant for air. =Eggs= Culicinae eggs are laid in groups by adult females, often numbering over a hundred. Most species lay the eggs on the surface of stagnant water. The female lays the eggs vertically and side by side, held together by a sticky substance excreted to coat the eggs, head end down, creating an egg raft that is convex below and concave above with ends that are typically upturned. Species that use this form of egg-laying typically hatch as first instar larvae within a few hours of laying. Oviposition on the surface of stagnant water is most common, but some species of Aedes and all Psorophora deposit their eggs in areas that will flood. Eggs are laid and embryological development occurs, but the eggs do not hatch till flooded. After flooding, the eggs will hatch within two to three days. =Larvae= Culicinae larvae are adapted to almost every aquatic environment worldwide, excepting flowing streams and open areas of large water masses. Larvae have three body regions ‚Äì head, thorax, and abdomen ‚Äì as well as having compound eyes and antennae on their heads. The same body regions can be found in Culicinae adults, but the form of each region is very different in the larvae and adults. The larvae have four instars from hatching to pupation that occur over four days to two weeks. Culicinae larvae can be distinguished from larvae of other subfamilies by the presence of the posterior siphon. The siphon is used for breathing and breaks the water surface, so the larvae can take in air. Most species hang from the surface of the water, anterior end down, so the siphon stays at the water surface. Some species of Mansonia and Coquillettidia use the siphon differently, piercing underwater plants to take oxygen. Larvae eat small aquatic organisms and plant material in the water using brush-style and grinding mouth parts. A few species are predatory and have additional mouth parts for grasping. Larvae use jerks of their bodies for locomotion, combined with propulsion using the mouth bristles. They are sensitive to the conditions of the water in which they live, including light, temperature, and many other factors, and are also subject to predation and depend on aquatic vegetation to hide from predators. =Pupae= Culicinae pupae are aquatic and do not feed, but they do require air intake. All pupae must come to the water surface for air, with the exception of Mansonia and Coquillettidia species. Pupae are exarate, allowing movement of the exposed abdomen. Thrashing of the abdomen can move the pupae quickly, sideways or downward, but as soon as movement of the abdomen stops, the pupae return to the surface of the water. The pupa naturally rises to the surface of the water due to an air pocket between the wing cases that make it lighter than water. Pupation lasts as little as one day to as much as several weeks, because some diapause can occur. =Adults= Adult mosquitoes are about equal in proportions of males and females, but males emerge from the pupal stage before females. Males stay near the breeding ground and mate soon after the females emerge. Females only need to mate once, then store sperm to use over their lifetimes. After mating, adults leave the breeding ground and can fly great distances. Culicinae adults inhabit almost every environment, and both males and females feed on plant sugars. Females also feed on animal blood, which most species need before they can lay eggs. After a blood meal, females take two or more days to digest the blood before oviposition. After egglaying, females begin searching for another host for a blood meal. Different species of mosquitoes have preferences to blood meals from specific species of hosts, but can feed on other species. Adults have three body regions, with narrow membranes joining the segments, and are two to 15 mm in length. The first body region, the head, holds the large compound eyes, proboscis-style mouth parts, and plumose antennae. The antennae of males are more plumose than those of females, to catch pheromones to find a mate. The thorax is covered in scales and setae helpful in species identification. Attached to the thorax are three pairs of long, slender legs, a pair of fore wings used for flight, and hind wings reduced to halteres for balance. The abdomen is slender, but membranous so it can swell when feeding. The abdomen has 10 segments, but only eight are visible. The last two segments are reduced and used for reproduction. The lifespan of adult Culicinae can vary greatly based on environment, predation, and pest control. Feeding Culicinae adults of both sexes feed on plant sugars, such as nectar. Feeding on blood is only practiced by females, to gain a high-protein meal for egg production. The mouth parts of females are adapted for piercing the skin of hosts, whereas the similar mouth parts of males are incapable of piercing skin. When feeding on blood, females use their large compound eyes to initially find a host. When near a host, females can detect changes in light and odors. They can then land and use their probosces to feel for a place to bite. To feed, they pierce the skin and inject saliva containing an anticoagulant and an anesthetic. The anesthetic reduces pain so the host does not detect the bite, and the anticoagulant prevents blood from clotting so they can continue to feed. Pathological organisms contained in the saliva injection by the female mosquitoes can quickly spread diseases.

Her career began early in the silent film era, in 1911, and continued for forty years. She retired in the 1930s but later returned to make more movies. Her final film was Hollywood Story (1951), in which she had a bit part. Early life Ridgely was born Freda Cleo Helwig in New York City. She was the daughter of August Helwig and Catherine Emily Sommerkamp. She had two sisters, Christina and Martha. After her parents' deaths when she was 2 years old, she lived in Wisconsin with her grandmother. Career Before she began working in films, Ridgely performed in the chorus at the Hippodrome Theater in New York City. In 1910, she began acting for the Kalem Company film studio in Jacksonville, Florida. After that, she worked for the Lubin and Rex studios. Ridgely starred with Ruth Roland in a girl detective series in the 1920s and co-starred in a number of films with Wallace Reid and Lew Cody. Ridgely worked with Famous Players-Lasky Film Company and also for Paramount Pictures. She was selected queen of the Auburn exhibit at the downtown automobile show in Los Angeles in October 1915. A publicity photo posed the actress with a 1916 Auburn Six. It was made by the Auburn Automobile Company and appeared at the show. Equestrian Ridgely was an accomplished horsewoman. In 1912, accompanied by her first husband, she rode across the country on horseback from New York to Los Angeles. Making numerous promotional stops along the way, the trip lasted 18 months. In one of her Lasky features she stopped a runaway four-in-hand, risking her life, while on top of a stagecoach. Ridgely lived her later years in Glendale, California. According to the magazine Kalem Kalendar (January, 1915), during a trip over the Arizona borderline, Ridgely was captured by Mexican rebels. Fortunately, some American citizens heard of the incident and secured her release a few hours later. In 2016, Ridgely was honored with a Letter of Commendation by the City of Glendale, California.  Personal life  She was divorced from her first husband, Jaudon M. Ridgely, in Los Angeles in December 1916. She was then married to James W. Horne, who directed the Laurel and Hardy comedies for many years. Horne died in 1942. She and Horne had twins, Jimmy Horne Jr. and June Jessamine Horne.  Death  Ridgely died in 1962 at her home at the age of 68. She was buried in Forest Lawn Memorial Park.

The program was originally combined with the Canada Social Transfer in a program known as the Canada Health and Social Transfer. It was made independent from the Canada Health and Social Transfer program on April 1, 2004 to allow for greater accountability and transparency for federal health funding led by then prime minister Paul Martin.  Overview  Unlike Equalization payments, which are unconditional, the CHT is a block transfer; the funds must be used by provinces and territories for the purposes of \\"maintaining the national criteria\\" for publicly provided health care in Canada (as set out in the Canada Health Act). The CHT is made up of a cash transfer. In 2008-09, CHT cash transfer payments from the federal government to the provinces and territories were $22.6 billion and tax point transfers were worth $13.9 billion. The cash transfer is expected to grow to 28.6 billion in 2012-2013, a growth rate of approximately six per cent.http://www.ipolitics.ca/2012/04/25/canada-health-transfer-changes-the- devil-is-in-the-details/ Annual cash levels are set in legislation up to the 2013-14 fiscal year as a result of the September 2004 Health Accord between the federal government and the provinces/territories. While the CHT is allocated on an equal per capita basis, the CHT cash component is not because it takes into account the value of provincial/territorial tax points. The value of a tax point represents the amount of revenue that is generated by one percentage point of a particular tax (in the case of the CHT and the CST, the personal income tax or the corporate income tax). Since provinces do not have identical economies and, therefore, have unequal capacity to raise tax revenues, a tax point is worth more in a wealthy province than in a poorer province. Currently Alberta and Ontario, the two provinces with the highest revenue raising ability, receive lower per capita CHT cash payments than the other provinces. However, beginning in 2014-15, the Canada Health Transfer allocation to provinces will be determined solely on an equal per capita cash basis and no longer include tax point transfers. According to economist Livio Di Matteo, this will result in 'a particularly large windfall to Alberta.'http://www.ipolitics.ca/2012/04/25/canada-health-transfer-changes- the-devil-is-in-the-details/ The CHT, which is set to top $36-billion in 2016-17, is now divided among the provinces on a purely per-capita basis.  History  The Canada Health Transfer was created by the 2003 First Ministers Health Accord signed by the provincial premiers and Jean Chr√©tien, prime minister of Canada at the time. The accord, signed on , is a compromise between the two levels of governments, as the provincial premiers did not obtain a federal contribution as large as suggested in the Romanow Report. Jean Chr√©tien left satisfied from the meeting, talking of a deal on a fundamental reform whereas the provincial premiers showed disappointment. The Premier of Quebec, Bernard Landry even mentioned that the deal was an example of predatory federalism. These difficult negotiations were held in a context of controversy over the existence of a fiscal imbalance between the federal government and the provinces. The 2003 Health Accord introduced several measures to improve the healthcare system in Canada, notably introducing the Canada Heath Transfer starting on to increase transparency and accountability on the use of federal transfers. Little over a year thereafter on another accord on healthcare was signed during a First Ministers Conference. This 10-year plan outlined $18 billions in increased transfers to the provinces over 6 years, notably through increases in the Canada Health Transfer : * The CHT was to be increased by $3 billions in 2004-05 and $2 billions in 2005-06 ; * A new CHT base set at $19 billions starting in 2005-06, greater than suggested in the Romanow Report ; * An escalation factor set at 6% starting in 2006-07.

It may be alternatively referred to as systems performance engineering within systems engineering, and software performance engineering or application performance engineering within software engineering. As the connection between application success and business success continues to gain recognition, particularly in the mobile space, application performance engineering has taken on a preventive and perfective\\"Banking Industry Lessons Learned in Outsourcing Testing Services,\\" Gartner. August 2, 2012. role within the software development life cycle. As such, the term is typically used to describe the processes, people and technologies required to effectively test non-functional requirements, ensure adherence to service levels and optimize application performance prior to deployment. The term performance engineering encompasses more than just the software and supporting infrastructure, and as such the term performance engineering is preferable from a macro view. Adherence to the non-functional requirements is also validated post-deployment by monitoring the production systems. This is part of IT service management (see also ITIL). Performance engineering has become a separate discipline at a number of large corporations, with tasking separate but parallel to systems engineering. It is pervasive, involving people from multiple organizational units; but predominantly within the information technology organization. Performance engineering objectives *Increase business revenue by ensuring the system can process transactions within the requisite timeframe *Eliminate system failure requiring scrapping and writing off the system development effort due to performance objective failure *Eliminate late system deployment due to performance issues *Eliminate avoidable system rework due to performance issues *Eliminate avoidable system tuning efforts *Avoid additional and unnecessary hardware acquisition costs *Reduce increased software maintenance costs due to performance problems in production *Reduce increased software maintenance costs due to software impacted by ad hoc performance fixes *Reduce additional operational overhead for handling system issues due to performance problems *Identify future bottlenecks by simulation over prototype *Increase server capability Performance engineering approach Because this discipline is applied within multiple methodologies, the following activities will occur within differently specified phases. However, if the phases of the rational unified process (RUP) are used as a framework, then the activities will occur as follows: During the first, Conceptual phase of a program or project, critical business processes are identified. Typically they are classified as critical based upon revenue value, cost savings, or other assigned business value. This classification is done by the business unit, not the IT organization. High level risks that may impact system performance are identified and described at this time. An example might be known performance risks for a particular vendor system. Finally, performance activities, roles and deliverables are identified for the Elaboration phase. Activities and resource loading are incorporated into the Elaboration phase project plans. =Elaboration= During this defining phase, the critical business processes are decomposed to critical use cases. Probe cases will be decomposed further, as needed, to single page (screen) transitions. These are the use cases that will be subjected to script driven performance testing. The type of requirements that relate to performance engineering are the non-functional requirements, or NFR. While a functional requirement relates to which business operations are to be performed, a performance related non-functional requirement will relate to how fast that business operation performs under defined circumstances. =Construction= Early in this phase a number of performance tool related activities are required. These include: *Identify key development team members as subject matter experts for the selected tools. *Specify a profiling tool for the development/component unit test environment. *Specify an automated unit (component) performance test tool for the development/component unit test environment; this is used when no GUI yet exists to drive the components under development. *Specify an automated tool for driving server-side unit (components) for the development/component unit test environment. *Specify an automated multi-user capable script-driven end- to-end tool for the development/component unit test environment; this is used to execute screen-driven use cases. *Identify a database test data load tool for the development/component unit test environment; this is required to ensure that the database optimizer chooses correct execution paths and to enable reinitializing and reloading the database as needed. *Deploy the performance tools for the development team. *Presentations and training must be given to development team members on the selected tools. The performance test team normally does not execute performance tests in the development environment, but rather in a specialized pre-deployment environment that is configured to be as close as possible to the planned production environment. This team will execute performance testing against test cases, validating that the critical use cases conform to the specified non-functional requirements. The team will execute load testing against a normally expected (median) load as well as a peak load. They will often run stress tests that will identify the system bottlenecks. The data gathered, and the analysis, will be fed back to the group that does performance tuning. Where necessary, the system will be tuned to bring nonconforming tests into conformance with the non-functional requirements. If performance engineering has been properly applied at each iteration and phase of the project to this point, hopefully this will be sufficient to enable the system to receive performance certification. However, if for some reason (perhaps proper performance engineering working practices were not applied) there are tests that cannot be tuned into compliance, then it will be necessary to return portions of the system to development for refactoring. In some cases the problem can be resolved with additional hardware, but adding more hardware leads quickly to diminishing returns. =Transition= During this final phase the system is deployed to the production environment. A number of preparatory steps are required. These include: *Configuring the operating systems, network, servers (application, web, database, load balancer, etc.), and any message queueing software according to the base checklists and the optimizations identified in the performance test environment *Ensuring all performance monitoring software is deployed and configured *Running statistics on the database after the production data load is completed Once the new system is deployed, ongoing operations pick up performance activities, including: *Validating that weekly and monthly performance reports indicate that critical use cases perform within the specified non functional requirement criteria *Where use cases are falling outside of NFR criteria, submit defects *Identify projected trends from monthly and quarterly reports, and on a quarterly basis, execute capacity planning management activities Service management In the operational domain (post production deployment) performance engineering focuses primarily within three areas: service level management, capacity management, and problem management. =Service level management= In the service level management area, performance engineering is concerned with service level agreements and the associated systems monitoring that serves to validate service level compliance, detect problems, and identify trends. For example, when real user monitoring is deployed it is possible to ensure that user transactions are being executed in conformance with specified non-functional requirements. Transaction response time is logged in a database such that queries and reports can be run against the data. This permits trend analysis that can be useful for capacity management. When user transactions fall out of band, the events should generate alerts so that attention may be applied to the situation. =Capacity management= For capacity management, performance engineering focuses on ensuring that the systems will remain within performance compliance. This means executing trend analysis on historical monitoring generated data, such that the future time of non compliance is predictable. For example, if a system is showing a trend of slowing transaction processing (which might be due to growing data set sizes, or increasing numbers of concurrent users, or other factors) then at some point the system will no longer meet the criteria specified within the service level agreements. Capacity management is charged with ensuring that additional capacity is added in advance of that point (additional CPUs, more memory, new database indexing, et cetera) so that the trend lines are reset and the system will remain within the specified performance range. =Problem management= Within the problem management domain, the performance engineering practices are focused on resolving the root cause of performance related problems. These typically involve system tuning, changing operating system or device parameters, or even refactoring the application software to resolve poor performance due to poor design or bad coding practices. Monitoring To ensure that there is proper feedback validating that the system meets the NFR specified performance metrics, any major system needs a monitoring subsystem. The planning, design, installation, configuration, and control of the monitoring subsystem are specified by an appropriately defined monitoring process. The benefits are as follows: * It is possible to establish service level agreements at the use case level. * It is possible to turn on and turn off monitoring at periodic points or to support problem resolution. * It enables the generation of regular reports. * It enables the ability to track trends over time, such as the impact of increasing user loads and growing data sets on use case level performance. The trend analysis component of this cannot be undervalued. This functionality, properly implemented, will enable predicting when a given application undergoing gradually increasing user loads and growing data sets will exceed the specified non functional performance requirements for a given use case.

In 2005 the Jita population was estimated to number 205,000. Jita people are humble, brave, stronger and are good warriors like their neighbors the Kurya . The Jita have many clans such as the Rusori clan, Batimba clan, and Bagamba clan. Jita people are originated from Ethiopia in one area called kushi. They were part of Omotic together with Hamer tribe as a part of Sidamo. They were originally cushites mixed with Nilotes and hunters. They moved from ethiopia to sudan and mixed up with many tribes such as Nuer, Nubian, dinka and Hausas. They were also in Egypt and many of them in Kenya.They entered Uganda after frequent quarrel with kabaka others went t and Toro as well tribes in Uganda. The origin of the name jita or wajita came after they settled in one long mountain in musoma called Masita and when German came they failed to pronounce masita and they named all the people around that area as majita or wajita and that is when the name wajita or jita people were formed. The Rusori clan is believed to be the original Jita group in the sense that they were the first to arrive in the land of the Jita, as they believe. They are different from other Jita in terms of physical appearance. They are light skinned and very tall with long noses, in comparison to other groups. Some keep cattle, and others fish and hunt. They are similar to the Batimba and Bagamba due to intermarriage between them. The Rusori clan traces their origin to somewhere in Egypt and Sudan, as Nubians; though they are also regarded as Bachwezi in Bunyoro, Kitara, and Bahuma in Batoro Uganda, after the disappearance of the Bachwezi to seemingly nowhere- though some claim that others went to Rwanda and Karagwe in Bukoba, and that others settled in Uganda as Nyankole. Jita people are proud of their culture. They speak similar dialects to the Baruli who are from Uganda, and others in Burundi, as well as with the Haya, Nyambo, Kerebe, Bakwaya and Zinza. The Zinza are also from Uganda in Jinja, and they are part of the Nyankole. Many villages of the Jita can also be found in Burundi, Rwanda, and Uganda such as Buruli, Rusoro, and Bulinga. Not all of the Jita are Bantu, but they speak a Bantu language known as Suguti. It has been said that many tribes in the Mara Region are not regarded as Bantu, and the moment they arrived in the region they chose to speak Suguti, and others the Mara language. However, the Baruli are Bantu. Some of the clans, such as the Rusori clan, did not eat fish or chicken before arriving in the land of the Jita, and it was regarded as an abomination. However, presently due to environmental issues they have started eating fish and chicken. The same applies to the Banyoro, Batoro and Nyambo from Karagwe. (Dissertation in the Mara Region) Some Jita, especially those who claim to be from Egypt and Sudan, have a close links with Igbo tribe in Nigeria, as seen by looking at their names. Many Jita names begin with Chi, meaning God in Igbo, and many have names like Chikere, Chijoriga, and Chinyere. The same applies to the Iteso tribe in Uganda which shares many names and small words of the Igbo language. References * Mdee, James S.

R. B. Fleming The last routes in Birmingham closed on 31 December 1911. Most of its services were taken over by Birmingham Corporation Tramways. Historical overview City of Birmingham Tramways Company Ltd was the result of a number of changes in ownership of the tramway franchises within the city of Birmingham since its creation in 1872 until 1911. The Birmingham and District Tramways Company Ltd (BDTC) operated trams in Birmingham from 1872 until 1876. BDTC was acquired by the Birmingham Tramways and Omnibus Company Ltd (BTOC) in 1876. BTOC in turn was taken over by the Birmingham Central Tramways Company Ltd (BCTC) in 1886. In 1896 the assets of the BCTC were acquired by the CBTC. On 1 January 1907, some of CBTC‚Äôs Birmingham routes were taken over by BCT. On 1 January 1912 BCT took over the remainder of the company's routes, ownership of which had just passed from neighbouring local councils to Birmingham Corporation. Detailed history =Birmingham and District Tramways Company Ltd= BDTC was the tramway company operating in Birmingham from 1872 until 1876. The company was formed by William Busby and Daniel Busby in 1871 as an amalgamation of the Birmingham and Staffordshire Tramways Company Ltd and the Birmingham Tramways Company Ltd. It built a standard gauge tramway line in 1872 from Hockley Brook to Dudley Port operated by horse trams. In 1873 the service was extended to the centre of Birmingham over the Birmingham Corporation tracks which were leased for ¬£910 over seven years. The Birmingham Corporation tracks had cost ¬£15,000 to build. In 1874 the tramway between West Bromwich and Dudley Port was abandoned as the company was in financial difficulty. The company was taken over by the Birmingham Tramways and Omnibus Company Ltd in 1876. =Birmingham Tramways and Omnibus Company Ltd= BTOC operated trams in Birmingham from 1876 until 1886. It took over the business of the Birmingham and District Tramways Company Ltd and restricted the trams to a service between Birmingham and Handsworth, thus discontinuing the service through West Bromwich. It was taken over by the BCTC in 1886. =Birmingham Central Tramways Company Ltd= Old Square, Birmingham, being prepared for demolition in 1891. The BCTC operated trams in Birmingham from 1884 to 1896. The company was formed in 1882, initially as the Birmingham Suburban Tramways Company but by the time of the opening of its first line, had been renamed the Birmingham Central Tramways Company Ltd. BCTC's Car No. 104 outside the tram shed in Dawlish Road, Bournbrook, in 1891. This vehicle survives, at the Black Country Living Museum. The initial rolling stock consisted of 10 Falcon horse cars for the Nechells route, 14 Kitson steam tram locos and 13 Falcon trailer cars. In 1886 they purchased the track of the BTOC, which lay outside the city boundary, and 18 horse cars. At the same time Birmingham Corporation leased the lines within the city to the Company. Taken over by companies controlled by Scottish-Canadian businessman James Ross, on 24 March 1888, the horse tram route from Colmore Row to Hockley Brook was converted to cable traction by the Patent Cable Tramway Company, and on 20 April 1889, the line was extended to Handsworth (New Inns). The service was operated with open-top double-decker cars. In October 1889 the portion of the acquired tramway along Bristol Road to Bournbrook was closed for reconstruction. It re-opened on 24 July 1890 and was worked by Nos. 101-112, Falcon battery-electric (accumulator) open-top double-deck cars. On 29 September 1896 the assets of the BCTC were acquired by the City of Birmingham Tramways Company Ltd. =The City of Birmingham Tramways Company Ltd= Postcard commemorating the ending of steam tram operations, on the last day of 1906 The CBTC operated trams in Birmingham from 1896 until 1911. The company was formed on 29 September 1896 by James Ross and William Mackenzie to take over the business of the BCTC.History of Birmingham, Volume 2. Conrad Gill, Asa Briggs From 14 May 1901 the route from the city to Bournbrook via Bristol Road (later extended to Selly Oak) was operated by electric cars using overhead current supply. Other routes were soon electrified and the company became a British Electric Traction subsidiary in 1902. On 30 June 1902 the company took over the routes of the Birmingham and Aston Tramways Company which were now owned by Aston Manor Urban District Council. By this date the CBTC were operating 21 overhead electric trams, 54 cable trams, 89 steam engines, 76 Double Decker steam trams, 10 horse cars, 45 horse buses and 608 horses on tracks mostly constructed and owned by Birmingham Corporation.

His drawings, in particular, \\"have the excitement of a direct response to a subject, a daring use of line or tone, a sense of charged intensity. His portrait drawings not only have likeness but express a mood that is part artist, part model.\\" Polonsky was also a key participant in Boston Expressionism and, in a lengthy oral history interview for the Smithsonian's Archives of American Art, an important witness. The roots of the movement link to two separate, but overlapping, circles of mid-Century artists, and Polonsky was involved with both. The first was allied to Boston's School of the Museum of Fine Arts where Polonsky, a Museum School graduate, later taught. The second was allied to Boston's Boris Mirski Gallery where Polonsky exhibited. Artists within these circles started interacting more, in the late 1940s, when many of them, including Polonsky, Karl Zerbe and Hyman Bloom, began meeting to address fears that major Boston museums were shutting out contemporary artists. The meetings inspired more activism, including the formation of the New England Chapter of Artists Equity and the Boston Arts Festival, with the former advocating for artists' rights and representation, and the latter providing a democratic fine arts forum in the middle of Boston's Public Garden. This community organizing led not only to new arts organizations, but also a more tightly organized community of artists. The exchange of ideas and influences that resulted developed a figurative style of Expressionism specific to New England.

Early Expressionist Meetings  = \\"Protest Meetings\\" = After returning from Europe in the late 1940s, Polonsky began attending meetings to protest Boston's Institute of Contemporary Art, then known as the Institute of Modern Art. Bloom, Zerbe, Shahn, Jack Levine, had gathered to express their fears \\"that the Institute would ... become a showcase for ... something quite different that what we thought it ought to show and support,\\" Polonsky said. Zerbe's experience with Boston's Museum of Fine Arts, which only \\"owned one watercolor, and at a time when his work was being acquired quite seriously, with pleasure, by some of the other institutions,\\" stoked those fears. The meetings jumpstarted the formation of the New England Chapter for Artist's Equity. = Boston Arts Festival = The activist artists, all connected to the Museum School or the Boris Mirski Gallery, had become a loose art club of sorts; in that capacity, they also helped organize the Boston Arts Festivals. The original Festivals, in the 1950s and 1960s, displayed fine art in tents in the Public Garden, and provided free performances in nearby Boston Common. This represented a major change in how art was presented in New England. \\"It seemed like a good, exuberant, democratic, freeing kind of idea to many of us,\\" Polonsky said. \\"It was very hearty, the sensations among the artists of Boston in those festivals of the first years, certainly, and the public. And much was accomplished. People like Robert Frost and MacLeish had taken it all very seriously. Productions in opera, along with that fragile tent city of exhibitions went up each year.\\"All of the information in \\"Early Expressionist Meetings\\" is based on the \\"Oral history interview with Arthur Polonsky, 1972 Apr. 12-May 21,\\" conducted by Robert Brown for the Smithsonian's Archives of American Art. (See also Endnote 2.)  Academic career  In the summer of 1947, Polonsky was a teaching assistant to Ben Shahn at the Museum School‚Äôs Tanglewood Program in the Berkshires. He subsequently traveled to France when awarded the Museum School‚Äôs European Traveling Fellowship upon graduation. From 1950-1960, he taught painting at the Boston Museum School. In 1954, he became Assistant Professor at Brandeis University in the Fine Arts Department, where he remained until 1965. From 1965-1990, Polonsky served as Associate Professor at Boston University, College of Fine Arts, from which he had become Professor Emeritus.  Personal life  Born in Lynn, Massachusetts, in 1925, Polonsky was one of two children of Jewish Russian immigrants Benjamin and Celia (Hurwitz) Polonsky. He had a close connection with the Newton Symphony Orchestra (NSO), having created three original works for the NSO‚Äôs program, \\"Art for Music,\\" and was featured on the NSO season brochures in 1981, 1983 and 1994. Arthur is the subject of a documentary feature film called Release from Reason which is currently in production by his son, Emmy-nominated director Gabriel Polonsky. Arthur died peacefully of natural causes on April 4, 2019 in Newton, Massachusetts. He was married to artist Lois Tarlow from 1953 to 1983, who survives him.

The is a hairstyle consisting of straight, usually cheek- length sidelocks and frontal fringe. The rest of the hair is usually worn long and straightened. As the name suggests, the style is thought to have originated, or at least become common, in the Imperial court during the Heian Period of Japanese history, when noble women would sometimes grow out their hair for their entire lives.  History  The hime cut appears to date back to the \\"amasogi\\" shoulder-length hairstyle of the Heian period. When a woman turned 20, the hair around her ears was cut in a ceremony called \\"binsogi\\". The combination of amasogi and binsogi produced the hime cut. 70's idol Megumi Asaoka is known in Japan for popularising the Hime cut, which became her trademark. Care and maintenance The hime cut is high maintenance for those without naturally straight hair, and requires frequent touch-ups on the sidelocks and front bangs in order to maintain its shape. Hair straightening is sometimes used to help with these problems as well as straightening irons and specially formulated shampoos for straight hair. Humidity is also cited as a problem with certain hair types, as the curling caused by excess humidity can change the shape of the hair. Occasionally, hair extensions and weaves are used for the side locks in order to prevent this. The hairstyle is frequently seen in gothic lolita subculture, especially the classification of elegant gothic lolita (EGL). Within the EGL community, the hime is considered a more elegant alternative to other styles that may require frequent curling and crimping that can permanently damage the hair. The hime cut is also popular in South Korea, having been popularized by K-pop celebrities. Variations Variants of the sidelocks have also been seen, such as longer sidelocks sometimes pulled in front of the ears and lack of frontal fringe with only the sidelocks present. The sidelocks may also appear shorter (as is the case with Ai Enma from Hell Girl, whose bangs cover her eyebrows and sidelocks are cut level with her mouth). Another example is the Vocaloid Megurine Luka in which her sidelocks appear to be layered from the mouth level down to the neck. The hair is also sometimes worn short in a variant of a pageboy, or cropped short in the back such as the personification of Japan in Hetalia: Axis Powers. The style is sometimes paired with odango, as worn by Fushigi Y≈´gi character Miaka Yuki, or worn one-sided, such as the character of Miyu from Vampire Princess Miyu. In the late 1970's, a variation of the style was worn by actress Louise Lasser as the title character on Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman.

Biography  Hetepheres I may have been a wife of pharaoh Sneferu, and the mother of King Khufu. It is possible that Hetepheres was only a minor wife of Sneferu and only rose in prominence after her son ascended the throne. She was the grandmother of Kings Djedefre and Khafra and Queen Hetepheres II. Her titles include: King's Mother (mwt-niswt), Mother of the King of the Two Lands (mwt-niswt-biti), Attendant of Horus (·∏´t-hrw), God's Daughter of his body (s3t-n·πØr-nt-·∫ñt.f).Grajetzki, Ancient Egyptian Queens ‚Äì a hieroglyphic dictionary, London, 2011. Hetepheres I's marriage to Snefru solidified his rise to the throne. Two great lines were joined when they married, as she had carried the blood royal from one dynasty to the next. Her title as \\"Daughter to the God\\" began when her father, Huni, ruled, and continued when she married Snefru and gave birth to the next ruler, Khufu, who is the one who commissioned her tomb and pyramid.Dodson, Hilton The Complete Royal Families of Ancient Egypt, London 2004  Discovery of the tomb  Tomb G 7000X of Hetepheres I, burial chamber, looking South (1926) Starting in 1902, a joint expedition of Harvard University and the Boston Museum of Fine Arts took over the excavation of Giza. For 23 years they methodically cleared and documented the area. On the 9th of March, 1925, while the leader of the expedition, George Reisner, was back in the US, the staff photographer noticed a patch of plaster where he was expecting limestone.Leonard Cottrell, The Lost Pharaohs, Grosset & Dunlap, New York (1961). Under the direction of Ahmed Said, Reisner's head rais, they cleared the area and removed the plaster, revealing a deep shaft. They dug down 85 feet before reaching a masonry wall which, when penetrated revealed a jumble of grave goods including a white alabaster sarcophagus, gold encased rods used to frame a canopy or tent, gold, wood furniture, and more. Using binoculars and mirrors, Battiscombe Gunn identified an inscription identifying Sneferu.\\"Bulletin of the Museum of Fine Arts Special Number, Supplement to Volume XXV: The Tomb of Queen Hetep-heres\\", Boston, May, 1927 http://www.gizapyramids.org/pdf%20library/bmfa_pdfs/bmfa25_1927_01to36.pdf But this, contrary to newspaper reports at the time, only meant that the owner of the tomb had lived during the reign of Sneferu. Reisner concluded that this represented a secret reburial, possibly because robbers had gotten into the original tomb. By April, he had identified the owner of the tomb as Hetepheres, wife of Sneferu and mother of Khufu. In 1927 they gathered to open the sarcophagus only to find that it was empty.Bulletin of the Museum of Fine Arts, Volume XXV, Boston, August, 1927, Number 150 Reisner conjectured that Hetepheres had been originally buried near her husband's pyramid in Dahshur, but the tomb was broken into shortly after her burial. He thought the robbers had opened the sarcophagus, stolen the mummy with all its gold trappings, but had fled before taking the rest of the treasures. Reisner proposed that the officials responsible for the tomb, in order to avoid his wrath, told Khufu that the mummy was still safely inside the sarcophagus. Khufu then ordered the sarcophagus and all the funerary equipment reburied at Giza, near his own pyramid.Edwards, I.E.S. \\"Review of 'The Pyramid Tomb of Hetep-heres and the Satellite Pyramid of Khufu'.\\" Journal of Egyptian Archaeology 75 (1989), pp. 261-265. The exact sequence of events is still a mystery however.Manuelian, Peter Der. \\"A Race against Time in the Shadow of the Pyramids. The Museum of Fine Arts, Boston and the Giza Necropolis, 1902-1990.\\" KMT 1, No. 4 (1990-91), pp. 10-21. Dr. Mark Lehner has suggested that G 7000X was Hetepheres' original tomb and that her second tomb was the Pyramid G1-a. He conjectured that the mummy of the queen was removed from G 7000X when the pyramid was completed and that some of the grave goods were left behind when the queen was reburied. A third possibility, outlined by I. E. S. Edwards in his review of Lehner's theory, is that G 7000X was meant to be Hetepheres' final resting place and that the mummy was robbed from that structure shortly after her burial. It may be possible that a superstructure in the form of a pyramid was planned for shaft G 7000X. Dr. Zahi Hawass has suggested that Hetepheres was originally buried at G1-a, the northernmost of the small pyramids, and that after the robbery a new shaft was excavated for a new tomb. This would explain the evidence of tampering on the tomb objects.  Grave treasures  Royal bed with headrest from the funerary furniture of Hetepheres. Bed length is 177 centimeters. Reconstruction of original on display in Cairo, this copy resides in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. Hetepheres' sarcophagus and funerary furniture were discovered in 1925 near the satellite pyramids of the Great Pyramid of Giza in shaft G 7000X of a pit tomb.Aidan Dodson & Dyan Hilton, The Complete Royal Families of Ancient Egypt, Thames & Hudson (2004), p. 57. Although the sarcophagus was sealed and the Canopic chest were intact, Hetepheres' mummy was missing. The chest, a large square box with four smaller square compartments inside, is one of the oldest examples known, so it has been suggested that Hetepheres may have been one of the first Egyptian royals to have her organs preserved. Of the four interior squares all contained organic matter but two of the squares also contained liquid. Ensuing test revealed the liquid to be a three percent solution of Egyptian natron in water, which was used in the mummification process.George Reisner, ‚ÄúThe Empty Sarcophagus of the Mother of Cheops‚Äù, Bulletin of the Museum of Fine Arts (Museum of Fine Arts, Boston) Vol. 26, No. 157 (Oct., 1928), p. 81.

The band has been \\"linked to a spirit of folky 1960's revivalism,\\" and they were called one of the leaders of the \\"freak folk\\" scene. Praised for their recordings, the band also organized a number of small folk festivals in Northern California. The band eschewed commercial exposure, having chosen a relatively quiet and luxury-free life‚Äîthey have lived in cars, tents, converted chicken-coops, and cabins, and have recorded music using solar power. They were described as \\"back-to-the-land idealists and activists\\" who are influenced by such writers and activists as Edward Abbey, Leonard Peltier, Henry David Thoreau, Allen Ginsberg, and Carlos Castaneda. Shineywater also cites Ram Dass, Rachel Grimes, and Hamza El Din. History In 2002, while called Brightblack, the band recorded an album named Ala.Cali.Tucky of songs they had performed while called Rainywood, on Galaxia Records. The album was well-received, and praised for its vocal harmonies. The current band was founded in 2004. In 2005 BrightBlack Morning Light played at All Tomorrow's Parties, a music festival in England, at the invitation of the Kentucky band Slint. That same year the band signed with Matador Records and released their eponymous debut album, sold in Europe as well as America. In Belgium, the album received a positive review as well, in the weekly HUMO. The New York Times called it \\"extraordinary\\" and praised it for its \\"mesmerizing, hollowed- out grooves.\\" In 2008, Matador released BBML's Motion to Rejoin. The album was recorded in New Mexico, electricity for the recording sessions was generated by four solar power panels. Motion to Rejoin received attention in the United States as well as in Europe, \\"Top 5 Alternative Albums of 2008\\" UK GUARDIAN, with reviews and press coverage in Belgium and Germany. In the year of 2009 BBML headlined/toured extensively multiple times across the USA and Europe, including Transmusicales France & ATP curation by My Bloody Valentine. In 2012 the band had a digital release entitled \\"LIVE JOURNAL ONE Instrumentals (2006 & 2008)\\". After BBML fizzled out, Naybob Shineywater had a solo project entitled Library of Sands. Quiet Quiet music festivals The \\"Quiet Quiet\\" festivals were first started by Shineywater in 2003 in Bolinas, California, and have been organized in various locations in the area, including Big Sur. Bands and artists invited to play have included harpist Joanna Newsom, Women & Children, Lavender Diamond, Sunroof!,Ramblin Jack Elliott, Will Oldham, and Devendra Banhart. In 2006, the line-up included Greenwich Village folk veteran Michael Hurley, members of the post-hardcore band Lungfish, Vetiver, & the debut of Northern California folk singer Mariee Sioux, who BBML also took on national & European tour as main support. At an early Quiet Quiet gig in Bolinas, signs appeared at road junctions directing those interested where to go. At the gig itself, held at Smiley's Saloon in Bolinas & the Bolinas Community Center, locals mixed uneasily with hipsters there for the gig, and Shineywater could be heard repeatedly hushing the crowd so that the unamplified bands could be heard above the saloon din. However, the Community Center show was extremely profitable for the musicians & audience. The City Of Bolinas banned camping on the beach just weeks after the festival, because so many tents appeared on the local beach. Shineywater encouraged the beach as a place to camp for \\"all those too wasted to drive back to San Francisco.\\" Line-up *Rachael Hughes ‚Äì keyboards *Nathan Shineywater ‚Äì guitar, slide guitar, keys =Supporting musicians= *Noah Wilson ‚Äì drums *Elias Reitz ‚Äì percussion *Otto Hauser ‚Äì drums *Andy Macleod ‚Äì drums *Paz Lenchantin ‚Äì bass guitar *Gail West ‚Äì vocals *Ann McCrary ‚Äì vocals *Matthew Davis ‚Äì Trombone *Stuart Bogie ‚Äì Saxophone *M.Bauder ‚Äì Flute *Robbie Lee ‚Äì Flute Discography *Ala.Cali.Tucky (2003, Galaxia) *Brightblack Morning Light (2006, Matador Records) *Motion to Rejoin (2008, Matador Records) *Lungfish/Brightblack Morning Light (2009, Split 7\\", Harvest Recordings) *2012 \\"LIVE JOURNAL ONE Instrumentals (2006 & 2008) digital iTUNES release See also * Psychedelic folk * Freak folk * Anti-folk * Neofolk References External links * Brightblack Morning Light site Category:American folk musical groups Category:Psychedelic folk groups ","title":"Brightblack Morning Light"},{"id":"6615674","text":"Wars Like Whispers is the first EP by the artist On the Last Day.

Originally known as the 541st Air Force Band of the Southwest, stationed at Luke AFB, Arizona, the unit relocated to Pease AFB, New Hampshire in 1978. Renamed the Air Force Band of New England, the band brought its musical message of pride, patriotism, and professionalism to concerts and events throughout New England. In 1991, the band received its current name and was assigned to Electronics Systems Center, Hanscom Air Force Base, in Massachusetts. This change fostered another new name: the United States Air Force Band of Liberty. The Band of Liberty consists of forty-five active duty personnel assigned to two primary ensembles‚Äîthe Concert Band and the Afterburner popular music group. The organization has several subgroups, including the Ceremonial/Marching Band, Liberty Big Band, Colonial Brass, New England Winds woodwind quintet, and the Bay State Winds clarinet quartet. The band performs around four hundred engagements a year, and has appeared at such venues as Lincoln Center in New York City and the Hatch Shell in Boston. On January 20, 2009, the Band of Liberty's Colonial Brass provided musical support at the Farewell Ceremony of President George W. Bush. On January 3, 2007, members of the Ceremonial Band performed at Grace Episcopal Church in East Grand Rapids, Michigan for the state funeral of Gerald Ford, 38th President of the United States.

History The idea for a joint service was initially put forward in July 1996 and in October of the same year signed a Memorandum of Understanding for the merger of their ferry interests on the Short Sea routes. The go ahead was given to the merger towards the end of 1997 by UK, French and EU authorities and the new company began on 10 March 1998 with joint livery being officially unveiled the day before. Ownership of the new company was 60/40 in favour of P&O; with all shore and sea management performed by P&O.; Voting rights between the two companies was 50/50. Both P&O; and Stena also put various building assets into the merger. An example of which was P&O; Stena Lines \\"Central Preparation\\" kitchens in the western docks, and their training centre (both ex. British Rail buildings). Channel House, P&O;'s Dover headquarters were leased from P&O; Corporate in London to P&O; Stena Line. The Newhaven-Dieppe service was closed in early 1999. P&O; Stena was replaced on the route by Transmanche Ferries and Hoverspeed. In April 2002, P&O; announced its intention to buy out the 40% stake in P&O; Stena Line owned by Stena and this was completed by August. P&O; Stena Line then became part of P&O; Ferries. Ships On completion of the merger, P&O; European Ferries volunteered 8 vessels into the newly formed group: * Pride of Bruges * Pride of Burgundy * Pride of Calais * Pride of Dover * Pride of Kent * European Highway * European Pathway * European Seaway The first five being ROPAX ships sailing Dover to Calais, the last three being dedicated Freight only RORO vessels sailing Dover to Zeebrugge. Stena Line volunteered 6 vessels into the newly formed group: * Stena Antrim * Stena Cambria * Stena Empereur * Stena Fantasia * Stena Invicta * Stena Lynx III The first two vessels were sailing on the Newhaven to Dieppe route, the following three vessels on Dover to Calais, and the fastcraft Lynx 3 was a multipurpose HSC craft operating primarily from Newhaven, but also capable having done so in the past operating from Dover. (The name Lynx is rooted in the company's past when operating as Stena Sealink Line - the company's first two HSC Craft were named Stena SeaLynx I and Stena SeaLynx II.) It was decided due to the freight capacity of the Stena Invicta that she would be unviable in a service that had to cut its tonnage down as part of the merger agreements, so she was laid up in France awaiting Charter and never saw active service with P&OSL.; There was speculation that she would return to service with the company during the annual drydocking periods to serve as a relief vessel, but this never happened. Stena Antrim was also withdrawn immediately and was laid up until being sold. Initially the P&O; Stena Line fleet was made up of 12 active vessels, these were:- Multi-purpose vessels *Pride of Bruges later P&OSL; Picardy * later P&OSL; Burgundy * later P&OSL; Calais * later P&OSL; Dover * later P&OSL; Kent * *Stena Empereur later P&OSL; Provence * later P&OSL; Canterbury Freight Ferries  Fastcraft *Elite While all Dover vessels initially kept their pre-merger names, they were gradually changed during each vessels annual refit and the P&OSL; prefix was adopted in 1999 replacing Pride of and Stena prefixes. As a result, Stena Fantasia and Stena Empereur received new names of P&OSL; Canterbury and P&OSL; Provence respectively. At Newhaven the Stena Lynx III was renamed Elite in advance of the merger, Stena Cambria kept its name until the closure of the Newhaven-Dieppe service at the start of 1999. The Elite fastcraft was returned to Stena Line and regained its original name, the Stena Cambria was sold. It was originally intended that P&OSL; Picardy would transfer to POSL's Newhaven- Dieppe route. It was planned that a central loading ramp between the upper and lower vehicle decks would be fabricated and fitted, as Dover vessel operate with two loading ramps, whilst many other ports only operate with one. However this did not occur and the planned transfer never took place. The P&OSL; Picardy remained on the Dover-Calais route until 2001, and then spent several months laid up in France before being sold to a smaller rival firm operating from Ramsgate - TEF Shipping. Today she is the only one of the original three Spirit Class vessel still sailing in UK waters. The other active sister ship, P&OSL; Kent is now sailing for a Greek operator. The third vessel was the ill- fated Herald of Free Enterprise that capsized off the port of Zeebrugge in the late 1980s. During 1998, P&O; Stena chartered Stena Royal for use on the Dover-Zeebrugge freight service. The ship was later renamed and refitted P&OSL; Aquitaine. The fleet remained the same until the purchase of Stena Line's share in the company by P&O; in 2002. An announcement was made that the Dover-Zeebrugge service would close but the actual closure occurred under P&O; Ferries management in December 2002 Brands P&O; Stena introduced the Brand World concept now found on many of the current P&O; Ferries fleet. Finnegan Consultancy Group developed and implemented the original Brand World strategy which brought about a standard image across the fleet. The brands were:- *Club Class :Executive quiet lounge, not previously found on the former Stena Line vessels. *Langan's Brasserie :Replaced the waiter service restaurants on the Dover fleet. *Harbour Coffee Company :Caf√© *NYC Deli :Sandwich Outlet *First Base Burgers :Fast Food Outlet/Burger Bar *International Food Court :Self- service restaurant. *Silverstones Bar :A Formula 1 based Sports Bar and Lounge. Features large scale models of F1 cars and general F1 memorabilia from Silverstone Circuit. *Horizon Lounge :Lounge area normally with a bar or Harbour Coffee Company outlet. *Coca-Cola Megadrome :Video games arcade As of 2007, P&O; Ferries have begun removing some of their familiar Brand world theming throughout their fleet. The three main affected brands are: *Silverstones Bar has been replaced with \\"the bar\\" *Horizons Lounge, now known as \\"the family lounge\\" *Harbour Coffee Company has been changed to \\"the caf√©\\" Former P&O; Stena operations today The Dover-Calais service has essentially returned to its pre-merger P&O; European Ferries form with no former Stena Line ships remaining. Ships that were to remain in the P&O; Ferries fleet either returned to their original \\"Pride of\\" names (except PO Canterbury and PO Kent) or gained the prefix. European Pathway and European Highway were converted into multi-purpose vessels and became Pride of Canterbury and Pride of Kent respectively replacing PO Canterbury and PO Kent which after the end of P&O; Stena Line lost the '&' and 'SL' from their names. Pride of Provence and Pride of Aquitaine were later withdrawn as part of the review of P&O; Ferries operations announced in September 2004. The Newhaven- Dieppe service was run by Transmanche Ferries but the service has been put out to tender in early 2007 as part of the French operators parent company plan. The successful bid was submitted by Paris-based Louis Drefus (LD) Lines, who also operate the Portsmouth - Le Havre service. Use of the P&O; Stena logo today The POSL logo still lives on today, although across the other side of the globe from the English Channel, in Singapore. Austen Maritime Services is purportedly the last joint P&O;/Stena operation, and although nothing to do with the Ferries operations, retains the logo.

Amazonas Region =La Chumaichada= La Chumaichada is \\"the dance of Chachapoyas\\" because it was born in this area and it was widely practised until becoming institutionalized. No holiday or celebration is complete if it is not danced. The music has probably an Indian origin, but the choreography has a French origin stemming from \\"Los Lanceros\\" (The lancers) - dance inserted in Chachapoyas by the bishop of the diocese at that time, monsignor Emilio Liss√≥n, of French origin. It has been said that he had so much influence that the city became Frenchified during his time. =Los Danzantes de Levanto= Levanto is a little town that is approximately 10 km away from Chachapoyas, whose \\"dancers\\" form a very well trained showy group of thirteen cholos, that are guided by a \\"pifador\\" (a person who whistles) that plays the antara and a small drum called the tinya simultaneously. They wear a white shirt of wide and long sleeves, a black vest adorned with red ribbons and black trousers. They also wear a crown of showy peacock's feathers. Their presence is important in all the big celebrations of the region. Other well- known dances that are performed in diverse localities are: * The \\"Conchiperla\\", in which the man gives a handkerchief to his partner keeping a knee in the ground and if he doesn't do it, a glass of liqueur must be drunk in punishment. * The \\"Trapichillo\\", danced by four couples grabbed by the right hands and turning around from right to left side * The \\"Quinsamana\\", in which insult compliments are mixed. =Carnaval in Amazonas= The \\"carnival music\\" that is played in of real euphoria. It is similar to the huayno. At its times, couples dance forming the pandilla (a kind of dance) around the humishas - trees adorned with quitasue√±os, small mirrors, ornamental chain stitches and pennants. These trees are filled with gifts, including live animals, which the guests take when these trees are knocked down at the end of the celebration. The couple that makes the humisha fall down in a Mardi gras celebration has the commitment to make a new humisha from the following year onward.

The station simulcasts the signal of KSOL (98.9 MHz) in San Francisco. KSOL and KSQL program a format consisting of regional Mexican music and talk shows. Both stations are owned by Univision. Its studios are in the Financial District of San Francisco, and the KSQL transmitter is in the Los Gatos Mountains. There are two booster stations for KSOL: KSOL-FM2 in Sausalito since 1992, and KSOL-FM3 in Pleasanton since 1997. History KSQL was originally built in 1962 as KSCO-FM, owned by the Santa Cruz Sentinel newspaper. Due to close-spacing of 99.1 to San Francisco's 98.9, interference between the stations had been a longtime problem. When Viacom bought 98.9 in San Francisco, they also bought KSCO-FM 99.1 and began simulcasting the stations. They also began using similar callsigns. The 98.9 MHz frequency in San Francisco is the third station to use the callsign KSOL. The first was the AM rhythm and blues station at 1450 kHz (the current KEST). The second was a popular soul music station at 107.7 MHz (now known as KSAN). The current KSOL is unrelated to the previous two stations. *See also KSAN (FM) and KEST The station at 99.1 MHz was, for many years, KLRS (\\"Colors\\"), airing a New Age music format targeting Santa Cruz and San Jose. The station was eventually purchased Viacom The two stations tweaked KOFY's adult album alternative format and adopted the call letters KDBK (98.9 MHz) and KDBQ (99.1 MHz) - \\"Double 99\\" in July 1990. \\"Star FM\\" arrived on the two frequencies in Spring 1993, as the call letters KSRY and KSRI were picked up for the stations' hot adult contemporary format. One year later, the station at 107.7 MHz switched their call letters to KYLD in April 1994, but was already called \\"WiLD 107\\" since 1992 as a Rhythmic formatted station. The KSOL call letters were put on then-co-owned 98.9 MHz frequency, with the format switching to urban adult contemporary. The south signal of 99.1 MHz became a simulcast of \\"WiLD 107\\" as KYLZ. Both KSOL and KYLZ were sold in August 1996. On August 15 of that year, KSOL switched to a Regional Mexican music format, and 99.1 MHz became KZOL, again a simulcast. In April 2002, KSOL swapped call letters with KEMR (105.7 MHz) in San Jose, and shifted toward a Spanish-language adult contemporary approach, with 99.1 MHz becoming KZMR. When 105.7 MHz switched formats and call letters to KVVF, the KSOL call letters returned to 98.9 MHz, with 99.1 MHz redubbed KZOL. The two station have simulcasted since 1990, with 98.9 MHz covering the north bay, and 99.1 MHz covering the far south bay.

It is closely related to the Kirundi and Kinyarwanda spoken in neighbouring Burundi and Rwanda, and belongs to the Niger-Congo family of languages. Society and culture The Ha people call the lake bordering area they live in as Buha, and the region consists of grasslands and open woodlands. The Ha people share the northwestern part of Tanzania with the Sukuma, the Haya, the Zinza, the Hangaza and the Subi ethnic groups. The Ha people grow sorghum, millet, corn (maize), cassava, yams, peanuts and other crops. Wherever the tse tse fly problem is minor, the Ha people raise cattle, goats and other livestocks that are highly valued in the Ha society and gifted at marriage. In the northern parts of their territories, where the tse tse fly problem is significant, they hunt and gather honey. The Ha people live in dispersed homes, typically as a joint family whose male members are related by their lineage. Since about the 18th century, the Tutsi people have lived among the Ha people, but as a small minority (2%), but typically in an aristocratic role. The two ethnic groups substantially share language, culture and some have intermarried. The Ha women share some of the cultural traditions with other neighboring ethnic groups, such as wearing the Kitindi, or coiled bracelets made of copper wire worn near the elbow. The Ha people are animists who revere their ancestors as well as nature spirits. Their traditional religion includes Imana deity as their supreme being and creator. They have witnessed Islamic missionary activity from the Arabs since the pre-colonial era and Christian missionary activity during the German and British colonial era thereafter from Roman Catholics, Anglicans, Lutherans, and others. In later years, many men from the Ha people have wandered to the Tanzanian coastline to work at sisal plantations there.

The fossil beds were laid down in a lake roughly 15-million-years ago, when a drainage basin was dammed by the flood basalts of the Columbia River Plateau. Narrow and deep, the lake's cold, anoxic water and rapid sedimentation created perfect fossil conditions. The basin itself has remained tectonically stable, with little deformation since then. The fossils indicate that the region's climate was much warmer and wetter than today's, and similar to that of southern Florida.Anonymous( 2006) Digging Up Ancient Treasures in Clarkia. New West, August Publications.Rember WC (2007) The Clarkia Flora of northern Idaho. University of Idaho, Moscow, Idaho. Though a number of animal species have been found, the Clarkia fossil beds site is best known for its fossil leaves. Their preservation is exquisite; fresh leaves are unfossilized, and sometimes retain their fall colors before rapidly oxidizing in air. It has been reported that scientists have managed to isolate small amounts of ancient DNA from fossil leaves from this site.Kim, S, DE Soltis, PS Soltis, and Y Suh (2004) DNA sequences from Miocene fossils: an ndhF sequence of Magnolia latahensis (Magnoliaceae) and an rbcL sequence of Persea pseudocarolinensis (Lauraceae). American Journal of Botany. 91(4):615-620. However, other scientists are skeptical of the validity of this reported occurrence of Miocene DNA.

A small town in La Mancha. it was likely founded after the meeting between Alfonso X (the wise) and his son-in-law, Jaime I of Arag√≥n to settle the ownership of the recently captured territory. Local legend has it that this fertile, well-watered area was settled by crossbowmen (\\"ballestero\\" in Spanish) now redundant following the cessation of hostilities. The town was established around a crossroads on the main road between Munera and Robledo. Like many of the small towns in La Mancha, El Ballestero lost a significant share of its population in the mid-20th century. In the 1949 census, El Ballestero had 1,858 inhabitants, but the population shrank over the following decades; in the peak emigration year, 1964, over 500 left. The emigrants largely moved to large cities and the coast, where employment opportunities had increased in the growing tourist industry. In recent years, many abandoned homes have been purchased by people from Madrid, Valencia and other large cities who have refurbished them as second homes. Over the last 10 years, the number of abandoned houses still in ruins has reduced substantially. Facilities The town hosts an 18th-century church built in the Renaissance style, two bars serving food, a supermarket, a pharmacy, a bread shop, a hairdresser, a public library, a bank, a school and an Olympic-sized swimming pool which is open to the public in July and August. On weekends, a music bar (Spins) opens its doors. There is a small market held on Thursdays. There are also various guest houses (casas rurales) and a small hotel. Economy The main industry is farming (largely lamb, wheat and barley), but there is also a large factory producing embutidos and hams. https://www.elconchel.com/en/ El Ballestero has many wind turbines. In June, crops are harvested and the countryside looks like a prairie. La Mancha has the slow-growing Juniperus sabina, now fully protected and beginning to rebound.. Tourism The town is on the Ruta de Don Quijote, and nearby attractions include Libisosa, the remains of a Roman town near Lezuza; Alcaraz, a medieval town; Las Lagunas de Ruidera; and the Sierra de Alcaraz, a home to wildlife. El Santuario de Nuestra Se√±ora de Cortes is also nearby. In addition to the fictional hero Don Quixote, Hannibal, the Carthaginian general who almost conquered Rome in the 3rd century BCE also passed close to the town along a prehistoric track that crosses the Iberian Peninsula; this ancient road was rebuilt by the Romans, and some 800 metres remain in good condition north of town. The Ca√±ada Real de Los Serranos, which forms part of the medieval network of cattle tracks across Spain between Cordoba and Teruel is slightly further north. Climate In summer, the temperature during the day is significantly hotter than in coastal towns such as Benidorm. However, because of its elevation of 3,000 feet (1045 metres) above sea level, the nights stay cool even in midsummer , and the town fills with people from the coast and Madrid in July and August, many with secondary homes here. In autumn, the town is popular with those who hunt the abundant hares, rabbits and partridges. In winter, the temperature can fall well below zero and it snows several times a year, although it tends to melt after a few days. The main local fiestas are San Lorenzo (10 August) and San Miguel (29 September). Virgen de la Encarnaci√≥n A local tradition that takes place on Whitsunday and the Feast of St Michael is Virgen de la Encarnaci√≥n, celebrating events that took place 400 years ago. According to tradition, in the 17th century, a severe plague outbreak occurred in Villalgordal, a small village 14 km south of El Ballestero. This epidemic killed most of the population; this was possibly the Great Plague of Seville of 1646 to 1652. Once it was over, the survivors decided to burn down the village on health grounds and moved to the surrounding towns. The majority came to El Ballestero and brought with them their \\"Virgen de la Encarnaci√≥n\\", a statue of the Virgin Mary slightly smaller than life size, to place in the local church. Each Whitsunday, the villagers come together and carry her over the old track to the site of Villalgordal which is now merely a stony field with a small refurbished chapel in the middle of it overlooking a river. Once they get to Villalgordal, the Virgin is returned to her original home in the chapel and a mass is celebrated. The town then provides a meal for all the participants and spectators. Once this is over, the chapel is locked up and the townsfolk return home. On 29 September, during the Fiesta de San Miguel, there is another Mass at Villalgordal and, after another meal, she is carried back to El Ballestero being met at the entrance to the town by floats depicting local life. She is escorted back to the church whilst bonfires are lit in celebration of her return. This is followed by a firework display. The statue spends the winter in the church and is returned to its summer chapel the following year. This has been done for around 400 years.

History On October 19, 1687, the Connecticut Colonial General Court granted Captain William Blackwell a patent for a separate township laid out south of Mashamoquet Brook, six miles east to west and seven miles north to south, to be called Mortlake. Captain Blackwell chose that name to honor Mortlake in Surrey, England (now part of greater London). Geographically, the northbound followed Mashamoquet Brook, the eastbound followed the Quinebaug. The western boundary was approximately half mile west of and parallel to today‚Äôs Connecticut State Route 169, while the southern boundary laid approximately half mile north of today‚Äôs U.S. Route 6 ‚Äì looking at a map, it roughly aligned with Herrick Road and the part of Brown Road that runs more or less straight east-west. This patent was in the form of a Manor, a form of tenure restricted to certain Proprietary colonies, a large estate with hereditary rights granted by Royal Charter, ‚Äì a legal anomaly in Connecticut, where it was outside of the power and authority of any Town. Jurisdiction in Mortlake did not rest in an elected town government, but as property right that could be bought and sold. Falling outside the legal framework that Connecticut organized Towns, Mortlake‚Äôs residents found themselves without responsibilities, but also without normal rights (such as to levy taxes to pay for roads and general welfare of its inhabitants). Indeed, once Windham County was established the very first case heard in its courts was a lawsuit by the Town of Norwich to force Mortlake to pay for the care of ‚Äúthe poor, witless Peter Davison‚Äù who resided originally in Mortlake. Massachusetts Governor Johnathan Belcher, who had purchased Mortlake from Captain Blackwell, was successfully defended by his attorney with the argument that Mortlake as a Manor did not have the same responsibilities to the poor as a Town would. The Town of Pomfret bordered Mortlake to the North, West, and after Pomfret was expanded southward taking a portion of Canterbury, on the South as well. This southernmost part of Pomfret being the area today known as Brooklyn Center. In 1731, an ecclesiastical society was formed to establish a Congregational Church for the benefit of the residents of the area ‚Äì consisting of the southern half of Mortlake (the present Brooklyn / Pomfret town line), the southernmost parts of Pomfret, and the northern section of Canterbury. It would take four years, but in 1735 the society was formally named the odd construct, ‚ÄúThe Society taken out of Pomfret, Canterbury, and Mortlake.‚Äù The area was referred to as Mortlake Parish, with the church referred to as the Second Church of Pomfret. In 1739, Governor Belcher sold portions of Mortlake to Israel Putnam and John Pope of Salem, Massachusetts. Putnam would settle in Mortlake, and later buy out Pope. The remaining portions of Mortlake were sold to Godfrey Malbone of Newport, Rhode Island by Governor Belcher the following year. The lack of town status continued to be a problem ‚Äì residents of the southern village of Pomfret had to cross for some seven miles through Mortlake before re-entering Pomfret again. Further, at the time Town taxes were levied to support the Church ‚Äì but the portions of Mortlake Parish within Mortlake Manor laid outside of either Pomfret or Canterbury, and thus couldn‚Äôt be taxed to support the Church its residents where expected to attend. Finally in May 1752, the General Court decided ‚Äúthat this tract of Mortlake shall be accounted, taken, and doomed to belong to Pomfret.‚Äù At the same time, they also replaced the lengthy name of the ecclesiastical society with the much simpler, ‚ÄúSociety of Brooklyn‚Äù known as Brooklyn Parish. In 1775 Israel Putnam, who held a commission from the Colony of Connecticut as a Major General, was plowing a field in Brooklyn Center (near where the library is today) when word reached him of the Battle of Lexington and Concord. Leaving his plow in the field, he rode a relay of horses to reach Boston in only 18 hours, taking command of the rebel forces, and at Breed‚Äôs Hill uttering the famous, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt shoot until you see the whites of their eyes!‚Äù Brooklyn Parish in 1786 would be set off from Pomfret and Canterbury to become a town in its own right. In the 1920s and 30s, Edith Kermit Carow, wife of Theodore Roosevelt, operated an old family property as Mortlake House ‚Äì a country inn for vacationing city visitors. Mrs. Roosevelt was a descendant of the Tyler family, and the Tylers where related by marriage to the Putnams. Mortlake House was demolished in the late 1960s. Today, the Post Office stands on that spot, with a large equestrian statute of General Putnam adjacent to it, and the Daniel Tyler Law Office, which serves as the small museum of the Brooklyn Historical Society, at the rear of the property. The Tyler family continues to maintain the family homestead, Putnam Elms, on Church Street in Brooklyn as a historical site that is occasionally open to the general public. In 1927 the citizens of Brooklyn Center established a volunteer fire department, and as a nod to both the history of the area being known as Mortlake and to Mrs. Roosevelt and her establishment named the organization, ‚ÄúThe Mortlake Fire Company of Brooklyn, Connecticut, Inc.‚Äù ‚Äì which carries that name until this day.

It is taken by mouth. Side effects of norethandrolone include symptoms of masculinization like acne, increased hair growth, voice changes, and increased sexual desire. It can also cause estrogenic effects like fluid retention, breast tenderness, and breast enlargement in men and liver damage. The drug is a synthetic androgen and anabolic steroid and hence is an agonist of the androgen receptor (AR), the biological target of androgens like testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT). It has strong anabolic effects relative to its androgenic effects. The drug also has strong progestogenic effects. Norethandrolone was discovered in 1953 and was introduced for medical use in 1956. It was the first AAS with a favorable separation of anabolic and androgenic effect to be marketed. The drug was mostly withdrawn in the 1980s due to concerns of liver damage. In addition to its medical use, norethandrolone has been used to improve physique and performance. The drug is a controlled substance in many countries and so non-medical use is generally illicit. Medical uses Norethandrolone has been used in the treatment of muscle wasting, patients with severe burns, after severe trauma, and for certain forms of aplastic anemia among other indications. Side effects Side effects of norethandrolone include virilization among others. It has estrogenic effects and can cause gynecomastia and fluid retention. As with all 17Œ±-alkylated AAS, long-term use of norethandrolone in high doses may result in hepatotoxicity including elevated liver enzymes and cirrhosis. Pharmacology =Pharmacodynamics= Norethandrolone is an androgen and anabolic steroid and hence is an agonist of the androgen receptor, the biological target of androgens like testosterone and dihydrotestosterone. It has a high ratio of anabolic to androgenic activity. Analogously to the case of nandrolone and 5Œ±-dihydronandrolone, 5Œ±-dihydronorethandrolone, the 5Œ±-reduced metabolite of norethandrolone, shows diminished affinity for the androgen receptor relative to norethandrolone. This is likely related to the high ratio of anabolic to androgenic activity observed with norethandrolone. Norethandrolone has relatively high estrogenic activity via transformation by aromatase into the potent estrogen ethylestradiol. It also has strong progestogenic activity. The progestogenic potency of norethandrolone is similar to that of norethisterone in terms of endometrial changes in women. In addition, norethandrolone is hepatotoxic. =Pharmacokinetics= The pharmacokinetics of norethandrolone have been reviewed. Chemistry Norethandrolone, also known as 17Œ±-ethyl-19-nortestosterone or as 17Œ±-ethylestr-4-en-17Œ≤-ol-3-one, is a synthetic estrane steroid and a 17Œ±-alkylated derivative of testosterone and 19-nortestosterone (nandrolone). It is closely related to normethandrone (17Œ±-methyl-19-nortestosterone) and to ethylestrenol (3-deketo-17Œ±-ethyl-19-nortestosterone). =Synthesis= Chemical syntheses of norethandrolone have been published. History Norethandrolone was synthesized at G. D. Searle & Company in 1953 and was originally studied as a progestin, along with norethisterone and noretynodrel, but ultimately was not marketed as such. In 1955, it was re-examined for testosterone-like activity and was found to have similar anabolic activity to testosterone but only one- sixteenth the androgenic potency. Norethandrolone was introduced for medical use as an AAS in 1956 and was the first so-called \\"anabolic steroid\\", or AAS with a favorable separation of anabolic and androgenic effect, to be marketed. It was followed by normethandrone as a progestin in 1957 and by the more well- known AAS nandrolone phenylpropionate in 1959. Norethandrolone was introduced in the United States in the late 1950s under the brand name Nilevar but was discontinued in this country in the 1960s due to limited sales. Although it was also introduced into Europe and certain other markets, it was withdrawn in many countries in the 1980s due to concerns of cholestatic jaundice. Today, the drug remains available only in France. Society and culture =Generic names= Norethandrolone is the generic name of the drug and its and . It has also been referred to as noretandrolone, ethylnandrolone, and ethylnortestosterone, as well as by its developmental code name CB-8022. =Brand names= Norethandrolone is marketed under the brand names Nilevar and Pronabol. =Availability= Norethandrolone is available today only in France.https://www.micromedexsolutions.com/ Research Norethandrolone has been studied for use in male hormonal contraception.

It lies 61 km (37.9 mi) from the provincial capital and had a population of 2,639 as of 2011.  Etymology  According to tradition, the name Fuente-√Ålamo (\\"poplar spring\\") comes from a nearby spring located near a poplar that no longer stands.  Geography  Fuente-√Ålamo lies in the southeastern part of Albacete province at 800 m (2624.67 ft) above sea level.  History  The first settlers of the area lived in caves in nearby mountains or small, fragile dwellings. Neolithic ruins have been found in Las Colleras, El Mainetico, and El Mainet√≥n neighborhoods. Celtiberian and Roman ruins, in addition to their Neolithic counterparts, have been found on nearby Mount Fortaleza. The first written records of Fuente-√Ålamo date to 1265, when the site was part of the fiefdom of Alpera and was named for its renowned springs (\\"Fuentes de Alamo\\"). In 1269, the area became the village of Chinchilla de Monte-Arag√≥n within the Seigneury of Villena, owned by the family of Manueles de Villena. At that time, Fuente-√Ålamo became pastureland and saw the first influx of shepherds. The creation of the Marquessate of Villena united Chinchilla and Fuente-√Ålamo, and they stayed united when the Spanish crown assumed control in 1480, in the wake of a peasant revolt against the marquess Diego L√≥pez Pacheco y Portocarrero. By the 16th century, there was already a small village with a hermitage and cemetery, none of which remain. In the mid-18th century, the site of present-day Fuente-√Ålamo passed to the Region of Murcia, only to become part of the short-lived Province of Chinchilla in 1823, which lasted only a year. In 1833, the current Province of Albacete was established, and that same year Fuente-√Ålamo was chartered a town. 19th- century mayor Miguel L√≥pez del Castillo Tejada favored agriculture and therefore gave up significant portions of the town, shifting the city's center toward the neighborhood of Cerr√≥n. The Diccionario de Madoz (Dictionary of Madoz, 1845-1850) includes the following entry on Fuente-√Ålamo in the mid-19th century: Since the 1960s, the town has experienced the fastest population growth in its history.  Economy  The town's economy is predominantly agricultural. The hot, arid climate lends itself to viticulture and olive growing, and to a lesser extent to the cultivation of barley, oats, and almonds. Although the area isn't recognizably pastoral, livestock are raised alongside crops. Sheep and goats are dwindling in number as the wool market shrinks and pasture lands become scarcer. Pork, however, is a growth industry here. Industry is growing at an impressive rate, and the community is reaping the benefits. The local vintners almost all belong to the Cooperativa Vitivin√≠cola San Dionisio (San Dionisio Vintners and Grape Growers Cooperative). Founded in 1957, the co-op has grown rapidly and releases its wines on the national market through the Jumilla Denomination of Origin. The local dairy industry, initiated in 1987 for local consumption, has grown enough to market nationally as well. The furniture and shoe industries are recent arrivals, courtesy of plants in nearby Yecla and Almansa. Since the 1960s, students from the Earth Science faculty from the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam (VU) have been visiting the town for its well-expressed geological outcrops.  Public services  The town has a clinic and an indoor recreational center with a pool.  Historic sites  * St. Dionysius the Areopagite's Church: The neoclassical parish church was designed in the 18th century by architect Lorenzo Alonso Franco. The church was consecrated in 1798. The foundation and lower parts are ashlar, but the upper areas are built in mamposter√≠a, the traditional dry stonework of the region. The modest facade features only a few angels over the doorway lintel, each bearing one of Dionysius's traditional emblems: the crosier, the palm, the book, and the mitre. A rectangular bell-tower tops off the structure. The church plan is an unusual nave covered with a cannon vault, with chapels nestled in the walls between Ionic columns. The flamboyant semicircular apse peaks in a dome, which was painted in 1954 with a fresco of the Assumption of Mary by Manuel Mu√±oz Barber√°n. Two doors open from each side of the altar, each leading from the apse to a separate sacristy. Each of these doors has medallions of the Annunciation and the Visitation painted on it. * Las Colleras: 7 km (4.35 mi) west of the center of town, in the eponymous mountains, lie a series of clefts (popularly known as toriles) in limestone cliffs. Here, archaeologists have found Neolithic dwellings, complete with tools from the period sandstone ready for quarrying. * Cerro Fortaleza: This hill is located 3 km (1.864 mi) south of town. At the summit are the ruins of a large fort where Neolithic, Celtiberian, and Roman artifacts have been found. The Neolithic sites include weapons made from sillimanite, a material not found in the region that implies the presence of trading networks.  Culture  = Festivals = * Patron Saint's Days: These are celebrated in honor of Saint Dionysius the Areopagite from October 8 to October 12. The festivities begin with the symbolic stomping of grapes in wooden barrels to make a wine offering for the patron saint, followed by an exhibition of regional dances. * Holy Week: The Brotherhoods of Jesus the Nazarene, the Via Dolorosa, and Saint John all participate. * Feast of Saint Mark: This is celebrated on April 25, with the making of traditional peasant lunch and dinner. The party continues into the next day, nicknamed San Marquicos. The lunch usually includes hornazo, a traditional pastry served with boiled eggs. * Dance of the Gazpachos: This is celebrated on August 14, with the making of the best torta de Gazpacho in the province. * Feasts of Saints Anthony and Blaise: It is customary to gather firewood and vine prunings as kindling, with which the family will burn useless or broken household objects at dusk on the eve of these saints' days, making bonfires in the streets. A popular expression recalling this practice goes: \\"La hoguerita de San Ant√≥n que nos guarde el chicharr√≥n; y la de San Blas que nos guarde la 'taj√°'\\" (We burn the pork rinds in Saint Anthony's fire, and the cuttings in Saint Blaise's). = Cuisine = The characteristic cuisine of Fuente-√Ålamo is rooted in the town's agrarian roots, brimming with strong, high-calorie dishes. The local specialty is the torta de Gazpacho, not to be confused with the Andalusian gazpacho. Though recipes vary, they all use flatbread. The torta de Gazpacho often includes game (rabbit, hare, partridge) and snail. Gazpacho viudo is made with potatoes, tomatoes, and peppers instead of meat. Another type of gazpacho viudo is made with bacon. Gazpacho con orugas is made with fresh arugula from the local fields and mountains. Another distinctive local dish is ajiharina, a porridge of flour, potatoes, and pieces of guarra, a regional sausage. Mataero porridge is common on pig slaughter days. This is made with flour or crackers and the pig's bacon and liver, often seasoned with a variety of spices. Mataero is often served on a bed of pine nuts. The ajibolo or mortared garlic shares the salt cod, potatoes, olive oil, and garlic of the standard atascaburras of La Mancha, but eschews the usual nuts. Gachasmigas, made with flour, potatoes, garlic, olive oil, water, and salt, is typical winter fare. In addition to these dishes, Fuente-√Ålamo produces its own goat cheese, now on a much larger scale than the home production of the past. Typical desserts include hornazo, arrope, butter cakes, flor frita, and sweetbreads.  References   Bibliography  * Au√±√≥n Rodr√≠guez, B. Ricardo (1984). Fuente√°lamo: ayer y hoy.

Life Born in Blandford Forum, Dorset, England, Bastard is best known for seven books of 285 epigrams entitled Chrestoleros published in 1598. He initially attended Winchester College. Subsequently he began studying at New College, Oxford on 27 August 1586. By 1588, he was assigned as a perpetual Fellow of New College. Though later expelled from his Fellowship, Bastard still received a BA in 1590, and an MA 16 years later in 1606. Bastard became notorious for libeling the sexual doings of various Oxford clergy and academics via a published tract entitled An Admonition to the city of Oxford, &c.; Despite disavowing authorship, he was nonetheless expelled from his Oxford fellowship in 1591. He still maintained a few supporters and admirers, primarily, Sir Charles Blount, Lord Mountjoy who appointed him as a chaplain, and Thomas Howard, 1st Earl of Suffolk who appointed him vicar of Bere Regis and later, in 1606, Rector of Almer in Dorset. Bastard was married three times. He died impoverished in the debtor's prison at Allhallows parish, Dorchester, and was buried in parish churchyard. Death Prior to Bastard's death, admirer Sir John Harrington said in a poem: :\\"To Master Bastard, a minister, that made a pleasant Book of English Epigrams: ::You must in pulpit treat of matters serious; ::As it beseems the person and the place; ::There preach of faith, repentance, hope, and grace; ::Of sacraments, and such high things mysterious: ::But they are too severe, and too imperious, ::That unto honest sports will grant no space. ::For these our minds refresh, those weary us, ::And spur out doubled spirit to swifter pace.\\" Sources *\\"Bastard, Thomas\\" in S.

The idea arose from the difficulty of programming the IBM SSEC machine when Backus was hired to calculate astronomical positions in early 1950. The speedcoding system was an interpreter and focused on ease of use at the expense of system resources. It provided pseudo-instructions for common mathematical functions: logarithms, exponentiation, and trigonometric operations. The resident software analyzed pseudo-instructions one by one and called the appropriate subroutine. Speedcoding was also the first implementation of decimal input/output operations. Although it substantially reduced the effort of writing many jobs, the running time of a program that was written with the help of Speedcoding was usually ten to twenty times that of machine code.Emerson W.

It has a population of 1,279 inhabitants (according to INE data for 2016). It comprises the districts of Ca√±ada de Tobarra, Casablanca, El Ginete, H√≠jar, Mullidar, Talave and La Alcadima. Among its temples is the church of Santiago Apostol.  History  Already in the pre-Roman times, small settlements of population and limited economic importance are found in the valley of the Mundo river. However, the urban nucleus on which the population later settled during the Middle Ages did not exist as such. Li√©tor emerged during the Islamic period of al-Andalus. The exact date of its foundation is not known, but it is estimated that it occurred around the tenth century. The archeological findings of \\"Los Infiernos\\" site prove the importance of Li√©tor as a border settlement during the Christian Reconquest.These items reflect a period of Muslim occupation in which the population was part of the border with the Christian kingdoms. The Arab knight whose objects were found in Los Infiernos, was probably spending long seasons warring and defending the territories of al-Andalus or trying to annex new ones. After the Reconquest, at the beginning of the 13th century, the monarch Fernando III donated the town to the Order of Santiago, an administrative unit that would last until the mid-nineteenth century. In the last third of 15th century, a number of knights (\\"caballeros de cuant√≠a\\") moved into the village. It was their occupation to wage war and control the borders with neighboring Muslim kingdoms, and in exchange they were exempt from a large part of the taxes which they would have had to otherwise pay to the coffers of the \\"encomienda\\" (administrative unit).  Heritage  Apart from its rbeautiful natural location, three monuments stand out, all of them declared of \\"Bienes de Inter√©s Cultural\\" (\\"Heritage of cultural interest\\", a category of the heritage register in Spain): = Church of Santiago Ap√≥stol = The church of Santiago Ap√≥stol was declared of Cultural Interest on December 22, 1992. Located in the Plaza Mayor (Major Square), the temple was probably raised on the site of another medieval building, from which only the tower is preserved. The aforementioned tower is estimated to have been constructed in the late fifteenth or early sixteenth century. This squared tower is a solid construction of ashlar, with gargoyles in the corners. Inside the temple we find the \\"Espino\\" chapel, founded in 1669 by Don Juan de Vandelvira and his wife, Dona Mariana de Tovarra; which consists of a large space covered with dome and a large altarpiece in the background, dating from the year 1720. The general construction of the temple was undertaken on the second half of the eighteenth century. The church consists of Latin cross floor plan, three naves, enclosed chapels and a flat head. This expansion conducted in the 18th century was planned due to the increase of population of the town, which was in need of a larger parish. Among the artistic works preserved in the temple is the main altarpiece with a simulated perspective of the main chapel, which is a work by the Italian Paolo Sistori. The church also has a magnificent baroque organ, with a wooden box in rococo style, made in 1787 by the master Joseph Lopis. There is also an important imagery collection: works by Francisco Salzillo (Dolorosa and Esperanza), Roque L√≥pez (Our Lady of Soledad), Baglieto (San Jos√©) or Jos√© S√°nchez Lozano (Our Father Jesus). = Convent and church of Carmelitas Descalzos = The Convent (and the church) of the Carmelites was declared of Cultural Interest on September 18, 1981. The former convent of the Carmelites was founded in honor of St. John of the Cross in 1679, under the reign of Charles II. The work of the building was designed by some friar of the Order and built entirely in brick. During the confiscation of Mendiz√°bal in 1835, the friars were expelled, and since then the convent has remained uninhabited. At present, the building is used to host different cultural events. The convent church has a Latin cross floor plan, with a dome. The facade was built in the year 1700 as it appears in an inscription. Inside the temple, there is a sculpture of the Virgen del Carmen, attributed to the imager Francisco Salzillo. The main altarpiece was moved to Murcia in the 19th century, where it was destroyed during the Spanish Civil War. The convent section was built in 1696 and has painted decoration that imitates bricks. In the crypt, which is open for public visits, the remains of some mummies are preserved. = Hermitage of Our Lady of Bethlehem = The hermitage of Our Lady of Bethlehem was declared a Property of Cultural Interest on March 5, 1976. The hermitage of Our Lady of Bethlehem has a very simple rectangular floor plan, with arches of diaphragm and wooden cover. Its interest, above all, lies in the great pictorial cycle that adorns all its corners with very peculiar popular paintings, made between 1734 and 1735. Everything is painted, altarpieces, curtains, illusory architectures, in a naive and colorful line within the best popular aesthetic. Stylistically these murals are filled with enchanting archaisms and imperfections, but it is perhaps that which gives it a remarkable charm. Here, murals include saints, scenes, decoration, even the allegory of death, sometimes accompanied by exemplary sentences and verses. The front comprises three panels, occupied by paintings of the Visitation, the Holy Family and the Immaculate. Many other painted altarpieces fill the inner space of the hermitage, of which it is worthy to highlight the one of San Antonio and the one of Santa B√°rbara.

The Major Plaza is a landmark, where many important buildings are located. Among them is the current \\"Museum of the N√≠zcalo\\", a mycological museum of Spain and the former Town hall. At the Plaza of the Church there is one of two churches in the city center located, which is the Church of San Jose. It dates from the eighteenth century. Also situated around the Major Plaza are the street mills, from which this locality derives its name. The modern part of Molinicos breaks with the aesthetics of the ancient part, as modern materials were used for construction and buildings are often higher than four stories. This zone begins in the Plaza of Our Lady of Carmen, which is popularly known as \\"The Widening\\" as the streets are parallel.

As a subsidiary of Nemetschek, Graphisoft develops Building Information Modeling software products for architects, interior designers and planners. Graphisoft has subsidiaries in Germany, United States, United Kingdom, Spain, Japan and representative offices in Russia and Singapore. The company's flagship product is ArchiCAD ‚Äî an architectural design software developed since 1984 for Windows and Mac platforms.  History  = Foundation = In 1982, Graphisoft was established by G√°bor Boj√°r. The Hungarian software developer created terrain modeling software on microcomputers while he was head of a mathematical department at the Geophysical Institute in Budapest. The communist history of Hungary was an important factor in the success of Graphisoft. When private companies had been allowed, Boj√°r promptly left his job and launched Graphisoft with a competent team. They were all experts in three-dimensional mathematical modeling, but had no access to the most modern and efficient computers. This limitation led to the development of 3D modeling software that could be used on low cost PCs. Then the team provided such software to architects. Since 1984, Graphisoft has been supported by Apple. Steve Jobs was impressed by Graphisoft‚Äôs capability and the development of the architectural CAD from Boj√°r in the 2D/3D technology. Therefore, he sent them an Apple computer. This made it possible to create ArchiCAD, the first desktop BIM system and Graphisoft's flagship product. Graphisoft's flagship product, ArchiCAD was introduced in 1987 as the Virtual Building concept, later (2003) regarded as building information modeling (BIM), and allowing architects to draw walls, windows, doors, slabs and roofs ‚Äî a common feature now of every BIM-based architectural design software. Subsequent ArchiCAD releases introduced other BIM features such as Teamwork, which enabled more architects to work on the same building in parallel, edit functions in three-dimensional model views, and interoperability add-ons to communicate with other applications using IFC ‚Äî now a de facto standard in data exchange between BIM applications. Graphisoft built a campus north of Budapest, the Gaphisoft Park. The construction of the technology park began in 1998. Today, it includes the company‚Äòs global headquarters and hosts several technology companies such as Microsoft, SAP and Canon. Graphisoft was introduced to the Frankfurt Stock Exchange in 1998 and the Budapest Stock Exchange in 2000, and was purchased by Nemetschek AG (Germany) in 2007. In 2013, Graphisoft signed a contract Nikken Sekki, to create the BIM Competence & Research Center in order to advance BIM in Japan and Southeast Asia. In 2016, Graphisoft partnered with the company Atlas Cloud to provide a cloud-based access to ArchiCAD. In September 2018, the Graphisoft Park expanded by 20,000 square-meters in the cause of its 20th anniversary, lifting the park‚Äôs total area to 75,000sqm. The new buildings are rented to companies under lease. In addition, Graphisoft Park developed an advanced learning center, the Aquincum Institute of Technologie (AIT-Budapest). In April 2019, Graphisoft‚Äôs CEO Viktor V√°rkonyi started to manage the Planning and Design Division at Graphisoft‚Äôs mother company Nemetschek. Huw Roberts was appointed the new CEO of Graphisoft. In June 2019, Graphisoft entered a partnership with Epic Games to launch next-generation real-time rendering solution for its customers. Products =Graphisoft ArchiCAD= ArchiCAD is a complex architectural design tool offering 2D and 3D drafting, visualization and documentation functions for architects and planners to create three- dimensional designs and detailed technical documentation, thus enabling architects to use ArchiCAD from the earliest design phases to the technical detail drawings. As of 2019 ArchiCAD is in its 23rd generation. =Graphisoft BIM Server= Graphisoft's second generation collaboration solution lets more architects work on the same building simultaneously with ArchiCAD by allowing them to access and manage the building information model database over the Internet. Graphisoft BIM Server is shipped with ArchiCAD from version 13. =Graphisoft MEP Modeler= Graphisoft MEP Modeler (Mechanical/Electrical/Plumbing) Modeler is an ArchiCAD extension for architects to incorporate duct work and piping into the architectural design. MEP Modeler allows architects to create, edit or import 3D MEP networks and coordinate them with the Building Information Model, facilitating the BIM workflow between engineers and architects. =Graphisoft EcoDesigner= Graphisoft EcoDesigner helps architects to use virtual building information to evaluate energy performance, thus the sustainability of the building from the very first concept design. EcoDesigner allows architects to analyze their design for energy efficiency, providing feedback on the building's estimated energy performance. =Graphisoft BIMx= BIMx, formerly marketed as Virtual Building Explorer is an interactive BIM model presentation tool, which allows the presentation of entire building models without the need for installing ArchiCAD or other BIM authoring tool. The software combines video game-like navigation with native BIM features, including measurement of real building dimensions.

Unlike traditionally bowed instruments such as violins, the guitar generally has a relatively flat bridge radius and closely positioned strings, making it difficult to bow individual notes on the middle strings.

It is a 60-seat venue and is a fringe theatre in the London Borough of Camden, located above the Three Horseshoes public house in Hampstead. The theatre has a reputation for producing revivals, poetry, music events and cutting-edge new plays in particular. History of the Theatre The theatre began in a disused skittle alley in the basement of the Freemason's Arms, Hampstead, in August 1968. It moved to an open-air site and also to the Haverstock Arms before moving to its present location in October 1971. It was founded to present poets reading their work in an informal theatrical pub setting. The many authors to appear at Pentameters include Dannie Abse, Fleur Adcock, Kingsley Amis, George Barker, Ivor Cutler, Margaret Drabble, William Empson, Ruth Fainlight, Elaine Feinstein, John Heath-Stubbs, Adrian Henri, Michael Hamburger, John Horder, Michael Horovitz, Libby Houston, Black Gallagher, Ted Hughes, James Kirkup, Fran Landesman, Laurie Lee, Christopher Logue, Edward Lucie-Smith, George Macbeth, Roger McGough, Adrian Mitchell, Edna O'Brien, Brian Patten, Peter Porter, Vernon Scannell, Stevie Smith, Stephen Spender, Jon Stallworthy, Mitchell Symons, John Wain, Heathcote Williams and the psychologist R. D. Laing. The theatre has also played host to many performers at the start of their careers, including Robyn Archer, Joanna Dunham, Adrian Edmondson, French and Saunders, Nigel Havers, Celia Imrie, Cheryl Kennedy, Rik Mayall, Nigel Planer, Jenny Seagrove, Pamela Stephenson and Alexei Sayle. Theatrical presentations began in 1969 with performances, plays and readings by John Arden and Margaretta D'Arcy, Rosalinde Fuller, Ronald Hayman, Bernard Kops, David Pinner, Harold Pinter, Clive Swift, Anthony Thwaite, Miles Tredinnick, Michelene Wandor, Henry Woolf, regular weekly appearances by Keith Johnstone's Theatre Machine (the precursor of TheatreSports) and productions including Richard Huggett's The First Night of Pygmalion; John Harding and John Burrows' For Sylvia; William Humble's Do It Yourself; Black Notes, Jon Silkin's play on Ivor Gurney; and the British premieres of Tristan Tzara's Handkerchief of Clouds, and Tennessee Williams' Auto-Da-Fe. Transfers have included Royce Ryton's The Other Side of the Swamp, which transferred to the King's Head and the Phoenix Theatre; Stewart Permutt's first professionally produced play, When I Grow Too Old to Scream, which transferred to the New End Theatre and subsequently for two special performances at the Dominion Theatre; The Sensualist, which transferred to the Arts Theatre; and the American play 70 Scenes of Halloween to the BAC. Recent years In recent years, Pentameters theatre has become primarily known for its productions of classic revivals, many by the touring company Traffic of the Stage, including John Edmunds' sell-out new translation of Moli√®re's The Misanthrope with Finty Williams, One Person with Michael Deacon, the award-winning production of Yeats' plays, and the award-winning new play Steinberg's Day of Atonement. Over many productions, actor and director Harry Meacher built up at Pentameters what was in effect the nucleus of a smallscale classical theatre company, performing both Shakespeare and later literary greats. Meacher's team featured his wife the celebrated screen actor Judi Bowker and often included Georgia Cardy, Bryan Hands, Emily Holden, Adam Lewis, Seamus Newham, Tom Reah, Roger Sansom and Jonson Wilkinson. L√©onie Scott-Matthews was awarded an OBE in the New Years Honours list 2020 for services to British Theatre and the community in Hampstead. The current senior lighting technician and stage manager Oliver Edwards has been a stalwart at the theatre over the past two years.

It mostly deals with cellular services under the brand name \\"SMART\\" and other landline services.  Background  = The BTL monopoly = Prior to Speednet, Belizeans only had one telecommunications company, BTL, which provided adequate services for exorbitant rates. This led to a number of protests in late 2001. Under its chairman Lord Michael Ashcroft, BTL was said to be monopolizing the communications industry in Belize. The government of Belize said it intended to open the industry to competition. = Jeffrey Prosser and Intelco = In 1999, Data Pro International began operations in the Corozal Free Zone, and the following year this was extended to include telecommunications services. BTL challenged the agreement, saying it violated the 15-year exclusive contract given to them through 2002. In response the Government signed a new contract with LGS Services to provide telecommunication services to the government in place of BTL. The war of words and court cases continued through 2001 and 2002, with BTL's majority owner Ashcroft and Intelco's Glenn Godfrey going back and forth over which of the two would be the better service provider and whether the other wanted competition at all. Enter American investor Jeffrey Prosser, who in late 2003 bought out most of BTL in a clear attempt to get rid of Ashcroft. The government must have felt Prosser would be a better ally in their fight to bring better services to Belizeans; if so, they were proven wrong. Prosser began making arrangements for BTL to be absorbed in a company of his own and asked for exclusivity similar to that given to Intelco. As if the mess was not soggy enough, in 2004 it was proven that Godfrey, a known PUP ally and former representative of the party, had received favorable loans from Belize's Social Security Board and Development Finance Corporation, of which he was chairman. At the same time, Intelco never got off the ground (some say it was never meant to) and the Government's relationship with the defaulting Prosser had soured. It was in this state of affairs that Speednet entered the picture.  Speednet steps in  A relieved populace watched as the company gained its licenses, signed an interconnection agreement with BTL, and finally signed on with cellular service SMART in March 2005. Within months Belizeans in all six districts had signed on to SMART (officially advertised as a \\"Speednet product\\"), which offered cellular services at slightly lower rates than BTL. Under political party the peoples united party it was well known to the nations ear that the Brice√±os brother who then had power were stake holders of the company smart. Later to avert attention and ego centrism of the countries financial economy ashcroft was the one to carry the cross. SMART soon became the choice of younger Belizean professionals who felt uncomfortable dealing with the crusty, aristocratic BTL and wanted personable, attractive and efficient service with no headaches. Today, the company operates from downtown Belize City, and has its customer service showroom on the Northern Highway. In addition to cellular services, Speednet offers SMS text messaging services, an international cellular calling plan, a wide variety of cellular accessories, and adequate customer service.
