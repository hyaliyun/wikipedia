Tempelhof Airways USA, (not to be confused with Tempelhof Express) was founded in Fort Lauderdale, FL in 1981 by Knut Kramer, a Berliner living in both Florida and Berlin. In April 1982 it began Air Taxi operations with a Piper Navajo from West Berlin's Tempelhof airport. At that time West Berlin could, due to its status of an occupied city, only have operations by airlines of the United States, France and Great Britain. In January 1985 scheduled flight operations began between Berlin and Paderborn using Nord 262 aircraft. Most of these flights were for the massive Nixdorf Computer offices based there. Operations were later expanded to Dortmund, Luxembourg, Augsburg and Braunschweig. In 1988 the Saab 340 was put into service for the Berlin- Hamburg route. They also operated an ambulance/medivac aircraft for many years, doing patient transport as well as organ transplant. They used a Lear 25 at first then expanded to a Lear 35. This was undertaken for the DeutscheRettungsflugwacht (German Air Rescue) organization in Stuttgart. After the Berlin Wall fell German pilots were allowed to fly to and from Berlin and the operation was absorbed into the parent company. Several of the old TAUSA medivac pilots were hired to remain with the operation.

This system, which made its debut in the 2006 MLB playoffs, is installed in every MLB stadium. The data from the system is often used by broadcasters to show a visual representation of the pitch and whether or not a pitch entered the strike-zone. PITCHf/x is also used to determine the type of pitch thrown, such as a fastball, curve, or slider. MLB uses the data from PITCHf/x in its Zone Evaluation System which is used to grade and provide feedback to umpires. Sabermetric analysts note that umpire accuracy has improved after the technology was introduced to MLB. Usage PITCHf/x is a system using three permanently mounted cameras in the stadium to track the speed and location of a pitched baseball from the pitcher's mound to home plate with an accuracy of better than one mile per hour and one inch. With PITCHf/x, statistics such as the pitcher with the fastest fastball, or the pitcher with the sharpest-breaking curve, etc., can be analyzed. It calculates the \\"movement\\" of pitches caused by the Magnus force. The PITCHf/x data is used in MLB's online Gameday webcast to show the path and speed of each pitch, as well as the location with respect to the strike zone as the pitch crossed the front of home plate. Gameday presents two values from PITCHf/x to characterize the deflection of the pitch trajectory. The BRK quantity represents the amount of bend in the trajectory at its greatest distance from a straight line. A curveball will have a larger value of BRK than a fastball. The PFX quantity represents the deflection of the baseball due to the spin and drag forces from the path it would have taken under the influence of gravity alone. For example, a fastball would have a small value for BRK but a large value for the spin displacement PFX because of the rising action of the fastball caused by backspin. Conversely, a curveball or slider will have a significant break measurement, but lower spin displacement. Major League Baseball Advanced Media, which owns the data used in Gameday, releases the data every day in XML format. Several privately owned websites display this information, often with sorting functions and visual displays. According to University of Illinois professor Alan M. Nathan, the PITCHf/x system allows analysts to \\"record with unprecedented precision such quantities as the pitch speed and the location at home plate. But even more importantly, we have measures of quantities that we never had before. As a result, we now have new and novel ways to study the art of pitching.\\" PITCHf/x data is generally consistent across ballparks, but there have been instances of apparent discrepancies in the data gathered at certain ballparks. (For example, a pitcher's fastball speed might be 1‚Äì2 mph faster at home than on the road.) PITCHf/x uses algorithms to automatically classify every pitch by type, but these algorithms are imprecise. For the 2017 season, PITCHf/x was deprecated and replaced by TrackMan, a component of Major League Baseball's Statcast platform.

Storylines Brody is a former Navy SEAL brought to Llanview by Adriana Cramer to distract Gigi Morasco from Adriana's fianc√© Rex Balsom. A hardened veteran of the war in Iraq, Brody had been \\"stop-lossed\\" several times during his tours of duty. Gigi establishes in 2007 that Brody, the father of her son Shane, had died heroically overseas while she had still been pregnant. Threatened by Gigi's connection to her high school sweetheart Rex, Adriana sends her mother Dorian Lord to get information on the deceased Brody in 2008. Meeting Brody's sister Nadine, Dorian discovers that Brody is in fact alive; disapproving of the match, Brody's mother had told Gigi he had died, and had told Brody that Gigi had moved on to another man. Further, Adriana's suspicions that Gigi had already been pregnant when she had met Brody -- and that Rex is most likely Shane's father -- are confirmed. She is even more discouraged to discover that Brody and Gigi's relationship was platonic, despite Brody's willingness to give her son a name and his hopes of building a family with Gigi. With her wedding to Rex approaching -- and Gigi and Rex getting closer -- Adriana pays the hard-drinking and volatile Brody to come to Llanview. Adriana hopes Brody can distract Gigi from Rex and help keep the secret of Shane's paternity from coming out, which she fears will cement Gigi and Rex forever and doom Adriana's relationship with him. Traumatized by his experiences in the Iraq War and embittered by what he believes was Gigi's abandonment of him, Brody still has feelings for Gigi but is hesitant to disrupt her life. Convinced by Adriana that Gigi and Shane need him, Brody finally makes his presence known to a shocked Gigi and elated Shane at Rex and Adriana's wedding. With Rex married to Adriana, Gigi and Brody keep up the pretense that Brody is Shane's father; Gigi feels as though she has no choice but to allow Brody back into her life, as she is unwilling to disrupt Rex's marriage or crush her son's hopes and dreams of finally knowing his \\"father.\\" Brody hopes to pursue a real relationship with Gigi, but she is soon wrapped up again with Rex, who separates from Adriana after discovering her machinations. Meanwhile, Brody focuses his attentions and affection on Shane, to whom he grows very close, thinking of the boy as \\"his son\\" in every respect. Brody sees in Shane an opportunity for a new start, and takes the initiative to find employment and begin attending Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. When Gigi leaves town to pursue the missing Rex to Texas, a jealous Brody takes charge of Shane and the household. Having grown dependent on Shane's love and validation, Brody fears that if Gigi and Rex are to reunite, he will lose access to the most important person in his life. When local psychic Madame Delphina cryptically warns Brody that Gigi and Rex may be \\"gone for good,\\" Brody panics, fearing that Social Services will put Shane into the foster care system if he is unable to assert paternity. Brody uses Rex's DNA from a toothbrush to fake a paternity test which \\"proves\\" Brody to be Shane's father and therefore, his legal guardian in Gigi's absence. Brody's hopes are dashed, however, when Gigi and Rex return to Llanview together, Rex knowing the truth about Shane's paternity and the couple ready to tell Shane. Despondent, Brody suffers a mental breakdown, trashing Gigi's house and accidentally injuring her friend Marcie McBain. Lapsing into \\"combat mode,\\" Brody outmaneuvers Gigi and Rex by picking up Shane from school and taking him to Llantano Mountain. Once there, a delusional and armed Brody dons his old combat fatigues and begins to tell Shane about his experiences in Iraq. Losing track of reality, Brody suffers vivid hallucinations from his tours of duty, including the image of an Iraqi boy he had accidentally killed during a raid. Brody is cornered by the Llanview Police Department, accompanied by Gigi and Rex; initially, Brody uses Shane as a human shield, but soon declares he could never hurt \\"his son\\" and sends the boy to his mother. Police Commissioner Bo Buchanan, a former Vietnam vet, tries to talk Brody down, but an unstable Brody fires wildly, accidentally shooting Rex. Brody is arrested and taken into custody, where his condition worsens due to his severe case of posttraumatic stress disorder. Now aware of Brody's deep trauma stemming from his war experiences, a recovered Rex decides not to press charges, and a stabilized Brody is admitted to St Ann's sanitarium for treatment. At St. Ann's, Brody befriends Jessica Buchanan, who is recovering from her latest bout of dissociative identity disorder following the death of her husband Nash Brennan. Realizing his conflicting memories of the encounter in which he had shot the Iraqi boy, Brody learns that the boy had not been armed as he had been led to believe; a fellow soldier had put a gun in the child's hand to protect Brody. This realization helps Brody recover and secure his release, and he eventually begins a romantic relationship with Jessica. Brody helps Jessica through a relapse of her illness and the stillborn birth of Nash's baby, and becomes a Llanview Police officer. Jessica's evil biological father Mitch Laurence returns and subjects her to electroshock therapy; she loses all memory beyond her senior year of high school. Believing she is still in love with her high school boyfriend Cristian Vega, Jessica repeatedly rejects Brody. May 21, 2010 a drunk and dejected Brody sleeps with Jessica's sister Natalie; Jessica regains her memory the same night while being seduced by Robert Ford. Brody and Natalie decide to keep their encounter a secret from both Jessica and Natalie's boyfriend John McBain. Natalie and Jessica both discover that they are pregnant; Brody assumes he is the father of Jessica's baby, but she keeps the secret that it may be Ford. Natalie is also fearful that Brody is her baby's father rather than John, and she confesses as much to a shocked Brody. On July 29, 2010 Brody proposes, and Jessica accepts. Brody is later furious to discover he may not be the father of her baby, but he and Jessica reconcile. Paternity tests declare Brody the father of both children, but Natalie never tells him that. She tells him her test says John is the babies father, which in reality it is since the paternity results were changed by accident by Clint's assistant. On Jan. 11, 2011 Jessica gives birth to her baby by c-section. They later name the baby Ryder Asa Lovett. Both of Brody's \\"sons\\" are born on the same day. On Brody/Jessica's and John/Natalie's double wedding the truth about both babies fathers are revealed and Tess comes back. Natalie and Brody grow closer and become a couple. On June 30, 2011 Brody finds out he is not Liam's father. On July 21, 2011, Brody finds Vimal's letter on John's desk and goes to find him at \\"The Sun\\" to warn him to keep his mouth closed. Marty, Victor, Vimal, Jack and Brody are the only ones who know the truth about baby Liam's paternity. On the 23rd September 2011, Brody proposed to Natalie and she accepts. It is also revealed that John is still in love with Natalie but he hasn't told her yet. Brody and Natalie's wedding doesn't go as planned when Natalie finds out that John is Liam's father and Brody has known for months. During the week of November 14, Brody goes off the deep end after losing Natalie and Liam, which causes him to kidnap Liam and hold Natalie and John at gun point. After thinking it over, Brody tearfully gives Liam back to his parents. On December 1, 2011, Brody is last seen having a conversation with Jessica in St. Ann's. The two vow to remain friends and stay in touch. Jessica says goodbye to Brody and tearfully leaves him behind. During the series finale on January 13, 2012, Brody returns to Llanfair and informs Jessica that he has been released from St. Ann's. He also apologizes for the death of Ford and tells her that he has been offered another job in the Navy. She tells him to take care of himself. He tells her that if there is anything that she needs, he will be there for her. Even though things were rough between them, he will always care for her. She says that she really appreciates it, and with that Brody leaves town.

This audio drama was produced by Big Finish Productions. Plot The Doctor and Lucie are visiting Auntie Pat in the 1980s, where she owns a lakeside hotel and is married to a man named Trevor. Two executives from a record company to convince Trevor, a former folk singer, to make a comeback, but Trevor refuses. That night, Lucie follows the executives to the lake and sees them drinking Skarasen milk before being caught. When Lucie returns to the Doctor she insists that they investigate the cellar, and they find a Zygon body-print machine with the real Trevor inside. The Doctor and Lucie reveal to Pat that her husband is a Zygon, but she already knows, and loves him anyway. Lucie returns to the executives, and it is revealed that they are all Zygons in disguise. They need to recover a vital control crystal from Warmaster Hagoth ‚Äì Trevor ‚Äì but he has given it to Pat as a brooch, and now it's fused to the skin of her throat. When the executives kidnap Pat, the Doctor and Trevor follow her to the Zygon ship, with the fake Lucie in tow. On the ship, the Doctor rescues the real Lucie and outs the fake. This audio play was the first Big Finish audio to feature the Zygons, shown here at the Doctor Who Experience. The Zygons rip the brooch from Pat's throat, killing her in the process and allowing them to arm warheads and launch an attack on the Earth. Trevor, distraught over Pat's death and not caring about his own life, allows the Doctor and Lucie to escape and then commands the Skarasen to attack and destroy the ship, stopping the Zygon plot. Lucie is unable to accept that her Auntie Pat is dead, since she knew her in the future. Once Lucie has gone to sleep Trevor returns in his Zygon form. Using the last of his strength he permanently takes the form of Auntie Pat and resolves to live an ordinary life and allow Lucie to believe the real Pat survived.

One of the Commonwealth's original state parks, built by the Civilian Conservation Corps and opening in 1936, it is located along the Staunton River near Scottsburg, Virginia. It is an International Dark Sky Park. Location Construction of the park was begun (at the confluence of the Staunton and Dan Rivers) beginning in 1933; Buggs Island Lake was formed in the early 1950s. These two rivers form the Roanoke River basin, and the section of land starting at the park and continuing downstream beside the Roanoke River was known as the Roanoke River valley. Background The park is named for the Staunton River, which forms part of its boundary. Today the river is also known as the Roanoke River; however, locally it is still called the Staunton River (pronounced \\"Stanton\\"). The Staunton River is said to be named for Captain Henry Staunton; before the American Revolution, Staunton commanded a company of soldiers organized to patrol the river valley from the Blue Ridge Mountains to the mouth of the Dan River. Their duty was to protect Virginian settlers from attacks by Native Americans. This section of the river became known as \\"Captain Staunton's River\\" and, later, the Staunton River. History The first Europeans who settled were small farmers. With the introduction of tobacco as a cash crop, area plantations began to expand. Many plantations were located along the Staunton River above the park. Red Hill (the last home of Patrick Henry) and Roanoke Plantation (home of Captain Adam Clement and his son John Marshall Clemens, father of Samuel Clemens‚ÄîMark Twain) are two of the better-known plantations. The Fork Plantation was located on what is now Staunton River State Park. H. E. Coleman owned the plantation, and in 1839 the ownership was transferred to Richard Logan. The plantation contained all of the land located on the fork; one tract covered more than . At this time, there was also a Fork Mission located near the present town of Scottsburg. With the plantations there was a need for transportation, and the Staunton and Dan Rivers permitted water-borne commerce. A fleet of freight bateaux (flatboats) operated upstream from Brookneal and downstream to Clarksville and Gaston, North Carolina. Samuel Pannilla owned these flatboats, which bypassed the falls through channels walled in with stone masonry (forming a canal). These boats stopped not only stopped at Pannilla's plantation, but at landings up and down the river to take on and deliver freight for other shippers. This system lasted until the Civil War, becoming popular again in 1869 until the advent of the railroads. Charles Bruce of Staunton Hill placed two small steamboats in operation on the Staunton River, but most forms of water travel ended with the coming of the railroads. Matt Haskins was a legendary strong man of the Staunton River bateaux men. Haskins, an African American who lived in Randolph, was known up and down the river. It was said that he could lift a sack of fertilizer with his teeth and pick up a barrel full of liquor in his hands and drink out of the bunghole. After the war, the Fork Plantation fell into ruins. Tenant farmers took over the land of the plantation. The land near the rivers was rich and fertile, and crops grew well; each year, of corn was harvested. Tobacco was the main crop, and large quantities were grown. One landlord usually had around 50 tenant farmers and their families living in what is today the park. In 1899, there was a Christian social colony from Wisconsin at the fork. The colony was an experimental Utopian commune. On August 8, 1899 J. C. Zimmerman purchased a tract of land about two miles (3 km) above the confluence of the Dan and Staunton Rivers. The parcel covered . Zimmerman headed the group of nine or ten families who established the colony. Buildings were arranged in a semicircle, with a communal kitchen and dining room in the center. However, the people knew little of the area's farming practices; the colony began to fail, and the group soon left. In 1933, the Commission of Conservation and Development of the Commonwealth of Virginia bought of land from J. W. Johnson, his wife Mary C. Johnson, J. E. Johnson and his wife Elizabeth Johnson. Other land for the park was also purchased. From 1933 to 1935, a Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) company was established at \\"the fork\\". Most of the buildings and facilities of the park were built by the CCC. In 1936, Staunton River State Park was opened to the public as one of the original six state parks. Covering , it provided recreation for the people of south-central Virginia. In 1952, with the completion of the John H. Kerr Dam and the formation of Buggs Island Lake, part of the park was flooded. The park offers many forms of recreation: a pool, tennis courts, a volleyball court, concession stand, picnic areas, children's playground, boat-launching facility, campground, cabins and nature trails. Located in a rural area, much of the original beauty of \\"Captain Staunton's River\\" still exists.

The national historic district encompasses 14 contributing buildings, 5 contributing sites, and 5 contributing structures.

The Sundarbans is home to over 100 Bengal tigers, one of the largest single populations of tigers in one area. Before modern times, Sundarbans were said to \\"regularly kill fifty or sixty people a year\\". These tigers are a little smaller and slimmer than those elsewhere in India but remain extremely powerful and are infamous for destroying small wooden boats. They are not the only tigers who live close to humans; in Bandhavgarh, villages encircle the tiger reserves, and yet attacks on people are rare. Although attacks were stalled temporarily in 2004 with new precautions, they have been on the rise. This is particularly due to the devastation on the Bangladeshi side of the swamp caused by Cyclone Sidr which has deprived tigers of traditional food sources (due to the natural upheaval) and has pushed them over towards the more populated Indian side of the swamp. A Bengal tiger Precautions The locals and government officials take certain precautions to prevent attacks. Local fishermen will say prayers and perform rituals to the forest goddess, Bonbibi, before setting out on expeditions. Invocations to the tiger god Dakshin Rai are also considered a necessity by the local populace for safe passage throughout the Sundarbans area. Fishermen and bushmen originally created masks made to look like faces to wear on the back of their heads because tigers always attack from behind. This worked for a short time, but the tigers quickly realized it was a hoax, and the attacks reportedly continued. One local honey gatherer, Surendra Jana, 57, expressed that the tigers seem to have caught on to the mask trick, \\"Before we could understand the way they attacked. We don't feel safe any more, knowing our brothers have been attacked in spite of the tricks we use.\\" Government officials wear stiff pads that rise up the back of the neck, similar to the pads of an American football player. This is to prevent the tigers from biting into the spine, which is their favored attack method. Causes of the attacks No one is exactly sure why the tigers of the Sundarbans are so aggressive towards humans, but scientists, biologists, and others have speculated about a number of reasons. These include: * Since the Sundarbans is located in a coastal area, the water is relatively salty. In all other habitats, tigers drink fresh water. It is rumored that the saltiness of the water in this area has put them in a state of constant discomfort, leading them to be extremely aggressive. Freshwater lakes have been artificially made but to no avail. * The high tides in the area destroy the tiger's urine and scat which serve as territorial markers. Thus, the only way for a tiger to defend its territory is to physically dominate everything that enters. * Another possibility is that these tigers have grown used to human flesh due to the weather. Cyclones in this part of India and Bangladesh kill thousands, and the bodies drift out in to the swampy waters, where tigers scavenge them. * Another possibility is that the tigers find hunting animals difficult due to the continuous high and low tides making the area marsh-like and slippery. Humans travel through the Sundarbans on boats gathering honey and fishing, making for easy prey. It is also believed that when a person stoops to work, the tiger mistakes them for a typical prey animal, and has, over time, acquired a 'taste' for the human flesh. * It has also been hypothesized that the tigers in this area, due to their secluded habitat, avoided the brunt of the hunting sprees that occurred over the course of the 20th century. Tigers inhabiting the rest of Asia developed a fear of humans after these events, but tigers in the Sundarbans would never have had reason to stop seeing humans as prey. About 5,000 people frequent the swamps and waterways of the Sundarbans. Fishing boats traverse the area and many stop to collect firewood, honey and other items. In the dark forest, tigers find it easy to stalk and attack men absorbed in their work. Even fishermen in small boats have been attacked due to tigers' strong swimming abilities. Responses to the attacks Local villagers, who fear tiger attacks and resent the animal for killing their livestock, sometimes engage in revenge killings. On one occasion, a tiger had attacked and wounded the people in a village in south-west Bangladesh (near the Sundarbans) and frequently preyed upon their livestock. This roused the wrath of the villagers, and the feline became a target for their retribution. Poachers are also responsible for killing tigers in the reserve in an effort to sell them on the black market. The human death rate has dropped significantly due to better management techniques and fewer people are killed each year. Even at the rate of fifty or sixty kills per year, humans would provide only about three percent of the yearly food requirements for the tiger population of the Sundarbans. Thus, humans are only a supplement to the tiger's diet; they do not provide a primary food source. This does not mean that the notoriety associated with this area is unfounded. Even if only 3% of a tiger's diet is human meat, that still amounts to the tiger killing and eating about one person per year, given the amount of food a tiger typically eats. Villagers in the area have agreed to occasionally release livestock into the forest in order to provide an alternative food source for the tigers and discourage them from entering the villages. The government has agreed to subsidize the project to encourage village participation.

They are shining black, with bright red marks on the elytra, one triangular mark at the base, one square mark in the middle and a stripe at the apex. These colors serves as a warning of their unpleasant taste. The hind wings are brownish, smoky and translucent.

This species is very similar to Cercopis sanguinolenta, but its red markings are larger and the rear stripe is U-shaped. Other rather similar species are Cercopis intermedia and Haematoloma dorsata. Biology Cercopis vulnerata in copula Adults can be found from April to August.British Bugs They are polyphagous, mainly sucking vegetable juices of grasses, but also of other plants (Arrhenatherum elatius, Dactylis glomerata, Urtica dioica, Filipendula ulmaria, Aegopodium podagraria, etc.), They can easily fly and are also equipped with very effective saltatory back legs, allowing jumps of up to 70 centimeters. They can extend their hindlegs in under a millisecond to execute a jump, implying elastic storage of energy for sudden release. When they mate Cercopis male and female stay side by side with an angle of less than 45¬∞. The female lays eggs at the end of summer in plants and trees that overwinter. Larvae live underground on the roots of various plants, inside a typical foam nest, that protects them from dehydration and against enemies. The nymph sucks vegetable juices out of the roots of the host plants. The nymph comes up in spring.

Looff as a gift for Looff's daughter Emma Vogel and her husband Louis Vogel, who owned Natatorium Park in Spokane.Spokane's Natatorium Park - The 1909 Looff Carrousel It remained at Natatorium Park until 1968 when the park closed. The carousel was then relocated to its present location at Riverfront Park in 1975 where it continues to operate.Rivefront Park - Attractions - Looff CarrouselNational Carousel Association - Census Entry It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on September 19, 1977. The carousel still contains its original 1900 Ruth & Sohn band organ, which plays 87 key B.A.B. rolls, although due to deteriorating player rolls, a digitized recording is played during the carousel's operation. The organ was manufactured in Waldkirch, Germany and imported by Looff around 1900. The carousel contains 54 horses, one giraffe, one tiger, one goat and two chariots, all hand carved by Looff himself. It also has a ring dispenser that allows the outside riders to grab a ring during each pass and then toss the ring at a clown with a hole for his mouth. If the rider is successful in capturing the brass ring, they can turn it in to win a free ride on the carousel.The Spokane Antique Carrousel Society - Information left Since 1975, the carousel has been housed on the south bank of the Spokane River in Riverfront Park. The park was constructed for the 1974 World's Fair, and certain structures remained in the park after the fair closed. The building that hosted a german beer garden for the fair became the new home of the carousel in the summer of 1975. As a part of a bond passed in 2014 to revitalize Riverfront Park, a new building was designed to house the carousel. The new building was designed with more space to queue and host events, and large windows to improve views of the Spokane River from the inside and views of the carousel from the outside. The new space opened in 2018. The carousel is currently closed due to the COVID-19 Pandemic.

Several variations are recognized.  Description  The adult is a fairly slender beetle, 10‚Äì15 mm long, with straight antennae which are long enough to reach the back of the pronotum (which covers the thorax). The head and thorax are black, the elytra brown and strongly ribbed. The pronotum is clearly dimpled all over. The whole body is covered with greyish-brown hairs. The legs are a paler brown than the elytra. Like other click beetles, the joint between thorax and abdomen forms a flexible hinge, and there is a central knob at the back of the thorax. The species is sexually dimorphic; males are smaller than females, and the side of the male's pronotum is less wavy than the female's. Distribution This click beetle is found throughout the British Isles. It is widespread across Europe and Asia. It is predominantly a lowland species, being entirely absent above 600 m elevation, and becoming steadily scarcer from sea level up to 500 m. Ecology Athous haemorrhoidalis in a forest clearing If disturbed the adult can flick itself high (up to 245 mm) into the air, with a takeoff speed of up to 2.27 m/s, making a loud clicking noise. It can also use this ability to right itself if it falls onto its back. The adults live on flowers, eating pollen. In Europe they are most active in July (like a similar species, Athous vittatus), unlike several other click beetles which are active mainly in the spring months. In broad-leaved forest, on sallow leaf The species is found mainly in forests, both broad-leaved (oak and beech) and coniferous (Scots pine). They are also found in wetland habitats such as fens and peatlands. Fossils of the species have been found in Britain from the Holocene period immediately after the last ice age, from acid bog peat, a much wetter habitat than the beetle's usual habitats today. Adults pollinate the frog orchid, Coeloglossum viride. The beetles are eaten mainly by tits; they are an important prey species for the collared flycatcher, Ficedula albicollis. The larvae of A. haemorrhoidalis are damaging pests of agriculture. In an agricultural setting, the species is found in cereals, orchards, and potato crops. The larvae have a mixed diet, preying on the winter moth, Operophtera brumata, and eating the roots of plants, mostly grasses in the family Poaceae.

The weapon deposits were intended for either sacrifice or burial and forms part of other Iron Age votive offerings from the period of bog deposits in Scandinavia. Almost all Scandinavian Iron Age bog deposits have been found in Denmark and southern Sweden, including Gotland. Illerup deposit The archaeology of a former lake at the Jutland site of Illerup √Ödal is the best evidence for what are taken to be the sacrifice and destruction of the weapons and equipment captured from enemy soldiers (at Illerup, soldiers rather than tribesmen because a certain uniformity of equipment suggests professional organisation). The anoxic conditions of the mud or peat at the bottom of the lakes or bogs preserved many of such sacrificed artifacts in good, or excellent condition. Among the offerings at Illerup are also items belonging to the personal equipment of members of the defeated army. Combs made from reindeer and moose bones together with the finds of Roman coins could indicate that the army originated from northern Scandinavia and was on its way home from plunder or auxiliary service in the Roman Empire when it met its fate at Illerup. Bogs are known to preserve bog bodies and bog butter but no human bodies are known to accompany the weapon sacrifices. The main Illerup deposition, besides weapons, includes gold, silver, spear shafts, shield boards, ropes, cords, leather, textiles tools, wooden vessels, spoons, beads, four horses and a cow. Dendrochronology of the shield boards shows that the deposition was soon after 205 AD, yet the last coin was minted in 187/8 AD. The shield bosses are taken, in the book,The key assumption of how representative losses on the battlefield would be of the make up of an army is not properly discussed. to represent three levels of hierarchy in the small army. The ordinary soldiers were represented by 350 iron bosses. The next level up had 30 bronze bosses and six bronze or iron bosses with gilded pressed foil. Above these, there were 5‚Äì6 silver shield bosses. Some Illerup objects have runes similar to those on the Vimose inscriptions. Other sites A good number of deposit sites were in use for many centuries, with remains from several different sacrificial events, and they often includes many other types of offerings, such as animals, humans, boats, jewellery and food. The weapon sacrifices from the Roman Iron Age times usually dates from the period 200‚Äì500 AD, but earlier ones from the pre-Roman Iron Age are also known, such as the Hjortspring boat offering form around 350 BC, where more than 50 shields, 11 single-edged swords and 169 spearheads accompanied the boat. The weapons were often burnt, broken or bent before deposition. The surviving boats were sunk in the lakes though other boats are known simply from clumps of burnt rivets. The Illerup deposit is known to have had at least three sacrificial events in the period around 200-500 AD. The bogs and lakes used appear to be surrounded by cultivated fields. Roman Iron Age weapon deposits in Scandinavia allow for some changes in Germanic warfare to be monitored, e.g. the change from single edged swords at Hjortspring to double edged swords at Illerup. From grave finds of arrow heads, bows were significant war weapons in the Germanic area from about 200 AD. South of Denmark these are typically leaf shaped. In Denmark they are thinner and designed to penetrate the rings of mail armour. This change of weaponry is assumed to account for the Illerup shields having a layer of gut stretched over the surface. Besides keeping the shields dry, experiments show the shields much more resistant to splitting and penetration by arrows.See Jes Martens: \\"Weapons, armament and society\\", pp. 147‚Äì175 in The Iron Age on Zealand. The rarest find from these sacrifices is a complete coat of mail armor. Reconstruction shows it to have had 20‚Äì23,000 rings and weighed just under 10 kg. Perhaps even more interesting are the scabbards. A number have been recovered. Two of the more decorative from Nydam, one from the third century and one from the fifth had fur lining on the inside. We can reasonably speculate that this fur was oily and designed to keep the blade absolutely free from rust. The further speculation is that a pristine appearance of the blade would only have been so highly valued for pattern-welded blades. Classic sites includes Illerup √Ödal and Kragehul.

The River Irwell runs through the valley, along with the River Croal. Course of the Irwell Geology A tributary of the Irwell flowing over the New Red Sandstone at Clifton Shallow seas covered most of south-east Lancashire in the Upper Carboniferous period when deposits of mud and sand were laid down. These later became beds of shales and sandstones alternating with layers of gritstone. There are also beds of New Red Sandstone and Manchester Marls.Bracegirdle pp 15,16 The glaciers of the Pleistocene epoch further shaped the landscape and then retreated, leaving behind deposits of sand, pebbles and boulder clay that formed the fluvioglacial ridges of the Irwell Valley. Ashclough, a 5.8 hectare (14.3 acre) site which comprises the steep banks of the river between Prestolee and Little Lever, has been designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) because of its geological interest, primarily because it is the best site in the area displaying Ashcough Marine Band and its associated strata. Ashclough is a site of national importance for interpreting the coal measure paleogeography of Great Britain. Industrial history Ladyshore Colliery During the Industrial Revolution factories, mills and terraced hovels grew up along the river banks and the region became filled with cotton mills, coal mines, print works, bleach works, dye works, chemical works, paper works, in fact almost every kind of industry.Bracegirdle pp.19 Wet Earth Colliery was located in the valley at Clifton, along with a number of bleach and dye works including Lever Bank Bleach Works. A number of canals were built to transport goods through the valley, the largest of which is the Manchester Ship Canal. Although many of the smaller canals were abandoned with the coming of the railways, isolated sections of the Manchester Bolton & Bury Canal still remain, and there are plans to restore it for leisure purposes. The waste from the industries along the Irwell polluted the river so heavily that by the 1850 it was virtually devoid of wildlife, however, since the late 19th century many attempts have made to improve the quality of the water. In 1891 the Mersey and Irwell Joint Committee was formed. This body ordered local authorities to provide sewage treatment facilities, and industrial concerns were told to use the best practical means of preventing pollution. In 1939 this body was superseded by the Lancashire Rivers Board, but wartime conditions brought about further deterioration of the river. In 1951 the Rivers (Prevention of Pollution) Act was passed and this board disappeared to be replaced by the Mersey River Board, which was replaced in turn by the Mersey and Weaver River Authority in 1965. In 1974 all the river authorities were merged into the Regional Water Authorities.Bracegirdle pp. 153‚Äì155 Since then there has been a gradual improvement in water quality, and today wildlife is returning to the Irwell. Local wildlife Some industrial waste products, such as spoil from mining, or alkaloids from other industrial processes were disposed of locally. Caustic waste from the Leblanc process was dumped on at least two sites - Nob End, to the south of Bolton and Lower Hinds in Bury. The waste on both sites has since weathered-down to calcium carbonate and has provided an ideal environment for a number of nationally rare calcicolous plants, unique in what is predominately an area of acidic soil. These plants, along with non- indigenous garden escapees such as Giant Hogweed and Himalayan Balsam, have added much variety to the flora of the valley. Nob End was designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest in 1988 and a Local Nature Reserve in 2000. The M60 passes through the valley and the bridge at junction 16 (A666) in Clifton is used as a summer roost for over 100 Daubenton's bats.  Irwell Sculpture Trail  The Irwell Sculpture Trail is one of the largest public art initiatives and the longest sculpture trail in the UK. The trail consists of a scenically varied, walking route based on the well-established Irwell Valley Trail stretching from Salford Quays to the moors above Bacup. Since 1987 over 30 pieces of public art have been commissioned from regional, national and international artists.

Angus & Robertson Publishers, London, UK Distribution and habitat P. meandrina occurs in the Indian and Pacific Oceans and is found across a range of habitats that include exposed reefs, protected lagoons and lower reef slopes. Biology Spawning P. meandrina. P. meandrina is a hermaphrodite and each polyp contains four sets of male and four sets of female gonads. The larvae develop inside the body of the polyp and are not expelled into the water until they are mature. They remain free swimming for a number of weeks before settling and starting to build a hard matrix. The polyps can also reproduce asexually by fragmentation.Green, E. and Shirley, F. (1999) The Global Trade in Corals. World Conservation Press, Cambridge, UK The polyps feed by capturing tiny prey with their tentacles. They also contain zooxanthellae, microscopic algae, which are able to photosynthesise. These symbionts produce energy-rich compounds which the polyps metabolise while the rigid structure of the shallow water coral provides a stable, well-lit, protective environment for the algae to flourish.

Hubbs, University of Michigan. Carl Leavitt Hubbs (October 19, 1894 ‚Äì June 30, 1979) was an American ichthyologist. Biography Youth He was born in Williams, Arizona. He was the son of Charles Leavitt and Elizabeth (n√©e Goss) Hubbs. His father had a wide variety of jobs (farmer, iron mine owner, newspaper owner). The family moved several times before settling in San Diego where he got his first taste of natural history.Cf. Norris (1974) : 586. After his parents divorced in 1907, he lived with his mother, who opened a private school in Redondo Beach, California. His maternal grandmother Jane Goble Goss, one of the first female doctors, showed Hubbs how to harvest shellfish and other sea creatures. One of his teachers, impressed by Hubbs's abilities in science, recommended that he study chemistry at the University of Berkeley. The family moved once more to Los Angeles. In Los Angeles, George Bliss Culver, one of the many volunteers of David Starr Jordan, encouraged Hubbs to abandon his study of birdsWith a guide, North American Bird Eggs, Chester Albert Reed (1876-1912). Cf Norris (1974) : 587. and instead to study fish, particularly those fish that inhabited the rivers of Los Angeles, which at that time had not been well researched. Hubbs completed his studies at Stanford University, following particularly the ichthyologist Charles Henry Gilbert, a disciple of Jordan. Gilbert became Hubbs's mentor and gave him the responsibility of caring for a collection of fish from Stanford. During this same period, Hubbs met John Otterbein Snyder, another disciple of Jordan. Hubbs obtained his BA in 1916 and his Masters in 1917. Curator From 1917 until 1920 Hubbs served as the assistant curator of fish, amphibians, and reptiles at the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago. He married Laura Cornelia Clark on June 15, 1918, with whom he would have three children. His wife, who had also studied at Stanford, having received her BA in 1915 and her Masters in 1916, taught math. In 1920, he took the position of curator of fish at the Museum of Zoology at the University of Michigan, a position he held for 24 years. In 1927, while working at the University of Michigan, he received his Ph.D., writing his dissertation on The Consequences of Structural Modifications of the Developmental Rate in Fishes Considered in Reference to Certain Problems of Evolution. Hubbs himself along with members of team and students contributed to the enrichment of the museum's collection. In 1929, he participated in an academic trip to Java where he collected five tons of specimens. Hubbs began to study hybridization among different species of fish. California In addition to his position as conservator, Hubbs was the first director of the Institute for Fisheries Research in the Department of Conservation of Michigan (1930‚Äì1935). In this role, he conducted research on the diverse inventory of regional fauna, mortality, water pollution, growth and predation. During his stay at the University of Michigan, Hubbs issued more than 300 publications, almost entirely devoted to fish. His studies were not confined to the United States because he also studied a large collection of fish from Japan. From 1944 to 1969, Hubbs taught biology at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California San Diego in La Jolla where he replaced Francis Bertody Sumner. From 1969 to 1979 he served as professor emeritus. He accepted the post for the new research opportunities it opened. Still, the position offered a lower salary and the rules prevented him from hiring his wife.Many institutions have a rule prohibiting the hiring of two members of the same family. Cf Shor et al. (1987) : 226. The restrictions of World War II forced the Scripps Institution to rent his research boat to the army, significantly restricting his research opportunities. During the summer of 1946, Errol Flynn, son of a marine biologist, offered Hubbs to accompany him during a cruise aboard his yacht, the Zaca. The results weren't great but Hubbs discovered high levels of endemism of species of Guadeloupe. In the years following the war, Hubbs began doing research in the field of commercial and recreational fishing. He observed changes in population patterns depending on the fluctuation in temperatures in the Pacific Ocean. He began studies of ancient climates through such tools as dating mollusk shells. His research led to the founding of a laboratory in 1957 to provide dating for archaeological and geological samples. He bequeathed his collection to San Diego's Archaeological Museum of Man in 1973. Family His wife was Laura Cornelia Clark Hubbs, they met on a field trip of the Stanford Natural History Club, and he had three children who survived to adulthood, Frances (born in 1919), Clark born in 1921 and Earl born in 1922. Frances married the ichthyologist Robert Rush Miller, Clark became a noted ichthyologist in his own right and Earl became a headteacher. Death He died June 30, 1979, in La Jolla, California. Hubbs SeaWorld Research Institute was named after him. Scientific Research Hubbs issued 712 publications. At first, he studied the fish of the Great Lakes but after moving to La Jolla, he expanded his research to include marine mammals. He also served as an active adviser, both through articles for popular magazines, the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, and radio broadcasts. He educated the public from 1920 to 1930 the need to protect the habitats of marine mammals. For his environmental protection work he received a gold medal of the San Diego Natural History Society.Cf. Norris (1974) : 592. Hubbs was a member of several of learned societies, participating in the American Society of Ichthyologists and Herpetologists, the Wildlife Society of San Diego Natural History Society, and the National Academy of Sciences of the Linnean Society of London.Cf. Sterling et al. (1997) : 385. He received numerous awards from the Academy of Natural Sciences and the California Academy of Sciences. He was awarded the 1964 Leidy Award from the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia.

EIF funds more than 300 charitable organizations annually, both in the Los Angeles area and throughout the United States. To date, EIF has pledged more than $1 billion for its philanthropic initiatives.  History  The Entertainment Industry Foundation (formerly Permanent Charities Committee founded by M. C. Levee) was established in 1942 by Samuel Goldwyn, with friends Humphrey Bogart, James Cagney, and the Warner brothers. Their vision was to unify Hollywood's philanthropy efforts in order to maximize the charitable dollars raised annually, and guarantee that worthy charities receive these contributions. They recognized that banding together would heighten the studios‚Äô impact on World War II relief efforts. A ‚ÄúUnited Appeal‚Äù payroll deduction ‚Äì a first for any U.S. industry ‚Äì launched, with $1 million raised. Celebrity involvement in President Roosevelt's awareness campaign to eradicate childhood polio, as well as fundraising that was a springboard for the establishment of the L.A. paramedic program, are hallmarks of the Foundation's early work. EIF focused on some of the most pressing needs of its time: from the first grants directed to wartime agencies like the United Service Organizations and American Red Cross, to providing funding and creating awareness to help eradicate childhood polio.  EIF initiatives  The Entertainment Industry Foundation has initiatives to address many health concerns such as cancer, diabetes, and HIV/AIDS, as well as raise awareness about important social and educational issues ‚Äì especially those affecting children. It has developed programs that support charities in the Hunger and Nutrition spaces as well as quick response funding for Disaster Relief worldwide. Additionally, EIF functions as an umbrella organization and fiscal sponsor for many artists, athletes, and influencers who seek to use their platforms. The Kevin Love Fund, Charlize Theron Africa Outreach Project, and Panic! At The Disco Highest Hopes Foundation are among the organizations launched under EIF's platform.  Stand Up To Cancer  Stand Up To Cancer (SU2C), a division of EIF and its largest initiative, was established in 2008 by film and media leaders who utilize the industry's resources to engage the public in supporting a new, collaborative model of cancer research, and to increase awareness about cancer prevention as well as progress being made in the fight against the disease. thumb Disaster Relief EIF's ability to develop ‚Äúroadblock‚Äù telecasts in support of disaster relief efforts is an integral part of its role within the entertainment industry. Efforts like Hope for Haiti Now, Somos una Voz, One Love Manchester, and EIF's Fire Relief Fund have provided catalytic funding for organizations and communities around the world when impacted by tragedy. Music for Relief (MFR), the Entertainment Industry Foundation's official crisis relief program, is dedicated to providing aid to survivors and communities affected by natural disasters to help them recover and rebuild. Founded by the band Linkin Park in response to the 2004 tsunami in the Indian Ocean, the program aims to support immediate and long-term disaster relief with a primary goal of making a powerful and sustainable impact in highly affected areas. thumb Education Thinkitup is an initiative of the EIF to bring attention to improving education in the U.S. It kicked off in 2015 with a live televised fundraising event. The program featured stories of teachers and students working together as well as live musical performances, comedic sketches and more. Together with donorschoose.org, Thinkitup allows students and teachers to crowdfund projects they want to work on, helping prepare students for post-school life. EIF collaborated with the XQ Institute on its Super School Project to help communities reshape high school so it better prepares students for success. Launched in September 2017, ‚ÄúEIF Presents: XQ Super School Live,‚Äù a roadblock telecast, was held on Sept. 8, 2017, with live musical, comedy, and documentary segments that brought to life the past, present and future of the American high school system.

An extrasolar planet (designated 41 Lyncis b or HD 81688 b, later named Arkas) is thought to be orbiting the star. Properties It is estimated using parallax measurements to be approximately from the Sun. The spectrum of this star matches a stellar classification of K0 III, with the luminosity class of III suggesting it is a giant star. This star has about double the mass of the Sun, although a re-evaluation of evolutionary tracks published in 2011 gives a lower estimate of solar masses. It has expanded to 11 times the Sun's radius and is radiating 55 times as much as the Sun from its outer atmosphere at an effective temperature of 4,789 K. This temperature gives it the orange-hued glow of a K-type star. This star is following an orbit through the Milky Way with an eccentricity of 0.21. This will take it as close to the Galactic Center as and as far as . The inclination of this orbit will carry it as much as away from the galactic plane. For this reason, it is uncertain whether this star is a member of the thin disk population. 41 Lyncis is listed in the Washington Double Star Catalog as having two visual companions, the 8th magnitude F-type subgiant HD 81704 away, and an 11th magnitude star away. Both are background objects, more distant than 41 Lyncis itself, but the two share a common proper motion and are at the same distance as each other. Nomenclature 41 Lyncis is the Flamsteed designation. Typically, 'Lyncis' is the genitive for a star found in the constellation of Lynx. However, when the constellation boundaries were officially established by the International Astronomical Union in 1930, this star was located within Ursa Major. HD 81688 is the entry in the Henry Draper Catalogue. Following its discovery the planet was designated 41 Lyncis b or alternatively HD 81688 b. In July 2014 the IAU launched a process for giving proper names to certain exoplanets and their host stars.NameExoWorlds: An IAU Worldwide Contest to Name Exoplanets and their Host Stars.

The legal process ran for almost nine years, took up 232 sitting days and generated 16,642 pages of transcripts. In November 2009, the NSW Supreme Court Justice Robert Austin comprehensively dismissed ASIC's case against the Rich and Silbermann, saying the corporate regulator had failed to prove any aspect of its pleaded case against either defendant. Facts One.Tel was a service provider of GSM mobile and long-distance calls formed by Rich (with James Packer as a shareholder) in Australia in 1995. One.Tel expanded its operations overseas in 1998 and in 1999, Packer's Publishing and Broadcasting and News Corporation made a $600 million investment in the business as it committed to building Australia's fourth mobile network. One.Tel grew to become the fourth largest Australian Telco with 3 million subscribers, 3000 employees, operations in 7 countries and a $1 billion annual turnover with the market cap at peak standing at $5.4 billion. Trial In May 2001, Packer and Murdoch's PBL and News Corporation withdrew their earlier stated support for an underwritten rights issue, the Telco then collapsed. They claimed One.Tel needed $300 million to survive and instructed Ernst and Young to write a report in 36 hours to test this claim. However, former One.Tel auditor and Ernst and Young chairman Brian Long who was responsible for this report, had parts of his evidence rejected by Justice Robert Austin. A file note belonging to Brian Long, \\"Extract from Underwriting\\", taken during meetings with the Packers was disclosed during cross examination. Mr Long had a relationship with the Packer family over many years. 5 Witnesses paragraph 845, page 366 and paragraph 850, page 365. It was found that the Rights issue and the continued assistance of the major shareholders would have been enough to support One.Tel until November 2001, by which time the company's businesses would have been generating a healthy group cash flow. The withdrawal of the support may have ensured the company's downfall. One.Tel ceased operation in Australia in June 2001 and in the same month, ASIC obtained criminal warrants and raids the One.Tel executive directors' houses. Shortly after, ASIC obtained a freezing order over all Jodee Rich's assets and selected family assets, they did not raid the houses, freeze the assets or seize documents of Packer, Murdoch, Yates or any other PBL director. The Australian operations of the company, which were in Liquidation with 1 million One.Tel subscribers acquired for over $200 million, was sold to Optus and Telstra for a few million dollars in 2001. ASIC were unable to find minutes of the Commissioners (3 December 2001) meeting where the decision was made to launch proceedings against the defendants. Jan Redfern, ASIC's Executive Director of Enforcement stated there was no formal record of the meeting. Jan Redfern, refused to provide important company documents. However, the Supreme Court ordered ASIC to provide adequate discovery. hearing transcript, line 28-31-page 9,894 Packer flew a team around the world gathering evidence to assist ASIC with their case During this time, there were settlement discussions in which ASIC offered a compromise 20-year banning order against the directors. ;ASIC's claim ASIC alleged that Rich and Silbermann failed to exercise due care and diligence by failing to keep the board of directors of One.Tel sufficiently informed of material information about the true financial condition, performance and prospects of One.Tel, especially in the period leading up to the cancellation of a proposed rights issue in May 2001. ASIC sought $92m in damages and a lifetime banning order against the former One.Tel directors. ;Trial Counsel * Robert MacFarlan QC- ASIC Barrister *Philip Durack, SC * David L Williams, SC J Rich Barrister * Mark J Steele- J Rich Barrister ;Plaintiffs and Defendants * David Knott- ASIC Chairman * Joanne Rees- ASIC Lawyer *Jan Redfern- Executive Director Enforcement * Jodee Rich * Mark Silbermann ;ASIC Witnesses *James Packer *Lachlan Murdoch *Guy Jalland *Peter Yates *Brian Long *Christopher Weston *Paul Carter PwC expert *Dick Warburton - Woolworths Chairman *Sam Randall - Jnr Treasury Manager *Jan Redfern - Director Enforcement *Joanne Rees *Geoff Kleemann PBL CFO *Chris Werner One.Tel UK CFO *Drew Boaden - One.Tel UK CFO *Paul Carter - PwC partner, Expert witness *Peter Yates - PBL Director ;The Stats * 67 interlocutory judgments. * 16,642 pages of hearing transcript * 232 hearing days Including 9 days in London * 3000 page judgment * 104 affidavits *243 written submission documents 1 Introduction paragraph 23, page 11 & 12. ;ASIC's $2m Expert Report PricewaterhouseCoopers Expert Paul Carter, provided evidence that Justice Robert Austin considered to be flawed. The report consisted of 402 paragraphs detailing One.Tel's financial situation before its collapse, analysing thousands of documents and emails. ;CGU CGU, the provider of the companies Director and Officers liability insurance, denied cover. As a result, John Greaves, One.Tel chairman and Brad Keeling, the joint managing Director, were unable to fund their defense. ;Packer's evidence In Packer's evidence, 1,951 questions were delivered in its cross-examination to which Mr Packer Jnr replied \\"I can‚Äôt recall\\". Packer claimed that he couldn't recall questions he had with his father, Kerry Packer about One.Tel or the details about several meetings. Justice Robert Austin decided that his approach to the cross examination was misconceived and was reflected in occasionally aggressive answers. Paragraph 754 & paragraph 755, page 327. ;Murdoch's evidence Similarly, Murdoch responded with \\"I can‚Äôt recall\\" in 881 questions, a higher daily rate than Mr Packer Jnr. It was decided by Justice Robert Austin that there was a significant problem with the lack of recollection in his evidence which inevitably undermined its credibility. 5 Witnesses paragraph 796. ;Brian Long's evidence Brian Long had parts of his evidence rejected by Justice Robert Austin. A file note belonging to Brian Long \\"Extract from Underwriting\\" taken during meetings with the Packers was disclosed during cross examination. Mr Long had a relationship with the Packer family over many years. ;Kleemann's evidence Kleemann's evidence was seen to be an attempt to minimize a role that was in reality, quite significant. It was therefore decided that Mr Kleemann's evidence be treated with caution. 5 Witnesses paragraph 833, page 361. ;Boaden's evidence Boaden's evidence was judged as unreliable due in part to his involvement as a paid consultant for the Packer interest Paragraph 2084, page 848, & paragraph 2089, page 851. ;Weston's evidence Weston's evidence was not accepted due to its inconsistency with the defendants evidence. Also Weston had a professed lack of recollection. Paragraph 2074, page 845. ;Werner's evidence Similarly, Werner's evidence was described as unsatisfactory and implausible and vague. Paragraph 2073, page 844. Judgment The trial concluded on 18 November 2009 in which Justice Robert Austin declared that ASIC had \\"failed in every aspect of their case\\", \\"failed to call key witnesses\\" and \\"exaggerated the effect of evidence or misleadingly took passages of evidence out of context\\". Paragraph 886, page 382, paragraph 56, page 28 and paragraph 1511, page 621. It was also decided that ASIC's summary of Mr Rich's evidence in the witness box was inaccurate. Paragraph 1991, page 810. Justice Robert Austin, in his judgment, provided the first comprehensive judicial analysis of the statutory business judgment defence in s 180(2) of the Corporations Act 2001. (2010) 28(3) Company and Securities Law Journal 16. The business judgment rule is capable of providing a defence for directors whose conduct breaches section 180(1). Justice Austin acknowledged that was an untested area of the law and a contentious legal issue. In 2003, the NSW Supreme Court handed down a decision which recognises that under certain circumstances, the chairman of the board holds special responsibilities above those of the non-executive directors. This decision was the result of an application issued by former One.Tel chairman John Greaves during the case. (2003) 8(1) Deakin Law Review 193. Significance The judgment was widely reported in the general media and a number of papers written by legal firms. The trial, in total, cost the Australian Government over $35 million. It has been estimated that ASIC spent over $20m on the case, $6 million by Packer, $4 million by One.Tel, $15 million by Rich (reimbursed in significant part by ASIC) and $5 million by CGU. In February 2010, ASIC has announced it will not appeal the decision. On 24 August 2010, it was announced that James Packer and Lachlan Murdoch would be sued for $244 million plus damages by Liquidator Paul Weston, who filed a claim in May 2007 but only activated it in 2010. The case centers on the May 2001 undertaking by PBL and News Ltd to underwrite a proposed issue of One.Tel shares to raise $132 million. On 14 September 2010, Rich announced that he would not proceed with a court case against James Packer and Lachlan Murdoch. This low-key private action was a \\"shadow\\" of Paul Weston's case and was filed in 2007 but never served on the defendants. Rich stated that he had resolved all outstanding issues with James Packer and his family company.

This only applies to Kosher birds in the wild. The Torah promises longevity to someone who performs this commandment. Sources The commandment is found in : :Should a bird's nest appear before you on the way, on any tree or on the earth, chicks or eggs, and the mother resting on the chicks or the eggs: You shall not take the mother with the offspring. You shall send away the mother, and take the offspring for yourself, so that it be good for you, and your days be long. Theological ramifications Compassion or cruelty? Rabbi Natan Slifkin has described two different approaches which Jewish thinkers have historically taken to this commandment. According to the \\"rationalist\\" approach, the purpose of the commandment is compassion: either to spare the mother bird the distress of seeing its eggs taken, or to limit the greed inherent in killing animals for one's use, or a similar reason. Whereas the \\"mystical\\" approach sees the commandment as act of cruelty to the bird rather than compassion: in fact, the bird's suffering causes God to consider Israel's suffering at the hands of its enemies, and thus leads God to rescue Israel.Shiluach haKein: The Transformation of a Mitzvah This dispute has practical ramifications, as the \\"rationalist\\" approach rules the commandment can only be done when one plans to eat the eggs (thus minimizing the birds' pain when pain is unavoidable), while the \\"mystical\\" approach calls on Jews to shoo away any mother bird even if they do not plan to take the eggs (thus maximizing the birds' pain). Theodicy As this is one of the few individual commandments for which a specific reward is promised in the text, it became a locus classicus in Talmudic literature for discussion of theodicy. One example of this is in Kiddushin 39b which discusses the problem whether the reward for commandments is in this world or the next. The explanation given in Pirkei Avot, is that the reward may not translate in this world, but rather in Olam Habah, the next world. In addition, the Talmud famously records that Elisha ben Abuyah saw a child fall off the ladder while performing this commandment (at the behest of his parents: so, while performing two mitzvot, both of which are notable for their unique promise of a reward of longevity). This irreconcilable lack of theodicy led him away from Judaism. Cultural references The metaphor of Shiluach haken is used in David Vollach's 2007 movie My Father My Lord, where the main character, Avraham, shoos away a mother bird just before the death of his son Menachem after the mother was \\"sent away\\" from the boy.

Jacques was the first woman to have a political party registered and recognized in the country. The PAIPH platform focuses on education, and the party was created to improve Haiti's international image. The PAIPH logo is a green heart on a white canvas, representing a heart of hope for the innocent Haitian. Background of Colette Jacques Jacques was born in Port-au-Prince. She was very active in school, as well as caring for four brothers and supervising her parent's business. She attended College Bird with JN Claude Duvalier (\\"Baby Doc\\"), but her parents feared that she would get involved in politics and transferred her to the SDA college in Diquini. She later attended Lycee Toussaint Louverture College where she created the first drill team for her school. Jacques was chosen by the Department of Education to sing for the presidential inauguration of \\"Baby Doc,\\" the only girl among five chosen students. Her drill team later conducted Francois Duvalier (\\"Papa Doc\\") to the cemetery in 1971. Though she had intended to study medicine, Jacques left school and worked as private secretary to the Director of the Main Post Office, as well as Assistant Accountant to the President of the SDA Franco-Hatien Union at the Adventist College. She also volunteered at the SDA Clinic in Dinquini, working to help cure tuberculosis. She went to Canada in 1975 to canvas and then studied legal secretarial work in Montreal, graduating in 1977. Jacques then studied nursing at Adventist University in Tennessee and worked on the ship USS Samuel Gumpers stationed in San Diego for the US Navy. Jacques also worked for Kaiser Permanente. In 1987 Jacques founded SOAP (Support Organization for AIDS Prevention Inc). With SOAP, Jacques became the first black woman to educate the Caribbean on AIDS. Jacques then worked as the National Project Director for the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) representing California, New York State, Florida and Connecticut. In April 1990 Jacques organized a march against the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) after becoming frustrated with discrimination against Haitian refugees and AIDS patients. Jacques was the first woman ever to demonstrate how to properly use a condom on Haitian national Television. Her nickname \\"Mme Kapot\\"(\\"Mrs Condom\\") encouraged Haitians to use the formerly taboo word, condom, in public. Jacques's presentation before an FDA panel on April 20, 1990 influenced the decision to remove Haiti from a list of AIDS carriers in August.  Founding of PAIPH  Jacques became involved in politics to improve the Haitian image worldwide. She founded PAIPH in September 1990 and was the only female among 26 candidates in the 1990 Haitian elections with the slogan \\"I am the heart of Hope for all Haitians\\".[http://www.woman%20Presidential%20candidates%201990-1999]. PAIPH's platform was focused on equal rights and education. Ertha Pascale Trouillot, the election supervisor, was ordered to arrest Jacques on her way from Radio Haiti where she was recording AIDS education PSAs. Jacques was arrested and removed from the ballot. She contested this action but was denied an audience. In December Jacques returned to California to read, approve, and sign the FDA resolution to remove Haiti from the list of AIDS carriers. PAIPH goals include better schools, improved agriculture, better construction of buildings and roads, and an improved health system.

There are currently six books in the series, all written by Springer from 2006-2010\\\\. When their mother disappears, Enola's brothers, Sherlock and Mycroft Holmes, decide to send her to a finishing school against her will. Instead, with the aid of her mother who had provided hidden funds and an elaborate cipher for her daughter to communicate with her, Enola runs away to London where she establishes a clandestine private detective career specializing in missing persons investigations. Furthermore, Enola must keep ahead of her brothers who are determined to capture and force her to conform to their expectations. This pastiche series borrows characters and settings from the established canon of Sherlock Holmes, but the Enola character is Springer's creation and specific to this series. The first book, The Case of the Missing Marquess, and the fifth, The Case of the Cryptic Crinoline, were nominated for the Edgar Awards for Best Juvenile Mystery in 2007 and 2010, respectively. In 2020, the literary series was adapted into a film with Millie Bobby Brown in the title role and Henry Cavill playing Sherlock Holmes.  Development  Before writing The Enola Holmes Mysteries, Nancy Springer had already published books that reimagined Mordred and Robin Hood. Springer developed the idea for Enola Holmes alongside her editor, Michael Green. Green initially asked her to explore \\"deepest, darkest London at the time of Jack the Ripper.\\" After some research, she realized that Sherlock Holmes was based in the same time period as Jack the Ripper. Springer rejected the idea of giving Holmes a daughter but thought the idea of a younger sister could work. To write the series, Springer researched about Victorian era England, both from historical research and through coloring books, which, according to her, it helps \\"visualize the details\\" when writing. She referred to The Annotated Sherlock Holmes by William Baring-Gould. She did not have too much difficulty in using the language of the time period since she was well versed with Victorian literature. When creating the character of Enola, Springer decided to have her as Holmes' sister, as she did not see it fitting for Holmes to be her father. The age discrepancy between Enola and Sherlock is explained as Enola being a \\"mistake child\\". For the main character's name, she researched romantic names of the era, and set on the one of a town near where she resided at the time. Sherlock's status as a bachelor and being \\"clueless about women\\" also played a role on the creation of Enola Holmes, as it allowed Springer to write a character that \\"could blindside him time after time.\\" Spring has also stated that Enola is partially based on her own life. She herself is much younger than her two older brothers, who left for college before she reached puberty. Springer, too, had an artist for a mother, who was talented with painting watercolor flowers. Due to cancer, menopause and an early-onset form of dementia, Springer's mother spent less time with her after she turned 14 years old. Further, like Enola, Springer \\"was a scrawny, bony, gawky tree- climbing tomboy with hair that needed to be washed\\" and was \\"solitary and bookish.\\"  Series overview  On Enola's fourteenth birthday, her mother disappears, and Sherlock and Mycroft, Enola's brothers, conclude that her mother voluntarily left. Enola is devastated but eventually discovers elaborate ciphers her mother wrote, which lead her to conclude that she left to live with the Romani people and escape the confines of Victorian society. Enola finds that her mother left money to fund her escape. When Mycroft insists that Enola attend boarding school and learn to be a proper lady, she runs away to London instead. Throughout the series, Enola solves numerous missing persons cases, including a rescue of Dr. John Watson, while eluding her brothers' efforts to recapture her.  The Case of the Missing Marquess (2006)  When Enola's mother disappears, Enola calls on her elder brothers Sherlock and Mycroft, who dismiss her as unimportant. Horrified by her brothers' plans to send her to a boarding school and the prospect of wearing a corset, she escapes. Dressed as a widow, she runs across Inspector Lestrade, who is working on a case with Sherlock about the disappearance of a young Viscount, Lord Tewksbury. Nearly blowing her cover, she finds a secret hiding place that seems to be the young Viscount's hideaway. Concluding that he ran away, she sets off to look for him. Upon arriving in London, Enola discovers the city is not the magical place of her imagination. The same people who have kidnapped the Viscount, who has no street smarts, kidnap Enola. After escaping with the Viscount, she bribes a woman to buy them clothing. Hiding in a police station right under Sherlock's nose, Enola runs away, leaving only a sketch of the suspect on the bench. She sends a coded message via the personal column to her mother, who responds that she has gone to live with the Romani. The epilogue reveals that Enola has taken on two personas. To the poor, she's the mute \\"Sister\\" and to the rich, Ivy, the secretary to a private investigator.  The Case of the Left-Handed Lady (2007)  Enola tries to find Lady Cecily Alistair, who disappeared from her bedroom.  The Case of the Bizarre Bouquets (2008)  Sherlock's companion, Dr. John Watson, has gone missing. Enola discovers a bouquet of flowers intended for Watson. Using the language of the flowers, she detects a threat and sets out to find the missing doctor and his kidnapper. She finds him in an insane asylum. Two policemen had been told he was an insane man, and his claims to being Watson only exacerbated their belief.  The Case of the Peculiar Pink Fan (2008)  Enola helps an old acquaintance, Lady Cecily.  The Case of the Cryptic Crinoline (2009)  Enola returns to her lodgings to find that somebody has kidnapped her landlady, Mrs. Tupper. After investigating the ransacked lodgings, she abduces that the kidnappers were after a secret message hidden in Mrs. Tupper's old crinoline dress. Enola traces the dress to Florence Nightingale, who met Mrs. Tupper in the Crimean War. After several visits to Nightingale, Enola discovers that Nightingale conducted espionage during the war. As such, Nightingale asked Mrs. Tupper to smuggle a note in her crinoline back to England but did not know that the war widow was deaf and did not understand her. Enola also realizes that Nightingale pretends to be an invalid to avoid attending social functions expected of a wealthy woman. She realizes that the functions would take time away from writing letters to achieve social reform for the needy. During her visits to Nightingale, Enola suspects someone is following her. As the person could be related to the case and a danger to Mrs. Tupper's and her safety, she relocates to the Professional Women's Club. After solving the case, she takes Mrs. Tupper and herself back to her home. Enola packs her things as she gets ready to leave. After figuring this out, Mrs. Tupper does the same. Mrs. Tupper ends up going with Enola. She escapes upon seeing Sherlock approach. Sherlock converses with Nightingale, and she reveals the reason behind Enola's escape from her brothers by describing the horrors of boarding schools and corsets.  The Case of the Gypsy Goodbye (2010)  Finally, in Enola's sixth case, Sherlock concludes that Enola has matured rapidly into a capable young woman and helps his sister not only to find her quarry but also to finally convince Mycroft of her skill. In the end, the Holmes siblings fully reconcile with the help of a final coded message from their mother, a Spartan skytale decoded using bicycle handlebars. With that resolution, Mycroft, further impressed with Enola's sophisticated business arrangements and satisfied with her residence at the Professional Women's Club, grants Enola her liberty and agrees to fund her education. Enola in turn forgives Mycroft, accepts his offer while announcing she is likely continuing her career as a private investigator. For his part, Sherlock accepts Enola as a colleague in his profession and notes that he eagerly awaits her future accomplishments.  Analysis  The Enola Holmes Mysteries has been classified as an example of neo-Victorian literature for young adults, in part due to the author's use of Victorian woman's clothes as a method to show female empowerment through the main character. According to Amy Montz, Nancy Springer rewrites the \\"social and personal expectations for fashion\\". For Montz, the corset is one of the main pieces of clothing for Victorian era stories, as \\"it is both public and private, masculine and feminine, utilitarian and ornamental, necessary and reviled.\\" In the Enola Holmes series, the corset is a piece of \\"protection, [...] masquerade [...] and storage space,\\" and is highlighted throughout the various books. In a paper about Libba Bray's Gemma Doyle Trilogy and Springer's Enola Holmes Mysteries, Sonya Fritz also classifies these series as part of the neo-Victorian movement, and talks about how those stories explore the concept of girl power. For Fritz, in Springer's books the characters conform to the social norms in public, but \\"[b]eneath this veneer of respectability and conformity [...] is a completely different life, one filled with courage, autonomy, and action.\\" According to Fritz, Enola is described to the reader as having an \\"unconventional independence\\" since the start of the story, where she is described as wearing her brother's old clothes, marking her as a tomboy. She also notes how, when faced with the prospect of being sent to a finishing school, Enola chooses to run away, which frames her as \\"a specimen of one of the feminine ideals that can be found in girl power\\". The various disguises used by Enola throughout the series demonstrates the character's understanding of femininity as something \\"performative rather than essential,\\" specially through her usage of the corset as a place to stash her money, or as a piece of armor. For Fritz, this subversion of female fashion as disguises or as secret communication offers \\"simultaneously a representation of the Victorian period and a contemporary model of girl power\\".  Reception  The first book, The Case of the Missing Marquess, and the fifth, The Case of the Cryptic Crinoline, were nominated for the Edgar Awards for Best Juvenile Mystery in 2007 and 2010, respectively. Karen MacPherson in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette called Enola a \\"highly appealing heroine\\". In a review for the first book, Children's Book and Play Review echoed the statement, calling Enola \\"a bright and endearing character\\". The review also praised the novel for being \\"fast-paced and suspenseful\\" as well as its integration of Victorian culture but noted that it \\"wrap[ped] up a bit briskly\\". Carthage College's Center for Children's Literature described the second book as a \\"solid historical mystery\\" with a \\"satisfying and surprising ending\\" despite being \\"a bit slow at the beginning\\".  Adaptations   Graphic novel  The series has been adapted in France as graphic novels by writer and artist S√©r√©na Blasco and published by Jungle! in their collection Miss Jungle. The first three graphic novels have been published in the United States by IDW.IDW: Enola Holmes: The Case of the Missing Marquess  Film  On January 9, 2018, it was announced that Millie Bobby Brown would produce and star as the title character in a film series based on the Enola Holmes books. On February 8, 2019, media reported Harry Bradbeer would direct the film project, while Jack Thorne would adapt the script. Helena Bonham Carter plays Enola Holmes' mother, while Henry Cavill plays Sherlock Holmes. On April 21, 2020, Netflix acquired distribution rights to the film, as opposed to a theatrical release due to COVID-19. The film was released on September 23, 2020.  Lawsuit On June 23, 2020, the estate of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle brought a lawsuit in New Mexico against, among others, Nancy Springer, Legendary Pictures, PCMA Productions, and Netflix, citing both copyright and trademark infringement. This is in regard to the final ten stories produced by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, which have not yet dropped into the public domain, although at the time of filing four actually had. The lawsuit specifically references Holmes' becoming more emotional in the final ten works, presenting a more \\"human\\" side to Sherlock, something that he was not known to present in the original works prior to the character's resurrection after The Final Problem. According to the suit, The Enola Holmes Mysteries and adaptations violate the trademark and copyright on this particular depiction of Holmes, as the stories are still in a time of transition between copyright and the public domain.

It was released in 1979 and contained four singles.  Background  The album was released in May 1979 on Pye Records. It featured four singles, \\"Middle of the Night\\", \\"Goodbye Goodbye\\", \\"Papa Louis\\" and \\"Taxi\\" but failed to chart. \\"Middle of the Night\\" had already appeared on the group's Greatest Hits compilation released some months earlier and was the only single to chart. At the time the group had a regular spot on the Rolf Harris show, Rolf on Saturday, OK?, where they sang several songs from the album (namely \\"Papa Louis\\", \\"Middle of the Night\\", \\"Taxi\\", \\"Sleeping Beauty\\" and \\"Ol√© Ol√©\\"). The style of the album was in the group's familiar pop mould, but with a shift towards more lightweight themes. The single \\"Goodbye Goodbye\\" was a more sombre affair and its failure in the charts led to the next two singles being aimed more at the children's market. \\"Papa Louis\\" was about a circus, while \\"Taxi\\" was a tale of a man and woman meeting in a taxi. The album, like the group's others was produced by manager Tony Hiller, it continued his trend for short songs, with many of the tracks being less than three minutes, a largely outdated concept at the time given the rise of disco music which was at its peak at the time, which favoured longer-length songs. According to member Sandra Stevens, the group had undertaken many photo shoots for the album cover, but ultimately, a painting of the group (in a hot air balloon) was used. The artwork was by Dawson Thomas. The album has never been released on Compact disc, but was released as a digital download in July 2019. It was released along with the previous album B for Brotherhood and several bonus tracks.

Ortiz, 422 U.S. 891 (1975), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that the Fourth Amendment prevented Border Patrol officers from conducting warrantless, suspicionless searches of private vehicles removed from the border or its functional equivalent. Background On November 12, 1973, Ortiz was stopped in his car by Border Patrol officers on Interstate Highway 5 at San Clemente, California. The Border Patrol officers found three people concealed in the trunk of the car. These three people were found to be in the country illegally.. After the search of the car at the checkpoint, Ortiz was convicted of transporting illegal aliens. Ortiz appealed the decision, and it was reversed by the Ninth Circuit Court.http://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=5955&context;=jclc In their decision, the Ninth Circuit Court relied on a previous decision that was made in the case of Bowen v. United States, which stated that the requirement of probable cause for roving patrols that was outlined in the case of Almeida-Sanchez also extended to searches that were made at fixed checkpoints. This court case would then go to the supreme court. Government's Argument In an argument before the Supreme Court, the Government, represented by Mark L. Evans and assisted by the Solicitor General Bork, argued that fixed checkpoints were \\"less intrusive than roving patrol searches and that the Border Patrol officials stationed at such checkpoints had less discretion in choosing which cars to search\\". Because of their less intrusive manner, the government contended that searches at fixed checkpoints fell within the fourth amendment's requirement of reasonableness, even though they did not have probable cause for the searches. Ortiz's Argument In their argument challenging the constitutionality of these checkpoints on behalf of Ortiz, Mr. Charles M. Sevilla (the court-appointed attorney for Ortiz) argued that \\"in comparing a roving to a fixed check, we have to look at the nature of the intrusion involved and each case were involved with a search, which takes place because of the unfettered exercise of discretion by Border Patrol officer at a checkpoint who decides without any criteria... that he is going to select a car, refer to secondary and conduct a full search of a car\\".https://www.oyez.org/cases/1970-1979/1974/1974_73_2050 The attorney for Ortiz did not argue that checkpoints in general on the border were illegal, but that checkpoints that were located at a distance away from the border were in fact unconstitutional. The attorney for Ortiz also argued that a warrant should have been required for the search to take place, leaving the decision for probable cause up to a judicial officer, and not to a Border Patrol man. In his oral arguments, Sevilla stated \\"There was a warrant requirement because this is the concept where certainly a judicial officer should make the determination and not a Border Patrol man standing 66 miles north of a border determining a legal concept such as the functional equivalent of probable cause\\". In summary, the attorney for Ortiz stated that because the checkpoint was 66 miles away from the border, the Border Patrol officers needed to have probable cause to search the vehicle along with a warrant. Court Opinion This court case was a unanimous vote of 9‚Äì0 in favor of Ortiz. Associate Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. delivered the majority opinion of the court. Majority Opinion In the majority opinion, Justice Powell stated that \\"nothing in this record suggests that the Border Patrol had any special reason to suspect that the respondent's car was carrying concealed aliens... The only question for decision is whether vehicle searches at traffic checkpoints... must be based on Probable Cause\\".http://www.roadblock.org/cases/ortiz In his opinion, Justice Powell makes reference to a prior case, Almeida-Sanchez v. United States that involved the constitutionality of vehicle searches conducted by roving patrols. Justice Powell states that, in the same way that these roving patrols must have probable cause for vehicle searches, traffic checkpoints must have probable cause to conduct vehicle searches as well. In the opinion, Justice Powell states that the \\"central concern of the Fourth Amendment is to protect liberty and privacy from arbitrary and oppressive interference by government officials\\". Justice Powell later goes on to say in his opinion, that the degree of discretion that is present in vehicle searches at checkpoints is not consistent with the fourth amendment, and that the Court has considered a search, even of an automobile, to be an invasion of privacy, and for that reason, the Court has always regarded probable cause as the minimum requirement for a lawful search. Overall, in the majority opinion, Justice Powell and the court ruled that at traffic checkpoints removed from the border and \\"its functional equivalents\\", officers may not search private vehicles without consent or probable cause. Concurring Opinions Justice Rehnquist In Justice Rehnquist's concurring opinion, he states that although he dissented in Almeida-Sanchez v. United States, he joined the opinion of the Court, because a majority of the Court still adhered to that ruling. Justice Rehnquist put emphasis on the fact that the Court's opinion is confined to full searches, and does not extend to fixed-checkpoint stops that asked about citizenship status. Chief Justice Burger and Justice Blackmun In their concurrence opinion, Chief Justice Burger and Justice Blackmun agreed with the Majority Opinion, but they wrote that they \\"hope that when we next deal with this problem we give greater weight to the reality that the Fourth Amendment prohibits only \\"unreasonable searches and seizures\\" and to the frequent admonition that reasonableness must take into account all the circumstances and balance the rights of the individual with the needs of society\\".

According to the Texas Almanac, the community had an estimated population of 2,000 in 2000. But in the 2011 census, the community had a population of 7,666. The community also extends towards Travis County off of Highway 71. The community-proper, located at the intersection of C.R 404 and Spur 191, is home to a community center, a former two-room local schoolhouse which was closed after merging with Marble Falls ISD. The community also contains a Non-Denominational church and a Church of Christ, and was formerly the home of BJ Cafe, reputed to have been an occasional favorite of Willie Nelson. The Cafe closed in 1990 and is now a private residence and auto repair shop. In 2020, Willie Nelson was living on the Luck Ranch in Spicewood.HBO, Real Time with Bill Maher, April 3, 2020. Geography Spicewood is located at (30.4754724, -98.1564068). It is situated one mile north of State Highway 71 in southeastern Burnet and western Travis Counties, approximately nine miles southeast of Marble Falls. The nearest major city is Austin, located 22 miles southeast of Spicewood. Climate The climate in this area is characterized by hot, humid summers and generally mild to cool winters. According to the K√∂ppen Climate Classification system, Spicewood has a humid subtropical climate, abbreviated \\"Cfa\\" on climate maps.Climate Summary for Spicewood, Texas History Spicewood was established in the late 19th century, although many residents claim direct lineage from settlers in the early 19th century, many land deeds originating from \\"script\\" issued by the Republic of Texas and derived from Spanish land grants. The name possibly came from the Spicewood (Sassafras) timber that grew along nearby Little Cypress Creek. A post office opened in 1899 with James B. Pangle as its postmaster. The Spicewood post office itself moved (2000) from its original location in Spicewood, one mile south to Hollingsworth Corner, and now serves a 100 mi area in three counties, Burnet, Blanco, and Travis, leading many served to incorrectly believe they actually \\"live in\\" old Spicewood-proper. As surrounding communities began to decline (early 20th century), many of their residents turned to Spicewood as the focus of local community life. A Baptist church was organized in 1908. In 1919, Spicewood school replaced nearby Rockvale school (no longer extant, only the graveyard remains) as the official local school. The population was approximately 100 during the mid-1920s and rose to 125 by 1933. Local businesses prospered when Farm Road 93 (present-day State Highway 71) was built through the area during the 1940s. In 1949, the school in nearby Haynie Flat consolidated with Spicewood's school district. Three years later, Spicewood became part of the Marble Falls Independent School District. The population, which stood at around 100 in the 1970s, had grown to an estimated 2,000 by 2000. Although it is unincorporated, Spicewood has a post office, with the ZIP code of 78669.Zip Code Lookup The local magneto-driven Spicewood Telephone exchange was taken over by GTE in the early 1970s and the area is now served by Verizon and cellular phone services. Except for Naumann Feed and Ranch Supply (1 mile NW), the majority of local businesses are 1 mi. S, at nearby \\"Hollingsworth Corner\\" (often misunderstood to be Spicewood-proper) and include a general store serving gasoline, hardware, snack foods/beverages, Marine/Boat Service, Used Car Lot, Real Estate, insurance, and Bar-B-Que restaurant. A favorite outdoor-destination is nearby Krause Springs, formerly known as Tiger (\\"tigger\\") Springs, a spring-fed pond, swimming pool, and picnic/camping concession. The Spicewood area has four privately owned airports, one of them, the old \\"Austin Air Ranch\\" or \\"Windermere\\", FAA- identifier \\"88R\\", welcoming to public use, with fuel, hangar, and light- maintenance available, daytime-VFR use only. The other three airports, Flying X River Ranch (8TA3), Lakeside Beach (0XS6), and Fall Creek Air Ranch (52TS) (the last one not depicted on charts), are \\"Prior-Permission Required/At-Risk\\" only. During September 2011, wildfires hit and significantly damaged the Spicewood area. 67 structures were lost or damaged across five subdivisions. The majority of the homes in those subdivisions were destroyed, with 22 homes were destroyed in one subdivision alone. 17 state agencies and 150 firefighters worked to control the blaze. It affected a minimum of 10 square miles, or 6,400 acres. Education Public education in the community of Spicewood is provided by the Marble Falls Independent School District.

Pye Records was about to fold at this point, and this album was released to finish their contract and was made up of previously unreleased and rare material.

Facts  On 19 October 1973, a friend came to the plaintiff's house to tell her of a serious accident, involving her husband and three children, two hours after it had occurred. He drove her to the hospital where she was told one child was dead, and saw her husband and two other children seriously injured, covered in oil and mud. She suffered serious nervous shock as a result and sued the defendant who was responsible for the accident. Earlier decisions in English courts had allowed victims to recover damages for psychiatric injury sustained as a result of witnessing the imperilment of a loved one, but only where the claimant was actually present at the scene.See Hambrook v Stokes http://swarb.co.uk/hambrook-v-stokes-brothers-ca-1925/ This case was unique at the time because the claimant suffered injuries away from the scene of the accident and hours after the accident occurred. This case is frequently examined by law students and students of legal philosophy. Legal scholar Ronald Dworkin used the case as subject matter in a hypothetical case examined by a fictional, ideal judge named Hercules in his book Law's Empire. Trial Judgment The trial judge held that the defendants owed duty of care to the claimant as she saw her husband and children covered in oil and blood as a result of the accident. She suffered psychiatric injury, including clinical depression and personality changes, after witnessing her family's situation in the hospital. The trial ruled for McLoughlin. Court of Appeal Judgment The Court of Appeal rejected McLoughlin's appeal on grounds of public policy. The Court held the injury was foreseeable, and a duty of care was owed to McLoughlin. However, they did not allow McLoughlin to recover damages. Stephenson L.J. held that the consequence of breach should be limited as a matter of policy. Griffiths L.J. held that the defendants had a limited duty of care (e.g. only towards persons near the road who were directly affected), and that foreseeable consequences did not automatically impose a duty of care. The Court also held that only legislature should extend the scope of liability. House of Lords Judgment The House of Lords found in favour of McLoughlin, that the nervous shock suffered by McLoughlin was reasonably foreseeable and that policy considerations should not inhibit a decision in her favour. Lord Wilberforce delivered the leading speech, and laid out the test for recovery of damages for personal injury resulting from nervous shock. First, a close familial relationship must exist between claimant and victim (the Court disqualified an ordinary bystander). Second, the claimant must be in close proximity to the accident \\"in both time and place\\"; this includes witnesses of the immediate aftermath of the accident. Third, and last, the shock suffered by the claimant must \\"come through sight or hearing of the event, or of its immediate aftermath\\". Lords Wilberforce and Scarman both noted the influence of the leading American case on this issue, Dillon v. Legg (1968).

Family Kingsmill was the youngest of five children of Samuel and Martha Eyre of New House, Whiteparish, Wiltshire.Thomas Smith, A Topographical and Historical Account of the Parish of St. Mary-le-Bone (1833), 48. His elder brother was Robert Eyre, Solicitor-General in 1708-10 and then Chief Justice of the Common Pleas in 1725-35. Career His mother was looking for a place of employment for him in 1702, and sought the help of John Locke, the philosopher. He had served 8 years (including time in Holland) as an apprentice to a Mr Chitty, a merchant, supplying stores to the Navy Board.John Locke, Mark Goldie, and Esmond Samuel De Beer, John Locke: Selected Correspondence (Oxford University Press, 2002), 302. The outcome of this has not been discovered. Somehow, Eyre entered the circle of Robert Walpole. The point of contact may have been his brother Robert. This led to Eyre's appointment as Agent to the Four Companies of Invalids of Chelsea Hospital in 1716, a post in the gift of Robert Walpole as its treasurer. This was followed in 1718 by his appointment as Secretary to the Commissioners of Chelsea College. In this period, Eyre (according to a recent suggestion) was responsible for laying out the garden at Walpole's Norfolk mansion at Houghton. He may also have designed other gardens during the 1720s.Andrew Eburne, 'Charles Bridgeman and the Gardens of the Robinocracy' Garden History 31(2) (Winter, 2003), pp. 193-208.JSTOR subscription required During the 1720s, Eyre became involved in the ironmaking project of William Wood, whose son had obtained a patent for a method of making iron in an air furnace using mineral coal in 1727. This was followed by another to Wood himself in 1728 for something similar, but the enterprise collapsed because Wood was unable to perform what he promised.English Patents, nos. 489 and 502; M. W.

The album was recorded on manager Tony Hiller's label, Dazzle Records in 1980, but went unreleased in the UK. The album did get a release however in Australia and New Zealand on RCA Records. Today the album is virtually impossible to get hold of and is considered to be the 'holy grail' among fans.  Background  The album featured the singles \\"Honey Don't Throw Our Love Away\\" and \\"Will You Love Me Tomorrow\\", which were the first two singles released on Hiller's Dazzle label following their departure from Pye Records at the end of 1979. Track \\"Sugar Mouse\\" was released as a single in the Netherlands. Also included on the album was a cover version of the song \\"You're the Greatest Lover\\", which had been a million-seller in Europe for the Dutch group Luv', but was unknown in the UK. Album track \\"Heartbreaker\\" was later re-used as a track on the group's 1983 album, Lightning Flash (as well as a 1982 B-side). Like other albums by the group, the style of the tracks was in their trademark pop vein, although a new maturity was present on a number of tracks such as a sombre take on the 1960s hit \\"Will You Love Me Tomorrow\\" and ballad, \\"Let's Get the Show on the Road\\". This album also saw the group prominently using synthesizers on many tracks for the first time, notably so on songs such as \\"Saturday Night\\", which lent the album a more contemporary feel than had been seen on the group's two previous albums. The songs were produced as usual by manager Tony Hiller. Group members Sandra Stevens and Lee Sheriden have both named \\"Heartbreaker\\" as their favourite of their own songs. Sheriden says that had the song been released a couple of years earlier, it would have been a hit. The unusual album cover (for many years unseen by most European fans) depicts the group apparently being held hostage by a robot - possibly in homage to the track \\"Andrea Android\\". Another photo session at the time saw the group being menaced by a toy mouse - a possible reference to the \\"Sugar Mouse\\" track. The album was finally released in the UK and other countries as a digital download in August 2019. It was released along with the previous album Singing a Song and several bonus tracks.

Zelinsky that was awarded the Newbery Medal in 1984. Based on a 2007 online poll, the National Education Association listed the book as one of its \\"Teachers' Top 100 Books for Children.\\" Plot summary Every school year, Leigh Botts writes a letter to his favorite author, Boyd Henshaw. In the 6th grade, Leigh's class has an assignment to write letters to their favorite authors. Leigh includes all the questions he was given as a numbered list. Mr. Henshaw writes back, teases Leigh for not doing research, and includes more questions for the boy to answer. Leigh is angry and at first refuses to answer. When Leigh's mother finds out, she demands he show Mr. Henshaw the courtesy of a reply. Through his answers to Mr. Henshaw, Leigh's concerns and conflicts are revealed. He struggles with his parents' divorce, being the new kid in school, his relationship with a neglectful father, and a school lunch thief. In a later letter, Mr. Henshaw encourages him to keep a diary of his thoughts and feelings. Leigh is reconciled to the writer, and his new diary is at first written to a Mr. Pretend Henshaw. Through writing this diary, Leigh learns to accept the parts of his life he cannot change. He must deal with problems that many other children also have to cope with, such as feeling lonely because he is new in town and completing school assignments. His parents will never remarry, he can never fully depend on his father, and he must find adult ways to deal with \\"bad things,\\" such as not finding the person who still steals his lunch. Leigh decides to write for the Young Writers club. When he is unable to turn out a story or poem for a school writing contest, he writes a memory of when he and his father hauled grapes to a factory. This earns him an honorable mention in the school yearbook. When one of the contestants turns out to have cheated, Leigh earns his place for lunch with a famous author. Even though the author is not Mr. Henshaw, she compliments Leigh's story. Background Cleary said she began the novel after \\"two little boys who didn't know one another asked me to write about a boy whose parents were divorced. And I had never thought about it, but I said I'd ‚Äî give it a try.\\" Reception Kirkus Reviews said of the book, \\"All of this, in Leigh's simple words, is capably and unobtrusively structured as well as valid and realistic. From the writing tips to the divorced-kid blues, however, it tends to substitute prevailing wisdom for the little jolts of recognition that make the Ramona books so rewarding.\\" In a retrospective essay about the Newbery Medal-winning books from 1976 to 1985, literary critic Zena Sutherland wrote, \\"Perhaps because Cleary so deftly shows her protagonist changing there seems no need for alternate voices or viewpoints to give breadth to the story. Its immediacy never becomes too intense; its humor never makes light of the seriousness of the theme. A gem in 1983, the year of its publication, it is still a gem as the years pass.\\" References Category:1983 American novels Category:Epistolary novels Category:Newbery Medal-winning works Category:Novels by Beverly Cleary Category:Novels set in California Category:Books illustrated by Paul O.

In 1983, the library, as well as the Abbey of St. Gall, were designated a World Heritage Site, as ‚Äúan outstanding example of a large Carolingian monastery and was, since the 8th century until its secularisation in 1805, one of the most important cultural centres in Europe‚Äù.  History and architecture  The library was founded by Saint Othmar, founder of the Abbey of St. Gall. During a fire in 937, the Abbey was destroyed, but the library remained intact. The library hall, designed by the architect Peter Thumb in a Rococo style, was constructed between 1758‚Äì67. A Greek inscription above the entrance door, ', translates as \\"apothecary of the soul\\".  Collections  The library collection is the oldest in Switzerland, and one of earliest and most important monastic libraries in the world. The library holds almost 160,000 volumes, with most available for public use. In addition to older printed books, the collection includes 1650 incunabula (books printed before 1500), and 2100 manuscripts dating back to the 8th through 15th centuries; among the most notable of the latter are items of Irish, Carolingian, and Ottonian production. These codices are held inside glass cases, each of which is topped by a carved cherub offering a visual clue as to the contents of the shelves below; for instance, the case of astronomy- related materials bears a cherub observing the books through a telescope. Books published before 1900 are to be read in a special reading room. The manuscript B of the Nibelungenlied is kept here. A virtual library has been created to provide broader access to the manuscripts: Codices Electronici Sangallenses. This project has been expanded to include codices from other libraries as well and is operating under the name e-codices. Currently, more than 600 manuscripts from the Abbey library of Saint Gall are available in digital format.

This introduced him to the film industry at an early age after singing on soundtracks for John Tesh's Romantic Christmas, Batman, Edward Scissorhand and was chosen as the voice of Simba in The Lion King, but had to drop out of the project after coming down with strep throat a week before production. This early exposure to film led him to Lynch Productions at the age of 15, where he worked on Nickelodeon kid shows as production assistant and eventually writer's assistant. Michael graduated with honors from USC School of Film and Production in 2000. Since graduation, Michael has directed commercials, including Macy's swimwear; music videos for Tsar, Jonathan Wilson and is working with TeePee Records to direct videos for five of its bands.

She developed the concept of a magazine in website format where users could 'click' to buy while trying to source product online for a fashion shoot. Having raised the ¬£1.2m (approx $2m) start-up costs with the assistance of her then-husband, Massenet launched the company from their flat in Chelsea, London. In the early days, the operation was so low-key that the company's black delivery boxes were stacked up in the bathtub. Initially, designers and investors were reluctant to support Net-a- Porter because it lacked a physical retail outlet. Massenet recalled the credibility gap in a 2013 interview in The Observer: \\"They'd listen and they'd nod and then afterwards they'd say, 'Just tell me one more thing: where is your store?'\\" However, in 2001, Roland Mouret was persuaded to sell his collection via the website. By 2004, the same year in which it won best fashion shop at the British Fashion Awards, the company was profitable. In 2010, Massenet sold a majority stake in Net-a-Porter to Swiss luxury goods holding company Richemont for an estimated ¬£50m. She remains an investor and executive chairwoman. At the time it was bought by Richemont in 2010, Net-a- Porter was valued at $533 million. The Outnet, a site focusing on previous seasons' designs at discount prices was launched in 2009; in 2011, a menswear site Mr Porter was established under the stewardship of Toby Bateman who then said: ‚ÄúThe original concept around the Mr Porter customer was that he was the man in the Net-A-Porter girl‚Äôs life.‚Äù> Bateman then left Mr Porter in 2019 and has now been replaced by Fiona Firth as Managing Director.

Brands it retails include Stella McCartney, Yves Saint Laurent and Diane von Furstenberg. Labels such as Alexander Wang, Yves Saint Laurent and RM by Roland Mouret have created capsule collections specifically for the site. Writing in The Observer in 2010, Eva Wiseman noted that being stocked by Net-a-Porter is becoming important to designers as it: \\"not only guarantees new customers but its [Net-a-Porter's] credibility gives a fashion brand value\\". As of September 2013, Net-a-Porter employed 2,600 people in the UK, US and Hong Kong, with further offices in Shanghai and fulfillment centres on the outskirts of three cities. In early 2014, Net-a-Porter launched a print magazine called Porter, with an associated app and digital version of the magazine. Some 400,000 copies will be distributed six times a year in 60 countries. Playing off of its name, Net-a-Porter recently added a sportswear section to their website called Net-a-Sporter. The sportswear section of the website was launched in July 2014. When speaking of the addition of Net-a- Sporter to the e-tailer's online roster, the company's President Alison Loehnis said \\"We spotted a gap in the market for being a one-stop shop for workout wear where fashion meets function and where performance and style are equally valued.\\" In August 2014, Massenet revealed that she originally wanted to call the website, \\"What's New, Pussycat?\\" Merger The combined revenues of the two companies prior to the merger was about $1.4 billion and their websites received a combined 24 million unique visitors annually. The deal was announced in March 2015, and went into effect in September. The combined network reached about 180 countries. The parent company of Net-A- Porter, Richemont, received 50% of the total available shares, however their voting rights were capped at 25%, giving Yoox the ability to run the company.

The structure is called a dolmen, which was the most common megalithic structure in Europe. The dolmen is of the Severn-Cotswold tomb type, and consists of a large capstone on top, with smaller upright stones supporting it. The limestone capstone at Tinkinswood weighs approximately 40 long tons and measures x ; it is thought to be the largest in Britain, and also in Europe. It would have taken some 200 people to lift the stone into the correct position. It was originally all covered by a mound of soil, which has been removed over time. The remaining mound behind the structure measures approximately x in size. History Inside the burial chamber with the capstone on top Tinkinswood was once a village but now all that remains is the burial chamber, which was built about 6000 BP, about 1,000 years or so before Stonehenge was constructed. The site was excavated in 1914, and inside the chamber there were 920 human bones, which were nearly all broken. This showed that at least forty people of all ages and sexes were buried there during the Neolithic period; it would appear to be a burial chamber used by the whole settlement. The corpses of the dead were probably left exposed before being moved into the burial chamber. Neolithic and Bell- Beaker style pottery has also been found, this showed that the burial chamber tomb was probably used by a community over a long period of time, maybe up until the early Bronze Age period. Restoration work was carried out at the same time, with a brick pillar built to support the capstone. From the site two parallel lines of stones form an avenue leading away from the burial chamber to the south east. Along a second avenue to the north east lie many stones. A large single stone stands due east, and two flat parallel standing stones point to the top of the nearby Coed Sion Hill. The site is managed by Cadw, a Welsh Government body responsible for the protection, conservation and promotion of the built heritage of Wales. In October 2011, new excavations began at the site.Tinkinswood Community Archaeology Myths and legends alt=A map of Western Europe with certain areas highlighted in dark green. Many of the myths and legends of Tinkinswood are also associated with the nearby burial site of St Lythans, a short distance away. Legend has it that anyone who spends a night at Tinkinswood on the evenings before May Day, St John's Day (23 June), or Midwinter Day would either die, go mad, or become a poet. This legend is similar to the general legend about mountain tops. The group of boulders to the south east of the monument are said to be women who were turned to stone for dancing on the Sabbath day, another legend which is associated with dolmens.

His most noted work was written to defend Needwood Forest which was enclosed at the beginning of the 19th century. He was the father of Francis Mundy.  Life  Francis Noel Clarke Mundy was born 15 August 1739 at Osbaston Hall, Osbaston, Leicestershire, which at that time belonged to the Mundys a family which had been based in Markeaton since John Mundy bought lands in Derbyshire. He received his education at Repton School and at Winchester and then proceeded to New College, Oxford in 1757,receiving his MA in 1761. In 1762‚Äì3, Joseph Wright exhibited a set of six portraits that were commissioned by Mundy. Each of the portraits were in the distinctive dress of the Markearton Hunt consisting of yellow breeches and a blue coat over a scarlet waistcoat. These paintings hung at the ancestral home of Markeaton Hall. The subjects of these commissions included old school friends like Harry Peckham K.C. and relatives like his brother-in-law, Francis Burdett. Mundy married first Elizabeth Ayrton who died in Falmouth aged 22 on 1 October 1768. He then married Elizabeth eldest daughter of Sir Robert Burdett bart in 1770 and had two sons: Francis and Charles GodfreyOf Burton Hall near Loughborough in the county of Leicester His second wife died in 1807 aged 64. As a poet he is considered part of the Lichfield circle. Mundy's bust by Francis Legatt Chantrey. William Mundy. Painting by Ramsay Richard Reinagle. Mundy died in 1815 and the magistrates of Derbyshire commissioned a bust by Francis Chantrey which was placed in the county hall in memory of his long and eminent services as justice of the peace and chairman of the quarter sessions. The bust bears the following inscription: > \\"This Effigy is consecrated by his Countrymen to the Memory of Francis Noel > Clarke Mundy who having modestly declined their unanimous Offer to elect him > their Representative in Parliament continued to preside on the Bench of > Justices in this Hall during a period of nearly 50 years with a clearness of > judgment and an integrity of decision well worthy of being gratefully and > honourably recorded This excellent Man admired for the elegance of his > literary Productions beloved for the gentleness of his Manners revered for > his public and private Virtues lived happily at his paternal seat at > Markeaton to the age of 76 years May his Example excite Emulation \\" In addition there is an engraving of him with his grandson, William Mundy, by Charles Turner (after R. R. Reinagle). The picture also features in the foreground the manuscript of Mundy's ‚Äò'The Fall of Needwood Forest‚Äô'. South Derbyshire magistrates court also own an oil painting of him \\"after\\" Thomas Lawrence.  Work  Mundy was the author of two admired descriptive poems Needwood Forest (1776) and the Fall of Needwood (1808). Needwood Forest was a large ancient woodland in Staffordshire which was destroyed under the authority of the Inclosure Act of 1803. Despite Mundy's and other protests it was removed by 1811. Anna Seward regarded his poem, Needwood Forest, as \\"one of the most beautiful local poems\\" and \\"the first entirely local poem in our language\\" and persistedly promoted Mundy's poetry, writing verses in praise of it. However she also claimed that large portions of Needwood Forest were actually written by herself and by Erasmus Darwin. Needwood Forest was well regarded in its time, and is an example of the provincial verse that was starting to become a feature of late eighteenth century English literature. The poem, which is in five parts is written in octosyllabic couplets and contains allusions to Milton, Spenser, Denham and Pope. It was printed privately (500 copies as presents to his friends) and is appended with a number of commendatory verses, by fellow Lichfield poets Sir Brooke Boothby, Erasmus Darwin and Anna Seward (attributed only by their initials). Seward tried to persuade Mundy to publish the poem publicly. The Fall of Needwood also contains three shorter poems, see below (p. 37). There also existed an edition combining the two earlier volumes, with different pagination to the original volumes. The appended poems also differ. Following the grand climacteric there are two commendatory poems, by Seward and by Hayley. In the posthumous 1830 edition are appended the 1808 poems and five others, titled Miscellaneous Pieces (p. 97). One of these, The Backwardness of the Present Spring Accounted For, May 5th, 1782 (p. 110), has also been attributed to Anna Seward.  Selected poems and publications  Poems include; * 1758 Winter * 1765 Ode to Health * 1765 The Harehunter * 1768 Poems * 1776 Needwood Forest * 1808 Fall of Needwood ** Learning to spin n.d. ** On a picture by R.R.

Julia Curzon ** The Papplewick coursing ** To the Hon. Lady Cavendish  Legacy  In 1830, two volumes were published which made available the many poems not published during Mundy's lifetime. Finally, in 1851, William Mundy paid for a memorial window to his grandfather to be installed in Markeaton church.

Background  This album was a collection of cover versions, following on from their successful Sing 20 Number One Hits album released a year earlier. The songs contained were cover versions of hit songs from the UK charts spanning the years 1972 to 1981. The album was released by Warwick Records (United Kingdom) in November 1981, but failed to replicate the success of the previous one, thus ending their contract with the label. Some months later, the group commented on the album; \\"we recorded [the album] to keep the group together and get our faces on the TV screen where they were advertised\\". On the lack of new material present they said \\"we didn't bother to release a single or record a proper album because we knew they wouldn't make any impact\\".New Straits Times \\"A Lightning flash in the pan?\\", 13 June 1982 The album contained no single releases. The label on the 20 Disco Greats record gives the title as Dance Yourself Dizzy, while the label on 20 Love Songs gives the title as In Love. Although listed separately, the songs \\"Copacabana\\" and \\"I'll Go Where Your Music Takes Me\\" merge into each other, and have been listed as one track on subsequent compilation releases. The song \\"She's out of My Life\\" is listed as such, but is sung (by member Sandra Stevens) as \\"He's out of My Life\\". A noticeable trend on the album was the tendency to reverse the sex of the original performer. Where songs had been originally performed by males, they were performed here by the female members, such as Rod Stewart's \\"Do Ya Think I'm Sexy\\" sung by Sandra and Nicky and Baccara's \\"Yes Sir I Can Boogie\\" by Martin and Lee. Of the covers contained, the earliest was Harry Nilsson's version of \\"Without You\\", which was a No.1 hit in March 1972, while the most recent was Stevie Wonder's \\"Happy Birthday\\", which had reached No.2 in August 1981. Of the 40 tracks, 13 had been UK No.1s, while all the rest were UK top 20 hits apart from \\"Copacabana\\" and \\"I'll Go Where Your Music Takes Me\\", which reached No.42 and No.23 respectively. The album contained three songs by The Bee Gees, as well as Barbra Streisand's \\"Woman in Love\\", which was written by them. ABBA - a group Brotherhood of Man had been compared to many times during their career, were included with a cover of their song \\"Lay All Your Love On Me\\", which at the time was the group's most recent (although one of their less significant) hit. The album was released on Vinyl and Cassette, and although has never been released on Compact Disc, many of the tracks have appeared on various compilation CDs of the group in recent years.

It is the only surviving section of a much larger encyclopedia; only small parts still survive from sections on agriculture, military science, oratory, jurisprudence and philosophy. De Medicina draws upon knowledge from ancient Greek works, and is considered the best surviving treatise on Alexandrian medicine. It is also the first complete textbook on medicine to be printedCelsus: De medicina, Florence 1478. Part 1 Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh 2014; 44:252‚Äì4, and has an \\"encyclopedic arrangement that follows the tripartite division of medicine at the time as established by Hippocrates and Asclepiades ‚Äî diet, pharmacology, and surgery.\\" This work also covers the topics of disease and therapy. Sections detail the removal of missile weapons, stopping bleeding, preventing inflammation, diagnosis of internal maladies, removal of kidney stones, the amputation of limbs and so forth. The original work was published some time before 47 CE. It consisted of eight books in highly regarded Latin text. The subject matter is divided as follows: * Book I ‚Äì Diet, hygiene, and the benefits of exercise. * Book II ‚Äì The cause of disease, its symptoms and prognosis. * Book III ‚Äì Treatment of diseases, including the common cold and pneumonia. He classified mental disorders into: Phrenitis, delirium with fever; Melancholia, depression; one due to false images and disordered judgment, presumably schizophrenia; Delirium due to fear; Lethargus, coma; and Morbus comitialis, epilepsy. The term insania, insanity, was first used by him. The methods of treatment included bleeding, frightening the patient, emetics, enemas, total darkness, and decoctions of poppy or henbane, and pleasant ones such as music therapy, travel, sport, reading aloud, and massage. He was aware of the importance of the doctor- patient relationship. * Book IV ‚Äì Anatomical descriptions of selected diseases. * Book V ‚Äì Medicines, including opiates, diuretics, purgatives and laxatives. * Book VI ‚Äì Ulcers, skin lesions and diseases. * Book VII ‚Äì Classical operations, such as lithotomy and removal of cataracts. * Book VIII ‚Äì Treatment of dislocations and fractures.

A pioneering military and civilian flying career was cut short when he attempted a treacherous flight across the Atlantic Ocean with Elsie Mackay in a single engined Stinson Detroiter. Private life Hinchliffe was born in Munich, Germany in 1893 to Richard George Hinchliffe (1868 - circa 1942) and Florence Williams. His younger sister Gladys was born in 1897 in Liverpool. He was educated at Liverpool College, where he was a member of the Officer Training Corps, then attended medical school, training as a dentist. He spoke four languages (including German), was an avid reader, a skilled artist, an accomplished sportsman and a skilled mechanic. He met his Dutch wife Emilie Gallizien when he was Chief Pilot of the Royal Dutch Airlines (KLM) and she was assistant to the company's General Manager. His brother in law F. C. Lay was the first Pupil to become head master at the City of Oxford High School for Boys. Military career Hinchliffe was commissioned as a Second Lieutenant in the North Lancashire Brigade Company, West Lancashire Divisional Transport and Supply Column (Territorial Army) of the British Army Service Corps on 20 March 1912, and promoted Lieutenant on 17 September 1914. He is then believed to have served in the Royal Artillery from 1914‚Äì16 before joining the Royal Naval Air Service where he underwent training at Redcar, Cranwell and Frieston. Gaining his Royal Aero Club Certificate in September 1916 as Flight Sub- Lieutenant, Royal Naval Air Service, he served as an Instructor at Cranwell before joining 10 Squadron RNAS in January 1918 to commence active service. During February and March his successful sorties in a Sopwith Camel named Allo Lil Bird included bombing raids and downing two enemy aircraft in dogfights at Rumbeke and Roulers. When the Royal Air Force was formed on 1 April 1918, he was appointed Lieutenant (Honorary Captain) RAF in the (renamed) No. 210 Squadron RAF. Within three months he had shot down a further five enemy aircraft, at Roulers, Bailleul, Neuve-√âglise, Armenti√®res and Hazebrouck. During the Hazebrouck night encounter he was shot through the forehead and crashed at Nieppe Forest (Dickebusch Lake). He suffered severe facial injuries and lost the sight in his left eye for which he wore a patch for the rest of his life. For his exploits he was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross. He was transferred to the RAF unemployed list on 21 August 1919. He was initially hospitalised on 23 June 1918 and then invalided home on 27 June and treated at a hospital in central Hampstead. Post war After the War he became a widely experienced pilot, pioneering, opening and flying many civilian routes for both KLM and Imperial Airways. In 1920 he made the first airmail flight from the Netherlands to England. In 1921 he made the first civilian passenger night-flights from Lympne to Amsterdam, and Amsterdam to Berlin. His new routes included Amsterdam-Gelsenkirchen-Dortmund-London-Amsterdam in 11 hours flying time and Berlin-Amsterdam-London-Lowestoft-Lympne in just over 12 hours flying time. During 1922-1923 he was Chief Pilot of KLM. In 1923 he joined Instone Air Line covering Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, London and Paris, and after the merger into Imperial Airways he flew a De Havilland Hercules to Cairo and opened up the Imperial Airways Eastern route. His flying experience included over 40 types of aircraft including; Avro, British Aerial Transport, Bleriot, Bristol F2b, Caudron, Curtis, De Havilland, Fokker, Grahame-White Boxkite, Handley-Page, Nieuport, Pemberton-Billing Scout, Sopwith Camel, Sopwith Dolphin, Sopwith 1¬Ω Strutter, Sopwith Pup, Vickers Vimy and Vickers Vulcan. In September 1927, Hinchliffe flew Charles A. Levine back to the US, replacing Clarence Chamberlin who had flown Levine from the U.S. to Germany. Hinchliffe and Levine were filmed at the Clapham Studios in London for a short film made in the DeForest Phonofilm sound-on-film process before their departure. Transatlantic Flight Hinchliffe's peerless reputation made him the natural choice for pilot when Elsie Mackay attempted to achieve her ambition to be the first woman to fly across the Atlantic Ocean. The daughter of P & O chairman James Mackay, 1st Earl of Inchcape had bought a Stinson Detroiter, and had it shipped from the USA to England and delivered to the Brooklands motor racing track, which at the time was also used as an airfield. Named Endeavour, it was a monoplane with gold tipped wings and a black fuselage, powered by a 9 cylinder, 300 h.p. Wright Whirlwind J-6-9 (R-975) engine, with a cruising speed of 84 mph. In early March 1928 the Daily Express discovered that Captain Hinchliffe and Elsie were preparing for a transatlantic attempt by carrying out test flights at RAF Cranwell and were staying at The George Hotel in Leadenham, near Grantham. The story was silenced by Elsie's threatened legal action as she intended to depart in secret while her father was in Egypt, having promised her family she would not make the attempt. The Irish Times reported on 14 March 1928 \\"Captain Hinchcliffe and Captain Joynson-Wreford were at Baldonnel Aerodrome about a fortnight ago, and, although no absolute definite arrangements were made, it was understood that he would make the aerodrome the headquarters for his Transatlantic attempt.\\" At 08:35am on 13 March 1928 Endeavour took off from RAF Cranwell, Lincolnshire, with minimal fuss as Walter had told only two friends and Elsie had registered under the pseudonym of 'Gordon Sinclair'. Approximately five hours later, at 13.30pm the Chief lighthouse keeper at Mizen Head on the south west coast of Cork Ireland saw the monoplane over the village of Crookhaven, on the great circle course for Newfoundland. A French steamer later reported seeing them still on course, but nothing else is known. A crowd of 5,000 is reputed to have waited at Mitchel Field, Long Island. In December 1928, eight months later, a single piece of identifiable undercarriage washed ashore in North West Ireland.

Development The RWD-19 was designed in 1937-1938 in the RWD bureau. The chief designer was Jerzy Drzewiecki. Designer Tadeusz Chyli≈Ñski designed the wing. The aircraft was designed specially in order to beat world records of distance in light aircraft category, under influence of French Caudron sports aircraft. Description Mixed construction low-wing cantilever monoplane, conventional in layout, with a fixed landing gear and a closed cockpit. Steel framed fuselage, covered with canvas on a wooden frame, aluminum in front engine section. Three-part trapezoid wings with rounded tips, of wooden construction, two-spar, plywood (in front) and canvas covered, fitted with split flaps and slats. Conventional cantilever empennage, plywood (fins) and canvas (elevators and rudder) covered. Two seats in tandem, under a canopy, with a fixed panoramic windshield and small side windows. Behind the cockpit was a place for a baggage. Conventional fixed landing gear with a rear wheel, the main gear was in covers. 4-cylinder straight engine de Havilland Gipsy Major in front, driving a two-blade tractor wooden propeller Szoma≈Ñski of a fixed pitch. Fuel tanks 180 l in mid-wing section. Cruise fuel consumption 28 l/h. Operational history The prototype was built and first flown in October 1938 (registration SP-BPD). In winter it was evaluated by the Aviation Technical Institute in Poland. It was rather difficult to fly. There were no plans of serial production. The plan of beating a record was abandoned, because the German Arado Ar 79 had made it in the meantime. The sole aircraft was probably destroyed during air raids on the DWL factory after the outbreak of World War II.

Caliph al-Muqtafi successfully defended his capital against the coalition armies of Seljuq Sultan Muhammad of Hamadan and Qutb ad-Din of Mosul.  Background  In the tenth century the Abbasid Caliphate lost control of most of its former provinces. Most of the governors were able to establish their own dynasties, and in the meantime the central government was unable to stop independence movements within the empire, though they retained their spiritual leadership over the Muslims since the new states (the Tulunids/Ikhshidids, Hamdanids, and others) acknowledged the Caliph as the head of the state and the successor of the prophet. In 1055, Tughril captured Baghdad from the Buyids under a commission from the Abbasid Caliph al-Qa'im. Although the Seljuqs respected the Caliphs, they did not let them rule.  The siege  Muhammad marched to Baghdad with an army of 30,000 men, while his ally Qutb ad-Din marched from Mosul to capture the Caliphate's provinces in central Iraq. On January 12, 1157, Muhammad reached the walls of western Baghdad. In response the Caliph gathered all his troops from Hillah and Wasit to defend the capital. In February, unable to defend western Baghdad, the caliph abandoned the western side and ordered all the bridges over the Tigris river, which separates the western side of Baghdad from its eastern side, to be destroyed. Muhammad crossed to the western side and easily captured it, and established his camp while at the same time the caliph fortified the walls of eastern Baghdad. Several catapults and ballistas were installed on the city's walls. The caliph also armed the natives of Baghdad by giving them armour and weapons, and incited them to fight the enemy of the caliphate, whom he called infidels since they waged war against the caliph, the successor of the prophet and the leader of the ummah. He also ordered his vizier Awn ad-Din ibn Hubayra to give five golden dinars to every wounded soldier. On March 4, Sultan Muhammad and his ally Zayn ad-Din, Qutb ad-Din's vizier, attacked eastern Baghdad and bombarded the city. The army of Baghdad repulsed the attack thanks to the courage of the natives of Baghdad and the naffatuns.  The end of the siege  On March 29, the Seljuqs repaired one of the bridges and crossed to the eastern side of the city, where they skirmished with both the Caliph's army and the native militias of Baghdad. The naffatuns destroyed several catapults. The Seljuqs tried to breach the gate by a battering ram but it was destroyed by the catapults on the walls. The result of the battle remained indecisive for both sides. On June 29, Sultan Muhammad ordered his men to climb the walls. He had already made 400 ladders to climb the walls of Baghdad, but the assault was repulsed due to the heavy fire and casualties. In the meantime Nur ad-Din Zangi blamed his brother for attacking the caliph's realm, which destroyed the Zengid-Seljuq alliance. Zayn ad-Din lifted the siege and returned to Mosul. Muhammad also was forced to lift the siege after his men informed him that his brother Malik Shah has captured Hamadan. He eventually realized that the siege was useless, so he preferred to fight for his throne. Thus the Siege of Baghdad came to end on 13 July 1157.

Released on EMI Records in 1983, it remains their final commercially released studio album.  Background  The album was released on EMI Records in June 1983 and was their only album with the label. This album was the first (and only) to feature new member Barry Upton who had replaced Lee Sheriden a year earlier and was their last work with long-time manager/producer and co-writer Tony Hiller. Upton took on the musical arrangement duties on ten of the twelve tracks, a role previously filled by Sheriden. Upton worked with studio session drummer Peter Boita at Boita's house in Upper Norwood London, programming all the drum tracks for the album. On going into Odyssey Studios all the drum tracks for the album were laid in one day Boita's LinnDrum computer which was also hooked up to his Simmons SDS7 Electronic drum head unit via a custom interface unit that Boita himself had developed. This method of working was new for its time; before then it was not uncommon for artistes to spend a whole day in a recording studio just to perfect the drum sound that would then be used to underpin the album when all the other musicians were brought in to start work. Peter Boita had briefly worked with Martin Lee when Lee was the lead singer in the Johnny Howard Band in 1973 and Boita was the drummer. The song \\"I Love Everybody\\" was arranged by Ivor Raymonde, a long-time hit producer, who used a string quartet heavily in the verses. Another song \\"Heartbreaker\\" was taken from their unreleased 1980 album Good Fortune and included here in its original recording, featuring Sheriden on vocals and as arranger. The album contained the singles \\"Lightning Flash\\", \\"Cry Baby Cry\\" and \\"When the Kissing Stops\\". Of these, only the first managed to chart, their first UK singles chart placing for nearly four years. Commenting on the group's new material, Upton said \\"we're returning with a new sound, a new look and our sights aimed a lot higher. People can expect good, classy pop songs from us\\".New Straits Times, \\"A Lightning flash in the pan?\\", 13 June 1982 The front cover of the album only has the lettering B H o M as an indication of a title or artist, the back cover states the group's name, while only the record itself gives the title as Lightning Flash on the label. This is the official title given to the album according to release information. Track \\"Is it Love\\" is erroneously titled \\"It is Love\\" on the back sleeve, but correct title is given on the record's label. The song \\"When the Kissing Stops\\" had been entered into A Song for Europe earlier in 1983, and although the group briefly considered performing it themselves, ultimately a three-piece group, Rubic was chosen to sing it. The song made it to the finals, but stalled at 5th place (out of eight entries). Brotherhood of Man themselves released the song in June 1983 as their final ever single. Despite being highly regarded by fans, the album failed to chart and met with critical response from the music press. Writing for Smash Hits, Neil Tennant said of the \\"Lightning Flash\\" song that despite its synthesized sound, \\"the group have failed to capture the freshness that new pop demands\\".Neil Tennant. Smash Hits review, June 1982. In reviewing the album, Record Mirror commented on the low budget sound of the music claiming that it was \\"mortgaged to the hilt\\".Record Mirror album review, June 1983.

Chu (Êú±ÂÆ∂‰ªÅ). Chu was a Chinese aeronautics engineer, who returned to China following his graduation from MIT in 1926. Chu joined the KMT National Revolutionary Army and was in charge of an aircraft plant in Yunnan that assembled American aircraft and the Soviet Polikarpov I-15. Chu developed his first helicopter in 1945 which he called the Hummingbird Model A. This single seat test craft never flew and was used for static tests until it was damaged when the rotor broke. Chu began to work on another helicopter he called the Hummingbird Model B. This single seat helicopter was similar to the Model A, but achieved flight. Following the fall of the KMT in 1949, Chu was exiled to Taiwan and the helicopter program was scrapped. It was not until the early 1950s that Chu returned with a larger tandem helicopter called the CJC-3. This was flown and tested in Taiwan in 1952. An upgraded version called the CJC-3A appeared in 1956. Both the CJC-3 and CJC-3A were likely influenced by American helicopter manufacturer Piasecki, based on the strikingly similar design.C. J.

Career A childhood fan of Big Daddy, Atkins began wrestling for All Star Wrestling in 1993, adopting the ringname James Mason, after the film actor of the same name at the behest of ring announcer John Harris. Early in his career, he also wrestled for Welsh promoter Orig Williams under the name Jesse James (as Williams felt the actor in question was \\"boring\\" and this would reflect poorly on Atkins). In 1995, Mason was named by All Star as \\"Young Wrestler Of 1995\\" and was interviewed by Simon Garfield for his book The Wrestling. In early 1996, he won a tournament promoted by Rumble Promotions for the World Middleweight Title left vacant by Danny Collins when he moved up the weights. Mason lost the title to Mal Sanders a month later. Mason, Dean Allmark and Doug Williams all faced and lost to Kendo Nagasaki in a December 2001 four way match at the Victoria Hall in Hanley, promoted as Nagasaki's retirement match. Mason was the final opponent eliminated by Nagasaki to win the match. In 2002, he and Sanders feuded for the British Middleweight Title in TWA with the belt passing back and forth between them. During the early 2000s he tag-teamed with Chad Collyer in Japan for Michinoku Pro. In 2003, while going through a temporary heel phase, Mason reached the final of a tournament for the vacant World Heavy- Middleweight title before losing to the American Dragon in the final at Croydon. James Mason is perhaps best known as being the Captain of Team Britain in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling during America's X-Cup Tournament in 2004. Team Britain consisted of Mason, Robbie Dynamite, Dean Allmark, and Frankie Sloan. Although Mason had several victories in America's X-Cup, Team Britain ended up being in last place. The Tournament was won and virtually dominated by Team Mexico. After America's X-Cup ended, Team Britain did not return for the TNA 2004 World X-Cup Tournament. Mason is currently wrestling in All Star Wrestling usually as a blue-eye, using the name James Mason, and as a heel often on the same event, under a mask, using the name Tagori. In November 2006, Mason defeated three former champions Drew McDonald, Doug Williams, and Robbie Brookside in a 4-way elimination match to win the vacant British Heavyweight title which he later lost to Brody Steele in 2007. In November 2008 Mason competed for World Wrestling Entertainment at the Manchester Evening News Arena, defeating Montel Vontavious Porter. Mason won a six-man one-night tournament at a Welsh Wrestling's King of the Castle in Harlech, Wales on 1 May 2010 to become the first Welsh Heavyweight Champion, as recognized by the Union of European Wrestling Alliances. He defeated JD Knight in a semi-final match, then defeated Kade Callous and Danny Garnell in a three-way final. Mason lost the Welsh Heavyweight Championship to Kade Callous on 23 October 2010 in Builth Wells after a six-month title reign. Mason has continued to wrestle for Alan Ravenhill's Welsh promotion on a regular basis, and is regarded as one of the most popular and polished performers in Welsh Wrestling. Alongside his appearances for All Star and promoting his own shows and hiring out his ring, Mason also wrestles for International Pro Wrestling: United Kingdom, LDN and several other promotions.

He specializes in the creation of prosthetic make-up for horror films. Among his notable works are the make-up effects for The Elephant Man, The Company of Wolves and the stage musical The Phantom of the Opera. Career Tucker was born in Hertford, attended the Guildhall School of Music and Drama in London, and began experimenting with artificial noses when he was asked to perform in the opera Rigoletto. The results were well received, and in 1974 he abandoned a career in opera and became a full-time make-up artist. He works from an eighteenth-century manor house in Berkshire, and is assisted by his wife Sinikka Ikaheimo. Tucker's earliest credited work is the make-up for the 1970 film of Julius Caesar, starring Charlton Heston and Sir John Gielgud. He was also responsible for aging the characters in the BBC series I, Claudius. During 1975-76, he was part of the team that created the make-up and prosthetics for the iconic Mos Eisley Cantina scene in Star Wars. In 1980, Tucker was hired to create the prosthetics that would transform John Hurt into the hideously deformed Joseph Merrick in David Lynch's film The Elephant Man. According to his website, \\"The head had 15 different sections, some of them overlapping never done before , made in foam and silicone rubber. It took seven hours to apply.\\" An appreciation of the work involved led to the creation of the Best Make-up category at the Academy Awards run by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which was first awarded in 1981. In the early 1980s, at the prompting of photographer Jay Myrdal, he fashioned the prosthetic which considerably enhanced the natural endowments of porn star Daniel Arthur Mead, who later gained notoriety under his pseudonym, Long Dong Silver. Myrdal commented that Tucker ‚Äúnormally wouldn‚Äôt have taken the job, but he was amused by the idea of making a cock‚Ä¶‚Äù In 1983, he transformed Terry Jones into the fantastically obese Mr Creosote in Monty Python's The Meaning of Life. In 1984, he developed original forms of werewolf transformation in The Company of Wolves, in which a man is seen to tear his own skin off, after which his features elongate as he becomes a wolf, and in which a wolf emerges from another man's throat. Tucker attempted to create sequences in which men turned into wolves, rather than turning into creatures which were wolf-like, and the skin-tearing sequence was achieved by the actor initially removing a latex prosthesis from his own face, and as the transformation progressed, using three dummy figures, called Bert 1, 2 and 3. In 1986, he created the prosthetics for Michael Crawford in the musical adaptation of The Phantom of the Opera by Andrew Lloyd Webber. His most recent credited work is prosthetics designer for Amitabh Bachchan's character in the 2005 Indian film Black. Awards Tucker won the BAFTA award for Best Make-Up Artist in 1983 for his work on the film Quest for Fire. In 1985, he was nominated for BAFTA awards in the categories Best Make-Up Artist and Best Special Visual Effects for his work on The Company of Wolves.BAFTA Awards database He was also the subject for a TV documentary called Skintricks made in 1988 for Amsterdam TV. The documentary was made at the time that The Company of Wolves was being produced, and featured behind the scenes footage of the make-up process. It included interviews with the actor Ronald Pickup, John Hurt, talking about his make-up for The Elephant Man, and Terry Jones talking about the make-up for Mr Creosote in the Monty Python film.

It has also been used as a film location for large- and small-budget films. The house once belonged to Ian Fleming's family, and the room that was once Fleming's nursery is now a library. History Braziers Park was built in the late 17th century (with a datestone of 1688), and modelled in the Strawberry Hill Gothic style of architecture by Daniel Harris on behalf of Isaac George Manley (1755‚Äì1837) in 1799. As a teenager, Manley had been a naval officer with Captain Cook on the first voyage of the Endeavour 1768‚Äì71; and was later Vice Admiral of the Red, and as commander of captured the French corvette Legere in 1796. He was made a Rear Admiral in 1809. In 1839, Frances Eliza (Fanny) Grenfell (1814‚Äì91), later a biographer, was living at Braziers Park with her sisters, and was visited by novelist Charles Kingsley (1819‚Äì75), then a Cambridge undergraduate. Kingsley later fictionalized this meeting as that of Argemone with Lancelot Smith in his first novel Yeast (1848). Despite Fanny having taken a vow of chastity with her sisters at Braziers Park, she and Kingsley married in Bath in 1844. Valentine Fleming, Member of Parliament for Henley, made substantial changes to the house when he bought it in 1906. His son Ian Fleming, the novelist, briefly lived at the house when very young. Braziers Park House (left side)Sir Ernest Moon (1854‚Äì1930), counsel to the Speaker of the House of Commons, bought the house from Fleming in 1911, and his widow Lady Moon sold the house to Norman Glaister (1883‚Äì1961) in 1950. Glaister set up the School of Integrative Social Research, which still exists at the site. Glaister had been involved in the Grith Fyrd barter for work system. The School, which in part functioned as a commune, aimed ‚Äúto explore the dynamics of people living in groups, to develop better methods of interpersonal communication and to find new ways of combining knowledge to make it more meaningful.‚Äù An important member of the community was Robert Glynn Faithfull (died 1996), who had met Glaister through the Order of Woodcraft Chivalry. Faithfull was an academic at the University of Liverpool who studied the Italian renaissance and had been in British espionage during the Second World War. He was married to Baroness Eva Erisso, a former ballerina. Their daughter, the singer and actress Marianne Faithfull, spent some of her early life in the community. Mick Jagger of the Rolling Stones came to stay with Marianne Faithfull at Braziers Park after his release from prison in 1967 as her then boyfriend. In her autobiography she described Braziers Park as a ‚Äúmixture of high utopian thoughts and randy sex‚Äù. Marianne's half-brother Simon Faithfull grew up at Braziers Park. Braziers Park today Braziers Park is now home to around 20 people, some of whom live communally, and runs educational courses. In August 1996 the first of the annual Braziers International Artists' Workshop was held. It is the site of the annual Wood music festival that began in May 2008. Braziers is also a registered \\"LAND Learner\\" site under the UK Permaculture Association.  References Notes Other sources * Admiral J.G. Manley.

The video contrasts shots of the band performing in a white room with shots of a dark, sordid party at which attendees engage in heterosexual, homosexual, interracial and zoophilic partnerships. MTV refused to air the video. Hall believes this rejection was motivated by the shots of multi-instrumentalist Xefos kissing another man.

The shopping center was originally opened in 1974. Following years of decline, the center was redeveloped in 1999 using public and private funds in an effort to revitalize downtown Spokane. The mall, still privately owned by Cowles Company, is anchored by Nordstrom and contains an outpost of AMC Theatres. History The original River Park Square was opened in 1974. In 1978, an expansion added a 55,000 square-foot enclosed second level and two skywalks connecting the mall to the JCPenney and Nordstrom stores. When completed, the shopping center contained 800,000 square-feet of retail space with The Crescent, JCPenney, and Nordstrom as anchor stores. In February 1984, a new skywalk was constructed to connect the center to The Bon March√©, which was located east of the complex. The addition of the skywalk added 20,000 square-foot of retail space to the center. In January 1987, Osco Drug closed its drug store at the shopping mall. The drug store, which previously operated as PayLess Drug and Skaggs, had been located in downtown Spokane since 1942. The space was quickly replaced by Thrifty Drug in November 1987. In April 1994, PayLess Drug, which acquired the pharmacy from Thrifty, closed for good. In 1991, JCPenney closed its store at River Park Square after relocating to the newly renovated NorthTown Mall. Burlington Coat Factory moved into the space in 1994 and remained at the mall until moving to a larger location in 2001. In April 1992, the shopping mall suffered a big loss when Frederick & Nelson, which acquired The Crescent in 1988, liquidated and closed its remaining stores. In 1995, the Spokane City Council announced that it would seek a $23.8 million federal loan to build a larger Nordstrom store in an attempt bring shoppers back to the ailing shopping center. On February 12, 1998, Nordstrom signed a 20-year lease on a new building at River Park Square. Construction began in April 1998. The old Nordstrom building was demolished shortly after for new retail space. The redeveloped $110 million shopping center opened on August 20, 1999 to a crowd of about 2,000 people. The mall has expanded in the 2010s with the acquisition of the Saad building in 2015 on the corner of Main and Wall Street being replaced with a 10,000 square foot Urban Outfitters location and in the spring of 2016 with the acquisition of the shuttered Macy's building across from Wall Street and is now being converted into luxury apartments with first floor retail.http://www.khq.com/story/28283547/urban-outfitters-coming-to-downtown- spokanehttp://www.spokesman.com/stories/2016/sep/15/proposed-redesign-of- downtown-spokane-macys-moderi/#/0 According to permits filed with the city, a Nike Factory Store will be the tenant in the new 12,000 square foot retail portion of the building, now called ‚ÄúThe M‚Äù.http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2017/nov/22/permits-indicate-nike-factory- store-planned-for-ol/< References External links * River Park Square Official Site Category:Cowles Company Category:Shopping malls in Spokane, Washington Category:Shopping malls established in 1974 Category:1974 establishments in Washington (state) ","title":"River Park Square"},{"id":"17676958","text":"Guy Co√´me (born 21 August 1946) is a Francophone Belgian politician for the Socialist Party (PS).

The ensemble toured as a Midwestern territory band, and after Coon's death Sanders continued to lead the band under his own name. Sanders worked mostly in Hollywood studios in the 1940s, and occasionally led performances at the Blackhawk once again. He was a vocalist for the Kansas City Opera in the 1950s.

Following the abduction of an overweight cat mascot of a rival hockey team (in an attempt to demoralize them), Sturgeon forbids them from seeing each other and separates them. Bruno moves in with the school genius, Elmer Drimsdale, while Boots is placed with wealthy hypochondriac George Wexford-Smith III. The two can't stand their new roommates and decide to meet at a cannon at night to discuss ways of getting back into their old room together. The two prominent ideas they have, including having both Elmer and George complain to the headmaster to get them to move elsewhere, and then framing their roommates to have themselves moved away from them, get them into more trouble. Eventually they come up with the idea to study hard to get into the Honor Roll to show they're capable and should be able to move back in together as a reward, but the plan backfires after Sturgeon attributes the boys' resulting high marks as the result of their separation. In desperation they meet again, but en route to the cannon, they spot an entangled hot air balloon stuck in a tree and find a boy stuck up there. They rescue the boy (named Francisco) using a volleyball net and take him to Sturgeon, who realizes he's the son of an important ambassador from Ottawa who got lost in a balloon during the day. They are then interrupted by Elmer Drimsdale, who witnessed the balloon in his telescope and had concluded it was a UFO. He causes a massive disturbance between both schools. The next morning, the Ambassador arrives at the school to retrieve his lost son and honor the people responsible for rescuing him ‚Äì Bruno, Boots, and Elmer, who receive medals from the RCMP, the Ontario Provincial Police, and the Ambassador, who is ironically representing the country of Malbonia, the country of which flag Bruno and Boots had used in a prank earlier in the novel. For Macdonald Hall to honor them, Elmer receives a new telescope and Bruno and Boots get their wish ‚Äì to share a room again.  Notes  *This book was written as a grade 7 English project. The author sent it off to Scholastic, which decided to publish it. * As the first instalment of the series, this novel introduces the main and recurring characters that appear in most of the rest of the books in the series, notably Bruno Walton, Melvin ‚ÄúBoots‚Äù O'Neal, Elmer Drimsdale, Perry Elbert, Cathy Burton, Diane Grant, and George Wexford-Smyth III. In the second novel, Go Jump in the Pool, most of the rest of the recurring characters are introduced, along with all of their stereotypes. * Before Gordon Korman took into account that he actually potentially created a series, he had written an epilogue at the end, with Mr. Sturgeon stating his thoughts about Bruno and Boots after the events of this book, and with Bruno and Boots having graduated. This epilogue was deleted in later editions of the book. The epilogue contains the first appearance of the idea that Mr. Sturgeon's tuxedo was replaced with a judo suit (by Bruno and Boots) on Founder's Day. The idea surfaces in The Wizzle War when Sturgeon sympathetically tells an ailing Wizzle that the students had once replaced his tuxedo with a judo suit on Founder's Day. Retrieved on June 2, 2008.

Using the convention  After opener's one of a suit (X), partner's one of a suit response (Y) and opener's 1NT rebid (a very common sequence), 2 from opener's partner forces 2 from opener. Holding a weak hand with diamonds, one can now pass. Other bids are invitational, describing also the nature of the hand. A 2 response to 1NT, however, is game forcing with any hand. Responder may also jump to 3 of any suit (except 3, which is signoff) to show a slam-invitational hand with good suit(s).  Examples  For example, on the sequence 1-1 (with our without opponent's interfering);1NT-2;2,2 will show an invitational hand with minimum five spades and four hearts, 2 an invitational hand with minimum five spades (in which case one does not have four hearts) or possibly six spades with or without four hearts. 2NT will show a balanced invitational hand, 3 typically an unbalanced invitational hand with club support. However, when one instead forces game with 2, opener will immediately start describing his own hand. He may, on basis of the aforementioned auction, with 2 being the only difference, bid 2 holding four hearts, 2 holding three card spade support, etc. Further bids are primarily natural.  Advantages  XY Notrump gives very good control finding both games and slams, as the final \\"mission\\" of the sequence is established at a relatively early stage of bidding. Playing, as very common in combination with XY no trump, the Walsh convention or even Transfer Walsh, one still has the chance of stopping in 2 on weak hands, often impossible using for example Checkback Stayman.  Variations  A popular expanded version of XY Notrump is the so-called \\"XYZ\\" , meaning the principles of regular XY Notrump is valid even after one of a suit (X) - one of a suit (Y); one of a suit (or notrump) (Z) auction. It replaces such a method as Fourth suit forcing.

History The company's origins can be traced back to Melbourne's eastern suburbs and the iconic Croydon Stockyards (flea market) in 1970. On August 1st 1979, Mr and Mrs van Roest's first store to carry the name Copperart was opened on Canterbury Road, Blackburn, Victoria. This was followed soon after by another six stores. Initially the business sold copper and brassware from around the world, as well as Grandfather clocks and wall clocks. The name Copperart derives from the material the products were made from (Copper) and the name of the original founder Aart, 'Copper' and 'A(a)rt'. Copperart initially sold mostly copper and brass products, but the company expanded in the 1980s to include a broader range of homewares. 2001: rebranding Previous Homeart logo used from 2001 to 2010 By the year 2000, the product range in the Copperart stores had changed dramatically and bore little resemblance to original concept; the once famous copper and brass had virtually disappeared. In late 2001, Copperart changed its trading name to Homeart. It was felt that the \\"Copperart\\" name implied only a small range of copper and related products were stocked, when in fact the stores sold a wide range of products including manchester, clocks, electrical, homewares, dolls, furniture, sports & leisure and outdoor gear. 2010: logo update and changes In mid-2010, Homeart updated its logo replacing the large roof with a smaller, more subtle one, giving it a more modern look. The font and colour were also changed to a more modern style and distinctive \\"Homeart\\" orange.  2015: Closure  In January 2015 liquidators were appointed for the 116 Homeart stores, with the announcement made in March of that year that all stores would close, having failed to find a buyer for the business.  Advertising  Through its regular use of television advertising, Copperart became an iconic Australian company. Copperart used the well-known Pete Smith, best remembered for his voiceovers on Sale of the Century. The Don Lane Show and In Melbourne Tonight, in television commercials during the 1990s. In the 2000s large catalogue distributions were the companies preferred choice of advertising, and television commercials ceased. In late 2009, Homeart aired a television advertisement to promote its goods for the Christmas season. Pop culture Copperart was featured several times in the early 1990s on the sketch comedy show Fast Forward. The sketches were parodies of Copperart's television commercials with comedian Steve Vizard lampooning Pete Smith.

Arias was from a prominent Panamanian political family, whose members had reached the Presidency four times; amongst them his father Harmodio Arias. Early life Born in 1918, Arias was educated at Peddie School in Hightstown, New Jersey, United States, and at St John's College, Cambridge, England. From 1942 to 1946, he edited his family's newspaper, La Hora.Obituary, New York Times, 23 November 1989 Marriage to Fonteyn In 1955 Arias married English ballerina Margot Fonteyn, after divorcing his first wife, with whom he had three children. After his marriage Arias was appointed as Panama's ambassador to the United Kingdom. In 1959 he and Fonteyn were charged with attempted gun-smuggling from their yacht off the coast of Panama and he was accused of fomenting a revolt against President Ernesto de la Guardia Jr. She was immediately deported to England; Arias took refuge in the Brazilian Embassy for two months and was then given safe conduct out of the country. Eventually the charges were dropped and, after a governmental change, the couple were permitted to return to Panama. Documents released in March 2010 by the British government showed that they were both involved in the unsuccessful coup attempt. Politics In May 1964 Arias was elected to the National Assembly, his first venture into active politics. Two months later, he was shot in an argument with a friend and former political associate, Alberto Jim√©nez, on a street corner in a suburb of Panama City. It was widely rumored that the shooting was a result of an affair that Arias was having with Jimenez's wife.Review of Meredith Daneman's biography Margot Fonteyn, New York Times, 5 December 2004 Arias was treated for 18 months in British hospitals and spent the rest of his life as a quadriplegic, using a wheelchair. One of the reasons Fonteyn continued to dance so late in life was to pay Arias' enormous medical bills. Colette Clark, a close friend who worked with Fonteyn on Royal Academy of Dance galas, said: Personal life and death During Fonteyn's absence from Panama on tour as a ballerina, a socialite named Anabella Vallarino would move into the house as his shadow wife and move out again before Fonteyn's return. On the day of Arias' death on November 22, 1989, Vallarino committed suicide by swallowing a bottle of chlorine, and the two were buried on the same day. In addition to Fonteyn, Arias was survived by two daughters, Querube Brillembourg and Rosita Vallarino; a son, Roberto Arias; two brothers, Harmodio and Gilberto; a sister, Rosario de Galindo, and six grandchildren.

Early life and career He was born in Johannesburg, South Africa, and was Jewish. During the 1950s and 1960s, he was the doubles partner of Gordon Forbes. Together, they were considered one of the better doubles teams in the world. He was critical of South Africa's policy of apartheid. Alex Metreveli and Istv√°n Guly√°s both refused to compete in the 1964 Wimbledon against Segal, a white South African, because of apartheid. In response, black tennis player Arthur Ashe said he would play Segal any time because he did not think politics had a place in sports. Weeks later, Segal played Ashe in Illinois, beating him. This prompted the International Lawn Tennis Federation to pass a resolution prohibiting racial discrimination and withdrawing from a tournament except for \\"health or bereavement\\" reasons. In 1951, he won the singles title at the Irish Open, defeating Guy Jackson in the final in straight sets. He played for the South African Davis Cup team in 19 ties in the years 1955, 1957, 1959, and 1961 to 1965, and he compiled a record of 24 wins and 14 losses.

Initiated in 1991, it marked a strategic shift in India‚Äôs perspective of the world.Thongkholal Haokip, \\"India‚Äôs Look East Policy: Its Evolution and Approach,\\" South Asian Survey, Vol. 18, No. 2 (September 2011), pp. 239-257. It was developed and enacted during the government of Prime Minister Narsimha Rao (1991‚Äì1996) and rigorously pursued by the successive administrations of Atal Bihari Vajpayee (1998‚Äì2004) and Manmohan Singh (2004‚Äì2014). The success of Look East policy enthused the Mandarins of South- Block to develop the policy into more action oriented, project and outcome based policy.

China became the closest partner and supporter of the military junta of Burma, which had been ostracised from the international community following the violent suppression of pro-democracy activities in 1988.Sino-Myanmar Relations: Analysis and Prospects by Lixin Geng, The Culture Mandala, Vol. 7, no. 2, December 2006 In contrast, during the Cold War India had a relatively hesitant relationship with many states in Southeast Asia as such diplomatic relations were given relatively low priority. India's \\"Look East\\" policy was developed and enacted during the governments of prime ministers P.V. Narasimha Rao (1991‚Äì1996) and Atal Bihari Vajpayee (1998‚Äì2004). Along with economic liberalisation and moving away from Cold War-era policies and activities, India's strategy has focused on forging close economic and commercial ties, increasing strategic and security cooperation and the emphasis of historic cultural and ideological links. India sought to create and expand regional markets for trade, investments and industrial development. It also began strategic and military cooperation with nations concerned by the expansion of China's economic and strategic influence.  Actions  Relations with East Asia Although it had traditionally supported Burma's pro-democracy movement for many years, India's policy changed in 1993, making friendly overtures to the military junta. India signed trade agreements and increased its investments in Burma; although private sector activity remains low, India's state corporations have landed lucrative contracts for industrial projects and the construction of major roads and highways, pipelines and upgrading of ports. India has also increased its competition with China over the harnessing of Burma's significant oil and natural gas reserves, seeking to establish a major and stable source of energy for its growing domestic needs, countering Chinese monopoly over Burmese resources and reducing dependence on oil-rich Middle Eastern nations. Although China remains Burma's largest military supplier, India has offered to train Burma's military personnel and has sought their cooperation in curbing separatist militants and the heavy drug trafficking affecting much of Northeast India. Meanwhile China has won contracts harnessing more than 2.88‚Äì3.56 trillion cubits of natural gas in the A-1 Shwe field in the Rakhine State and has developed naval and surveillance installations along Burma's coast and the Coco Islands. This has provoked great concern and anxiety in India, which has stepped up its investment in port development, energy, transport and military sectors.India and China compete for Burma's resources India has also established strong commercial, cultural and military ties with the Philippines, Singapore, Vietnam and Cambodia. India signed free trade agreements with Sri Lanka and Thailand and stepped up its military cooperation with them as well. It has numerous free trade agreements with East Asian economies, including a Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement with Singapore and an Early Harvest Scheme with Thailand, while it is negotiating agreements with Japan, South Korea, and Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) member states. Ties have been strengthened with Taiwan, Japan and South Korea over common emphasis on democracy, human rights and strategic interests. South Korea and Japan remain amongst the major sources of foreign investment in India.Walter C. Ladwig III, \\"Delhi‚Äôs Pacific Ambition: Naval Power, ‚ÄòLook East,‚Äô and India‚Äôs Emerging Role in the Asia-Pacific,\\" Asian Security, Vol. 5, No. 2 (June 2009), pp. 98‚Äì101 While India has remained a staunch supporter of the \\"One China\\" policy and recognised the sovereignty of the People's Republic of China on the mainland over the Republic of China authorities on Taiwan, India has nevertheless pursued a policy of increasing engagement with Taiwan. India has stepped up engagement with East Asia fueled by its need for cooperation on counter- terrorism, humanitarian relief, anti-piracy, maritime and energy security, confidence-building and balancing the influence of other powers, notably China. Driven by the fact that more than 50% of India's trade passes through the Malacca Strait, the Indian navy has established a Far Eastern Naval Command off Port Blair on the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. India has also been conducting joint naval exercises with Singapore (SIMBEX) since 1993, with Vietnam in 2000 and has engaged in joint patrols with Indonesia in the Andaman Sea since 2002. Japan and India were also members of the tsunami relief regional core group in the Indian Ocean in 2004 along with Australia and the United States. Relations with China While India and China remain strategic rivals, India's \\"Look East\\" policy has included significant rapprochement with China. In 1993, India began holding high-level talks with Chinese leaders and established confidence-building measures. In 2006, China and India opened the Nathu La pass for cross-border trade for the first time since the 1962 war.\\"India-China trade link to reopen\\", BBC News, 19 June 2006. Retrieved 31 January 2007. On 21 November 2006 Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and the Chinese President Hu Jintao issued a 10-point joint declaration to improve ties and resolve long-standing conflicts.India-China relations: Ten-pronged strategy Trade between China and India increases by 50% each year, and is set to reach the $60 billion target set for 2010 by both Indian and Chinese governments and industrial leaders.India, China to meet trade target by 2010 However, China's close relations with Pakistan, skepticism about India's integration of Sikkim, and Chinese claim over Arunachal Pradesh have threatened the improvement in bilateral relations.India and China row over border India is currently providing asylum to the political-spiritual leader, the 14th Dalai Lama also causes some friction in bilateral ties.In China, Pranab to take up the stress in ties Chinese commentators have been critical of India's Look East policy. A People's Daily editorial opined that the Look East policy was \\"born out of [the] failure\\" of India's trying to play the Soviet Union and the United States against each other for its own benefit during the Cold War, and that trying to do the same with China and Japan by strengthening its ties with the latter would also fail. A columnist at the China Internet Information Center criticized the Look East policy as being borne out of a misguided \\"fear of China\\" and as reflecting \\"a lack of understanding of the PLA's strategic ambitions\\". Participation in supranational organisations India has developed multilateral organisations such as, the Mekong-Ganga Cooperation and BIMSTEC, forging extensive cooperation on environmental, economic development, security and strategic affairs, permitting the growth of influence beyond South Asia and without the tense and obstructive presence of Pakistan and China that has stalled its efforts in the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation. India became a sectoral dialogue partner with ASEAN in 1992, in 1995 was given an advisory status, a member of the Council for Security Cooperation in the Asia-Pacific, a member of the ASEAN Regional Forum in 1996, and a summit level partner (on par with China, Japan and Korea) in 2002 and World cup 2002. The first India- ASEAN Business Summit was held in New Delhi in 2002. India also acceded to ASEAN's Treaty of Amity and Cooperation in Southeast Asia in 2003. In many cases, India's membership to these forums has been a result of attempts by the region to balance China's growing influence in the area. Notably, Japan brought India into ASEAN+6 to dilute the ASEAN+3 process, where China is dominant, while Singapore and Indonesia played a significant role in bringing India into the East Asia Summit. The United States and Japan have also lobbied for India's membership in the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC). Numerous infrastructure projects also serve to tie India closer to East Asia. India is participating in the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific and the Pacific initiatives for an Asian Highway Network and the Trans-Asian Railway network. Discussions are also proceeding on reopening the World War II-era Stilwell Road linking India's Assam state with China's Yunnan province through Myanmar. Assessment According to Rejaul Karim Laskar, a scholar of Indian foreign policy, the 'Look East' policy has strengthened India's political, economic and cultural relations with the countries of Southeast Asia and the Pacific and has ensured that India becomes an important part of the emerging economic and security architecture of the region. Commerce with South and East Asian nations accounts for almost 45% of India's foreign trade. Although its efforts have met with considerable success, India trails China in the volume of trade and economic ties it enjoys with the nations of the region. Act East policy The Modi administration stated that India would focus more and more on improving relation with ASEAN and other East Asian countries as per India's Look East Policy which was formulated during Narasimha Rao's government in 1991 for better economic engagement with its eastern neighbours, but the following government successfully turned it into a tool for forging strategic partnership and security cooperation with countries in that region in general and Vietnam and Japan in particular. In her visit to Hanoi, Sushma Swaraj has stressed the need for an Act East Policy, which she said should replace India's over two decade-old Look East Policy emphasizing a more proactive role for India in this region.

He intended to ride his bike across the Great Sandy Desert to Fitzroy Crossing. Whilst police called off the initial search for Bogucki after 12 days, family members hired specialist trackers to continue the search and soon found fresh evidence that Bogucki had survived at least that long.  Found  Bogucki was found by a Channel Nine news helicopter on 23 August 1999 in Western Australia's Edgar Ranges, away from where he set off. Bogucki's subsequent treatment by the Channel Nine crew raised questions as to the extent to which they had ignored his well-being in order to secure an exclusive news story. With there only being four seats in the helicopter, West Australian photographer Robert Duncan was left behind with a bottle of water and an EPIRB. After going without food for about six weeks and water for twelve days, Bogucki had lost during the ordeal. He found water by digging and straining mud, but also drank from stagnant pools. Later he took to eating flowers and plants. Medical staff at Broome Hospital said his physical condition was \\"remarkable\\".

The Dynamics of Complex Urban Systems, p.222. Springer. . Quadratic Koch island/Minkowski fractal A teragon is a polygon with an infinite number of sides, the most famous example being the Koch snowflake (\\"triadic Koch teragon\\"). Typically, a teragon will be bounded by one or more self-similar fractal curves, which are created by replacing each line segment in an initial figure with multiple connected segments, then replacing each of those segments with the same pattern of segments, then repeating the process an infinite number of times for every line segment in the figure. Etymology The word \\"teragon\\" comes from Greek (teras), \\"monster, marvel\\", + Œ≥œâŒΩŒØŒ± (g≈çn√≠a) \\"corner, angle\\" (as in poly-gon). By the standards of classical geometry, a teragon like the Koch snowflake was a marvelous or monstrous object requiring new techniques to understand and analyze. Other examples The horned triangle, created by erecting a series of smaller triangles on one corner of an equilateral triangle, is another example of a teragon. It is also an example of a rep-tile, or shape that can be completely dissected into smaller copies of itself. References Further reading * Mandelbrot, B. B. (1982). The Fractal Geometry of Nature.

Original plans for the fort were prepared by Lieutenant H. G. Wright. These plans called for the fortress to be a trapeziform stronghold surrounded by a wet ditch and by outworks on the land side. The walls were constructed of cemented shell, faced with brick, and trimmed with granite. with three photos With . Fort Livingston is one of the largest coastal forts in Louisiana, and is the only fort on the Gulf of Mexico in the state. It is a classic example of American coastal forts of the first half of the 19th century. Today it is in ruins. History The second Barataria Bay Lighthouse adjacent to Fort Livingston, shown here, was completed in 1903. In the early 19th century, Grand Terre Island was the home to pirates under the command of Captain Jean Lafitte. These pirates were forced to leave the island in 1814 so the U.S. government could build a coastal defense fort. This fort was also designed to control the entrance to Barataria Pass, and thereby guard New Orleans against naval attacks from the south of the city. The U.S. Government bought a tract of land, where the fort now stands, from Etienne De Gruy on the west end of Grand Terre Island. Construction at the site began in 1834, but was suspended in July 1834. Construction resumed in 1840, and construction on the fort itself began in 1841http://www.friendsofgrandisle.com/historyof- grand-isler.html under the direction of Major P.G.T. Beauregard.

In 1979, the Louisiana state legislature created the Fort Livingston State Commemorative Area. The remains of the fort are somewhat of a tourist attraction, although it is only accessible by boat and is closely monitored by the U.S. Coast Guard. The fort is located directly east across Barataria Bay from the Coast Guard Station on Grand Isle, Louisiana. Grand Terre Island is also currently home to the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries' Marine Laboratory. The fort itself is also part of a wave-protection project being conducted by the Louisiana Department of Natural Resources. The project consists of a rock dike built to conserve the Gulf shoreline of West Grand Terre Island and protect Fort Livingston. As a result of tropical storm systems in 2002, the erosion rates along West Grand Terre Island greatly accelerated, requiring some type of protective barrier to be built.FTL-01 Fisheries Habitat Restoration on West Grand Terre Island at Fort Livingston See also * National Register of Historic Places listings in Jefferson Parish, Louisiana References External links * Fort Livingston Photos, April 2002 * Fort Livingston Oil Impact study June 2010 Livingston Livingston Category:Buildings and structures in Jefferson Parish, Louisiana Category:Protected areas of Jefferson Parish, Louisiana Livingston Category:National Register of Historic Places in Jefferson Parish, Louisiana ","title":"Fort Livingston, Louisiana"},{"id":"17677748","text":"Penthouse TV is a Canadian English language Category B specialty channel that broadcasts adult entertainment material, primarily in the form of pornographic films.

The most recent billboard was put up in St. George, Utah.7th billboard in St. George, Utah, at PostMormon.org Criticisms of the PostMormon Community Critics of the PostMormon Community frequently argue that it is an anti-Mormon organization whose purpose is to tear down the faith of active members of the church.Deseret News ‚Äì Letter to the editor Latter-day Saints are taught that speaking ill of the church or its leaders is sinful, and some members could view many discussions on the PostMormon.org message board as disrespectful of LDS Church beliefs, doctrines, leaders, and culture. Faithful members have tacitly argued that such activities speak to the truthfulness of their beliefs, describing former members with the couplet \\"they can leave the church, but they can't leave the church alone.\\" The PostMormon Community response to these allegations has been that they are engineered to dissuade active Mormons from further investigation. Aaron M. Anderson's article \\"Strengthening Against Apostasy\\" mentions that debating doctrine is a door to apostasy; thus preventing any meaningful discussion of Mormon doctrine. Charles L. Wood has suggested that the inability to meaningfully discuss doctrine within the LDS Church has acted as a form of \\"mind-control\\". Non- Mormon historians have often encountered similar labels, such as \\"anti- Mormon\\", for their discussion of church history \\"in so far as they reject that truth.\\" \\"That truth\\" being that the LDS church is God's one true church on the face of the earth. This is no surprise, considering the following by Mormon Apostle Boyd K. Packer: \\"there is no such thing as an accurate or objective history of the Church which ignores the Spirit.... Church history can be so interesting and so inspiring as to be a very powerful tool indeed for building faith. If not properly written or properly taught, it may be a faith destroyer...\\". The Postmormon community does not actually cause members to formally resign or even to stop attending. The website's discussion board is limited to indirectly attacking the LDS church written by people still attending. As a result, the Postmormon community's slogan \\"You are not alone.\\" has been criticized for intimidating those who have turned in their resignation and severed all ties with any Mormons to believe they are indeed alone. Salt Lake City Arguably the largest public ex-Mormon group in Salt Lake City, the SLC PostMormons do a wide range of events from debating whether there is a god between an ex-Mormon and Mormon, having a panel of Mormons and ex-Mormons discussing the challenges when someone leaves the LDS faith, to support meetings and lectures on LDS history.

She is a nine-time winner of the British Women's Chess Championship and the current continuous British women's champion since 2015. Formative years Born in south London, her family name stems from her grandfather who was part Czech. Her first name is typically Slavic, but was chosen only to complement the family name. Chess is a popular sport in the Houska family, and she owes much of her progress to the sibling rivalry that developed with elder brother Miroslav, himself an International Master of chess, though currently inactive. She now lives on the capital's north side and has a degree in Law. One of England's most active professionals, she first represented her country at the World Youth Championship for Girls (under 10) in Timi»ôoara 1988, finishing fifth after a disastrous start and despite being years younger than most of her opponents. She competed in the same event at Aguadilla in 1989 and then, for a third time at Fond du Lac in 1990, where she won the bronze medal. There were many more successes over the next few years including another bronze medal at the European Junior Championship for girls (under 20) at Erevan in 1998. As a consequence, she was awarded the Woman International Master (WIM) title the same year, after securing all three norms in just over a month. Her first WGM norm was achieved at the 1999 British Championship when she was still a teenager. European success Then, at Avil√©s in 2000, her previous efforts were eclipsed by a return visit to the European Junior Championship‚Äîcapturing the gold winner's medal, ahead of Viktorija ƒåmilytƒó. It was a milestone victory, as it also provided a final qualification norm for the WGM title. The following year saw her take the Women's Commonwealth Championship, held in London in conjunction with the Mind Sports Olympiad. She defeated GM Dibyendu Barua in the process and gained a first IM norm. Team events Despite her time-consuming academic studies, the next few years were notable for Houska's unstinting contribution to the England Women's team at various major competitions around the world. She participated at each of the Chess Olympiads between 1998 and 2008 and aside from her first appearance as a reserve, has played consistently on high boards, scoring in excess of 50% on each occasion. From 1999 onwards, she has also been an ever-present at the European Team Chess Championships. The team's most notable performance in this event, occurred at Leon in 2001, where a third-place finish produced a team bronze medal. An active league chess player, she has represented SK Hofheim in the German Bundesliga, Deauville in France, and Wood Green in the 4NCL. Further progress IM Houska at Liverpool's EU Championships, 2008 Following yet more successful norm-seeking, she became the third British woman to be awarded the IM title in 2005. Voted English Chess Federation Player of the Year in 2006, she was the first female to receive the accolade since its inception in 1984. There were 'highest placed Woman' prizes at the Hastings International Chess Congress 2006/7 and at Gibraltar 2007. She also came close to winning the first MonRoi Women's Grand Prix, finally finishing second equal behind Pia Cramling. Her task was much more difficult at the fifth Howard Staunton Memorial Tournament, held at Simpsons-in-the-Strand, where she faced some of the world's top grandmasters and finished in last place. At Liverpool in 2008, she became British and English Women's Champion for the first time, finishing a full point ahead of closest rival Susan Lalic and a half point ahead of grandmasters Glenn Flear and Stewart Haslinger. Her second Liverpool visit resulted in a third share of the women's best performance prize (jointly with Ketevan Arakhamia-Grant and Yelena Dembo) at the EU Individual Open Chess Championship. Houska successfully defended her British Championship title at the 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012 events. By July 2010, her sustained good form had elevated her to an Elo rating of 2433, making her England's second ranked woman player (behind Harriet Hunt) and number fifty-one in the world among active female players. Further British Championship victories were achieved in 2016, 2017 and 2018. As a chess writer, she has reported on tournaments home and abroad for periodicals such as CHESS magazine. Houska completed her first chess opening book in 2007. Written for Everyman Chess, it features a treatise on Houska's opening of choice with the Black pieces‚Äîthe Caro-Kann Defence. A second book, covering the Scandinavian Defence, was published in 2009 and there followed a collaboration on 2010s Dangerous Weapons: The Caro-Kann, with fellow English masters John Emms and Richard Palliser.

Early activism  \\"Zevs Cosmos\\" appeared at Iowa State University around 1982, often preaching on central campus, sometimes drawing crowds away from \\"Brother Jed Smock\\", another traveling evangelistic preacher who also made regular appearances on campus. During this time, Cosmos would often be seen teaching his ideas about nudism on street corners in Ames, Iowa City, and Des Moines, Iowa.Rachel Lawrence, \\"Bearded 'Bishop' Praises Nudist Life\\", Omaha World-Herald, 1984-11-24. He referred to himself as the \\"founder and bishop\\" of the Nudist Christian Church of the Blessed Virgin Jesus. By the end of 1984, he claimed to have attracted 50 followers in Ames.  Nudist Christian Church of the Blessed Virgin Jesus   Early events  Cosmos was referring to himself as the bishop of the NCCBVJ as early as November 1984. In 1985, Cosmos said that God commanded him to travel to the Utah‚ÄìArizona border; while in this area, Cosmos says that God and an angel named Ephygeneia appeared to him naked and told him to go to a cave on a nearby ridge. While in the cave, God and the angel appeared again and gave Cosmos a revelation, which Cosmos recorded and named the Book of Zevs (also found as the Book of Zeus). The NCCBVJ teaches that the Book of Zevs is scripture that adds to and complements the Bible.  Teachings  = Book of Zevs = The Book of Zevs instructs Cosmos to build a nudist community city called \\"Cosmos\\", which was to be situated northwest of the Grand Canyon. The book also condemns Mormon fundamentalists near the Utah‚ÄìArizona border for their practice of plural marriage and their belief in the inferiority of black people. = Other teachings = The NCCBVJ teaches that nudity is a foundational state of being for leading a good life. It teaches that problems with sexuality, body image, pornography, and crime would all be solved if society would adopt a nudist lifestyle. Cosmos and the church have also led protests against female genital mutilation and male circumcision, which are viewed as equally undesirable.  Legal incidents  In January 1985, Cosmos was investigated by the American Immigration and Naturalization Service authorities after complaints were made of Cosmos's preaching and sale of pro- nudity bumper stickers and T-shirts on street corners in Ames, Iowa. When it was discovered that Cosmos had exceeded the 6-month stay permitted by his visitor's visa, he was ordered deported to Canada. His appeal to a federal immigration judge was rejected and he was flown to Winnipeg, Manitoba.David Thompson, \\"Canadian's Immigration Petition Denied: Nudist Church Founder Packs His Bags\\", Omaha World-Herald, 1985-01-31. On 31 October 1985 Cosmos was stopped by police as he was placing flyers on car windshields near Drake University in Des Moines. The police told him that a city ordinance forbade the distribution of literature in this manner. In December 1985, the Iowa Civil Liberties Union filed suit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Iowa on behalf of Cosmos, arguing that the ordinance unreasonably limited Cosmos's right to freedom of speech.\\"Nudist Church Chief Backed in Rights Suit\\", Omaha World-Herald, 1985-12-13. In August 2002, police in Washington, D.C. alleged that Cosmos had vandalized the National Mall and President's Park with swastikas and Nazi SS symbols during the American Independence Day weekend in 1999.H.J.

Bartolomeu Cid dos Santos was born in Lisbon, Portugal, in 1931. He studied at the Escola Superior de Belas Artes, a Portuguese school for fine arts, from 1950 until 1956. Santos furthered his art training at the Slade School of Fine Art in London, the United Kingdom, from 1956 until 1958. He studied under Anthony Gross while attending The Slade School of Fine Art, UCL. Santos held his first personal, public art exhibition at the Sociedade Nacional de Belas Artes in Lisbon in 1959. Ultimately, Santos would hold 82 separate art exhibitions during his career. Santos began teaching fine arts at the Slade School of Fine Art following the completion of his studies. He remained as a faculty member in Slade's Department of Engraving from 1961 until his retirement from the school in 1996. He also lectured and taught at art schools and colleges throughout Great Britain as a visiting artist. Santos also taught extensively as a visiting professor outside of Portugal and the United Kingdom. He taught at the University of Wisconsin in Madison, Wisconsin, in 1969 and again in 1980 as a visiting professor. Santos also taught at the Konstkollan Umea in Sweden in 1977 and 1978 and the National College of Arts in Lahore, Pakistan, in 1986 and 1987. He also taught at the Academia de Artes Visuais in Macau on numerous occasions. Bartolomeu Cid dos Santos' work can be found in private and public art collections worldwide. Examples of his work can be found on public display in the Entrecampos Metro Station in the city of Lisbon. Bartolomeu Cid dos Santos died in London on 21 May 2008, at the age of 77. He had been ill for some time, according to his friend, Portuguese writer, Luis Amorim de Sousa. For his last show he invited friend and colleague John Aiken to commission the exhibit in the Casa das Artes, Tavira in August 2008.

His birth and death years are unknown, but he was active circa 490‚Äì540. He was from Wu Commandery (around present-day Suzhou, Jiangsu). Background and reputation Zhang was a member of Zhang clan of Wu, one of the four prominent clans in Wu Commandery. According to Tang dynasty art critic Zhang Yanyuan's \\"Notes of Past Famous Paintings\\", Zhang served as an official during the reign of Emperor Wu of Liang. He was the director of the imperial library and was also in charge of any painting related affairs in the court of Emperor Wu. Later, Zhang served the country as the general of right flank army and the governor of Wuxing Commandery. His works were rated the finest quality by Zhang Yanyuan. He also listed Zhang's artistic style as one of the four \\"Standards\\" of the traditional Chinese paintings; the other three artists were Gu Kaizhi, Lu Tanwei and Wu Daozi. Yao Zui, an art critic in Chen Dynasty, described Zhang as a diligent painter who paints \\"without the notion of day and night\\". Zhang was especially skillful in depicting human or animal figures. According to the History of the Southern Dynasties, Zhang painted a portrait for Prince Wuling, one of the sons of Emperor Wu of Liang. After viewing his son's portrait, the Emperor was amazed by the verisimilitude of Zhang's painting. Buddhism with all its iconography, came to China from India, bringing with it to China a Western influence at one remove. Pictorial forms thus acquired a certain three-dimensional quality. Zhang Sengyou, working in the early sixth century, painted large murals of Buddhist shrines in Nanjing. He was one of the first to use these influences with happy results. He was also well known for landscapes, especially snow scenery, with a reputation for the so-called \\"boneless\\" technique (mogu). Zhang is also associated with a famous story. It is said that one day, having painted four dragons on the walls of Anle temple in Jinling, he did not mark the pupil, not by negligence but prudence. However, one person, unwilling to heed Zhang's warnings, painted in the eyes of two dragons, causing the dragons to immediately flee to heaven riding on clouds with crashing thunder. Marking the eyes of dragons opens their eyes and gives them life. The spirit is fleeting, omnipresent, so that grasping and fixing it in a painting gives his work an uncanny power of suggestion. This story, summarized in the chengyu (), is used in modern Chinese as a metaphor to describe a written work or speech that lacks only a small element which would make it perfect.

Ruston-Bucyrus 10-RB in the United Kingdom. Ruston-Bucyrus Ltd was an engineering company established in 1930 and jointly owned by Ruston and Hornsby based in Lincoln, England and Bucyrus-Erie based in South Milwaukee, Wisconsin, the latter of which had operational controlThe Amazing Story of Excavators:Volume 1. Peter N Grimshaw and into which the excavator manufacturing operation of Ruston and Hornsby was transferred. The Bucyrus company proper, from which the Bucyrus component of the Ruston-Bucyrus name was created, was an American company founded in 1880, in Bucyrus, Ohio. During the Second World War, the company developed a trench cutting machine known by the code name Cultivator No. 6 at the behest of Winston Churchill.Turner, 1988. p. 45. A limited company, Ruston-Bucyrus Ltd., was formed in 2005, by Paul and Frank Murray (Brothers) as Co-Directors. This has no ties to RB Cranes which holds all of the original machine information & drawings Ruston-Bucyrus Ltd era Gradually Universal Excavators designed by Bucyrus- Erie replaced Ruston and Hornsby designed models.[1] The original range of standardised rope-operated machines included 10RB, 17RB, 19RB and 33RB and were upgraded through some intermediate models including the 54RB to a main selling range in the 1960s of 22RB, 30RB, 38RB, 61RB and 71RB. In addition, there were the large machines including the 110RB which evolved into the 150RB. The 22RB was the most popular machine which was assembled on a production line basis. The machine concept was a standard base to each model on which optional front-end equipment could be mounted with appropriate counterbalances, crawler track frames and minimal additional machinery. The most common variants included face shovel, dragline, lifting crane and grabbing crane. Less common variants included drag shovel, skimmer and pile driver. Some cranes were also lorry-mounted. All machines had 360 degree rotation on a conical section roller path. The machines were operated initially by a system of levers which operated toggle clutches into the drumshafts. Despite the significant power being transmitted, the lever system was, if set up correctly, relatively easy for the operator to use. The main control functions were later superseded by pneumatic control. Most machines were fitted with diesel engines. The 22RB, typically, used a 6YDA Ruston and Hornsby engine. Electric motor options were available and often used on the large machines. The model size, an elusively defined number, was possibly the standard face shovel capacity in cubic feet. All the above machines were mounted on crawler tracks. The company also manufactured walking draglines, which were very large capacity machines, model 5W the most common, with the upper machinery deck (on all excavators known as the revolving frame) mounted upon a circular tub with motion provided by overhanging cams with paddle feet which, when rotated, lifted the entire machine and produced individual steps of forward motion, a waddling action somewhat like a duck as the end of the boom would raise and lower. Because of the size and weight, walking draglines were transported to the worksite in sections and assembled there. These large machines were used for removal of overburden on, for example, opencast coal sites. In the late 1960s, the Company designed a range of 360 degree hydraulic backactors (15H, 20H and 30H) which were popular in the Far East and extended the life of the company. In the early days of RB, they also produced a few other products including a range of lorry-mounted drilling rigs, primarily used for water bore holes. They also produced a design for a self-erecting tower crane in an era when tower cranes were rare. In the 1960s, there used to be a bridge over the High Street in Lincoln stating that Ruston Bucyrus was the largest Excavator manufacturer in the World. The factory ran the length of Beevor Street, about 900m, apart from a short piece on the north side where a drivebelt manufacturing business was based. The grounds were up to 400m wide. There were more than 30 bays in the factory, most of which were about 150m long, nearly all fitted with overhead cranes. At the far end of the Works, there was an extra-large bay for assembly of the large machines including the 150RB and walking draglines. Beyond that was the testing area where cranes were taken for calibration. The company employed up to 2000 persons on the site with manufacturing on both day and night shifts. With exception of foundry work, virtually all manufacturing processes were completed on site. The machine shops used, for the period, the latest in technology including tape-programming and high-speed tipped tooling. There were eight service depots around the UK and a team of service engineers operated from the Lincoln Works to service international customers. Ruston Bucyrus cranes and excavators had been exported to most parts of the World. The period of the smaller quarry excavator was lost when quarrying turned to more substantial blasting and the use of wheeled loaders. The R-B International era In 1985 Ruston Bucyrus was bought by its management, severing all links with Bucyrus-Erie resulting in the formation of 'R-B Lincoln', which became R-B International, a subsidiary of Lincoln Industries (part of The Heather Corporation Ltd). Production of existing Ruston-Bucyrus designed cable excavator/crane models from the 22RB to the 71RB continued at the Lincoln factory with 'Improved Crane Dragline' versions also offered. From 1985 onwards all new machines carried the 'RB' name instead of 'Ruston-Bucyrus' and in 1987 a new mechanical/hydraulic powered 51‚Äì60 model developed from the 38-RB was offered for use as a crane or dragline excavator In 1990 RB bought from its rival Priestman, the design and manufacturing rights to Priestman's Variable Counterbalance hydraulic/cable long reach excavator range and its extensive range of Grabs. In 1992 RB introduced its CH series of fully hydraulic crane/dragline models with further models added in 1999.

Davis, former president of Favelle Favco R-B International was sold to Langley Holdings plc as a going-concern on 22 December 2000 and a new company 'RB Cranes Ltd' was created. A day earlier on 21 December 2000, Langley Holdings plc had acquired the material-handling division of Rolls- Royce PLC which became the Clarke Chapman Group comprising Cowans Sheldon, RB Cranes, Stothert & Pitt, Wellman Booth as its principal subsidiary companies. In January 2001 Clarke Chapman ceased production at RB's Lincoln works with production transferred to facilities in Retford and Gainsborough. Following a rationalisation of the RB product line, as of 2008 RB continue to offer the CH40,CH50,CH70,CH80, CH100,CH135 and CH135LJ Hydraulic Crawler Cranes as well as specialist variants for Dockside usagehttp://www.clarkechapman.co.uk/site/9/Dockside-Mobile- Cranes.asp?nav_id=748 RB also offer the CH E (Series CH50E & CH70E) for dragline and clamshell grab applicationshttp://www.clarkechapman.co.uk/site/9/Dragline/Clamshell- Cranes.asp?nav_id=749 and the CH HD (Heavy Duty) (Series CH50D & CH70D) for adaption for piling and foundation engineering applications e.g. as a piling rig.

After a 1 opening bid, responses of 1 and 1 show heart and spade suits respectively. The \\"Walsh\\" terminology refers to the fact that these bids may conceal an equal or longer diamond suit. It allows opener to play a greater proportion of major- suit and no-trump contracts, particularly when using five-card majors.  Using Transfer Walsh  Transfer Walsh is used responding to partner's 1 opening bid.A short introduction by Micha Keijzers The main responses are as follows: * 1: Shows at least four hearts * 1: Shows at least four spades * 1: Shows at least four, alternatively five diamonds * 1NT: Shows 6-9 HCP and a balanced hand without a four-card major A variation is to have 1 show either diamonds or 6-9 HCP balanced, with the 1NT response showing 10-11 HCP balanced. The term Transfer Walsh is commonly used, although responder's one level bids are not forcing a completed transfer from opener. In fact, over the 1 and 1 responses, opener will only accept the transfer holding minimum three- card support, otherwise bidding naturally. With four-card support, it is normal to accept the transfer at the 1-level holding a minimum hand and making a jump response (for example 2 after a 1 response) with a maximum (or higher with very strong hands). With three-card support the transfer is always completed at the 1-level, with less than three-card support another natural response is given. After 1-1, however, the transfer is only completed with four-card diamond support. Further bidding is essentially natural. The method is usually combined with the Walsh convention, where responder always shows a four-card major suit, even with a four- or five-card diamond holding, unless responder is strong enough for a reverse bid later in the auction (12 HCP or more). A common variation is to have opener complete the transfer with 12-14 HCP balanced, even with only doubleton support for the major suit. Responder will pass with 5 cards if weak but rebid (perhaps 1NT) with only 4. This allows the 5-2 fit to be played in the better major contract. Opener will only break the transfer with a strong hand, such as 17+ if playing a 14-16 NT. Another variation is to play that a response of 1 is a transfer to 1NT, and can be made with any strength. Not only does this right-side a NT contract, but it allows responder to rebid at the 2 level to show an invitational hand. 2 is Stayman to find a major fit, and 2 of any other suit shows 5 cards. This allows a game invitation to be declined and played in 2 of the major, a safer contract than the normal 3 level. Playing this way, if responder makes the initial transfer to the major and rebids it, it shows a 6 card suit. This enables the major length to be shown exactly, whether 4, 5 or 6, as well as showing the strength as weak, invitational, or game forcing. The now free 1NT response can then be used to show a weak hand with both 4 card majors, or alternatively to show diamonds.  Examples of use  If the auction goes 1-1; 1NT, opener has denied three-card spade support, and responder needs not worry about missing a 5-3 fit in spades. If the auction goes 1-1;1-1;2, opener has given a relatively precise picture of his hand: By accepting the transfer bidding 1, he has shown three-card (rarely four-card) heart support, by bidding 2 four-card spade support (and a minimum opening), and by opening 1 (in a natural system) at least three clubs.  Advantages of using Transfer Walsh  Transfer Walsh in a very early stage of bidding determines the possibility of a fit, giving good control of further game and slam bidding. Likewise, one has the chance of stopping at an early stage, especially using the XY Notrump Convention. It becomes significantly easier to find 3-5 major suit fits (and in some variants 2-5 fits). Opener (usually the stronger hand) becomes declarer in most major suit and NT contracts.

It was released in 1977 on Columbia. Background By 1977, the outlaw country movement was nearing its apex, having seen the release of Wanted! The Outlaws, country music's first platinum selling album, and Willie Nelson‚Äôs blockbuster LP Red Headed Stranger. Artists like Nelson and Waylon Jennings eschewed Nashville's strict studio regime and fought to record their own music their way, producing albums featuring music that brought a new realism previously unheard to country music. These albums often included compositions by groundbreaking songwriters such as Kris Kristofferson, Mickey Newbury, and Billy Joe Shaver, among others. David Allan Coe was part of this movement, having written ‚ÄúWould You Lay with Me (In a Field of Stone),‚Äù which became Tanya Tucker‚Äôs third #1 country single in 1974, and having scored the Top Ten hit ‚ÄúYou Never Even Called Me by My Name‚Äù in 1975. After recording two albums that went nowhere, Coe signed with Columbia and released The Mysterious Rhinestone Cowboy in 1974, his major label debut. Although capable of writing deeply tender love songs, Coe's outrageous appearance, defiant attitude, and controversial background kept him from being fully embraced by the mainstream in the same way some of his peers would be. By 1977, Coe considered himself as integral as anyone in the evolution of the outlaw country genre, and began saying so in his music. As noted in Thom Jurek's AllMusic review of the album, ‚ÄúOn Rides Again, by trying to make a conscious outlaw record and aligning himself with the movement's two progenitors on the opening track, 'Willie, Waylon, and Me'... Coe already set up self-parody unintentionally - something that continued to curse him.‚Äù Recording Rides Again was the fourth album Coe recorded for Columbia produced by Ron Bledsoe. The songs crossfade without the usual silences between tracks, which was unusual for country music, and feature Coe's heavily phased guitar. Coe was also permitted to use his own band on several tracks, a major concession for Columbia at the time. The album opens with the title track, a barrelling outlaw country anthem that celebrates the musical vision and individuality of several rock acts such as The Flying Burrito Brothers, The Byrds, and The Eagles, but then proclaims, ‚ÄúIn Texas the talk turned to outlaws like Waylon, Willie, and me.‚Äù As recounted in Michael Streissguth's book Outlaw: Waylon, Willie, Kris, and the Renegades of Nashville, some of his peers resented Coe placing himself in such exalted company, and felt he was exploiting his relationship with his fellow outlaws. Jennings drummer Richie Albright called Coe ‚Äúa great, great songwriter. A great singer. But he could not tell the truth if it was better than a lie he'd made up. Waylon didn't make him comfortable enough to hang around.‚Äù Jennings actually played guitar on ‚ÄúWillie, Waylon and Me‚Äù but, according to Albright, ‚Äúwalked out of there and said, ‚ÄòShit, I don't know why I did that.‚Äô‚Äù Coe's integrity was also called into question after his previous claim that he'd spent time on death row for killing an inmate who tried to rape him was debunked when a Texas documentarian discovered Coe had done time for possessing burglary tools and indecent materials, never murder. Criticisms such as these notwithstanding, Coe always maintained he was integral to the movement getting its name, explaining in 2003: Regardless of the galling impression he made on some of his peers, no one could deny Coe's ability to write stellar country songs and sing them with stunning conviction, as is evident on ‚ÄúGreener Than the Grass We Laid On‚Äù and the cheating honky tonk ballad ‚ÄúUnder Rachel's Wings,\\" while ‚ÄúLately I‚Äôve Been Thinking Too Much Lately‚Äù and Donnie Murphy's ‚ÄúLaid Back and Wasted‚Äù chronicle hardcore alcohol and drug abuse in the face of crushing failure and lost love. But Coe also remained uncompromising when it came to his lifestyle and language, even though it kept him off country playlists and award shows. ‚ÄúThe House We‚Äôve Been Calling Home,‚Äù for example, explores the theme of polygamy (‚ÄúMe and my wives have been spending our lives in a house we‚Äôve been calling a home...\\"), while the final cut on the album, ‚ÄúIf That Ain‚Äôt Country (You Can Kick My Ass),‚Äù finds Coe uttering a racial slur on record for the first time, singing the line ‚ÄúWorkin‚Äô like a nigger for my room and board.‚Äù The song paints a picture of a Texas family that verges on caricature, with the narrator describing his tattooed father as ‚Äúveteran proud‚Äù and deeming his oldest sister ‚Äúa first-rate whore.‚Äù While comparatively tame next to the pair of underground X-rated albums he would record later, the song further alienated Coe from the country mainstream and kick-started accusations that he was a racist, a charge he always vehemently denied. In 2004 he remarked: Reception Giving the album three out of five stars, AllMusic laments that Rides Again \\"might have been an exceptional album if Coe could only have contained his anger at the musical establishment in Nash Vegas, and not begun caricaturing himself - which added credibility to critics. This is not the place to start with Coe, but fans will most certainly want at least half of the tracks on this album.\\" Track listing All songs written by David Allan Coe and Deborah L.

Purpose Irving is located in the heart of the Dallas- Fort Worth Metroplex. It is estimated that there are 100,000 Muslims in DFW Metroplex. The center's goal is to serve the Muslim population by providing a Mosque, which is a place to pray, and an Islamic school. It also provides Islamic activities to strengthen the Islamic community ties socially and religiously. Its mission statement is to provide a central Islamic Center for all people in the Irving and DFW Area, utilizing all avenues for Dawah, while providing an Islamic Environment and Comprehensive Islamic Education to the next generation. History The idea of establishing an Islamic center originated in the early 1980s when a group of Muslims started praying the five daily and the Jumu'ah (Friday) prayers together in one of their own houses. Soon they had to move to a bigger place, from one apartment to another until they were able to rent an apartment and use it as a Mosque where they performed all their prayers. The number of people praying continued to increase which required them to find a bigger place. In 1990, the group rented a house that could accommodate about 75 people to use as the Mosque. Not too long afterwards, the number of people praying exceeded 75, and some of them had to pray outside the house. A school for the children was held each weekend but had to close down eight months later because the place was not suitable for studying. For many years the group had to move from one place to another, renting halls for the Friday prayers as the number of the people praying reached between 200 and 300 men and there was no place for women. Muslims in the group were prevented from praying in some of the halls. Current building The new building on 2555 N Esters Road is fully functional and it has regular 5 times prayer in the new masjid. It can accommodate about 2500 worshipers for the weekly Jumu'ah prayer in 2 sessions. It also supports the Islamic School of Irving, Sunday and Summer School, Marriage Services, Funeral Services, Quranic and Arabic Teachings, and even Sunday tours for the public to learn more about Islam.

During this time, the headward erosion of ancestral Rainbow Falls led to its location today, where the visitor's center was built. The chasm has a continuous exposure of a section of Potsdam Sandstone more than thick, which includes a rare, mid- Cambrian Scyphomedusae jellyfish fossil. Some of the rock formations have been given names such as Cathedral, The Devil's Oven, Elephant's Head, The Flume, Sentinel Rock, and Table Rock. Tourism In 1760, Major John Howe explored the chasm on ropes. Five years later, Irish settler William Gilliland wrote about the Chasm in his journal: \\"It is a most admirable sight, appearing on each side like a regular built wall, somewhat ruinated, and one would think that this prodigious clift was occasioned by an earthquake, their height on each side is from 40 to 100 feet in the different places; we saw about a half a mile of it, and by its appearance where we stopped it may continue very many miles further.\\" Called by some the \\"Little Grand Canyon of the East\\", the chasm opened to the public in 1870.

The holiday has been celebrated since 1934 and marks the victory of Estonia and neighboring Latvia in the Battle of Cƒìsis against the Baltische Landeswehr on June 23, 1919.  History  The battle was part of the 1918‚Äì1920 Estonian Liberation War of Independence, in which the new Estonian government was fought the Soviet Union's Red Army and the Baltische Landeswehr, which consisted of Baltic German nobility from Courland and the Governorate of Livonia who served the German Empire and aimed to establish the United Baltic Duchy. After the fighting began On 19 June, the combined force of the 3rd Division, the Kuperjanov Infantry Partisian Battalion and the Latvian Northern Brigade pushed held out with reinforcements arriving On 21 June and despite the fact that they did not have the advantage when it came to weaponry (German troops had 5,500‚Äì6,300 infantry, 500‚Äì600 cavalry as well as a high number of cannons and mortars). On 23 June, after pushing back on the last of the German attacks, the combined contingent staged a large counter-attack which resulted in the recapture of Cƒìsis (V√µnnu in Estonian). After this occurred, Major General Ernst P√µdder ordered his day-to-day command of the day that \\"the victories won over our stagnant and surrendered enemy, in cities and in the countryside, flags and armed units in the local garrisons were set up.\\" On 16 February 1934, the Riigikogu decided to turn the 23 June into a national holiday. The holiday was banned by the new Soviet authorities in Estonia after the USSR re-established Soviet rule over Estonia in 1944. It was also banned by the previous German occupation of Estonia during World War II. It became legal to celebrate V√µidup√ºha again after Estonia regained its independence. The first celebrations of the holiday took place in 1992, in the Kadriorg Palace yard.  Observances  American paratroopers from the 173rd Airborne Brigade marching in 2014 Estonian V√µidup√ºha parade. Joint celebrations are observed by both the Estonian Defence Forces and the Latvian National Armed Forces being that it was a joint victory between the two countries. Despite this, Estonia celebrates Victory Day more as a national holiday and event unlike their Latvian counterparts. Celebrations of V√µidup√ºha has been organized by the Estonian Defence League since 2000. Ceremonially, the holiday is also tied to St John's Day (Jaani√µhtu) on June 24, celebrating the summer solstice observances and the Nativity of Saint John the Baptist. The traditional lighting of a fire by the Estonian President on the morning of Victory Day was restored after the Soviet occupation From this fire, the flame of independence would be carried across the country to light the many other bonfires in other cities. By Estonian laws, all national symbols must be present, which requires that the state flags are not to be lowered on any government buildings during the night that passes between these two days.

A poem in the Lebor Gab√°la, expanded on by C√©itinn, tells how Parthol√≥n and his wife lived on a small island near the head of the estuary of the River Erne. Once, while Parthol√≥n was out touring his domain, his wife, Delgnat, seduced a servant, Topa. Afterwards they drank from Parthol√≥n's ale, which could only be drunk through a golden tube. Parthol√≥n discovered the affair when he drank his ale and recognised the taste of Delgnat's and Topa's mouths on the tube. In anger, he killed Topa, and his wife's dog. But Delgnat was unrepentant, and insisted that Parthol√≥n himself was to blame, as leaving them alone together was like leaving honey before a woman, milk before a cat, edged tools before a craftsman, or meat before a child, and expecting them not to take advantage. This is recorded as the first adultery and the first jealousy in Ireland. The island they lived on was named Inis Saimera after Saimer, Dalgnat's dog.

The game is described by the development team as a \\"dramatic adventure\\", and a . The game bears the tagline, \\"Five little love tales which are likely to be buried in snow.\\" The gameplay in 5 follows a linear plot line, which offers pre-determined scenarios and courses of interaction, and focuses on the appeal of the five female main characters. Gameplay A conversation in 5 depicting the main character talking to Airi. 5's gameplay requires little interaction from the player as most of the duration of the game is spent simply reading the text that appears on the screen which represents either dialogue between the various characters or the inner thoughts of the protagonist. Every so often, the player will come to a point where he or she is given the chance to choose from multiple options. The time between these points is variable and can occur anywhere from a minute to much longer. Gameplay pauses at these points and depending on which choice the player makes, the plot will progress in a specific direction. There are five main plot lines that the player will have the chance to experience, one for each of the heroines in the story. To view all five plot lines, the player will have to replay the game multiple times and make different decisions to progress the plot in an alternate direction. One of the goals of the gameplay is for the player to enable the viewing of hentai scenes depicting the protagonist, Takahiro, and one of the five heroines having sexual intercourse. Plot and characters The story of 5 revolves around , who makes a trip to Hokkaid≈ç, Japan with his younger sister in the winter. The two find their way to , a friend of their father's, only to realize that their visit is not expected as their father only contacted her regarding their visit that morning of their arrival. Despite this, Kaede welcomes them to stay at her farm, where the main portion of the game's story takes place, and provides them with food and shelter. After two days at the farm, Takahiro rides Kaede's motorcycle to the town's shopping district and comes upon a lively, but clumsy girl named , who collided with Takahiro and injured her leg after running downhill. Due to this, Takahiro decides to take her home where he meets her older sister . Nene, unlike Honoka, is more reliable, intelligent, and takes care of the general domestic household chores. Development Originally titled , 5 is the third and last project developed by the visual novel studio Ram,\\"Ram the last project\\" Taken from the opening sequence of the demo. and took about eight years to develop. Much of the staff for 5 did not work on Ram's previous two titles Negai and Koigokoro. Art direction and character design was headed by the artist Bang!, which was the artist's first work on a visual novel. Background art is headed by Torino. For work on the scenario, the author Kai returns as the only scenario writer for 5 that also worked on Ram's previous two titles. Hiroshi Yamaji and Kanrinin also worked on the scenario, despite the two having not been on the staff for many visual novels. The music in the game was composed primarily by Jun Maeda of Key, and VWN who also worked on the music for Negai and Koigokoro. Maeda stated that he composed about twenty background music tracks used in the game, and this was the first time he worked as the main composer on a game project. Both Kai and Torino have worked with Maeda in the past on previous Key titles. Release history On May 15, 2008, a free game demo of 5 became available for download at Ram's official website. In the demo, the player is introduced to the main characters in the game through a lengthy sequence that is typical of the gameplay found in a visual novel which includes times during gameplay where the player is given several choices to make in order to further the plot in a specific direction. It was followed by a second demo, released online on July 11, 2008, with edited scenario, and full voice acting with the exception of Takahiro. The full game was first released on July 25, 2008, after an eight-year hiatus since the original release of their previous game Koigokoro, as a DVD playable only on a Microsoft Windows PC. Music The visual novel has two main theme songs, the opening theme , and the ending theme , both sung by Haruka Shimotsuki. Both songs were written and composed by Jun Maeda of Key. Arrangement was handled by two artists, Takumaru for the opening theme, and Magome Togoshi for the ending theme, both of which have previously worked with Maeda on albums released by Key under their record label Key Sounds Label. A maxi single titled \\"Kaze no Kotowari\\" containing the two songs was included with the game as a pre-order extra. The game's original soundtrack entitled Yukar was released in a three CD set on July 24, 2009. Reception and sales Based on the sales on Getchu.com, 5 made its only appearance on its sales ranking at the nineteenth place out of thirty when it was first released in July 2008. According to a national ranking of bish≈çjo games based on sales in Japan, the limited edition of 5 premiered at eighteenth place out of fifty.

Carol S. Wald (; January 21, 1935 ‚Äì September 8, 2000) was an American artist who was also widely known for her talents as an illustrator. Her collages and paintings appeared in Time, Fortune, and Ms, and on the covers of Business Week, the New York Times Sunday Magazine, and Saturday Review. Biography Carol Wald was born in Detroit, Michigan, where she began studying art at age twelve. At age sixteen, while still a student at Detroit's Cass Technical High School, her talent was recognized by mayor Albert Cobo, and in 1954 she was awarded a four-year scholarship at the Art School of the Society of Arts and Crafts in Detroit. In 1960, the Detroit Institute of Arts purchased one of her paintings, \\"Children On Stilts\\". In 1963, she studied under Ben Shahn at the Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture, Skowhegan, Maine, and in 1967 she studied at the Cranbrook Educational Community in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan. In 1964 she was given a ten-year retrospective exhibition at the Flint Institute of Arts in Flint, Michigan. By 1970 the National Gallery of Art and the Minnesota Museum of American Art had each purchased paintings by her for their permanent collections. She left Detroit for New York City in 1971, where she emerged as one of the nation's top illustrators. In 1975 she was awarded a gold medal for editorial illustration from the Society of Illustrators in New York. In 1976, she was commissioned by the Ford administration to paint America's official Bicentennial painting, which is on display at Grand Valley State University in Grand Rapids. She prepared the covers and chapter opening artwork for Ben Shneiderman's books: Software Psychology (1980) and Designing the User Interface (1986). Exercising the Mares, 1977, from a private collection In the 1980s, a class reunion organizer for Cass Tech put her in touch with fellow alumnus, the filmmaker Hermann Tauchert. They had actually met in high school 25 years earlier, when they dated each other's friends. Romance bloomed and for two or three years, they conducted a long-distance love affair, with Tauchert in Detroit and Wald in New York. But finally in 1986, Wald moved back to Detroit and they married. In 1990, worried about the high levels of crime in Detroit, they moved to Burlington, Ontario. In 1997, Wald was diagnosed with cancer; three years later, she died in the Ian Anderson House, Oakville, on September 8, 2000.

He is a member of Egypt's third generation of classical composers. Biography Abdelfattah was born in Giza. He graduated with a B.A. degree from the College of Applied Arts of Helwan University, Orman campus in Egypt and went on to attain second and third B.A. degrees from the Faculty of Composition and Department of Ear Training (Solfege) at the same year 1986, from the Cairo Conservatoire, with \\"excellent honors\\". In Egypt he studied composition under Gamal Abdel-Rahim, music history under Samha El-Kholy, harmony under Awatef Abdel Karim, counterpoint under Laiela El-Saiyad, instrumentation under Gihad Dawoud, orchestration under Youssef Elsisi, score reading under Gamal Salama, Schenkerian analysis under Ahmed El-Saedi, music education under Ikram Matter and solfege under Aiyda Danial. Abdelfattah was appointed to the faculty at Cairo Conservatoire in 1987, and he later obtained his M.A. degree, with his thesis entitled \\"Dodecaphony and Maqamat\\" from the Academy of Arts in Cairo in 1990, supervised by Awatef Abdel Karim. Abdelfattah received a scholarship in 1990 to study composition in Austria. He first studied composition in Graz and later in Vienna. He studied electroacoustic and experimental music under Dieter Kaufmann, where he obtained the qualification of Master of Arts in composition, from the University of Music and Performing Arts, Vienna in 1996. This degree was transferred to a Ph.D. in Egypt in 1998 from the academy of Arts University and the Minister of Higher Education. After his return to Egypt, he was promoted at the Cairo Conservatoire to assistant professor in 1989 and to associate professor in 2003. Abdelfattah is a multidisciplinary artist combining many fields in his compositions such as: poetry, painting, photography, and cinema montage, and presents them simultaneously and unconventionally using computer technology. He mixes the tone color of Egyptian traditional melodies with sound effects of machines, tools, and the sounds of daily life. He presented his first experimental and acoustic music concert in Egypt at the Cairo Opera House on November 22, 1999. Abdelfattah's works have been covered in both public and cultural media, where he has been quoted as being a comprehensive artist and a multi-media music pioneer in Egypt and the Arab countries. He has written some movements in modern graphic notation, under the title Nine Miniatures for String Quartet, premiered in Rome on December 2, 1999. He is also the first Egyptian composer to have written a composition with a specific music notation for the deaf. He has established a chamber percussion ensemble consisting entirely of deaf students in Egypt where he conducted them to perform a visual music composition under the title Seeing the Sound in a public concert at the Cairo Opera House on March 29, 2005. Over the last five years, Abdel-Wahab has focused on research, and published two books about orchestration and creating the sound. In his most recent booklet \\"Sound Scenography\\", entitled also Seeing the Sound, published in two volumes, (Academy of Arts University in Cairo), 2005, he writes about his unique experience related to embodied art and music. In this book he discusses new sound and musical terms, what he calls \\"Sound Theatricalization & Filmlization\\"‚Äîthe translation of the dramatic feeling of any sound event into a specific visual display upon the stage. He has also written several articles in Arabic cultural journals about contemporary composition and how to find practical functions for music within society. His interests include writing applied music composition for the deaf and comic music to help from depression. He has cooperated with several Egyptian biologists and physicians to study the effectiveness of sound vibrations on the human bones and sound frequencies on blood pressure and brain function. He composed a therapeutic work utilizing water sound effects for depression, which was performed at Maadi hospital in Cairo in 2006. During the 2007‚Äì2009 academic year, he was a visiting professor at Boston University. He is currently a visiting lecturer at Salem State University. He frequently combines Eastern and Western elements, reflecting his view of the importance of cross-cultural experience. Beyond merely creating art for art's sake, Abdelfattah envisions a vital social role for his art in establishing cross- cultural dialogue and understanding, particularly between the Western and Arab peoples.

Beals made his debut for the Olympics playing under the name W. Thomas on July 27, 1871. The Olympics franchise did not last beyond nine games into their 1872 schedule, and Beals was able to join the Blue Stockings the next season as a second baseman/catcher. He had the best season of his career, hitting .272 with a career-high 24 RBI on 46 hits. In 1874, Beals started playing under his given name with the perennially powerful Red Stockings. As a part-time second baseman/outfielder, he only managed to hit .196. He reprised his part-time role in the Boston outfield the next season but significantly increased his production, hitting .265. After that 1875 season, the National Association became the National League, and Beals was without a job in Major League Baseball for the next four seasons. Beals reemerged in 1880 with the White Stockings at age 29. He played 13 games for the Chicago club that season, hitting a career-low .152, and hung up his spikes after the season. Beals died, at the age of 65, on October 2, 1915 in San Francisco, California, and he is interred at Cypress Lawn Memorial Park in Colma, California.

Mary wrote the drama and Percy contributed two lyric poems to it. Written in 1820 while the Shelleys were living in Italy, Mary Shelley tried unsuccessfully to have the play published by children's magazines in England in the 1830s; however, it was not published until A. Koszul's 1922 scholarly edition. Whether or not the drama was ever meant to be staged is a point of debate among scholars. The play combines the stories of the musical contest between Apollo and Pan and that of King Midas and his ability to turn everything he touches to gold. Largely concerned with gender issues, Midas comments on the definitions of femininity and masculinity in the early nineteenth century and the developing ideology of separate spheres which encouraged women to restrict themselves to domestic affairs and men to political affairs. Part of the Romantic interest in rewriting classical myths, Midas focuses on challenging patriarchy and satirising the unbounded accumulation of wealth. The genre of Midas bears the marks of gender debates, as well, with Percy writing in the traditionally male-dominated form of the lyric and Mary focusing on the details of everyday life in her verse drama. Since the play's first publication in 1922, critics have paid more attention to Percy Shelley's lyrics than Mary Shelley's drama. However, since the 1990s, this trend has reversed itself as scholars explore works of Mary Shelley other than Frankenstein (1818). Background Mary Shelley by Richard Rothwell (1839‚Äì40) By 1816, the Shelleys were living in Italy and in 1818 and 1819, two of their young children died, Clara and William. Mary entered into a deep depression and became alienated from Percy, who was not as deeply affected by the loss of their children.Seymour, 232-33. Mary Shelley revived a bit with the birth of Percy Florence later in 1819.Pascoe, 183. Despite the overwhelming grief caused by the death of her two children, Mary Shelley continued to study and read as she had throughout her life. Between 1818 and 1820, she exposed herself to quite a bit of drama. She read many of William Shakespeare's plays, some with Percy Shelley. Percy believed that Mary had a talent for drama and convinced her to study the great English, French, Latin, and Italian plays as well as drama theory. He even sought her advice regarding his play The Cenci.Pascoe, 183-84. Less glamorously, Mary transcribed the manuscript of Percy's drama Prometheus Unbound.Richardson, 124. The Shelleys also attended operas, ballets, and plays. Mary Shelley's studies were broad during these years. She began to study Greek in 1820 and read widely on education. For example, she read Jean- Jacques Rousseau's philosophical work on education, Emile, and his sentimental novel, La Nouvelle H√©lo√èse as well as Thomas Day's children's book The History of Sandford and Merton.Purinton, 389. Writing and publication Mary Shelley wrote Midas in 1820. Miranda Seymour, a Mary Shelley biographer, speculates that she wrote Midas and Proserpine for two young girls she met and befriended, Laurette and Nerina Tighe. They were the daughters of friends of the Shelleys in Italy and their mother was a former pupil of Mary Shelley's mother, Mary Wollstonecraft.Seymour, 242. The same year, she wrote the children's story Maurice for Laurette. Mary Shelley submitted the play for publication to The Browning Box, edited by Bryan Walter Procter, in 1824; it was rejected. In 1830, she submitted it to Rudolph Ackermann for publication in his children's magazine Forget-Me-Not; it was again rejected. In 1832, she sent it to Alaric Alexander Watts for consideration in his annual Literary Souvenir, however in her letter she suggested that the drama may be more appropriate for the juvenile publications edited by his wife, Priscilla Maden Watts. The drama was first published in 1922 by literary scholar A. Koszul. Plot summary Apollo with his lyre by Stanis≈Çaw Wyspia≈Ñski (c. 1897) In Act I Pan challenges Apollo to a musical contest, with Tmolus as the judge. Tmolus awards the victory to Apollo. Pan challenges his decision, asking the mortal King Midas to decide the contest. Midas has a bias towards Pan and decides in favour of him. Apollo, upset at this mortal's interference in immortal affairs, punishes Midas by turning his ears into ass's ears, saying \\"thus to the world / Wear thou the marks of what thou art, / Let Pan himself blush at such a judge\\".Shelley, Midas, 56. Zopyrion, Midas's prime minister, helps the king figure out to hide his ears: they design a crown to hide them. Although Zopyrion is determined to keep the king's secret, he still finds the situation hysterical. When he encounters Asphalion, a courtier, he misunderstands him and thinks that Asphalion also knows the secret. Asphalion discovers he has a secret, but not what it is. After Asphalion leaves, Zopyrion whispers the secret to the \\"greenest reeds that sway / And nod your feathered heads beneath the sun\\".Shelley, Midas, 63. Bacchus then arrives, searching for Silenus. Bacchus decides to reward Midas for his hospitality and offers to grant him any wish he wants. Although his prime minister suggests that he wish for his original ears back, Midas wishes that everything he touches be turned to gold. During this conversation, Midas is convinced he hears Zopyrion whispering his secret, but it is really the reeds saying \\"Midas, the king, has the ears of an ass.\\" Act II begins with Midas enamored with his new power of turning things to gold. However, his courtiers complain of being forced to wear heavy golden clothing. Midas rebukes them, saying \\"I am a God!\\".Shelley, Midas, 75. But Midas himself begins to experience the problems of turning everything he touches to gold: he cannot eat, for example. He starts to regret his wish, saying \\"Oh! fool! to wish to change all things to gold! / Blind Ideot that I was!\\".Shelley, Midas, 78. Midas prays to Bacchus to take away his power, begging \\"Make me a hind, clothe me in ragged skins‚Äî / And let my food be bread, unsavoury roots, / But take from me the frightful curse of gold\\".Shelley, Midas, 81. Midas has his courtiers sacrifice to the gods to see if he can be relieved of his curse; Bacchus relents and tells him to bathe in the river. The courtiers find it strange that he does not remove his crown while he swims; one of them resolves to peek under his crown while he is sleeping. Returning from his swim, Midas celebrates nature, saying gold \\"is a sordid, base and dirty thing;‚Äî / Look at the grass, the sky, the trees, the flowers, / These are Joves treasures & they are not gold\\".Shelley, Midas, 87. Genre Percy Bysshe Shelley (1819, Amelia Curran) Mary Shelley described Midas as a \\"short mythological comic drama in verse\\".Qtd. in Purinton, 389. Her efforts to publish it as a children's drama suggest that she thought of it as children's literature. At this time, \\"instructional\\" literature for children was most often written by women, who were viewed as having superior knowledge regarding the raising of the young. While placing women in a traditional maternal role, this literature also allowed them the opportunity to participate in the public sphere as authors and directors of morality. Shelley's mother, Mary Wollstonecraft, had written two such works, Thoughts on the Education of Daughters (1787) and Original Stories from Real Life (1788) that she undoubtedly knew. As Purinton writes, \\"Mary Shelley's seemingly simple plays are complicated by their position with this context of 'instructional' literature at a historical moment when the boundaries of private and public discourse are blurred.\\"Purinton, 390. Scholars have disputed whether or not Shelley meant for her play to be staged. Alan Richardson, for example, argues that the play is \\"lyrical drama\\" or \\"mental theater\\" in the style of Romantic closet drama \\"with its emphasis on character over plot, on reaction over action, and its turn away from the theater\\".Richardson, 125. However, Judith Pascoe challenges this conclusion, pointing to manuscript evidence such as stage directions; she argues that Mary Shelley intended her play to be staged.Pascoe, 184. Literary scholar Jeffrey Cox has argued that Midas, along with Proserpine, Prometheus Unbound and other plays written by the Leigh Hunt circle, were \\"not a rejection of the stage but an attempt to remake it\\".Cox, 246. Turning from tragedy and the comedy of manners, these writers reinvented drama by writing masques and pastoral dramas. He argues that Midas and Proserpine are \\"a mythological diptych that indites on stage the forces of oppression\\".Cox, 252. For him, Midas \\"ends appropriately with Midas giving up his golden touch and turning to celebrate a pastoral world of simplicity and equality\\".Cox, 253. In the early nineteenth century, lyric poetry was associated with male poets and quotidian poetry (i.e., the poetry of the everyday) with female poets. The division of labour in Midas reflects this trend: Percy contributed the two lyric poems in the drama while Mary's play contains the kind of detail found in the poetry of other women.Richardson, 124-25. However, Mary Shelley does not simply accept these gender-genre distinctions. As Richardson explains, \\"soliloquy is resisted in the first act and exposed in the second act as a questionable and implicitly masculine mode\\". Furthermore, the disjunction between Percy Shelley's poems, spoken by Apollo and Pan in the first act, and Mary Shelley's verse drama has often bothered critics. Yet, Richardson argues that this was intended, to highlight the difference in poetic mode. Style and themes Mary Shelley's gender concerns did not cease with generic issues. In the musical contest between Apollo and Pan in the first act, Apollo is associated with masculine characteristics, such as philosophy, science, and reason, and Pan is associated with feminine characteristics, such as sheep and nature. however, as Purinton notes, \\"both sing egocentric lyrics that boast of their 'instruments' and their deeds\\".Purinton, 391. When Apollo wins, the play appears to celebrate \\"male superiority\\". However, Pan appeals the decision to King Midas, who reverses the decision in Pan's favour, for which he is then punished. Purinton argues that the play therefore breaks down traditional gender distinctions, portraying characters with mixed gender signals. In this way, she writes, \\"as cross-dressed dramaturgy, then, Midas is a comedy about women's issues played out on male bodies\\". For her, the play dramatizes the problems with the nineteenth-century ideology of separate spheres, where women were expected to remain in the private, domestic sphere and men were expected to participate in the political, public sphere.Purinton, 386. Shelley also uses the figure of Midas to comment on capitalism and imperialism. Midas's initial joy in acquiring gold is symbolic of contemporary England, \\"racing headlong into its new identity as an industrialized, consumerist society financed by political and mercantile imperialism\\".Richardson, 131. For Shelley, these commercial efforts are particularly masculine; Midas's ears, which symbolise emasculation, are juxtaposed to masculinising gold.Purinton, 393. Furthermore, Shelley suggests that when political leaders become feminised, they lose their political power. She draws an analogy between Midas and George III and George IV, British kings who were often viewed as feminised.Purinton, 392. Like Percy Shelley, John Keats, and Lord Byron, Mary Shelley was rewriting the classical myths; however, like other Romantic women writers, she was challenging patriarchy in particular.Richardson, 127. Midas is not just a commentary on Ovid's version of the tale in the Metamorphoses; it is also a commentary on Geoffrey Chaucer's version in The Wife of Bath's Tale. In Ovid's version it is Midas's barber who cannot keep the secret of his ears; in Chaucer's version, it is his wife.Richardson, 130-31. In Mary Shelley's version, it is Midas's prime minister who cannot keep the secret; however, Midas is convinced a woman has revealed his secret and a courtier explicitly states \\"There is no woman here\\".Qtd. in Richardson, 131. Proserpine and Midas are often seen as a pair of contrasting plays. Proserpine is a play of female bonding, while Midas is a male-dominated drama; male poets participate in a contest in Midas while in Proserpine female characters participate in communal storytelling; \\"where Midas lives in his golden palace imagining himself at the center of an all-powerful court, Ceres laments leaving the pastoral enclave she shares with Proserpine for Jove's court\\"; Midas focuses on gold, while the women in Proserpine enjoy flowers; and \\"where the society of Midas is marked by egotism, greed, and strife, the female society of Proserpine values community, gift-giving, and love\\". Reception When A. Koszul first published an edited version of Midas in 1922, he argued \\"that the little classical fancies which Mrs. Shelley never ventured to publish are quite as worthy of consideration as her more ambitious prose works\\".Koszul, \\"Introduction\\", vii. However, his \\"Introduction\\" to the play speaks mostly of Percy Shelley and his contribution to Mary Shelley's works. In fact, as he explains, he has decided to publish to contribute to the Percy Shelley centenary.Koszul, \\"Introduction\\", iii. Since their original publication, neither Midas nor Proserpine has received much critical attention. Critics have either only paid attention to Percy Shelley's poems or dismissed the plays. Literary critic Elizabeth Nitchie wrote that the plays are \\"distinguished only by the lyrics that [Percy] Shelley wrote for them\\" and Sylva Norman contends that they \\"do not really call for analytical and comparative study\\".Qtd. in Richardson, 124. However, since the 1990s, beginning with the publication of The Other Mary Shelley, more attention has been paid to Mary Shelley's \\"other\\" works, such as her dramas.

This subspecies is found predominantly in forests between south eastern Mexico and north eastern Peru. Typical of its species, the Mexican howler monkey has a prehensile tail, a deep jaw, and a large pharynx which it uses to make characteristically deep and resonating howls.Cuar√≥n, A.D., Shedden, A., Rodr√≠guez-Luna, E., de Grammont, P.C., Link, A., Palacios, E., Morales, A. & Cort√©s-Ortiz, L. 2008. Alouatta palliata. The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Version 2014.3. . Downloaded on 09 December 2014. Mantled howler monkeys are known for forming unusually large cohorts averaging 14 members and sometimes extending to 40 members. Taxonomy There are five subspecies of the A. palliata which are Alouatta palliata aequatorialis, Alouatta palliata coibensis, Alouatta palliata palliata, Alouatta palliata trabeata and Alouatta palliata mexicana.Cuar√≥n, A.D., Shedden, A., Rodr√≠guez-Luna, E., de Grammont, P.C., Link, A., Palacios, E., Morales, A. & Cort√©s-Ortiz, L. 2008. Alouatta palliata. The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Version 2014.3. . Downloaded on 9 December 2014. Compared with members of the howler monkey genus, the Mexican howler is sympatric with the Guatemalan black howler, A. pigra, in Tabasco, Mexico. The Mexican howler differs from the golden-mantled howler, A. palliata palliata, primarily in aspects of skull morphology, and in some differences in pelage. The golden-mantled howler's range includes parts of Guatemala and Honduras, and it is not clear if the Mexican and golden- mantled howler's ranges currently are in contact. Geography The Mexican howler monkey is primarily located between south eastern Mexico and north eastern Peru.Estrada, A., Juan-Solano, S., Ortiz M.T., Coates-Estrada, R., 1999, Feeding and general activity patterns of a howler monkey (Alouatta palliata) troop living in a forest fragment at Los Tuxtlas, Mexico. American Journal of Primatology, 48(3) 167-83. As of 2008, this subspecies was determined to be critically endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. due to the loss of its natural habitat as a result of deforestation.Van Belle S, Estrada A, 2006. Demographic features of Alouatta pigra populations in extensive and fragmented forests. In: Estrada A, Garber PA, Pavelka M, Luecke L ed. New Perspec- tives in the Study of Mesoamerican Primates: Distribution, Ecology and Conservation. USA: Springer, 121‚Äì142.

American Journal of Primatology. Vol. 70 (1), pp. 69-77. Diet The Mexican howler can eat a remarkable variety of foods including leaves, flower, buds, petioles, and fruits. This subspecies of howler monkey is known to be a frugivore and a behavioural folivores. Their digestive system is slow and they have significantly fewer enzymes for protein and fiber digestion than other frugivores, but they compensate for this by selectively eating leaves with less fiber. Consequently, much of this the Mexican howler monkey's activity is dedicated for foraging for fruit and young leaves which it can easily digest. Frugivory is typically observed in New World monkeys instead of Old World monkeys, but howler monkeys are an exception to this categorization.Can phenology explain the scarcity of folivory in New World primates? Heymann EW. in the American Journal of Primatology; November 2001 Behavior This howler monkey species has compensated for its adapted digestive system by minimizing energy output as much as possible. The Mexican howler exhinbits limited interaction with members of its species and very minor aggressive behavior.Klein, L. L. (1974). Agonistic behavior in neotropical primates. In Holloway, R. L. (ed.), Primate Aggression, Territoriality, and Xenophobia, Academic Press, New York, pp. 77‚Äì122. There is evidence of physical aggression between members of the species during migratory periods or changes in dominance.Crist√≥bal-Azkarate, J, Dias, P, & Ve√†, J 2004, 'Causes of Intraspecific Aggression in Alouatta palliata mexicana: Evidence from Injuries, Demography, and Habitat', International Journal of Primatology, 25, 4, pp. 939-953, Academic Search Premier, EBSCOhost, viewed 7 December 2014 Males, when fighting for dominance, have been observed to target juveniles, sometimes even killing them, and physically injuring older males.

Reproduction and population growth in free-ranging mantled howling monkeys. Am. J. Physical Anthropol. 53: 25‚Äì36.

It was republished, as with most of Korman's older books, in 2004 with a new cover and updated text.  Main characters  Rudy Miller, the novel's protagonist, is a loner who is sent to camp against his wishes by his school's guidance department. Exceptional at virtually everything, he hates everything about camp and anything that has to do with sports. Very literal and logical, he, with his new friend Mike Webster, attempt to escape the island in an effort to return home, an action they both fail throughout the book (there is reference at the end to them eventually escaping a number of times, only to come back and try again.) Rudy has a little brother who is remarkably like him. Mike Webster is Rudy's best friend at camp. He shares much of the same attitude toward camp and sports in particular as Rudy does and laughs at all of Rudy's witty remarks. Consequently, his laugh is very infectious and usually ends up making whole crowds laugh. He was sent to camp for getting high grades in school and considers that if this was his parents' idea of a reward, than he would've probably gotten into a lot more serious trouble if he had failed. Mike has a younger sister called Vikki. Chip, Rudy and Mike's bunk counselor. Chip is peppy and cheery to begin with, but quickly becomes short- tempered and irritated due to Rudy's antics. He easily gets fed up with all of Rudy's constant remarks and escape attempts. He's usually the one who captures or foils Rudy and Mike's escape attempts or is the first one to figure them out. Despite Chip's constant vows to kill the two and fear of sounding like them, he is the only counselor who appears the most worried about them when they get lost. He defends Rudy from all the other counselors (including Head Counselor Frank) when they want to force Rudy to play on their teams in order to win camp championships against other camps. Harold Greene is Rudy and Mike's enemy. Sneering and smart-mouthed, Harold constantly puts down, makes remarks, or makes fun of both Rudy and Mike for not participating in anything and generally being different. Harold refers to both Rudy and Mike as \\"Nuts.\\" In return, Mike refers to Harold as a \\"twit.\\" While Rudy was the original target of Harold's snide comments, the verbal fights that ensue between them are really Harold making a comment and Mike standing up for Rudy, while Rudy maintains a neutral presence and simply adds in neutral observations or requests. As a result of Harold's verbal hostility he's a target for Rudy's retaliation (such as filling his shoes with garbage, then spilling it into his pillow when he's ordered to spill the waste out, or removing the wooden slats that support his mattress to build a box, and then capitalizing his resulting fall on top of Adam Wills below him as the catalyst for a major pillow fight (to be blamed on him for \\"Jumping on Adam for no reason at all\\"). Frank, the Head Counselor, is in charge of all the counselors and is the first one at the beginning to ask the Warden, \\"Is there any last problems that we should know about?\\" foreshadowing the major problem Rudy becomes for the entire staff. Pierre is the counselor in charge of Arts and Crafts. He criticizes Chip's humorless handling of Rudy and Mike, initially believing that some activity (like Arts and Crafts) will keep the boys from running away. After he is proven wrong in this aspect, he tries to play along with Rudy's humor, thus being able to foresee an escape plan, but not the chaos caused by the attempted escape. He admires Rudy's wit. Mr. Warden is the Camp Director. His grandfather, Elias Warden, founded the camp thirty years prior to the present in the book and usually states, every time something unusual or not normal happens, \\"This is Camp Algonkian Island. It was founded thirty-one years ago by my grandfather, Elias Warden, and never once, before today, has [anything not normal happened].\\" A middle-aged man with bow legs who apparently doesn't like kids, he strictly lives by the time in which his grandfather was director of the camp, meaning nothing to him can be different now from then. This stern belief usually blinds him from current problems or preventing future problems, and he remains completely oblivious to virtually any of the actions or events that take place in the novel. He's the first to find out that a newcomer to the camp, Rudy Miller, could potentially become a problem, but forgets about that due to kids never being a problem and always loving camp in his grandfather's age. He lives by this one rule: That's the way it was then, that's the way it is now.  Reception  On its republication in 2004, Resource Links proclaimed that the book is \\"good, even great at times\\" and that it \\"will be as popular with young readers today as it was more than 20 years ago\\". CM Magazine said that while it \\"[won't] ever be considered great literature\\", it is a \\"laugh out loud adventure\\" and a \\"Canadian classic\\"; however they also felt that the character of Mr Warden was \\"questionable\\". Pasha Malla, in a 2008 article for CBC.ca, wrote that \\"even beyond nostalgia, it's a fun, engaging read\\" and that the sarcasm of the main character had been \\"refreshing\\" for him.

In the process of learning how to defeat Strigoi (the evil undead vampires) in St. Vladimir's Academy, Rose finds herself caught in a forbidden romance with her instructor, Dimitri Belikov, while having an unbreakable psychic bond with Lissa. The first book in the series, Vampire Academy, was published in 2007; it was followed by Frostbite in 2008.

Plot summary In Vampire Academy, guardian in training Rosemarie \\"Rose\\" Hathaway and Moroi princess Vasilisa \\"Lissa\\" Dragomir are brought back to their school, St. Vladimir's Academy, after running away two years prior. Upon their return, Guardian Dimitri Belikov, who was the leader of the team of guardians sent to retrieve the two, is assigned to be Lissa's guardian and offers to mentor Rose in her guardian training. He believes Rose can be an excellent guardian to Lissa due to the presence of a rare one-sided psychic bond to Lissa, which allows her to know the latter's thoughts, emotions, and whereabouts. Rose agrees, knowing this is the only way she will be allowed to remain, and on graduation, be Lissa's guardian. It is revealed that Lissa has a miraculous ability to heal others but when she becomes depressed she engages in self-mutilation. Lissa becomes friends with an outcast Moroi classmate, Christian Ozera who Rose immediately dislikes, stating that he is a bad-influence, partly because his parents voluntarily became Strigoi. The girls are bullied frequently by a non-royal named Mia along with her royal friends, because of her grudge against Lissa's brother for using her. Rose reaches through her bond while confined to her room to find that Lissa is being kidnapped. She sneaks out of her room to tell Dimitri that Lissa has been kidnapped, but they are distracted by a lust charm planted by Victor Dashkov, close uncle-figure of Lissa and father of Natalie Dashkov. Natalie is Lissa‚Äôs roommate at the academy, as well as Lissa and Rose's friend. After Dimitri disposes of the charm, Rose directs a convoy to the kidnapper's hideout, with Christian stowing away during the ride. The school guardians are able to rescue Lissa from the moroi man she has called \\"Uncle\\" all her life, Victor, and she heals Christian when he is severely injured during the struggle. Lissa accepts him as her boyfriend after that. Dimitri reveals that he has feelings for Rose but cannot have a relationship with her because of their age difference, because he is her mentor and also because he worries that if he lets himself love her, he wouldn't throw himself in front of the princess, as is his duty, but he would be inclined to protect her. This may lead to danger to their assigned Moroi. It is revealed Natalie had been spying on the girls and reporting back to Victor about Lissa‚Äôs magical abilities and the bond between Lissa and Rose. Rose is attacked by a Strigoi when visiting Victor in his cell after he is caught, and Dimitri comes to help her. The story continues in Frostbite with Rose and Dimitri traveling to meet Arthur Schoenberg for Rose's Qualifier Exam. Once they arrive at the home of the Moroi family- Conta- he protects, they discover a bloody massacre of the entire family and their guardians, including Arthur. To keep the students at St. Vladimir's Academy safe, a ski trip to a lodge owned by a wealthy Moroi family is offered over winter break since many of the students families wouldn‚Äôt be able to bring their students home safely and they won‚Äôt all fit on the academy campus to visit for the holidays. During her stay at the lodge, Rose meets a royal Moroi named Adrian Ivashkov, who flirts with her every time he sees her. During a pool party that Adrian invites arose and her friends to, including Mason, his friend Eddie, and Mia, the friends begin voicing their opinions about hunting Strigoi. Rose breaks up a fight between two royal moroi, one who is later revealed to be Adrian‚Äôs father, when they argue about using magic for self defense to help the guardians in the war against the Strigoi. Rose has another encounter with Adrian. Later, after a heated argument with Dimitri over him deciding to go work for and have a relationship with Tasha Ozera, Christian's aunt, Rose tells Mason confidential information about the possible whereabouts of the Strigoi's hideouts despite Dimitri trusting her to keep this information quiet. Using Rose's information, Mia, Mason, and Eddie sneak out of the ski lodge and travel to Spokane, Washington, to hunt down the Strigoi themselves. Rose discovers their plan, and she and Christian follow to stop them. When they find the group, they are ambushed by Strigoi, who hold them captive for days. Rose eventually comes up with a plan to escape, and they all manage to get out of the house into the protection of the light, except Rose. Mason returns and attempts to help Rose, but the Strigoi snap his neck, killing him instantly. Rose defeats the Strigoi- with a blunt sword, in a rage over his death. Once back at St. Vladimir's, Rose receives two molnija marks for her Strigoi kills. Dimitri also tells her that his heart is with Rose and will never leave her for Tasha Ozera. Shadow Kiss begins with Rose preparing for the Qualifying Exam with the rest of the novices. Rose is assigned to Christian for her fieldwork, to her dismay. Christian is approached by Jesse Zeklos to join a secret \\"club\\" he and Ralf have started, Christian turns them down. Rose becomes suspicious, and tries to learn more about this club, which she later learns is called \\"M√¢nƒÉ\\" from Adrian. Rose goes to meet with Queen Tatiana. She insists that Rose call off her \\"engagement\\" to Adrian. Tatiana then reveals that she has been planning a marriage between Adrian and Lissa. Lissa is approached by Jesse and Ralf to join M√¢nƒÉ, and she accepts their invitation as a chance to spy on them, without Rose's knowing. Lissa is led into the woods and attacked by Jesse and the other members of M√¢nƒÉ. Rose senses something is wrong and runs to Lissa's aid. She beats Lissa's attackers and Lissa tortures Jesse using Spirit. Rose realizes that whenever Lissa uses Spirit, dark emotions fill Lissa, which caused her to self-harm in the first book, and tells Lissa to let the dark emotion flow through their connection and into Rose. Lissa obeys, and Rose suddenly begins beating Jesse fiercely. Alberta and Dimitri appear, and Alberta has several guards take Jesse away, while ordering Dimitri to handle Rose, who is still in a manic state. After Dimitri comforts Rose, they sleep together in a cabin on the edge of the campus. When they start to go back to the school, they are attacked by a Strigoi. Dimitri sends Rose back to the school to warn the guardians. The guardians give Rose a stake and send her back to her dormitory, but she sneaks out to go after Christian. She and Christian combine their skills to destroy Strigoi. They go on a rescue mission and are almost close to winning when Dimitri is attacked and Rose later finds out that his body wasn't found. The ghost of Mason, who has been seen by Rose throughout the book, reveals that Dimitri was not killed, but was made Strigoi. Rose decides to leave the Academy, against Lissa's wishes to go after Dimitri and kill him. She borrows money from Adrian with the promise of returning to him once her job is done. She then decides to go to Siberia, believing Dimitri would go there first. In Blood Promise, Rose meets an Alchemist named Sydney and they travel to Siberia, where she eventually finds Dimitri's family...and meets Abe Mazur, a Moroi mobster. She eventually leaves after a falling out with Dimitri's sister Viktoria. She then travels to Novosibirsk to hunt and interrogate Strigoi in the hopes of finding Dimitri. When she does meet him, he takes her hostage and refuses to kill her. Instead, he says he will keep her until she decides to turn Strigoi to be with him. All the while, Rose keeps checking up with Lissa back at St. Vladimir's through the bond. Avery, a secret Spirit user, has been using compulsion to control Lissa. During a visit to Lissa's mind, Rose gets pushed out by Avery. Rose eventually manages to escape, grabbing a stake on the way out. Dimitri catches up with her, and they battle on a bridge, where Rose plunges her stake into his chest. Exhausted, Rose ends up at the home of an Alchemist friend of Sydney's, and Abe is there too. When she wakes up, she realizes Lissa is in danger with Avery, who wants to kill Lissa and then heal her back so that Lissa would be \\"shadow-kissed\\" and bonded to Avery. With help from Oksana, Rose manages to guide Lissa and Adrian through the fight against Avery and her brother, Reed, and Avery's guardian Simon. Abe gets her a plane ticket home. Back at St. Vladimir's, Rose reunites with Lissa and shares what happened to her in Russia. After agreeing to re-enroll in school to graduate, Rose goes back to her normal life at St. Vladmir's. However, she soon receives a package from Russia, enclosed with the stake she used on Dimitri, and a note from him saying he was not really staked properly, and is still alive, waiting for Rose to finish school to find him. Rose realizes that with Dimitri still a Strigoi, she has a chance to restore him to his former life. Spirit Bound begins with Rose passing her final exams. She plots with Lissa and Eddie to break Victor Dashkov out of his high security vampire prison. Once they succeed, Victor agrees to lead them to his brother, Robert, a reclusive spirit user who is rumored to have once returned a Strigoi to their original state. Robert tells them that the Spirit user must infuse a stake with Spirit and kill the Strigoi on its own. Lissa and Christian are kidnapped by Dimitri as bait for Rose. Rose leads a group of guardians to his hiding place and fights her way over to him. She is about to kill him when Christian encircles him in a ring of fire, while Lissa stakes him. Dimitri is restored as a Dhampir. He pushes Rose away, saying that he is no longer able to love. Rose turns to Adrian for comfort. The next morning at breakfast, Rose and Dimitri run into each other. In the middle of the discussion, a group of Guardians surround Rose, and Dimitri instinctively fights to protect her, but she calms him down. The Guardians announce her that Queen Tatiana has been found murdered with Rose's stake and she is to come with them. Last Sacrifice starts with Rose being broken out of prison. Dimitri and Rose go to West Virginia with Sydney and decide to find Lissa's half-sibling. The only person with the information they need in an old teacher, Sonya Karp, who is now a Strigoi. Victor and Robert join them and Robert stakes Sonya, turning her back into a Moroi. Rose then takes Sonya to find Lissa's half-sibling. They discover it is Jill Mastrano, an old friend from the academy. Victor and Robert kidnap her. Meanwhile, Lissa is put in the running for Queen. Rose, Dimitri and Sonya find Victor and Robert and get Jill back, but Rose accidentally kills Victor during a fight. Dimitri comforts her and they confess their love for one another. They then make love again in a luxurious hotel. It is revealed that Tasha murdered the Queen as she disliked her policies, and framed Rose because she was jealous of her relationship with Dimitri. Tasha shoots Rose while attempting to escape. When she recovers, she is no longer bonded with Lissa. The series ends with Lissa becoming Queen and Dimitri and Rose together.

It aided collectors of comic books, Star Trek, movie memorabilia, pulp magazines, and baseball cards. Comic fandom historian Sean Kleefeld has dubbed it \\"an ersatz Better Business Bureau for the comic fandom industry while it was moving from amateur to professional capabilities.\\"Comic Book Fanthropology, A Brief History, Part 2 Origins WSA was started by Stanley Blair, a retired accountant and publisher of Stan's Weekly Express (also known as WE), an early adzine for collectors started in 1969. When one of the advertisers proved fraudulent Blair took it upon himself to gather evidence and cooperate with appropriate authorities in the capture and prosecution of the defrauder, with restitution made to the victims. Blair had personal expenses of just over $200 for pursuing the case. Ron Frantz notes \\"The grateful victims took up a collection without [Blair's] knowledge. The funds exceeded Blair's actual expenses. This money was placed in a special account for the investigation of future mail frauds.\\" At this time Blair created the WE Reporting Bureau and WE Seal of Approval, \\"dedicated to fair play in the hobby and suggested professional methods of doing business by mail\\".Frantz. p.54 After an illness and the emergence of The Buyer's Guide for Comics Fandom (TBG) as the main marketplace for comic book back issue advertising, Blair shut down his magazine in 1973 with issue no.100/102 and under the umbrella of the National Central Bureau (NCB) devoted full-time to the WSA Program and associated activities. Development and growth Membership in the WSA program initially was free, although dues eventually were instituted to help defray the expenses of the all volunteer staff. Members were assigned a membership number which they were to display in all hobbyist advertising. The number was part of the distinctive WSA logo, a small square with the words National Central Bureau along the top three sides and WSA in large letters in the center and the membership number along the bottom edge. Gary Cifra recalls as a mail order book comic book dealer in the 1970s that receiving a WSA number was seen as \\"officially recognizing my sales, condition grading and advertising integrity.\\"The Man Behind Kids on Paper WSA investigated all mail fraud cases brought to their attention, whether the parties involved were members or not. As of 1976 there were over 800 active members.Frantz. p.121 Initially members were kept informed of WSA activities via the NCB Report, fifteen of which were issued between Nov. 1973 and January 1975, along with alerts sent to members who had submitted self-addressed stamped envelopes to receive them. Also TBG as the official organ of the group regularly published the \\"WSA News & Report\\" column written by the administrator. The publishers of the fanzines Rocket's Blast/Comics Collector, TBG, and Xenophile formed an alliance negotiated with WSA whereupon if Blair informed them of mail fraud by an individual that person's advertising privileges would be withdrawn. Also whenever they received fraud complaints these, along with supporting documents, were forwarded to WSA. Over the years WSA worked with various governmental investigative and prosecuting entities, including the Federal Trade Commission, the Postal Inspection Service, Federal Bureau of Investigation, plus various Congress members and state Attorneys General. Ron Frantz noted \\"One-third of the cases were simple disputes between buyer and seller, resulting from misunderstandings, personal problems, or postal delays. The remaining cases involved situations where intent to defraud was clearly established. Many of the cases involved multiple complaints against the same defendant\\".Frantz. p.99 Blair's old adzine, now an organ for WSA and strictly known as WE, was revived in 1976 with issue 103 and a paid circulation of 350; it lasted until at least issue 138 (1980). Dissension and eventual dissolution In later years the organization got embroiled in internal dissension along with getting caught up in the infamous Alan Light/Gary Groth feud. A directory of members provided the basis of The Fandom Directory published for over two decades by Harry Hopkins and which precipitated a falling out between Blair and Hopkins. WSA also had somewhat contentious relations with the Star Trek Welcommittee. By the early 1980s the organization began fading into obscurity. To some extent the CBG Customer Service Award instituted by Krause Publications when they took over publishing Comics Buyer's Guide in 1983 served a function similar to the WSA logo, signifying an advertiser had a clean bill of health. And the legacy of WSA includes, as Frantz notes, that \\"over a period of fifteen years, more than $100,000 was collected and returned to mail-fraud victims\\".Frantz. p.167 Some copies of WE are held at the Michigan State University Comic Art Collection, along with various WSA program materials.

A yellow Frillback. The colors of standard Frillbacks fall into six color categories. # Self ‚Äì white, black, recessive red, yellow # Pattern ‚Äì recessive red mottle, yellow mottle, rosewing, whiteside # Grizzle ‚Äì red, yellow, blue, silver # Shield marked ‚Äì red, yellow, blue-black bar, silver-dun bar, mealy ash-red bar, ash-cream bar # ARC ‚Äì Any rare color # ARCP ‚Äì Any rare color pattern ARC and ARCP Frillbacks must be entered by at least 3 exhibitors in 3 of 5 American Frillback shows for 3 years, with judging score progress, before it is deemed appropriate. Frillbacks produce many different colors that are not recognized by the AFC because they are not standard and do not reproduce consistently. Frillbacks can carry numerous colors in many different patterns such as pied. These colors are not recognized as standard but are very common. Size Frillbacks are slightly larger than other colored pigeon breeds, with long tail and wing feathers. Head Shell-crest and plain-head are found in all colors of Frillbacks. A plain-headed Frillback should have a slightly oval head with no flat areas and a forehead that has a distinct stop at the wattle. A shell- crested Frillback should have a thick shell crest on the back of the head with rosettes on each side. The crest should stand off the head. Eyes The eyes should be in line with the beak. A reddish-orange is desired in all colors except shield marked. Shield marked desire a black or \\"bull-eye\\". While pearl, gravel, and cracked eyes occur, they are not desirable and are considered major faults. Beak The beak of a Frillback is long, with the upper beak often being slightly longer than the lower beak. The beak is dark on red and blue grizzles, black on blacks, light on yellow, horn on silver, and flesh colored on all other standard colors. The wattle is thin and white on all colors. Muff The muff of a Frillback will vary, however, 2 to 3 inches is a desirable length. Frill The curl of a Frillback covers its entire wing shield. No areas should be uncovered. The last row of curls spans the entire length of the wing. Frills form a distinct ringlet curl at the end. The bottom of the muff is also frilled. Tail and flight feathers have a distinct wrinkle.

The recorded magnitudes of the two main quakes were 5.9 and 5.8 , respectively, giving a composite magnitude of 6.1 .. There were no human fatalities, but 30 injuries were reported and a number of sheep were killed. The epicenter of the earthquake was between the towns of Hverager√∞i and Selfoss, about east-southeast of the capital, Reykjav√≠k. It was the strongest earthquake to hit Iceland since the summer of 2000..  Characteristics  Iceland straddles the mid-Atlantic ridge where the Eurasian and North-American tectonic plates move away from each other. Volcanic activity is common along such divergent boundaries but strong earthquakes are rare. In Iceland the ridge is somewhat off-set, creating two transform faults where plates move horizontally along each other. One is in the north of the country and one in the south; the strongest Icelandic earthquakes happen along those transform faults. The 29 May quake is classified by geologists as typical Su√∞urlandsskj√°lftar (literally: Southern Iceland quakes), which happen on the southern fault.  Damage  Unlike the quakes in the summer of 2000, the 29 May quake happened in the most densely populated part of the South Iceland district. The population of the affected area is about 12,000 and it includes the towns of Selfoss and Hverager√∞i as well as Eyrarbakki, Stokkseyri and √ûorl√°ksh√∂fn. Many farms were also affected.

The success of the abbey may be inferred from the foundation of a daughter house, Sibton Abbey, Suffolk, as soon as 1150.Documented in Sibton Abbey Cartularies and Charters i-iv, (Woodbridge: Suffolk Records Society) 1985-88, especially the Introduction, pt i. The village of Old Warden, Bedfordshire grew up under the Abbey's protection. Great accumulated Cistercian wealth enabled Wardon Abbey to be rebuilt on a grand scale in the early fourteenth century, with complex tiling in carpet- patterns and pictorial vignettes pieced together in shaped tiles that approached a boldly scaled mosaic.\\"pseudo-mosaic\\" in Baker 1987:365; Baker discusses remnants of richly stamped and incised tile floors of the abbey church and the abbot's lodgings or infirmary, close in style to the nearly intact paving in Prior Craudon's Chapel at Ely, 1324-25. Gilding of the carved details was so lavishly laid on that in 1848, after demolition and burial, recovered fragments retained their brightness.Noted in Baker 1987:379. By 1252 the monks had more land under cultivation than they could work by their own labour in the early Cistercian way: nineteen granges were recorded in that year. From the orchards at Wardon came the Warden pear, rated the best of English pears, and so distinctive that a pie made from them was a \\"wardon pie\\": \\"I must have Saffron to colour the Warden Pies\\" (Shakespeare, The Winter's Tale iv.3). In Two Fifteenth-Century Cookery-Books, edited by Thomas Austin for the Early English Text Society (Original Series, Volume 91), a recipe is given (p. 51) for \\"Quyncis or Wardouns in past\\". The later fourteenth century was a period of retrenchment and decline, in the wake of the Black Death. Wardon Abbey was dissolved in 1537 under Henry VIII, and the estate was sold for ¬£389 16s 6d. The new owner demolished most of the buildings in 1552 to sell the materials, and then built a new red brick mansion, bearing the name Warden Abbey House. Later in 1790, most of this Tudor house was pulled down by its owners, the Whitbreads of nearby Southill,Baker 1987:372, notes the extensive antiquarian excavations undertaken at Wardon Abbey by W. H. Whitbread in the 1830s, of which none of the finds are now traceable. leaving only a north-east wing, which still stands today.

In the course of his work, Traill hiked throughout most the island and as a result became a source of information on the biota of the island for botanists and zoologists. Traill was born in Ringaringa, Stewart Island. He attended primary school at Halfmoon Bay School in Oban and high school at Southland Boys' High School in Invercargill, on the South Island. He was a fisherman by trade, and in January 1915 he was enlisted in the New Zealand Army and sent to Egypt to fight in World War I. In 1916, he was wounded in the Battle of the Somme and hospitalised in England. Traill returned to New Zealand in 1917. In 1925, Traill began working for the State Forest Service and the Department of Lands and Survey on Stewart Island. He travelled by foot across most parts of the island and was primarily responsible for preventing people from hunting the native bird species. In spite of his responsibilities, Traill later admitted to having made stew out of a number of bird species, including the weka and the kaka. Traill was also active in attempting to exterminate any wild mammals that had managed to arrive on the island. Traill marked many tracks on Stewart Island that are still used today, including one from Halfmoon Bay to Port Pegasus. With his knowledge of the island, he was able to assist botanists, zoologists, and conservationists who were studying the biota of Stewart Island later in his career. Traill retired in 1958 and continued to live in Oban with his son. In the 1963 New Year Honours, he was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire, for services to the Stewart Island community.

However, other ingredients such as kongnamul (soybean sprouts), mideodeok (ÎØ∏ÎçîÎçï, Styela clava), and minari (ÎØ∏ÎÇòÎ¶¨, water dropwort) also play an important role in giving agujjim a refreshing and fragrant flavor. The fish is an excellent source of protein and a has rich taste as well as a palatable chewy texture.  History  Its origins are known to be a fish market in the city of Masan, South Gyeongsang Province where local fishermen would ask cooks from the market eateries to create a tasty dish from the ugly fish. Until the 1940s, the fish was not eaten and was frequently discarded due to its ugly appearance and low commercial value. However, as fish began to become more scarce in the late 20th century, the newly found delicacy became popular. Agujjim is still considered a local specialty of Masan, especially around the Odong-dong district. In the traditional Masan agujjim, agwi dried for 15 days to 30 days is used and then marinated with seasonings, while other regions use fresh agwi after its internal organs have been taken out. Seoul has two famous agujjim streets, in Sinsa-dong and the Jongno district. The popular jjim dish is eaten with bowls of cooked rice, or sometimes restaurants will stir-fry the remaining sauce with rice and additional vegetables on the grill to make bokkeumbap with a crispy charred crust.

It is fed by several rivers, the largest of which is the Yakoun River, and is connected to the open sea of the Dixon Entrance by the narrow Masset Sound and Masset Harbour, which opens onto McIntyre Bay. The communities of Port Clements and Sewall are located on the shores of Masset Inlet. The community of Juskatla is located on Juskatla Inlet, the largest of Masset Inlet's arms. There are several islands in the inlet, the largest of which is Kumdis Island, at the inlet's egress to Masset Sound and just north of Port Clements. Masset Inlet helps form the isthmus of the Naikoon Peninsula. According to Walbran Masset Inlet (as well as Masset Island, Masset Sound and the village of Masset) came from the Haida word Masst, meaning \\"large island\\". Captain Douglas, on his second visit from Nootka Sound aboard the Iphigenia on June 19, 1789 named the bay leading to the inlet McIntyre's Bay. This name was used on the charts of Dixon and Meares. The American traders called the inlet Hancock's River as shown in Ingraham's chart of 1792 after the American brig Hancock. In 1853 H.N. Knox of the Royal Navy, mate on HMS Virago did a sketch survey of the harbour when the name Masset was adopted by the British. A survey was made in 1907 by Captain Learmouth on HMS Egeria.

From the 1890s to the 1950s, Port Pegasus was the site of a small fishing community. There was also a small tin-mining boom in the area in the 1890s. Today, there is no settlement at Port Pegasus, but the location is frequented by tourists, fishermen, hunters, and divers. In 1809, when William W. Stewart visited and mapped the island that was later named after him, he named the small bay \\"South Port\\". Later, it was renamed \\"Port Pegasus\\" to commemorate the Pegasus, Stewart's ship. The brig Pegasus was the former Pegaso, captured at the Peruvian port of Trujillo on 28 July 1807 by the British frigate , commanded by Captain Charles James Johnston, during a cruise against Spanish shipping and ports along the coasts of Spanish America. Johnston dispatched the Pegaso to Port Jackson, where she arrived at the end of October.John Harris to Anna Jos√©pha King, 25/10/1807, Historical Records of New South Wales, Sydney, Vol.VI, 1898, p.348.

A few months later she was acquired by Thomas Moore and in May of that year she was made ready to go on the sealing trade to the southern part of New Zealand. This expedition took place between August 1808 and March 1809, when Pegasus was commanded by Captain Eber Bunker.John O'C.

Stearns, 113 U.S. 435 (1885) Justia.com This description, thus remaining, refers to land already at the date of the deed set off to the Indian chief Buffalo and described in an existing document in the archives of the government, and cannot possibly therefore embrace the tract subsequently selected and designated and described in the patent of October 23, 1858. And the references which must be relied on to furnish any description whatever for the land conveyed by the deed, when applied, result simply in restoring to the deed the particular description by boundaries which for imputed error had for purposes of interpretation been struck out. The case is not one to which the maxim invoked for the construction of the deed can be applied. That rule of interpretation, which rejects erroneous particulars of description where what is left sufficiently identifies the subject of the grant, is adopted in aid of the intention of the grantor, as gathered from the instrument itself, read in the light of the circumstances in which it was written. But here it is expressly found as a fact by the court, in reference to the land originally selected by Buffalo and described in the deed from Armstrong to the plaintiff, and So that the description of the land in the deed which it is sought to reject, because it is inconsistent with that of the patent, is an accurate and not an erroneous description of the land intended by the parties to be embraced and conveyed by the deed from Armstrong to the plaintiff.

Following his high school days at Sequoyah High School in Doraville, Georgia, Beard was drafted by the Athletics in the sixth round of the 1977 amateur draft. After two strong minor league seasons in three years, Beard was promoted to the Athletics and made his major league debut at age 20 on July 16, 1980, pitching the ninth inning of a loss to the Tigers. He appeared in twelve more games that season, all in relief, and earned one save and one loss on the season, posting an earned run average of 3.38. The Athletics tended to use him in games they were losing; in fact, his team was on top only twice when he was summoned to the mound, and their only win in a game where Beard appeared was when he earned his lone save on August 1 against the Cleveland Indians. In 1981, Beard was called up to the big leagues when rosters expanded September 1, and he appeared in eight games over the final month, collecting three more saves and his first big league win, which came in the first game of a doubleheader against the Toronto Blue Jays on September 22, when he held Toronto scoreless for the final 5 innings of an extra inning tilt. He made two postseason appearances with the playoff- bound A's. His first appearance was a 1-inning save to close out the Divisional Series against the Kansas City Royals. However, his ALCS appearance versus the New York Yankees would be less successful; he allowed three earned runs in of an inning in game 2 as the Yankees swept the A's out of the playoffs. Still, Beard impressed enough to earn a roster spot for 1982, when he spent nearly the entire season in the big leagues for the first time, going 10‚Äì9 with 11 saves and a 3.44 ERA. However, injury hit in 1983, and Beard struggled to a 5.61 ERA and a 5‚Äì5 record while posting 10 more saves. After the season, Oakland parted ways with Beard, trading him to the Seattle Mariners with Bob Kearney in exchange for Darrel Akerfelds and Bill Caudill. With Seattle in 1984, Beard had injury issues again, with 37 days between big league appearances at one point during the season. He went 3‚Äì2 with only five saves and an even higher ERA of 5.80. They released him after spring training in 1985, but he was signed by Cleveland less than two weeks later. After 16 appearances with their AAA club in Maine, Cleveland shipped Beard to the Cubs organization in exchange for Tom Grant. Beard posted a sparkling 0.56 ERA in 11 games for the Cubs AAA team in Iowa, posting two wins and three saves, before being called up to the big leagues again when rosters expanded in September. He managed just a 6.39 ERA in nine appearances and was released after the season. The Atlanta Braves signed Beard as a free agent in December 1985. He spent all of 1986 with their AAA team before again opting for free agency. Beard was out of baseball for 14 months before signing with the Tigers. He then spent all of 1988 and much of 1989 as a starting pitcher in Detroit's farm system, working his way back to the majors again. He made his first start since June 29, 1982 when the Tigers called him up for a July 18 game in the 1989 season. Unfortunately for Beard, four unearned runs scored early due to a Doug Strange error, and his day did not get much better. He took the loss in what would be his penultimate major league contest. His final appearance was three days later, and after allowing two runs in of an inning, Beard found himself back in the minors. He was released after the 1989 season and subsequently retired.

Rehn was born in 1849, in the village of Allendorf, the youngest of five children. After the visiting the convent school in Bad Hersfeld, he studied medicine at the University of Marburg from 1869 to 1874, where he became a member of the student corps Hasso-Nassovia. Career Rehn served as a volunteer in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-71. In 1875, he received his doctorate from University of Marburg and started to practice at Griesheim near Frankfurt am Main and later in R√∂delheim. While there in 1880, he carried out the first thyroidectomy. He became a general practitioner and moved on to open a small private surgical clinic in Frankfurt at 28 years old. In 1886, Ludwig Rehn became surgical director of the Frankfurt State Hospital. In 1895 Rehn reported cases of bladder cancer with workers, and people downriver of the local aniline factories. The risk from aromatic amines, particularly benzidine and a-and √ü-naphthylamine, was not well-established until the 1950s. In 1914, he was appointed professor of surgery at the newly founded University of Frankfurt am Main. During the World War I he served as a surgeon general. Rehn was also a member of the scientific senate of the Kaiser Wilhelm Academy in Berlin. Rehn was the first to successfully conduct heart surgery when--on September 7, 1896--he repaired a stab wound suffered by 22-year-old gardener Wilhelm Justus.Blatchford JW. Ludwig Rehn: the first successful cardiorraphy. Ann Thorac Surg 1985;39:492‚Äì5. He died in 1930. His great-grandson G√∂tz Rehn is the founder and current head of Alnatura, a German chain of bio-food markets.  Cardiac Surgery  Ludwig Rehn's most famous surgery occurred on September 7th, 1896. This surgery opened the field of cardiac surgery. Before this successful surgery, wounds of the heart were considered fatal. The patient, Willhelm Justus, was a 22-year-old gardener who had been discharged from the military because of an irregular heartbeat. On September 7th he was wounded by a knife and a passerby found him. He arrived at the State Hospital at 3:30 am. At the hospital, he was described as deathly pale with labored breathing and a barely palpable pulse. He had a non-bleeding 1.5cm wound in the left side of his heart. On September 8th, the patient had developed a hemothorax, a collection of blood in the space between the chest wall and the lung. Orders thus far had been to apply ice bags to the wound and to apply a camphor, a pain relieving, topical cream. Willhelm had a fever of 100.76 ¬∞F and a respiratory rate of 68 breaths/min, a normal one is 12-20 breaths/min. On September 9th, his pulse was weak and irregular, the wound area was increasing, and his respiratory rate raised to 76 breaths/min. Ludwig Rehn began the operation when he saw the suffering patient. Rehn began by making a 14cm long incision along the left side of the patient's heart. He divided the fifth rib and turned it to the sternum to open the chest. Dark blood appeared in the wound. The wound was then grasped together with forceps but was torn in an attempt to keep it closed. The membrane enclosing the heart was opened and exposed the patient's beating heart, a sight not seen by anyone before. Blood continued to flood, however, the 1.5cm wound was found in the right ventricle. Rehn wrote about this experience of seeing a beating heart. He describes how it was unaffected by touch and how the heart made a rolling motion, made possible by its beating. He describes the muscle as hard as a stone when the blood is pumped out (systole) and fill up with blood again (diastole). Rehn began at the left corner of the wound, with a needle and silk, and started to suture the heart. By the third suture, the bleeding had stopped completely. The cavity was irrigated with saline and the rib of the patient was put back into place. The layers of tissue were re-approximated into their original place. The patient survived the surgery after multiple draining of the wound. Ludwig Rehn watched the patient and advised him to not do any hard work. After this surgery, by 1907, Ludwig Rehn could gather 124 instances of heart suture with 60% mortality. This was an improvement to the 90% mortality rate in the pre-surgical era.  Legacy  Ludwig Rehn's most famous surgery occurred on September 7th, 1896. This surgery opened the field of cardiac surgery. Before this successful surgery, wounds of the heart were considered fatal. After his successful cardiac surgery, by 1907, Ludwig Rehn could gather 124 instances of heart suture with 60% mortality. This was an improvement to the 90% mortality rate in the pre-surgical era. His surgery is considered the worldwide first successful direct suture of the heart. Honors In 1911, Rehn was nominated Chairman of the German Association of Surgery. In 1974, the Chamber of Commerce in Frankfurt founded the Ludwig- Rehn-Award for scientific publications in general surgery. Additionally, Ludwig Rehn-Strasse in Frankfurt am Main was named after him.

The term Ambient Vibrations is now preferred to talk about this phenomenon. Observation of microtremors can give useful information on dynamic properties of the site such as predominant period and amplitude. Microtremor observations are easy to perform, inexpensive and can be applied to places with low seismicity as well, hence, microtremor measurements can be used conveniently for seismic microzonation.Nakamura, Y., 1989. A Method for Dynamic Characteristics Estimation of Subsurface Using Microtremor on the Ground Surface. Quarterly Report of RTRI, vol. 30, No. 1, pp. 25‚Äì33. More detailed information on the shear wave velocity profile of the site can be obtained from microtremor array observation.  History  After the pioneering work by Kannai and Tanaka,Tokimatsu, K., 1997. Geotechnical Site Characterization Using Surface Wave. Proc., 1st International Conf. on Earthquake Geotechnical Engineering, 3, pp. 1333‚Äì1367. many researchers have investigated the applicability and reliability of the microtremor method. The major drawback of the method proposed by Kannai and Tanaka was that they considered the Fourier spectra of observed horizontal motions to reflect the transfer function of the surface. It has now been established that the horizontal microtremor spectra often show the characteristics of the source rather than the transfer function of a site. Yukta Nakamura in 1989, modified microtremor analysis by proposing a new technique, generally referred to as the H/V method. In this technique, it was shown that the source effect can be minimized by normalizing the horizontal spectral amplitude with the vertical spectral amplitude. Assuming that the shear wave dominates the microtremor, Nakamura indicated that the horizontal- to-vertical (H/V) spectral ratio of microtremors at a site roughly equals the S-wave transfer function between the ground surface and bedrock at a site. This means that the H/V peak period and peak value itself correspond to the natural site period and amplification factor respectively. This method does not require any boreholes and is, hence, more convenient and inexpensive compared to the traditional borehole method. This method is now widely used for microtremor observation although it lacks a clear theoretical background. Lermo and Chavez-Garcia Lermo, J. and Chavez-Garcia F. J., 1994. Are Microtremors Useful in Site Response Evaluation. Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America, vol. 84, No. 5, pp. 1350‚Äì1364. showed the applicability of Nakamura's method of microtremor in site effect prediction. However, it was found true only for the fundamental resonance peak of the transfer function. The results supported the idea that Nakamura's technique effectively compensated for the site effects. Another technique which known as refraction microtremor is also widely used in earth sciences today.

He served in the Legislative Assembly of Alberta from 1975 to 1993 and held numerous cabinet portfolios in the Government of Alberta. Early life James Deverell Horsman was born in Camrose, Alberta in 1935 to George Cornwall Horsman and Kathleen Deverell Horsman. He grew up in Meeting Creek with his grandparents while his mother and father served overseas in Second World War. His family later moved to Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan. Horsman moved west in the 1950s to study at the University of British Columbia. At UBC, Horsman attained a Bachelor of Commerce degree in 1959 and a year later attained a Bachelor of Laws. During this time Horsman participated in a number of extra curricular activities including a member of UBC Alma Mater Society, the Coordinator of Activities and the Coordinator of Publications. After University Horsman moved back east to Calgary to start practicing law, he moved to Medicine Hat a short time later after visiting family and meeting a potential law partner. After moving to Medicine Hat he met Betty Whitney, a local High School teacher, they would get married on July 4, 1964 and have three daughters. Political career Horsman became involved in the Alberta Progressive Conservatives in the early 1960s. He served on the party's executive council as Vice President for Southern Alberta before running for political office. Horsman first ran for a seat to the 16th Alberta Legislature in the 1967 general election, in the electoral district of Medicine Hat. He was defeated by Social Credit incumbent MLA Harry Leinweber. Horseman would run again in the Medicine Hat- Redcliff electoral district in 1971 and lost to Social Credit candidate William Wyse. Horsman ran against Wyse again in the 1975 general election and was successful this time, defeating him by 100 votes. In 1979 Medicine Hat- Redcliff was abolished due to redistribution, and Horsman ran for re-election in Medicine Hat that year. He won by nearly 8,000 votes over his nearest opponent. Horsman won by another large majority in the 1982 general election. Horsman's share of the vote was cut in half in the 1986 general election, but he still won by a comfortable margin. He won again handily in the 1989 general election. He retired from the Assembly at dissolution in 1993. Horsman would serve a number of roles in provincial cabinet including Minister of Advanced Education and Manpower, Minister of Federal and Intergovernmental Affairs, Attorney General and Provincial Secretary, Government House Leader and Deputy Premier. As Minister of Federal and Intergovernmental Affairs Horsman was responsible for constitutional negotiations for the 10 years following the Patriation of the Constitution until the Charlottetown Accord. Late life After leaving political office, Horsman became Alberta's chief NAFTA negotiator. Horsman continued to serve on numerous other boards and public service roles, including as Chair of the Board of Governors for Medicine Hat College and later as chancellor for the University of Lethbridge from 1999 to 2003. Horsman would be awarded with an honorary Doctor of Laws from the University of Lethbridge. Horsman was number of awards including Queen Elizabeth II Silver and Golden Jubilee Medals, the Governor General‚Äôs 125th Anniversary Medal and the Alberta Centennial Medal. Horsman was appointed as a Member of the Order of Canada on April 6, 2006, his award cited his history in public service, volunteering and advocacy for a strong public education system. As a Member of the Order of Canada Horsman has continued to preside over citizenship ceremonies in the Southern Alberta region.

To execute slap bunting, the player is almost always in the back of the left-hand side of home plate, feet slightly open to right field, and choked up slightly on the bat. The moment the pitch is released from the pitcher's hand, the player must rotate his hips toward the pitcher and then cross his back (left) foot over his front foot, moving up to the very front edge of the batter's box. His shoulders should face the pitcher at this point. If the pitch is in the strike zone, the batter should then extend his arms so that the bat is at the correct angle for where he wants to place the ball -- the barrel trailing the hands if he wants the ball to go to the left side of the field, and the opposite if he wants it to go to the right. The technique is quite common in softball because of the difficulty of getting a hit with a pitcher only away. By already being in the front of the batter's box with the batter's body turned halfway toward first base, the batter already has some momentum toward first base and might be in better position to get a base hit. The technique is often successful in sacrifice circumstances, where the placement of the ball could help advance a runner already on base. It is also often used when batters are having difficulty getting a hit off of a difficult pitcher, or when they have a better opportunity of getting on base because of the slap bunt than a hit, perhaps because of the player's running speed. Some advanced players might perform a slap hit, which is the same technique except that the player swings to place the ball in an infield hole or over the infielders' heads.

Progressive collapses may be accidental, due to design deficiencies, fire, unintentional overload, material failure or natural phenomenon (e.g. erosion, wind or earthquakes). They can also be induced deliberately as a demolition method - specifically building implosion. They may also be caused by acts of terrorism or war. Initiating factors behind notable examples * On July 14, 1902, the 323 foot St Mark's Campanile in Venice, Italy collapsed after its northern load-bearing wall began to separate from the main structure. The cause of the separation was attributed to over 700 years of wear on the structure, including fires, earthquakes, and stress-redistribution, primarily from drying-induced shrinkage on the wooden support beams, the bells themselves swaying back and forth, and creep. No one was injured except for a cat belonging to a caretaker. The tower was a stonemasonry design.A study on St. Mark's Campanile can be found in Northwestern Universities civil engineering archive and a study about the effects of aging on ancient medieval bell towers was released by the University of Pisa in 2001. * On November 1, 1966, the 7 story University of Aberdeen Zoology Department building in Aberdeen, Scotland suffered a total collapse while under construction. The collapse was attributed to poor girder welds that were weakened by metal fatigue. The metal fatigue was induced by oscillating lateral forces on the structure (primarily wind). Five people were killed and three others were injured. The building was a steel-frame design and the first known example of the total progressive collapse of a steel-framed building.An engineering overview on the collapse with articles from The Scotsman is available. An article on the collapse can also be found in The St. Petersburg Times as well as in the Hansard Archives HERE and HERE * On May 16, 1968, the 22 story Ronan Point apartment tower in West Ham, London suffered a fatal collapse of one of its corners due to a natural-gas explosion, which destroyed a load-bearing wall. 4 people were killed and 17 others were injured. The building was a large-panel system building. * On March 2, 1973, the 26 story Skyline Towers Building in Fairfax County, Virginia, collapsed as a result of wooden shoring being removed too soon from an upper-story floor during construction. 14 people were killed and 34 others were injured. The tower was a steel-reinforced concrete design. * On December 19, 1985, the 22 storyAlthough certain articles claim the building was a 21-story building and others claim it to be a 22-story building, the ultimate height of the building was attained by looking up renter addresses for \\"1000 Wilshire Blvd 22nd Floor\\" There are renter addresses listed up to the 22nd floor but not higher commercial office building at 1000 Wilshire Blvd, Los Angeles, currently known as the Wedbush Building,1000 Wilshire Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90017 was named the Wedbush Building in January 2002 experienced a partial collapse of the structure. Construction crews were offloading recently arrived steel girders from a flatbed truck on to the deck of the newly completed 5th floor via crane when a girder broke loose from the crane and fell down on to the current stockpile below, which was already loaded to twice the maximum designed load capacity of the floor. This initiated a progressive collapse of the overloaded floor, causing the floor section and girders to crash through the 4th, 3rd, 2nd, and 1st floors, finally coming to rest in the parking garage. Three people were killed. The building was a steel-frame design.The location of the office building was at 1000 Wilshire Blvd. in Los Angeles and consisted of a 5 floor collapse * On March 15, 1986, the 6 story Hotel New World in Little India, Singapore collapsed due to a design error when the structural engineer forgot to add the building's dead load (the weight of the building itself) to his calculations when determining how strong he needed to make the support pillars that held up the building during its construction in 1971.A documentary about the Hotel New World collapse is available on YouTube 33 people were killed and 17 others were injured. The building was a steel-reinforced concrete design. * On April 23, 1987, the 16 story L'Ambiance Plaza in Bridgeport, Connecticut, collapsed during its construction phase due to various instances of inadequate shoring that were in use throughout the construction site.The L'Ambiance Plaza case can be found on Engineering.com 28 people were killed. The building was a lift-slab design. * On March 17, 1989, the 255 foot Pavia Civic Tower in Pavia, Italy collapsed due to 800 years of stress-redistribution on the structure, primarily from drying-induced shrinkage on the wooden support beams, the bells themselves swaying back and forth, and creep.A study on Pavia Civic Tower can be found in Northwestern Universities civil engineering archive and a study about the effects of aging on ancient medieval bell towers was released by the University of Pisa in 2001. 4 people were killed and 15 others were injured.

The cause was attributed to hundreds of years of stress-redistribution on the structure, primarily from drying-induced shrinkage on the wooden support beams, the bells themselves swaying back and forth in the centuries prior, creep, and weathering on the exposed and unmaintained masonry, including crack enlargement from water freezing and expanding between stones in the winter months, causing further expansion of cracks. No one was injured. The tower was a stonemasonry design.Reference to the church of St Maria Magdalena can be found in a study about the effects of aging on ancient medieval bell towers, which was released by the University of Pisa in 2001. * On April 19, 1995, the 9 story Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, collapsed due to a truck bomb that was detonated outside of the southern facade. The bomb's compression wave caused floors 4 and 5 to shear up and off their columns and collapse onto floor 3. Floor 3 was connected to the main transfer beam, and pulled it inwards when floors 4 and 5 fell on it. This caused all the vertical columns on the southern perimeter that were connected to the transfer beam to collapse as well, along with any floor sections that depended on those columns for vertical support. Similar to the collapse of the World Trade Center, the Oklahoma City Bombing was the first known example of a terrorist-initiated progressive collapse of a building on US soil. 168 people were killed and 680 others were injured. The building was a steel-reinforced concrete design.A documentary about the Murrah Federal Building collapse is available on YouTube. Note that the building floors in this documentary are referred to by British Convention and will thus be one floor less than the American name for each floor.The NIST has released a summary and a report on the bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building and its collapse. * On June 29, 1995, the 5 story Sampoong Department Store in Seoul, South Korea collapsed. The collapse was due to the removal of several support columns on the lower floors in order to make room for escalators. This lack of structural support was worsened years later by the addition of several heavy air conditioners on the roof above the area where support columns had been removed. This caused the support column that was closest to the air conditioners to fail and pass its load onto nearby columns, which led to complete failure and collapse within 24 hours of major cracks appearing around the failed column.A documentary about the Sampoong Department Store collapse is available on YouTube 501 people were killed and 937 others were injured. The complex was a steel-reinforced concrete design. * On September 11, 2001, World Trade Center buildings 1, 2 and 7 in New York City collapsed as a result of terrorist attacks and the resulting fires. After a 3-year investigation by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, it was concluded that fire weakened the steel structure until the long bridge-like floor sections (called trusses) began to progressively sag. This sagging converted the downwards pull of the trusses into an inwards pull. This intensifying inwards pull on the walls eventually caused the outer columns of Tower 2, and later the inner columns of Tower 1, to buckle and fold, thus initiating the collapses.NIST has published a final report on the causes of the World Trade Center collapse. 2,752 people died in the buildings, including 157 passengers and crew members who were aboard two hijacked airplanes that struck buildings 1 and 2, initiating fires in both, with debris initiating fires in building 7 upon the collapse of buildings 1 and 2. The buildings were a steel-frame design. Progressive failure of the floor systems, or so-called \\"pancake theory,\\" was ruled out as the initiating factor of the structural failure, but was found by both FEMA and NIST scientists to be the primary mode of failure after collapse initiation. * On February 12, 2005, the 28 story Windsor Tower in Madrid, Spain suffered the collapse of the upper 11 floors of the building. The tower had a reinforced concrete inner-core surrounded by a traditional webbed steel- frame outer-perimeter. Between floors 16 and 17 was a 7-foot thick, reinforced concrete transfer floor, designed to act as a bulkhead and to support the steel framework of the upper 11 stories. An office fire began on the 21st floor and after 5 hours, the concrete inner-core could no longer support the buckling steel outer-framework. The upper 11 stories collapsed down to street level with remnants of the upper 3 floors collapsing down on to the transfer floor. No one was killed. The building was a composite steel-frame and steel- reinforced concrete design.An engineering case study on the Windsor Tower Fire is available. *On August 1, 2007, the I-35W Mississippi River Bridge collapsed during afternoon rush hour, resulting in the deaths of 13 people. The collapse was attributed to the failure of a gusset plate connecting two members within one of the main arch ribs. Failure of this fracture-critical joint resulted in total collapse of the structure. * On 24 April 2013, the 8 story Rana Plaza commercial office complex in Savar, Bangladesh, suffered a collapse to the majority of the structure. The building was originally designed to accommodate shops and offices with light foot traffic but had been converted into a factory with heavy garment manufacturing equipment on the upper floors. This equipment acted like a mild tamping rammer by inducing oscillating forces to the building's frame. The use of substandard construction materials along with the weight of the workers and machinery (which together exceeded the original designed load capacity of the floors), contributed to the weakening and eventual failure of key structural elements. The final collapse occurred one day after preliminary cracks began to appear throughout the building, suggesting that a key structural element had failed and was passing its load forces onto surrounding elements. 1,129 people died in the building and approximately 2,515 people were injured. The incident is considered to be the deadliest garment-factory accident in history, as well as the deadliest accidental structural failure in modern human history.https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/bangladesh/10014778/Bangladesh- building-collapse-kills-at-least-82-in- Dhaka.htmlhttps://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-22394094 The Plasco Building at the moment of collapse. * On 19 January 2017, the Plasco Building, a high- rise building in Tehran, Iran, caught fire and collapsed. The fire started on the eighth floor and the progressive collapse occurred during rescue operations. According to fire department spokesperson, Jalaal Maleki, around 200 firefighters were on the scene. It was reported that Plasco building progressive collapse was a pancake type because the collapse occurred straight down http://s3.picofile.com/file/8283609584/resistance.JPG the collapse appeared similar to WTC tower collapse. http://s7.picofile.com/file/8283613376/wiki.JPG 16 firefighters and 10 civilians died as a result of the fire and collapsehttp://s4.picofile.com/file/8284076692/Firefighters_in_building_view.mov.html Terminology Since the resulting damage in a progressive collapse is disproportionate to the original cause, the term disproportionate collapse is frequently used in engineering to describe this collapse type. The first date- recorded instance of the term pancake collapse being published in lieu of \\"progressive collapse\\" occurred in the August 10, 1980, edition of the New York Times. Fire Chief John Connelly of the 19th Battalion explained that the apartment building, which they responded to in the Bronx, had been weakened by fire to the point that all floors had begun to pancake down on one another. \\"'It was a pancake collapse.' said Chief John Connelly of the 19th Battalion. 'The entire building was flaming and it went down to the ground.'\\"The full Pay-Per-View article on the Bronx fire is available through the New York Times Model code changes Based on recommendations from the Commerce Department's National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), a comprehensive set of building code changes were approved by the International Code Council (ICC). The recommendations were based on the findings of NIST's three-year investigation of the collapses of New York City's World Trade Center (WTC) towers on Sept. 11, 2001. The proposals addressed areas such as increased resistance to building collapse from fire and other incidents, use of sprayed fire-resistive materials (commonly known as \\"fireproofing\\"), performance and redundancy of fire protection systems (i.e., automatic sprinklers), fuel oil storage/piping, elevators for use by first responders and evacuating occupants, the number and location of stairwells, and exit path markings. The model code changes consistent with the NIST WTC investigation recommendations that are now required by the IBC include: *Increased bond strength for fireproofing (nearly three times greater than previously required for buildings in height and seven times greater for buildings more than in height). *Field installation requirements for fireproofing to ensure that: **installation complies with the manufacturer's instructions; **the substrates (surfaces being fireproofed) are clean and free of any condition that prevents adhesion; **testing is conducted to demonstrate that required adhesion is maintained for primed, painted or encapsulated steel surfaces; and **the finished condition of the installed fireproofing, upon complete drying or curing, does not exhibit cracks, voids, spalls, delamination or any exposure of the substrate. *Special field inspections of fireproofing to ensure that its as-installed thickness, density and bond strength meet specified requirements, and that a bonding agent is applied when the bond strength is less than required due to the effect of a primed, painted or encapsulated steel surface. The inspections are to be performed after the rough installation of mechanical, electrical, plumbing, sprinkler and ceiling systems. *Increasing by one hour the fire-resistance rating of structural components and assemblies in buildings and higher.

Soft X-rays have energies in the 0.09 to 2.5 keV range, whereas hard X-rays are in the 1‚Äì20 keV range. SSSs emit few or no photons with energies above 1 keV, and most have effective temperature below 100 eV. This means that the radiation they emit is highly ionizing and is readily absorbed by the interstellar medium. Most SSSs within our own galaxy are hidden by interstellar absorption in the galactic disk. They are readily evident in external galaxies, with ~10 found in the Magellanic Clouds and at least 15 seen in M31. As of early 2005, more than 100 SSSs have been reported in ~20 external galaxies, the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), and the Milky Way (MW). Those with luminosities below ~3 x 1038 erg/s are consistent with steady nuclear burning in accreting white dwarfs (WD)s or post-novae. There are a few SSS with luminosities ‚â•1039 erg/s. Super soft X-rays are believed to be produced by steady nuclear fusion on a white dwarf's surface of material pulled from a binary companion, the so-called close-binary supersoft source (CBSS). This requires a flow of material sufficiently high to sustain the fusion. Contrast this with the nova, where less flow causes the material to only fuse sporadically. Super soft X-ray sources can evolve into type Ia supernova, where a sudden fusion of material destroys the white dwarf, and neutron stars, through collapse. Super soft X-ray sources were first discovered by the Einstein Observatory. Further discoveries were made by ROSAT. Many different classes of objects emit supersoft X-radiation (emission dominantly below 0.5 keV). Luminous supersoft X-ray sources Luminous super soft X-ray sources have a characteristic blackbody temperature of a few tens of eV (~20‚Äì100 eV) and a bolometric luminosity of ~1038 erg/s (below ~ 3 x 1038 erg/s). Apparently, luminous SSXSs can have equivalent blackbody temperatures as low as ~15 eV and luminosities ranging from 1036 to 1038 erg/s. The numbers of luminous SSSs in the disks of ordinary spiral galaxies such as the MW and M31 are estimated to be on the order of 103. Milky Way SSXSs SSXSs have now been discovered in our galaxy and in globular cluster M3. MR Velorum (RX J0925.7-4758) is one of the rare MW super soft X-ray binaries. \\"The source is heavily reddened by interstellar material, making it difficult to observe in the blue and ultraviolet.\\" The period determined for MR Velorum at ~4.03 d is considerably longer than that of other supersoft systems, which is usually less than a day. Close-binary supersoft source (CBSS) The CBSS model invokes steady nuclear burning on the surface of an accreting white dwarf (WD) as the generator of the prodigious super soft X-ray flux. As of 1999, eight SSXSs have orbital periods between ~4 hr and 1.35 d: RX J0019.8+2156 (MW), RX J0439.8-6809 (MW halo near LMC), RX J0513.9-6951 (LMC), RX J0527.8-6954 (LMC), RX J0537.7-7034 (LMC), CAL 83 (LMC), CAL 87 LMC), and 1E 0035.4-7230 (SMC). Symbiotic binary A symbiotic binary star is a variable binary star system in which a red giant has expanded its outer envelope and is shedding mass quickly, and another hot star (often a white dwarf) is ionizing the gas. Three symbiotic binaries as of 1999 are SSXSs: AG Dra (BB, MW), RR Tel (WD, MW), and RX J0048.4-7332 (WD, SMC). Noninteracting white dwarfs The youngest, hottest WD, KPD 0005+5106, is very close to 100,000 K, of type DO and is the first single WD recorded as an X-ray source with ROSAT. Cataclysmic variables \\"Cataclysmic variables (CVs) are close binary systems consisting of a white dwarf and a red-dwarf secondary transferring matter via the Roche lobe overflow.\\" Both fusion- and accretion-powered cataclysmic variables have been observed to be X-ray sources. The accretion disk may be prone to instability leading to dwarf nova outbursts: a portion of the disk material falls onto the white dwarf, the cataclysmic outbursts occur when the density and temperature at the bottom of the accumulated hydrogen layer rise high enough to ignite nuclear fusion reactions, which rapidly burn the hydrogen layer to helium. Apparently the only SSXS nonmagnetic cataclysmic variable is V Sagittae: bolometric luminosity of (1‚Äì10) x 1037, a binary including a blackbody (BB) accretor at T < 80 eV, and an orbital period of 0.514195 d. The accretion disk can become thermally stable in systems with high mass-transfer rates (·πÄ). Such systems are called nova-like (NL) stars, because they lack outbursts characteristic of dwarf novae. VY Scl cataclysmic variables Among the NL stars is a small group which shows a temporary reduction or cessation of ·πÄ from the secondary. These are the VY Scl-type stars or anti- dwarf novae. V751 Cyg V751 Cyg (BB, MW) is a VY Scl CV, has a bolometric luminosity of 6.5 x 1036 erg/s, and emits soft X-rays at quiescence. The discovery of a weak soft X-ray source of V751 Cyg at minimum presents a challenge as this is unusual for CVs which commonly display weak hard X-ray emission at quiescence. The high luminosity (6.5 x 1036 erg/s) is particularly hard to understand in the context of VY Scl stars generally, because observations suggest that the binaries become simple red dwarf + white dwarf pairs at quiescence (the disk mostly disappears). \\"A high luminosity in soft X-rays poses an additional problem of understanding why the spectrum is of only modest excitation.\\" The ratio He II Œª4686/HŒ≤ did not exceed ~0.5 in any of the spectra recorded up to 2001, which is typical for accretion-powered CVs and does not approach the ratio of 2 commonly seen in supersoft binaries (CBSS). Pushing the edge of acceptable X-ray fits toward lower luminosity suggests that the luminosity should not exceed ~2 x 1033 ergs/s, which gives only ~4 x 1031 ergs/s of reprocessed light in the WD about equal to the secondary's expected nuclear luminosity. Magnetic cataclysmic variables X-rays from magnetic cataclysmic variables are common because accretion provides a continuous supply of coronal gas. A plot of number of systems vs. orbit period shows a statistically significant minimum for periods between 2 and 3 hr which can probably be understood in terms of the effects of magnetic braking when the companion star becomes completely convective and the usual dynamo (which operates at the base of the convective envelope) can no longer give the companion a magnetic wind to carry off angular momentum. The rotation has been blamed on asymmetric ejection of planetary nebulae and winds and the fields on in situ dynamos. Orbit and rotation periods are synchronized in strongly magnetized WDs. Those with no detectable field never are synchronized. With temperatures in the range 11,000 to 15,000 K, all the WDs with the most extreme fields are far too cool to be detectable EUV/X-ray sources, e.g., Grw +70¬∞8247, LB 11146, SBS 1349+5434, PG 1031+234 and GD 229. Most highly magnetic WDs appear to be isolated objects, although G 23‚Äì46 (7.4 MG) and LB 1116 (670 MG) are in unresolved binary systems. RE J0317-853 is the hottest magnetic WD at 49,250 K, with an exceptionally intense magnetic field of ~340 MG, and implied rotation period of 725.4 s. Between 0.1 and 0.4 keV, RE J0317-853 was detectable by ROSAT, but not in the higher energy band from 0.4 to 2.4 keV. RE J0317-853 is associated with a blue star 16 arcsec from LB 9802 (also a blue WD) but not physically associated. A centered dipole field is not able to reproduce the observations, but an off-center dipole 664 MG at the south pole and 197 MG at the north pole does. Until recently (1995) only PG 1658+441 possessed an effective temperature > 30,000 K. Its polar field strength is only 3 MG. The ROSAT Wide Field Camera (WFC) source RE J0616-649 has an ~20 MG field. PG 1031+234 has a surface field that spans the range from ~200 MG to nearly 1000 MG and rotates with a period of 3h24m. The magnetic fields in CVs are confined to a narrow range of strengths, with a maximum of 7080 MG for RX J1938.4-4623. None of the single magnetic stars has been seen as of 1999 as an X-ray source, although fields are of direct relevance to the maintenance of coronae in main sequence stars. PG 1159 stars PG 1159 stars are a group of very hot, often pulsating WDs for which the prototype is PG 1159 dominated by carbon and oxygen in their atmospheres. PG 1159 stars reach luminosities of ~1038 erg/s but form a rather distinct class. RX J0122.9-7521 has been identified as a galactic PG 1159 star. Nova There are three SSXSs with bolometric luminosity of ~1038 erg/s that are novae: GQ Mus (BB, MW), V1974 Cyg (WD, MW), and Nova LMC 1995 (WD). Apparently, as of 1999 the orbital period of Nova LMC 1995 if a binary was not known. U Sco, a recurrent nova as of 1999 unobserved by ROSAT, is a WD (74‚Äì76 eV), Lbol ~ (8‚Äì60) x 1036 erg/s, with an orbital period of 1.2306 d. Planetary nebula In the SMC, 1E 0056.8-7154 is a WD with bolometric luminosity of 2 x 1037 that has a planetary nebula associated with it. Super soft active galactic nuclei Supersoft active galactic nuclei reach luminosities up to 1045 erg/s. Large amplitude outbursts Large amplitude outbursts of super soft X-ray emission have been interpreted as tidal disruption events.

Five tropical cyclones were reported during the season, which lasted from late August through the middle of October; these dates fall within the range of most Atlantic tropical cyclone activity, and none of the cyclones coexisted with another. Though there were officially five tropical cyclones in the season, hurricane scholar Michael Chenoweth assessed two of the cyclones as being the same storm. There may have been other unconfirmed tropical cyclones during the season, as meteorologist Christopher Landsea estimated that up to six storms were missed each year from the official database; this estimate was due to small tropical cyclone size, sparse ship reports, and relatively unpopulated coastlines. __TOC__ Season summary Every tropical cyclone in the season was of hurricane status, or with winds at or exceeding 74 mph (119 km/h). In only two other seasons did every cyclone attain hurricane status; those years were 1858 and 1884. All five cyclones affected land; the strongest was the first storm, which caused severe damage and loss of life when it made landfall near the border between Mississippi and Alabama. The second storm of the season struck Puerto Rico, where it caused over 100 deaths, primarily from flooding. In the middle of September, the third storm moved across Florida with strong wind gusts and light rainfall, and a week later the fourth storm passed over or north of the Lesser and Greater Antilles. The last storm hit the Florida Panhandle, though damage was less than expected.

It was first observed on August 19 about 140 mi (230 km) north of Puerto Rico. It moved on a west- northwest motion before passing through the Bahamas as it attained hurricane status on August 20. After paralleling the northern coast of Cuba, the storm passed between the Dry Tortugas and Key West, Florida on August 22, and two days later it is estimated the hurricane attained peak winds of 115 mph (185 km/h). The storm slowed on August 25 before turning northward, and early on August 26 it made landfall near Pascagoula, Mississippi at peak strength, and the hurricane rapidly weakened to tropical storm status as it accelerated east-northeastward. On August 28 it emerged into the Atlantic Ocean from South Carolina, and after turning to the northeast, it was last observed on August 30 about 130 mi (200 km) southeast of Cape Cod. In the Florida Keys, rough waves forced several ships ashore, leaving some damaged. Strong waves created four new channels in the Chandeleur Islands, and the storm's passage also destroyed the island lighthouse; the three keepers were found three days later. Two schooners were also washed ashore along Cat Island. The hurricane produced an estimated storm tide of 12 feet (3.7 m) in Mobile, Alabama, where strong winds damaged much of the city, leaving the majority of the houses destroyed. Trees were downed up to 30 miles (50 km) inland, and coastal areas were flooded. Damage along the coastline was estimated at around $1 million (1852 USD, $26 million 2008 USD), and several lives were lost. While crossing the southeastern United States, the storm brought light rainfall but moderately strong winds; in Charleston, South Carolina, the storm destroyed several bridges and crop fields.Early American hurricanes 1492-1870, David Ludlum, pg 159-160 Hurricane Two Hurricane San Lorenzo of 1852 Early on September 5, a hurricane was first observed about 65 mi (110 km) southeast of Christiansted in the Danish Virgin Islands. One meteorologist assessed the hurricane as being located near Antigua on September 3. Tracking steadily west-northwestward, it quickly moved ashore near Ponce, Puerto Rico with winds estimated at 80 mph (130 km/h). After crossing southwestern Puerto Rico, the hurricane emerged into the Mona Passage as a tropical storm. Late on September 5 it made landfall on eastern Dominican Republic; it quickly weakened over Hispaniola, dissipating on September 6 over the northwestern portion of the island. An assessment by scholar Michael Chenoweth in 2006 indicated this storm was the same as the next hurricane, with it continuing northwestward and ultimately reaching the Gulf of Mexico. Due to not being considered the same cyclone in the official hurricane database, this hurricane and the following hurricane are listed separately. There, the passage of the storm caused severe flooding, which destroyed large quantities of crops and damaged several roads. Storm damage was heaviest between Guayanilla and Mayag√ºez. More than 100 people were killed in Puerto Rico, many of which due to flooding. Hurricane Three A hurricane was located in the central Gulf of Mexico on September 9, potentially the same hurricane as the previous storm. It tracked generally eastward toward the coast of Florida, with its hurricane intensity estimation based on two ship reports. At about 0000 UTC on September 12, it moved ashore near Clearwater, Florida as a minimal hurricane, with an estimated minimum barometric central pressure of 985 mbar. Accelerating east- northeastward while crossing the state, the cyclone emerged into the Atlantic Ocean as a weakened tropical storm before regaining hurricane status on September 13. Later that day, it was last observed about 250 mi (400 km) east- southeast of Cape Hatteras. A post in Fort Meade, Florida reported at least 0.55 in (14 mm) of rainfall during the storm's passage. The hurricane was considered \\"violent\\", and gusts were estimated to have reached hurricane force. Rough seas and strong easterly winds beached a vessel near St. Augustine.Early American hurricanes 1492-1870, David Ludlum, pg 161 Hurricane Four On September 22, a tropical storm was located about 200 mi (330 km) east of Guadeloupe. With a steady west-northwest path, the storm moved across the northern Lesser Antilles on September 23, during which it intensified into a hurricane. It passed a short distance north of Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic as it reached its peak intensity of 90 mph (150 km). Late on September 26 the hurricane turned northwestward, bringing it through the Turks and Caicos Islands and eastern Bahamas. Recurving north- northeastward, the cyclone moved into open waters, and was last classified as a tropical cyclone on September 30 about 390 mi (630 km) east of Cape Hatteras. However, one hurricane researcher assessed the hurricane as lasting until October 3, with the cyclone turning eastward and dissipating near the Azores. Hurricane Five A moderately strong hurricane with winds of 105 mph (165 km/h) was first spotted on October 6 east of Jamaica. Passing a short distance south of the island, the hurricane tracked northwestward and brushed the Yucat√°n Peninsula before turning north-northeastward into the Gulf of Mexico. Late on October 9, it made landfall a short distance east of Apalachicola, Florida at peak winds with an estimated pressure of 969 mbar. Rapidly weakening to tropical storm status, the cyclone continued northeastward and emerged into the Atlantic Ocean from North Carolina on October 11. Later that day, it was last observed about 250 mi (400 km) southeast of Cape Cod. Heavy damage was reported in Jamaica. Upon making landfall in Florida, the hurricane produced a 7 ft (2 m) storm tide, and in Georgia, hurricane-force winds extended into the southwestern portion of the state, while tropical storm force winds occurred along the coastline. In the state, moderate winds damaged trees and roofs, though the destruction was less than anticipated.

It is an invasive plant species in the northeastern United States, parts of the Midwest, southeastern Canada, and California. Description Vincetoxicum nigrum is a perennial, herbaceous vine bearing ovate leaves with pointed tips. The leaves are long, and wide, occurring in pairs on the stem. The flowers have five petals, and are star- shaped with white hairs. The flowers range in color from dark purple to black. The fruit of Vincetoxicum nigrum is a slender, tapered follicle that ranges in color from green through light brown and is tightly packed with seeds, each bearing a fluffy pappus to allow distribution by the wind. Habitat Vincetoxicum nigrum tends to grow in upland areas and is tolerant to variable light, salt, and moisture levels. In the United States, the vine is often found in abandoned fields, hedgerows, brushy areas, woodlands, river banks, transportation corridors, quarries, agricultural fields, and gardens. In gardens, the plant is seen as a fast-growing weed. Reproduction Flowers Vincetoxicum nigrum emerges from an underground stem in the spring, and flowers during June and July. Vincetoxicum nigrum is self-pollinating, and follicles form throughout the summer. The number of follicles formed is directly linked to the amount of light the plant receives. If there is a lower level of light, then there are fewer follicles compared to a plant exposed to a higher level of light. The seeds begin to be released by mid-August, and continue to be dispersed by air currents into early October. Each seed is polyembryonic and contains about one to four embryos per seed, increasing Vincetoxicum nigrum's proliferation. Seeds have delicate fibrous \\"parachutes\\" used in wind dispersal over long distances. In addition to seeds for reproduction, Vincetoxicum nigrum also uses rhizomes as a method of propagation, meaning that the plant clones itself underground and produces new plants. After seed dispersal, the plant dies to the ground in the winter, reappearing in the spring. Invasiveness Black swallow-wort and Japanese knotweed invasive species advisory sign in Lake Allen, Cambridge Township, Michigan The first sighting of Vincetoxicum nigrum in North America was recorded in Ipswich, Massachusetts in 1854. In 1864, a plant collector recorded that it was \\"escaping from the botanical garden where it is a weed promising to be naturalized\\". Vincetoxicum nigrum escaped from a garden in the Cambridge area of Massachusetts and naturalized in the surrounding states and is still spreading today. Massachusetts and New York classify the plant as an invasive species. Beyond the northeastern US, the plant has been reported in Wisconsin and California. Ecological implications In the United States and Canada, Vincetoxicum nigrum is a threat to native species because it crowds them out. For example, it can completely replace a field of native goldenrod. Crowding out other species results in a reduced habitat for wildlife, which may become endangered because they can no longer find their optimal habitat. Vincetoxicum nigrum threatens the rare limestone pavement barren ecosystems by crowding out plants that the native wildlife needs to survive. It may also decrease bird presence in grasslands, which may in turn cause certain insect species populations to increase. In Vermont, Vincetoxicum nigrum crowds out the endangered species Jesup's milk vetch (Astragalus robbinsii var. jesupii). In Rhode Island, Vincetoxicum nigrum has been reported as reducing the effectiveness of electric fences, which may allow livestock to be put into danger or lost. In addition, Vincetoxicum nigrum crowds out a species of milkweed that monarch butterflies use as their larval food plant. Thus, the spread of this plant threatens populations of monarch butterflies. Overall, Vincetoxicum nigrum reproduces very prolifically, and can easily take over various habitats in a short time. Most of the possible implications of Vincetoxicum nigrum's changing the structure of various ecosystems have not yet been studied. Management There are four methods of management that can possibly be used for the management of Vincetoxicum nigrum. These methods are chemical, manual, mechanical, and biological. Only the chemical, manual, mechanical methods are actually used in the United States and Canada. The biological method may be used in the future. Overall, early detection and removal is the best management strategy. Chemical The best chemical management of Vincetoxicum nigrum is through the use of systemic herbicides which prevent seeds from being viable. Garlon 4 (tridopyr ester) and RoundUp Pro (glyphosate) are the main systemic herbicides that are used to control the vine. The systemic herbicide is most effective when sprayed on the plant after flowering has begun. If the herbicide is used after follicles have formed, it is less effective because viable seeds may still form. The most effective treatment using systemic herbicides is through a cut stem application, consisting of applying the chemical to the recently-cut stems of the swallow-wort vines. Manual Manual management is the removal of Vincetoxicum nigrum from the ground by digging up its rhizomes so that the plant cannot reproduce. The vine has an extensive rhizome system which must be completely removed to prevent new shoots from growing. Trying to remove the vine by pulling will often cause the plant to detach from its rhizome, allowing the vine to continue to grow new shoots. Seed pods must be disposed of carefully, to avoid inadvertently spreading the seeds to new areas. Mechanical Mechanical management is the mowing down of Vincetoxicum nigrum. This method does not stop growth, but it does stop seed crops. No seed crop means that the plant has no offspring. Biological Biological management is the use of the vine's natural enemies to stop the spread and diminish the population of Vincetoxicum nigrum. In the United States, Vincetoxicum nigrum has no natural enemies, but in its native Europe, certain caterpillars, beetles, and diseases attack the plant. Researchers at Cornell University and the USDA have investigated the use of natural enemies as a way to control the plant. The use of natural enemies is controversial, because the implications of adding more non-native species to threatened areas is unknown. In 2014 Hypena caterpillars were released in Ontario, Canada to help control Vincetoxicum's spread.

History  Origin  B√∏rglum Abbey was originally a royal farm () which dated back as far as 1000, if not earlier. In 1086 King Canute IV fled from his residence at B√∏rglum when the peasants revolted against him. The royal residence was burned to the ground but rebuilt sometime later.There is some uncertainty about the location of the present abbey buildings in relationship to the royal farm. There is a letter that seems to indicate that the present site is not the same as the original residence, although no specific mention of where the \\"old\\" monastery was At some point between 1134 and 1139, the royal estate at B√∏rglum was granted to the church to become the new seat of the bishopric of northern Jutland, also known as the bishopric of Vendsyssel, previously established at Vestervig. Bishop Self (or Sylvester) of Vestervig became the first Bishop of B√∏rglum (Vendsyssel) in 1139, and B√∏rglum remained the seat of the diocese until the Reformation. It is unclear exactly who first established a monastery there, but it seems possible that the Augustinians previously settled at Vestervig had moved to B√∏rglum by 1134. Premonstratensians In the 1180s the Premonstratensians, or White Canons, were established here, as a daughter house of Steinfeld Abbey near Cologne in Germany. B√∏rglum then in its turn became the mother house for all Premonstratensian monasteries in Scandinavia. The abbey quickly became prominent, perhaps with the help of royal patronage, and set up a seminary, where many noble families sent at least one of their sons to study. The Premonstratensians expanded the abbey and its church during the time of Bishop Troel. Bishopric Some time before 1220 the Bishop of Vendsyssel made the abbey his episcopal seat.The bishop's residence was built separately from the monastery, a little to the southeast The abbey church became the cathedral of the bishopric of Vendsyssel, or B√∏rglum, and the canons took on the additional role of the cathedral chapter. Besides being the biggest landowner in North Jutland, the bishop was ex officio part of the State Council which advised the King of Denmark on domestic and international policy. This further enhanced the reputation of B√∏rglum Abbey, making it one of the most influential religious houses in Denmark. Abbey church, interior: organ The abbey church, later also cathedral, was built as a typical Romanesque basilica and formed the eastern range of the monastery. It is believed that the builders modelled its construction and decoration on Viborg Cathedral. It was built of granite, obtained locally. A flat timber ceiling and the absence of windows would have made it dark, but the massive walls would have prevented the cold winds and storms off the North Sea, just a few miles to the west, from penetrating the building. Hans Christian Andersen wrote a version of the old folk legend 'The Bishop of Borglum and his Men' which recounts the murder of Bishop of Borglum, Oluf Glob, and several companions by his nephew, Jens Glob, in front of the altar at Hvidebjerg Church on Thy Island in 1206. There are several exchanges of letters between the Bishop of Vendsyssel and several popes regarding the white woollen habit that was the required dress for Premonstratensian canons. In May 1403, Pope Boniface IX gave dispensation to the canons at B√∏rglum to alter their white habits to black, brown or any other dark color, due to the abbey's \\"being a place near the sea with frequent floods and the resulting mud.\\" In 1422 the canons were permitted to wear undergarments for warmth and to add a cowl to their attire.Diplomatarium Danicum - see below One of the annual events for which B√∏rglum was famous was the market on or near St. Bodil's day, June 17. Bodil's sacred spring which was a religious site back in Viking times was believed to have healing power. In 1500 a fire destroyed much of the old abbey church and a new church was begun, but in the later Gothic style with high arched ceilings. Work was slow, but by 1520 the choir and nave had been rebuilt and work had begun on the transepts to join the two together. The Reformation in the 1520s and 1530s brought the reconstruction to a halt. Abbey, 1897 The last Bishop of Vendsyssel (and abbot of B√∏rglum) was Stygge Krumpen, who was unable to halt the advance of the Lutheran reforms. In 1536 he was arrested and imprisoned but after several years in confinement was eventually released when he accepted Lutheranism and agreed to marry. He was given the former nunnery of Asmild Abbey, near Viborg, as an estate, on the condition that he make provision for the care of the nuns who after its dissolution in 1536 had no other place to go. After dissolution Abbey church interior B√∏rglum Abbey was dissolved when Denmark became officially Lutheran on 30 October 1536. Its assets reverted to the crown and it became a royal property once again. The abbey church continued in use as the cathedral church for northern Jutland until 1554, when the Lutheran bishop moved the episcopal seat to the Budolfi Church in Aalborg. The vast B√∏rglum Abbey estate was broken up and sold off or given to noble families. The abbey's main building became a large manor house and the outbuildings were either demolished or converted to farm use. In 1764, a Colonel Poulsen residing at B√∏rglum Abbey was the recipient of what might be the first known mail bomb in history. The affair is mentioned in the 18th century diary of Danish official and historian Bolle Willum Luxdorph. The entry for January 19, 1764 notes that a box was sent by mail, containing gunpowder and a firelock which set fire to it, severely injuring the colonel. He survived but on February 15 got a letter in German, saying that \\"soon the dose will be increased\\". The perpetrator was never found.Eiler Nystr√∏m(ed.) - Luxdorphs Dagb√∏ger, volume I, p. 207 & 209, Copenhagen, 1915 Without constant attention the buildings began to deteriorate; the church especially fell into total disrepair. A local nobleman, Godslev Budde, received permission from Frederik II to demolish the incomplete transepts and enclose the church in the original basilica form. Present day B√∏rglum Abbey As a manor house, the former abbey buildings at B√∏rglum have survived to modern times. In 1958 the structures were given national historic status and protection. The remains of the abbey buildings now accommodate a museum showing the history of the site . The church continues to serve as the local parish church. B√∏rglum displays a modern copy of the Bayeux Tapestry.

It relies on speed for its execution in situations where there is little time or space. The \\"Pel√© variant\\" was demonstrated by Brazilian Pel√© during the 1970 FIFA World Cup match against Uruguay.\\"The Greatest? For Century, Pel√© Eclipses Muhammad Ali\\". The New York Times. Retrieved 6 May 2011. In the second half, Brazilian centre-forward Tost√£o played a through pass to Pel√© as a counter-attack started. Sprinting up the middle, Pel√© was immediately confronted with the Uruguayan goalkeeper Ladislao Mazurkiewicz who came off his line quickly. Pel√© got there first and fooled Mazurkiewicz by not touching the ball, causing it to roll to the goalkeeper's left, while Pel√© went to the goalkeeper's right. Circling the goalkeeper to collect, Pel√© shot while turning towards the goal, but he turned in excess as he shot, and the ball drifted just wide of the far post.\\"Mexico 1970: Brazilians show all how beautiful game should be played\\". Sky Sports. Retrieved 5 May 2011. Pel√©'s move is a variant of the \\"selling the dummy\\" feint - letting the ball go around a defender then also circling the opponent, rather than following the straight path of a pass or loose ball, and can be useful in tight situations. It is discussed in such books as Scientific Soccer of the Seventies by soccer historian Kenneth MacDonald, who also discusses Pel√©'s contribution in Brazil's 1970 World Cup victory in detail. This \\"runaround\\" move is mentioned in official FIFA World Cup Technical Reports as \\"audaciously executed, and called for immense skill, timing, judgment and speed.\\"World Championship - Jules Rimet Cup 1970 Final Competition. F√âD√âRATION INTERNATIONALE DE FOOTBALL ASSOCIATION, FIFA Technical Study Group, London: (FIFA) 1970), p. 24. The Blomqvist shuffle Swedish player Jesper Blomqvist managed to perform a variant of the Pele runaround move with more success, adding a fake, that resulted in a goal when his IFK G√∂teborg played Helsingborgs IF in the Allsvenskan in 1995.As seen on Youtube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXJhyqEinXY) Blomqvist relied more on deception than Pel√©. Whereas the Brazilian had to move with utmost speed to avoid Mazurkiewicz, Blomqvist had more time and used a deceptive shuffling of the feet. Receiving an excellent through pass, the Swede confused the approaching keeper - letting the ball run - and faking left, while sprinting right, around his opponent. He collected the ball on the other side and finished with an easy goal. As demonstrated by both Blomqvist and Pel√©, the runaround move can thus work in \\"emergency\\" situations where speed and split- second timing is all, or where there is more time and space to fake out an opponent. In both scenarios, it can lead to spectacular results.

Background and legal standing After the decline of the Greek- speaking Hellenistic Judaism in ancient times, the use of the Greek language and the integration of the Greek culture into Judaism continued to be an integral part of the life in Jewish communities in the Byzantine Empire.De Lange, N. R. M. \\"Greek Jewish Texts from the Cairo Genizah\\". 1996 The legal standing of the Jews of the Byzantine Empire was unique during the entire history of the Empire; they did not belong to the Christian Eastern Orthodox faith, which was the state religion, nor were they‚Äîin most circumstances‚Äîgrouped together with heretics and pagans. They were placed in a legal position somewhere between the two worlds. The place along the spectrum of social freedom in which Byzantine Jews found themselves varied somewhat‚Äîthough far from drastically‚Äîwith time, and depended largely on three factors: the theological desire of the state to maintain the Jews as a living testament to the victory of Christianity, the desire of the state to strengthen its control, and the ability of centralized rule from Constantinople to enforce its legislation. Foundations of the legal position of Jews: 330‚Äì404 In 212, Caracalla bestowed citizenship on all its residents, including the Jews. This granted Jews legal equality to all other citizens, and formed the foundation of their legal status in Byzantium following the founding of Constantinople in 330.Sharf, p. 20 Indeed, Jews enjoyed the right to practice their faith under the rule of the Byzantines, as long as they paid the Fiscus Judaicus. For example, circumcision, which was considered mutilation and therefore punishable by death if performed on a non- Jewish child, and by exile if performed on a non-Jewish adult, was legally permitted within Jewish religious practices. Byzantine law recognized synagogues as places of worship, which could not be arbitrarily molested, Jewish courts had the force of law in civil cases, and Jews could not be forced to violate Shabbat and their festivals.Sharf, pp. 20-1 Since the year 390 nearly all of the territory of present-day Israel came under Byzantine suzerainty. The area was divided into the following provinces: Palestina Prima, Palestina Secunda and Palestina Tertia. These provinces were part of the Diocese of the East. Theodosian Code: 404‚Äì527 In 404, Jews were excluded from certain governmental posts.Sharf, p. 21 In 418, they were barred from the civil service, and from all military positions.Linder, p. 281 In 425, they were excluded from all remaining public offices, both civilian and military‚Äîa prohibition which Justinian I reiterated. Such restrictions, however, inevitably compromised the theological arguments for restricting the Jewish religion; although they empowered the Christian citizens of the empire at the expense of its Jews, all laws dealing with the Jews implicitly recognized the continued existence and legality of the Jewish religion.Brewer, p. 135 Thus Emperor Theodosius II found that he had to balance the first two of the three factors governing the treatment of Jews in the empire‚Äîtheology, political pragmatism and enforceability. He could not, however, effectively control the third. In 438, Theodosius had to reaffirm the prohibition on Jews holding public office, because it had been poorly enforced.Brewer, p. 130 Even in 527, a decree which renewed this prohibition began by observing that \\"heedless of the laws' command [they have] infiltrated public offices\\".Linder, p. 360 There was one office, however, that Jews were not forbidden from assuming. This was the office of decurion, a tax collector who was required to pay all deficits in revenue from his own pocket. Theodosius II, who laid out much of the legal precedent and foundation for Byzantine law in his Theodosian Code, permitted Jews, like other citizens, to hire a substitute to perform the duties of decurion in their place.Sharf, p. 21 Justinian, whose legal code included 33 laws relating to the Jews,Brewer, p. 127 initially maintained this ability, but it was abolished in 537. Sharf explains that the purpose of this was so that the Jews \\"never enjoy the fruits of office, but only suffer its pains and penalties\\". In addition to the matter of holding public office, Jews were also unequal to Christians with respect to the ownership of slaves. Restrictions on the ownership of Christian slaves by Jews were in place through the reign of many emperors, under the fear that Jews would use conversion of slaves as a means to increase their number. Additionally, this was designed to provide an incentive for non-Christian slaves to convert into Christianity, and an economic restriction on the Jews. Restrictions on slave- owning could not, however, be excessively burdensome, because slaves, although numerous, were between 10-15% of the population.Slavery in the Late Ancient World, pp. 55‚Äì60, Kyle Harper, 2011 Under the Theodosian Code, therefore, ownership of Christian slaves by Jews was not prohibited, although their purchase was. Thus, one who gained possession of a slave by means such as inheritance would remain his or her owner. Purchase of slaves was usually penalized by compelled sale at the original purchase price.Sharf, p. 22 Slave ownership produces another example of the threefold balancing act of Legislation dealing with the Jewish minority of Byzantium: ownership of Christian slaves undermined the \\"living testament\\" theology, but was a pragmatic requirement of the time, and the prohibition thereof could not be entirely enforced, since freedom may not necessarily have been a desirable option for a slave who was well-treated by his masters.Fieldman, p. 394 The third important restriction on Judaism‚Äîin addition to the limitations on public service and slave ownership‚Äîwas that the Jewish religion, though allowed to survive, was not allowed to thrive. Theologically, the victory of Christianity could be successfully asserted by maintaining a small contingent of Jews within the empire, although allowing them to become too sizable a minority would threaten the theological monopoly of Orthodox Christianity within the Empire. One important ramification of this policy was the prohibition on the construction of new synagogues within the Empire, though the repair of old synagogues was permitted. This prohibition was difficult to enforce, as archaeological evidence in Israel indicates that illegal synagogue construction continued throughout the sixth century.Gray, pp. 262-3 The synagogue did continue to be respected as an inviolable place of worship until the reign of Justinian. Beginning at this time, most legislation regarding the Jews‚Äîeven laws which expanded the rights which they were afforded‚Äîwere \\"prefaced by unambiguous expressions of hatred and contempt for Judaism\\". Justinian Code: 527‚Äì565 The Civil Code of Justinian tightened the regulations on the ownership of Christian slaves by non-Christians. It abolished compensation for illegal purchases of Christian slaves, and added a 30 lb gold fine for this offense. Jews owning Christian slaves during the time of Justinian could be punished by execution. In 545, Justinian legislated that the right of existence of any synagogue on land belonging to an ecclesiastical institution be nullified. He was also the first emperor to order that existing synagogues be converted into churches. There is, however, only one example of such a conversion taking place by force: the synagogue in Borem. This synagogue was most likely converted for military reasons, in light of its strategic position on the frontier with the territory of the Berber tribes. In fact, Justinian banned all non-Christian places of worship in northern Africa, in legislation that grouped Jews with pagans and heretics. This legislation was hardly enforced, but set a precedent for the violability of synagogues and the blurring of the difference between Jews and other non-Christians.Sharf, p. 26 Once more, this represents the divergence between the Empire's theological objectives, its pragmatic goals and its capability to enforce its legislation. The poor efficacy of legislation points to the dominating power of the latter in restraining the two former factors, which, in this case, coincided. The Jews also found that they were positioned in law somewhere between other non- Christians and the Christian majority. For instance, Justinian demanded that Passover be shown as subservient to Easter; in cases in which the former would fall before the latter, the Jews were forbidden from celebrating it on its appointed day, and were compelled to delay it.Sharf, p. 23 Jews were also forbidden from giving testimony concerning Christians in a court of law‚Äîa restriction already present in the Theodosian code‚Äîalthough Justinian eased this restriction in 537 to allow them to testify in cases between Christian individuals and the state. This privilege was not enjoyed by any other non- Christian group.Brewer, p. 131 Once more, the state sacrificed the doctrinal subordination of the Jews in order to gain practical benefits, in this case testimony against those who faced it in court. Questions of internal Jewish discourse‚Äîwhich could, under the Theodosian Code, be arbitrated only by Jewish courts‚Äîcould, under the Justinian Code, be officiated by the state,Brewer, pp. 132-3 a power which Justinian did not shy away from utilizing. In 553 for instance, Justinian required that the public reading of the Pentateuch proceed in vernacular, rather than Hebrew, and forbade altogether the reading of the Mishna.Sharf, pp. 24-5 In this way, Justinian not only restricted the religious freedom of the Jews, but also expanded his own power in order to reinforce the principle that, \\"in theory, there is no area that falls outside of the Empire's legislative power\\".Brewer, p. 135 Justinian's restrictions were, however, poorly enforced. Ironically, what little enforcement they did enjoy contributed to a notable growth in Jewish culture and liturgy. For instance, the banning of the reading of Mishna prompted Jewish scholars to write the piyutim, important works of poetry which refer strongly to the Mishna. Because these were not banned by the Civil Code, they afforded Jews the ability to circumvent it. Accordingly, this form of religious expression flourished under Justinian.Weinberger, p. 143 Punctuated tolerance, Jewish revolts, and the Crusades: 565‚Äì1204 Although the Justinian Code remained in force in the Eastern Empire until the ninth century,Brewer, p. 127 the period following Justinian's reign was generally characterized by toleration of non- Christians, particularly the Jews. However, during the Byzantine‚ÄìSasanian War of 602‚Äì628 many Jews sided against the Byzantine Empire in the Jewish revolt against Heraclius, which successfully assisted the invading Persian Sassanids in conquering all of Roman Egypt and Syria. In reaction to this, anti-Jewish measures were enacted throughout the Byzantine realm and as far away as Merovingian France.Abrahamson et al. The Persian conquest of Jerusalem in 614 compared with Islamic conquest of 638. Soon thereafter, in 634 the Muslim conquests began, during which many Jews initially rose up again against their Byzantine rulers.Barbara H. Rosenwein, A Short History of the Middle Ages (Ontario: 2004), 71‚Äì2. . During this time Heraclius became the first emperor to force the conversion of Jews to Christianity.Bowman, p. 9 Following his death, and until 1204, the Jews suffered only three notable legal persecutions, the sum of whose span was roughly fifty years.Starr, pp. 1-10 It is even debated whether the first of these‚Äîthe anti-Jewish measures passed during the reign of Leo III the Isaurian‚Äîcould be considered a persecution.Charnis, p. 75 The second of these, during the reign of Basil I from 867 to 886, briefly punctuated the tolerance of the ninth century. The last of these persecutions took place under John Tzimiskes, who reigned from 969 to 976. Accordingly, there were no recorded legal persecutions of the Jews for nearly two and a half centuries following his reign. In fact Samuel Krauss writes in his famous work on Byzantine Jewry that Constantinople at the time of the Byzantine Empire was \\"the center of the Jewish, Samaritan and Karaite scholarship\\". Eleazar ben Killir a Byzantine Jew from a Greek-speaking area wrote his famous piyutim, which are still in use in the most Machzorim and became the teacher of all paytanim who came after him.Samuel Krauss (Studien zur byzantinisch-j√ºdischen Geschichte 1914 p. 99 et 127-129) Asaph the Jew wrote in Byzantium the first Hebrew medical treatise.Holo, J. Byzantine Jewry in the Mediterranean Economy 2009, p. 174 The Sefer Yosippon was written down in the 10th century in the Byzantine south Italy by the Greek-speaking Jewish community there. Judah Leon ben Moses Mosconi, a Romaniote Jew from Achrida edited and expanded the Sefer Josippon later.Medieval Jewish Civilisation: An Encyclopedia, Norman Roth, 2014 p. 127.Robert Bonfil, Jews in Byzantium: Dialectics of Minority and Majority Cultures, 2011, p. 122 This community of Byzantine Jews of southern Italy produced such prominent works like the Sefer Ahimaaz of Ahimaaz ben Paltiel, the Sefer Hachmoni of Shabbethai Donnolo, the Aggadath Bereshit and many piyyutim.Magdalino, P. and Mavroudi, M. \\"The Occult Sciences in Byzantium\\", p. 293, 2006Kohen, E. \\"History of the Byzantine Jews: A Microcosmos in the Thousand Year Empire\\", p. 91, 2007D√∂nitz, S. \\"Historiography among Byzantine Jews: The case of Sefer Yosippon\\",Bowman, S.

Like in the case of the Hellenistic Jewish authorship some of the Byzantine Jewish manuscripts show the use of the Greek language in religious and communal aspects. The language of this manuscripts is not in Ancient Greek, but rather in an older form of Modern Greek. These texts are the oldest known written texts in Modern Greek.Bremer, E. and R√∂hl, S. \\"Language of Religion, Language of the People: Medieval Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, 2006 Beside these Rabbanites and as a part of the Empire's Romaniote Jews, important Karaite communities like the Constantinopolitan Karaites and the Karaites of Adrianople flourished and produced eminent personalities for the Karaite movement like Caleb Afendopolo, Elijah Bashyazi, Aaron ben Joseph of Constantinople, Aaron ben Elijah, Judah Hadassi and other.Z. Ankori, Karaites in Byzantium (New York, 1959) In the twelfth century, there were about 2,500 Jews in Constantinople, 2,000 Jews in Thebes and 500 Jews in Thessalonica. Halmyrus, Rhaedestus, Chios, and Rhodes each housed 400 Jews.Treadgold, p. 701 Also, there were about 300 Jews each in Corinth and Samos, and 200 Jews in Gallipoli.Treadgold, p. 702 It was in the 12th century that the passing Crusaders wrought havoc upon the Jewish communities of Byzantium, in a foretaste of what the later Latin occupation would bring upon the Byzantine Christians. Although most crusading bands did not adopt a policy of violence or forced conversion against the Jews, the First Crusade certainly undertook an anti-Jewish face in certain communities. Because the Crusade was undertaken with the goal of \\"subjugating all non- believers to the faith,\\" many crusaders compelled Jews to convert on pain of death, and there is a large number of recorded cases of mass suicides within Jewish communities‚Äîparticularly among Jewish maidens‚Äîin order to avoid such conversions.Chazan, pp. 10-1 Latin occupation: 1204‚Äì1261 The Fourth Crusade further degraded the position of Byzantine Jews. As smaller states separated from a weakened empire, the rulers of these states found themselves more capable of enforcing legislation than their Byzantine counterparts. The most powerful protection on the rights of Jews‚Äîgovernmental impotence to enforce laws‚Äîwas thus abolished. Theodore Doukas, who crowned himself emperor of Epiros after he conquered Thessalonica, was known for his persecution of the Jews, which began in 1229, a year before the end of his reign. Theodore's disdain for the Jews is well-established. Still, his waiting until 1229‚Äîfive years after capturing Thessalonica and declaring himself emperor‚Äîindicates that antisemitism may not have been the cause of his anti-Jewish edicts. Rather, they appear to have been motivated by a desire to confiscate Jewish property at a time when his empire was short of funds. This explains the expropriations of Jewish property under Theodore, as well as his regime's abstention from religious persecution for its own sake.Bowman, p. 14 John Vatatzes, the emperor of Nicaea, commenced legal persecution of the Jews in 1253. Unlike Theodore, Vatatzes ordered that the Jews within the Empire of Nicaea be converted to Christianity, though he did not order the expropriation of Jewish property.Bowman, p. 18 Although these measures began only a year before Vatatzes' death, they seemed to have set a precedent of persecution which his son, Theodore II Laskaris, followed. It was in this environment of persecution that the Palaiologoi rose to the imperial throne. Michael VIII Palaiologos largely ended persecution of the Jews. Bowman writes the following: :Michael VIII summoned the Jewish leaders in his realm and invited them to support him as emperor. Thus Michael's first act toward the Jews [‚Ä¶] was the revocation of John Vatatzes's order of forced baptism. At the same time, however, he made it clear to the Jews that he expected them to show their appreciation for his assistance. Michael's road to the throne had been of questionable legality, and that fact earned him many enemies. Additionally, he oversaw an empire which was strongly dependent on foreign powers, and had an immense need for gold to fund its great military expenses. It is not surprising, therefore, that he turned to the Jews and other minorities (most notably the Armenians) as a source of support in an embattled state of affairs, and when the ethnic majority and the mainstream elite had grown unfriendly toward him.Bowman, p. 19 A decaying Empire: 1261‚Äì1453 Alexander the Great, clad as a Byzantine emperor, receives a delegation of Jewish rabbis. Miniature from the 14th-century Alexander Romance Andronikos II Palaiologos followed his father's precedent. The tolerance of Andronikos was quite notable, even drawing condemnation from Patriarch Athanasius III of Alexandria, against what he saw as \\"excessive\\" tolerance of Jews and other non-Christians, in particular for permitting them to live amongst Christians.Charnis, pp. 75-6 The patriarch's complaint indicates that, in spite of the tolerance of the Palaiologoi, the norm of imperial law was to require non-Christians to live separately from Christians. This apparent trend of segregation between the peoples of Byzantium, which certainly included the Jews, is confirmed in a letter by John, bishop of Citrus, in the latter half of the twelfth century, which declared that, \\"People of alien tongues and alien beliefs, such as Jews, Armenians, Ishmaelites, Hagarites and other such as these were permitted from of old to dwell in Christian countries and cities, except that they had to live separately and not together with the Christians\\".Charnis, pp. 76-7 In Constantinople, there was a Jewish quarter near the eponymous gate in the modern Yenikapƒ± area. By the fourteenth century, the Jewish question of Byzantium seemed to be most concerned with Venetian Jews. Venetians had come to reside in the Empire in large numbers by the early 14th century, and treaties between the Empire and Venice granted the Venetians living in the empire, including Jews of Venetian origin, special privileges, though they also carried certain minor economic prohibitions. Under the aegis of these treaties, Venetian Jews could buy, sell or rent land anywhere in Constantinople. They also enjoyed a more favorable tax structure than Byzantine citizens, as well as the freedom of movement and settlement anywhere in the Empire.Bowman, pp. 20-1 Further complicating this legal status, some Jews obtained Venetian citizenship either \\"by coming from areas subject to the Republic or by purchasing naturalization\\", thus obtaining the same privileges as Venetian nationals in the Empire.Bowman, p. 23 At this time, the Empire was in rapid decay, and could not seriously enforce laws intended to curtail these rights and regain economic control within its borders. Thus, an exception to the general trend of Byzantine history emerged during this century, whereby Jews were entitled to a broader set of rights than Christians. However, it is important to note that these liberties were conferred based on their being Venetian, not based on their Jewish identity. Non-Venetian Jews did not profit from the Venetian-Byzantine treaties, and non-Jewish Venetians enjoyed the same liberties as their Jewish compatriots. References Further reading * Bowman, Steven.

Sawyer or Eric Sawyer (born June 2, 1962 in Brookhaven, New York) is an American orchestral composer, pianist and professor of music at Amherst College. He has studied as an undergraduate at Harvard College, where he was selected as a Harvard Junior Fellow. He undertook graduate studies at both Columbia University and the University of California, Davis (where he completed his doctorate in 1994). Before taking up the position at Amherst, Sawyer spent four years as Chair of Composition and Theory at the Longy School of Music. Credits Sawyer has written a number of pieces that have received multiple public performances. His debut was in 1985 with Three Pieces for Orchestra, performed by the Harvard Chamber Orchestra, and was described at the time as an \\"auspicious beginning\\". Later pieces have included \\"String Quartet No. 2\\" (premiered at the Longy School of Music's \\"SeptemberFest\\" in 1999); \\"Violin Sonata\\" (which included Sawyer on piano); \\"The Humble Heart\\", a cantata built around texts by American Shakers, which debuted in 2006; and \\"Three for Trio\\". The 2001 Laurel Trio performance of Three for Trio was well received, being described as \\"the work of a person who is entirely at ease with traditional tonality stretched to its limits.\\" Sawyer's first CD of his work - Eric Sawyer: String Works - was released under the Albany Records label in 2005 and featured four of his compositions. Sawyer's piano trio ‚ÄúLincoln‚Äôs Two Americas‚Äù was one of three winners in the Ravinia Festival competition for Lincoln-themed chamber works to be performed as part of the Abraham Lincoln Bicentennial celebration in 2009. Our American Cousin, 2008 Along with librettist and University of California, Berkeley English lecturer John Shoptaw, Sawyer has composed an opera based upon a play set in Ford's Theatre the night United States President Abraham Lincoln was assassinated by John Wilkes Booth. The play, Our American Cousin, by playwright Tom Taylor, is a farce, while the opera Our American Cousin contains the play, imagined intrigue among the actors and actresses, and production staff of the play, and historical information about the Abraham Lincoln assassination. The opera had its staged premiere in Northampton, Massachusetts in June, 2008. At this performance, reviewer David Perkins noted: : \\"...passages when words and music come together exquisitely. One is the series of choruses in Act I, when the Ford's Theatre audience turns and reforms into groups representing the war's human aftermath - amputees, freedmen, nurses, carpetbaggers, etc., singing words culled from real diaries and letters. Here is Sawyer's most beautiful music, drenched in a bittersweet chromaticism reminiscent of Benjamin Britten's War Requiem. These, and a final chorus condemning the cycle of 'blood for blood', might well be packaged separately. They speak clearly to our A concert version of the opera was performed in 2007, and isolated works had been performed prior to that date. \\"Hawk's Aria\\" was performed in 1997, and \\"Laura Keene's aria\\" was performed in 1993. (At the 1993 performance, reviewer Robert Commanday noted that at this early performance the music was \\"appealing and finely written\\" but found the text to be \\"too wordy\\"). The Boston Modern Orchestra Project has recorded the opera, Our American Cousin on the BMOP/sound label. Sawyer composed a second opera, The Garden of Martyrs, which premiered on September 20, 2013 in Northampton, Massachusetts. The Garden of Martyrs was a prize winner in competition for ‚ÄúThe American Prize.‚Äù a national award in opera composition. William Hite as Ned Spofford and Keith Phares as Newton Arvin in a scene from The Scarlet Professor by Eric Sawyer and Harley Erdman in 2017 The Scarlet Professor is Sawyer's latest opera, based upon a true story of shame and scandal from 1960: a renowned English professor, Newton Arvin, who was arrested and disgraced for possessing gay magazines and materials. The opera received its premiere on September 15, 2017, at Smith College, the same campus where the events took place. Reviewer Marvin J Ward observed that: ‚Äú‚Ä¶composer Eric Sawyer has a penchant for choosing historical events, especially local ones, as the subjects of his operas.

Signs and symptoms Every disease has different signs and symptoms. Some of them are persistent headache; pain in the face, back, arms, or legs; an inability to concentrate; loss of feeling; memory loss; loss of muscle strength; tremors; seizures; increased reflexes, spasticity, tics; paralysis; and slurred speech. One should seek medical attention if affected by these. Causes Trauma Any type of traumatic brain injury (TBI) or injury done to the spinal cord can result in a wide spectrum of disabilities in a person. Depending on the section of the brain or spinal cord that suffers the trauma, the outcome may be anticipated. Infections Infectious diseases are transmitted in several ways. Some of these infections may affect the brain or spinal cord directly. Generally, an infection is a disease that is caused by the invasion of a microorganism or virus. Degeneration Degenerative spinal disorders involve a loss of function in the spine. Pressure on the spinal cord and nerves may be associated with herniation or disc displacement. Brain degeneration also causes central nervous system diseases (i.e. Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's diseases). Studies have shown that obese people may have severe degeneration in the brain due to loss of tissue affecting cognition.https://www.livescience.com/10582-obese- people-severe-brain-degeneration.html Structural defects Common structural defects include birth defects, anencephaly, hypospadias, and spina bifida. Children born with structural defects may have malformed limbs, heart problems, and facial abnormalities. Defects in the formation of the cerebral cortex include microgyria, polymicrogyria, bilateral frontoparietal polymicrogyria, and pachygyria. CNS Tumors A tumor is an abnormal growth of body tissue. In the beginning, tumors can be noncancerous, but if they become malignant, they are cancerous. In general, they appear when there is a problem with cellular division. Problems with the body's immune system can lead to tumors. Autoimmune disorders An autoimmune disorder is a condition where in the immune system attacks and destroys healthy body tissue. This is caused by a loss of tolerance to proteins in the body, resulting in immune cells recognising these as 'foreign' and directing an immune response against them. Stroke A stroke is an interruption of the blood supply to the brain. Approximately every 40 seconds, someone in the US has a stroke. This can happen when a blood vessel is blocked by a blood clot or when a blood vessel ruptures, causing blood to leak to the brain. If the brain cannot get enough oxygen and blood, brain cells can die, leading to permanent damage. Functions  Spinal cord  The spinal cord transmits sensory reception from the peripheral nervous system. It also conducts motor information to the body's skeletal muscles, cardiac muscles, smooth muscles, and glands. There are 31 pairs of spinal nerves along the spinal cord, all of which consist of both sensory and motor neurons. The spinal cord is protected by vertebrae and connects the peripheral nervous system to the brain, and it acts as a \\"minor\\" coordinating center. Brain The brain serves as the organic basis of cognition and exerts centralized control over the other organs of the body. The brain is protected by the skull; however, if the brain is damaged, significant impairments in cognition and physiological function or death may occur. Diagnosis Types of CNS disorders =Addiction= Addiction is a disorder of the brain's reward system which arises through transcriptional and epigenetic mechanisms and occurs over time from chronically high levels of exposure to an addictive stimulus (e.g., morphine, cocaine, sexual intercourse, gambling, etc.). =Arachnoid cysts= Arachnoid cysts are cerebrospinal fluid covered by arachnoidal cells that may develop on the brain or spinal cord. They are a congenital disorder, and in some cases may not show symptoms. However, if there is a large cyst, symptoms may include headache, seizures, ataxia (lack of muscle control), hemiparesis, and several others. Macrocephaly and ADHD are common among children, while presenile dementia, hydrocephalus (an abnormality of the dynamics of the cerebrospinal fluid), and urinary incontinence are symptoms for elderly patients (65 and older). =Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)= ADHD is an organic disorder of the nervous system. ADHD, which in severe cases can be debilitating, has symptoms thought to be caused by structural as well as biochemical imbalances in the brain; in particular, low levels of the neurotransmitters dopamine and norepinephrine, which are responsible for controlling and maintaining attention and movement. Many people with ADHD continue to have symptoms well into adulthood. Also of note is an increased risk of the development of Dementia with Lewy bodies, or (DLB), and a direct genetic association of Attention deficit disorder to Parkinson's disease two progressive, and serious, neurological diseases whose symptoms often occur in people over age 65. =Autism= Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder that is characterized by restricted and repetitive patterns of behavior and persistent deficits in social interaction and communication. =Bipolar disorder= Bipolar disorder is a serious illness of the nervous system. Symptoms can include both signs of major depression and mania. Mood swings from the highs of mania to the lows of deep depression usually occurs over several weeks to months. New research suggests that bipolar disorder is actually a neurological disease genetically related to Parkinson's disease =Catalepsy= Catalepsy is a nervous disorder characterized by immobility and muscular rigidity, along with a decreased sensitivity to pain. Catalepsy is considered a symptom of serious diseases of the nervous system (e.g., Parkinson's disease, Epilepsy, etc.) rather than a disease by itself. Cataleptic fits can range in duration from several minutes to weeks. Catalepsy often responds to Benzodiazepines (e.g., Lorazepam) in pill and I.V. form. =Depression= Major depressive disorder, otherwise known as depression, is a disorder that is characterized by a pervasive and persistent low mood that is accompanied by low self-esteem and by a loss of interest or pleasure in normally enjoyable activities. =Encephalitis= Encephalitis is an inflammation of the brain. It is usually caused by a foreign substance or a viral infection. Symptoms of this disease include headache, neck pain, drowsiness, nausea, and fever. If caused by the West Nile virus, it may be lethal to humans, as well as birds and horses. =Epilepsy/Seizures= Epilepsy is an unpredictable, serious, and potentially fatal disorder of the nervous system, thought to be the result of faulty electrical activity in the brain. Epileptic seizures result from abnormal, excessive, or hypersynchronous neuronal activity in the brain. About 50 million people worldwide have epilepsy, and nearly 80% of epilepsy occurs in developing countries. Epilepsy becomes more common as people age. Onset of new cases occurs most frequently in infants and the elderly. Epileptic seizures may occur in recovering patients as a consequence of brain surgery. =Infection= A number of different pathogens (i.e., certain viruses, bacteria, protozoa, fungi, and prions) can cause infections that adversely affect the brain or spinal cord. =Locked-in syndrome= A medical condition, Locked-in syndrome usually resulting from a stroke that damages part of the brainstem, in which the body and most of the facial muscles are paralysed but consciousness remains and the ability to perform certain eye movements is preserved. =Meningitis= Meningitis is an inflammation of the meninges (membranes) of the brain and spinal cord. It is most often caused by a bacterial or viral infection. Fever, vomiting, and a stiff neck are all symptoms of meningitis. =Migraine= A chronic, often debilitating neurological disorder characterized by recurrent moderate to severe headaches, often in association with a number of autonomic nervous system symptoms. =Multiple sclerosis= Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, inflammatory demyelinating disease, meaning that the myelin sheath of neurons is damaged. Symptoms of MS include visual and sensation problems, muscle weakness, numbness and tingling all over, muscle spasms, poor coordination, and depression. Also patients with MS have reported extreme fatigue and dizziness, tremors, and bladder leakage. =Myelopathy= Myelopathy is an injury to the spinal cord due to severe compression that may result from trauma, congenital stenosis, degenerative disease or disc herniation. The spinal cord is a group of nerves housed inside the spine that runs almost its entire length. =Neurodegenerative disorders= Alzheimer‚Äôs Alzheimer's is a neurodegenerative disease typically found in people over the age of 65 years. Worldwide, approximately 24 million people have dementia; 60% of these cases are due to Alzheimer's. The ultimate cause is unknown. The clinical sign of Alzheimer's is progressive cognition deterioration. Huntington's disease Huntington's disease is a degenerative neurological disorder that is inherited. Degeneration of neuronal cells occurs throughout the brain, especially in the striatum. There is a progressive decline that results in abnormal movements. Statistics show that Huntington's disease may affect 10 per 100,000 people of Western European descent. Parkinson's Parkinson's disease, or PD, is a progressive illness of the nervous system. Caused by the death of dopamine-producing brain cells that affect motor skills and speech. Symptoms may include bradykinesia (slow physical movement), muscle rigidity, and tremors. Behavior, thinking, sensation disorders, and the sometimes co-morbid skin condition Seborrheic dermatitis are just some of PD's numerous nonmotor symptoms. Parkinson's disease, Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and Bi-polar disorder, all appear to have some connection to one another, as all three nervous system disorders involve lower than normal levels of the brain chemical dopamine (In ADHD, Parkinson's, and the depressive phase of Bi-polar disorder.) or too much dopamine (in Mania or Manic states of Bi-polar disorder) in different areas of the brain:ADHD and Parkinson's  LIVESTRONG.COM =Tourette's= Tourette's syndrome is an inherited neurological disorder. Early onset may be during childhood, and it is characterized by physical and verbal tics. Tourette's often also includes symptoms of both OCD and ADHD indicating a link between the three disorders. The exact cause of Tourette's, other than genetic factors, is unknown. Treatments There is a wide range of treatments for central nervous system diseases. These can range from surgery to neural rehabilitation or prescribed medications.

Diplomatic relations between Iraq and the United States began when the U.S. first recognized Iraq on January 9, 1930, with the signing of the Anglo-American-Iraqi Convention in London by Charles G. Dawes, U.S. Ambassador to the United Kingdom. Today, the United States and Iraq both consider themselves as strategic partners, given the American political and military involvement after the invasion of Iraq and their mutual, deep-rooted relationship that followed. The United States provides the Iraqi security forces millions of dollars of military aid and training annually as well as uses its military bases. In 2020, Iraq voted to ask the United States and its coalition members to withdraw all of their troops from the country, with U.S. President Trump asserting that sanctions will be imposed against Iraq if the United States' troops were forced to exit Iraq. Meanwhile, Iraq has prepared a mechanism for the withdrawal of coalition troops from the country and begun discussing it with coalition members.Reuters: Iraqi officials working to implement resolution on foreign troop withdrawal: PM According to the office of Iraq's Prime Minister, the United States has promised to follow up on unauthorized use of Iraqi airspace and violations of its sovereignty.Iraq PMO: Prime Minister Adel Abdul-Mahdi receives a phone call  Ottoman Empire  American commercial interaction with the Ottoman Empire (which included the area that later became modern Iraq) began in the late 18th century. In 1831, Charg√© d'Affaires David Porter became the first American diplomat in the Ottoman Empire, at the capital city of Constantinople. With the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire after World War I, the United States (U.S.) supported Great Britain's administration of Iraq as a mandate, but insisted that it be groomed for independence, rather than remain a colony.  U.S. recognizes Iraq  The U.S. recognized Iraq on January 9, 1930, when Charles G. Dawes, U.S. Ambassador to the United Kingdom (U.K.), signed the Anglo-American-Iraqi Convention in London. According to the preamble of the convention, \\"the United States of America recognizes Iraq as an independent State.\\" In this treaty, the U.S. also acknowledged that \\"special relations\\" existed between the U.K. and Iraq because the latter was a mandate under British protection according to the Treaty of Versailles. In 1932, Iraq terminated its mandate status. Diplomatic relations and the American Legation in Iraq were established on March 30, 1931, when Alexander K. Sloan (then serving as Consul in Iraq) was appointed Charg√© d'Affaires of the American Legation at Baghdad. The U.S. upgraded its diplomatic representation in Iraq from a Legation to an Embassy on December 28, 1946.  Arab Union  On May 28, 1958, the U.S. recognized the Arab Union that formed between Iraq and the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan. U.S. recognition of the new state was accorded in an exchange of notes between the American Embassy at Baghdad and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Arab Union. In announcing U.S. recognition, the Department of State noted that the Arab Union's constitution stipulated that \\"external affairs will remain as they are at the present time\\" with the two Kingdoms that had joined to form the new state. Consequently, formal diplomatic relations were not established between the U.S. and the Arab Union, and diplomatic relations continued uninterrupted between the U.S. and Iraq, and the U.S. and Jordan.  Relations with Qasim's government, 1958‚Äì1963  Relations between the U.S. and Iraq became strained following the overthrow of the Iraqi monarchy on July 14, 1958, which resulted in the declaration of a republican government led by Brigadier Abd al-Karim Qasim. Concerned about the influence of Iraqi Communist Party (ICP) members in Qasim's administration, and hoping to prevent \\"Ba'athist or Communist exploitation of the situation,\\" President Dwight D. Eisenhower had established a Special Committee on Iraq (SCI) in April 1959 to monitor events and propose various contingencies for preventing a communist takeover of the country. cf. Qasim undertook numerous repressive measures against the communists throughout 1960, and this‚Äîcombined with the John F. Kennedy administration's belief that Iraq was not important to the broader Cold War‚Äîresulted in the disestablishment of the SCI within days of Kennedy's inauguration as President. However, subsequent events would return Iraq to the attention of American officials. On June 25, 1961, Qasim mobilized troops along the border between Iraq and Kuwait, declaring the latter nation \\"an indivisible part of Iraq\\" and causing a short-lived \\"Kuwait Crisis.\\" The U.K.‚Äîwhich had just granted Kuwait independence on June 19 and whose economy was heavily dependent on Kuwaiti oil supplies‚Äîresponded on July 1 by dispatching 5,000 troops to the country to deter any Iraqi invasion. At the same time, Kennedy briefly dispatched a U.S. Navy task force to Bahrain, and the U.K. (at the urging of the Kennedy administration) brought the dispute to United Nations Security Council, where the proposed resolution was vetoed by the Soviet Union. The situation was finally resolved in October, when the British troops were withdrawn and replaced by a 4,000-strong Arab League force. The Kennedy administration's initially \\"low-key\\" response to the stand-off was motivated by the desire to project an image of the U.S. as \\"a progressive anti-colonial power trying to work productively with Arab nationalism\\" as well as the preference of U.S. officials to defer to the U.K. on issues related to the Persian Gulf. Following Kurdish leader Mustafa Barzani's 1958 return to Iraq from exile in the Soviet Union, Qasim had promised to permit autonomous rule in the Kurdish region of northern Iraq, but by 1961 Qasim had made no progress towards achieving this goal. In July 1961, following months of violence between feuding Kurdish tribes, Barzani returned to northern Iraq and began retaking territory from his Kurdish rivals. Although Qasim's government did not respond to the escalating violence, the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) sent Qasim a list of demands in August, which included the withdrawal of Iraqi government troops from Kurdish territory and greater political freedom. For the next month, U.S. officials in Iran and Iraq predicted that a war was imminent. Faced with the loss of northern Iraq after non-Barzani Kurds seized control of a key road leading to the Iranian border in early September and ambushed and massacred Iraqi troops on September 10 and September 12, Qasim finally ordered the systematic bombing of Kurdish villages on September 14, which caused Barzani to join the rebellion on September 19. As part of a strategy devised by Alexander Shelepin in July 1961 to distract the U.S. and its allies from the Soviet Union's aggressive posture in Berlin, the Soviet KGB revived its connections with Barzani and encouraged him to revolt, although Barzani had no intention to act as their proxy. By March 1962, Barzani's forces were in firm control of Iraqi Kurdistan, although Barzani refrained from taking major cities out of fear that the Iraqi government would launch reprisals against civilians. The U.S. refused Kurdish requests for assistance, but Qasim nevertheless castigated the Kurds as \\"American stooges\\" while absolving the Soviets of any responsibility for the unrest. cf. In December 1961, Qasim's government passed Public Law 80, which restricted the British- and American-owned Iraq Petroleum Company (IPC)'s concessionary holding to those areas in which oil was actually being produced, effectively expropriating 99.5% of the IPC concession. U.S. officials were alarmed by the expropriation as well as the recent Soviet veto of an Egyptian-sponsored UN resolution requesting the admittance of Kuwait as a UN member state, which they believed to be connected. Senior National Security Council (NSC) adviser Robert Komer worried that if the IPC ceased production in response, Qasim might \\"grab Kuwait\\" (thus achieving a \\"stranglehold\\" on Middle Eastern oil production) or \\"throw himself into Russian arms.\\" At the same time, Komer made note of widespread rumors that a nationalist coup against Qasim could be imminent, and had the potential to \\"get Iraq back on [a] more neutral keel.\\" Following Komer's advice, on December 30 Kennedy's National Security Advisor McGeorge Bundy sent the President a cable from the U.S. Ambassador to Iraq, John Jernegan, which argued that the U.S. was \\"in grave danger [of] being drawn into [a] costly and politically disastrous situation over Kuwait.\\" Bundy also requested Kennedy's permission to \\"press State\\" to consider measures to resolve the situation with Iraq, adding that cooperation with the British was desirable \\"if possible, but our own interests, oil and other, are very directly involved.\\" In April 1962, the State Department issued new guidelines on Iraq that were intended to increase American influence in the country. Around the same time, Kennedy instructed the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)‚Äîunder the direction of Archie Roosevelt, Jr.‚Äîto begin making preparations for a military coup against Qasim. On June 2, Iraqi Foreign Minister Hashim Jawad ordered Jernegan to leave the country, stating that Iraq was also withdrawing its ambassador from Washington in retaliation for the U.S. accepting the credentials of a new Kuwaiti ambassador on June 1, which Iraq had repeatedly warned would result in a downgrading of diplomatic relations. Despite the Iraqi warnings, senior U.S. officials were stunned by the downgrade; Kennedy had not been informed of the likely consequences of accepting the Kuwaiti ambassador.See footnote 6, By the end of 1962, a series of major defeats at the hands of Kurdish rebels had severely damaged both the Iraqi army's morale and Qasim's popular support. From September 1962 through February 1963, Qasim repeatedly blamed the \\"criminal activities\\" of the U.S. for the battlefield successes of the Kurds, but the State Department rejected requests from the U.S. Charg√© d'Affaires in Baghdad, Roy Melbourne, to publicly respond to Qasim's allegations out of fear that doing so would jeopardize the remaining U.S. presence in Iraq. On February 5, 1963 Secretary of State Dean Rusk informed the U.S. embassy in Iraq that the State Department was \\"considering carefully whether on balance U.S. interests would be served [at] this particular juncture by abandoning [its] policy of avoiding public reaction to Qasim's charges,\\" with the reluctance stemming from the desire to avoid compromising the CIA's \\"significant intelligence collecting operations\\": On February 7, State Department executive secretary William Brubeck informed Bundy that Iraq had become \\"one of the more useful spots for acquiring technical information on Soviet military and industrial equipment and on Soviet methods of operation in nonaligned areas.\\"cf. The CIA had earlier penetrated a top-secret Iraqi-Soviet surface-to-air missile project, which yielded intelligence on the Soviet Union's ballistic missile program. With access to crucial intelligence hanging in the balance, U.S. officials were showing \\"great reluctance about aggravating Qasim.\\" After reaching a secret agreement with Barzani to work together against Qasim in January, the anti- imperialist and anti-communist Iraqi Ba'ath Party overthrew and executed Qasim in a violent coup on February 8, 1963. While there have been persistent rumors that the CIA orchestrated the coup, declassified documents and the testimony of former CIA officers indicate there was no direct American involvement, although the CIA was actively seeking to find a suitable replacement for Qasim within the Iraqi military and the U.S. had been notified of two aborted Ba'athist coup plots in July and December 1962.Longtime CIA officer Harry Rositzke later claimed \\"the CIA's major source, in an ideal catbird seat, reported the exact time of the coup and provided a list of the new cabinet members,\\" but this remains unverified. See Despite evidence that the CIA had been closely tracking the Ba'ath Party's coup planning since \\"at least 1961,\\" the CIA official working with Roosevelt to instigate a military coup against Qasim, and who later became the head of the CIA's operations in Iraq and Syria, has \\"denied any involvement in the Ba'ath Party's actions,\\" stating instead that the CIA's efforts against Qasim were still in the planning stages at the time. By contrast, Brandon Wolfe-Hunnicutt states that \\"Scholars remain divided in their interpretations of American foreign policy toward the February 1963 coup in Iraq,\\" but cites \\"compelling evidence of an American role in the coup.\\" Qasim's former deputy Abdul Salam Arif (who was not a Ba'athist) was given the largely ceremonial title of President, while prominent Ba'athist general Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr was named Prime Minister. The most powerful leader of the new government was the secretary of the Iraqi Ba'ath Party, Ali Salih al-Sa'di, who controlled the militant National Guard and organized a massacre of hundreds‚Äîif not thousands‚Äîof suspected communists and other dissidents in the days following the coup. The Kennedy administration viewed the prospect of an Iraqi shift in the Cold War with cautious optimism.See, e.g., However, U.S. officials were worried that a renewal of conflict with the Kurds could threaten the Iraqi government's survival. While Barzani had released 1,500 Arab prisoners of war as a gesture of good faith, Iraqi Foreign Minister Talib El-Shibib told Melbourne on March 3 that the government was unwilling to consider any concessions beyond cultural autonomy and was prepared to use anti-Barzani Kurds and Arab tribes in northern Iraq to co-opt the Kurds's guerrilla methods. On May 4, Melbourne delivered a message warning Shibib of the U.S. government's \\"serious apprehensions at [the] trend of events\\" and urging Iraqi officials to make \\"serious counter-proposals.\\" Nevertheless, on May 22 al-Bakr bluntly told Melbourne he \\"could not permit this Kurdish challenge to Iraqi sovereignty to continue [for] much longer.\\" The fighting resumed on June 10, when the Iraqi government‚Äîwhich had amassed 45,000 troops in Iraqi Kurdistan‚Äîarrested members of the Kurdish negotiating delegation and declared martial law throughout northern Iraq. Meanwhile, the Soviet Union actively worked to undermine the Ba'athist government, suspending military shipments to Iraq in May, convincing its ally Mongolia to sponsor charges of genocide against Iraq at the UN General Assembly from July to September, and sponsoring a failed communist coup attempt on July 3. The Kennedy administration responded by urging Arab allies of the U.S. to oppose the genocide charge at the UN and by approving a $55 million arms deal for Iraq. Furthermore, \\"Weldon C. Mathews has meticulously established that National Guard leaders who participated in human rights abuses had been trained in the United States as part of a police program run by the International Cooperation Administration and Agency for International Development.\\" Because, in the words of State Department official James Spain, the \\"policy of the nationalist Arabs who dominate the Baghdad government does in fact come close to genocide\\"‚Äîas well as a desire to eliminate the Soviets' \\"Kurdish Card\\"‚Äîthe new U.S. ambassador to Iraq, Robert C. Strong, informed al-Bakr of a Barzani peace proposal delivered to the U.S. consul in Tabriz (and offered to convey a response) on August 25. While a Barzani-initiated ceasefire would have allowed the government to claim victory, al-Bakr \\"expressed astonishment\\" over American contacts with the Kurds, asking why the message had not been delivered through the Soviets. Wolfe-Hunnicutt argues that the Kennedy administration's provision of military aid to the Ba'athist government, including napalm weapons, emboldened Iraqi hardliners and was counter-productive to the administration's stated preference for a diplomatic settlement to the First Iraqi‚ÄìKurdish War. An offer by Iraqi general Hasan Sabri al-Bayati to reciprocate this gesture by sending a Soviet T-54 tank in Iraq's possession to the U.S. embassy in Baghdad for inspection became something of a \\"scandal\\" as Bayati's offer had not been approved by al-Bakr, Shibib, or other senior Iraqi officials and was rescinded by the Ba'ath Party leadership after they became aware of it. The Ba'athist government collapsed in November 1963 over the question of unification with Syria (where a different branch of the Ba'ath Party had seized power in March) and the extremist and uncontrollable behavior of al-Sa'di's National Guard. President Arif, with the overwhelming support of the Iraqi military, purged Ba'athists from the government and ordered the National Guard to stand down; although al-Bakr had conspired with Arif to remove al-Sa'di, on January 5, 1964, Arif removed al-Bakr from his new position as Vice President, fearful of allowing the Ba'ath Party to retain a foothold inside his government. On November 21, 1963, the Kennedy administration determined that because Arif remained the Iraqi head of state, diplomatic relations with Iraq would continue unimpeded.  Lyndon Johnson administration  Under the Presidencies of Arif, and, especially, his brother Abdul Rahman Arif, the U.S. and Iraq developed closer ties than at any point since the 1958 revolution. The Lyndon B. Johnson administration favorably perceived Arif's proposal to partially reverse Qasim's nationalization of the IPC's concessionary holding in July 1965 (although the resignation of six cabinet members and widespread disapproval among the Iraqi public forced him to abandon this plan), as well as pro-Western lawyer Abdul Rahman al-Bazzaz's tenure as Prime Minister; Bazzaz attempted to implement a peace agreement with the Kurds following a decisive Kurdish victory at the Battle of Mount Handren in May 1966. Abdul Rahman Arif (hereinafter referred to as \\"Arif\\") was considered \\"one of the few forces of moderation\\" in Iraq, having established a friendship with ambassador Strong prior to assuming the presidency and making a number of friendly gestures to the U.S. between April 1966 and January 1967.cf. At Arif's request, President Johnson met five Iraqi generals and Iraqi ambassador Nasir Hani in the White House on January 25, 1967, reiterating his \\"desire to build an ever closer relationship between [the] two governments.\\" According to Johnson's National Security Adviser, Walt Whitman Rostow, the NSC even contemplated welcoming Arif on a state visit to the U.S., although this proposal was ultimately rejected due to concerns about the stability of his government. Prior to the outbreak of the Six-Day War, Iraqi Foreign Minister Adnan Pachachi met with a number of U.S. officials to discuss the escalating Middle East crisis on June 1, including U.S. ambassador to the UN Arthur Goldberg, Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Eugene V. Rostow, Secretary of State Dean Rusk, and President Johnson himself. The political atmosphere engendered by the costly Arab defeat prompted Iraq to break relations with the U.S. on June 7, and ultimately ensured the collapse of Arif's relatively moderate government. Like his brother, Arif previously tried to balance radical and moderate elements in Iraq, but this balancing act was upended by the war as Arif moved to placate the ascendant Iraqi nationalists, notably by reappointing Tahir Yahya to the position of prime minister. Yahya had announced his intention to create a national oil company during his first premiership in late 1963, laying the groundwork for the Iraq National Oil Company (INOC). During his second term as prime minister from July 1967 to July 1968, Yahya moved to revitalize the INOC and sought to work with France and the Soviet Union to develop the technical capacity to nationalize the IPC outright, pledging to use Iraq's \\"oil as a weapon in the battle against Israel.\\" Before leaving Baghdad on June 10, 1967, U.S. ambassador Enoch S. Duncan handed over the keys to the U.S. embassy to Belgian ambassador Marcel Dupret. Belgium became the protecting power for the U.S. in Baghdad, where lower-ranking American diplomats remained in the old embassy compound as the U.S. Interests Section of the Belgian Embassy. India agreed to serve as the protecting power for Iraq in Washington. Following the break in diplomatic relations, there were very few contacts between American and Iraqi officials until early 1972. In May 1968, the CIA produced a report titled \\"The Stagnant Revolution,\\" stating that radicals in the Iraqi military posed a threat to the Arif government, and while \\"the balance of forces is such that no group feels power enough to take decisive steps,\\" the ensuing gridlock had created \\"a situation in which many important political and economic matters are simply ignored.\\" In June, the Belgians relayed a message from the U.S. State Department to Iraqi officials, offering to resume normal relations if Iraq agreed to provide compensation for damage to the U.S. embassy and consulate incurred during an earlier protest and met other conditions, including an end to the Iraqi boycott of U.S. goods and services imposed after Israel's 1967 victory; although U.S. officials were hoping to prevent a coup, there is no indication of any Iraqi response to this overture. On July 17, the Iraqi Ba'ath Party‚Äîled by al-Bakr as president, Abd ar-Rahman al-Dawud as defense minister, and Abd ar-Razzaq an-Naif as prime minister‚Äîseized power in a bloodless coup, placing Arif on a plane to London. Remembering the collapse of the short-lived coalition government in 1963, al-Bakr quickly ordered Naif and Dawud (neither of whom were Ba'athists) to be removed from their posts and exiled on July 30, cementing the Ba'ath Party's control over Iraq until the U.S.-led invasion in March 2003. al-Bakr was then named prime minister and commander-in-chief of the army. On August 2, Iraqi Foreign Minister Abdul Karim Sheikhli announced that Iraq would seek close ties \\"with the socialist camp, particularly the Soviet Union and the Chinese People's Republic.\\" By late November, the U.S. embassy in Beirut reported that Iraq had released many leftist and communist dissidents, although \\"there [was] no indication ... [they had] been given any major role in the regime.\\" As the Arif government had recently signed a major oil deal with the Soviets, the Ba'ath Party's rapid attempts to improve relations with Moscow were not a complete shock to U.S. policymakers, but they \\"provided a glimpse at a strategic alliance that would soon emerge.\\" In December, Iraqi troops based in Jordan \\"made international headlines\\" when they began shelling Israeli settlers in the Jordan Valley, which led to a strong response by the Israeli Air Force. al- Bakr claimed that a \\"fifth column of agents of Israel and the U.S. was striking from behind,\\" and, on December 14, the Iraqi government alleged it had discovered \\"an Israeli spy network\\" plotting to \\"bring about a change in the Iraqi regime,\\" arresting dozens of individuals and eventually executing 9 Iraqi Jews in January 1969. U.S. officials found the charges improbable, as Iraqi Jews were \\"under constant surveillance [and therefore] would make poor recruits for any Israeli espionage or sabotage net.\\" Contributing to the growing atmosphere of crisis, the Ba'ath Party also escalated the conflict with Barzani by providing aid to Jalal Talabani's rival Kurdish faction. From the beginning, Johnson administration officials were concerned about \\"how radical\\" the Ba'athist government would be‚Äîwith John W. Foster of the NSC predicting immediately after the coup that \\"the new group ... will be more difficult than their predecessors\\"‚Äîand, although initial U.S. fears that the coup had been supported by the \\"extremist\\" sect of the Ba'ath Party that seized control of Syria in 1966 quickly proved unfounded, by the time President Johnson left office there was a growing belief \\"that the Ba'ath Party was becoming a vehicle for Soviet encroachment on Iraq's sovereignty.\\"  Alleged U.S. support for 1970 anti-Ba'athist coup attempt  The Richard Nixon administration was confronted with an early foreign policy crisis when Iraq publicly executed 9 Iraqi Jews on fabricated espionage charges at the end of January 1969. The Nixon administration initially sought to stay the executions by convincing American allies with close ties to Iraq‚Äîsuch as France, Spain, and India‚Äîto apply pressure on the government, but Iraqi officials responded \\"in no uncertain terms, to stay out of [Iraq's] domestic affairs.\\" The U.S. also urged UN Secretary General U Thant to intervene, but he was unable to influence Baghdad's decision. Nixon's Secretary of State, William P. Rogers, condemned the executions as \\"repugnant to the conscience of the world,\\" while U.S. ambassador to the UN Charles Yost took the matter to the UN Security Council, stating that Iraq's actions were \\"designed to arouse emotions and to intensify the very explosive atmosphere of suspicion and hostility in the Middle East.\\" In early 1968, the U.K. had announced its intention to withdraw its forces from \\"East of Suez\\"‚Äîincluding the Persian Gulf region‚Äîthus alarming U.S. officials and prompting the Johnson administration to formulate what became known as the \\"twin pillar policy,\\" in which the U.S. would support Iran and Saudi Arabia in their efforts to maintain the Gulf's stability. The Nixon administration would ultimately revise this policy by focusing on building up Iran, then ruled by Nixon's old friend Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi (hereinafter referred to as \\"the Shah\\"), as the dominant regional power.Iran purchased $16.2 billion worth of U.S. weapons from 1972 to 1977. See The Shah distrusted the Ba'athist government in Iraq, which he considered a \\"bunch of thugs and murderers.\\" Following Iraq's provocative actions in January 1969, the Shah sought to \\"punish\\" Iraq, and possibly win partial Iranian sovereignty over the Shatt al-Arab waterway‚Äîwhich a 1937 treaty had given Iraq almost complete control over‚Äîthrough a series of coercive measures: At the beginning of March, he arranged for Iran's Kurdish allies to attack IPC installations around Kirkuk and Mosul, causing Iraq millions of dollars in damage; in April, he unilaterally abrogated the 1937 treaty; and in January 1970, he sponsored a failed coup attempt against the Iraqi government. The Shah knew that most of Iraq's army was deployed in Kurdistan‚Äîwhile an additional three Iraqi brigades were stationed in Jordan‚Äîthus Iraq was in no position to retaliate militarily, but he offered to \\"break off supplies to the Kurds in return for concessions in the Shatt,\\" a proposal Iraq rejected. The Shah's aggressive actions convinced Iraq to seek an end to the Kurdish War. In late December 1969, al-Bakr sent his deputy, Saddam Hussein, to negotiate directly with Barzani and his close aide Dr. Mahmoud Othman. The Shah was outraged when he learned of these negotiations, and sponsored a coup against the Iraqi government, which was scheduled for the night of January 20‚Äì21, 1970. However, Iraq's security forces had \\"complete recordings of most of the meetings and interviews that took place,\\" foiling the plot, expelling the Iranian ambassador to Iraq, and executing \\"at least 33 conspirators\\" by January 23. On January 24, Iraq announced its support for Kurdish autonomy, and on March 11, Saddam and Barzani reached an agreement (dubbed the \\"March Accord\\") \\"to recognize the binational character of Iraq ... [and] allow for the establishment of a self-governing region of Kurdistan,\\" which was to be implemented by March 1974, although U.S. officials were skeptical that the agreement would prove binding. There were allegations of American involvement in the failed 1970 coup attempt, which involved a coalition of Iraqi factions, including Kurdish opponents of the Ba'ath Party. Edmund Ghareeb claimed that the CIA reached an agreement to help the Kurds overthrow the Iraqi government in August 1969, although there is little evidence to support this claim, and the CIA officer in charge of operations in Iraq and Syria in 1969 \\"denied any U.S. involvement with the Kurds prior to 1972.\\" The State Department was informed of the plot by Iraqi businessman Loufti Obeidi on August 15, but strongly refused to provide any assistance. Iraqi exile Sa'ad Jabr discussed the coup planning with officials at the U.S. embassy in Beirut on December 8; embassy officials reiterated that the U.S. could not involve itself in the conspiracy, although on December 10 the State Department authorized the embassy to tell Jabr \\"we would be prepared to consider prompt resumption of diplomatic relations and would certainly be disposed to cooperate within the limits of existing legislation and our overall policy\\" if the \\"new government prove[d] to be moderate and friendly.\\"  Kurdish intervention, 1972‚Äì1975  Alexei Kosygin (left) and Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr signing the Iraqi‚ÄìSoviet Treaty of Friendship and Co-Operation in 1972 In the aftermath of the March Accord, Iranian and Israeli officials tried to persuade the Nixon administration that the agreement was part of a Soviet plot to free up Iraq's military for aggression against Iran and Israel, but U.S. officials refuted these claims by noting that Iraq had resumed purging ICP members on March 23, 1970, and that Saddam was met with a \\"chilly\\" reception during his visit to Moscow on August 4‚Äì12, during which he requested deferment on Iraq's considerable foreign debt. Iraqi‚ÄìSoviet relations improved rapidly in late 1971 in response to the Soviet Union's deteriorating alliance with Egyptian leader Anwar Sadat, who succeeded Gamal Abdel Nasser following Nasser's death on September 28, 1970. However, even after Iraq signed a secret arms deal with the Soviets in September 1971, which was finalized during Soviet Defense Minister Andrei Grechko's December trip to Baghdad and \\"brought the total of Soviet military aid to Iraq to above the $750 million level,\\" the State Department remained skeptical that Iraq posed any threat to Iran. On April 9, 1972, Soviet Prime Minister Alexei Kosygin signed \\"a 15-year treaty of friendship and cooperation\\" with al-Bakr, but U.S. officials were not \\"outwardly perturbed\\" by this development, because, according to the NSC staff, it was not \\"surprising or sudden but rather a culmination of existing relationships.\\" It has been suggested that Nixon was initially preoccupied with pursuing his policy of d√©tente with the Soviet Union and with the May 1972 Moscow Summit, but later sought to assuage the Shah's concerns about Iraq during his May 30‚Äì31 trip to Tehran. In a May 31 meeting with the Shah, Nixon vowed that the U.S. \\"would not let down [its] friends,\\" promising to provide Iran with sophisticated weapons (\\"including F-14s and F-15s\\") to counter the Soviet Union's agreement to sell Iraq Mig-23 jets. According to Nixon's National Security Adviser and later Secretary of State, Henry Kissinger, and numerous scholars, Nixon also agreed to a covert operation to assist Barzani's Kurdish rebels while in Tehran. (Barzani had resumed his alliance with Iran and Israel after a December 1970 assassination attempt on his son Idris, which he held the Ba'ath Party responsible for.) There is, however, no official record that this occurred, with the only record that Nixon approved the operation being an August 1 memo from Kissinger to 40 Committee principals. For accounts of Nixon's meetings with the Shah, see and It is therefore plausible that two additional factors ultimately convinced Nixon to approve the operation, despite widespread opposition to supporting the Kurds within the State Department and CIA: Iraq's complete nationalization of the IPC on June 1, after Iraq began exporting oil from North Rumaila to the Soviet Union in April; and the July 18 withdrawal of 15,000 Soviet military personnel from Egypt, which Kissinger's deputy, General Alexander Haig, Jr., predicted on July 28 \\"will probably result in more intense Soviet efforts in Iraq.\\" From October 1972 until the abrupt end of the Kurdish intervention after March 1975, the CIA \\"provided the Kurds with nearly $20 million in assistance,\\" including 1,250 tons of non-attributable weaponry. The main goal of U.S. policy-makers was to increase the Kurds's ability to negotiate a reasonable autonomy agreement with the government of Iraq. To justify the operation, U.S. officials cited Iraq's support for international terrorism and its repeated threats against neighboring states, including Iran (where Iraq supported Baluchi and Arab separatists against the Shah) and Kuwait (Iraq launched an unprovoked attack on a Kuwaiti border post and claimed the Kuwaiti islands of Warbah and Bubiyan in May 1973), with Haig remarking: \\"There can be no doubt that it is in the interest of ourselves, our allies, and other friendly governments in the area to see the Ba'thi regime in Iraq kept off balance and if possible overthrown.\\" After Nixon's resignation in August 1974, President Gerald Ford was briefed about the Kurdish intervention on a \\"need-to-know\\" basis‚Äîleaving Kissinger, former CIA director and ambassador to Iran Richard Helms, Arthur Callahan (chief of the CIA Station in Tehran), and Callahan's deputy‚Äîto actually implement the U.S. policy. To prevent leaks, the State Department was not informed of the operation. In fact, the State Department had dispatched Arthur Lowrie to establish a U.S. Interests Section in Baghdad shortly prior to Nixon's decision to support the Kurds; the Interests Section officially opened on October 1, 1972. Lowrie repeatedly warned that there was a power struggle between moderates and extremists within the Iraqi Ba'ath Party, and that the Shah's aggressive posture towards Iraq, combined with the Ba'ath Party's belief that the U.S. sought to overthrow it, empowered the extremists while forcing Iraq to turn towards the Soviet Union for arms resupply.cf. Helms and the CIA rejected Lowrie's analysis and his proposal that the U.S. try to improve relations with Iraq, with Helms stating \\"[We] are frankly skeptical that in practice we could help the moderates without building up our extremist enemies.\\" The CIA went further, producing a report that cautioned \\"the level of political violence is very high ... This is not a happy situation nor a happy government for the US to try to do business with.\\" After a failed coup attempt on June 30, 1973, Saddam consolidated control over Iraq and made a number of positive gestures towards the U.S. and the West, such as refusing to participate in the Saudi-led oil embargo following the Yom Kippur War, but these actions were largely ignored in Washington. On March 11, 1974, the Iraqi government gave Barzani 15 days to accept a new autonomy law, which \\"fell far short of what the regime had promised the Kurds in 1970, including long-standing demands like a proportional share of oil revenue and the inclusion of the oil-rich and culturally significant city of Kirkuk into the autonomous region\\" and \\"gave the regime a veto over any Kurdish legislation.\\" Barzani allowed the deadline to lapse, triggering the outbreak of the Second Iraqi‚ÄìKurdish War in April. Although the CIA had stockpiled \\"900,000 pounds of non-attributable small arms and ammunition\\" to prepare for this contingency, the Kurds were in a weak position due to their lack of anti- aircraft and anti-tank weapons. Moreover, Soviet advisers contributed to a change in Iraq's tactics that decisively altered the trajectory of the war, allowing the Iraqi army to finally achieve steady gains against the Kurds where it had failed in the past. To prevent a collapse of the Kurdish resistance, Kissinger negotiated a deal with Israel to provide the Kurds with $28 million in heavy weaponry, but all assistance came to a sudden end shortly after the Shah and Saddam embraced one another at a press conference in Algiers on March 6, 1975: Saddam had agreed to a concession on the border of the Shatt al-Arab waterway in return for an end to \\"all subversive infiltration from either side.\\" The increasingly overt Iranian involvement necessary to stave off a Kurdish defeat‚Äîincluding the presence of Iranian soldiers dressed in Kurdish uniforms, who participated in combat for as long as 10 days at a time, thus raising the possibility that further escalation might lead to \\"open war\\" between Iran and Iraq‚Äîcombined with assurances from Arab leaders including Sadat, King Hussein of Jordan, and Algeria's Houari Boum√©di√®ne that \\"Saddam Hussein was ready to pull Iraq out of [the] Soviet orbit if Iran would take away the [Kurdish revolt] which was forcing them into the arms of the Soviets\\"‚Äîalso helped convince the Shah that an accommodation with Iraq was necessary and desirable.; In the aftermath, over 100,000 Kurds fled to Iran, while the Iraqi government brutally consolidated its control over Iraqi Kurdistan‚Äîdestroying as many as 1,400 villages by 1978, imprisoning 600,000 Kurds in resettlement camps, and ultimately waging a campaign of genocide against the Kurds in 1988. A leaked Congressional investigation led by Otis Pike and a February 4, 1976 New York Times article written by William Safire have heavily influenced subsequent scholarship regarding the conduct of the Kurdish intervention. As a result, there is a widespread belief that U.S. officials prodded Barzani into rejecting the Iraqi government's initial offer of autonomy, cynically agreed to \\"sell out\\" the Kurds at the Shah's behest, refused to provide any humanitarian assistance for Kurdish refugees, and failed to respond to \\"a heartbreaking letter\\" Barzani sent Kissinger on March 10, 1975, in which he stated: \\"Our movement and people are being destroyed in an unbelievable way with silence from everyone.\\" In fact, declassified documents reveal that U.S. officials warned Barzani against his proposal to declare autonomy unilaterally, as they knew doing so would provoke the Iraqi government, even as the goal of permanently dividing Iraq and maintaining an autonomous Kurdish government would require massive resources irreconcilable with plausible deniability. cf. cf. However, Barzani could never have accepted Iraq's \\"watered-down autonomy law,\\" as it was inconsistent with the terms of the March Accord and ignored outstanding Kurdish demands. The Shah's \\"sell-out\\" blindsided American and Israeli officials, as well as his own advisers; Kissinger had personally lobbied the Shah against reaching any agreement with Iraq, and questioned the logic of \\"trad[ing] a valuable coercive asset ... for a modest border concession.\\" The U.S. provided $1 million in aid to Kurdish refugees‚Äîand, on March 17, Kissinger responded to Barzani's letter: \\"We can understand that the difficult decisions which the Kurdish people now face are a cause of deep anguish for them. We have great admiration for the courage and dignity with which those people have confronted many trials, and our prayers are with them.\\" With neither Iran nor Turkey willing to allow their territory to be used to support the Kurds, the U.S. and Israel were forced to abandon their assistance. According to Bryan R. Gibson, \\"The Pike Report ignored inconvenient truths; misattributed quotes; falsely accused the United States of not providing the Kurds with any humanitarian assistance; and, finally, claimed that Kissinger had not responded to Barzani's tragic plea, when in fact he had ... This was not the 'textbook case of betrayal and skulduggery' that the Pike Report had led many people to believe.\\"Gibson has in turn been criticized for overstating his disagreement with the Pike Report and for neglecting Barzani's own claim that the latter's rejection of the Ba'ath Party's autonomy law was largely predicated on the promise of U.S. support. See Gibson concedes that U.S. involvement was self- serving and \\"advanced America's Cold War interests, though not entirely at the expense of the Kurds.\\" Joost Hiltermann offers a contrasting analysis: \\"The exoneration shouldn't go unqualified. Kissinger cared for the Kurds only to the extent that they could be used in the pursuit of US interests, and he would surely have abandoned them sooner or later.\\"  Iran-Iraq War and resumption of diplomatic ties  Even though Iraqi interest in American technical expertise was strong, prior to 1980 the government did not seem to be seriously interested in re-establishing diplomatic relations with the United States. The Ba'ath Party viewed the efforts by the United States to achieve \\"step-by-step\\" interim agreements between Israel and the Arab countries and the diplomatic process that led to the Camp David Accords as calculated attempts to perpetuate Arab disunity. Consequently, Iraq took a leading role in organizing Arab opposition to the diplomatic initiatives of the United States. After Egypt signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1979, Iraq succeeded in getting members of the League of Arab States (Arab League) to vote unanimously for Egypt's expulsion from the organization. A review of thousands of declassified government documents and interviews with former U.S. policymakers shows that the U.S. provided intelligence and logistical support, which played a role in arming Iraq during the Iran‚ÄìIraq War. Under the Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush administrations, the U.S. authorized the sale to Iraq of numerous dual-use technology (items with both military and civilian applications), including chemicals which can be used in manufacturing of pesticides or chemical weapons and live viruses and bacteria, such as anthrax and bubonic plague used in medicine and the manufacture of vaccines or weaponized for use in biological weapons. A report of the U.S. Senate's Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs concluded that the U.S. under the successive presidential administrations sold materials including anthrax, and botulism to Iraq right up until March 1992. The chairman of the Senate committee, Don Riegle, said: \\"The executive branch of our government approved 771 different export licenses for sale of dual-use technology to Iraq. I think it's a devastating record.\\"Sunday Herald (Scotland) September 8, 2002. According to several former officials, the State and Commerce departments promoted trade in such items as a way to boost U.S. exports and acquire political leverage over Saddam.Washington Post, December 30, 2002. Relations between the U.S. and Iraq were strained by the Iran‚ÄìContra affair. Rumsfeld, Ronald Reagan's then-special envoy to the Middle East meeting Saddam Hussein on 19‚Äì20 December 1983 during a visit to Baghdad. Rumsfeld later became the U.S. Secretary of Defense who led the coalition forces in 2003 against him. The U.S. provided critical battle planning assistance at a time when U.S. intelligence agencies knew that Iraqi commanders would employ chemical weapons in waging the war, according to senior military officers with direct knowledge of the program. The U.S. carried out this covert program at a time when Secretary of State George P. Shultz, United States Secretary of Defense Frank C. Carlucci and National Security Adviser General Colin L. Powell were publicly condemning Iraq for its use of poison gas, especially after Iraq attacked Kurdish villagers in Halabja in March 1988. U.S. officials publicly condemned Iraq's employment of mustard gas, sarin, VX and other poisonous agents, but sixty Defense Intelligence Agency officers were secretly providing detailed information on Iranian deployments, tactical planning for battles, plans for airstrikes and bomb-damage assessments for Iraq. It has long been known that the U.S. provided intelligence assistance, such as satellite photography, to Saddam's regime. Carlucci said: \\"My understanding is that what was provided\\" to Iraq \\"was general order of battle information, not operational intelligence.\\" \\"I certainly have no knowledge of U.S. participation in preparing battle and strike packages,\\" he said, \\"and doubt strongly that that occurred.\\" \\"I did agree that Iraq should not lose the war, but I certainly had no foreknowledge of their use of chemical weapons.\\" Secretary of State Powell, through a spokesman, said the officers' description of the program was \\"dead wrong,\\" but declined to discuss it. His deputy, Richard L. Armitage, a senior defense official at the time, used an expletive relayed through a spokesman to indicate his denial that the United States acquiesced in the use of chemical weapons.New York Times, August 18, 2002. Concern about the 1979 Islamic Revolution in Iran and about the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan prompted Iraq to reexamine seriously the nature of its relationship with the United States. This process led to a gradual warming of relations between the two countries. In 1981 Iraq and the United States engaged in low level, official talks on matters of mutual interest such as trade and regional security. In March 1982 the USA decided to remove Iraq from its list of countries supporting terrorism in order to be able to help Saddam Hussein to win the Iraq-Iran war. Following, the United States extended credits to Iraq for the purchase of American agricultural commodities, the first time this had been done since 1967. More significant, in 1983 the Baathist government hosted a United States special Middle East envoy, the highest-ranking American official to visit Baghdad in more than sixteen years. In a U.S. bid to open full diplomatic relations with Iraq, the country was removed from the U.S. list of State Sponsors of Terrorism. Ostensibly, this was because of improvement in the regime's record, although former United States Assistant Secretary of Defense Noel Koch later stated, \\"No one had any doubts about [the Iraqis'] continued involvement in terrorism ... The real reason was to help them succeed in the war against Iran.\\" In 1984, when the United States inaugurated \\"Operation Staunch\\" to halt shipment of arms to Iran by third countries, no similar embargo was attempted against Iraq because Iraq had expressed its desire to negotiate an end to the war. All of these initiatives prepared the ground for Iraq and the United States to reestablish diplomatic relations in November 1984. Iraq was the last of the Arab countries to resume diplomatic relations with the U.S. In early 1988, Iraq's relations with the United States were generally cordial. The relationship had been strained at the end of 1986 when it was revealed that the United States had secretly sold arms to Iran during 1985 and 1986, and a crisis occurred in May 1987 when an Iraqi pilot bombed an American naval ship in the Persian Gulf, a ship he mistakenly thought to be involved in Iran-related commerce. Nevertheless, the two countries had weathered these problems by mid-1987. Although lingering suspicions about the United States remained, Iraq welcomed greater, even if indirect, American diplomatic and military pressure in trying to end the war with Iran. For the most part, the Iraqi government believed the United States supported its position that the war was being prolonged only because of Iranian intransigence.  Gulf War and Iraq disarmament crisis  April Glaspie meets Saddam for an emergency meeting. On July 25, 1990 following tensions with Kuwait, Saddam met with United States Ambassador to Baghdad, April Glaspie, in one of the last high-level contacts between the two Governments before the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait on August 2, 1990. Iraqi Government officials published a transcript of the meeting, which also included the Iraqi Foreign Minister, Tariq Aziz. A copy was provided to The New York Times by ABC News, which was translated from Arabic. The U.S. State Department has declined to comment on its accuracy. Glaspie is quoted saying to Saddam: > I have a direct instruction from the President to seek better relations with > Iraq ... I know you need funds. We understand that and our opinion is that > you should have the opportunity to rebuild your country. But we have no > opinion on the Arab-Arab conflicts, like your border disagreement with > Kuwait. I was in the American Embassy in Kuwait during the late 60s [during > another Iraq-Kuwait border conflict].

But when this happens in the context of what you > said on your national day, then when we read the details in the two letters > of the Foreign Minister, then when we see the Iraqi point of view that the > measures taken by the U.A.E. and Kuwait is, in the final analysis, parallel > to military aggression against Iraq, then it would be reasonable for me to > be concerned. And for this reason, I received an instruction to ask you, in > the spirit of friendship‚Äînot in the spirit of confrontation‚Äîregarding your > intentions.Excerpts From Iraqi Document on Meeting With U.S. Envoy , New > York Times. September 23, 1990. However, Tariq Aziz told PBS Frontline in 1996 that the Iraqi leadership was under \\"no illusion\\" about America's likely response to the Iraqi invasion: \\"She [Glaspie] didn't tell us anything strange. She didn't tell us in the sense that we concluded that the Americans will not retaliate. That was nonsense you see. It was nonsense to think that the Americans would not attack us.\\"\\"The Gulf War\\", PBS Frontline. January 9, 1996. And in a second 2000 interview with the same television program, Aziz said: > There were no mixed signals.

Due to ongoing concerns over the security situation in Iraq, the U.S. State Department invalidated U.S. passports for travel to or through Iraq on February 8, 1991. The Gulf War cease-fire was negotiated at Safwan, Iraq on March 1, 1991, taking effect on April 11, 1991.Torreon, B.S. (2011). U.S. Periods of War and Dates of Current Conflicts. CRS Report for Congress. Congressional Research Service. Retrieved from https://fas.org/sgp/crs/natsec/RS21405.pdf According to former U.S. intelligence officials interviewed by The New York Times, the CIA indirectly supported a bomb and sabotage campaign between 1992 and 1995 in Iraq conducted by the Iraqi National Accord insurgents, led by Iyad Allawi. The campaign had no apparent effect in toppling Saddam's rule, but the CIA was also involved in a failed 1996 coup against Saddam \\\\- and in October 1998, regime change became official U.S. policy with enactment of the \\"Iraq Liberation Act.\\" As a result of the war, Iraq and the United States broke off diplomatic relations for a second time. From 1990 to 2003, Algeria served as Iraq's protecting power in Washington, while Poland served as the protecting power for the United States in Baghdad. Diplomatic relations would not be restored until the United States overthrew Saddam Hussein in 2003 and established an American-aligned government.  2003 invasion of Iraq  Embassy of Iraq in Washington, D.C. After the United Nations Security Council Resolution 687 and subsequent UN weapons inspectors inside Iraq there was a period of low-level hostilities between Iraq and the United States-led coalition from 1991. In late 2001, Bush administration began actively pressing for military intervention in Iraq. The primary rationalization was articulated by a joint resolution of the U.S. Congress known as the Iraq Resolution, stating that the intent was to remove \\"a regime that developed and used weapons of mass destruction, that harbored and supported terrorists, committed outrageous human rights abuses, and defied the just demands of the United Nations and the world.\\" In the lead-up to the invasion, the U.S. and U.K. emphasized the argument that Saddam Hussein was developing weapons of mass destruction and that he thus presented a threat to his neighbors and to the world community.UN Security Council Resolution 1441 Retrieved 30 January 2008 Throughout late 2001, 2002, and early 2003, the Bush Administration worked to build a case for invading Iraq, culminating in then Secretary of State Colin Powell's February 2003 address to the Security Council. Accusations of faulty evidence and alleged shifting rationales became the focal point for critics of the war, who charge that the Bush Administration purposely fabricated evidence to justify an invasion that it had long planned to launch. The invasion began on 20 March 2003, with the U.S., joined by the U.K. and several coalition allies, launching a \\"shock and awe\\" bombing campaign. Iraqi forces were quickly overwhelmed as U.S. forces swept through the country. The invasion led to the collapse of the Ba'athist government; Saddam was captured during Operation Red Dawn in December of that same year and executed by a military court three years later. However, the power vacuum following Saddam's demise and the mismanagement of the occupation led to widespread sectarian violence between Shias and Sunnis, as well as a lengthy insurgency against U.S. and coalition forces. The United States responded with a troop surge in 2007 to attempt to reduce the violence. Shortly after the invasion, the Central Intelligence Agency, Defense Intelligence Agency, and other intelligence agencies largely discredited evidence related to Iraqi weapons as well as links to Al-Qaeda, and at this point the Bush and Blair Administrations began to shift to secondary rationales for the war, such as the Hussein government's human rights record and promoting democracy in Iraq. UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan described the war as illegal, saying in a September 2004 interview that it was \\"not in conformity with the Security Council.\\" The U.S. began withdrawing its troops in the winter of 2007‚Äì08. The winding down of U.S. involvement in Iraq accelerated under President Barack Obama. The U.S. formally withdrew all combat troops from Iraq by December 2011.  Current status  U.S. President Donald Trump welcoming Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi at the White House Because of the primary roles taken by the United States and Britain in deposing Saddam Hussein and establishing interim governments to replace his regime, Iraq's relationships with those countries, particularly the United States, are expected to remain important for the foreseeable future. The Iraqi insurgency, later referred to as the Iraq Crisis, escalated after the withdrawal of U.S. troops in 2011, resulting in violent conflict with the central government, as well as sectarian violence among Iraq's religious groups. This escalated into a civil war with the conquest of Fallujah and Mosul and major areas in northern Iraq by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, also known as ISIS). This has resulted in airstrikes by Iran, Syria, and other countries ‚Äì including the United States In January 2017, US President Donald Trump issued an executive order banning the entry of all Iraqi citizens, as well as citizens of six other countries. After sharp criticism and public protests as well as lawsuits against the executive order, Trump relaxed the travel restrictions somewhat and dropped Iraq from the list of non-entry countries in March 2017. As of October 2019, United States continued to use Iraqi bases for conducting operations such as the Barisha raid. After a 2020 attack near Baghdad International airport, outgoing Prime Minister Adil Abdul-Mahdi condemned America's assassination and stated that the strike was an act of aggression and a breach of Iraqi sovereignty which would lead to war in Iraq. He said the strike violated the agreement on the presence of U.S. forces in Iraq and that safeguards for Iraq's security and sovereignty should be met with legislation. The media office of the Iraqi military's joint operations forces posted a photo of a destroyed vehicle on fire after the attack. The speaker of Iraq's parliament Mohammed al Halbousi vowed to \\"put an end to the U.S. presence\\" in Iraq. In August 2020, United States returned the Baath Party archives to Iraq, including more than 6 million pages, which were discovered in a basement under their headquarters in Baghdad in 2003, before being transferred to the United States in 2005, to be archived by the Hoover Institution. As per two Iraqi government sources, the US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Iraq‚Äôs President Barham Salih held a telephonic conversation in the mid of September 2020. In the call Pompeo discussed about bringing back US diplomats from Iraq followed by a threat to shut down the US Embassy in Iraq. Iraqi authorities feared the withdrawal of diplomat(s) would lead to military confrontation with Iran, blamed by the Washington for missile and bomb attacks.

He lives in Denver, Colorado, and describes himself as an entrepreneur and consultant. He is also a practitioner and teacher of Transcendental Meditation. Education Peckman attended Maharishi International University in Iowa for one year. Political career Candidate for United States Senate In 1998 Peckman ran for the United States Senate as a member of the Natural Law Party receiving 0.31% of the votes, and coming in fifth in a field of seven. Ballot Initiative 101: Safety Through Peace In 2003, Peckman got an initiative on the ballot in Denver which said \\"Shall the voters for the city and county of Denver adopt an initiative ordinance to require the city to help ensure public safety by increasing peacefulness?\\" The initiative failed to gain enough votes to pass. Ballot Initiative 300: Extraterrestrial Affairs Commission Since 2008 Peckman has attempted to create an Extraterrestrial Affairs Commission within the Denver city government, to prepare for visits from extraterrestrials. Peckman gathered 4000 signatures to place his proposal for the seven-member commission on the November 2008 general-election ballot in Denver. However, he declined to file the paperwork for the November 2008 election, in the hope that an incoming Obama administration would release material on extraterrestrials to the public. In 2009 the initiative received over 7000 signatures for the 2010 Ballot. After validation by the Denver Elections Division, it was determined that the number of valid signatures was insufficient leaving 1000 valid signatures still required. This insufficiency was resolved by the end of November 2009, and Initiative 300 was put on Denver's November 2010 election ballot. The initiative was opposed by a group calling itself M.I.B. In the election, initiative 300 was rejected by 82.34% of Denver voters. After this defeat, Peckman filed a complaint with the Denver Board of Ethics, where he questioned the \\"unethical, incompetent, and suspicious behavior\\" of Denver officials, whom he claimed assisted other \\"very disreputable, incompetent, unethical, and hostile persons\\" during the campaign, and further ponders whether these were acting in conjunction with the CIA, NSA, or other covert groups. The Denver ethics board dismissed this complaint \\"for lack of jurisdiction, and because the complaint did not deal with any issues that are covered by the Denver Code of Ethics\\". Denver Mayoral Candidacy Jeff Peckman appeared on the May 3, 2011 Denver Mayoral ballot in a field of 10 other candidates, though one had dropped out before the election. Out of over 110,000 votes cast, Peckman received only 796 votes, coming in second to last place. New Age Claims Metatron Technology He promotes Metatron Technology, which he says defends against \\"harmful electromagnetic waves\\" by transforming them into \\"desirable healthy energy\\". Extraterrestrials Peckman is an advocate for disclosure of UFO and extraterrestrial phenomena who gained media attention in 2008 when he publicly displayed a video of a purported extraterrestrial in Denver, Colorado. Peckman publicly screened the video on May 30, 2008 at Metropolitan State College in Denver and forbid photos by reporters. The three-minute video contained images of a \\"white creature with a balloon-shaped head\\" and large dark eyes that blinked and looked through a window said to be 8 feet above the ground. The video was said to have been made by Stan Romanek, July 17, 2003, in Nebraska. A documentary including the footage was scheduled for release in 2008 but was delayed. Area skeptics used a rented alien costume and video editing software to produce a hoax version of the video that reproduced many of the movements, although experts who viewed the Romanek video assert there was no post-production editing of that video. Rain Music In the summer of 2012, wildfires burning in the mountains of Colorado became the most destructive in the state's history. By the middle of June, the fires had destroyed over 180 homes and taken one life. Peckman's solution was to propose that certain music \\"replicates the frequencies present in nature when it rains\\", and that playing such music was historically proven to increase the chance of rain. He suggested local radio and broadcast stations, government frequencies, and people in the path of the fire, play this music. In the days after his proposal the fires worsened, bringing the destruction to at least 651 and taking six lives.

History The first stage of the line was opened from Tallarook to Yea in 1883, being extended in stages from 1889 though Molesworth, Cathkin, Merton and Maindample to reach Mansfield in 1891, located 117 kilometres from the junction. A short 7 kilometre long branch was also opened from Cathkin to Koriella in 1890, being extended another 7 kilometres to Alexandra in 1909. The line was a result of a decade of local lobbying, and provided improved access for agricultural products from the region to Melbourne markets. The line was quite scenic and included a 200 m tunnel near Cheviot and a viaduct over an arm of the Lake Eildon reservoir in Bonnie Doon, which was rebuilt in 1955 as part of the enlarging of the reservoir. The last regular passenger service operated to Mansfield on 28 May 1977 by 280hp Walker railmotor 91 RM. It was replaced by a bus service via Yarra Glen, but was rerouted via Whittlesea after road upgrades were carried out. By this point the track had deteriorated beyond Yea, and after March 1977 the majority of services beyond this point were buses. The line was closed on 8 November 1978 along with the branch line to Alexandra. The line was quickly dismantled following closure, preventing any chance of tourist services from operating along the line despite some interest being shown. Many bridges along the line were also removed with only the uprights remaining. The line has since been reopened as a 134 kilometre bike trail, the Great Victorian Rail Trail. The trail was funded by the Federal Government and local councils.

It does not teach the blending of sounds together as is done in Synthetic phonics. One method is to have students identify a common sound in a set of words that each contain that same sound. For example, the teacher and student discuss how the following words are alike: pat, park, push and pen. Analytic phonics is often taught together with levelled-reading books, look-say practice, and the use of aids such as phonics worksheets. Analytic phonics can also help with spelling. For example, a student learns that the initial sound in pig is the same as that in pen and pat, so they conclude that they must write that sound with the same letter (grapheme) \\"p\\". Sometimes, analytic phonics is referred to as Implicit phonics because the understanding of the sound-letters connection is implied and not necessarily taught directly. Analog phonics is a subset of analytic phonics that uses the onset-rhyme of many words. In the word snap, \\"sn\\" is the onset and \\"ap\\" is the rime (the part starting with the vowel). So, snap rhymes with map, sap, clap, and so on. Analytic phonics is different from Synthetic phonics (that starts at the individual sound/ phoneme level and builds up to the whole word), and Whole language (that starts at the word level and does not encourage the use of phonics). It may, however, be used as a part of the Balanced literacy approach. Practice and approach Implicit phonics is moving from the whole to the smallest parts; \\"blending-and- building\\" is not usually taught. A student will identify new words by its shape, beginning and ending letters, any context clues from the rest of the sentence or any accompanying pictures. Shortcomings of this approach A major problem with analytic phonic methods is the erroneous assumption that all students will already have the fairly sophisticated phonemic awareness skills needed to enable the comparison of sounds within the various words. Implicit instruction relies on readers \\"discovering\\" clues about sound- spelling relationships; good readers can do this, but poor readers are not likely to do so.Scholastic Controversy: analytic vs. synthetic approaches Phonics has become an acceptable practice and approach to teaching students to read. However, there are different methods in which it is used, and disagreement over which approach is best. There are two primary approaches to teaching phonics: analytic phonics and synthetic phonics. Both approaches require the learner to have some phonological awareness (the ability to hear and discriminate sounds in spoken words). Both approaches can also contribute to furthering the student's phonological development. Phonological awareness is an essential skill for reading, writing, listening and talking. Synthetic phonics involves the development of phonemic awareness from the outset. As part of the decoding process, the reader learns up to 44 phonemes (the smallest units of sound) and their related graphemes (the written symbols for the phoneme). In contrast, analytic phonics, involves the analysis of whole words to detect phonetic or orthographic (spelling) patterns, then splitting them into smaller parts to help with decoding.Learning and Teaching Scotland Supporters of Synthetic phonics argue that if the systematic teaching of phonics doesn't take place, analytic learners can fall behind and fail to develop the tools they need for decoding words.

The large African American population of the area as well as the city's rural surroundings have affected the types of festivals and culture produced within the city. Another major influence on the culture of the city is the annual Masters golf tournament held in April of each year. The most prolific cultural medium produced by the city is its musicians, as evidenced by James Brown, Jessye Norman, and Wycliffe Gordon. Though notably, the writer Frank Yerby and visual artist Jasper Johns were Augusta natives as well. Large events and festivals Augusta is host to a variety of annual events. The largest event held in the city each year is the Masters golf tournament bringing in around 250,000 visitors. One of the majors of the PGA tour, the Masters is also a major cultural influence on the city. Most semi- professional sports teams in the city are named for puns related to the tournament (the Augusta GreenJackets and the now defunct Augusta Lynx). Many establishments in the city, especially in the area around the Augusta National Golf Club, are also named in a similar manner. Restaurants throughout Augusta use memorabilia from the tournament as decor. Spring break for schools within the Richmond County School System coincides with the tournament, similarly to the timing of school breaks in New Orleans and Mardi Gras. Other annual events include the cultural festival Arts in the Heart of Augusta, the hip hop concert Mayfest, and the arts festival Westobou. The Rock Fore! Dough Concert is a charity concert held each year to coincide with the Masters golf tournament. The CSRA Classic, a traditional style marching band competition, is also held each year in Augusta.

They went international in 2000, when they performed at the \\"1000 years since the Vikings found America\\" celebration in New York City. The band gained critical acclaim for their second album, Get the Funk Out, which won the Icelandic Music Awards' 2001 \\"Album of the Year\\". The band and its many current and former members continue to be active in the Icelandic jazz scene. History The original lineup consisted of Da√∞i Birgisson (keyboards), Ingi S. Sk√∫lason (bass), J√≥n Indri√∞ason (drums), B√∂rkur H. Birgisson (guitar), Hrafn √Åsgeirsson (tenor sax) and Birkir Matt√≠asson (trumpet), who were interested in playing funk, soul and jazz. In the early days, Jag√∫ar performed in Reykjav√≠k, often playing covers of funk artists such as James Brown, Kool and the Gang, Herbie Hancock and others. The band was soon joined by Sam√∫el J√≥n Sam√∫elsson on trombone, along with drummer Sigf√∫s √ìttarsson (replacing J√≥n Indri√∞ason). At this time, the band started working on their first album, titled Jag√∫ar. 1999-2000 Jag√∫ar album Jag√∫ar released their debut album, Jag√∫ar, consisting of original instrumental material, in November 1999. In January 2000, Birkir and Hrafn left the band. Soon afterward, Kjartan H√°konarsson joined the band on trumpet, and the band toured Iceland in the Summer of 2000. That same Autumn, Jag√∫ar was a part of the \\"1000 years since the Vikings found America\\" celebration in New York City, where the band played an open-air concert at Pier 17. 2001 Get the Funk Out The band's second album, Get The Funk Out, was released in June 2001, along with the film Jag√∫ar, the Movie, a B-movie spin off. Eyj√≥lfur √ûorleifsson then joined the band on tenor saxophone, and Jag√∫ar toured Iceland again in the Summer of 2001, when they met Norwegian band \\"The Real Ones\\". In September 2001, Jag√∫ar went to Sweden to open for the Swedish metal band Sator. 2002 Album of the Year In February 2002, Get the Funk Out received the \\"Icelandic Music Award\\" for 2001 Album of the Year. Drummer Sigf√∫s left the band in February 2002, was briefly replaced by Erik Qvik, and then returned in July. That March, the band went to Norway and toured alongside The Real Ones. Trombone player Sam√∫el started adding more vocals to Jag√∫ar's music, and the band toured Belgium and the Netherlands. 2003 UK debut In early 2003, √ìskar Gu√∞j√≥nsson replaced Eyj√≥lfur on saxophone, and Jag√∫ar played their UK debut at The Jazz Caf√© in London. In April, the band played a late night show after their longtime hero Maceo Parker in Brussels, Belgium. Then √ìskar was replaced by Australian saxophonist Daniel Rorke. That May, the band went on a three-week tour through Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, Switzerland, Austria and UK. In September, the band returned to The Jazz Caf√© to promote their first UK release, That's Your Problem Baby on Freestyle Records. In October 2003, the band participated in a Tribute to Motown Show at Broadway theater, performing many of their favorite Motown songs, such as Marvin Gaye's \\"What's Going On\\" and The Temptations' \\"Papa Was a Rolling Stone\\". 2004 Dance You Idiot! Jag√∫ar appeared as a 14-piece big band at the Reykjav√≠k Art Festival in May 2004, performing the music of Icelandic jazz composer T√≥mas R. Einarsson. The concert was released on a live album titled Dance You Idiot! 2004-2005 Hello Somebody In July 2004, the band started working on their third album and performed at the Summer Stage festival in New York. Daniel Rorke was then replaced by √ìskar again on saxophone. Jamiroquai producer Al Stone and Mr. Dynamite came to Iceland in August to work with the band on their third album. Jag√∫ar then opened for James Brown in Reykjav√≠k in August. The third album, Hello Somebody, was released in November 2004. Jag√∫ar then performed with Harry Belafonte on Icelandic National Television in December. At the Icelandic Music Awards in February 2005, Jag√∫ar received four awards including \\"Best performer\\" and \\"Jazz Album of the year\\". Sigf√∫s left again in May and was replaced temporarily by Hj√∂rleifur J√≥nsson for a tour to Sweden and UK to promote the UK release of the One Of Us single. In June, Da√∞i and B√∂rkur also left the band, and in August, √ìmar Gu√∞j√≥nsson joined Jag√∫ar on guitar and J√≥hann Hj√∂rleifsson joined on drums. Meanwhile, with the addition of Sam√∫elsson's vocals, Hello Somebody was critically received as \\"easily Jag√∫ar‚Äôs most accessible effort to date.\\" 2006-2007 Shake It Good In August 2006, J√≥hann was replaced by Einar Scheving on drums, and Jag√∫ar started working on new material for their next album and preparing their live show for festivals and clubs. In February 2007, Jag√∫ar travelled to Denmark to make their fourth album, Shake It Good. Recordings were made at Lundg√•rd Studios in Denmark. Recordings and mix were completed at Hlj√≥√∞riti, Iceland March‚ÄìJune, and the album was released in August 2007. Awards To date, Jag√∫ar has received several awards, including five Icelandic Music Awards. In 2002, Get the Funk Out won \\"Album of the Year\\", and in 2005, Jag√∫ar received four more Icelandic Music Awards, including \\"Best Performer\\" and \\"Jazz Album of the Year\\". Additionally, in March 2003, Hello Somebody was selected as \\"Album of the Month\\" by Icelandic journal The Grapevine. Members While many members have come and gone, some staying only a few months, the only remaining founder of the band is bassist Ingi S. Sk√∫lason. While not a founding member, trombonist and vocalist Sam√∫el J√≥n Sam√∫elsson joined the band before the release of their debut, Jag√∫ar. The two are currently joined by Kjartan H√°konarson (trumpet), who joined soon after the Jag√∫ar release, and by √ìskar Gu√∞j√≥nsson (saxophone), √ìmar Gu√∞j√≥nsson (guitar) and Einar Scheving (drums). Drummer J√≥n Indri√∞ason was the first to separate from the band in 1999 and was replaced by Sigf√∫s √ìttarsson, who played off and on until 2005. Soon after the release of Jag√∫ar in 2000, fellow founders Hrafn √Åsgeirsson (tenor sax) and Birkir Matt√≠asson (trumpet) were next to leave the band. Remaining founders Da√∞i Birgisson (keyboards) and B√∂rkur H. Birgisson (guitar) remained until 2005.

The structure was built in 1900 and was closed in 1971 after being damaged in the 1971 Sylmar earthquake. It is the oldest building on Wilshire Boulevard and was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1972. The structure has fallen into a state of disrepair due to the lack of funds within the Dept. of Veterans Affairs to pay for the required repairs and renovation. Early history The Dept. of Veterans Affairs Medical Center in West Los Angeles was deeded to the federal government in 1888 to build the Pacific Branch of the National Home for Disabled Volunteer Soldiers. A series of Victorian dormitories were built in the 1890s, and Wadsworth Chapel was built in 1900 to provide a place of worship for the residents of the old soldiers‚Äô home. Architecture Front view in 2008 showing fallen railing and deteriorating paint The building actually contains two separate chapels separated by a double brick wall, with a Catholic chapel at the north end and a Protestant chapel at the south end. Each chapel has a separate entrance, with a tower and belfry. Designed by J. Lee Burton, Wadsworth Chapel had been called an \\"intricate little jewel box\\" by Christopher Alexander, the associate curator of architecture for the Getty Research Institute. The building is noted for its eclectic exterior ornamentation and its combination of Colonial Revival (sometimes classified as Romanesque Revival) and Carpenter Gothic Victorian architecture. The Los Angeles Cultural Heritage Board has described the Wadsworth Chapel and other original buildings on the Veterans campus as \\"the most monumental complex of Shingle-style Queen Anne structures ever constructed in the Los Angeles area.\\" The building was built at a cost of $12,400 in 1900 with redwood siding and 21 different types of windows. Though the exterior has been painted all white since 1941, the exterior was originally stained in dark earth tones, with white trim, as shown in old postcards of the chapel. The Protestant chapel was damaged by fire in 1955. The VA lacked funds to repair all of the fire damage, and the balcony of the Protestant chapel has been closed since that time. Deterioration and renovation proposals Closeup of deterioration at Wadsworth Chapel, 2008 North side, Catholic Chapel, 2008 Both chapels have been closed to the public since the 1971 Sylmar earthquake loosened the foundation and caused the northeast bell tower to pull away from a gable. Since 1971, the building has fallen into an ever-worsening state of disrepair, as the VA has been unable to fund necessary repair and restoration work. Despite its neglect for more than 35 years, preservation experts note that the building, the oldest remaining building on Wilshire Boulevard, is a prime candidate for ‚Äúarchitectural resurrection.‚Äù The VA has estimated the cost of renovation to be $11.5 million, with the required work including replacement of the masonry foundation, seismic retrofit and asbestos and lead paint removal. The expenditure of large sums to renovate the chapel has become a subject of controversy within the veteran community. With the VA lacking funds to provide necessary services to veterans of the Iraq War, many object to spending nearly $12 million to renovate a chapel that has been mothballed since 1972. In a 2007 Los Angeles Times article, one veteran reflected ambivalence about the proposed renovation: ‚ÄúThat is such a beautiful piece of workmanship and, yes, it cries out to be repaired..... At the same time, the veterans cry out to be repaired. It‚Äôs a moral issue.‚Äù Efforts by the Veterans Park Conservancy to raise private funds to pay for the renovation had been unsuccessful as of 2007. The Times noted: ‚ÄúThe oldest building on Wilshire Boulevard is a fixerupper duplex of a most unusual sort.‚Äù See also * List of Registered Historic Places in Los Angeles * Streetcar Depot, West Los Angeles References External links * Wadsworth Chapel preservation web site * West Los Angeles Veterans Affairs Old Soldiers Home website Category:Churches in Los Angeles Category:Roman Catholic churches in California Category:Chapels in the United States Category:Sawtelle, Los Angeles Category:Wilshire Boulevard Category:Roman Catholic churches completed in 1900 Category:History of Los Angeles Category:Properties of religious function on the National Register of Historic Places in Los Angeles Category:Towers completed in 1900 Category:Towers in California Category:Bell towers in the United States Category:Carpenter Gothic church buildings in California Category:Shingle Style church buildings Category:Romanesque Revival church buildings in California Category:Victorian architecture in California Category:Chapels in Los Angeles Category:Roman Catholic chapels in the United States Category:Shingle Style architecture in California ","title":"Wadsworth Chapel"},{"id":"17681681","text":"In solid-state physics, the k¬∑p perturbation theory is an approximated semi- empirical approach for calculating the band structure (particularly effective mass) and optical properties of crystalline solids. It is pronounced \\"k dot p\\", and is also called the \\"k¬∑p method\\". This theory has been applied specifically in the framework of the Luttinger‚ÄìKohn model (after Joaquin Mazdak Luttinger and Walter Kohn), and of the Kane model (after Evan O. Kane). Background and derivation Bloch's theorem and wavevectors According to quantum mechanics (in the single-electron approximation), the quasi-free electrons in any solid are characterized by wavefunctions which are eigenstates of the following stationary Schr√∂dinger equation: :\\\\left(\\\\frac{p^2}{2m}+V\\\\right)\\\\psi = E\\\\psi where p is the quantum-mechanical momentum operator, V is the potential, and m is the vacuum mass of the electron. (This equation neglects the spin‚Äìorbit effect; see below.) In a crystalline solid, V is a periodic function, with the same periodicity as the crystal lattice. Bloch's theorem proves that the solutions to this differential equation can be written as follows: :\\\\psi_{n,\\\\mathbf{k}}(\\\\mathbf{x}) = e^{i\\\\mathbf{k}\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{x}} u_{n,\\\\mathbf{k}}(\\\\mathbf{x}) where k is a vector (called the wavevector), n is a discrete index (called the band index), and un,k is a function with the same periodicity as the crystal lattice. For any given n, the associated states are called a band. In each band, there will be a relation between the wavevector k and the energy of the state En,k, called the band dispersion. Calculating this dispersion is one of the primary applications of k¬∑p perturbation theory. Perturbation theory The periodic function un,k satisfies the following Schr√∂dinger-type equation (simply, a direct expansion of the Schr√∂dinger equation with a Bloch-type wave function): :H_{\\\\mathbf{k}} u_{n,\\\\mathbf{k}}=E_{n,\\\\mathbf{k}}u_{n,\\\\mathbf{k}} where the Hamiltonian is :H_{\\\\mathbf{k}} = \\\\frac{p^2}{2m} + \\\\frac{\\\\hbar \\\\mathbf{k}\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{p}}{m} + \\\\frac{\\\\hbar^2 k^2}{2m} + V Note that k is a vector consisting of three real numbers with dimensions of inverse length, while p is a vector of operators; to be explicit, :\\\\mathbf{k}\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{p} = k_x (-i\\\\hbar \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial x}) + k_y (-i\\\\hbar \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial y}) + k_z (-i\\\\hbar \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial z}) In any case, we write this Hamiltonian as the sum of two terms: :H=H_0+H_{\\\\mathbf{k}}', \\\\;\\\\; H_0 = \\\\frac{p^2}{2m}+V, \\\\;\\\\; H_{\\\\mathbf{k}}' = \\\\frac{\\\\hbar^2 k^2}{2m} + \\\\frac{\\\\hbar \\\\mathbf{k}\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{p}}{m} This expression is the basis for perturbation theory. The \\"unperturbed Hamiltonian\\" is H0, which in fact equals the exact Hamiltonian at k = 0 (i.e., at the gamma point). The \\"perturbation\\" is the term H_{\\\\mathbf{k}}'. The analysis that results is called \\"k¬∑p perturbation theory\\", due to the term proportional to k¬∑p. The result of this analysis is an expression for En,k and un,k in terms of the energies and wavefunctions at k = 0\\\\. Note that the \\"perturbation\\" term H_{\\\\mathbf{k}}' gets progressively smaller as k approaches zero. Therefore, k¬∑p perturbation theory is most accurate for small values of k. However, if enough terms are included in the perturbative expansion, then the theory can in fact be reasonably accurate for any value of k in the entire Brillouin zone. Expression for a nondegenerate band For a nondegenerate band (i.e., a band which has a different energy at k = 0 from any other band), with an extremum at k = 0, and with no spin‚Äìorbit coupling, the result of k¬∑p perturbation theory is (to lowest nontrivial order): :u_{n,\\\\mathbf{k}} = u_{n,0}+\\\\frac{\\\\hbar}{m}\\\\sum_{n' eq n}\\\\frac{\\\\langle u_{n,0}  \\\\mathbf{k}\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{p}  u_{n',0} \\\\rangle}{E_{n,0}-E_{n',0}} u_{n',0} :E_{n,\\\\mathbf{k}} = E_{n,0}+\\\\frac{\\\\hbar^2 k^2}{2m} + \\\\frac{\\\\hbar^2}{m^2} \\\\sum_{n' eq n} \\\\frac{\\\\langle u_{n,0}  \\\\mathbf{k}\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{p}  u_{n',0} \\\\rangle ^2}{E_{n,0}-E_{n',0}} Since k is a vector of real numbers (rather than a vector of more complicated linear operators), the matrix element in these expressions can be rewritten as: :\\\\langle u_{n,0}  \\\\mathbf{k}\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{p}  u_{n',0} \\\\rangle = \\\\mathbf{k} \\\\cdot \\\\langle u_{n,0}  \\\\mathbf{p}  u_{n',0} \\\\rangle Therefore, one can calculate the energy at any k using only a few unknown parameters, namely En,0 and \\\\langle u_{n,0}  \\\\mathbf{p}  u_{n',0} \\\\rangle. The latter are called \\"optical matrix elements\\", closely related to transition dipole moments. These parameters are typically inferred from experimental data. In practice, the sum over n often includes only the nearest one or two bands, since these tend to be the most important (due to the denominator). However, for improved accuracy, especially at larger k, more bands must be included, as well as more terms in the perturbative expansion than the ones written above. =Effective mass= Using the expression above for the energy dispersion relation, a simplified expression for the effective mass in the conduction band of a semiconductor can be found. To approximate the dispersion relation in the case of the conduction band, take the energy En0 as the minimum conduction band energy Ec0 and include in the summation only terms with energies near the valence band maximum, where the energy difference in the denominator is smallest. (These terms are the largest contributions to the summation.) This denominator is then approximated as the band gap Eg, leading to an energy expression: :E_c(\\\\boldsymbol k ) \\\\approx E_{c0} +\\\\frac{(\\\\hbar k)^2}{2m} +\\\\frac{\\\\hbar ^2}{{E_g}m^2}\\\\sum_n {\\\\langle u_{c,0}\\\\mathbf{k}\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{p} u_{n,0} \\\\rangle ^2} The effective mass in direction ‚Ñì is then: : \\\\frac{1} {{m}_{\\\\ell}} = {{1} \\\\over {\\\\hbar^2}} \\\\sum_{ m} \\\\cdot {{\\\\partial^{2} E_{c} (\\\\boldsymbol{k})} \\\\over {\\\\partial k_{\\\\ell} \\\\partial k_ m}} \\\\approx \\\\frac{1}{m}+\\\\frac{2}{E_gm^2}\\\\sum_{m,\\\\ n} {\\\\langle u_{c,0}p_{\\\\ell} u_{n,0} \\\\rangle }{\\\\langle u_{n,0}p_{m} u_{c,0} \\\\rangle } Ignoring the details of the matrix elements, the key consequences are that the effective mass varies with the smallest bandgap and goes to zero as the gap goes to zero. A useful approximation for the matrix elements in direct gap semiconductors is:A direct gap semiconductor is one where the valence band maximum and conduction band minimum occur at the same position in k-space, usually the so-called Œì-point where k = 0. :\\\\frac{2}{E_gm^2}\\\\sum_{m,\\\\ n} {\\\\langle u_{c,0}p_{\\\\ell} u_{n,0} \\\\rangle }{\\\\langle u_{c,0}p_{m} u_{n,0} \\\\rangle } \\\\approx 20\\\\mathrm{eV} \\\\frac{1}{mE_{g}} \\\\ , which applies within about 15% or better to most group- IV, III-V and II-VI semiconductors.See Table 2.22 in Yu & Cardona, op. cit. In contrast to this simple approximation, in the case of valence band energy the spin‚Äìorbit interaction must be introduced (see below) and many more bands must be individually considered. The calculation is provided in Yu and Cardona.See Yu & Cardona, op. cit. pp. 75‚Äì82 In the valence band the mobile carriers are holes. One finds there are two types of hole, named heavy and light, with anisotropic masses. k¬∑p model with spin‚Äìorbit interaction Including the spin‚Äìorbit interaction, the Schr√∂dinger equation for u is: :H_{\\\\mathbf{k}} u_{n,\\\\mathbf{k}}=E_{n,\\\\mathbf{k}}u_{n,\\\\mathbf{k}} where :H_{\\\\mathbf{k}} = \\\\frac{p^2}{2m} + \\\\frac{\\\\hbar}{m}\\\\mathbf{k}\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{p} + \\\\frac{\\\\hbar^2 k^2}{2m} + V + \\\\frac{\\\\hbar}{4 m^2 c^2} ( abla V \\\\times (\\\\mathbf{p}+\\\\hbar\\\\mathbf{k}))\\\\cdot \\\\vec \\\\sigma where \\\\vec \\\\sigma=(\\\\sigma_x,\\\\sigma_y,\\\\sigma_z) is a vector consisting of the three Pauli matrices. This Hamiltonian can be subjected to the same sort of perturbation- theory analysis as above. Calculation in degenerate case For degenerate or nearly degenerate bands, in particular the valence bands in certain materials such as gallium arsenide, the equations can be analyzed by the methods of degenerate perturbation theory. Models of this type include the \\"Luttinger‚ÄìKohn model\\" (a.k.a. \\"Kohn‚ÄìLuttinger model\\"), and the \\"Kane model\\". Generally, an effective Hamiltonian H^{\\\\rm{eff}} is introduced, and to the first order, its matrix elements can be expressed as :H^{\\\\rm{eff}}_{\\\\mathbf{k},mn}=\\\\langle u_{m,0}H_0u_{n,0}\\\\rangle + \\\\mathbf{k}\\\\cdot \\\\langle u_{m,0} abla _\\\\mathbf{k} H_\\\\mathbf{k}'u_{n,0}\\\\rangle After solving it, the wave functions and energy bands are obtained.

Beck spent the first five seasons of his career with the Cubs. After making his major league debut on May 19, 1926, Beck was used as a reserve second baseman for the Cubs, playing in 30 games and finishing with a .198 batting average, only one extra-base hit (a home run), and 4 RBI. The next season, he was in the Cubs' lineup more often than not, playing in 117 games. He saw some time at third base and shortstop as well as his familiar second base position. His .258 average would prove to be the best of his career, as would his tally of doubles (20) and triples (5). During the 1928 campaign, Beck saw considerably more time at third base (87 games) and shortstop (47 games) than second base (1 game). Freddie Maguire had become the everyday second sacker, but Beck had certainly become an infield fixture for the Cubs. He posted career highs in at-bats, runs, hits, and RBI, batting a solid .257 as Chicago fell just four wins short of first place and a trip to the World Series. In 1929, Rogers Hornsby, Norm McMillan and Woody English proved to be a dependable trio of infielders for the club and Beck was again relegated to backup status. He played in just 54 games and batted only .211, collecting a mere seven extra-base hits all year, all of them doubles. Though the Cubs made the World Series after the season, Beck did not appear in any of the Series' five games as the Philadelphia Athletics won four games to one. Beck saw some increased playing time in 1930; in fact, he played more games at shortstop than any Cub except English, who split his time almost evenly between shortstop and third base. He also saw somewhat of a power surge, hitting a career-high six home runs in 244 at-bats. In fact, that matched the total number of home runs he'd hit in 1,145 at-bats over his first four seasons. However, his batting average was again low at .213, and the Cubs put Beck on waivers after the season ended. Claimed by the Cincinnati Reds for 1931, Beck found himself as a backup third baseman and occasional shortstop, and his numbers plummeted. He managed to hit just .154 in 53 games and played his last game in the majors on September 11, 1931. Beck died on July 15, 1988 in Temple City, California.

Early life and education  Ambriz played high school soccer at Rio Mesa High School in Oxnard, California. He was a three-time All-Channel League and two-time All-California Interscholastic Federation player, as well as being the Channel League MVP in his senior season en route to the Spartans winning the Channel League title. He set school records with 30 goals in a season and 58 career goals. Ambriz moved on to Santa Barbara City College, then coached by Tim Vom Steeg. During his freshman season he accumulated twenty-four goals and eleven assists for fifty-nine points on the 1997 State Final Four team. However, he had to redshirt his entire sophomore year due to a season-ending injury before play started. Ambriz transferred to the University of California, Santa Barbara and played for the UC Santa Barbara Gauchos men's soccer team. He played with UCSB for three seasons, completing his sophomore through senior years with UCSB. As a junior, Ambriz appeared in fourteen games, tallying six goals and one assist for thirteen points. He was second on the team in scoring, trailing only Thiago Martins despite playing four less games. As a senior, Ambriz appeared in the same number of games (fourteen), but could only manage three goals and six assists for twelve points. Most of the goal scoring went to emerging star Rob Friend. Ambriz finished third in scoring, trailing Friend and Drew McAthy (four goals, five assists, thirteen points), but finishing above other professionals in Nate Boyden (four goals, eight points), Tony Lochhead (one goal, six assists, eight points), and Neil Jones (three goals, one assist, seven points).  Professional career  After graduating from UCSB with a psychology degree, Ambriz sought a professional career. He moved to Switzerland and played with SV Lyss, FC Winterthur, and FC Concordia Basel from 2002 to 2005. With Lyss, he scored twenty-four goals in his first season, a total that led the league. In 2004, he had an unsuccessful trial with BSC Young Boys. In 2006, Jaime traveled back to the United States and signed with the Portland Timbers. The signing was announced on June 29, 2006. It was announced Ambriz was re-signed for the following season on April 20, 2007, on a one-year contract. He appeared in 4 games during his two seasons with the club, but was not re-signed for a third season. In 2008, Ambriz signed for Ventura County Fusion of the Premier Development League. He appeared in 9 games for the club. Recently, he has been playing with the amateur sides in the United States Adult Soccer Association-affiliated La Gran Liga de Oxnard based in Oxnard, California.

Brain to body size scales allometrically. Small bodied mammals have relatively large brains compared to their bodies whereas large mammals (such as whales) have smaller brain to body ratios. If brain weight is plotted against body weight for primates, the regression line of the sample points can indicate the brain power of a primate species. Lemurs for example fall below this line which means that for a primate of equivalent size, we would expect a larger brain size. Humans lie well above the line indicating that humans are more encephalized than lemurs. In fact, humans are more encephalized than all other primates.  Early history of brain development  One approach to understanding overall brain evolution is to use a paleoarchaeological timeline to trace the necessity for ever increasing complexity in structures that allow for chemical and electrical signaling. Because brains and other soft tissues do not fossilize as readily as mineralized tissues, scientists often look to other structures as evidence in the fossil record to get an understanding of brain evolution. This, however, leads to a dilemma as the emergence of organisms with more complex nervous systems with protective bone or other protective tissues that can then readily fossilize occur in the fossil record before evidence for chemical and electrical signaling. Recent evidence has shown that the ability to transmit electrical and chemical signals existed even before more complex multicellular lifeforms. Fossilization of brain, or other soft tissue, is possible however, and scientists can infer that the first brain structure appeared at least 521 million years ago, with fossil brain tissue present in sites of exceptional preservation. Another approach to understanding brain evolution is to look at extant organisms that do not possess complex nervous systems, comparing anatomical features that allow for chemical or electrical messaging. For example, choanoflagellates are organisms that possess various membrane channels that are crucial to electrical signaling. The membrane channels of choanoflagellates‚Äô are homologous to the ones found in animal cells, and this is supported by the evolutionary connection between early choanoflagellates and the ancestors of animals. Another example of extant organisms with the capacity to transmit electrical signals would be the glass sponge, a multicellular organism, which is capable of propagating electrical impulses without the presence of a nervous system. Before the evolutionary development of the brain, nerve nets, the simplest form of a nervous system developed. These nerve nets were a sort of precursor for the more evolutionarily advanced brains. They were first observed in Cnidaria and consist of a number of neurons spread apart that allow the organism to respond to physical contact. They are able to rudimentarily detect food and other chemicals but these nerve nets do not allow them to detect the source of the stimulus. Ctenophores also demonstrate this crude precursor to a brain or centralized nervous system, however, they phylogenetically diverged before the phylum Porifera and Cnidaria. There are two current theories on the emergence of nerve nets. One theory is that nerve nets may have developed independently in Ctenophores and Cnidarians. The other theory states that a common ancestor may have developed nerve nets, but they were lost in Porifera. A trend in brain evolution according to a study done with mice, chickens, monkeys and apes concluded that more evolved species tend to preserve the structures responsible for basic behaviors. A long term human study comparing the human brain to the primitive brain found that the modern human brain contains the primitive hindbrain region ‚Äì what most neuroscientists call the protoreptilian brain. The purpose of this part of the brain is to sustain fundamental homeostatic functions. The pons and medulla are major structures found there. A new region of the brain developed in mammals about 250 million years after the appearance of the hindbrain. This region is known as the paleomammalian brain, the major parts of which are the hippocampi and amygdalas, often referred to as the limbic system. The limbic system deals with more complex functions including emotional, sexual and fighting behaviors. Of course, animals that are not vertebrates also have brains, and their brains have undergone separate evolutionary histories. The brainstem and limbic system are largely based on nuclei, which are essentially balled-up clusters of tightly-packed neurons and the axon fibers that connect them to each other, as well as to neurons in other locations. The other two major brain areas (the cerebrum and cerebellum) are based on a cortical architecture. At the outer periphery of the cortex, the neurons are arranged into layers (the number of which vary according to species and function) a few millimeters thick. There are axons that travel between the layers, but the majority of axon mass is below the neurons themselves. Since cortical neurons and most of their axon fiber tracts don't have to compete for space, cortical structures can scale more easily than nuclear ones. A key feature of cortex is that because it scales with surface area, more of it can be fit inside a skull by introducing convolutions, in much the same way that a dinner napkin can be stuffed into a glass by wadding it up. The degree of convolution is generally greater in species with more complex behavior, which benefits from the increased surface area. The cerebellum, or \\"little brain,\\" is behind the brainstem and below the occipital lobe of the cerebrum in humans. Its purposes include the coordination of fine sensorimotor tasks, and it may be involved in some cognitive functions, such as language. Human cerebellar cortex is finely convoluted, much more so than cerebral cortex. Its interior axon fiber tracts are called the arbor vitae, or Tree of Life. The area of the brain with the greatest amount of recent evolutionary change is called the neocortex. In reptiles and fish, this area is called the pallium, and is smaller and simpler relative to body mass than what is found in mammals. According to research, the cerebrum first developed about 200 million years ago. It's responsible for higher cognitive functions - for example, language, thinking, and related forms of information processing. It's also responsible for processing sensory input (together with the thalamus, a part of the limbic system that acts as an information router). Most of its function is subconscious, that is, not available for inspection or intervention by the conscious mind. The neocortex is an elaboration, or outgrowth, of structures in the limbic system, with which it is tightly integrated.  Role of embryology in the evolution of the brain  Further information: Embryology In addition to studying the fossil record, evolutionary history can be investigated via embryology. An embryo is an unborn/unhatched animal and evolutionary history can be studied by observing how processes in embryonic development are conserved (or not conserved) across species. Similarities between different species may indicate evolutionary connection. One way anthropologists study evolutionary connection between species is by observing orthologs. An ortholog is defined as two or more homologous genes between species that are evolutionarily related by linear descent. Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP), a growth factor that plays a significant role in embryonic neural development, is highly conserved amongst vertebrates, as is sonic hedgehog (SHH), a morphogen that inhibits BMP to allow neural crest development.  Randomizing access and scaling brains up  Some animal phyla have gone through major brain enlargement through evolution (e.g. vertebrates and cephalopods both contain many lineages in which brains have grown through evolution) but most animal groups are composed only of species with extremely small brains. Some scientists argue that this difference is due to vertebrate and cephalopod neurons having evolved ways of communicating that overcome the scalability problem of neural networks while most animal groups have not. They argue that the reason why traditional neural networks fail to improve their function when they scale up is because filtering based on previously known probabilities cause self-fulfilling prophecy-like biases that create false statistical evidence giving a completely false worldview and that randomized access can overcome this problem and allow brains to be scaled up to more discriminating conditioned reflexes at larger brains that lead to new worldview forming abilities at certain thresholds. This is explained by randomization allowing the entire brain to eventually get access to all information over the course of many shifts even though instant privileged access is physically impossible. They cite that vertebrate neurons transmit virus-like capsules containing RNA that are sometimes read in the neuron to which it is transmitted and sometimes passed further on unread which creates randomized access, and that cephalopod neurons make different proteins from the same gene which suggests another mechanism for randomization of concentrated information in neurons, both making it evolutionarily worth scaling up brains.  Brain re-arrangement  With the use of in vivo Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and tissue sampling, different cortical samples from members of each hominoid species were analyzed. In each species, specific areas were either relatively enlarged or shrunken, which can detail neural organizations. Different sizes in the cortical areas can show specific adaptations, functional specializations and evolutionary events that were changes in how the hominoid brain is organized. In early prediction it was thought that the frontal lobe, a large part of the brain that is generally devoted to behavior and social interaction, predicted the differences in behavior between hominoid and humans. Discrediting this theory was evidence supporting that damage to the frontal lobe in both humans and hominoids show atypical social and emotional behavior; thus, this similarity means that the frontal lobe was not very likely to be selected for reorganization. Instead, it is now believed that evolution occurred in other parts of the brain that are strictly associated with certain behaviors. The reorganization that took place is thought to have been more organizational than volumetric; whereas the brain volumes were relatively the same but specific landmark position of surface anatomical features, for example, the lunate sulcus suggest that the brains had been through a neurological reorganization. There is also evidence that the early hominin lineage also underwent a quiescent period, which supports the idea of neural reorganization. Dental fossil records for early humans and hominins show that immature hominins, including australopithecines and members of Homo, have a quiescent period (Bown et al. 1987). A quiescent period is a period in which there are no dental eruptions of adult teeth; at this time the child becomes more accustomed to social structure, and development of culture. During this time the child is given an extra advantage over other hominoids, devoting several years into developing speech and learning to cooperate within a community. This period is also discussed in relation to encephalization. It was discovered that chimpanzees do not have this neutral dental period and suggest that a quiescent period occurred in very early hominin evolution. Using the models for neurological reorganization it can be suggested the cause for this period, dubbed middle childhood, is most likely for enhanced foraging abilities in varying seasonal environments. To understand the development of human dentition, taking a look at behavior and biology. Genetic factors contributing to modern evolution Bruce Lahn, the senior author at the Howard Hughes Medical Center at the University of Chicago and colleagues have suggested that there are specific genes that control the size of the human brain. These genes continue to play a role in brain evolution, implying that the brain is continuing to evolve. The study began with the researchers assessing 214 genes that are involved in brain development. These genes were obtained from humans, macaques, rats and mice. Lahn and the other researchers noted points in the DNA sequences that caused protein alterations. These DNA changes were then scaled to the evolutionary time that it took for those changes to occur. The data showed the genes in the human brain evolved much faster than those of the other species. Once this genomic evidence was acquired, Lahn and his team decided to find the specific gene or genes that allowed for or even controlled this rapid evolution. Two genes were found to control the size of the human brain as it develops. These genes are Microcephalin and Abnormal Spindle-like Microcephaly (ASPM). The researchers at the University of Chicago were able to determine that under the pressures of selection, both of these genes showed significant DNA sequence changes. Lahn's earlier studies displayed that Microcephalin experienced rapid evolution along the primate lineage which eventually led to the emergence of Homo sapiens. After the emergence of humans, Microcephalin seems to have shown a slower evolution rate. On the contrary, ASPM showed its most rapid evolution in the later years of human evolution once the divergence between chimpanzees and humans had already occurred. Each of the gene sequences went through specific changes that led to the evolution of humans from ancestral relatives. In order to determine these alterations, Lahn and his colleagues used DNA sequences from multiple primates then compared and contrasted the sequences with those of humans. Following this step, the researchers statistically analyzed the key differences between the primate and human DNA to come to the conclusion, that the differences were due to natural selection. The changes in DNA sequences of these genes accumulated to bring about a competitive advantage and higher fitness that humans possess in relation to other primates. This comparative advantage is coupled with a larger brain size which ultimately allows the human mind to have a higher cognitive awareness.  Evolution of the human brain  One of the prominent ways of tracking the evolution of the human brain is through direct evidence in the form of fossils. The evolutionary history of the human brain shows primarily a gradually bigger brain relative to body size during the evolutionary path from early primates to hominids and finally to Homo sapiens. Because fossilized brain tissue is rare, a more reliable approach is to observe anatomical characteristics of the skull that offer insight into brain characteristics. One such method is to observe the endocranial cast (also referred to as endocasts). Endocasts occur when, during the fossilization process, the brain deteriorates away, leaving a space that is filled by surrounding sedimentary material overtime. These casts, give an imprint of the lining of the brain cavity, which allows a visualization of what was there. This approach, however, is limited in regard to what information can be gathered. Information gleaned from endocasts is primarily limited to the size of the brain (cranial capacity or endocranial volume), prominent sulci and gyri, and size of dominant lobes or regions of the brain. While endocasts are extremely helpful in revealing superficial brain anatomy, they cannot reveal brain structure, particularly of deeper brain areas. By determining scaling metrics of cranial capacity as it relates to total number of neurons present in primates, it is also possible to estimate the number of neurons through fossil evidence. Despite the limitations to endocasts, they can and do provide a basis for understanding human brain evolution, which shows primarily a gradually bigger brain. The evolutionary history of the human brain shows primarily a gradually bigger brain relative to body size during the evolutionary path from early primates to hominins and finally to Homo sapiens. This trend that has led to the present day human brain size indicates that there has been a 2-3 factor increase in size over the past 3 million years. This can be visualized with current data on hominin evolution, starting with Australopithecus‚Äîa group of hominins from which humans are likely descended. Australopiths lived from 3.85-2.95 million years ago with the general cranial capacity somewhere near that of the extant chimpanzee‚Äîaround 300‚Äì500 cm3. Considering that the volume of the modern human brain is around 1,352 cm3 on average this represents a substantial amount of brain mass evolved. Australopiths are estimated to have a total neuron count of ~30-35 billion. Progressing along the human ancestral timeline, brain size continues to steadily increase (see Homininae) when moving into the era of Homo. For example, Homo habilis, living 2.4 million to 1.4 million years ago and argued to be the first Homo species based on a host of characteristics, had a cranial capacity of around 600 cm3. Homo habilis is estimated to have had ~40 billion neurons. A little closer to present day, Homo heidelbergensis lived from around 700,000 to 200,000 years ago and had a cranial capacity of around 1290 cm3 and having around 76 billion neurons. Homo neaderthalensis, living 400,000 to 40,000 years ago, had a cranial capacity comparable to than modern humans at around 1500‚Äì1600 cm3on average, with some specimens of Neanderthal having even greater cranial capacity. Neanderthals are estimated to have had around 85 billion neurons. The increase in brain size topped with Neanderthals, possibly due to their larger visual systems. It is also important to note that the measure of brain mass or volume, seen as cranial capacity, or even relative brain size, which is brain mass that is expressed as a percentage of body mass, are not a measure of intelligence, use, or function of regions of the brain. Total neurons, however, also do not indicate a higher ranking in cognitive abilities. Elephants have a higher number of total neurons (257 billion) compared to humans (100 billion). Relative brain size, overall mass, and total number of neurons are only a few metrics that help scientists follow the evolutionary trend of increased brain to body ratio through the hominin phylogeny.  Evolution of the neocortex  In addition to just the size of the brain, scientists have observed changes in the folding of the brain, as well as in the thickness of the cortex. The more convoluted the surface of the brain is, the greater the surface area of the cortex which allows for an expansion of cortex, the most evolutionarily advanced part of the brain. Greater surface area of the brain is linked to higher intelligence as is the thicker cortex but there is an inverse relationship‚Äîthe thicker the cortex, the more difficult it is for it to fold. In adult humans, thicker cerebral cortex has been linked to higher intelligence. The neocortex is the most advanced and most evolutionarily young part of the human brain. It is six layers thick and is only present in mammals. It is especially prominent in humans and is the location of most higher level functioning and cognitive ability. The six-layered neocortex found in mammals is evolutionarily derived from a three-layer cortex present in all modern reptiles. This three-layer cortex is still conserved in some parts of the human brain such as the hippocampus and is believed to have evolved in mammals to the neocortex during the transition between the Triassic and Jurassic periods. The three layers of this reptilian cortex correlate strongly to the first, fifth and sixth layers of the mammalian neocortex. Across species of mammals, primates have greater neuronal density compared to rodents of similar brain mass and this may account for increased intelligence.

It provides network administrators a method of creating a computing cluster, which allows them to exploit previously unused computational power for calculations that can be divided easily into smaller operations, such as Mandelbrot maps. The setup of an Xgrid cluster can be achieved at next to no cost, as Xgrid client is pre-installed on all computers running Mac OS X 10.4 to Mac OS X 10.7. The Xgrid client was not included in Mac OS X 10.8. The Xgrid controller, the job scheduler of the Xgrid operation, is also included within Mac OS X Server and as a free download from Apple. Apple has kept the command-line job control mechanism minimalist while providing an API to develop more sophisticated tools built around it. The program employs its own communication protocol layered on top of a schema to communicate to other nodes. This communication protocol interfaces with the BEEP infrastructure, a network application protocol framework. Computers discovered by the Xgrid system, that is computers with Mac OS X's Xgrid service enabled, are automatically added to the list of available computers to use for processing tasks. When the initiating computer sends the complete instructions, or job, for processing to the controller, the controller splits the task up into these small instruction packets, known as tasks. The design of the Xgrid system consists of these small packets being transferred to all the Xgrid-enabled computers on the network. These computers, or nodes, execute the instructions provided by the controller and then return the results. The controller assembles the individual task results into the whole job results and returns them to the initiating computer. Apple modeled the design of Xgrid on the Zilla program, distributed with NeXT's OPENSTEP operating system application programming interface (API), which Apple owned the rights to. The company also opted to provide the client version of Mac OS X with only command-line functions and little flexibility, while giving the Mac OS X Server version of Xgrid a GUI control panel and a full set of features.  History  Zilla Xgrid's original concept can be traced back to Zilla.app, found in the OPENSTEP operating system, created by NeXT in the late 1980s. Zilla was the first distributed computing program released on an end- user operating system and which used the idle screen-saver motif, a design feature since found in widely used projects such as Seti@Home and Distributed.net. Zilla won the national Computerworld Smithsonian Award (Science Category) in 1991 for ease of use and good design. Apple acquired Zilla, along with the rest of NeXT, in 1997 and later used Zilla as inspiration for Xgrid. The first beta version of Xgrid was released in January 2004. Several organizations have adopted Xgrid in large international computing networks. One example of an Xgrid cluster is MacResearch's OpenMacGrid, where scientists can request access to large amounts of processing power to run tasks related to their research. Another was the now defunct Xgrid@Stanford project, which used a range of computers on the Stanford University campus and around the world to perform biochemical research. In a pre-release promotional piece, MacWorld cited Xgrid among the Unix features in \\"10 Things to Know about TIGER\\", calling it \\"handy if you work with huge amounts of experimental data or render complex animations\\". (Subscription required) After Xgrid's introduction in 2004, InfoWorld noted that it was a \\"'preview' grade technology\\" which would directly benefit from the Xserve G5's launch later that year. (Subscription required) InfoWorld commentator Ephraim Schwartz also predicted that Xgrid was an opening move in Apple's entry into the enterprise computing market. (Subscription required) Apple discontinued Xgrid with OS X v10.8 (Mountain Lion), along with dependent services such as Podcast Producer.  Protocol  Xgrid Protocol The Xgrid protocol uses the BEEP network framework to communicate with nodes on the network. The system's infrastructure includes three types of computers which communicate over the protocol. One is the client, which communicates the calculation. Next is the controller, which starts and segregates the calculation. Finally, the agents process their own allocated part of the calculation. A computer can act as one or all three of these components at the same time. The Xgrid protocol provides the basic infrastructure for computers to communicate, but is not involved in the processing of the specified calculation. Xgrid is targeted towards time-consuming computations that can be easily segregated into smaller tasks, sometimes called embarrassingly parallel tasks. This includes Monte Carlo calculations, 3D rendering and Mandelbrot maps. Within the Xgrid protocol, three types of messages can be passed to other computers on the same cluster: requests, notifications and replies. Requests must be responded to by the recipient with a reply, notifications do not require a reply, and replies are responses to sent messages. They are identified by their name, type (request/notification/reply) and contents. Each message is encapsulated in a BEEP message (BEEP MSG) and is acknowledged on receipt by an empty reply (RPY). Xgrid does not leverage BEEPs message/reply infrastructure. Any received message which requires a response merely generates an independent BEEP message containing the reply. The Xgrid messages are encoded as dictionaries of key/value pairs which are converted to XML before being sent across the BEEP network.  Architecture  The architecture of the Xgrid system is designed around a job based system; the controller sends agents jobs, and the agents return the responses. The actual computation that the controller executes in an Xgrid system is known as a job. The job contains all the files required to complete the task successfully, such as the input parameters, data files, directories, executables and/or shell scripts, the files included in an Xgrid job must be able to be executed either simultaneously or asynchronously, or any benefits of running such a job on an Xgrid is lost. Once the job completes, the controller can be set to notify the client of the task's completion or failure, for example by email. The client can leave the network while the tasks are running. It can also monitor the job status on demand by querying the controller, although it cannot track the ongoing progress of individual tasks. The controller is central to the correct function of an Xgrid, as this node is responsible for the distribution, supervision and coordination of tasks on agents. The program running on the controller can assign and reassign tasks to handle individual agent failures on demand. The number of tasks assigned to an agent depend on two factors: the number of agents on an Xgrid and the number of processors in each node. The number of agents on an Xgrid determines how the controller will assign tasks. The tasks may be assigned simultaneously for a large number of agents, or queued for a small number of agents. When a node with more than one processor is detected on an Xgrid, the controller may assign one task per processor; this only occurs if the number of agents on the network is lower than the number of tasks the controller has to complete. Xgrid is layered upon the Blocks Extensible Exchange Protocol (BEEP), an IETF standard comparable to HTTP, but with a focus on two-way multiplexed communication, such as that found in peer-to-peer networks. BEEP, in turn, uses XML to define profiles for communicating between multiple agents over a single network or internet connection.  Interface  Xgrid administration tool While it is possible to access Xgrid from the command line, the Xgrid graphical user interface, a program bundled with Mac OS X Server and, as of March 2009, available online, is a much more efficient way of administering an Xgrid system. Originally, the Xgrid agent was included in all Mac OS X version 10.4 installations but the GUI was reserved for users of Mac OS X Server. This decision limited the efforts of the computer community to embrace the platform. Eventually, Apple released the Mac OS X Server Administration Tools to the public, which included the Xgrid administration application bundled with Mac OS X Server. Despite the lack of a graphical controller interface in the standard (non- server) Mac OS X distribution, it is possible to set up an Xgrid controller via the command line tools \`xgridctl\` and \`xgrid\`.For explicit instructions on setting up an xgrid controller without needing an OSX server see http://tengrid.com/wiki1/index.php?title=XGRID_FAQ Once the Xgrid controller daemon is running, administration of the grid with Apple's Xgrid Admin tool is possible. Some applications, such as VisualHub, provided Xgrid controller capability through their user interfaces.

Robert Birch was arrested for his part in the torture-murder of Colonel George Davenport but because he broke out of jail in 1847, through outside help or bribery, in Knoxville, Illinois his case never went to trial and he vanished without a trace.

Robert H. \\"Three-Fingered\\" Birch, born Robert Henry Birch (c. 1827 ‚Äì c. 1866), was a 19th-century American adventurer, criminal, soldier, lawman, postmaster, and prospector. He was a member of the infamous \\"Banditti of the Prairie\\" in his youth, whose involvement in the torture-murder of Colonel George Davenport in 1845 led to his turning state's evidence against his co-conspirators. Birch was also the discoverer of the Pinos Altos gold mine with Jacob Snively and James W. Hicks. During the American Civil War, he served in the American Southwest with the Confederate forces of the Arizona Rangers and 2nd Texas Cavalry. Early life Robert Birch claimed to have been born in New York, but amateur detective, Edward Bonney alleged, that Birch's father, John \\"Old Coon\\" Birch, Sr., stated, in their home, which was nine miles southwest of Marshall, in Clark County, Illinois, that Robert had been born in North Carolina. Birch had moved with his father and his two brothers, John, Jr. and Timothy, to Illinois, as a child. Criminal pursuits in Middle West Banditti of the Prairie Robert Birch became involved in crime, as a teenager, being described by Bonney, as \\"suspected of robbery and even of murder ever since he had attained the age of fifteen\\". Robert Birch was a close associate of bandit, William Fox, as both were considered notorious \\"prairie pirates\\" and longtime members of what were called the Banditti of the Prairie. Birch was a self-styled Mormon, who conveniently, used his church membership, as a Latter Day Saint, to gain protection in Nauvoo, Illinois, when the law was hot on his trail. southern criminal gang leader John A. Murrell from the only known, accurate portrait made of him during his lifetime. Robert Birch was said to have had criminal connections with Murrell but this is highly improbable since he would have been only a seven-year-old child or possibly Birch's criminal father was associated with John A. Murrell. Robert Birch accompanied Jacob Snively in 1858 in helping found Arizona's first gold rush boom town Gila City in which Birch became the first postmaster. He would later join Snively and James W. Hicks in discovering gold deposits on Bear Creek. The ghost town Pinos Altos was first named Birchville in his honor. In the beginning of the American Civil War, Robert Birch enlisted in the Confederate Army in the Rebel-held, southern half of the Union New Mexico Territory, known as the Confederate Territory of Arizona with Company A, Arizona Rangers. The Rangers would later occupy Tucson in February 1862, raising the national flag of the Confederate States of America. Robert Birch later transferred and served under Colonel John Salmon Ford in the Texas 2nd Cavalry of the Confederate Army on the Rio Grande Alleged criminal connections with John A. Murrell Robert Birch, may have had ties to Tennessee outlaw, John A. Murrell and his Mystic Clan, using a number of criminal aliases including; Robert Harris, R. Harris, R. Haris, Haris, Owin, Haines, Gains, Thomas Brown, Tom Brown, Robert Blecher, R. H. Blecher. But, this claim does not hold up to scrutiny, as Birch would have been only seven years old, in 1834, when Murrell was arrested and began serving his ten-year prison sentence. Robert Birch, more likely, might have had older relatives, such as his father, uncles, or cousins, who were on the Mystic Clan's membership rolls in the U.S. Southern states or were connected to outlaws who were Murrell associates. After the demise of Murrell, many of the members of the future \\"Banditti\\" were driven out of \\"The South\\" and to avoid arrest, execution, or death at the hands of regulators and moved farther north, relocating their criminal activities in the still, lawless, frontier of the Middle West, mainly in the states of Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio.

Birch was soon apprehended, in part to information from Bonney, and he soon agreed to testify against the others in exchange for a reduced sentence. Granville Young and brothers, John and Aaron Long were later, executed for the murder. After several court delays, Robert Birch broke out of jail, through outside help or bribery, in Knoxville, Illinois, March 22, 1847. Honest pursuits in New Mexico Territory New Mexico Gold Rush Disappearing into the frontier, of the Midwest United States, Robert Birch resurfaced, almost, a decade later, a reformed, honest man and an associate of Jacob Snively, the founder of Arizona's first gold rush boom town Gila City, and became the first postmaster on December 24, 1858. Two years later, Birch followed Snively and James W. Hicks to the New Mexico Territory where they discovered gold deposits on Bear Creek. A mining camp soon sprang up around the claim, on the site of what is today the ghost town of Pinos Altos, and was originally named Birchville in his honor. American Civil War service When the Confederate Army invaded the territory of New Mexico, at the start of the American Civil War, they created the Confederate Territory of Arizona Robert Birch possibly because of his southern family leanings volunteered for military service. He initially served with Company A, Arizona Rangers under 2nd Lieutenant James Henry Tevis however, according to Tevis, Birch asked to be transferred to Colonel John Salmon Ford's Second Texas Cavalry on the Rio Grande. Death Robert Birch died in 1866, in Arizona Territory, present-day Arizona. References *Bonney, Edward. The Banditti of the Prairies, Or, The Murderer's Doom!!: A Tale of the Mississippi Valley.

Etymology There is a fairy story about a witch called Meg who is supposed to have been involved in the naming of the village. Meg had servants who were elves and she was cruel to them. One day she went to the burn inbetween Elphinstone and Ormiston and ate in her carriage, telling her servants not to disturb her. One elf broke into her carriage once she had fell asleep and stole some of her leftovers. Meg, however, awoke and caught him. She took him back to Elphinstone and trapped him in her stone or \\"Meg's chuck\\". Hence the name Elph (elf) in stone. Other theories about the origin of the name are from the Anglo Saxon elfenne added to \\"stone\\", a reference to hard flint-like stones which were supposed to be used as shot by elves and fairies and which are found on the land around the village. A more prosaic origin is in the Gallo-Latin personal name Alphinus. The earliest mention of the village was in a deed drawn up by Alams de Swinton around 1235 which mentions \\"homines (serfs) of Elfinstun\\". It may be worth noting that Elffin was a relatively common name in the Brythonic Hen Ogledd, with three separate people of that name appearing in the genealogies: Elfin son of Urien, Elffin son of Owain and Elffin son of Gwyddno, the last of which also appearing as Taliesin's foster father in the mythological stories of his life. History The Protestant reformer George Wishart was brought to Elphinstone by Patrick Hepburn, 3rd Earl of Bothwell en route to St Andrews where he was tried and burned at the stake on 1 March 1546. Between 2011 and 2018 the population of the village increased from 520 to 590 and it has basic amenities, including a primary school, a community centre, a newsagent, and a miners welfare club. Landmarks and economy The remains of Elphinstone Tower Located half a mile west of the village, Elphinstone Tower, built in the 13th to 15th century, is a former five-storey tower, now a ruin, with only the lower level remaining. The Elphinstone clan held the lands of Elphinstone and took their name from their lands. Mines owned by the Edinburgh Colliery Company, Limited were formerly the main employer in the village. Many of the houses in the village were owned by the company. now Inveresk Research International is one of the main employers in the area. Elphinstone Tower Farm produces cereal crops.

Built in 1908 for Talifero Simpson Hamilton's growing Bellingham Bay (B.B.) Furniture Company established in 1889, the building cost $100,000 and used thirty-five thousand barrels of cement along with 200,000 pounds of steel. Due to its triangular shape and resemblance to the Fuller Building in New York, the building instantly garnered the flatiron nickname. It was Bellingham's tallest structure until 1926. Construction Bellingham Bay Furniture BuildingIn late 1906, the Bellingham Bay Improvement Company hired architect James C. Teague to draw preliminary plans for a five-story building that would fill their triangular block bound by Champion, Prospect and Bay Streets in downtown Bellingham, a very prime location. It would be a concrete frame building clad in brick with stone at the base. In the original plans, the building would house possibly a bank or other small stores with office space and lodge rooms above but because of litigation involving the property and the construction of a temporary skating rink on the site, it was speculated that the building would not be built very soon.\\"Plans Received for New Flatiron Structure\\" Bellingham Herald - 24 Nov, 1906 In April 1907, the Bellingham Herald announced that the Bellingham Bay Furniture Company, owned by T.S. Hamilton, had purchased the block for $15,000 cash and were rushing plans for the construction of the city's first skyscraper. Soon after the purchase, they dropped Teague's design in favor of one drawn by Frank C. Burns. These plans were for a largely unadorned seven-story building of all reinforced concrete crowned with false chimneys and a large wooden cornice (now gone). To maximize floor space, large pivoting windows would cover all sides of the building, eliminating the need for a lightwell in the middle of the building. Two elevators, one for passengers and one for freight were included in the plans. Despite the buildings' size, it would actually only be larger than the company's previous quarters at Holly and Bay Streets.\\"Furniture Company Buys: Secures site at corner of Champion and Prospect Streets for $15,000 from Bellingham Bay Improvement Company, on which to erect new building\\" Bellingham Herald - 04 April, 1907 Bids were let for the Flatiron building, at the time known as the Hamilton Block, in June 1907. Booker & Campbell won the bid for general construction while Baumaster would handle woodworking. The contract specified that the first six stories were to be completed by January 1, 1908 with a seventh floor to be added later. The structure of the building was to be built sturdy enough to support another four floors if ever needed.\\"Contract Let for Flatiron Building\\" Bellingham Herald - 24 July 1907 Construction was almost brought to a halt by the Panic of 1907, which caused the delay of many construction projects in Bellingham and pushed construction of the building past the January 1st deadline. Contractors rushed to finish the building, canceling plans for any additional floors. The building formally opened to the public in May 1908.\\"The Key Looking Contest during the Opening Week at the B. B. Furniture Co's New Store Was a Decided Success\\" Bellingham Herald - 27 May 1908 Fire On the evening of April 28, 1924, a large fire broke out on the top floor and vented through the roof. However, due to the building's design of concrete and reinforced steel, the structure remained intact. Since 90% of the damage was covered by insurance, reconstruction of the building began shortly afterwards. During reconstruction, Hamilton operated the furniture store across the street, partially under a circus tent. The rebuilding took three years and as a precaution to future fire, an automatic sprinkler system with a rooftop tank was installed, the first of its kind in Bellingham. Another precautionary measure against fire was the relocating of the passenger elevator, the original fire's outlet, to a wall against the freight elevator so it could be contained easier. Another major change after the fire was that the second floor mezzanine was rebuilt as a full second story. When the building reopened, it had become seven stories tall without adding to its overall height.Sullivan, Michael;Kales, Jackie;Molberg, Diane \\"National Register Nomination form for the Flatiron Building \\" National Park Service - 12 July 1983 Current The Bellingham Bay Furniture Company, later known as Van's BB Furniture, occupied the building until closing in 1979.

Its political direction was conservative and ultramontanist, and its purpose to form a bridge between Catholics and the political classes. Other societies under this name were subsequently set up, in German-speaking countries. The Piusverein in Germany It was founded at Mainz in 1848 by the cathedral canon, Adam Franz Lennig, and Professor Caspar Riffel (died 1856), to organize the Catholics of Germany in defence of their religious freedom and civil rights. The platform and by-laws were published in the Katholik (Mainz, 1848). The organizers of the association called a congress of the Catholic societies of Germany which met at Mainz, 3‚Äì6 October 1848. At this assembly 38 societies were represented, and all the Catholic associations of Germany founded to protect religious interests were united into the \\"Catholic Association of Germany\\". The annual congresses of this association led to other organizations; in 1848 the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and the Association of St. Elizabeth; in 1849 the Association of St. Boniface; in 1850 the Society for Christian Art; in 1851 the Catholic Journeymen's Union; these assemblies were the precursors of the \\"General Congress of the Catholics of Germany\\" that was held annually. Academic Pius Associations in Germany, for promoting religious interests and attachment to the Church among Catholic students, were greatly weakened by the Kulturkampf. The Pius Association of Switzerland This was founded in 1855 by Count Theodore Scherer-Boccard who remained at its head until his death (died 1885). Its aim was to develop and centralize Catholic associational life in Switzerland. It was directed by two central committees, and the general meetings were held nearly every year; in addition, there are also cantonal and district assemblies. Many of the local associations had branches for women. From 1899 the society was called the \\"Swiss Catholic Association\\"; it then contained 225 groups with 35,000 members. On 22 November 1904, it combined with the \\"United Societies of Catholic Men and Workingmen\\" and the \\"F√©d√©ration Romande\\" to form the \\"Swiss Catholic Peoples Union\\".See the \\"Yearbook\\" of the Union, Stans, 1907. The Pius Association for Promoting the Catholic Press of Austria Named after Pope Pius X, it was founded at the Fifth Catholic Congress held at Vienna in 1905 after the presentation by the Jesuit, Father Victor Kolb, in order to offset liberal daily press. This end was to be gained largely by developing the Catholic daily newspapers of Vienna. The president of the association from its founding was Count Franz Walterskirchen-Walfstal. It supported two daily newspapers of Vienna, the Reichspost and the Vaterland.

The scientific culture of second scholasticism surpassed its medieval source (Scholasticism) in the number of its proponents, the breadth of its scope, the analytical complexity, sense of historical and literary criticism, and the volume of editorial production, most of which remains hitherto little explored. Scotism and Thomism Unlike the \\"First\\", i.e. medieval scholasticism, a typical feature of second scholasticism was the development of schools of thought, developing the intellectual heritage of their \\"teacher\\". Two schools survived from earlier phases of scholasticism, Scotism and Thomism. The Scotists, mostly belonging to the various branches of the Franciscan order, include the Italians Antonius Trombetta, Bartolomeo Mastri, Bonaventura Belluto; the Frenchman Claude Frassen, the Irish emigrants Luke Wadding, John Punch, and Hugh Caughwell; and the Germans Bernhard Sannig and Crescentius Krisper. The Thomists were usually but not exclusively represented by the Iberians in the Dominican and the Carmelite orders. They include Thomas Cajetan ( or Caietanus), Domingo de Soto, Domingo B√°√±ez, Franciscus Ferrariensis, the Complutenses, Jo√£o Poinsot and others. Jesuit scholasticism The intellectual influence of second scholasticism was augmented by the establishment of the Society of Jesus (1540), by Ignatius Loyola, per approval of Pope Paul III. The \\"Jesuits\\" are considered a third \\"school\\" of second scholasticism, although this refers more to the common style of academic work rather than to some common doctrine. The important figures include Pedro da Fonseca, Antonio Rubio, the Conimbricenses, Robert Bellarmine, Francisco Su√°rez, Luis de Molina, Gabriel V√°squez, Pedro Hurtado de Mendoza, Rodrigo Arriaga, and many others. There were also many \\"independent\\" thinkers like Sebastian Izquierdo, Juan Caramuel y Lobkowicz, Kenelm Digby, Raffael Aversa etc. Decline and legacy The golden age of Second Scholasticism was the first decades of the 17th century, at which time it was still largely in control of university curricula in philosophy.R. Ariew and D. Gabbay, \\"The scholastic background\\", in Cambridge History of Seventeenth Century Philosophy, ed. D. Garber and M. Ayers (Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1998), ch. 15. But second scholasticism started to decline under the attacks of philosophers writing in vernacular languages, such as Descartes, Pascal and Locke, and from the competition from more experimental and mathematical ways of doing science promoted by the Scientific Revolution. It was largely dormant from the onset of Enlightenment in the end of the 17th century, although scholastics such as Suarez remained influential for a long period. In some Iberian universities the scholastic culture remained vivid well into the 19th century, providing background for the birth of Neo-Scholasticism. Interest in the thought of the late scholastics has been recently revived by the journal Studia Neoaristotelica.

It has applications in various fields of science, including topological fluid dynamics, structural complexity analysis and DNA biology (Kauffman 1991, Ricca 1998). Information Traditional knot theory models a knot as a simple closed loop in three-dimensional space. Such a knot has no thickness or physical properties such as tension or friction.

Theodor Scherer-Boccard, 1874 Life Scherer belonged to a distinguished family of Solothurn. He attended the gymnasium there, took the philosophical course at the lyceum, and then studied law at the Athen√§um conducted by the Jesuits at Fribourg. After this Scherer returned to Solothurn and devoted himself to journalism, founding the newspaper Die Schildwache am Jura (1836‚Äì41), in which he defended the Catholic Church and the rights of the people. In addition to this he established in 1839 a bureau of correspondence with conservative tendencies. From 1838 Scherer was also a member of the great council of the canton. His political activity in this body brought him into conflict with the Government and obliged him in 1841 to live abroad for some time in Alsace and Paris. At the close of 1841 he was called to Lucerne where he founded and edited the Staatszeitung der katholischen Schweiz, which became the chief organ of the Catholic-Conservative party. In 1843 Scherer returned to Solothurn and served out a term of imprisonment to which he had been condemned on account of the events of 1841. In 1845 he was made secretary to Magistrate Constantin Siegwart-M√ºller of Lucerne, who was the president of the Sonderbund. Scherer himself had a share also in the founding of the Sonderbund. After the Sonderbund War he returned to private life at Solothurn, where he devoted himself to labors on behalf of Catholic interests and of social subjects. He did much journalistic work, being a contributor to numerous Catholic journals of Switzerland and Germany. During a visit to Rome in 1852 he was made a Roman count by Pope Pius IX. From 1855 Scherer lived in the small castle of H√ºnenberg in Ebikon near Lucerne. In 1868 he married Marie Louise von Boccard, and after that used the double name Scherer-Boccard. In 1844 Scherer founded the Academy of St. Charles Borromeo, an association of the Catholic scholars of Switzerland, and edited as the organ of the association a journal called \\"Katholische Annalen\\" (Lucerne, 1847); the war of the \\"Sonderbund\\" put an end to this periodical and to the academy also. In 1857 he was one of the founders of the Swiss Pius Association (Piusverein), and from the time the society was established until his death he was the president of the central organization; he was also the head of the Society for Home Missions, founded in 1863. He was in touch with the Catholics of Germany and spoke repeatedly at the German-Catholic congresses. Works Scherer- Boccard issued 35 separate publications, containing apologetic, biographical, or historical matter. They included: *\\"Revolution und Restauration der Staatswissenschaft\\" (Augsburg and Lucerne, 1842, 2nd ed., 1845); *\\"Die f√ºnfzehnjahrige Fehde der Revolution gegen die katholische Schweiz 1830-45\\" (Lucerne, 1846); *\\"Das Verh√§ltniss zwischen Kirche und Staat\\" (Ratisbon, 1846, 2nd ed., 1854); *\\"Die Reformbewegung unserer Zeit und das Christenthum\\" (Augsburg, 1848); *\\"Der heilige Vater.

Synopsis Tess McGill is a spunky, independent secretary who has suddenly become a junior executive after she charms company owner A.J. Trask. Tess' first challenge is to survive working with her antagonistic, uptight immediate boss, Mrs. Bryn Newhouse, otherwise known as the \\"company witch.\\" Tess's best friend, Lana Peters, is a secretary who is more interested in doing her nails and rooting for Tess than in getting ahead herself. Meanwhile, Everett Rutledge is a fellow junior executive who is charming but eager to please.

Back home each night on Staten Island, Tess has to contend with her doting parents, Joe and Fran. Tess also has to contend with Sal Pascarella, the blue-collar neighborhood Romeo who constantly pursues her.

Its object was the intellectual, moral, and physical advancement of Catholic youth. History The association was organized on February 22 1875, at a meeting held in Newark, New Jersey, at the call of Very Rev. George H. Doane, who became its first president. It included about one hundred organizations, extending as far west as Mankato, Minnesota. Its aims included the establishment and promotion of Catholic young men's associations, libraries, reading-rooms, and gymnasiums; and the maintenance and conduct of an athletic league. Initially, delegates met for an annual congress. In 1878 the National Union inaugurated a successful movement for obtaining appointments of a greater number of Catholic chaplains to the army and navy. The Catholic Summer School was an outgrowth of National Union plans. Warren E. Mosher, the secretary of the National Union at the time, was the founder of the Summer School. At the convention of 1906, held in New York City, a committee was appointed to prepare a plan of re- organization, then adopted at the convention of 1907 held at Elizabeth, New Jersey. Under the original organization it had been required that the president and first vice-president should be clergymen; this was now changed, the various departments of the Union were organized on a business basis, the athletic work was systematized by establishing the Catholic Amateur Athletic League, a branch of the National Union with complete control over all athletic affairs.

Story Taking place in the year 2027, Earth is suddenly attacked by the planetoid space fortress Zektron. Many cities are decimated and occupied by the Zektron forces, threatening to annihilate humanity. An underground military squadron and lab develops a small mecha called Dion (Imperium in the US version) aboard the mothership Leinoa, a mecha capable of harnessing great firepower. The human's goal is to send Dion/Imperium into Zektron and destroy it only after the Earth occupation forces have been eliminated. Gameplay Imperium differs from most shooters in many ways. There is no high score counter, but instead an experience points counter is displayed. Players earn experience points by destroying multitudes of enemies and the numbers differ depending on the size of the enemy. Players then earn additional weapons and power-ups for each weapon through a set number of experience points. The player has a five-hit life bar. If a player takes a hit, then whatever weapon they were using when they were hit is down graded by one point. Players can replenish health and any downgraded weapon by earning back experience points. The player also has speed-change control, which they can use to change the speed of their mech to five different levels. The player has no lives. If the player dies, then it's Game Over. However, they can start on the level they died on by using the Continue option that shows up on the main menu after dying. The player can only use the continue option four times. Development In its September 1992 issue, Electronic Gaming Monthly estimated that Imperium was 80% complete and on track for November. Region differences Although the game played out the same and featured similar music and sounds, the Western version does have different content from the Japanese version : *Mobile Armoured Dion featured large level design detail with different backgrounds layered over each other, particularly in level 2 where large construction beams forming squares span over the beach and ocean background and a different colour palette (orange).

History Rev. Henry Ganss Rev. Henry Ganss of Lancaster, Pennsylvania founded the League in New York City, in May 1904, and two months later, it received a Papal blessing from Pius X. Ganss was a fundraiser for the ‚Äò‚ÄôPreservation Society‚Äô‚Äô of the Bureau of Catholic Indian Missions, and he founded the League as a fundraising auxiliary of the Preservation Society. However, the Preservation Society ceased in 1922 while the League continued to thrive. In collaboration with the Bureau, the League distributed the funds and in-kind donations it raised for missions, mission schools and students. It built new missions and satellite chapels and maintained them with supplies; it trained and maintained catechists; and it provided scholarships to students and clothing to the needy. The League had a lay directorate of 25 members, chosen at first from among local councils of the St. Vincent de Paul Society. To further its work, it established branch organizations in several northeastern U.S. cities, including Baltimore and Washington, D.C. It charged an annual membership fee of $2.00 and published ‚Äô‚ÄôThe Calumet‚Äô‚Äô as a fundraising newsletter from 1913 to 1958. Notable members included Rev. John J. Wynne, S.J., Eugene A.

During its first six years (to 1910), aid from the League provided for the establishment of mission chapels in several states. They included Arizona among the Hopi people; South Dakota on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation and the Rosebud Indian Reservation among the Oglala and Brul√© Lakota people respectively; Nebraska on the Winnebago Indian Reservation among the Winnebago people; and North Dakota on the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation among the Mandan, Hidatsa, and Arikara Nation.

While dying, Martian Manhunter telepathically attacked the super villains present with visions of their deaths by their arch-rivals with Vandal Savage imagining being killed by Manhunter himself. However, the Human Flame is ignored and cowers from the side.Final Crisis #1 (July 2008) The Human Flame is given a new upgraded suit by Libra. The helmet Libra shoves onto Human Flame's head emits the Anti-Life Equation turning Human Flame into a mindless drone known as a Justifier. Libra even used the Human Flame amongst other Justifiers to persuade Lex Luthor to swear an allegiance to Darkseid or be turned into a Justifier.Final Crisis #3 (September 2008) The Human Flame was among the Justifiers under Lex Luthor's control that were fighting the Female Furies.Final Crisis #7 (March 2009) In the limited series Final Crisis Aftermath: Run!, it is revealed that the Human Flame had a wife and child, but was divorced. The Human Flame tries to hide while pursued by the Kyrgyzstani Mafia for stealing a cache of money, the villains that Libra enslaved during the Final Crisis, and the Justice League members John Stewart and Firestorm.Final Crisis Aftermath: Run! #1 (May 2009) His costume is badly damaged during a fight with the mob, and the Human Flame seeks out Heat Wave, hoping to purchase one of the latter's signature flamethrower guns. Heat Wave refuses, denouncing him as \\"pathetic\\", and gives him a harsh beating. Wounded and unable to afford health care, the Human Flame turns to General Immortus who turns him over to Professor Milo. Milo fixes his injuries, and adds cybernetic parts, adding strength and invulnerability, and implanted flamethrowers in his chest, mouth and arms. However, to ensure the Human Flame's loyalty, Immortus has his flamethrowers rigged to cause intense pain whenever he uses them, and orders him to kill Immortus' foe, N-Emy (whom General Immortus blamed for stealing something from him).Final Crisis Aftermath: Run! #2 (June 2009) The Human Flame later attempts some freelance jobs, stealing from a bank with the help of Seductress (one of the augmented henchmen and lover of Immortus himself) and swaying her to his side, but he's quickly discovered and charged with treason by Milo and Immortus, who try to shut down his powers with a remote control. With Seductress rushing again to his aid, the Human Flame is able to escape destroying the remote but injuring himself in the process.Final Crisis Aftermath: Run! #3 (July 2009) Human Flame discovers that his new cyborg body has uncanny recuperative abilities that fix the broken jaw suffered during his escape. He fights his former allies successfully, killing them all until Immortus shuts down his powers with a secondary, wireless remote. The Human Flame then regains his powers by sheer will (even the augmented powers), badly burning Immortus. He then tortures Professor Milo to get further augmentations to put him on par with the Justice League and everyone else wanting vengeance against him. Milo sends him to S.T.A.R. Labs to get himself infused with atomic energy in a new experimental process. There, Human Flame and Seductress are attacked by a Hyper- Griffin,Final Crisis Aftermath: Run! #4 (August 2009) thus alerting S.T.A.R.'s security (actually one lone scientist) who agrees to give Human Flame the energy infusion to dispatch the Hyper-Griffin, although the energy infusion is temporary unless Human Flame can reach a nearby nuclear power plant and bathe in its energies, even though he risks death and a deadly meltdown. Despite the risks, he leaves Seductress behind and dupes John Stewart into dunking him in the main reactor. As a result, the nuclear plant is engulfed in a fiery explosion.Final Crisis Aftermath: Run! #5 (September 2009) Despite the magnitude of the explosion, so powerful that the assembled heroes barely manage to contain it with their maximum efforts, Flame emerges as a fiery, radioactive being, in a molten approximation of a human body, able to increase his mass and density. Calling himself the Inhuman Flame, he rampages through the city until he increases his mass to such a degree that he becomes basically immobile. Realizing that the Flame, in his quest for power, hadn't even taken into account the idea of becoming \\"smaller\\", Firestorm, Red Tornado, and John Stewart take him to outer space, tethered to heat-dispersing rod to sap his thermic-based powers. As a final revenge, and to add insult to injury, Stewart creates a cell-phone construct and takes a photo of the captive Human Flame, stressing the similarities to Martian Manhunter's fate.Final Crisis Aftermath: Run! #6 (October 2009) Powers and abilities When he first appears, Human Flame has no powers, but wears a costume with twelve flame throwing nozzles on the chest. As a part of the Run series, he is shown being turned into a cyborg with an enhanced physique, partial body armor and a series of flame-spewing nozzles implanted in his chest, belly, face, mouth and hands. He further enhances his body by an experimental radioactive infusion process: as a result he gains a metahuman body composed of molten material, able to increase his mass and density at will and radiate high temperature radiations. In this new form he's shown to be unable, whether due to a physical limitation or simply because he is incapable of thinking that way, to reduce his increased mass, becoming in a short while a behemoth so heavy and dense that he loses the ability to move. Throughout his attempt to escape the heroes hunting him, he was represented as an incompetent crook who gets lucky because nobody expects anything of him, allowing him to evade capture as they cannot predict his methods, although his fixation on acquiring more power and anger at his own view of life's mistreatment of him eventually allow the heroes to catch up with him.

It was governed by Deshastha Brahmins, who were feudatories of Kolhapur State. Shahu of Kolhapur attempted to undermine the Brahmin princelings of Vishalgad jagir, as also those of Bavda and Ichalkaranji, from around 1895. He had inherited the throne of Kolhapur in 1894 placed blame for the past weak government of his state on Brahmins, including those in its civil service, and claimed that there was justification for discriminating against them in order to improve the lot of his less privileged subjects. Aside from introducing policies of job reservation and education for the underprivileged in his state, he asked the British Raj provincial authorities of Bombay Presidency to allow a reduction in the privileges enjoyed by the feudatory chiefs, whom he claimed had been harbouring Brahmin terrorists from Poona. Historian Gordon Johnson says that \\"The case, although plausible, was not entirely convincing, and the matter dragged on into the 1920s\\". Fort A fort had existed at Vishalgad long before it became a jagir. The Maratha emperor Shivaji had escaped to it after being besieged at Panhala Fort in 1660 and in 1844 it was one of the forts of Kolhapur State that initiated a rebellion against a Brahmin regent called Daji Krishna Pandit who had been installed by the British to govern the state in 1843 at a time when the natural heir to the throne was underage. He took direction from a political agent of the East India Company and among their actions were reforms to the tax of land. These reforms caused much resentment and, despite Kolhapur having refrained from involvement in the previous Anglo-Maratha Wars, a revolt against the British began in 1844. The rebellion began with soldiers locking themselves into hill- forts such as those as Panhala and Vishalgad, and then spread to Kolhapur itself.

The HIPPS will shut off the source of the high pressure before the design pressure of the system is exceeded, thus preventing loss of containment through rupture (explosion) of a line or vessel. Therefore, a HIPPS is considered as a barrier between a high-pressure and a low-pressure section of an installation. Traditional systems In traditional systems over-pressure is dealt with through relief systems. A relief system will open an alternative outlet for the fluids in the system once a set pressure is exceeded, to avoid further build-up of pressure in the protected system. This alternative outlet generally leads to a flare or venting system to safely dispose the excess fluids. A relief system aims at removing any excess inflow of fluids for safe disposal, where a HIPPS aims at stopping the inflow of excess fluids and containing them in the system. Conventional relief systems have disadvantages such as release of (flammable and toxic) process fluids or their combustion products in the environment and often a large footprint of the installation. With increasing environmental awareness, relief systems are not always an acceptable solution. However, because of their simplicity, relatively low cost and wide availability, conventional relief systems are still often applied. Advantages of HIPPS HIPPS provides a solution to protect equipment in cases where: *high-pressures and / or flow rates are processed *the environment is to be protected *the economic viability of a development needs improvement *the risk profile of the plant must be reduced HIPPS is an instrumented safety system that is designed and built in accordance with the IEC 61508 and IEC 61511 standards. The international standards IEC 61508 and 61511 refer to safety functions and Safety Instrumented Systems (SIS) when discussing a device to protect equipment, personnel and environment. Older standards use terms like safety shut-down systems, emergency shut-down systems or last layers of defence. Components of HIPPS A system that closes the source of over-pressure within a specified time with at least the same reliability as a safety relief valve is usually called a HIPPS. Such a HIPPS is a complete functional loop consisting of: *sensors, (or initiators) that detect the high pressure *a logic solver, which processes the input from the sensors to an output to the final element *final elements, that actually perform the corrective action in the field by bringing the process to a safe state. In case of a HIPPS this means shutting off the source of overpressure. The final element consists of a valve, actuator and solenoids. Diagram Example of a HIPPS system The scheme above presents three pressure transmitters (PT) connected to a logic solver. The solver will decide based on 2-out-of-3 (2oo3) voting whether or not to activate the final element. the 1oo2 solenoid panel decides which valve to be closed. The final elements consist here of two block valves that stop flow to the downstream facilities (right) to prevent them from exceeding a maximum pressure. The operator of the plant is warned through a pressure alarm (PA) that the HIPPS was activated. This system has a high degree of redundancy: *failure of one of the three pressure transmitters will not compromise the HIPPS functionality, as two readings of high pressure are needed for activation. *failure of one of the two block valves will not compromise the HIPPS functionality, as the other valve will close on activation of the HIPPS. One must not confine self to the above design as the only means of materializing the HIPPS definition. One must always think of the HIPPS generically, as a means of isolating a source of a high pressure when down stream flow have been blocked, isolating the upstream equipment (source of the high pressure) in a highly reliable manner. Be this source of the high pressure a pump (in case of liquid) or a gas compressor (in case of gas), the aim of the HIPPS in these cases is to reliably shut down the pump or the gas compressor creating the high pressure condition in a reliable and safe manner. Standards and design practices The ever-increasing flow rates in combination with the environmental constraints initiated the widespread and rapid acceptance in the last decades of HIPPS as the ultimate protection system. The International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) has introduced the IEC 61508 and the IEC 61511 standards in 1998 and 2003. These are performance based, non-prescriptive, standards which provide a detailed framework and a life-cycle approach for the design, implementation and management of safety systems applicable to a variety of sectors with different levels of risk definition. These standards also apply to HIPPS. The IEC 61508 mainly focuses on electrical/electronic/programmable safety-related systems. However it also provides a framework for safety-related systems based on other technologies including mechanical systems. The IEC 61511 is added by the IEC specifically for designers, integrators and users of safety instrumented systems and covers the other parts of the safety loop (sensors and final elements) in more detail. The basis for the design of your safety instrumented system is the required Safety Integrity Level (SIL). The SIL is obtained during the risk analysis of a plant or process and represents the required risk reduction. The SIS shall meet the requirements of the applicable SIL which ranges from 1 to 4. The IEC standards define the requirements for each SIL for the lifecycle of the equipment, including design and maintenance. The SIL also defines a required probability of failure on demand (PFD) for the complete loop and architectural constraints for the loop and its different elements. The requirements of the HIPPS should not be simplified to a PFD level only, the qualitative requirements and architectural constraints form an integral part of the requirements to an instrumented protection system such as HIPPS. The European standard EN12186 (formerly the DIN G491) and more specific the EN14382 (formerly DIN 3381) has been used for the past decades in (mechanically) instrumented overpressure protection systems. These standards prescribe the requirements for the over-pressure protection systems, and their components, in gas plants. Not only the response time and accuracy of the loop but also safety factors for over-sizing of the actuator of the final element are dictated by these standards. Independent design verification and testing to prove compliance to the EN14382 standard is mandatory. Therefore the users often refer to this standard for HIPPS design.

He was born at Athelstaneford near Haddington. Life Archibald was born in Athelstaneford near Haddington the son of Adam Skirving. His younger brother Robert joined the army in later life. All three (father and sons) wrote poetry, but it is Adam who is best remembered as a songwriter. Skirving's chalk drawing of Robert Burns was based on Alexander Nasmyth's famous portrait. After studying both in Rome and London, he settled in Edinburgh, where he obtained some fame as a portrait-painter. His most successful portraits were executed in crayon. The best known work is his pastel portrait of Robert Burns, executed partly from Nasmyth's famous portrait, and partly from Skirving's recollection of the poet, whom he met, it is said, at Edinburgh in 1786. This portrait was acquired by Sir Theodore Martin and is in the National Burns Collection. Other of Skirving's sitters were Alexander Carlyle, D.D., of Inveresk, the mother of Jane Welsh Carlyle, Gavin Hamilton, Isabella Fraser-Tytler, Professor Dugald Stewart, Elizabeth Liddell, and Dr. John Hunter, principal of St. Andrews University. Skirving was eccentric, and did not pursue his art industriously. In later life he seldom produced more than one picture a year, his price being about one hundred guineas. He died suddenly at Inveresk Lodge, Inveresk, East Lothian in 1819, and was buried at Athelstaneford churchyard. Some of his portraits are in the Scottish National Portrait Gallery, Edinburgh. Legacy Skirving's portraits including one of his father and a self-portrait are in the National Galleries of Scotland. The sculptor John Henning named one of his sons Archibald Skirving Henning in 1805, in Skirving's honour.Obituary, The Gentleman's Magazine, 1864, retrieved 12 July 2014 He became an artist and he has a few paintings in public collections in the United Kingdom.

King, starring Steven Seagal, Mike Dopud, Igor Jijikine and Robert Wisden. The film was released on direct-to-DVD in the United States on May 19, 2009. Plot Ruslan Drachev (Steven Seagal) is a former Russian diplomat and a current writer of hardboiled pulp fiction novels living in St. Petersburg when he gets a call from his ex-wife Catherine (Inna Korobkina) that his daughter Lanie (Laura Mennell) is getting married. Not wanting to miss the wedding, Ruslan catches the red eye to New Jersey and heads into Trenton to see Lanie, who is an attorney in the D.A.'s office in Trenton. Ruslan is somewhat concerned that Lanie is marrying Stephan Abramov (Dmitry Chepovetsky), the son of Mikhail Abramov (Igor Jijikine), the brutal boss of the local Russian mob outfit. Later on, Ruslan finds that Catherine is now married to wealthy local defense attorney Terry Goldstein (Robert Wisden). Lanie tells Ruslan that Terry is a jerk. Ruslan pulls Stephen to the side, and Stephen assures Ruslan that he has no interest of joining the family business and just wants to love his new wife and start a new life. After everyone but Catherine and Lanie leaves to go to the church where the wedding will take place, A pair of men break in, stab Catherine to death, and then stab Lanie, leaving her in critical condition. Detective Norden (Ingrid Torrance) and Detective Lavastic (Zak Santiago) are heading the investigation. It was made to look like a robbery, but Ruslan knows full well that it was not a robbery. At East Lawn Hospital, Dr. Brown (Linda Minard) tells Ruslan that she expects Lanie to recover. Ruslan starts his own investigation and learns that Mikhail, who hates Ruslan, was behind the attack. Terry, who is Mikhail\`s attorney, is also in on it. Mikhail despised the thought of Stephan marrying a prosecuting attorney instead of following in Mikhail's footsteps, and Catherine was about to blow the whistle on some of Terry's corrupt activities.

History Inveresk Lodge was built in 1683, and between 1774 and 1911 it was the home of the Wedderburn family. The portrait painter Archibald Skirving died at the Lodge in 1819. John Brunton, a Quaker, bought Inveresk Lodge in 1911. His Brunton Wireworks provided the cable for the Forth Road Bridge. During World War II, Inveresk Lodge's garden was needed to grow vegetables in support of the war effort. In 1958, Mrs Helen Brunton left the house and gardens to the National Trust for Scotland. The Lodge is let by the Trust for private occupation, but visitors can enjoy the terraced garden. Garden The earliest evidence of a garden at Inveresk comes from a 1781 court case to reduce trees overhanging from Inveresk Lodge's Garden to Halkerson's lodge next door.Inveresk Lodge Garden Conservation Management Plan, 2010, NTS garden department archives At the start of the 20th century, four gardeners were employed at Inveresk Lodge.

These have been set both by ecclesiastical authority, and by national governments. Opening of the Vatican archives In the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries the awakening critical investigation of the past led some scholars to resort to the treasures of the papal archives. The most far-reaching and efficient use of the archives for historical purposes began with C√¶sar Baronius. Through his work, and in the several continuations of it by others, the world first learned of the wealth of historical documents contained in the Roman archives, and especially in the archives of the Vatican. The extensive Bullaria, or compilations of papal decrees, general and particular (see Bulls and Briefs), are drawn in part from the archives of the recipients, have only reached their imposing array of volumes because the Vatican furnished abundant material. In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, ecclesiastical historians and the writers of the numerous monographs concerning local churches, monasteries, ecclesiastical institutions, etc. were aided by the officials of the archives, themselves often scholarly investigators. In this respect the papal archivist Augustin Theiner (1804‚Äì74) accomplished far-reaching work when he published, in many folio volumes, a multitude of documents relative to the ecclesiastical and civil history of Northern, Eastern, and Southern Europe, also a documentary treatise in three folio volumes on the temporal dominion of the pope and its administration. In the same period, i.e. from about 1850 to 1875, several other investigators, chiefly German and Austrian, in one way or another secured admittance to the papal archives. These events and other influences increased the desire of all scholars for the opening of this valuable repository of important historical documents. Although under Pope Pius IX it became somewhat easier to obtain a permit for private research, the political conditions of his reign worked against a general opening of the Vatican Archives. \\"We have nothing to fear from the publication of documents\\", exclaimed Pope Leo XIII, when on 20 June 1879, he appointed the ecclesiastical historian, Joseph Hergenr√∂ther, \\"Cardinal Archivist of the Holy Roman Church\\" (Palmieri, \\"Introite ed Esiti di Papa Niccol√≤ III\\", Rome, pp. xiv, xv; Friedensburg, \\"Das kgl. Preussische Historische Institut in Rom\\", Berlin, 1903, passim). He opened to students the archives of the Vatican, more especially what are known as the secret archives, despite strong opposition from several quarters. It took until the beginning of 1881 to arrange all preliminaries, including the preparation of suitable quarters for the work, after which date the barriers were removed which, until then, with a few exceptions, had shut out investigators. The use of these treasures was at length regularized by a papal Decree (regolamento) of 1 May 1884. In the meantime the pope had addressed to the three cardinals, Pitra, De Luca, and Hergenr√∂ther, his letter on historical studies (18 August 1883). Research in the Secret Archives Hitherto very little was known of the contents of this vast treasury; now its great wealth came to be widely appreciated - Briefs, Bulls, petitions, department records, reports of nuncios and other reports, diaries, documentary collections, privileges, legal titles of the most miscellaneous kind, etc. Progress was at first rather slow, for no systematic use of the archives could be planned until the workers had familiarized themselves with the material at hand. The hasty treatment that, in the beginning, the thirteenth century material received, revealed how much there was to learn before the archives could be used to the best advantage. Gradually, order was introduced in all kinds of research work, in which task notable services were rendered by the historical institutes which were established in close relation to the Vatican Archives. Research work in these archives may be divided into individual and collective, or general and special. Individual researches are made by individual scholars, while collective work is conducted by several who have either united for that purpose, or belong permanently to some association. General research devotes itself to the larger outlines of ecclesiastical history, while special research seeks the solution of particular problems, more or less far-reaching in importance. Both methods may be combined, objectively and subjectively; an individual investigator may work at a general theme, while an association may take up the study of a restricted or specific problem, and vice versa. The results of Vatican historical study are to be found in periodicals, essays, and books, also disseminated in large historical collections devoted to other classes of historical material, and containing the results of other investigations, e.g. the \\"Monumenta Germani√¶ Historica\\". A study of the published material exhibits long series of original documents, narratives based on copious documentary material, and occasionally narratives based on information obtained in the archives, but unaccompanied by the documents or by reference to them. Fields of investigation While it is but natural that the study of documents should be chiefly done in the Vatican archives, most investigators also carry on work in the important collection of printed books known as the Vatican Library. In October, 1892, there was opened in connexion with the archives and the Library a consultation library, the \\"Bibliotheca Leoniana\\", in order to facilitate research, historical and Biblical. Governments, academies, libraries, archives, and corporations contributed to it, and it has already reached very large proportions. The archives themselves are so organized that nearly every student of history may discover there something of special importance in his own province. The numerous other archives and manuscript-collections of Rome are also open, as a rule, to the student; indeed, few workers limit themselves exclusively to Vatican materials. Moreover, studies begun in the Vatican are often supplemented by scientific excursions to other Italian cities, either on the student's homeward journey or during some vacation period; such excursions have at times resulted in surprising discoveries. An exhaustive examination of Italian archives and libraries leads occasionally to a larger view of the subject than was originally intended by the investigator, for whom in this way new questions of importance spring up, the definite solution of which becomes highly desirable. Experience, therefore, and the detailed study of the numerous repertories, indexes, and inventories of manuscripts, have made it necessary to organize permanently the scientific historical researches carried on in the interest of any given country. This means a saving of money and of labour; in this way also more substantial achievements can be hoped for than from purely individual research. Consequently, institutes for historical research were soon founded in Rome, somewhat on the plan of the earlier arch√¶ological societies. While the opening of such institutes is a nobile offlcium of any government, private associations have made serious sacrifices in the same direction and sustained with success the institutes they have called into life. The state institutes investigate all that pertains to national relations or intercourse (religion, politics, economics, science, or art) with the Curia, with Rome, or, for that matter, with Italy. Many of these institutes do not attempt to go further, and their field is certainly comprehensive and in itself admirable. Others devote themselves to similar researches, but do not neglect general questions of interest to universal history, profane or ecclesiastical, or to the history of medieval culture. Of course, only the larger institutes, with many workers at their disposal, can satisfactorily undertake problems of this nature. Historical Institutes England At the end of 1876 the Rev. Joseph Stevenson, who was employed by the English Public Record Office to obtain transcripts of documents of historical importance in the Vatican archives, resigned his appointment, and Sir Thomas Hardy, on Cardinal Manning's recommendation, appointed William Henry Bliss as his successor. For years Stevenson and Bliss conducted their researches alone. Later other English investigators were detailed to Rome to co-operate with Bliss and hasten the progress of his work. Bliss died very suddenly of pneumonia; English investigators continued the work, under direction of the Record Office. Five volumes of Calendars of Entries in the Papal Registers relating to Great Britain and Ireland, by Bliss and collaborators, were published. In addition to the medieval material, numerous extracts and transcripts of a political nature were made from sixteenth- and seventeenth-century documents, transmitted to the Record Office and partly used in the Calendars of State Papers. France The Ecole Fran√ßaise de Rome, originally one with that of Athens, employs almost constantly historical investigators at the Grande Archivio of Naples; they devote themselves to the documents of the Angevin dynasty. This institute has an organ of its own, the \\"M√©langes d'arch√©ologie et d'histoire\\", in whose pages are found not only historical studies properly so called, but also papers on the history of arch√¶ology and of art. The institute has its home in the Palazzo Farnese, where its director lives, and where a rich library is housed. It was founded in 1873, and during the reign of Pius IX, long before the opening of the secret archives, inaugurated its great achievement, the editing of the papal Regesta of the thirteenth century. Scholars of international reputation have figured among its directors, including Louis Duchesne. The \\"Biblioth√®que des Ecoles Fran√ßaises d'Ath√®nes et de Rome\\", is made up of lengthy monographs by pupils of the Ecole, treating of divers subjects connected with their studies in the Vatican archives and library. The papal \\"Regesta\\" of the thirteenth century, the \\"Liber Pontificalis\\", and the \\"Liber Censuum\\" (Fabre-Duchesne) form a second series of historical publications to the credit of the French school. A third series is made up of documents selected from the fourteenth- century papal \\"Regesta\\", and is entitled \\"Lettres des papes d'Avignon se rapportant √† la France\\". The slow progress of so many learned enterprises is a matter of general regret, nor can one always approve the methods employed, though no one can deny the very great utility of these scholarly studies and researches for the history of the papacy and its international relations. The chaplains of the French National Institute of St-Louis des Fran√ßais have recently undertaken a work closely related to that of the Ecole Fran√ßaise, the publication in concise regesta-like form of all letters of the Avignon popes. Gratifying progress is being made with the \\"Regesta\\" of John XXII. The review known as the \\"Annales de St-Louis des Fran√ßais\\", whose contributions to ecclesiastical history were noteworthy, has been discontinued. Other works of a learned historical nature have been published by the chaplains of this institute, the results of their diligent researches in the Vatican archives. German Catholic Institutes The chaplains of the German national institute of Santa Maria di Campo Santo Teutonico were among the first to profit by the opening of the secret archives for the conduct of scientific research in the field of German ecclesiastical history. Monsignor de Waal, director of the institute, founded the \\"R√∂mische Quartalschrift f√ºr Arch√§ologie und Kirchengeschichte\\" as a centre for historical research more modest and limited in scope, and it fulfils this purpose in a creditable manner. To the students of history at the Campo Santo is owing the founding, at Rome, of the G√∂rres Society Historical Institute. This institute, established after long hesitation, sufficiently explained by the slender resources of the society, is now a credit to its founders (besides regular reports, begun in 1890, on the work of this institute, and filed in the records of the society, see Cardauns, \\"Die G√∂rres Gesellschaft, 1876-1901\\", Cologne, 1901, pp. 65‚Äì73). In 1900 a new department was added and placed under the guidance of Monsignor Wilpert, for the study of Christian arch√¶ology and the history of Christian art. The Roman labours of the G√∂rres Society Institute deal chiefly with nunciature reports,Cf. Nuntiaturberichte aus Deutschland, nebst erg√§nzenden Aktenst√ºcken: Die K√∂lner Nuntiatur: so far 20 vols., edited on behalf of the Preussisches Historisches Institut (Roma; now Deutsches Historisches Institut), G√∂rres-Gesellschaft zur Pflege der Wissenschaft, and Akademie der Wissenschaften (Vienna), Paderborn et al.: Sch√∂ningh, 1895 to present. the administration records of the Curia since 1300, and the Acts of the Council of Trent. Other publications, more or less broad in scope, are published regularly in the \\"Historisches Jahrbuch\\", among its \\"Quellen und Forschungen\\", or in other organs of the G√∂rres Society. The twelve volumes in which this institute proposes to edit exhaustively the Acts and records of the Council of Trent, represented one of the most difficult tasks which could be set before a body of workers in the Vatican archives. The aforesaid investigation of medieval papal administration and financial records, which the institute investigates in cooperation with the Austrian Leo Society, open up a chief source of information for the history of the Curia in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. The results accomplished by this purely private association surpass greatly those of many governmental institutes. The G√∂rres Society Institute maintains at Rome no library of its own, but aids efficiently in the growth of the fine library at the Campo Santo Teutonico, near the Vatican. The Leo Society supports at Rome a trained investigator, who devotes his time to publications from the papal treasury (Camera), records of the later Middle Ages. The present director of the G√∂rres Society Institute is Prof. Dr. Stefan Heid. Austria The Austrian institute (Instituto Austriaco di studi storici), established by Theodor von Sickel, and then directed by Ludwig von Pastor, was set up in 1883. It cooperated in the publication of the nunciature reports, and contemplates the publication of the correspondence of the legates and the ambassadors at the Council of Trent. Among the publications of this institute are Sickel's study on the \\"Privilegium Ottonianum\\"; his edition of the \\"Liber Diurnus\\"; and his \\"R√∂mische Berichte\\" (Roman reports). Studies by this institute appeared in the \\"Mittheilungen des √∂sterreichischen Institutes f√ºr Geschichtsforschung,\\", dealing with the work of the medieval papal chancery, while Ottenthal's \\"Chancery Rules\\" and Tangl's \\"Chancery Regulations\\" are standard works on the Middle Ages. Numerous historical commissions were sent from Bohemia to Rome (concerning which, see below). Prussia A short history of the founding of the Prussian historical institute was published by Friedensburg (Berlin, Academy of Sciences). The project dated back to 1883, but it was not until May 1888 that Konrad Schottm√ºller succeeded in opening a Prussian Historical Bureau that began modestly enough, but soon developed into the actual Prussian Institute, reorganized (12 November 1902) on a materially enlarged scale, and now the most important of all historical institutes at Rome, owing largely to the efforts of its present director, Professor Kehr. In addition to the general work of historical investigations, special departments are conducted for the history of art and for patristic and Biblical research. Besides its own publication, \\"Quellen und Forschungen aus italienischen Archiven\\" the German Historical Institute in Rome (DHI Rome) today issues a series of German nunciature reports (eleven volumes since 1897). The Library of the Institute, besides extensive monographs on various subjects, has published the useful \\"Repertorium Germanicum\\", and, in co-operation with the Instituto Storico Italiano, the \\"Registrum chartarum Itali√¶\\", a series of independent volumes. These researches take in Italian, German, French, English, and Spanish archives; Austria and Switzerland are likewise visited occasionally. The library of the institute ranks, with that of the Palazzo Farnese, among the best historical libraries in Rome. Hungary The \\"Hungaricorum Historicorum Collegium Romanum\\", no longer in existence, owed its inception in 1892 to the efforts of Monsignor Frakn√≥i, and published under his direction (since 1897) the \\"Monumenta Vaticana historiam regni Hungari√¶ illustrantia\\", whose two series in ten folio volumes are a lasting tribute to the munificence of Frakn√≥i. Other noteworthy monographs based on Roman documents and illustrating the history of Hungary must be credited to this institute. Belgium The \\"Institut historique Belge √† Rome\\" was founded in 1902 and opened in 1904. It is now located in the Academia Belgica. The minister of state defined its purpose to be the searching of Italian archives, and especially those of the Vatican, for historical material bearing on Belgium, and the publication of the results obtained. The project included a centre for individual Belgian investigators as well as for students assisted by the State, where all might find an adequate library and facilities for securing historical data of every kind. The institute, it was hoped, would eventually become an \\"Ecole des hautes √©tudes\\" for the study of ecclesiastical and profane history, classical philology, arch√¶ology, and the history of art. Its first director was Dom Ursmer Berli√®re, of the Abbey of Maredsous (1904‚Äì1907); his successor was Dr Godefroid Kurth, professor emeritus at the University of Li√®ge. The institute has published numerous volumes of \\"Analecta Vaticano- Belgica\\". Netherlands The Netherland institute grew out of various historical commissions, the last of which was established 20 May 1904. Its two representatives, Dr. Brom and Dr. Orbaan, were appointed on 31 March 1906, director and secretary respectively of the state institute founded on this date, and of which they thus became the first members (Brom, \\"Nederlandsche gesehiedvorsching en Rome\\", 1903). This institute aims at a systematic investigation of Holland's ecclesiastical and political relations, and of her artistic, scientific, and economic relations, with Rome and Italy during the fourteenth, fifteenth, and sixteenth centuries, a period of very great importance for Holland. A yearly report of the institute and its library appears at The Hague in \\"Verslagen omtrent's Rikjs onde archieven\\". Besides a number of essays and minor works, there appeared at The Hague, during 1908, a work by Brom, \\"Archivalia in Italie\\"; part I, Rome, \\"Vaticaansch Archief\\". All historical material in Italian archives bearing on the Netherlands will be concisely described in this series of volumes; the first part contains 2650 numbers, and is specially valuable because of the excellent conspectus it offers of the contents of the Vatican archives. A work by Orbaan, on Dutch scholars and artists in Rome, is ready for the press (1910). Other researches The institutes above-mentioned offer a very incomplete idea of the historical work done in the Vatican archives. Many Frenchmen, Germans, Austrians, Belgians, and others flock to Rome and spend much of their time in private investigations of their own. Most of these workers attach themselves to some institute and profit by its experience. Among Americans we may mention Professor Charles Homer Haskins, who familiarized himself with the treasures contained in the archives and library, and made a report on the same for the \\"American Historical Review\\", reprinted in the \\"Catholic University Bulletin\\", Washington, 1897, pp. 177‚Äì196; Rev. P. de Roo, who laboured for several years on the \\"Regesta\\" of Alexander VI; Heywood, who compiled the \\"Documenta selecta e tabulario Sanct√¶ Sedis, insulas et terras anno 1492 repertas a Christophoro Columbo respicientia\\", which he published in phototype in 1892. Other American scholars have profited largely by the immemorial academic hospitality of the popes. Special mention should be made here of the studies of Luka Jelic and Conrad Eubel concerning early missionary enterprises, and of an essay by Shipley on \\"The Colonization of America\\" (Lucerne, 1899). For other valuable information see the tenth volume of the \\"Records of the American Catholic Historical Society of Philadelphia\\". The time would seem to be at hand for the foundation of an American Catholic historical institute, which would take over the task of collecting and publishing in a systematic way the numerous important documents concerning the American Church preserved in many places at Rome, particularly in the Propaganda archives. Russia has sent historical commissions to Rome repeatedly, and for several years at a time. The names of Schmurlow, Br√ºckner, Pierling, Forster, Wiersbowski, and others are sufficient reminders of the excellent work accomplished. From Japan came Dr. Murakami, to explore the Propaganda and Vatican archives for a history of the Catholic missions to Japan (1549‚Äì1690). Denmark is represented among the investigators by such names as Moltesen, Krarup, and Lindback; Norway by Storm, and Sweden by Tegn√©r, Elof, Karlson, and others. Moritz Stern, Felix Vernet, and others obtained at the Vatican material for a history of the Hebrews. The Spanish Government was long officially represented by the famous Spanish historian, Ricardo de Hinojosa, while researches in Portuguese history are conducted by MacSwiney. Switzerland entered into this peaceful competition by the labours of Kirsch and Baumgarten in 1899, and since the close of the last century many Swiss have visited Rome for Vatican researches, both as individuals and on official missions. We need only mention the names of B√ºchi, Wirz, Bernoulli, Steffens, Reinhard, and St√ºckelberg. In addition to these and many more names, we must mention the numerous religious who seek in the archives fresh material for general ecclesiastical history, or the history of their order, e. g. the Benedictines and the Bollandists. The writer has observed at work in the archives during the last twenty-one years Dominicans, Jesuits, Franciscans, Minor Conventuals, Capuchins, Trinitarians, Cistercians, Benedictines, Basilians, Christian Brothers, Lateran Canons Regular, Vallombrosans, Camaldolese, Olivetans, Silvestrines, Carthusians, Augustinians, Mercedarians, Barnabites, and others. Women have at times secured temporary admittance, though for intelligible reasons this privilege is now restricted. Since 1879 the archives have welcomed Catholics, Protestants, Hebrews, believers and infidels, Christians and heathens, priests and laymen, men and women, rich and poor, persons of high social standing and plain citizens, of every nation and language. The writer is acquainted with nearly all the great archives of Europe, and knows that none of them afford similar facilities to the historical student or extend him more courtesy. The number of visitors is at all times higher than to other archives, while the freedom allowed in the use of the material is the most far-reaching known; practically nothing is kept hidden. Results of research It is not easy to determine which branch of historical science derives most benefit from Vatican research, nor is the question a simple one. Chronologically, there is no doubt that so far the most favoured period is that of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. The sixteenth century comes next, much light being shed on it by the nunciature reports and the Acts of the Council of Trent. The seventeenth, eighteenth, and nineteenth centuries have hitherto been represented by few works, and these not very comprehensive. From the standpoint of subjects treated, Vatican research falls into three parts: * (1) The study of the ecclesiastical relations of Rome with individual nations or peoples; * (2) Roman ecclesiastical administration in all its details; * (3) the influence exerted by the papacy on the civilized world, whether purely political or of a mixed political and religious nature. If we consider the medieval period under the first of these subdivisions the results obtained are substantially as follows: * (a) compilation of correct lists of bishops and titular bishops; * (b) investigation of the so-called Servitia (communia et secreta), i. e. of certain dues paid at Rome, among them pallium dues; * (c) completer lists of bishoprics, abbeys, prelateships and churches directly subject to the Holy See; * (d) lists, as complete as possible, of all kinds of papal ordinances, processes decisions, constitutions, and decrees; * (e) study of the entire system of minor benefices in so far as affected by curial reservations; * (f) selection from the petition files of all requests growing out of the said system; * (g) reports of bishops on the state of their dioceses, and consistorial processes; * (h) investigation into the influence of the Inquisition, to determine how far the respective local authorities were influenced by the Curia; * (i) inquiry into the taxes imposed on clergy and Churches for purely ecclesiastical purposes, and into the ways and means of collecting these taxes. For certain dioceses, ecclesiastical provinces, regions, or entire countries, all these data, together with other items of information, have in the course of time been gathered, and published, by individuals and by associations. They have also, in a general way, been made generally accessible by the publication, as a whole, of the respective papal registers (see Papal registers), e. g. the \\"Regesta\\" publications of the French institute, and the cameral (papal fiscal) reports of the G√∂rres and Leo societies. \\"Chartularia\\", or collections of papal Bulls have been published not only for Westphalia, Eastern and Western Prussia, Utrecht, Bohemia, Salzburg, Aquileia, but also for Denmark, Poland, Switzerland, Great Britain, Ireland, and Germany (Repertorium Germanicum), not to speak of other countries. Many a student of the Vatican archives has devoted all his time to a single subject, e. g. Armellini, \\"Le Chiese di Roma\\"; Storm, \\"Die Obligationen der norwegischen Pr√§laten von 1311-1523\\"; Samaran-Mollat, \\"La fiscalit√© pontificale en France au l4me si√®cle\\"; Berli√®re, \\"Les 'Libri Obligationum et Solutionum' des archives vaticanes\\", for the Dioceses of Cambrai, Li√®ge, Th√©rouanne, and Tournai; Rieder, \\"R√∂mische Quellen zur Konstanzer Bisthumsgeschichte (1305-1378)\\". The work done in the second subdivision is of the greatest importance for questions of history, canon law, and general and medieval culture. The all-pervading activity of the medieval popes has been richly illustrated by various investigators, e. g. G√∂ller on the records of the \\"P≈ìnitentiaria\\"; Kirsch and Baumgarten on the finances (officials, administration) of the College of Cardinals; Baumgarten on the respective offices of the vice-chancellor and the \\"Bullatores\\", the residence- quarters of the Curia, its Cursores or messengers; Watzl, G√∂ller, and Sch√§fer on the finance bureau of the Curia; von Ottenthal on the secretaries and the \\"Chancery rules\\"; Tangl and Erler respectively on the \\"Chancery regulations\\" and the \\"Liber Cancellari√¶\\"; Kehr, Berli√®re, and Rieder on the petition files (libelli supplices), etc. The student will find quite helpful illustration of these delicate labours in the remarkable editions of the \\"Liber Pontificalis\\" by Duchesne; the \\"Liber Censuum\\" by Duchesne-Fabre; the \\"Italia Pontificia\\" by Kehr; the \\"Hierarchia Catholica Medii √Üvi\\" by Eubel; the \\"Catalogue of Cardinals\\" by Cristofori; the \\"Acts of the Council of Trent\\", by Ehses, Merkle, and Buschbell, not to speak of numerous other valuable works. As to the third subdivision, i. e. the purely political, or politico-ecclesiastical activities of the popes, no clearly defined distinction can be made, either in the Middle Ages or in more modern times, between these activities and the exercise of purely ecclesiastical authority; their numerous manifestations may be studied in the publications briefly described above. Abundant information is to be found in the publications of the papal \\"Regesta\\" and the \\"Camera\\" or treasury, records. We learn from them many curious items of profane history, e. g. the population of various kingdoms, grants of tithes to kings and rulers for political purposes, etc. The nunciature reports are rich in this information. In a general way the Vatican archives and these new historical Roman institutes have been particularly helpful towards a better knowledge of the ecclesiastico-religious relations of individual dioceses, countries, and peoples with the head of the Church and its central administration. So numerous have been the results of investigation published along these lines, that it has hitherto been impracticable to prepare an exhaustive bibliography of the works based on studies in the Vatican archives. Melampo and Ranuzzi, following in the footsteps of Meister, have recently published a very useful, but not at all exhaustive, list of all the books and essays of this kind which had appeared up to 1900: \\"Saggio bibliografico dei lavori eseguiti nell' Archivio Vaticano\\" (Rome, 1909).

Originally based in Madrid the Institute is now quartered in Rome.  History  In the 19th century, a group of Spanish Jesuits began the publication of letters of Saint Ignatius of Loyola. The century‚Äôs atmosphere of religious controversies and polemical anti-clerical and anti-Jesuit pamphlets and diatribes required, for appropriate rejoinders, that access be given to the foundational documents of Jesuit life and history. Historical science had also made great progress. New methods had been developed. Encouraged by General Congregation XXIV (of 1892) the Superior General of the Jesuits Luis Martin established in 1893 a 'College of writers' in Madrid, with mission to establish critical editions of the foundational documents of the Society of Jesus, particularly those regarding the life and times of the founders, Saint Ignatius of Loyola and his first companions. The purpose was also to provide material for accurate regional and national histories of the Society to be prepared in various European countries. The historians entrusted with the task adopted the critical methods of contemporary historical research. In January 1894 the first volume of the Monumenta Historica Societatis Iesu came out of the press. In 1911 the Institute extended its field of work and research and began to publish historical monographs on particular aspects of Jesuit life, spirituality and apostolic works. In 1930 the Superior General Wlodimir Ledochowski decided to transfer it to Rome, where it settled in the ‚ÄòCuria Generalizia‚Äô, headquarter of the Jesuit Order.  Collections and Publications  * The Monumenta Historica Societatis Iesu (MHSI) are critical editions of primary sources from the first centuries of the Society of Jesus‚Äô history. 156 volumes have been published. * Monumenta Historica Societatis Iesu (Nova series). A change of criteria and procedures introduced in 2005 opened a new series of ‚ÄòMonumenta‚Äô. Translations are added to the critical editions of primary sources. Moreover, volumes are no longer arranged chronologically but thematically. *The Bibliotheca Institutum Historici Societatis Iesu [BIHSI] are historical monographs on the culture, spirituality and apostolic works of the Society of Jesus. The series, opened in 1941, counts 64 publications in Spanish, French, English, German or Italian (in 2009). The authors are not of necessity Jesuits or members of the historical Institute. * Subsidia ad Historiam Societatis Iesu. This series publishes research tools in the same domain of Jesuit history: catalogues of persons, specialized bibliographies and index of archival documents. Open in 1957 the series has 15 volumes. * The Archivum Historicum Societatis Iesu [AHSI] is the bi-annual journal published since 1932 by the Institute. It receives articles focussing on aspects of Jesuit history and culture. Critical editions of primary sources are often included.

Floating wind farms have the potential to significantly increase the sea area available for offshore wind farms, especially in countries with limited shallow waters, such as Japan. Locating wind farms further offshore can also reduce visual pollution, provide better accommodation for fishing and shipping lanes, and reach stronger and more consistent winds. Commercial floating wind turbines are mostly at the early phase of development, with several single turbine prototypes having been installed since 2007. As of 2018, the only operational floating wind farm is Hywind Scotland, developed by Equinor ASA and commissioned in October 2017. The farm has 5 floating turbines with a total capacity of 30 MW. History Blue H Technologies - World's first floating wind turbine The world's second full-scale floating wind turbine (and first to be installed without the use of heavy-lift vessels), WindFloat, operating at rated capacity (2 MW) approximately 5 km offshore of Agu√ßadoura, Portugal VolturnUS 1:8 was the first grid-connected offshore wind turbine in the Americas. The concept for large-scale offshore floating wind turbines was introduced by Professor William E. Heronemus at the University of Massachusetts Amherst in 1972. It was not until the mid 1990s, after the commercial wind industry was well established, that the topic was taken up again by the mainstream research community. Blue H Technologies of the Netherlands deployed the world's first floating wind turbine, off the coast of Apulia, Italy in December 2007.Deep water wind turbines, The Institution of Engineering and Technology, 18 October 2010, accessed 6 November 2011 The prototype was installed in waters deep in order to gather test data on wind and sea conditions, and was decommissioned at the end of 2008. The turbine utilized a tension-leg platform design and a two-bladed turbine. Seawind Ocean Technology B.V., which was established by Martin Jakubowski and Silvestro Caruso - the founders of Blue H Technologies, acquired the proprietary rights to the two-bladed floating turbine technology developed by Blue H Technologies. A single floating cylindrical spar buoy moored by catenary cables. Hywind uses a ballasted catenary layout that adds 60 tonne weights hanging from the midpoint of each anchor cable to provide additional tension. The first large-capacity, 2.3-megawatt floating wind turbine was Hywind, which became operational in the North Sea near Norway in September 2009. The turbine was constructed by Siemens Wind Power and mounted on a floating tower with a 100 m deep draft, with a float tower constructed by Technip. After assembly in the calmer waters of √Öm√∏y Fjord near Stavanger, Norway, the 120 m tall tower was towed 10 km offshore into 220 m deep water, 10 km southwest of Karm√∏y, on 6 June 2009 for a two-year test deployment. Hywind, owned by Statoil, cost 400 million kroner (around US$62 million) to build and deploy. The long submarine power transmission cable was installed in July 2009 and system test including rotor blades and initial power transmission was conducted shortly thereafter. The installation was expected to generate about 9 gigawatt-hour of electricity annually. In 2010 it survived 11 meter waves with seemingly no wear.Nilsen, Jannicke. Statoil wants Hywind in Japan Teknisk Ukeblad, 4 April 2011. Accessed: 4 April 2011 By 2016, the turbine had produced 50 GWh; an overall capacity factor of 41%. The turbine was sold in 2019, expecting 10 more years of production and tests. In September 2011, Principle Power, backed by EDP, Repsol, ASM and Portugal ventures installed in Portugal the second grid-connected full-scale prototype. WF1 was fitted with a Vestas 2 MW turbine and went on to produce over 17 GWh of electricity over the next 5 years.SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS OF THE FULL LIFE- CYCLE OF THE WINDFLOAT FOWT PROTOTYPE PROJECT, OMAE2017-62561 The unit was decommissioned in 2016 and was later repurposed. In June 2013, the University of Maine deployed the 20 kW VolturnUS 1:8, a tall floating turbine prototype that is 1:8th the scale of a 6-MW, rotor diameter design. VolturnUS 1:8 was the first grid-connected offshore wind turbine deployed in the Americas. The VolturnUS design utilizes a concrete semi-submersible floating hull and a composite materials tower designed to reduce both capital and Operation & Maintenance costs, and to allow local manufacturing. The technology was the result of collaborative research and development conducted by the University of Maine-led DeepCwind Consortium. In 2013, Statoil pulled out of the $120 million project of four 3-MW turbines floating in 140 m depth of water near Boothbay Harbor, Maine citing change in legislation,Tux Turkel. \\"Statoil leaving Maine for more certain climate (page 1)\\" Page 2 Portland Press Herald, 15 October 2013.

Construction of the NOK 2 billion (¬£152m) project started in 2016 in Spain, Norway and Scotland. The turbines were assembled at Stord in Norway in summer 2017 using the Saipem 7000 floating crane, and the finished turbines were moved to near Peterhead. Three suction cup anchors hold each turbine. The first floating turbine in Japan was floated near Fukue Island in 2016, after a 5-year demonstration period near shore.Japanese floater gets relocated 4C, 21 April 2016 The 2-MW turbine was developed by Hitachi. In June 2016, Maine's New England Aqua Ventus I floating offshore wind demonstration project, designed by the DeepCwind Consortium, was selected by the U.S. Department of Energy to participate in the Offshore Wind Advanced Technology Demonstration program. Anchoring systems Left-hand tower- bearing structure (grey) is free floating, the right-hand structure is pulled by the tensioned cables (red) down towards the seabed anchors (light-grey). Two common types of engineered design for anchoring floating structures include tension-leg and catenary loose mooring systems. Tension leg mooring systems have vertical tethers under tension providing large restoring moments in pitch and roll. Catenary mooring systems provide station‚Äìkeeping for an offshore structure yet provide little stiffness at low tensions.\\"Floating Offshore Wind Turbines: Responses in a Seastate -- Pareto Optimal Designs and Economic Assessment, P. Sclavounos et al, October 2007 A third form of mooring system is the ballasted catenary configuration, created by adding multiple- tonne weights hanging from the midsection of each anchor cable in order to provide additional cable tension and therefore increase stiffness of the above-water floating structure. The IEC 61400‚Äì3 design standard requires that a loads analysis be based on site-specific external conditions such as wind, wave and currents. The IEC 61400‚Äì3-2 standard applies specifically to floating wind turbines. Economics The technical feasibility of deepwater floating wind turbines is not questioned, as the long-term survivability of floating structures has been successfully demonstrated by the marine and offshore oil industries over many decades. However, the economics that allowed the deployment of thousands of offshore oil rigs have yet to be demonstrated for floating wind turbine platforms. For deepwater wind turbines, a floating structure will replace pile-driven monopoles or conventional concrete bases that are commonly used as foundations for shallow water and land-based turbines. The floating structure must provide enough buoyancy to support the weight of the turbine and to restrain pitch, roll and heave motions within acceptable limits. The capital costs for the wind turbine itself will not be significantly higher than current marine-proofed turbine costs in shallow water. Therefore, the economics of deepwater wind turbines will be determined primarily by the additional costs of the floating structure and power distribution system, which are offset by higher offshore winds and close proximity to large load centres (e.g. shorter transmission runs). however, the economic feasibility of shallow-water offshore wind power is more completely understood. With empirical data obtained from fixed-bottom installations off many countries since the late 1990s, representative costs are well understood. Shallow-water turbines cost US$2.4-3 million per megawatt to install, according to the World Energy Council, while the practical feasibility and per-unit economics of deep-water, floating-turbine offshore wind is yet to be established. Initial deployment of single full-capacity turbines in deep-water locations began only in 2009. , new feasibility studies are supporting that floating turbines are becoming both technically and economically viable in the UK and global energy markets. \\"The higher up-front costs associated with developing floating wind turbines would be offset by the fact that they would be able to access areas of deep water off the coastline of the UK where winds are stronger and reliable.\\" The recent Offshore Valuation study conducted in the UK has confirmed that using just one third of the UK's wind, wave and tidal resource could generate energy equivalent to 1 billion barrels of oil per year; the same as North Sea oil and gas production. A significant challenge when using this approach is the coordination needed to develop transmission lines. A 2015 report by Carbon Trust recommends 11 ways to reduce cost.Floating Offshore Wind Market Technology Review Carbon Trust Also in 2015, researchers at University of Stuttgart estimated cost at ‚Ç¨230/MWh.https://www.sintef.no/globalassets/project/eera- deepwind-2015/presentations/f/f_matha_univ-stuttgart.pdf In California, offshore wind coincides well with evening and winter consumption, when grid demand is high and solar power is low. One of the few ports large enough to prepare offshore wind equipment could be Humboldt Bay. Oil well injection When oil fields become depleted, the operator injects water to keep pressure high for secondary recovery. This requires power, but installing gas turbines means shutting down the extraction process, losing valuable income. The classification society DNV GL has calculated that in some cases a floating wind turbine can economically provide power for injection, as the oil platform can keep on producing, avoiding a costly pause.Nilsen, Jannicke. \\"DNV GL: N√• kan det l√∏nne seg med flytende havvind til oljeplattformer\\" In English Teknisk Ukeblad, 20 January 2015. Accessed: 22 January 2015 In 2016 DNV GL, ExxonMobil and others approved calculations of saving $3/barrel of oil using a 6MW Hywind instead of traditional engines, driving two 2MW pumps injecting water into an offshore oil well. At least 44,000 barrels of processed water per day can be injected, even on calm June days.Win-Win floating wind concept 'feasible' for oil & gas developments (paywall) The project began laboratory testing in 2017. Floating wind farms Hywind Scotland has 5 floating turbines with a total capacity of 30 MW, and operated since 2017. Japan has 4 floating turbines with a combined 16 MW capacity.

In 2018, NEDO has announced two tenders to be launched in early February, aiming to support the development of both floating and fixed-bottom offshore wind projects in the country. The US State of Maine solicited proposals in September 2010 to build a floating wind farm. The RFP is seeking proposals for 25 MW of deep-water offshore wind capacity to supply power for 20-year long-term contract period in the Gulf of Maine. Proposals were due by May 2011.Maine seeks 30MW of offshore wind and tidal pilots , BrighterEnergy.org, 3 September 2010, accessed 12 September 2010State point man on offshore wind clearly energized, Maine Sunday Telegram, 6 June 2010, accessed 13 June 2010: \\"In September, the state plans to send out bids to build the world's first floating, commercial wind farm off the Maine coast.\\" In April 2012 Statoil received state regulatory approval to build a large four-unit demonstration wind farm off the coast of Maine. , the Hywind 2 4-tower, 12‚Äì15 MW wind farm was being developed by Statoil North America for placement off the east coast of Maine in -deep water of the Atlantic Ocean. Like the first Hywind installation off Norway, the turbine foundation will be a spar floater. The State of Maine Public Utility Commission voted to approve the construction and fund the US$120 million project by adding approximately 75 cents/month to the average retail electricity consumer. Power could be flowing into the grid no earlier than 2016. As a result of legislation in 2013LD 1472 by the State of Maine, Statoil placed the planned Hywind Maine floating wind turbine development project on hold in July 2013. The legislation required the Maine Public Utilities Commission to undertake a second round of bidding for the offshore wind sites with a different set of ground rules, which subsequently led Statoil to suspend due to increased uncertainty and risk in the project. Statoil is considering other locations for its initial US demonstration project. Some vendors who could bid on the proposed project in Maine expressed concerns in 2010 about dealing with the United States regulatory environment. Since the proposed site is in federal waters, developers would need a permit from the US Minerals Management Service, \\"which took more than seven years to approve a yet-to-be-built, shallow-water wind project off Cape Cod\\" (Cape Wind). \\"Uncertainty over regulatory hurdles in the United States ‚Ä¶ is 'the Achilles heel' for Maine's ambitions for deepwater wind.\\" In August 2019, Enova awarded NOK2.3 billion to Equinor for a NOK5 billion 88 MW floating wind farm called Hywind Tampen, with the purpose of reducing technology costs and supplying power to the Snorre and Gullfaks oil fields from 2022. Research Scale modeling and computer modeling attempt to predict the behavior of large‚Äìscale wind turbines in order to avoid costly failures and to expand the use of offshore wind power from fixed to floating foundations.

So they can be used as prototype test units to practically assess the design adequacy and wind power potential of prospective sites. When the transmission of generated wind power to nearby land is not economical, the power can be used in power to gas applications to produce hydrogen gas, ammonia / urea, reverse osmosis water desalination, natural gas, LPG, alkylate / gasoline, etc. on floating platforms which can be easily transported to nearby consuming centres. Floating wind turbines can be used to provide motive power for achieving artificial upwelling of nutrient-rich deep ocean water to the surface for enhancing fisheries growth in areas with tropical and temperate weather. Though deep seawater (below 50 metres depth) is rich in nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus, the phytoplankton growth is poor due to the absence of sunlight. The most productive ocean fishing grounds are located in cold water seas at high latitudes where natural upwelling of deep sea water occurs due to inverse thermocline temperatures. The electricity generated by the floating wind turbine would be used to drive high‚Äìflow and low‚Äìhead water pumps to draw cold water from below 50 meters water depth and mixed with warm surface water by eductors before releasing into the sea. Mediterranean Sea, Black Sea, Caspian Sea, Red Sea, Persian Gulf, deep water lakes/reservoirs are suitable for artificial upwelling for enhancing fish catch economically. These units can also be mobile type to utilise the seasonal favourable winds all around the year. Floating design concepts Eolink Floating Wind Turbine Single Point Mooring Eolink Eolink floating wind turbine is a single point mooring system technology. The patented structure of this French company based in Plouzan√© is a semi-submersible floating hull with a 4 masts pyramidal structure. The structure supports the turbine by 2 upwind and 2 downwind masts. It gives more clearance for the blades and a distributes stress. Unlike most of the floating wind turbines, the turbine rotates around its single mooring point to face the wind. The pivot point ensures the mechanical and electrical link between the turbine and the sea floor. Eolink grid connected its first 1/10th scale demonstrator of the 12 MW wind turbine in April 2018.https://www.batiactu.com/edito/eolink-autre-eolienne-flottante- francaise-52782.php DeepWind Ris√∏ DTU National Laboratory for Sustainable Energy and 11 international partners started a 4-year program called DeepWind in October 2010 to create and test economical floating Vertical Axis Wind Turbines up to 20 MW.

Retrieved: 11 November 2010 Flowocean Flowocean is a Swedish technology company with its own proprietary technology for floating offshore wind power with head office in the city of V√§ster√•s, Sweden. FLOW is a semi-submersible floating offshore wind turbine technology with two wind turbine generators on one floating platform. The structure weather vanes passively so that the wind turbines always face the wind. Flow technology is a combination of Tension Leg Platform(TLP) and Semi-Submersible which gives the Flow unit the benefits of both principles and allows the unit to be robust and light. Flowocean has developed a patented design for floating offshore wind power plants aiming to make floating offshore wind power cost-effective. FLOW can be considered an assembly of three systems, the floater, the buoy and the mooring system. The floater is all structure that is rotating. The buoy is of turret type, is moored to the sea bed and contains a bearing that allows the floater to rotate freely around it. The mooring system is the set of components that anchors the buoy to the sea bed, i.e. mooring lines/ropes/chains, chain stoppers and anchors. The FLOW units are highly standardised with all sub-systems well proven. Inter-array wind farm cabling and mooring systems are shared between the units. GICON The GICON-TLP is a floating substructure system based on a tension leg platform (TLP) developed by GICON GmbH. The system is deployable from 45 meters to 350 meters water depth. It consists of six major components: four buoyancy bodies, horizontal pipes for structural base, vertical pipes which pass through the water line, angled piles for connection with the transition piece. Cast nodes are used to connect all components. The TLP can be equipped with an offshore wind turbine in range of 6‚Äì10 MW. The GICON-TLP is anchored to the seabed via four pre-tensioned mooring ropes with a buoyant gravity-base anchor consisting of concrete. No pile driving or drilling for anchoring is necessary. All ropes are connected at the corners of the square based system. The TLP for a 6MW wind turbine is currently being developed by the GICON Group and their key partner, the Endowed Chair for Wind Energy Technology (LWET) at the University of Rostock, utilizing prefabricated steel-concrete composite components in combination with components of steel. A main focus of the TLP design is on the modularity and the possibility of assembly in any dry dock near to the installation site and without the use of construction vessels.Frank Adam u. a.: Entwicklung eines Fundaments f√ºr Offshore-Windenergieanlagen aus Stahl-Beton-Verbundbauteilen. In: Schiff & Hafen. Heft 11/2016, S. 40‚Äì43, ISSN 0938-1643 After offshore location is reached, joints of TLP and anchor will be decoupled and the gravity anchor will be lowered down by using ballast water. Once the anchor has reached the bottom, it is filled with sand. One unique feature of the system is the sufficient floating stability during transport as well as during operations. In October 2017, model tests took place in the model test facility of French √âcole Centrale de Nantes (ECN) with 1:50 model of the GICON¬Æ-TLP incl. wind turbine. Based on this test a TRL of 5 was reached. Ideol Steel floating substructure designed by Ideol for 3.2 MW NEDO project (Japan) based on Ideol technology, fully coated in dry dock before wind turbine installation Ideol's 2MW floating wind turbine installed off France Ideol's engineers have developed and patented a ring-shaped floating foundation based on a central opening system (Damping Pool) used for optimizing foundation + wind turbine stability. As such, the sloshing water contained in this central opening counteracts the swell-induced floater oscillations. Foundation-fastened mooring lines are simply attached to the seabed to hold the assembly in position. This floating foundation is compatible with all wind turbines without any modification and has reduced dimensions (from 36 to 55 metres per side for a wind turbine between 2 and 8 MW). Manufacturable in concrete or steel, this floating foundation allows for local construction near project sites. Ideol leads the FLOATGEN project, a floating wind turbine demonstration project based on Ideol's technology, built by Bouygues Travaux Publics and operational off the coast of Le Croisic on the offshore experimentation site of Ecole Centrale de Nantes (SEM-REV). The construction of this project, France's first offshore wind turbine with a capacity of 2 MW, was completed in April 2018 and the unit installed on site in August 2018. For the month of February 2020, it had an availability of 95% and a capacity factor of 66%. In August 2018, Hibiki, the second demonstrator with an aerodyn Energiesysteme GmbH 3.2 MW 2-bladed wind turbine was installed 15 km East of the port of Kitakyushu by Japanese conglomerate Hitachi Zosen. Ideol developed the design for this steel hull that was manufactured in a Japanese dry dock. In August 2017, the French government has selected Eolmed, a consortium led by French renewable energy developer Quadran in association with Ideol, Bouygues Travaux Publics and Senvion, for the development and construction of a 25MW Mediterranean floating offshore wind farm 15 km off the coastal town of Gruissan (Languedoc-Roussillon), planned to be commissioned 2020. Nautica Windpower Nautica Windpower has proposed a technique for potentially reducing system weight, complexity and costs for deepwater sites. Scale model tests in open water have been conducted (September 2007) in Lake Erie and structural dynamics modeling was done in 2010 for larger designs. Nautica Windpower's Advanced Floating Turbine (AFT) uses a single mooring line and a downwind two-bladed rotor configuration that is deflection tolerant and aligns itself with the wind without an active yaw system. Two-bladed, downwind turbine designs that can accommodate flexibility in the blades will potentially prolong blade lifetime, diminish structural system loads and reduce offshore maintenance needs, yielding lower lifecycle costs. SeaTwirl SeaTwirl develops a floating vertical axis wind turbine (VAWT). The design intended to store energy in a flywheel, thus, energy could be produced even after the wind stopped blowing. The floater is based on a SPAR solution and is rotating along with the turbine. The concept limits the need for moving parts as well as bearings in the hub region. SeaTwirl is based in Gothenburg Sweden and is registered on the European growth market First North. SeaTwirl deployed its first floating grid connected wind turbine off the coast of Sweden in August 2011. It was tested and decommissioned.Justin Wilkes et al. The European offshore wind industry key 2011 trends and statistics p5 European Wind Energy Association, January 2012. Accessed: 26 March 2012 In 2015 SeaTwirl launched a 30 kW prototype in the archipelago of Sweden which is connected to the grid at Lysekil. The company aimed to scale the concept with a turbine of 1MW size in 2020. The concept is scalable for sizes well over 10MW. VolturnUS  The VolturnUS design utilizes a concrete semi- submersible floating hull and a composite materials tower designed to reduce both capital and Operation & Maintenance costs, and to allow local manufacturing. VolturnUS is North America's first floating grid-connected wind turbine. It was lowered into the Penobscot River in Maine on 31 May 2013 by the University of Maine Advanced Structures and Composites Center and its partners. During its deployment, it experienced numerous storm events representative of design environmental conditions prescribed by the American Bureau of Shipping (ABS) Guide for Building and Classing Floating Offshore Wind Turbines, 2013. The VolturnUS floating concrete hull technology can support wind turbines in water depths of 45 m or more. With 12 independent cost estimates from around the U.S. and the world, it has been found to significantly reduce costs compared to existing floating systems. The design has also received a complete third-party engineering review. In June 2016, the UMaine-led New England Aqua Ventus I project won top tier status from the US Department of Energy (DOE) Advanced Technology Demonstration Program for Offshore Wind. This means that the Aqua Ventus project is now automatically eligible for an additional $39.9 Million in construction funding from the DOE, as long as the project continues to meet its milestones. WindFloat A diagram of the WindFloat system. WindFloat is a floating foundation for offshore wind turbines designed and patented by Principle Power. A full-scale prototype was constructed in 2011 by Windplus, a joint-venture between EDP, Repsol, Principle Power, A. Silva Matos, Inovcapital, and FAI. The complete system was assembled and commissioned onshore including the turbine. The entire structure was then wet-towed (from southern to northern Portugal) to its final installed location offshore of Agu√ßadoura, Portugal, previously the Agu√ßadoura Wave Farm. The WindFloat was equipped with a Vestas v80 2.0-megawatt turbineShahan, Zachary. 1st-of-its-kind floating wind turbine technology to be deployed by Vestas & WindPlus Clean Technica, 23 February 2011.

Accessed: 22 February 2011 \\"When the wind turns, the platform is kept level by pumping more water into one of the three cylinders.\\" This permits the platform to maintain even keel while producing the maximum amount of energy. This is in contrast to other floating concepts which have implemented control strategies that de- power the turbine to compensate for changes in turbine thrust-induced overturning moment. This technology could allow wind turbines to be sited in offshore areas that were previously considered inaccessible, areas having water depth exceeding 40 m and more powerful wind resources than shallow-water offshore wind farms typically encounter. A 25 MW WindFloat project received government permission in December 2016, with EU funding the ‚Ç¨48 million transmission cable. The ‚Ç¨100 million project is expected to be funded by 2017 and operational by 2019. Three structures with 8 MW Vestas turbines were towed to sea in 2019. A WindFloat with a 2MW Vestas turbine installed near Scotland began delivering power in late 2018. By January 2020, the first of WindFloat's three 8.4-megawatt MHI Vestas turbines was in operation. Power is transmitted to a substation 12 miles away on shore, through a cable anchored to the seabed at a depth of about 100 meters.

History The forest was on extensive lands owned by the Berkeley family of Berkeley Castle in Gloucestershire, home to extensive stocks of wild boar and fallow deer. In the 13th century Thomas de Berkeley was assigned to be the keeper of the Tutbury ward, and while resident at Tutbury Castle liked to hunt the forest, and had a hunting lodge built, Byrkley Lodge. In 1267, Thomas married the daughter of William de Ferrers, the Earl of Derby. During the rebellion of Simon de Montford against King Henry III, the de Ferrers family allied themselves with the rebellion. After the rebellion was put down, the de Ferrers were forced to forfeit their estates to the crown. Henry III gave the forest to his son Edmund Crouchback, 1st Earl of Lancaster, in 1266. His son Thomas, 2nd Earl of Lancaster died childless in 1322, and thus the wood passed to the King. Renamed Needwood Chase or royal forest, it was subsequently owned by the Duchy of Lancaster until it passed into the possession of Henry IV in 1399. By this time the lodge had become the residence of the local keeper (judge). The lodge was redeveloped by King Edward IV, and used extensively for hunting by both him and King James I. It was during this period that the forest became commonly associated with Sir Gawain's Green Knight. Enclosure and deforestation In 1776, Francis Noel Clarke Mundy privately published a book of poetry called \\"Needwood Forest\\" which contained his own poem of the same name and supportive contributions from Sir Brooke Boothby Bt., Erasmus Darwin and Anna Seward. The purpose of Mundy's poems was to resist calls for the enclosure of the forest. Seward wrote a poem called \\"The fall of Needwood Forest\\", which she regarded as \\"one of the most beautiful local poems\\". Seward's parents adopted Honora Sneyd Edgeworth, who was probably related to the engraver, Mary Emma Sneyd. By the early 1790s, Thomas Gisborne held the perpetual curacy of Barton-under-Needwood. Gisborne regarded Needwood much as Gilbert White did Selborne, and wrote of his walks in the forest to resist enclosure. However, in 1803 an Act of Parliament was passed, allowing the forestry commissioners to enclose the lands and deforest it. By 1811 the land had been divided amongst a number of claimants. By 1851 Needwood Forest was described as forming \\"one of the most beautiful and highly cultivated territories in the honour of Tutbury, which contains of land, in the five parishes of Hanbury, Tutbury, Tatenhill, Yoxall, and Rolleston, and subdivided into the four wards of Tutbury, Barton, Marchington, and Yoxall, which together form a district of over in length and three in breadth, extending northwards from Wichnor to Marchington Woodlands.\\" Present The former forest area now encloses some twenty farms, on which dairy farming is the principal enterprise. Byrkley Lodge was demolished in 1953, and today its former grounds are the site of the English National Football Centre, St George's Park. of woodland remain, with some parts still open to the public. Jackson Bank located at Hoar Cross is a mature, mixed woodland still owned by the Duchy of Lancaster, which is open to the public. Bagot's Wood near Abbots Bromley claims to be the largest remaining part of the forest. The National Forest is an environmental project planned to link the ancient forests of Needwood and Charnwood. Portions of Leicestershire, Derbyshire and Staffordshire are being planted, in an attempt to create a area blending ancient woodland with new plantings to create a new national forest.

Originally formed as a volunteer cavalry force in 1793, it fought in the Second Boer war as part of the Imperial Yeomanry. In the World War I the regiment fought at Gallipoli, in Palestine and on the Western Front. The unit was subsequently converted into a Royal Artillery unit, serving in the anti-tank role North Africa, Italy and France during World War II. The lineage is maintained by No. 677 (Suffolk and Norfolk Yeomanry) Squadron AAC. French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars After Britain was drawn into the French Revolutionary Wars, a number of independent cavalry Troops were raised in the County of Suffolk from August 1793. The following year the government of Prime Minister William Pitt the Younger proposed that the counties should form Corps of Yeomanry Cavalry that could be called on by the King to defend the country against invasion or by the Lord Lieutenant to subdue any civil disorder within the county, and the Suffolk Troops were accepted as Yeomanry.Suffolk Yeomanry at Regiments.org.Mileham, p. 112.Rogers, p. 145. These troops were at Bury St Edmunds, Eye (known as the Suffolk and Norfolk Borderers, or as the Suffolk and Norfolk Borderers), Ipswich, Botesdale, Ickworth, Fornham, Lowestoft, Saxmundham and Stowmarket. Some of the troops were disbanded in 1800 and six of the remainder were regimented as the 1st Regiment of Loyal Suffolk Yeomanry Cavalry. 19th Century The regiment was formally disbanded in 1827 but revived in 1831 as the Suffolk (1st Loyal Suffolk) Troop of Yeomanry Cavalry, trained as Lancers. In 1868 the 1st Suffolk was amalgamated with another independent troop at Long Melford to form the West Suffolk Regiment of Yeomanry Cavalry. It was converted to Hussars in 1872, dropped the 'West' prefix in 1875, and assumed the supplementary title of 'Loyal Suffolk Hussars' in 1883. Finally, it received the title of Suffolk Yeomanry Cavalry (The Duke of York's Own Loyal Suffolk Hussars) when the Duke of York (later King George V) became its Honorary Colonel in 1894.Army List, various dates. Captain Richard Colvin raised a new Troop of the regiment in the neighbouring County of Essex in 1889.Mileham, pp. 84‚Äì5.Foakes & Mckenzie- Bell, p. 8.

Imperial Yeomanry Group portrait of the Suffolk Yeomanry Following a string of defeats during Black Week in early December 1899, the British government realised that it would need more troops than just the regular army to fight the Second Boer War. On 13 December, the decision to allow volunteer forces to serve in South Africa was made, and a Royal Warrant was issued on 24 December. This officially created the Imperial Yeomanry (IY). The force was organised as county service companies of approximately 115 men signed up for one year, and volunteers from the Yeomanry and civilians (usually middle and upper class) quickly filled the new force, which was equipped to operate as Mounted infantry.Rogers, p. 228.Spiers, p. 239.Dunlop, pp. 104‚Äì18.IY at Anglo-Boer War. The Loyal Suffolk Hussars raised the 43rd and 44th (Suffolk) Companies. A company of the Loyal Suffolk Hussars first left Southampton on 31 January 1900, bound for Cape Town.

In addition, Capt (now Lt- Col) Colvin of the Essex Troop commanded the 20th (Rough Riders) Battalion IY, which was raised on 17 March 1900 in the City of London and landed in South Africa on 3 May.IY Companies at Roll of Honour.Imperial Yeomanry at Regiments.org. In May and June the 12th Bn IY was serving as Corps Troops with Lord Roberts' main army north of the Orange River.Amery (1909), Appendix to Chapters I-XIV, pp. 503‚Äì14. The First Contingent of the Imperial Yeomanry completed their year's term of service in 1901, the two Suffolk companies having earned the regiment its first Battle honour: South Africa 1900‚Äì01.Leslie. The Imperial Yeomanry were trained and equipped as mounted infantry. The concept was considered a success and before the war ended the existing Yeomanry regiments at home were converted into Imperial Yeomanry, with an establishment of HQ and four squadrons with a machine gun section. This included the Loyal Suffolk Hussars. A new regiment of Essex Yeomanry was also formed on the basis of the Suffolk Hussars' Essex Troop, and commanded by Lt-Col Colvin. World War I Mobilisation At the start of the First World War, 'A' squadron was at Cambridge, 'B' squadron and 'HQ' was at Bury St Edmunds, 'C' squadron was at Ipswich and 'D' squadron was at Beccles. In accordance with the Territorial and Reserve Forces Act 1907 (7 Edw. 7, c.9) which brought the Territorial Force into being, the TF was intended to be a home defence force for service during wartime and members could not be compelled to serve outside the country. However, on the outbreak of war on 4 August 1914, many members volunteered for Imperial Service. Therefore, TF units were split in August and September 1914 into 1st Line (liable for overseas service) and 2nd Line (home service for those unable or unwilling to serve overseas) units. Later, a 3rd Line was formed to act as a reserve, providing trained replacements for the 1st and 2nd Line regiments. As of August 1914 two local MPs were serving as officers, Frank Goldsmith and Walter Guinness.Wilson (1998), pp. 172‚Äì173.  1/1st Duke of Yorks Own Loyal Suffolk Hussars The 1/1st was embodied in August 1914 at Bury St. Edmunds and became part of the Eastern Mounted Brigade, 1st Mounted Division.Suffolk Yeomanry at Regimental Warpath. In September 1915, they were dismounted and moved to the ANZAC bridgehead at Gallipoli and came under the command of the 54th (East Anglian) Division. After they were withdrawn from Gallipoli they moved to Egypt in December 1915, the first party being evacuated to Mudros on 14 December and the rest following five days later. They were next attached to the 3rd Dismounted Brigade on Suez Canal defences, from 22 February 1916.Suffolk Yeomanry at Long, Long Trail. Headquarters officers of the 15th (Suffolk Yeomanry) Battalion, Suffolk Regiment, 74th (Yeomanry) Division. Near Carvin 14 August 1918. The battalion was formerly known as the 1/1st Duke of Yorks Own Loyal Suffolk Hussars. In January 1917, they were converted to an infantry battalion and formed the 15th (Suffolk Yeomanry) Battalion, the Suffolk Regiment in the 74th (Yeomanry) Division, which moved to France in May 1918.  2/1st Duke of Yorks Owns Loyal Suffolk Hussars The 2nd Line regiment was formed in 1914 and by January 1915 it was in the 2/1st Eastern Mounted Brigade at Ely. On 31 March 1916, the remaining Mounted Brigades were ordered to be numbered in a single sequence; the brigade was numbered as 13th Mounted Brigade and joined 4th Mounted Division in the Wivenhoe area. In July 1916, the regiment was converted to a cyclist unit in 5th Cyclist Brigade, 2nd Cyclist Division, still in the Wivenhoe area. In November 1916, the division was broken up and regiment was merged with the 2/1st Norfolk Yeomanry to form 7th (Suffolk and Norfolk) Yeomanry Cyclist Regiment in 3rd Cyclist Brigade, in the Ipswich area. In March 1917 it resumed its identity as 2/1st Suffolk Yeomanry, still at Ipswich in 3rd Cyclist Brigade. By July 1917 the regiment had moved to Woodbridge. In May 1918 the regiment moved to Ireland and was stationed at Boyle and Collooney, still in 3rd Cyclist Brigade, until the end of the war.  3/1st Duke of Yorks Own Loyal Sufolk Hussars The 3rd Line regiment was formed in 1915 and in the summer it was affiliated to a Reserve Cavalry Regiment in Eastern Command. In 1916 it was dismounted and attached to the 3rd Line Groups of the East Anglian Division at Halton Park, Tring. Early in 1917 the regiment was disbanded and its personnel were transferred to the 2nd Line regiment and the 4th (Reserve) Battalion of the Suffolk Regiment at Halton Park. Interwar years On 31 January 1920 the War Office announced that recruitment for the reconstituted Territorial Army (as it was now known) would begin, but that only 16 out of the 55 existing Yeomanry regiments would be retained in their traditional mounted role.Sainsbury, p. 31. The remainder were converted to other roles, and the Suffolk Yeomanry provided two batteries in 103rd (Suffolk) Brigade, Royal Field Artillery (RFA).Litchfield, p. 185‚Äì7.Litchfield, p. Appendix VII.Monthly Army List, various dates. However, in 1923 the two Suffolk Yeomanry batteries transferred to the 108th (Norfolk Yeomanry) Brigade, and after the RFA was merged into the Royal Artillery (RA) in 1924 the unit was constituted as follows:Titles and Designations. 108th (Suffolk and Norfolk Yeomanry) Field Brigade, RA * HQ at Swaffham * 411 (Suffolk Yeomanry) Bty at Old Barracks, Bury St Edmunds * 412 (Suffolk Yeomanry) Bty at Beccles, later at the Drill Hall, St Peter's Street, Lowestoft * 429 (Norfolk Yeomanry) Bty at Swaffham, later at Cattle Market Barracks, Norwich * 430 (Norfolk Yeomanry) Bty (Howitzer) at Swaffham The unit was an 'Army' field brigade in 54th (East Anglian) Divisional Area. In 1938 the RA was reorganised, 'brigades' became 'regiments', and some field regiments were converted to the anti-tank (A/T) role. 108th Field Brigade became 55th (Suffolk and Norfolk Yeomanry) Anti-Tank Regiment, RA and the batteries were renumbered 217‚Äì220.Litchfield, pp. 218‚Äì20. The unit became the divisional A/T regiment of 54th (East Anglian) Division.Joslen, p. 89. World War II Mobilisation By 1939 it became clear that a new European war was likely to break out and, as a direct result of the German invasion of Czechoslovakia on 15 March, the doubling of the Territorial Army was authorised, with each unit and formation forming a duplicate. When the TA was mobilised on 1 September, the Norfolk and Suffolk Yeomanry 'Duplicate and Original Regiments' were on annual training at Chiseldon Camp, and the 'Norfolk Duplicate Batteries' and 'Lowestoft Contingent' returned to Swaffham. The following day, orders were issued to split the unit into 55th (Suffolk Yeomanry) A/T Rgt at Bury St Edmunds as part of 54th Division, and 65th (Norfolk Yeomanry) A/T Rgt at Swaffham as part of the duplicate 18th Infantry Division. The Suffolk Yeomanry part was organised as follows:65 A/T Rgt at RA 1939‚Äì45.65 (NY) A/T Rgt War Diary 1939‚Äì40, The National Archives (TNA), Kew, file WO 166/1637. 55th (Suffolk Yeomanry) Anti-Tank Regiment * HQ at Bury St Edmunds * 217 Bty at Bury St Edmunds * 218 Bty at Lowestoft * 219 Bty at Bury St Edmunds and Brandon * 220 Bty at Beccles The Regiment was attached to various Divisions during the war: :54th (East Anglian) Infantry Division, September 1939 :79th Armoured Division, September 1942 ‚Äì April 1943 :49th (West Riding) Infantry Division, July 1943 ‚Äì August 1945 From July 1943 until after the end of the war, the regiment served with the 49th (West Riding) Division and fought in the North-Western Europe from June 1944 to May 1945. Postwar After the war the regiment was reconstituted as 308th (Suffolk Yeomanry) Anti-Tank Regiment, RA with headquarters at Bury St Edmunds. It amalgamated with 358th (Suffolk) Medium Regiment, RA, to form 358th (Suffolk Yeomanry) Medium Regiment, RA in 1958 and it amalgamated with 284th (King's Own Royal Regiment, Norfolk Yeomanry) Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment, RA to form 308th (Suffolk and Norfolk Yeomanry) Field Regiment, RA in 1961. During the major reorganisation of the Territorial Army that took place in 1967, the unit was reduced to battery size as 202 (The Suffolk and Norfolk Yeomanry) Battery, RA, part of 100 (Medium) Regiment Royal Artillery (Volunteers). The battery, which had been equipped with the 105mm light gun, re-roled as an air defence unit and transferred to 106th (Yeomanry) Regiment Royal Artillery in July 1999. It re-roled again and became No. 677 (Suffolk and Norfolk Yeomanry) Squadron AAC, part of 6 Regiment Army Air Corps in July 2006. Squadron Headquarters and A Flight are at Bury St Edmunds, B Flight at Norwich and C Flight at Ipswich. Uniforms and insignia A county meeting at Stowmarket on 28 May 1794 decided that the uniform for the troops of Yeomanry Cavalry being raised in Suffolk would be 'a dark blue coat faced with yellow, cape [collar] and cuffs, yellow shoulder-straps white waistcoat, leather breeches, high topt [sic] boots, round hat, white feather and cockade, white [metal] buttons, with the letters S.Y. (Suffolk Yeomanry)'. However, the Yeomanry did not approve of the pattern and another meeting on 12 June ordered a uniform of 'Scarlet coat, lined white, with dark blue military cape and cuffs, scarlet and blue chain epaulets, white waistcoat, leather breeches, high topt boots, round hat, with bearskin, feather and cockade, white plated button, with the Crown and Garter of the Order, the words \\"Loyal Suffolk Yeomanry\\" inscribed on the Garter'. A great-coat of dark blue, lined white, with uniform buttons was also prescribed. The first troop raised was to bear 'No. 1' on the button and the other troops similarly numbered in order of acceptance by the Lord- lieutenant.G.O. Rickword, 'Suffolk Yeomanry Cavalry: Uniform, 1794', Journal of the Society for Army Historical Research, Vol 22, No 90 (Summer 1944), pp. 259‚Äì260. Until 1868 the several independent troops that made up The Loyal Suffolk Hussars wore a variety of different cavalry uniforms. In 1850 these included green with gold lace for the 1st Loyal Suffolk Troop; a scarlet light dragoon dress for the Suffolk Borderers; and a dark green lancer uniform for the Long Melford Troop. Brought together as the Suffolk Yeomanry Cavalry in 1868, the amalgamated regiment adopted a heavy dragoon dress of green with red facings with a brass Albert helmet and white plume. In 1878 fashion changes had led to a green hussar uniform with braided dolman and fur busby. The hussar dress was changed to blue-green in the 1880s. By 1902 a special levee- dress jacket had been authorised for officers, modelled on that of the Royal Horse Artillery but in green and red.R.G. Harris, colour plate 24 and text, \\"50 Years of Yeomanry Uniforms\\", Frederick Muller Ltd 1972, SBN 584 10937 7 By the 1911 Coronation other ranks were wearing a \\"mid-bright green\\" tunic and overalls (tight cavalry breeches) with red facings. Officers however retained the levee-dress: variously described as \\"lavish\\" and \\"magnificent\\". After 1914 the standard khaki service and (subsequently battledress) became normal wear, although the combination of green and red survived in items such as the officer' field service cap.See illustration above Up until the 1961 amalgamation the Suffolk Yeomanry batteries of the RA continued to wear the Loyal Suffolk Hussars cap badge (in gilt or bronze for officers, bimetal for other ranks). During World War II the officers wore the badge embroidered on their side caps.Anon, Badges. Battle honours The Suffolk Yeomanry has been awarded the following battle honours: ;Second Boer War South Africa 1900‚Äì01 ;First World War Somme 1918, Bapaume 1918, Hindenburg Line, √âp√©hy, Pursuit to Mons, France and Flanders 1918, Gallipoli 1915, Egypt 1915‚Äì17, Gaza, Jerusalem, Tell 'Asur, Palestine 1917‚Äì18 ;Second World War None awarded to artillery. The Royal Artillery was present in nearly all battles and would have earned most of the honours awarded to cavalry and infantry regiments. In 1833, William IV awarded the motto Ubique (meaning \\"everywhere\\") in place of all battle honours.RA at Regiments.org.

Facts Spartan Steel and Alloys Ltd had a stainless steel factory in Birmingham, which obtained its electricity by a direct cable from the power station. Martin & Co Ltd were doing work on the ground with an excavator and negligently damaged that cable (Spartan Steel did not own the cable). As a consequence, the factory was deprived of electricity for 15 hours which caused physical damage to the factory‚Äôs furnaces and metal, loss of profit on the damaged metal and loss of profit on the metal that was not melted during the time the electricity was off. Spartan Steel claimed all the three heads of damage. Judgment The Court of Appeal, consisting of Lord Denning MR, Edmund-Davies LJ and Lawton LJ delivered a majority judgment (Edmund-Davies LJ dissenting), that the Spartan Steel could only recover the damages to their furnaces, the metal they had to discard and the profit lost on the discarded metal. They could not recover the profits lost due to the factory not being operational for 15 hours. Their main reasoning for this was that while the metal was physical damage and the lost profits was \\"directly consequential\\" upon the damage, the profits lost due to the blackout constituted \\"pure economic loss\\". Although the majority seemed to agree that Martin & Co Ltd owed the Spartan Steel a duty of care and the damage was not too remote since it was foreseeable, they declined to allow the recovery of pure economic loss for policy reasons outlined by Lord Denning in his leading judgment. ;Dissent by Edmund-Davies LJ Edmund-Davies LJ did not agree with the majority, finding that the loss was both direct and foreseeable consequence of the defendant's negligence and should therefore be recovered. In his view, in most cases, spurious claims could be avoided either on the grounds that no duty was owed or that the damage was too remote. Significance The judgment has outlined in very clear terms that there are two types of economic loss: economic loss consequential on physical damage and \\"pure\\" economic loss. Only the first is in principle recoverable. This has led to much litigation concerning the precise distinction between economic and physical damage as well as to disagreements when the economic loss could be seen as consequential upon physical loss.See e.g. Anns v Merton London Borough Council [1978] AC 728; and Murphy v Brentwood District Council [1990] 2 All ER 908 See also *English tort law *Negligence *Pure economic loss *Dominion Tape of Canada Ltd v LR McDonald& Sons Ltd [1971] 3 OR 627, 21 DLR (3d) 299 (Co.

The song is about the sport of shinty and has become an anthem for the sport.Skye Camanachd Runrig have previously referenced shinty in the songs \\"Pride of the Summer\\" from The Cutter and the Clan and \\"Recovery\\" from the album of the same name. The song also appeared on the 2013 compilation album Larry Kirwan's Celtic Invasion. Themes The song is about the sport of shinty and the first verse revolves around a team making their way to an away game, through \\"straths and glens\\". Prominent throughout the song is the use of nicknames, which are a common element. The second verse is a portrayal of a game against Kinlochshiel, the only shinty team named in the song in the line: But if we do all that and there‚Äôs no-one spare Tell me who‚Äôs gonna mark the Kinlochshiel Bear. This verse refers to various positions on the shinty park as well as the sawdust, a reference to the penalty box aka the \\"D\\" which is often marked out with sawdust instead of paint. The final verse references shinty's long history (shared with hurling) which stretches back to ancient Celtic history: And for every fighting Highland man Stand by your brother, die for the clan. The song also praises the amateur status of those who play the sport: These shinty boys shine like the sun.

In the 1960s and 1970s, the Drake Hotel was the preferred accommodation in New York for a number of touring rock bands, such as Led Zeppelin and The Who. During their stay there in July 1973, Led Zeppelin had $203,000 in cash stolen from a safe deposit box at the hotel. The money was never recovered and the identity of the thief or thieves has never been discovered. The band later sued the Drake Hotel for the theft.Chris Welch (1994) Led Zeppelin, London: Orion Books. , p. 68. The British rock band Slade stayed at the hotel on October 6, 1973 after their gig at the New York Academy of Music.

Demolition and redevelopment The hotel was acquired in the early 1980s by the Swissotel company of Zurich, which renamed it Swissotel The Drake and undertook a $52 million room-by-room renovation of the building. The hotel received positive national exposure, as the syndicated talk show Donahue used the hotel to accommodate the show's guests, in exchange for a mention of it on each episode. Renovations were completed in 1991. In 2006 the hotel was sold for $440 million (equivalent to $ million in ) to developer Harry Macklowe. It was demolished in 2007, and the site became one of New York's most valuable development sites in 2011. In mid-2012, construction began on a residential skyscraper, 432 Park Avenue, on the site.

History Mill Green Mill was built in 1759, replacing an earlier mill which stood some to the east during the period 1564‚Äì1731. The mill was built by Robert Barker, a millwright from Chelmsford. A roundhouse was included from the start. The mill was owned by the Petre estate and records of expenditure on the mill are in the Essex Record Office. In July or August 1774, a farmer was killed by being struck by the sails of the mill. New sails were fitted in 1802 and 1806, and a new stock in 1821. An accident at the mill resulted in the miller sustaining a fractured thigh in 1852, and the owner of the mill being reported to have been carried round on the sails for ten or twelve revolutions before he was rescued. The roof of the mill was repaired in 1878 and the mill re-tarred. A new sail was fitted in 1884 and a new pair of sails in 1902. The mill was working until at least 1905. Some repairs were done to the body of the mill in the 1930s. The mill was restored in 1959 by R.F. Collinson, who had bought the mill house and discovered the mill in the garden. This entailed the complete replacement of the frame of the mill, including the crowntree. On 2 January 1976, the sails ran away in a gale and the brake wheel disintegrated. A new brake wheel was constructed in 1989. Description Mill Green Mill is a post mill with a single-storey roundhouse. The mill is winded by a tailpole. It has two spring sails and two spring patents. There are two pairs of millstones arranged head and tail. Trestle and roundhouse The trestle is of oak, with the main post thought to be of sweet chestnut. The crosstrees are long, square at the ends, thickening to by at the centre. The underside of the lower crosstree is above ground level. The main post is nearly in length, square at its base and diameter at the top. The quarterbars are by in section. The roundhouse is of brick, with a boarded roof covered in tarred felt. Body The body of the mill measures by in plan. The crowntree is by in section. It has a cast-iron plate bolted to its underside, with a pintle projecting downwards that fits into a cast-iron pot on the top of the main post, a reversal of the normal fitting. The side girts are by in section. Sails and windshaft As originally built, the mill would have had a wooden windshaft and four common sails. The windshaft is of cast iron, probably replacing a former wooden one. It is long and carries the head and tail wheels. The mill has two spring sails and two spring patents. The sails have a span of . Machinery The head wheel is of clasp arm construction, it is diameter. It has an iron segment ring bolted on which has a total of 120 teeth. It drive a cast-iron stone nut, with 20 cogs. Originally, the head wheel had 69 cogs, of 4¬Ω in (114 mm) pitch. The tail wheel is also of clasp arm construction, diameter. It has an iron segment ring bolted on which has a total of one hundred teeth. It drives a cast-iron stone nut, with fifteen cogs. Both wheels were made from elm. The headstones are diameter and the tailstones are diameter.

Benefices In its widest signification, canonical institution denotes any manner, in accordance with canon law, of acquiring an ecclesiastical benefice.Regula prima juris, in VIto In its strictest sense, the word denotes the collation of an ecclesiastical benefice by a legitimate authority, on the presentation of a candidate by a third person (institutio tituli collativa). The term is used also for the actual putting in possession of a benefice (institutio corporalis), and for the approbation requisite for the exercising of the ecclesiastical ministry when an authority inferior to the bishop has power to confer an ecclesiastical benefice (institutio auctorisabilis).Cf. gloss on \\"Regula prima juris\\", in VIto, s. v. \\"Beneficium\\". Institutio tituli collativa The institutio tituli collativa (that which gives the title), sometimes also called verbalis (which may be by word of mouth or by writing, as distinguished from the institutio corporalis, or realis), is the act by which an ecclesiastical authority confers a benefice on a candidate presented by a third person enjoying the right of presentation. This occurs in the case of benefices subject to the right of patronage (jus patronatus), one of the principal prerogatives of which is the right of presenting to the bishop a titular for a vacant benefice. It also occurs when, in virtue of a privilege or of a concordat, a chapter, a sovereign, or a government has the right to present to the pope the titular of a bishopric or of an important ecclesiastical office. If the pope accepts the person presented, he bestows the institutio canonica on the titular, The effect of this act is to give the candidate who has been presented (and who till then had only a jus ad rem, i. e. the right to be provided with the benefice) a jus in re or in beneficio, i.e. the right of exercising the functions connected with the benefice and of receiving revenues accruing from it. The right of institution to major benefices rests in the pope, but in the case of minor benefices it may belong to a bishop and his vicar-general, to a vicar capitular, or even to other ecclesiastics, in virtue of a foundation title dating from before the Council of Trent,Sess, XIV, \\"de Ref.\\", c. xii. or of a privilege, or of prescription. In all these cases the bishop has the right to examine the candidate, excepting candidates presented by universities recognized canonically;Council of Trent, Sess. VII, \\"de Ref.\\", c. xiii; Sess. XXV, \\"de Ref.\\", c. ix. even this exception does not apply to parishes.Council of Trent, Sess. XXIV, \\"de Ref.\\", c. xviii. Institution ought to be bestowed within the two months following the presentation, in the case of parish churches,Constitution of Pius V, \\"In conferendis\\", 16 March 1567. but canon law has not specified any fixed time with regard to other benefices. However, if the bishop refuses to grant institution within the time appointed by a superior authority, the latter can make the grant itself. Institutio corporalis The institutio corporalis, also called investitura, or installatio, is the putting of a titular in effective possession of his benefice. Whereas canon law permits a bishop to put himself in possession of his benefice (see canonical provision), in the case of minor benefices it requires an actual installation by a competent authority. The bishop may punish any one who takes possession of a benefice on his own authority, and the violent occupation of a benefice in possession of another ecclesiastic entails on the guilty party the loss of all right to that benefice. The right of installation formerly belonged to archdeacons, but is now reserved to the bishop, his vicar-general, or his delegate, ordinarily the dean (decanus christianitatis or foraneus). It is performed with certain symbolical ceremonies, determined by local usage or by diocesan statutes, such, for instance, as a solemn entry into the parish and into the church, the handing over of the church keys, a putting in possession of the high altar of the church, the pulpit, confessional, etc. In some countries there is a double installation: the first by the bishop or vicar-general, either by mere word of mouth, or by some symbolical ceremony, as, for instance, presenting a biretta; the second, which is then a mere ceremony, taking place in the parish and consisting in the solemn entry and other formalities dependent on local custom. In some places custom has even done away with the institutio corporalis properly so called; the rights inherent to the putting in possession are acquired by the new titular to the benefice by a simple visit to his benefice, for instance, to his parish, with the intention of taking possession thereof, provided such visit is made with the authority of the bishop, thus precluding the possibility of self-investiture. When the pope names the titular to a benefice, he always mentions those who are to put the beneficiary in possession. The following are the effects of the institutio corporalis: * From the moment he is put in possession the beneficiary receives the revenues of his benefice. * He enjoys all the rights resulting from the ownership and the possession of the benefice, and, in particular, it is from this moment that the time necessary for a prescriptive right to the benefice counts. * The possessor can invoke in his favour the provisions of rules 35 and 36 of the Roman Chancery de annali, and de triennali possessione. This privilege has lost much of its importance since the conferring of benefices is now a matter of less dispute than in former times. Formerly, on account of various privileges, and the constant intervention of the Holy See in the collation of benefices, several ecclesiastics were not infrequently named to the same benefice. Should one of them happen to have been in possession of the benefice for a year, it would devolve on the rival claimant to prove that the possessor had no right to the benefice; moreover, the latter was obliged to begin his suit within six months after his nomination to the benefice by the pope, and the trial was to be concluded within a year counting from the day when the actual possessor was cited to the courts (rule 35 of the Chancery). These principles are still in force. The triennial possession guaranteed the benefice to the actual incumbent in all actions in petitorio or in possessorio to obtain a benefice brought by any claimant whatsoever (rule 36 of the Chancery). * The peaceful possession of a benefice entails ipso facto the vacating of any benefices to which the holder is a titular, but which would be incompatible with the one he holds. * It is only from the day when bishops and parish priests enter into possession of their benefices that they can validly assist at marriages celebrated in the diocese or in the parish.Decree \\"Ne temere\\", 2 August 1907. Furthermore, in some dioceses the statutes declare invalid any exercise of the powers of jurisdiction attached to a benefice, before the actual installation in the benefice. Institutio auctorisabilis The institutio auctorisabilis is nothing but an approbation required for the validity of acts of jurisdiction, granted by the bishop to a beneficiary in view of his undertaking the care of souls (cura animarum). It is an act of the same nature as the approbation which a bishop gives members of a religious order for hearing confessions of persons not subject to their authority, and without which the absolution would be invalid; but there is this difference that in the case of the institutio auctorisabilis the approbation relates to the exercise of the ministerial functions taken as a whole. It is the missio canonica indispensable for the validity of acts requiring an actual power of jurisdiction. This institution, which is reserved to the bishop or his vicar- general and to those possessing a quasi-episcopal jurisdiction, is required when the institutio tituli collativa belongs to an inferior prelate, a chapter, or a monastery. The institutio tituli collativa given by the bishop himself implies the institutio auctorisabilis, which, therefore, needs not to be given by a special act.

Location The village of Kafr Misr is situated about southeast of Mount Tabor on a ridge that overlooks the valley of Wadi Bireh, also known as Nahal Tabor, through which runs the tributary of Nahal Shumar.Alexandre, 2008, Kafr Misr Final Report Name The Bustan El Marj Regional Council website transcribes the village's name as Kufur Masser and translates kufur as \\"village\\" and masser as \\"Egypt\\", writing that the name originated with the ancient Egyptians who invaded the area in 605 BC under the rule of the Pharaoh Necho II. The Crusaders called the village Kaphar Mazre, and due to its unique fertile area and water supply, it became an agriculture center. In a map dating from 1799, its name is recorded as Mebhel which means beauty.Karmon, 1960, p. 167 The Arab village was founded by Egyptian immigrants, hence its name.Room, 2005, p. 185Morris, 2004, p. 17 Its name as recorded by the Palestine Exploration Fund in 1888 is Kefr Misr, whereas Edward Robinson and Eli Smith transliterate it as Kefr Musr in 1841.Robinson and Smith, 1841, vol. 3, p. 219 Zimmerman's map from 1861 records its name as Kefr Masr.Grootkerk, 2000, p. 304. The transliteration of its name into English used in this article was used during the period of the British Mandate in Palestine. History Ancient sites in the village show the centrality of its role at various times in history. According to the Bustan Al Marj Regional Council, the current inhabitants of Kafr Misr include the descendants of those who have lived there for hundreds, even thousands of years, while others descended from those who came to the village from Egypt at the beginning of the 19th century, when Muhammad Ali temporarily controlled the area. During a salvage excavation in September 2006, pottery fragments dating to the Late Roman or Byzantine period were discovered in a layer of plaster for what was interpreted to have served as a small pool designed to collect overflow waters from a nearby spring. A synagogue thought to have been constructed around the same time, in the 3rd century, was excavated between 1948 and 1987, and provides evidence for the existence of a Jewish community inhabiting Kafr Misr then. Renovated in the 4th century, following damage sustained from an earthquake, a Torah niche was added, which was later replaced by an apse, suggesting the edifice was converted into a church.Stemberger, 2000, p. 138. A trial excavation in 2002, carried out some to the east of the synagogue structure, revealed a number of ancient walls, constructed of small and medium size rocks and plaster, that were founded on the basalt bedrock. Artifacts collected during this excavation included the rim of bowl from the late Byzantine period (circa 7th century), a jug handle and the neck of a bottle from the Early Islamic period (8th-9th centuries), and a bronze platter dated to the 11th century. The platter, though dated to the Islamic period, was made in the Byzantine style.Syon, 2006, Kafr Misr: Final Report In 2004, another excavation carried out prior to construction in an area described as, \\"the ancient nucleus of the village,\\" which lies some from the village mosque, uncovered the remains of a wall built of basalt and limestone at the level of the basalt bedrock. In the soil overtop, a number of pottery fragments dating to the Early Islamic era were recovered.Mokary, 2008, Kafr Misr Other sites, such as a theatre and foundations of public places, show further evidence of Christian habitation, while still others show additional evidence of Muslim habitation, particularly during the Mamluk period in the 13th-14th centuries. Ottoman era In 1517, the village was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire with the rest of Palestine, and in 1596 it appeared in the Ottoman tax registers under the name of Misrasafa, being in the nahiya (\\"Subdistrict\\") of Tabariyya, part of Safad Sanjak, with a population of 10 households, all Muslim. The villagers paid taxes on wheat, barley, occasional revenues, goats and beehives; a total of 1,970 ak√ße.H√ºtteroth and Abdulfattah, 1977, p. 190 In 1799, Kafr Misr was marked Mebhel on Jacotin‚Äôs map surveyed during Napoleon's invasion. Kafr Misr fell under the rule of Muhammad Ali, the Egyptian general, between 1831 and 1840, which resulted in Egyptians coming to settle in the village at that time. The dresses worn by Egyptian women differed from the Palestinian costumes worn by the natives of Palestine, and were principally distinguished by the donning of a long Egyptian-style veil that generally had a piece of brass or metal connecting it to the headdress. Such differences could still be seen by travellers visiting the village in 1901.Baldensperger, 1901, p. 259 In 1838, Kefr Musr was defined as located in the province of Jenin.Robinson and Smith, 1841, vol 3, 2 Appendix, p. 130 In The Lands of the Bible Visited and Described (1847), John Wilson identifies Kefr Mu·π£r as the site of ancient Meroz given its proximity to Nein (ancient Nain) and Endor (Indur). Meroz is a site mentioned in the Song of Deborah and Barak as having been cursed by the angel of God for failing to come to the aid of the Israelites.Wilson, 1847, p. 107. In 1875, Victor Gu√©rin passed by Kafr Misr, and remarked that it looked like an ancient site.Gu√©rin, 1880, pp. 139-140 In 1882, the PEF's Survey of Western Palestine (SWP) described it as \\"a small mud village, with a spring on the north, standing in plough-land, and inhabited by Egyptians, whence its name.\\"Conder and Kitchener, 1882, SWP II, p. 85 British Mandate era In the 1922 census of Palestine conducted by the British Mandate authorities, Kufr Mesr had a total population of 253; all Muslims,Barron, 1923, Table XI, Sub-district of Baisan, p. 38 decreasing slightly in the 1931 census to a population of 236, still all Muslim, in a total of 60 houses.Mills, 1932, p. 79 In the 1945 statistics the population of Kafr Misr was 330 Muslims,Department of Statistics, 1945, p. 6 with 13,230 dunams of land, according to an official land and population survey.Government of Palestine, Department of Statistics.

It occupies the eastern wing of the 18th-century Palazzo Reale in Naples, at 1 Piazza del Plebiscito, and has entrances from piazza Trieste e Trento. It is funded and organised by the Direzione Generale per i Beni Librari and the Ministero per i Beni e le Attivit√† Culturali. In quantitative terms it is the third largest library in Italy, after the national libraries in Rome and Florence, with 1,480,747 printed volumes, 319,187 pamphlets, 18,415 manuscripts, more than 8,000 periodicals, 4,500 incunabula and the 1,800 Herculaneum papyri.Ministero dei Beni e delle Attivit√† culturali - Official statistics History and collections The library was founded at the end of the 18th century in the Palazzo degli Studi (which now houses the Museo Archeologico), with its nucleus formed of books holdings of the Palazzo Capodimonte, the library from the celebrated Farnese Collection that Carlo di Borbone had transferred to Naples in 1734). Opened to the public in 1804 under the name of the Reale Biblioteca di Napoli, in 1816 it became the Reale Biblioteca Borbonica. Additions to its collection came from abolished religious houses and those confiscated from private collections. With the unification of Italy in 1860 it took up its present name of the Biblioteca Nazionale. In 1910 the Officina dei papiri ercolanensi was added to the library ‚Äì this was the workshop founded by Carlo di Borbone to conserve the papyri found in excavations at Herculaneum. After long debate and on the suggestion and efforts of Benedetto Croce, in 1922 the library was moved to its present location at Palazzo Reale, granted to the library by King Victor Emmanuel III (whose name it still bears). After the transfer, the collections of other important Neapolitan libraries were annexed to it, including the Biblioteca Brancacciana (formed in Rome by cardinal Francesco Maria Brancaccio in the first half of the 17th century, transferred to Naples, and finally becoming Naples' first public library). It suffered during the Second World War due to the German and Allied occupations of Naples (being set fire to by the Germans in the four days of Naples), though the most precious manuscripts had been transferred to safer locations and remained there until the library reopened in 1945. In 1980 a wing of the building was seriously damaged by an earthquake, forcing the library to transfer some of its holdings to another part of the building.

Primarily working in Formula One, he has previously held positions with the McLaren, Ferrari, Manor Racing, and Benetton teams. He is currently with Renault for the 2020 season. Early career Fry was born in Shepperton, Surrey, England. After attempting several engineering courses, he became an apprentice at Thorn EMI in 1981. While at Thorn EMI, he completed a day-release course in electronics at the City of London Polytechnic. He moved onto Thorn's missile programmes, before deciding to leave the company in 1987 to pursue a career in motorsport. Motorsports career Benetton (1987‚Äì1993) Fry had an interest in building suspension systems for motorbikes in his spare time, and joined the Benetton Formula One team's research and development department in Witney, Oxfordshire, who at the time were working on active suspension systems. He moved to the test team and then to the team's Godalming research and development department. He returned to the test team in , before being made Martin Brundle's race engineer in . McLaren (1993‚Äì2010) In , former Benetton colleague Giorgio Ascanelli persuaded Fry to join him at McLaren. His initial position was to work on active suspension systems, and run the McLaren test team, but active suspension systems were banned by the sports governing body before the start of the 1994 season and so Fry moved to an engineering position in the race team. After a season as Mika H√§kkinen's race engineer in , he returned to the McLaren test team in despite rumours linking him with a move to Ferrari. He renewed his contract with McLaren in to become David Coulthard's race engineer, a role he held for four years. He moved to a tactical coordinating role in , overseeing both the team's race cars. In 2002 he was promoted to the role of Chief Engineer of Race Development, and was responsible for the MP4-20 (Autosport's 2005 Racing Car Of The Year), MP4-22 (Autosport's 2007 Racing Car Of The Year) and MP4-24 chassis. Ferrari (2010‚Äì2014) Following the 14 May 2010 announcement of his departure from McLaren, came an announcement on 22 June that Fry was to join the Ferrari team as assistant technical director from 1 July. On 4 January 2011 Ferrari announced that Fry had replaced Chris Dyer as head of race track engineering (while retaining his assistant technical director position under Aldo Costa). The change was made following a tactical error in the final race of the 2010 season which cost Fernando Alonso a chance at the title. On 24 May 2011, Aldo Costa was moved to an undefined position within the team and Fry was given the job as director of chassis, with the position of technical director being removed outright. Restructuring of Ferrari management made Fry's position one of three‚Äîthe others being production director (filled by Corrado Lanzone) and electronics director (filled by Luca Marmorini)--to report directly to team boss Domenicali, who assumed the duties (if not the title) of technical director. On 23 July 2013 Ferrari announced that Lotus technical director James Allison would take over as chassis technical director as of 1 September; Fry will remain with Ferrari as director of engineering (a newly created position) and continue to report directly to Domenicali alongside Allison and chief designer Nikolas Tombazis.Ferrari confirm Allison as technical director starting in September. Grand Prix 24/7 29 July 2013 Ferrari said Fry would leave the team in a restructuring announced 16 December 2014. Manor Racing (2016‚Äì2017) In January 2016, Fry joined Manor Racing as engineering consultant. McLaren (2018‚Äì2019) On 4 September 2018 McLaren announced Fry would join the team as engineering director in a temporary capacity, while awaiting the arrival of full-time technical director James Key from gardening leave at Toro Rosso. Fry lead the team in the process of developing the 2019 car. In July 2019 it was reported Fry had gone on gardening leave at the culmination of his temporary assignment.  Renault (2020‚Äì)  On 2 November 2019, the Renault F1 Team announced that Fry will join the team for the 2020 season. Personal life On 20 April 2002, Fry married Kate Habershon, a food editor and stylist who had worked in motorsport catering.

A conformation of a knot is a particular embedding of a circle into three-dimensional space. Depending on the needs of the energy function, the space of conformations is restricted to a sufficiently nicely behaved class. For example, one may consider only polygonal circles or C2 functions. A property of the functional often requires that evolution of the knot under gradient descent does not change knot type. Electrical charge The most common type of knot energy comes from the intuition of the knot as electrically charged. Coulomb's law states that two electric charges of the same sign will repel each other as the inverse square of the distance. Thus the knot will evolve under gradient descent according to the electric potential to an ideal configuration that minimizes the electrostatic energy. Naively defined, the integral for the energy will diverge and a regularization trick from physics, subtracting off a term from the energy, is necessary. In addition the knot could change knot type under evolution unless self- intersections are prevented. Variations An electrostatic energy of polygonal knots was studied by Fukuhara in 1987. and shortly after a different, geometric energy was studied by Sakuma.. As cited by .. In 1988, Jun O'Hara defined a knot energy based on electrostatic energy, M√∂bius energy.. A fundamental property of the O'Hara energy function is that infinite energy barriers exist for passing the knot through itself. With some additional restrictions, O'Hara showed there were only finitely many knot types with energies less than a given bound. Later, Freedman, He, and Wang removed these restrictions..

It has an estimated population of 566,310 people in 2009. The people speak Enuani dialect of the Igbo language family. The name of the community is more commonly and officially known and written as Ibusa. The movements forming the process of Ibusa can be linked to the first and second waves of the movement of Igbo migrants into the West Bank of River Niger, the first adventure led by Edini from Nshi (Nri) and the second of the two waves of the migrations led by Umejei resulted in the formation of Igbuzo.The Realities and Values of Anioma Identity, Dan Olisa Dieyi, Danfeyin International Co., 2001,  History   Pre-colonial history  The name \\"Ibusa\\" is an Anglicization of Igbuzo and/or Ibuzo \\"Igbo bi na uzor\\" or \\"Igbo Uzor\\" meaning the Igbos that live by the wayside or \\"Were you the first to settle here?\\" (Ibuzo). All the names that community bear today were foisted on them by other people. \\"Igbuzo\\" was a name used to describe the settlement by the Igbos of the South-East, \\"Ibuzo\\" by Ogwashi-Uku, Asaba, Oko, Ilah and Okpanam, who are the community's immediate neighbours, and \\"Ibusa\\" by the early European missionaries who found it difficult to effectively pronounce the name of the community. Igbo historians such as Emeka Esogbue (of Ibusa origin) and C. N. Ugochukwu (Nnewi origin) share the opinion that groups who left Benin with Ezechima and journeyed Eastward might have settled in Igbuzo considering the geographical location of the town.Ugochukwu, C. N. (2000), Isu Factor in Nnewi History. Tabansi Publishers. The implication of this therefore is that this new set of settlers could have been sick or generally lacking in interest in furthering their journey, this could also have resulted in their final settlement in not too distant Onitsha. This new group of settlers in Igbuzo might have become assimilated by the Umejei and Edini groups.  Oral history  Ibusa is a federation of two units known as ‚Äúthe Umejei and Ogboli settlements. According to the oral history of the town, Umejei Nwa Eze Isu (Prince Umejei of Isu) killed his opponent in a traditional wrestling bout, an act considered ‚ÄúAlu‚Äù (Abomination) in the land and punishable by death. However, his death was commuted by his father who was also Eze Isu) the king of Isu and he was encouraged to go on exile with a gourd prepared and given to him by his father. Umejei was emphatically instructed to settle wherever the pot dropped, he thus set-off with friends, relations and sympathizers who accompanied him. The gourd however dropped at the present site of Ani-Oshe in Omeze (Umueze) where he founded Igbuzo. The Ogboli factor has it that at Nshi (Nri) Odaigbo slept with one of his father‚Äôs wives but Eze Nshi commuted the mandatory death sentence to exile. His father, mother and younger brother, Edini voluntarily opted to accompany him. Odaigbo and Edini were given one pot each and charms by Eze Nshi with the instruction to settle wherever the pot fell and on crossing the River Niger, Edini‚Äôs pot fell at Ani-Nshi(Nri)Ogboli in Ibusa. Odaigbo‚Äôs pot was to fall at the present site of Ogwashi-Uku where he also settled. The groups (Umejei and Edini later became one and known as Ibusa) The Ogboli of Igbuzo are thus regarded as part of the larger Nri (Nshi) community. The two communities of Edini and Umejei aspects later became known as Ibusa.Buchi Emecheta in the Joys of Motherhood The Igbo and Anioma people of Delta state, regard and praise Ibusa as group of people who often refuse food in other to prosecute wars (Isu (Igbuzo) fu ogu ju nni). This statement authenticates the bravery of these people in wars. Ibusa historians are currently conducting researches on the history of wars fought by the Igbuzo people especially in the homes of their Isu kiths and kin in Nnewi, present Anambra State to determine whether any relationship exists between the two communities.  Anglicization of name  \\"Ibusa\\" is an Anglicisation of \\"Igbuzo\\" and/or Ibuzo by the early British missionaries and visitors to the town as a result of difficulty in pronunciation. The Anglicization of the name of the town may have been effected in the 19th century following the Ekwumekwu Wars that the community led. \\"Ibusa\\" was considered more distinctive by the British, thus was adopted as the official name of the town and made to appear in all the official documents of the colonial government. The name \\"Igbuzo\\" - Igbo bi na uzor, meaning \\"the Igbo living along the way or road\\" - is, however, the native name of the town as used only by the natives today. The nickname of the town is however \\"Isu Na Mba Ogu\\" (Warriors from Isu), or colloquially Igbuzo-Isu (The Igbo-uzo(r) from Isu). Igbuzo is uniquely addressed with different names and even made noticeable with different spellings such as Ibusa, Igbuzo, Igbouzo, Igbuzor, Ibuzor, Ibuza and Ibuzo. This is believed to have been necessitated by the strategic location of the town along the busy roads and the history of the settlement of the people.  Ibusa today  The federation of Ibusa is today constituted by ten Quarters or villages thus the common reference to the town as ‚ÄúIgbuzo ebi Ili‚Äù These ten Quarters are Umuekea, Umuodafe, Umuidinisagba, Umueze, Umuehea, Ogbeowele, Anyalabum (i.e. Ezukwu and Achalla-Igbuzo), Umuwagwu, Umuezeagwu and Ogboli. The Ibusa town is today basically a federation of two autonomous settlements with different origins, the Igbuzo settlement and the Ogboli settlement in what Prof. M. A. Onwuejeogwu has illustrated it as a friendship alliance which has developed into a complicated political union, a political union that has undergone many process which today constitute the unwritten constitution of Ibusa. It has also been historically noted that at the beginning, the Ibusa- Ogboli federal knit had its Diokpa because the settlements have different origins, so they have different ofo. Today, the entire Ibusa clan have a single Diokpa and ofor. In 1936, the Ibusa-Ogboli union was threatened owing to a dispute as both settlements threatened to suspend marriage, but this was soon resolved amicably as both groups have continued to live in oneness. Greetings in Ibusa are quite remarkable and usually follow a pattern of whether one is an indigene of an any particular quarter or not. In Umuekea Quarter, for instance, while a native is greeted with \\"Omogwu\\", a woman being married in that quarter is exclusively greeted with \\"Oliofe.\\" Familiarity is therefore necessary before salutation is paid in the native way of the town. The native kinds of greeting stand out the Igbuzo people out and reminds the people of their history and tradition. Emeka Esogbue in his writings has advocated for more insightful researches aimed at actually determining the particular Isu town in Igbo (southeast) that Umejei originated from. This, he argues will enable the people ascertain their true kith and kin. Authorities of Igbo History and sometimes prominent sons and daughters of different Isu towns of the South-East have at one time or the other laid claims to several Isu communities as the place of origin of Prince Umejei, a co-founder of Ibusa. Prominent among these towns are Isu Awka in Anambra State, Isu Njaaba near Owerri in Imo State and probably Isu Anaocha in Anambra State. For administrations and the purpose of determining the successor to the Obuzor throne as defined by the famous Supreme Court ruling on Diokpa vs Obuzor, the various Quarters of Ibusa are classified into three categories, thus: *Otu Odogwu-Umueze and Anyallabum *Otu Uwolo-Ogboli, Umuwagwu, Umuidinisagba and Umuodafe *Otu Iyase-Umuehea, Ogbeowele, Umuezeagwu, and Umuekea. The Supreme Court later classified this War Lords as a ruling house for the determination of the Obuzor of the town.  The Ibusa traditional life  How the community people carried wars into Nnewi in defense of Isu and Nri people of the town considered their ancestral brothers and sisters until the coming of the British are well recorded by C. N. Ugochukwu. Igbuzo played a prominent role in Ekumeku War (1883‚Äì1914) an uprising directed against the British imperialism in Anioma, Southern region of Nigeria, and attempts by the Royal Niger Company to impose trade and taxation on the people of Anioma. Ibusa was to play a very prominent role in prosecuting the wars in favour of Anioma and was the first of such Anioma towns to engage the British in the war in 1898. Fearing what befell the great Benin Empire in 1897, Igbuzo fiercely came all out to defend itself and other Anioma towns against the British Royal Niger Company forces commanded by Major Festing. Ibusa was though subjugated after long standing battles but the British forces sustained casualties this led to the emergence of \\"Ibusa\\" in the Dictionary of the British parliament as what punitive measures to mete to the town was for weeks debated in Britain.Anioma Essence Magazine, No. 1, Vol. 4, 2008. After the battles, the British in admiration of the stoutness of the town established St. Thomas‚Äô College, the first Higher Institution of Learning in Delta state in 1928, which made Ibusa an important educational center from where missionary evangelism spread to other Anioma towns and communities and beyond. The establishment of St. Augustine's Catholic Church in 1898 by the French Missionaries was led by Father Cario Zappa.  Culture  Before the advent of Christianity in Ibusa, the Ibusa practiced Odinani but the people are now largely Christians (Catholics) but adherents of traditional religion still exists. It is therefore not uncommon to find the people placing high priority on observation of traditions during the funerals of their loved ones etc. The Eternal Sacred order of Cherubim and Seraphim, celestial church of christ, Winners Church, The Redeemed Christian Church of God, Christ Embassy, Ngozi Sabbath Mission, Deeper Life Bible Church, Christ Holy Church (Odozi Obodo), Christ Apostolic Church (CAC), The Apostolic Church are some of the numerous churches located in the town. The people place high cultural value on kola nut in discharging their traditional responsibilities. For instance, a visitor who rejects the acceptance of kolanut may have slighted his host. Kolanut is also used in observing traditional prayers and may be the first item used in welcoming guests at social gatherings before commencement of discussions. For many centuries, Oboshi, Atakpo, Oduche, Asiama streams remained major sources of water to the people but Oboshi and Atakpo stand out as streams venerated as deities. These two streams are venerated because of the powers with which they have protected not only the people but the whole town, according to the belief of the people. As a result, the people of Igbuzo as result forbid the eating of fishes from the Oboshi River. The Chief Priest of Oboshi is ‚ÄúOhene‚Äù, popularly called Ohene-Mmili. The last of the Ohene, Ohene Ezedi, died on 7 January 2009.  Ethnic identity  Not a few Igbuzo indigene differ on the Igbo origin of the Igbuzo people. Recently, the Daily Sun newspaper in an interview series titled \\"Anioma cannot deny being Igbo. We will be irrelevant politically if we do\\" published on Wednesday, April 7, 2010 captured differing opinions of two political stalwarts from the community with regard to the issue of ethnic identity of the people of Igbuzo. Chief Mike Nduka Okwechime, the national President of Izu Anioma, had reportedly told a local publication: \\"We may speak a dialect of Igbo but we are not culturally and socially Igbos by Ohaneze's definition.\\" In reaction Obi Modestus Nwaka, President of Ohaneze Ndigbo, Delta State stated that \\"Our origin has never been in doubt before and after the civil war\\" while referring to the appointment of Anioma-born Amb. Ralph Uwechue's leadership of Ohaneze Ndigbo.  The Ibusa festivals  The people of Ibusa celebrate several festivals such as Iwu, Ine, Ulor, Ekwensu but the Iwu festival, annually celebrated by the Umuadafe and Ogbeowelle Quarters of the town, is the most popular of them all. That of Umuadafe is celebrated annually in December (around the Christmas period) drawing the attention of numerous people from far and near to the town. The festival is aimed at cleansing and purifying the town as a whole and songs and to thank the Almighty God for abundant harvest which the farmers of the town may have experienced all through the year. During this festival, traditional songs are also composed to ridicule defaulters of the norms traditions of the society no matter their social standing in the town. Ohene (chief Priest) and Eze-Iwus are expected to perform some rituals of the cleansing of the town to properly take place. Evidences from Ibusa historians suggest that the Iwaji festival celebrated by the people of Ibusa may have been imported from the neighboring Anioma town of Okpanam, in Delta State, and the Ichu-Ulor (Ulor festival) celebrated by Ezukwu, Umuodafe, Umuekea, Umuidinaisagba, Ogbeowele and Umueze Quarters of the town from Aballa and Ndokwa communities respectively. Ifejioku is another annual festival often traditionally celebrated by indigenes. Uchu- Ulor in Ibusa is annually celebrated in August. The people have vast cultures and celebrations are unique but yet to be fully exploited by the state government. One of such events is the popular Iwu Festival being celebrated by Ogbeowele and Umuodafe respectively. The Iwu festival is held annually at the end of the farming period to thank God who made it possible for them to see the farming year run out. Iwu is believed to have been brought to Ibusa by Oyana of Adigwe family in of Umuwor Ogbeowele quarter of the town. The Ogwa (shhrine) where it was first celebrated can still be found by the entrance in Umuwor, Ogbeowele. Principal actors of the festival are three Eze Iwu and an Ohene. The event starts with four days of absolute silence when no noise is entertained or it attracts a penalty which ranges from kolanuts to a fine of a goat which in those days happens to be the highest fine. During this period, okanga dance from other quarters are diverted to another route, there is also no marriage as it also serves as period of Lent and purification of the land.  Geography  Geographically, \\"Ibusa is a dusty, hilly little town\\", bounded to the North-East by Asaba which hosts the capital of the State, and Ogwashi- Uku to the West, North-West by Azagba, to the North by Okpanam, East by Okwe, South-East by Oko, South by Aballa and South-West by Olodu. However, Igbuzo is obviously lacking in terms of land mass, thus congested with houses. Historians believe that the Ibusa were the first to settle around the Asaba- Igbuzo-Ogwashi-Uku axis hence the other name of the town, Ibuzor (Were you the first to settle?) Ibusa is located with close proximity to busy towns such as Asaba, Ogwashi-Uku, Ubulu-Uku, Ilah, Ebu, Oko, Issele-Asagba and Okpanam. Thus, it is considered one of the fastest growing and developing Anioma (Delta North) towns and villages.  Education  There are important educational institutions in Ibusa which include Federal Government Girls' College, St. Augustine's College and Ibusa Girls Secondary school, Umejei Primary School formerly Sacred Heart Primary School, Ibusa founded in 1908. Ibusa boasts of some of the oldest schools in the southern part of the country. The once St. Thomas' Teachers' training College located founded and located in the town in 1928 was the oldest higher institution in Delta State as a whole.  Transport and trade The construction of an International Airport which will serve international purposes is currently going on in Asaba, Delta State, a town just about 6 miles from Ibusa and Ibusa will benefit immensely from the services of this transportation system, for now the town heavily relies on cabs and okada motorcycle taxis as mainstay of transportation. The major streets in Ibusa are Umejei Road, Kefas Road, Isieke High Street and Jerry Useni Road. The former houses almost all the banks in the town such as Union Bank of Nigeria Plc, Bank PHB, Umejei Micro-Finance Bank and NOPOV Micro- Finance Bank.  Ibusa in politics  Despite its many successes recorded in many aspects of national life, Ibusa is lagging behind in the area of politics. However, since 1960, Ibusa has produced four Ambassadors (Ambassador Uchuno (Late), Ignatius Olisemeka, Kehinde Olisemeka (late) and Okobi) while producing Senator Nosike Ikpo during the Second Republic who also was one of the founding leaders of Anioma Movement; a group pushing for the creation of Anioma State in then Bendel state alongside Late Chief Obi Obanua Nwaukor (The Odoziani 1 of Ibusa) and Late Chief W.U Ikolodo (Uwolo of Ibusa). Nonetheless, the town is beginning to record major successes in this area as Senator, Barr. Peter Onyeluka Nwoboshi an indigene of the town was the former chairman of People's Democratic Party, Delta State chapter and the current Senator representing Delta North at the National Assembly, Prof Patrick Utomi, the presidential flagbearer of African Democratic Congress also hails from Ibusa while the former Minority Leader of Delta State House of Assembly, Pat Ajudua is also a daughter of Igbuzo. Professor Fidelis Oditah, and Mr Peter Okocha also showed interest in the elections held in 2007, presenting their bids under different party platforms for the gubernatorial race of Delta State. Obi (Prof) Chike Onwuachi has also contested for the presidential election of the country. The 2011 gubernatorial elections in Nigeria saw the emergence of Paul Obanua the son of late Chief Obanua Nwaukor contesting under the platform of CDC for the office of the Governor Delta state. His candidacy was well received across the state. During the 2011 INEC registration exercise, Ibusa was reported as one of the towns with faulty DDC machines at some registration centers that could not be repaired by engineers but a supervisor with the Commission said that all hopes were not lost.  Taboos  The indigenous people of Igbuzo appear to have unexplainable special closeness, bond and love for themselves, which create a very high level of trust and relationship among them. This is reflected in the policies and ways of life of the natives; for instance, surrounding the house or any structure with fences in the town is forbidden. In the recent past, arresting a fellow Ibusa man or woman with the police was banned and only recently did the town reconsider and allow its natives to dispose of personal landed properties situated in the town to non- natives. Some natives of the town though still consider arresting fellow Ibusa natives with the police or resorting to the court of law for breaking a taboo. The reason being that the town was established by a family. The way of life in this town has been described as closely knit, a legacy that continues. The Igbuzo people refer to themselves singly as \\"Onye-Igbuzo,\\" \\"Nwa-Onye-Igbuzo- Isu\\" collectively as \\"Ndi-Igbuzo\\" and traditionally add the prefix \\"Nwa\\" before family-names, clans, Quarters as the case may be. It is also highly forbidden for an Igbuzo native to eat or come anywhere near \\"Eyi\\" (Rabbit), \\"Edi\\" (Hyena) Bringing the animals anywhere near an Igbuzo man or woman may also be taken as a serious slight, abuse of rights or an act to particularly undermine him/her. some Quarters of the town such as Umuekea and Ogbeowele may also forbid \\"Nmanya Nkwu\\" (Palm wine) perhaps because it is forbidden by the Oboshi stream.  Dispute in traditional leadership/Supreme Court ruling  Following a declaration in a letter by certain people who identified themselves as kingmakers to the government of Delta State, requesting that the approval and appointment of Professor Louis Chelunor Nwaoboshi be made as the Obuzor of Ibusa and staff of office given to him, the Delta state Government in a letter dated June 20, 1995 confirmed the appointment of Professor Louis Nwaoboshi as the Obuzor of Ibusa but this was soon protested against by Obi (Professor) Chike Onwuachi who would also commence a certiorari proceedings in which he asked the court to quash the declaration. He called on the state government to prevail on Nwoboshi to stop parading himself as the Obuzor of Ibusa, claiming that he was foisted on the people.This Day Newspaper, November 6, 2004 The Supreme Court in its judgment held that three Ruling Houses existed in the town in other of seniority as follows: Otu Odogwu, Otu Uwolo and Otu Iyase. Justice Samson Uwaifo in his leading judgment however declared that the Obuzor title of Igbuzo should rotate in other of seniority of the ruling houses. Thus, by Legal Notices numbers 6,7,8 and 9 of 1995 published in the Delta State of Nigeria, Extraordinary Gazette No.28 VoI. I 5 of June 1995, the Delta State Government stated the customary law regulating succession to the title of Obuzor of Igbuzo. Professor Nwaoboshi's appointment as the traditional Ruler of Igbuzo town in Delta state was consequently confirmed by the Supreme court ruling5 Though this has come to split the town, producing two separate camps with almost two distinct cultural differences and beliefs with each camp trying to champion, validate and make imposition of its course on the other. The members of these two distinct groups are today called \\"Otu Diokpa\\" (The Senior Diokpa Group)and \\"Otu Obuzor\\" The Obuzor Group). The members of Otu Diokpa have constantly maintained that the notion leading to the conception of the Obuzor title was merely to see such a candidate act as \\"Onu-Diokpa\\" (Messenger of the Senior Diokpa) The senior Diokpa was until the appointment and confirmation of the Obuzor the traditional head of the town. This controversy has remained unaddressed till today with both parties not wanting to shift grounds.  Modern Igbuzo life  In the United States in 2008, Nonyelum Nvene Ogbodo who represented Delta State as Miss Nigeria, announced her intention to take part in the adoption of the town of Ibusa. She pointed out the legacy of extreme pride in the importance of family by the people of Igbuzo, the annual local event that takes place in the town such as \\"Iwu Festival\\" as her reasons for doing so. She however, described Igbuzo as underdeveloped without administrative presence, mechanical energy or good roads that could contain multi-numbered vehicles for both incoming and outgoing traffic. She would seem determined to make adoption of Ibusa to lend a helping hand because of the great potentials that can be seen as far as development advancing goes and also help bring the Iwu Festival of the town to the attention of the world. Finally she submitted that \\"as technology advances and time progresses, it will be a matter of time until the village of Ibusa reaches a good level of its potentials. One day it could be a major attraction of greater area of Asaba, maybe even a capital village\\" In an article in This Day entitled \\"Ibusa: Millionaires paradise\\", 25 October 2008, Igbuzo was adjudged thus: \\"The quintessential millionaires' haven. This is reflected in the choice of mansions in the rustic community. Scattered around its rustic landscape are palatial mansions built by wealthy indigenes who earn their living from outside the town. In Ibusa, modern architectural masterpieces stand in sharp contrast with sun-baked mud homes adorned with rusty corrugated zinc roofs of less endowed relatives\\".\\"Ibusa: Nigeria's millionaires' paradise\\". Retrieved on 2008-11-17 The combination of ancient and modern interpiece in the town has also drawn comparison to poignant images in Wole Soyinka's poem \\"Ibadan\\". Ogbogu Okonji, Agility Okonji, Nwanze Nwabuwa (AKA Nwanze Nwagbodi) and Uche Nwalama are four of the greatest musicians of Ibusa extraction. However, Ogbogu Okonji by far remains the most prominent of them all.  Electricity In Ibusa  The community which is under the Benin Electricity Distribution Company's (BEDC) franchise areas has been experiencing a drought of electricity for about seven years now, culminating in the development of various conspiracy theories as to the reason for the outage. The residents of Ibusa have over time decried the power outage, constantly lamenting its negative effects on their lifestyle. The power outage was blamed on the fact that the town could not meet the revenue target of the power company (then NEPA) which led to them concentrating the power supply on the state capital and other major cities. As at December 2015, a contract was awarded by the state government to Kainene Olisa services for the rehabilitation of the electricity network of the Ibusa town. After which, electricity was restored, only for them to be plunged back into darkness again after two months. This happened, not surprisingly, because the residents couldn't pay their electricity bills. According to sources, the consumers who were connected legally were grossly overbilled for the cost of numerous illegally connected consumers. This story was covered on Sparkonline.com.ng on the 27th of February, 2017.  Ibusa Sports Club ISC)  The Ibusa Sports Club is the body responsible for the organization of Ibusa Annual Soccer event in the town and was founded in 1985 for this purpose. This football competition creates healthy rivalry among the ten Ogbes (Quarters) of the town destined to battle for the competition. This tournament is highly standard with the use of Nigerian Football Federation Graded Referees, Assistant Referees, Linesmen, match Commissioners and a team of three commentators. The tournament produces great talents from the town, and is \\"organized by the ever indefatigable and very patriotic Emmanuel Kwasa Amatokwu who has a perfect understanding of relationship with the youths\\" The 2008 edition of \\"Ibusa 2008\\" played at the Umejei Primary school was won by the Ekea Lions Fc of Umuekea who defeated the Odafe Bombers FC of Umuodafe 1-0, however, the Ogboli team were banned by the organizers of the competition for violently campaigning against a Referee's decision in a match they featured. The Umuodafe team won the 2009 edition of the competition. The Umuekea team would emerge winners with unbeaten runs, winning all their matches without conceding a single goal, thus setting a record which may stand for a very long time, considering the healthy rivalry the tournament usually holds for competitors. The 2007 edition of the tournament was won by the Bank PHB sponsored-Umueze team, which won the competition for the first time since the existence of the tournament. In the 2008 edition, the Umueze team failed to qualify beyond the group stage, losing to Umuekea and Umuodafe, two superior teams that would make it to the finals of the tournament. The Ogbeowele team have won the competition five times, 1985, 1989, 1991, 1992 and 1994. Umuekea five times, first in 1987, 1997, 1998, 2008 and 2010, Anyalaobum four times, in 1988, 1990, 1993 and 1996. Umuodafe has lifted the silverware a total of five times, 1995, 2001, 2004, 2006 and 2009. Ibusa has produced prominent footballers many of whom have featured for Nigeria, some of these players are Kingsley Obiekwe, the 1996 Atlanta Olympic Gold medalist in football, Elder Lawrence Okonji of Green Eagles now Super Eagles 1962 -1973, the late Peter Anieke of the Green Eagles, Emmanuel Olisadebe who naturalized and featured for Poland in 2002 and 2006 editions of the FIFA world Cup tournaments.  Notable natives of Ibusa  Igbuzo natives dressed in Akwa ocha (Otu-ogwu) at a funeral ceremony in the town Ibusa is the birthplace of many prominent personalities, preponderant intellectuals, men and women of tremendous financial means and individuals who have distinguished themselves in different walks of life mostly drawn from the academia, business, politics, music and sport and have contributed critically to national development. The town is credited with an intimidating number of professors, top civil servants, professionals and wealthy men and women. Professor Pat Utomi has attributed the reason for the stupendous achievements of Igbuzo's indigenous and successes to the advent of catholic missionaries in the community in 1898, and Ibusa traditional hard work ethic that promotes hard work over indulgence and inculcated in the youths though various traditional institutions play a vital role in the successes recorded by Igbuzo indigenes. He also believes that education has played important roles in the successes recorded by Igbuzo. (Obi) Prof Onwuachi on the hand believes that \\"wherever an Igbuzo man finds himself, he moves to be the best. Perhaps it is a spiritual compensation for its geographical deficiency\\"  References   External links  *Ibusa Home Town Category:Towns in Delta State ","title":"Igbuzo"},{"id":"17684013","text":"Prom on The Close is an open-air musical concert which was established in 2002.

Sometimes he is referred to as Anthony Luteyn.  Start of World War II  Luteyn was born at Batavia, Dutch East Indies. At the outbreak of World War II in the Netherlands, Luteyn was a cadet of the Royal Netherlands East Indies Army (Koninklijk Nederlands Indisch Leger, KNIL) at the Dutch military academy (Koninklijke Militaire Academie, KMA). After the capitulation of the Dutch armed forces, all officers and cadets were asked to give their word of honour not to harm German interests in any way as long as the Netherlands and Germany were at war. When they gave their word of honour they could go home and live relatively free. Luteyn refused, together with about 60 other officers, cadets and one rating of the Dutch navy (stoker Willem de Lange). The officers refusing did so for various reasons. Some did not give their word because they saw it as conflicting with their officer's oath. The majority of officers who didn't give their word of honour were officers of the Royal Netherlands East Indies Army, arguing that according to their regulations it was forbidden to give their word of honour and because the Dutch East Indies were still free at that time, they saw it as their duty to remain in the fight. All final year cadets were commissioned just before they were led into captivity. Luteyn was thus commissioned as a 2nd lieutenant of engineers in the Royal Netherlands East Indies Army. Because their commission was given hastily and without much ceremony they were dubbed \\"kasian lieutenant\\" (Malay for pity lieutenants).  Prisoner of war  Luteyn and all other Dutch officers and cadets who had refused to give their word of honour were thus led into captivity. On 16 July 1940 they were led to their first POW camp Soest Oflag VI A. From this camp the first Dutch escape attempt was made by lieutenant Hans Larive, Royal Netherlands Navy. Larive was caught at the Swiss border near Gottmadingen / Singen but this escape attempt proved to be vital for many future escapes. After Larive was caught, he was interrogated by a local Gestapo officer. In 1940, Germany was still in an overconfident mood, and the Gestapo officer told Larive where he went wrong and what he should have done to cross the border successfully. Many officers, including Larive himself and Luteyn, later used this information to cross the border successfully. In November 1940 the group was moved to Juliusburg Oflag VIII C in Amalienstift, an old convent. The convent was partly used as POW camp and part was still in use as an orphanage. From this camp the first successful escape was made by captain John Trebels and lieutenant Frans van der Veen, who also used the Gottmadingen‚ÄìSingen border crossing. As other officers were also busy with escape attempts which could interfere with each other, Captain Machiel van den Heuvel was appointed as escape officer.  Colditz  Colditz Castle, prison camp (1945) After the successful escape by Trebels and van der Veen, the Dutch officers were moved in July 1941 to the POW camp for \\"special prisoners\\", sonderlager Oflag IV-C Colditz. At this moment there were Polish, British, French and Belgian POWs in Colditz. Escape attempts before the Dutch arrived were made. Few were successful, amongst which were the escapes by French Lieutenants Pierre Mairesse Lebrun and Alain le Ray. In August and September 1941, only one month after arriving in Colditz, the Dutch could claim two successful escapes during which four Dutch officers (naval lieutenants Hans Larive and Flanti Steinmetz, major C. Giebel and 2nd Lieutenant O. Drijber) escaped to Switzerland. On 5 January 1942 Luteyn made his successful escape together with British lieutenant Airey Neave. Neave was the first British officer to make it back to Britain from Colditz. In December 1941 the British had discovered a way of escape for two officers dressed in German uniforms. From the third floor from the saalhouse and the theater they had made a hole in the floor which gave an entrance to the attic above the guardroom. As they needed an officer who could speak fluent German, the British asked the Dutch to work together. Luteyn and Airey Neave were teamed together and on January 5, 1942, after evening roll call, they were led to the saalhouse by British escape officer Pat Reid and Canadian Howard Wardle. Both prospective escapers were dressed in three sets of clothes - first civilian clothes, second German uniform, thirdly their own uniform. Through the hole under the theater they were led to a tower in which they could reach the stairs to the guardroom. The two escapers had to wait a few minutes so Reid and Wardle had time to return to the theater and camouflage all traces of this escape. Luteyn and Neave cleaned and checked their German uniforms and proceeded downstairs to the German guards. Several guards sprang to attention when \\"lieutenants\\" Luteyn and Neave passed them. They went to the park because passing the final guard at the gate required needed identification, which they didn't have. The park, however, was lightly guarded, and there they climbed the wall without many problems. After passing the wall they buried their German uniforms and went to Leisnig, where they took the early train to Leipzig. Targeting a cross into Switzerland via Hans Larive's Singen route, they had to wait for twelve hours before they could continue to Regensburg. To pass time they went to a local cinema. They reached Ulm through Regensburg and Augsburg; here they tried to buy a ticket to Engen, a village near Singen. The lady selling train tickets was suspicious and warned the local police. Luteyn and Neave were taken to the local police station and questioned. There they told their cover-story: as Dutchmen working for the Arbeitseinsatz. The police only half believed their story and brought them to the local Arbeitseinsatz building to check their story. In this building they escaped and walked 40 km to Biberach, where they took a train to Stockach, from which they could walk the final km to Singen. Travelling for three days and living on a few pieces of chocolate and sucking snowballs as drinking water, they got tired. They were discovered again by workers and fled and hid in an empty garden shack. Here they tried to sleep on a small bench. When they wanted to leave they discovered their shoes were frozen to the floor; they had to defrost them with their breath. They took a spade and axe to look like local workers. On the evening of the fourth day they reached the Swiss border. As a police car was checking the local border posts they could clearly see them. They picked their position and decided to cross the border running. They shook hands and wished each other luck. Running with bleeding blisters and falling and stumbling through snow-covered holes, they reached the village of Ramsen in Switzerland.  Post-escape  After his successful escape, Luteyn wrote to Captain van den Heuvel about his escape and where to look out, all in code obviously. He went to Suriname (a Dutch colony at that time) and went to Australia to join the remainder of the Dutch East Indies army there. For his successful escape, Luteyn was awarded the bronze cross in 1943. Airey Neave joined MI9 and became a famous member of parliament. After the successful escape by Luteyn and Neave, another British Dutch couple (Hyde Thompson and Donkers) tried to escape on 6 January 1942. They successfully got out of the castle but had the misfortune to get the same ticket-sales-lady as Luteyn and Neave in Ulm. They got arrested and were returned to Colditz.

Known in ancient times as Shunama and Shunem, it is first mentioned in the Amarna Letters in the 14th century BCE. Archaeological excavations in the village attest to habitation extending from the Bronze Age through to modern times. Located near Afula, it falls under the jurisdiction of Bustan al-Marj Regional Council. In it had a population of . In the Hebrew Bible Sulam has been identified with the biblical village of Shunem, which is said to be of the tribe of Issachar, the place where the Philistines camped before Saul's last battle,Tsafrir, Di Segni and Green, 1994, p. 236 and the native town of Abishag, King David's concubine in 1 Kings 1:3, and of the noble woman whose son was revived by the prophet Elisha in 2 Kings 4:8. History and archaeology The village of Sulam, from \\"Picturesque Palestine\\", 1880s.Wilson, 1881, 1884, p.31 The village of Sulam, pre-1914 Overview The village is situated on and around an archaeological tell (mound) and developed around the spring.Alexandre, 2008, Sulam The core of the village has been repeatedly destroyed and rebuilt. Settlement periods Various archaeological digs undertaken in Sulam have brought to light pottery and other remains from the Early and Middle Bronze Age, the Iron Age, and most of the following periods: Hellenistic (feebly represented), Roman, Byzantine, Early Muslim (findings from the 7th-10th centuries), Crusader, Mamluk, and Ottoman (17th-19th c. findings).Covello-Paran, 2006, SulamCovello-Paran, 2010, SulamHanna, 2008, SulamDalali-Amos, 14/2/2009, SulamDalali-Amos, 2/12/2009, SulamDalali-Amos, 05/12/2009, Sulam A hiatus in settlement between the 13th and 19th centuries was observed in one specific area of the tell north of the spring. Collapsed masonry from the end of the Crusader and beginning of the Mamluk period in the 13th century was documented on the tell. In December 2006 a trial excavation was undertaken on the southern slope of the tell, near the spring in the centre of the village, exposing four layers dated to the Early Islamic, Crusader, Mamluk and Ottoman periods. It uncovered potsherds from the Roman (3rd century), Byzantine, and Early Muslim periods, as well as various finds from the Crusader (12th century), Mamluk (13th‚Äì15th centuries), and Ottoman (17th‚Äì19th centuries) periods. Another excavation undertaken on the main street of the village and north of the spring at the end of 2007, uncovered building remains from the Early Islamic period (8th-10th centuries) and the late Ottoman period (19th century), as well as a burnt layer from the end of the Crusader and beginning of the Mamluk periods (12th‚Äì13th centuries). It also revealed potsherds from the Iron Age, Hellenistic, Byzantine and Roman periods. Remains discovered in the village include hiding complexes, tombs, and a church. Late and Middle Bronze Age In the Amarna letters, 14th century BCE clay tablets written in the cuneiform script of the Akkadian language, the village is listed under its ancient name of Shunama, as one of several cities conquered by the Canaanite warlord Lab'ayu in the Dothan Valley and southern Jezreel Valley.Goren et al., 2004, p. 262. A 2004 salvage excavation exposed Early Bronze Age remains including part of stone building and potsherds, covered by Roman period strata. Potsherds from the Middle Bronze Age were unearthed at a 2007 trial excavation. Iron Age A 2007 excavation discovered potsherds from the Iron Age. Roman and Early Byzantine periods Mentioned by the name Sulem in 4th century CE works, such as the Onomasticon of Eusebius, and by Jerome, both authors situate it 5 Roman miles from Tabor.Robinson and Smith, 1841, vol 3, pp.169-170 A 2004 salvage excavation unearthed Roman period remains including potsherds, coins, animal bones, and marble fragments. 3rd-century potsherds were uncovered in the 2006 trial dig. Late Byzantine‚ÄìEarly Muslim transition In 2007 an excavation exposed pottery sherds dated to either the Byzantine or the beginning of the Early Muslim period. At another dig, two coins were dated to shortly after the Byzantine period, one of which was an Arab-Byzantine coin (c. 640‚Äì660 CE) that imitates the coins of emperor Constans II. The 2006 trial excavation exposed a wall that was probably built before the Early Islamic period. Abbasid period A 2003 salvage excavation undertaken at the southern end of the village uncovered a tabun oven and fragments of pottery that were dated to the early Abbasid period. Crusader period The village was known to the Crusaders (12th century) under the name Suna. A thick burnt layer indicating prolonged activity with fire was exposed next to collapsed stone masonry and was dated to the end of the Crusader and beginning of the Mamluk period. The stratum of burnt earth and ashes has been exposed during various excavations on the tell and can be associated with prolonged activity at a kiln or oven. The 2006 trial excavation also came across a grey layer from the Crusader period. Mamluk period A wall and living space from the Mamluk period were uncovered during salvage excavations in a private home in August 2006. The December 2006 trial dig again uncovered building remains from the Mamluk period. Ottoman period During the Ottoman period, Sulam was listed in the tax registers of 1596 as being in the nahiya of Jinin in the liwa of Lajjun, with a population of 26 Muslim families. The villagers paid a fixed tax rate of 25% on various agricultural products, including wheat, barley, summecrops, goats and beehives in addition to\\"occasional revenues\\"; a total of 8,500 ak√ße.H√ºtteroth and Abdulfattah, 1977, p. 161. The 2006 trial excavation unearthed building remains from the Ottoman period: from the early phase (17th‚Äì18th centuries) mainly potsherds, but from the later phase (the beginning of the 19th century) a stone-paved open area yielding, apart from potsherds, a large number of animal bones, indicating an animal-related activity. Pierre Jacotin named the village Soulin on his map from 1799.Karmon, 1960, p. 169 Edward Robinson and Eli Smith, who visited the village in 1838, describe it as \\"small and dirty\\" and its inhabitants as \\"civil and friendly.\\" They also recount being approached by the Wely of Duhy who offered to take them to the shrine on the mountain which he said was often visited by monks. In 1882 the PEF's Survey of Western Palestine (SWP) describes Sulam as, \\"a large village, standing on a slope near the foot of Jebel ed Duhy [\\"Mountain of Duhy\\"]\\". It further notes that part of the village was built of stone, and that to the west there were shady gardens of lemon-trees. A perennial spring in the west collected in a stone trough was said to have good supply of clear water in September, 1872. What was described as a suburb of mud hovels ran southwards out from the village.Conder and Kitchener, 1882, SWP II, p. 87 British Mandate 1940s Survey of Palestine map of Sulam In the 1922 census of Palestine conducted by the British authorities, Suolam had a population of 370; 366 Muslims and 4 Christians,Barron, 1923, Table XI, Sub- district of Nazareth, p. 38 decreasing in the 1931 census to 328, all Muslim, in a total of 85 houses.Mills, 1932, p. 76 In the 1945 statistics the population was 470, all Muslims,Government of Palestine, Department of Statistics, 1945, p. 8 while the total land area was 3,605 dunams, according to an official land and population survey.Government of Palestine, Department of Statistics.

Career  Carl Braun studied in Vienna from 1841 and, in 1847, took the position of Sekundararzt (assistant doctor) in the Vienna General Hospital. In 1849 he succeeded Ignaz Semmelweis as assistant to professor Johann Klein at the hospital's first maternity clinic, a position he held until 1853. In 1853, after Braun became a Privatdozent, he was appointed ordinary professor of obstetrics in Trient and vice-director of the Tiroler Landes-Geb√§r- und Findelanstalt. In November 1856 he was called to Vienna to succeed Johann Klein as professor of obstetrics. On Braun's recommendation, the hospital's first gynaecology clinic was created in 1858, under his direction.This section almost entirely from Biographisches Lexikon ...

These results suggest that Braun continued, assiduously, to require hand disinfection before attending women and did not let mortality return to the high levels before Semmelweis introduced the chlorine washings.

He had another son, James, who was an officer in the 133rd (Fraser's) Foot, and became baronet on his elder brother's death. His third son John, also became baronet, on the death of his brother James. Erskine joined his father‚Äôs regiment the 7th Dragoons in 1742 and served in the War of the Austrian Succession, seeing action at the Battle of Fontenoy, then in the Seven Years' War. By March 1759 he was in Germany with the rank of Major in the 15th Light Dragoons, and was promoted Lieutenant-Colonel commanding the same regiment in 1762. Erskine performed exceptionally on the field at the Battle of Emsdorf and was able to present King George III with 16 colors captured by his regiment. For his prowess, Erskine was knighted.

In 1777 he was Quartermaster-General to Lord Cornwallis. Erskine is credited with advising Cornwallis on the occasion of the Battle of the Assunpink Creek (also known as 'Five Mile Run') not to put off attacking the Continental Army on the night of 2 January 1777.At Five Mile Run he advised Cornwallis to attack in the night to prevent Washington‚Äôs escape, but was unfortunately overridden by the ill advice of Grant. Cornwallis agreed with Grant \\"‚ÄòAt last we have run down the old fox‚Ä¶ and we will bag him in the morning.‚Äô Erskine could not believe what he heard and could not hold himself back.

Erskine was made Colonel of the 80th Foot on 4 March 1777. Now a Brigadier-General, Erskine accompanied British forces as second in command under General William Tryon with the assistance of General James Agnew on an inland raid against Patriot supply depots in Danbury, Connecticut. After successfully destroying Patriot supplies, the British forces engaged and defeated Continental Army Generals David Wooster, Benedict Arnold, and Gold S. Silliman and Patriot militiamen in the Battle of Ridgefield. Erskine served in the Philadelphia campaign and then, following Sir William Howe's resignation in 1778, continued as Quartermaster-General under Henry Clinton. Erskine went on to lead troops at the Battle of Monmouth and after that campaign was given command of the eastern district of Long Island. Erskine's last active duty in North America was commanding five infantry battalions and a cavalry squadron in pursuit of the Continental Army which was thought to be moving to Virginia in November 1778.

Case of Alberto Martinez Colonel Parrish presided over the case of Staff Sergeant Alberto Martinez, a GI who was accused of murdering two officers with a grenade. Guantanamo assignment On May 29, 2008 Colonel Peter Brownback, the Presiding Officer over Omar Khadr's Guantanamo military commission was removed, and Parrish was appointed to take his place. Brownback's replacement was described as \\"surprising\\". Lieutenant Commander William Keubler, one of Khadr's Defense attorneys, speculated that Brownback's unexpected replacement was due to his insistence that the Prosecution complete the process of discovery, before he set a trial date. On Thursday September 4, 2008 Parrish barred the 2nd in command at the Office of Military Commissions, Brigadier General Thomas W. Hartmann, from participating in Khadr's Tribunal because of his \\"undue command influence\\". Khadr's Tribunal is the third that Hartmann has been barred from participating in. Parrish's Guantanamo hitch, under the Obama administration President Barack Obama issued executive orders following his inauguration. He ordered the Guantanamo commissions to be suspended, while his own team could assess whether they should be preserved, modified, or closed. James Pohl, another Presiding Officer, took the position that the President didn't have the authority to order him to suspend the commissions. But Parrish complied. A dispute arose between Khadr's lead Defense Counsel, William Keubler, and Peter Masciola, the new Chief Defense Counsel. He told Keubler he was fired, because he was not obeying orders. He locked him out of his office, and stopped his access to Khadr, and to the case file. Keubler said the dispute arose because Masciola wanted to continue to play a role in modified commissions, moved to the continental United States, while Keubler wanted to see the charges against Khadr dropped, and see him repatriated to a kind of parole‚Äîrehabilitation program in Canada. Parrish ruled that the rules of the Guantanamo commission system did not give Masciola the authority to fire Keubler. He ruled that only a Presiding Officer could order a defense counsel's replacement. In late May Parrish scheduled a hearing for June 1, 2009‚Äîeven though Obama's suspension was still in effect, to consider the issue of whether Keubler should be allowed to continue to represent Khadr.

In the beginning they produced small vignette shows (lasting 1‚Äì2 minutes) including: Celebrity Talk, color of success, Dollars and cents, The Flip Side, Modern Rock Minute, Teen Tips, Travel Notes, Fastbreak, Outdoor Tips, Sports memories, Teein' it up, and Flashback. As well as a few longer shows like Dance Mix America, Big Band Classics, The country Oldies Show, Trivia Coast-to-Coast, and The Golden Age of Radio. The network also carried personality shows like the Liz Wilde Show, one of the few female shock jocks, The Rick Emerson Show, Snoop Dogg and Shadoe Stevens as well as music programming such as Nina Blackwoods Absolutely 80's, and World Atomic Rhythm Parties. The company also produced programming for the Hispanic radio market. The company's principal source of revenue was selling radio time to advertisers. In a typical relationship for a one-hour show provided by the Company, a radio station agreed to provide them with one 60-second advertising spot each time a show was broadcast. Other revenue sources included subscription services, where customers would receive daily faxes and emails containing show prep sheets. Another alternative revenue source was the development and sale of preferred listener tracking software (PLP) to stations like KSL (radio). This eventually resulted in the creation of its wholly owned subsidiary NBG Solutions. On February 12, 2003, NBG Radio Network announced that its lenders had foreclosed on all its assets due to missed payments. The company had run up a large debt mostly due to its acquisition of Fischer Entertainment and its lineup of FM talk oriented programming in 2001. NBG's assets were transferred to the bank owned Crystal Media Network. Several of NBG's programs are still on the air on other networks. Golden Age of Radio is now on USA Radio Network; Blackwood's programs are now at United Stations Radio Networks. The Country Oldies Show continues to air as a self-syndicated program, mostly on rural stations. Its most listened-to show, The Bo Reynolds Show which broadcast for five hours on Saturday nights reached over 150 Stations Nationwide.

Early Christians The paintings in the catacombs permit the belief that the early Christians simply followed the fashion of their time. The short hair of the men and the braids of the women were, towards the end of the second century, curled, and arranged in tiers, while for women the hair twined about the head over the brow. Particular locks were reserved to fall over the forehead and upon the temples. Christian iconography still proceeds in accordance with types created in the beginning of Christianity. Images of Christ retain the long braided locks parted in the middle and flowing to the shoulders. Those of the Blessed Virgin still wear the veil which conceals a portion of the brow and confines the neck. The Orantes, which represent the generality of the faithful, have the hair covered by a full veil which falls to the shoulders. Byzantine iconography differs little as to head-dress from that of the catacombs. Mosaics and ivories portray emperors, bishops, priests and the faithful wearing the hair of a medium length, cut squarely across the forehead. Women then wore a round head-dress which encircled the face. Emperors and empresses wore a large, low crown, wide at the top, ornamented with precious stones cut en cabochon, and jeweled pendants falling down to the shoulders, such as may be seen in the mosaics of S. Vitalis at Ravenna and a large number of diptychs. The hair of patriarchs and bishops was of medium length and was surmounted by a closed crown or a double tiara. Middle Ages The invading barbarians allowed their hair to grow freely, and to fall unrestrained on the shoulders. After the fall of the Merovingians, and while the invaders were conforming more and more to the prevailing Byzantine taste or fashion, they did not immediately take up the fashion of cutting the hair. Carloman, the brother of Charlemagne, is represented at the age of fourteen with his hair falling in long locked tresses behind. Church councils regulated the head-dress of clerics and monks: according to St. Jerome's testimony, the monks were bearded, and the Vita Hilarionis also states that certain persons considered it meritorious to cut hair each year at Easter. The Statuta antiqua Ecclesiae (can. xliv) forbade them to allow hair or beard to grow. A synod held by St. Patrick (can. vi) in 456 prescribed that the clerics should dress their hair in the manner of the Roman clerics, and those who allowed their hair to grow were expelled from the Church (can. x). The Council of Agde (506) authorized the archdeacon to employ force in cutting the hair of recalcitrants; the Council of Braga (572) ordained that the hair should be short, and the ears exposed. The Fourth Council of Toledo (633) denounced the lectors in Galicia who wore a small tonsure and allowed the hair to grow immoderately, and two Councils of Rome (721 and 743) anathematized those who should neglect the regulations in this matter. In the ninth century there is more distinction between freemen and slaves, as regards the hair. Henceforth the slaves were no longer shorn save in punishment for certain offences. Under Louis the D√©bonnaire and Charles the Bald the hair was cut on the temples and the back of the head. In the tenth century the hair cut at the height of the ears fell regularly about the head. At the end of twelfth century the hair was shaven close on the top of the head and fell in long curls behind. Fashions changed, from hair smooth on the top of the head and rising in a sudden roll in front, a tuft of hair in the form of a flame, or the more ordinary topknot. Not every one followed these fashions. Early Modern times The clergy followed with a sort of timidity the fashion of the wig, but, except prelates and court chaplains, they refrained from the over-luxurious models. Priests contented themselves with wearing the wig in folio, or square, or the wig √† la Sartine. They bared the part corresponding to the tonsure. In the religious orders, the tonsure very early interposed an obstacle to hairstyles, but the tonsure itself was the occasion of many combinations.

Significance and demise Faithful to the philosophy and principles of his mentor Anton Josef Rechberger, Professor Bo√´r represented the conservative trend in obstetrics for which he was an outstanding advocate.

In May 2019, a court in Utrecht issued a verdict that made the Netherlands the first country to completely ban the Hells Angels; other countries such as Germany had banned local chapters, but never before the entire club. The United States Department of Justice considers the club to be an organized crime syndicate. In the United States and Canada, the Hells Angels are incorporated as the Hells Angels Motorcycle Corporation. Common nicknames for the club are the \\"H.A.\\", \\"Red & White\\", \\"HAMC\\", and \\"81\\".\\"81\\" is a metonym. As 'H' and 'A' are the 8th and 1st letter of the alphabet. History The Hells Angels originated on March 17, 1948 in Fontana, California, when several small motorcycle clubs agreed to merge.The Secret Life of Bikers by Jerry Langton. Location 19.5/477. HarperCollings:2018 According to the Hells Angels' website, the received suggestion is unfounded that the former troops to join the club included misfits and malcontents. The website also notes that the name was first suggested by an associate of the founders named Arvid Olsen, who had served in the \\"Hell's Angels\\" squadron of the Flying Tigers in China during World War II. It is at least clear that the name was inspired by the tradition from World Wars I and II whereby the Americans gave their squadrons fierce, death-defying titles; an example of this lies in one of the three P-40 squadrons of Flying Tigers fielded in Burma and China, which was dubbed \\"Hell's Angels\\". In 1930, the Howard Hughes film Hell's Angels showcased extraordinary and dangerous feats of aviation, and it is believed that the World War II groups who used that name based it on the film. According to the Hells Angels' website, they are aware that there is an apostrophe missing in \\"Hell's\\", but state that, \\"...it is you who miss it. We don't\\".Hells Angels FAQ Howard Hughes movie about World War I fighter pilots.Bishop, Cliff T. (1986). Fortresses of the Big Triangle First, East Anglia Books. , pp.160, 236. Some of the early history of the HAMC is not clear, and accounts differ. According to Ralph \\"Sonny\\" Barger, founder of the Oakland charter, early charters of the club were founded in San Francisco, Gardena, Fontana, Oakland and elsewhere, with the members usually being unaware that there were other clubs. One of the lesser-known clubs existed in North Chino/South Pomona, in the late 1960s. Other sources claim that the Hells Angels in San Francisco were organized in 1953 by Rocky Graves, a Hells Angel member from San Bernardino (\\"Berdoo\\"), implying that the \\"Frisco\\" Hells Angels were very much aware of their forebears.Birney Jarvis for Male magazine, 1964. Reprinted in Hells Angels by Hunter S. Thompson The \\"Frisco\\" Hells Angels were reorganized in 1955 with thirteen charter members, Frank Sadilek serving as president, and using the smaller, original logo. The Oakland charter, at the time headed by Barger, used a larger version of the \\"Death's Head\\" patch nicknamed the \\"Barger Larger\\", which was first used in 1959. It later became the club standard. The Hells Angels are often depicted in semi-mythical romantic fashion like the 19th-century James‚ÄìYounger Gang: free-spirited, iconic, bound by brotherhood and loyalty. At other times, such as in the 1966 Roger Corman film The Wild Angels, they are depicted as violent and nihilistic, little more than a violent criminal gang and a scourge on society. The club became prominent within, and established its notoriety as part of the 1960s counterculture movement in San Francisco's Haight-Ashbury District, playing a part at many of the movement's seminal events. Members were directly connected to many of the counterculture's primary leaders, such as Ken Kesey and the Merry Pranksters, Allen Ginsberg, Jerry Garcia and the Grateful Dead, Timothy Leary, The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, Mick Farren, and Tom Wolfe. Writing a book about the club launched the career of \\"Gonzo\\" journalist Hunter S. Thompson.Hell's Angels and the Illusion of the Counterculture; Wood, John. 30 Sept 2003. The Journal of Popular Culture, Volume 3The Haight-Ashbury: A History; Perry, Charles. 2005 In 1973, members from several branches of the organization protested at an Environmental Protection Agency hearing about a proposed transportation plan that included restrictions on motorcycle use and sales to get California to meet the new Clean Air Act standards.\\"Early Implementation of the Clean Air Act of 1970 in California\\". EPA Alumni Association. Video, Transcript (see p. 14). July 12, 2016. Criminal activities and incidents Some United States agencies classify the Hells Angels as one of the \\"big four\\" motorcycle clubs, along with the Pagans, Outlaws, and Bandidos, and contend that members carry out widespread violent crime and organized crime, including drug dealing, trafficking in stolen goods, and extortion, and are involved in prostitution. Members of the organization have continuously asserted that they are only a group of motorcycle enthusiasts who have joined to ride motorcycles together, to organize social events such as group road trips, fundraisers, parties, and motorcycle rallies, and that any crimes are the responsibility of the individuals who carried them out and not the club as a whole. On May 29, 2019, the Hells Angels were banned in the Netherlands. This is the first country in the world to outlaw the entire club. The presiding judge of the court in Utrecht called it \\"a danger to public order and the rule of law\\". Insignia Insignia of the Hells Angels from Karlsruhe charter, with the '1%' patch The Hells Angels' official website attributes the official \\"death's head\\" insignia design to Frank Sadilek, past president of the San Francisco charter. The colors and shape of the early-style jacket emblem (prior to 1953) were copied from the insignias of the 85th Fighter Squadron and the 552nd Medium Bomber Squadron. The Hells Angels utilize a system of patches similar to military medals. Although the specific meaning of each patch is not publicly known, the patches identify specific or significant actions or beliefs of each biker.Gangs; A Journey into the heart of the British Underworld, Tony Thompson, (2004) The official colors of the Hells Angels are red lettering displayed on a white background‚Äîhence the club's nickname \\"The Red and White\\". These patches are worn on leather or denim jackets and vests. Red and white are also used to display the number 81 on many patches, as in \\"Support 81, Route 81\\". The 8 and 1 stand for the respective positions in the alphabet of H and A. These are used by friends and supporters of the club in deference to club rules, which purport to restrict the wearing of Hells Angels imagery to club members. The diamond-shaped one-percenter patch is also used, displaying '1%' in red on a white background with a red merrowed border. The term one- percenter is said to be a response to the American Motorcyclist Association (AMA) comment on the Hollister incident, to the effect that 99% of motorcyclists were law-abiding citizens and the last 1% were outlaws. The AMA has no record of such a statement to the press, and calls this story apocryphal. New York Hells Angels patch Most members wear a rectangular patch (again, white background with red letters and a red merrowed border) identifying their respective charter locations. Another similarly designed patch reads \\"Hells Angels\\". When applicable, members of the club wear a patch denoting their position or rank within the organization. The patch is rectangular and, similar to the patches described above, displays a white background with red letters and a red merrowed border. Some examples of the titles used are President, Vice President, Secretary, Treasurer, and Sergeant at Arms. This patch is usually worn above the 'club location' patch. Some members also wear a patch with the initials \\"AFFA\\", which stands for \\"Angels Forever; Forever Angels\\", referring to their lifelong membership in the biker club (i.e., \\"once a member, always a member\\"). The book Gangs, written by Tony Thompson (a crime correspondent for The Observer), states that Stephen Cunningham, a member of the Angels, sported a new patch after he recovered from attempting to set a bomb, consisting of two Nazi-style SS lightning bolts below the words 'Filthy Few'. Some law enforcement officials claim that the patch is only awarded to those who have committed or are prepared to commit murder on behalf of the club. According to a report from the R. v. Bonner and Lindsay case in 2005 (see related section below), another patch, similar to the 'Filthy Few' patch is the 'Dequiallo' patch. This patch \\"signifies that the wearer has fought law enforcement on arrest.\\"HAMC Overview Document, Overview of the Hell's Angel's Motorcycle Club (HAMC) In Canada There is no common convention as to where the patches are located on the members' jacket/vest. Intellectual property rights According to The Globe and Mail the Hells Angels considered seeking an injunction to block the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation from broadcasting the miniseries The Last Chapter, because of how closely the biker gang at the center of the series resembled the Hells Angels. In March 2007 the Hells Angels filed suit against the Walt Disney Motion Pictures Group alleging that the film entitled Wild Hogs used both the name and distinctive logo of the Hells Angels Motorcycle Corporation without permission.'Litigation against movie release' (March 8, 2006) and they rule., HAMC vs Walt Disney The suit was eventually voluntarily dismissed, after the Angels received assurances from Disney that the references would not appear in the film. On October 7, 2009, Fritz Clapp, attorney at law for the Hells Angels Motorcycle Corporation, contacted online games community FOCO, demanding the removal of all membership marks and club trademarks from the Los Santos Roleplay Forum. While the members of the community were skeptical at first, Fritz Clapp posted a tweet confirming his identity. In October 2010 the Hells Angels filed a lawsuit against Alexander McQueen for \\"misusing its trademark winged death heads symbol\\" in several items from its Autumn/Winter 2010 collection. The lawsuit is also aimed at Saks Fifth Avenue and Zappos.com, which stock the jacquard box dress and knuckle duster ring that bear the symbol, which has been used since at least 1948 and is protected by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. A handbag and scarf was also named in lawsuit. The lawyer representing Hells Angels claimed: \\"This isn't just about money, it's about membership. If you've got one of these rings on, a member might get really upset that you're an impostor.\\" Saks refused to comment, Zappos had no immediate comment and the company's parent company, PPR, could not be reached for comment. The company settled the case with the Hells Angels after agreeing to remove all of the merchandise featuring the logo from sale on their website, stores and concessions and recalling any of the goods that have already been sold and destroying them. In fall 2012 in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of California, Hells Angels sued Toys \\"R\\" Us for trademark infringement, unfair competition, and dilution in relation to the sale of yo-yos manufactured by Yomega Corporation, a co- defendant, which allegedly bear the \\"Death Head\\" logo. In its complaint, Hells Angels asserted that the mark used on the yo-yos is likely to confuse the public into mistakenly believing that the toys originate with Hells Angels and Yomega filed counterclaims against Hells Angels for cancellation of the \\"Death Head\\" registrations on grounds of alleged fraud in the procurement of the registrations. The case settled and the lawsuit was dismissed with prejudice. , the Hells Angels sells its branded merchandise at a retail store in Toronto, Canada. Membership A club member at a biker gathering in Australia, 2008 In order to become a Hells Angels prospect, candidates must have a valid driver's license, a motorcycle over 750cc, and have the right combination of personal qualities. It is said the club excludes child molesters and individuals who have applied to become police or prison officers. After a lengthy, phased process, a prospective member is first deemed to be a \\"hang- around\\", indicating that the individual is invited to some club events or to meet club members at known gathering places. If the hang-around is interested, he may be asked to become an \\"associate\\", a status that usually lasts a year or two. At the end of that stage, he is reclassified as \\"prospect\\", participating in some club activities, but not having voting privileges while he is evaluated for suitability as a full member. The last phase, and highest membership status, is \\"Full Membership\\" or \\"Full-Patch\\".NDIC Document, US Department of Justice Report on OMG HA The term \\"Full-Patch\\" refers to the complete four-piece insignia, including the \\"Death Head\\" logo, two rockers (top rocker: \\"Hells Angels\\"; bottom rocker: state or territory claimed) and the rectangular \\"MC\\" patch below the wing of the Death's Head. Prospects are allowed to wear only a bottom rocker with the state or territory name along with the rectangular \\"MC\\" patch. Hells Angels clubhouse in Oakland, California To become a full member, the prospect must be voted on unanimously by the rest of the full club members. Prior to votes being cast, a prospect usually travels to every charter in the sponsoring charter's geographic jurisdiction (state/province/territory) and introduces himself to every Full-Patch member. This process allows each voting member to become familiar with the subject and to ask any questions of concern prior to the vote. Some form of formal induction follows, wherein the prospect affirms his loyalty to the club and its members. The final logo patch (top \\"Hells Angels\\" rocker) is then awarded at this initiation ceremony. The step of attaining full membership can be referred to as \\"being patched\\". Even after a member is patched in, the patches themselves remain the property of HAMC rather than the member. On leaving the Hells Angels, or being ejected, they must be returned to the club.A Wayward Angel: The Full Story of the Hells Angels by George Wethern and Vincent Colnett Worldwide charters East Village neighborhood of Manhattan, New York City The HAMC acknowledges more than a hundred charters spread over 29 countries. The Hells Angels motorcycle club founded a charter in Auckland, New Zealand, in 1961 and has since taken over gangs in Wanganui. New Zealand had the first charter of the Hells Angels outside the United States.Kemp, p 50 Europe did not become widely home to the Hells Angels until 1969 when two London charters were formed. The Beatles' George Harrison invited some members of the HAMC San Francisco to stay at Apple Records in London in 1968.Pg. 129, Rock Scully, David Dalton, \\"Living with the Dead: Twenty Years on the Bus with Garcia and the Grateful Dead\\", Cooper Square Publ Inc, 2001 According to Chris O'Dell, only two members showed up at Apple Records, Frisco Pete and Bill \\"Sweet William\\" Fritsch. Two people from London visited California, \\"prospected\\", and ultimately joined. Two charters were issued on July 30, 1969; one for \\"South London\\"‚Äîthe re-imagined charter renewing the already existing 1950 South London charter‚Äîand the other for \\"East London\\", but by 1973 the two charters came together as one, called \\"London\\". The London Angels provided security at a number of UK Underground festivals including Phun City in 1970 organized by Mick Farren. They awarded Farren an \\"approval patch\\" in 1970 for use on his first solo album Mona, which also featured Steve Peregrin Took (who was credited as \\"Shagrat the Vagrant\\"). In the 1980s and 1990s, there was a major expansion of the club into Canada. The Quebec Biker war was a violent turf war that began in 1994 and continued until late 2002 in Montreal. The war began as the Hells Angels in Quebec began to make a push to establish a monopoly on street-level drug sales in the province. A number of drug dealers and crime families resisted and established groups such as the \\"Alliance to fight the Angels\\". The war resulted in the bombings of many establishments and murders on both sides. It has claimed more than 150 lives and led to the incarceration of over 100 bikers. Members of the Spanish Charter were involved in a killing and tried. A list of acknowledged charters can be found on the HAMC's official website. Racial policies The club is not officially a racially segregated organization. 2003 Soul on Bikes: The East Bay Dragons MC and Black Biker Set, Tobie Gene Levingston, with Keith and Kent Zimmerman (St. Paul, MN: Motorbikes International Publishing). The history of the Oakland-based African-American Motorcycle Club with a foreword from Sonny Barger. In the United States, at least one charter allegedly requires that a candidate be a white male, and Sonny Barger stated in a BBC interview in 2000 that \\"The club, as a whole, is not racist but we probably have enough racist members that no black guy is going to get in it.\\" At that time the club had no black members. Outside the United States, non-white membership is relatively common and some chapters, such as in Turkey and South America, are almost exclusively non-white. Notable is Gregory Woolley, a high- ranking member of the Rockers MC in Montreal who was the prot√©g√© and bodyguard of Hells Angel boss Maurice Boucher (who spent five years in a notoriously white-supremacist motorcycle gang, the SS). Woolley became an associate of the Hells Angels Montreal charter in the 1990s and later tried uniting street gangs in Quebec after Boucher was imprisoned. In another interview with leader Sonny Barger in 2000 he remarked \\"if you're a motorcycle rider and you're white, you want to join the Hell's Angels. If you black, you want to join the Dragons. That's how it is whether anyone likes it or not. We don't have no blacks and they don't have no whites.\\" When asked if that could change Barger replied \\"Anything can change, I can't predict the future.\\" Tobie Levingston who formed the black motorcycle club East Bay Dragons MC wrote in his book that he and Sonny Barger have a long-lasting friendship and that the Hells Angels and Dragons have a mutual friendship and hang out and ride together. In a 1966 article about motorcycle rebels in the African-American community magazine Ebony, the Chosen Few MC stated that they see no racial animosity in the Hells Angels and that when they come into Chosen Few territory they all get together and just party. A Hells Angel member interviewed for the magazine insisted there was no racial prejudice in any of their clubs and stated \\"we don't have any negro members\\" but maintained there have not been any blacks who have sought membership. At one point in the 1970s the Hells Angels were looking to consolidate the different motorcycle clubs and offered every member of the Chosen Few MC a Hells Angel badge, but the Chosen Few turned down the offer.

He served as Minister of Culture from 2008 to 2011, in the Berlusconi IV Cabinet. Biography Bondi was born in Fivizzano, province of Massa-Carrara, Italy. He first attended school at Lausanne, where his emigrant father had settled. The family later returned to Italy and at a young age Sandro joined the Italian Communist Youth Federation, soon becoming its secretary in Lunigiana. He gained a laurea in philosophy from the University of Pisa with a dissertation on Leonardo Valazzana, precursor of the Augustinian order and opponent of Girolamo Savonarola. A Catholic democrat, he campaigned for the Italian Communist Party, and was elected mayor of Fivizzano in 1990. In 1992 the town council led by him was overturned by the local Socialist Party, in association with Christian Democracy. Activists already playfully compared him to a ravanello (radish): that is, red on the outside but white on the inside. Following these events he left the PCI. Subsequently getting to know Silvio Berlusconi via the sculptor Pietro Cascella, he became Berlusconi's secretary, collaborator and faithful advisor, so much so that - for Berlusconi's 2001 campaign - he was given the task of quickly coordinating the compilation of Una storia italiana (An Italian Story), a book of photographs on Berlusconi's public and private life, as electoral propaganda for future elections (as used by all Italian families). Bondi returned the great trust accorded him by Berlusconi by over the years becoming one of his main supporters, publicly proclaiming his devotion and fidelity to him on several occasions,http://www.corriere.it/Primo_Piano/Politica/2006/10_Ottobre/15/stella.shtml as well as in poems he composed and read on television programmes, which were a major target for his critics and for satirists. In the 2001 general election he was elected to the Chamber of Deputies for Berlusconi's Forza Italia party in the III circoscrizione (Lombardia 1). In the campaign for the 2005 regional elections he organised the party's communications and was the same year named the party's coordinator. In the 2006 general election he was re-elected to the Chamber, elected from the results of circoscrizione XX (Campania 2). In the meantime he collaborated with Vanity Fair on a poetry page. In summer 2006 he published his latest sayings under the title \\"Laici e credenti: una fede comune\\". In the course of the 2008 general election he participated in hustings in several Italian towns, as well as one in teatro Fenaroli in the city of Lanciano, where he declared that he did not wish to leave Berlusconi alone in government, as had been done in the past, thus leaving an invitation for all to lean on and encourage him. In the 2008 election, he was a People of Freedom candidate for Senate for the Tuscany region, as well as a centre-right candidate for president of the Province of Massa-Carrara. He was elected to the Senate, and he reached the second ballot for the provincial presidency with Osvaldo Angeli (candidate for the centre-left Democratic Party), which Angeli then won with 55.4% of the vote, against Bondi's 46%. In 2008 he was made Culture minister in the Berlusconi IV Cabinet, relinquishing his post as national co-ordinator of Forza Italia to Denis Verdini. During his tenure of the ministry he announced the appointment of a special commissioner for the ruins at Pompeii and was censured for criticising modern art and architecture.
