It was built in 1895 by University President Seth Low as the University's central library. Financed with $1 million of Low's own money due to a lack of funds from alumni (a recurring problem throughout the university's history), he named it in memory of his father, Abiel Abbot Low. It has housed the central administrative offices of the university following the completion of the Butler Library in 1934, and is the focal point and most prominent building on the university's Morningside Heights campus. The steps leading to the library's columned facade are a popular meeting place for Columbia students as well as home to Daniel Chester French's sculpture, Alma Mater, a university symbol. Low Library was officially named a New York City landmark in 1967, with the interior being designated in 1981, then a National Historic Landmark twenty years later. Architecture Low Library was designed by Charles Follen McKim of the architectural firm of McKim, Mead, and White, which was responsible for the design of much of Columbia's Morningside Heights campus. The library was designed in the neo-classical style, incorporating many of the elements of Rome's Pantheon. The building is in the shape of a Greek cross and features windows modeled on those of the Baths of Diocletian. The columns on the library's front facade are in the Ionic order, suited to institutions of arts and letters. An inscription on the building's attic describes the history of the university. It reads: > King's College Founded in the Province of New York > By Royal Charter in the Reign of George II > Perpetuated as Columbia College by the People of the State of New York > When they became Free and Independent - Maintained and Cherished from > Generation to Generation > For the Advancement of the Public Good and the Glory of Almighty God Low Library elevation, from the upper stories of Butler Library. The interior abounds with classical references. At the entryway are bronze busts of Zeus and Apollo. The foyer contains a white marble bust of Pallas Athena, modeled after the Minerve du Collier at the Louvre and donated by Jonathan Ackerman Coles of the Columbia College Class of 1864, an alumnus of Columbia's Philolexian Society. She is surrounded by the twelve signs of the zodiac. The rotunda, formerly the library reading room when the building was used for its original function, is lined with columns of solid green Connemara marble from Ireland, topped with gold capitals. Roman and Greek philosophers Demosthenes, Euripides, Sophocles, and Augustus Caesar stare down from the rotunda's heights as the four points of knowledge, Law, Philosophy, Medicine, and Theology, mark the four points of the Greek Cross. The rest of the interior is finished with Italian and Istrian marble. A late 19th-century real estate magazine, believing Low to be patterned after a French church by \\"the architect Rumpf\\", criticised the design, writing that \\"there is scarcely any original designing done in this city, except the vagaries of the incompetent. The rest is mostly a copybook reproduction of classical and other detail. Successful architects have too much to do to be pre-eminently artists -- they must be first-rate men of business.\\"Gray, Christopher \\"Streetscapes: Morningside Heights: The Library That Crowned Columbia's Move North\\". The New York Times (February 17, 2002) History Low Library c. 1900 Low was the first building on Columbia's new Morningside campus when it was built in 1895 on the site of crop fields and the Bloomingdale Insane Asylum. Low originally served as the university's main library until 1934 when it was supplanted by the larger Butler Library. After a period during which it still housed the university's archives, the building now consists almost solely of administrative offices. However, the building's facade is still etched with the words \\"The Library of Columbia University,\\" leading many to mistakenly believe that it retains its earlier role. During the 1968 Columbia protests, Low was occupied by students objecting to, among other things, the proposed construction of a university-owned gymnasium in Morningside Park, as well as Columbia's involvement with the Vietnam War. Within Low, the students barricaded themselves inside the office of University President Grayson L. Kirk, where they searched for documents. Dramatic scenes ensued, including attempts to catapult food to the protesters and efforts by their adversaries to cordon them off. The access of Columbia media outlets such as WKCR and the Columbia Daily Spectator, allowing them to break stories relating to the events in Low prior to national news organizations, remains a mystery; many believe students had access to secret tunnels. The protesters were only removed after a controversially violent assault on the building by the New York Police Department. In 1954 during the University's bicentennial and following the election in 1952 of former Columbia University president General Dwight D. Eisenhower to the US presidency, Low Library was commemorated on a postage stamp. For the University's semiquincentennial in 2004, an image of the library was placed on a pre-stamped postcard.Nix, Larry T. (2002). \\"Low Memorial Library Postal Card\\" . my.execpc.com. From April 14–22, 2016, students from Columbia Divest for Climate Justice conducted a peaceful sit-in outside of President Lee Bollinger's office in Low Library to demand divestment from the top 200 publicly traded fossil fuel companies. Seventeen students originally joined the sit-in but students who left were not allowed reentry into the building. Six students remained to the last day. University administration locked down the building and had security guards continually monitoring the students. Over 100 students joined a \\"sleep-out\\" on the steps of the library to show solidarity for the sit-in participants who faced potential school sanctions or arrest. Presidential candidate Bernie Sanders voiced support for the students.

As an amateur astronomer, he studied the formations on the Moon with great intensity and meticulousness. He compiled an extensive atlas of the moon between 1884 and 1940 (which was not completely published until 1964, and prized today as a rare book). His Unser Mond was published in Bremen in 1936. Working from an observatory in Landstuhl, Fauth represented the moon in twenty-four sectors. Unfortunately, Fauth carried out this immense work at the same time that advances were being made in photography that allowed for a more reliable depiction of the lunar surface. In 1913 with co-author Hanns Hörbiger he published his now-defunct World Ice Theory (Glazial- Kosmogonie),Hans Hoerbiger and Philipp Fauth, Glazialkosmogenie. 1913 which was subsequently investigated by Hans Schindler Bellamy.

There are currently three variants, the M88, M88A1 and M88A2 HERCULES (Heavy Equipment Recovery Combat Utility Lifting Extraction System). The M88 series has seen action most noticeably in the Vietnam War, the Persian Gulf War, the Iraq War, and the War in Afghanistan, and to a lesser extent during the Kosovo War, where they were deployed to help recover heavy armored vehicles of the Allied ground units. As of 2000, the M88A2 replacement cost is around . History =Design= The design of this vehicle was based on the chassis and parts of the automotive component of the M48 Patton and M60 Patton tanks. The original M88 was introduced in 1961, M88A1 in 1977, with the current M88A2 introduced in 1997. =Development= Originally manufactured by Bowen McLaughlin York (later the BMY division of Harsco Corporation) in 1961, the company would later merge with FMC Corp. to form the United Defense Industries in 1994, which was in turn acquired by BAE Systems in 2005 to become BAE Systems Land and Armaments. In February 2008 the company was awarded a $185 million contract modification from the U.S. Army to manufacture 90 Army-configured M88A2s, four United States Marine Corps-configured M88A2s and authorized spares list parts. =Role= The M88's primary role is to repair or replace damaged parts in fighting vehicles while under fire, as well as extricate vehicles that have become bogged down or entangled. The main winch on the M88A2 is capable of a 70-ton, single line recovery, and a 140-ton 2:1 recovery when used with the 140 ton pulley. The A-frame boom of the A2 can lift 35 tons when used in conjunction with the spade down. The spade can be used for light earth moving, and can be used to anchor the vehicle when using the main winch. The M88 employs an Auxiliary power unit (APU) to provide auxiliary electrical and hydraulic power when the main engine is not in operation. It can also be used to slave start other vehicles, provide power for the hydraulic impact wrench, as well as the means to refuel or de-fuel vehicles as required. The M88 series of vehicles can refuel M1 tanks from its own fuel tanks, but this is a last resort due to the possibility of clogging the AGT-1500s fuel filters. The fuel pump draws fuel from the bottom of the fuel cell, and with it, all of the sediment that has accumulated with time. Variants *M88 – 1961 *M88A1 – 1977 *M88A2 Hercules – 1991 *M88A3 Hercules – future The original M88 produced from 1960 to 1964 used the Continental AVSI-1790-6A gasoline engine rated at 980 HP at 2800 rpm, as well as a 10 HP gasoline auxiliary power unit.Armored Recovery Vehicle, In service from 1961 - present. The M88A1 was powered by the Continental AVDS-1790-2DR Diesel engine and had a 10 HP Diesel auxiliary power unit. While the original M88 and M88A1 are designated as a \\"Medium Recovery Vehicle\\", the M88A2 (original designation being M88A1E1) is designated as \\"Heavy Recovery Vehicle\\". They are all similar in many fundamental ways however, the later version is distinctly heavier (70 tons, compared to the original 56 tons) and uses a different engine (AVDS 1790-8CR with 1050 hp, compared to a Continental AVDS-1790-2DR, with 750 hp). The M88A2 is slightly larger than its predecessors (8.6 × 3.7 × 3.2 m compared to 8.3 × 3.4 × 3.2 m) thus retains a lower top speed (40 km/h) and a significantly lower road range (322 km compared to 450 km). There have also been improvements in braking and steering. Additionally, the M88A2 has upgraded armor protection including armored track skirts and applique armor panels, which both previous models lack. The M88 is also lacking in Nuclear, Biological, Chemical (NBC) defenses and a smoke screen generator, which the later M88A1 and M88A2 models are equipped with. Furthermore, the crew number has decreased from 5, to 3–4, to 3 through the series. The M88A3 configuration features an upgraded powertrain, suspension and tracks, increasing the vehicle’s speed, survivability and reliability. The M88A3 also features a seventh road wheel to reduce ground pressure and new hydropneumatic suspension units (HSUs) that enable the track to be locked out for greater control when recovering vehicles, say BAE in a release. “The contract is being awarded under an Other Transactional Authority (OTA) acquisition model for upgrading the M88A2 Heavy Equipment Recovery Combat Utility Lift Evacuation System (HERCULES) to the next generation M88A3 HERCULES. BAE Systems’ M88 family of recovery vehicles has provided the Army with unprecedented capability for recovering stranded or disabled combat vehicles since the 1960s. Due to incremental weight increases of the Army’s Main Battle Tank over the years, the M88A3’s predecessor, the M88A2, is currently unable to safely perform single-vehicle recovery of the Abrams. BAE Systems has invested Independent Research and Development to develop the M88A3 for three years in an effort to identify, understand, and provide solutions to return to single-vehicle recovery of the tank.” All variants retain an M2 Browning .50 caliber machine gun, 432 mm ground clearance, 2.6 m fording depth, 1.1 m wall climb and 2.6 m trench crossing capabilities. There has been no major deviation in battlefield role through the M88 series, the later models are merely able to lift heavier loads. The M88A1 was designed around the now obsolete M60 Patton tanks, so it was in light of the fact that two M88A1s were required to tow the new M1 Abrams tank that the decision was made to upgrade to the M88A2 in 1991. On February 20, 2017, it was announced that the United States Army had contracted BAE Systems Land and Armaments a $28 million contract modification for the procurement of 11 M88A2 recovery vehicles.

Criticism M88 mired as it attempted to crest a hill in heavy rain during night training in Fort Hunter Liggett, California. One of the main issues afflicting the current M88A2 is the high rate of winch failures. The leading cause of these failures is by operating the winch without tension on the cable leading to loose wrapping and bunching up of the cable (Birdnesting).

It was opened in 1900 as the fourth Columbus City Schools high school at 345 Deshler Avenue in Columbus, Ohio. The current building was opened March 31, 1924. The Charles S. Barrett Building 345 E. Deshler Ave (named for that building's first Principal in 1924 when it was reuitlized as a junior high school) opened September 1900. Prior to that in 1895-1897 South High School utilized part of the Ohio Avenue Elementary School. In 1897 it was decided that the building was too far east for its name; the south side students were returned to the Columbus High School building at 6th & Broad Streets (which later became the 1st Central High School), and the building process began on the Deshler Street Building. It was known as South Urban Academy for a short time. The school is located at 1160 Ann Street. The mascot for South High School is the Bulldog. The school was remodeled in 2009 and classes were being held in the former Barrett Middle School at 345 East Deshler Avenue. Oddly enough, it was the original South High School. The remodel was complete and classes resumed at the current Ann Street building in the summer of 2010.

Most of the present structures are from the 12th century. Architecture The remains of the monastic site include \\"St. Tola's Church\\", a round tower, \\"St. Tola's Well\\" and \\"St. Tola's Cross\\". The church stands on the site of the original monastery, reportedly founded by St. Tola in the 8th century. The ruined Romanesque structure visible today mainly dates to the 12th century and is over 30 metres long. The lancet windows in the east gable were additions from the early 13th century. The stone arch, showing twelve human and seven animal heads, also dates to the 13th century. Inside the church is the grave of Joan O'Dea, wife of the last clan chieftain, Michael O'Dea (dating to 1684). The late 11th century round tower was converted into a fortification in the 16th century. It was severely damaged by artillery fire by Cromwellian troops in 1651. Of an estimated original height of around 30 metres, only about a third still remains. An old bronze bell discovered in 1790 was taken to Corofin and sold to pay for the current church bell. In the 1850s, Edward Synge, the local landlord, made repairs to the tower. St. Tola's Well is a pre-Christian well that was the site of an annual pilgrimage on 30 March. In the 1860s the landlord had the well paved over but it was reopened in 1986. A High cross, the so-called \\"St. Tola's Cross\\", is located in a field to the east of the church. It dates to the 12th century. The upper part shows the crucifixion, while on the shaft is the figure of a bishop, with the back and sides showing Irish interlacing work. The cross was knocked over by the Cromwellian soldiers but repaired by Michael O'Dea in 1683. Since he used stones from the church to set up the pedestal, the church building must have fallen into disuse by then. The Synge family again restored the cross in 1871. In 1960, the cross was temporarily dismantled and shipped to Barcelona for an exhibition on Irish art. Nearby This monastic site is part of the Dysert O'Dea Archaeological Trail. There are many more historical sites in the immediate vicinity including O'Dea Castle, two ring forts, the remains of a fulacht fiadh, and the ruins of a stone Victorian house dating from 1861. \\"Synge's Lodge\\" is a ruined guest house, originally built in the Georgian style not far from the church ruins. The Synge coat of arms with the motto \\"Caelesta canimes\\" remains over the door. The Synge's local agent lived in nearby \\"Mollaneen House\\", built c. 1780. This had a walled garden and orchard. The Battle of Dysert O'Dea of 1318 took place near the monastic site. Today Church, round tower and high cross are today a National Monument of Ireland.

MAGL is a 33-kDa, membrane-associated member of the serine hydrolase superfamily and contains the classical GXSXG consensus sequence common to most serine hydrolases. The catalytic triad has been identified as Ser122, His269, and Asp239. left  Function  Monoacylglycerol lipase catalyzes a chemical reaction that uses water molecules to break the glycerol monoesters of long- chain fatty acids. It functions together with hormone-sensitive lipase (LIPE) to hydrolyze intracellular triglyceride stores in adipocytes and other cells to fatty acids and glycerol. MGLL may also complement lipoprotein lipase (LPL) in completing hydrolysis of monoglycerides resulting from degradation of lipoprotein triglycerides. Monoacylglycerol lipase is a key enzyme in the hydrolysis of the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG). It converts monoacylglycerols to the free fatty acid and glycerol. The contribution of MAGL to total brain 2-AG hydrolysis activity has been estimated to be ~85% (ABHD6 and ABHD12 are responsible for ~4% and ~9%, respectively, of the remainder), and this in vitro estimate has been confirmed in vivo by the selective MAGL inhibitor JZL184. Chronic inactivation of MAGL results in massive (>10-fold) elevations of brain 2-AG in mice, along with marked compensatory downregulation of CB1 receptors in selective brain areas.  Inhibitors  MAGL enzyme inhibitors (URB602, URB754, JZL184) produce cannabinoid behavioral effects in mice.

It continues the avant-garde and progressive direction they had been exploring on 2004's Si monvmentvm reqvires, circvmspice, and is considered by the band as something of an \\"appendix\\" to that album.  Concept  Kénôse draws on a range of theological and philosophical themes.The title Kénôse means Kenosis in French, a theological term which describes \\"the 'self-emptying' of one's own will and becoming entirely receptive to God's divine will.\\" In particular it refers to the notion within Christology that God emptied himself of his divine characteristics in order to be made manifest as a mortal being in the form of Christ. One analysis of this term draws on The Anxiety of Influence by Harold Bloom, which defines the term in two senses: > \\"...a breaking device similar to the defense mechanisms our psyches employ > against repetition compulsions; kenosis then is a movement toward > discontinuity with the precursor. From St. Paul, who uses the term in regard > to Jesus’ empties the divine out of himself to assume human form. Similarly > the poet empties out the poetic afflatus of the precursor. The precursor too > is emptied out.\\" One of the main themes of the record is a pursuit of the essence or substance of God and Christ in the light of Kenosis. The band ask whether, on Christ's death and return to immortality, God's essence remained as pure as it was before, or indeed whether he has \\"succumbed to the original malady\\": death. The lyrics form an argument against the concept of redemption; holding that humanity is irredeemable, and instead invoking plerosis, a blasphemous flowering of humanity's carnal condition in spite of God. The issue of hypostasis and hypostatic union is discussed at length, with the opening track's lyrics asking: > \\"Was there not an inconceivable loss of knowledge at Bethlehem? Christ's > abasement, His subjecting Himself to the laws of Human birth and growth and > to the lowliness of fallen human nature... Did the Son remain the > transcendent Logos, is there not a radical and fatal discontinuity between > the consciousness of the transcendent Logos and the secular Jesus?\\" The opening track's lyrics also quote from Philippians 2:5-8 in defence of this claim. The very first line of the record is a quote from The Great Chain of Being by Arthur Lovejoy which reads \\"Everything, except GOD, has in itself some measure of privation, thus all individuals may be graded according to the degree to which they are infected with mere potentiality\\". Thus the EP seeks to show the debasement of Christ through his incarnation as a fragile mortal. It also references Georges Bataille's Base Materialism, as well as a motet for use during the Adoration of the Cross on Good Friday. The second track, II, quotes Martin Luther that \\"Therefore God honours the sword\\" from Whether Soldiers, Too, Can Be Saved (1526) in which Luther defends war on religious grounds and describes soldiers as God's instrument. The full quote is: > \\"Therefore, God honors the sword so highly that He calls it His own > ordinance, and will not have men say or imagine that they have invented it > or instituted it. For the hand that wields this sword and slays with it is > then no more man's hand, but God's, and it is not man but God, who hangs, > tortures, beheads, slays and fights. All these are His work and His > judgments...\\"  Critical reception  Kénôse has received positive reviews from music critics. AllMusic praised the technical skill of the musicians as well as the inclusion of non-traditional musical elements, writing that \\"Guitars and drums are played with razor-sharp precision throughout, and the indecipherable vocals sound exactly like Beelzebub on a bad day.\\" Blabbermouth praised the avant-garde and experimental characteristics of the record, concluding that \\"The combination of a strong sound mix, accomplished musicianship, and pure aural dread makes \\"Kenose\\" a particularly engaging experience. Add to that the digipack packaging with a 40-page booklet and you've got yourself a winner.\\" Track listing References Category:Deathspell Omega albums Category:Southern Lord Records EPs Category:2005 EPs ","title":"Kénôse"},{"id":"6687327","text":"Carmindy Kathryn Bowyer, better known by her professional name Carmindy, is an American make-up artist and beauty expert based in New York City.

Origin The region in Africa where Tishkoff found the greatest level of mitochondrial diversity (green) and the region Behar et al. postulated the most ancient division in the human population began to occur (light brown) L0 is one of two branches from the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) for the shared human maternal lineage. The haplogroup consists of five main branches (L0a, L0b, L0d, L0f, L0k). Four of them were originally classified into L1 subclades, L1a, L1d, L1f and L1k. In 2014, ancient DNA analysis of a 2,330 year old male forager's skeleton in Southern Africa found that the specimen belonged to the L0d2c1c mtDNA subclade. This maternal haplogroup is today most closely associated with the Ju, a subgroup of the indigenous San people, which points to population continuity in the region. In 2016, a Late Iron Age desiccated mummy from the Tuli region in northern Botswana was also found to belong to haplogroup L0. Distribution Projected spatial distribution of haplogroup L0 in Africa. Frequency maps for L0 (total), L0a, L0b, L0d, L0f and L0k L0 is found most commonly in Sub-Saharan Africa. It reaches its highest frequency in the Khoisan people at 73% on average. Some of the highest frequencies are: Namibia (!Xun) 79%, South Africa (Khwe/!Xun) 83%, and Botswana (!Kung) 100%. Haplogroup L0d is found among Khoisan groups of Southern Africa closer to the Khoid side with (following L0k) being more Sanid but is largely restricted to the Khoisan as a whole. L0d is also commonly found in the Coloured population of South Africa and frequencies range from 60% to 71%. This illustrates the massive maternal contribution of Khoisan people to the Coloured population of South Africa. Haplogroups L0k is the second most common haplogroup in the Khoisan groups closer to the Sanid side with (following L0d) being more Khoid but is largely restricted to the Khoisan as a whole. Although the Khoisan associated L0d haplogroup were found in high frequencies in the Coloured population of South Africa, L0k were not observed in two studies involving large groups of Coloured individuals. Haplogroup L0f is present in relatively small frequencies in Tanzania, East Africa among the Sandawe people of Tanzania who are older than the Khoisan. Haplogroup L0a is most prevalent in South-East African populations (25% in Mozambique). Among Guineans, it has a frequency between 1% and 5%, with the Balanta group showing increased frequency of about 11%. Haplogroup L0a has a Paleolithic time depth of about 33,000 years and likely reached Guinea between 10,000 and 4,000 years ago. It also is often seen in the Mbuti and Biaka Pygmies. L0a is found at a frequency of almost 25% in Hadramawt (Yemen). Haplogroup L0b Ethiopia.

It is on the southern shore of Lake Michigan and is 126 feet tall. It is a wandering dune that moves or shifts every year, and is called a \\"living dune.\\" Mount Baldy is accessible from U.S. Route 12 (also known as Dunes Highway) between the town of Pines and the western border of Michigan City, Indiana. It is a tourist attraction locally and regionally, drawing weekend and summer visitors from Chicago. Prior to the dune's closure, one could ascend its 302 steps and see Chicago's skyline. North of Mount Baldy is a swimmable beach which is also part of Indiana Dunes National Park. Erosion Due to its popularity with visitors, the marram grass which had stabilized the dune was largely destroyed, and the dune has begun advancing southwards, threatening to overrun its parking lot. Accordingly, the National Park Service has rerouted trails and planted grass in hopes of slowing the dune. The piers from nearby Michigan City, Indiana intensify erosion by blocking the natural sediment flow produced by longshore drift in Lake Michigan. Decomposition chimney In 2013, a void space anomaly in the dune led to a small child falling into a cylindrical shaft that collapsed and buried the child. It took three hours for the boy to be rescued from the pit. The geological process that is producing the never before studied anomalies appears to be related to the burial and decomposition of fungus-ridden black oak trees. In 2016, scientists concluded that such anomalies in the moving or living dune are caused by the burial of trees that eventually decay leaving a hollowed out shaft beneath unsteady ground, named a \\"dune decomposition chimney.\\" The majority of the dune remains closed to visitors except on ranger-led tours; however, the beach reopened in the summer of 2017.

Early life F.H. Gravely in 1921 (seated on chair, left most) Gravely was born in 1885 in Wellingborough, Northamptonshire, England to Arthur Frederic Gravely and Margaret Hutchinson, the eldest of four children. The family were Quakers and although the father was a businessman, he was interested in natural history. His mother came from a farming family which also produced Sir Jonathan Hutchinson. At the age of nine he moved to a boarding school in Sheffield. He then studied at Ackworth and Bootham (both Quaker schools) before moving to Manchester University to study zoology.Aiyappan, A. (1951) Madras Government Museum Centenary Souvenir (1851-1951). pp. 39-50. Indian Museum, Calcutta Gravely graduated in 1906 and became a demonstrator at Manchester in 1907. He worked on collections made in the \\"Discovery\\" Antarctic Expedition along with S.J. Hickson and worked on Polychaete Larvae. In 1909 he was appointed Assistant Superintendent of the Indian Museum Calcutta. In 1914, still at Calcutta, he received his D.Sc. for the work on the Oriental Passalidae. He unified the monographs of early observers with the notes of Arrow and Zang to bring to the oriental passalids (1914), and the family itself in general (1918), the classification that is in vogue today with minor alterations. Government Museum, Madras Dr. Gravely became the Superintendent of the Government Museum of Madras in 1920. Over the next two decades, he undertook the investigation of the littoral fauna of Krusadai Island, Gulf of Mannar, revived the Bulletin of the museum, and embarked on the scientific preservation, study and interpretation of the museum's collections. His work on Arachnida and Mollusca significantly enhanced the collections of the museum in the two zoological groups. He was also responsible for enlarging the reserve collection, particularly of Invertebrates. Dr. Gravely contributed to the overall development of the museum as well. He, along with the Curator Dr. C. Sivaramamurti, ensured in 1938 that the antiquities and industrial art collected by the Museum was organized effectively, into a collection that exists even today. The most important of Dr. Gravely's many contributions to the subject was the monograph he collaborated on with T. N. Ramachandran (Curator of Archaeology 1925-1935) on the scientific basis for identifying the period of metal images. Dr. Gravely also donated a variety of sculptures, carvings and bronzes to other institutions, including the Prince of Wales Museum, the Lucknow Museum and Dr. Ananda Coomaraswami's Museum in Boston. Dr. Gravely, and P V Mayuranathan considerably enhanced the Herbarium and the botanical collections of the museum. Dr. Gravely pioneered the preservation of bronzes collected by the Museum. He initiated the electrolytic restoration process which has helped preserve not only bronze objects, but also ethnological, pre-historic and numismatic collections. He also built a separate Chemical Conservation Laboratory, the only one of its kind at the time, in 1937. Other contributions He was one of the Foundation Fellows of the National Institute of Sciences of India, now the apex scientific body in the country, Indian National Science Academy. He also served as the Secretary to the Asiatic Society in the period 1915-18. His insect and spider collection is in the Indian Museum, Calcutta. It notably contain insects, Arachnida and Myriapoda from limestone caves in Burma (1911), and oriental Passalidae.  Personal life In 1925 he married Laura Balling and they had a daughter Ann Margaret (born 1928) and a son John Frederic (born 1931).

It takes its name from the ferry service which operated between there and South Wales until 1886. Ferry =History= Looking across the Severn to New Passage, from the old ferry pier at Portskewett. New Passage was for many years the location of a ferry crossing to and from South Wales, running from Chiswell Pill near Pilning to Black Rock at Portskewett in Monmouthshire. The route provided an alternative to the centuries-old Aust ferry two miles (3 km) upstream, known as the \\"Old Passage\\". The New Passage, which offered a more direct route to South Wales, was probably in operation from 1630, when the New Passage Ferry Company was formed.Northwick, Bristol and Avon Family History Society, accessed 27-03-18 The ferry was said to have been discontinued between 1645 and 1718. There is a tale, often repeated in 19th century and later guidebooks, that during the English Civil War King Charles was chased across the river from Portskewett: the pursuing Roundheads were drowned after being landed at low tide on the English Stones by the boatmen, after which Cromwell ordered the ferries to cease operation. This story originated in a deposition given by Giles Gilbert of Shirenewton during the course of a 1720s legal case regarding rights to operate the ferry, and which was later printed by William Coxe in his 1801 Historical Tour of Monmouthshire.Morgan, Octavius (1860) Notes on the ancient domestic residences of Pentre-Bach, Crick, Ty-Mawr, the Garn, Crindau, and St. Julian's, v4, p.12 While Gilbert claimed to be \\"credibly informed\\" that a group of Parliamentarian soldiers had perished while pursuing the King, another witness in the same legal case gave evidence that the incident had in fact involved a group of twelve Royalists who \\"in haste to pass\\" in November 1644 had forced the boatmen to take them across at low tide.Morgan (1860) p.13 The antiquary Octavius Morgan, on investigating these stories, found that the Iter Carolinum and the diary of Richard Symonds proved that Charles had intended to use the Black Rock crossing to reach Bristol on 24 July 1645, but had been dissuaded. Morgan however noted a contemporary report that Charles had a \\"narrow escape of being taken near the Black Rock\\" in July 1645 and suggested that some of Charles's party had crossed the Passage on the evening of 24 July \\"probably sent purposely to mislead the enemy [...] and the result was death by drowning of the pursuers\\".Morgan (1860) p.13 In 1718 the New Passage ferry service was restarted by the Lewis family of St. Pierre, Monmouthshire, allowing it to be used by mail and passenger coaches between Bristol and south Wales. For much of the century the ferry rights, fishery and the inn at New Passage were rented from the Lewis family by John Hoggard.Williams (ed). (1971) John Wesley in Wales, 1739-1790, UWP, p. 6 Amongst the travellers to use the ferry was Charles Wesley, who had a lucky escape in 1743, when his ship almost foundered in stormy weather. By the late 18th century the main mail coach route between Bristol and Milford Haven used the New Passage and by the end of the century the crossing rivalled the Old Passage route. The ferry and inn at New Passage in 1810, with cattle being unloaded. In 1825 the New Passage Association formed, using the 30-ton steamboat \\"St Pierre\\". However, the sponsorship by the Dukes of Beaufort of the Aust route, with faster boats and a pier, meant that by 1830 mail coaches were diverted there, and the New Passage declined. In the 1840s the ferry was purchased by the Bristol and South West Junction Railway company for use as a crossing, though in the event the company failed to raise the capital to build a railway. A subsequent scheme, surveyed and engineered by Brunel and completed by his assistant Brereton, was opened in 1863 as the Bristol and South Wales Union Railway, using the New Passage ferry to cross the Severn to Portskewett. New Passage Pier railway station, a rebuilt New Passage Hotel, a promenade, tea rooms, and a railway pier, improved the facilities for travellers. One year earlier, an engineer engaged on building the pier had the idea of a tunnel under the river. In 1886, the Severn Tunnel opened and the New Passage ferry became redundant. The pier was dismantled within two years, though the beach, promenade and hotel remained popular with day trippers for many years afterwards. The railway tunnel passes under the River Severn from a point just south of New Passage. =Characteristics= The engineer Thomas Telford, after surveying the crossing, described it in his report as \\"one of the most forbidding places at which an important ferry was ever established - a succession of violent cataracts formed in a rocky channel exposed to the rapid rush of a tide which has scarcely an equal\\".Rolt, LTC (1985) Thomas Telford, p.146 The river between New Passage and Black Rock was 11,200 feet wide at high water and 8,600 feet at low water, in comparison to figures of 6,800 and 4,700 feet for the Old Passage route.\\"Minutes of Evidence Taken Before the Select Committee on Post-Office Communication\\" (1842), Parliamentary Papers: 1780-1849, Volume 9, p.153 The crossing was complicated by the fact that, apart from six hours a day around high tide, two-thirds of the passage was through a channel between the English Stones and the Dun sandbank through which the ebb tide flowed so quickly that \\"a passage [could not] be made against it except in strong and favourable winds\\". Even after leaving this channel the ferries had to then cross the head of another channel, the Shoots, through which the current was so strong that they were often pulled down it by the ebb tide: all these difficulties meant that the passage was uncertain for around five hours a day. It was these irregularities in the service that led to the General Post Office eventually transferring mail back to the Old Passage: by 1834 it was found that mail coaches were arriving late at Swansea four times out of five, \\"almost wholly caused by delays at the New Passage\\".Williams, H. (1977) Stage Coaches in Wales, p.111 Nevertheless, the ferry was compared to the Aust crossing the most direct route into South Wales. Second Severn Crossing In 1996 the Second Severn Crossing road bridge was completed, virtually along the same line as the Severn Tunnel. The bridge, the longest in the UK, carries M4 motorway traffic.  New Passage Hotel  The hotel was opened in 1863 to serve railway passengers, replacing the earlier New Passage House inn. When the ferry closed it continued to prosper as a privately owned public house. In 1921 the hotel was the location of experiments by the inventor H.G. Matthews in the projection of moving films with a sound track. The hotel was closed in 1973. It was then sold by the Bracey family, and the building was left empty, until ravaged by the elements and neglect, it was finally demolished in the late 1970s. A small luxurious housing development was created on the resulting land. There is a photograph of the New Passage Hotel in 1974 on Flickr here Ecology As of 1990, 28 species of seabird had been recorded in the Severn Beach / New Passage area, including sooty and Balearic shearwaters, all four Northern Hemisphere skuas, seven species of tern and four species of alcid.Lancastle, Brian (1990) Seabirds in the upper Severn Estuary Avon Bird Report 1989 References External links *A drawing of the New Passage hotel in 1789 by Samuel Grimm, British Library  Further reading  * Category:Villages in South Gloucestershire District ","title":"New Passage"},{"id":"6687365","text":"Lilydale Heights College is a government secondary school located in the suburb of Lilydale, east of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.

The band has been together for 25 years (placing their origin circa 1993), and has played concerts with likes of Lamb of God, Hatebreed, Soulfly, Otep, Slipknot, Snot, Coal Chamber, Obituary, Drowning Pool, Hed PE, Chimaira, Meshuggah, Korn, Pro-Pain & Ministry.  Biography  Hemlock frequently plays shows with thrash metal band Slayer and has received touring sponsorship with Jägermeister on the Jägermeister Music Tour through this alliance. Their focus has always been on their fans and their live shows, typically touring for 8 to 9 months out of the year. The band has done regional touring in the southwest United States consistently since 1999. This, combined with national touring starting in 2003 has provided the band with a base of hardcore Hemlock fans across the United States. The band, fronted by bass guitarist/lead vocalist Chad Smith, makes a valiant effort to be real to their fans while on tour, often staying at the venue hours after the last song to hang out with fans. Smith, with his long dreadlocked hair and workingman attitude, also handles the merchandise booth at venues and is the heart of the band. The Wall of Death A Hemlock concert staple is the wall of death. A common crowd participation gimmick at metal concerts, the wall of death requires the audience to be split into two separate \\"walls\\" that face each other from opposing sides of the concert floor (usually where the mosh pit is located). Hemlock started doing the Wall of Death back in the late 1990s at their shows. Frontman Chad Smith admits he did not come up with the idea, but he did bring it to the metal world, and passed it on to other bands that toured with Hemlock (i.e. Chimaira, 36 Crazyfists ) and they passed it on, and now it is a favorite at most metal shows. In Hemlock's version of the wall of death, the band starts playing music while the lead singer counts down from 10. After the singer reaches the number 1, he usually screams out a word such as \\"go\\". At this point, the two sides of the audience rush at each other in an often violent collision that may involve jumping in the air, swinging of fists, and throwing of elbows. A mosh pit usually forms following the wall of death.

It is located about northwest of central Saint Petersburg. Population: During the summer months, the population increases five to six times. Finnish history Pre-revolutionary villa, Komarovo. Mathilde Kschessinska used to stay here. Like many settlements located on the Karelian Isthmus on the Saint Petersburg-Vyborg railroad line, Kellomäki was vigorously developed in the late 19th - early 20th century at the height of the summer-resort boom. The original meaning of Kellomäki was \\"Bell Hill\\", named after a bell that was positioned on a sandy hill for the use of railroad workers. The bell notified of dinner break and the end of the workday. A railroad station opened near that spot on May 1, 1903, which is the unofficial date of Kellomäki's founding. The Russian Orthodox church of the Holy Spirit was built in 1908, and burnt down in 1917. After that, a house chapel in one of the dachas served as church until the Soviet takeover. In 1916, about 800 dachas were counted in the settlement. Among the well-known residents of Kellomäki before the Russian revolution were: *Leonid Andreyev - writer *George Borman - owner of a famous Saint Petersburg chocolate factory *Peter Carl Fabergé - jeweller *Mathilde Kschessinska - ballerina * Augustin Reiche - speech therapist, had a facility for children at his dacha. *Anna Vyrubova - lady-in-waiting to the Romanov family The development of summer- resort towns on the Karelian Isthmus was slowed down after Finland's declaration of independence in 1917. Many of the dachas were abandoned, and some 200 buildings were auctioned off, dismantled and rebuilt in other Finnish towns. An Émigré community formed in Kellomäki after the revolution as the White Russians fled to Finland. By the beginning of the Soviet-Finnish War, 167 families remained in the settlement - most of them were evacuated to Järvenpää during the Soviet-Finnish border negotiations in the fall of 1939. On November 30, 1939, after artillery bombardment, Kellomäki surrendered to Soviet troops without battle. Several buildings were destroyed, but overall the damage to the settlement was not serious. Soviet and Russian history Komarovo, one of standard houses manufactured in Finland Complex of Soviet-era dachas, Komarovo The town was annexed to the Soviet Union in the Moscow Peace Treaty (1940). Immediately after World War II, the Council of Peoples Commissars issued decree № 2638 \\"on building dachas for members of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR and setting aside land plots from 1.25 to as gratis personal property\\". Standard houses manufactured in Finland on account of war reparations, were transported and assembled on the spot. Kellomäki was renamed to Komarovo in honor of botanist Vladimir Komarov, President of the Academy in 1948. Special resorts and dachas were also established for Writers, Composers, Theater and Cinema Workers. Land was set aside for Atomic Scientists as well. Komarovo was built on this principle : people serve the state, the state pays back with rewards. And the principle was subverted by an aging lady: Anna Akhmatova. It turned out that there are more attractive values than those offered by the state. - Lev Lurye, historian. Easily reachable from the city by elektrichka train, the settlement became home to many prominent figures in science and culture, members of the Saint Petersburg (then named Leningrad) intelligentsia. Komarovo <...> was a place of both family relaxation and work. The settlement had developed its own daily routine. Usually, from the morning until six in the evening, people were busy with work, and closer to seven, under the rays of warm evening sun, the unhurried stroll along the Kurortnaya street and the nearby paths took place. On this street they walked, discussed various topics with colleagues, talked about books, theater, and life, brought guests... Since the 1990s, the academic and cultural traditions of Komarovo have been weakened, and currently, the New Russians and the well-to-dos of Saint Petersburg construct new villas here or redesign existing dachas purchased from the older residents. In 2005 a nonprofit fund \\"Kellomaki- Komarovo\\" was founded. Some of the projects include building a new church, opening a museum, and preserving the yet unprotected forests. Komarovo has served as a residence for government officials of Saint Petersburg, and still does today. Mayor Valentina Matviyenko lives here in the summer and commutes to the city.

The company moved to Bridge Street, where it remained until 1978. The site is now occupied by The Oracle shopping centre. Simonds became a very early limited company in 1885, taking the name of H & G Simonds from William's two sons, Henry and George. The latter was the father of a later director, George Blackall Simonds, a sculptor. In 1960, the brewery amalgamated with Courage & Barclay to become Courage, Barclay, Simonds & Co Ltd until simplified to Courage Ltd in 1970. As Scottish Courage, they operated from the Berkshire Brewery on the borders of Reading and Shinfield, until it closed in March 2010. In January 2007, the rights for the production, marketing and sales of the Courage brands were sold to Wells & Young's Brewing Company of Bedford. This is managed by a venture called Courage Brands LtdWells and Youngs Buy Courage Brands – Wells & Young's Brewing Company Ltd – www.wellsandyoungs.co.uk Development Simonds developed rapidly and, by the 1790s, had a fine new brewery complex designed by local architect, Sir John Soane and an early Boulton & Watt steam engine. However, expansion was held back until legislation restricting the setting up of new public houses was repealed by the Beerhouse Act 1830. Since 1813, Simonds had supplied beer to the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst. In the 1850s, it expanded its reputation for supplying the military with beer, when nearby Aldershot was established as the 'home of the British Army'. This led to a branch being set up in Malta and an outlet in Gibraltar. The former still exists as the, now independent, Simonds Farsons Cisk Brewery. Simonds also supplied many of the railways in southern England. By the 1880s, Simonds was the largest brewery in Reading. After the First World War, they expanded by acquisition, purchasing local breweries as well as others in places such as Bristol and Devonport. By 1938, Simonds' was producing just over one percent of all beer brewed in England and Wales. The brewery made extensive use of the canal to deliver its wares, but the railway was also an important form of transport, with the brewery having its own siding off the Coley branch line. Beer Simonds was a pioneer of pale ale in the 1830s, including India pale ale which the company exported to the British army in India. In the 1870s, they developed a lighter beer called 'SB' (Season's Brew) and, in the following decade introduced a new system of fermentation known as the 'Burton Union Method'. Simonds were well known for their 'hopleaf' branding and Hopleaf pale ale is still available from the Simonds Farsons Cisk Brewery in Malta. Simonds branded an \\"India Pale Ale\\" as \\"Tavern\\", the name originating as \\"Taverner's\\" in a competition for employees.

For decades Gause was generally unknown to LDS historians, and so could be considered Mormonism's lost counselor of the First Presidency. It was only in the 1980s that research identified his rightful place among early Church leaders. Quaker and Shaker years The son of William Gause and Mary Beverly, Gause was born in 1785 in East Marlborough, Chester County, Pennsylvania. Gause followed the faith of his parents and in 1806, apparently still single at twenty-one, he requested and was received into the Society of Friends, becoming a Quaker. Although a Quaker in good standing, Gause's Quaker pacificism did not prevent him from joining the Delaware militia in 1814 during the War of 1812. Upon leaving the military in 1815 he moved to Wilmington, Delaware, where he married Martha Johnson. In 1822, the family finally settled in Chester County where he became a teacher in a Quaker school. Martha died in 1828 after the birth of their fourth child. In the same year of Martha's death, Gause married a woman named Minerva, and they settled in Hancock, Massachusetts. Shortly after the birth of a daughter, Gause resigned from the Quakers on January 30, 1829, and joined the Shakers. Gause's new wife followed him, apparently accepting the Shaker practice of sexual abstinence even for married couples. In 1831, Gause, his wife, and infant daughter moved to the Shaker community near North Union, Ohio, leaving Martha's four children in the care of his sister, who was also a Shaker. Mormon years At the same time that Gause was moving to North Union, Latter Day Saints from New York were also emigrating to Ohio, settling in the environs of Kirtland, some fifteen miles east of North Union. It is not known when Gause came into contact with these new settlers, but some time after October 1831 he was baptized; this time his wife refused to follow him. Gause rose quickly to a position of prominence in his new faith; in an early record book it states that on March 8, 1832, Joseph Smith \\"[c]hose this day and ordained brother Jesse Gause and Broth[er] Sidney [Rigdon] to be my counsellors of the ministry of the presidency of the High Priesthood\\". A week later, Smith received a revelation concerning Gause's selection as a counselor in what later became known as the First Presidency, as well as giving him additional instructions concerning his new assignment. Smith may have chosen a recent convert for such a responsible position due to Gause's experience with the Shaker communal society, because the Latter Day Saints had recently commenced their own communal experiment, the Law of Consecration. Both Gause and Smith's other counselor, Sidney Rigdon, had previous experience living in communal societies. Gause settled into his new role, accompanying Smith to Jackson County, Missouri, between April and June 1832, in order to set up the Law of Consecration. Upon returning to Kirtland, Gause started on a mission with Zebedee Coltrin on August 1, 1832. The two missionaries traveled to North Union, where six days later Gause attempted to persuade Minerva to accept Mormonism, but she continued to refuse to join him. He then attempted unsuccessfully to take their daughter, but had to leave \\"very much [e]nraged.\\" Within a short time, Coltrin became ill and decided to return to Kirtland. The two men \\"parted in the fellowship of the gospel\\" on August 20. From this date Gause simply disappears from Mormon history. It is not known what occurred to sour him on Mormonism, but by the end of 1832 he had \\"denied the faith\\" and was probably the \\"Jesse\\" excommunicated on December 3. Gause's role in Mormon history went unacknowledged for decades. The revelation given to him in 1832 was altered by replacing his name with his replacement in the First Presidency, Frederick G. Williams. His name was only recognized in the 1980 edition of the Doctrine and Covenants, but then only in the historical introduction to the revelation; his replacement's name remained in the text itself. Only after historians demonstrated his role in the formation of the Mormon hierarchy, beginning with Robert J. Woodford in 1975 and D. Michael Quinn in 1983, was his name restored to the church's list of general authorities. Later years Gause's activities after 1832 are not known. Apparently he did not rejoin Minerva at North Union, but may have returned to Chester County to be near his other children. By 1836, when he would have been 51 years old, he had died at Montgomery, Chester County, Pennsylvania. In that year his brother assumed the guardianship of Martha's children. However, his sister stated in 1873 that Gause \\"died away from his family\\", suggesting that he died estranged from his children.

Schreder (25 September 1915 - 2 August 2002) was an American naval aviator and sailplane developer, responsible for design and development of the HP/RS-series kit sailplanes marketed from 1962 until about 1982. Schreder also founded and ran Airmate, a successful drafting supplies company. Early life At age 9 Schreder built his first airplane, a biplane hang glider that he built from plans found in a Popular Mechanics magazine. At 19 he built his first powered airplane, a single-seater powered by a Henderson Motorcycle engine. After receiving a BS in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Toledo in 1938, Schreder joined the United States Navy as a Naval Aviation Cadet. He served in the Navy until 1948, rising to the rank of Commander. While in the Navy, Schreder was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for the sinking of the off Bermuda on 30 June 1942 while commanding a Martin PBM Mariner. Schreder's airmanship and marksmanship were such that he achieved a direct hit on the deck of the submarine with a depth charge. Schreder and his crew were initially disappointed when the depth charge did not explode on impact, and that it merely lodged itself into the teak planking of the deck. However, they continued to circle the site after the U-boat submerged, and observed that the charge detonated after the sub carried it down to its pre- set trigger depth. After leaving the Navy, Schreder founded a successful drafting supplies business in Toledo, Ohio, and later moved it to Bryan, Ohio. His fascination with flight continued unabated while nurturing this business, and he continued to experiment with small aircraft when he could. His next design, an all-metal low-wing single-seater called the Airmate 5, won the Experimental Aircraft Association's best workmanship award in 1954. A high- wing four-seater with a V-tail soon followed, but was abandoned before completion when Schreder tried soaring and was immediately hooked. Schreder immediately bought a Bowlus Baby Albatross, and later a Schweizer SGS 1-23. The 1-23 was damaged on Schreder's first flight in it when it was drawn into a thunderstorm and pelted with golfball-sized hailstones. After a week of hasty repairs, Schreder flew this ship to a second-place finish in the 1955 National Championships in Grand Prairie, Texas. In 1956, Schreder built the HP-7 and flew it to a fourth-place finish in that year's US National Championship contest. The HP-7 was quickly followed by the HP-8, in which Schreder flew to victory in the 1958 US Nationals in Bishop, California. Schreder also used his HP-8 to establish speed records over 100, 200, and 300 km courses. Successful designs After the HP-9, Schreder went on to develop the HP-10, his first attempt at developing a glider specifically for kit manufacture and construction by sailplane homebuilders. This project was handed off to Heliosoar, a company founded by Stephen DuPontDuPont was a son of E. Paul du Pont, a former president of Indian Company. to manufacture sailplane kits. Schreder immediately started on the HP-11, completing the prototype in time to fly it to a third-place finish in the 1963 World Gliding Championships in Junín, Argentina. Upon returning to the States, Schreder refined the design slightly, added retractable landing gear, and offered it in kit form as the HP-11A. Dick Schreder's HP-11 at the 1963 US Soaring Championships at Harris Hill, Elmira, NY.Right to left: HP-8, HP-10, HP-11. 1963 Harris Hill, NY. (Ben Greene, black shirt, left.) Over the next few years, Schreder leapfrogged through the HP-series by successively developing new wings and then new fuselages for his glider designs. During this time Schreder also formalized his glider kit business, incorporating under the name Bryan Aircraft, Inc. In 1966 Schreder flew his new HP-14 to victory in the US National Championships in Reno, Nevada, and created strong demand for HP-14 kits. This was his third national championship, having also won in 1958 and 1960. Schreder's next design, the HP-15, was somewhat disappointing. Its high-aspect-ratio wing gave it good glider performance at high speed, but yielded too high a sink rate while at thermalling speed.The small-chord wing, operating at low Reynolds number in climb, experienced high parasite drag Building new wings for the HP-15 fuselage produced the HP-16. These new 15-meter wingsThe same span as the previous wings, but with greater chord were Schreder's first large foray into an innovative construction method featuring closely spaced PVC foam ribs (usually on 4\\" centers) bonded to an aluminum wing spar, to which was bonded a thin aluminum skin. The closely spaced ribs, combined with similarly-spaced foam interstitials, resulted in a cellular structure that yields great strength and stiffness with low weight. The HP-16 wing spars were made in inboard and outboard sections, each 12 feet (3.66 m) long, and each machined to an I-beam cross-section from billets of solid 7075-T6 aluminum and then spliced together to yield a 7.5m wing panel spar. The machining of these aluminum I beams would have been cost-prohibitive under normal circumstances, but was accomplished as something of a personal challenge by Schreder's friend John Mazur at his shop in Long Island, New York. Following the HP-16, Schreder set to work on the RS-15, which combined the HP-16 wings and a new pod-and- boom fuselage. This ship was the only Schreder sailplane design to be named outside the HP nomenclature. The RS stood for Richard Schreder, and the 15 for its fifteen meters of span. With his following design, the HP-17, Schreder developed a new, more cost-effective method for making wing spars. These spars featured a rectangular box section consisting of machined C-channels for the upper and lower caps, joined by shear web panels riveted to the flanges of the spar cap channels. These channels were again manufactured by Mazur, and were carefully made so that the floor of the channel tapers in thickness from 3/8\\" at the root to 1/16\\" at the tip. It is not known whether the HP-17 actually flew, but the wing spars that Schreder developed for it found good use on Schreder's next and most popular kit sailplane, the HP-18. First flown in 1974, the HP-18 was available in kit form in 1975, and in 1976 was featured in a series of six articles in Soaring Magazine that described every detail of its construction. In the spirit of the Popular Mechanics article from which Schreder built his first glider at age 9, the Soaring articles reproduced the HP-18 plans and assembly instructions in sufficient detail for a resourcful and mechanically-inclined individual to build the aircraft almost from scratch. However, most builders found it easier to purchase the HP-18 kit and its full-size plans from Bryan Aircraft. Through the 1970s, homebuilt sailplanes including Schreder's kits fell somewhat into decline with the rise in performance and popularity of imported European composite sailplanes. Although the HP-18 was his most popular offering, it was also the last of Schreder's kit sailplanes. After the HP-18, Schreder tried his hand at manufacturing carbon-fiber composite wing spars, and abandoned it as too troublesome after making the one set, which was used by Henry Preiss to complete the one-off HP-19. Schreder's HP-20 combined the HP-19 fuselage with an innovative new wing spar consisting of leaves of aluminum laminated and bonded together under pressure. The HP-21 was intended to be a variable- geometry self-launching sailplane based on the RS-15 fuselage and featuring retractable sailcloth wing extensions along the inboard trailing edges of its constant-chord wing, but was abandoned before completion. The HP-22 was to be a 2-seat amphibious sailplane, again self-launching, but was abandoned after the wings and most of the fuselage hull were completed.Homebuilder News, Soaring Magazine, Volume 46, Number 8 page 11, August 1982.

Soaring Society of America, USPS 499-920 Later years In the period following the HP-18's heyday, Schreder also spent a great deal of time attempting to develop a lightweight jet engine for small aircraft. Schreder envisioned such a powerplant as being ideal for self-launching sailplanes. His first attempts featured pulsejet engines with their bodies contained within the blades of a propeller, and exhausting through nozzles deflected 90 degrees so as to cause the propeller to spin. Though some success was attained, Schreder found difficulty in containing the internal pressures so as to prevent the engine bodies from reverting to round cross-section. Also, these engines were quite loud and not very fuel-efficient. Schreder died in 2002 from complications of kidney failure.\\"Richard Schreder, 1915-2002,\\" Toledo Blade Obituaries, section B, page 4, column 6 (https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1350&dat;=20020805&id;=NVhPAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=1gMEAAAAIBAJ&pg;=5155,1511365&hl;=en) References See also *Homebuilt aircraft Category:1915 births Category:2002 deaths Category:American aerospace engineers Category:Glider pilots Category:People from Bryan, Ohio Category:Recipients of the Distinguished Flying Cross (United States) Category:Schreder aircraft Category:Lilienthal Gliding Medal recipients Category:People from Tecumseh, Michigan Category:Glider flight record holders Category:American aviation record holders Category:Glider manufacturers Category:Engineers from Ohio Category:20th-century American engineers ","title":"Richard Schreder"},{"id":"6687499","text":"Fire station in the village Horní Třešňovec (German: Ober-Johnsdorf) is a town in the Ústí nad Orlicí District, Pardubice Region of the Czech Republic.

Thus Qu poems are lyrics with lines of varying longer and shorter lengths, set according to the certain and specific, fixed patterns of rhyme and tone of conventional musical pieces upon which they are based and after which these matched variations in lyrics (or individual Qu poems) generally take their name.Yip, 306-308 The fixed-tone type of verse such as the Qu and the ci together with the shi and fu forms of poetry comprise the three main forms of Classical Chinese poetry. Names and types In Chinese literature, the Qu () form of poetry from the Yuan Dynasty may be called Yuanqu (元曲 P: Yuánqǔ, W: Yüan-ch'ü). Qu may be derived from Chinese opera, such as the Zaju (雜劇), in which case these Qu may be referred to as sanqu (散曲). Sanqu The San in Sanqu refers to the detached status of the Qu lyrics of this verse form: in other words, rather than being embedded as part of an opera performance the lyrics stand separately on their own. Since the Qu became popular during the late Southern Song Dynasty, and reached a special height of popularity in the poetry of the Yuan Dynasty, therefore it is often called Yuanqu (元曲), specifying the type of Qu found in Chinese opera typical of the Yuan Dynasty era. Both Sanqu and Ci are lyrics written to fit a different melodies, but Sanqu differs from Ci in that it is more colloquial, and is allowed to contain Chenzi (襯字 \\"filler words\\" which are additional words to make a more complete meaning). Sanqu can be further divided into Xiaoling (小令) and Santao (散套), with the latter containing more than one melody.

Biography =Early life= Memucan Hunt was born in 1729 in Virginia. =Career= He moved to Granville County (now Vance), where he became a planter. He owned nearly 16,000 acres (65 km²) of land, 22 slaves, two horses, four mares, 14 head of cattle and 33 hogs.Powell, William S. Dictionary of North Carolina Biography, Vol. III. Chapel Hill: The University of North Carolina Press, 1988, p. 232. At the age of 41, in 1770, Hunt was chosen Sergeant-at-Arms of the Province of North Carolina House of Burgesses and in 1773 was elected as Representative to the Assembly from Granville County. When the spirit of independence began to rise in the colony, Hunt represented Granville County in the five Provincial Congresses. In 1777, with the War for Independence underway, the fiscal needs of the colony were among its greatest concerns. Hunt was appointed Treasurer of the Hillsborough district, one of six district treasurers in the State at that time. He continued to hold office in the North Carolina General Assembly and in 1779 was elected to the State Senate, serving as a member of the Committee of Accounts. In November 1783, the General Assembly, in session at New Bern, abolished the district treasurer offices and established the singular fiscal position of State Treasurer and elected Hunt to fill the post. He took office on January 1, 1784, at a salary of 500 pounds per year. During his term in office, he unwittingly honored fraudulent claims for military service stemming from the Revolutionary War (paying too generously soldiers who had fought in the Revolutionary War, and in some cases, paying soldiers who had not fought at all), which resulted in both litigation and hearings by the General Assembly. While he was not charged with malfeasance, he was defeated for re-election in 1787 by John Haywood. Hunt retired from politics to Granville County, where he became a wealthy planter and served as justice of the peace until 1792. =Death= He died in 1808.

The company partners with more than 607,000 contracted providers and employs more than 14,000 associates. Wellcare began operations in 1985 and is based in Tampa, Florida. It is a subsidiary of Centene Corporation. Wellcare Health Plans, Inc. is the holding company for several subsidiaries, including WellCare, Meridian Health Plan, Staywell Health Plan, 'Ohana Health Plan, Care1st Health Plan Arizona and Missouri Care, among others. Regional offices are located in Tampa, Atlanta, New York, Chicago, Detroit, Phoenix, Houston, Omaha and St. Louis, among others. History A WellCare bus in Astoria, Queens, New York City. Wellcare began operations in 1985 in Tampa, Florida as a Medicaid provider for the State of Florida. With the passage of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, WellCare began offering Medicare beneficiaries private health insurance plans. These programs were known as Medicare+Choice or Part C plans. In 2003, WellCare began offering Medicare Advantage plans with prescription drug benefits after the signing of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act. In 2004, it became a public company via an initial public offering. In 2006, Wellcare began offering Medicare Medicare Part D plans and has since become one of the top 10 Part D insurance providers by membership volume for these types of plans. In November 2013, WellCare appointed Chairman David Gallitano to serve as interim CEO while conducting a national search for a permanent replacement. The new executive team changed the company's focus towards health plan members instead of simply meeting quarterly earnings projections. Gallitano increased spending on technology and replaced the main campus \\"Ikea\\"-like artwork with photographs and portraits representing its 3.5 million health plan members, including those who suffer from chronic conditions, ailments, and social difficulties, such as cancer, homelessness, mental illness, and hunger. In December 2014, WellCare appointed Kenneth Burdick to be its new CEO and board member. Burdick had joined WellCare as national health plans president in January 2014 and was promoted to president and COO in July 2014. Burdick previously had served as CEO at Blue Cross Blue Shield of Minnesota and CEO of the Medicaid division at Coventry. In September 2017, WellCare announced a refreshed corporate rebrand that focused on holistic health and uses the tagline \\"Beyond Healthcare: A Better You.\\" The corporate logo would remain blue but in order to distinguish WellCare from other healthcare companies, its formal communication would now use an orange color scheme. In October 2017, WellCare announced a deal to include UNC Health Alliance primary care physicians and specialists into its Medicare Advantage network. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) awarded WellCare a 4 out of 5 star rating for Plan Year 2018 Medicare plans for quality and care. In January 2018, WellCare announced the company will use the care management platform of VirtualHealth for population health management in 20 states. In January 2018, Fortune magazine named WellCare as one of World's Most Admired Companies. In January 2020, the company was acquired by Centene CorporationCentene Press release for more than $17 billion. Centene has said \\"its proposed acquisition of WellCare will give the combined company 22 million members in all 50 states and combined revenue approaching $100 billion.\\" Acquisitions Since late 2012, WellCare has acquired many smaller Medicare & Medicaid supplement providers that has significantly expanded the company's national coverage areas: * November, 2012: Easy Choice Health Plan in California * February, 2013: UnitedHealthcare's Medicaid business in South Carolina * April, 2013: Missouri Care, Incorporated * September, 2013: Purchase of Windsor Health Group (primarily in Mississippi, Tennessee, Arkansas, and South Carolina) was announced, anticipated to be completed in FQ4, 2013. * November, 2016: Universal American. * January, 2017: Care1st Health Plan Arizona, formerly a subsidiary of Care1st Health Plan, a Blue Shield of California affiliate. * May 2017: Phoenix Health Plan, formerly a subsidiary of Abrazo Community Health Network, a subsidiary of Tenet Healthcare * September, 2018: Meridian Health Plans, Detroit, Michigan * 2019: Aetna's Medicare prescription insurance business, as a condition of CVS Health's acquisition of Aetna. 2007 Florida Investigations On October 24, 2007, law enforcement agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Department of Health and Human Services, and the Florida Attorney General's Medicaid Fraud Control Unit executed a search warrant on the premises of WellCare Health Plans' headquarters in Tampa, FL. Trading on WellCare's stock was halted on the news but subsequently fell as low as 80% below the 52-week high. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has WellCare's financials under watch and several class-action lawsuits were launched against WellCare on behalf of shareholders. WellCare has said that its normal business operations have not been affected by the federal and state investigations, and that it remains financially sound, with over $1 billion in cash and cash equivalents. In a now-unsealed plea agreement, prosecutors and a former employee said the company inflated expenditures by submitting fake documents to the state. Under some mental health care contracts, WellCare was paid a flat per-patient fee and required to spend at least 80% of it on care. Any leftover amount beyond 20 percent was to be repaid to the state, but the bogus expenditures allowed WellCare to keep that surplus. WellCare agreed in August to repay $35 million, its best estimate of the total wrongly kept from 2002-2006. After the raid, the company restated its quarterly and annual profits, driving down net income by $32 million, and saw its top three executives resign. No criminal charges have been announced against WellCare or its officials but investigations by Florida, Connecticut, and federal prosecutors are ongoing. The Securities and Exchange Commission is leading an informal investigation, and Wellcare faces numerous shareholder lawsuits and sealed whistleblower complaints, the company's SEC filings say. WellCare has since halted all Florida campaign contributions.Travis Reed, Associated Press Writer AP: In Medicaid reform, Fla.

The exemption is found in Schedule 7AC of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992. The rationale for the exemption is that groups of companies should be able to restructure without having to concern themselves with taxation of capital gains. Other European jurisdictions apply a more comprehensive system. For example, in Luxembourg and the Netherlands as well as in Germany and Belgium, both capital gains derived from, as well as dividend income earned on, qualifying shares are (mostly) exempt from further local taxation. These comprehensive systems are generally referred to as participation exemption systems.

Its name in English means \\"the time before Lent\\". The celebration corresponds to Roman Catholic holiday traditions in other parts of the world, such as Mardi Gras, Shrove Tuesday, and Carnaval. Užgavėnės begins on the night before Ash Wednesday, when an effigy of winter (usually named Morė) is burnt. A major element of the holiday, meant to symbolize the defeat of winter in the Northern Hemisphere, is a staged battle between Lašininis (\\"porky\\") personifying winter and Kanapinis (\\"hempen man\\") personifying spring. Devils, witches, goats, the grim reaper, gypsies, and other joyful and frightening characters appear in costumes during the celebrations. The participants and masqueraders dance and eat the traditional dish of the holiday - pancakes with a variety of toppings. In Lithuania's capital Vilnius, the celebration takes place on Gediminas Avenue, as well as at many youth organizations. The festival is a major event at Rumšiškės open-air ethnographic museum. Participants traditionally dress and act as Romani people and Jews, wearing masks with grotesque features, beards and visible ear locks and engaging in peddling and stereotypically Jewish speech. http://forward.com/news/12634/jews-parade-on-the-streets-of- vilna-01253/http://www.ibtimes.com/nazi-inspired-anti-semitic-imagery-used- promote-lithuanian-festival-sparks-outrage-2505357 See also * Meteņi * Maslenitsa References External links * City of Vilnius: Traditional Holidays for City Inhabitants and City Guests * Danutė Brazytė, 1989.

Most issues were edited by Marschall. The title was taken from the classic comic strip Little Nemo. While some issues were thematic, most were a mix of articles, interviews, comic strip reprints and more. Marschall later went on to co-found another magazine about comics, Hogan's Alley. Nemo Bookshelf During that same period in the 1980s, Fantagraphics launched an imprint, Nemo Bookshelf, the Classic Comics Library.

It is an east-west route running roughly through midtown Pensacola and West Pensacola. Locally, it is known as Michigan Avenue, Beverly Parkway, Brent Lane, Bayou Boulevard, and Perry Avenue. The western terminus of SR 296 is at U.S. Route 90 (US 90; Mobile Highway). Westward of this intersection, County Road 296 (Saufley Field Road) connects to State Road 173\\\\. The eastern terminus of State Road 296 is again at US 90, this time in eastern Pensacola, where it is known as Cervantes Street.  Route description  State Road 296 begins at an intersection with U.S. Route 90 (Mobile Highway (State Road 10A)) in Bellview, Florida, as a continuation of County Road 296 (Saufley Field Road), which runs from State Road 173 to the Mobile Highway intersection. State Road 296 heads eastward from U.S. Route 90 as West Michigan Avenue through a four-lane commercial neighborhood. This continues for a couple miles before entering a residential neighborhood just east of Esperanto Road. Passing near Crescent Lake, State Road 296 turns to the northeast and soon to the east before Pipeline Road, where the road turns to the southeast and changes names to Beverly Parkway. After the name change, the road crosses a freight railroad crossing and enters Brent, where it intersects with County Road 453 (NW Street). The highway expands to four lanes and becomes commercial, entering an intersection with U.S. Route 29 (State Road 85, Old Palafox Highway). At that intersection, State Road 296 changes names to Brent Lane and soon crosses over freight tracks on a viaduct. Just after the viaduct, the highway passes the Pensacola Christian College and enters a modified diamond interchange with Interstate 110 (I-110; State Road 8A). From there, State Road 296 intersects with State Road 291 (North Davis Highway) in Pensacola and turns to the northeast as Brent Lane. At the intersection with Springhill Drive, State Road 296 turns southeastward and changes names to Bayou Boulevard. The road passes to the south of Sacred Heart Hospital and intersects with State Road 289\\\\. Passing a campus of the University of Florida, the route turns southeastward through a commercial neighborhood of Pensacola. Entering the Cordova Park neighborhood, State Road 296 becomes primarily residential for several miles, until DuPort Road, where it turns southeastward along Bayou Texar.

It grew out of existing initiatives like Friends of Soviet Russia in the United States, the Association of Friends of the New Russia in Germany, and the Hands Off Russia campaign that had emerged during the early 1920s in Great Britain and elsewhere. Organizational history =Establishment= In 1927 the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics celebrated the 10th Anniversary of the Russian Revolution with much fanfare. Supporters of the Soviet Union flocked to Moscow to attend the official Revolution Day festivities slated for November 7. The Communist International decided to make use of this opportunity to bring together representatives of the various national \\"friendship societies,\\" centralizing their activities in a single international organization to be known as the International Association of Friends of the Soviet Union.Louis Nemzer, \\"The Soviet Friendship Societies,\\" Public Opinion Quarterly vol. 13, no. 2 (Summer 1949), pg. 266. An organizing committee for the new association was named, with representatives of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Communist Party of Great Britain playing a leading role. The founding congress of FSU was held at the House of the Trade Unions in Moscow November 10–12, 1927. 917 delegates from 40 countries assisted the conference.Raymond van Diemel, \\"I have seen the new Jerusalem\\"According to another source, the congress was attended by 947 delegates from 43 countries.J.

Carter edited News-Facts About the USSR from 1950 to 1956 and the pro-Soviet glossy magazine Northern Neighbours from 1956 to 1989. The CSFS succeeded the National Council for Canadian Soviet Friendship, which had been founded during World War II to support the USSR as a war ally. Earlier, a Canadian branch of the American based Friends of Soviet Russia had also existed from the mid-1920s to the late 1930s. In 1960, the CSFS became the USSR-Canada Friendship Association. It was led by Leslie Hunt and then, after 1972, Michael Lucas. After the fall of the Soviet Union, Lucus founded the Canadian Friends of Soviet People as a successor organization. Its journal, the Northstar Compass, was published from 1992 until 2017. Lucas is also the founder and leader of the International Council for Friendship and Solidarity with the Soviet People, which is intended to be a successor organization to the International Association of Friends of the Soviet Union. =Mexico= Poster for meeting commemorating the 51st death anniversary of Karl Marx.

It was ultimately outlawed in November of the same year by the Gheorghe Tătărescu cabinet, and was succeeded by the Society for Maintaining Cultural Links between Romania and the Soviet Union, created in May 1935 and itself outlawed in 1938. Various attempts to build on the Amicii URSS legacy during World War II remained unsuccessful, but after the start of Soviet occupation, in November 1944, the Romanian Society for Friendship with the Soviet Union (ARLUS) was founded. It survived as an officially-endorsed cultural institution during the early stages of the Communist regime, but was disbanded in 1964, when the Romanian Communist leader Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej announced a \\"national path to communism\\" and proceeded to distance himself from the Soviet Union. =South Africa= The FSU established a branch in South Africa, to which non-communist were invited to join. In March 1934, the FSU took part in the formation of the League against Fascism and War along with the Communist Party, Labour Party members, trade unionists, etc. During the Second World War the FSU campaigned for support for the Soviet war effort. During the early 1940s, the FSU made significant inroads amongst the Indian community. =Spain= Amigos de la Union Sovietica (AUS) was founded in 1925.

A section of its members, including Trettondal, formed the association Sovjet-Nytt.Mölndals stadsbibliotek - Mölndals tredje bibliotek =United States of America= In the United States the Friends of Soviet Russia was formally established in August 1921 with Alfred Wagenknecht serving as the group's first Executive Secretary. With the establishment of the new international association the name of the organization was changed to the Friends of the Soviet Union. The organization published a monthly magazine entitled Soviet Russia Today.

Its natural range covers Cambodia and Thailand, and stretches from the Malay Peninsula to Indonesia, where it is present on the islands of Borneo and Sumatra. Plants reported from India and Sri Lanka have thinner indusia and may represent a separate, as-yet undescribed, species. A. latebrosa grows in a wide range of habitats, including forest, secondary forest, and plantations, from sea level up to an elevation of about 1500 m. Description The trunk of Alsophila latebrosa is erect and usually grows to a height of 3–4 m. Fronds may be bi- or tripinnate and are about 2 m long. They are lighter in colouration underneath and form a sparse, feathery crown. The stipe is reddish-brown, spiny, and bears some scales near the base. These scales are dark, glossy, and have fragile edges. Stipes may be retained in younger plants, forming a characteristic messy skirt around the trunk. Sori occur near the fertile pinnule midvein. They are protected by small, bilobed indusia that are scale-like in appearance. A. latebrosa is a variable tree fern. Large and Braggins (2004) note that it forms part of a complex of species that is not fully understood. A. latebrosa appears to be most closely related to Alsophila incisoserrata, from which it differs in pinnule morphology and in not having scales throughout the length of the stipe. Cultivation In cultivation, this species does best in warmer climates and is not tolerant of frost. Plants should be provided with a plentiful supply of moisture and grown in well-drained humus.

It lies along the eastern coastline of Bon Secour Bay (a contiguous bay that sits along the eastern edge of Mobile Bay). Bon Secour is over due east of the Alabama-Mississippi state line, near Gulf Shores, and over west of Pensacola, Florida. The name \\"Bon Secour\\" derives from the French phrase meaning \\"safe harbor\\" due to the secluded location on the inside coast of the Fort Morgan peninsula of southern Alabama.\\"Bon Secour National Wildlife Refuge\\" (2006-08-18), US Fish and Wildlife Service, web: FWS-Gov-BSNWR. Bon Secour lies on the Bon Secour River. Elevation is above sea level.

The estimated population of the town is 743 in 2010, \\"Best Places to Live in Bon Secour (zip 36511), Alabama\\", BestPlaces.net, July 2010, webpage: BPlaces-11. up from 302 in 2000 (see detailed Demographics below). However, since Hurricane Ivan, single-family housing developments and the population have continued to grow. It is part of the Daphne-Fairhope-Foley micropolitan area. Bon Secour is sometimes mentioned in hurricane report statistics, for the region, since Bon Secour is the easternmost town inside the coastline of Mobile Bay when entering the bay from the south, indicating weather and tide conditions for the population at the southeast end of Mobile Bay, nearest the entrance to the Gulf of Mexico. By contrast, Mobile, Alabama is located near the (diagonally opposite) north end of Mobile Bay, much farther from the Gulf tide and hurricane storm surges.  History  Bon Secour has a rich history. It was originally a French fishing village settlement dating back to the late 19th century. Currently it is a Southern Gothic, waterfront community that serves as a safe harbor to a current commercial fishing fleet. Named by Jacques Cook, a French Canadian from Montreal, a member of Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville's colonizing expedition of 1699. He was a participant in the founding of Mobile in 1702. There are several major seafood industry businesses currently operating out of the Bon Secour estuary. Bon Secour Fisheries, Safe Harbor Seafood, Aquilla Seafood and Billy's Seafood all ship large quantities of Gulf of Mexico seafood to all areas of the United States. Bon Secour Fisheries is the oldest and biggest of them all, having been operating since the 1890s. The primary catch for the Bon Secour fishing fleet ranges from Mobile Bay shrimp to deep water \\"Royal Red\\" shrimp. Large shrimp boats line the shores of the Bon Secour River, docked at processing plants for packaging and shipment to all of America. One main point of pride within the community is the \\"Alabama Wild Shrimp Program\\". Because wild shrimp caught by the local fleet must compete with farmed shrimp from overseas, economic pressures have driven many, multi-generational shimpers out of the business. As a result, the local shimpers, along with shrimpers out of the Mobile area have formed an alliance, increased their marketing, public relations knowledge and efforts to brand Alabama, Wild Caught Shrimp. Their efforts have paid off. Marine science has indeed proven that wild-caught shrimp from local waters are in fact less likely to contain contaminates than the farm-raised shrimp that have been imported from other countries. Still, the commercial shrimping industry in Bon Secour is hanging on by a very thin line. Bon Secour is characterized by a coastal, Southern Gothic scenery with huge water oak trees covered in Spanish moss, great blue herons, brown pelicans, ever present bottle-nosed dolphin pods and the potent smell of salty gulf waters everywhere. The local commercial fisherman that make their living from the Gulf are no less salty but also friendly. Other than the relatively small, family owned, seafood processing plants, Bon Secour is primarily made up of many rural neighborhoods, most of which enjoy beautiful vistas of the Bon Secour River and Bon Secour Bay. Brown Pelicans are everywhere and locals often see alligators from time to time, plying the waters of the estuarial system from the head waters of the Bon Secour River to the bay. One can see baby bottle-nosed dolphins playing near the mouth of the river at any time. In Bon Secour one can catch bass, bream, fresh-water catfish, then travel a few miles down river, to the bay and catch all manner of salt water fish, shrimp, and oysters in the same day. Homes in the Bon Secour area are some of the oldest along the eastern Alabama Gulf Coast. With the arrival of the current development boom, post Hurricane Ivan, property/houses in the area range anywhere from US$100,000 dollars for an older, inland house, to over several million dollars for a brand new mansion on the Bon Secour River banks or Bon Secour Bay. New, affluent, gated communities are growing. Those with the financial resources can purchase pristine, unadulterated land with million- dollar views of a wonderful ecosystem, complete with access to Mobile Bay, the Intracoastal Waterway, and the maritime travel opportunities that such waterways provide. All that is needed is a yacht and the means to travel anywhere the Intracoastal waterway extends. One can go from their own dock in Bon Secour, Alabama to Ft. Lauderdale, Florida by water. Boaters can circumnavigate the island or even pursue a trans-Gulf crossing, with a big enough vessel and enough seamanship experience for the voyage. Some local vessels have been known to travel from the Alabama Gulf Coast, across the Gulf of Mexico and Bay of Campeche to Cozumel (Mexico), Playa del Carmen, Cancún, etc. Many seabirds, tree frogs and other natural fauna still live in the area of the pristine environment that is Bon Secour. = Hurricanes = The location of Bon Secour on the northern coast of the Gulf of Mexico makes it especially vulnerable to hurricanes: * In September 1979, Bon Secour received the full brunt of Category 3 Hurricane Frederic, which leveled most of the beachfront of the town. * In September 2004, category 3 Hurricane Ivan made landfall only a few miles from Bon Secour, causing extensive wind and flooding damage. Nearby Orange Beach suffered even greater damage from its location east of Ivan's eyewall. Over 800 homes (mainly condominiums) were destroyed by Ivan. * Hurricane Katrina (August 29, 2005) flooded Bon Secour with a large storm tide, which had extended over eastward from the eye, also flooding the Florida Panhandle (such as Navarre Beach). Waves near Bon Secour were 22-feet (6.7 m) high, in Mobile Bay. = 2010 Gulf Oil Spill = The 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill drastically reduced the availability of Gulf shrimp, so many people lost their jobs with the fishing industry. In June 2010, oil globs and submerged oil began washing ashore on the beaches of the Bon Secour National Wildlife Refuge, killing many fish and crabs.

Climate Bon Secour enjoys a very mild climate throughout the year. High temperatures in the winter average around 65 degrees; summer-time high temperatures average around 87. Bon Secour also averages of rainfall per year. Regional The Bon Secour National Wildlife Refuge (NWR) is not really located in Bon Secour, but nearby, along Ft. Morgan Road, on the island, over the Intracoastal Waterway bridge. The Bon Secour NWR consists of over of wildlife habitat lying directly west of Gulf Shores, Alabama, on the Fort Morgan peninsula (western sliver of the island) formed by the Intracoastal Waterway, Oyster Bay, Bon Secour Bay, and Mobile Bay. The refuge was established by the United States Congress in 1980 to provide habitat for non- game birds migrating south in the fall and north in the spring. The migration paths from Bon Secour lead south to lower Florida, the Caribbean, Mexico and Central America. The Bon Secour refuge also serves as one of the largest undeveloped parcels of land on the Alabama coast, with sand dunes which are a reminder of the Gulf Coast, as it formerly existed. Consequently, the Bon Secour National Wildlife Refuge has been named among the ten natural wonders of Alabama. It has become a birding Mecca.

The third movement, Allegro brillante, caps the piece in an exciting manner. The concerto was first recorded in 1945, by Moura Lympany with the London Symphony Orchestra under Anatole Fistoulari, and again the following year by William Kapell with the Boston Symphony Orchestra under Serge Koussevitzky. The Kapell recording became a jukebox favourite, and Kapell was so associated with the work that he was often called \\"Khachaturian Kapell\\". Moura Lympany and Anatole Fistoulari recorded the work again in the mid 1950s. Since then it has been recorded by, among others, Lev Oborin, Oscar Levant, Peter Katin, Boris Berezovsky, Mindru Katz, Dora Serviarian Kuhn, Constantine Orbelian, Alicia de Larrocha, Leonard Pennario, Lorin Hollander and Alberto Portugheis. The work is scored for 2 flutes, 2 oboes, 2 clarinets, bass clarinet, 2 bassoons, 4 horns, two trumpets, three trombones, tuba, timpani, percussion, and strings.

It is located south of downtown Dayton, Ohio, just north of the University of Dayton campus and Woodland Cemetery, and east of Miami Valley Hospital. Mainly residential in character, South Park is significant because of the variety of its architecture, which includes vernacular, cottage, and high style examples, and because of its association with John H. Patterson, founder of the National Cash Register Company.  Slidertown and Patterson  Children in the gardens of the National Cash Register Company When Patterson began to develop his factory complex on South Main Street, the area now called South Park was a neighborhood of shacks and shanties called Slidertown. Patterson began to have trouble with boys from Slidertown who broke the glass windows on his new factory, and so, determined to give the boys something else to do by sponsoring community gardens and other beautification projects for the neighborhood. Eventually South Park developed into a pleasant, garden-filled community where factory workers lived side by side with supervisors and Patterson's right-hand men. The late Frederick Law Olmsted, walking along the streets of this quarter, declared that, considering the size of the lots, it was the most beautiful street he had ever seen. Until the advent of the automobile enabled NCR workers to move further afield, the neighborhood continued to be associated with Patterson's firm, and many company picnics and other functions took place on Park Drive Boulevard in the heart of the district. Historic district Boundaries of the historic district On August 23, 1984, South Park was registered on the National Register of Historic Places, bounding streets Park Dr., Morton Ave., Hickory St., and Wayne Ave. (No. 84003794). On July 16, 1988, this expanded to encompass Wyoming St., Nathan Pl., Oak St., Alberta St. and Blaine St. (No. 88000857). City of Dayton Ordinance #26219. In 2007, South Park was chosen by the Dayton chapter of the American Institute of Architects as its community partner. This resulted in the creation of housing designs and landscaping concepts consistent with South Park's participation in Rehabarama in both 2001 and 2007. Actor Martin Sheen was born in Dayton and raised in the South Park neighborhood on Brown Street.  Architecture  = Structures = The architecture of South Park includes examples of Second Empire, High Victorian Italianate, Queen Anne, Federal and Romanesque Revival in one- and two-story structures of brick and frame. South Park still preserves a sense of close-knit neighborhood whose residents cooperate to maintain the many neighborhood parks which give the district its special flavor. = Landscape = Commissioned by Patterson, John Charles Olmsted was responsible for the layout of Park Drive's landscape. This boulevard once adorned a fountain centerpiece and waterway running through its middle.

Caniff left the strip in late 1934 to work on Terry and the Pirates, which followed the same theme of boy hero with two- fisted adult mentor. Caniff's last credited strip ran December 1, 1934. = Subsequent creators = 250px Coulton Waugh began drawing Dickie Dare in the middle of a story, and drew the strip for almost ten years, ending on February 26, 1944. In 1944, Waugh left to work on another strip, his wife and assistant, Odin Waugh, became the Dickie Dare illustrator from 1944 to 1948. Fran Matera took over the strip on March 8, 1948, and continued until the strip ended on October 12, 1957. During the 1930s and 1940s, Waugh worked at his studio located in suburban Newburgh, New York. Characters and story In July 1933, Caniff began the adventure-fantasy, Dickie Dare, influenced by series such as Flash Gordon and Brick Bradford. The eponymous central character was a 12-year-old who dreamed himself into adventures with such literary and legendary persons as Robin Hood, Robinson Crusoe and King Arthur. In the spring of 1934, Caniff changed the strip from fantasy to reality, adding a new character, Dan Flynn, a freelance writer and friend of Dickie's father. At this juncture, Dickie no longer dreamed his adventures but experienced them while touring the world with \\"Dynamite Dan\\" Flynn. The duo shared many adventures during the next couple of decades. After Waugh returned to the strip, he stayed on until it ended in 1957. In the final decade, Dickie aged from a 12-year-old to a Navy Cadet.

In the ring Cintrón was said to display particular grace, style and bravado, a combination known as duende. Background Cintrón was born in 1922 in Antofagasta, in northern Chile. Her father, Francisco Cintrón Ramos, was from Puerto Rico and the second Puerto Rican to graduate from West Point, Major General Luis R. Esteves being the first. After serving in the United States military he became a South American businessman. Her mother, Lola Kathleen Verrill, was an American of Irish ancestry.New York Times By the time she was three years old, the family had moved to Lima, Peru, where she grew up, learned to ride, and began her career as a bullfighter. In Lima, Cintrón rode her first pony at three, and joined the riding school of the Portuguese rejoneador Ruy da Cámara, an immigrant to Peru, at 11. Cámara also became her bullfighting teacher. She trained originally as a rejoneadora, a bullfighter from horseback. This is one form of bullfighting practiced in Portugal. Her career outside of Spain Cintrón first fought in public in the Plaza de Acho, in Lima, in January 1936. On July 31, 1938 she made her debut as a novillera, also in Lima. This event established her as a professional rejoneadora, a rare (but not unprecedented) honor for a woman. After a trip to Portugal, she was invited to perform in Mexico. She made her Mexico City debut at the Plaza del Toreo on August 20, 1938. She failed to kill her bull, but nevertheless was a great hit with the crowd and the taurine critics. She was reported to have \\"caused pandemonium in the stands\\". Cintrón was gored in 1940 in Mexico City, by the bull Chiclanero. She fainted and was taken to the infirmary, but refused surgery and returned to the ring. There with one quick thrust she dispatched the bull and collapsed. From her Mexico City debut in 1938 through the 1940s, Cintrón was a big draw on the bullfighting circuit, in Mexico, Portugal, France, Ecuador, Venezuela, Colombia, and Spanish Morocco. She even fought once in the United States, near San Francisco, in a corrida in which the bull was not allowed to be killed. Career Poster of Conchita Cintron. Cintrón also fought in Spain, but there were laws there intended to ban female bullfighters. The laws, however, specified only the Spanish form of bullfighting, in which the bull is killed from on foot, not from horseback. Thus it was legal for her to fight there as a rejoneadora, but not as a matadora. (In other countries she did fight as a matadora.) Her popularity in Spain was also great, and eventually officials there found ways around the laws; she did sometimes fight on foot at charity events not open to the public. Her official presentation in Spain was in Seville on April 23, 1945. The Spanish prohibition against women matadors was said to be motivated more by the possibility they would have to be partially uncovered before the crowd in the event of a cornada (goring) than as a precaution for their safety (this was during the government of Francisco Franco). Cintrón intended the final corrida of the 1949 season, in Jaén, Spain, to be the last of her career. She appeared in the ring together with the matadors Manolo Vázquez and Antonio Ordóñez. After performing on horseback with the bull, Cintrón rode to the box of the presidente and asked for permission to dismount for the kill. Permission was denied. This was her signal to leave the arena, and leave the killing of the bull to the novillero assigned to her for that task. Instead, she dismounted, grabbed his sword and muleta, caped the bull and prepared it for the kill. She actually went in for the kill and then dramatically let the sword drop to the sand. The bull charged. Cintrón stepped from his path and simulated the kill by touching his shoulders with her fingers as he rushed by. Pandemonium erupted in the stands and the audience threw hats and red carnations at her feet. The novillero then entered the ring and performed the kill, as originally planned. Cintrón walked calmly away from the bull and was arrested as she left the ring, for violating the law banning women from fighting on foot. With the audience on the verge of rioting in protest of her arrest, the regional governor pardoned her and she was released. It was one of the most dramatic moments in bullfighting history. As Orson Welles wrote in the introduction to her memoirs, her career \\"ended in a single burst of glorious criminality. You can't keep a lady waiting forever, and there came an afternoon when she decided that she'd waited long enough.\\" Cintrón's final fight in Spain was on October 18, 1950. During her career she killed more than 750 bulls. Personal life In 1950, Cintrón married Francisco de Castelo Branco, a Portuguese nobleman, a nephew of her teacher, Ruy da Cámara, and settled in Portugal, acquiring Portuguese nationality. The couple had six children: *Pedro *Ana Mafalda *Ruy *Francisco *Fernando *João Later years In Portugal at Quinta do Índio, near Setúbal, Conchita dedicated herself to writing her memoirs, to journalism - being the Portuguese correspondente of several Latin American newspapers and the breeding of dogs primarily Portuguese Pointers with great success. In the early sixties the success of Quinta do Índio dogs caught the eye of Vasco Bensaúde, businessman, shipowner and dog breeder who had started 30 years earlier to save the Portuguese Water Dog from extinction in his Algarbiorum kennel. Not having heirs interested in the kennel, Bensaúde bequeathed it to Conchita Cintrón in 1967. Having registered the kennel with the name Al-Gharb, Conchita, taking advantage of her extensive contacts in North American high-society publicized the breed in the US with great success. In 1975 and as a consequence of the 25th of April Revolution, Quinta do Índio was occupied by workers and radical leftist supporters who drove out the family. Of the 32 existing water dogs only 15 were rescued 6 months later but in such a bad condition that all had to be euthanized. With the occupation of the property, Cintrón and family left Portugal and went into exile in Mexico until the end of the eighties. Cintrón died on February 17, 2009 from cardiac arrest in Lisbon, Portugal. She was buried in Trajouce, near Lisbon.

It takes place every August–September at the Oregon State Fairgrounds located in north Salem, the state capital, as it has almost every year since 1862. In 2006, responsibility for running the fair was delegated to the Oregon State Parks and Recreation Department, and the division is now known as the Oregon State Fair & Exposition Center (OSFEC), which holds events on the fairgrounds year-round. History Horse and buggy Oregon State Fairgrounds 1867 As Oregon agriculture expanded in the early 19th century many communities formed agricultural associations for the purpose of sharing information on farming practices and resources. These groups began to organize county fairs such as the Yamhill County Fair (1850). Shortly thereafter the Oregon Farmer newspaper began calling for a statewide fair. A group of farmers known as the Oregon Fruitgrowers Association organized the first unofficial state fair in 1858. That year is recognized as the official anniversary year of the fair. The fairgrounds circa 1881 In 1860, the association merged with other county groups and became the Oregon State Agricultural Society, who held the first official fair in 1861 in the Gladstone/Oregon City area. It was felt a larger area was needed and following a proposal by the Marion County Agriculture Society, the second official state fair was held in Salem in 1862 on the grounds of the Marion County Fair, where it has remained ever since. Homesteader John Savage donated of his land, which was three miles (5 km) outside of Salem at the time, while pioneer John Minto contributed $1,200 to build a wooden fence around the grounds. The fairgrounds were annexed into Salem in 1921. Aerial view of the 1967 fire The fair has been held every year on the same site, except in 1905, because the Lewis and Clark Centennial Exposition was taking place in Portland that year, and during the World War II years of 1943 and 1944; instead the fairgrounds were leased to military units as a place to bivouac. Also, although the 1942 fair was held, it was scaled back to only include 4-H displays, livestock exhibits, and displays from 27 Oregon counties, so it was not considered an official State Fair.. The fair was also canceled in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. =1967 Fire= In 1967, an arson occurred just before the opening of the fair, burning several large structures. Along with the fair commissioners, Governor Tom McCall felt the fair should go on, so many groups donated time and money for the cleanup and sent facilities like tents from as far away as the Portland Rose Festival so the fair could open. =National Register of Historic Places= The state fairground is the site of two historic buildings listed on the National Register of Historic Places: the Oregon State Fair Stadium and Poultry Building Ensemble. The 1919 horse stadium and the 1921 poultry building were added to the register in 2002. The poultry building is known for the \\"chicken head\\" relief sculptures that decorate the exterior. The horse stadium is the oldest state building in Oregon in continuous use. =Heritage oak grove= View of part of the 2016 state fair In 2007, a 200-year-old grove of Oregon White Oaks across the street from the main fairgrounds was designated by the Oregon Heritage Tree Committee as an Oregon Heritage Tree site. The grove was used as a camping and gathering place by the area's original inhabitants, the Kalapuya, who collected acorns and camas there. The site later became a camping place for fairgoers who originally arrived in wagons and created a tent city during the fair; the practice of camping in the grove continued into modern times. =Reorganization= Following a period of financial trouble, the Oregon Legislative Assembly directed the Oregon Parks and Recreation Department to take over management of the fair in 2006. As of 2008, the fair's slogan was: \\"It's like a magical enchanted land. Except real.\\" Events Through the years the fair has showcased Oregon crops and livestock, arts, and culture, and has hosted many food booths and vendors as well as judging competitions, horse racing and popular entertainers. In 2007 the fair hosted its first Lucha Libre (Hispanic wrestling) event. Facilities Outdoor concerts are held at the L. B. Day Amphitheatre, which was named in 1987 for L. B. Day, an Oregon State Senator and supporter of the fair. The Oregon State Fairgrounds Pavilion, completed in 2004, is the newest building on the fairgrounds. The 5,000-seat indoor pavilion is used year-round for a variety of events. The pavilion and parking replaced a badly deteriorated grandstand that was built in 1929, and the horse racing track. Architectural ornaments from the grandstand's facade were to be salvaged and incorporated into the replacement building. The Salem Armory Auditorium is located on a corner of the fairgrounds site, but is not affiliated with the State Fair. This concert venue is owned by the Oregon Military Department.

Market Street runs parallel with Ship Street to the south and Broad Street runs similarly to the north.  History  The street has had a number of names. It was known as Dewy's Lane in the 13th century, after a family who lived there. Its name was Somenor's Lane in 1385. For a time the street was known by the name of Lawrence Hall, which was on the south side of the street, 30–40 yards from Turl Street. The name of \\"Ship Street\\" was used from about 1762, after an alehouse in the street. At one time, there was a sheep market in the street and its name is a possible corruption of this. The street used to be much longer than it is today, running east through Catte Street to the city wall at Eastgate. St Anne's College, when it was still known as the Society of Oxford Home-Students, had its first common room at 16 Ship Street.

It is now called St. Brigid-St. Emeric Church.Bastone, Maria R., \\"Lower East Side Embraces Renovated St. Brigid-St. Emeric Church\\", Catholic New York, February 6, 2013  History  The parish was organized in 1847 by Rev. Richard Kein, pastor of the Church of the Nativity. Construction began in 1848 by Irish shipwrights for those fleeing the Great Irish Famine (1845-1849).David Scharfenberg, \\"Coming Back to Fight for the Church of Their Ancestors\\", The New York Times, June 18, 2006, Section 14, Page 6. The architect of the church was Patrick Keely, who handcarved the gothic reredos himself.Sarah Ferguson, \\"Secret Angel Still Wants to Save St. Brigid's\\", The Village Voice, August 3, 2006, via VillageVoice.com It was built by Irish boatwrights from the East River boatyards. The church was dedicated by Bishop John Hughes on December 2, 1849. Kein resigned the pastorate in 1852 due to poor health and was briefly succeeded by Thomas Martin O.P. Rev. Thomas J. Mooney was appointed pastor in 1853. \\"In its early years, St. Brigid’s served as a haven for Irish immigrants fleeing the famine, and later as a stalwart presence for the ever-changing immigrant populations to the neighborhood, from the Polish and Germans, to Ukrainians and Puerto Ricans.\\"Farley, Adam. \\"St. Brigid’s Catholic Church in the East Village Reopens\\", Irish America, April/May 2013 = Fr. Mooney and \\"the Fighting 69th\\"= The second pastor of the church, the Reverend Thomas Mooney, also served as chaplain to the nearby 69th New York State Militia. Upon its formation in 1851 it was called the 2nd Regiment of Irish Volunteers, a citizen-militia made up of Irish-Catholic diaspora from the Great Irish Famine. Father Mooney travelled with the 69th to Virginia and was beloved by the men for his spirit and sagacious counsel. Fr.Mooney held daily Masses for the regiment and served as confessor for the largely Catholic regiment. The regimental choir was headed by Capt. Maxwell O'Sullivan, formerly the choirmaster at St. Brigid's church. Mooney was lauded for his establishment of a temperance society and for encouraging many wayward souls to return to the Faith. Father Mooney was recalled by New York Archbishop John \\"Dagger\\" Hughes in response to Mooney's baptism of a 64 lb. Columbiad cannon. Archbishop Hughes later suggested that Mooney was recalled after climbing the flagstaff of Fort Corcoran. Mooney was in the process of straightening an American flag that became stuck during a flag raising ceremony. Mooney's return was much bemoaned by the men of the regiment, but Mooney was warmly welcomed on his return to the city by 4,000 parishioners assembled in Tompkins Square. During the New York City draft riots of July 1863, Mooney organized a neighborhood group to counter the federal troops sent to New York. When the 69th returned to New York following the Bull Run Campaign, Mooney marched at the head of the regiment. On August 14, 1861 a Requiem Mass was held for the men of the 69th NYSM who had been killed in action. The St. Brigid's choir sang Mozart's Requiem during the service. Fr. Mooney was conspicuously present at all future Irish Brigade functions and was much beloved by the men who survived to remember him.O'Flaherty, Rev. Patrick. History of the 69th New York State Militia. Doctoral Dissertation. Fordham University. New York. 1963. A special feature of the New York Times in 1901, mentioned the church among other Catholic structures in the Lower East Side of Manhattan, describing the group \\"for the most part...limit[ing] themselves to the functions of a parish church, in districts where social needs are otherwise supplied.\\" The article clarified that the upper church was Irish and the basement used by Italians. In addition, the Sisters of Charity had a convent next door to the church, and there was an attached parochial school.\\"Centres of Civilization; On the Lower East Side of New York\\", New York Times, Jul 21, 1901. Excerpt: “Everybody who read it must have been struck by a remark of Mr. Hewitt's, made not very long ago, touching the tenement house district, which was considerably commented on in the press. The remark was that it was not only the part of humanity and charity for the more favored to assist the less favored, but that in this particular case, it was not less the part of prudence…..St. Nicholas in Second Street, St. Rose of Lima in Cannon Street, and St. Teresa in Henry Street. There is also a remarkable church, remarkable for the ...”” = Fr. Kuhn and the Tompkins Square riot = From Avenue B During the 1988 Tompkins Square Park Riot, the church allowed homeless advocates and protesters of the police action to mobilize under its roof.George James, \\"Ward is Critical of Police in Clash\\", The New York Times, August 11, 1988; Section A, Page 1. A year later, when a shantytown in the park was dismantled, church pastor Rev. George Kuhn led a group of parishioners taking food to protesters and homeless people holed up in an abandoned school on East 4th Street. Father Kuhn was arrested when he defied orders not to cross a police line to deliver the food, saying, \\"I'm working under orders, too. The order I have is to feed the hungry, and that comes from a higher authority.\\"Jake Mooney, \\"When the Bell Tolls\\", The New York Times, March 20, 2005, Section 14, Page 1. St. Brigid's Church served as a place for protesters to organize and receive medical attention during the riot. = Closure and partial demolition = The church's main building closed in 2001 because of a crack in the building. The rear wall of the building had begun to pull away from the rest of the structure and the floor joists had separated several inches from the back wall. Mass was then held in the adjoining school while the parishioners rallied to raise money to save the church. In September 2003, the Archdiocese of New York filed with the city an application to convert the church into apartments, but an archdiocese spokesperson said was only protecting its options. In September 2004 the Archdiocese officially closed the church when the Trinitarian Order left. In 2006 demolition commenced, Archdiocesan spokesman Joe Zwilling stating: \\"It's a hazard. It could have literally fallen over at any point in time.\\" At that time, the spokesperson further stated that the property would not be turned into condominiums or apartments, (as nearby St. Ann's Church had been when it was converted into a dormitory for New York University). Zwilling said the church had no interest in selling the property. \\"It will be used for some other form of ministry, whether for educational or charitable or healthcare purposes, possibly senior housing,\\" said a spokesperson for the archdiocese. Ferguson, Sarah. \\"St. Brigid's: Archdiocese Says No Condos\\", The Village Voice, July 27, 2006, via VillageVoice.com. Some criticized the Archdiocese for what New York Times columnist Dan Barry called its \\"tone-deaf\\" handling of parishioner and community concern.Dan Barry, A Prayer For a Church Unsaved, The New York Times, July 30, 2006; Section B, Page 1. \\"Save St. Brigid\\" rally on August 24, 2006; later that day a judge stayed demolition of the historic church Earlier in 2006, Manhattan Supreme Court Justice Barbara Kapnick ruled against the Committee to Save St. Brigid's (CSSB) and allowed plans for demolition to proceed. In June, the New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division upheld that decision, Then in August Kapnick agreed to hear a separate suit in which the CSSB asserted that ownership and right to demolish are invalid due to the lack of a five-person board of trustees (including two parishioners) governing the church as required by New York law. The archdiocese said it convened such a board, in a meeting on July 18, where it agreed on demolition. The archdiocese also pointed out that the city did not question the church's ownership when they filed the building permits for demolition. On July 26, 2006, Judge Barbara Kapnick declined to halt demolition plans, but asked lawyers on both sides to appear in her courtroom to hear arguments on the building's ownership. Before those arguments were to take place, a demolition crew arrived. The destruction amounted to a hole in the rear wall, damage to the interior, and damage to at least one of the stained glass windows, the window depicting Jesus’ life which bore the names of victims of the Great Irish Famine and benefactors of the church.Peter McDermott, \\"Windows Smashed; Demolition Halted\\" , The Irish Echo, August 23–29, 2006, via IrishEcho.com. The following day workers wielding crowbars knocked out the stained glass windows on the north wall. Community leaders, among them St. Brigid's parishioner and City Councilmember Rosie Mendez, then-Manhattan Borough President Scott Stringer, State Senator Martin Connor, and Assemblywoman Sylvia Friedman, who made statements denouncing the demolition and accusing the Archdiocese of greed during an overheated real estate market.Michael Luo, \\"Demolition Starts at Historic Catholic Church in East Village\\", The New York Times, July 28, 2006; Section B, Page 2. A spokesperson for the Archdiocese said the demolition had nothing to do with money, again pointing out that there are no designs to sell the property. On August 24, 2006, Justice Kapnick extended an order staying the demolition of the church.Sarah Ferguson, \\"St. Brigid's Gets 2nd Reprieve\\", August 24, 2006, via VillageVoice.com. = Reopening = On May 22, 2008, the Archdiocese of New York announced it had received an “unexpected but very welcome gift” of $20 million from an anonymous donor after a private meeting with Cardinal Edward M. Egan, the archbishop of New York. The gift includes $10 million to restore the building itself; $2 million to establish an endowment for the parish “so that it might best meet the religious and spiritual needs of the people living in the community”; and $8 million to support St. Brigid’s School and other Catholic schools in need. Cardinal Egan further said in a statement: “This magnificent gift will make it possible for Saint Brigid’s Church to be fittingly restored with its significant structural problems properly addressed. The two additional gifts, to create an endowment for the parish and to support the parish school, are a powerful testament to the donor’s goodness and understanding. He has my heartfelt gratitude, as I recently told him at a meeting in my residence.”Chan, Sewell \\"Donor Gives $20 Million to Revive a Historic Church\\", May 22, 2008 The New York TimesSee also The New York Landmarks Conservancy, \\"Sacred Sites: Historic Catholic Churches in Crisis \\" (Retrieved 5 May 2011). On January 27, 2013, worshipers, including descendants of some of the original Irish parishioners, gathered as Timothy Michael Cardinal Dolan consecrated and dedicated the newly renovated building. With the restoration complete, the nearby church of St.Emeric on Avenue D was closed and the parish merged with St. Brigid. The name of the new parish is \\"St. Brigid-St. Emeric\\". = Closure of elementary school = In 2019, the Archdiocese of New York permanently closed church's elementary school.https://catholicschoolsny.org/st- brigid/https://www.asumag.com/facilities- managhttps://www.asumag.com/facilities-management/article/20856887/7-catholic- schools-in-the-new-york-archdiocese-will-close-at-the-end-of-the-school-year Architecture St. Brigid's was built in 1848 to a Carpenter Gothic design by twenty-five year old Patrick Keely, who carved the five-pinnacle reredos, organ case, and wooden altar himself. =Exterior= The brownstone church of St. Brigid’s has a tripartite front façade flanked by bell towers, which once supported spires. The two steeples were removed in 1962 due to safety concerns.\\"Church of St. Brigid\\", NYC AGO The wide center nave is vaulted with an unusual ceiling resembling an upside-down ship’s hull, a nod to the shipwright carpenters whose memory is preserved in corbels decorated with their sculpted faces.Gibson, David. “St. Brigid’s Parish: A Pilgrim Church for an Immigrant People\\", Catholics in New York: society, culture, and politics, 1808-1946, ed. Terry Golway, (New York: Fordham University Press, In 1877 the wooden beams of the towers, by then decayed and sagging, were replaced with iron. =Interior= The oil paintings of the stations of the cross, purchased in Paris in the 1870s, are believed to be the work of Théophile-Narcisse Chauvel. The stained glass windows were imported from Bavaria. It was at that time, a carved marble altar replaced the wooden one. The archdiocese hired Michael F. Doyle of the Acheson Doyle Partners architecture firm to supervise the renovations. Stucco was removed from the stone façade, the building's foundations stabilized, and the remaining stained glass windows returned from storage.Anderson, Lincoln. “St. Brigid’s work is more extensive than expected\\", The Villager, 18-24 November 2010 Additional stained glass was moved from St. Thomas the Apostle Church in Harlem, which had closed in 2003. The restoration received the 2013 Engineering New-Record Construction Award for best cultural/worship project, citing attention to detail.“Restoration is Salvation For St. Brigid’s Church\\", Engineering News-Record, 11 November 2013  School  St. Brigid's School The Rev. Thomas Mooney, pastor of St. Brigid's, founded the school in 1856 in the mostly Irish immigrant section of what was then called the Lower East Side. At first, classes were held in the basement of the church. The school building was built and dedicated in 1858 and was located on 8th Street between Avenues B and C. The Christian Brothers taught the boys of the school and the Sisters of Charity taught the girls. Soon after the founding of the school, Fr. Mooney asked the Sisters of Charity to open St. Brigid's Academy on 10th Street, an \\"excellent select school\\" with an average enrollment of 200 students.\\"A Sketch of the History of St. Bridget's Church,\\" Catholic News, 1877. In 1914 enrollment averaged 130 boys and 200 girls. By 1934, the conditions of the school building had become poor. Because of the Great Depression, the school was forced to closed. By the Post War Period of the 1950s, the parish population increased prompting the building of a new school building at 7th Street between Avenue B and C. The new building opened on September 12, 1954 with an enrollment of 124 students under the direction of the Sisters of Charity. The building was solemnly dedicated and blessed on November 6, 1955 by Francis Cardinal Spellman, Archbishop of New York. The old school building was demolished in 1970.St. Brigid's School: Illuminating the East Village, 2008. By the 1990s, the school was ailing: attendance had plummeted from 200 students to 74 in two years, and the number of teachers fell from nine to five.Monte Williams, \\"As Pontiff Visits, An Ailing School is Seeking Hope\\", The New York Times, October 8, 1995; Section 13, Page 6. Father Kuhn, who was the church's pastor at the time, attributed it to local poverty. However, others in the community reported as the cause anger by some local parents at Father Kuhn because in a dispute over direction and control of the parish school he fired the popular principal, Maureen Delaney, and three teachers in the middle of the school year. In the 1990s, the Sisters of Charity relinquished their ministry of the school. A spokeswoman for the Schools of the Archdiocese of New York stated in 1995: \\"The Cardinal believes very much in the school. We are all operating on the premise that St. Brigid will be with us for a while.\\" From 1995, the parish and school were staffed by the Trinitarians until the closing of the parish church in 2004. In 2006, the school started a Partnership Program with St. John's University in Literacy and Math. Within a year, the partnership yielded higher student test scores. As of 2010, the school had approximately 120 students enrolled. On July 15, 2019, the school closed permanently.

The son of Frederick and Harriet Colman who operated a shoe store on Hamilton Road in London, Ontario, Colman joined the London Majors of the senior Intercounty Baseball League in the mid-1930s (winning the batting title as a pitcher, Most Valuable Player award and a championship in 1936), the Pittsburgh Pirates as a first-baseman-outfielder from 1942 to 1946 and the New York Yankees as an outfielder in 1946 and 1947, where he roomed with the young Yankee catcher Yogi Berra. Colman batted and threw left, was six-feet tall and weighed 188 pounds. His debut in Major League Baseball was on September 12, 1942, and his final game in the big leagues was on August 3, 1947. With the 1947 Yankees In addition to Berra, Colman's teammates on the legendary 1947 Yankees included Joe DiMaggio, Phil Rizzuto, Allie Reynolds, Johnny Lindell, Charlie Keller, Tommy Henrich, Ralph Houk and Joe Page. Colman and Yogi Berra were teammates with the minor-league Newark, New York, Bears in 1946 and both were called up to the Yankees. In 1947, Colman opened the season as the starting right fielder with the Yankees but suffered a leg injury and underwent season-ending surgery. That would be his last season in the big leagues, although Colman did play two more seasons in 1949 and 1950 in the Pacific Coast League with Seattle where he batted .319 with 18 HRs and 98 RBIs in 1949 and batted .310 in 1950. What had to be disappointing for Colman was being a non-roster player for the Yankees when they defeated the Brooklyn Dodgers in seven games for the 1947 World Series championship. Nevertheless, Colman was part of the World Series scene. The only other Londoner to experience the World Series was the outstanding Iron Man catcher George Gibson in 1909 when Gibson's Pittsburgh Pirates defeated the Detroit Tigers starring Ty Cobb in the best-of-nine final series, five games to two. Nineteen-forty- seven was a benchmark for Major League Baseball if there ever was one. Brooklyn Dodgers manager Leo Durocher was suspended for the year even before the season opened for \\"conduct detrimental to baseball\\". The doors were finally opened to the black athlete as an infielder by the name of Jackie Robinson was plucked from the Montreal Royals to lead the Brooklyn Dodgers into one of the most memorable World Series of all time. Colman finished his six-year major league career with 571 at-bats, 15 home runs and 106 RBIs in 271 games for a career average of .228. Colman returns to his hometown Colman returned to his hometown of London in 1954 after serving as a player- coach with the Toronto Maple Leafs of the AAA International League from 1951 through 1953, a team owned by Canadian sporting legend Jack Kent Cooke. Colman signed on as playing manager for London Majors' owner and general manager Clare Van Horne in 1954. (Years later, Van Horne would subsequently leave London facing a paternity suit, move to California and be convicted of murdering his girlfriend with a hammer). That same year, Alex Park of Alex Park Sporting Goods Ltd. at 300 Dundas Street, hired Colman as an in-store salesman. The sporting goods store was the meeting place for a number of Londoners interested in forming a baseball league for youths. Purchases the London Majors The following year in 1955, Frank Colman took over the Intercounty League's London Majors at Labatt Park, where it all began for Colman 20 years earlier. Colman's brother Jack (who died in 1962), helped coach the 1955 London Majors. \\"The sale of the Majors baseball club to Colman is one of the best things to happen to baseball in many years,\\" wrote London Free Press sports editor Jack Park in his \\"Sport Sparks\\" column at the time. As player-owner Colman's London Majors won the Intercounty title in 1956. The team also won the Great Lakes championship in 1957. Colman returned the Majors to the Intercounty loop in 1958, organizing an exhibition ballgame in June 1958 in conjunction with the Knights of Columbus and the Mocha Temple Shrine in aid of the Shrine Hospitals for Crippled Children. The ballgame between the Toronto Maple Leafs of the AAA International League and an all-star team put together by Colman attracted 5,000 fans to Labatt Park. In 1959, Colman sold the London Majors. Colman, co-founder of the Eager Beaver Baseball Association In 1955, Colman co-founded the Eager Beaver Baseball Association (EBBA) with sportsman Gordon Berryhill and that organization renamed its all- star day -- \\"Frank Colman Day\\"—in 1984. The EBBA is still going strong 52 years later, having mentored thousands of young ballplayers. Before Frank Colman died of cancer in 1983 at the age of 64, he had been working at the University of Western Ontario in the maintenance department. Sixteen years later in 1999, Frank Colman was inducted into the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame. In a letter to the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame in 1999, Yogi Berra wrote that he visited Colman at his home in Canada on several occasions. \\"I've made a lot of friends in baseball through the years, but I'll always remember Frank as one of the most decent and genuine people that I ever met,\\" Berra wrote. \\"I was proud that he was my friend.\\" His son, Frank Colman Jr., accepted the Hall of Fame plaque at the ceremony in St. Marys, Ontario with a large contingent of Colmans on hand. \\"If he were here, I think he would say his greatest accomplishment has been his contribution to the community through the work with the Eager Beaver Baseball Association,\\" his son said. \\"That was his real pride and joy. He really loved that kind of work.\\" In 2005, Colman was also inducted into the London Sports Hall of Fame at the John Labatt Centre.

He currently is the play-by-play announcer for the Denver Nuggets of the National Basketball Association in the fall, winter and spring, and in the summer he is a play-by- play announcer for the Association of Volleyball Professionals. He is a former collegiate basketball and volleyball player and played on the US National Men's Volleyball Team. He played beach volleyball extensively and won numerous tournaments on the Open beach circuit. He also was a captain of the US Men's volleyball team that won the Gold Medal at the 1984 Olympic Games. Early life Marlowe was born in Los Angeles, California, and grew up in Pacific Palisades. His father, Hugh Marlowe, was an actor and starred in over 30 movies. His mother, K.T. Stevens, was also an actor, and appeared in 11 films. Marlowe's grandfather was the prolific film director Sam Wood, who was a three-time Academy Award nominee. Marlowe grew up playing volleyball on the beach. He was a two-sport standout at Palisades High School in Los Angeles, California, playing basketball and volleyball. His Palisades High volleyball teams won three Los Angeles city championships. He graduated in 1969, after being selected a high school All-American. College career Marlowe was awarded an athletic scholarship at San Diego State University, where he played both basketball and volleyball. San Diego State competed in the Pacific Coast Athletic Association in basketball. Marlowe played guard, and was a steady and consistent performer. He was selected Pacific Coast Athletic Association \\"Newcomer of the Year\\" in his freshman year. By his senior year he was on the PCAA All-Conference team. Marlowe lettered all four seasons at SDSU, and set a school record by playing in 114 consecutive games. In volleyball San Diego State competed in the 18-team Southern California Intercollegiate Volleyball Association (SCIVA). Volleyball was a new sport for the NCAA, having been first sanctioned as a championship sport in 1970, Marlowe's freshman year. The competition in college volleyball was dominated by the schools of southern California. The Aztecs of San Diego State were soon contenders for the national title, and Marlowe was one of the standouts on the team. In his junior year of 1971-72 Marlowe's Aztecs stepped into the spotlight as one of the nation's top teams. Marlowe was a starting outside hitter and setter for the Aztecs. SDSU and UC Santa Barbara were considered the top favorites to win the national championship. 1972 was the first appearance by the Aztecs in the four team volleyball championship. At the time the format of the tournament matched the format of a USVBA tournament, and consisted of a four-team preliminary round robin to determine seeding into a subsequent single- elimination championship bracket. SDSU made the trip back to Ball State University in Muncie, Indiana where the 1972 national tournament was being held. In round robin play the Aztecs beat Ball State 2-1 (15-8, 6-15, 15-5) and handled UCLA 2-0 (15-13, 15-7) before losing to UCSB 0-2 (13-15, 10-15). UCLA, UC Santa Barbara and UCSD all ended up with identical 2 - 1 records, but the Bruins earned the top position in the playoff seeding on the basis of points differential. The Bruins easily beat Ball State in their semi-final. In the other semi-final UCSD was down 2 games to none before they bounced back and avenged their round robin loss, defeating UC Santa Barbara in five, 11-15, 13-15, 15-9, 15-11, 15-12 for a 3-2 win. The win set up a championship final between San Diego State and the Bruins. In the championship match SDSU jumped out 2 games to none, and with an 8-3 lead in the third appeared ready for a three-game sweep. However the Bruins rallied back to win it, 10-15, 9-15, 15-9, 15-10, 15-7. UCLA had won their third consecutive national crown. In his senior year Marlowe was voted team captain. California teams still dominated the national scene, and Long Beach State was the top ranked team and the favorite to win the title. In the regional finals San Diego State met defending national champion UCLA at UCLA's Pauley Pavilion in a rematch of the 1972 national championship match. The Bruins went up 2-0 before a three-game comeback by the Aztecs eliminated the Bruins from the tournament. After the win Marlowe commented to a Sports Illustrated writer \\"When we came back and beat UCLA in Pauley, it was like it was willed to be. It was like God came down from the mountain and was rooting for the Aztecs.\\" The 1973 national championship tournament was hosted by San Diego State University in San Diego, California. In preliminary round robin play held in Peterson Gym the Aztecs beat Army 2-0 (15-1, 15-5) and Ball State 2-1 (17-19, 15-12, 15-5) before losing to Long Beach State 1-2 (15-10, 13-15, 7-15). Long Beach State ended round robin play with a perfect 3-0 record and the #1 seed. SDSU was seeded second with a 2-1 record, Ball State was third seed and Army was seeded fourth. In their semi-final UCSD defeated Ball State 3-0 (15-5, 15-7, 15-10) while Long Beach State defeated Army 3-0 (15-5, 15-1, 15-2), setting up a championship final between San Diego State and Long Beach State. A record crowd showed up at the San Diego Sports Arena for the championship final. In what was then the largest crowd to witness a volleyball match in the U.S., more than 10,000 fans were on hand as the Aztecs lost the first game of the match 11-15. Game 2 saw the noise in the gym reach a deafening level, as the Aztecs came back to beat Long Beach State in a barn burner, 15-13. The final two games were all Aztecs, as they won them 15-8, 15-6 to give them their first national championship. With the title point the fans stormed the court to celebrate the achievement. The championship win was the first and only Division I team title ever won by San Diego State. The 1973 San Diego State volleyball team finished with a collegiate won-loss record of 20-5. Marlowe was selected to the All Tournament team and was made first team All-American. The 1973 San Diego State volleyball team was inducted into the SDSU hall of Fame in 2003. Marlowe graduated from San Diego State in 1974 with a B.A. in physical education. Following his collegiate career Marlowe continued to play volleyball on the club level, and competed on one of the nation's best USVBA teams. He was voted Most Valuable Player at the USVBA Open Nationals in 1976 and again in 1978. Beach career Marlowe started competing in beach tournaments in 1975. On the beach he was nicknamed \\"The Lion\\" for his intensity and the unruly blonde hair that blew about on the top of Marlowe's head. In 1976 he was a captain on the national indoor team, but the team failed to qualify for the Olympic games. Marlowe had time enough left in the summer to team with Steve Obradovich and win the largest and most coveted beach event of the day, the Manhattan Beach Open. The following year was Marlowe's big year in the sand. He teamed with Jim Menges, whose former partner, Greg Lee, had left to pursue a career in professional basketball. The pairing of Menges and Marlowe was dynamic. Together they took a first at the Santa Barbara Open followed by another first at the Hermosa Beach Open. Marlowe then paired with Ron Von Hagen to win the Rosecrans Open. Teaming with Menges again they won at the San Diego Open before the pair finally lost a championship match to Obradovich and Gary Hooper in the finals of the Laguna Beach Open. They came back to win at the Manhattan Beach Open and grabbed another first at the Lake Tahoe Open, before finishing the year by taking the world championship at the State Beach Open held at Will Rogers State Beach. Marlowe did not play on the beach in 1978 but returned in 1979, partnering with Fred Sturm. They had one 3rd-place finish and five others in the top five. Following 1979 he moved away from the beach to focus instead on his fledgling acting career until 1982, when he returned to the US National team. All told Marlowe won eight open tournaments, including two highly prestigious Manhattan Beach Opens and the 1977 World Championship. US National Team Following his graduation from college Marlowe continued to play volleyball on indoor national club teams which competed in the Open division of the USVBA. At the 1976 USVBA Open National Championship he was voted the Most Valuable Player. Following the tournament he was selected to play on the US National team. His teammates chose him to be their team captain. The US national team failed to qualify for the 1976 Olympic games, and Marlowe returned to California and beach volleyball. In 1977 the program hired former player Doug Beal as head coach of the U.S. Men's National Team. He became the driving force for establishing a full-time, year-around volleyball training center. The facility opened in 1978 in Dayton, Ohio. However, California was the hot bed of volleyball talent at the time, and though the nation's top players were willing to play on the national team, many were unable to relocate to Dayton. In 1980 the US national team again failed to qualify for the Olympic games, this time held in Moscow. The United States had boycotted the games, making the failure to qualify a moot point, but it was clear the US team had to make a change. In 1981 the national team training center was moved to San Diego, California. Marlowe rejoined the National team in 1982. In 1982 the US team was ranked 13th internationally. A collection of the top collegiate players from the California area joined Marlowe on the team, including Karch Kiraly, Dusty Dvorak, Steve Timmons, Craig Buck, Steven Salmons, Pat Powers and Doug Partie. At this point, being on the national team was a full-time job, practicing five hours a day, five days a week. Marlowe had to adjust from being an outside hitter and setter in a 6-2 system, to a full-time setter in the 5-1 system the national team was using. It was a significant adjustment, but at this point in his career it was one he had to make to play at the Olympic level. He appealed to SDSU Aztecs coach Jack Henn to help him make the transition from outside hitter to setter. \\"Chris and I had a little bit of a falling-out after ’73,\\" Henn said. \\"But he realized he had to change positions to play in the Olympics. He could have gone off in his gold chains, but he humbled himself and asked for help.\\" By the following year the U.S. squad was among the world's elite teams. Coming into the 1984 Olympic games the roster had to be cut down to 12 players. Marlowe was the last man cut. In the late spring of 1984 the US National team went on a five match tour of the Soviet Union, whose national team was the reigning world champions. The US swept all five matches of the series. Near the end of the final match, some six weeks before the start of the Olympics, setter Rod Wilde landed on the foot of a Soviet player who had crossed under the net. Wilde suffered a broken leg. Marlowe was asked to rejoin the team. In a show of support, his teammates selected him team captain by a unanimous vote on his first day back. The turnaround for the US National team culminated with the Gold Medal at the 1984 Olympic Games in Los Angeles. Playing at the Olympic games and winning the gold medal were lifetime achievements for Marlowe. Asked how he felt, Marlowe said \\"I felt like I was on Cloud 10, one notch higher than Cloud 9.\\" Said US National Team head coach Doug Beal \\"Chris wasn’t the most gifted player. He wasn’t the best jumper, but he had the knack of making people around him better. He saw the game like few players see it. He always made good decisions. He ranks right up there with the best competitors of all time. \\"In ’84, we trained for 10 days before the Olympics in Pullman, Washington. That was the most intense, most emotional time, and Chris was the key to that training and our success.\\" Entertainment and acting Marlowe had come from a family of actors. He pursued this career as well, and in 1978 he spent a year appearing in the daytime TV series Love of Life. He also had several minor film roles. His movie credits include Rollerball, Rounders, Look Who's Talking Too, The 6th Man and Side Out. Early in his career, he guest starred on TV's The Love Boat, A Man Called Sloane, Highcliffe Manor and Bosom Buddies. During this time Marlowe also worked doing sports broadcasting jobs. Following the 1984 Olympics, Marlowe's agent guided him to make a choice between pursuing a further career in acting or a further career in sports broadcasting. Said Marlowe: \\"That was a time when I was always auditioning for parts but nothing I really wanted. So a sports announcer job for me seemed to be more natural. I was playing the role of myself, which I really enjoyed.\\" Broadcast career Marlowe is a play-by-play announcer who splits his time between two major commitments. In the fall, winter and spring he resides in Denver and does the play-by-play announcing for the Denver Nuggets of the NBA. In the summers he comes back out to Los Angeles and works as a play-by-play announcer for the AVP. In addition to basketball and volleyball, he has done play-by-play announcing of over 25 other sports, and is considered one of America's most versatile television sports broadcasters. Marlowe first got an opportunity to do TV broadcast work when ABC hired him to provide color commentary for the 1978 NCAA indoor volleyball championship. UCLA head coach Al Scates had been doing commentary for ABC when the Bruins were not in the NCAA championship tournament. In 1978 the Bruins made the final, and ABC asked Scates if he knew someone who could replace him in the booth. Scates got to know Marlowe as Marlowe used to work out at the Bruin gym, and Scates recommended him. Marlowe's first job was providing color commentary for the NCAA championship match between UCLA and Pepperdine. Said Scates: \\"They liked Chris so much, that was the end of my television career.\\" Marlowe found he enjoyed broadcasting, and that he was good at it. Between acting jobs and his own volleyball commitments he continued to do color commentary for both indoor and beach volleyball for the next several years. After he completed his athletic career with the 1984 Olympic games he made a serious commitment to sports broadcasting, and he took courses in the skills of the trade. Marlowe credits sportscasting expert Lou Riggs of Santa Monica College for training him in sports broadcasting fundamentals. When Marlowe started with Prime Ticket, his first partner on play-by-play was Lynn Shackleford. He next worked with Keith Erickson. When Erickson quit that opened up the play-by-play spot that Marlowe had been preparing for. Marlowe moved over to play-by-play and was joined in the booth by former teammate Paul Sunderland as his analyst. Marlowe and Sunderland knew each other well, and had first played together on the U.S. National Indoor Volleyball Team in 1975. \\"When Paul moved into the color spot that really clicked. We were old friends, played together on the national team for years, and our chemistry was fantastic.\\" Marlowe and Sunderland called their first volleyball event in 1985, doing the college regional playoff match between San Diego State and Pepperdine. Their first work broadcasting at an Olympic games was at the Summer Olympics in Barcelona in 1992. They teamed up again for the Olympics in Atlanta, and again four years later in Sydney. Moving from analyst/color commentator to play-by-play was a big step-up in difficulty for Marlowe, but it meant many more broadcast opportunities. \\"It was smart to move to play-by-play because there is always someone else coming up who can fill the analyst role. Once I started doing that, I realized I could be good at it. I’m smart, and quick, good with numbers and could set up the analyst.\\" Soon Marlowe was branching out into basketball, and then other sports as well. \\"My bosses at Prime Ticket started letting me do basketball – I also played that – and that led to me doing other things like boxing, gymnastics, swimming, water polo … even windsurfing.\\" Marlowe has worked to become very versatile. In his nearly 40-year career in sports broadcasting he has covered and announced all variety of sporting events. Marlowe called Pacific 10 Basketball for FOX Sports Northwest in addition to handling USC Trojan play-by-play duties for FOX Sports West. Marlowe also did Pacific 10 College Football play-by-play for FOX Sports Northwest, NCAA College Basketball on ESPN and FOX, San Diego State Basketball and WUSA Soccer for San Diego's Cox Cable, AVP Professional Beach Volleyball for NBC, college volleyball for CSTV, and NCAA Championships in swimming, diving, gymnastics and volleyball for ESPN. He has also called aerobics, baseball, boxing, cliff-diving, equestrian show jumping, fencing, poker, rhythmic gymnastics, skiing, college soccer, track and field, water polo, wind surfing and wrestling. He has hosted sports programs such as the \\"UCLA Sports Magazine\\" for Prime Sports, the \\"Just for Kicks\\" soccer show on ESPN, the \\"Marlowe Minute\\" for Dig Magazine on FOX Sports West and the \\"Aztec Sports Weekly\\" for Cox Cable. Along with assignments for Fox Sports Net, Marlowe was the announcer for every Association of Volleyball Professionals event in the late 1980s and early 1990s. He was also an occasional anchor on the Southern California Sports Report. Marlowe is a veteran of four consecutive Olympic telecasts on NBC, starting with calling play-by-play for NBC's coverage of Beach Volleyball at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece. Marlowe also has done AVP events for NBC, college volleyball for CSTV, and volleyball, football and basketball for ESPN. Marlowe has seen a number of changes in sports broadcasting over his career, among which is having women in front of the camera. He notes having enjoyed working with Michele Tafoya and Heather Cox, comments that both are very good at their jobs, and states having women as sports broadcasters has been a good change in the sports broadcasting industry. Personal life Most of the year Marlowe resides in Denver, Colorado with his wife, Laurie. In the summers they move to Manhattan Beach, California. They have two grown daughters, both of whom were standout setters for Arapahoe High School in Denver. Their older daughter, MacKenzie, graduated from Chapman University. She is interested in working in the film industry and has interned at DiNovi Pictures. She currently is an executive assistant at William Morris Endeavor. Their younger daughter, Grace, attends the USC School of Cinematic Arts. Awards In 1986 Marlowe was inducted into the USVBA Hall of Fame in Wichita, Kansas. Eight years later in 1994 San Diego State inducted Marlowe into their Aztec Hall of Fame. The California Beach Volleyball Hall of Fame elected to induct Marlowe into their hall later that same year. Finally, on 23 April 2017 Marlowe was inducted into the Los Angeles City Section sports Hall of Fame. At his induction into the Los Angeles City Section sports Hall of Fame, Marlowe spoke of the athletic accomplishments he valued most. Among these he listed winning three LA city championships at Palisades High School, an NCAA championship at San Diego State University, being selected first team All American in his senior year at San Diego State, being twice selected MVP at the USVBA national championships, winning four USVBA Open team national championships, winning the World Championship and 8 other tournaments on the beach circuit, including the two Manhattans, and a gold medal at the Olympic games. Of them all, what he prized most was winning the Olympic Gold Medal in front of his family and friends at the games held in Los Angeles in 1984.

He was an eight-time Australian national sculling champion, four-time Olympian and three-time Olympic medalist. He later rose to become the Commissioner of the New South Wales Police Force. Early life and career Wood was the youngest of four children born in Kensington, New South Wales, on 30 April 1917. His father Thomas Wood had emigrated to Australia and entered the Police Force in 1905. Wood grew up in Randwick and attended Sydney Boys High School, graduating in 1934,Australian Sporting Representatives. shsobu.org.au where he represented his school in rugby union, swimming and most successfully, rowing. Following High School graduation, Wood became a police cadet and rowed for the New South Wales Police Rowing Club. The police team was selected to represent Australia at the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin. At the age of 19 years, Wood appeared in his first Olympics. His boat was eliminated in the repechage and did not make the final.Merv Wood. sports- reference.com Upon his return, Wood made police constable. After the majority of his crew retired, Wood took up sculling. He worked in the police force in the Criminal Investigation Branch, and in 1944 joined the Royal Australian Air Force as a navigator. Rowing After the end of the Second World War, Wood won State and National Championships in 1946, 1947 and 1948 and was selected to represent Australia in the single scull at the 1948 Summer Olympics in London. Wood travelled to London ahead of the rest of the team and won the Diamond Challenge Sculls event at the Henley Royal Regatta, beating Bert Bushnell in the final.Henley Royal Regatta Results of Final Races 1946–2003 . rowinghistory.net At the Olympics, Wood won all of his races handily including the final, which he won by 14 seconds. Wood celebrated by smoking his pipe – he was a lifelong smoker who only put aside the habit for the Olympics. Wood went on to win the national single scull championship a record seven straight times, winning in 1949, 1950, 1951 and 1952. At the 1950 British Empire Games he won the single scull and with compatriot Murray Riley the double scull. As the 1948 Olympic Champion, Wood was awarded the Philadelphia Challenge Cup as the best amateur sculler in the world, which Wood defended in 1950, defeating John B. Kelly Jr. and Antony Rowe in a match race in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Wood represented Australia in the single scull event at the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki, where he was honoured by being selected to carry the Australian flag at the opening ceremony. On the journey to Finland, Wood stopped in England and repeated his victory at the Henley Royal Regatta in the Diamond Challenge Sculls, beating Tony Fox in the final. Wood was a favourite to win the single scull at the Olympics, but lost the final by 1.7 seconds to Yuriy Tyukalov. Although he never offered it as an excuse, as a child, Wood had injured his arm which occasionally caused him distress while rowing including during the summer of 1952. This may have affected his performance at the games, but Wood also faced far stiffer competition than in the 1948 games, which were held shortly after the Second World War, and his main rival Tyukalov would prove to be one of the best oarsmen of his generation. At the 1954 British Empire and Commonwealth Games in Vancouver, Wood rowed in both the coxless four and the double scull events. The finals were separated by only 45 minutes, and Wood won gold medals in both events. In 1956 Wood lost the national sculling title to teenager Stuart MacKenzie, who was selected ahead of Wood to represent Australia in the single scull at the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne. But Wood and his partner Riley were selected for the double scull. Among others in the final, Wood and Riley faced the Soviet team that included Yuriy Tyukalov, who had beaten Wood at the 1952 Games. Tyukalov's boat again triumphed, an American boat finished second, and Wood's boat third, giving him a Bronze medal at age 39. Wood was again named the flag-bearer, the only Australian to have twice achieved the honour.Australia. sports-reference.com Wood's final competition was the 1958 British Empire and Commonwealth Games in Cardiff, where teaming with MacKenzie he won silver in the double scull at age 41. Commissioner of Police Following his retirement from rowing, Wood returned full-time to his post in the New South Wales Police Force, eventually becoming the Commissioner in 1977. His double scull partner at the 1956 Olympics, Murray Riley, was also a police officer. After leaving the force, Riley became an international drug smuggler. Wood's link with Riley and the controversy it generated was a factor in causing him to quit as Commissioner in 1979. Another factor was a document, allegedly prepared by senior police officers, which was given to a number of politicians, and which alluded to a meeting between Wood and an \\"illegal casino operator\\", among other things. The then Premier of New South Wales, Neville Wran, started by backing Wood, stating that it would be strange for a Police Commissioner not to know people in the underworld. Once the document surfaced, however, the public backlash forced Wran to take back his support for Wood. Death Wood died in Sydney on 19 August 2006 at age 89.

It was closed in 1953 to passenger trains, and in 1969 to the remaining freight services. It is a Grade II* listed building.  History  The terminus was built after considerable negotiation with the Board of Ordnance, which argued that the site, just outside a main gate in the Gosport Lines ramparts, could compromise the Portsmouth Harbour defences. The buildings were consequently designed to be defensible, with surrounding railings and a roof parapet.The Battle of Gosport Railway Station 1840-1841 , Philip Eley, The Railway in Gosport, HantsWeb From the start, the station was very busy, particularly with the carriage of coal and other freight, and initially was also used for passengers travelling to Portsmouth, a short ferry ride across the harbour. The LSWR also opened a locomotive depot next to the station in February 1842 which was badly damaged during a bombing raid in 1941 but remained in use until its demolition in 1953.Roger Griffiths and Paul Smith, Directory of British Engine Sheds: 1 OPC., 1999. p.54. The station saw the first of many royal visitors in 1843, when Prince Albert, husband of Queen Victoria, greeted Louis Philippe of France at Gosport. Queen Victoria visited the station six days later when she accompanied the king on his return to France.Gosport Railway History www.gosport.info Following Albert's purchase of Osborne House on the Isle of Wight the following year, he negotiated the construction of an extension of the line through the town ramparts to a private station, the Royal Victoria Station, built in Royal Clarence Yard for the use of Royal family and household, who would arrive here for the Solent crossing. For the next fifty years, Victoria and her party landed here for her summer holiday at Osborne. The private station was last used for passengers following Victoria's death in 1901, when her coffin, accompanied by her mourning family, was brought across the Solent for the last time. Following Victoria's death, her successor, Edward VII, found Osborne an inconvenient white elephant, and gave the house to the nation. The station was given great impetus during World War I as Gosport's role as Victualler to the Navy increased. There was in influx of supplies to and from Royal Clarence Yard, and also large numbers of troop movements and the transportation of the wounded en route to Haslar Hospital. After the First World War rail traffic decreased, but with the coming of the World War II the station saw much military activity again, including supplies, hospital trains and trains carrying prisoners of war on their way to a local internment camp. On the night of 10 March 1941 the station received a direct incendiary hit from an aerial attack, the main damage being to the roofing which caught alight and collapsed. After the war Gosport station's role again diminished, and on 6 June 1953 scheduled passenger services from Gosport ceased. Freight traffic remained until 30 January 1969, but then the station closed to all traffic.  Current status  In 2006, planning approval was given for the site to convert the platforms and buildings into a small number of residential properties and offices with the main gate in Spring Garden Lane opened up for vehicle access.

Its boundaries are: Waterbury and Westchester Avenues to the north, Westchester Creek to the east, the East River to the south, and White Plains Road to the west. The neighborhood is part of Bronx Community Board 9. ZIP Codes include 10472, 10473, and 10462. The area is patrolled by the NYPD's 43rd Precinct. New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA) property in the area is patrolled by P.S.A. 8 at 2794 Randall Avenue. History Most development initially concentrated near the IRT Pelham Line on Westchester Avenue and in close proximity to Castle Hill Avenue (once served by a streetcar). The predominant housing was a mixture of attached and detached two-story buildings with one or two units, closely set on small lots. Castle Hill became home to many European immigrants looking to leave Lower Manhattan's overpopulated immigrant communities. Prior to the late 20th century, large land parcels across the neighborhood remained undeveloped. Vacant land was used to provide temporary housing, using Quonset hut structures, to returning World War II veterans. During the 1950s the Bruckner Expressway was constructed, bisecting the area. The NYCHA built the Castle Hill Houses in 1959, adding over 2,000 housing units to the community. Later during the 1960s and 1970s, large apartment complexes were constructed in the neighborhood following the establishment of the Mitchell Lama program. In 2000, the largest remaining collection of vacant parcels was developed near Castle Hill Point with modern two-story, two-unit attached rowhouses. Like neighboring Soundview, Castle Hill began to fall into rapid decay in the 1970s due to white flight, growing poverty rates, and a citywide fiscal crisis. Much of the white non-Hispanic population was replaced by poor and working-class Latin Americans and African Americans. As a result, abandonment was much less extensive than in neighborhoods to the west, including Morrisania. The neighborhood was gravely affected by the crack epidemic throughout the late 1980s and early 1990s. Improved policing methods include NYPD-monitored CCTV along known high drug-trafficking areas, increased foot presence, and improved statistical mapping. In more recent years, a citywide housing crisis spurred construction of modern multi-unit row houses and apartment buildings. Many are multi zoned for retail and have mixed-income qualifications. There are also plans to develop this type of housing on vacant land within the confines of NYCHA Castle Hill Houses along with significant renovations and improvements to existing grounds and buildings. The neighborhood has become increasingly more diverse with a rise in varied Latin American and Asian immigration in recent years. Crime has also seen a significant decline as a result of a number of factors including enhanced policing techniques and changing economic demographics. Demographics The neighborhood predominantly consists of Latin Americans (a plurality having Puerto Rican and Dominican ancestry) and African Americans. 73% of residential units are renter-occupied. There is significant income diversity but the poverty rate is higher and median household income lower than the New York City average. The entirety of Community District 9, which comprises Castle Hill, Clason Point, and Parkchester, had 184,105 inhabitants as of NYC Health's 2018 Community Health Profile, with an average life expectancy of 79.7 years. This is about the same as the median life expectancy of 81.2 for all New York City neighborhoods. Most inhabitants are youth and middle-aged adults: 25% are between the ages of between 0–17, 29% between 25–44, and 24% between 45–64. The ratio of college- aged and elderly residents was lower, at 10% and 12% respectively. As of 2017, the median household income in Community District 9 was $40,005. In 2018, an estimated 26% of Castle Hill and Parkchester residents lived in poverty, compared to 25% in all of the Bronx and 20% in all of New York City. One in eight residents (13%) were unemployed, compared to 13% in the Bronx and 9% in New York City. Rent burden, or the percentage of residents who have difficulty paying their rent, is 55% in Castle Hill and Parkchester, compared to the boroughwide and citywide rates of 58% and 51% respectively. Based on this calculation, , Castle Hill and Parkchester are considered low-income relative to the rest of the city and not gentrifying. Land use and terrain Large apartment buildings Modern attached multi-unit homes; the Castle Hill Houses sit in the background The land area contains a mix of uses but is primarily residential. There is a mixture of pre-war architecture, mid-century, and modern construction. Multi-unit attached and detached houses dominate much of the land area. The NYCHA Castle Hill Houses take up significant land area in the southern part of the community along with the Mitchell-Lama Jamie Towers housing complexLIVING IN  CASTLE HILL, THE BRONX.

He worked as the indoor volleyball play-by-play announcer for NBC Olympics’ coverage of the 2016 Summer Olympics, and has worked for the NBC Sports Group's Summer Olympics coverage starting at the 1992 Barcelona Summer Olympics. He is a former collegiate basketball and volleyball player and played on the US National Men's Volleyball Team. He was a member of the US Men's volleyball team that won the Gold Medal at the 1984 Summer Olympics. Early life and athletic career Sunderland grew up in Sherman Oaks, in the San Fernando Valley region of Los Angeles, California. He attended Notre Dame High School, graduating in 1971. Sunderland played basketball and football at Notre Dame, and was a San Fernando Valley League All-League selection as both a wide receiver in football and as a forward in basketball. He started playing volleyball on the beach during his high school years, and states he had an immediate love for the game. He was recruited to the University of Oregon on a basketball scholarship. Between his freshman and sophomore college seasons he began playing a great deal of beach volleyball, and he joined the University of Oregon's USVBA club team during his sophomore year. Sunderland states he set a goal to play on the US National Men's Volleyball Team. Following his sophomore year he transferred to Loyola Marymount so he could play basketball and volleyball. Sunderland developed into one of Loyola's top volleyball players, earning All-America honors. In 1975 Sunderland was invited to try out for the U.S. National team, and made the cut for the developmental squad. After the US team failed to qualify for the 1976 Summer Olympics Sunderland moved up to the \\"A\\" squad. He competed on the team over the next four years. At the USVBA national tournament, he won U.S. Player of the Year awards in 1977, 1979 and 1982. In international competition the US national team again failed to qualify for the 1980 Summer Olympics, this time held in Moscow in 1980. The United States had boycotted the games, making the failure to qualify a moot point, but it was clear that the teams the US put together following the USVBA nationals were no longer adequate to compete on the international level. In 1977 the program hired former player Doug Beal as a full-time coach of the U.S. Men's National Team. He became the driving force for establishing a full- time, year-round volleyball training center. The facility was created in Dayton, Ohio, in 1978. California was the then hotbed of volleyball talent, and many of the nation's top players would not relocate to Dayton to participate on the national team. In 1981 the training center was moved to San Diego, California, along with the national team program. Now a veteran, Sunderland had developed into a solid all-around player. In San Diego he was joined on the national team by a collection of the top collegiate talent from the California area, including Karch Kiraly, Dusty Dvorak, Steve Timmons, Craig Buck, Steven Salmons, Pat Powers and Doug Partie. By 1983 the U.S. squad was among the world's elite teams. The turnaround culminated with the gold medal at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. Sunderland set winning an Olympic gold medal as a lifetime goal. Teammate Kiraly, said: \\"It's something he really wanted and it was really neat to see that one of the oldest guys on the team was also the most excited.\\" Broadcasting career Following the completion of his playing career Sunderland pursued a career in broadcasting. Sunderland's athletic career formed the base for a broadcast career, initially working as a volleyball commentator. He was paired with former teammate Chris Marlowe. Sunderland's hiring was a morale boost to Marlowe, who had been doing broadcast work for a number of years, usually paired with personnel with little or no volleyball experience. Said Marlowe, \\"Early on I was working with broadcasters who may not have known a volleyball from a pineapple. When Paul moved into the color spot – that really clicked. We were old friends, played together on the national team for years, and our chemistry was fantastic.\\" Sunderland's first assignment was in 1985 working with Marlowe at the NCAA Men's Volleyball West Regional match between San Diego State and Pepperdine. Said Marlowe: \\"I can ask Paul anything on the air, at any time, and he always has an answer.\\" From the color commentator spot Sunderland moved on to do play-by-play, and extended into basketball and other sports. He soon took on work with the Clippers and Dodgers for Fox Sports Net. Starting in 1993, Sunderland covered Pac-10 basketball for ESPN. He subsequently was hired by NBC to cover a number of sports, including the NBA, WNBA and a variety of Olympic sports. Sunderland later served as an anchor on the Fox Sports Network. In 1993 Sunderland began doing pre-game hosting for the Lakers. In 1995 Sunderland was working for Prime, NBC and ESPN. In the 2001-2002 season, the Laker's long time play-by-play announcer, Chick Hearn, had to take time away while he recovered from heart surgery, and then more time was needed when he was injured in a fall and suffered a broken hip. Sunderland filled in for Chick Hearn for 56 games during the 2001-02 season, and then in November 2002 he was announced as the new play-by-play announcer for the Los Angeles Lakers. He was only the second announcer ever hired by the team. He announced for the Lakers through 2005. Since 2005, Sunderland has worked as an announcer for NBC and Universal Sports, covering the Pac-12 in the sports of Basketball, Volleyball, Track and Field and Tennis. Paul Sunderland served as the indoor volleyball play-by-play announcer for NBC Olympics’ coverage at the 2016 Summer Olympics, teaming with Kevin Barnett as analyst. He has worked doing the NBC Sports Group's summer Olympics coverage since the 1992 Games in Barcelona. Sunderland currently serves as a play-by-play announcer for both volleyball and men's basketball on ESPN's Longhorn Network. Awards Sunderland earned All-America honors while at Loyola Marymount in 1975. He won USVBA Player of the Year awards at the national \\"Open\\" tournament in 1977, 1979 and 1982. In 1986 he was inducted into the USVBA Hall of Fame in Wichita, Kansas. That same year he was also inducted into the Loyola Marymount Hall of Fame. Sunderland has twice won the Emmy Award for his play-by-play announcing with the LA Lakers. Personal life Sunderland lives in Southern California with his wife, Maud-Ann. He met his wife at the 1977 World University Games in Bulgaria. Maud-Ann Tesch was a two-time national fencing champion from Sweden. She and Sunderland were married in Sweden in 1978. They have two children.

Life O'Dwyer was born in Bohola, County Mayo, Ireland, and emigrated to Brooklyn, New York in 1925. He became a United States citizen in 1930. During World War II he was a staunchly vehement opponent of American involvement in the war and traveled the United States (until Pearl Harbor) to speak with and rally pro-neutrality (particularly Irish-American) groups. As a lawyer some of his more renowned cases were those involving people accused of Communist activities. Active in the National Lawyers Guild, he became its president in 1947 and served on its national board from 1948-51. He supported both constitutionalist and Irish republican initiatives. His influence protected several Irish Republican Army gunmen from deportation, including \\"The Fort Worth Five\\" and Vincent Conlon. Active in New York City politics, O'Dwyer ran for political office several times. In 1948, he narrowly lost an election for the U.S. House of Representatives to incumbent Jacob K. Javits. He was elected to the city council from a seat representing all of Manhattan for a term from 1963-65. He also gained election to the position of New York City Council President, which was then one of three citywide elected positions. He served in that capacity from 1974 to 1977. In ten other races he was unsuccessful. In 1968, in opposition to U. S. involvement in the Vietnam War, he ran and won the Democratic Party nomination for U.S. Senator from New York. Again he found his candidacy opposing popular Republican Party incumbent Jacob Javits and again O'Dwyer lost in the general election. In 1970, he ran in the Democratic primary for U.S. Senator against Ted Sorensen, Richard Ottinger and Max McCarthy, but was defeated by Ottinger.

Wurfbain, publisher. It is privately owned by a small group of shareholders. History The business was started in Seal Beach, California, and remained there until 1990 when it moved to a commercial office and warehouse in Huntington Beach. Initially it occupied one unit in a building, but over time, came to occupy the entire building. In 1992 the business was incorporated as Safari Press Inc. World Wide Hunting Books The company started in May 1984 when it issued a small, dark green catalog under the name World Wide Hunting Books. The logo was that of a white rhino on a shield. World Wide Hunting Books sold antiquarian big-game hunting books by issuing a catalog about five times a year. Only in 1985 was the name Safari Press adopted for the new book publishing program. To this day World Wide Hunting Books sells antiquarian books under its name. Publications In 1985 Safari Press published its first book, which was a reprint entitled African Hunter by James Mellon. Safari Press used the rhino logo from WWHB. Only one book, African Hunter, was published in 1985, but the next year saw the publication of White Hunter by John Hunter and Horned Death by John Burger. In 1987 the company released five titles including With a Rifle in Mongolia by Count Hoyos-Sprinzenstein, From Mount Kenya to the Cape by Craig Boddington, and Hunting on Three Continents by the late Jack O’Connor, which was a compilation of stories from Petersen’s Hunting magazine. From this small beginning, the company has grown to the point today where it has published over three hundred titles and has over a million copies of its books in print. Safari Press limited edition books Limited Editions Safari Press is known for its high-quality limited-edition books. With the exception of three books—White Hunter by John Hunter, Horned Death by John Burger, and After Big Game in Central Africa by Edouard Foa—all its limited-edition books have been original titles not published before in the English language. All its limited edition books are numbered and most have been signed by the author(s). Virtually all limited edition books are issued with a slipcase. Safari Press has now produced more original, limited edition titles than either Amwell Press or the original Derrydale Press. Content and Merchandise The emphasis of Safari Press has been African big-game hunting from the outset, but by the late 1980s it published its first sporting-firearms book by Craig Boddington, entitled Safari Rifles. From there it branched out to wingshooting, North American and Asian big game, and mountain hunting. As the company grew, it started to carry books published by other companies in addition to its own publications. Safari Press has adapted and expanded its publishing program to keep up with the changes in technology. It has published audio books as well as e-books. In response to customer demand, it now sells a large variety of hunting DVDs. In 2002 the owners of Safari Press bought Sports Afield magazine from Robert E. Petersen.

It is a boat with a narrow bow entry and a planing hull, carrying a mainsail, and a jib (sometimes self tacking). Stability is achieved with a sliding seat on which the single crew member sits, effectively controlling the boat from 'outside'. International Canoes are raced in three divisions. The main body of the class competes to a development (or \\"box\\") rule, allowing significant variation in design between different boats within the rule framework. Within that rule there is a \\"One Design\\" subclass which covers boats built to a one design rule in operation between 1971 and 2007, all of which have the same hull shape and are subject to an 83 kg minimum weight limit. The third division, known as the AC (Asymmetric Canoe), uses the 83 kg one design hull and carries an asymmetric spinnaker. The combination of an easily driven hull with a highly developed and efficient sail plan, and the powerful righting moment afforded by the (single) crew positioned well away from the hull centerline provides possibly the most exhilarating and technically challenging sailing experience available in a mono-hulled craft. The origins of the class can be traced back to the 1860s, and International competition with craft that are recognisably ancestors of the current boats started in 1884. The Class still competes for the New York Canoe Club Challenge Trophy, which was established in 1885 and is believed to be the oldest international sailing trophy after the America’s Cup. The class is most popular in Australia, the US and Northern Europe, especially Germany, Sweden and the UK. International Canoes can compete against other classes in a mixed fleet by use of the RYA Portsmouth Yardstick handicap scheme. The one-design class uses a Portsmouth number of 905. The Asymmetric Canoe has a faster Portsmouth number of 870, making it 3.9% faster.

The airport is mostly used for general aviation, and has extensive sailplane activity. Bergen Air Transport operates the airport's only scheduled route, six times per week to Bergen Airport, Flesland. In 2011, the airport had 5,078 aircraft movements and 3,423 passengers. The airport has a single runway with flight information service and instrument landing system. In connection with the airport is a water aerodrome, which uses the lake of Heddalsvatnet for take- off and landing. The airport was opened in 1955, and the following year Braathens SAFE started services to Oslo and Stavanger. Low patronage forced the airline to abandon the route in 1959. In 1968, the runway was extended and the municipality hoped to establish charter services, but these never realized. Partnair started flights to Oslo and Stavanger in 1985, but these were terminated less than a year later, again due to low patronage. In 1998, Air Team started flights to Oslo and Stavanger, which were replaced by Bergen Air Transport services to Bergen from 2000. History The first plans for an airport serving Notodden were launched in 1954 by Reidar Hedwig-Dahl, director of the tourist office. In late 1954 or early 1955, he held a meeting with Ludvig G. Braathen, owner of Braathens SAFE, and representatives for his airline. They saw Notodden as a possible gateway to Telemark and Braathen promised to start flying to an airport serving Notodden, should one be built.Olsen (1999): 328 At the time, Braathen had started flying to several smaller airports in Norway using a fleet of de Havilland Heron aircraft. Braathen had been traveling around Norway and encouraging municipalities to build regional airports, stating that he wanted more but smaller airports than the central authorities were planning. He succeeded at having similar airports built in Hamar and Røros.Tjomsland & Wilsberg (1995): 104 The issue was first discussed politically on 23 April 1955. The municipalities of Heddal and Notodden reached an agreement concerning financing and ownership the airport, whereby Notodden would own seven elevenths and Heddal four elevenths of the airport. Construction of the airport cost 200,000 Norwegian krone (NOK), which included a runway. This was sufficient for the Herons, but the plans included the possibility to extend the runway by another to allow landing by larger aircraft, such as the Douglas DC-3. Construction took seven and a half months,Olsen (1999): 329 and the airport opened on . The operating costs were estimated at NOK 17,850 for the first year. This excluded air traffic control, which was covered by the state. Braathens SAFE started test flights on 14 March 1956, with the service taking 20 minutes from Oslo Airport, Fornebu. The scheduled service was inaugurated on 21 May as a stop on Braathens SAFE's route between Oslo and Stavanger Airport, Sola. Passengers could travel twice each day to both airports, with tickets costing NOK 30\\\\. The service was seasonal and only flown during the summer half of the year. Notodden Airport proved to have too few passengers, resulting in the route being terminated after the end of the 1958 season.Tjomsland & Wilsberg (1995): 105 The last season, the service was operated by Thor Solberg on contract with Braathens SAFE. From 1959, Solberg started with a two-month service with six weekly round trips to Fornebu, after securing a NOK 5,000 guarantee from the municipality to cover any losses. The route was abandoned after the single season. General aviation activities at the airport gradually increased.Olsen (1999): 331 In the early 1960s, sailplanes became popular at the airport. The aerodrome is located with good wind and air pressure conditions for sailplane flying, and Oslo Flyklubb stationed two of its sailplanes at Tuven. Ronald Stensrud established a pilot school in 1966, but was forced to close after failing to make ends meet. In 1967, Notodden Municipality granted NOK 900,000 and Telemark County Municipality granted NOK 600,000 for the runway to be extended to . The new section of runway was laid down to Heddalsvatnet. At the same time, the gravel runway was asphalted. This was sufficient to allow Fokker F-27 Friendship and Convair CV-440 Metropolitan to operate. The plan was to serve international charter flights during winter, which would bring tourists to neighboring mountain resorts. During a time when there was a heated political debate over state grants to airport, Notodden was the only airport which had expanded without any central grants. The airport never succeeded at attracting any regular charter services. The opening was planned for 18 October 1968, but was delayed to the following year after the airport was flooded a week before the scheduled date. The construction work resulted in a legal dispute between the municipality and the consulting company Norsk Teknisk Byggekontroll. The initial filling of earthwork had proved insufficient, so additional earthwork had to be filled, costing an additional NOK 840,000. The municipality demanded that the consulting company cover NOK 250,000 of the extra cost. In 1979, Det Norske Helikoperskole started Norway's first helicopter pilot school at the airport. This was met with protests from the neighbors, who were affected by noise pollution all day long. The municipality was sued by 600 locals who wanted to prohibit the school from operating. During an air show in 1983, the airport was visited by a Boeing 737-200 from Braathens SAFE and General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon from the Royal Norwegian Air Force. In March 1985, Partnair was granted concession for scheduled services from Fornebu via Notodden to Stavanger. The route was started on 15 August using a ten-seat Beechcraft 200 Super King Air and flew twice a day, five days a week. This route was made possible after an instrument landing system was installed at the airport. The NOK 2 million cost had been paid for by Norsk Hydro, while Tinfos had paid NOK 100,000 for new landing lights. The upgrades also included a new terminal, which included a café in the second story and seating for 14 people. Ticket sales and check-in was managed by NSB Reisebyrå, a subsidiary of the Norwegian State Railways. After five months, Partnair had lost NOK 1.2 million on the route. In average, they were selling three to four tickets per flight to Stavanger, and one to Oslo. From March 1986, the leg from Notodden to Oslo was dropped and the service to Stavanger reduced. However, the route proved unprofitable and was eventually terminated later the same month. As part of the Oslo Airport location controversy, after the new airport was decided located to Gardermoen, there was a public discussion as to what to do with the general aviation which had operated from Fornebu. While some local aircraft owners wanted to keep a small part of Fornebu for general aviation, the authorities decided to close the airport completely. Instead, the general aviation was distributed to various private airports in Eastern Norway, including Notodden. In May 1998, Air Team started flights from Notodden to Bergen. Air Team gradually moved all its operations, including its pilot school, to Notodden. After Fornebu was closed in October, the airline experienced a quadrupling of patronage, as Gardermoen had given longer travel time for people in Buskerud and Telemark. In addition to business travel, the airline catered offshore workers commuting to the North Sea via Bergen. The airline stated that it intended to also open routes to Stavanger and Copenhagen. In 1999, the British airport operator TBI announced it was in negotiations to purchase an airport close to Oslo, and Dagens Næringsliv speculated that it could be Notodden. The municipality confirmed that they were in negotiations to establish a limited company to operate the airport, which would be jointly owned by Air Team and the municipality. In 2000, Bergen Air Transport started flying between Notodden and Bergen, using a Cessna 421B. It transported 1,000 passengers in 2000, and 1,500 the following year. During the summer of 2002, the company also attempted to fly from Notodden to Kristiansund Airport, Kvernberget, but was forced to give up due to lack of passengers. In 1995, the airport saw 770 arriving and departing passengers. It increased to 2,467 the following year but fell to 986 in 1998 before increasing to 3,682 in 1999. The patronage has since varied significantly from year to year, but has stayed in the range between 1,500 and 3,500 passengers per year. On 20 November 2003, Notodden Airport was closed for all scheduled traffic by the Norwegian Civil Aviation Authority, due to a not conforming with safety requirements. Bergen Air Transport was forced to reroute all its aircraft to Skien Airport, Geiteryggen. Following an investment of NOK 500,000 from the airline and NOK 1.2 million from the municipality, scheduled services could commence. The municipality had ambitions to upgrade the airport to a higher standard, which would allow it to serve charter aircraft weighing more than and with more than nine passengers. The plans were abandoned after 11 neighboring municipalities rejected giving grants for the necessary technical upgrades. Notodden Municipality instead started a program to increase the popularity of the airport by targeting companies in the neighboring municipality of Kongsberg to encourage use of the airport, instead of going to Oslo Airport, Gardermoen and Sandefjord Airport, Torp. Another NOK 250,000 was invested from 1 October 2004 to keep meet safety requirements. Starting in October 2004, security control was introduced. In September 2007, the Bergen Air Transport bought a new hangar at Notodden, giving it ample space for expansion, and new arrival and departure facilities. Larger airports in the region are Oslo-Gardermoen, 166 km and over 2 hours away by road, and Sandefjord 110 km away. Facilities The airport consists of a asphalted runway aligned 12–30. County Road 152 crosses the runway, forcing the road to close when the runway is in use. It has a flight information service (AFIS) and is located above mean sea level. It has category 3 fire fighting and a rescue vessel. The airport is equipped with an instrument landing system. In connection with the airport lies a water aerodrome, which uses Heddalsvatnet for landing and take-off. The area for landing and take-off is and has the same center-line as the runway. The airport is operated by the limited company Notodden Lufthavn AS, which is again owned by Notodden Municipality. Tuven is dominated by general aviation, in part organized by Notodden flyklubb and Kongsberg flyklubb. In 2010, the airport had 5,078 aircraft movements and 3,423 passengers, making it the scheduled airport in Norway the fewest passengers. Flyteknisk, a retailer and maintainer of Cessna aircraft, including seaplanes, is based at the airport.

Lahore College for Women University, established in May 1922 as an intermediate residential college, was originally housed in a building on Hall Road, Lahore, with strength of 60 students (25 boarders) and 13 staff members. By 1950, the College strength increased to 600 students and was shifted to the present building on Jail Road. LCWU by 1922 was affiliated with the University of the Punjab for undergraduate program in 18 subjects. Within the next two years the institution had graduate programs in 14 subjects. Post graduate classes in English were initiated in 1940 and Honours classes in five subjects were introduced in 1949. B.Sc. classes started in 1955 while Post-graduate classes in the subjects of Economics and Physics started in 1966. By 1979 Islamic Studies, Political Science and Psychology were also added to the ever increasing list of programs. The year 1990, when Administrative and Financial Autonomy was given to the institution, proved to be the turning point in the history of LCWU. On 13 August 1999, it was declared a Degree-Awarding institution. The institution was elevated to the status of a Women University on 10 September 2002. The 21st century has brought a drastic revolution in science, which has completely transformed the world. Today sciences are exploring areas that defy imagination. Keeping in line with the importance of the sciences in today's world, LCWU has been fulfilling the demand of the female students in the area, as this was the only institution offering science subjects at undergraduate level. This is evident from the fact that majority of the female doctors, serving and retired, have at some stage (F.Sc. or B.Sc.) studied at Lahore College for Women. Since 1922 the college has proved its worth as the highest seat of learning for science subjects. At the moment Botany, Chemistry, Physics, Zoology, Bio-Technology, Mathematics, Economics, Statistics, Electronics, Environmental Science, Computer Science and Pharmacy are taught at Graduate, Postgraduate and Doctoral levels. LCWU is cognizant of the significance of social sciences and liberal arts since they contribute to the aesthetic sense of human beings and are essential for the society. The Department of English, being more than 70 years old, is the oldest post- graduate department of the University. Founded by Prof Mrs. U.K. Siraj-ud-Din, it still is rooted in the traditions of scholarship and academic excellence. Besides English, Urdu, Punjabi, Islamic Studies, International Relations, Political Science, Fine Arts, Pakistan Studies, Mass Communication and Gender and Development Studies are being offered at graduate and postgraduate level. The graduates of LCWU take their place in moral, intellectual and professional leadership in all walks of national life. Among its alumni are an extra ordinary number of teachers, physicians and professionals in all fields of life. At F.A./F.Sc. level the Intermediate College of LCWU is affiliated with the Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education, Lahore for the purpose of examinations.

A frame of reference is a coordinate system used to identify the physical location of an object. In languages, different frames of reference can be used. They are: the relative frame of reference, the intrinsic frame of reference, and the absolute frame of reference. Each frame of reference in a language can be associated with distinct linguistic expressions. Classification of frames of reference =Intrinsic frame of reference= Intrinsic frame of reference is a binary spatial relation in which the location of an object is defined in relation to a part of another object (its side, back, front, etc.). For instance, \\"The cat is in front of the house\\" means that the cat is at that part of the house that is its front, the side of the house that faces the street and has an entrance and maybe a porch. =Absolute frame of reference= Absolute frame of reference is also a binary system in which the location of an object is defined in relation to arbitrary fixed bearings, such as cardinal directions (North, South, East, West). For instance, “The cat is to the south of the house” has the location of the cat described independently of the position of the speaker or of any part of the house (as in intrinsic frame of reference). Apart from cardinal directions, fixed bearings such as seacoast, upriver/downriver, and uphill/downhill/across are also used. =Relative frame of reference= Relative frame of reference is a ternary system. The location of an object is expressed in relation to both the viewpoint of the perceiver and position of another object. Thus, “The cat is to the left of the house” refers to three points of reference: the cat, the house, and the perceiver himself. Use of different frames of reference People can use multiple frames of reference in communication. For instance, in English, all three frames of reference are available and used, but the use of absolute frame of reference is limited to topographic objects (\\"Finland is to the east of Sweden\\"). The preferred frame of reference is the relative one. Among languages that rely largely on absolute frame of reference there are a lot of Australian aboriginal languages (for instance, Arrernte language, Guugu Yimithirr) and some Mayan languages (for instance, Tzeltal). In Guugu Yimithirr there is no way to say \\"The cat is to the left of the house,\\" and the only way to describe the location of the cat in relation to the house is \\"The cat is to the south of the house.\\" To languages that rely largely on intrinsic frame of reference belong, for instance, Mopan (a Mayan language) or Totonac (a Totonacan language). The use of different frames of reference has a far-reaching effect on the cognition. For instance, in order to be able to communicate in a language with absolute frame of reference the speakers have to run a kind of a mental compass, a remarkable neurocognitive capacity allowing the speakers to identify cardinal directions even in unfamiliar locations.

Born in Buffalo, New York, he adopted the stage name Eugene Stratton and spent most of his career in British music halls. Stratton was a member of the Grand Order of Water Rats.  Biography  Stratton first performed at the age of 10 in an acrobatic act called the Two Welsleys. He appeared as a dancer in 1873 under the name of Master Jean. He spent some time in a circus before joining a minstrel group. He went to England in 1880 and was by this time using the name of Stratton. In England, he worked his way up to the main song & dance man in the Moore & Burgess Minstrel Show, and in 1883 he married Moore's daughter, Annie Matilda Moore. He left the minstrels to go on the music hall circuit in 1887, first as a double act, then solo. Although at one time he used an Irish voice, he mainly appeared as a \\"black-faced\\" singer. He also performed in pantomime, for the first time in 1896. His friendship & association with Leslie Stuart gave him many of the songs for which he was known. During the period 1899 to 1911 he made records of most of Stuart's songs. He died in Christchurch, Hampshire on September 15, 1918, and is buried in Bandon Hill Cemetery in Wallington in Surrey. In 1935 his friend Joe Elvin was buried next to him.Music Hall and Variety Artistes Burial Places at www.arthurlloyd.co.uk In James Joyce’s novel Ulysses (1922) in the fifteenth episode “Circe”, there are references to Stratton, as well as the adoption of a faux Negro dialect.

In recent years, topoisomerases have become popular targets for cancer chemotherapy treatments. It is thought that topoisomerase inhibitors block the ligation step of the cell cycle, generating single and double stranded breaks that harm the integrity of the genome. Introduction of these breaks subsequently leads to apoptosis and cell death. Topoisomerase inhibitors can also function as antibacterial agents. Quinolones (including nalidixic acid and ciprofloxacin) have this function. Quinolones bind to these enzymes and prevent them from decatenation replicating DNA. Classification Topoisomerase inhibitors are often divided according to the enzyme they inhibit: * Topoisomerase I inhibitors: irinotecan, topotecan, camptothecin, diflomotecan and lamellarin D all target type IB topoisomerases, * Topoisomerase II inhibitors: etoposide (VP-16), teniposide, doxorubicin, daunorubicin, mitoxantrone, amsacrine, ellipticines, aurintricarboxylic acid, and HU-331, a quinone synthesized from cannabidiol. Numerous plant derived natural phenols (ex. EGCG, genistein, quercetin, resveratrol) possess strong topoisomerase inhibitory properties affecting both types of enzymes. They may express function of phytoalexins - compounds produced by plants to combat vermin and pests. Use of topoisomerase inhibitors for antineoplastic treatments may lead to secondary neoplasms because of DNA damaging properties of the compounds. Also plant derived polyphenols shows signs of carcinogenity, especially in fetuses and neonates who do not detoxify the compounds sufficiently. An association between high intake of tea (containing polyphenols) during pregnancy and elevated risk of childhood malignant central nervous system (CNS) tumours has been found. Type I topoisomerase inhibitors Human DNA topoisomerase I (Top1) is an essential enzyme that relaxes DNA supercoiling during replication and transcription. Top1 generates DNA single-strand breaks that allow rotation of the cleaved strand around the double helix axis. Top1 also re-ligates the cleaved strand to reestablish intact duplex DNA. The Top1-DNA intermediates, known as cleavage complexes, are transient and at low levels under normal circumstances. However, treatment with Top1 inhibitors, such as the camptothecins, stabilize the cleavable complexes, prevent DNA religation and induce lethal DNA strand breaks. Cancer cells are selectively sensitive to the generation of these DNA lesions. Top1 is a validated target for the treatment of human cancers. Camptothecins are among the most effective anticancer agents recently introduced into clinical practice. In this regard, the camptothecin derivative topotecan (Hycamtin) is approved by the U.S. FDA for the treatment of ovarian and lung cancer. Another camptothecin derivative irinotecan (CPT11) is approved for the treatment of colon cancer. There are, however, certain clinical limitations of the camptothecin derivatives. These include: 1) spontaneous inactivation to a lactone form in blood, 2) rapid reversal of the trapped cleavable complex after drug removal, requiring prolonged infusions, 3) resistance of cancer cells overexpressing membrane transporters, and 4) dose-limiting side effects of diarrhea and neutropenia. To circumvent these limitations, Dr. Mark Cushman at Purdue University and Dr. Yves Pommier at the National Cancer Institute developed the non-camptothecin family of indenoisoquinoline inhibitors of Top1. In contrast to the camptothecins, the indenoisoquinolines are: 1) chemically stable in blood, 2) inhibitors of Top1 cleavable complexes at distinct sites, 3) not substrates of membrane transporters, and 4) more effective as anti-tumor agents in animal models. The preclinical and IND package filed with the US Food and Drug Administration along with complete GMP production supporting the lead molecule are components of the published and non-published information covered by the license agreement with Purdue Research Foundation the National Cancer Center and Linus Oncology, Inc. Linus Oncology has licensed the intellectual property that covers the development of these and related indenoisoquinoline derivatives. Phase I Study in Adults With Relapsed Solid Tumors and Lymphomas is ongoing (2012). Indenoisoquinolines (green) form a ternary complexes of Top1 (brown) and DNA (blue) (Pommier et al.) and act as interfacial inhibitors. There are several advantages of these novel non-camptothecin Top1 inhibitors as compared to the FDA-approved camptothecin analogs: * They are synthetic and chemically stable compounds * The Top1 cleavage sites trapped by the indenoisoquinolines have different genomic locations, implying differential targeting of cancer cell genomes * The Top1 cleavage complexes trapped by indenoisoquinolines are more stable, indicative of prolonged drug action * The indenoisoquinolines are seldom or not used as substrates for the multidrug resistance efflux pumps (ABCG2 and MDR-1) Based on these highly favorable characteristics, two indenoisoquinoline derivatives (from a series of > 400 molecules), indotecan (LMP400; NSC 743400) and indimitecan (LMP776; NSC 725776) are presently under evaluation in a Phase I clinical trial being conducted at the National Cancer Institute for patients with relapsed solid tumors and lymphomas.http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01051635 Type II topoisomerase inhibitors These inhibitors are split into two main classes: topoisomerase poisons, which target the topoisomerase-DNA complex, and topoisomerase inhibitors, which disrupt catalytic turnover. =Topo II poisons= Examples of topoisomerase poisons include the following: *eukaryotic type II topoisomerase inhibitors (topo II): amsacrine, etoposide, etoposide phosphate, teniposide and doxorubicin. These drugs are anti-cancer therapies. *bacterial type II topoisomerase inhibitors (gyrase and topo IV): fluoroquinolones. These are antibacterials and include fluoroquinolones such as ciprofloxacin. Some of these poisons encourage the forward cleavage reaction (fluoroquinolones), while other poisons prevent the re-ligation of DNA (etoposide and teniposide). Poisons of type IIA topoisomerases can target prokaryotic and eukaryotic enzymes preferentially, making them attractive drug candidates. Ciprofloxacin targets prokaryotes in excess of a thousandfold more than it targets eukaryotic topo IIs. Despite this, Ciprofloxacin is a potent dose-dependent type II poison, which is why it causes mass destruction of tissue cells. This poor safety profile is one reason the FDA has advised fluoroquinolones only be used as a treatment of last resort. =Topo II inhibitors= These inhibitors target the N-terminal ATPase domain of topo II and prevent topo II from turning over. Examples of topoisomerase inhibitors include : *ICRF-193. The structure of this compound bound to the ATPase domain was solved by Classen (Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 2004) showing that the drug binds in a non-competitive manner and locks down the dimerization of the ATPase domain. * genistein. Synthetic lethality with deficient WRN expression Synthetic lethality arises when a combination of deficiencies in the expression of two or more genes leads to cell death, whereas a deficiency in expression of only one of these genes does not. The deficiencies can arise through mutations, epigenetic alterations or inhibitors of the genes. Synthetic lethality with the topoisomerase inhibitor irinotecan appears to occur when given to cancer patients with deficient expression of the DNA repair gene WRN. The analysis of 630 human primary tumors in 11 tissues shows that hypermethylation of the WRN CpG island promoter (with loss of expression of WRN protein) is a common event in tumorigenesis. WRN is repressed in about 38% of colorectal cancers and non-small-cell lung carcinomas and in about 20% or so of stomach cancers, prostate cancers, breast cancers, non-Hodgkin lymphomas and chondrosarcomas, plus at significant levels in the other cancers evaluated. The WRN protein helicase is important in homologous recombinational DNA repair and also has roles in non-homologous end joining DNA repair and base excision DNA repair. A 2006 retrospective study, with long clinical follow-up, was made of colon cancer patients treated with the topoisomerase inhibitor irinotecan. In this study, 45 patients had hypermethylated WRN gene promoters and 43 patients had unmethylated WRN promoters. Irinotecan was more strongly beneficial for patients with hypermethylated WRN promoters (39.4 months survival) than for those with unmethylated WRN promoters (20.7 months survival). Thus, a topoisomerase inhibitor appeared to be especially synthetically lethal with deficient WRN expression. Further evaluations have also indicated synthetic lethality of deficient expression of WRN and topoisomerase inhibitors.

Simply put, the more independent witnesses that report an event or saying, the better.  Examples of its use  The gospels are not always independent of each other. Matthew and Luke, for example, are likely dependent on Mark. The criterion of multiple attestation focuses on the sayings or deeds of Jesus that are attested to in more than one independent literary source such as Apostle Paul, Josephus, Q and/or the Gospel of the Hebrews. The force of this criterion is increased if a given motif or theme is also found in different literary forms such as parables, dispute stories, miracle stories, prophecy, and/or aphorism.Catherine M. Murphy, The Historical Jesus For Dummies, For Dummies Pub., 2007. p 14, 61-77John P. Meier, A Marginal Jew, Yale University Press, 2009. Multiple attestation has a certain kind of objectivity. Given the independence of the sources, satisfaction of the criterion makes it harder to maintain that it was an invention of the Church. Still, this criterion, however useful, is typically one of a number of criteria, such as the criterion of discontinuity and the criterion of embarrassment, along with the historical method. For example the \\"Kingdom of God\\" motif appears in \\"Mark, Q, the Gospel of the Hebrews, special Lucan tradition, and John, with echoes in Paul, despite the fact that 'Kingdom of God' is not Paul's preferred way of speaking.\\" It also appears in an array of literary genres. The words attributed to Jesus on the bread and wine during the Last Supper (found in Mark, Paul, the Didache and arguably in John) and on divorce (found in Mark and Paul) are examples of sayings that are multiply attested. An example of an event that is multiply attested is Jesus's meeting with John the Baptist (found in Mark and John).Bart D. Ehrman, Jesus: Apocalyptic Prophet of the New Millennium, Oxford, 1999. pp 90–91.John P. Meier, A Marginal Jew: Rethinking the Historical Jesus, Doubleday, 1991. v. 1, pp 174–175, 317Stanley E. Porter, The Criteria for Authenticity in Historical-Jesus Research: Previous Discussion and New Proposals Sheffield Academic Press, 2000.Gerd ThiessenThiessen, & Dagmar Winter. The Quest for the Plausible Jesus: The Question of Criteria, Westminster John Knox Press, 2002.  Limitations  This criterion cannot be used for sources that are not independent. For example, a saying that occurs in all three Synoptic Gospels may only represent one source. Under the two- source hypothesis, both the authors of the Gospel of Matthew and the Gospel of Luke used the Gospel of Mark in their writings; therefore, triple-tradition material represents only a single source, Mark. (The Augustinian hypothesis posits that Mark and Luke used Matthew, so once again triple-tradition material would have originated in a single source). Another limitation is that some sayings or deeds attributed to Jesus could have originated in the first Christian communities early enough in the tradition to be attested to by a number of independent sources, thus not representing the historical Jesus. Finally, there are some sayings or deeds of Jesus that only appear in one form or source that scholars still consider historically probable. Multiple attestation is not always a requisite for historicity, nor is it enough to determine accuracy by itself. The criterion is one of a number of factors that have been developed by scholars to assess whether a tradition is likely to be historical; the widely-recognized criteria were distinguished by Stanley E. Porter as dissimilarity, coherence, multiple attestation, least distinctiveness and Aramaic linguistic background. Porter suggests three new criteria in the search for the words of the historical Jesus (Porter 2000), which have not yet found broad acceptance: a criterion of Greek language, of Greek textual variance and of \\"discourse features\\" at variance with the text's usual style. Of the criterion of multiple attestations, Porter makes the point, which has been expressed before, that multiple attestations identify common motifs rather than absolute wording, and speak only to the independence of documents and not their reliability (Porter 2000:86).

Walsh Francis Patrick \\"Frank\\" Walsh (July 20, 1864 – May 2, 1939) was an American lawyer. Walsh was noted for his advocacy of progressive causes, including Georgist land value tax, improved working conditions, better pay for workers, and equal employment opportunities for all, including women. He was appointed to several high-profile committees to investigate and report on working conditions. He was also active in championing independence for Ireland. Biography =Early years= Frank P. Walsh was born in St. Louis, Missouri, on July 20, 1864, into humble circumstances. At age 10 he dropped out of public school and worked as a telegraph boy in St. Louis. He taught himself stenography, and was considered expert in that craft when he was admitted to the bar in 1889. Walsh was employed as a clerk in lawyers' offices. In 1885 he moved to Kansas City, Missouri, and began working in the office of noted KC lawyer Gardiner Lathrop (who is famous for co-founding the Kansas City Country Club, among other things). He gained sufficient experience in legal matters in that employment that he passed the bar exam in 1889 and immediately began to practice law in KC. In 1891 Walsh married Katherine O'Flaherty of Kansas City. They eventually had nine children, seven of whom lived to adulthood: Katherine Marie, Sarah Louise, Cecilia, Virginia, Jerome Karnes, James, and John Frederick.Men Who Made Kansas City =Career= Walsh was active in KC municipal improvement projects, and was a member of the Commercial Club in 1913 when he was nominated by President Woodrow Wilson to head the newly formed Commission on Industrial Relations.Walsh told a reporter, \\"Our purpose is to inquire into the general conditions of labor in the principal industries of the United States, including agriculture, into relations between employers and employees, conditions of sanitation, safety, methods for avoiding or adjusting labor disputes through mediation and negotiation, the smuggling of Asiatics into the United States or its possessions, and the underlying causes of dissatisfaction in the industrial situation.\\" New York Times, 27 Sept. 1913 Walsh investigated labor-management clashes from 1913 to 1918, and in 1918 was named co-chairman (with ex- President William Howard Taft) of the National War Labor Board. Walsh was an Irish nationalist who chaired the American Commission on Irish Independence.http://www.digital.library.villanova.edu/Joseph%20McGarrity%20Collection/Joseph%20McGarrity%20Papers/JosephMcGarrityPapers-00496.xml Letter from Éamon de Valera to Walsh, requesting aid in selling bonds to American supporters of Irish Independence efforts He fell out of favor with Wilson for pushing for US recognition of the proclaimed Irish Republic. Walsh's activities in behalf of Irish Independence were analyzed by author Julie E. Manning in her 1989 book, Frank P. Walsh and the Irish Question.https://openlibrary.org/books/OL2213985M/Frank_P._Walsh_and_the_Irish_question In 1919 Walsh was retained by the National Women's Trade Union League, whose members had been ousted from their jobs as streetcar conductors at the conclusion of World War I. Walsh argued before the War Labor Board that women had the same rights as men to work. At the end of the case the WLB found in favor of the women's organization, and reversed a lower-court ruling on the subject.The Woman Citizen, Social Feminism in the 1920s by J. Stanley Lemons (1990), p. 23 The headline from a 14 April 1922 article in The New York Times concerning Walsh's court maneuvers indicates how Walsh was seen by the nation: \\"FORGET THE LAW, HE URGES\\".

The newspaper was founded in 1854, and had an audited average daily circulation at the end of 2017 of 8,828. It claims to have been the UK's first provincial 'penny-paper'.A newspaper to support the cause of the common man holdthefrontpage.co.uk accessed 11 December 2006 It is owned by Newsquest, the UK subsidiary of U.S.-based Gannett Company. It is the original of the four newspapers headquartered in the Newsquest Wiltshire building in Victoria Road, Swindon, the others being three weeklies: *Gazette and Herald *Swindon Star *Wiltshire Times History The Swindon Advertiser was founded in 1854 by William Morris (Great Grandfather of Desmond Morris). Originally intended to be a weekly paper, His aim was to produce a newspaper \\"that would act as a mouthpiece for the poor.\\" Morris decided to print one issue a month due to the Stamp Tax laws at the time only applying to newspapers published every 28 days. It was originally printed as a broadsheet on 6 February 1854 and titled the \\"Swindon Advertiser and Monthly Record\\" using a hand press in his father's shop in Wood Street. Morris was sole writer, editor, printer and also delivered it personally, selling each copy for a penny. Using the inclusion of advertisements from local businesses, the second edition doubled in size. Other newspaper companies were influenced by Morris' example of a penny priced paper and quickly produced their own in the region and ultimately throughout the country, resulting in the government amending the stamp tax laws to a more favourable version. The paper became published weekly due to this change. In 1855 Morris could afford to move the publication to new premises in Victoria Road where it has remained. Morris funded the building of Newspaper House and added a printing shop to the rear. Morris became infamous in some circles for his scathing and often vitriolic editorials, with one editorial about an incident at Coate Water in 1861 leading to effigies of him and copies of his paper being burned in the town. In the same year, the paper was printed using steam power for the first time. Using a boiler and engine built in the Swindon Works of the Great Western Railway, they produced 5,000 copies a week. In 1870, it was renamed the \\"Swindon Advertiser and Wiltshire, Berkshire and Gloucestershire Chronicle\\". William Morris died at the age of 65 in 1891 and the paper passed into the hands of his three sons, William, Samuel and Frank. Daily publishing began in 1898, with it being renamed the \\"Evening Advertiser\\" in 1926. The company also acquired the \\"North Wiltshire Herald\\" in 1922, now titled the \\"Gazette and Herald\\". Due to paper shortages, the paper became a tabloid during the 1940s,The changing face of the Evening Advertiser holdthefrontpage.co.uk accessed 11 December 2006 switching back to the broadsheet format after the war. With the advances in technology, the paper moved to desktop publishing methods in the 1980s and then on 6 September 1995 changed back to being published as a tabloid. In July 2005, the paper changed its name back to the \\"Swindon Advertiser\\" and announced its intention to publish two editions a day,Name change for the Evening Advertiser holdthefrontpage.co.uk accessed 11 December 2006 with this change came a price rise from 32p to 35p. In 2006 the two editions per day were dropped and only one daily edition was printed, the price remained at 35p. The paper went to print at 04.00am each morning and was generally on the shelves by 07.00am, distributed by a fleet of transit vans across Wiltshire. In November 2008 the paper's cover price was increased from 35p to 38p. It currently stands at 65p after being pushed up in price late 2010 to 42p and again in 2013. Due to a petition raised and successfully imposed by Mathew Purvis (a local Swindon resident) the price will remain fixed at 65p for at least until 2016. This was raised on the basis that the key demographic for the paper was populated by those suffering from a dip in the economy, and was designed to create and raise a community morale.

He was then Chief Technical Officer for Williams F1 from June 2011 to July 2013, before abruptly stepping down \\"with immediate effect,\\" according to the team. Career Coughlan studied mechanical engineering at Brunel University, graduating in 1981. =Early career= He first designed cars for Tiga Race Cars, which competed in junior formulae, until 1984, when he joined the Lotus Formula One team. As the team's fortunes waned, it was reorganised at the end of 1990, and Coughlan joined John Barnard's design company as it switched between producing chassis for Benetton, Ferrari and Arrows. Barnard parted company with Arrows after falling out with Tom Walkinshaw during the 1998 season, but Coughlan stayed on, taking the role of Technical Director in the following year. When Arrows collapsed in 2002, he was invited to join McLaren. His A23 car, developed in 2002 for Arrows before the team folded, became the Super Aguri team's SA05 racecar four years later. =Ferrari espionage case= On 3 July 2007, Coughlan was suspended by McLaren following allegations of espionage against Ferrari.

To be precise, the BLS routinely computes many different CPIs that are used for different purposes. Each is a time series measure of the price of consumer goods and services. The BLS publishes the CPI monthly. Different indices computed by the BLS The BLS started the statistic in 1919. It currently computes thousands of consumer price indices, beginning with monthly average prices for each of 8,018 category-area combinations (211 categories of consumption items in 38 urban geographical areas). They also track how much of each of these category area combinations is in the \\"market basket\\" consumed by different groups of people. Different published consumer price indices differ in the weights, including the target consumer group and how frequently the weights are updated. The weights for many indices are modified only in January of even-numbered years and are held constant for the next two years. However, weights for the chained CPI (C-CPI-U) are updated each month, so they more accurately track short term shifts in consumption patterns. =CPI for urban wage earners and clerical workers (CPI-W)= The urban wage earner and clerical worker population consists of consumer units consisting of clerical workers, sales workers, craft workers, operative, service workers, or laborers. (Excluded from this population are professional, managerial, and technical workers; the self-employed; short-term workers; the unemployed; and retirees and others not in the labor force.\\"Prices\\" (Section 14). Statistical Abstract of the United States: 2006) More than one half of the consumer unit's income has to be earned from the above occupations, and at least one of the members must be employed for 37 weeks or more in an eligible occupation. The consumer price index for urban wage earners and clerical workers (CPI-W) is a continuation of the historical index that was introduced after World War I for use in wage negotiation. As new uses were developed for the CPI, the need for a broader and more representative index became apparent. The Social Security Administration uses the CPI-W as the basis for its periodic COLA (cost-of-living adjustment). =CPI for all urban consumers (CPI-U)= The all-urban consumer population consists of all urban households in metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) and in urban places of 2,500 inhabitants or more. Non-farm consumers living in rural areas within MSAs are included, but the index excludes rural consumers and the military and institutional population. The consumer price index for all urban consumers (CPI-U) introduced in 1978 is representative of the buying habits of approximately 80 percent of the non-institutional population of the United States, compared with 32 percent represented in the CPI-W. The methodology for producing the index is the same for both populations. =Core CPI= The core CPI index excludes goods with high price volatility, such as food and energy. This measure of core inflation systematically excludes food and energy prices because, historically, they have been highly volatile and non-systemic. More specifically, food and energy prices are widely thought to be subject to large changes that often fail to persist and do not represent relative price changes. In many instances, large movements in food and energy prices arise because of supply disruptions such as drought or OPEC-led cutbacks in production. This was introduced in the early 1970s when food and especially oil prices were quite volatile, and the Fed wanted an index that was less subject to short term shocks. However, on January 25, 2012, the Fed announced they would stop using the core CPI and rely instead on the personal consumption expenditures price index. =Chained CPI for all urban consumers (C-CPI-U)= This index applies to the same target population as the CPI-U, but the weights are updated each month. This allows the weights to evolve more gracefully with people's consumption patterns; for CPI-U, the weights are changed only in January of even-numbered years and are held constant for the next two years. =CPI for the elderly (CPI-E)= Since at least 1982, the BLS has also computed a consumer price index for the elderly to account for the fact that the consumption patterns of seniors are different from those of younger people. For the BLS, \\"elderly\\" means that the reference person or a spouse is at least 62 years of age; approximately 24 percent of all consumer units meet this definition. Individuals in this group consume roughly double the amount of medical care as all consumers in CPI-U or employees in CPI-W. In January of each year, Social Security recipients receive a cost of living adjustment (COLA) \\"to ensure that the purchasing power of Social Security and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits is not eroded by inflation. It is based on the percentage increase in the consumer price index for urban wage earners and clerical workers (CPI-W)\\". However, from December 1982 through December 2011, the all-items CPI-E rose at an annual average rate of 3.1 percent, compared with increases of 2.9 percent for both the CPI-U and CPI-W. This suggests that the elderly have been losing purchasing power at the rate of roughly 0.2 (=3.1–2.9) percentage points per year. In 2003 Hobijn and Lagakos estimated that the social security trust fund would run out of money in 40 years using CPI-W and in 35 years using CPI-E. Uses * As an economic indicator. As the most widely used measure of inflation, the CPI is an indicator of the effectiveness of government fiscal and monetary policy. Especially for inflation targeting monetary policy by the Federal Reserve; however, the Federal Reserve System has recently begun favoring the personal consumption expenditures price index (PCE) over the CPI as a measure of inflation. Business executives, labor leaders, and other private citizens also use the CPI as a guide in making economic decisions. * As a deflator of other economic series. The CPI and its components are used to adjust other economic series for price change and to translate these series into inflation-free dollars. * As a means for indexation (i.e. adjusting income payments). Over 2 million workers are covered by collective bargaining agreements which tie wages to the CPI. In the United States, the index affects the income of almost 80 million people as a result of statutory action: 47.8 million Social Security beneficiaries, about 4.1 million military and Federal civil service retirees and survivors, and about 22.4 million food stamp recipients. Changes in the CPI also affect the cost of lunches for the 26.7 million children who eat lunch at school. Some private firms and individuals use the CPI to keep rents, royalties, alimony payments and child support payments in line with changing prices. Since 1985, the CPI has been used to adjust the Federal income tax structure to prevent inflation-induced increases in taxes. History US Historical Inflation Ancient The Consumer Price Index was initiated during World War I, when rapid increases in prices, particularly in shipbuilding centers, made an index essential for calculating cost-of-living adjustments in wages. To provide appropriate weighting patterns for the index, it reflected the relative importance of goods and services purchased in 92 different industrial centers in 1917–1919. Periodic collection of prices was started, and in 1919 the Bureau of Labor Statistics began publication of separate indexes for 32 cities. Regular publication of a national index, the U.S. city average began in 1921, and indexes were estimated back to 1913 using records of food prices. Because people's buying habits had changed substantially, a new study was made covering expenditures in the years 1934–1936, which provided the basis for a comprehensively revised index introduced in 1940. During World War II, when many commodities were scarce and goods were rationed, the index weights were adjusted temporarily to reflect these shortages. In 1951, the BLS again made interim adjustments, based on surveys of consumer expenditures in seven cities between 1947 and 1949, to reflect the most important effects of immediate postwar changes in buying patterns. The index was again revised in 1953 and 1964. In 1978, the index was revised to reflect the spending patterns based upon the surveys of consumer expenditures conducted in 1972–1974. A new and expanded 85-area sample was selected based on the 1970 Census of Population. The Point-of-Purchase Survey (POPS) was also introduced. POPS eliminated reliance on outdated secondary sources for screening samples of establishments or outlets where prices are collected. A second, more broadly based CPI for All Urban Consumers, the CPI-U was also introduced. The CPI-U took into account the buying patterns of professional and salaried workers, part-time workers, the self-employed, the unemployed, and retired people, in addition to wage earners and clerical workers. =The hidden change in prices of housing= In January 1983, housing prices were replaced with owners' equivalent of rent because rents are more stable. Because house prices rose and fell more than rents during the housing bubble and crash, housing's effects on inflation and deflation are not reflected in the CPI. Perceived errors in estimation =Perceived overestimation of inflation= In 1995, the Senate Finance Committee appointed a commission to study CPI's ability to estimate inflation. The CPI commission found in their study that the index overestimated the cost of living by a value between 0.8 and 1.6 percentage points. If CPI overestimates inflation, then claims that real wages have fallen over time could be unfounded. An overestimation of only a few tenths of a percentage point per annum compounds dramatically over time. In the 1970s and 80s the federal government began indexing several transfers and taxes including social security (see below Uses of the CPI). The overestimation of CPI would imply that the increases in these taxes and transfers have been greater than necessary, meaning the government and taxpayers have overpaid for them. The Commission concluded that more than half of the overestimation was due to slow adjustments in the index to new products or changes in product quality. At that time, the weights for indices like CPI-U and CPI-W were updated only once per decade; today, they are updated in January of even-numbered years. However, even with this more frequent updates, the CPI-U and CPI-W might still be excessively slow in responding to new technologies. For example, by 1996 there were over 47 million cellular phone users in the United States, but the weights for the CPI did not account for this new product until 1998. This new product lowered costs of communication when away from the home. The commission recommended that the BLS update weights more frequently to prevent upward bias in the index from a failure to properly account for the benefits of new products. Additional upward biases were said to come from several other sources. Fixed weights do not accommodate consumer substitutions among commodities, such as buying more chicken when the price of beef increases. The real price of chicken fell rather sharply relative to beef over the past several decades. Because the CPI assumes that people continue to buy beef, it would increase even if people are buying chicken instead. However, this is by design: the CPI measures the change in expenses required for people to maintain the same standard of living.http://www.bls.gov/cpi/cpiqa.htm#Question_3 The Commission also found that 99% of all data were collected during the week, although an increasing amount of purchases happen during the weekend. Additional bias was said to stem from changes in retailing that were unaccounted for in the CPI. =Perceived underestimation of inflation= Some critics believe however, that because of changes to the way that the CPI is calculated, and because energy and food price changes were excluded from the Federal Reserve's calculation of \\"core inflation\\", that inflation is being dramatically underestimated.The great inflation cover-up The second argument is unrelated to the CPI, except insofar as the calculation of CPI is modified in response to a perceived overstatement of inflation. The Federal Reserve's policy of ignoring food and energy prices when making interest rate decisions is often confused with the measurement of the CPI by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The BLS publishes both a headline CPI which counts food and energy prices, and also a CPI for \\"all items less food and energy\\", or \\"core\\" CPI. None of the prominent legislated uses of the CPI excludes food and energy.http://www.bls.gov/cpi/cpiqa.htm However, with regard to calculating inflation, the Federal Reserve no longer uses the CPI, preferring to use core PCE instead. Some critics believe that changes in CPI calculation due to the Boskin Commission have led to dramatic cuts in inflation estimates. They believe that using pre-Boskin methods, which they also think are still used by most other countries, the current U.S. inflation is estimated to be around 7% per year. The BLS maintains that these beliefs are based on misunderstandings of the CPI. For example, the BLS has stated that changes made due to the introduction of the geometric mean formula to account for product substitution (one of the Boskin recommended changes) have lowered the measured rate of inflation by less than 0.3% per year, and the methods now used are commonly employed in the CPIs of developed nations.Addressing misconceptions about the Consumer Price Index Method of calculation The calculation of the CPI involves a hybrid methodology consisting of two stages: In the first stage, elementary indices are created to show the price levels of very similar goods in the same area. For instance, there is an elementary index for \\"sports equipment in Seattle\\".Chapter 17, BLS handbook (06/2007 revision). Page 33. As of June 2007, there are 8,018 of these elementary indices [8,018 = 211 * 38, where 211 is the number of categories (\\"item strata\\") and 38 is the number of geographical areas considered].Chapter 17, BLS handbook (06/2007 revision, page 3). All but a few of the elementary indices are based on geometric mean formulas. In the second stage, the elementary indices are combined to create a number of aggregate indices, including the CPI. (The CPI is an aggregate of all 8,018 basic indices. BLS also computes other aggregates computed uses smaller subsets of the basic indices. For instance, there is an all-items index for Boston, and an all-areas index for electricity.) These aggregate indices (including the CPI) are calculated using a Laspeyres index computed as: : \\\\Delta P_L = \\\\frac{\\\\sum_{i} p_{i_{1}}\\\\, q_{i_{0}}}{\\\\sum_{i} p_{i_{0}}\\\\, q_{i_{0}}} where: \\\\, \\\\Delta P_{L} is the relative change in price level, \\\\, p_{i_{0}} is the price of each good \\\\, i in the first period, \\\\, q_{i_{0}} is the quantity of each good \\\\, i in the first period, \\\\, p_{i_{1}} is the price of each good \\\\, i in the second period. =Weights of the CPI= The weight (or quantities, to use the above terminology) of an item in the CPI is derived from the expenditure on that item as estimated by the Consumer Expenditure Survey. This survey provides data on the average expenditure on selected items, such as white bread, gasoline and so on, that were purchased by the index population during the survey period. In a fixed-weight index such as CPI-U, the implicit quantity of any item used in calculating the index remains the same from month to month. A related concept is the relative importance of an item. The relative importance shows the share of total expenditure that would occur if quantities consumed were unaffected by changes in relative prices and actually remained constant. Although the implicit quantity weights remain fixed, the relative importance changes over time, reflecting average price changes. Items registering a greater than average price increase (or smaller decrease) become relatively more important. =Method evaluation= This two-stage method is relatively new. Before 1999, CPI used only Laspeyres indices, measures of the price changes in a fixed market basket of consumption goods and services of constant quantity and quality bought on average by urban consumers, either for all urban consumers (CPI-U) or for urban wage earners and clerical workers (CPI-W). It is argued that Laspeyres index systematically overstates inflation because it does not take into account changes in the quantities consumed that may occur as a response to price changes. The Laspeyres formula works under the assumption that consumers always buy the same amount of each good in the market basket, no matter what the price. The geometric mean price index formula used to calculate many of the elementary indices, in contrast, assumes that consumers will always spend the same amount of money on a good and shift the quantity they buy of that good based on the price. Critics argue that consumers standard of living has declined if price increases force them from preferred to less preferred goods. This logic suggests that the geometric mean price formula understates inflation.

Camp history The camp was built in September 1939 to house Polish prisoners from the German invasion of Poland. The first prisoners arrived there on 18 October 1939. On 22 May 1940 all 1,336 Polish prisoners were transferred to Oflag VII-A Murnau, and were replaced with British, French and Belgian officers taken prisoner during the battle of France and Belgium. In the summer of 1941 Australians and New Zealanders captured in Greece and Crete during the Balkans Campaign arrived in the camp. In Rommel's second offensive on Tobruk in June 1942, most of the South African 2nd Division was captured. Many of these soldiers were interned at Oflag VII-B. On 31 August 1942 Canadian officers captured during the Dieppe Raid arrived. Soon after their arrival the senior Canadian officer, Brigadier W.W. Southam, convened a conference which compiled an after action report on the Raid. This was recorded in shorthand in a notebook labelled \\"Shorthand Reading Exercises. O. Henry's Short Stories\\", which after the war was donated to the archives of the Historical Section of the Canadian Army HQ. In September 1942, British officers from Oflag VI-B Dössel, were transferred to VII-B after a mass escape (the \\"Warburg Wire Job\\"). Within months two officers from Dössel, Lieutenant Jock Hamilton- Baillie and Captain Frank Weldon, proposed digging a tunnel north from Block 2's latrine to a villager's chicken coop about away. Work began in December 1942, but the rocky ground made digging difficult. The Germans found spoil from the tunnel and searched the camp, but failed to find it. The tunnel was completed in May, and on the night of 3/4 June 1943 sixty-five men escaped. Most of them headed south, towards Switzerland, sleeping by day and travelling by night. Eventually, all 65 were recaptured, but had occupied over 50,000 police, soldiers, home guard and Hitler Youth for a week. After two weeks detention in nearby Willibaldsburg Castle, the escapees were sent to Oflag IV-C at Colditz Castle. In spring of 1943 American and British (C company) personnel captured in the Tunisia Campaign arrived. On 14 April 1945, as the U.S. Army approached, the officers were marched out of the camp. Unfortunately, only a short distance from the camp the column was attacked by American aircraft, who mistook it for a formation of German troops. Fourteen British officers were killed and 46 were wounded. In 2003 a memorial plaque was erected by local German authorities at the site. The camp was liberated by the U.S. Army on 16 April 1945. The POWs were repatriated to their home countries. For the British this meant a march begging for food from farmers until transport reached them. As of 2012 the site of the camp is occupied by the barracks and training school of II. Bereitschaftspolizeiabteilung (\\"2nd Riot Police Division\\") of the Bavarian State Police. English composer Benjamin Britten wrote a short piece for male voices The Ballad of Little Musgrave and Lady Barnard and dedicated it to \\"Richard Wood and the musicians of Oflag VIIb\\". The work was completed on December 13, 1943 and smuggled into the camp on microfilm for the prisoners to sing.

Detailed process  According to the Bureau of Reclamation, a branch of the US Department of Interior,USBR this process uses simple corrugated plastic tanks with many \\"DewVaporation columns\\" inserted in each tank.Figure 5. Top View of Tower Each column is made of corrugated plastic and is divided into two compartments. The wall in the middle serves for receiving and evaporating sea-water into a hot air stream, and on the other side for condensing freshwater. The cooling from the evaporation helps water condense on the dividing wall, while the energy from the condensing vapor, now turned to droplets, passes back to the evaporation side, and is absorbed in the evaporating sea water. This way, much of the energy (as heat) is left in the process, and is not removed with the air leaving the DewVaporation column. Various improvements have been proposed, among those reusing the output brine and adding external heat in a stacked way, so that the pressure and humidity gap between the two sides of the column are optimal and constant.

Described by drummer and video game composer Frank Klepacki as \\"just a good-time, funky dance band\\", the band has been compared to Tower of Power and featured a five-man horn section. Robins recalled, \\"We were together for a couple of years and wanted to do some serious recording. I was working at a pizza place, making nothing. Pretty soon I realized, where's the money going to come from? If I'm going to do anything seriously musically, I've got to get some money first - and some knowledge.\\" The band became active again around 1995 Around the mid 1990s, the band grew to include ten members, including a five-man horn section and drums played by video game music composer Frank Klepacki. The group released their debut album in 1997, named Mmm, Mmm, Mmm, and featuring fourteen tracks. Track nine, Soul Space Express, appeared on Road Rash: Jailbreak and the television series Cupid, while X-Rated Superstar was a number one hit and received regular airplay on Vegas's KXTE-FM Xtreme Disorder format. Playboy playmate Corinna Harney volunteered to appear on the album's cover. The success of this song sparked a racy music video, which was given airplay on MTV for a brief period. Home Cookin' songs were regularly included on Las Vegas scene compilation albums. Klepacki explained in an interview about their then-unreleased next album that Home Cookin' did not want to get signed, but rather \\"work with a label, not for them.\\" To this end, they created their own \\"Fly Records\\" release label. Despite setbacks in losing two band members, group followed up with a second album of thirteen songs in 2000—Pink in the Middle—and promoted their work online through local band websites. In March, Klepacki touted Home Cookin' as something for visitors \\"looking for something unique besides the casinos and ritzy stuff.\\" The band won \\"Best Band\\" at a competition in Malibu while X-Rated Remix appeared in the film An American Vampire Story. Home Cookin' was voted \\"Best Horns\\" by Las Vegas Weekly and their albums were voted \\"Best Local CD\\" certain years by Las Vegas audiophiles. Klepacki contended in 2000 that turnout for the band at clubs was usually above four hundred people. Towards the end of its run, the band played at Quark's Bar in Star Trek: The Experience and at the Boston Grill and Bar. Home Cookin' sometimes opened shows with a four member funk act named Junkfood in this period. The group then launched an extended tour of California, but disbanded late in the year after recording \\"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer\\" for a local Christmas album. Frank Klepacki continues to support the band's music by selling copies of the albums through his website.

The species was first described by Dru Drury in 1773. It is a common mid- through late-summer feeder on milkweeds and dogbane. Like most species in this family, it has chemical defenses it acquires from its host plants, in this case, cardiac glycosides (Weller et al., 1999). These are retained in adults and deter bats, and presumably other predators, from feeding on them (Hristov and Conner 2005). Only very high cardiac glycoside concentrations deterred bats, however (Hristov and Conner 2005). Adults indicate their unpalatability with clicks from their tymbal organs (Simmons and Conner 1996). Range It is found from southern Canada and south through Texas and Florida in North America (Wagner 2005). Life cycle There is one generation per year in the north and two or more in the south (Wagner 2005). =Egg= Females lay eggs in masses on the undersides of leaves. =Larva= Early instars appear slightly hairy and gray. They skeletonize whole leaves gregariously, leaving lacy leaf remnants. They are gregarious until their third instar. Later instars sport tufts of black, white and orange (sometimes yellow) setae (hairs). The head capsule is black. The later instars wander much more, and may appear alone or in groups of 2 to 10. Mature caterpillars occur from June onwards (Wagner 2005). Larvae grow as long as 35 mm.

Abdomens are hairy and yellow, each with a row of black dots on its dorsum. Males use their tymbal organs in calling females and in defense against bats (Simmons and Conner, 1996). Food plants This moth frequently uses milkweeds (Asclepias spp.) and sometimes dogbane (Apocynum spp.) as larval host plants. Larvae often feed on older milkweed shoots, and seldom share shoots with monarchs (Danaus plexippus), which prefer younger ones (Wagner, 2005). Dogbanes and milkweeds produce a sticky latex that can impede larval feeding. Early instars avoid the veins by skeletonizing the leaves. Older larvae sever the veins that supply the latex, which reduces latex flow to the area they feed on (Dussourd and Denno, 1991). References *Dussourd, D. E. & Denno, R. F.

It closed on 5 September 2018, laying off all its employees.  History  Kah-Nee-Ta Resort first started by a non-Indian doctor who owned land around the hot springs of the Warm Springs River. In 1961, the Tribes purchased the land back and started to rebuild the spa. The great flood of 1964 damaged the spa and bridge to the spa. In 1964–1965, the Tribes built an Olympic-sized swimming pool, cottages, restaurant, and tepees. The campground at Hot Springs Resort In 1971, the Tribes began construction of the Kah-Nee-Ta Lodge using funds from low- interest loans from the Economic Development Administration (EDA). Zimmer Gunsul Frasca Architects designed the lodge. Today it stands as an example of seventies architecture with strong Indian and Scandinavian influences. The gigantic fireplace in the lobby represents all of that: raw concrete, Indian symbols and Artichoke lamps by Poul Henningsen for Louis Poulsen. In 1995, the Tribes expanded operations to include a casino and improved convention center. In 2001, the resort and casino were combined to form Kah-Nee-Ta High Desert Resort & Casino, which also includes a golf course. The resort's casino closed in December 2011 in preparation for moving it to a new property, the Indian Head Casino, on U.S. Route 26, where it would be more accessible to passing travelers. While Kah-Nee-Ta's casino netted $2–4 million annually, the tribes expected the new location to earn $8–12 million. The resort shifted its focus to its family-friendly amenities, including the golf course and spa. The resort filed a WARN notice with the state on 7/6/2018, announcing that it plans to permanently lay off 146 employees starting Sept. 5, 2018. Along with the layoffs will come the closure of the resort, which includes a lodge, spa, hotel and RV park. In spite of efforts to maintain operations, the resort closed in September 2018.

Time period is from 0000 UTC 22 August 2005 to 0000 UTC 24 August 2005. The Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model is a numerical weather prediction (NWP) system designed to serve both atmospheric research and operational forecasting needs. NWP refers to the simulation and prediction of the atmosphere with a computer model, and WRF is a set of software for this. WRF features two dynamical (computational) cores (or solvers), a data assimilation system, and a software architecture allowing for parallel computation and system extensibility. The model serves a wide range of meteorological applications across scales ranging from meters to thousands of kilometers. The effort to develop WRF began in the latter part of the 1990s and was a collaborative partnership principally among the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (represented by the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) and the (then) Forecast Systems Laboratory (FSL)), the Air Force Weather Agency (AFWA), the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL), the University of Oklahoma (OU), and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). The bulk of the work on the model has been performed or supported by NCAR, NOAA, and AFWA. WRF allows researchers to produce simulations reflecting either real data (observations, analyses) or idealized atmospheric conditions. WRF provides operational forecasting a flexible and robust platform, while offering advances in physics, numerics, and data assimilation contributed by the many research community developers. WRF is currently in operational use at NCEP and other forecasting centers internationally. WRF has grown to have a large worldwide community of users (over 30,000 registered users in over 150 countries), and workshops and tutorials are held each year at NCAR. WRF is used extensively for research and real-time forecasting throughout the world. It has been shown to perform well in simulating Atmospheric convection, but to be prone to producing squall lines too easily. WRF offers two dynamical solvers for its computation of the atmospheric governing equations, and the variants of the model are known as WRF-ARW (Advanced Research WRF) and WRF-NMM (nonhydrostatic mesoscale model). The Advanced Research WRF (ARW) is supported to the community by the NCAR Mesoscale and Microscale Meteorology Laboratory. The WRF-NMM solver variant was based on the Eta model, and later nonhydrostatic mesoscale model, developed at NCEP. The WRF-NMM (NMM) is supported to the community by the Developmental Testbed Center (DTC). The WRF serves as the basis for the RAP and HRRR models: high-resolution operational forecast models run regularly at NCEP. A version of WRF-NMM tailored for hurricane forecasting, HWRF (hurricane weather research and forecasting), became operational in 2007. In 2009, a polar optimized WRF was released through the Byrd Polar Research Center at the Ohio State University.

Mike Z. Velarde. Its studios and transmitter are located at 8F Queensway Building, 118 Amorsolo St. Legaspi Village, Makati City. This station is currently having a test broadcast, but operates on weak signal only. By January 2017, it officially opened on the air, but it discontinue due to lack of facilities of its station's studios and transmitter. On April 30, 2019, Bro. Mike announced that this channel will soon to be operating on DTT via TVplus as the renewal of franchise of the network has already approved by the Philippine Congress. History Fourteen years after DWXI-AM 1314 was launched, El Shaddai leader Bro. Mike Z. Velarde launched a TV station that was put on VHF Channel 11 (from MBC, the original owners of the frequency allocation; latterly QTV / Q now GMA News TV co-owned by GMA Network a subsidiary of Citynet Network Marketing and Productions in 2005 until it went analog shut-off on Channel 11 on June 5, 2019 permanently). It shows religious TV Shows, including El Shaddai. In 1998, ZOE Broadcasting Network through its head Jesus is Lord leader Eddie Villanueva bought Channel 11 and DBS TV moved to Channel 35. Around 2004, it ceased broadcasting due to poor ratings & lack of funds. Despite this, El Shaddai appointments & events are still heard over DWXI-AM. On September 15, 2012, during the Weekly Family Appointment with El Shaddai at Amvel City, Bro. Mike announced to the audience and to its listeners and viewers that DBS granted its TV equipments for DBS TV's comeback as early as possible. On July 14, 2016, DBS TV-35 resumed its operations as a test broadcast. As of this moment, it only operates on weak signal and can be picked up by some Cavite, Laguna, Batangas and southern Metro Manila viewers by airing the previous Family Appointment with El Shaddai.

He was one of the members of Novos Baianos.http://www.dicionariompb.com.br/pepeu-gomes Pepeu Gomes – Dicionário Cravo Albin da Música Popular Brasileira Biography Pepeu Gomes was born February 7, 1952 and had contact with music from an early age because his father played in a dance orchestra and his mother taught piano lessons. Growing up he was influenced by the music of Waldir Azevedo, Jacob do Bandolim, Pixinguinha, and Canhoto da Paraíba. At nine years of age he invented his first instrument, a broom with a cable (that was usually used for street fighting)Entrevista de Pepeu Gomes cedida ao programa SESC Instrumental 2010 with the string tied at the ends. Later, he obtained a classical guitar and he learned to play by ear. At 11 years old, Gomes, interested in the style of Jovem Guarda, formed his first band, \\"Los Gatos\\" (\\"The Cats\\"), in which he played the upright bass. He formed his first professional band at 17 years old named \\"Os Minos\\". The group disbanded due to the difficulty of having members that were all minors in age. Gomes became a member of the band, Leif's, where he played guitar and appeared on local television programs. While playing in Leif's, Gilberto Gil assisted in the television appearances and invited Gomes to partake in the concert marking his exile from Brazil which was also held with Caetano Veloso in Salavador (Gil and Veloso would seek political refuge in London). Before leaving, Gil gave Gomes the album Smash Hits by Jimi Hendrix who Gomes had not yet heard of. Hendrix would be the most influential artist on Gomes over the course of his career.Guitar Player Brasil – nº 176 In the 1970s Gomes formed the band Novos Baianos with Moraes Moreira, Paulinho Boca de Cantor, Luiz Galvão, and Baby Consuelo where he played guitar, wrote and arranged songs with Moreira. After recording the first album of Novos Baianos, Gomes deeply studied the rhythms of many kinds of Brazilian music including samba, frevo, choro, and maracatu; he also learned to play bandolim.Guitar Player Brasil – nº 115 In 1971 alongside his work in the Novos Baianos, Gomes substituted for Lanny Gordin on the \\"Fa-Tal\\" tour by Gal Costa, which resulted in the release of a double album of the same name where Gomes plays on most of the tracks.Revista Bizz – Novembro de 2006 Gomes began his solo career in 1978 recording his first solo album Geração do Som. During this phase, he played with Gilberto Gil in the Montreux Jazz Festival in Switzerland which also recorded on the album Gil ao Vivo em Montreux. In 1979, Gomez released his second album, Na Terra a Mais de Mil, marking his debut as a singer. The album sold many copies and contained the hit, \\"Meu Coração\\". In 1980, he followed his praised performance from 1978 and returned to the Montreux Jazz Festival for an individual performance. This performance was recorded and released as an album under the name, Pepeu Gomes Ao Vivo. In the same year he released the song \\"O Mal é o Que Sai Pela Boca do Homem\\" which also featured Baby Consuelo and Galvão. This song generated substantial controversy due to the verse \\"Você pode fumar baseado\\". Gomes released his album titled, Pepeu Gomes, in 1981 which earned him his first gold album, and praise for his execution of the track, \\"Eu também quero beijar\\". He followed this album with Um Raio Laser in 1982. He began recording in the United States with his 1982 album Masculino e Feminino. Recording in the U.S. introduced him to the composer Ronnie Foster and musicians such as Paulinho da Costa, Jerry Hey, Garry Grant, Airto Moreira, and John Robinson. In 1985, Gomes released the album Energia Positiva and was invited to participate in Rock in Rio. Even though he was met with a hostile reception from Brazilian artists, Gomes was applauded and succeeded in winning them over. Gomes considers Rock in Rio to be one of the best moments of his career and after the show was greeted by John Sykes, the guitarist of Whitesnake. In the late 1980s, he returned to instrumental music dedicating himself to his guitar playing, covering old hits such as Os Chorinhos \\"Brasileirinho\\" (Waldir Azevedo) and \\"Noites Cariocas\\" (Jacob do Bandolim), artists who were present in the beginning of his career that helped make him famous as a virtuoso. He also participated in jazz festivals throughout the world and releasing the album Instrumental on the Road in 1989, with the Third World Talent Agency in New York. Gomes was invited to become a member of the heavy metal band Megadeth and later towards the end of the 1990s to become a member of Living Color. He refused both invitations for personal reasons.Pepeu Gomes comenta convite para o Megadeth Gomes later admitted in an interview hosted by MTV in 2011 that he turned down the invitation because he would be a hired musician and that he would only leave Brazil to be a member of a permanent band and not as an employee.Pepeu Gomes admite porque negou os convites In the 1990s he re-encountered his old partner Moraes Moreira and they released two albums, Moraes e Pepeu and Moraes e Pepeu ao vivo no Japão, and while on tour were the closing act of Rock in Rio II. In 1993 Gomes released a new album which obtained a deal of success, driven by the song \\"Sexy Yemanjá\\" which was the sound track of the soap opera \\"Mulheres de Areia\\" on TV Globo. During the 1990s he continued to tour, playing for the first time in the Montreux Festival and played many shows with the guitarist Armandinho. In 1998 Gomes released a compilation of all the instrumental music of his career called, 20 anos: Discografia Instrumental, and in the following year released a CD of acoustic cover of his greatest hits, titled, Meu coração. This album was produced with the guitarist Robertinho de Recife and included two unpublished tracks: \\"O que é que você quer comigo?\\" and \\"Dono de mim\\". In 2004 to commemorate the 25th anniversary of his solo career he released a CD and DVD called De espírito em paz – Ao Vivo. In 2011, Gomes re-released a part of his remastered discography in the CD \\"On the Road\\" receiving song extra tracks and approved the release of an unpublished album titled, Eu Não Procuro o Som, recorded live in 1979. Currently, Gomes, is preparing to release one more album.

Broken stairs. First floor window. Exposed side of Ballycarbery Castle. Ballycarbery Castle is a castle from Cahersiveen, County Kerry, Ireland. The castle is high on a grass hill facing the sea and is a short distance from Cahergall Fort and Leacanabuile Fort. History There was some kind of residence situated on the site of the castle as early as 1398 however the present ruins were constructed in the 16th century. It was noted as a McCarthy Mor castle by some sources at that time but whether it was occupied by the McCarthy Mors or their wardens the O'Connells is unknown. The castle was passed onto Sir Valentine Browne following the death of its owner Donal McCarthy More. In 1652 it was attacked by cannon fire from Parliament forces during the War of the Three Kingdoms. In the 18th century a house was built on the site using the barn wall and it was inhabited by the Lauder family. This house was demolished in the early 20th century. Structure The castle was surrounded by a high wall with less than half still remaining. There are arrow slits dotted along the bottom of the remaining wall. A staircase remains inside one part of the wall, but is not easily accessible. The ground floor of the castle was made up of several chambers but only one chamber is still roofed and walled. It is a large chamber with a quite high roof and in one corner a staircase leading upstairs. There are two different staircases leading to the first floor and there is also a path up the back of the castle since the whole back wall is missing. One of the staircases is up on a height inside the ground floor chamber and is in very good condition. The other is entered from outside the chamber and is slightly damaged. The first floor is covered in grass and has some windows and a few small rooms but is mostly in the open. The first floor is the highest accessible part of the castle as the steps to the second floor must have been attached to the now missing back wall. Until sometime in 2017, it was possible to walk around the castle grounds and climb on the castle ruins. However, the castle is situated on private land, and the owner of the land has recently eliminated public access to the castle. Consequently, visitors can now only admire the beautiful structure from the small parking lot located about 200 meters from the front of the castle.

The skyline of Charlotte, North Carolina, is barely visible on the horizon looking over the right side of Crowders Mountain. The Pinnacle, is one of the two main peaks located within Crowders Mountain State Park. The other peak is Crowders Mountain. The park is located in the western Piedmont of North Carolina between the cities of Kings Mountain and Gastonia. Geology The monadnock is the remnant of a quartzite ridge which formed approximately 400–500 million years ago. The softer material that once covered and surrounded the monadnock has been gradually worn down to its present height of 1,705 feet (520 meters) above sea level. The monadnock abruptly rises some 800 feet above the surrounding countryside. The Pinnacle is part of the Kings Mountain Belt, a string of monadnocks and rock types along the piedmont in the Carolinas, many of which can be seen from the summit. History The Pinnacle and nearby Crowders Mountain separated the historic hunting lands of the Cherokee and Catawba Indians.

History  Created in 2002, by Danny Ferrer of Lakeland, Florida. He sold unlicensed software online and gave out false codes to make an enormous profit. The laser printed software looked legitimate to consumers, but was deeply discounted, said John Wolfe of Business Software Alliance, an industry group.  Trouble for the site  Ferrer purchased for himself numerous airplanes, a fighter-jet simulator, as well as starting an entire flight school of his own: Ferrer Aviation. He also purchased for personal use a Lamborghini, a Hummer, a Mercedes and other luxury vehicles with his profits.BuysUSA.com operator pleads guilty to piracy  InfoWorld  News  2006-06-16  By Grant Gross, IDG News Service The Federal Bureau of Investigation investigated the site and was ultimately responsible for shutting down the site permanently in October 2005.  Verdict  On Friday, August 25, 2006, Danny Ferrer appeared before U.S. District Court Judge T.T. Ellis III in Alexandria, Virginia. He was told, \\"You extended your hand into the pockets of these people,\\" and that, \\"If severe penalties were not attached, people would line up from here to Los Angeles to do what you've done.\\" Danny Ferrer claimed to the judge that he started selling the software to pay for a feeding tube for his sick wife, but, \\"there was probably a certain amount of greed.\\" He was soon convicted of conspiracy and copyright infringement, sentenced to six years in prison, and ordered to pay more than $4.1 million in restitution to the damaged companies. He was taken into custody at Coleman Federal Correctional Facility in Florida in December 2006. Prosecutors said the illegal sales cost the software companies as much as $20 million, but industry representatives said the amount could be higher. \\"This is the ultimate case,\\" prosecutor Jay V. Prabhu said in court. \\"This is a case where someone made a lot of money.\\" Danny Ferrer was given a reduced sentence for his cooperation with the FBI. He agreed not only to give testimony against other illegal distributors of software but to help find them as well. He also filmed a video in conjunction with the Business Software Alliance to alert consumers as to the dangers of purchasing unlicensed software and to deter others from attempting to copy software for profit.

In the utility industry, the FPSC regulates investor-owned electric, natural gas, water, and wastewater utilities. In the telecommunications industry, the FPSC facilitates competitive markets, has authority over intercarrier disputes, and oversees pay telephones, the federal Lifeline Assistance Program and Telecommunications Relay Service. The FPSC members are appointed by the Governor of Florida and confirmed by the Florida Senate. Commissioners serve four-year terms. One commissioner is chair, elected by the commissioners for a two-year term. The commissioners are Chairman Gary F. Clark, Julie I. Brown, Art Graham, Donald Polmann, and Andrew Giles Fay.  History  Created by the Florida Legislature in 1887, the FPSC was originally called the Florida Railroad Commission and primarily regulated railroad passenger and freight rates and operations. As Florida grew, the Commission's purpose expanded. *1887- Florida Railroad Commission was established, Chapter 3746 *1891- Repeal of Chapter 4068, abolishing the Florida Railroad Commission *1897- Enactment of Chapter 4700, re-establishing the Florida Railroad Commission *1899- First decision issued.

The Governor appoints the commissioners, who are then confirmed by the Florida Senate. Commissioners serve four year terms. Prior to 1979, three Commissioners were elected in a statewide election. The 1978 Legislature changed the FPSC to a five-member appointed board. The chair is the chief administrative officer of the FPSC , presiding at all hearings and conferences when present, setting FPSC hearings, and performing those duties prescribed by law. The chairis elected by the FPSC .  FPSC Commissioners  Gary F. Clark was reappointed to the FPSC by Governor Rick Scott for a term ending on January 1, 2023. He was first appointed in 2017. Clark was elected chair from January 2020 through January 2022. Julie Imanuel Brown was reappointed to the FPSC by Scott for a four-year term January 2, 2015 to January 1, 2019. Elected as chair effective January 2, 2016, she was to serve until January 2018. Brown was first appointed by Governor Charlie Crist. Art Graham was appointed by Crist in July 2010. He was twice reappointed by Scott, most recently for a term through January 2022. He was elected Chair from January 2018 through January 2020. Graham has served two previous terms as Chair. Donald J. Polmann was appointed by Scott for a term beginning January 2, 2017. Andrew Giles Fay was appointed by Scott for a term ending on January 1, 2022. .  Jurisdiction  The Florida Legislature established the powers and responsibilities of the FPSC as a regulator of public utilities under its jurisdiction. This includes electric, natural gas, telephone, water, and wastewater. the FPSC exercises the following regulator authority: * Rate base/economic regulation - analyzing requested rate changes and conducting earnings surveillance to ensure that regulated utilities are not exceeding their authorized rates of return. * Competitive market oversight - facilitating the development of competitive markets and issues associated with them. * Safety, reliability, and service -monitoring - promoting an uninterrupted supply of utility services to the general public, and confirms that such services are provided in a reasonable and timely manner with minimal risks. In 2014, the FPSC regulated five investor-owned electric companies, seven investor-owned natural gas utilities, and 149 investor-owned water and/or wastewater utilities. The FPSCU also had competitive market oversight for 361 telecommunications companies in Florida. The FPSC does not regulate the rates and service quality of publicly owned municipal or cooperative electric utilities; however, the FPSC does have jurisdiction regarding rate structure, territorial boundaries, bulk power supply operations, and power supply planning over 35 municipally owned electric systems and 18 rural electric cooperatives. The FPSC has jurisdiction regarding territorial boundaries and safety, over 27 municipally owned natural gas utilities and 4 gas districts. In addition, the Commission exercises safety authority over all electric and natural gas systems operating in the state.  Consumer Information  The FPSC participates in consumer forums, community meetings, and customer meetings and hearings and consumer publications. The FPSC participates in consumer programs and distributes conservation-related materials through partnerships with governmental entities, and consumer groups. Each year, the FPSC provides educational brochures to Florida public libraries for consumer distribution. The Commission has recently increased its Library Outreach Campaign participants to educate consumers across the state. Through the program, a variety of FPSC publications highlighting practical energy and water conservation measures are distributed to library patrons throughout the year. Events to promote energy efficiency and conservation education are annually observed during October's Energy Action Month, sponsored annually by the U.S. Department of Energy. National Consumer Protection Week observed each year in March, highlights consumer protection and education efforts around the country, and is important to the FPSC's conservation education efforts. =Lifeline assistance= The Florida Lifeline program is part of the federal Universal Service Program (USP) designed to enable low-income households to obtain and maintain basic local telephone service. The Lifeline program offers qualifying households a minimum $9.25 discount on their monthly phone bills, or a free Lifeline cell phone and monthly minutes from certain wireless providers. Eighty-eight local, state, and federal agencies, organizations, and businesses, and 22 telecommunications companies were involved in the collaborative effort to increase awareness and participation in the Lifeline program in 2014. Promotional activities in 2014 featured National Lifeline Awareness Week, National Consumer Protection Week, Older American's Month and ongoing \\"grass roots\\" efforts to increase awareness and enrollment in the programs. Each month, the FPSC sends a cover letter and informational packet to two organizations to encourage continued Lifeline outreach to their eligible clientele. In addition, the FPSC attends as least two community events each month to promote Lifeline. As of June 2014, 957,792 eligible customers participated in the Florida Lifeline program. The six companies with the highest Lifeline enrollment in Florida were SafeLink Wireless, Assurance Wireless, i-wireless, AT&T;, CenturyLink, and Verizon with 98.7 percent of the Florida Lifeline customers. =Florida Relay Service= The FPSC oversees the administration of a statewide telecommunications access system to provide access to Telecommunications Relay Services by persons who are deaf, hard of hearing or speech impaired, or others who communicate with them. In early 2014, AT&T; notified the FPSC that it was opting out of its contract options, so the FPSC issued a Request for Proposals for a new Relay Service Provider. Based on a competitive bid evaluation process, the Commission awarded a three-year contract with Sprint Communications Company, L.P. (Sprint) to provide telecommunications relay service to the nearly three million hard-of-hearing, deaf, deaf/blind, and speech impaired Floridians. Service begins June 1, 2015. Of the two companies bidding, Sprint received the highest technical rating and offered the lowest overall per-minute cost for service. Sprint was the only bidder proposing to hire an in-state Customer Relations Manager. Sprint also proposed to designate a Florida Relay Quality Manager.

The only city that he assigns to them is Aufidena. Zonaras describes them as possessing a town or stronghold, which was taken by the Roman consuls Q. Gallus and C. Fabius with difficulty. Aufidena has been identified with the modern Castel di Sangro, which seems, from the inscriptions and other remains discovered there, to have been an ancient town. Their territory was delimited to the north and east from that of the Frentani, to the south from that of the Pentri, and to the west from that of the Peligni. The tribe divided itself in two groups: the \\"Caricini supernates\\" (Carricini supernates), which occupied the northern part of their eastern region centered on the city of Juvanum (whose remains are visible in the territory between the communes of Torricella Peligna and Montenerodomo) and the \\"Caricini infernates\\" (Carricini infernates), in the southern part, whose main center was Cluviae (whose ruins have been identified with those at Piano Laroma, a frazione of the commune of Casoli). This small community comprised part of the Samnite Confederation, the great antagonist of the Roman Republic, against which it participated in the Samnite Wars and the Social War. The territory of the Caraceni probably came to be occupied by the Romans in the course of the Second Samnite War (c. 310 BC), and the people were gradually assimilated into the Roman state. Pliny (iii. 12. s. 17), describes a tribe called Carentini which that author seems to place among the Frentani, with the Caraceni, but distinct from them.

The company was once well-known for its still and movie cameras, although it no longer manufactures such products. Meopta optika sro is a Czech Republic based company that manufactures various products mainly in the field of optics. The company was started in 1933 under name Optikotechna in Přerov with the intention of producing a limited range of lenses and condensers, however the production rapidly expanded to include enlargers, composite lenses, binoculars, rifle scopes, cameras and slide projectors. Meopta U.S.A., Inc. is a separate American company that manufactures and assembles optical and optomechanical systems for the Consumer, Industrial and Military Markets. History The company emerged as a fusion of two nationalized producers of optical devices: C. P. Göerz Bratislava and Optikotechna Přerov. In 1907 Vienna based company C. P. Göerz established its subsidiary in Bratislava for production of optical and mechanical devices. The company first produced military optical products used primarily by the artillery and partially by the navy of the Austria-Hungary military. After the World War I the production plan was shifted towards more civilian products such as movie cameras, binoculars, magnifying glasses, compasses, and field-glasses and also some other mechanical devices such as manometers, alarm clocks, speakers, refractometers. The company was renamed to Meopta in 1958. Meopta was nationalized in 1968. Optikotechna company was founded in 1933 in Přerov, Czechoslovakia. Originally established with the intention of producing a limited range of lenses and condensers, the company rapidly expanded the range of products to include enlargers, composite lenses, binoculars, riflescopes, cameras and slide projectors. Optikotechna enjoyed a thriving consumer goods business until the company was seized by German forces in 1939. Optikotechna was then forced to immediately cease consumer goods production in order to supply military optical equipment for the German army. From 1939 until the end of the war, the company produced nothing other than military optical equipment that included rangefinders, periscopes, binoculars and riflescopes. After 1935, Meopta optika became a subsidiary of Zbrojovka Brno and a major supplier of military optics for the Czechoslovak Army. Company retained its focus on military production when it was seized by Germans during the occupation of Czechoslovakia as well as after WW2, when it was nationalized and renamed as Meopta – an acronym for Mechanická optická výroba - mechanical optical manufacturing. Apart from military deliveries, the company became one of the world's major manufacturers of cinema projectors between 1947 and 1970. The abrupt halt of military demand after the dissolution of Warsaw pact forced the company to refocus mainly on civilian applications. Today, military production constitutes about 10% of company's production, with 20% of its turnover being generated mainly by optics for sports and hunting applications and 70% being generated by production of optics for cinema and other projectors, optical tools for microprocessors manufacturing quality control, as well as optics for healthcare which are used in various applications such as RTG or mammography. The company was privatized in 1992. Its majority owners are a Czech family that emigrated to the United States in 1946 amidst the rising power of communists in the Soviet Union liberated and dominated Czechoslovakia. During WW2 the three brothers had been - together with both their parents - active soldiers of the 1st Czechoslovak Army Corps and were decorated for their war duty. Meopta U.S.A., Inc. is a separate company that was founded by the same Czech-American family in New York in 1960 under the name Tyrolit Company, Inc. At that time, its main business was selling grinding wheels in US and Canada. Tyrolit gradually changed its focus to manufacturing various optical products and in 2005 was renamed to Meopta U.S.A., Inc.

Founded by Todd Greene, a 1989 graduate of Bowdoin College, HeadBlade is headquartered in Gardena, California.  Products  HeadBlade’s first commercial product was the HeadBlade Classic, introduced in 1999. The unorthodox design of the Classic was made as a response to the difficulties of head shaving with a regular razor. The HeadBlade Classic went on to win the IDSA Silver Award for Design Excellence, as well as a spot in Time Magazine’s “Ten Best Designs of 2000.” In 2005, the Classic was also added to the Permanent Collection at the Museum of Modern Art. As the company began to grow, HeadBlade expanded into a variety of hair care products, including HeadSlick, a specially designed shaving cream, HeadShed Scrub, an exfoliating solution and HeadLube, a scalp moisturizing lotion. Greene also continued improving on the design of his original product. The HeadBlade MOTO In 2006, seven years after first introducing the Classic, HeadBlade released the HeadBlade Sport. The Sport kept the same general shape and function as the classic, but added an improved rubber grip to the finger ring and upper pad. Inspired by sport car design, it also added hardened rubber wheels and an improved axel to increase the mobility of the razor. In 2012, HeadBlade came out with the HeadBlade ATX. With a design inspired by an all terrain vehicle, the ATX changed the position of the blade to the back of the razor, encouraging action by “pulling” the blade along the head rather than “pushing” it. This was done in order to reduce the learning curve for people who were accustomed to regular razors. The latest HeadBlade model is the HeadBlade MOTO, which was released in late 2016. The MOTO was awarded a Red Dot Design Award in 2017 for its industrial design and its ease of use. GQ magazine named Todd Greene to the 2010 Bald 100.

He was the author of more than three dozen books on New England history and folklore, as well as on scuba diving, shipwrecks and pirates. Politics Cahill served in the Massachusetts House of Representatives from 1970 to 1975. In 1974, Cahill was elected Sheriff of Essex County, Massachusetts. During his tenure as Sheriff, Cahill sought to modernize the department. The jails in Salem and Lawrence lacked toilets, which meant inmates had to defecate in buckets. There were also no rehabilitation programs in either jail and guards had no formal training. The minimum-security Correctional Alternative Center in Lawrence opened during Cahill's tenure. While serving as Sheriff, Cahill investigated an alleged curse Giles Corey placed on the office. He found that all Essex County Sheriffs as far back as he could trace either died in office of heart problems or retired due to \\"an ailment of the blood\\". In 1978, Cahill, who suffered from a rare blood disorder himself, retired after he suffered a heart attack and stroke. Writing Several of Cahill's books center on the infamous Salem Witch Trials and related topics, such as accounts of the Salem \\"Witch Dungeon\\" and colonial era crime and punishment. Cahill was born and raised in Salem, Massachusetts and also wrote several auto-biographical books, one recounting his experiences as Sheriff, and another relating tales of his childhood growing up in New England during World War II. Cahill's most widely distributed lore and histories are mostly in the form of small books that can still be found in large quantities within souvenir shops located at tourist attractions throughout New England. =Published books= New England Collectible Classics (Chandler-Smith Publishing) *New England Witches and Wizards *New England's Ghostly Haunts *New England's Mad and Mysterious Men *New England's Strange Sea Sagas *Finding New England's Shipwrecks and Treasures *New England's War Wonders *New England's Visitors from Outer Space *The Horrors of Salem's Witch Dungeon (The Lauren Robinson Story)\\" *The Old Irish of New England *New England's Naughty Navy *New England's Viking and Indian Wars *New England's Riotous Revolution *New England's Pirates and Lost Treasure *New England's Mountain Madness Old Salt Box Publishing House * Things That Go Bump in the Night * Strange Superstitions * New England's Ancient Mysteries * Haunted Ships of the North Atlantic * Sugar and Spice * Haunted Happenings * Amazing Fish Stories * Strange Beliefs, Customs & Superstitions * Christmas Memories * Cruel and Unusual Punishments * Curious Customs and Cures * Lighthouse Mysteries of the North Atlantic * Diary of the Depths (Dorrance & Company) * The Wayward Sheriffs of Witch County (Old Pine Tree Publishing House) * The Balloon Tree: A Memoir of American Kids Growing Up During WWII (Old Pine Tree Publishing House) =Poems= * Col.

She was known as \\"Mother of Women's Swimming in America\\". Career Epstein was born in 1884 in New York City to Morris and Sara (Rosenau) Epstein. In 1917, she worked as a stenographer until she founded the Women's Swimming Association (WSA) with the help of a few other friends. The WSA became famous for promoting the health benefits of swimming as exercise. This was at a time when women were not viewed as athletic, and exercise was not considered beneficial to female health. Prior to this, Epstein started the National Women's Life Saving League to help create a swimming culture for women and girls. Epstein coached the Women's Olympic Swimming Team in the 1920s. She was able to guide many of the WSA members to victory. Through her coaching, swimmers under her management, known as \\"Eppie's Swimmers,\\" won 30 national championships, while setting 52 world records. She battled for women’s suffrage, staging “suffrage swim races” with her teammates, as well as battling for emancipation in women’s sports campaigning for bathing suit reform, distance swims, and other competitive events. Epstein served as the team leader for Olympian Gertrude Ederle, who learned to swim at the Women’s Swimming Association. In 1926 Ederle became the first woman to swim the English Channel beating the men’s time by over two hours. Epstein served as manager of the U.S. Women's Olympic Swimming Team for the 1920, 1924, and 1928 Olympic Games, and became well known as a spokesperson for female athletes. She boycotted 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin to protest Nazi policies. She died shortly after, in 1938.

After not being drafted, he was signed as a free agent by the Kansas City Chiefs in 1994. At Kansas City, Harris injured his knee in the first week of training camp and was out of football. Bernardo Harris became a free agent and was signed by the Green Bay Packers in 1995, playing in eleven games his rookie season. Harris played for the Green Bay Packers for seven seasons and played on the 1996 Super Bowl XXXI and 1997 Super Bowl XXXII teams. In 2002, Harris was signed as a free agent by the Baltimore Ravens, after a shoulder injury to Ray Lewis. In 2003, Bernardo Harris was placed on the injured reserved and subsequently retired. Significant contributions to the NFL While Bernardo Harris was playing for the Green Bay Packers in the January 3, 1999 playoff game against the San Francisco 49ers, Harris caused a controversial fumble which would largely be recognized as the precursor to video replay in the NFL. Towards the end of the 1999 playoff game, a pass was caught by Hall of Fame wide-receiver Jerry Rice, following the catch, Bernardo Harris stripped Jerry Rice of the ball, and was recovered by the Green Bay Packers. The game appeared to be won by the Green Bay Packers. However, the call on the field was that Rice was down by contact and San Francisco retained possession. Video replay showed that Rice has fumbled the ball, however, at that time replay was not used in the NFL. The 49ers went on to defeat the Green Bay Packers on that drive, by a final score of 30-27. Due to the controversial Harris call, the NFL announced the following season that it would begin instituting video replay.

Different animals will use growling in specific contexts as a form of communication. In humans, low or dull rumbling noises may also be emitted when they are discontent with something or they are angry, although this human sound is often termed \\"groaning\\". Animals that growl include felines, bears, canines, and crocodilians. The animals most commonly known for growling are canines and felines. Grrr is an onomatopoeic word which imitates the growling sound of predatory animals, often used with other related meanings. It is one of the rare pronounceable words of the English language that consists solely of consonants. Its most simple use is by children imitating animals. An example would be: \\"Mom!, Dad!, Look at me! I'm a polar bear! Grrr!\\" This word is also widely used in various titles to express growling when written.  Growling anatomy  The growl is emitted from the larynx, also known as the voice box, which is located at the top of the throat. It is made up of both cartilage and soft tissue, with an opening in the center to allow the passage of air. Similar to how humans learn to speak, animals learn to growl through the vibration of their vocal cords that occurs when air enters the larynx and passes over them. Animals such as dogs tend to have a lower frequency when growling in proportion to the length of their neck, a longer neck will cause a lower frequency. Growling usually first appears in dogs when puppies are about 24 days of age during play fights, emitting a pitch of up to 450 Hz with great variation in consistency. By 9 weeks old, puppies produce a growl of around 300 Hz, with no variation in consistency. This is the final development of the dogs' growl, which will remain consistent through its life, although may vary in pitch between individuals. In other animals, growling can occur for various reasons. Most common is fear, aggression, territoriality or, like in alligators, mating.  Growling in canines  Dogs are one of the most common animals known to growl. Dogs growl as a form of communication, most often when they are displaying signs of aggression. Dogs can also growl when they are playing with other canines/humans, growling over their possessions, when they are in pain, or during territorial displays. Human interpretation of dogs and other canines growling is often context-dependent. If the growl is isolated as an audio clip, generally humans are unable to determine if the growl is playful, angry, or otherwise. When the growl is elicited directly from the dog, humans are often able to use other physical cues, as well as the length and volume/tone of the growl, to interpret its meaning. Humans who are more frequently in the presence of canines are more accurately able to interpret the meaning of growls. Since dogs are able to distinguish between the different types of growling such as those that display food possession versus growls that are used during play, their behavior changes in response to another dog's growl. During playful interactions, dogs produce a growl which allows them to project their body size to be bigger than it actually is in order to help stimulate their playful behavior and the one they are playing with. This is in contrast to when they produce a growl that accurately projects their body size when guarding food, which is necessary because it will be more dangerous if their opponent thinks they are bigger, as this may result in more injury. Growling in dogs is generally seen as unfavorable; there are various methods to deal with this behaviour including therapy, training and temperament testing. The therapy approach to fear-based or aggressive growling in dogs seems to work the best, having a strong emphasis on owner-dog communication and understanding, as well as a strong reward system. Food-related aggression in dogs also elicits a growling response, and often occurs in many shelter dogs. This behaviour can have an adverse effect on their adoption rates, even though there is a high probability the food-related aggression will stop in the adopted home. Proper understanding of dog growling behaviours increases the likelihood of adoption in dogs with growling problems that are housed in shelters.  Function of aggressive growling  Food protection in canines tends to elicit a longer growl than average, and can be directed at humans, other canines, or other animals. Some fish, such as gurnards elicit a growling noise when attempting to grab prey fish, and have been shown to have a higher success rate at obtaining prey than non-growling fish. Growling in gurnards gives an advantage when there is limited food resources. This growl lasts up to 3 seconds and consists of up to 3 sound pulses, and is the only vocalization produced by this fish and is one of their two main feeding strategies. With growling being used in aggressive behaviours in dog species, it can be used as a predictor as to whether or not an individual will engage in further aggressive behaviour. Different body sizes in domestic dogs can produce different formants, which they can use to display their size and predict the size of others. Larger dogs are able to produce formants that appear to be much lower than smaller dogs, which in contrast produce higher formants. With this information, dogs are able to judge their opponent's size relative to their own and decide on what type of action they wish to proceed with during the encounter. Larger dogs are more likely to engage in more aggressive behaviour when their conspecific is smaller than them but less likely to interact with their conspecific if it is larger than them. This pattern of behaviour also applies to smaller dogs, which are less likely to interact with any other conspecific in any way larger than them (likely due to their distinct disadvantage of body size). In bears, almost all vocalizations can be wrongly classified as a growl. Unlike cats and dogs, bears seldom truly growl; instead the fear-moans of a trapped or treed bear are often mistaken as a threatening growl. When bears are being intentionally aggressive, as in when hunting or when threatened, they will tend to remain silent or make short blowing noises. Felines such as leopards and tigers also growl to signal territorial aggression, eliciting anti-predator responses from animals such as elephants. Similar to human interpretation of growling, elephants are able to distinguish the threat level based on the individual growl and will respond accordingly; elephants will retreat from tigers, but defend against leopards. Domestic house cats also growl, sounding like \\"brrrrrooowwww\\", usually followed by the typical hissing sound. In domestic cats, growling is a warning noise, implying unhappiness, annoyance, fear or other forms of aggression, and is a signal to back off. Cats may growl, similar to dogs, in the presence of other cats or dogs to establish dominance or to indicate they do not wish to interact with that individual. Functions of non-aggressive growling Growling may also function as a type of escape from predation as well as a warning signal to other conspecifics of close-by predators. The LongSnout Seahorse (Hippocampus reid) uses a form of growling when under stress in the presence of a predator. They use their low-frequency growl to warn conspecifics of the predator currently attacking it, only showing this type of growl when it is being handled. Due to the low frequency this sound produces, it only works to warn others if they are near by. This type of behaviour still works in its favor as the growl is also accompanied by body vibrations that the seahorse produces, which is likely to deter the predator when it is handling the seahorse. In Alligators (Alligator mississippiensis), a growl may be produced by females as a response to a \\"Headslap\\" display from males. The \\"Headslap\\" often involves antagonistic interactions between males and those that do not participate in antagonistic interactions will often lunge toward a female. In response to both the lunge and \\"Headslap\\", the female will produce the growl in order to project her sex and location. The growl serves as a signal to the male that his display has been recognized and so the female produces the growl in order for the make to know her location for mating.

His death notice (Irish Independent, 29 November 1934) gives his name as John O'Mahoney (p. 1), but as Seán O'Mahony in an article on p. 10. The death notice on the following day refers to Seán O'Mahony, while the more extensive funeral report (1 December), again, as Seán O'Mahony. (20 October 1872 – 28 November 1934) was an Irish Sinn Féin politician and member of the First and Second Dáil. He was born as John Mahony in Logan Street, Thomastown, County Kilkenny, to James Mahony, a tailor, and Mary Cantwell. A successful businessman he was a tea merchant and a commercial traveller. His company, John O'Mahoney & Co., was located on Middle Abbey St., and was destroyed during the 1916 Easter Rising. It subsequently reestablished on Parnell Square. He subsequently purchased and ran Fleming's Hotel which was located at 31-32 Gardiner Place, Dublin. A close friend of Arthur Griffith, he became an organiser for Sinn Féin and was elected to Dublin Corporation for the party. He participated in the Easter Rising and was subsequently interned at Frongoch and Lincoln Jail. He remained with Sinn Féin after it was re-constituted as a republican party at the 1917 Ardfheis. He was arrested during the German Plot of 1917 and was jailed in Lincoln Gaol in England. While imprisoned he was elected as a Sinn Féin MP for Fermanagh South in the 1918 general election. He was released from prison in 1919 and attended the proceedings of the First Dáil. He was re-arrested at the Sinn Féin offices in November 1919 and was imprisoned for three months in England. He would be arrested several more times throughout the Anglo-Irish War and his hotel was used as a meeting place by Sinn Féin members throughout the time. He was elected in the 1921 general election to the Second Dáil for Fermanagh and Tyrone. As a result of the Government of Ireland Act 1920 this election was to provide the membership of two assemblies: the Southern Ireland House of Commons and the Northern Ireland House of Commons. The eight seat Fermanagh-Tyrone constituency was one of several in the Northern Ireland House of Commons. As members of Sinn Féin did not recognise either assembly he and the other five Sinn Féin TDs continued to attend the Dáil.The other five, Michael Collins, de Valera, Arthur Griffith, Seán Milroy and Eoin MacNeill were also elected for a constituency in the Southern Ireland House of Commons. During the debates on the Anglo-Irish Treaty he opposed ratification of the document and voted against ratification. He left the Dáil with Éamon de Valera and the other Anti-Treaty TDs. As the only member of the Second Dáil not elected to the Southern Ireland House of Commons, his status in the Third Dáil in 1922 was unclear. O'Mahony was not invited to attend the opening of the Provisional Parliament. De Valera was keen for him to attend since if he had been refused entry it would have demonstrated, in the minds of Anti-Treaty supporters, that the assembly was not an All-Ireland Dáil. In the end O'Mahony did not attend, but his case was taken up by Laurence Ginnell.Dáil Éireann - Volume 1 - 9 September 1922 O'Mahony remained an abstentionist MP to Stormont until the 1925 Northern Ireland general election, when he did not stand for re-election. He remained with Sinn Féin after the 1926 split, serving on the party's Ard Chomairle until his death. He died in 1934. His funeral was attended by representatives of Sinn Féin, the Irish Republican Army, Fianna Fáil, Fianna Éireann, Cumann na mBan, and Mná na Poblachta.Irish Independent, 1 December 1934, p. 10. He is buried in Glasnevin Cemetery. He was survived by his wife, and a son, Malachy, and a daughter, Máire. The Gaelic football club Seán O'Mahony's (Dundalk) is named after him.

History The first written mention of Slušovice is from 1261. It obtained town privileges in 1446. The population increased considerably after World War II, when a large number of workers moved into the town to work in the growing collective farm. With time, technological developments allowed for the manufacture of computers in the town's industrial complex. These computers were sold under the Slušovice brand, priced at 40,000 USD at the official exchange rate or 5,000 USD on the black market. As a result, the town became a showcase of Czechoslovakia's planned economy. With the fall of communism in the Eastern Bloc, much of the industry in the town fell into decline.

It was created in 1911 by Puget Sound Energy and operated for hydroelectric power until it ceased power production in 2004. In December 2009 PSE sold the reservoir to the Cascade Water Alliance, a municipal corporation whose members are five King County cities (Bellevue, Issaquah, Kirkland, Redmond, and Tukwila) and two water and sewer districts (Sammamish Plateau Water and Sewer District, and the Skyway Water and Sewer District). Cascade provides drinking water to more than 350,000 residents and more than 20,000 businesses. It plans to eventually use Lake Tapps as a municipal water supply source for customers of its members. Cascade has signed an agreement with the Lake Tapps homeowners that guarantees full recreational reservoir levels throughout the summer. It has also signed an agreement with the Muckleshoot Indian Tribe and the Puyallup Tribe of Indians to ensure instream flows for fish. Cascade worked with the four cities that surround the reservoir, Auburn, Bonney Lake, Buckley and Sumner, to ensure their future water needs will be met for about 50 years. Cascade is the operator of Lake Tapps. Key elements of these agreements were incorporated into state water rights issued to Cascade in 2010. Lake Tapps is about in surface area and has about of shoreline. The local terrain is such that the shape of the shoreline is very complex, with many inlets, peninsulas, and islands. Before the reservoir was created there were several smaller lakes, including one called Lake Tapps. The reservoir is held in place by a series of dikes. The reservoir is also known to hold many fish including carp, smallmouth bass, perch, and tiger musky. A diversion dam on the White River, near Buckley, routes water into a flume which empties into the east side of Lake Tapps. On the west side of the reservoir, water had originally been routed to the Dieringer Powerhouse to generate hydroelectricity, after which the water was returned to the White River, about downstream from the diversion dam. Although there is no longer power generation, the water is still diverted and returned to the river through the former hydropower infrastructure. The level of the reservoir is lowered from about October to April to allow important upkeep and maintenance to be done, as well as an occasional major capital project. The winter lowering of the reservoir levels also ensures the safety of dikes from wind, waves and storms. At the diversion structure on the White River the US Army Corps of Engineers is undertaking a project to replace the 100 plus year old barrier and 70 plus year old fish trap and haul facility. this project will allow the Corps to move endangered salmon and bull trout, as well as other species, above its Mud Mountain Dam facility. The project began in mid-2018 and is expected to be completed in 2023. Lake Tapps is often considered a city or census-designated place in its own right, although it shares a zip code (98391) with the Bonney Lake post office. However, the majority of the area surrounding the reservoir is in unincorporated Pierce County; the rest is part of the city of Bonney Lake. At the northern edge of Lake Tapps is Auburn.

On April 23, 2000, it was bought by Iglesia ni Cristo's for-profit affiliate, Eagle Broadcasting Corporation and was rebranded as Net 25 with a multimedia exhibit dubbed \\"Destination: PLANET 25\\", coinciding with EBC's 32nd Anniversary. In late April 2001, Net 25 was the only station airing live coverage of the Pro- Estrada Rally (also known as EDSA III) - the rally ended in a failed siege of the Malacañang Presidential Palace on May 1, 2001. Some DZEC programs such as Agila Reports, Liwanagin Natin, and Con Todos Recados, were the first to try the TeleRadyo concept, as Net 25 became known for blow-by-blow accounts of Philippine Events, such as the Elections and the State of the Nation Addresses.

It was located in what is now downtown Berkeley, on Shattuck Avenue between University Avenue and Center Street. The tract is today occupied by Shattuck Square and Berkeley Square. The name continued in use after 1911 although the station was no longer the main rail depot for Berkeley. History Berkeley Station began as the \\"Berkeley Terminus\\" of the Central Pacific Railroad's Berkeley Branch Railroad, established in 1876, two years before Berkeley was incorporated. In 1878, the railroad was extended northward several blocks, so the \\"terminus\\" was renamed Berkeley Station. In 1885, the Central Pacific's operation of the Berkeley Branch was turned over to its affiliate, the Southern Pacific. In 1911, the Berkeley line was electrified and became part of the East Bay Electric Lines. From 1876 to about 1892, Berkeley Station included a small wooden depot located close to Center and Shattuck. About 1892, the first depot was replaced by a slightly larger wood depot. In 1906, construction began on a much larger brick and stone depot designed by the SP's architect Daniel J. Patterson which opened in 1908. This new depot consisted of two main buildings linked by a small enclosed courtyard. The north building was used as a baggage facility while the south building included the ticket office and waiting room. The original design which included a fountain was scaled back somewhat due to the costs incurred by the railroad as a result of the San Francisco earthquake of 1906. Although it was never disclosed formally by the railroad, the local newspapers reported that the new depot was part of a larger plan to re-route all mainline passenger trains through downtown Berkeley while extending the Berkeley Branch tracks northward from Berkeley along or through the Berkeley Hills where they would re-join the existing mainline. This possibility was not welcomed by the community. In 1911, at the urging of the community backed up by a ruling by the California State Railroad Commission, the Southern Pacific replaced its small wooden depot at Delaware Street in West Berkeley which, although it lay along the existing mainline, was too small, and most mainline trains did not observe it as a scheduled stop. The new West Berkeley Station was constructed one block south of the Delaware depot at Third and University, and was as large as Berkeley Station. The Southern Pacific scheduled it as a regular stop for its mainline trains, and thus, Berkeley Station lost its primacy. It continued as a regular railroad depot, but was incorporated into the Southern Pacific's electric commuter system, the East Bay Electric Lines. When the opening of the rail line on the new San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge was imminent in the late 1930s, the Southern Pacific successfully petitioned the Railroad Commission to close and demolish the depot at Berkeley Station, arguing that since the downtown trains would no longer connect with the mainline at the 16th Street Station (the bridge line bypassed it), such a large station was unnecessary. The depot was demolished in August 1938, its function replaced by a small ticket office in a commercial building which rose in its place. In 1972, the name \\"Berkeley Station\\" was revived as the name of the BART stop in downtown Berkeley, but was changed to \\"Downtown Berkeley\\" in the 1990s. The Amtrak stop adjacent to the old West Berkeley depot at Third and University is currently called \\"Berkeley Station\\". The depot itself survives, but is currently vacant. From the early 1970s through the early 2000s, the China Station Restaurant had used the depot, having converted it in 1974 after the Southern Pacific discontinued its railroad use. From the mid 1990s to 2007, the depot was used by Xanadu Restaurant. In 2008, Brennan's Restaurant moved into the depot.

He was the son and primary aide to Siddiq Abubakar III (1903-1988) who had been the Sultan of Sokoto for 50 years. Maccido served in many functions of government during his life and served most prominently as the liaison to Nigerian President Shehu Shagari (rule 1979-1983) until a military coup removed Shagari from power. When his father died in 1988, the head of the military government in Nigeria, Ibrahim Babangida appointed Ibrahim Dasuki (rule 1985-1993) as the new Sultan of Sokoto, a decision which caused large- scale, violent protests throughout northern Nigeria. In 1996, Sani Abacha (1993-1998), a later Nigerian military dictator, deposed Dasuki and named Maccido the new Sultan. Maccido was crowned on 21 April 1996 and ruled from the position for a decade. He used the position to try and reconcile divisions in the Muslim community of northern Nigeria, improve connections with other Muslim communities, and decrease ethnic tensions within Nigeria. On 29 October 2006, after meeting with President Olusegun Obasanjo, Maccido died in the plane crash of ADC Airlines Flight 53, with his son Badamasi Maccido, while returning to Sokoto. He is buried in Sokoto with many of the other Sultans of Sokoto. Early life Muhammadu Maccido was one of the few children born to Sultan Siddiq Abubakar III before Abubakar became the Sultan of Sokoto in 1938. He was born on 20 April 1928 on the outskirts of the city of Sokoto in the town of Dange Shuni. Many other children had died in childbirth and so when Muhammadu was born to Abubakar's senior wife Hauwa, he was given the additional name Maccido (meaning slave) to try and ward off bad luck. Although Abubakar only had two children before he became Sultan, he preceded to have 53 additional children after. Maccido was prominent in Abubakar's court while growing up and his father's system of leadership had significant impacts on Maccido's eventual reign. One example was in 1943 when Sardauna Ahmadu, who had challenged Abubakar in the selection as sultan, was accused of misappropriating tax money and was punished with jail by Abubakar; however, Ahmadu hired a lawyer in the south to appeal the conviction and the British court ordered the charges dropped. The political situation was quite tense after this and from this Maccido learned to reconcile with political opponents. Maccido was educated at the college in Zaria before studying in 1952-1953 at South Devon College in Great Britain. Entry into politics In the last decade of British rule over the territory, Maccido became active in various political roles. In 1951, Maccido became a member of the House of Assembly in Kaduna ruling the Sokoto Native Authority. Although very young and a junior member of the Assembly, he was able to create connections with many early Nigerian leaders because he was the son of the sultan. In the late 1950s, Zamfara and other communities in the north began to experience violent disorder with political parties struggling against each other before the 1959 elections. Maccido was dispatched to the communities to serve as the representative for the Sokoto Emirate in trying to reduce the tension. He held various posts in the Sokoto Native Authority in the 1950s including Councilor of Works (1956), Councilor for Rural Development (1959), and Councilor for Agriculture (1960). With the post-independence violence in Nigeria, which heightened significantly following the assassination of Premier Sir Ahmadu Bello (from Sokoto) in 1966, Maccido played a key role helping his father in trying to ease the violence. In Sokoto, a crowd of angry Muslims advanced toward the Catholic Church aiming to destroy the building as part of general anger towards Igbos and Christians. Maccido and Marafa, a brother-in-law, met the crowd and convinced them to disperse preventing destruction of the church. The following year, Maccido was made a North Western State Executive Council Commissioner and worked in the Ministry of Agriculture and then later the Ministry of Health. Although he kept distance from the military governments in the 1970s, he served as the presidential liaison officer between the Sokoto Emirate and the Nigerian head of state for many years during the Presidency of Shehu Shagari. In 1986, Maccido left politics around the country to tend to his ill father Abubakar and local politics in Sokoto. When his father was determined to be too ill for the responsibilities of the office, Maccido was part of an Inner Council to govern the Emirate. Dasuki as Sultan Abubakar III died on 1 November 1988 while Ibrahim Babangida was the head of the military government of Nigeria. As was traditional in the Sokoto religious structure, the electors of the various emirates undertook the issue and selected Maccido as the new Sultan on 3 November 1988. However, on 6 November, the military government of Babangida decided that Ibrahim Dasuki, who had challenged Maccido for the position and was a prominent business associate of Babangida, would become the new sultan. Violence immediately erupted in Sokoto and the rest of northern Nigeria with supporters of Maccido actively protesting the interference of the military in emirate matters. Maccido was sent in exile to South Africa. He returned after Babangida's reign but did not support active resistance of his followers to Dasuki. He encouraged his supporters to not associate with Dasuki's rule and remain separate. Life grew financially difficult for Maccido and his residence began to become unmaintained and his phone service was even disconnected for lack of payment. Many of the Muslims in northern Nigeria opposed Dasuki's rule, with a long list of complaints including that Dasuki had destroying the house of Muhammed Bello, the second Sultan, to make renovations to the palace complex. Sultan Maccido eventually recovered financially. He started importing goods and selling the goods to local businesses, just before he became sultan. Ibrahim Dasuki was removed from the position by military dictator Sani Abacha on 19 April 1996. Without going through the traditional Sokoto system of selection, Abacha named Maccido the new Sultan and he was turbaned, or a formal coronation, on 21 April 1996 in the Sultan Bello Mosque. As Sultan, he became the spiritual leader to Nigeria's Islamic community and head of the Sokoto Emirate. To avoid problems with Dasuki and his supporters, Maccido asked Abacha to ensure that he was treated humanely and that he would be allowed to return from exile after a brief period. When Dasuki was attacked at his home by armed robbers, Maccido sent an official envoy to provide support to Dasuki. As part of his position, he also became the Chairman of the Supreme Council for Islamic Affairs in Nigeria and made significant connections with other Muslim groups around the world from this position. He attended the World Conference on Islam, went to Saudi Arabia to raise money for Islamic schools, and engaged significantly with Muslims elsewhere in the world. To support Muslims in northern Nigeria, Maccido gave encouragement to a Muslim women's education organization, founded a school outside of Sokoto, and began a major push for the polio vaccine to be distributed widely. In 2004, he organized the celebrations of the bicentennial jihad of Usman dan Fodio, the founder of the Sokoto Emirate, and the start of the Fulani War. With increasing ethnic tensions between Christians and Muslims in Nigeria, Maccido attempted to end the violence and intervened many times to reduce tensions. During his time as sultan, he also conferred traditional titles on three of his sons. His son Malami was turbaned as \\"danburan sokoto\\"; Ahmed, who is now a senator, was turbaned as \\"Mainan Sokoto\\"; and Bello, who is the CEO of FBN holdings in Nigeria, was turbaned as \\"wakilin Sokoto\\". Even after the death of their father, they have all retained their titles as key princes of the caliphate. However, Maccido also opposed the Nigerian state government when they tried to grant Shi'ite migrants to the area the right to pray in the Sokoto mosques. Like his father, he opposed this effort and refused to provide prayer access for Shi'ite Muslims. Death After celebrating the Eid al-Fitr in 2006, Maccido went to Abuja to meet with President Olusegun Obasanjo. After that meeting, Maccido got on a plane back to Sokoto on Sunday 29 October. On the flight were one of his sons Badamasi Maccido (who was the Senator from Sokoto), his grandson, and other regional government authorities who were in Abuja for an education workshop. The ADC Airlines Flight 53 crashed just after takeoff killing most of the people on board including Maccido, his son, and grandson. Maccido's body was not burnt, making positive identification easy. His body was led through the streets of Sokoto with tens of thousand of mourners gathered. He was buried in the main tomb of the sultans of Sokoto (the Hubbare), near that of his father.

The family consists of husband Gordon, a high school science teacher, and his wife Susan, a nurse. Later, the family expands to include their adopted son Miles, as well as Gordon's sister Olivia, and his father Mr. Robinson. As African Americans, the family was created as leads for the show, originally targeted to underprivileged inner city children. Even as human roles were slowly reduced over the years, their characters maintained a constant presence. Character and production history =Inception= Sesame Street was created, through private and federal grants, as a television series to \\"give the disadvantaged child a fair chance at the beginning,\\" as co- creator Joan Ganz Cooney wrote in the 1967 study The Potential Uses of Television in Preschool Education.Cooney, Joan Ganz, The Potential Uses of Television in Preschool Education: A Report to Carnegie Corporation of New York. New York: CTW, 1967. Eric Document Reproduction Service ED122803. Especially before the inclusion of the Muppets in Street scenes,Note that a \\"Street scene\\" is one term for the segments on Sesame Street that take place on Sesame Street, the fictional street highlighted in the show. The rest of the program consists of segments relating to the episodes concepts, generally taking place elsewhere than the Street itself. Sesame Street was centered on Gordon and Susan. As per suggested by Harvard psychologist Jerome Kagan, Cooney advised in The Potential Uses that a series should feature a male lead, to \\"provide continuity from one segment to another, establish the tone, and function, subtly, as the master teacher.\\" A male teacher would both encourage kids to emulate an intelligent adult, and \\"defeminize the early learning atmosphere.\\" The decision to create such a character was backed up by research in the US government study The Negro Family: The Case for National Action. Known better as the Moynihan report, Assistant Secretary of Labor Daniel Patrick Moynihan suggested \\"the Negro community has been forced into a matriarchal structure which, because it is so out of line with the rest of the American society, seriously retards the progress of the group as a whole.\\"Moynihan, Daniel Patrick. The Negro Family: The Case for National Action. Washington, DC: US Department of Labor, Office of Policy Planning and Research, 1965. His report suggested that, after the Slavery-era of US history, the rise of out-of-wedlock births, absent fathers, and female-headed families only perpetuated cyclical poverty.Mandel, Jennifer. The Production of a Beloved Community: Sesame Street’s Answer to America’s Inequalities. The Journal of American Culture, 29:1, Blackwell Publishing, 2006. In his memoirs, Roscoe Orman who portrays Gordon Robinson commented that \\"what the character most significantly symbolizes, his most distinguishing and praiseworthy attribute, may lie in the simple fact that he is a man of African descent who for over three decades has been a respected and beloved father figure to young people of all races and all social classes all across America and beyond.\\" He continues to say that while \\"born in a country that was founded and has continued to thrive upon the subjugation of his ancestors, he harbors no hatred or thirst for revenge but, on the contrary, is a model of patience, understanding, and civic responsibility who embraces all of humankind.\\"Orman, Roscoe. Sesame Street Dad: Evolution of an Actor. 2005. Orman went on to describe his on-screen wife Susan Robinson as an \\"exemplary model of African- American womanhood\\" and the couple's on-going relationship \\"in sharp contrast to the prevailing images of black men that have been projected within mainstream American culture since and especially prior to Sesame Street’s premiere and certainly during the formative years of my own generation.\\" Feminists objected to the character of Susan because they felt she fulfilled stereotypes they were against, that of a stay-at-home wife. Historian Robert W. Morrow defends Susan's creators, stating that their goal was presenting Gordon as a strong black male capable of supporting his family. Sesame Street's producers responded to this criticism by making Susan a nurse during the show's second season, and by introducing Gordon's sister Olivia in 1976. =Casting= Actors were selected for the roles of Gordon, Susan, Bob, and Mr. Hooper by an audience of children who had watched videotaped performances.Borgenicht, David. Sesame Street Unpaved: Scripts, Stories, Secrets, and Songs. New York: Hyperion, 1998. While some shows replace actors appearing in pilot episodes due to audience involvement, casting control this early on was and is unusual. In a series of test pilots, Garrett Saunders played Gordon; records of his appearance were lost by producers, and his identity unknown until his family identified him in 2011. Matt Robinson had joined Children's Television Workshop (CTW) to assist in the development of Sesame Street, producing and overseeing filmed segments focusing on the diversity of different characters on the show. Robinson was eventually chosen to play the fictional character of Gordon in the series, after the performance of the character by Saunders in test episodes did not work out as the producers hoped.Sesame Street on Tumblr: \\"We Found Gordon!\\", December 9, 2011. Gordon was the first character with spoken lines in the show, as a result of difficulty in finding someone to fill the figure. This was against his original intentions with joining the show as he preferred a behind-the-scenes role, and was initially reluctant to take the part. Dolores Robinson commented on his backseat role on the set with, “He was by nature shy, and he knew that they were having a difficult time casting Gordon. And the people overseeing the taping up in the booth, peering at the monitors, kept saying, ‘Matt knows what to do. He should be the Gordon.’”(Street Gang: The Complete History of Sesame Street)Davis, Michael. Street Gang: The Complete History of Sesame Street. New York: Viking Adult, 2008. N. pag. Print. He ultimately resigned from the role in 1972. In early episodes, it was often Gordon introducing and concluding the program. Loretta Long was chosen to play the lead role of Susan. Long's prior experience included hosting Soul!, a variety series on NET (later PBS). Initially, Long was a supply teacher for schools in the Bronx area, which reportedly surprised and confused many young students. Long earned her doctorate in Urban Education in 1973 from the University of Massachusetts Amherst, during the show's fourth season. Because Long had grown up on a farm in Michigan, the show's writers established that Susan had as well. =1969–1971= Sesame Street’s first episode centers on Gordon taking a girl named Sally around Sesame Street, to get acquainted with everyone and everything in her new neighborhood. Susan gets a job From its inception, Sesame Street has been highly scrutinized by critics of all kinds. While the program was specially conceived to represent racial harmony, as suggested by followers of Dr. King, the \\"second-wave\\" feminist movement had not yet risen to prominence. Cynthia Eaton and Susan Chase of the National Organization for Women (NOW) studied the series, in particular male and female interaction. NOW insisted that the program marginalized women and their role in society. \\"After they presented their observations and concerns about our institutionalizing stereotypes, Jon Stone said 'Well, let's give Susan a career.'\\" Stone was the primary director for the show. Susan became a public health nurse, who would run immunization clinics on Sesame Street. Gordon also was regularly shown helping Susan with household chores. Long recalled to Cooney in 1976 that, \\"I was too nice at the beginning, the great dispenser of milk and cookies.\\"Cooney, Joan Ganz. Sesame Street. 1,000 Hours of a Perpetual Television Experiment. New York: CTW, 1976. Eric Document Reproduction Service ED130634. Some feminists still referred to her as \\"a hapless, hopelessly vague mother\\", even after the change.Bergman, Jane. \\"Are Little Girls Being Harmed by Sesame Street?\\". Sex Differences and Discrimination in Education. Ed. Scarvia B. Anderson. Worthington, OH: Jones Publishing, 1972. 50–53. Even with the addition of Sonia Manzano as the young, single woman Maria in the third season, critics still chided \\"All in all, Sesame Street has changed, from being incredibly sexist to being slightly less sexist\\" This view was helped by characters like Betty Lou, \\"a simpering, querulous little girl with pigtails and a squeaky voice\\". Hip Muppet deemed stereotype Matt Robinson was, however, the voice of Roosevelt Franklin, a purple Muppet meant to represent an African American boy. While the skits with the character musically provided reading and writing concepts, critics found his jive-talking to be a cultural stereotype, and the producers of the series removed him. Roscoe Orman provided the voice of one of Roosevelt's classmates, Hardhat Henry Harris, before joining the series as the third actor to play Gordon. The Roosevelt Franklin Muppet occasionally turned up in multi-Muppet musical routines such as \\"Clap, Clap, Clap\\" and the Canadian edition of Sesame Street continued to air the Franklin segments well into the early 1980s. =1972–1974= Miller as Gordon, with Long as Susan and Caroll Spinney as Oscar the Grouch. Undated publicity photo, likely from 1972. Hal Miller became Gordon for a brief stretch, 1972 to 1974. Unlike Matt Robinson, Miller didn't sport a moustache, and was slightly heavier-set. =1974–present= Roscoe Orman became the third Gordon in 1974, a role he kept until 2016. \\"The kids who were on the show that first season would not accept me as Gordon,\\" Orman remarked. \\"One day there's Hal [Miller] as Gordon and the next day there's this new guy who says he's Gordon... the kids, both on the show and at home... they just assume that we are that person we're playing.\\" Lance, Steven. Written Out of Television: A TV Lover's Guide to Cast Changes, 1945-1994. Maryland: Madison Books, 1996. Adopting Miles In 1985, Roscoe Orman and his wife were about to have their second child together; Big Bird puppeteer Caroll Spinney mentioned this to his wife Debra. The two went to producer Dulcy Singer, suggesting that Gordon and Susan should have a child on the show. It was decided that the on-screen couple would adopt, instead of Susan being pregnant, and that new-born Miles Orman take the role. It was revealed that Susan had been trying to become pregnant, but to no avail due to infertility. At age seven, Miles Orman quit the series, and was replaced by child actor Imani Patterson. Before the series of episodes where Miles is adopted, Gordon and Susan lacked last names. \\"Robinson\\", named after original Gordon actor Matt Robinson, was shown as Miles' last name on his adoption certificate. Alternatively, Orman has suggested that the name was revealed in a different storyline aired in 1991, involving Gordon teaching in the classroom. Writers felt that the students couldn't address their teacher as \\"Gordon\\", so Orman suggested \\"Mr. Robinson\\". Similarly, Mr. Hooper's first name was only revealed on his GED, Bob Johnson's last name went unrevealed for years, and Gina Jefferson's last name first appeared on the door of her new veterinary practice, in 2002. Trash Gordon Roscoe Orman has garnered more screen time since season 35, playing Trash Gordon, the hero of a series of bedtime stories Oscar the Grouch reads to Slimey the Worm at the end of each episode. Based on Flash Gordon, Trash is an intergalactic traveller, who encounters odd creatures on each planet he visits. Trash Gordon escapes peril in each chapter, thanks to his quick thinking; when a living pile of rotten bananas confronts Trash, for example, it is soon chased away by an \\"Intergalactical Monkey\\" he happened to have with him.Sesame Street episode 4061, first broadcast in 2005, on PBS. Recent appearances Roscoe Orman has played Gordon from 1974 to 2016. He is seen here at the 2007 Texas Book Festival in Austin, Texas. Looking back on his role, over the last 33 years, Orman commented \\"If I could boast of no other major career accomplishment, having played a central role as I have in the development and continuation of this landmark series would alone have made my life sufficiently meaningful. The historical significance of Sesame Street and its surprising longevity have made my association with the show, in many regards, my life's crowning achievement.\\" However, Orman doesn't credit Sesame Street as having defined himself personally and his overall career; The Free Southern Theater of New Orleans and The New Lafayette Theatre of Harlem collectively take that honor. By 2002, Imani Patterson left his role as Miles, and was replaced by actor Olamide Faison. As a recording artist of the mildly successful hip-hop group Imajin,Sesame Street - Season 37 Press Kit - Cast Bios Faison could be used more frequently as a singer on the series. Plot lines like season 36 episode 4089 focused on Miles singing numerous 1960s-style parody songs for American Fruitstand. In episode 4112 (2006), Miles graduated high school alongside Gabi, despite the fact that the characters' respective births on the show occurred four years apart. A flashback in this episode also revealed that Miles was shy on his first day of school. Loretta Long and Bob McGrath are the only two remaining non-puppeteer actors on Sesame Street from its first episode, as Will Lee (Mr. Hooper) died in 1982 and Matt Robinson left the show in 1972. While neither actor has appeared in a significant number of episodes since about season 38, the longevity of their roles are with few precedents. Of the Muppets from the first episode--Big Bird, Oscar the Grouch, Kermit the Frog, Cookie Monster, and Bert and Ernie--all except Kermit are still major characters on the show. However, Jim Henson (Kermit, Ernie) died, with Steve Whitmire playing Ernie (Kermit no longer appears); Frank Oz, busy as a director, now only puppeteers Grover, Bert, and Cookie Monster a couple of times each season (David Rudman and Eric Jacobson have largely taken over his characters); and Caroll Spinney retired in 2018, handing over the role of Big Bird to Matt Vogel, and Oscar the Grouch to Jacobson. On July 28, 2016, it was announced that Gordon would be dropped from the show as Orman's contract was not renewed as part of Sesame Workshop's re-tooling for the series. Following his departure, the workshop stated that Orman would continue to represent them at public events. =Birthdays= Since Sesame Street Magazine published calendars in every issue, character birthdays were established. Gordon's birthday is February 24, Susan's is May 4, and Miles's is December 4. Relatives Kevin Clash as Adult Miles on episode 2313. Susan's parents' first appearance on the series. Writers introduced the character of Olivia (Gordon's sister), played by actress Alaina Reed Hall, in 1976 to show a relationship between adult siblings. Olivia was a photographer and last appeared on the show in 1988 (so Reed could work on the TV sitcom 227), although the television special The Street We Live On included archive footage of her. Reed died of breast cancer on December 17, 2009, at the age of 63. In episode 4067 (season 35), Carl Gordon played Mr. Robinson, Gordon's father. Kevin Clash played a grown-up version of Miles in episode 2313. In this episode, Miles has a son. In one episode, c. 1975, Susan leaves the Street for a day to visit her mother, who has taken ill, in Merton, which according to Gordon, is a few hours from New York by plane and a short train ride after landing. Susan's parents were seen in episode 2125 (season 17), in which they visited Gordon and Susan after they adopted Miles. They revisited the Street in episode 2226 (season 18), Gordon and Susan threw a party to celebrate the one-year anniversary of Miles' adoption, in which the event was reenacted with Big Bird as Gordon, Snuffy as Susan, and Elmo as the adoption agent. Susan's father is Lee (played by Bill Cobbs), and her mother is Dorothy (Frances Foster). Her parents came back for another visit in episode 2820 (season 22), in which the short-lived character Preston Rabbit was also a guest at the Robinson's apartment. Added to the show in 2007 was Gordon and Susan's nephew, Chris Robinson, played by actor Chris Knowings. The character is still a regular on the program, working at Hooper's Store with Alan. Merchandise Gordon, Susan, and Mr. Hooper were all turned into Little People toy figures in 1975, nearly the only toys ever created of the human characters of Sesame Street (a Mr. Noodle doll was created in the early 2000s). Gordon and Susan, as well as other humans on the series have been included in various books, particularly during the 1970s and 1980s. During the early years, Susan often sang \\"One of These Things\\". She also headlined her own album, Susan Sings Songs from Sesame Street, and had minor roles in both Sesame Street movies. Robinson and Long appeared in the original Sesame Street Live touring production, while Orman and Long make occasional appearances in and out of character. In the summer of 2005, Orman appeared as Gordon with Kevin Clash puppeteering Elmo at series sponsor Beaches Family Resorts in Jamaica.Kathy Rumleski, \\"Come and play\\", London Free Press, 22 October 2005.

One little girl, who Orman estimates was aged seven or eight, approached him for a hug, a regular occurrence. He noticed her hug, wrapping around his neck, was \\"unusually ardent, [with an] almost desperate quality of… embrace\\". Orman later discovered that he was the first adult male she had been willing to approach, after being sexually abused by a family member, \\"some time ago\\".

As many fans didn't know there were two actors who previously portrayed Gordon before the current Roscoe Orman, and many didn't know Orman's name, rumor spread that it was Orman who died. Hal Miller's post-Sesame career included three movie appearances and one production credit; only one of the roles was named.

In 2000, Poulsen became fed up with the death metal music scene, causing Dominus to break up. In 2001, Poulsen went on to form a new band with some friends and other former Dominus members. This was the beginning of Volbeat. The band name \\"Volbeat\\" was derived from Dominus's third album name, Vol.Beat (read as: Volume Beat). After selling 1,000 copies of their Beat the Meat demo tape, Volbeat was signed to a record deal by Rebel Monster Records, a sub-label of Mascot Records.

For comparison, nearby Cherry Creek Reservoir normally contains 13,500 acre feet (against the maximum capacity of 134,470 acre feet), and Chatfield Reservoir normally holds 27,076 acre feet (against the maximum capacity of 355,000 acre feet). The reason for the dramatic difference between the normal capacity and the maximum capacity of the nearby reservoirs is due to their primary purpose being flood control, rather than storage.  Communities Served  The reservoir will serve PWSD customers (approx. 25,000 residents/customers) and partner communities of Castle Rock (8,000 Ac. Ft., contributed $44 million and has 44,000 customers), Castle Pines North (1,500 Ac. Ft., $8.25M, 3,200 customers) and Stonegate (1,200 Ac. Ft., $6.6M, 2,700 customers).http://www.pwsd.org/pdf/RHResFactsSheet.pdf  Recreation  August 2015 PWSD consummated an agreement with Castle Pines, Castle Rock, Lone Tree, Parker and Douglas County that forms a recreation authority. PWSD brings nearly two sections of land for passive recreation while the other participants bring funding and recreation experts to the deal.  Treatment plant  In August 2015, a state-of-the-art, ceramic membrane, water treatment plant to return Rueter-Hess water to PWSD potable water lines came on line. History of the project The origins of the Rueter–Hess project began over 20 years ago, long before the town of Parker became the vibrant suburban- Denver community that it is today. The owner of the project is Parker Water and Sanitation District (PWSD) (a special District unaffiliated with the Town of Parker) . PWSD was formed in 1962 and incorporated in 1981 at a time when the population of Parker was 285. As the town grew, slowly at first, the need for water was recognized. March 20, 1985 marks the date when a water right was legally conveyed to PWSD to divert Cherry Creek water. It is this decree that would eventually permit PWSD to divert surface waters and alluvial groundwater from Cherry Creek to the Rueter–Hess Reservoir. = Site selection = Other locations had been considered for the reservoir and dam prior to a final determination. By December, 1991 after further water studies, PWSD determined, \\"...that the Castlewood Canyon site [south of Parker] was the most favorable location for upstream water storage and, therefore, the two additional sites were dropped from the Water Court application. Therefore, PWSD continued with plans for building the dam and reservoir at Castlewood Canyon State Park (Ciruli and Associates, 1999).\\" The reservoir \\"would flood much of the state park and the cattle operations on historic ranches nearby (McKibben, 1991).\\" = Legal battle = In early 1993, PWSD and the town of Parker became involved as plaintiffs in a civil court action to appropriate the state land comprising the Castlewood Canyon State Park needed for the dam and reservoir. The town and PWSD had petitioned to condemn certain property owned by the state in order to determine the feasibility of recreation and a water storage project on the state park land. The District Court of Douglas County had found for the state dismissing the petition from PWSD on the grounds that the town and district did not have authority to condemn state-owned lands. The town and PWSD appealed. On March 11, 1993, the Colorado Court of Appeals issued a decision in Town of Parker & Parker Water and Sanitation District v. The Colorado Division of Parks and Outdoor Recreation. No. 92CA0494. The appellate court also found for the state. The town of Parker and PWSD decided they would continue with their legal options to the Colorado Supreme Court. Consequently, in June, 1993, PWSD filed a motion in Division 1 Water Court to add two alternate sites for the dam and reservoir in the event that any further civil actions remained unsuccessful in the attempt to condemn state land for the state park site. One alternate site was located on a tributary of Cherry Creek just upstream of Castlewood Canyon State Park; the other, to be located in Newlin Gulch southwest of Parker. This second alternate site was to eventually become the site of the Rueter–Hess dam and reservoir. On November 1, 1993, the Supreme Court of Colorado upheld the decision of the district and appellate courts in Town of Parker & Parker Water and Sanitation District v. The Colorado Division of Parks and Outdoor Recreation. No. 93SC301. The high court had once again found for the state. = Naming = The Newlin Gulch site was the home of several long time ranchers, including the Rueter and Hess families. The Parker Water & Sanitation District needed to purchase Ms. Rosie (Rueter) Hess's property. One of her conditions of sale was the naming of the reservoir after both her married and maiden names. = Construction = Ground was broken for a 17,000 acre feet project 2004. The entire project was planned to be completed in late 2007 at a cost of over $120 million. When initial construction was nearly complete, other water districts joined the project and funded expansion to 72,000 acre feet (75,000 as built). Final completion was in 2012 at a total cost of around $170 million not including land, capitalized interest and other per-construction costs. = Water flows = A moist 2013, 2014 and first half 2015 in Colorado resulted in a free stream much of the time since then. Free stream conditions combined with return flows resulted in routine 25 to 30 acre feet of water a day being pumped to the reservoir by the three megawatt pumping station at Cherry Creek. As of July 2017, the reservoir was about 38% full, containing over 27,600 acre feet of water, more than three times the current annual demand of PWSD. Considering that PWSD operates a Reuse paradigm, in reality this represents enough water for the district for nearly 6 years.

He served one term as a U.S. Representative for Louisiana's 4th congressional district. He also served as a member of the Louisiana House of Representatives and as chairman of the Louisiana Democratic Party. In 2003, he was a candidate for governor of Louisiana. Early life, education, and career Leach was born in Leesville in Vernon Parish in western Louisiana. He graduated from Leesville High School. In 1951, Leach entered Louisiana State University, from which he earned his Bachelor of Science. In 1954, Leach was diagnosed with polio. He suffered from temporary paralysis but eventually recovered from the disease. After attending college, Leach served in the United States Army from 1956 to 1959. He returned to college for law school and, in 1963, he obtained his Juris Doctorate from the Louisiana State University Law Center in Baton Rouge. In 1964, he was admitted to the Louisiana State Bar Association and began a law practice in Leesville. After his father Anthony Leach, Sr. died, \\"Buddy\\" Leach began running the family plumbing business. Leach sold the business after finding new jobs for all of the employees. He later became president and CEO of Sweet Lake Land and Oil Company and North American Land Company in Lake Charles in Calcasieu Parish in southwestern Louisiana. State and U.S. House of Representatives Leach had joined the Democratic Party, which through the mid-20th century was dominated in Louisiana by conservative white members. In 1968, Leach was elected to the Louisiana House of Representatives. In his first term, he served in a two-member district with fellow Democrat E. Holman Jones of Oakdale, Allen Parish. Leach was reelected in 1972 and 1976. In 1979, he gave up his seat to run for U.S. Representative from Louisiana's 4th congressional district. In 1980, he was unseated by fellow Democrat Buddy Roemer of Bossier Parish. Roemer later shifted to the Republican Party, a pattern increasingly followed by conservative whites in the state. In 1983, Leach sought to regain his former state legislative seat.\\"Leach will try again for La. House seat\\", Minden Press-Herald, March 23, 1983, p. 1. He defeated incumbent Democrat, William H. West. In his last term as a state legislator, Leach served on the House Ways and Means Committee. In this capacity, he recommended that a tax be placed on foreign oil processed within the state. Campaign for Governor In 2003, Leach launched his gubernatorial campaign, seeking a runoff berth in a crowded field. He campaigned on changing the operations of state government. He suggested that the state use a \\"brillo pad\\" to \\"scrub the budget.\\" Having been diagnosed with polio at a young age, the topic of health care in Louisiana was one of his main priorities. Many young voters were attracted to his campaign's message. He had teams of volunteers set up in Shreveport, Baton Rouge, and New Orleans. Many other candidates were in the race, including Democrats Kathleen Blanco, the lieutenant governor; and Richard Ieyoub, the outgoing state attorney general. Republicans ran Bobby Jindal as their candidate. Leach came in fourth place in the blanket primary behind Kathleen Blanco, Bobby Jindal, the top two finishers, and Richard Ieyoub. Kathleen Blanco went on to win the general election over Republican Jindal. Chairman of the Louisiana Democratic Party In 2010, Leach was elected chairman of the Louisiana Democratic Party in a special election. During his tenure as chairman, the party struggled to field candidates for statewide offices. This was a contrast from when Leach first entered politics in what was then an overwhelmingly Democratic state dominated by conservative whites. Before the late 1960s, African Americans were still largely disenfranchised in the state, totally excluded from politics, as they had been since 1898. The party was unable to find a well-funded candidate to run in 2011 against Governor Bobby Jindal. For the first time since Reconstruction, Democrats lost both houses of the state legislature to Republicans. On April 28, 2012, Leach lost his reelection bid as state party chair to State Senator Karen Carter Peterson of New Orleans. Family Leach's children include his eldest daughter, Mary Leach Werner (born January 1968), who has followed him into politics. She was an unsuccessful candidate for the Louisiana Public Service Commission in 2016 for the seat held by the late Clyde C. Holloway, a former U.S. representative from Louisiana's 8th congressional district, since disbanded. She was defeated by Mike Francis of Lafayette, a former Louisiana Republican Party state chairman.

The seal contains a historic depiction of Buffalo harbor surrounded by the legend, \\"Seal of the City of Buffalo.\\" History =First Seal= Though founded in 1831, the City of Buffalo did not have an official seal until 1919. Upon a request by the Julius Bien Company in New York City to provide a description of the municipal banner, the Common Council adopted its first official flag and seal. The official seal was described by the Common Council: “To the left center lighthouse on pier with ship passing it into harbor. To the lower right canal boat passing into canal to the right surrounded in circle by the legend ‘City of Buffalo, Incorporated 1832.’” =Two Seals= The city flag, also established, was meant to incorporate the official city seal. When produced though, the flag did not include the seal passed by the Common Council. Instead, the seal illustrated a slightly different port scene, the pier and the ship were different, and two port animals drag the canal boat into harbor the opposite direction. By 1930, the seal ordinance that was passed in 1912 had been omitted by the Common Council. For the next ten years, Buffalo was again without an official city seal. Instead, until 1939 with the ordinance of a new official seal, Buffalo would have two unofficial seals in circulation. One seal, that established by the Common Council in 1912 was used by most departments in City Hall. The other seal, the one appearing on the flag and surrounded by the legend, “Seal of the City of Buffalo,” was used on all official documents of the Mayor and Comptroller. =Current Seal= Early in 1939 a Buffalo News articles revealed that Buffalo lacked an official seal and brought the two seal discrepancy to the public eye. Just two days later the Common Council proposed a new official seal, the Mayoral version. By mid November the new seal was certified and by mid December it was repealed. It was determined that additional stonecutting costs would total $3,200 if the new design was placed on the façade of Convention Hall, therefore the seal was repealed. Eight days after its repeal, the ordinance detailing the seal was reinstated. The official seal of the City of Buffalo was described: “To the left center, lighthouse on pier; to the right of the lighthouse, ship with three (3) masts showing sails; to the lower right, canal boat drawn by two (2) draft animals proceeding in direction leading toward or past pier; the above, all, surrounded by a double circle and between said circles appearing the words ‘SEAL OF THE CITY OF BUFFALO.’\\" It appears that the current seal is an evolved form of a former Buffalo seal from the mid 19th century.

Life and playing career Born in Linlithgow, Allan played for Vale of Avon, Linlithgow Athletic, Broxburn Shamrock and Leith Athletic before being signed by Liverpool manager John McKenna and William Barclay in September 1895. The 20-year-old Allan made quite an impact for Liverpool after making his debut in a Football League Second Division match a 5-1 home thumping of Newcastle on 14 September 1895, he scored his first goal for the club 7 days later on 21 September against Loughborough Town at the Athletic Ground. This sparked an impressive goals per game run for the rest of the 1895/96 promotion season, he bagged an amazing 25 league goals from just 20 appearances, averaging 1.25 goals per games, Allan scored a further 3 goals in the promotion Test matches (the equivalent of today's play-offs) helping the Anfield club regain their spot back in the top flight of English football. Allan moved to Celtic in May 1897 where he carried on his goalscoring exploits hitting 15 goals in 17 games, helping the club win the Scottish league. He returned to Anfield a year later when new manager Tom Watson re-signed him in April 1898. Allan scored 58 goals in only 96 appearances during his 2 spells at Liverpool, an average of a goal every 1.65 games. He made his only Scotland appearance on 3 April 1897, in a 2-1 victory against England at Crystal Palace. Allan was a prolific goalscorer who could have gone on to be one of the all-time greats, but his life was cut short when he contracted tuberculosis in 1899 during his second spell at Liverpool; he was forced to give up playing and died of the condition on 17 October.

Their capital was at Caudium, but it seems certain that the appellation was not confined to the citizens of Caudium and its immediate territory.  Description  Livy speaks in more than one passage of the Caudini as a tribe or people, in the same terms as of the Hirpini,\\"Marcellus ab Nola crebras excursiones in agrum Hirpinum et Samnites Caudinos fecit\\", Livy xxiii. 41; \\"Caudinus Samnis gravius devastatus\\", Id. xxiv. 20 and Niebuhr supposed them to have been one of the four tribes comprising the Samnite confederacyNieb. vol. i. p. 107, vol. ii. p. 85. As the most western of the Samnite groups, they were the Samnite tribe most affected by the neighbouring Greeks of Campania. Together with the Hirpini, Pentri, and Carceni tribes, the Caudini people were described as rustic, thriving on an agrarian economy mainly as massari (peasant farmers) and pecorari (herdsmen and shepherds). The extent of their territory is unclear. The ancient poet Gratius Faliscus (Cyneget. 509) called the great mountain mass of the Taburnus the \\"Caudinus Taburnus\\", and this must have been at the center of their territory. It probably joined that of the Hirpini on the one side and of the Pentri on the other, while on the west it bordered immediately on Campania. But the name is not recognised by any of the geographers as a general appellation, and appears to have fallen into disuse: the Caudini of Pliny (iii. 11. s. 16) are only the citizens of Caudium. The cities of the Caudini included Caudium (modern Montesarchio), Telesia (modern \\"San Salvatore Telesino\\"), Saticula (modern \\"Sant'Agata de' Goti\\"), Caiatia (modern Caiazzo), Trebula, and Cubulteria.  Samnite Wars  The Caudini are nowhere mentioned as a separate tribe in our narratives of the Romans' Samnite Wars, probably because they were assumed included whenever the Samnites were mentioned. The territory of the Caudini was the scene of much fighting. This could be attributed to the tribe's location, which was the most westerly among the Samnites, hence, the most exposed to attacks by the Romans. Velleius Paterculus (ii. 1) says that it was with the Caudini that the Romans made their treaty following their defeat at the Battle of the Caudine Forks, where Livy uniformly talks of the Samnites. In 275 BC, the tribe was subjugated by L. Cornelius Lentulus, whose family henceforth took the name ‘Caudinus’. Caudini later revolted in 216. It is suggested that the tribe was encouraged to turn against the Romans after the arrival of Hannibal's army near Capua. During the Second Punic War, the Roman historian Livy reported Caudini's defection after the Roman defeat at Cannae.

It is designated as a Grade I-listed building and is open to the public. History The original manor house in Tatton Park was Tatton Old Hall. Around 1716 a new hall was built in a more elevated position on the site of the present mansion some to the west. This house was a rectangular block of seven bays with three storeys. From 1758 the owner Samuel Egerton began to make improvements to the house, in particular a rococo interior to his drawing room (now the dining room), designed by Thomas Farnolls Pritchard.Colvin, s.v. \\"Pritchard, Thomas Farnolls\\". During the 1770s Samuel Egerton commissioned Samuel Wyatt to design a house in Neoclassical style. Both Samuel Egerton and Samuel Wyatt died before the house was finished, and it was completed (1807–16), on a reduced scale, by Wilbraham Egerton and Lewis William Wyatt, Samuel Wyatt's nephew.Colvin, s.v. \\"Wyatt, Lewis William\\" Samuel Wyatt had planned a house of eleven bays, but Lewis reduced this to seven. Wilbraham bought a number of fine paintings, and many items of furniture made by Gillows of Lancaster. In 1861–62 an upper floor was added to the family wing to a design by G. H. Stokes. In 1884, a family entrance hall was added to the north face, and a smoking room to the extreme west of the family wing; and electricity was installed in the hall. During the later part of the 19th century Wilbraham Egerton, 1st Earl Egerton, hosted large house parties in the hall. Eminent guests included the Prince and Princess of Wales in 1887, and at later dates the Shah of Persia and the Crown Prince of Siam. The last member of the Egerton family to live in the hall was Maurice Egerton. He made a large collection of objects from around the world, some which are on display in the hall. On his death in 1958 Maurice Egerton bequeathed the mansion and gardens to the National Trust. Exterior The north face of Tatton Hall. The main body of the hall and the family wing to the west, both in two storeys, are built in ashlar Runcorn sandstone with slate and lead roofs. The additions of 1884 (family entrance hall and smoking room) are faced in yellow terracotta. The south front of the hall has seven bays. At its centre is a large Corinthian portico with four monolithic columns. The north front is simpler in design, also with seven bays, and it has a pedimented porch with two columns. The east front has five bays with Corinthian pilasters on a slightly projecting plinth and an entablature above. The family wing has seven bays. The south front has a Tuscan colonnade on the lower storey and an Ionic colonnade, verandah and balustrade above. Interior Not all of the rooms are open to the public. The major rooms which are open are described below. =Hall= Ground floor The Entrance Hall The Dining Room The Music Room The Main Staircase The Drawing Room The Library The Entrance Hall is in three bays. It is decorated in neoclassical style with a marble floor, red porphyry Ionic columns and a geometric coffered, tunnel vaulted ceiling. The furniture includes two late-17th-century Italian chests of drawers and a walnut chest dating from around 1730, and a 19th-century walnut table and chairs. On each side of a central niche are marble busts of the Duke of Wellington and William Pitt the Younger on columns. The largest painting in the entrance hall is The Cheshire Hunt, 1839 by Henry Calvert. To the west of the entrance hall is the Card Room (where calling cards were left – not for playing cards, as in other Card Rooms). This room has a neoclassical cornice and fireplace. A set of open arm chairs are English in the Adam style which date from around 1785. Other furniture dates from the 19th century in Louis XVI marquetry style. In a showcase is a rare silver filigree Horn Book. Paintings in the room include La Gouvernante by Chardin, The Head of an Old Man, 1639 by Abraham Bloemaert, A Farrier's by Philips Wouwerman, and Head of Nicodemus after Rogier van der Weyden. On the other side of the Entrance Hall is the Music Room whose walls are decorated with cherry-coloured silk damask. Much of the furniture is in the French Boulle revival style (with brass inlays in the style of André Charles Boulle). An alcove was intended to be occupied by an organ but it contains a rosewood bookcase in boulle work. The circular table, couches and chairs are also in boulle style, made by Gillows. The fireplace is made from white marble and is decorated with images of musical instruments and motifs. Two vases on the mantelpiece are 19th-century Meissen. The harpsichord was made by Kirckman's and is dated 1789. The paintings include pieces by Gaspard Dughet, Aernout van der Neer, Nicolaes Pieterszoon Berchem, and Guercino, and two still life paintings by Jan Davidszoon de Heem and Cornelis de Heem. To the south of the music room is the Drawing Room which is decorated in a similar style. The ceiling is gilded and coffered and is decorated with rosettes. Together with its elaborate furniture it is the \\"most impressive and ostentatious room in the house\\". The paintings include two views of Venice by Canaletto, The Sacrifice of Noah by Poussin, The Martyrdom of St. Stephen by Van Dyck, and paintings by Annibale Carracci and Giovanni Battista Cimaroli. A full-length portrait of Samuel Egerton is by Bartolomeo Nazari. Behind the portico on the south front of the house is the Library. The furniture in this room is practical rather than decorative, most of it again having been made by Gillows. The bookcases date from 1811–12. The pair of globes, terrestrial and celestial, were made by the Cary family. On top of the bookcases are Dutch Delft vases and jars from the 17th–18th centuries. The room contains over 8,000 books, many in their original covers and in mint condition. The earliest book is dated 1513. Some of the books are unbound and in their original paper covers, including first editions of two novels by Jane Austen. Other than a portrait of Charles II, all the paintings in the library are portraits of members of the Egerton family. To the west of the Library is the Dining Room. This is a survival from the original house and is decorated in rococo style designed by Thomas Farnolls Pritchard. The white marble fireplace dates from 1840 and was designed by Richard Westmacott. Most of the furniture in the room is made in mahogany by Gillows. The paintings in the room are all portraits of the Egerton family. In the centre of the building are the main stairs. These rise from the Staircase Hall which is lit by a domed oval skylight. To east of this hall, through two pairs of marble columns, is the Cupola Hall. On its floor is an Axminster carpet with an unusual design showing celestial objects and the signs of the Zodiac for the winter months. The halls contain English furniture in Adam style and items of oriental ceramics. Upper floor The walls of the Upper Landing On the walls of the upper landing are ten full-length portraits known as The Cheshire Gentlemen. They portray ten of the leading gentlemen of the county who met together at Ashley Hall to decide whether to support King George I or James Stuart in the Jacobite rising of 1715. They decided to support the king, which probably saved their lives and their estates. The bedrooms are named mainly after the type or colour of the original drapery. All the bedrooms, except the Lemon Room, have adjoining dressing rooms. The furniture in all the rooms was supplied by Gillows. The Silk Bedroom is above the Entrance Hall and was one of the principal guest rooms. It contains furniture of mahogany inlaid with ebony. The bed is a cut-down four poster bed. The Silk Dressing Room contains a large tin bath on castors. The other bedrooms are the Chintz Bedroom, which is furnished as a sitting room, the Lemon Bedroom, and the Amber Bedroom, which is furnished as a Victorian day nursery. Most of the paintings in the bedrooms depict family members. The Egerton Room was originally the Blue Bedroom but, with its dressing room, is now used for an exhibition about the Egerton family. In addition to family portraits, the paintings in these rooms include schemes for the design of the house by the architects, and paintings of architectural features by J. C. Buckler. There are also three paintings of excavations for the Manchester Ship Canal by Benjamin Williams Leader. Wilbraham Egerton, 1st Earl Egerton was the second chairman of the Manchester Ship Canal Company from 1887 to 1894. The dressing room includes paintings by Vasari and Tosini. =Family wing= The Kitchen Entering the family wing from the hall, the first room on the left, beyond the garden entrance, is the Yellow Drawing Room. This has a more intimate atmosphere and contains a collection of satinwood furniture made by Gillows. This includes a bookcase dated 1795 and a pair of cabinets on each side of the fireplace. The paintings are family portraits. Opposite this room is the Family Entrance and opposite the garden entrance is the Oak Staircase which was moved here from Hough End Hall. The Servants' Quarters occupy two floors, the ground floor and basement. These contain the usual rooms required to service a mansion and many of these are furnished with the equipment and utensils formerly in use in the house. One room, known as the Maurice Egerton Exhibition Room, houses a collection of items from around the world which were collected by Maurice Egerton on his travels.

Reynolds West Side High School is a New York City Public Alternative High School located on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. Known for many years simply as \\"West Side High,\\" it was renamed in honor of the school's longtime principal following his unexpected death in 2001.  History  Regular planning for West Side High School began during the summer of 1972, with a few adults and a group of young students from local public junior high schools, primarily from Booker T. Washington Jr. HS 54 and Jr. HS 44 on West 77th Street. As soon as school was out that year, the summer planning phase for West Side High School began. Students and adults met five days a week to plan for the new school program. In addition to regular day-long planning the staff and students attended evening meetings with the community to justify the program, bolster support and try to gain approval; some members of the nearby community were not welcoming. The meetings were video taped; though no tapes have yet surfaced. Approval from the New York City Board of Education was granted during a NYC School Board public meeting where students, staff and parents all spoke in favor of the school (some dissenting voices were also heard). The first classes were in the Fall of 1972. West Side High was designed to be an alternative public school providing something more than the typical public high school fare. Early on, the school had 100 students, three full-time teachers, and a dedicated office manager, Doris Rosenblum. Directors and other staff members who were connected with the school in those first years, planning, operating and teaching in the school, were Michael Levien, Mike Bettinger, and Bob Lefcourt. By the mid 1970s the population of the school was about 125 students, which grew to 325 in 1980, and to 500 by the 1990s. In the 1970s, West Side High was an experiment in several philosophies of educational thinking. Its students were a mix of all types of students from both local public and private schools. There were disaffected youth and those who didn’t fit into traditional high school settings, as well there were students kicked out of programs at other school and deemed “troubled kids.” This made for a very diverse student body. West Side High Schools teachers and curriculum were considered to be extremely liberal and experimental by some of the community members who regularly attended planning meetings and had their voices heard. The program was designed by, and operated around, a core group of students and adults. the school was used as a place for students from all over the city who were kicked out of other schools and programs. In addition to the standard course requirements of all New York City public schools, (urban studies, liberal arts and the various sciences) alternative courses in cultural diversity, non-violent coping skills, and modern politics were taught. During the first few years the school was located in on the Upper West Side of Manhattan on West 93rd Street, west of Broadway. Early on, students created programs in which they worked off-site for part of the day at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, PACE College, The New School for Social Research, the Ben Fernandez School of Photography, and other organizations and institutions. The first graduation consisted of just a few students, and took place on the street in front of the West 93rd Street building in June 1975. West Side High School moved to its current address at 140 West 102nd Street in 1981 when the Board of Education lost its lease to the 93rd Street building. The school moved into an old elementary school building at 140 West 102nd Street, which was converted into an Alternative High Schools building for use by West Side, along with two other alternative public high school programs. In the late 1980s, the building, which dated from the late 1800s, was condemned, and the school moved into an office building on West 35th Street and 8th Avenue. After eight long years at the 35th Street site, West Side returned to a new building built by the New York City Department of Education on the same site at 140 West 102nd Street.  Principal  Edward A. Reynolds (known as “Ed” to students and staff) took over as Director in 1975, and served as Director and Principal of West Side High School for more than 25 years, until his sudden death in 2001.

It was located at 2 Cranbourn Street, just off Leicester Square. It opened on 27 June 1893, and was demolished in 1937. The theatre was built for and named after the American impresario Augustin Daly, but he failed to make a success of it, and between 1895 and 1915 the British producer George Edwardes ran the house, where he presented a series of long- running musical comedies, including The Geisha (1896), and English adaptations of operettas, including The Merry Widow (1907). After Edwardes died in 1915 Daly's had one more great hit, The Maid of the Mountains (1917), which ran for 1,352 productions, but after that the fortunes of the theatre declined; Noël Coward's play Sirocco (1927) was a notable failure. By the mid-1930s Leicester Square had become better known for cinemas. Daly's was sold to Warner Brothers who demolished it and erected a large cinema on the site. History Architects' plan of the theatre =Background and early years= In 1884 the American producer Augustin Daly brought his company to London – the first time an entire American company had performed in the West End.\\"The London Theatres\\", The Era, 21 June 1884, p. 6 The company, which included Ada Rehan, Otis Skinner, Mrs G. H. Gilbert and James Lewis, presented a season of comedies, old and new. The season was well received, and Daly brought his company to London again four times between 1885 and 1891.Mander and Mitchenson, 1976, p. 26 They played at the Lyceum, Gaiety and other theatres, but the enthusiasm of the press and public suggested that Daly should have a permanent London base. The London impresario George Edwardes secured a lease of a site owned by Lord Salisbury, bounded by Lisle Street, Ryder's Court and Cranbourne Street, and raised the money – a little under £40,000 – to build a theatre.\\"The Last Night of Daly's Theatre\\", The Times 23 September 1937, p. 8 The architect was Spencer Chadwick, who was assisted by C. J. Phipps. The theatre was one of the first in London to be built using the cantilever system, and the Italian Renaissance and neo-classical facade was more elaborate than that of most London theatres. Likewise, the entrance hall and foyer were elaborately executed and decorated. The auditorium had a seating capacity of over 1,200 in three tiers. The theatre opened with The Taming of the Shrew, starring Rehan as Katharina. This was followed by Sheridan Knowles's The Hunchback, with Violet Vanbrugh, and in 1894 by Twelfth Night and As You Like It.Mander and Mitchenson, 1976, p. 28 After the conclusion of Daly's season the theatre presented the British premiere of Alfred, Lord Tennyson's The Foresters, which was not well received and closed after three weeks.Eden, David and William Parry (2004). Notes to Hyperion CD CDA67486 After this the theatre was occupied by two visiting European companies, those of Eleonora Duse, playing La Dame aux camélias in Italian, and Sarah Bernhardt in a French season.\\"Eleonora Duse in London\\", The Era, 27 May 1893, p. 9; and \\"Daly's Theatre\\", The Morning Post, 19 June 1894, p. 6 In September 1894 Edwardes presented A Gaiety Girl, transferring from the Prince of Wales Theatre, and in December the Carl Rosa Opera Company gave the British premiere of Humperdinck's Hansel and Gretel.\\"The Christmas Novelties\\", The Era, 29 December 1894, p. 6 George Edwardes takes over the running of the theatre from the departing Augustin Daly In February 1985 Edwardes presented another musical comedy, An Artist's Model, which was a considerable success, and had to be transferred to the Lyric Theatre in May to make way for another Bernhardt season at Daly's,\\"French Plays at Daly's Theatre\\", The Standard, 18 June 1895, p. 3 followed by Augustin Daly's next – and as it proved last – season with his company. Daly's comedy The Railroad of Love (an adaptation of a German play) was followed by Shakespeare's Two Gentlemen of Verona.\\"Daly's Theatre\\", The Morning Post, 26 June 1895, p. 5 The latter had not been professionally staged in London since 1841, and despite respectful reviews and a starry cast including Rehan, Lewis, Tyrone Power, Frank Worthing and Maxine Elliott, it did not attract the public.\\"Daly's Theatre\\", The Morning Post, 3 July 1895, p. 5; and \\"The London Theatres\\", The Era, 6 July 1895, p. 7 The production of A Midsummer Night's Dream that followed did better,\\"Daly's Theatre\\", The Standard, 10 July 1895, p. 5 but as the theatre historians Mander and Mitchenson put it, \\"London had not responded to the Americanised classics as Daly had hoped.\\" Although the theatre retained his name for the remaining forty-three years of its existence, his company never returned, and for the next twenty years Daly's Theatre was run by Edwardes. =The Edwardes years= Edwardes, nicknamed \\"the Guv'nor\\", ran Daly's in a lavish manner. He employed an orchestra of 40 players, and about 160 other staff in addition to the principals, supporting actors and chorus.Forbes-Winslow, pp. 34 and 42 The theatre cost him more than £3,000 a week to run. He liked to joke that he made all his money in the provinces, with touring productions of his West End hits.Forbes-Winslow, p. 34 His chorus was celebrated, particularly the female members. In his history of Daly's (1944) D. Forbes-Winslow lists ten future stars who were in the chorus at Daly's at the start of their careers, including Gladys Cooper, Isobel Elsom and Mabel Russell.Forbes-Winslow, p. 42 Of Edwardes's management Forbes-Winslow writes: :A performance at Daly's was a cross section of the era. Here was taste, here was artistry, here was the best of everything. And in Victorian and Edwardian days the best only was good enough. Quality mattered more than quantity. Here, under the selective power of the Guv'nor, were the best artists, the best composers, the best scenery, the best clothes, the prettiest girls, that could be found.Forbes-Winslow, p. 206 The Geisha Edwardes engaged Sidney Jones as the resident composer and musical director, and Daly's became well known for a string of highly successful musical comedies. A second edition of An Artist's Model opened in September 1895 and was followed by The Geisha (1896), which ran for 760 performances, A Greek Slave (1898) and San Toy (1899), which ran for 768 performances. Forbes-Winslow rates Edwardes as a perceptive picker of composers: Jones wrote well-received scores for all four of these shows. In the first decade of the 20th century Edwardes's first new production at Daly's was A Country Girl (1902), with music by Lionel Monckton and Paul Rubens and words by Adrian Ross, Percy Greenbank and James T. Tanner, which ran for 729 performances. The same five contributors wrote The Cingalee (1904), which ran for 365 performances.Wearing, p. 176 In 1905 Edwardes turned to continental Europe for the first time, presenting the British premiere of André Messager's The Little Michus (1905), which ran for 400 performances.Wearing, p. 230 The Merveilleuses (1906), with music by Hugo Felix and words by Basil Hood and Ross had a shorter run (196 performances) but The Merry Widow (1907) by Franz Lehár with English words by Hood and Ross, ran for 778 performances from June 1907 until July 1909. Mander and Michenson comment that it marked the introduction of Viennese operetta to London, albeit adapted into musical comedy. Between the end of the run of The Merry Widow and the First World War Edwardes staged four more new shows, all English adaptations of continental operettas: Leo Fall's The Dollar Princess (1909), Lehár's The Count of Luxembourg (1911), and Gipsy Love (1912) – all with English words by Hood and Ross, and in 1913 Victor Jacobi's The Marriage Market in an adaptation by Gladys Unger, Arthur Anderson and Ross. Edwardes's last show for Daly's was Betty, with music by Rubens and Ernest Steffan and words by Frederick Lonsdale, Unger and Ross. =After Edwardes= The Maid of the Mountains Edwardes died in October 1915. He left £49,780 but also substantial liabilities. The tenor Robert Evett and Edwardes's daughter, Dorothy Sherbrook, became co-directors of Edwardes's company with Evett as managing director. The first production under the new regime was The Happy Day (1916), which ran for 241 performances. The following year the company's finances were put back on a secure footing with the enormous success of The Maid of the Mountains, which ran for 1,352 performances. This show, which introduced José Collins, daughter of Lottie Collins, was an all-British creation, with a book by Lonsdale and music by Harold Fraser-Simpson. It was followed by A Southern Maid (1920) with music by Fraser-Simpson and Ivor Novello, which ran for 306 performances, and then Sybil, by Jacobi and Harry Graham, which had a similar run.\\"New Songs For 'Sybil'\\", The Times, 3 November 1921, p. 8 In 1922 the trustees of the Edwardes estate sold the theatre for £200,000 to James White, a property developer and speculator with ambitions to be an impresario. The Lady of the Rose (Jean Gilbert, 1922), Madame Pompadour (Fall, 1923) and Cleopatra (Oscar Straus, 1925), all starring Evelyn Laye, were well reviewed.\\"The Lady of the Rose,\\" The Times, 22 February 1922, p.10; \\"Madame Pompadour\\", The Times, 21 December 1923, p. 8; and \\"Cleopatra\\", The Times, 3 June 1925, p. 10 In 1927 the theatre's policy of presenting musicals was briefly and disastrously abandoned in favour of Noël Coward's play Sirocco, which according to Mander and Michenson was a failure so abject as to have passed into stage history.Mander and Mitchenson, 1957, p. 28 White, overwhelmed with debts, killed himself in 1927 and the following year the theatre was bought by Isidore W. Schlesinger.The End of Daly's Theatre\\", The Times, 1 July 1937, p. 14 Within a year he had sold on to British Amalgamated Theatres Limited. In 1929 Harry Welchman took over the management of the theatre. Daly's returned to musical comedies but found little further success. Seymour Hicks succeeded Welchman in 1933, and under his management That's a Pretty Thing played in 1933, Charley's Aunt was revived in 1934, and Young England was transferred there in 1935.Mander and Mitchenson, 1976, p. 29 By the mid-1930s Daly's was the last surviving theatre in Leicester Square, which had been taken over by large cinemas. It eventually closed in 1937 after the last performance of The First Legion and was sold to Warner Brothers who demolished it. Warners built a large cinema designed by Thomas Somerford and E. A. Stone with a marble facade sculpted by Bainbridge Copnall, featuring a large relief panel in two corners depicting the spirits of sight and sound. This building was demolished, but the marble frontage was retained, and the site was redeveloped as the Warner Village cinema complex. It changed hands again, and is now (2019) the Vue West End.Vue West End, cinematreasures.

He was born into the dynasty's surviving Sigmaringen branch, which inherited all the dynasty's Swabian lands when the Hohenzollern-Hechingen branch became extinct. Leopold's parents were Josephine of Baden and Karl Anton, Prince of Hohenzollern. Leopold was the older brother of King Carol I of Romania and father of the future King Ferdinand of Romania. Carol ascended the Romanian throne in 1866, and Leopold renounced his rights to the Romanian succession in favor of his sons in 1880.Renunciation letter of Leopold de Hohenzollern, in French, dated 22 November 1880 Entry into European controversy After the Spanish Revolution of 1868 that overthrew Queen Isabella II, Leopold was offered the Spanish Crown by the new government. This offer was supported by the Prussian Prime Minister Otto von Bismarck, but opposed by the French Emperor Napoleon III on the grounds that the installation of a relative of the Prussian king would result in the expansion of Prussian influence and the encirclement of France. Leopold was forced to decline the offer. Additional demands made by the French government heightened diplomatic tensions between Paris and Berlin. The deliberate or accidental mistranslation of a diplomatic communiqué, the Ems Telegram, also known as the Ems Dispatch, led to the declaration of war by France. Prussia's speedy mobilization, together with the support of the other members of the North German Confederation, resulted in French defeat, the consequences of which were: *the capture of Napoleon III and the collapse of his government *the French loss of Alsace and a part of Lorraine *the imposition upon France of huge war reparations (five billion gold francs) to be paid within five years *institution of the French Third Republic *creation of the German Empire. Marriage and issue On 12 September 1861, Leopold married Infanta Antónia of Portugal, daughter of Queen Maria II of Portugal and King Ferdinand II of Portugal. They had the following children: * William, Prince of Hohenzollern (7 March 1864 – 22 October 1927) he married Princess Maria Teresa of Bourbon-Two Sicilies on 27 June 1889. They had three children. He remarried Princess Adelgunde of Bavaria on 20 January 1915. * Prince Ferdinand of Hohenzollern (25 August 1865 – 20 July 1927) he married Princess Marie of Edinburgh on 10 January 1893. They had six children. *Prince Karl Anton of Hohenzollern (1 September 1868 – 21 February 1919) he married Princess Joséphine Caroline of Belgium on 28 May 1894. They had four children. Had Leopold succeeded to the Spanish throne, he could possibly have founded a second German dynasty in Spain, following the extinction of the House of Austria less than two centuries earlier.

It is the newest of three high schools in the Westerville City School District. It opened in the fall of 2003 and is located north of Westerville North High School.  History  Westerville experienced a population boom in the late 1990s, particularly in Genoa Township in the northern part of the school district. In order to keep up with the growth, the district announced that it would build two new elementary schools and a third high school. Westerville was the second Greater Columbus school district to build a third high school. The district asked taxpayers to pay for part for the new buildings. Central cost the district $40 million, but voters turned the district down. Eventually, the district secured the funds and Central opened in August 2003. Students had the opportunity to select the school mascot and colors. The winning nickname was the Warhawks. The colors chosen were Black and Silver. On March 3, 2008, Central hosted President Barack Obama, who was then a candidate in the Democratic Party Presidential primary election. On March 14, 2016, Central housed presidential candidate John Kasich for a local rally the day before Ohio's Republican primary.  The facility  Westerville Central Construction began on Central in 2002. The district hired Firestone Jaros Mullin, Inc./TMP Architecture to execute the project after declaring its proposal the best of those offered. The school features numerous facilities, including seven athletic fields, a 5,000-seat stadium, an 1800-seat gymnasium, and a state-of-the-art 750-seat auditorium/theatre. The school design called for four distinct academic \\"wings\\" for focus on individual subjects. Each \\"academy\\" is marked by color; there are red, yellow, blue, and green wings. Central's centerpiece is its common area, traditionally referred to as Central Avenue. It serves as the school's dining area, is the point that connects all wings of the school, and also is the site for many school functions. It is meant to resemble Westerville's historic business district, Uptown Westerville, with a design that includes storefronts, signs, and lampposts. For its design, the school design earned the designation of \\"2004 Outstanding Design Award\\" from American School and University magazine.  Opening  Central opened its doors to students in the fall of 2003, enrolling only freshmen and sophomores. Central added a third class in the 2004-05 school year and had its first senior class in the 2005-06 school year. The school has approximately 1,600 students. In every year since its opening, the school has earned the designation of \\"Excellent\\" by the Ohio Department of Education on its annual report card, the highest possible distinction. In the spring of 2007, Principal Todd Meyer announced that he would be leaving his position at Central to become the principal at Olentangy Orange High School, a new high school in the Olentangy Local School District set to open in 2008. Todd Spinner was chosen to be the new principal after an extensive search. Spinner had been the assistant principal at Delaware Hayes High School. After ten years at Central (2017), Spinner announced he would be leaving the school to become the principal at Olentangy Berlin High School, the newest high school in the Olentangy Local School District. Thomas Lanier was chosen to be the newest principal of Westerville Central starting in the 2017/18 school year after previously being an assistant at Pickerington High School North.

Although designated a light tank by the Italian Army, its turretless configuration, weight and firepower make it closer to contemporary tankettes. It was the most numerous Italian armoured fighting vehicle and saw service almost everywhere the Italians fought in World War II but proved inadequate for modern warfare, having too thin armour and weak armament of only machine guns. Development The L3/35 was developed from the Carden Loyd Mark VI tankette, four of which were imported from Britain in 1929. The first vehicle developed by the Italians from the Carden Lloyd tankette was designated CV-29; \\"CV\\" being an abbreviation of Carro Veloce (Italian: \\"fast tank\\") and \\"29\\" as the year of adoption. Only twenty-one CV-29s were built. =L3/33= In 1933, a new design was built jointly by the Fiat Company of Turin and the Ansaldo Company of Genoa. This vehicle was introduced as the Fiat-Ansaldo CV-33. About 300 CV-33s were built. =L3/35= In 1935, a slightly improved model of the CV-33 was introduced and designated CV-35. The primary differences were that the armour was bolted rather than riveted and the single 6.5 mm machine gun was replaced with twin 8 mm machine guns. Many older CV-33s were retrofitted to meet the specifications of the CV-35. In 1938, the vehicles were redesignated L3/33 (\\"L\\" for Leggero or 'light') and the L3/35. Military Museum, Belgrade. =L3/38= In 1938, a further development of the L3 design was designated L3/38. The L3/38 had torsion bar suspension and two versions of a single mounted 13.2 mm machine gun. Italy retrofitted at least 12 L3/35s to meet the specifications of the L3/38. The converted L3/35s with the L3/38's torsion bar suspension saw limited service in September 1943 until June 1944. These L3/38s versions of the L3/35s were armed with a single 13.2 mm Breda M31 machine gun. =Layout= The L3/35 was a lightly armoured two-man vehicle typically armed with twin 8 mm machine guns, though variants were developed with other armament. Other than the number and type of machine guns, the differences between the L3/35 and the L3/33 were few. Both featured riveted and welded construction. The vehicle's commander/gunner sat on the left and the driver sat on the right. The engine was mounted transverselyItaly's L3/33 (CV 33) and L3/35 (CV 35) tankettes wwiivehicles.com in the rear. A circular radiator was mounted behind the engine. The transmission went to the front to the final drive. The Vickers-Carden-Lloyd type suspension had two three-wheel bogies on leaf spring and a single unsprung wheel on each side. There was an acacia wood rail that the top run of the tracks went on. Production and sales Between 2,000 and 2,500 L3 tankettes were built in different models and variants for the Royal Italian Army (Regio Esercito) and for other users. Twenty L3/33 tankettes were sold to China. Other L3 tankettes were sold to Afghanistan (unknown number), Albania (unknown number), Austria (72), Bolivia (14), Brazil (23), Bulgaria (14), Croatia (10), Hungary (65), Iraq (16), Nationalist Spain, and Venezuela (2). Many foreign buyers substituted other machine guns as the main armament. The Hungarians added a raised commander's vision cupola to 45 of the L3s they acquired. In 1937, the Brazilian Army ordered 18 L3/35 tankettes, designated Auto Metralhadora de Reconhecimento which remained in active service until 1945 when some units were resold to the Dominican Republic. Venezuela bought two units in 1934 for evaluation in infantry support operations, because of several incidents on the border with Colombia, like other weapons acquired from the Italian mission they did not survive past World War II. Combat history Italian L3/35 in the Balkans, August 1943. Italian L3/35 in Albania, September 1943. Close-up of Italian L3/35 in the Balkans, August 1943. In addition to seeing action in the Second Italo- Abyssinian War, the Second Sino-Japanese War, the Spanish Civil War, the Slovak-Hungarian War, and the Anglo-Iraqi War, the L3 was used almost everywhere that Italian troops fought during World War II. L3s were found on the Italian/French border, North Africa, Italian East Africa, the Balkans, USSR, Sicily, and Italy. The combat performance of the L3s during the interwar period was poor. On at least two occasions during the Italian invasion of Ethiopia, L3s were put out of action by massed infantry attacks. In the Spanish Civil War, L3s of the Corps of Volunteer Troops (Corpo Truppe Volontarie, or CTV) were totally out-classed by the T-26 and BT-5 tanks provided to the Republican forces by the Soviet Union. The L3s were not a factor in the brief war between the Hungarians and Slovakia. On 10 June 1940, when Italy entered World War II, the Royal Italian Army (Regio Esercito) possessed only about one-hundred M11/39 medium tanks in two tank battalions. L3 tankettes still equipped all three Italian armoured divisions, the tank battalions in the motorized divisions, the light tank squadron group in each \\"Fast\\" (Celere) division, and numerous independent tank battalions. On 22 March 1941, two Iraqi L3s were reported to have been put out of action near Fallujah during the Anglo-Iraqi War. More than 40 captured L3 tankettes were used by the Greek Army during the Greco-Italian War, fought from 1940 to 1941, and were used to equip the 19th Mechanized Division, although they did not take part in combat with the latter. After the invasion of Yugoslavia and Greece in April 1941, L3 tankettes were also captured by the Yugoslav and Greek resistance forces. From 1941, some L3 tankettes were given to the German puppet government of the Independent State of Croatia (Nezavisna Država Hrvatska, or NDH). Though numerous, Italy's tankettes proved to be outclassed from the start and also proved to be of low tactical value. They were vulnerable to the British Boys anti-tank rifles.Pignato 2004,p. 8 Other than those used for occupation duties in the Balkans and elsewhere, few L3s remained in front line service past the end of 1940. After the Italian armistice with the Allies in 1943, L3 tankettes were used by German Army forces and by the pro-Nazi National Republican Army of the Italian Social Republic. Hungarian L3s had by this point been issued to the Gendarmerie and 10 saw combat in Budapest and were destroyed in the fighting to reclaim the Racecourse Airfield.Grey Wolf, Battlefront Miniatures,2011 L3/35s also joined the Chinese Nationalist Army and fought against the Japanese Imperial Army during the Second Sino-Japanese War. Variants Bardia in 1941. Italian tankettes advancing with a L3 Lf flame thrower tank in the lead at the Battle of Guadalajara. The L3/35 appeared in several variants including an anti-tank variant and a flame thrower variant. =L3 cc anti-tank= The \\"L3 cc\\" anti- tank (controcarro) was an L3 with a Solothurn 20 mm anti-tank rifle mounted in place of its normal machine gun armament. Only a few were so modified, and they saw action only in North Africa. The Solothurn rifle could penetrate up to 18 mm of armor at 300 m (328 yards) which was effective against lightly armoured vehicles.Pignato 2004,p. 18 Development of the \\"L3 Lf\\" flamethrower (lancia fiamme) flame tank began in 1935. The flamethrower nozzle replaced one of the machine guns, and the flame fuel was carried in an armoured 500-litre (133 US gallons) fuel trailer towed by the vehicle. Later versions carried another 60 litres of fuel in a box-shaped tank mounted above the L3's engine compartment. The vehicle weighed 5 metric tons. The L3 Lf saw action in Abyssinia, Spain, France, the Balkans, North Africa, and Italian East Africa. From 1936 each CV/L3 company had a single L3 Lf platoon.Pignato 2004,p. 8-9 =L3 Centro Radio command tank= The basic L3 platform was also employed as a command vehicle using the Marelli RF1 CA radio in platoon and company command vehicles. The L3 was considered too small to be effectively employed as a regimental level command radio vehicle so this task fell to the later and slightly larger L6/40 CR (Centro Radio = Radio Center). =L3 Passerella bridge layer= The few L3 Passerella (bridge layer) vehicles constructed were assigned to units at Armoured Brigade levels. The bridge was stripped down into sections on a trailer towed by the L3 itself for travel. On arriving at the combat zone, this bridge was assembled on the front of the tank, suspended by cables from two small cranes located over the crew's superstructure. The crew laid the completed bridge over the obstacle from within the vehicle. A L3 Passerella crew took seven minutes to lay out this bridge.Pignato 2004, p. 12. =Planned variants= A single Savoia-Marchetti SM.82 aircraft was modified to carry a L3/33 recessed under the fuselage for experiments with airborne armour.

Did not enter serial production. Aborted Spanish upgrade On 8 August 1937, Major General García Pallasar had received a note from Generalísimo Francisco Franco which expressed the need for a Panzer I armed with a 20 mm gun. Although originally forty Italian L3/35 tankettes were ordered with the original armament exchanged for the 20 mm Breda Model 35 instead, this order was subsequently cancelled after it was thought that the adaptation of the same gun to the German Panzer I would yield better results.Franco, Panzer I, pp. 47-49 Users *: some later modified with Soviet KPV machine guns * Austria: 36 CV-35s of the first batch of production, delivered in March 1937. *: 18 armed with twin-Madsen machine guns and 5 armed with a 13.2 Breda heavy machine gun.

The agreement reduces rates of duty, and in some case eliminates all duties, on merchandise exported from Israel to the United States. The agreement also covers merchandise exported from the Gaza Strip and the West Bank. The U.S.–Israel FTA was the first such free trade agreement entered into by the United States. It is the only FTA the United States has signed that does not include a chapter on intellectual property rights, which have become a staple of all subsequent U.S. trade treaties.  History  Negotiations for the pact began January 1, 1984, and concluded February 1, 1985. The pact was signed on April 22, 1985. Implementing legislation was introduced into the U.S. Congress on April 29 by Rep. James C. Wright, Jr. (D–Texas). This legislation was approved by the U.S. House of Representatives on May 7 by a 422–0 vote, and by the U.S. Senate on May 23 by a voice vote. The pact was signed into law by President Ronald Reagan on June 11, and implemented on September 1. On January 1, 1995, all products produced in Israel that were eligible for reduced duty under the agreement became duty-free.  Israel-United States bilateral economic relationship  The FTA between Israel and the United States was signed to set an example to the rest of the world to move forward with trade liberalization. The United States goals were to create bilateral economic relations with Israel beyond military support, reduce Israel dependence on US assistance, and strengthen the Israeli economy. Israel’s goals of the FTA were to secure a large trading market outside of the Arab boycotting region due to political conflicts, build trade with higher income countries to reduce debt, and to strengthen ties between the United States beyond economic means. Under the bilateral economic relationship, the United States is Israel’s largest trading partner and Israel is the United States 24th largest trading partner. With an $8 billion U.S. goods trade deficit in 2014, the United States total goods imported were $23 billion and total goods exported were $15 billion. The top United States-Israel imports and exports are precious stones/diamonds, machinery, pharmaceutical products, medical investments, and agriculture products. United States leading imports from Israel in 2014 were $9.4 billion in diamonds and $4.6 billion in pharmaceuticals. Machinery, electric machinery, and optic/medical instruments imports were all around $1.5 billion in 2014.

The body is 'hairy' and yellow. The thorax has blue-green lines on its uppersides. Adults are attracted to decaying plants with pyrrolizidine alkaloids. They regurgitate on them, then drink the fluids, and acquire defensive chemicals.

Formerly known as Hispanic Broadcasting Corporation and Univision Radio, it is the eighth-largest radio broadcaster in the United States, and the largest specifically catering to Hispanic and Latino Americans. The company is headquartered in Los Angeles. History Univision, previously known as Hispanic Broadcasting Corp. (between 2000 and September 22, 2003) and Heftel Broadcasting Corp, was the result of a February 14, 1997 merger of Tichenor Media System, Inc. a private company based in Dallas, Texas and Heftel Broadcasting, a public company based in Las Vegas, Nevada. Tichenor had been in broadcasting since the 1940s. McHenry Tichenor operated a station (KGBS on 1240, later KGBT on 1530) in Harlingen, Texas. In 1950, they added KUNO Corpus Christi, Texas. Later station purchases were KIFN in Phoenix, Arizona; WGMA in Hollywood, Florida; & WACO-AM-FM and TV (construction permit) in Waco, Texas. In 1975, the company (then known as Harbenito radio) added KCOR (AM) and KQXT (FM) in San Antonio. In 1981, the grandson of the founder, McHenry T. Tichenor, Jr., was named president of the company. He began focusing on its Spanish Language stations; Waco, Hollywood, and Phoenix were sold to their local managers. In 1987 Tichenor bought WOJO, a Spanish-language FM station serving Chicago. In 1984, the company sold KQXT in San Antonio to Westinghouse's Group W Broadcasting and purchased KLAT (AM) in Houston, Texas from Marcos Rodriguez, Sr. and Marcos A. Rodriguez. The KLAT purchase gave Tichenor access to top Spanish Radio talents Chuck Brooks, Ricardo del Castillo (who later became COO, retired and has since passed) and Gary Stone (former President of Univision Radio-retired). In 1985, WIND, Chicago and KYSR AM-FM El Paso were purchased. More stations were purchased in the following years, and the home office moved from Harlingen to Dallas, Texas. Mac Tichenor, Jr.'s brother, Warren (who would later serve as U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations), became general manager of the San Antonio stations in 1991. Univision Radio's logo used until 2013 Heftel Broadcasting was founded by Cecil Heftel, whose family and in-laws all had been in the broadcasting business. His Heftel Broadcasting in the 1950s and early 1960s was anchored by KIMN in Denver and KGMB AM and KGMB-TV in Honolulu. He added numerous large AM radio stations (KTNQ) and some promising FM stations (KLVE) before selling them in the seventies and eighties. Cecil Heftel was elected as a congressman representing Hawaii's first district in 1976; he would hold that office eleven years before resigning in 1987. During this time, his company was active, buying and selling stations in places like Indianapolis and Chicago. For about a year, Heftel and Scott Ginsburg (Statewide Communications) merged their holdings into H & G Communications. In the early 90s, Heftel began to expand into more Spanish stations, and took steps to go public (new executive Carl Parmer). Heftel had a knack for making coalitions work, at least for a time, as in the H & G attempt. Heftel set up shop in Miami with local stations WAQI and WRTO, taking a minority interest. Heftel set up Rodriguez-Heftel Texas broadcasting along with Marcos A. Rodriguez (owner of KESS and other Dallas area stations and son of Marcos Rodriguez, Sr.). Stations were purchased outright in Los Angeles, Chicago, Las Vegas, and New York. When HBC went public, Clear Channel Communications invested, taking in several steps up to a 20% interest. In 1996 Clear Channel tendered the shares owned by Heftel management. This got them about 62% of the company. They struck a deal to merge the new company with Tichenor Media, to be run by the Tichenor management. The deal closed in early 1997, and made for the first national Spanish Language broadcasting company. The new company was worth $1 billion at closing and owned 38 stations. Holding were expanded for the next several years. San Francisco was added in 1996. Phoenix was added in 1999. Fresno in 2000. Besides buying stations, the company has developed a capacity for improving and expanding stations to enhance coverage. VP of Engineering Mark Stennett oversees this effort (begun under previous VP David Stewart now with Moving Target Consulting Works) along with Charles Staples of Staples Technical Services, Dallas, Texas. For example, 104.9 KAMA-FM (was KPTY) in the Houston, Texas area moved from a smaller class A at Rosenberg, Texas to a larger class C3 licensed to Missouri City, Texas. Coverage went from a few hundred thousand to millions. Rating and value increased proportionally. (Note a construction permit for increase to class C2 was granted (BPH-20070914ACP) June 25, 2008. This will allow an increase from 2,700 watts to 8,700 watts. The station will also move from a downtown building roof to the company owned KLTN tower. May 2013: KAMA-FM has increased power to 10.5 kW. Other expanded and relocated stations include KFLC, KESS-FM and KDXX (FM) in the Dallas-Ft. Worth area, KBBT and KGSX in the San Antonio area, KLQV San Diego, and WADO (AM) New York. KKMR in the Phoenix, AZ area was recently granted a CP to change from class A to class C3, at a new site that will allow a 10 fold increase in its population covered. This app was started nearly a decade ago and was granted based on tweaks in the application done in 2006.KMMR License Application information-Federal Communications Commission Former CFO Jeff Hinson observed once that the station upgrade activity had increased the company's enterprise value by \\"almost $1 billion\\" (at a point when the company was selling to UVN for 3.5B). In 1999, the company created a new entity, HBCI, Inc which was its interactive online presence. HBCi created a network of bilingual radio station web sites and a network of bilingual local city guide sites focused on the local Hispanic consumer in each of the markets the radio stations operated. HBCI achieved the rare milestone of reaching profitability in the dotcom industry just prior to the merger with Univision. The company traded on the NASDAQ exchange under the symbol HBCCA. It moved to the New York Stock Exchange in May 2000. Stock traded as HSP. In mid-2002, Univision and HBC voted to merge. The approval process was long and controversial. The deal was approved and closed on September 22, 2003. After the merger of HBC and Univision, the division was renamed Univision Radio and Denver Colorado. Univision Radio's logo used from 2013 until March 2019 In 2013, Univision launched Uforia, a new streaming platform featuring the Univision Radio stations and other exclusive content relating to Latino music. On March 5, 2019, Univision announced that it would re-launch the Uforia brand (with the new tagline \\"The Home of Latin Music\\"), and that the Univision Radio group had been officially renamed Uforia Audio Network. There are also plans to use the Uforia brand more extensively across platforms, including live events, as well as television programming. Some of the syndicated shows in the Uforia Audio Network include \\"El Show De Raul Brindis\\", “El Bueno, La Mala y El Feo” (“The Good, The Bad and The Ugly”), \\"El Show de Omar y Argelia”, \\"El Frey Guey Show\\", \\"La Chula Y La Bestia' “El Hit Parade de América con Javier Romero”, \\"Todo Deportes con Broderick Zerpa\\", and “Intimo con Alberto Sardiñas”.

It has archaeological significance. It is 40 km away from Bilaspur by road. Oldest Vishnu The oldest known sculpture of Vishnu with four-arm figure holding shankha, chakra and gada dated to c. 200 BCE was found in Malhar, Chhattisgarh.  Legends  In ancient Indian literature as well as the epic Ramayana, Mahabharata and Puranas there are many references to the ancient Kosala Kingdom of northern India. Surya Vanshi Ikshvaku dynasty kings ruled Kosala with Ayodhya as their capital. Sri Ramachandra was a king of that clan, based on whose character and activities, the Ramayana was written. This work mentions that after Rama, the kingdom was divided among his two sons, Lava and Kusha. North Kosala went to Lava as his share with Shravasti Nagari as his capital while Kusha received South Kosala. He established his new capital, Kushasthalipura on the riverKushavrate near the Vindhya mountain range, which divides north and south India. Kushasthalipura is identified as near Malhar in the present-day Bilaspur district of Chhattisgarh state. As part of his military campaigns, Sahadeva targeted the kingdoms in the regions south of the Indo-Gangetic Plain. Vanquishing the invincible Bhismaka, Sahadeva then defeated the king of Kosala in battle and the ruler of the territories lying on the banks of the Venwa, as well as the Kantarakas and the kings of the eastern Kosalas.Mahabharata, Book 2, Chapter 30 Archaeological Sites In Malhar, many ancient temples have been found, such as the Pataleshwar temple, the Devri temple & the Dindeshwari temple. Ancient deposits and Jain memorials were also found here. The four handed idol of Vishnu is significant. The remains found here are of the period from approximately 1000 BCE to the Ratnapura Kalachuri regime. Temples of the 10th and 11th centuries are also conspicuous. Among them, the Pataleshwar Kedar temple is one, where the Gomukhi Shivling is the main attraction. The Dindeshwari temple of the Kalachuri regime is also significant.

From the Potomac River near Knoxville, Maryland, in the south, to Dillsburg, Pennsylvania, in the north, the range separates the Hagerstown and Cumberland valleys from the Piedmont regions of the two states. The Appalachian National Scenic Trail follows the crest of the mountain through Maryland and a portion of Pennsylvania. Geography South Mountain begins at the Potomac River as a low, narrow ridge, barely one mile wide and only above sea level at its crest. South of the Potomac River in Virginia, the ridge continues as Short Hill Mountain for about before subsiding near the town of Hillsboro. South Mountain in Maryland gradually grows higher and wider towards the north. Near the Pennsylvania border, the mountain merges with the hills of the parallel Catoctin Mountain range to the east and becomes more like a low mountain range than a single crest. North of U.S. Route 30 in Pennsylvania, the South Mountain highlands reach their greatest width, over , and several summits top .

The initiative is organized as South Mountain Partnership, which involves other organizations, government, business, and community members. History The history of South Mountain defines the early history of western Maryland. It was viewed as a boundary to the Susquehannock in their original treaty granting land to Maryland. In a 1732 letter to the colonial governor of Maryland, Captain Civility (Togotolisa) chief of Conestoga warns against settlement in the valley beyond the mountain.Archives of Maryland, Vol 28, pages 10 & 11 The first Euromerican land grant west of South Mountain by Maryland was William Park's \\"Park Hall\\" in 1731 near Crampton's gap.MSA S1203-1697 (Maryland State Archives) The earliest route of the Great Wagon Road crossed South Mountain by Fox's Gap on a course between Middletown and Sharpsburg. Other important passes for migration and settlement were Turner's Gap near Boonsboro. Orr's Gap, used today by Interstate 70, and the course of \\"Cartledge's Old Road\\" generally following Maryland state route 77. Maryland finally gained clear title to the lands west of South Mountain at the 1744 Treaty of Lancaster. Following the 1859 John Brown's Raid on Harpers Ferry seven of the raiders escaped from the Kennedy Farm headquarters to Pennsylvania by following (Elk ridge and) South Mountain north. The escapees traveled by night and spent the days in cold camps among the densest thickets they could find along the remote ridge top. They finally left the mountain near today's Caledonia State Park between Chambersburg and Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. The Battle of South Mountain was fought on the mountain at Crampton's, Fox and Turner's gaps during the Maryland Campaign of the American Civil War in 1862. In 1863, military engagements of the Gettysburg Campaign on the mountain range included the Fight at Monterey Pass near the Mason–Dixon Line.

It is located south-east of Benevento in the Valle Caudina at the foot of Monte Taburno. The commune was granted the official status of City (Città) by a presidential decree of 31 July 1977.Statuto del Comune, articolo 3 History =Ancient era= Montesarchio is the site of ancient Caudium, an ancient city of Apulia et Calabria, situated on the road from Beneventum (modern Benevento) to Capua. It seems probable that it was in early times a place of importance, and the capital or chief city of the tribe called the Caudini; but it bears only a secondary place in history. It is first mentioned during the Second Samnite War, 321 BCE, when the Samnite army under Gaius Pontius encamped there, previous to the great disaster of the Romans in the neighbouring pass known as the Caudine Forks;Livy ix. 2) and again, a few years later, as the headquarters occupied by the Samnites, with a view of being at hand to watch the movements of the Campanians.Id. ix. 27.) The town of Caudium is not mentioned during the Second Punic War, though the tribe of the Caudini is repeatedly alluded to. A view of Montesarchio Niebuhr supposes the city to have been destroyed by the Romans, in revenge for their great defeat in its neighbourhood; but there is no evidence for this. It reappears at a later period as a small town situated on the Appian Way, and apparently deriving its chief importance from the transit of travellers:Hor. Sat. i. 5. 51; Strabo v. p. 249 the same causes preserved it in existence down to the close of the Roman Empire.Ptol. iii. 1. § 67; Itin. Ant. p. 111; Itin. Hier. p. 610; Tab. Peut. It received a colony of veterans; and it appears from Pliny, as well as from inscriptions, that it retained its municipal character, though deprived of a large portion of its territory in favor of the neighboring city of Beneventum.Plin. iii. 11. s. 16; Lib. Colon. p. 232; Orelli, Inscr. 128, 131. The period of its destruction is unknown: the name is still found in the 9th century, but it is uncertain whether the town still existed at that time. The position of Caudium is fixed by the Itineraries, which all concur in placing it on the Appian Way, 21 Roman miles from Capua, and 11 from Beneventum. =Middle Ages and contemporary era= After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, in the 7th century a Lombard nobleman called Arcolo founded a shelter and fought against Charlemagne. In that occasion the town was fortified and a tower, still visible today, was built at the summit of the hill. Later the castle was rebuilt, but the Normans destroyed it. The Castello di Montesarchio was again rebuilt in the 15th century. Feudatories who held Montesarchio include, starting from the 13th century, D'Aquino, Della Leonessa, Caracciolo, Carafa and D'Avalos, who owned it until the abolition of feudality in 1805.

A subclinical infection — sometimes called a preinfection or inapparent infection — is an infection that, being subclinical, is nearly or completely asymptomatic (no signs or symptoms). A subclinically infected person is thus an asymptomatic carrier of a microbe, intestinal parasite, or virus that usually is a pathogen causing illness, at least in some individuals. Many pathogens spread by being silently carried in this way by some of their host population. Such infections occur both in humans and nonhuman animals. An example of an asymptomatic infection is a mild common cold that is not noticed by the infected individual. Since subclinical infections often occur without eventual overt sign, their existence is only identified by microbiological culture or DNA techniques such as polymerase chain reaction. Infection transmission/signs An individual may only develop signs of an infection after a period of subclinical infection, a duration that is called the incubation period. This is the case, for example, for subclinical sexually transmitted diseases such as AIDS and genital warts. It is thought that individuals with such subclinical infections, and those that never develop overt illness, creates a reserve of individuals that can transmit an infectious agent to infect other individuals. Because such cases of infections do not come to clinical attention, health statistics can often fail to measure the true prevalence of an infection in a population, and this prevents the accurate modeling of its infectious transmission. Types of subclinical infections The following pathogens (together with their symptomatic illnesses) are known to be carried asymptomatically, often in a large percentage of the potential host population: * Baylisascaris procyonis * Bordetella pertussis (Pertussis or whooping cough) * Chlamydia pneumoniae * Chlamydia trachomatis (Chlamydia) * Clostridium difficile * Cyclospora cayetanensis * Dengue virus * Dientamoeba fragilis * Entamoeba histolytica * enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli * Epstein- Barr virus * Group A streptococcal infection * Helicobacter pylori * Herpes simplex (oral herpes, genital herpes, etc.) * HIV-1 (AIDS) * Influenza (strains) * Legionella pneumophila (Legionnaires' disease) * measles viruses * Mycobacterium leprae (leprosy) * Mycobacterium tuberculosis (tuberculosis) * Neisseria gonorrhoeae (gonorrhoea) * Neisseria meningitidis (Meningitis) * nontyphoidal Salmonella * noroviruses * Poliovirus (Poliomyelitis) * Plasmodium (Malaria) * Rabies lyssavirus (Rabies) * rhinoviruses (Common cold) * Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (Typhoid fever) * SARS-COV-2 (COVID-19) and other coronaviruses * Staphylococcus aureus * Streptococcus pneumoniae (Bacterial pneumonia) * Treponema pallidum (syphilis) Host tolerance Fever and sickness behavior and other signs of infection are often taken to be due to them. However, they are evolved physiological and behavioral responses of the host to clear itself of the infection. Instead of incurring the costs of deploying these evolved responses to infections, the body opts to tolerate an infection as an alternative to seeking to control or remove the infecting pathogen. Subclinical infections are important since they allow infections to spread from a reserve of carriers. They also can cause clinical problems unrelated to the direct issue of infection. For example, in the case of urinary tract infections in women, this infection may cause preterm delivery if the person becomes pregnant without proper treatment.

Early life Tseveen was born in the Aginsk district of Transbaikalia in 1880. He went to school in Chita and later to Badmaev's Buryat private school in St. Petersburg. From 1898 to 1902, he attended the Teacher's seminary in Irkutsk, where he began to visit neighbouring Buryat clans and to collect epics and materials related to shamanism, and Mongol law. Scientific career In 1902 he and his friend Baradin returned to St. Petersburg and became auditors at the St. Petersburg University. A professor arranged for them to travel to Buryatia in 1903 to collect more material. Tseveen went to the northwest Baikal area and Olkhon island, and his work proved successful enough to earn him more research trips over the next years, sponsored by the Russian Committee for the Investigation of Central and Eastern Asia. In 1904 he travelled to Urga and home to Aginsk, in 1905 and 1906 he again travelled to Transbaikalia and Outer Mongolia. From 1907 to 1908 he taught Mongolian at the St. Petersburg University's Faculty of Oriental Languages. In 1909 and 1910 travelled to Inner Mongolia and the Ordos area. In 1911, he travelled to the Tungus at the upper Onon river, and in 1912 he took part in archeological studies at Erdene Zuu, the former site of Karakorum. In the Bogd Khaanate Mongolia  After Mongolia had declared independence in 1911, Russia had sent a special envoy to Urga, Ivan Yakovlevich Korostovets. Korostovets planned the creation of a newspaper and the establishment of a secular school under Russian sponsorship, and offered Tseveen to edit the newspaper and supervise the school, both of which Tseveen accepted. In the following years, besides the work at school and the Shine toli ('New Mirror') and Niislel Khüreenii sonin bichig newspapers, he continued academic work and also translated some popular texts into Mongolian. In the Mongolian People's Republic  After Outer Mongolia had been occupied by Chinese troops in 1919, Tseveen became a professor at the Irkutsk University. He published articles on Mongolian law, but also travelled around Verkhneudinsk, Kyakhta and Maimaichen, where he met with discontented Outer Mongolians. At the founding congress of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party in 1921, Tseveen got the task of writing the Ten Aspirations, the party's platform. After Urga had been liberated from Baron Ungern's troops in the same year, Tseveen founded the Institute of Scriptures and Manuscripts (Sudar Bichgiyn Hüreelen), forerunner of the Mongolian Academy of Sciences. A library was established, and in 1924 a museum was opened. In 1925 he travelled to Leningrad, and in 1926 he married Badmajab Tsedenovna, who was also a Buryat from Aginsk. In the same year, both travelled to Beiping. His wife travelled to Germany and France in 1927 as part of an official mission, but Tseveen remained in Ulaanbaatar. Exile and death In 1932, Tseveen was dismissed and exiled to Leningrad, where he again worked at the Institute of Oriental Studies of the University under Prof. Nicholas Poppe and edited the milestone Mongol chronicles of the XVIIth century. He was arrested in 1937, convicted to five years imprisonment on February 19, 1940, and died on May 14, 1942 in Sol-Iletsk prison (Orenburg). Details were released by the Russian government in 1993. Trivia One of his many interests was research into cryptozoological organisms like the Yeti or the Mongolian Death Worm.

It enrolls around 2,600 students. Smoky Hill is part of the Cherry Creek School District and was the second high school built by the district in 1974. It goes by the short name 'Smoky'. The name comes from the fact that the school is located not far from the Smoky Hill Trail, an old pioneer trail stretching from Kansas to Denver. Curriculum In 1991, Smoky Hill became the second high school in Colorado to offer the International Baccalaureate Program. Since that time Smoky has been recognized in Newsweeks nationwide list of excellent high schools. In 2006, Smoky Hill's AVID program was the only school in the AVID Western Division to be recognized as a National Demonstration School with Distinction. Smoky Hill also supports the Advanced Placement program and offers nineteen AP classes. Renovations In the summer of 2010, the Cherry Creek School District began renovations to improve the overall functionality of the building. The windows were enlarged, the pool area was completely reconstructed, new carpet was installed, and the general aesthetics of the school were modernized to comply with more current styles in design. All renovations were completed before the 2010–2011 year, except for the pool area, which was completed during the first quarter of the school year. Athletics Smoky Hill High School is part of the eight-team Centennial League that also includes Cherry Creek, Grandview, Arapahoe, Cherokee Trail, Eaglecrest, Mullen, and Overland high schools. =Track and field= In 1992, Smoky Hill won its first state championship in any sport. They also had a three-time state championship run during 2003–2005. International Baccalaureate In 1991, Smoky Hill became the second International Baccalaureate Diploma School established in the state of Colorado.

It is native to southern Africa, and is found in localities such as Namaqualand with hot and dry summers, being dormant in summer and growing during winter.http://www.alpinegardensociety.net/plants/plant- portraits/Massonia+pustulata+plant+of+the+month+Dec+/100/ The genus Whiteheadia has been merged into Massonia.Müller-Doblies, U. & Müller-Doblies, D. (1997). A partial revision of the tribe Massonieae (Hyacinthaceae) 1. Survey, including three novelties from Namibia: a new genus, a second species in the monotypic Whiteheadia, and a new combination in Massonia. Feddes Repertorium 108: 49-96. It is classed as a cryptophyte. Description Massonia grows from underground bulbs whose outer tunic is pale brown and papery or leathery. Two relatively broad leaves appear at the same time as the flowers, spreading out on either side, sometimes lying flat on the ground. The flowers are borne in a raceme, which may be short and held at ground level. There may be a \\"tuft\\" of green bracts at the top of the inflorescence. Individual flowers are pale in colour, white, or with green, yellow or pink tones. They are bell-shaped or somewhat tubular, with the tepals joined at the base forming a short or long tube. The stamens are more-or-less erect, with their filaments joined to the end of the tube formed by the tepals and also to each other, forming a small cup. The seeds are dull black. The species Massonia depressa has been shown to be pollinated by rodents, including two species of gerbil (Gerbillurus paeba and Desmodillus auricularis). Very few species of plant are rodent-pollinated. Systematics The genus name was attributed to Carl Peter Thunberg by Maarten Houttuyn in 1780. It honours the Scottish botanist and gardener Francis Masson. A molecular phylogenetic study showed Massonia to be monophyletic, but also that the two species of the genus Whiteheadia were placed separately at the base of the Massonia clade, rendering Whiteheadia paraphyletic. Accordingly, Manning et al. transferred W. bifolia and W. etesionamibensis to Massonia. Massonia is the type genus of the subtribe Massoniinae which is placed in the tribe Hyacintheae (or the tribe Massonieae in the subfamily Hyacinthoideae for those who accept the family Hyacinthaceae). It is most closely related to the genus Lachenalia. =Species= , the World Checklist of Selected Plant Families recognized 25 species:Search for \\"Massonia\\", # Massonia amoena Mart.-Azorín # Massonia angustifolia L.f. # Massonia bakeriana M.Pinter # Massonia clavata Baker # Massonia citrina M.Pinter # Massonia dentata Mart.-Azorín # Massonia depressa Houtt. # Massonia echinata L.f. # Massonia hirsuta Link & Otto # Massonia jasminiflora Burch. ex Baker # Massonia latebrosa Masson ex Baker # Massonia longipes Baker # Massonia mimetica Mart.-Azorín # Massonia obermeyerae Mart.-Azorín # Massonia pseudoechinata Mart.-Azorín # Massonia pustulata Jacq. # Massonia pygmaea Schltdl. ex Kunth # Massonia roggeveldensis Mart.-Azorín # Massonia saniensis Wetschnig # Massonia sempervirens U.Müll.-Doblies # Massonia sessiliflora (Dinter) Mart.-Azorín # Massonia setulosa Baker # Massonia tenella Sol. ex Baker # Massonia thunbergiana Wetschnig # Massonia wittebergensis U.Müll.-Doblies & D.Müll.-Doblies Cultivation Massonia species have been described as \\"essentially plants for the collector\\".

In September 2002, it was released with \\"Little by Little\\" as the first double A-sided single by the band, peaking at number two on the UK Singles Chart (see 2002 in British music). The song was written about Noel Gallagher's girlfriend Sara McDonald and is a light, acoustic song about being in love. Gallagher claims it was written in the Buckingham Gate Hotel in London, and that it took 30 minutes to complete. The band commissioned British fashion art director Rachel Thomas to make a promo video for the song. However, the resulting film, a mix of animation and live action, has never been released on any format. This track is also included on the compilation album Time Flies... 1994–2009.

The G-10 gun camera port above the nose of a Hawker Hunter F.74S Gun cameras are cameras used primarily in aircraft to help measure tactical effectiveness. These cameras are triggered by the firing of a weapon, hence the name. The use of gun cameras first became common for gunnery training in the 1920s though examples were used during World War I by the British Royal Flying Corps. A special version of the standard Lewis machine gun was manufactured as a camera gun. During World War II, as the Luftwaffe did with the German Robot II camera, gun cameras were commonly used on operational aircraft to record kills of enemy aircraft. Some of this footage survives to this day and is often the source for stock footage in World War II movies, TV shows or video games. The term guncam may also refer to software that records video game footage, it is often triggered by the firing of a weapon in a way similar to the original guncams of World War II. Some popular examples of this software are Growler Guncam and Java Guncam. A \\"Gun camera\\" may also refer to a video camera mounted on a gun where the camera has a point of aim indicator, typically a reticle in the form of a crosshair or a red dot, that shows in the video where the gun is being pointed. Current gun cameras on hand guns are usually located at the top of the barrel, limiting the officers view. Police officers have changed the design where it is located on the bottom of the barrel but also are attempting to make a gun camera start video taping when an officer draws his or her weapon.

He was a Conservative and served as Member of Parliament for Nuneaton from 1924 to 1929 and for Birmingham Aston from 1931 to 1939, after which he was Governor of the Madras Presidency of British India from 1940 to 1946. Hope was born to the first Lord Rankeillour in 1897 and had his early education in England. He served with distinction in France during the First World War and entered public life soon after his military service was over. Hope married Grizel Gilmour (daughter of Brig.-Gen. Sir Robert Wolrige Gordon, 8th of Craigmillar and 13th of Liberton, 1st Bt. and Lady Susan Lygon) in 1919 and had four daughters. He died on 26 May 1958, nineteen days after his 61st birthday.  Early life  Arthur Oswald James Hope was born to James Hope, 1st Baron Rankeillour, by his marriage to Mabel Ellen Riddell, at Marylebone, England on 7 May 1897. His father had served as a Deputy Speaker of the House of Commons. Arthur was the eldest of four children, the others being Henry John Hope, 3rd Baron Rankeillour (1899–1967), Joan Mary Hope, and Richard Frederick Hope (1901–1964). Hope was educated at The Oratory School and at Sandhurst. He joined the Coldstream Guards in 1914 at the outbreak of the First World War and rose to be a Captain. He was wounded in action in France and was mentioned in dispatches. He was awarded the Military Cross and the Croix de Guerre.  Public life  Hope left the army at the conclusion of the First World War and entered public life. He joined the Conservative Party and at the 1924 general election was elected to the Parliament of the United Kingdom from the Nuneaton constituency in Warwickshire. Hope served a total of fourteen years in the House of Commons, representing Nuneaton from 1924 to 1929 and Birmingham Aston from 1931 to 1940. At the 1935 election, he defeated the only other candidate (Labour's Rudolph Putnam Messel) by a margin of 10,355 votes. He was still a member of the House of Commons when appointed as Governor of Madras but gave up his seat, thereby causing a by-election in Birmingham Aston. Hope served as the Parliamentary Private Secretary to Colonel George Lane Fox, Secretary for Mines from 1924 to 1926 and was a whip from 1935 to 1939, first as an unpaid Assistant Whip in 1935, then as an unpaid Lord of the Treasury from 1935 to 1937, as Vice-Chamberlain of the Household from May 1937 to October 1937 and finally as Treasurer of the Household from 1937 to 1939. He was a cricketer for a time and played a first-class match for the British Army against Cambridge University at Fenners Ground on 7 June 1926.  As Governor of Madras  Hope was appointed Governor of Madras in 1940 and succeeded John Erskine, Lord Erskine on 12 March 1940. Hope served as the Governor throughout the Second World War. Following the Japanese conquest of Burma and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, there were strong apprehensions about possible Japanese attacks on coastal Indian cities. On 18 April 1942, in a secret communication to Victor Hope, 2nd Marquess of Linlithgow, the Viceroy of India, Hope described reports of a Japanese force heading towards India. There were Japanese air raids on the coastal towns of Vizagapatam and Cocanada on 6 April 1942 followed by sea attacks on Madras port. Hope responded by evacuating commercial and administrative establishments and business offices along the Madras coast and moving them inland. Madras was in a state of emergency when Hope assumed his post, as the last elected government had resigned in October 1939. An anti-British campaign, the Quit India Movement, was launched in 1942. The provincial governments responded with a crackdown. Hope imposed censorship of newspapers in the Presidency and reporting on internal politics was suppressed. In protest against the government's actions, newspapers all over India were suspended for a day. Hope responded by withdrawing special privileges accorded to striking newspapers. The government also imposed censorship of Indian-language films. A provincial propaganda officer, G. D. B. Harvey was appointed to promote propaganda films in support of the British war effort. In 1943, the government issued an order under the Defence of India rules restricting the size of indigenously made films to 11,000 feet. In the beginning, the provincial leadership of the Indian National Congress under Chakravarthi Rajagopalachari was strongly opposed to India's forcible involvement in the Second World War but later, Rajagopalachari changed his mind and spoke in support of the British war effort even while his colleagues in New Delhi were still agitating against the war. Due to economic reasons, the different battalions of the Madras Regiment had been disbanded in stages. With the transferring of the 1st Battalion in 1928, the Madras Regiment ceased to exist. When Hope became governor in 1940, he tried to revive the Madras Regiment and canvassed for the same. Due to the efforts of Hope, the Madras Regiment was revived in 1942 and Hope was appointed the regiment's first Colonel-in-chief. A training centre was raised at Madukkarai in Coimbatore district in July 1942 and the regiment fought with distinction in the Burma campaign. In 1945, Hope inaugurated a polytechnic college built by G. D. Naidu in Coimbatore which was later named \\"Arthur Hope Polytechnic\\" in his honour. The polytechnic was later upgraded to a college of science and technology and renamed Government College of Science and Technology in 1950. Though the college was renamed and moved to a new campus, the area where it was originally located is still called \\"Hope College\\". Embezzlement and forced resignation Hope's tenure came to an end on 26 February 1946. Papers preserved at The National Archives indicate Lord Wavell (by then Viceroy) and the British government feared scandal after it became known to officials that Hope was receiving loans from wealthy Indians to pay off large debts incurred by Hope \\"speculating on the racecourse\\" before his appointment. Hope eventually claimed this assumption was accurate. It was feared by Lord Wavell that Hope might be sued if he was merely removed from office; governors had protection from litigation while they remained in office. It was decided that Hope must be quickly removed as governor without raising suspicion. Hope was diagnosed as suffering from Tropical Neurasthenia, a pseudo-medical health condition used at the time for the cover of Europeans returning home. Hope was succeeded by Henry Foley Knight in early March 1946 who served as the Acting Governor till the arrival of Hope's designated successor Archibald Edward Nye. Nye told his superiors in September 1946, that he discovered Hope had misappropriated 50,000 rupees (£3,750) given to him the previous year and intended for the Red Cross in India (equivalent to £ in ). Other money given to Hope was found to have been misappropriated in the same way; no proper auditing of what was termed a \\"special pod account\\" had taken place. The prime minister of the day, Clement Attlee, consented in April 1947 for Hope's debts to paid off from British government funds. An account based in India was used to prevent any indication to the local population London had become involved in the issue. Hope is thought to have misappropriated about £40,000 (equivalent to £ in ) to settle his debts. His obituary in The Times, published in 1958, maintained the official account given a decade earlier: \\"He was compelled by ill-health to resign . . . before his extended term of office was complete.\\"  Honours  Hope was appointed to the Order of the Indian Empire as a Knight Grand Commander in 1939 just before his appointment as Governor of Madras. Arthur Hope succeeded to the barony on the death of his father, the 1st Baron on 14 February 1949.  Death  Hope died on 26 May 1958 at the age of 61.  Family  On 2 June 1919, at the age of 22, Hope married Grizel Gilmour, the second daughter of Brigadier-General Sir Robert Gordon Gilmour (1857–1939) and Lady Susan Lygon (1870–1962). The couple had four daughters: * Bridget Mary Hope (b. 1920) * Jean Margaret Hope (b. 1923) * Alison Mary Hope (b. 1927) * Barbara Mary Hope (b. 1930) On Hope's death in 1958, as he had no son, his title and Scottish estate were inherited by his younger brother, Henry John Hope (1899–1967), a barrister.

Located south of its capital, Doha, it replaced the former Doha International Airport as Qatar's principal airport. Formerly known as New Doha International Airport (NDIA), Hamad International Airport was originally scheduled to open in 2009, but after a series of costly delays, the airport finally opened on 30 April 2014 with a ceremonial Qatar Airways flight landing from nearby Doha International. National carrier Qatar Airways and all other carriers formally relocated to the new airport on 27 May 2014. The airport is named after the previous Emir of Qatar, Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani. History =Planning and construction= Planning took place in 2003 and construction began in 2005. The airport (terminal and runway) has been built east of the older Doha International Airport. It is spread over an area of , and was set to initially serve airlines that will not utilize lounge access. Hamad International Airport was designed to cater for a projected ongoing increase in the volume of traffic. The airport has an initial annual capacity of 29 million passengers, three times the current volume. Upon completion, it will be able to handle 50 million passengers per year, although some estimates suggest the airport could handle up to 93 million per year, making it the second largest airport in the region after Dubai. It is also expected to handle 320,000 aircraft movements and 2 million tonnes of cargo annually. The check-in and retail areas are expected to be 12 times larger than those at the current airport. The airport will be two-thirds the size of Doha city. The airport has an oasis theme. Many of the buildings have a water motif, with wave-styled roofs and desert plants growing in recycled water. The airport is built over , half of which is on reclaimed land. The Steering Committee awarded the contract for the development of the airport to Bechtel. The contract includes the design, construction management and project management of the facilities. The terminal and concourses were designed by the architecture firm HOK. Engineering, Procurement and Construction contract for Phase I and II were undertaken by Turkish TAV Construction and Japanese Taisei Corporation. =Opening= Cargo operations began from 1 December 2013, with an inaugural flight by Qatar Airways Cargo arriving from Europe. The original soft launch on 2 April 2013 was cancelled just a few hours prior, and was postponed indefinitely due to unsatisfactory safety related issues that needed further reviewing taking nine months to address. Hamad International Airport was then set to begin passenger operations in January 2014, with a soft opening. Qatar Airways threatened a $600 million lawsuit against the joint venture contractor Lindner Depa Interiors for delaying the opening of the airport by failing to complete its lounges on time; LDI stated that it was delayed due to inadequate site access. Qatar Airways later blamed Bechtel for the opening delay in April 2013, citing failures to meet regulatory requirements. Hamad International Airport finally began passenger operations on 30 April 2014, with ten initial airlines operating. Qatar Airways and remaining airlines started operations to Hamad Airport on 27 May 2014 at 09:00 (Qatar time). An expansion plan announced in September 2015 called for an extension of the check-in area, an expansion of concourses D and E into a 1.3 km long concourse, a new passenger amenity area in the D/E complex with lounges, shops and restaurants. As part of this expansion plan, the Doha Metro was extended to the airport with the opening of the red line airport branch in December 2019. In 2016, the airport was named the 50th busiest airport in the world by passenger traffic, serving 37,283,987 passengers, a 20.2% increase from 2015. In 2019, the airport witnessed a 12.4% increase in annual passenger traffic. More than 38.8 million passengers arrived at the airport in 2019, up from 34.5 million in 2018.  Facilities  =Terminal 1= Interior of Concourse C Qatar Airways aircraft on the apron * Concourse A has 10 passenger gates connected to jet bridges and is located west of the check-in area and Main Terminal. Two of the gates are designed to accommodate the Airbus A380. * Concourse B has 10 passenger gates connected to jet bridges and is located east of the check-in area. It has opened on April 30, 2014 with 10 airlines transferring operations over from Doha International Airport. Two of the gates are built to accommodate the Airbus A380. There is a small coffee shop located at the end of Concourse B, as well as smoking rooms, family areas, and an express duty-free store. * Concourse C has 13 passenger gates connected to jet bridges, two of them built specifically for the Airbus A380. There are 10 remote gates without a fixed jet bridge link connected to Concourse C. This Concourse has opened on 27 May 2014. * Concourse D Is fully operational. Gates 1–4 are on the first floor and Gates 18–24 on the ground floor. (Gates 2 and 4 will be permanently closed due to the expansion of HIA) * Concourse E Is fully operational. Gates 1–4 are on the first floor and Gates 18–24 on the ground floor. (Gates 2 and 4 will be permanently closed due to the expansion of HIA) Concourses D and E are due to be extended with a possible Concourse F although plans are still to be finalised. Terminal 1 features First and Business Class lounges which were opened by Qatar Airways CEO, Akbar Al Baker on 20 June 2014. Lamp Bear The most prominent figure inside the airport is a giant bronze statue of a teddy bear with its head in a lamp. The untitled sculpture, often known as \\"Lamp Bear\\", is one of three creations by Swiss artist Urs Fischer and is on display at the grand foyer of the airport's duty- free shopping hall. Standing at seven meters tall and weighing approximately 18-20 tons, the statue was previously displayed at the Seagram Building's plaza in New York City before being purchased by a member of the Qatari royal family at a Christie's auction for US$6.8 million. In 2018 the airport added a new sculpture in their terminal, called Small Lie by American artist Kaws which was a donation from the Qatar Museum.  Expansion  In order to accommodate the increased passengers numbers of the FIFA 2022 World Cup and to keep up with Qatar Airway's continued passenger growth. The airport handled 34.5 million passengers in 2018 and this is expected to rise to 53 million by 2020. A new central building located between the existing Concourse's D & E will feature a 10,000 sqm tropical garden with a 268 meter tall water feature, similar to that found at Singapore Changi airport's Jewel complex. The project will also add 11,720 sqm of retail and F&B; space, and an expanded transfer area. A new Qatar Airways will occupy the mezzanine level, and covering 9,000 sqm it will be the world's largest airport lounge. In addition concourses D & E will be lengthened to accommodate nine additional wide-body aircraft stands. =Runways= The airport has two parallel runways, located from each other, which are designed for simultaneous take-offs and landings.

Details of sleep could be uploaded to the MyZeo Web site, where they were stored, with detailed historical charts of sleep patterns downloadable, and email suggestion on improving sleep could be sent. The state of sleep was detected by a headband, essentially comprising three long-lasting electrodes made of electrically conductive fabric and a wireless unit, that transmitted data to a Zeo bedside clock unit or Apple iPhone which displayed data and sounded the wake alarm. The company also developed and marketed a personal sleep coaching Web service which allowed users of the clock to upload their sleep data, then measure and analyze their sleep patterns; this was later made available without charge.

The town is located on Burgenland's northern border with Lower Austria, near the state capital of Eisenstadt.  History  Although the first historical mention of Leithaprodersdorf was in 1232, there is evidence of habitation in the area which predates the historical mention by several hundred years, dating back to the time of the Roman Empire. Previous archaeological expeditions have noted that the area around Leithaprodersdorf was heavily settled in ancient Roman times. Ancient archaeological finds in the area include two large estates and a watchtower. Additionally, the estates' graveyards have also been discovered, with some graves and even a few grave stones still intact. The names on the extant gravestones are Celtic-Roman in nature and are thought to date from between the 1st and 3rd centuries. Additionally, a burial site adorned with a cross dates from the 8th century. However, the largest and most visible evidence of the village's early history is the \\"G'Schlößl,\\" a structure consisting of three concentric rings of walls and ditches, built in the 13th century out of the ruins of the Roman watchtower, and used as a dike to stay protected against flooding of the Leitha River.

Chinatown () is an ethnic enclave in the Central Business District (CBD) of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Centred at the eastern end of Little Bourke Street, it extends between the corners of Swanston and Spring Streets, and consists of numerous laneways, alleys and arcades. Established in the 1850s during the Victorian gold rush, it is notable for being the longest continuous Chinese settlement in the Western World and the oldest Chinatown in the Southern Hemisphere. Melbourne's Chinatown has played an important role in establishing the culture of Chinese immigrants in Australia, and is still home to many Chinese restaurants, cultural venues, businesses and places of worship. Today, Melbourne's Chinatown is a major tourist attraction, known for its architectural heritage, annual festivals and cuisines of Chinese, Thai, Japanese, Indian, Malaysian, Vietnamese and Korean origins.http://chinatownmelbourne.com.au/ChinatownMelbourneBrochure2012.pdf Beyond Chinatown and the CBD, Melbourne's Chinese community is well- represented in other areas of the city, most notably Box Hill, where a $450 million development named \\"New Chinatown\\" is currently being constructed. Chinatown is home to the Chinese Museum. History =Early history= Chinese immigrants arriving in Chinatown, 1866 Melbourne's Chinatown has a long and illustrious history. It was established during the Victorian gold rush in 1851 when Chinese prospectors came to Australia for the gold rush in search of gold. In late 1854, the first Chinese lodging houses were created in Little Bourke Street and Celestial Avenue (off Little Bourke Street). This particular location was considered convenient for the immigrants, as it was a staging post for new Chinese immigrants as well as supplies en route to the goldfields. It is notable for being the oldest Chinatown in Australia, the oldest continuous Chinese settlement in Australia, and the longest continuous Chinese settlement in the western world, only because San Francisco's Chinatown was destroyed by the 1906 earthquake.Bacon, Daniel: Walking the Barbary Coast Trail 2nd ed., pages 52-53, Quicksilver Press, 1997 The gold rush eventually waned, causing a shift from rural living and an influx of people migrating into metropolitan Melbourne, particularly Little Bourke Street, which already had a predominantly Chinese population. Prince Alfred, 1867 The Chinese established themselves as storekeepers, importers, furniture-makers, herbalists and in the wholesale fruit and vegetable and restaurant industries. Christian churches were built and Chinese political groups and newspapers were subsequently formed. Other members of the Chinese community who lived and worked elsewhere used Chinatown to congregate with friends. The area also provided further support to new Chinese immigrants. Early in its history, during a thriving period in the 1850s, Chinatown housed \\"salubrious\\" enterprises including opium dens, brothels and boarding houses, but maintained a distinctly \\"entrepreneurial air\\". By 1859, Victoria's Chinese population reached approximately 45,000, representing nearly 8.5% of the colony's total population. Australian colonial author Marcus Clarke wrote in 1869: During the colonial period, several businesses run by Australians of European descent were based in Chinatown, including the offices of Table Talk, for a time in the 1880s one of Melbourne's most popular magazines. Chinatown peaked in the early 20th century in terms of population and activity, which was hampered by the 1901 Immigration Restriction Act and a general shift of businesses and residents from the Melbourne's central business district (CBD). The Dim Sim was invented in Chinatown, by William Wing Young, in 1945, at his restaurant Wing Lee, and has become a major snack food in takeaway outlets and Chinese restaurants throughout the entire country. European residents of Melbourne and university students of the city began frequenting Chinatown eateries in the 1930s, leading to gradual mainstream Australian popularity which boomed in the 1960s–70s. This boom was further enlarged by the redevelopment of Little Bourke Street at the request of Chinatown entrepreneur David Neng-Hsiang Wang, leading to the archways of today. =1970s–present day= Chinatown at night The dim sim, a popular example of Australian Chinese cuisine, originated in Chinatown The Southern Chinese people (who first settled in Melbourne) were the first Chinese Australians to bring Chinese cuisine to Australia, although recently more Northern Chinese food has become common. Chinese food was the first international cuisine to become popular through the take away food market in Australia. The 1970s and 80's also saw the eradication of the controversial discriminatory immigration regulations, which saw immigration from Indochina, Singapore, Malaysia, Taiwan, Hong Kong and the People's Republic of China. In 2010, the ground floor of the Chinese Museum was remodeled as a visitor centre for Melbourne's Chinatown. In 2011, a Memorial statue of Dr Sun Yat-sen was unveiled outside the Museum's entrance in celebration of the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Republic of China. The traditional Chinese New Year Lion Dance has always ended at this spot, but will now end with a blessing of the statue. Culture =Chinese New Year= Collins Street during Chinese New Year celebrations The Chinese New Year is primarily celebrated in Chinatown on the first Sunday of the new Lunar year. It is the original and primary location of Melbourne's CNY festival, although the festival has expanded to multiple CBD sites in recent years, including Crown Casino. The celebrations feature traditional and contemporary Chinese cultural activities and festivities, dances, Chinese opera and singing, karaoke competition, numerous stalls of culinary delights, arts and crafts, Chinese chess competitions, calligraphy and children's events. The Dai Loong Dragon Parade, as well as the main Lion Dances (performed by the Chinese Youth Society of Melbourne, Chinese Masonic Society and Hung Gar Martial Arts School) begin at roughly 10am on the Sunday following New Year, and run till roughly 4pm. The Dragon parade begins and ends at Melbourne's Chinese Museum. =Asian Food Festival= The Asian food festival is typically held in Spring and celebrates Asian cuisine with food tasting, stalls, cooking demonstrations, among others.  Other Chinese communities  Beyond the original Chinatown in the CBD, several newer Chinese communities have developed in Melbourne's eastern suburbs, such as Box Hill, Glen Waverley and Springvale. An older community, with links back to the 1850s gold rush, is to be found in the regional city of Bendigo, 150 km north-west of Melbourne. Cultural depictions Tom Roberts, one of the leading figures of Australian Impressionism, created sketches of life in Little Bourke Street in the 1880s. During the Second World War, modernist Eric Thake created a series of works depicting Chinatown shopfronts, which now belong in the State Library of Victoria's painting collection. Fergus Hume's The Mystery of a Hansom Cab (1886), one of the most famous mystery crime novels of the Victorian era, is based largely on the author's observations of life in Little Bourke Street, including the \\"dark recesses\\" of the Chinese Quarter, where Detective Kilsip, the novel's protagonist, pursues his suspect. Alfred Dampier's Marvellous Melbourne play of the same year features a scene in a Chinatown opium den. Set in Little Bourke Street, Elinor Mordaunt's 1919 novel The Ginger Jar is about a love affair between a Chinese Australian hawker and a European woman. A pivotal scene of the 1911 silent film The Double Event, directed by W. J. Lincoln, takes place in Melbourne's Chinatown. The 1997 Hong Kong action film Mr. Nice Guy, starring Jackie Chan, is set in Melbourne, with several scenes shot in Chinatown.

He was drafted in the 7th round (171st pick overall) of the 1984 NFL Draft by the New York Giants, and played seven seasons in the NFL. Early life Manuel was born in Los Angeles, California and attended Bassett High School. He played college football at Citrus College before transferring to the University of the Pacific where he played wide receiver and running back for the Pacific Tigers. Professional career The 5'11, 180-lb wide receiver was drafted in the 7th round of the 1984 NFL draft by the New York Giants, and played in seven NFL seasons. Manuel spent his entire career with the Giants (1984–1990), including the XXI Giants Super Bowl Team when they beat the Denver Broncos 39-20. His peak performance was during the 1988 season, when he caught 65 passes for 1,029 yards and scored four touchdowns. Manuel's career ended after several injuries in the 1990 season when he played under Head Coach Bill Parcells. The Giants finished the 1990 season 13–3, and won the Super Bowl XXV against the Buffalo Bills 20–19. Parcells waived Manuel in December 1990, citing Manuel's poor attitude after losing his starting position. Manuel then signed with the Buffalo Bills as a free agent but was waived due to injuries and did not play for the team. Manuel played European football with the Barcelona Dragons before retiring in 1993. Life after the NFL Manuel went on to coach several college football teams including The LaVerne Leopards, and later became a professional chef and restaurateur after attending the Scottsdale Culinary Institute.

The film is about four explorers who travel down into the depths of the sea and get stranded in an underwater cavern. While waiting to be rescued, the group runs across a crazy old sailor named Matheny who's been living in the cave for years. They find a rotting skeleton of another sailor, whom they learn was murdered by Matheny. The rest of the story deals with their attempts to escape and return to the surface world. The film was actually completed by Warren in 1957, but remained unreleased until it was distributed starting in November, 1959 and, more widely, in April, 1960https://catalog.afi.com/Search?searchField=MovieName&searchText;=incredible+petrified+world&sortType;=sortByPartialMatch on a double feature with Warren's Teenage Zombies. Plot Professor Millard Wyman (John Carradine) sends a crew of two men, Paul Whitmore (Allen Windsor) and Craig Randall (Robert Clarke), and two women Lauri Talbott (Sheila Noonan) and Dale Marshall (Phyllis Coates), down to ocean depths never before explored. But, there's a technical problem during the launch. The diving bell breaks free of the cable connecting them to the surface and loses contact with the surface. The mission is believed lost. But the crew, having survived their ordeal, don their scuba gear and leave the bell. Instead of reaching the surface, they surface in a cavern. The crew members explore the cave and find a skeleton, then a disheveled old sailor named Matheny (George Skaff) who tells them that he and another sailor suffered a shipwreck fourteen years prior and has been living in these caves ever since. He claims there is no way out and a volcano provides air from the surface. Meanwhile, up on the surface Prof. Wyman's younger brother builds another bell and launches it in an attempted rescue mission. However, with the old man in the cave starting to leer lecherously at the women, and the volcano growing more unstable, the second mission may not find them in time. The old man reveals to the women that he murdered the other sailor years ago, increasing their apprehension. Just as he is about to assault one of the girls, the volcano erupts and the old man is crushed under falling rocks. The stranded crew of the diving bell make their way up toward the surface and are rescued.

Design and development As a seaplane, the N-9 was equipped with a single central pontoon mounted under the fuselage. A small float was fitted under each wingtip. With the additional weight of the pontoon, a number of structural and aerodynamic changes were required, the design of which made use of wind tunnel data developed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, meaning the N-9 was the first American naval aircraft to incorporate wind tunnel data directly into its design. The wingspan was stretched an additional ten feet (three meters), the fuselage was lengthened, the tail surfaces were enlarged, and stabilizing fins were added on top of the upper wing. The N-9 was initially powered by a 100 hp (75 kW) Curtiss OXX-6 engine. U.S. Navy N-9s and Curtiss Model Fs at Naval Air Station Key West Curtiss was awarded an initial contract for 30 aircraft in August 1916, and an additional 14 were ordered by the United States Army, which maintained a small seaplane operation. It quickly became apparent that the aircraft was underpowered, so Curtiss replaced the engine with a 150 hp (112 kW) Hispano-Suiza, manufactured in the United States under license by Wright-Martin's Simplex division (later Wright Aeronautical). The aircraft was redesignated N-9H. A total of 560 N-9s were built during World War I, most of which were \\"H\\" models. Only 100 were actually built by Curtiss. Most were built under license by the Burgess Company of Marblehead, Massachusetts. Fifty others were assembled after the war, from spare components and engines by the U.S. Navy at Naval Air Station Pensacola in Florida. Operational history Although the consensus in early 1917 among aviators and even the N-9s manufacturer was that the N-9 could not be looped, the pioneering early United States Marine Corps aviator Francis Thomas Evans, Sr., believed it was possible. On 13 February 1917, he flew an N-9 over the Gulf of Mexico off Pensacola, Florida, and began attempts to loop it. He succeeded on his fourth try, becoming one of the first persons ever to loop a seaplane (first pilot to loop a seaplane was Polish aviator Jan Nagórski on 17 September 1916 in Grigorovich M-9 flying boat). Lacking witnesses, he flew over Naval Air Station Pensacola and repeated the feat. In 1936, he received the Distinguished Flying Cross for this achievement.Knapp, Walter, \\"The Marines Take Wing,\\" Aviation History, May 2012, p. 51. More important, however, were the stall and spin recovery techniques he discovered while flying the N-9 that day. During his first three loop attempts, the N-9 stalled before he reached the apex of the loop and fell into a spin. He found that by releasing back-pressure on the stick and aggressively applying opposite rudder to the direction of the spin he could change the spin into a normal dive and recover, something previously thought impossible in an N-9. His stall and spin recovery techniques remain in use to this day by aviators around the world. Preserved Curtiss N-9H exhibited at the National Museum of Naval Aviation at Pensacola, Florida in 1975. Over 2,500 U.S. Navy pilots received their seaplane training in N-9s. Besides this primary role, though, the aircraft was also used to help develop shipborne aircraft operations during World War I, especially the development of ship-mounted launch catapults. In 1917, several N-9s were provided to the Sperry Gyroscope Company for conversion to the Hewitt-Sperry Automatic Airplane configuration, flight testing the new autopilot components intended to be used in pilotless \\"aerial torpedoes\\". The U.S. Navy retired the N-9s in 1927 as more modern trainers became available. Surviving aircraft Only one example of the type has survived, and is now a part of the National Air and Space Museum collection. Originally on display at the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago, Illinois, it was later transferred back to the U.S. Navy pending transport to the National Air and Space Museum. The Naval Air Engineering Laboratory in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, fully restored it in 1966.

The novel was turned into a film in 1932, directed by Karl Hartl – it was produced as a multilingual version (MLV), with one film each in German, French, and English. Filming versions in different languages was common in the early sound film period. The plot concerned a permanent air station in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. (After Charles Lindbergh's transatlantic flight in 1927, and before the novel was written, newspapers ran stories of Edward Robert Armstrong's \\"seadrome\\" concept of a floating platform that would allow airplanes of the time, which had limited range, to cross the ocean.) The German version was the last German film that either Siodmak or Peter Lorre, who played a secondary character, would make in Germany before the war. It premiered on 22 December 1932. By 1933, a political joke referring to Adolf Hitler played on the title of the film: \\"P.G.1 antwortet nicht.\\" (meaning \\"Parteigenosse 1 antwortet nicht,\\" or \\"Party Member 1 doesn't answer.\\").  Plot  Lieutenant Droste wants to build an air station in the middle of the ocean to allow pilots on intercontinental flights to refuel and repair any damage to their aircraft. With the help of the pilot Ellissen, he manages to win the support of the Lennartz-Werke for the project. Ellissen, who has taken up with the owner's sister Claire Lennartz, shies away from marriage and seeks new adventure. After two years, the platform has become a city on the ocean, with runways, hangars, hotels, and shopping centers. During a storm, the connection to the platform is severed. The last sounds to come over the telephone were gunshots and screams. The weather clears and the best pilots immediately head for F.P.1. Ellissen, in a lovesick depression, is convinced by Claire to accompany her to the platform. Their plane crashes on the island but they survive. The crew of F.P.1 has been the victim of a saboteur, who knocked them out with gas. Before chief engineer Damsky fled in a boat, he opened the valves, causing a danger that F.P.1 will sink. Claire finds the badly injured Droste and takes care of him. Ellissen has to recognize that Claire is slipping away from him. After a short time, he pulls himself together and takes a plane out to get help. He sees a ship, jumps from his plane, is taken aboard the ship, and calls for help via radio. A fleet of ships and planes are sent to rescue F.P.1.Translated from the German version of this page  Cast  ;German Version (F.P.1 antwortet nicht) * Hans Albers as Ellissen * Sybille Schmitz as Claire Lennartz * Paul Hartmann: Kapitänleutnant Droste * Peter Lorre as Bildreporter Jonny * Hermann Speelmans as Chefingenieur Damsky * Erik Ode as Konrad Lennartz * Werner Schott as Matthias Lennartz * Gustav Püttjer as Mann mit der Fistelstimme * Georg John as Maschinist ;English Version (Floating Platform 1 Does Not Answer) * Conrad Veidt as Maj.

Academic Background Ken majored in linguistics at University of Wisconsin–Madison in 1985, where he obtained his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1987, Master of Arts degree in 1988, and graduated with a doctoral thesis on the simplification of Japanese characters in 1994, titled \\"Prescriptive Kanji Simplification\\", which was written under the supervision of Professor Andrew Sihler. Career Prior to graduation, he joined Adobe Systems on July 1, 1991, where he worked on font development and programming for information processing in CJKV languages; as of 2008, he worked there as a Senior Computer Scientist. He wrote two books on these topics, listed below under Bibliography. A second edition of CJKV Information Processing was published at the end of 2008. His 28-year-long career with Adobe ended on October 18, 2019. He is a contributor to the Unicode Consortium –formerly as a representative of Adobe (a voting member there)–, specializing in CJK Unified Ideographs; he is the editor (or co- editor) of the Unicode Standard’s Standard Annex #11 “East Asian Width”,, Technical Standard #37 “Unicode Ideographic Variation Database”, Standard Annex #38 “Unicode Han Database (Unihan)”, and Standard Annex #50 “Unicode Vertical Text Layout”.

The surname Lunde, of Viking origin, shares the same meaning (“small woods” or “grove”) conveyed by the Japanese surname ; the given name (and its variant forms like in Japan's national standard JIS X 0208:1997), chosen both for its phonemic value and for its meaning (“sword”), conveys his fondness for sharp-edged tools like knives. The traditional form , where is actually an ideographic variant coined by his wife Hitomi Kudo () and accessed with variation selector VS18 as <U+528D,U+E0101> (Adobe-Japan1-4 CID+14106), is penned in UAX #11,, UTS #37, UAX #38,, and UAX #50; the form (without the variation selector, matching Traditional Chinese form) was previously used in UAX #38 for Unicode versions 11.0 and earlier.

His nickname was \\"The Bear\\", and was recognized by his booming gritty voice. Biography Hite was introduced to Alan Wilson by Henry Vestine and the two of them helped convince blues pianist Sunnyland Slim (1906-1995) to get back into the recording studio to record. In 1965, aged 22, Hite formed a band with Wilson. Vestine joined soon after and this trio formed the core of Canned Heat. The trio were eventually joined by Larry Taylor (bass) and Frank Cook (drums). Hite performed with Canned Heat at Woodstock in August 1969. The performances were not included in the original (1970) film Woodstock, but are in the 1994 \\"Director's Cut\\" version. It appears that Canned Heat's 'Woodstock Boogie' sung by The Bear was on the original cut. Canned Heat appeared on a November 1969 episode of Playboy After Dark. Hite was invited to talk with Hugh Hefner after the performance, along with other guests Sonny and Cher, Vic Damone, Dick Shawn and Larry Storch. A 20-year-old Lindsay Wagner, playing the part of one of Hefner's party guests, sat on Hite's lap and played a party game. When asked by Hefner what kind of animal Hite would be if he were an animal, Wagner claimed he'd be a bear. Hite told her she got it right, that people called him \\"The Bear.\\" It was also on this episode that Hite informed Hugh Hefner that he had over 15,000 78s. He produced the John Lee Hooker and Canned Heat album, Hooker 'N Heat (1971). =Death= On April 5, 1981, during a break between sets at The Palomino Club in North Hollywood, Hite was handed a vial of heroin by a fan. He snorted it and fell into a coma, after which others unsuccessfully attempted to revive him with a large dose of cocaine. A group of roadies put Hite in a van and drove him to bandmate Fito de la Parra's home, where he died.De La Parra, Fito. (2011). Living The Blues.

His most popular films are: Operation Y, The Meeting Place Cannot Be Changed, The Twelve Chairs, The Adjutant of His Excellency, Dauria, Trial on the Road, Gambrinus, and Children of Monday. His last appearances were in The Envy of Gods (2000), DMB (2000) and Brigada (2002). Biography =Early life and education= Viktor Pavlovich Pavlov was born on October 6, 1940, in Moscow. His father, Pavel Igantievich, was an engineer who later had a high post in the Ministry of Agriculture and his mother a doctor. His childhood, which coincided with the war, passed in the Arbat District on Sivtsev Vrazhek Lane. The son, who grew up practically on the street among juvenile delinquents, delivered a lot of troubles to his parents. His ear was severely damaged in a fight, after which it ended up protruding for the rest of his life. When Pavlov became a participant in a theft, his father already held a high post in the Ministry of Agriculture. Only this helped his son escape the youth colony, but he was expelled from school. Viktor started to perform on stage early. At first he was engaged in children's district choir, then he successfully took part in all theatrical productions of his school. In 1956, after graduating from the eight-year school, to help the family and get the experience for admission to the university, Viktor got a job as an apprentice of a locksmith, then became a radio installer and at the same time attended the evening school of working young people. During this period, he attended the theater studio at the Teacher's House, which was led by a famous actor, director and teacher Vadim Bogomolov, who became his first theater teacher and supported his decision to go to art. In 1959, Viktor Pavlov entered the Moscow Art Theatre School, but transferred to the Mikhail Shchepkin Higher Theatre School, where he was enrolled in the course of Vera Pashennaya and Nikolay Annenkov. =Theatre= In 1963, after graduating from the school, Viktor Pavlov was invited to the Sovremennik Theatre, where he participated in the performances \\"Naked King\\" (Christian), \\"The Elder Sister\\" (Ogorodnikov), \\"Forever Alive\\" (Zaitsev), \\"Snow White and seven dwarfs \\"(Wednesday),\\" Cyrano de Bergerac \\"(Linear),\\" Two colors \\"(Turnip), etc. In 1965, Viktor Pavlov moved to the Theater named after Ermolova and worked there until 1969, then left and returned in 1985 and worked until 1990. On this stage, they played the roles of Beavers in the production of \\"The Time and Family of Conway\\", Bulanov in the play \\"Forest\\", Dupont Dufour's son in \\"The Ball of Thieves\\", Paisiy's father in \\"Beg\\", Nechipurenko in \\"Speak\\", Kazmin in \\"The Last visitor \\", Mikhalev in\\" Sports Scenes of 1981 \\", Jacques in the play\\" The Second Year of Freedom \\", etc. From 1969 to 1977, Viktor Pavlov worked at the Mayakovsky Theatre, where he played roles in many performances, each of which became events in the theatrical life of Moscow: \\"Conversations with Socrates\\" (Melet), \\"Defeat\\" (Styrksha), \\"Man of (Sancho Panza), Talents and admirers (Vasya), Vanyushin's Children (Krasavin), The Duma of the British (Egor Ivanovich), The Aristocrats (Kulak) and many others. From 1977 to 1985 and from 1990 until his death, Viktor Pavlov worked at the State Academic Maly Theater . Among the roles he played on the stage of this theater are the Jester in \\"King Lear\\", Roman Somonovsky (\\"My Favorite Clown\\"), Vladimir Nikolayevich (\\"Conversations with a Clear Moon\\"), Ashmetev (\\"Diksarka\\"), Shpekin (\\"Inspector\\"), Repetilov (\\"Woe from Wit\\") and many others. Among the latest works of the artist Bezhars (\\"Criminal mother, or Second Tartuffe\\"), Gradoboev (\\"Hot Heart\\"), Zagoretsky (\\"Woe from Wit\\"), Arkashka Schastlivtsev (\\"Forest\\"). =Film= Work in the theater Viktor Pavlov combined with work in film and television. His debut in the movie took place when he was a fourth- year student. These were episodic roles in Lev Kulidzhanov in the film When the Trees Were Tall and Stanislav Rostotsky in the film On the Seven Winds. The first important role of Viktor Pavlov was the student Dub in Leonid Gaidai's comedy Operation Y and Shurik's Other Adventures Fame came to the actor in 1967 after the role of scout Kolya Grishanchikov in the television movie Major Whirlwind directed by Yevgeny Tashkov based on the eponymous novel by Julian Semenov. Viktor Pavlov appeared in more than 120 films of various genres, by prominent directors of Soviet and Russian cinema. He was shot in such films as The Twelve Chairs, The Meeting Place Cannot Be Changed, The Adjutant of His Excellency, On the Seven Winds, Time, Forward!, Dauria, At War as at War, The Wizard of the Emerald City, Leaving Away, Hello and Farewell, Trial on the Road, Lilac Ball, Gambrinus, Orphaned Kazan, Children of Monday, The Envy of Gods, Demobbed, Strugovye, The Battle in Blizzard, Emelyan Pugachev, Cynics, The Master and Margarita and many others. Among the latest works of Viktor Pavlov were episodic roles in the series Deadly Force and Dasha Vasilieva, a Lover of Private Investigation, in the films Moscow Laughs and Dreaming of Space. Viktor Pavlov was a member of the Union of Theater Workers and the Union of Cinematographers. =Illness and death= In Kiev, on the set of the film Curator, in which the actor played his last role in the movie, he suffered a stroke. Viktor Pavlov died August 24, 2006 from a heart attack in his Moscow apartment. He was buried in Moscow at the Kuntsevo Cemetery next to his father's grave. =Personal life= Viktor Pavlov was married to the actress of the MN Theater. Ermolova Tatyana Nikolayevna Govorova.

The diocese was abolished under civil constitution of the clergy in 1790, and this was confirmed by the Concordat of 1801.  Architecture  The present church building dates from the 11th century, with later additions. There is an adjacent romanesque cloister. The cloister = The Church = The sanctuary is made up of a nave with three spans, without collateral or chapels, a transept and three apses. The nave has a deviation of the very apparent axis due to the origin of the absidioles. The central apse, preceded by a cradle vaulted, was built at the end of the 11th century. The two small lateral apses are of unequal depth, and are roughly constructed in two-meter-thick walls, showing an origin largely anterior to the 11th century. There are also two lateral towers of a Gallo-Roman gate, or of elements of a Frankish or Visigothic fortress. The central apse corresponding to the choir is vaulted in cul-de-four. The walls are covered with an exceptional set of Romanesque frescoes dating from the 11th century; Externally, the three apses are not ornamented: the apse presents three flat faces executed in particular with stones of great Roman apparatus and antique marbles recovered from the Gallo-Roman walls of the city. The nave, which dates from the 12th century, is constructed of rough stones up to two-thirds of the height. The walls were subsequently raised in several stages, particularly in the 13th and 15th centuries. The upper part of the walls is pierced with Gothic windows. This part, as well as the lateral buttresses and the vault dates back to the end of the 15th century.

It is the episcopal seat of the Bishop of Troyes. The cathedral, in the Gothic architectural style, has been a listed monument historique since 1862. Building history and description Plan The site has been used for religious buildings since at least the 4th century, when an oratory stood on the site. A cathedral was built in the 9th century, but was badly damaged by Norman invasions and was replaced in the 10th century, from about 940, when bishop Milo built a Romanesque cathedral. This building was the location of the Council of Troyes that opened on 13 January 1128/29, at which the Order of the Knights Templar was confirmed and its rule established. The Romanesque cathedral was destroyed by fire in 1188. Construction of the present Gothic cathedral was ordered in about 1200 by bishop Garnier de Traînel and begun under bishop Hervé in 1208. Work continued until the 17th century. The cathedral only has one tower, St. Peter's; St. Paul's tower to the south was never built, and the building is thus still in fact unfinished. A steeple, with a height of 110 metres (360'), once stood over the crossing: it was ruined by a tornado in 1365, and struck by lightning in 1700, after which it was not rebuilt. The cathedral structure has suffered other natural disasters: part of the choir was destroyed in a hurricane in 1228, and the roof was set alight by lightning in 1389. The earliest part is the 13th-century choir. The elaborate façade dates from the beginning of the 16th century. The three main portals are the work of the architect Martin Chambiges. The cathedral escaped destruction during the French Revolution, but was de-Christianised and turned into a Temple of Abundance for several years. It is particularly noted for its exceptional stained-glass windowsAmong them is one which apparently has a representation of the famous Indo-Parthian king Gondophares who was ruling in ancient Taxila from 20 to 41 CE, in what is now north-western Pakistan (see Bivar, A.D.H., 2007: \\"Gondophares and the Indo-Parthians\\", pp. 26–31, in: The Age of the Parthians, ed. Vesta Sarkhosh Curtis and Sarah Stewart. Ib. Tauris, New York. ). According to the legends and traditions contained in the Acts of Thomas, and preserved by the Indian Christians of St. Thomas, the Apostle Thomas fled to the East after the crucifixion. He stayed for some time at Gondophares' court where Thomas is said to have built a palace for him before heading on to southern India where he was, according to the legend, martyred near modern Chennai (Madras) (see: James, M. R., 1966: \\"The Acts of Thomas\\" in The Apocryphal New Testament, pp. 365–377; 434–438. Oxford). of dates from the 13th to the 19th century, with a surface area of 1,500 m² (16,000 sq. ft.), and for the magnificent treasury containing among many other important works the reliquary casket or shrine of Saint Bernard de Clairvaux and his closest friend Saint Malachy of Ireland. The cathedral, containing the nave, two principal aisles and two further subsidiary aisles, is 114 metres (379 feet 6 inches) long and 50 metres (162 feet 6 inches) wide (across the transepts), with a height from the top of the vault of 29.5 metres (96 feet); the height of the cupola and the tower is 62.34 metres (202 feet 7 inches).  Events  In May 1420, the Treaty of Troyes was signed in the cathedral between Henry V of England, his ally Philip of Burgundy and Queen Isabel, wife of the mad Charles VI of France whereby the throne of France would pass to Henry on the death of Charles rather than to Charles' son the Dauphin. Henry married Catherine of Valois, the French king's daughter, shortly afterwards in Troyes, either at the cathedral or the church of St Jean. In July 1429, Joan of Arc escorted the Dauphin to Mass in the cathedral en route to proclaiming him Charles VII of France at Reims Cathedral, in contravention of the recently signed Treaty of Troyes.

It officially opened on 10 June 1958 as Burscough County Secondary School under the Headship of Brian Stone, and cost just over £120,000 to build. The then Edward Stanley, 18th Earl of Derby (1918–1994) presided over the ceremony. At the time of opening, the school's staff of 10 teachers looked after 222 pupils. The school's motto E Pluribus Unum (Out of Many, One), which is also the motto of the United States, was thought to be appropriate as the new school was created from several all-age schools from around the area. The Academy's intake is around 700 students and caters for 11-to 16-year-olds, with 90 members of staff. History The school originally occupied of space, of which just over was developed into playing fields and sport facilities. The school building comprised a two-storey building with 8 classrooms and 6 practical rooms, amongst changing rooms and hall. Originally the school was to be named Ormskirk Burscough County Secondary School, until protests by the people of Burscough were successful in having the \\"Ormskirk\\" dropped from the title. The original school was designed to educate a maximum of 300 students, but numbers rose to 450 before any extensions where added. Although small in size in comparison to other secondary comprehensive schools in West Lancashire, the school has seen several expansions since its construction. As well as a ROSLA building being constructed in the early 1970s, the school was also extended in 1976. It then became known as Burscough Priory High School. During this time the roll expanded to over 800 pupils with the comprehensive intake. Brian Stone retired in July 1984 and Eric Cole took on the role of acting headteacher for the autumn term in 1984 until the appointment of Roger Leighton as headteacher in January 1985. The school was later extended again with the construction of a Performing Arts building, in response to gaining specialist Science College status. The school converted to an Academy, sponsored by Endeavour Learning Trust from September 2018. Buildings Burscough Priory Academy. The school's four buildings link to form a single school, split across two halves with a sheltered corridor providing an indoor connection between them. =Original building= The original building is where the modern school entrance and main corridors are, including classrooms on the upper floor. This was the original school until it was extended in 1972 and 1976 for the raising of school leaving age and for the comprehensive intake, respectively. No extensive refurbishment has taken place in the original part of the school. A gymnasium was built during the 1970s, when headteacher Brian Stone had the option to build a swimming pool or a gymnasium, and chose the latter. The back of school also saw an extension of classrooms during the 1970s and the front entrance saw some refurbishment during the summer of 2004. =The ROSLA Building= In 1972, a law was passed to increase the legal age at which a pupil could leave compulsory education from 15 to 16. As with many schools around the country, a ROSLA building was erected next the main school building, which is the first building seen upon entering the school premises. Although intended to last for only around 15 years, the ROSLA building is still standing after years. It accommodates the art and SEN departments, as well as a pastoral support centre on the ground floor with a smaller secondary cafeteria adjoined to it. Extensive refurbishment took place in 2016, with the removal of asbestos and a full redecoration. =Science and Performing Arts building= In September 2004, the school changed its name to Burscough Priory Science College to reflect gaining specialist school status in Science. The science and performing arts building was completed and in use in the same month, with the official opening occurring 8 months later on 25 May 2005, being named after the original headteacher as The Brian Stone Centre. It accommodates the newly built science laboratories on the ground floor, as well as the upper floor music & performing arts departments, comprising 2 large music rooms, several practice rooms and a drama studio. This building was built on the location which housed the aging portable cabin classrooms. Solar panels In 2008, Burscough Priory was one of 100 schools through the United Kingdom to have been chosen to receive solar panels worth £20000, half funded by the Co-op's £1m Green Energy for Schools Scheme. An LCD display in the school entrance displays the total energy generated by the panels since installation (including real-time generation) and also the amount of greenhouse gases which have been prevented from entering the atmosphere.Sun-thing to be pleased about! Conversion to Academy The DfE confirmed in late August 2018 that the conversion from Burscough Priory Science College to Burscough Priory Academy was finalised for 1 September 2018. This confirmed that the school would be joining and be sponsored by Endeavour Learning Trust.

It was initiated by 454 Life Sciences, a biotechnology company based in Branford, Connecticut in the United States and is coordinated by the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Germany. In May 2010 the project published their initial draft of the Neanderthal genome based on the analysis of four billion base remain in modern humans outside Africa.The Neanderthal in Us In December 2013, a high coverage genome of a Neanderthal was reported for the first time. It stemmed from a Neanderthal female bone fragment found in a cave in the Altai mountains of Siberia from around 50,000-100,000 years ago. Findings The researchers recovered ancient DNA of Neanderthals by extracting the DNA from the femur bones of three 38,000 year-old female Neanderthal specimens from Vindija Cave, Croatia, and other bones found in Spain, Russia, and Germany. Only about half a gram of the bone samples (or 21 samples each 50-100 mg) was required for the sequencing, but the project faced many difficulties, including the contamination of the samples by the bacteria that had colonized the Neanderthal's body and humans who handled the bones at the excavation site and at the laboratory. In February 2009, the Max Planck Institute's team led by Svante Pääbo announced that they had completed the first draft of the Neanderthal genome. An early analysis of the data suggested in \\"the genome of Neanderthals, a human species driven to extinction\\" \\"no significant trace of Neanderthal genes in modern humans\\". New results suggested that some adult Neanderthals were lactose intolerant. On the question of potentially cloning a Neanderthal, Pääbo commented, \\"Starting from the DNA extracted from a fossil, it is and will remain impossible.\\" In May 2010, the project released a draft of their report on the sequenced Neanderthal genome. Contradicting the results discovered while examining mitochondrial DNA, they demonstrated a range of genetic contribution to non-African modern humans ranging from 1% to 4%. From their Homo sapiens samples in Eurasia (French, Han Chinese and Papuan) the authors stated that it is likely that interbreeding occurred in the Levant before Homo sapiens migrated into Europe. This finding is disputed because of the paucity of archeological evidence supporting their statement. The fossil evidence does not conclusively place Neanderthals and modern humans in close proximity at this time and place. According to preliminary sequences from 2010, 99.7% of the nucleotide sequences of the modern human and Neanderthal genomes are identical, compared to humans sharing around 98.8% of sequences with the chimpanzee. (For some time, studies concerning the commonality between chimps and humans modified the commonality of 99% to a commonality of only 94%, showing that the genetic gap between humans and chimpanzees was far larger than originally thought, but more recent knowledge states the difference between humans, chimpanzees, and bonobos at just about 1.0–1.2% again.) Additionally, in 2010, the discovery and analysis of Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) from the Denisova hominin in Siberia revealed that it differed from that of modern humans by 385 bases (nucleotides) in the mtDNA strand out of approximately 16,500, whereas the difference between modern humans and Neanderthals is around 202 bases. In contrast, the difference between chimpanzees and modern humans is approximately 1,462 mtDNA base pairs. Analysis of the specimen's nuclear DNA was then still under way and expected to clarify whether the find is a distinct species. Even though the Denisova hominin's mtDNA lineage predates the divergence of modern humans and Neanderthals, coalescent theory does not preclude a more recent divergence date for her nuclear DNA. A rib fragment from the partial skeleton of a Neanderthal infant found in the Mezmaiskaya cave in the northwestern foothills of the Caucasus Mountains was radiocarbon-dated in 1999 to 29,195±965 B.P., and therefore belonging to the latest lived Neanderthals. Ancient DNA recovered for a mtDNA sequence showed 3.48% divergence from that of the Feldhofer Neanderthal, some 2,500 km to the west in Germany and in 2011 Phylogenetic analysis placed the two in a clade distinct from modern humans, suggesting that their mtDNA types have not contributed to the modern human mtDNA pool. In 2015, Israel Hershkovitz of Tel Aviv University reported that a skull found in a cave in northern Israel, is \\"probably a woman, who lived and died in the region about 55,000 years ago, placing modern humans there and then for the first time ever\\", pointing to a potential time and location when modern humans first interbred with Neanderthals.Skull discovery suggests location where humans first had sex with Neanderthals The Guardian, 28 January 2015 In 2016, the project found that Neanderthals bred with modern humans multiple times, and that Neanderthals interbred with Denisovans only once, as evidenced in the genome of modern-day Melanesians. In 2006, two research teams working on the same Neanderthal sample published their results, Richard Green and his team in Nature, and James Noonan's team in Science. The results were received with some scepticism, mainly surrounding the issue of a possible admixture of Neanderthals into the modern human genome. Svante Pääbo, director of the Department of Genetics at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology and head of its Neanderthal genome project. In 2006, Richard Green's team had used a then new sequencing technique developed by 454 Life Sciences that amplifies single molecules for characterization and obtained over a quarter of a million unique short sequences (\\"reads\\"). The technique delivers randomly located reads, so that sequences of interest - genes that differ between modern humans and Neanderthals - show up at random as well. However, this form of direct sequencing destroys the original sample so to obtain new reads more samples must be destructively sequenced. Noonan's team, led by Edward Rubin, used a different technique, one in which the Neanderthal DNA is inserted into bacteria, which make multiple copies of a single fragment. They demonstrated that Neanderthal genomic sequences can be recovered using a metagenomic library-based approach. All of the DNA in the sample is \\"immortalized\\" into metagenomic libraries. A DNA fragment is selected, then propagated in microbes. The Neanderthal DNA can be sequenced or specific sequences can be studied. Overall, their results were remarkably similar. One group suggested there was a hint of mixing between human and Neanderthal genomes, while the other found none, but both teams recognized that the data set was not large enough to give a definitive answer. The publication by Noonan, and his team revealed Neanderthal DNA sequences matching chimpanzee DNA, but not modern human DNA, at multiple locations, thus enabling the first accurate calculation of the date of the most recent common ancestor of H. sapiens and H. neanderthalensis. The research team estimates the most recent common ancestor of their H. neanderthalensis samples and their H. sapiens reference sequence lived 706,000 years ago (divergence time), estimating the separation of the human and Neanderthal ancestral populations to 370,000 years ago (split time). Based on the analysis of mitochondrial DNA, the split of the Neanderthal and H. sapiens lineages is estimated to date to between 760,000 and 550,000 years ago (95% CI). Mutations of the speech- related gene FOXP2 identical to those in modern humans were discovered in Neanderthal DNA from the El Sidrón 1253 and 1351c specimens, suggesting Neanderthals might have shared some basic language capabilities with modern humans.

Issues covered by the Bill included giving creators proper credit for their characters and stories, profit-sharing, distribution, fair contracts, licensing, and return of original artwork. The signing of the Bill spurred Cerebus creator and self-publisher Dave Sim and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles creators/self-publishers Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird to sell or continue selling collected volumes of their comics directly to readers via their periodic issues, rather than through direct market distributors selling the collections at comic book specialty shops. Comic book professionals that have commented on the Bill conclude that it had little or no impact on the comic book industry.  History  = Antecedents = Creator's rights has long been a source of conflict in the American comics industry, going back to the medium's late 1930s origins. Creator-owned titles began to appear during the late-1960s underground comix movement, including the publishing collective Cartoonists Co-Op Press, and the Robert Crumb-led United Cartoon Workers of America. Similar movements began in the superhero genre with the mid-1970s creation of the short-lived company Atlas/Seaboard Comics. During the 1970s, superstar artist Neal Adams was politically active in the industry, and attempted to unionize its creative community. In 1978, Adams helped form the Comics Creators Guild, which over three dozen comic-book writers and artists joined, including Cary Bates, Howard Chaykin, Chris Claremont, Steve Ditko, Michael Golden, Archie Goodwin, Paul Levitz, Bob McLeod, Frank Miller, Carl Potts, Marshall Rogers, Jim Shooter, Walt Simonson, Jim Starlin, Len Wein, and Marv Wolfman.\\"The Comics Guild: A Professional Guild to Protect the Rights of Visual Creators: A Report,\\" The Comics Journal #42 (Oct. 1978), pp. 15-17.Groth, Gary. \\"Birth of the Guild: May 7, 1978,\\" The Comics Journal #42 (October 1978), pp. 21-28. Full list of Guild members: Terry Austin, Mike W. Barr, Cary Bates, Rick Bryant, Michael Catron, Howard Chaykin, Chris Claremont, Tony DeZuniga, Steve Ditko, Peter B. Gillis, Michael Golden, Archie Goodwin, Klaus Janson, Joe Jusko, Alan Kupperberg, Paul Levitz, Rick Marschall, Roger McKenzie, Bob McLeod, Frank Miller, Michael Netzer (Nasser), Martin Pasko, Carl Potts, Ralph Reese, Marshall Rogers, Josef Rubinstein, Jim Salicrup, James Sherman, Jim Shooter, Walt Simonson, Roger Slifer, Jim Starlin, Greg Theakston, Len Wein, Alan Weiss, Bob Wiacek, and Marv Wolfman. Around this same period, industry legend Jack Kirby, co-creator of many of Marvel Comics' most popular characters, came into dispute with the company over the disappearance of original pages of artwork from some of his most famous and popular titles.\\"The Artist Waives Any Claim the Artist May Have,\\" The Comics Journal #105 (Feb. 1986), p. 2. (Kirby had quit working for Marvel in 1979, angry over what he perceived as the company's mistreatment of him.)\\"Ploog & Kirby Quit Marvel over Contract Dispute,\\" The Comics Journal #44 (Jan. 1979), p. 11. Best-selling creators like Alan Moore, Frank Miller, and many other stars became vocal advocates for Kirby. Neal Adams also petitioned to have his Marvel originals returned, and the pair won their battle in 1987, when Marvel returned original artwork to him and Kirby, among others.\\"Marvel Returns Art to Kirby, Adams,\\" The Comics Journal #116 (July 1987), p. 15.\\"Neal Adams Receives Art Without Signing Marvel's Short Form,\\" The Comics Journal #116 (July 1987), pp. 15-16. This decision helped lead to the modern industry's standard practice of returning original artwork to the artist, who can earn additional income from art sales to collectors. Alan Moore himself became increasingly concerned at the lack of creator's rights in British comics.Bishop, David. Thrill-Power Overload, p. 105-106 In 1985, he noted that he had stopped working for all British publishers except IPC, publishers of 2000 AD, \\"purely for the reason that IPC so far have avoided lying to me, cheating me or generally treating me like shit.\\" He joined other British creators in decrying the wholesale relinquishing of all rights, and in 1986 stopped writing for 2000 AD as well.Bishop, Thrill-Power Overload, p. 110-111 Moore's outspoken opinions and principles, particularly on the subject of creator's rights and ownership, would see him burn bridges with a number of other publishers over the course of his career.Heidi MacDonald's interview with Moore, 1 November 2005.

First Comics,\\"First Comics Pays Up,\\" The Comics Journal #110 (August 1986), pp. 9-10. and other publishers led to an industry- wide debate about the issue. On the other side, independent publishers of the early 1980s like Pacific Comics and Eclipse Comics were strong promoters of creator-owned properties; their enticement of popular creators (such as Kirby)\\"Jack Kirby Returns to Comics with Cosmic Hero,\\" The Comics Journal #65 (Aug. 1981), p. 23. to their pages helped push the issue to the fore and put pressure on industry giants Marvel and DC. (In fact, in the fall of 1988, shortly before the signing of the Creator's Bill of Rights, DC revised the company's work-for-hire agreements to give more power to individual creators.)\\"New Contracts at DC,\\" The Comics Journal #125 (Oct. 1988), pp. 11-13. = Dave Sim vs Diamond Distributors = The impetus for the creation of the Bill was a dispute between publisher Dave Sim and Diamond Comics Distribution.http://albert.nickerson.tripod.com/creatorsbillofrightssim2.html Sim was motivated to bring together the eventual signatories to the Bill by a 1987 incident surrounding The Puma Blues, a comic book published through his company Aardvark One International. Sim had fallen into dispute with Diamond Comics Distribution over Sim's decision to sell directly to his readership instead of using Diamond to distribute the Cerebus graphic novel High Society. By selling directly to readers and bypassing Diamond and other distributors, Sim made a profit of $100,000. In response, Diamond National Account Representative Bill Schanes informed Sim: \\"If it is your intention to pick and choose which products you want distributors to carry, it should be our privilege to choose what we wish to distribute. Therefore, it is our feeling we should no longer carry and promote Puma Blues.\\"Letters pages, The Puma Blues #15 (February 1988). At that time, Diamond distributed an estimated 33% of the series' print run. (Ironically, Schanes had formerly been publisher of Pacific Comics, itself an extremely creator-friendly publisher.) Sim soon enlisted the support of self-publishers, Mirage Studios founders, and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles creators Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird, both of whom also used Diamond as a distributor. Not including Eastman and Laird, ten of the eventual signatories to the Bill worked for Mirage, including Rick Veitch and Mark Martin. Signatories Gerhard and Michael Zulli worked for Sim. Signatories Richard Pini and Larry Marder were self-publishers. Sim hosted a creators' summit in the spring of 1988 where he spoke out about the issue of publishing and creator's rights.\\"Dave Sim Hosts Toronto Summit,\\" The Comics Journal #124 (July 1988), pp. 16-17.\\"Dave Sim Speaks on Publishing\\" The Comics Journal #124 (July 1988), pp. 6-8. Sim believed that if a consensus could be reached among creators at the summit, he could ethically justify bypassing Diamond and selling directly to readers of Cerebus. = The Northampton Summit = Through a series of meetings, in November 1988 a document was finalized at the \\"Northampton Summit,\\" held in Northampton, Massachusetts, and signed by all in attendance. Scott McCloud was the principal author of the Bill;\\"Creator's Rights\\". The Comics Journal #137 (September 1990), p. 65-71. other artists and writers participating in the Bill's creation included Sim, Steve Bissette, Larry Marder, Rick Veitch, Peter Laird, and Kevin Eastman. An early draft of the Bill was published in the July 1989 issue of The Comics Journal,\\"First Draft of a Bill of Rights for Comics Creators,\\" The Comics Journal #130 (July 1989), p. 126. which had covered the issue thoroughly in its pages over the years.Groth, Gary. \\"Creator vs. Corporate Ownership,\\" The Comics Journal #137 (Sept. 1990), pp. 101-106: on \\"creators' rights,\\" Mark Askwith, Steve Bissette, Steve Saffel, and Bill Sienkiewicz. The Bill's final draft was published in the September 1990 issue of The Comics Journal. According to Sim, the provision of the Bill that affirmed the creator’s right to choose the means of distributing his or her work \\"was the answer that I had been looking for when the process got started. I had the right to choose to sell the High Society trade paperback direct to my own readers. Kevin and Peter promptly published a hardcover of the complete Turtles and sold it direct to their readers, helping to reinforce the point—we have the right to do this.\\" In the aftermath of the Summit, Diamond relented and continued to carry the Puma Blues. In the ensuing years, Sim continued to sell trade paperback collections of Cerebus, of which High Society was one of 16 eventual volumes, directly to readers via ads in Cerebus, Following Cerebus, and the trade paperback collections, until sometime during the publication of Following Cerebus prior to August 2005. Sim has now switched entirely to distribution of the trade paperbacks through the traditional retailers.http://albert.nickerson.tripod.com/creatorsbillofrightssim10.html  Legacy  Many prominent comic book professionals, including some involved in its drafting, hold that the Creator's Bill of Rights had little or no impact on the industry. In 2005, Dave Sim wrote that \\"clearly no one is saluting the Bill of Rights as it stands nor do I really expect them to\\". He added, \\"It seems obvious to me that Steve Bissette and I are the only two of the original participants who are interested in discussing it so I assume everyone else has decided that it was worthless and something to be ashamed of. I’m enough of an egoist that that pushes me in completely the other direction and I suspect the same is true of Steve.\\" Sim wrote that in retrospect he should have been more patient with the retailers and allowed them to distribute High Society, rather than opt for a \\"massive infusion of cash.\\" Steve Bissette reflected in 2005 that \\"the Creator Bill of Rights is still as valid and relevant as ever.\\" However, he lamented that it had received a \\"paucity of attention or discussion since\\" its debut.http://momentofcerebus.blogspot.ca/2013/11/creators-bill-of- rights-25th_21.htmlhttp://www.comicsreporter.com/index.php/briefings/letters/1693/ Scott McCloud, who authored the preliminary draft of the Bill, wrote that \\"[t]he Bill never generated much noise in the industry and I wouldn't want to exaggerate its influence, but it provides an interesting snapshot of our attitudes at the time, and of the climate that was fueling self-publishers, progressive business people, and artists trying to reinvent the comics industry.\\"http://momentofcerebus.blogspot.ca/2013/11/creators-bill-of- rights-25th.htmlhttp://scottmccloud.com/4-inventions/bill/index.html McCloud also said that \\"The Bill got very little play in the comics press...I don’t think that many mainstream publishers gave the Bill much thought at all.\\"http://albert.nickerson.tripod.com/creatorsbillofrightsmccloud.html McCloud did not believe that the Bill influenced the creation of Image Comics. Erik Larsen, an artist, publisher and cofounder of Image Comics, denied that it had any impact on Image Comics or the industry in general, stating that \\"[t]he Creators’ Bill of Rights was always a puzzle to me… Those who drafted and signed it, talk about the Creators’ Bill of Rights as though it’s a document of some historic import, I’ll grant you, but outside of those who signed it—I’ve never had it brought up or even mentioned in passing to me by anybody in the industry.\\" Larsen argued that the signatories did not speak for the wider industry and had no authority to do so. Larsen added \\"I think its impact in the industry is, frankly, minimal at best. Heck, I've never read the darned thing.\\"http://momentofcerebus.blogspot.ca/2013/11/creators-bill-of- rights-25th_19.htmlhttp://albert.nickerson.tripod.com/creatorsbillofrightslarsen2.html According to Denis Kitchen, a cartoonist, publisher, author and agent, and the founder of Kitchen Sink Press and the Comic Book Legal Defense Fund, he and Will Eisner, creator of the Spirit (comics) and also a publisher, did not take the Creator’s Bill of Rights very seriously. Kitchen and Eisner viewed the Bill as \\"sincere\\" and \\"idealistic\\", but \\"at the end of the day… pie-in-the- sky\\".http://albert.nickerson.tripod.com/creatorbillofrightskitchen.htmlhttp://momentofcerebus.blogspot.ca/2013/11/creators- bill-of-rights-25th_20.html Rick Veitch, an artist and signatory to the Bill, said that he was \\"not sure what direct effect the Bill had on the industry. Things were already changing at the big publishers… Maybe the most direct effect was the formation of Tundra by Kevin Eastman. Tundra was originally set up along the Bill's guidelines and wasn't able to make it work.\\"http://albert.nickerson.tripod.com/creatorsbillofrightsveitch.html In 1990, signatory Eastman founded the creator-friendly Tundra Publishing to embody the ideals of the Bill from a publishers' standpoint. As part of the initial group who \\"got together to form the\\" Bill, Eastman felt obligated to expand it beyond theory and into practice, providing a creator-friendly forum for comics creators to work for a publisher while maintaining ownership of their work.Wiater, Stanley & Bissette, Stephen R.

It is Florida's oldest surviving bank building. It is located at Apalachee Parkway and Calhoun Street and is now a museum and archive and research center for African American history. On February 24, 1971, it was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places.  History  The Union Bank building was completed in 1841 as Tallahassee's first bank by William Williams when Florida was still a territory (Florida Territory). It was chartered to help finance local cotton plantations. It closed in 1843 due to the Seminole Wars, unsound banking practices, and the long recession following the Panic of 1837. In 1847, the bank was purchased by cotton plantation owners William Bailey and Isaac Mitchell. After the Civil War, the bank building reopened as the Freedman's Savings and Trust Company in 1868 for emancipated slaves. It later served as a church, feed store, art house, coffee house, dance studio, locksmith's shop, beauty shop, and shoe factory. Willis Jiles Willis Jiles, originally Giles, (1874 - 1963) owned a cobbler shop in the building in the 1920s. Jiles was a graduate of the Tuskegee Institute. His children with wife Sadie graduated from Florida A & M and Xavier University. Relocation In 1971, the bank building was moved from its original site on the west side of Adams Street between College Avenue and Park Avenue, to just east of the Capitol on Apalachee Parkway and Calhoun Avenue where it underwent restoration and was opened as a museum in 1984. Southeastern Regional Black Archives Research Center and Museum The Union Bank building now serves as an extension of the Florida A&M; University Southeastern Regional Black Archives, Research Center and Museum. The site is also known as the Capitol Complex Extension Branch of the Southeastern Regional Black Archives. The museum is open to the public and school groups only on weekdays. Artifacts and documents reflecting black history and culture in Florida are on display, and public programs are provided by Black Archives staff. The main location for the Southeastern Regional Black Archives, Research Center and Museum is located at the Carnegie Library at FAMU.

The song is often sung and published as \\"Soldiers of the Queen\\" depending on the reigning monarch at the time. The tune was originally composed by Stuart as a march celebrating the opening of the Manchester Ship Canal. The lyrics were added at a later date and the title changed. The song was then interpolated in the musical comedy An Artist's Model (1895). The song served as the regimental (quick) march of the Queen's Regiment, 1966–1992. In 1992 the Queens Regiment and Royal Hampshires became the Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment who now use the song Soldiers of the Queen as their regimental song (at the end of the song the Regiment then sing \\"Farmer's boy\\" to show their links to R Hampshire) It is also the regimental march of the combined 2nd and 14th Light Horse Regiment, 2nd/14th Light Horse Regiment (Queensland Mounted Infantry); the Women's Royal Australian Army Corps and the Lord Strathcona's Horse (Royal Canadians), the second most senior of Canada's Cavalry Regiments. It was used as the de facto marchpast of the British Army during the Diamond Jubilee Armed Forces Parade and Muster. The song was sung by the public attending a farewell function in Brisbane, Australia, the day before the departure of the 1st contingent QMI, to the Boer War. It was again sung as the contingent left Brisbane on board S.S. Cornwall on 1 November 1899. It was used as the theme to the film, Breaker Morant. BBC Radio 4 comedy programme The Harpoon, a show lampooning boys' magazines from Britain's Empire days of the 20th century, also used the piece as its opening theme—which is harshly interrupted mid- stanza by a page-turn. The song has no connection to \\"The Soldiers of Our Queen\\", a quite different song which appears in the Gilbert and Sullivan opera Patience.

Canada has multiple ecosystems, ranging from lush forests of British Columbia, the prairies of Western Canada, to the tundra of Northern Canada. With a large land mass, and small population density, the wildlands of Canada provide important habitat for many animals, both endangered and not. Canada is home to approximately 70 000 known species of plants and animals—and perhaps many more that have yet to be discovered. The most threatened wildlife and flora species of Canada are listed in the List of Wildlife Species at Risk in accordance with the Canadian Species at Risk Act. More than 400 species are listed as being at risk of extinction in Canada. The regions with the most endangered or threatened species are those in which humans have had the greatest impact on the environment. Vertebrates =Mammals= Eastern moose Mammals are found in all the regions of Canada. Members of six orders of placental mammals inhabit Canada. They are the bats, carnivores (including the pinnipeds), artiodactyls, cetaceans, insectivores, rodents, and lagomorphs. Additionally, one species of marsupial, the opossum, can now be found in southern Canada. Because of its large wild spaces, Canada is home to many large mammals, some of which have been extirpated in more densely populated areas, for example large predators such as the grey wolf and the brown bear. Well known as \\"Canadian\\" are those mammals that are comfortable in Northern Canada, such as the polar fox, caribou herds, the moose, the wolverine, and muskoxen herds. Other prominent Canadian mammals are the Canada lynx, and the North American beaver, which is a major symbol of Canada. In addition to these native mammals, many Eurasian mammals were introduced (either intentionally or accidentally) by European colonists. Among them are domestic mammals, such as the horse, pig, sheep, dog, cat, and cattle, and wild mammals, such as the brown rat and the house mouse. =Birds= Canada goose Canada's avifauna comprises 462 species, members of seventeen orders of bird. The two most diverse orders are the passerines and the charadriiformes. The most commonly known birds include the Canada goose, snowy owl, and the common raven. Another prominent Canadian bird is the whooping crane, whose only breeding grounds are protected in Wood Buffalo National Park. =Reptiles= Painted turtle hatchling Canada has forty-three species of reptile, including turtles, lizards, and snakes. Of the major types of reptile, only crocodiles are not found in Canada. Canada has twenty-five species of snake, representing three families. Most Canadian snakes are members of the colubrid family, including several species of garter snake. Additionally, the western provinces of Alberta and British Columbia have species of pit viper, such as the western rattlesnake, and British Columbia has Canada's only species of boa, the rubber boa. Canada is home to six species of lizard, all living along the southern border with the United States. Canada also has twelve species of turtle, representing six families. A common turtle in Canada is the painted turtle, which can be found in all ten of Canada's southern provinces, except Newfoundland and Labrador. Nunavut, the Yukon, and Newfoundland & Labrador have no indigenous reptiles. =Amphibians= Green frog :See List of amphibians of Canada. Canada has forty-three types of amphibian, including salamanders as well as frogs and toads. Canada's salamanders are found in all ten provinces, but none live in the three northern territories. Notable salamanders of Canada include the common spotted salamander of eastern Canada, and the rare pacific giant salamander of British Columbia's coastal rainforest. Frogs and toads are found in every region of Canada, though more are found in the south. Canada is home to five families of frogs and toads, including the true frogs, true toads, and tree frogs, which are found in every province and territory (except Nunavut, which only has true frogs), the spadefoots, which are found in the prairie provinces, and the tailed frog, which is found only in British Columbia. =Fish= Canada's rivers are famous for their annual runs of Atlantic salmon on the east coast and Pacific salmon on the west coast. Canada's many freshwater lakes and streams are home to rainbow trout, Arctic char, and brook trout. In the past, invasive species such as the lamprey and zebra mussel have threatened these native species, and while efforts to combat them have been made they still remain a hazard in some areas, and there are ongoing effort to prevent the spread of Asian carp from the United States. There are also significant commercial fisheries of many salt-water species, including Atlantic cod, haddock and halibut, although some of these are in decline. Invertebrates It is estimated that there are about 33,000 species of arthropods in Canada. Due partially to the harshness of its winters, Canada has no native poisonous insects. * List of butterflies of Canada * List of moths of Canada * List of damselflies of Canada * List of dragonflies of Canada See also * Flora of Canada  References  Further reading  Ross, Alexander Milton (1871), The Birds of Canada, Rowsell and Hutchison.

It is situated between the rivers Danube and Tamiš, in Belgrade's municipality of Palilula.  Features  Its wetland was constantly flooded, but since World War II it has been drained part by part and almost half of it has been turned into a very fertile patch of land, suitable especially for cultivating grains and vegetables. It is managed by Serbia's largest agricultural company, \\"PKB Beograd\\", which almost exclusively provides food for 2 million people in the greater Belgrade area; thus Pančevački Rit is commonly nicknamed Granary of Belgrade. Stockbreeding is also very intensive, as are fishery and hunting. Many meandering canals and bogs have remained in the marsh: the slow streams of Vizelj, Dunavac, Sibnica, Butuš, Rogoznica, Buk, Belanoš and Sebeš, and large bogs of Reva, Veliko Blato (), Sebeš and Široka Bara. In the south, the area ends with a river island (ada) Kožara () and the southwest is occupied by the wetland of Beljarica. After 1945, a dense system of canals was dug in the region. They mostly serve for the draining of the marsh, with almost all natural streams being adapted into the draining canals. In time, due to the lack of proper maintenance and their parallel function as the sewage, they became synonymous for pollution, being filled with waste and losing their function. As a result, the flooding of the settlements, especially Krnjača, Kotež and Borča, became regular occurrence during the rainy season. In total, there are of drainage canals, the largest density of agricultural canals in Europe. Of that, are canals in the urbanized zones and are specifically built for the agricultural production in the PKB Beograd company. By 2010, there were two major forested areas in the urbanized section of the region: Danube Forest, along the river's bank () and Rit Forest, in the inland (). At the Timiș mouth, in the southeast corner of the Rit, there is a forested area, the Pančevo Forest. It covers of marshland, with several dozen of deciduous species and 176 species of birds and mammals. In 2020 plans were announced, which include construction of the footbridge across the river, beside two existing traffic bridges, which will connect the forest directly to the town of Pančevo.  Wildlife  The marshland is the natural habitat for the wild boars and Pančevački Rit is the location of the largest population of the wild boars on the territory of Belgrade, and probably in the entire Serbia. They are especially numerous in the area bounded by the Pupin Bridge, Crvenka, Borča and Padinska Skela. In the previous decades, as the settlements expanded, boars' natural roaming paths have been intersected by the houses or roads. As the area is agricultural, they feed on the crops (wheat, corn) and roots, but also on the fish and shells so many are found on the banks of the Danube. In 2020, trees fell by the beavers were spotted in the Krnjača area. Their number began to decline in the second half of the 19th century, almost disappearing by the 1870s. Last specimens in the Pančevački Rit area were spotted in 1900 in Pančevo and in 1902 in Belgrade. Reappearance after 120 years is a result of the successful reintroduction project conducted since 2004 in the Zasavica reserve, some west of Belgrade. Since then, they spread all through the northern and western Serbia and Belgrade surroundings (Obrenovac, Ritopek). There are two official, unfenced hunting grounds in Pančevački Rit. One is named the same way, while the other is called simply Rit. The Rit is located near Padinska Skela, from Belgrade along the Zrenjaninski put. It covers an area of , of which is a pheasantry. Animals bred in the facility include roe deer, hare, quail, mallard, greylag goose and 13,000 pheasants per year.  Neighborhoods and settlements  Unlike the also marshy area of New Belgrade across the Danube, which has been filled and elevated by the construction standards of the day, Pančevački Rit was drained by the canals and protected from the Danube and the Timiș by the embankments. As a result, almost all settlements in it are on wet ground and below the river level, which makes them prone to floods, especially in combination with the chronically clogged drainage system. After being almost uninhabited before 1945, today its population density is above average for Serbia as a whole, since some of the fastest growing suburbs of Belgrade (Borča, Padinska Skela and Krnjača) have been built there.

Politics  Today, there is a proposal that area again become a separate municipality with the name Dunavski Venac. Beginning in the late 1990s, the notion of the area on the left bank of the Danube splitting from the municipality of Palilula had been gaining momentum until in 2005 the Municipal assembly of Palilula finally accepted supporting the move. The proposed new municipality, if accepted and confirmed by the Belgrade City assembly, will have an area of 407 km² and a population of 70-80,000.

Originally published as a series of short stories in The New Yorker, My Sister Eileen was published in book form in 1938, and later adapted under the same name into a play, a radio play (and unproduced radio series), two films, and a CBS television series. It was also the basis for the Leonard Bernstein musical Wonderful Town. Early life Ruth Marguerite McKenney was born in Mishawaka, Indiana on November 18, 1911 to John Sidney McKenney, a mechanical engineer and Marguerite Flynn, a grade school teacher.Indiana, Birth Certificates, 1907-19401920 United States Federal Census Her younger sister, Eileen (born April 3, 1913), later married author Nathanael West.Meade, Marion.

She described herself as \\"homely as a mud fence\\", especially compared to her sister Eileen, though she likely exaggerated for comic effect. She also stuttered.Ruth McKenney, 1938, My Sister Eileen, pg. 95-97 She attempted to commit suicide once during high school but was rescued by Eileen.

She also contributed to the International News Service. Following this, she became a full-time reporter for the Akron Beacon Journal. In 1934, McKenney moved to New Jersey, where she joined the staff of the Newark Ledger. From there, she and Eileen moved to New York City, specifically a moldy, one-room basement apartment near Sheridan Square at 14 Gay Street in Greenwich Village, for which she paid $45 a month () The apartment was burgled within the first week of the six months they lived there. The apartment would become the setting of a series of stories in The New Yorker, later republished in book form as My Sister Eileen (1938)..Meade, pp. 171-186My Sister Eileen, pg. 197 In 1939 McKenney published Industrial Valley, a then-controversial book about the Akron rubber strike (1932–36). She considered it her best work. Her best-selling novel Jake Home (1943) chronicled the struggles of some common Americans between 1900 and 1930. Adaptations of McKenney's works McKenney's book My Sister Eileen has been adapted a number of times for stage, film and television. In 1940, Joseph A. Fields and Jerome Chodorov first adapted My Sister Eileen for Broadway, focusing mostly on the last two chapters of the book detailing Ruth and Eileen's experiences in New York City. (The book mostly concerns their childhood in East Cleveland.) It opened on December 26, 1940 (four days after the death of the Eileen of the title), and ran until January 16, 1943. A film adaptation was made in 1942, directed by Alexander Hall and starring Rosalind Russell as Ruth. Fields and Chodorov later adapted their play into the musical Wonderful Town, with lyrics by Betty Comden and Adolph Green and music by Leonard Bernstein, and starring Rosalind Russell and Edie Adams. It opened on Broadway on February 25, 1953, and ran for 559 performances until July 3, 1954. Since then it has been periodically revived both on and off Broadway. In 1955 a second musical film was written and directed by Richard Quine and starred Betty Garrett, Janet Leigh, and Jack Lemmon, featuring all original songs (none of the Wonderful Town music was used). In 1960-61, My Sister Eileen was adapted as a television series that ran for 26 episodes. In 1956, John Boruff adapted McKenney's novel The Loud Red Patrick for Broadway. It ran for 93 performances from October 3 to December 22 and soon became a favorite of regional theaters. Personal life In 1937, McKenney married fellow writer Richard Bransten (pen name Bruce Minton). McKenney and Bransten were both one-time Communists, although they were purged from the party in 1946. They had a son Paul and a daughter Eileen,Here's England, p. 107 named in memory of Ruth's sister. Eileen Bransten was a New York State Supreme Court justice in Manhattan. In 1939, Ruth's sister Eileen married novelist Nathanael West. Eileen was just 27 when she died in a road accident on December 22, 1940, two years after My Sister Eileen was published and four days before its first stage version opened on Broadway. West, who had run a stop sign, also died in the same accident. On November 18, 1955, Ruth McKenney's 44th birthday, her husband Richard Bransten committed suicide in London.Mervyn Rothstein, \\"Ruth's daughter Eileen remembers her aunt\\", New York Times, December 21, 2003 After this, Ruth McKenney returned to New York City, but stopped writing. \\"My mother never quite recovered from her sister's death\\", Eileen Bransten noted.

Opgezwolle made it to the final of the GPNL where they competed with Raymzter. The jury thought that Raymzter made a better impression and he won the contest. DJ Delic got a prize as \\"Musician of the Evening\\". On the evening before the GPNL final, they presented Spuugdingen op de Mic in Hedon, Zwolle. The album received overall positive reviews from critics. Opgezwolle at Vera, Groningen in 2006 In 2002 Opgezwolle began their \\"Homegrown\\" Tour. They caught the eye of Dutch label TopNotch and in mid-2002 a record deal was signed for three albums. On 5 December 2002 they released Opgeduveld, a collaboration between Opgezwolle and the Rotterdam rap group DuvelDuvel (whose members are Duvel, Rein de Vos and Supahdupah). This CD was also well received. In 2005 it was rereleased in both standard and collectors editions. In 2003, Opgezwolle released Vloeistof/Brandstof, a double-CD, with the second CD being an empty recordable CD. The songs of Brandstof were downloadable from Opgezwolle's website. After performing at many festivals such as Lowlands and the Liberation Day Festival, the initiation of the FC Zwolle Stadion, Planet Rock and the TopNotch Tour, they needed something new and they went back in the recording studio to work with other Dutch MCs like Raymzter, C-mon, Usual Suspects, Duvel, Rein, Pollum, Blabla, Blaxtar, Typhoon and beatmaker Kubus. On 29 November 2004 the most recent CD of Sticks and Kubus hit the stores, named Microphone Colossus. Sticks named the CD after 'Saxophone Colossus', an album by Sonny Rollins. The Buitenwesten Tour with Typhoon, Jawat, Kubus and Duvel went all through the Netherlands and was a great success, with many sold out halls. After a long period of silence from the band, on 23 January 2006 the third Opgezwolle album Eigen Wereld was released. The album features collaborations with other MCs like Pinda, Jawat!, Duvel, Winne en Raymzter. The album contains 21 songs, and almost 70 minutes of music. It reached to number four in the 'Album Top 100', the highest ever chart position of any Dutch rap album. Their tour for this album also received good reviews.

Life and career Tanner began his theatre career as a set-painter and actor and toured early on with Auguste van Biene's company, among others, including as Volteface in The Old Guard. Then he became company manager and stage director. In 1892 he wrote his first play, The Broken Melody, which became a success on tour and internationally for van Biene. By this time, Tanner was directing Gaiety Theatre burlesque productions on tour and sometimes at the Gaiety for van Biene, including Faust up to Date in 1892. Payne and Grossmith in The New Aladdin George Edwardes noticed the versatile Tanner and hired him as a director and \\"show doctor\\" at the Gaiety. He first directed The Baroness for Edwardes, then directed and conceived the innovative musical play In Town (1892), which would help set the fashion for the Gaiety Theatre shows that were to follow. He provided the outline on which Owen Hall would write the book for A Gaiety Girl (1893). He also completed the unfinished burlesque of Don Yuan (1893, with music by Meyer Lutz and lyrics by Adrian Ross), which Fred Leslie had begun to write as a star vehicle for comedian Arthur Roberts but died before finishing, and Tanner also directed the production. Tanner also directed the original Gaiety Theatre production of The Shop Girl (1894) and An Artist's Model (1895) and A Modern Trilby (1895, starring Nellie Farren), both at Daly's Theatre. Tanner's grave in Brookwood Cemetery After that, Tanner focused on writing some of the most popular shows of the period for Edwardes, with music mostly by Ivan Caryll and Lionel Monckton and often lyrics by Adrian Ross and one or the other of the Greenbank brothers, including My Girl in 1896 (with Ross and F. Osmond Carr), The Circus Girl, in 1896, The Ballet Girl in 1897 (with Carl Kiefert and Ross, which he also directed for Broadway), The Transit of Venus in 1898 (with Napoleon Lambelet and Ross), The Messenger Boy in 1900, The Toreador in 1901, A Country Girl in 1902, The Orchid in 1903, The Cingalee in 1904, The New Aladdin in 1906, Our Miss Gibbs in 1919, The Quaker Girl in 1910, The Dancing Mistress in 1912, and The Girl on the Film and The Girl from Utah, both in 1913.

It starred David Janssen, Barbara Rush, Geoffrey Lewis and Bradford Dillman, with a script by Alvin Sapinsley (based on Leslie H. Whitten's novel of the same name). The film was directed by Daniel Petrie and filmed on location in Burnside, Louisiana. All of the downtown footage was from Clinton, Louisiana. Plot In the Louisiana Bayou town of Marsh Island, two farmers (Royal Dano, John Davis Chandler) discover the mauled, dead body of a local young woman. Sheriff Aaron Whitaker (David Janssen) is called. The victim's temperamental brother Lawrence Burrifors (Geoffrey Lewis) arrives at the crime scene and jumps to the conclusion that the girl's lover committed the murder, a man whose name her brother does not know. The town's Dr. Drutan (John Beradino) examines the body and concludes that the girl died from a blow to the head. The sheriff investigates the crime and local residents have a variety of theories, including the belief she was killed by wild dogs. A posse forms to track down the wild dogs with little success. Burrifors continues to insist the killer to be his sister's mysterious lover while the sheriff, in turn, is suspicious of him. The girl's sick and dying father Hugh Burrifors, interviewed by the sheriff, warns him of the \\"Loug Garog\\". The sheriff does not understand the French term. The sheriff's investigation soon takes him to the plantation home of the wealthy Andrew Rodanthe and his sister Louise (Bradford Dillman, Barbara Rush). They are the last of a local family dynasty. Andrew, who the sheriff suspects had an affair with the victim, claims to have been suffering an attack of malaria the night the girl was killed. The sheriff, suspicious of the temperamental brother Lawrence after he assaults the town doctor, who turns out to be the mysterious lover, puts him in jail. While there, the full moon rises again and Lawrence and the sheriff's deputy are killed in a vicious attack after the steel bars of the cell are torn from the wall. With the town's residents fearful and the sheriff without assistance, Andrew Rodanthe volunteers to become deputy. Andrew and the sheriff return to Hugh Burrifor's house and discover the old man has created a voodoo potion that gives off a vapor meant to repel the loup-garou. Rodanthe inhales the potion and goes into what appears to be an epileptic seizure. He is taken to the hospital. While there, Andrew's sister Louise tells the sheriff she can speak French fluently and would talk to Hugh Burrifor about the unexplainable term \\"Loug Garog\\". While speaking with the old man, Louise solves the puzzle. \\"Loug Garog\\" is a mispronunciation of \\"Loup Garou\\". Translated into English the term means \\"werewolf\\". Transformed into a werewolf, Andrew violently escapes the hospital and becomes the subject of a manhunt. As a posse gathers, Louise runs to the mayor, telling him that her brother is sick and that there are drugs that can help him. At her and Andrew's home, Louise talks to Sheriff Whitaker about werewolf folklore. She reveals a family secret, that her grandfather used to suffer from unusual spells of sickness, implying he was also a werewolf and Andrew's curse was inherited. Louise returns to her plantation home alone and Andrew, still in his werewolf form, enters the house. Louise flees to the barn. When the werewolf follows she attempts to set him afire, then returns to the house. Andrew escapes the fire and pursues Louise. She eventually shoots him just as the sheriff returns. After he dies, Andrew returns to his human form.

They attracted a strong British cult following but were not able to translate this into any lasting success, producing just two full studio albums in the early 1980s. Ex- member Stevie Young brought in some attention to the group after he joined the hard rock band AC/DC in 2014. (Stevie Young is the nephew of AC/DC leaders Malcolm and Angus Young). Career Initially called Savage (named after the original lead vocalist, Phil Savage), the founding members, Stevie Young and Barry Spencer Scrannage changed the band's name to Starfighters and released the single, \\"Heaven and Hell\\" (A-side) and \\"I'm Falling\\" (B-side), on the independent record label, Motor City Rhythm Records. A further two single were recorded and produced in 1980, prior to the band winning their support slot, but were never released. This line-up consisted of Steve Burton (vocals), Pat Hambly (guitar) Stevie Young (guitar), Doug Dennis (bass) and Barry Spencer Scrannage (drums, born 1954 in Smethwick and formerly in Glenn Tipton's pre Judas Priest band Shave 'Em Dry). They were then signed up by Jive Records (a part of Zomba). They then won a support slot with AC/DC on their 1980 'Back in Black' tour, during which, Barry Spencer Scrannage left following the death of close personal friend, John Bonham), his position was later filled by Steve Bailey. Signing up with Krokus manager Butch Stone, in 1983 they released the follow-up album, In-Flight Movie, again produced by Tony Platt. Jive however were not prepared to pay for further tour promotions, and the band resorted to appearing in small British clubs. Despite receiving good reviews and publicity, particularly in Kerrang! magazine, this album did no better and Jive dropped them. The band consequently folded. In 1987, the band reformed with the line-up of Burton (vocals), Young (guitars), Rik Sandford (guitars), Redvers (bass) and Jamie Hawkins (drums). Redvers had been known as Steve Hill up to this point, but was rechristened with his middle name, to avoid the confusion of having three 'Steves' in the band. Despite attracting a strong local following in Birmingham, they could not secure another recording contract, and the band folded after little more than a year. Sandford and Hawkins had very brief stints with UFO and Hawkwind respectively. Redvers became Steve Redvers and joined The Grip, before linking up with Young and Ian Charles (Chaz) in Little Big Horn. Starfighters reformed again for a one off show on 10 November 2006 at 'The Roadhouse' in South Birmingham to raise money for charity, with the line-up of Burton (vocals), Young (guitars and vocals), Hambly (guitars), Dennis (bass and vocals) and Tony Bayliss (drums). Scrannage played with Ozzy Osbourne and stayed at Osbourne's house in 1979, was briefly in the band Bullion with original Judas Priest members Ernie Chataway and Bruno Stapenhill and, as of 2008, worked as an actor and used to run the Rock Tavern in Hill Street, Brierley Hill. As of January 2015, Burton is fronting Birmingham blues band Vincent Flatts Final Drive. When bassist Doug Dennis died in 2011, the remaining Starfighters reformed to play at his wake with Stevie Young's son Angus on bass. In May 2014, Stevie Young replaced his uncle Malcolm Young for the recording of a new AC/DC album and tour.

This telenovela lasted 325 episodes and was distributed internationally by Venevisión International. Karina and Víctor Cámara starred as the protagonists with Joanna Benedek as the antagonist. Synopsis While still an adolescent, Consuelo Sanchez gets pregnant by her boyfriend, Adolfo Alamo. She soon finds out, however, that Adolfo is married to a rich alcoholic named Marisela, and that they have three children: Junior, Andreina and Rosalia. In spite of this, Consuelo goes ahead with her pregnancy and gives birth to a girl. But Consuelo's mother, Blanca, takes the baby away from her and abandons her at a small house in the city slums. This situation prompts Consuelo to leave home, determined to never see or speak to her mother again. The owner of the house, Carmen Rosa Barrios, takes in the abandoned baby, names her Rosa and raises her as her own. Many years later, Blanca, Rosa's real grandmother, unaware of the relationship between them, hires Carmen and Rosa as maids at a students’ residence managed by her. A series of events link the young people living at the boarding house with Rosa and her past. Mildred, an outstanding philosophy student, becomes Rosa's best friend. Alejandro Marquez, Rosalia Alamo’s fiance, falls in love with Rosa. A child is born of their relationship, but the scorned Rosalia manages to convince Alejandro that the baby's father is actually her brother, Junior Alamo. Meanwhile, Rosa's real mother, Consuelo, is living with Isaias Pena, a heavy drinker in need of counseling. When Consuelo takes Isaias to a meeting of Alcoholics Anonymous, she meets Marisela, not knowing that she is Adolfo Alamo's wife. This friendship leads to a surprise encounter between Consuelo and her teenage love, Adolfo, who is the father of her lost child... and to a dangerous rekindling of that old flame. Destiny also puts Consuelo in touch with Rosa. Without knowing that they are mother and daughter, they develop a very special, loving relationship. Later on, it is Consuelo who opens Rosa's eyes about what is happening in her life; she tells her that Junior and Rosalia, who have hurt her so much, are actually her half siblings, and that she is not Carmen's daughter but her own. Everyone endures deep suffering until Adolfo has a heart-to-heart talk with Rosa, and together they force Blanca to confess that she in fact took Rosa away from her mother and abandoned her at Carmen's house. Junior, ill with a terminal cancer also confesses to Alejandro that he was never Rosa's lover, and therefore not her baby's father. Adolfo convinces Marisela to give him a divorce, because he is still in love with Consuelo. Upon Junior's death, Rosa forgives Rosalia for her cruel schemes, and they finally accept each other as sisters; Alejandro and Rosa come together again, as well as Consuelo and Adolfo, and everyone prepares to forget the past and start a new life.

Plot A young and reckless criminal, Jim (Don Durant), stows away on his brother Chris Johnston's (Bill Cord) boat after killing two men interrupting his gun running. As they sail out to the Sulu Sea they are caught in a terrible storm and are shipwrecked off a beautiful island that is inhabited by a secretive all female village of pearl divers. Though the lonely and beautiful women of the island are friendly and flirtatious with the two brothers (the only remaining survivors), the village elder Queen Pua (Jeanne Gearson) is cautious and hostile, wanting the two off the island as soon as possible. Chris falls in love with one of the island beauties, Mahia (Lisa Montell), while Jim, being a wanted man, seeks to escape before the naval ship sent to rescue them arrives. Terrified of being recognized and executed for his crimes, Jim fixes one of the islanders' broken boats and lets his brother and his forbidden love in on his plan. But before they can leave, the black- hearted criminal is overcome by greed and steals the islanders' precious pearls, injuring a native in the process. Once out to sea Chris discovers what his sibling has done and tries to stop him in a fight on some jagged rocks.

It is located on the Whitemouth River, at the junction of Highway 15 and Highway 11 in the Rural Municipality of Whitemouth. History The area settlement was known as Janow, after the name of its post office. This was a name settled on between the store owner, John Giliewich, and the post office inspector. The preferred name Yaroriw was turned down as the inspector thought there might be difficulty with name. After the railway was built the name changed to Elma. Its name is said to have originated from a man named Thomas Koivu and his wife Maria, who worked for the CPR and had a baby who was named Elma (1905). And so, Elma became the name that the town all decided on, though it is more likely the name was given when the National Transcontinental Railway (a predecessor of the Canadian National Railway) was built through the area in 1905. It was common for small railroad towns to be named by the railroad engineers or other planners. Elma Station was demolished in the late 1960s and a small rail station (hut) was used frequently by people going to isolated cabins in the eastern Whiteshell and North Western Manitoba. The station hut was removed in 2014 by Canadian National Railways. Its population is approximately 90 full-time residents. This grows during the summer as many people have small cabins for summer use. The Community Club is active and opens for private and community functions and rentals. Elma is central to a large recreational area. Agassiz Forest, Sandilands, Lakes of the Whiteshell, Snowmobile trails, and whitewater canoeing, kayaking, are all within a few minutes drive. Property costs in S.E. Manitoba are lower than areas to the North, North East and West of the City of Winnipeg. The town of Whitemouth, a 7-minute drive from Elma, has several conveniences such as a clinic, dentist, pharmacy, hardware store, convenience store, school, RCMP station, Credit Union, Insurance Agency. The biggest employers in the area are the Canadian National Railways, Sun Gro Horticulture Income Fund, and Seer Logging. A Hemp plant 25 minutes from Elma is starting up in 2019/2020 and is expected to employ up to 200 workers.https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/botanist- organic-hemp-cbd-pineland-1.5030508 Many residents commute to Winnipeg or Beausejour for work. There were several debates in the town over sewer and water being installed over the years. In 2010 a bid by the RM of Whitemouth was quashed by the courts. Most of the residentially funded opposition was due to the large cost, on average 20,000 dollars per property, Under an updated Provincial Order in September 2010 some commercial properties as much as $100,000, In the Fall of 2011, the RM of Whitemouth installed a municipal water pipeline (originating in Seven Sisters, 35 Kilometres away) for those residents who wanted it. The costs were to be shared between those people and a small government grant. Costs averaging 13,000 dollars per household. As of 2018, the Municipality passed a bylaw requiring homeowners to hire their own contractor to install water service. It is expected to be lower than the Municipal original charge. A recent report (August 2019) noted a significant amount of treated water was unaccounted for from the local water utility (Estimated 55,000 Cubic Meters in 2018.) This was reportedly corrected. A new home building incentive forgiving municipal taxes for two years was instituted in 2014. Many people have used this incentive. A report by the Whitemouth Reynolds Planning District (2018) states there has been an overall population decline over the preceding fifteen years. To encourage new builds and residents to come into the area subdivisions for residential purposes may be permitted, and there have been some subdivisions already made suitable for new builds. Some restrictions limiting where new builds can go are land cleared or improved for agricultural purposes, and areas where wildlife may be impacted. The proposed lot should be a minimum of 2 acres in size and have direct access to a municipal road or highway. Elma has several town lots ready for new builds. Elma did not have any reliable Cellphone Service until September 2019 when the old microwave tower in Whitemouth was retrofitted with (Bell MTS) cell equipment. Elma residents report between 2 and 5 bars depending on location and provider. Another tower is being built 29 Km to the West in St. Rita in the next couple of years. This will complete coverage along Highway 15.

His approach is in particular directed against technological determinism and instead proposes that the emergence of new media and new technologies is mediated and controlled by society.

For most of the community’s history, La Broquerie has been ranked as Manitoba’s largest dairy producer. A distinctive display at the south entrance to the community features a moderately sized, decorative cow. The area's geography makes it attractive to winter sports. One can snowmobile and cross-country ski along the nature trails in the town as well as throughout the entire Sandilands Provincial Forest area. The community also has a golf course, La Verendrye Golf, named after the family of 18th century explorers. The St. Joachim Museum contains historic artifacts pertaining to the history of the French and Belgian settlers since 1877.  Sports  Hockey is a huge part of life in La Broquerie and has been for 60 years. In the early 1950s, local residents spent months cutting and logging wood for the building of a new arena. The arena was built by hand with the help of countless local volunteers. Over the years, the arena burnt down on three occasions, and on all three occasions, local residents lobbied local businessmen and different levels of government to rebuild it.

The most commercially successful and widely known version to date is the 1968 US Top 10 hit by The Human Beinz, which was their only chart success. The Isley Brothers The Isley Brothers' original version, released as a single on Wand 131, failed to make the pop or R&B; charts. The Human Beinz The song was covered by Youngstown, Ohio's The Human Beinz and made them one-hit wonders after the song reached number eight on the Billboard pop singles chart in 1968. It was included on some versions of Lenny Kaye's Nuggets compilation. Dave Marsh, in his Book of Rock ListsDell, October 1981, named the version by the Human Beinz \\"The most negative song to hit the Top 40,\\" noting that the word \\"no\\" is sung over 100 times in a mere 2:16. Marsh also counts the word \\"nobody\\" 46 times more; he adds \\"for balance, they throw in the word Yeah once\\". Other versions, uses, and appearances Liverpool group The Mojos released an early version in 1964 (The Mojos EP, Decca Records). Experimental group The Residents sampled this song in the track \\"N-Er-Gee (Crisis Blues)\\" from their 1974 album Meet the Residents. The French group The Dogs recorded a version in 1979 included in the album Different. George Thorogood and the Destroyers would later record a version more faithful to the Human Beinz cover than to the Isleys' original, and released it on 1982's Bad to the Bone. Canadian band Doug and the Slugs released their own cover of the single in 1983. The L.A. punk band the Dickies also recorded a lightning-fast version of the song on their 1998 all-covers album, Dogs from the Hare that Bit Us. Garage/punk musician Nobunny reworked the song for his track \\"Nobunny Loves You\\". A lip-dub of the Human Beinz version was also used in the cold open of the seventh season of the American TV series The Office first episode \\"Nepotism\\", featuring all the characters of the show.

It is located west of Brandon along the Trans-Canada Highway. The lake after which it was named is in the rural municipality's western area. During the late 19th century, the area around Oak Lake was a popular stopping point for fur traders and settlers due to the large number of big oak trees (revered for their strength) located around the lake that could be used to repair their wagons. In the fall of 1881, work crews on the transcontinental Canadian Pacific Railway had reached Flat Creek to the east of the current townsite. In the spring they moved the camp west and built a siding and station (now long gone) where the community's flags and flower garden are now located.  Geography and climate  The area around Oak Lake is dominated by the Assiniboine River, the nearby lake by the same name, areas of flat farm land, and to the north, large, rolling hills left by receding glaciers. Oak Lake's location in the middle of the Canadian prairies means that Oak Lake experiences an extreme continental climate. The area is known for its long, cold winters owing to its northerly location. There is often much snowfall during the winter, with the possibility for blizzards that can drop in excess of 35 cm (~14 inches) of snow at once, which can be blown into drifts that are much deeper. The community can be cut off for a day or more while snow is cleared from the highways. Temperatures during the coldest winter months of December, January and February can reach -35 °C (-31 °F), though colder temperatures occasionally occur. Windchills during the winter can reach as cold as -45 °C (-49 °F), making outdoor activity difficult on those days. The average winter temperature is a more moderate -12 °C (10.4 °F). Winters are often characterized by extreme shifts in temperature with near 0 °C (32 °F) changing to frigid temperatures within the span of a few days. Summers are often very warm with the possibility of temperatures in excess of 35 °C (95 °F), though the average summer temperature is 26 °C (78.8 °F). Year round, Oak Lake has an abundance of clear, sunny skies.  Economy  The Post Office building in Oak Lake, constructed in 1930. The economy of the Oak Lake area is dominated by farming, although nearby Virden has a booming oil economy. The rural municipality office is located in Oak Lake, which employs a handful of people to manage the running of public services. Other employers include the Valleyview CO-OP grocery store, Golden Embers restaurant, Dandy's confectionery, and several smaller, personal businesses. Basic groceries and household items can be purchased from the Co-op. Other locations for shopping are Virden, 15 minutes away, Brandon, 30 minutes away, and for rare items, Winnipeg and Minot each 2½ hours away. Oak Lake has the seasonal Dandy's Drive In and Golden Embers. Virden and Brandon have a number of casual and fine dining restaurants as well.

While attending SFAI with George Kuchar as her mentor, Jacobson began making I Was a Teenage Serial Killer Jacobson's two most well known works are I Was a Teenage Serial Killer and Mary Jane's Not a Virgin Anymore. Both were well received at film festivals across North America such as the New York Underground Film Festival, the Chicago Underground Film Festival and Sundance. I Was a Teenage Serial Killer featured songs by Heavens to Betsy. She was listed in Spin as one of the \\"Top Influences on Girl Culture\\". Also outspoken in their praise were film critic Roger Ebert, filmmaker Allison Anders, and Kim Gordon of Sonic Youth. Ed Halter, writing in the Village Voice, considered I Was A Teenage Serial Killer \\"a key film of that decade's angrily subversive underground cinema\\". Jacobson was the author of the progressive S.T.I.G.M.A. Manifesto (Sisters Together in Girlie Movie-Making Action).https://www.flavorwire.com/478486/50-underground-filmmakers-everyone- should-know Jacobson was interviewed, reviewed, and written about in national publications like The New York Times, Village Voice, Spin, Bust, and Film Threat, among others. Mary Jane's Not a Virgin Anymore Her low budget feature film Mary Jane's Not a Virgin Anymore and the grassroots manner in which Jacobson promoted the film garnered her much recognition in her specific field. Mary Jane's Not a Virgin Anymore starred Lisa Gerstein and Beth Allen of the band The Loudmouths, whose music—along with that of Babes In Toyland and Mudhoney—is featured in the film. Jello Biafra also appears in a cameo role. Film Threat, in its Film Threat Video Guide, labelled it as one of the \\"25 Underground Films You Must See\\". Following the release of this film, Jacobson directed videos for the bands Man or Astroman and Fluffy.

She was a contributor to the film zine Joanie4Jackie, a project created by Miranda July to showcase women's independently made and DIY films. Jacobson was also a participant in DiY Fest, a do-it-yourself travelling film festival. “Everyone talks about living in the post #MeToo era,” says Jacobson’s friend Jake Fogelnest. “Here was a woman who made films in the ’90s; who was screaming about that stuff in her work and in her life before it became a fashion accessory button at a Hollywood awards ceremony.”http://www.citypages.com/arts/remembering-sarah-jacobson-the-badass- filmmaker-that-brought-riot-grrrl-sensibility-to-theaters/566790221 Death Jacobson died from endometrial cancer in New York City on February 13, 2004, aged 32.

The dam and reservoir in Rapid City were built by the province in 1961, the reservoir stores and provides a water supply and recreational facility for the community.  History  In the 1870s as the railroad expanded, settlers were drawn to the area to build their homes and set up their businesses. The community was originally called Rolston's Colony (after John Rolston, an early settler). Around 1877 it was decided to rename the community Rapid City. Since the community was on the banks of the Little Saskatchewan River and it was a \\"rapid stream\\" they chose \\"rapid\\" and \\"city\\" reflecting the optimism of those early settlers. During the 1880s many awaited the arrival of the Canadian Pacific Railway lines Canadian transcontinental railway that would bring with it a certain building boom. While people assumed that the projected northerly route away from Portage la Prairie, Manitoba would take it through Rapid City and its narrow river crossing, the route suddenly changed to a more westerly route. This brought it through the location of present-day Brandon, resulting in the boom and growth of that city.

Babler Memorial State Park) is a state-managed public recreation area located in the northwest section of the city of Wildwood, Missouri. A large bronze statue of Dr. Babler greets park visitors. The state park's offer opportunities for hiking, picnicking, bicycling, horseback riding, and camping. The park was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. History The park was created in memory of Edmund A. Babler, who was born on October 11, 1874, in Appleton City, Missouri. He graduated from Missouri Medical College, now known as Washington University Medical School, in 1898, became a general surgeon, developed a large private practice in St. Louis. The stories say that he spent the majority of his time devoting himself to charity cases and took much pride in his work for the unfortunate. His premature death at age 55 from pneumonia was a source of great sadness for his admirers and family. His funeral was one of the largest ever held in St. Louis. Moved by the public sympathy and respect, Edmund's brother Jacob L. Babler began searching for a way to preserve his brother's memory. Being a successful business graduate from St. Louis Law School, known today as Washington University, he had extensive investments in farm land and real estate. On August 20, 1930, Jacob Babler and his younger brother Henry Babler gave 868 acres of land to the State of Missouri, to be named the Dr. Edmund A. Babler Memorial State park. These were difficult and trying times in the world, and although they continued to give more land to the state between 1934 and 1936, Jacob had to seek the help of friend John J. Cochran, Congressman, in order to obtain federal aid for the state in order to develop the park. This aid came in the form of designating two Civilian Conservation Camps (CCC) to be stationed within the park to develop the property. With the help of Conrad Wirth, Director of the National Park System, plans were developed to establish a trust fund that would support construction, maintenance, and operations at the park. A state bill was passed to formally accept the land and was signed by Governor Lloyd Stark on June 23, 1937. The park was formally dedicated on October 1, 1938 at a ceremony in which Harold Ickes, Secretary of the Interior, spoke before an assembly of 3,500 guests. This was when the statue of Dr. Babler was unveiled in its current location. Jacob Babler continued throughout the rest of his life to support the park dedicated to his brother, and the Missouri State Park system as a whole. He sponsored a proposal before the Constitution Convention of 1944, resulting in a fund developed to earmark $400,000 a year for 15 years to be used to acquire and develop additional land in the Missouri State Park System. Overcoming the lull of park development during the Great Depression and World War II, some of our most popular Missouri State Parks were acquired and developed between 1946 and 1960. Jacob L. Babler's support of the park system earned him the title of \\"Father of Missouri's State Parks\\". Activities and amenities The park offers several hiking trails, paved bicycle trail, equestrian trail, campground, and picnicking areas.

Anne was the first parish established in the area, dating back to 1856, when the territory was a part of Rupert's Land. The early settlers, French-speaking Habitants from Canada East, arrived looking for farmland. The first 198 families in the community busied themselves with their first major industry, supplying lumber for the construction of the St. Boniface Cathedral. The Hudson's Bay Company also had a strong presence in the community in the 1800s. Ste. Anne served as a stopover for weary travelers on their journey to Winnipeg, along the famed Dawson Trail. In June 1959, Ste. Anne experienced the worst flood in its history. Water rose at a rate visible by eye, and the Ste. Anne Hospital was evacuated. In 1960, the Seine River diversion project was completed to prevent future floods.  Geography and climate  Ste. Anne is situated just east of the longitudinal centre of Canada (near the geographical centre of North America), and approximately north of the border with the United States.

The sixth tropical storm and first hurricane of the season, Ernesto developed from a tropical wave on August 24 in the eastern Caribbean Sea. Ernesto first affected the northern Caribbean, reaching minimal hurricane status near Haiti before weakening and moving across eastern Cuba as a tropical storm. Despite initial predictions for it to track through the eastern Gulf of Mexico as a major hurricane, Ernesto moved across eastern Florida as a weak tropical storm. After turning to the northeast, it re- intensified and made landfall on August 31 on the North Carolina coast just below hurricane status. Late the next day, Ernesto became extratropical after entering southern Virginia. The remnants spread moisture across the northeastern United States before dissipating over eastern Canada on September 4. The deaths of at least eleven people were attributed to Ernesto, which dumped heavy rains throughout its path, especially in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States. While moving across the Caribbean, it affected several countries, and initially Ernesto posed a threat to the Gulf Coast of the United States around the one-year anniversary of Hurricane Katrina. Damage in Virginia was estimated at over $118 million (2006 USD), prompting the declaration of a federal disaster area. Total damage in the United States was estimated at $500 million (2006 USD). Meteorological history On August 18, a tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa. It tracked westward, and its convection began organizing and concentrating on August 22. The next day, convection increased along the wave axis, and Dvorak classifications from the Tropical Analysis and Forecast Branch of the National Hurricane Center began at 1200 UTC on August 23. As it approached the Lesser Antilles, a surface low developed, and with the confirmation of a closed low-level circulation from the Hurricane Hunters, it is estimated the system developed into Tropical Depression Five on August 24 about north-northwest of Grenada. Located to the south of a ridge across the southwestern Atlantic Ocean, the depression tracked west-northwestward through an area of dry air and westerly wind shear. Despite the shear, convection intensified near the center as banding features improved, and on August 24, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Ernesto. Convection deepened and expanded, though wind shear displaced the low-level center to the west of the convection. By August 26, the structure had become much better-defined, and within five days Ernesto was forecast to be located about 275 mi (445 km) south of the Gulf Coast of the United States as a powerful hurricane. The center reformed under the deepest convection after wind shear decreased, and at the same time outflow increased in all quadrants. Turning northwestward, a small eye formed, and early on August 27 Ernesto attained hurricane status about south-southwest of the border between Haiti and the Dominican Republic. Infra-red animation of Tropical Storm Ernesto making landfall in South Florida on August 29 Upon becoming a hurricane, Ernesto was believed to be undergoing rapid intensification. However, the small inner core deteriorated as the circulation interacted with the mountainous terrain of southwest Haiti, and it quickly weakened back to tropical storm status. The center became broad and ill-defined, though it was forecast to re-intensify to hurricane status before striking Cuba. It continued to weaken due to land interaction, and early on August 28 Ernesto passed just offshore of the southwestern tip of Haiti with winds of . Hindered by increased wind shear from an upper-level low over the Bahamas, the storm weakened further before striking just west of Guantánamo Bay in Cuba as a minimal tropical storm. With very warm water temperatures and a favorable upper-level environment, one forecast remarked the possibility of Ernesto strengthening greatly over the Straits of Florida and eastern Gulf of Mexico to hit western Florida as a major hurricane. Ernesto remained over land as a minimal tropical storm for about 18 hours before reaching the Straits of Florida. Convection gradually increased over the warm waters, though Ernesto failed to strengthen significantly due to its disrupted inner core. An eastward-moving high pressure system over the southeastern United States allowed a continued northwest movement, and at 0300 UTC on August 30 the storm struck Plantation Key in the upper Florida Keys with winds of . Two hours later, Ernesto made landfall on the Florida mainland in southwestern Miami- Dade County. Atlantic coast on August 31 Moving through a weakness in the subtropical ridge, the storm turned to the north through the state. Operationally, the National Hurricane Center downgraded Ernesto to tropical depression status while over the state, though post-analysis indicated the system maintained tropical storm status. Ernesto retained a well-organized cloud pattern over land, and after emerging over the Atlantic Ocean near Cape Canaveral, convection again increased and began wrapping into the circulation. Upon reaching the Atlantic Ocean, Ernesto accelerated north-northeastward ahead of an approaching deep layer trough. The convection increased as the storm strengthened over warm waters, and late on August 31 Ernesto attained an intensity of while located about south-southwest of Wilmington, North Carolina. Shortly prior to moving ashore, an eye began to develop, and early on September 1 the storm made landfall on Oak Island, North Carolina very near the threshold between tropical storm and hurricane status. The National Hurricane Center remarked the possibility that Ernesto could have been a hurricane at landfall, due to the possibility that the strongest maximum wind was not sampled. After landfall the storm rapidly weakened, and about eight hours after moving ashore, Ernesto deteriorated to tropical depression status. Interacting with a pre-existing frontal zone that extended eastward through Virginia, Ernesto quickly lost its tropical characteristics, and late on September 1 it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone. It re-intensified to a gale over the Mid-Atlantic states, only to weaken to an extratropical depression near Pennsylvania. With a large high pressure area to its east, the remnants turned to the north-northwest, reaching southern Ontario on September 3. After turning northeastward, the extratropical remnants of Ernesto were absorbed into a larger storm over Quebec on September 4. Preparations =Caribbean= About nine hours after Ernesto became a tropical storm, the government of Haiti issued a tropical storm watch from its border with the Dominican Republic to the southwestern tip of the country. As the storm strengthened, the watch was replaced with a tropical storm warning, and about 15 hours prior to its closest approach the warning was replaced with a hurricane warning. Several low-lying citizens in Gonaïves were evacuated after local meteorologists anticipated up to 20 inches (500 mm) of rain in some mountainous areas. Additionally, authorities advised residents in shanty towns near the ocean to evacuate to emergency shelters. Jamaican officials issued radio and television advisories for residents in low-lying areas, urging them to be ready and evacuate if necessary. The Jamaican government opened all shelters on the island and placed its armed forces on standby. Long lines for storm supplies were reported at local businesses ahead of the storm as residents rushed to obtain supplies in preparation for Ernesto's onslaught. When a tropical storm warning was put in effect for Jamaica and the central Bahamas, cruise ship companies indicated they were diverting several liners to avoid the storm. Hurricane warnings were put in effect for six provinces in southeastern Cuba, where significant precipitation ranging up to 20 inches (500 mm) across the mountainous south was expected as the center of Ernesto tracked slowly across Cuba. Cuban officials evacuated 300,000 people and brought its fishing fleet into harbors. The Cuban state television broadcast extensive warnings about the storm, urging precautions. Cattle were moved to higher ground, tourists were evacuated from hotels in the southeastern province of Granma, and baseball games scheduled for the evening of August 27 in Havana were played earlier in the day. The threat of the storm caused domestic flights to be canceled. =United States= Atlantis heads back to Launch Pad 39B to ride out Ernesto National watch and warning map showing flash flood watches and coastal flood warnings throughout the Mid-Atlantic and Southeastern United States. On August 26, about four days prior to Ernesto striking the state, the government of Florida activated its Emergency Operations Center, while the National Guard was placed on standby, following a \\"warning order\\" to its commanders. On August 27, the Governor of Florida, Jeb Bush, issued a state of emergency because of the high risk of impact from Ernesto on the state. Officials issued a mandatory evacuation order for all visitors and non-residents in the Florida Keys about three days before the storm passed through the area. Mandatory evacuations were later issued for mobile homes and low-lying areas of Monroe, Broward, St. Lucie, and Martin counties; voluntary evacuations were also issued for barrier islands in Miami- Dade and Palm Beach counties. On August 28, forecasters issued a hurricane watch for southern Florida through the Florida Keys. When Ernesto was downgraded to tropical storm status, Governor Jeb Bush urged Florida residents to continue preparations and not wait until it regained hurricane status, as it was forecast to do by the National Hurricane Center. At least 30 shelters were opened, and tolls on four turnpike were lifted. Several schools were closed across southern Florida. The threat of the storm caused NASA to postpone the launch of Space Shuttle Atlantis at Kennedy Space Center to avoid risking damage from the storm. The storm was initially expected to move into the Gulf of Mexico and affect people recovering from hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma in the previous year, which caused hundreds of billion in damage and left thousands of houses damaged or destroyed. There were initial fears that Ernesto would make landfall days after Hurricane Katrina's one-year anniversary, and that the levees in New Orleans might not be able to withstand a strong storm surge. Officials in New Orleans prepared buses and trains in the event that people needed to evacuate but could not. A possible path over the Gulf of Mexico oil fields, as well as tension with Iran, caused the price of oil to increase, although the prices receded when the threat of the storm receded. On August 29, a hurricane watch was issued from the mouth of the Altamaha River in Georgia to Cape Fear, North Carolina. The next day, the watch was replaced with a tropical storm warning, which was later extended to Currituck Beach Light in Corolla, North Carolina before the storm moved ashore. In South Carolina, voluntary evacuations occurred in Charleston and Colleton counties. On August 31 before the storm's arrival, Virginia Governor Tim Kaine declared a state of emergency, putting the Virginia National Guard and state agencies on alert and opening the state's new Emergency Operations Center in suburban Richmond. North Carolina Governor Mike Easley activated 200 National Guard troops and had other emergency teams on standby. Washington D.C. and parts of Maryland and Delaware were put on a Coastal Flood Watch and Flash Flood Watch by the National Weather Service in preparation for Ernesto. Impact =Caribbean= Total rainfall in Puerto Rico from Ernesto Shortly before Ernesto developed into a tropical cyclone, the precursor tropical wave produced sustained winds of in Barbados in association with a convective downburst. On the island, the winds downed some trees, and some flooding was reported. Strong winds and rough seas damaged six fishing boats in the southern portion of the island. Squalls in Trinidad left about 12 people injured after winds destroyed several tents. Also on Trinidad, the system produced widespread flooding, which resulted in some crop damage. Puerto Rico experienced peripheral rainfall from the cyclone as it tracked through the eastern Caribbean Sea. A two-day storm total of 4.69 inches (119 mm) occurred in Sabana Grande. In the Dominican Republic, heavy rainfall caused river flooding and mudslides, resulting in damage to several houses. The highest rainfall report noted was 7.01 inches (178 mm) at Barahona. The rainfall also downed trees, and caused flooding to enter over 400 houses near Santo Domingo, which forced the evacuation of over 1,600 people. In Haiti, the storm caused heavy rainfall of over 11 inches (300 mm) and strong winds, causing flooding and destroying 13 homes on the island of La Gonave. In Port-au-Prince, rainfall severely damaged a bridge, isolating the southern portion of the region. Across the country, 59 homes were damaged, of which six destroyed, and a total of five deaths were reported. Ernesto produced heavy rainfall in eastern Cuba, with Guantánamo reporting 3 inches (75 mm) in four hours. Gusty winds left some towns in the Camagüey Province without power, though overall damage was minor. There were no reports from Cuba of deaths, injuries, or major damage attributed to the storm. =Southeastern United States= Ernesto Rainfall for United States In the Florida Keys, Ernesto produced tropical storm force wind gusts and light rainfall, causing minor flooding. Upon making landfall in southern Florida, the storm produced a storm tide of about 1 foot (0.3 m) above astronomical tide levels, though no beach erosion was reported. Winds were fairly minor across the state, reaching at a station on Lake Okeechobee. Ernesto dropped heavy rainfall across southwest Florida, with a state maximum of 8.72 inches (221 mm) recorded at South Golden Gate. The rainfall caused the Fisheating Creek to overflow, and some flooding also occurred in portions of Collier County. Floodwaters entered at least 13 homes in Palmdale. The storm resulted in more than 150 canceled flights at Orlando International Airport, stranding several travelers. While moving through the state, Ernesto spawned two F0 tornadoes in Osceola County. One person died in each in Broward and Miami-Dade counties from traffic accidents; the deaths are considered indirectly related to Ernesto. Overall damage in the state was minor. Passing to the east of Georgia, the storm produced light winds and rainfall near the coast. In South Carolina, the storm brought over 7 inches (175 mm) of precipitation to North Myrtle Beach, which caused ponding on roadways. Winds were generally light, peaking at around 35 mph (55 km/h), which caused isolated power outages; about 2,700 people across the state lost power. Near Charleston, the passage of the storm caused moderate flooding that left some roads closed. No significant damage was reported in the state. Tropical Storm Ernesto made landfall in Brunswick County in the southern portion of North Carolina, producing a moderate storm surge along the Pamlico River which forced several evacuations. The storm surge reached 4-6 feet (1.2-1.8 m) in Beaufort County, flooding many homes and businesses. Just east of where it moved ashore, the storm dropped 14.6 inches (371 mm) of rainfall in Wrightsville Beach; this was the highest rainfall total associated with Ernesto in the United States. Much of the eastern portion of the state received over 3 inches (75 mm) of precipitation, and in the northeastern portion of the state, the precipitation caused flash flooding. The rainfall caused freshwater flooding in low-lying areas, as well as along major and minor roadways; the floodwaters left a portion of Interstate 40 closed in Duplin County. Subsequent to the storm's passage, the rainfall caused severe river flooding, with many streams and rivers overflowing their banks for several days. The Northeast Cape Fear River at Chinquapin remained in major flood stage for a week, flooding about 300 homes. The storm moved ashore just below hurricane strength, though wind gusts near the coast were generally around 40-60 mph (65-95 km/h). Gusts peaked at 62 mph (100 km/h) in Wilmington, and the strong winds downed trees and power lines across the coastal region; about 69,000 people were left without power. Minor property damage was caused by three tornadoes spawned by the storm in eastern North Carolina. The passage of the storm caused a traffic fatality in the state. Overall damage was estimated at $80 million (2006 USD), all but $4 million of which from crop damage. =Mid-Atlantic States and Canada= Fallen tree branch in Richmond, Virginia, caused by winds from Ernesto Ernesto transitioned into an extratropical cyclone as it entered southern Virginia, bringing heavy rainfall which peaked at 10.6 inches (270 mm) in Wakefield, and a three day total of 12.92 inches (328 mm) in the Princess Anne area of Virginia Beach. The precipitation caused flash flooding, which closed several roads but did not cause serious damage. The interaction between Ernesto and a strong ridge over the western Atlantic produced a tight pressure gradient, resulting in strong winds across the state; wind gusts peaked at 87 mph (141 km/h) at a station near the mouth of the York River. Strong winds downed numerous trees, including in Gloucester where two people died after a tree hit their home. The winds caused widespread power outages; Dominion Virginia Power reported about 600,000 customers as losing power some time during the storm. The storm produced a storm tide of 6.12 feet (1.86 m) near Virginia Beach; along the Chesapeake Bay, tidal flooding in combination with strong waves damaged boats and piers, and left a few homes flooded. Storm surge flooding also occurred along the Potomac River, with heavy beach erosion, light property damage, and flooded roadways reported in Alexandria. Across the state, the storm damaged or destroyed 609 houses, with damage totaling at least $118 million (2006 USD). Seven people were killed in the state, of which two directly to the storm; three of the deaths were from traffic accidents, and one person died from carbon monoxide poisoning, due to operating a power generator inside after a power outage. In Washington, D.C., the storm produced wind gusts of up to 45 mph (75 km/h) which, in combination with heavy rainfall, resulted in a few downed tree branches and power lines. High tides left moderate damage in St. Mary's County, Maryland of about $4.4 million (2006 USD), with the damage to trees and power lines considered worse than the impact in Hurricane Isabel in 2003. In neighboring Charles County, storm surge flooding forced the evacuations of houses along the waterfront. The interaction between Ernesto and a high pressure area over eastern Canada produced high winds, heavy rainfall, tidal flooding, and high waves across the Mid-Atlantic and New England. In Delaware, the winds left 151,000 people without power, and the adverse conditions canceled several Labor Day Weekend events. A buoy in the Delaware Bay recorded a record-high wave height of . In southern New Jersey, winds left over 200,000 buildings without power, while high waves flooded or closed several roads and bridges. Further north, between 2-4 inches (50–100 mm) of rain fell across Pennsylvania and New York. In Pennsylvania, there were two deaths. A seven-year-old boy died at a hospital, after a tree limb fell on him. A man was trying to rescue his golden retriever from a drainage steam, while he was sucked into an outflow pipe, and was found dead after being pulled out of a manhole. The rain in New York caused delays in the play at the 2006 US Open, and washed out a whole day's play. The extratropical remnants of Ernesto moved across southern Ontario, dropping moderate rainfall of up to 2.1 inches (54 mm). Wind gusts reached 37 mph (60 km/h) near Toronto, and the winds in combination with the rainfall caused power outages when lines snapped. Hundreds were left without power, though the outages were quickly restored. Aftermath On September 22, following a request from Virginia governor Tim Kaine, President George W. Bush declared 19 counties in Virginia as disaster areas, along with the cities of Richmond and Poquoson. The declaration allocated federal funding to assist in paying for debris removal and the rebuilding of public infrastructure damaged by Ernesto's flooding, including roads, parks, and government buildings. The city of Newport News and four additional counties were added later in the areas eligible for federal funding. In all, FEMA provided about $7.3 million (2006 USD) in assistance. Although the state of Virginia applied for individual assistance, the federal government denied the request. Due to debris and waste being carried into waterways by flooding from Ernesto, Virginia officials closed the Chesapeake Bay to shellfishing for four days from the Chesapeake Bay Bridge–Tunnel to the mouth of the Potomac River. In Richmond, officials condemned 70 homes, prompting city workers to establish temporary homes. By five days after the storm's passage through the state, most of the 600,000 people who experienced power outages had their electricity restored. Dominion Resources's Tidewater Virginia area was among the most affected, requiring 2–3 days to restore all areas. By two days after the storm moved through the area, all major roadways were opened, though secondary roadways took longer to be cleared from debris. Outside of Virginia, the Emergency Operation Centers in Pennsylvania, Delaware, and the District of Columbia were closed. Power crews worked to restore electricity to the affected areas across the region.

The show lasted 130 episodes and was distributed internationally by Venevisión International. Emma Rabbe and Guillermo Pérez starred as the main protagonists with Mayra Alejandra as the antagonist. Synopsis Ligia Valderrama is a beautiful, self-assured, young woman accustomed to getting everything she wants. Her father, Francisco Valderrama, has spoiled her excessively, perhaps to make up for the harm he did her when she was still a baby. Although Ligia has grown up believing she is the daughter of Raquela, her father’s wife, her real mother is Salome Hernandez, a woman of humble birth who fell in love with Francisco in spite of the fact that he was already married. On a fateful night over 20 years ago, Salome and Francisco were running away with their baby daughter and a briefcase containing a million dollars that he had stolen from his wife’s firm, when they had a serious car accident. Raquela found them unconscious – frustrated because she could never have a child - seized the opportunity to kidnap little Ligia. Threatening Francisco with turning him in for embezzlement, she made him her accomplice in a terrible lie: telling Salome that her daughter was dead. The pain of this news was so unbearable that Salome went insane and was committed in a sanitarium. And so, Ligia grew up in the luxury of the Valderrama’s household, with a slightly cold adoptive mother and a loving, but weak and remorseful, father. Meanwhile, in a country village a few hours away from the capital, a different story is unfolding. It centers on Mabel Alcantara, another beautiful young woman, whose life is not what it was originally meant to be. Unlike Ligia, Mabel has grown up wild and poor, reared by a kind-hearted couple who took her in when her parents died. She could never imagine that she is actually the owner of the lavish hacienda where she sneaks in to steal mangoes. The current master of the hacienda, Arturo Urbaneja Castro, cheated Mabel’s parents out of the estate, and this circumstance led them to commit suicide. That is why now it is so ironic for Mabel to fall in love with Simón Acariza, son of the scoundrel who deprived her of what was rightfully hers. The passionate love affair that develops between Mabel and Simón will bring them many difficulties… Almost simultaneously, Ligia finds the man of her dreams: Gabriel Salazar. They fall deeply in love, but this relationship is also bound to fail as Raquela gets in the way, disapproving of the social differences between them. That is when fate confronts Ligia and Mabel. The sweet country girl, pregnant by Simón and shunned by his family, now lives in the city and casually meets Gabriel. She touches him with her gentleness, and now that he is separated from Ligia, he feels the need to care for Mabel, and eventually even asks her to marry him. The marriage does not take place, however, because both Gabriel and Mabel realize they still love Ligia and Simón. After a series of unexpected events, both young couples will finally find happiness together… and at long last, Ligia and Mabel will recover what life had so unfairly taken from them.

It is surrounded by the Rural Municipality of De Salaberry. The nearest communities are Steinbach, St. Malo, Morris and Niverville. Agriculture is the dominant industry: primarily dairy farming and livestock. Being important sectors for the life of the community, the local businesses, services, and hospitality are strong. Tourism is also important to the village: the former Crow Wing Trail is now part of the Trans- Canada Trail, and St. Pierre-Jolys hosts several popular festivals, such as la Cabane à Sucre (maple syrup festival) in April; le Festival Chantecler, a celebration of Francophone arts; and the signature St-Pierre-Jolys Frog Follies and Ag Fair (les Folies Grenouilles et Foire Agricoles), a village fair featuring the Canadian frog jumping competition. There are 3 schools, a hospital, and a sizable Royal Canadian Mounted Police detachment in the village. Bilingual St-Pierre-Jolys has collaborated with nearby St. Malo on several ventures, including a trade show and a hockey league. The dramatic sequences for the 2012 documentary We Were Children were shot there.  History  Part of the 19th-century Crow Wing Trail linking Upper Fort Garry with St. Paul (now MN), the area was initially settled by francophone people of Métis and Québécois heritage. English settlers later came as well, in smaller numbers. Father Noel-Joseph Ritchot and Mr. Joseph Dubuc both helped with St. Pierre's founding. The Brittany-born Father Jean-Marie Jolys started a parish and encouraged many Quebec families to move here. The name \\"Jolys\\" was added to \\"St. Pierre\\" around 1922 to recognize the 40 years of Father Jolys as parish priest of St. Pierre. The Roman Catholic faith has been inextricably linked to the settlement's growth. A former convent of the Sisters of the Holy Names of Jesus and Mary is now the village museum. Though the post office opened in 1879, St. Pierre-Jolys was only incorporated as a village in 1947. A unique part of the area's history was the establishment of a POW camp during World War II 6 miles south of St. Pierre in 1943, the camp held about 200 prisoners working on a sugar beet farm.

A FEMA Urban Search and Rescue Task Force (US&R; Task Force) is a team of individuals specializing in urban search and rescue, disaster recovery, and emergency triage and medicine. The teams are deployed to emergency and disaster sites within six hours of notification. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) created the Task Force concept to provide support for large scale disasters in the United States. FEMA provides financial, technical and training support for the Task Forces as well as creating and verifying the standards of Task Force personnel and equipment. There are 28 Task Forces in the United States, each sponsored by a local agency. In the event of a disaster in the United States, the nearest three Task Forces will be activated and sent to the site of the disaster. If the situation is large enough, additional teams will be activated. Task Force makeup Each Task Force is capable of deploying as a Type I with 70 personnel or a Type III with 28 personnel. This deployment configuration is increased if the Task Force mobilizes for a ground transport. Each task force member is a specialist in one of four areas: * Search - locating victims of a disaster * Rescue - extricating a victim from the location where they are trapped, usually involving removing debris from around the victim * Technical - structural specialists who provide engineering support for the rescuers * Medical - providing medical treatment for the team, canines and victims before, during and after rescue The search and rescue personnel are organized into four Rescue Squads, each composed of an Officer and five Rescue Specialists, and are capable of working 12-hour alternating shifts. The medical personnel include two task force physicians and four Medical Specialists. =Canine rescuers= Rescue dogs The canine rescuers are a critical element of each US&R; Task Force as their keen sense of smell allows them to locate victims that might go undiscovered. The majority of the dog handlers on the Task Forces are civilian volunteers. The dogs are usually considered to be family pets by the handlers when the dogs are not on duty. The canine rescuers will become unmotivated if they are unsuccessful in locating victims, as they consider search and rescue to be a type of game. To keep the canines engaged after long hours of working, one of the Task Force members will hide in the rubble so the dog will have a successful 'find'. In most instances, the dogs do not wear any equipment (collars, vests, booties, etc.) while working a debris pile. Protective booties may be used in areas where traction is not a primary safety concern. However, on large, unstable debris piles dogs typically do not wear booties or other protective equipment as they need to be able to splay their paws to obtain maximum traction and maintain balance. Harnesses, collars and other equipment can also pose a serious risk to the dog while working if they were to become snagged on steel rebar or other items contained within a disaster site. Because the dogs often work out of sight and out of reach of the handler, it is critical to minimize the possibility of the dog becoming trapped in a confined space or choking from an entangled collar. Because of the distinct possibility of injury from broken glass and metal, the medical unit maintains supplies for the canine rescuers. After first passing an evaluation of basic obedience, alert, directional control, agility and search skills currently known as an FSA (Foundational Skills Assessment), all canine/handler teams must pass an advanced certification known as a Certification Evaluation (or CE). This advanced certification process evaluates the ability of the canine and handler to locate an unknown number of buried subjects in multiple rubble piles in a limited period of time. All canine teams in the FEMA USAR system must achieve and maintain an advanced certification through the Certification Evaluation program to be considered a depolyable resource. This process is analogous to the Type II Basic and Type I Advanced certifications used prior to 2006. History The origins of the FEMA Task Forces goes back to the early 1980s when the Fairfax County Fire and Rescue Department and Metro-Dade County Fire Department created search and rescue teams to deal with rescue operations in collapsed buildings. The State Department and the Office of Foreign Disaster Aid requested the help of these teams to assist with rescue operations in the 1985 Mexico City, the 1990 Luzon and the 1989 Leninakan earthquakes. Seeing the value in having a network of such teams in the United States, FEMA created the National Urban Search and Rescue (US&R;) Response System in 1989. In 1992, the concept was incorporated into the Federal Response Plan first published in 1992 and was later retained in the National Response Plan and the National Response Framework. FEMA sponsored 25 national urban search-and-rescue task forces. The number of teams has expanded to 28 since 1991. =Notable US&R; Task Force responses= Task Forces respond to a variety of different situations ranging from natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes to man-made disasters such as gas explosions and bombings.

Task Force equipment FEMA Urban Search and Rescue Task Force equipment in Louisiana after Hurricane Katrina. FEMA has created a standardized list of equipment that each Task Force maintains. The 16,400 pieces of equipment are cached and palletized for quick access and transportation. The complete load of equipment weighs 60,000 pounds (27,215 kg) and is designed to be transported by tractor trailer or in the cargo hold of one C-17 transport aircraft or two C-130 transport aircraft. The equipment cache allows the Task Force to operate independently for up to four days. The cache contains five categories of equipment: Medical, Search and Rescue, Communications, Technical Support and Logistics. =Medical= The medical portion of the cache includes medical treatment and tools to provide sophisticated medical treatment for victims and task force members, including limited treatment of disaster search canines. The treatment materials are designed to be enough to handle 10 critical cases, 15 moderate cases and 25 minor cases. Items included in the medical cache are medicines, intravenous fluids, blankets, suture sets, airways, tracheal tubes, defibrillators, burn treatment supplies, bone saws and scalpels. On site, the \\"durable\\" medical equipment will stay with the Task Force when patients are transferred to other medical facilities. The local medical facilities must provide their own medical equipment as the equipment may be needed again by the Task Force. =Search and Rescue= The Search and Rescue portion of the cache contains all the equipment that the Search and Rescue teams will need to extricate victims from debris. Technical search tools include telescopic cameras with heat detecting sensors and seismic listening devices (Delsar). Construction type equipment such as concrete saws, jackhammers, drills and rope, and technical rescue type equipment such as lifting airbags, shore systems, and hydraulic rescue tools. Non-reusable shoring material such as lumber and pipe is not included in the cache and is to be found or acquired at the disaster site. =Communications= Generators, lights, radios, cellular phones, laptop computers Task Force personnel will be issued portable radios at the point of departure to a disaster and are responsible for that radio until the Task Force returns to the point of departure. The radios operate in the 403-430 MHz range and are capable of penetrating structures and below grade environments (i.e. underground). =Technical support= Snake-like cameras, fiberscopes, sensitive listening devices, measuring devices such as laser rangefinders, strain gauges and levels; audio-visual equipment such as still and video cameras, LCD projectors; haz-mat equipment and support equipment for canines such as kennels, harnesses and sleeping pads. =Logistics= Sleeping bags, cots, food and water, as well as cold weather gear, portable toilets, portable showers, safety equipment such as gloves, earplugs, kneepads, respirators and protective eyewear; administrative equipment such as office supplies and reference materials; equipment maintenance materials and Task Force member's personal gear.

As such, results from matrix theory can sometimes be extended to compact operators using similar arguments. By contrast, the study of general operators on infinite-dimensional spaces often requires a genuinely different approach. For example, the spectral theory of compact operators on Banach spaces takes a form that is very similar to the Jordan canonical form of matrices. In the context of Hilbert spaces, a square matrix is unitarily diagonalizable if and only if it is normal. A corresponding result holds for normal compact operators on Hilbert spaces. More generally, the compactness assumption can be dropped. But, as stated above, the techniques used to prove e.g. the spectral theorem are different, involving operator valued measures on the spectrum. Some results for compact operators on Hilbert space will be discussed, starting with general properties before considering subclasses of compact operators.  Definition  Let H be a Hilbert space and L(H) be the set of bounded operators on H. Then, an operator T\\\\in L(H) is said to be a compact operator if the image of each bounded set under T is relatively compact.  Some general properties  We list in this section some general properties of compact operators. If X and Y are Hilbert spaces (in fact X Banach and Y normed will suffice), then T : X → Y is compact if and only if it is continuous when viewed as a map from X with the weak topology to Y (with the norm topology). (See , and note in this reference that the uniform boundedness will apply in the situation where F ⊆ X satisfies (∀φ ∈ Hom(X, K)) sup{x**(φ) = φ(x) : x} < ∞, where K is the underlying field. The uniform boundedness principle applies since Hom(X, K) with the norm topology will be a Banach space, and the maps x** : Hom(X,K) → K are continuous homomorphisms with respect to this topology.) The family of compact operators is a norm-closed, two-sided, *-ideal in L(H). Consequently, a compact operator T cannot have a bounded inverse if H is infinite- dimensional. If ST = TS = I, then the identity operator would be compact, a contradiction. If sequences of bounded operators Bn → B, Cn → C in the strong operator topology and T is compact, then B_nTC_n^* converges to BTC^* in norm. For example, consider the Hilbert space l^2(\\\\mathbf{N}), with standard basis {en}. Let Pm be the orthogonal projection on the linear span of {e1 ... em}. The sequence {Pm} converges to the identity operator I strongly but not uniformly. Define T by Te_n = \\\\tfrac{1}{n^2} e_n. T is compact, and, as claimed above, PmT → IT = T in the uniform operator topology: for all x, :\\\\left\\\\ P_m T x - T x \\\\right \\\\ \\\\leq \\\\left( \\\\frac{1}{m+1}\\\\right)^2 \\\\ x \\\\. Notice each Pm is a finite-rank operator. Similar reasoning shows that if T is compact, then T is the uniform limit of some sequence of finite-rank operators. By the norm-closedness of the ideal of compact operators, the converse is also true. The quotient C*-algebra of L(H) modulo the compact operators is called the Calkin algebra, in which one can consider properties of an operator up to compact perturbation.  Compact self adjoint operator  A bounded operator T on a Hilbert space H is said to be self-adjoint if T = T*, or equivalently, :\\\\langle T x, y \\\\rangle = \\\\langle x, T y \\\\rangle, \\\\quad x, y \\\\in H. It follows that is real for every x ∈ H, thus eigenvalues of T, when they exist, are real. When a closed linear subspace L of H is invariant under T, then the restriction of T to L is a self-adjoint operator on L, and furthermore, the orthogonal complement L⊥ of L is also invariant under T. For example, the space H can be decomposed as orthogonal direct sum of two T-invariant closed linear subspaces: the kernel of T, and the orthogonal complement of the kernel (which is equal to the closure of the range of T, for any bounded self-adjoint operator). These basic facts play an important role in the proof of the spectral theorem below. The classification result for Hermitian matrices is the spectral theorem: If M = M*, then M is unitarily diagonalizable and the diagonalization of M has real entries. Let T be a compact self adjoint operator on a Hilbert space H. We will prove the same statement for T: the operator T can be diagonalized by an orthonormal set of eigenvectors, each of which corresponds to a real eigenvalue. = Spectral theorem = Theorem For every compact self-adjoint operator T on a real or complex Hilbert space H, there exists an orthonormal basis of H consisting of eigenvectors of T. More specifically, the orthogonal complement of the kernel of T admits, either a finite orthonormal basis of eigenvectors of T, or a countably infinite orthonormal basis {en} of eigenvectors of T, with corresponding eigenvalues , such that . In other words, a compact self-adjoint operator can be unitarily diagonalized. This is the spectral theorem. When H is separable, one can mix the basis {en} with a countable orthonormal basis for the kernel of T, and obtain an orthonormal basis {fn} for H, consisting of eigenvectors of T with real eigenvalues {μn} such that . Corollary For every compact self-adjoint operator T on a real or complex separable infinite- dimensional Hilbert space H, there exists a countably infinite orthonormal basis {fn} of H consisting of eigenvectors of T, with corresponding eigenvalues , such that .  The idea  Let us discuss first the finite- dimensional proof. Proving the spectral theorem for a Hermitian n × n matrix T hinges on showing the existence of one eigenvector x. Once this is done, Hermiticity implies that both the linear span and orthogonal complement of x (of dimension n-1) are invariant subspaces of T. The desired result is then obtained by induction for T_{x^\\\\perp}. The existence of an eigenvector can be shown in (at least) two alternative ways: #One can argue algebraically: The characteristic polynomial of T has a complex root, therefore T has an eigenvalue with a corresponding eigenvector. #The eigenvalues can be characterized variationally: The largest eigenvalue is the maximum on the closed unit sphere of the function defined by f(x) = x*Tx = . Note. In the finite-dimensional case, part of the first approach works in much greater generality; any square matrix, not necessarily Hermitian, has an eigenvector. This is simply not true for general operators on Hilbert spaces. In infinite dimensions it is also not immediate how to generalize the concept of characteristic polynomial. The spectral theorem for the compact self adjoint case can be obtained analogously: one finds an eigenvector by extending the second finite-dimensional argument above, then apply induction. We first sketch the argument for matrices. Since the closed unit sphere S in R2n is compact, and f is continuous, f(S) is compact on the real line, therefore f attains a maximum on S, at some unit vector y. By Lagrange's multiplier theorem, y satisfies : abla f = abla y^* T y = \\\\lambda \\\\cdot abla y^* y for some λ. By Hermiticity, . Alternatively, let z ∈ Cn be any vector. Notice that if a unit vector y maximizes on the unit sphere (or on the unit ball), it also maximizes the Rayleigh quotient: :g(x) = \\\\frac{\\\\langle Tx, x \\\\rangle}{\\\\x\\\\^2}, \\\\qquad 0 e x \\\\in \\\\mathbf{C}^n. Consider the function: :\\\\begin{cases} h : \\\\mathbf{R} \\\\to \\\\mathbf{R}  h(t) = g(y+tz) \\\\end{cases} By calculus, , i.e., :\\\\begin{align} h'(0) &= \\\\lim_{t \\\\to 0} \\\\frac{h(t)-h(0)}{t - 0}  &= \\\\lim_{t \\\\to 0} \\\\frac{g(y+tz)-g(y)}{t}  &= \\\\lim_{t \\\\to 0} \\\\frac{1}{t} \\\\left (\\\\frac{\\\\langle T(y+tz), y+tz \\\\rangle}{\\\\y+tz\\\\^2}-\\\\frac{\\\\langle Ty, y \\\\rangle}{\\\\y\\\\^2} \\\\right )  &= \\\\lim_{t \\\\to 0} \\\\frac{1}{t} \\\\left (\\\\frac{\\\\langle T(y+tz), y+tz \\\\rangle - \\\\langle Ty, y \\\\rangle}{\\\\y\\\\^2} \\\\right )  &= \\\\frac{1}{\\\\y\\\\^2} \\\\lim_{t \\\\to 0} \\\\frac{\\\\langle T(y+tz), y+tz \\\\rangle - \\\\langle Ty, y \\\\rangle}{t}  &= \\\\frac{1}{\\\\y\\\\^2} \\\\left (\\\\frac{d}{dt} \\\\frac{\\\\langle T (y + t z), y + tz \\\\rangle}{\\\\langle y + tz, y + tz \\\\rangle} \\\\right)(0)  &= 0. \\\\end{align} Define: :m=\\\\frac{\\\\langle Ty, y \\\\rangle}{\\\\langle y, y \\\\rangle} After some algebra the above expression becomes (Re denotes the real part of a complex number) :\\\\Re(\\\\langle T y - m y, z \\\\rangle) = 0. But z is arbitrary, therefore . This is the crux of proof for spectral theorem in the matricial case. Note that while the Lagrange multipliers generalizes to the infinite-dimensional case, the compactness of the unit sphere is lost. This is where the assumption that the operator T be compact is useful.  Details  Claim If T is a compact self-adjoint operator on a non-zero Hilbert space H and :m(T) := \\\\sup \\\\bigl\\\\\\\\{ \\\\langle T x, x \\\\rangle : x \\\\in H, \\\\, \\\\x\\\\ \\\\le 1 \\\\bigr\\\\\\\\}, then m(T) or −m(T) is an eigenvalue of T. If , then T = 0 by the polarization identity, and this case is clear. Consider the function :\\\\begin{cases} f : H \\\\to \\\\mathbf{R}  f(x) = \\\\langle T x, x \\\\rangle \\\\end{cases} Replacing T by −T if necessary, one may assume that the supremum of f on the closed unit ball B ⊂ H is equal to . If f attains its maximum m(T) on B at some unit vector y, then, by the same argument used for matrices, y is an eigenvector of T, with corresponding eigenvalue = . By the Banach–Alaoglu theorem and the reflexivity of H, the closed unit ball B is weakly compact. Also, the compactness of T means (see above) that T : X with the weak topology → X with the norm topology, is continuous. These two facts imply that f is continuous on B equipped with the weak topology, and f attains therefore its maximum m on B at some . By maximality, \\\\y\\\\=1, which in turn implies that y also maximizes the Rayleigh quotient g(x) (see above). This shows that y is an eigenvector of T, and ends the proof of the claim. Note. The compactness of T is crucial. In general, f need not be continuous for the weak topology on the unit ball B. For example, let T be the identity operator, which is not compact when H is infinite-dimensional. Take any orthonormal sequence {yn}. Then yn converges to 0 weakly, but lim f(yn) = 1 ≠ 0 = f(0). Let T be a compact operator on a Hilbert space H. A finite (possibly empty) or countably infinite orthonormal sequence {en} of eigenvectors of T, with corresponding non-zero eigenvalues, is constructed by induction as follows. Let H0 = H and T0 = T. If m(T0) = 0, then T = 0 and the construction stops without producing any eigenvector en. Suppose that orthonormal eigenvectors of T have been found. Then is invariant under T, and by self-adjointness, the orthogonal complement Hn of En is an invariant subspace of T. Let Tn denote the restriction of T to Hn. If m(Tn) = 0, then Tn = 0, and the construction stops. Otherwise, by the claim applied to Tn, there is a norm one eigenvector en of T in Hn, with corresponding non-zero eigenvalue λn = . Let F = (span{en})⊥, where {en} is the finite or infinite sequence constructed by the inductive process; by self-adjointness, F is invariant under T. Let S denote the restriction of T to F. If the process was stopped after finitely many steps, with a last vector em−1, then F= Hm and S = Tm = 0 by construction. In the infinite case, compactness of T and the weak- convergence of en to 0 imply that , therefore . Since F is contained in Hn for every n, it follows that m(S) ≤ m({Tn}) = λn for every n, hence m(S) = 0. This implies again that . The fact that S = 0 means that F is contained in the kernel of T. Conversely, if x ∈ ker(T), then by self-adjointness, x is orthogonal to every eigenvector {en} with non-zero eigenvalue. It follows that , and that {en} is an orthonormal basis for the orthogonal complement of the kernel of T. One can complete the diagonalization of T by selecting an orthonormal basis of the kernel. This proves the spectral theorem. A shorter but more abstract proof goes as follows: by Zorn's lemma, select U to be a maximal subset of H with the following three properties: all elements of U are eigenvectors of T, they have norm one, and any two distinct elements of U are orthogonal. Let F be the orthogonal complement of the linear span of U. If F ≠ {0}, it is a non-trivial invariant subspace of T, and by the initial claim there must exist a norm one eigenvector y of T in F. But then U ∪ {y} contradicts the maximality of U. It follows that F = {0}, hence span(U) is dense in H. This shows that U is an orthonormal basis of H consisting of eigenvectors of T. = Functional calculus = If T is compact on an infinite- dimensional Hilbert space H, then T is not invertible, hence σ(T), the spectrum of T, always contains 0. The spectral theorem shows that σ(T) consists of the eigenvalues {λn} of T, and of 0 (if 0 is not already an eigenvalue). The set σ(T) is a compact subset of the complex numbers, and the eigenvalues are dense in σ(T). Any spectral theorem can be reformulated in terms of a functional calculus. In the present context we have: Theorem. Let C(σ(T)) denote the C*-algebra of continuous functions on σ(T). There exists a unique isometric homomorphism such that Φ(1) = I and, if f is the identity function f(λ) = λ, then . Moreover, . The functional calculus map Φ is defined in a natural way: let {en} be an orthonormal basis of eigenvectors for H, with corresponding eigenvalues {λn}; for , the operator Φ(f), diagonal with respect to the orthonormal basis {en}, is defined by setting :\\\\Phi(f)(e_n) = f(\\\\lambda_n) e_n for every n. Since Φ(f) is diagonal with respect to an orthonormal basis, its norm is equal to the supremum of the modulus of diagonal coefficients, :\\\\\\\\Phi(f)\\\\ = \\\\sup_{\\\\lambda_n \\\\in \\\\sigma(T)} f(\\\\lambda_n) = \\\\f\\\\_{C(\\\\sigma(T))}. The other properties of Φ can be readily verified. Conversely, any homomorphism Ψ satisfying the requirements of the theorem must coincide with Φ when f is a polynomial. By the Weierstrass approximation theorem, polynomial functions are dense in C(σ(T)), and it follows that . This shows that Φ is unique. The more general continuous functional calculus can be defined for any self-adjoint (or even normal, in the complex case) bounded linear operator on a Hilbert space. The compact case, described here, is a particularly simple instance of this functional calculus. = Simultaneous diagonalisation = Consider an Hilbert space H (e.g. the finite-dimensional Cn), and a commuting set \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\subseteq\\\\operatorname{Hom}(H,H) of self-adjoint operators. Then under suitable conditions, can be simultaneously (unitarily) diagonalised. Viz., there exists an orthonormal basis Q consisting of common eigenvectors for the operators — i.e. :(\\\\forall{q\\\\in Q,T\\\\in\\\\mathcal{F}})(\\\\exists{\\\\sigma\\\\in\\\\mathbf{C}})(T-\\\\sigma)q=0 Lemma. Suppose all the operators in \\\\mathcal{F} are compact. Then every closed non-zero \\\\mathcal{F}-invariant sub-space S ⊆ H has a common eigenvector for \\\\mathcal{F}. Proof. Case I: all the operators have each exactly one eigenvalue. Then take any s\\\\in S of unit length. This is a common eigenvector. Case II: there is some operator T\\\\in\\\\mathcal{F} with at least 2 eigenvalues and let 0 eq \\\\alpha \\\\in \\\\sigma(T\\\\upharpoonright S). Since T is compact and α is non-zero, we have S':=\\\\ker(T\\\\upharpoonright S-\\\\alpha) is a finite- dimensional (and therefore closed) non-zero \\\\mathcal{F}-invariant sub-space (because the operators all commute with T, we have for T'\\\\in\\\\mathcal{F} and x\\\\in\\\\ker(T\\\\upharpoonright S-\\\\alpha), that (T-\\\\alpha)(T'x)=(T'(T~x)-\\\\alpha T'x)=0). In particular we definitely have \\\\dim S'<\\\\dim S. Thus we could in principle argue by induction over dimension, yielding that S'\\\\subseteq S has a common eigenvector for \\\\mathcal{F}. Theorem 1. If all the operators in \\\\mathcal{F} are compact then the operators can be simultaneously (unitarily) diagonalised. Proof. The following set :\\\\mathbf{P}=\\\\\\\\{ A \\\\subseteq H : A \\\\text{ is an orthonormal set of common eigenvectors for } \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\\\\\}, is partially ordered by inclusion. This clearly has the Zorn property. So taking Q a maximal member, if Q is a basis for the whole Hilbert space H, we are done. If this were not the case, then letting S=\\\\langle Q\\\\rangle^{\\\\bot}, it is easy to see that this would be an \\\\mathcal{F}-invariant non-trivial closed subspace; and thus by the lemma above, therein would lie a common eigenvector for the operators (necessarily orthogonal to Q). But then there would then be a proper extension of Q within P; a contradiction to its maximality. Theorem 2. If there is an injective compact operator in \\\\mathcal{F}; then the operators can be simultaneously (unitarily) diagonalised. Proof. Fix T_0\\\\in\\\\mathcal{F} compact injective. Then we have, by the spectral theory of compact symmetric operators on Hilbert spaces: :H=\\\\overline{\\\\bigoplus_{\\\\lambda\\\\in\\\\sigma(T_0)} \\\\ker(T_0-\\\\sigma)}, where \\\\sigma(T_0) is a discrete, countable subset of positive real numbers, and all the eigenspaces are finite-dimensional. Since \\\\mathcal{F} a commuting set, we have all the eigenspaces are invariant. Since the operators restricted to the eigenspaces (which are finite-dimensional) are automatically all compact, we can apply Theorem 1 to each of these, and find orthonormal bases Qσ for the \\\\ker(T_0-\\\\sigma). Since T0 is symmetric, we have that :Q:=\\\\bigcup_{\\\\sigma\\\\in\\\\sigma(T_0)} Q_{\\\\sigma} is a (countable) orthonormal set. It is also, by the decomposition we first stated, a basis for H. Theorem 3. If H a finite-dimensional Hilbert space, and \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\subseteq\\\\operatorname{Hom}(H,H) a commutative set of operators, each of which is diagonalisable; then the operators can be simultaneously diagonalised. Proof. Case I: all operators have exactly one eigenvalue. Then any basis for H will do. Case II: Fix T_0\\\\in\\\\mathcal{F} an operator with at least two eigenvalues, and let P\\\\in\\\\operatorname{Hom}(H,H)^{\\\\times} so that P^{-1}T_0P is a symmetric operator. Now let α be an eigenvalue of P^{-1}T_0P. Then it is easy to see that both: :\\\\ker\\\\left(P^{-1}~T_0(P-\\\\alpha)\\\\right), \\\\quad \\\\ker\\\\left(P^{-1}~T_0(P-\\\\alpha) \\\\right)^{\\\\bot} are non-trivial P^{-1}\\\\mathcal{F}P-invariant subspaces. By induction over dimension we have that there are linearly independent bases Q1, Q2 for the subspaces, which demonstrate that the operators in P^{-1}\\\\mathcal{F}P can be simultaneously diagonalisable on the subspaces. Clearly then P(Q_1\\\\cup Q_2) demonstrates that the operators in \\\\mathcal{F} can be simultaneously diagonalised. Notice we did not have to directly use the machinery of matrices at all in this proof. There are other versions which do. We can strengthen the above to the case where all the operators merely commute with their adjoint; in this case we remove the term \\"orthogonal\\" from the diagonalisation. There are weaker results for operators arising from representations due to Weyl–Peter. Let G be a fixed locally compact hausdorff group, and H=L^2(G) (the space of square integrable measurable functions with respect to the unique-up-to-scale Haar measure on G). Consider the continuous shift action: :\\\\begin{cases} G\\\\times H\\\\to H  (gf)(x)=f(g^{-1}x) \\\\end{cases} Then if G were compact then there is a unique decomposition of H into a countable direct sum of finite-dimensional, irreducible, invariant subspaces (this is essentially diagonalisation of the family of operators G\\\\subseteq U(H)). If G were not compact, but were abelian, then diagonalisation is not achieved, but we get a unique continuous decomposition of H into 1-dimensional invariant subspaces.  Compact normal operator  The family of Hermitian matrices is a proper subset of matrices that are unitarily diagonalizable. A matrix M is unitarily diagonalizable if and only if it is normal, i.e. M*M = MM*. Similar statements hold for compact normal operators. Let T be compact and T*T = TT*. Apply the Cartesian decomposition to T: define :R = \\\\frac{T + T^*}{2}, \\\\quad J = \\\\frac{T - T^*}{2i}. The self adjoint compact operators R and J are called the real and imaginary parts of T respectively. T is compact means T*, consequently R and J, are compact. Furthermore, the normality of T implies R and J commute. Therefore they can be simultaneously diagonalized, from which follows the claim. A hyponormal compact operator (in particular, a subnormal operator) is normal.  Unitary operator  The spectrum of a unitary operator U lies on the unit circle in the complex plane; it could be the entire unit circle. However, if U is identity plus a compact perturbation, U has only countable spectrum, containing 1 and possibly, a finite set or a sequence tending to 1 on the unit circle. More precisely, suppose where C is compact. The equations and show that C is normal. The spectrum of C contains 0, and possibly, a finite set or a sequence tending to 0. Since , the spectrum of U is obtained by shifting the spectrum of C by 1.  Examples  * Let H = L2([0, 1]). The multiplication operator M defined by :: (M f)(x) = x f(x), \\\\quad f \\\\in H, \\\\, \\\\, x \\\\in [0, 1] :is a bounded self-adjoint operator on H that has no eigenvector and hence, by the spectral theorem, cannot be compact. * Let K(x, y) be square integrable on [0, 1]2 and define TK on H by ::(T_K f)(x) = \\\\int_0^1 K(x, y) f(y) \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d} y. :Then TK is compact on H; it is a Hilbert–Schmidt operator. * Suppose that the kernel K(x, y) satisfies the Hermiticity condition ::K(y, x) = \\\\overline{K(x, y)}, \\\\quad x, y \\\\in [0, 1]. :Then TK is compact and self-adjoint on H; if {φn} is an orthonormal basis of eigenvectors, with eigenvalues {λn}, it can be proved that ::\\\\sum \\\\lambda_n^2 < \\\\infty, \\\\ \\\\ K(x, y) \\\\sim \\\\sum \\\\lambda_n \\\\varphi_n(x) \\\\overline{\\\\varphi_n(y)}, :where the sum of the series of functions is understood as L2 convergence for the Lebesgue measure .

History The community originated in the early 20th century as a service point on the Hudson Bay Railway. Although the railway's presence in Wabowden has diminished over time, it continues to serve the community by transporting freight and passengers to the Wabowden railway station. Wabowden's name is derived from that of a one-time railway executive, W.A. Bowden. Climate In spite of its latitude below the 55th parallel, Wabowden has a clear-cut rather than borderline subarctic climate. Its climate is dominated by its long and bitterly cold winters, but the short summers are relatively warm, keeping Wabowden well below the tree line.

Early years Philip was born in Dallas, Morayshire, Scotland. He emigrated to the United States in 1874 at the age of 15. He first settled in Victoria, Kansas, but moved to Dakota Territory on hearing of the discovery of gold in the Black Hills. In 1879 he married Sarah Larribee (1851 - 1937), in Fort Robinson, Nebraska: in 1881 they settled down to ranch in Stanley County, Dakota Territory, just east of the present location of Philip, whose name memorializes the man who helped found it. At the time, Stanley County was still part of the Great Sioux Indian Reservation and ranching by non-Natives was illegal: the Philips were allowed to locate their ranch there because Sarah was a Native American. Philip was elected as a Democrat to the South Dakota State Senate in 1898, representing Stanley County and the 25th district from 1899 to 1900.South Dakota Legislature, Legislative Research Council, Historical Listings Saving the bison While he was building his cattle herd, Scotty Philip met Pete Dupree, whose son Fred had rescued 5 bison calves from an 1881 buffalo hunt along the Grand River.Black Hills Visitor Magazine: \\"James (Scotty) Philip, Saving the Buffalo\\" After Dupree's death, Philip decided to preserve the species from extinction, and in 1899 he purchased Dupree's herd, which now numbered 74 head, from Dupree's brother-in- law, Dug Carlin. Philip prepared a special pasture for the bison along the western side of the Missouri River north of ere in 1901. Scotty Philip died suddenly on July 23, 1911: by that time the herd had grown to approximately a thousand head. He was buried on a family cemetery near his buffalo pasture. As the funeral procession passed, some of the bison came down out of the hills. Newspapers of the time suggested the bison were \\"showing their respect to the man who had saved them\\". Legacy Bison from Philip's herd helped restock herds throughout the United States, including the large herd at Custer State Park. Philip is the namesake of Philip, South Dakota. He was inducted to the Hall of Great Westerners at the Cowboy Hall of Fame in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma in 1958.

Life Xiao was born in Tianjin into a highly cultural Chinese family, some of her relatives were known people in Chinese history. After a period of music studying in China, she went to the Royal Conservatory at Brussels, winning a prize there in 1932. From 1935 to 1954 she was married to Hermann Scherchen, a conductor; their daughter, Tona Scherchen, became a composer. Xiao spent 14 years working in Switzerland, where she helped to promote Chinese culture with her music and writing. Her 1938 Chinese Children's Suite for voice and piano was among the first works by a Chinese composer to become known in the West, as was her suite for orchestra, Huainian Zuguo (A Commemoration of My Homeland). In 1950, motivated by a desire to help her homeland's development, and a wish to have a career of her own, Xiao returned to China with her three children, not knowing that she herself would not be able to see her husband ever again. From then until her death she taught in Beijing at the Central Conservatory. A substantial number of today's successful Chinese composers benefitted from her teaching, and among them recollections of Xiao is vivid. Her value as a teacher depended on the fact that she was among the earliest Chinese who had first-hand experience in Western art music, as well as all sorts of compositional techniques. Yet, her role as a composer was largely ignored, as during the most of her lifetime a self-dependent composer was impossible in China. It was not until a few years before her death that finally a concert consisting entirely of her own music were given in the Conservatory, followed by the publication of scores. In addition to her work as a teacher and composer, she translated various texts on Western musical thought into Chinese. She died in Beijing. Musical style In a limited compositional output, Xiao's style combines elements of Chinese folk culture with traditional Western techniques. She developed it mainly through teaching polyphony in the 1950s. Most of her works are written for small mediums such as vocal and piano solo music.

Life and career She was born Bessie White in New Bern, North Carolina, and later raised in Brooklyn, New York City. In the mid-1950s, she began singing with a quartet called Three Guys and a Doll. While a member of the group, she met singer Larry Banks; they married on stage at the Royal Theatre in Baltimore around 1955. Sleevenotes by Ady Croasdell for Larry Banks' Soul Family Album She performed and recorded as Toni Banks during the mid-1950s, including the 1957 single \\"You're Still in My Heart\\", on which she was backed by the Four Fellows. In 1959, she and Larry recorded as members of the Companions, releasing a single \\"Why Oh Why Baby\\" on the Federal label. Taking back the name Bessie Banks, she recorded as a solo singer in the first half of the 1960s, starting with \\"Do It Now\\" in 1963 on the Spokane Records label. The single reached #40 on the Billboard R&B; chart in March 1964. Although she and Larry Banks separated and later divorced, they continued to work together. In late 1963, Larry and Bessie decided to make a new push to establish her with a song that Larry had written specifically for the purpose of breaking her nationally: \\"Go Now\\". Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller produced the recording, which first appeared on their Tiger Records label (catalog number TI-102). It was slated for issue on the Blue Cat label (as BC-106), the R&B;/soul imprint of Red Bird. The song was arranged by Gary Sherman, with Cissy Houston as one of the backing singers. Bessie Banks later commented: > \\"'I remember 1963 Kennedy was assassinated; it was announced over the radio. > At the time, I was rehearsing in the office of Leiber and Stoller. We called > it a day. Everyone was in tears. \\"Come back next week and we will be ready > to record 'Go Now'\\"; and we did so. I was happy and excited that maybe this > time I’ll make it. 'Go Now' was released and right away it was chosen Pick > Hit of the Week on W.I.N.S. Radio. That means your record is played for > seven days. Four days went by, I was so thrilled. On day five, when I heard > the first line, I thought it was me, but all of a sudden, I realized it > wasn’t. At the end of the song it was announced, \\"the Moody Blues singing > 'Go Now'\\". I was too out-done. This was the time of the English Invasion and > the end of Bessie Banks’ career, so I thought. America's DJs had stopped > promoting American artists.\\" Banks' recollections are questionable because her single was released in the US in January 1964, and the Moody Blues' version was not released until November 1964 (in the UK) and January 1965 in the US. She returned to the studio in early 1967, recording the single \\"I Can't Make It (Without You Baby)\\" for the Verve label. In 1974, she recorded singles for the Volt label, including \\"Try to Leave Me if You Can (I Bet You Can't Do It)\\" and \\"(Don't You Worry Baby) The Best Is Yet to Come\\". Larry Banks also recorded under his own name, and both recorded with and produced his second wife Joan, who recorded as Jaibi. A compilation of recordings, including those by Bessie Banks, was issued as Larry Banks' Soul Family Album by Ace Records in 2007. At that time, it was reported that Bessie Banks \\"continues to sing though she confines herself to gospel music now.\\" References Category:1938 births Category:American soul singers Category:African-American female singers Category:Living people Category:People from New Bern, North Carolina Category:Verve Records artists Category:Singers from North Carolina ","title":"Bessie Banks"},{"id":"6690936","text":"FRM may refer to: * Financial Risk Manager * Fixed-rate mortgage * Category of frames * Fairmont Municipal Airport (Minnesota), in the United States * Fareham railway station, in England * Fathers' rights movement * Frankfurt Rhine-Main, Germany * FRM II (German: '), a research reactor in Munich * Front Row Motorsports * Middle French * National Technological University – Mendoza Regional Faculty, in Argentina ","title":"FRM"},{"id":"6690938","text":"Larry Davis or, since 1989, Adam Abdul-Hakeem (May 28, 1966 – February 20, 2008) was an American man, convicted in 1991 of a drug dealer's 1986 murder,Marilyn Corsianos, The Complexities of Police Corruption: Gender, Identity, and Misconduct (Lanham, MD: Rowman & Littlefield Publishers, 2012), p 151. yet known for his 1986 shootout in the Bronx with police, hitting six officers, asserting self-defense, and 1988 acquittal of all but gun charges.Christina Jacqueline Johns & Jose Maria Borrero N., \\"The war on drugs: Nothing succeeds like failure\\", in Gregg Barak, ed., Crimes by the Capitalist State: An Introduction to State Criminality (Albany: State University of New York Press, 1991), p 72. In 2008, he died via stabbing by a fellow inmate. On November 19, 1986, nine New York City police officers, with nearly 20 outside the building, raided the Bronx apartment of Davis's sister.Robert Louden, \\"Davis, Larry (1966–2008)\\", pp 142–145, in Delores D. Jones-Brown, Beverly D. Frazier & Marvie Brooks, editors, African Americans and Criminal Justice: An Encyclopedia (Santa Barbara, CA: Greenwood/ABC-CLIO, 2014). In the ensuing shootout, Davis, black, age 20, escaped basically uninjured. While all six shot officers survived, police explained the raid as an attempt to question Davis as a multiple-murder suspect, finally obtained an arrest warrant for that, and reexplained the raid as an attempt to arrest him. On a massive manhunt's 17th day, he was traced to a Bronx building, and hid in an unknown family's unit. Telephoned by the police, he claimed to hold its occupants hostage. After nightlong negotiations, convinced by media presence that police would not shoot, he surrendered peacefully. Davis's legal defense, led by William Kunstler,Jeffrey Rosen, \\"The trials of William Kunstler\\", New York Times, 18 Sep 1994, § 7, p 16. explained the raid as a pretense to murder Davis for knowledge of officers' alleged complicity in illicit drug sales and to punish him for abandoning his own drug dealing under them. In March 1988, on jury trial for a killing of four drug dealers—allegedly the 1986 raid's reason—Davis was acquitted. Then in November, as to the nine raiding and six shot officers, his acquittal of aggravated assault and attempted murder triggered widespread outrage. About 1,000 New York City police officers publicly demonstrated. Yet for many others, Davis became a folk hero. Still others thought him an unsavory character, but probably truthful about the police and the shootout.Rosemary L. Bray, \\"Blacks on blues\\", New York, 1994 Jul 11;27(27):33–35, p 35. Serving five to 15 years on the November 1988 convictions for illegal gun possession, Davis was acquitted of another alleged drug dealer's murder. But in a third murder trial, about another alleged drug dealer, Davis was convicted, and sentenced to 25 years to life. Converting to Islam, he changed his name. Maintaining his innocence, he continued to allege that the police had framed him. A prevalent view attributes his infamous acquittal, rather, to racial bias by a proverbial \\"Bronx jury.\\"Stephan Thernstrom & Abigail Thernstrom, America in Black and White: One Nation, Indivisible (New York: Touchstone, 1999), p 517. But particularly with the Mollen Commission's 1990s exposure of widespread criminality, including drug dealing and violence, by New York City police officers,Leonard Levitt, NYPD Confidential: Power and Corruption in the Country's Greatest Police Force (New York: Thomas Dunne Books, 2009), indexing \\"Mollen Commission\\". In contemporary journalism, Craig Wolff, \\"Tales of police corruption not surprising, 46th Precinct residents say\\", New York City, 10 Oct 1993, reports, in part, \\"The 46th Precinct is in the Fordham section of the Bronx. It is a crime-ridden precinct where, the Mollen Commission was told, some of the department's worst officers were commonly 'dumped.' And it is where 'the Mechanic' worked, a convicted officer who earned the nickname for the tune-ups,' or beatings, he performed on drug suspects and innocent bystanders alike. The Police Department says there is no policy of using any precinct, including the 46th, as a place of exile for troublesome officers\\". Nearly two years later, Clifford Krauss, \\"Police officer convicted of extorting payoffs\\", New York Times, 21 Apr 1995, reports that perhaps some 30 officers in the 46th Precinct were involved in various criminal activity in the community. and then a 2003 independent documentary favoring Davis's explanation, his story continues to provoke divided reactions. Early and personal life An aspiring rapper, Davis was known by peers as musically talented, playing multiple instruments, as well as entrepreneurial, reputedly operating small music studios in the Bronx and Manhattan, while avid for repairing and modifying motorcycles.Troy Reed, director, The Larry Davis Story: A Routine Typical Hit (New York, NY: Street Stars, Inc, 2003), cited by Robert Louden, \\"Davis, Larry (1966–2008)\\", in Delores D. Jones-Brown, Beverly D. Frazier & Marvie Brooks, editors, African Americans and Criminal Justice: An Encyclopedia (Santa Barbara, CA: Greenwood/ABC-CLIO, 2014). Davis's peers acknowledge that by midway through adolescence, Davis was dealing drugs, but claim that he ceased once the woman expecting his first child miscarried and then he learned of her crack use, which he blamed.Azie Faison with Agyei Tyehimba, Game Over: The Rise and Transformation of a Harlem Hustler (New York, NY: Atria Books, 2007), pp 111–112. Davis had one child, a daughter, Larrima Davis, born July 27, 1986. Problems with police Davis's arrest record, starting in early 1983, involves a 1984 robbery conviction, which would premise a probation violation. By the November 1986 shootout, a court hearing for it had been postponed four times.David J Krajicek, \\"Justice stands on its head after Bronx massacre in 1986\\", New York Daily News, 3 Oct 2010. Soon after the successful manhunt, however, the Bronx District Attorney's office alleged that, as The New York Times then paraphrased, \\"Davis was part of a small, loosely organized, 'very violent' group of gunmen who have robbed, assaulted and slain drug dealers in the Bronx and northern Manhattan in recent months\\". Approaching trial, the district attorney's office had one witness outside of law enforcement: Roy L. Gray, who admitted under oath to steering \\"traffic to coke spots.\\" Allegedly, on October 26, 1986, in Manhattan's Washington Heights section, Gray was robbed of $2, and four days later, October 30, in the borough's Harlem section, spotted the robber, later understood as Davis, about to rob some cocaine dealers, too. Reportedly, Gray thus alerted the police, and then rode in the police car that chased the getaway car, carrying Davis and two other men, to the Bronx's Highbridge section, where, along Jerome Avenue, upon issuing three gunshots at the police, the three men evaded arrest by vanishing into an apartment building. In early November, acting on a tip, police sought Davis, but failed to find him, at his sister's apartment within 1231 Fulton Avenue in the Bronx's Morrisania section. Once they returned to the apartment on November 19, the infamous shootout occurred. After it, the police department explained the raid as an effort to question him, but later reexplained it as an attempt to arrest him, albeit without an arrest warrant for him.David J. Langum, William M. Kunstler: The Most Hated Lawyer in America (New York & London: New York University Press, 1999), p 296. Months later, once the police alleged a Jerome Avenue car chase with gunshots fired at police 20 days before the infamous raid, \\"officials from the Bronx District Attorney's office and the Police Department deflected questions about why no warrant had been issued for Mr. Davis's arrest after the Jerome Avenue incident. Each agency referred questions to the other.\\" At some point, a senior police official argued that \\"once you move to introduce an accusatory instrument, you lose the benefit of being able to talk to that person.\\" In any case, the police reported that Gray, as a robbery victim of Davis, examined photos and provided the \\"positive identification\\" of Davis, that Davis's fingerprints were in the getaway car, that two shell casings, recovered from the scene, matched the pistol on Davis at his December 6 arrest, and that ballistics tests tied this gun to the killings of four suspected drug dealers in Manhattan just hours before the October 30 car chase from Manhattan to the Bronx. Davis maintained, instead, that the police had framed him for these murders. Similarly, Davis's attorneys William Kunstler and Lynne Stewart as well as Davis's peers and family would altogether contend that five years before the shootout, certain police officers had recruited Davis, age 15, to deal drugs under their sponsorship, and thereupon tolerated, likewise, the dealing of Davis's peers soon working under him, but began harassing them and communicating death threats for Davis once he stopped dealing drugs in late 1986 while withholding drug proceeds, reputedly some $40,000. Shootout and escape On the evening of Wednesday, November 19, 1986, acting on a tip, an NYPD team of 27 from the 41st Precinct and the Emergency Service Unit, the ESU, converged on the six-story, Fulton Avenue apartment building where two of Davis's sisters had adjoining apartments on the ground floor. At about 8:30 p.m., 15 officers surrounded the building and 12 others entered; nine of these went to the three-room apartment of Davis's sister Regina Lewis and seven entered it. Inside were Davis, his girlfriend, his sister, her husband, and four children. Lewis's two infant children were asleep in the bedroom at the rear. Interviewed the next day, Regina Lewis reportedly once she answered a door knock, the police entered the living room with guns drawn, ordered the adults to get the children out, and called, \\"Come out, Larry, you don't have a chance—we've got you surrounded.\\" At trial, the police alleged that Davis had fired first. The jury believed the events presented by the defense, in which an officer entered the apartment with a shotgun and fired at Davis, while he was seated behind a desk holding his baby. The officer, thinking he had hit Davis, was then shot in the neck by Davis with a handgun. The police took cover, returning fire as they retreated. In the confusion, no one kept track of Davis, who slipped into his other sister's apartment and escaped out a back window. Lewis had complained to her brother about him bringing guns to the apartment and told him to get out; he did leave but returned. She also quoted him as telling her, \\"If I'm caught in the street, the police are going to shoot me. But I am going to shoot them first.\\" Police collected the shotgun and the expended shells from the .45-caliber pistol that Davis took with him. A .32-caliber revolver and .357 Magnum pistol were also left behind. Ballistics tests would later link the .32-caliber revolver to the Manhattan drug dealer killing and the .45 caliber pistol to the four dead Bronx dealers. A police official said that all escape routes had been covered by officers but none apparently saw Davis leave. He also said that the wounded officers were unable to return fire effectively due to the presence in the apartment of the two infants and other bystanders. Davis fired four shotgun rounds and nine .45 caliber pistol shots; the police fired four shotgun rounds and 20 pistol shots. Neither Davis nor the two infants with him in the bedroom were wounded. In the following year, three of the wounded officers accused the NYPD of \\"negligent\\" and \\"reckless\\" planning and execution of the raid, and blamed the Bronx detectives for creating \\"chaos\\" by bursting into the apartment before Emergency Service Unit officers could seal off escape routes. Search and capture The six wounded officers were carried across the street to the Bronx-Lebanon Hospital and the manhunt began. The surrounding area and the rest of the building were searched immediately. Police stakeouts were set up at terminals, bridges and tunnels leading out of the city and a nationwide alarm was issued. As the manhunt spread, raids were staged in Chicago, Albany, Newark and other cities where Davis had relatives or friends. A man who said he was Davis called ABC-TV, expressing fears he would be beaten by police and stating he would not be taken alive. Acting on a tip that Davis had been seen entering his mother's home four days after the escape, police searched the building while interviewing Mary Davis in a laundromat across the street. She suffered an apparent heart attack shortly thereafter. As she recuperated three days later, she urged her son to call the NAACP, who had offered to help arrange a safe surrender. On the afternoon of December 5, 1986, police received another tip that Davis had been seen entering the Bronx housing project where his sister Margaret lived. They surrounded the 14-story building, closed off local streets and posted sharpshooters on nearby rooftops. After searching his sister's second-floor apartment, police began a systematic canvass of all 312 units. At some point during the day, Mr. Davis forced his way at gunpoint into Apartment 14-EB, where Elroy and Sophia Sewer lived with their two daughters, just as neighbor Theresa Ali, and her 2-year- old son, arrived for a visit. Mr. Sewer arrived home at 8 P.M. to find his family and the neighbors being held hostage by Mr. Davis. At 11:45 p.m. Davis released the two visitors and sent Mr. Sewer out to pick up food from a nearby Chinese restaurant. He also ordered Mr. Sewer to call Mr. Davis' mother's and sister's tapped telephones and give false location information. When the husband returned with the food he was stopped for questioning by the police and, at 12:45 a.m., informed them that his wife and two daughters were being held hostage by Mr. Davis. Police set up a command post in a nearby apartment and by 1:30 a.m. had established telephone contact. At one point Davis threatened to kill the hostages with a hand grenade, at other points he chatted with negotiators about stereo equipment, asked about a lawyer, and showed concern for his own safety, saying that he was afraid police would harm him. Throughout, negotiators repeated \\"There is no use running, you have nowhere to hide now.\\" To assure Davis that he would not be harmed, police showed him the press credentials of three reporters in a nearby apartment and allowed him to speak to his girlfriend. At about 7 a.m. Larry Davis laid down his .45-caliber pistol and surrendered. As he was taken from the building in handcuffs, residents leaned out of their windows, clapped, and chanted Davis's name. Murder and attempted murder trials The Bronx County District Attorney, along with the District Attorney in Manhattan and in Long Island, had many charges against Larry Davis. They included weapons possession, murder of drug dealers, attempted murder of police, kidnapping, and automobile theft. Despite three trials in two years, prosecutors were unable to convince a jury of that Larry Davis was guilty for any but the weapons charge—the ones he used in shooting the police officers—until a jury convicted him and his brother, Eddie Davis, in the August 1986 killing of a drug dealer. =March 1988 acquittal for the killing of four Bronx drug dealers= The four killings occurred in October 1986. The prosecution, contending that Davis was a crack dealer who specialized in the armed robbery of rival crack dealers, called over 50 witnesses, encompassing ballistic evidence and fingerprints on a cash box placing Davis at the crime scene. Davis's attorneys William Kunstler and Lynne Stewart, in their opening and closing arguments, contended that the prosecution's evidence was fabricated, framing Davis to excuse the infamous raid. They contended Davis had been recruited into a drug ring by rogue police officers, aiming to kill him in the raid. The jury found conflicting testimony from witnesses, and discrepancies in times stated by prosecution witnesses. After deliberating for nine days—then the longest in Bronx history for a single defendant—the jury acquitted Davis. =November 1988 acquittal for shooting of nine police officers= Davis faced numerous charges from the infamous shootout, where he shot six police officers: nine counts of attempted murder, six counts of aggravated assault, eight counts of criminal weapons possession, and two counts of criminal firearm use. Convicted only on criminal weapons possession, Davis was sentenced to 5 to 15 years in prison. During jury selection, the defense accused the prosecution of refusing black women, likely to empathize with Davis. The judge ruled that the defense, likewise abusing peremptory challenges, had had excluded white jurors on racial reasoning. Dismissing the first six seated jurors, then, Judge Fried declared a mistrial. A second mistrial was declared, at the request of both sides, once the new jury's only white expressed concern that acquitting Davis would subject him to harassment by police. Finally seated was a jury of ten blacks and two Hispanics. During trial, ballistic experts incriminated the .45-caliber pistol allegedly seized at Davis's capture. Several wounded officers, including \\"point man\\" Thomas McCarren, who had entered first, identified Davis as the shooter. McCarren testified that once he entered the apartment, Davis rose from a sofa and, carrying a handgun, ran down a narrow hall to a back bedroom, prompting pursuit by McCarren, who next sustained gunfire to his mouth upon seeing Davis fire the pistol at him. But a 12-gauge shotgun slug was embedded in the bedroom's dresser drawer. The defense implicated that McCarren, carrying a shotgun, had firing first, missing Davis but putting the slug in the dresser drawer. McCarren countered that he had earlier given his shotgun to a detective assigned to cover the building's rear, and himself had only a 38-caliber revolver while entering the apartment. In any case, the defense contended that Davis, knowing that police officers sought to kill him, shot in self-defense. They charged that police officers were corrupt and involved in the drug trade. Davis's mother testified that two weeks before the raid, a police officer had pushed her and threatened to kill him. She testified, further, that she had warned her son, and had complained to the police department's Civilian Complaint Review Board, which sustained her complaint. On November 20, 1988, after deliberating 38 hours over five days, the jury acquitted Davis of all charges, except six counts of criminal possession of a weapon. Interviewed afterward, the jury forewoman said Davis was a \\"young and innocent kid who got recruited by a few corrupt policemen.\\" McCarren, most seriously wounded, forced into retirement, called it \\"a racist verdict,\\" and added, \\"The day this happened, a bunch of good honest police officers went to lock up Larry Davis because he had killed people, and not for anything else.\\" Defense attorney Kunstler said, \\"The jury understood what happened—that he acted in self-defense.\\" Defense attorney Stewart quipped, \\"I really think that the black community is no longer going to have black Sambos—they're going to have black Rambos.\\" =December 1989 acquittal for the murder of a Harlem drug dealer= Victor Lagombra, reputedly a \\"mid-level\\" crack dealer in Harlem, Manhattan, was murdered in September 1986. Davis went on trial for the murder in October 1989. The prosecution accused Davis of robbing two drug dealers when surprised by Lagombra walking into the apartment, prompting Davis's \\"cold-blooded act of savagery.\\" Ballistics tests tied Davis's 32-caliber revolver to the killing. Two defense witnesses testified that, on the day of the murder, Davis was in Florida making a rap album. After the five-week trial, the jury returned from its three-day deliberation on a Saturday night, December 4, 1989, with the verdict, again not guilty. Although not Davis's attorney in this case, William Kunstler repeated that Davis had helped rogue police officers sell drugs, and said that the chronic accusations against Davis reflect a conspiracy. =March 1991 conviction for the murder of a Bronx drug dealer= Raymond Vizcaino, reputedly a drug dealer in the Bronx, was murdered in August 1986. In January 1987, Davis's older brother Eddie Davis was arrested and charged. Allegedly, Eddie and Larry, along with two others, attempting robbery at a Webster Avenue apartment, shot through the door, killing Vizcaino. A jury convicted Eddie Davis in June 1989. Larry Davis's trial began five months later. On the night of March 14, 1991, the jury found him guilty. Already serving 5 to 15 years on weapons convictions, Larry received another 25 years to life. Once sentenced, creating a loud scene until the judge expelled him, Davis spoke for about an hour, airing again his longstanding complaint that the police and the judicial system were conducting a vendetta against him. Death Davis was serving his sentence at Shawangunk Correctional Facility near the Ulster County hamlet of Wallkill. At approximately 7 p.m. on February 20, 2008, a correctional officer overseeing the block yard noticed inmates congregating around an argument between two inmates. When the officer went to break it up, he found Davis using his walking cane to fend off an inmate from attacking him with a 9 inch (23 cm) long metal shiv. Davis was unsuccessful and was stabbed numerous times. The officer called for assistance and the attacker was restrained and taken to the Special Housing Unit to remain in segregated custody. Davis was taken to the facility infirmary where first aid was rendered. Davis lost much blood, lost consciousness and eventually showed no vital signs. Not being a trauma level infirmary, the supervising nurse called for an emergency transport by ambulance to St. Luke's Hospital in nearby Newburgh, where he was pronounced dead on arrival. After questioning by the state police and the New York State Department of Correctional Services's (DOCS) inspector general's office, another inmate, Luis Rosado, 42, was charged with murder. Rosado was already serving a sentence of 25 years to life for murder and assault charges in the early 1980s, and had been denied parole in 2007. He was arraigned at Shawangunk Town Court the next morning. DOCS officials said both he and Davis had long disciplinary records, including fights with other inmates, but there was no record of any previous violence between the two. On July 31, 2008, an Ulster County grand jury indicted Rosado on nine felony charges related to the stabbing, including three different counts of murder, assault, criminal possession of a weapon and possession of prison contraband. The murder charges carried a potential sentence of life without parole. After his arrest, Rosado was moved to Clinton Correctional Facility, located in upstate New York close to the Canadian border. On Wednesday, February 25, 2009, Luis Rosado pleaded guilty to first-degree manslaughter in Ulster County Court and was sentenced to an additional 10 years in prison, to be served consecutively with his current 25-to-life sentence for murder.Bronx man pleads guilty to stabbing death of notorious prisoner, Times Herald-Record, February 25, 2009 Davis is survived by his daughter Larrima Davis.

It was the Hurricanes' 80th season of football and 2nd as a member of the Atlantic Coast Conference. The Hurricanes were led by fifth-year head coach Larry Coker and played their home games at the Orange Bowl. They finished the season 9–3 overall and 6–2 in the ACC to finish in second place in the Coastal Division. They were invited to the Peach Bowl where they lost to LSU, 40-3. Season Miami dropped its first game of the season at archrival Florida State, 10–7, when punter/holder Brian Monroe fumbled the snap on a 28-yard game-tying field goal attempt by kicker Jon Peattie with 2:16 left to play in the fourth quarter. Despite gaining 313 yards of offense to Florida State's 170, Miami lost to its archrival for the first time since 1999 (6 straight wins by Miami). The three turnovers, two missed field goals, and a muffed hold on the game-tying field goal attempt were also a contributing factor in the outcome for Miami. The Hurricanes rebounded by winning 8 straight games (including a 27–7 win over previously unbeaten Virginia Tech in Blacksburg) and climbed to the #3 spot in both polls. However, any hopes of a sixth national championship were dashed when the Hurricanes were upset, 14–10, by Georgia Tech at home on November 19 (the game was originally scheduled for October 22, but was postponed in the wake of Hurricane Wilma). The Miami offense, which had problems all season, sputtered badly against Georgia Tech and quarterback Kyle Wright was booed continuously during the second half of the game by the Orange Bowl crowd for his ineffective play. The loss also knocked Miami out of a spot in the inaugural ACC Championship Game. Miami finished the regular season at 9–2 (6–2 ACC), ranked #9 in both polls, and received an invitation to return to the Peach Bowl to face the 10th-ranked LSU Tigers. However, this trip to Atlanta was much different from the Hurricanes last, as Wright and the Miami offense struggled, and the defense, which had been the top-ranked defense in Division I-A for most of the season, was shredded by the LSU offense. Miami was routed, 40–3, in the worst-bowl loss in the program's history. The 'Canes finished the 2005 campaign with a 9–3 record and ranked #18/17 (USA Today/AP). Aftermath Coker's three-loss seasons at Miami were viewed as failures, and the season-opening loss to FSU and the bowl loss to LSU made the 2005 campaign particularly difficult for alumni and fans of the proud program to swallow. The Hurricane offense had been the center of criticism all season long (as well as during the two previous seasons). In particular, offensive coordinator Dan Werner, offensive line coach Art Kehoe, and quarterback Kyle Wright were assigned most of the blame. In the aftermath of the Peach Bowl loss, head coach Larry Coker fired four assistants: Werner, Kehoe, running backs coach Don Soldinger, and linebacker coach Vernon Hargreaves.http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/news/story?id=2277894 The firing of Kehoe was particularly controversial,NBC News as he had been with the program as a player and then a coach for over 25-years and took part in all five of Miami's national championships. With Miami failing to win a conference championship or go to a BCS bowl the previous two years and not having won a national championship since 2001, it was widely assumed that Coker would enter the 2006 season on the hot seat and need to take Miami to a BCS bowl to keep his job.NBC News Schedule Awards and honors =First Team All- Americans= *Kelly Jennings, CB (Sports Illustrated) *Brandon Meriweather, FS (Football Writers Association of America, ABC Sports) *Eric Winston, LT (Walter Camp Foundation, American Football Coaches Association, Sports Illustrated) =All-ACC Selections (First Team)= *Devin Hester, KR/PR *Kelly Jennings, CB *Tyrone Moss, RB *Eric Winston, LT =Awards Finalists= Bold indicates winners *Eric Winston, LT – Jacobs Trophy (Top ACC Lineman) =Jack Harding University of Miami MVP Award= *Eric Winston, LT References Miami Hurricanes Category:Miami Hurricanes football seasons Hurr ","title":"2005 Miami Hurricanes football team"},{"id":"6690962","text":"Avenger is a Space Invaders clone published on cartridge by Commodore in 1981 for the VIC-20.

King, Jr. (born July 23, 1957) is a Filipino former basketball player who was part of the champion Philippine Basketball Association (PBA) ballclub Toyota Tamaraws. He was the starting power center of 1976 MICAA Champion Crown Motors before his mother team, the Toyota Tamaraws called upon his services at the start of the 1977 PBA season. Prior to that, he was dubbed \\"King Bedan\\" in 1976 and was responsible in powering the San Beda Red Lions to runner-up finish in that year. PBA career King was an instant starter for the Tamaraws as resident power forward when Alberto \\"Big Boy\\" Reynoso retired at the end of the 1976 season. Reynoso's younger brother Cristino on the other hand was shipped to U/Tex in one of the early trades back in the PBA. Hence, King joined forces with Ramon Fernandez, Robert Jaworski, Francis Arnaiz and 1976 Rookie Of The Year Virgilio \\"Gil\\" Cortez in the starting unit of the Tamaraws (original starting forward Rodolfo \\"Ompong\\" Segura suffered a knee injury during the 1976 season that allowed Cortez to blossom that season). King became a major force to reckon with, and almost won ROY honors, barely losing to eventual winner and co-power forward Jimmy Taguines of Yco-Tanduay in a tight race. However, King proved that he had the sterner stuff and longevity as he stayed in the PBA for nearly 2 decades while Taguines retired unceremoniously sometime in the early 1980s. King's accomplishments though were somewhat diminished with the performance of his more accomplished teammates. The year after he joined the league, Jaworski ruled the roost by averaging close to triple double the entire season en route to the MVP award. In 1979, Fernandez narrowly lost out to Fortunato \\"Atoy\\" Co, Jr. in a tight MVP race that was decided by the media votes. Fernandez, though, proved that he was the best player of the season as he powered the Tamaraws to a runner up and championship finish in the succeeding two conferences. Co won the MVP title after the 1st Conference, one of the quirks of the PBA rules back then – and since Crispa won the title, the Fortune Cookie, despite ending up second to Fernandez in the stats race in the AFC, romped away with the honors. It was in 1982 though which was considered as King's best year with Toyota. The same year when Jaworski was riding the bench because of an assortment of injuries (the Big J was already 36 by then), it was the quartet of Fernandez, Arnaiz, 1979 ROY Arnie Tuadles and King who starred in Toyota's two championships that season – the same year when Fernandez finally nailed his first of four MVP plums with King being named to the season's Mythical Five. What made King's accomplishments impressive was he did this on the other side of the game – his defense. While every player was getting recognition for their offense, King did so on defense – a skill further enhanced by his coach Edgardo Ocampo - acknowledged as the 1960s best two-way player. King was the nemesis not only of the best local players around, he also took it upon himself to defend against the best imports. Norman Black, Lew Massey, Lew Brown, Clarence Kea, among others, were surprised at how a bulky local player can actually hold his own against them. Black intimated once in an interview that King was \\"the best local defender who ever guarded him.\\" Alvin Patrimonio, during his peak, halcyon days of the early 1990s, badly wanted an aging King to be part of Purefoods simply because he feared having King on the other side of the court defending him. Finally, a PBA player was recognized for his ability to defend players and King became the yardstick of what defenders should be in the coming years. King finished his PBA career as one of only eight local players with more than 5,000 rebounds, 1,942 of which came from the offensive glass. He was also a three- time All-Defensive Team member. While known to be a defensive player, he did score 60 points in a game against Crispa in 1979, just in his third year in the PBA. =Out of the shadows of Jaworski and Fernandez= When Toyota disbanded prior to the start of the 1984 season, there was much hullaballoo regarding the transfer of the players to Beer Hausen, the team that bought the Silverio franchise. Jaworski and Arnaiz eventually went to Ginebra San Miguel while King became the first \\"franchise player\\" in the history of the league when he signed up with Beer Hausen's corporate rival Gold Eagle Beer. King latched upon the deal with Gold Eagle Beer prior to the disbandment of Toyota, which excluded him in that \\"lock, stock and barrel\\" purchase by Basic Holdings of Toyota's franchise. However, since King wasn't exactly a noted scorer, he needed players who can take over the offensive chores as he took it upon himself to lead the Gold Eagle team on the defensive end. Alas, since he had average players for teammates in a young Joey Loyzaga, a raw Rudy Distrito, an oft-injured Marte Saldaña, a defensive stalwart in Dante Gonzalgo, and two veterans who never made it big despite their promise at the start - Renato Lobo and Anthony Dasalla, Gold Eagle struggled big time. And since San Miguel (the mother company of Gold Eagle) was focusing its resources more on the PBL and the NCC team, Gold Eagle couldn't get the players they wanted to be competitive against the likes of Great Taste Coffee, Beer Hausen and Tanduay Rhum. Eventually, King moved to Great Taste the succeeding year with no less than team manager Ignacio Gotao spearheading this transfer. King paradoxically found himself in unfamiliar company with past Crispa rivals Co, Bernie Fabiosa and Philip Cezar plus super rookie Allan Caidic but found the responsibilities at Great Taste lighter than when he was with Gold Eagle. He, along with Cezar, became the team's leaders as they were recognized by their peers and the younger players for their veteran smarts and skills. Ranged against the likes of Alaska's Bruise Brothers Ricky Relosa and Yoyoy Villamin, the Cezar-King combo more than held their own against the rising and younger pair of Relosa and Villamin. But what many people don't realize is that King only had one contrapelo among the players during his time. Ironically, it turned out to be his own Toyota teammate Fernandez who knew King's moves extremely well. Ditto the other way as King was also equally successful in guarding against Fernandez although the latter had more success in their matchups. Which wasn't really surprising as King wasn't the only player that had Don Ramon as contrapelo or scourge. The top centers / power forwards back then also suffered offensively when ranged against El Presidente - Gary Vargas, Rey Lazaro, Abet Guidaben, Terry Saldaña, Manny Victorino and Dondon Ampalayo feared Fernandez like a plague. King though wasn't far behind in the intimidation factor as he was also the scourge of many slotmen. =Twilight= However, an aging King suddenly found no takers during the early 1990s . Patrimonio heard of King's interest to join Tondeña and pleaded with Purefoods management to get King \\"at all cost.\\" The Captain probably feared that a Chito Loyzaga was already a major headache for him at defense, what more if you add a King? Purefoods relented and signed up King for a one-season contract with the Hotdogs where he played a major role as the defensive player assigned to guard the imports of the other teams. From a one-season stint with Purefoods, King's contract with the team was extended to another year. He won his last two PBA championships with the Hotdogs. King faded from the limelight in the mid-1990s and decided to migrate to the United States. He was the president of the PBA Legends Foundation USA.In huddle References Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:Filipino men's basketball players Category:Filipino emigrants to the United States Category:San Beda Red Lions men's basketball players Category:Magnolia Hotshots players Category:San Beda University alumni Category:Power forwards (basketball) Category:Toyota Super Corollas players Category:San Miguel Beermen players Category:Great Taste Coffee Makers players ","title":"Abe King"},{"id":"6690981","title":"All I Can Do (Dolly Parton song)"},{"id":"6690995","text":"Hilliardville is an unincorporated community in northern Wakulla County, Florida, United States.

Biography Knowles was born in Preston, Lancashire, the son of a railwayman. He joined the Navy at the start of World War II and served as a stoker aboard the destroyers and , taking part in trans-Atlantic convoys and in Operation Pedestal, the relief of Malta. In 1942 Knowles joined the Underwater Working Party, under Lieutenant Commander Lionel Crabb, at Gibraltar. Knowles was one of a group of underwater guard divers who checked for limpet mines in Gibraltar Harbour during the period of Italian frogman and manned torpedo attacks. The group dived with Davis Escape Sets, which until then had not been used much if at all for swimming down from the surface. At first they swam by breaststroke without swimfins. On 17 December 1942, during one such attack, two of the Italian frogmen (Lt. Visintini and Petty Officer Magro) died, probably killed by small explosive charges thrown from harbor-defence patrol boats, a tactic said to have been introduced by Crabb. Their bodies were recovered, and their swimfins were taken and from then on used by Knowles and Crabb. In July 1943 Knowles took part in the recovery of the body of Free Polish Commander General Władysław Sikorski, after his aircraft crashed off Gibraltar. Later his unit operated in Italy, clearing mines and obstacles, including mines from the Bridge of Sighs in Venice. Knowles left the Navy in 1950, and worked as a self-employed haulier. In 1955 Crabb took Knowles with him to investigate the hull of the Soviet cruiser Sverdlov to evaluate its superior manoeuvrability. According to Knowles, they found a circular opening at the ship's bow and inside it a large propeller that could be directed to give thrust to the bow. Crabb disappeared after a dive on the Sverdlovs sister ship, Ordzhonikidze in Portsmouth harbour in 1956, but 14 months later a body in a frogman suit was found floating off Pilsey Island. The body was mutilated and identification by relatives proved difficult. Knowles knew that Crabb had two prominent scars on his left leg; having failed to find any scars on the corpse he refused to identify it as Crabb's. An inquest jury returned an open verdict but the coroner announced that he was satisfied that the body was that of Lionel Crabb. On 26 March 2006, The Mail On Sunday published an article by Tim Binding entitled \\"Buster Crabb was murdered - by MI5\\". Binding wrote a fictionalised account of Crabb's life, Man Overboard which was published by Picador in 2005. Binding stated that, following the book's publication, he was contacted by Knowles, who now lived in Málaga, Spain. Binding alleged that he then met Knowles in Spain and was told that Crabb was known by MI5 to have intentions of defecting to the USSR. This would have been embarrassing for the UK — Crabb being an acknowledged war hero. Knowles has suggested that MI5 set up the mission to the Ordzhonikidze specifically to murder Crabb, and supplied Crabb with a new diving partner ordered to kill him. Binding stated that Knowles alleges that he was ordered by MI5 to identify the body found as Crabb, when he knew it was definitely not Crabb. Knowles went along with the deception. Knowles has also alleged that his life was threatened in Torremolinos in 1989, at a time when Knowles was in discussions with a biographer. Knowles also stated on televised interview on that Crabb did not dive alone on his fatal last mission.Inside Out - South: Friday 19 January 2007 for the BBC Knowles was played by Michael Craig in the fictionalised 1958 film The Silent Enemy about World War II divers in Gibraltar.

Although Pd- catalyzed C-N couplings were reported as early as 1983, Stephen L. Buchwald and John F. Hartwig have been credited, whose publications between 1994 and the late 2000s established the scope of the transformation. The reaction's synthetic utility stems primarily from the shortcomings of typical methods (nucleophilic substitution, reductive amination, etc.) for the synthesis of aromatic C–N bonds, with most methods suffering from limited substrate scope and functional group tolerance. The development of the Buchwald–Hartwig reaction allowed for the facile synthesis of aryl amines, replacing to an extent harsher methods (the Goldberg reaction, nucleophilic aromatic substitution, etc.) while significantly expanding the repertoire of possible C–N bond formation. Over the course of its development, several 'generations' of catalyst systems have been developed, with each system allowing greater scope in terms of coupling partners and milder conditions, allowing virtually any amine to be coupled with a wide variety of aryl coupling partners. Because of the ubiquity of aryl C-N bonds in pharmaceuticals and natural products, the reaction has gained wide use in synthetic organic chemistry, with application in many total syntheses and the industrial preparation of numerous pharmaceuticals. History The first example of a palladium catalyzed C–N cross-coupling reaction was published in 1983 by Migita and coworkers and described a reaction between several aryl bromides and N,N-diethylamino- tributyltin using 1 mol% PdCl2[P(o-tolyl)3]2. Though several aryl bromides were tested, only electronically neutral, sterically unencumbered substrates gave good to excellent yields. In 1984, Dale L. Boger and James S. Panek reported an example of Pd(0)-mediated C–N bond formation in the context of their work on the synthesis of lavendamycin which utilized stoichiometric Pd(PPh3)4. Attempts to render the reaction catalytic were unsuccessful. These reports were virtually uncited for a decade. In February 1994, Hartwig reported a systematic study of the palladium compounds involved in the original Migita paper, concluding that the d10 complex Pd[P(o-Tolyl)3]2 was the active catalyst. Proposed was a catalytic cycle involving oxidative addition of the aryl bromide. In May 1994, Buchwald published an extension of the Migita paper offering two major improvements over the original paper. First, transamination of Bu3SnNEt2 followed by argon purge to remove the volatile diethylamine allowed extension of the methodology to a variety of secondary amines (both cyclic and acyclic) and primary anilines. Secondly, the yield for electron rich and electron poor arenes was improved via minor modifications to the reaction procedure (higher catalyst loading, higher temperature, longer reaction time), although no ortho-substituted aryl groups were included in this publication. In 1995, back to back studies from each lab showed that the couplings could be conducted with free amines in the presence of a bulky base (NaOtBu in the Buchwald publication, LiHMDS in the Hartwig publication), allowing for organotin-free coupling. Though these improved conditions proceeded at a faster rate, the substrate scope was limited almost entirely to secondary amines due to competitive hydrodehalogenation of the bromoarenes. (See Mechanism below) These results established the so-called \\"first generation\\" of Buchwald–Hartwig catalyst systems. The following years saw development of more sophisticated phosphine ligands that allowed extension to a larger variety of amines and aryl groups. Aryl iodides, chlorides, and triflates eventually became suitable substrates, and reactions run with weaker bases at room temperature were developed. These advances are detailed in the Scope section below, and the extension to more complex systems remains an active area of research. Mechanism The reaction mechanism for this reaction has been demonstrated to proceed through steps similar to those known for palladium catalyzed C-C coupling reactions. Steps include oxidative addition of the aryl halide to a Pd(0) species, addition of the amine to the oxidative addition complex, deprotonation followed by reductive elimination. An unproductive side reaction can compete with reductive elimination wherein the amide undergoes beta hydride elimination to yield the hydrodehalogenated arene and an imine product. Throughout the development of the reaction the group sought to identify reaction intermediates through fundamental mechanistic studies. These studies have revealed a divergent reaction pathways depending on whether monodentate or chelating phosphine ligands are employed in the reaction, and a number of nuanced influences have been revealed (especially concerning the dialkylbiaryl phosphine ligands developed by Buchwald). The catalytic cycle proceeds as follows: For monodentate ligand systems the monophosphine palladium (0) species is believed to form the palladium (II) species which is in equilibrium with the μ-halogen dimer. The stability of this dimer decreases in the order of X = I > Br > Cl, and is thought to be responsible for the slow reaction of aryl iodides with the first-generation catalyst system. Amine ligation followed by deprotonation by base produces the palladium amide. (Chelating systems have been shown to undergo these two steps in reverse order, with base complexation preceding amide formation.) This key intermediate reductively eliminates to produce the product and regenerate the catalyst. However, a side reaction can occur wherein β-hydride elimination followed by reductive elimination produces the hydrodehalogenated arene and the corresponding imine. Not shown are additional equilibria wherein various intermediates coordinate to additional phosphine ligands at various stages in the catalytic cycle. For chelating ligands, the monophosphine palladium species is not formed; oxidative addition, amide formation and reductive elimination occur from L2Pd complexes. The Hartwig group found that \\"reductive elimination can occur from either a four- coordinate bisphosphine or three-coordinate monophosphine arylpalladium amido complex. Eliminations from the three-coordinate compounds are faster. Second, β-hydrogen elimination occurs from a three-coordinate intermediate. Therefore, β-hydrogen elimination occurs slowly from arylpalladium complexes containing chelating phosphines while reductive elimination can still occur from these four-coordinate species.\\" Application Because of the ubiquity of aryl C-N bonds in pharmaceuticals and natural products, the reaction has gained wide use in synthetic organic chemistry, with application in many total syntheses and the industrial preparation of numerous pharmaceuticals. Industrial applications include α-arylation of carbonyl compounds (such as ketones, esters, amides, aldehydes) and nitriles.Thomas J. Colacot. The 2010 Nobel Prize in Chemistry: Palladium-Catalysed Cross-Coupling. Platinum Metals Rev., 2011, 55, (2) doi:10.1595/147106711X558301 Scope Although the scope of the Buchwald–Hartwig amination has been expanded to include a wide variety of aryl and amine coupling partners, the conditions required for any particular reactants are still largely substrate dependent. Various ligand systems have been developed, each with varying capabilities and limitations, and the choice of conditions requires consideration of the steric and electronic properties of both partners. Detailed below are the substrates and conditions for the major generations of ligand systems. (Not included herein are N-heterocyclic carbene ligands and ligands with wide bite angles such as Xantphos and Spanphos which also have been developed considerably.) =First-generation catalyst system= The first generation (Pd[P(o-Tolyl)3]2) catalyst system was found to be effective for the coupling of both cyclic and acyclic secondary amines bearing both alkyl and aryl functionality (though not diarylamines) with a variety of aryl bromides. In general, these conditions were not able to couple primary amines due to competitive hydrodehalogenation of the arene. Aryl iodides were found to be suitable substrates for the intramolecular variant of this reaction, and importantly, could be coupled intermolecularly only if dioxane was used in place of toluene as a solvent, albeit with modest yields. 409x409px =Bidentate phosphine ligands= The development of diphenylphosphinobinapthyl (BINAP) and diphenylphosphinoferrocene (DPPF) as ligands for the Buchwald–Hartwig amination provided the first reliable extension to primary amines and allowed efficient coupling of aryl iodides and triflates. (It is believed that the bidentate ligands prevent formation of the palladium iodide dimer after oxidative addition, speeding up the reaction.) These ligands typically produce the coupled products at higher rates and better yields than the first generation of catalysts. The initial reports of these ligands as catalysts were somewhat unexpected given the mechanistic evidence for monoligated complexes serving as the active catalysts in the first-generation system. In fact, the first examples from both labs were published in the same issue of JACS. The chelation from these ligands is thought to suppress β-hydride elimination by preventing an open coordination site. In fact, α-chiral amines were found not to racemize when chelating ligands were employed, in contrast to the first-generation catalyst system. =Sterically hindered ligands= Bulky tri- and di-alkyl phosphine ligands have been shown to be remarkably active catalysts, allowing the coupling of a wide range of amines (primary, secondary, electron withdrawn, heterocyclic, etc.) with aryl chlorides, bromides, iodides, and triflates. Additionally, reactions employing hydroxide, carbonate, and phosphate bases in place of the traditional alkoxide and silylamide bases have been developed. The Buchwald group has developed a wide range of dialkylbiaryl phosphine ligands, while the Hartwig group has focused on ferrocene-derived and trialkyl phosphine ligands. The dramatic increase in activity seen with these ligands is attributed to their propensity to sterically favor the monoligated palladium species at all stages of the catalytic cycle, dramatically increasing the rate of oxidative addition, amide formation, and reductive elimination. Several of these ligands also seem to enhance the rate of reductive elimination relative to β-hydride elimination via the electron donating arene-palladium interaction. Even electron withdrawn amines and heterocyclic substrates can be coupled under these conditions, despite their tendency to deactivate the palladium catalyst. =Ammonia equivalents= Ammonia remains one of the most challenging coupling partners for Buchwald–Hartwig amination reactions, a problem attributed to its tight binding with palladium complexes. Several strategies have been developed to overcome this based on reagents that serve as ammonia equivalents. The use of a benzophenone imine or silylamide can overcome this limitation, with subsequent hydrolysis furnishing the primary aniline. A catalyst system that can directly couple ammonia using a Josiphos-type ligand. Variations on C-N couplings: C-O, C-S, and C-C couplings Under conditions similar to those employed for amination, alcohols and can be coupled with aryl halides to produce the corresponding aryl ethers. This serves as a convenient replacement for harsher analogues of this process such as the Ullmann condensation. Thiols and thiophenols can be coupled with aryl halides under Buchwald-Hartwig-type conditions to produce the corresponding aryl thioethers. Furthermore, mercaptoesters has been employed as H2S-equivalents in order to generate the thiophenol from the corresponding aryl halide. Enolates and other similar carbon nucleophiles can also be coupled to produce α-aryl ketones, malonates, nitriles, etc. The scope of this transformation is similarly ligand-dependent and a number of systems have been developed. Several enantioselective methods for this process have been developed. Several versions of the reaction employing complexes of copper and nickel rather than palladium have also been developed.

As part of the underwriting process, an individual's health information may be used in making two decisions: whether to offer or deny coverage and what premium rate to set for the policy. The two most common methods of medical underwriting are known as moratorium underwriting, a relatively simple process, and full medical underwriting, a more indepth analysis of a client's health information. The use of medical underwriting may be restricted by law in certain insurance markets. If allowed, the criteria used should be objective, clearly related to the likely cost of providing coverage, practical to administer, consistent with applicable law, and designed to protect the long-term viability of the insurance system.\\"Risk Classification (for All Practice Areas),\\" Actuarial Standard of Practice No. 12, Actuarial Standards Board, December 2005 It is the process in which an underwriter takes considers the health conditions of the person who is applying for the insurance, keeping in mind certain factors like health condition, age, nature of work, and geographical zone. After looking at all the factors, an underwriter suggests whether a policy should be given to the person and at what price, or premium.  Health insurance  Underwriting is the process that a health insurer uses to weigh potential health risks in its pool of insured people against potential costs of providing coverage. To search the medical underwriting, an insurer asks people who apply for coverage (typically people applying for individual or family coverage) about pre-existing medical conditions. In most US states, insurance companies are allowed to ask questions about a person's medical history to decide whom to offer coverage, whom to deny and if additional charges should apply to individually-purchased coverage. While most discussions of medical underwriting in health insurance are about medical expense insurance, similar considerations apply for other forms of individually-purchased health insurance, such as disability income and longterm care insurance.\\"Risk Classification in Voluntary Individual Disability Income and Long-Term Care Insurance\\", American Academy of Actuaries, Winter 2001 =Purpose= From the insurers' point of view, medical underwriting is necessary to prevent people from purchasing health insurance coverage only when they are sick, pregnant or need medical care. Adverse selection is a system that attracts high-users and discourages low-users from participating. Proponents of underwriting believe that if given the ability to purchase coverage without regard for pre-existing medical conditions (no underwriting), people would wait to purchase health insurance until they got sick or needed medical care. Waiting to obtain health insurance coverage until one needs coverage then creates a pool of insureds with \\"high use,\\" which then increases the premiums that insurance companies must charge to pay for the claims incurred. In turn, high premiums further discourage healthy people from obtaining coverage, particularly when they realize that they will be able to obtain coverage when they need medical care. =Effects= Proponents of medical underwriting thus argue that it ensures that individual health insurance premiums are kept as low as possible.\\"Risk Classification in Individually Purchased Voluntary Medical Expense Insurance\\", American Academy of Actuaries, February 1999 Critics of medical underwriting believe that it unfairly prevents people with relatively minor and treatable pre-existing conditions from obtaining health insurance. Diseases that can make an individual uninsurable include serious conditions, such as arthritis, cancer, and heart disease but also such common ailments as acne, being 20 lb. over or under the ideal weight, and old sports injuries. An estimated 5 million of those without health insurance are considered \\"uninsurable\\" because of pre-existing conditions. One large industry survey, from 2004, found that roughly 13% of those who applied for individual health insurance were denied coverage after undergoing medical underwriting. Declination rates increased significantly with age, rising from 5% for individuals 18 and under to just under a third for individuals to 64.Teresa Chovan, Hannah Yoo and Tom Wildsmith, \\"Individual Health Insurance: A Comprehensive Survey of Affordability, Access, and Benefits\\" , America's Health Insurance Plans, August 2005. A prior industry survey, conducted in 2002, had similar results: Thomas D. Musco and Thomas F. Wildsmith, \\"Individual Health Insurance: Access and Affordability\\", Health Insurance Association of America, October 2002. The same study found that among those who received offers for coverage, 76% received offers at standard rates 22% were quoted higher rates. The frequency of increased premiums also increased with age so for applicants over 40, roughly half were affected by medical underwriting, either in the form of denial or increased premiums. The study did not address how many applicants offered coverage at higher premiums decided to decline the policy. A study conducted by the Commonwealth Fund in 2001 found that, among those 19 to 64 who sought individual health insurance during the previous three years, the majority found it expensive, and less than a third ended up purchasing insurance. However, the study did not distinguish between consumers who were quoted increased rates by medical underwriting and those who qualified for standard or preferred premiums. Measuring the percentage of applicants who were denied coverage does not capture any effect that occurs before an application is submitted. If individuals with serious health conditions never apply because they expect that they will be denied coverage, they will not show up in the declination rate.Mark V. Pauly and Len M. Nichols,\\"The Nongroup Health Insurance Market: Short On Facts, Long On Opinions And Policy Disputes,\\" Health Affairs - Web Exclusive, October 23, 2002, note 27 Conversely, if they apply with multiple insurers in hopes of finding one that will issue them a policy, they will be overrepresented in the declination rate.Thomas D. Musco and Thomas F. Wildsmith, \\"Individual Health Insurance: Access and Affordability\\", Health Insurance Association of America, October 2002 The 2001 Commonwealth Fund study found that a majority of adults reported that it was at least somewhat difficult to find an affordable health insurance policy. Among adults over 30, the percentage reporting difficulty did not vary significantly by age. Those with health problems were somewhat more likely to report having difficulty obtaining affordable health insurance (77% versus 64% of those in good health)., Figure 1 Some American states have made medical underwriting illegal as a prerequisite for health coverage, which means anyone who asks for health insurance and pays for it will get it. States that have outlawed medical underwriting include New York, New Jersey, Maine, Massachusetts, and Vermont, which also have the highest premiums for individual health insurance.Teresa Chovan, Hannah Yoo and Tom Wildsmith, \\"Individual Health Insurance: a Comprehensive Survey of Affordability, Access, and Benefits\\" , see Tables 2 and 3. America’s Health Insurance Plans, August 2005Leigh Wachenheim and Hans Leida, \\"The Impact of Guaranteed Issue and Community Rating Reforms on Individual Insurance Markets,\\" report prepared by Milliman, Inc. on behalf of America’s Health Insurance Plans, August 2007 =Renewals= Prior to the passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2010, health insurance was primarily regulated by the states. Some states mandated individual health insurance policies as \\"guaranteed renewable:\\" once a policy had been issued, the policyholder could keep it forever regardless of medical conditions as long as the required premiums were paid. There had been instances in which insurers increased premiums at annual renewals based on an individual's claim history or changes in their health status.Terhune, Chad \\"Health Insurer's Premium Practices Add to Profit Surge, Roil Customers\\", The Wall Street Journal, April 9, 2002 That was possible when coverage was marketed to individuals by discretionary group trusts, escaping some states' rules governing the individual health insurance market.\\"The Illusion of Group Health Insurance: Discretionary Associations\\", FamiliesUSA, March 2004Terhune, Chad \\"Insurers Avoid State Regulations By Selling Via Groups Elsewhere\\", The Wall Street Journal, April 9, 2002 The insurer that was first identified by The Wall Street Journal as reunderwriting policyholders has since publicly stated it will discontinue the practice.Health Care Marketplace  American Medical Security Group Says It Will Cease 'Reunderwriting' Practices - Kaisernetwork.orgWSJ Reunderwriting However, in most cases, an insurer's ability to \\"re-underwrite\\" an existing guaranteed renewable policy is limited by contract provisions and the Affordable Care Act (previously by state law). Even so, premiums fluctuated significantly for existing policies if the average health of the policyholders with a particular product deteriorated, as often happened when rising premiums drove healthier individuals (who were able to buy other policies on more favorable terms) out of the product, leaving those who were relatively less healthy. One factor that drove that is the increase in costs, as individuals who initially pass underwriting develop health problems. In general, claim costs rose significantly over the first five years that an individual health insurance policy is in force.Leigh Wachenheim, \\"Variation by Duration in Individual Health Medical Insurance Claims,\\" Society of Actuaries, October 3, 2006. A similar occurrence had been observed in the small group health insurance market. Stephen Brink, James Modaff and Steven Sherman, \\"Variation by Duration in Small Group Medical Claims, Transactions of the [Society of Actuaries], 1991-92 Reports. Several solutions were proposed for the \\"closed block\\" problem, including requiring insurers to \\"pre-fund\\" for cost increases over the lifetime of a product, providing cross-subsidies between blocks of products by pooling products across durations, providing cross-subsidies by placing limits on the allowed variation in premiums between products, or creating state-sponsored risk pools for individuals trapped in a closed block. The American Academy of Actuaries performed a study of the proposed solutions for the National Association of Insurance Commissioners and modeled the likely impact of each. All of the solutions would increase the initial cost of a new policy and reduce cost increases over time.\\"Individual health insurance: Closed block solutions\\", American Academy of Actuaries, May 2004 =Rescissions= Insurers have the right to cancel individually purchased insurance if the insurer finds that the applicant provided incomplete or inaccurate information on the application, thereby affecting the medical underwriting process. The practice, called rescission, protects insurers from intentional fraud and affects only about 1% of individual policyholders but appears to be on the increase.Updegrave, Walter and Ashford, Kate \\"The neutron bomb of health insurance\\" Money Magazine, February 13, 2007 Rescission practices by several large insurers have attracted media attention, class-action lawsuits, and regulatory attention in several states. In 2007, California passed legislation to tighten the rules governing rescissions.California Legislative database: AB1324, chaptered October 14, 2007 In December 2007, a California appeals court ruled that a health insurer could not rescind coverage without showing that either the policyholder willfully misrepresented health or that the insurer had investigated the application before issuing coverage.Lisa Girion, \\"Court curbs insurers' ability to rescind medical policies,\\" The Los Angeles Times, December 25, 2007 Life insurance underwriting A distinction between underwriting of individually purchased life insurance and the underwriting of health insurance is generally recognized in US state-specific regulation of insurance. The general legal posture is for states to view life insurance as less of a necessity than health coverage.  Moratorium underwriting  Moratorium underwriting is an alternative method of health insurance which primarily allows for applicants to receive cover without disclosing their entire medical history. Instead, individuals will typically have any pre- existing medical conditions excluded if those have developed within the past five years. If related symptoms occur within a set period of time, then this will affect the final policy.General & Medical Moratorium underwriting is, therefore, best suited for healthy individuals who don't foresee any medical difficulties developing.  Full medical underwriting (FMU)  Full medical underwriting will require you to disclose your entire medical history to the insurer. This then allows the insurer to provide you with a list of specific exclusions based on your disclosed pre-existing medical conditions. https://healthcareclarity.co.uk/private-medical-insurance-underwriting- choices/ See also * Body mass index (BMI) * Rohrer's index References Category:Health insurance in the United States Category:Actuarial science Underwriting, Medical Category:Underwriting ","title":"Medical underwriting"},{"id":"6691132","text":"is a Japanese former track cyclist who competed at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, winning a bronze medal in the 1000 metres time trial.

He joined the dance troupe Hot Gossip and from July 1978 could be seen in their routines that featured on Kenny Everett's shows (in series one, three and four on ITV and series 6 on the BBC). He stayed with Hot Gossip until they disbanded at the end of 1986, occasionally singing lead vocals to songs in stage shows and videos, as well as dancing. In 1980 he danced with Hot Gossip in the Village People's film Can't Stop the Music, and later had a small part dancing in the Monty Python film The Meaning of Life. He also sang with a variety of celebrities and minor celebrities on the charity single \\"Doctor in Distress\\" in 1985, a song which campaigned to have the Doctor Who series returned to television, as it was on hiatus at that point. Until 1981 and the introduction of Zoo, the resident TOTP dance troupe would remain exclusively female. The three remaining female dancers, Cartwright, Hammond and Menhenick, became part of the line-up of Legs & Co., who made their debut the week after Ruby Flipper's last performance and remained as part of the resident TOTP dance troupe until October 1981.

It is located in the Pombaline Downtown of Lisbon and has been one of its main squares since the Middle Ages. It has been the setting of popular revolts and celebrations, bullfights and executions, and is now a preferred meeting place of Lisbon natives and tourists alike. The current name of the Rossio pays homage to Pedro IV, King of Portugal. The Column of Pedro IV is in the middle of the square. History and highlights =Origins= Drawing of the area around the Rossio from a 16th-century map. The square, in the middle of the image, is limited by the Estaús Palace (upper left corner of the square) and the large All-Saints Hospital (right side). The Rossio became an important place in the city during the 13th and 14th centuries, when the population of the city expanded to the lower area surrounding the Lisbon Castle hill. The name \\"rossio\\" is roughly equivalent to the word \\"commons\\" in English, and refers to a commonly owned terrain. Around 1450, the Palace of Estaus, destined to house foreign dignitaries and noblemen visiting Lisbon, was built on the north side of the square. After the Inquisition was installed in Lisbon, the Palace of Estaus became its seat, and the Rossio was frequently used as setting for public executions. The first auto-da-fé took place in 1540. In 1492, King John II ordered the building of one of the most important civil and charitative infrastructures in old Lisbon, the All-Saints Royal Hospital (Hospital Real de Todos os Santos). The Hospital was finished in 1504, during the reign of King Manuel I, and occupied the whole eastern side of the square. Old pictures show the façade of the Hospital to consist of a long building with an arched gallery. The portal to the chapel of the Hospital, facing the Rossio, had a magnificent façade in manueline style. Near the northeastern corner of the square, actually in the neighbouring St Domingo Square, is located the Palace of the Almadas, recognisable by its early 18th century red façade. In 1640, this Palace was the meeting point of Portuguese noblemen who conspired against Spain and led to the independence of Portugal from Spanish rule. The building is also called the Palace of the Independence for this reason. The Convent of St Dominic was established in the 13th century by the Rossio. Their church was greatly damaged by the 1755 earthquake and was rebuilt in baroque style. Its façade dominates the small St Dominic square. =1755 earthquake and rebuilding= A view of the Rossio in the first half of the 18th century, appearing as it did before the earthquake struck. Rossio Square in June 1968, with a TAP commercial in the background at night The south fountain Most buildings around the Rossio date from the reconstruction of the Pombaline Downtown carried out after the great 1755 Lisbon earthquake, which levelled most structures in the area, including the magnificent All- Saints Hospital. Only the Palace of the Independence survived the catastrophic earthquake. The rebuilding of the Rossio was undertaken in the second half of the 18th century by architects Eugénio dos Santos and Carlos Mardel, responsible for the typical Pombaline appearance of the buildings around the square. From the Pombaline reconstruction dates the Bandeira Arch (Arco da Bandeira), a building at the south side of the square with a baroque pediment and a big arch that communicates the Rossio with the Sapateiros Street. The Rossio became linked to the other main square of the city, the Praça do Comércio, by two straight streets: the Áurea and the Augusta Streets. After a fire in 1836, the old Inquisition Palace was destroyed. Thanks to the efforts of writer Almeida Garrett, it was decided to build a theatre in its place. The Teatro Nacional D. Maria II, built in the 1840s, was designed by the Italian Fortunato Lodi in neoclassical style. A statue of the renaissance Portuguese playwright Gil Vicente is located over the pediment of the theatre. Some of Gil Vicente's plays had been censured by the Inquisition back in the 16th century. In the 19th century the Rossio was paved with typical Portuguese mosaic and was adorned with bronze fountains imported from France. The Column of Pedro IV was erected in 1874. At this time the square received its current official name, never accepted by the people. Between 1886 and 1887 another important landmark was built in the square: the Rossio Train Station (Estação de Caminhos de Ferro do Rossio). The Station was built by architect José Luís Monteiro and was an important addition to the infrastructure of the city. Its neo-manueline façade dominates the northwest side of the square. Significance The Rossio has been a meeting place for people of Lisbon for centuries. Some of the cafés and shops of the square date from the 18th century, like the Café Nicola, where poet Manuel Maria Barbosa du Bocage used to meet friends. Other traditional shops include the Pastelaria Suíça (1922–2018) and the Ginjinha, where the typical Lisbon spirit (Ginjinha) can be tasted. The building of the Maria II Theatre and the Public Gardens to the north of the square only made the area more attended by Lisbon high society in the 19th century. Nowadays it is constantly populated by Lisboners and tourists.

It defines \\"just causes\\" as those that would promote the \\"efficiency of the service.\\" August 24, 1912, § 6, , The Act further states that \\"the right of employees ... to furnish information to either House of Congress, or to a committee or Member thereof, may not be interfered with or denied.\\"  Legislative history  Under the leadership of Republican Senator Robert M. La Follette, Sr., the United States Congress enacted the Act with the intention of conferring job protection rights on federal employees which they had not previously had. Prior to the enactment of this language, there was no such statutory inhibition on the authority of the government to discharge a federal employee, and an employee could be discharged with or without cause for conduct which was not protected under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. James Tilghman Lloyd a Democratic congressman from Missouri, lead the effort to pass the bill in the House of Representatives. The act was passed after the Theodore Roosevelt (in 1902) and Taft (in 1909) administrations prohibited federal employees from communicating with Congress without authorization from their superiors. This language was later placed in the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 and codified in . The purpose of this Act was to allow Congress to obtain uncensored, essential information from federal employees. Congress intended to allow the federal workers direct access to Congress in order to register complaints about conduct by their supervisors and to report corruption or incompetence.DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA COURT EMPLOYEES ACT OF 1999, Report of the COMMITTEE ON GOVERNMENTAL AFFAIRS UNITED STATES SENATE, to accompany H.R. 858, TO AMEND CHAPTER 17 OF TITLE 11, DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CODE, TO PROVIDE FOR PERSONNEL PROTECTION FOR DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA COURT EMPLOYEES In Arnett v. Kennedy, 416 U.S. 134 (1974),FindLaw for Legal Professionals - Case Law, Federal and State Resources, Forms, and Code the United States Supreme Court addressed questions about the Act. It held that the Act's standard of employment protection, which describes as explicitly as is feasible in view of the wide variety of factual situations where employees' statements might justify dismissal for \\"cause\\" the conduct that is ground for removal, is not impermissibly vague or overbroad in regulating federal employees' speech. One of the primary purposes of the Act was to protect those who criticize of superiors from official retribution. Senator La Follette gave the following example of an abuse sought to be cured by the bill > The cause for [the employee's] dismissal was that he gave publicity to the > insanitary conditions existing in some part of the post-office building in > Chicago where the clerks were required to perform their services. ... [H]e > furnished some facts to the press of Chicago, and the publication was made > of the conditions. They were simply horrible. ... The public health officers > of Chicago, as soon as their attention was called to the conditions, > condemned the situation as they found it; and yet this young man, one of the > brightest fellows I have met, was removed from the service because, he had > given publicity to these outrageous conditions. (1912). The Act was thus the first federal law enacted specifically to protect whistleblowers. The history and scope of the Act was further described by the Supreme Court of the United States in Bush v. Lucas, 462 U.S. 367, 103 S.Ct. 2404 (1983).findlaw.com, quoting directly from the decision > Congressional attention to the problem of motivated removals was again > prompted by the issuance of Executive Orders by Presidents Roosevelt and > Taft that forbade federal employees to communicate directly with Congress > without the permission of their supervisors. ... These \\"gag orders,\\" > enforced by dismissal, were cited by several legislators as the reason for > enacting the Lloyd–La Follette Act in 1912, , § 6.FN20 That statute ... > explicitly guaranteed that the right of civil servants \\"to furnish > information to either House of Congress, or to any committee or member > thereof, shall not be denied or interfered with.\\" FN22 As the House Report > explained, this legislation was intended \\"to protect employees against > oppression and in the right of free speech and the right to consult their > representatives.\\" FN23 In enacting the Lloyd–La Follette Act, Congress > weighed the competing policy considerations and concluded that efficient > management of government operations did not preclude the extension of free > speech rights to government employees.FN24 > Footnote 20.

Subsequent legislation In 1997, the Justice Department argued that Congress does not have a constitutional right to obtain information from civil servants through unauthorized disclosures. Based on its analysis of disclosure laws and its stance on separation of powers, Justice argued that Congress cannot vest \\"in executive branch employees a right to provide classified information to members of Congress without official authorization.\\"govexec.com In 1997, Congress adopted an anti-gag rule. The government-wide prohibition on the use of appropriated funds to pay the salary of any federal official who prohibits or prevents or threatens to prohibit or prevent a federal employee from contacting Congress first appeared in the Treasury and General Government Appropriations Act, 1998, , , (1997). In 1997, the Senate passed a prohibition that applied only to the Postal Service, while the House of Representatives passed a government-wide prohibition. The conference report adopted the House version, and a government-wide prohibition has been included in every Treasury-Postal appropriations act since fiscal year 1998.H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 105-284, at 50, 80 (1997).

Line-up The original line-up was: *Paul \\"Doug\\" Sheppard (lead guitar) *Terry Hopkinson (vocals, bass) *Paul Tognola (vocals, lead guitar) *Paul Conyers (drums). Career After building a local following, they released a heavy version of The Beatles song \\"Eleanor Rigby\\" in 1978. Ethel the Frog also contributed the song \\"Fight Back\\" to one of Neal Kay's Metal for Muthas compilations. In 1979, they signed a recording contract with EMI, which re-released the \\"Eleanor Rigby\\" single with \\"Fight Back\\" as the B-side. Their self-titled debut album was released in 1980.

Donoghue was born in Yonkers, New York. His father, an Irish immigrant, was a taxicab driver. Donoghue began boxing in a ring set up in the back of a pool hall. He won 29 or 31 amateur bouts, and turned professional at age 18. Of his first 27 professional fights, he won 25. His purses covered college tuition for his brother and sister. Donoghue's first fight in Madison Square Garden was on August 29, 1951. Donoghue's opponent was another 20-year- old, George Flores, whom he had knocked out in a match two weeks prior. Donoghue knocked out Flores in the eighth round. The blow resulted in Flores' death on September 3, 1951. Donoghue gave his winnings from that match to Flores' family, and New York instituted the requirement that boxers take a 30-day break from the ring after being knocked out. A friend of Donoghue's, writer Budd Schulberg, once asked him how far he might have gone as a fighter if not for the Flores incident. \\"He said, 'Well, I was pretty good, but I have that Irish skin and I cut pretty easily. I guess I could have been a contender,'\\" Schulberg told the New York Daily News. \\"He didn't make a big deal of it, but it really stuck in my mind.\\" And Schulberg used the line in his next screenplay, \\"On the Waterfront.\\" Director Elia Kazan agreed to pay Donoghue $75 a day to coach Brando in boxing. After Brando's first lesson, Donoghue said he had the actor \\"shooting straight jabs, and he's already learning to hook off the jab. I can make a hell of a middleweight out of his kid.\\" Donoghue also taught James Dean boxing moves in preparation for a role patterned after Donoghue in a film project that died when Dean was killed in an automobile wreck. Donoghue died in Greenport, New York of complications from Alzheimer's disease wife, Faye Moore a famous equestrian artist.

Their first home game was Saturday, October 9, 2004, an 8-2 loss against the Laval Rebels.

The turning point for the Comets was on November 27, 2004 when they won 5-3 against St. Jean, and began a 9-game winning streak. They made the playoffs and swept the Soulanges Pirates 3 games to None. In round 2 they beat Saint-Jean in 5 games with the series at 3-2 to go to the Championship finals against Louiseville Canadel. However they lost to the Canadel in Game 7. 2005-06: The Championship Season After a successful inaugural season, the Comets were back for a second season.

They played their Home opener the next night at the Cornwall Civic Complex, a 5-2 win over the Soulanges Pirates. Their longest winning streak was from November 12 to December 29, with an 11-game winning streak. At the beginning of the season, the League had 8 teams. By the playoffs, there were only 4. The Comets beat \\"Les Marquis de Sagueney\\" in 7 Games of the first round, and advanced into the Finals for the 2nd year in a row. Their opponents were their arch-rivals, St. Jean. The 1st game of the series was in St. Jean, and the Comets won by a score of 3-1. Game 2 in St. Jean was 5-3 for the Comets, with Cornwall leading the series 2-0 heading back to the Complex. Game 3 was a 4-3 win for the Comets in front of a nearly sold- out loud and pumped up home crowd. Word had spread all over the City of Cornwall that their team was just 1 win away from capturing the championship, and tickets sold out very fast. Game 4 was a 4000-plus Saturday night crowd ready to see the Comets win the title. The score ended up a 6-3 win for the Champion Cornwall Comets.

It stars Laurence Harvey as Lionel \\"Buster\\" Crabb and describes his exploits during World War II. Based on Marshall Pugh's book Commander Crabb, it was made following the publicity created by Crabb's mysterious disappearance and likely death during a Cold War incident a year earlier. It was the first Universal Pictures film in SuperScope The film depicts events in Gibraltar harbour during the World War II, Italian frogman and manned torpedo attacks, although the film's depiction of those events is highly fictionalised. For example Crabb spent several months deactivating mines brought ashore by other divers before learning to dive himself. Also the divers didn't initially wear flippers. Crabb and Knowles were the first to use them, having removed them from the Italian chariot divers. Plot The story begins with a dramatisation of the Italian manned torpedo raid on Alexandria (1941) in which two British battleships and were severely damaged. The British are worried that this new tactic will give the Italians naval supremacy in the Mediterranean, with the primary target for the Italians being the Royal Navy base at Gibraltar. To counter this threat, Bomb disposal expert Lionel Crabb (Harvey) is posted to Gibraltar. He creates an initially very small team of divers to intercept the Italian attacks and defuse the bombs. Meanwhile, from Algeciras in neutral Spain, an Italian expert on underwater operations, Antonio Tomolino (Foà), is secretly watching the British base in Gibraltar and planning new attacks. After the Italians mount a failed attack upon a cruiser in Gibraltar, Crabb and his divers recover one of the manned torpedoes and begin to repair it, with the new somewhat stringent Petty Officer Thorpe (James) coming in to take over physical and diving training. After a further series of attacks against ships in Gibraltar harbour and an attempt to recover secret documents from a wrecked aircraft, Crabb decides to visit Algeciras to discover where the Italians are operating from. After following a man with an Italian tattoo to an interned Italian ship, the Olterra, he discovers that the ships hold is being used as a workshop and base for the operations with an underwater door being used for the manned torpedo's and frogmen, which leaves them undiscovered by Spanish authorities. Crabb reports the discovery of the Olterra to his superiors but under the laws of neutrality, he cannot arrange an attack without top level authority. Meanwhile, the Italians plan a major attack on a British convoy. Crabb decides to ignore orders and with the manned torpedo repaired he and another diver manage to infiltrate the docks at Algeciras launching a pre-emptive strike on the Olterra destroying the ship, workshop and the crew. The next morning, with the convoy leaving Gibraltar, Thorpe informs Crabb that for his bravery in this operation he has been awarded the George Medal, commenting to his men \\"You all deserve the ruddy medal!\\".

Immediately after DNA synthesis, the daughter strand remains unmethylated for a short time. It is an orphan methyltransferase that is not part of a restriction-modification system and regulates gene expression. This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction : S-adenosyl-L-methionine + DNA adenine \\\\rightleftharpoons S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + DNA 6-methylaminopurine This is a large group of enzymes unique to prokaryotes and bacteriophages. The E. coli DNA adenine methyltransferase enzyme (Dam), is widely used for the chromatin profiling technique, DamID. In which the Dam is fused to a DNA-binding protein of interest and expressed as a transgene in a genetically tractable model organism to identify protein binding sites. Dam methylates adenine of GATC sites after replication.  Role in mismatch repair of DNA  When DNA polymerase makes an error resulting in a mismatched base-pair or a small insertion or deletion during DNA synthesis, the cell will repair the DNA by a pathway called mismatch repair. However, the cell must be able to differentiate between the template strand and the newly synthesized strand. In some bacteria, DNA strands are methylated by Dam methylase, and therefore, immediately after replication, the DNA will be hemimethylated. A repair enzyme, MutS, binds to mismatches in DNA and recruits MutL, which subsequently activates the endonuclease MutH. MutH binds hemimethylated GATC sites and when activated will selectively cleave the unmethylated daughter strand, allowing helicase and exonucleases to excise the nascent strand in the region surrounding the mismatch. The strand is then re-synthesized by DNA polymerase III.  Role in regulation of replication  The firing of the origin of replication (oriC) in bacteria cells is highly controlled to ensure DNA replication occurs only once during each cell division. Part of this can be explained by the slow hydrolysis of ATP by DnaA, a protein that binds to repeats in the oriC to initiate replication. Dam methylase also plays a role because the oriC has 11 5'-GATC-3' sequences (in E. coli). Immediately after DNA replication, the oriC is hemimethylated and sequestered for a period of time. Only after this, the oriC is released and must be fully methylated by Dam methylase before DnaA binding occurs. Role in regulation of protein expression Dam also plays a role in the promotion and repression of RNA transcription. In E. coli downstream GATC sequences are methylated, promoting transcription. For example, pyelonephritis-associated pili (PAP) phase variation in uropathogenic E. coli is controlled by Dam through the methylation of the two GATC sites proximal and distal to the PAP promoter. Given its role of protein regulation in E. coli, the Dam methylase gene is nonessential as a knockout of the gene still leaves the bacteria viable. The retainment of viability despite a dam gene knockout is also seen in Salmonella and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. However in organisms like Vibrio cholerae and Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, the dam gene is essential for viability. A knockout of the dam gene in Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans resulted in dysregulated levels of the protein, leukotoxin, and also reduced the microbe's ability to invade oral epithelial cells. Additionally a study on Dam methylase deficient Streptococcus mutans, a dental pathogen, revealed the dysregulation of a 103 genes some of which include cariogenic potential.  Structural features  The similarity in the catalytic domains of C5-cytosine methyltransferases and N6 and N4-adenine methyltransferases provided great interest in understanding the basis for functional similarities and dissimilarities. The methyltransferases or methylases are classified into three groups (Groups α, β, and γ) based on the sequential order of certain 9 motifs and the Target Recognition Domain (TRD). Motif I consists of a Gly-X- Gly tripeptide and is referred to as the G-loop and is implicated in the binding of the S-Adenosyl methionine cofactor. Motif II is highly conserved among N4 and N6-adenine methylases and contains a negatively charged amino acid followed by a hydrophobic side chain in the last positions of the β2 strand to bind the AdoMet. Motif III is also implicated in the binding of Adomet. Motif IV is especially important and well known in methylase characterizations. It consists of a diprolyl component and is highly conserved among N6-adenine methyltransferases as the DPPY motif, however, this motif can vary for N4-adenine and C5-cytosine methyltransferases. The DPPY motif has been found to be essential for AdoMet binding. Motifs IV-VIII play a role in the catalytic activity, while motifs 1-III and X play a role in binding of the cofactor. For N6-adenine methylases the sequential order for these motifs is as such: N-terminal - X - I - II - III - TRD - IV - V - VI - VII - VIII - C-terminal and E. coli Dam methylase follows this structural sequence. A 2015 crystallography experiment showed that E. coli Dam methylase was able to bind non-GATC DNA with the same sequence of motifs discussed; the authors posit that the obtained structure could serve as grounds for repression of transcription that is not methylation based. The X-ray crystal structure of E. coli Dam methylase shows the enzyme bound to double-stranded DNA and the inhibitor sinefungin. The adenine to be modified is shown as a blue stick flipped out of the double helix and towards the enzyme's interior.  Orphan bacterial and bacteriophage methylases  Dam methylase is an orphan methyltransferase that is not part of a restriction-modification system but operates independently to regulate gene expression, mismatch repair, and bacterial replication amongst many other functions. This is not the only example of an orphan methyltransferase as there exists the Cell cycle regulated Methyltransferase (CcrM) which methylates 5'-GANTC-'3 hemi- methylated DNA to control the life cycle of Caulobacter crescentus and other related species. Distinct from their bacterial counterparts, phage orphan methyltransferases also do exist and most notably in the T2, T4, and other T-even bacteriophages that infect E. coli. In a study it was identified that despite sharing any sequence homology, the E. coli and T4 Dam methylase amino acids sequences share sequence identity of up to 64% in four regions of 11 to 33 residues long which suggests a common evolutionary origin for the bacterial and phage methylase genes. The T2 and T4 methylases differ from E. coli Dam methylase in not only their ability to methylate 5-hydroxymethylcytosine but to also methylate non-canonical DNA sites. Despite extensive in vitro characterization of these select few phage orphan methyltransferases their biological purpose is still not clear.

A few years ago, a few residents of Shippan Point (a section of Shippan) went to the mayor and asked to make Shippan a town itself, separated from Stamford. This idea was rejected by the mayor of Stamford. The Shippan area includes Shippan Avenue, Elm Street and the smaller streets nearby.

Goodyear (1877 – 24 November 1948) was an English author of children's stories, primarily in a boys' school setting. Born in Tune Street, Barnsley, Yorkshire, on 26th October 1877 to Thomas Goodyear, a journeyman painter and his wife Christiana (nee McLintock), Robert attended Archbishop Holgate's Grammar School in Barnsley. At age seventeen he was first published with a serial in 'The Boy's Friend' periodical. He started studying law, but gave it up to devote himself full time to writing books. Initially, he earned a little money from publication of articles in penny journals like 'Titbits' and 'Answers'. In 1919 he published a volume of poems called 'Songs of a Seaside Village', and was encouraged by its success. 'I expected to sell about a dozen copies of it', he said, ' Instead it sold steadily for ten years until the whole edition of 500 copies was exhausted.' Boys' school stories followed; 'Forge of Foxenby' (Blackie, 1920) and 'The White House boys', and then 'The Boys of Castle Cliff School'. He became immensely popular, and in a survey of child users of public libraries, was voted their favourite author, along with Percy F Westerman. In his career he was the author of forty five books, most of which were boys' popular fiction with a public school setting. He also ventured into sportswriting, as well as writing two guides for aspiring writers: 'Money Making Authorship' and 'Writing for Fame and Fortune'. In the 1920s and 1930s, while living in Cloughton, a village near Scarborough, Goodyear boosted his book income with money earned from a regular column in a local (Scarborough) paper. The column, 'Scarborough Cameos', was written under the nom de plume 'Hapchance' and dealt with all aspects of life in and around Scarborough in a chatty and sometimes whimsical style. Goodyear was a firm believer in the healthful properties of living by the seaside. R A H Goodyear would work for free for causes he wanted to support; writing and producing village plays whose success raised more than five thousand pounds for clubs and charities. Advising would be writers, Goodyear said, 'Let the aspirant preserve his keenness and optimism despite disheartening rejection-forms.

The city also plans to make improvements to the Atlantic Street underpass beneath the New Haven Line railroad tracks just east of the Stamford Transportation Center in order to alleviate a traffic bottleneck.Porstner, Donna, \\"Stamford to get $7M from feds\\", The Advocate (Stamford), December 20, 2007, Stamford edition, page 1 The improvements are also meant to allow quicker evacuation of areas of the South End if disaster strikes. The project received a $245,000 earmark in the federal budget passed in December 2007. Location In relation to other neighborhoods in Stamford, the Downtown is east of the West Side (separated by the Mill River), north of the South End (separated by Interstate 95 and the Metro-North Railroad tracks) and Shippan (also separated by the highway and railroad), west of the East Side and Glenbrook, and south of Newfield, Belltown, High Ridge and Turn of River. Bull's Head, the mostly commercial area at the intersection of High Ridge Road and Long Ridge Road, is immediately north of the Downtown. The area is within walking distance of the Metro-North train station. Historic district Stamford Old Town Hall The Downtown area has been the heart of the town since colonial times. Much of the history of Stamford took place in the area. The Downtown Stamford Historic District is a historic district that was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. The originally listed area included 56 buildings along Atlantic, Main, Bank, and Bedford Streets, and examples of Late 19th and 20th Century Revivals, Late Victorian, and Commercial Vernacular architecture. Its boundaries were increased in 1985 to include an area bounded by Atlantic, Main, Bank, Bedford, Summer between Broad and Main Sts. and Summer Pl. The 1985 boundary increase captured the only surviving area in downtown of lower- rent commercial structures such as warehouses, laundries, and stables. and Its boundaries were further increased in 2002 to include an area including Late 19th And 20th Century Revivals and Modern Movement architecture, roughly, Bedford Street between Broad and Forest Streets. The 2002 increase added the 1939-built Avon Theatre and other buildings, adding Late Gothic Revival and Art Deco architectural styles not included in the first and second areas. and The current boundaries of the historic district now encompass most of the southern half of Downtown. The historic district designated in 1983 included the largest remaining area of pre-1930s commercial and institutional buildings in downtown Stamford. and The 1985 boundary increase captured the only surviving area in downtown of lower-rent commercial structures such as warehouses, laundries, and stables. The 2002 increase added the 1939-built Avon Theatre and other buildings, adding Late Gothic Revival and Art Deco architectural styles not included in the first and second areas. Downtown Stamford skyline in 2018 Distinctive architecture One Landmark Square, the second tallest building in Stamford, at 22 stories. =High rises= Over the past 15 years, Downtown Stamford has experienced a boom in high-rise building construction. *Trump Parc Stamford -- Finished in 2009, the 34-story condominium tower is currently the tallest building in Stamford at 350 feet tall. The building currently features 170 condominium units and a 6-story parking podium. It was designed by Costas Kondylis, who was well known for his high-rise residential design, especially for The Trump Organization. *Atlantic Station -- Completed in 2017 by RXR Realty, the 26-story luxury apartment tower features 325 residential units, over 20,000 square feet of retail, and 333 parking spaces. The tower is currently the second tallest building in Stamford, at 315 feet tall. A second residential tower is currently under construction adjacent to the current tower. *One Landmark Square -- Completed in 1973 at a cost of $35 million, Charles, Eleanor, \\"In the Region/Connecticut: A Landmark Becomes Less of a Fortress\\", The New York Times Real Estate section, May 1, 2005, accessed August 9, 2005 the \\"Landmark\\" in its name is no exaggeration. When it was built, the 295 ft tall, 22-story office building towered over a much lower skyline, and it remains the third- tallest building in the city, the tallest office high-rise, as well as one of the most distinctive buildings in Downtown Stamford. Five smaller buildings designed by Moshe Safdie were later built around the tower, comprising the Landmark Square office complex. *Summer House -- Completed in 2016, the 250 ft tall, 22-story residential building is the fourth-tallest building in Stamford. The steel building features 226 luxury rental units, and an Australian restaurant, Flinders Lane, on the ground floor. =Victor Bisharat's buildings= 250x250px Many of the most distinctive buildings in Downtown Stamford were designed by the late Victor Bisharat, a Jordanian who received his education at the American University in Beirut, Lebanon and at the University of California at Berkeley. His Stamford buildings were designed for F.D. Rich Co.Emporis web site, accessed July 5, 2006 (For information on Bisharat's buildings on High Ridge Road, see Arts and culture in Stamford, Connecticut.) *St. John's Towers -- The three cylindrical, 17-story towers were finished in 1971. One was demolished in 2019 to make way for a new residential development. *One Landmark Square -- 22-story building completed in 1973 was the tallest building between New York and Boston from 1973-2008. *One Stamford Forum -- Looking like an upside-down ziggurat above its three- story parking garage, the building has an enclosed arboretum rising from the ninth floor to the penthouse roof, which is covered by 76 acrylic glass domes. The 13-floor structure is 196 feet high and was completed in 1973 as the world headquarters for GTE Corporation. In the 1990s, the Tresser Boulevard entrance to the building was changed (in a design by Hellmuth, Obata & Kassabaum) from a \\"formidably stark concrete wall of a parking garage\\" to \\"a more inviting entrance ... clad in blue-gray ceramic tiles, with a lobby, canopy, colonnade and small garden\\". Dunlap, David W., \\"Stamford Reinvents Its Downtown Once Again\\", New York Times, January 5, 1997 Currently, the building is the headquarters of Purdue Pharma and Aircastle Limited. *Stamford Marriott Hotel & Spa -- The 16 floor, 305-room hotel was completed in 1976 and was the largest hotel in Connecticut at the time. The hotel was expanded to 505 rooms in 1986. =Other buildings= *One Atlantic Street -- Art Deco interiors, with murals in the ground-floor bank, and Art Deco exterior details as well. The red-brick/white marble building at the corner of Broad and Atlantic streets was finished in 1931 and for a long time was the tallest in Stamford. *University of Connecticut Campus -- The building with the vast, green glass facade at the corner of Washington and Broad streets was designed by Perkins Eastman. *Old Town Hall -- The Beaux Arts building was built from 1905 to 1907 and served as the seat of local government until the early 1960s. The building opened for business on March 20, 1907. The last mayor to work there was J. Walter Kennedy, who moved to the Municipal Office Building that was on Atlantic Street (now torn down) in about 1961. The Old Town Hall held offices for the city government until all city offices were moved to 888 Washington Blvd. in 1987.Dalena, Doug, \\"100 years ago, Old town hall had something new to offer\\", The Advocate (Stamford), page 1, Stamford and Norwalk editions250x250px *The \\"Fish Church,\\" or the First Presbyterian Church of Stamford, was designed by Wallace K. Harrison, the chief architect of the United Nations buildings in New York City, and opened in 1958. The fish shape is obvious to anyone who drives by, but the floor plan is also fish-shaped. The stained glass windows in the sanctuary contain more than 20,000 pieces of faceted glass. They depict the story of the Crucifixion and the Resurrection. The -high cross is faced with wood from Canterbury Cathedral. \\"Brilliant blues, reds and yellows make up the walls -- and seem to fill the air.

(see ) Entertainment Most of Stamford's larger entertainment venues are located in the Downtown. These include the Palace Theatre, Rich Forum, and other movie theaters. The area around Columbus Park and Bedford Street has become a center for bars, clubs, and restaurants, although all three can be found elsewhere Downtown and around the city. Events Alive@Five in Columbus Park The Stamford Downtown Special Services District, known as Stamford Downtown, hosts yearlong events including a tour of a world-class sculpture exhibit, \\"Alive@Five\\" and \\"Wednesday Nite Live\\" outdoor concerts in Columbus Park, Arts & Crafts on Bedford Street and a giant helium balloon parade that marches through downtown which bring thousands of people into the downtown. Police and fire services The main police station is located in the heart of Downtown, at 805 Bedford Street. A substation is located on Atlantic Street. The Stamford Fire Rescue Department's Fire Station's # 1 and 5 serve the neighborhood. Fire Headquarters, or Fire Station # 1 is located on Main Street, in the heart of Downtown, while Fire Station # 5 is located on Washington Boulevard, in the Woodside neighborhood, just north of Downtown. Filming locations *Almost all of Elia Kazan's 1947 film, Boomerang, was shot in Stamford and most of that in the downtown area. The Old Town Hall was used, particularly the old Police Department offices and the stairway leading up from them to the courtroom. For a scene in which a pastor was killed, the movie used the front and sidewalk of the Plaza Theatre, which stood on Greyrock Place (a driveway leading into the Stamford Town Center Mall is at that location now). The former offices of The Advocate, on Atlantic Street, were also used. \\"[I]t wasn't an oddity to run into Dana Andrews, one of the stars of the movie, in a local restaurant, or to see other stars on the street,\\" according to Don Russell, a columnist for The Advocate.Russell, Don, \\"'Roles' in movies are nothing new for city: Kazan used Stamford in the '40s\\", editorial page column in The Advocate, Stamford edition, page A10, April 25, 2007 *Part of Otto Preminger's 1963 film, The Cardinal, was shot in St. John the Evangelist Roman Catholic Church on Atlantic Street. Some people stood for hours on the east side of Atlantic Street (across the street from the church) to get a glimpse of the stars.

It was released for the Acorn Electron, Archimedes, Atari ST, Amiga, Apple IIGS, Amstrad CPC, BBC Micro, Commodore 64, MS-DOS, MSX, NES, and ZX Spectrum platforms in 1988. The game was released as Hostage: Rescue Mission in the United States and Operation Jupiter in France; the NES port is titled Rescue: The Embassy Mission. Gameplay In Hostages, a terrorist group have overrun an embassy in Paris. The player takes control of a six-man GIGN team on a mission to free the hostages. The game is split into two or three (depending on platform) distinct sections: #In the first part of the game, the player must bring three men into position so they can snipe the building. While doing so, the men must avoid the searchlights by diving for cover in doorways, windows and behind fences as well as rolling, crawling and running. If the player is caught in a searchlight, the sniper is shot at and risks being gunned down. #The second part involves entering the building with the other three men. In some versions of the game, this section is linked to the first part. The player's men abseil down the side of the building to choose which room to enter from, while the snipers who were positioned earlier can be used to shoot the terrorists through the windows. #The building must then be searched, shooting the terrorists and finding the hostages in the process. In some versions of the game, hostages must be taken to a safe room. Reception Hostages was well-received by critics. The game received 5 out of 5 stars in Dragon. Computer Gaming World gave the PC version a positive review, noting poor joystick and keyboard response was a significant problem in an otherwise \\"great\\" game. Compute! called Hostages \\"one of the better Amiga combat games\\", noting that it did not involve aliens or swords. Legacy A sequel to Hostages, Alcatraz, was released by Infogrames for the Amiga, Atari ST, and MS-DOS in 1992.

Ran is a small 25 kDa protein that is involved in transport into and out of the cell nucleus during interphase and also involved in mitosis. It is a member of the Ras superfamily. Ran is a small G protein that is essential for the translocation of RNA and proteins through the nuclear pore complex. The Ran protein has also been implicated in the control of DNA synthesis and cell cycle progression, as mutations in Ran have been found to disrupt DNA synthesis.  Function  = Ran cycle = Schematic representation of the Ran cycle Ran exists in the cell in two nucleotide-bound forms: GDP-bound and GTP-bound. RanGDP is converted into RanGTP through the action of RCC1, the nucleotide exchange factor for Ran. RCC1 is also known as RanGEF (Ran Guanine nucleotide Exchange Factor). Ran's intrinsic GTPase-activity is activated through interaction with Ran GTPase activating protein (RanGAP), facilitated by complex formation with Ran- binding protein (RanBP). GTPase-activation leads to the conversion of RanGTP to RanGDP, thus closing the Ran cycle. Ran can diffuse freely within the cell, but because RCC1 and RanGAP are located in different places in the cell, the concentration of RanGTP and RanGDP differs locally as well, creating concentration gradients that act as signals for other cellular processes. RCC1 is bound to chromatin and therefore located inside the nucleus. RanGAP is cytoplasmic in yeast and bound to the nuclear envelope in plants and animals. In mammalian cells, it is SUMO modified and attached to the cytoplasmic side of the nuclear pore complex via interaction with the nucleoporin RANBP2 (Nup358). This difference in location of the accessory proteins in the Ran cycle leads to a high RanGTP to RanGDP ratio inside the nucleus and an inversely low RanGTP to RanGDP ratio outside the nucleus. In addition to a gradient of the nucleotide bound state of Ran, there is a gradient of the protein itself, with a higher concentration of Ran in the nucleus than in the cytoplasm. Cytoplasmic RanGDP is imported into the nucleus by the small protein NUTF2 (Nuclear Transport Factor 2), where RCC1 can then catalyze exchange of GDP for GTP on Ran. = Role in nuclear transport during interphase = Ran cycle involvement in nucleocytoplasmic transport at the nuclear pore Ran is involved in the transport of proteins across the nuclear envelope by interacting with karyopherins and changing their ability to bind or release cargo molecules. Cargo proteins containing a nuclear localization signal (NLS) are bound by importins and transported into the nucleus. Inside the nucleus, RanGTP binds to importin and releases the import cargo. Cargo that needs to get out of the nucleus into the cytoplasm binds to exportin in a ternary complex with RanGTP. Upon hydrolysis of RanGTP to RanGDP outside the nucleus, the complex dissociates and export cargo is released. = Role in mitosis = During mitosis, the Ran cycle is involved in mitotic spindle assembly and nuclear envelope reassembly after the chromosomes have been separated. During prophase, the steep gradient in RanGTP-RanGDP ratio at the nuclear pores breaks down as the nuclear envelope becomes leaky and disassembles. RanGTP concentration stays high around the chromosomes as RCC1, a nucleotide exchange factor, stays attached to chromatin. RanBP2 (Nup358) and RanGAP move to the kinetochores where they facilitate the attachment of spindle fibers to chromosomes. Moreover, RanGTP promotes spindle assembly by mechanisms similar to mechanisms of nuclear transport: the activity of spindle assembly factors such as NuMA and TPX2 is inhibited by the binding to importins. By releasing importins, RanGTP activates these factors and therefore promotes the assembly of the mitotic spindle. In telophase, RanGTP hydrolysis and nucleotide exchange are required for vesicle fusion at the reforming nuclear envelopes of the daughter nuclei. = Ran and the androgen receptor = RAN is an androgen receptor (AR) coactivator (ARA24) that binds differentially with different lengths of polyglutamine within the androgen receptor. Polyglutamine repeat expansion in the AR is linked to spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (Kennedy's disease). RAN coactivation of the AR diminishes with polyglutamine expansion within the AR, and this weak coactivation may lead to partial androgen insensitivity during the development of spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy.  Interactions  Ran has been shown to interact with: * KPNB1, * NEK9, * NUTF2, * RANBP1, * RANGAP1, * RCC1, * TNPO1, * TNPO2, * XPO1, and * XPO5.  Regulation  The expression of Ran is repressed by the microRNA miR-10a.

Meredith & Co. in 1908, with the expansion of the Canadian West, the firm had started to engage in industrial merger promotion. By 1910, C. Meredith & Co. had opened an office in London and was acting as an issue house in England by at least 1913. After Dominion Securities of Toronto, C. Meredith & Co. was the first Canadian stockbrokering firm to open an office in London, enjoying excellent connections mainly through the firm's close relationship with the Bank of Montreal (of which his brother, Sir Vincent Meredith, was president), Canada's largest and most powerful commercial bank. Many of the directors of the Bank of Montreal were also directors and principal shareholders in C. Meredith & Co.Canadian Multinationals and International Finance (1992), Gregory P. Marchildon & Duncan McDowall In 1902, Meredith was elected president of the Montreal Stock Exchange, a position he held until 1905. In 1910, he became president of Hillcress Collieries Ltd., and he was a director of Tuckett Tobacco and the British & Colonial Press Service. He also sat on the Board of Arbitration and the Montreal Board of Trade. Meredith worked on the exchange for nearly twenty years, and at his retirement was one of its oldest members. His business was largely of an investment class, and he discouraged speculative ventures on the part of his clients, grounding his reputation in financial circles as one of the highest integrity.Storied Province of Quebec, Past and Present. 1912 Due to failing health, Meredith was forced to retire from business life in 1924.

Ritz-Carlton Hotel Original emblem of the Ritz-Carlton, depicting the lion rampant that was also Charles Meredith's family crest Meredith owned a plot of land at Drummond Street and Sherbrooke Street in Montreal, valued at \\"one dollar, but with good and valuable considerations\\". In 1909, he sold the land to the recently created Carlton Hotel Company of Montreal. The principal investors in the company (led by Charles Hosmer, a personal friend of César Ritz) were Sir Charles Gordon (vice-president of C. Meredith & Co., and later president of the Bank of Montreal), Sir Montagu Allan and Sir Herbert Holt. Aside from the cursory one dollar, Meredith received $787,500 in preferred shares in the Carlton Hotel Company, of which $314,404 was paid to him in cash and the balance of $469,096 was covered by \\"goodwill, benefits and advantages\\". Meredith's share made him a principal shareholder, and he had a major influence on how the Ritz-Carlton Hotel was run, and its future.Staying Connected - How the MacDougall Family Built a Business over 160 Years (2009) - James Ferrabee & Michael Harrison Marriage and residences Peel Street in Montreal Charles Meredith House at 1130 Pine Avenue West in Montreal In 1893, Meredith married Elspeth Hudson Angus (1858–1936), the eldest daughter of Richard B.

It is situated on the banks of the Nemunas River opposite Sovetsk, south from Pagėgiai, in Tauragė County. It is a border checkpoint for traffic to and from Russia (Kaliningrad Oblast). The magnificent Queen Louise Bridge (which still exists, built in 1907, though now badly scarred by World War II and rebuilt in 1946) links Panemunė to the city of Sovetsk (Tilsit until 1946) just south across the river. The landmark arch now lies on the Russian side. The main street of Panemunė History The area comprising today's Panemunė used to be the northern trans-Memel (Neman) suburb of Tilsit, then a Prussian and later also German town (as of 1871). Then Tilsit sat close to the border between Germany and Russia. After Germany's defeat in World War I, the trans-Memel suburb was disentangled from Tilsit (with the rest of the Memelland/Klaipėda Region detached from the Province of East Prussia) in 1920. The suburb was given the name Übermemel, which means over the Memel river in German. French administered the area pursuant to the Treaty of Versailles, establishing the League of Nations mandate of Memel/Klaipėda. In 1923 the newly emerged nation of Lithuania annexed the Memelland after the Klaipėda Revolt and Übermemel was given the name Panemunė. Germany re-acquired Panemunė (with all of Memelland) on 23 March 1939 - its last peaceful territorial gain before the Second World War. So Panemunė (Übermemel) was reintegrated into the city of Tilsit. Following World War II, the whole area was seized by the Soviet Union and in 1947 Übermemel, renamed as Panemunė (like all the Klaipėda Region) became part of the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic. The town's German speaking population was expelled. Border Crossing A joint project between Lithuania and Russia is currently underway to construct a new modern border crossing route for vehicles to bypass both Panemunė and the Russian city of Sovetsk. The goal is to relieve both towns of the congestion and to bring the crossing up to modern standards. The bypass involves a new bridge over the Neman river and new bypass roads around the towns. Once complete the existing border crossing over the historic Queen Louise Bridge will be for pedestrian use only.http://www.lra.lt/en.php/panemune_by_pass/14539 See also *Panemunė Castle References Category:Cities in Lithuania Category:Cities in Tauragė County ","title":"Panemunė"},{"id":"6691576","text":"Hajj (or variant spellings) is an annual Islamic pilgrimage to Mecca.

It is located within Shields Township and Libertyville Township. Knollwood shares a ZIP Code with the neighboring village of Lake Bluff, and children attend Lake Bluff schools. The residents of Knollwood were served by the Knollwood Fire Department until October 2018, after the trustees of the Rockland Fire Protection District ended their relationship with the department. Residents now receive fire protection from the Libertyville and Lake Forest fire departments. Police protection is provided by the Lake County Sheriff's Department. , the population of Knollwood was 1,747. History The name \\"Knollwood\\" first became associated with the area in the early 20th century. The Chicago, North Shore and Milwaukee railway stop, located at the intersection of Rockland Road and Telegraph Road (now Waukegan Road), was named \\"Creamer Corners\\". To the southwest of the station was a property, consisting of two farms, owned by Mrs. Granger Farwell and Mr. A.C. Accord.http://www.cityoflakeforest.com/pdf/rec/Forestry/Witness%20Tree%20Booklet%20Final.pdf This property was known as \\"Knollwood Farm\\". In 1923, Knollwood Farm was purchased by a group of wealthy Chicago businessmen (including Samuel Insull, Robert P. Lamont, Nathan William MacChesney and Thomas E. Wilson), who wished to turn the land into a country club. The following year, the Knollwood Country Club was founded, and the purchase was finalized in 1925. The community that sprang up around the club came to be known as Knollwood. The Knollwood Club now lies within the boundaries of Lake Forest. Knollwood's volunteer fire department was founded as the Rockland Fire Department and recognized by the state government in January 1947. Two years later, the department purchased their first fire engine, and a fire department building was constructed in 1951. In 1952, the Rockland Fire Department joined the Illinois Association of Fire Protection Districts and changed its name to the Knollwood Fire Department. The original firehouse was replaced with a modern facility in the same location in 2002, with the new building opening the following year. Under state statute, Trustees of the Fire Protection District Board were appointed by the Lake County Board. The trustees included Robert Grum, Dan Rogers and Carl Snoblin. Mr. Grum, a former full-time member of the Lake Forest Fire Department who retired as Deputy Chief, and Dan Rogers led the efforts to dissolve the district. Despite a referendum that required trustees to be elected, rather than appointed, and a majority of residents opposing his re-appointment, Rogers was re-appointed to his position, and along with Trustee Grum cast the voted needed to approve an Inter-Governmental Agreement that ended Knollwood FD operations on August 31, 2018. Several unsuccessful referendums for annexation into the neighboring village of Lake Bluff were held in 1978, 1982, and 1996. Geography Knollwood is located in eastern Lake County at . Knollwood is bordered by the village of Lake Bluff to the north, east, and southeast, by the city of Lake Forest to the south, and by the village of Green Oaks to the west. Downtown Chicago is to the south. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the Knollwood CDP has an area of , all of it land.  Demographics  As of the 2010 U.S. Census, the population of Knollwood was 1,747 people, occupying 668 households. The racial makeup was 85.52% White, 4.81% Asian, 4.24% African American, 3.84% identifying as another race, and 1.60% identifying as two races or more. Hispanic or Latino people of any race made up 6.35% of the population. Persons aged 0 to 4 years made up 3.49% of the population, while people aged 5 to 17 years made up 16.89%, 18–64 years at 62.51%, and people aged 65 and up at 17.12%. Men made up 47.45% of the population, while women made up 52.55%. Transportation =Road= U.S. Route 41 passes through the eastern part of Knollwood, though several sections fall within the boundaries of Lake Bluff. It leads north to Gurnee and south to Highland Park. Portions of Illinois Route 43 (Waukegan Road) and Illinois Route 176 (Rockland Road) are also located within Knollwood, although the actual intersection of the two roads lies along the Lake Bluff/Knollwood boundary. Route 43 leads north to Gurnee and south to Deerfield, while Route 176 leads east to Lake Bluff and west the same distance to Interstate 94 at Exit 16. =Rail= Knollwood was served by the Mundelein Branch of the Chicago, North Shore and Milwaukee interurban railroad until its abandonment on January 21, 1963. Since then, Knollwood has not been served by passenger rail, though the Lake Bluff Metra Station is located nearby. The Leithton Subdivision of the Canadian National Railway (Formerly the Western Subdivision of the Elgin, Joliet and Eastern Railway) runs through Knollwood, crossing Route 43 at grade. This line was built in the late 1880s as part of the short-lived Waukegan and Southwestern Railway, before it was acquired by the Elgin, Joliet and Eastern in 1891. Education Knollwood residents are served by Lake Bluff School District 65, and Lake Forest High School District 115. Public school students receive their elementary education (Kindergarten through Fifth grade) at Lake Bluff Elementary School, middle school education (Sixth grade through Eighth grade) at Lake Bluff Middle School and high school education (Ninth grade through Twelfth grade) at Lake Forest High School. The defunct Lake Bluff West Elementary School (Intended for children living in Knollwood and western Lake Bluff) was also located in Knollwood. The school was constructed in 1962 and opened in 1963. In 1994, District 65 vacated the building, and it currently serves as headquarters for the Shields Township supervisor.

The hull structure made the lorcha faster and able to carry more cargo than the normal junk. The advantage of the junk rig was in its ease of handling and resulting reduced crewing requirement, together with its relatively low cost of construction.

It is an area of mostly modest homes with some very expensive homes along the shoreline. History The Cove area was one of the first sections of Stamford to be cleared and divided among settlers. The neighborhood, which then made up most of what was called East Fields, was apportioned to various settlers between 1641 and 1665.Feinstein, Estelle S., Stamford: From Puritan to Patriot 1641-1774, published by Stamford Bicentennial Corporation, 1976, page 20 Conservative author and journalist William F.

Businessman and U.S. Representative Schuyler Merritt, for whom the Merritt Parkway is named, lived on an estate on Noroton Hill. Geography There is no defined boundary between the Cove and neighboring sections of Stamford, although it does not extend farther north than East Main Street, while Glenbrook does not extend south of it. It is bordered by the East Side to the north and northeast and by Shippan to the south and southwest. Long Island Sound lies to the south. The neighborhood is closely approximated by census tract 219, which is roughly bounded on the west by Seaside Avenue and the eastern edge of Cummings Park, and on the east by the Darien town line.

Except for Still, which he wrote in English (1972), Beckett wrote the rest in French (1960) and translated them into English later. Hardback (1976) and paperback (1977) English versions were published by Grove Press. The fizzles are also included in Grove's collection The Complete Short Prose 1929-1989. In 1976, a French version, Pour finir encore et autres foirades, was published by Editions de Minuit and another English version by Calder Publications. Because Beckett felt that the order of presentation was unimportant, each of the three publishers adopted a different one. However, the order chosen by Grove Press, in which they appear above, has become standard. Foirades/Fizzles In 1972, Vera Lindsay, who was working as an editor at Petersburg Press, conceived of a collaboration of Beckett with Jasper Johns. In 1973, Johns met Beckett in Paris, where they agreed to work together on a version of Fizzles, with the understanding that Beckett would translate his French texts into English. Because Beckett gave Johns free rein to design the book, he decided to include only five fizzles, but in both languages. In order of appearance, Johns chose fizzles: 2, 5, 1, 6, and 4. In Paris, Johns made etchings for the book, with the aid of Aldo Crommelynck. They used a variety of intaglio techniques, to create 33 images. In addition, end papers, designed by Johns, were printed as four-color lithographs by William Law at Petersburg Press. Johns took much of the imagery from his painting Untitled 1972, but he also created numerals that introduce the fizzles and a \\"table of contents\\", which incorporates stenciled letters from his repertoire. In 1976, Petersburg Press published the resulting artist's book under the title Foirades/Fizzles, in an edition of 250 copies, signed by both creators. In 1977, shortly after it was published, the book was exhibited, from October 11 to November 20, at the Whitney Museum of American Art. Since then it has appeared in numerous shows, including the landmark Museum of Modern Art exhibit: A Century of Artists’ Books, which ran from October 23, 1994 to January 24, 1995. The exhibit catalog includes an essay, Artists’ Books in the Modern Era 1870-2000, whose authors, Johnson and Stein, referring to Foirades/Fizzles, state: > This cerebral volume that provokes more questions than it answers is > considered one of the greatest artist's books of the second half of the > twentieth century. In popular culture The fizzles have had a significant impact, not only on literature, but also on music and the visual and performing arts. They have been the subject of scholarly works, and academic theses. Fizzles has inspired theatrical performances. So has the artist's book, which has also inspired modern paintings. The English composer and musician Barry Guy released in 1993 his interpretation on the eponymous CD Fizzles (Maya Recordings) playing chamber bass and double bass. His ordering of pieces is as follows (with the timings): 1 Free Fall 6:32 2 Fil Rouge 2:33 3 Hilibili Meets...The Brush 10:45 4 Five Fizzles (For S.B.) 10:40 5 Invention - The Bird Of Infinity 8:18 6 Afar 2:50 7 ...But The Clouds... 5:54 8 Tout Rouge 2:59 9 Still 8:09 10 Toujours Rouge 1:46 11 She Took The Sacred Rattle And Used It (To Ray A.

More locally, it is a thematic continuation of Sonnet 46. Paraphrase My heart and my eye have reached a mutually beneficial understanding. When my eye yearns for the sight of my beloved, or when my heart is pining, then my eye shares the sight of my beloved (seen in a painting) with my heart. At other times, my heart will share with my eye (in imagination) some memory or thought of the beloved. So whether in painting or in imagination, you are always present with me. It is impossible for you to move outside the sphere of my thoughts; I am always with my thoughts, and they are always with you. Or, if my thoughts are, as it were, sleeping, then your painting will delight my eyes and thus awake my heart. In both Sonnet 46 and Sonnet 47 the eye, as a party to the trial or to the truce is always used in the singular. The plural eyes is used in line 6 of Sonnet 46 and possibly (at least in the modern version of the text) in line 14 of Sonnet 47 but they do not refer there to the \\"defendant\\". In Sonnet 24 both singular and plural are used to refer to the eyes of the speaker. Structure Sonnet 47 is an English or Shakespearean sonnet, which contains three quatrains followed by a final couplet for a total of fourteen lines. It follows the typical rhyme scheme of the form, ABAB CDCD EFEF GG, and is composed in iambic pentameter, a type of metre based on five pairs of metrically weak/strong syllabic positions per line. The final line exemplifies a regular iambic pentameter: × / × / × / × / × / Awakes my heart, to heart's and eyes' delight. (47.14) Lines two and four contain a final extrametrical syllable or feminine ending. × / × / × / × / × / (×) Or heart in love with sighs himself doth smother, (47.4) :/ = ictus, a metrically strong syllabic position. × = nonictus. (×) = extrametrical syllable. Source and analysis The sonnet thematically continues from the \\"verdict\\" delivered by the eye and heart in the previous sonnet. Kerrigan perceives an allusion to the story of Zeuxis and Parrhasius in the \\"painted banquet\\" of line 8. Comparing the same image to similar passages in The Faerie Queene, Booth regards the image as symbolic of coldness and insufficiency. Sidney Lee suggests that the conceit of the poem inspired a passage in John Suckling's Tragedy of Benneralt. Edmond Malone notes that the figure of line 3 appears also in The Comedy of Errors; Edward Dowden notes parallels to Sonnet 75. Notes References * Baldwin, T. W.

Description Published by Adventure International and the second game of the series, after Adventureland, this text-based adventure game was one of many adventure games created by Scott Adams, in this case based on his wife Alexis' ideas. The setting was inspired by Robert Louis Stevenson's 1883 novel Treasure Island and involved a quest to retrieve Long John Silver's lost treasures. Gameplay involved moving from location to location, picking up any objects found there, and using them somewhere else to unlock puzzles. Commands took the form of verb and noun, e.g. \\"Climb Tree\\". The player started the game in a flat, and progressed via a bit of magic to Pirates Island. Here, the player had to build a ship to reach Treasure Island and there find two pieces of treasure. The player also had to contend with an unpredictable pirate ally; it was the first text adventure game of the Adams series in which the player shared the adventure with a second character. The magic phrase to reach the island in this game, 'Say Yoho', was the name of a long-running column in SoftSide magazine by Scott Adams. Source code The source code for Pirate Adventure was printed in the December 1980 issue of BYTE, with an addendum in April 1981. This enabled others to discover how the engine worked and to create their own adventures using this or a similar design. Reception Pirate Adventure was reviewed in issue #42 of The Dragon magazine.

Wright made a key defensive play in the NFC Championship game on January 10, 1982 against the Dallas Cowboys. On the Cowboys' last possession in the final minute, after Dwight Clark had made The Catch, Wright made a touchdown-saving tackle on Cowboy wide receiver Drew Pearson to preserve the 49er win and propel them into their first Super Bowl. A two-time Pro Bowler, Wright's peak performance year was during the 1983 season when he intercepted 7 passes for 164 yards and 2 touchdowns. He intercepted passes in Super Bowl XVI and Super Bowl XIX. Wright missed a majority of the 1986 and 1987 seasons with a deep groin pull and chipped bone in the area, missing all but 4 games during the two-year stretch.

Other irises with black flowers include Iris nigricans (the national flower of Jordan), Iris petrana, Iris atrofusca, Iris atropurpurea, Iris susiana, and some varieties of Iris germanica. Classification Horticultural classification: Sino-Siberian Iris, Beardless Iris. Description Iris chrysographes is a clump-forming herbaceous perennial with creeping rhizomes. The leaves are linear and greyish green, and up to long. The hollow flowering stems, long, bear slightly scented flowers in early summer. These are reddish violet to very dark violet, almost velvety black, and 6–9 cm in diameter. The outer tepals, or falls, usually have narrow golden yellow central stripes. After flowering, the leaves die down, leaving the rhizome in the earth for a dormant period until the autumn, when it sprouts into new growth. =Toxicity= All parts of the plant can cause indigestion if consumed. Cultivation Iris chrysographes requires a neutral or acid soil, in full sun. It is hardy to USDA zone 4, . Propagation is by seeds or division in the spring. Cultivars cannot be reliably grown from seed, and must be divided. For cooler areas plants do best if planted in the spring. This plant has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. =Cultivars= Some cultivars are grown, mainly \\"black\\" flowered clones under names such as 'Black Beauty', 'Black Knight', 'Black' (syn.

History The series began as a local program in Chicago, hosted by Carl Amari, who was the founder of Radio Spirits, Inc., which sells tapes and CDs of old time radio programs. Former CBS Radio executive Dick Brescia heard an in-flight version of the program, and soon mounted a nationally syndicated version of the show (through Dick Brescia Associates), beginning Jan. 1, 1990 and hosted by Art Fleming. (Amari continued to do the local Chicago version until shortly after selling Radio Spirits to MediaBay.) The show was first syndicated by Dick Brescia Associates (1990–2003), and later Wilbur Entertainment (2003–2006), and Matrix Media, Inc. (2006–2007). In the summer of 2007, the series owner MediaBay announced the company would be going out of business in September of that year and the show was subsequently purchased in September by a group headed by Norton Herrick, former CEO of MediaBay, Inc. (the company that had purchased Radio Spirits, and thus When Radio Was, back in 1999). The company has since changed ownership again in 2008, and is now owned by the former Radio Again (although the company retains the name Radio Spirits). As of 2011, When Radio Was appears on over 200 stations in the U.S., as well as one Canadian station, CHPQ-FM in Parksville, British Columbia. The program is also carried on the Radio Classics channel on Sirius XM Satellite Radio and streamed on the Internet. Radio America currently handles syndication of When Radio Was on behalf of Radio Spirits. =Hosts= Art Fleming continued to host the nationally syndicated version until shortly before his death from cancer in 1995. Satirist Stan Freberg, then writing and hosting \\"Stan Freberg Here\\", a syndicated daily commentary for Brescia, replaced Fleming. Freberg continued in the emcee role through the first week of October, 2006. For a brief period during the early Freberg years, the show's announcer was the legendary Fred Foy (of The Lone Ranger fame, who would introduce Stan with \\"Return with us now to those thrilling days of yesteryear, on When Radio Was, with your host, Radio Hall-of-Famer Stan Freberg!\\") Veteran Chicago radio personality Chuck Schaden became the next host beginning with the October 9, 2006 episode, \\"A Salute to Stan Freberg\\". A recurring feature of this version was \\"Speaking of Radio...\\", featuring excerpts from Chuck's historic interviews with many of the stars and \\"behind the scenes\\" people responsible for the classic shows (also a feature of Chuck's long-running \\"Those Were The Days\\"). It was at this time that the series expanded to seven shows per week (a format which continues with the Greg Bell version). Illinois native Greg Bell, host and programmer for Sirius XM's Radio Classics channel, became the fourth national host of the series as of October 8, 2007.

Jurisdiction The Civilian Board of Contract Appeals decides disputes between Government contractors and Executive agencies of the United States. The Board's authority extends to all Executive agencies other than the Department of Defense, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the United States Postal Service, the Postal Rate Commission, the Federal Aviation Administration ((d)(4)), and the Tennessee Valley Authority. Its original jurisdiction over claims involving Government contract disputes partially overlaps as concurrent jurisdiction with the United States Court of Federal Claims under the Contract Disputes Act of 1978, and the \\"Big\\" Tucker Act (), but not the United States district courts for claims less than $10,000 under the \\"Little\\" Tucker Act ((a)(2)). The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit may exercise appellate jurisdiction over decisions of the Board involving Government contract disputes ( and (a)(1)). The Board also hears and decides various additional classes of cases, including: *Cases arising under the Indian Self-Determination Act, et seq.; *Disputes between insurance companies and the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Risk Management Agency involving actions of the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation under et seq.; *Claims by Federal employees under for reimbursement of expenses incurred while on official temporary duty travel or in connection with relocation to a new duty station; *Claims by carriers or freight forwarders under (i)(1) involving actions of the General Services Administration regarding payment for transportation services; *Claims under the Federal Emergency Management Agency's Public Assistance Grant Program funding resulting from damages incurred by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita (); and *Claims for the proceeds of the sale of property of certain Federal civilian employees who are dead, ill, or missing under . Procedure The Board uses a variety of techniques intended to shorten and simplify, when appropriate, the formal proceedings normally used to resolve contract disputes. The Board fully supports the use of alternative dispute resolution (ADR) in all appropriate cases; it encourages the prompt, expert, and inexpensive resolution of contract disputes as promoted by the Administrative Dispute Resolution Act. In addition, the Board provides to other Executive agencies, when jointly requested by an agency and its contractor, alternative dispute resolution services on contract-related matters, whether arising before or after a contract has been awarded.

More recently evolved organisms, such as mammals, appear to be much more complex than organisms, such as bacteria, which have existed for a much longer period of time. However, there are theoretical and empirical problems with this claim. From a theoretical perspective, it appears that there is no reason to expect evolution to result in any largest-scale trends, although small-scale trends, limited in time and space, are expected (Gould, 1997). From an empirical perspective, it is difficult to measure complexity and, when it has been measured, the evidence does not support a largest-scale trend (McShea, 1996). History  Many of the founding figures of evolution supported the idea of Evolutionary progress which has fallen from favour, but the work of Francisco J. Ayala and Michael Ruse suggests is still influential. Hypothetical largest-scale trends McShea (1998) discusses eight features of organisms that might indicate largest-scale trends in evolution entropy, energy intensiveness, evolutionary versatility, developmental depth, structural depth, adaptedness, size, complexity. He calls these \\"live hypotheses\\", meaning that trends in these features are currently being considered by evolutionary biologists. McShea observes that the most popular hypothesis, among scientists, is that there is a largest-scale trend towards increasing complexity. Evolutionary theorists agree that there are local trends in evolution, such as increasing brain size in hominids, but these directional changes do not persist indefinitely, and trends in opposite directions also occur (Gould, 1997). Evolution causes organisms to adapt to their local environment; when the environment changes, the direction of the trend may change. The question of whether there is evolutionary progress is better formulated as the question of whether there are any largest-scale trends in evolution (McShea, 1998). That is, is there a consistent directional change throughout the history of life on Earth? Theoretical perspective Organisms adapt to their local environment. As long as the local environment is stable, we can expect to observe small-scale trends, as organisms become increasingly adapted to the local environment. Gould (1997) argues that there are no global (largest-scale) trends in evolution, because traits that are advantageous for some local environment are detrimental for some other local environment. Although it is difficult to measure complexity, it seems uncontroversial that mammals are more complex than bacteria. Gould (1997) agrees, but claims that this apparent largest-scale trend is a statistical artifact. Bacteria represent a minimum level of complexity for life on Earth today. Gould (1997) argues that there is no selective pressure for higher levels of complexity, but there is selective pressure against complexity below the level of bacteria. This minimum required level of complexity, combined with random mutation, implies that the average level of complexity of life must increase over time. Gould (1997) uses the analogy of a random walk that begins near a wall. Although the walk is random, the walker cannot pass through the wall, so we should expect the walker to move increasingly further from the wall as time passes. This does not imply that the walker is driven away from the wall. The wall is analogous to the complexity level of bacteria. We should expect evolution to wander increasingly further from this level of complexity, but it does not imply that evolution is driven towards increasing complexity. In response to Gould's (1997) critique, Turney (2000) presents a computational model in which there is a largest-scale trend towards increasing evolutionary versatility. This trend requires continual change. Although this model shows that largest-scale trends are compatible with evolutionary theory, the model has not yet been empirically confirmed. Empirical perspective Evolutionary theory might not predict largest-scale trends, but there may be such trends nonetheless. McShea (1996) looks at the empirical evidence for a trend towards increasing complexity in Metazoan fossils. He concludes that the evidence is not decisive and further investigation is required.

He was later a member of Dog Soldier, and variously worked with Rory Storm, The Artwoods and John Mayall. Biography Keith Hartley was born in Plungington, north-west Preston, Lancashire. He studied drumming under Lloyd Ryan, who also taught Phil Collins the drum rudiments. His career began as the replacement for Ringo Starr as a drummer for Rory Storm and the Hurricanes, a Liverpool-based band, after Ringo joined The Beatles. Subsequently he played and recorded with The Artwoods, then achieved some notability as John Mayall's drummer (including his role as the only musician, other than Mayall, to play on Mayall's 1967 \\"solo\\" record The Blues AloneLee Zimmerman, \\"Happy Birthday, John Mayall!\\" New Times Broward- Palm Beach, 29 November 2011.). He then formed The Keef Hartley (Big) Band, mixing elements of jazz, blues, and rock and roll; the group played at Woodstock in 1969. However, the band was the only artist that played at the festival whose set was never included on any officially released album (prior to 2019), nor on the soundtrack of the film. They released five albums, including Halfbreed and The Battle of North West Six (characterised by a reviewer for the Vancouver Sun as \\"an amazing display of virtuosity\\").Al Rudis, \\"The Best of the British\\", Vancouver Sun, 25 May 1970, p.95. While in John Mayall's band, Mayall had pushed Hartley to form his own group. A mock-up of the \\"firing\\" of Hartley was heard on the Halfbreed album's opening track, \\"Sacked.\\" The band for the first album comprised: Miller Anderson, guitar and vocals, Gary Thain (bass), later with Uriah Heep; Peter Dines (organ) and Ian Cruickshank (as \\"Spit James\\") (guitar). Later members to join Hartley's fluid lineup included Mick Weaver (aka Wynder K. Frog) organ, Henry Lowther (b. 11 July 1941, Leicester, England; trumpet/violin), Jimmy Jewell (saxophone), Johnny Almond (flute), Jon Hiseman and Harry Beckett. Hartley, often dressed as an American Indian sometimes in full head-dress and war-paint, was a popular attraction on the small club scene. His was one of the few British bands to play the Woodstock Festival, where his critics compared him favourably with Blood Sweat And Tears. \\"The Battle Of NW6\\" in 1969 further enhanced his club reputation, although chart success still eluded him. By the time of the third album both Lowther and Jewell had departed; however, Hartley always maintained that his band was like a jazz band, in that musicians could come and go and would be free to play with other aggregations. After that Hartley released a 'solo' album (Lancashire Hustler, 1973) and then he formed Dog Soldier with Miller Anderson (guitar), Paul Bliss (bass), Derek Griffiths (guitar) and Mel Simpson (keyboards). They released an eponymous album in 1975, which had a remastered release in early 2011 on CD on the Esoteric label. In 2007, Hartley released a ghostwritten autobiography, Halfbreed (A Rock and Roll Journey That Happened Against All the Odds).Gary Graff, \\"Woodstock at 40: Where are they now\\", Billboard, 30 July 2009. Hartley wrote about his life growing up in Preston, and his career as a drummer and bandleader, including the Keef Hartley Band's appearance at Woodstock.

It is part of the Fair Youth sequence, in which the poet expresses his love towards a young man. It is a continuation of the argument from Sonnet 50. According to the Norton Anthology, sonnet 51 is considered part of the \\"long sequence\\" (18-126) and focuses on the young man who Shakespeare wrote about in the preceding group of sonnets namely the first 17 sonnets known as the procreation sonnets. This poem focuses on a young man fighting time to return to his lover, and includes description of haste and timeliness. Structure Sonnet 51 is an English or Shakespearean sonnet. An English sonnet contains three quatrains, followed by a final rhyming couplet. It follows the form's typical rhyme scheme, ABAB CDCD EFEF GG, and is composed in a type of poetic metre called iambic pentameter based on five pairs of metrically weak/strong syllabic positions. The sixth line exemplifies a regular iambic pentameter: × / × / × / × / × / When swift extremity can seem but slow? (51.6) :/ = ictus, a metrically strong syllabic position. × = nonictus. The fifth line, while it may be scanned as a regular iambic pentameter, may also be scanned with two variations: / × × / × × / / × / O! what excuse will my poor beast then find, (51.5) The first is an initial reversal, the second a rightward movement of the third ictus (resulting in a four-position figure, \`× × / /\`, sometimes referred to as a minor ionic). There are seven possible initial reversals in this sonnet (in lines one, four, five, seven, eight, thirteen, and fourteen), three possible mid-line reversals (in lines three, eleven, and twelve) and two possible minor ionics (moving the first ictus of line two, and the third ictus of line five).

After leaving the club in May 1909, Parry along with the then Liverpool captain Alex Raisbeck joined Scottish side Partick. He would join Wrexham in 1910 before emigrating to South Africa in 1911. Parry played for Wales on 14 occasions making his debut against Ireland on 23 March 1901 in a British Championship match. Coaching and management career After leaving Thistle Parry went into coaching and got a post in South Africa but moved back to Oswestry to take up a role with Oswestry Town. Parry then, like many others, was affected by the First World War of 1914/1918 where he was badly gassed during military service on the Western Front, but he returned to his passion after the war taking the managerial post at Rotherham County, who later merged with Rotherham Town to form Rotherham United in 1925. Parry then took up coaching roles with the more impressive clubs of Barcelona in Spain and both Eintracht Frankfurt and 1. FC Köln in Germany before returning to the British Isles taking up a coaching role on the Channel Islands. Parry's association with the Anfield club was to be reunited when he took up a coaching role at Liverpool quite some time after leaving in 1909. He died in nearby Bootle, aged 57.

According to the Samguk Sagi, it was established when Buyeo's king Hae Buru () moved the capital eastward by the sea. Founding According to the Samguk Sagi and other accounts, the kingdom of Dongbuyeo branched out to the east of Bukbuyeo, near the land of Okjeo. Hae Buru found a golden frog-like child under a large rock. Hae Buru named the child Geumwa, meaning golden frog, and later made him crown prince. Early Eastern Buyeo Geumwa became king after Hae Buru's death. Not long after, King Geumwa reversed his father's submission to Bukbuyeo and declared himself \\"Supreme king\\" and gave the title posthumously to his father, Hae Buru. At Ubalsu, south of Taebaek Mountain, Geumwa met Lady Yuhwa (), who was the disowned daughter Habaek (), the god of the Amnok River or, according to an alternative interpretation, the sun god Haebak (). and brought her back to his palace. She was impregnated by sunlight and laid an egg, from which hatched Jumong (). Geumwa's two sons resented Jumong, and although Geumwa tried to protect him, Jumong ran away to Jolbon Buyeo, where he later established Goguryeo. Geumwa's eldest son Daeso became the next King. King Daeso attacked Goguryeo during the reign of its second ruler, King Yuri. Goguryeo's third ruler King Daemusin attacked Dongbuyeo and killed King Daeso. After internal strife, Dongbuyeo fell, and its territory was absorbed into Goguryeo. Later Eastern Buyeo According to other records, Jumong was from Bukbuyeo, not Dongbuyeo. According to the Gwanggaeto stele, Dongbuyeo was a tributary of Goguryeo. Dongbuyeo was briefly revived by a small state established around 285 by refugees of Buyeo.

They are round and usually filled with jelly, marmalade, jam or chocolate as well as butter, nutella and cinnamon. They can also be filled with custard, or cream, but that is usually less common. The name comes from German Krapfen, and it is a variation of the Central European pastry known as the Berliner. They are also similar to beignets. The recipe for homemade krofne includes yeast, milk, sugar, flour, salt, butter, eggs, rum, lemon peel, marmalade and powdered sugar. The dough is kneaded and prepared and then cut into small pieces, then made into a little ball, making it easier to cook. In Croatia and Slovenia, the consumption of krofne, or krofi, increases significantly during the yearly winter festival of Carnival.

It ranges throughout the southern oceans and is found on small islands around Antarctica as well as on the shores of the mainland. Its diet consists primarily of small fish and crustaceans. It is very similar in appearance to the closely related Arctic tern, but it is stockier, and it is in its breeding plumage in the southern summer, when the Arctic tern has shed old feathers to get its non-breeding plumage. The Antarctic tern does not migrate like the Arctic tern does, but it can still be found on a very large range. This tern species is actually more closely related to the South American tern. Gulls, skuas and jaegers are the primary predators of the bird's eggs and young. The Antarctic tern can be further divided into six subspecies. The total global population of this bird is around 140,000 individuals.  Description  The Antarctic Tern is a medium-sized tern ranging from 35 to 40 cm in length with a wingspan of 74 to 79 cm. It weighs between 150 and 180 g but it tends to be heavier during the winter months. In breeding plumage, the tern has light grey body and wings. Its deeply forked tail, lower back just above it and cheeks are white. It also has a distinctive black cap that reaches from the nape down to the bill and the eye is brownish-black. The bill, legs and feet are bright red. In non-breeding plumage, the black cap is reduced to just the area behind the eyes, the underparts become lighter and the bill becomes a dull reddish- black colour. Juveniles have yellowish-brown, grey, and white spots on their backs, with a yellowish-brown belly and breast. Their bill is dull black and the legs are dull red. The chicks have a yellowish-brown colour with black spots on their heads and back. They have a greyish white belly with a darker throat. The bill, legs and feet can be flesh colored or reddish black. The Antarctic tern resembles closely to the Arctic tern. However, the local Antarctic Terns are in their breeding plumage when the migrating Arctic Terns arrive in their non-breeding plumage. Arctic terns also have shorter legs and more prominent black margins on the outside of their primary feathers. The white-fronted tern is also quite similar to the Antarctic tern but it can be distinguished by the larger body size, lighter colors, and longer black bill of the white-fronted tern. The different subspecies vary in size and plumage tone but are often hard to distinguish from one another.

File:Antarctic Tern at Moltke Harbour.jpgAntarctic tern in flight File:Antarctic tern in flight.jpgAntarctic tern in flight, seen from below.  Taxonomy  Terns are in the family Laridae along with gulls and skimmers. Terns make up the sub-family Sterninae, which spreads into eleven genera. The Antarctic terns are in the genus Sterna, which is has been established to be monophyletic. However, this claim has been challenged by a genetic study. Six subspecies of Antarctic tern have been recognized and are distinguished by their breeding sites on different islands around Antarctica. =Subspecies= There are six recognized subspecies of the Antarctic tern, each with their specific breeding sites. *S. v. tristanensis (Murphy, 1938) – Tristan da Cunha & Gough Island *S. v. sanctipauli (Gould, 1865) – St. Paul & Amsterdam Islands. *S. v. georgiae (Reichenow, 1904) – South Georgia, South Orkney & South Sandwich Islands *S. v. gaini (Murphy, 1938) – South Shetland Islands, Antarctic Peninsula & nearby islands *S. v. vittata (Gmelin, 1789) – Prince Edward, Crozet, Kerguelen, Bouvet & Heard Islands *S. v. bethunei (Buller, 1896) – Stewart, Snares, Auckland, Bounty, Antipodes, Campbell & Macquarie Islands Habitat and Distribution alt= The Antarctic tern prefers rocky areas such as islets, with or without vegetation, often among other seabird species. It usually nests on cliffs but is also found on rocky beaches, places inaccessible to cats or rats. It also avoids beaches with sea lions, as they tend to occupy all flat areas. Outside of the breeding season, this species of tern looks for ice edges in Antarctica. It also visits South Africa’s beaches and rocky cliffs. This species has a large range, widely distributed around sub-Antarctic islands of the southern hemisphere and the Antarctic mainland. The breeding territory of the Antarctic tern includes Antarctica, Bouvet Island, the French Southern Territories, Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha, South Africa, South Georgia, and the South Sandwich Islands. Recently, some populations have been found to take advantage of newly ice-free terrain on the north-eastern Antarctic Peninsula when nesting. Each subspecies have specific breeding islands. After breeding, the Antarctic tern does not undertake a long migration to the opposite pole like the Arctic tern does. It usually remains close to the breeding islands all year round. However, the more southern populations migrate slightly further north for the rest of the year. They can be found in Uruguay, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, the Falkland Islands, the Heard Island, the McDonald Islands, Australia, and New Zealand.  Behavior  = Vocalizations = Antarctic terns are quite noisy around their roost sites. “trr-trr-kriah” is their main call and is given when they are in flight or fishing. They also use a “chrrrr” to defend their nests against intruders or predators. They make a higher- pitched call to catch the attention of their mates. Antarctic tern feeding on Antarctic krill. = Diet = The Antarctic tern is an opportunistic feeder that mostly eats small fishes as well as some crustaceans like Antarctic krill. It usually fishes gregariously, forming flocks of up to 100 birds when they locate larger shoals. It fishes by hovering a few meters above the sea. When a prey is located, the tern has two strategies: most of the time it will directly plunge dive and become completely submerged but if the water is too rough it will only submerge its bill whilst in flight. It normally forages near the shore in the kelp zone. It has also been found in the intertidal zone, scavenging for small crustaceans, polychaetes, and shellfish. However, during the breeding season, it does not venture very far from its nest. = Reproduction = Antarctic tern brooding on King George Island The Antarctic tern usually breeds from November to December, but this can vary depending on climate and the availability of food. The birds are usually found in loose colonies of 5 to 20 pairs, although they may also nest as isolated pairs. However, some islands are home to much larger populations and have colonies of over 1000 pairs. This tern species usually selects depressions or scrapes on the cliff ledge for nesting. It can also be found nesting on the soil, sand, glacial moraines, or a vegetation mat, often within a small pit of pebbles or shells. The female will lay one or two eggs per breeding season, which will be incubated by both parents for a period of 23 to 25 days. Chicks hatch during the summer months, from December to February. Then, the chicks need to be fed by their parents for 27 to 32 days while they grow fully developed flight feathers. Both members of the pair attend their young for several weeks even after this period. Antarctic terns that survive their first year have a life expectancy of about 17 years with an estimated reproductive time span of about 10 years as they can start breeding at 3 years old. Gulls, skuas and jaegers feed on the eggs and chicks. The larger water birds also prey upon the adults, leaving young chicks exposed to the harsh weather conditions and starvation. The Antarctic tern will defend its nest against any intruders by repeated dive bombing, occasionally striking them with their sharp bill.  Threats and Conservation  The IUCN Red List classifies the Antarctic tern as a species of least concern in terms of conservation status. The population is stable and is currently estimated to be between 132,000–145,000 individuals, with about 45,000 breeding pairs. The majority are from the subspecies S. v. gaini. However, reproduction failures have been recorded on certain islands mostly due to introduced mammalian predators, namely domestic cats and rats.

Origins Born on or by 22 August 1509 at Monken Hadley in Middlesex, he was the second son of William Stanford, a mercer in the City of London, and his wife Margaret Gedney. His father was a younger son of Robert Stanford, of Rowley Regis in Staffordshire. Career After some time at the University of Oxford, he then studied law, entering Gray's Inn in 1528 and being called to the bar in 1536. At Gray's Inn, he was chosen Reader in 1544 and 1551. By 1542, with a powerful friend at court in Sir Thomas Wriothesley and being owed money by Henry Stafford, he was elected MP for Stafford in the 1542 and 1545 Parliaments, and for Newcastle-under-Lyme in the 1547 Parliament. Though based in Middlesex, he developed Staffordshire links by buying the manors of Perry Barr and Handsworth. From 1542 to 1555, he was appointed to many royal commissions, some ranging over all England and Wales and some limited to Middlesex. In 1543 he was made a justice of the peace for Middlesex, later sitting on the bench for Cornwall, Devon, Dorset, Hampshire, Somerset and Wiltshire. Made a serjeant-at-law in 1552, Queen Mary I promoted him to Queen's Serjeant in 1553. Next year, though his prosecution of Sir Nicholas Throckmorton for treason was unsuccessful (with Throckmorton praising him for his erudition and honesty), he was appointed a justice of the Court of Common Pleas and was knighted the following year. Though a Catholic, he is reported to have treated Protestants fairly. He made his will on 4 April 1558 and died at Monken Hadley on 28 August, leaving his wife as executrix and his eldest son as heir. Writings He is said to have prepared the first printed edition of Glanvill’s Tractatus de legibus et consuetudinibus regni Anglie and in 1557 published the first textbook of English criminal law; Les Plees del Coron. In 1567 his An Exposicion of the Kinges Prerogative (which he wrote in 1548) was published. William Fulbecke wrote in A Direction or Preparative to the Study of the Law (1600): > In Master Staunford there is force and weight, and no common kind of stile; > in matter none hath gone beyonde him, in method, none hath overtaken him; in > the order of his writing hee is smoothe, yet sharpe, pleasant, but yet > grave; famous both for Judgement in matters of his profession, and for his > great skill in forraigne learning, And surely his method may be a Law to the > writers of the Law which succeed him.Quoted in G. R. Elton, 'The rule of law > in sixteenth-century England', Studies in Tudor and Stuart Politics and > Government: Volume I (Cambridge University Press, 1974), p. 264. Family He married Alice, daughter of John Palmer (died 1542), of Kentish Town and his wife Eleanor (died 1558), daughter of Edward Cheeseman and sister of Robert Cheeseman. They are recorded as having six sons and five daughters, including: :Sir Robert (1540-1607), the eldest son, who remained a Catholic and moved to Perry Hall in Staffordshire, becoming sheriff of that county in 1589 and MP in 1604. :Ralph, a Catholic priest.

Eight designs of Canon FD 200 mm lens were produced for the Canon FD lens mount. These spanned two generations (FD and New FD) and varied by aperture and macro ability. These photographic lenses were:  Canon FD  * 200 mm 2.8 S.S.C.: This lens, introduced in 1975, was identical to the first version of the New FD 200 mm except for the mounting hardware. * 200 mm 4.0: Introduced in 1971, this early version did not have Super Spectra Coating. * 200 mm 4.0 S.S.C.: introduced in 1973, this replaced the original, Spectra Coated version of this lens; as well as improved coating, the weight was reduced by 50 g, with dimensions unchanged. This lens had a built-in lens hood.  Canon New FD  The New FD range changed the method by which the lens locked to the lens mount; instead of the silver locking ring at the base rotating while the rest of the lens remained still, the whole lens barrel rotated to lock the lens, even though the actual mating surfaces of the breech-lock mount remained stationary in respect to each other. This made the lenses attach more like the bayonet-lock mounts of other brands, and did away with the criticism that Canon lenses were more slow and fiddly to mount. All New FD lenses were Super Spectra Coated, and thus the distinguishing nomenclature was no longer needed. * 200 mm 1.8 L: This was Canon's final FD lens, introduced in November 1989, a year after its autofocus Canon EF equivalent, the EF 200 mm 1.8 L, due to demand from photographers yet to switch from the FD to the EOS system. * 200 mm 2.8: This lens was a New FD updating of the previous 200 mm 2.8 lens, replacing the locking ring of the old FD system with the rotating barrel locking mechanism of the New FD series but otherwise little updated. * 200 mm 2.8 II: The second revision of the New FD 200 mm 2.8 adopted a rear focusing system, in which only the rear group of the lens moves to adjust focus, meaning that the overall length of the lens does not change and focusing is easier. The number of optical elements was increased from 5 elements in 5 groups, to 7 elements in 6 groups; the size and weight increased, and the close focusing was improved. * 200 mm 2.8 III: The very last version was changed to an internal focusing system. * 200 mm 4.0: Completely reworked from the old FD lens, this new lens was the smallest and lightest FD 200 mm lens by a substantial margin. Like the newer version of the 200 mm 2.8, the 4 is a rear-focusing design that does not extend or retract during focusing.

The company was founded in Dublin by Thomas Grubb as the Grubb Telescope Company in 1833.Backyard Voyager Page 1 Thomas Grubb was joined in 1864 by his son Howard who built on the company's reputation for quality optical instruments. Grubb was also known for building accurate electrically driven clock drives for equatorial mounted telescopes. The technology for doublets was not so easy to come by, Grubb purchased this technology from the maker Guinand in 1838, who ten years later would go to work from Grubb during the 1848 revolution, according to History of Astronomy: An Encyclopedia. Some of the telescopes produced in the 19th century include the Great Melbourne Telescope, a 48-inch-diameter (1.2 m) reflecting telescope with speculum primary mirror, the 27-inch refractor for the Vienna Observatory (1878), the 10-inch refractor at Armagh Observatory (1882), the 28-inch refractor at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich (1893), which is the UK's largest refractor, and the 10-inch refractor at Coats Observatory, Paisley (1898). In 1887 Grubb's firm built seven normal astrographs for the Carte du Ciel international photographic star catalogue project, 13 inch refracting telescopes all designed to produce uniform photographic plates. In 1925 the company was acquired by Sir Charles Parsons and renamed.Backyard Voyager Page 2 The company traded until 1985, designing and building the optical components for telescopes such as the Anglo- Australian Telescope, UK Infrared Telescope, Isaac Newton Telescope and the William Herschel Telescope, all of which are important astronomical instruments currently in use.Astronomy Knowledge Base A partial history of the company was written by its last managing director, George M.

It consists of short stories and poems, and line drawings, often surreal in nature. The book was the first solo project by one of the members of the Beatles in any creative medium. It was followed in 1965 by A Spaniard in the Works. Background In His Own Write was Lennon's first book, and was originally published in March 1964 by Simon & Schuster of New York, and Jonathan Cape of Great Britain. Although first issues credit only Simon & Schuster, first run issues of the book were distributed by both publishing companies at the same time. Printed in Great Britain, it enjoyed immediate success. Reported in an article by Tom Wolfe, an initial printing in England sold 50,000 copies the first day, and Simon & Schuster had a first printing of 90,000 in the USA. There have been numerous reprints and subsequent editions, in hard cover and paperback, as recent as the year 2010. The first edition preface was written by Paul McCartney. Lennon was adept at free association and improvisation in his linguistic explorations, which can be seen in both his prose writing and a portion of his lyrics. Use of puns, near-homonyms, bizarre imagery, disconnected narrative threads and references, creative misspellings, and abrupt, unresolved conclusions challenge the reader to either find meaning, or bring their own meaning to the text. It can be inferred that Lennon intended no deep meaning, but rather wanted to demonstrate his free-form creative abilities as well as his sense of humour. Lennon used the phrase \\"a hard day's night\\" at one point, in one of his stories, \\"Sad Michael\\".\\"There was no reason for Michael to be sad that morning, (the little wretch); everyone liked him, (the scab). He'd had a hard day's night that day, for Michael was a Cocky Watchtower.\\" That phrase was coined by Ringo Starr and later used as a title for a song, an album, and a movie. Offered in hard cover it featured a photo of John Lennon taken by Robert Freeman. True, original, first run copies of this book can be identified by a few specific details. Most notable of these is a red sticker, measuring , with rounded corners that reads \\"The writing Beatle!\\". Some first run issues have been seen without this sticker. Additionally, there is a small printed price marking of $2.50 on the bottom left corner of the back cover. The main title page, on the fourth page, reads \\"Simon & Schuster, New York 1964\\", as the only publishing credit; the verso has just a copyright symbol followed by \\"1964 by John Lennon\\" in the top third of the page, and \\"Cover photograph by Robert Freeman\\", with \\"Printed in Great Britain\\" beneath that, in the bottom third of the page. Simon & Schuster is also printed on the bottom of the spine, below the title \\"John Lennon In His Own Write\\". Adaptations The book was also transformed into a play, co-authored with the American playwright Adrienne Kennedy and Victor Spinetti, who directed, at the National Theatre, premiering on 18 June 1968, at the Old Vic.Premiere of In His Own Write stage play Spinetti and Lennon appeared together in June 1968 on BBC2's Release. During the interview, Spinetti said of the play, \\"it’s not really John’s childhood, it’s all of ours really, isn’t it John?\\" John Lennon, assuming a camp voice answered \\"It is, we’re all one Victor, we’re all one aren’t we. I mean ‘what’s going on?’.\\" Spinetti said the play \\"is about the growing up of any of us; the things that helped us to be more aware.\\"YouTube video of interview with ReleaseTranscript of BBC2 Release interview with Lennon and Spinetti Actor/director Jonathan Glew produced a three-handed adaptation of the book that premiered as a pay-what-you-want show at the 2015 Edinburgh Festival Fringe.

Maria Delaney was a beautiful, successful actress, the wife of Sir Charles Wyndham. Niall Delaney wrote the songs and melodies that everyone sang and played. Celia their sister, generous and charming, took care of their father and delighted in Maria's children. Between Maria and Niall there existed a strange affinity—sometimes physical, sometimes spiritual. They were both subtly aware of it, and so was Sir Charles.

Its unusual name (weil means \\"because\\" in German) is derived from the presence of a Roman villa in the area. Two smaller villages, Neuweiler and Breitenstein, are incorporated into Weil im Schönbuch. Portions of the Schönbuch Natural Park belong to Weil im Schönbuch; the forested park has many scenic paths, ponds, streams and protected areas for animals and rare plants. Geography Weil im Schönbuch is located 12 km south of Böblingen in a clearing of the Schönbuch forest on the northern edge of the Schönbuch Nature Park. Highway B464, which links Böblingen and Tübingen, runs through the western edge of the town. The oldest parts of the town are located on an east-west ridge. To the immediate north are two small brooks, the Seitenbach and the Totenbach, and to the south is a more substantial stream, the Schaich. The village has expanded along the northern slope of the ridge. The steep southern slopes remain largely undeveloped. Elevations in the town range from 432 to 487 meters. Towns surrounding Weil im Schönbuch are, starting from the north and moving clockwise, Schönaich, Waldenbuch, Dettenhausen, the Bebenhausen district of Tübingen, Altdorf, and Holzgerlingen. History Traces of human activity in the area have been dated to the Neolithic and Bronze Age. A Roman settlement was established in the first century C.E. and a villa rustica was excavated near the Totenbachmühle. More Roman artifacts were discovered during renovation of the St. Martin’s church in 1904. A 90-cm-high statue of Diana was found in the town. In the 4th century the Alamanni settled in the oldest part of the village, today's Maierhof. It is not certain whether the area was continuously inhabited after that. In 1087 was the first recorded mention of the area when a Rudolf of Breitenstein was listed as a vassal of the Counts Palatinate of Tübingen. In 1188 the town was mentioned for the first time as Weyl im Schaienbuch. In that year Count Rudolf I of Tübingen gave his share of the village to the Bebenhausen Abbey, which had been founded one year previously. The Fronhof (Maierhof), together with the serfs belonging to it, remained with his brother. By the end of the 13th century, Weil im Schönbuch, Breitenstein, and Neuweiler (mentioned for the first time in 1295) were almost completely within the territory of the Bebenhausen abbey. The night of May 11, 1525, the Swabian League army, under its leader George, Truchsess of Waldburg, camped in the Seitenbach and Totenbach dales. The next day it advanced on Böblingen, massacring thousands of peasants in the Battle of Böblingen, one of the bloodiest conflicts of the German Peasants' War. During the Reformation, the Bebenhausen abbey was dissolved in 1535 and Weil im Schönbuch acquired by Ulrich, Duke of Württemberg. In 1559 the whole town, including the church and city hall, was destroyed by arson. The only building that survived the disaster was the parsonage, somewhat removed from the rest of the town. The arsonist, Enderlin Seitz, was captured and condemned to death. As punishment, Seitz was forced into a barrel into which long nails had been started, and the barrel rolled down a hill. The nails were naturally driven into the barrel and killed the arsonist. In the Thirty Years War, Imperial-Catholic troops pillaged the town after the battle of Nördlingen on September 8, 1634 and, in 1635, a further disaster occurred with an outbreak of the plague. Nearly a third of the population of village lost their lives in this war. By 1850 Weil im Schönbuch contained 2453 Protestant and 21 Catholic inhabitants, who lived and worked in 287 main and 165 auxiliary buildings.Beschreibung des Oberamts Böblingen – Tabelle I. At that time, Weil was the third-largest town (after Sindelfingen and Böblingen) in the Böblingen Oberamt (not identical with today’s Landkreis Böblingen). In the last days of the Second World War, Weil im Schönbuch was the scene of heavy fighting between German and French troops on April 21 and 22, 1945. Some of the local population were killed and 58 buildings were destroyed. As a result of municipal reform in Baden- Württemberg, the villages of Neuweiler (July 1, 1971) and Breitenstein (April 1, 1972) were merged into Weil im Schönbuch. Population The numbers of inhabitants come from census results (marked in red) or the official estimates of the bureau of statistics (main domiciles only). All data since 1871 were reported by the Baden-Wuerttemberg bureau of statistics [5]; data from 1850 to 1871 are from the Oberamt Böblingen [4]. Politics =Community structure= Weil im Schönbuch consists of the three districts: Breitenstein; Neuweiler; and Weil im Schönbuch. The districts were merged in the early 70's. Breitenstein and Neuweiler are considered Ortschaften (localities) under the Baden-Württemberg municipal code with their own village councils and mayors.Hauptsatzung der Gemeinde Weil im Schönbuch vom 30. September 2003 The Breitenstein district contains only the village of Breitenstein. The Neuweiler district contains the village of Neuweiler and the Eschmühle farm.

K1049 connects to the villages of Neuweiler and Breitenstein and K 1058 connects the suburb of Roter Berg with Weil im Schönbuch and B464. In December 1996 the Schönbuchbahn (Böblingen-Dettenhausen) was put back into operation. Three stops in Weil im Schönbuch connect the town through Böblingen to the Stuttgart regional rail network. =Local industries= * Hecker Werke GmbH & Co.

He began studying art at the Oakland Community College and pursued printmaking in stone lithography at the Kalamazoo Institute of Arts. Rounding out his formal education was his stay at the Dynamic Graphics Education Foundation in Peoria, Illinois, where he studied computer generated art. Considered a leader in the new school of rock 'n' roll posters, Mark Arminski has painted the landscape of Detroit and beyond with his signature pieces of concert art. His first commissioned poster work was in the form of silk screens for Iggy Pop and the Smashing Pumpkins. Arminski is notable for bridging the gap between the psychedelic art of the 1960s and the grunge aesthetic of the early 1990s, and he has emerged as a genuine equal among his own mentors. While much of his work was originally found in and around Michigan, he has designed concert posters for events in New York, Los Angeles, and San Francisco, and he is regularly commissioned to design CD cover art. Arminski continues to have great influence among poster artists and his rich eye-popping designs have expanded beyond print media to body art and murals. Arminski is the official artist of the Mackinac Island Music Festival, making a new work each season to showcase local, regional and national musicians with deep ties to Michigan. Rob Maniscalco, portrait artist and producer of Detroit Public TV show Art Beat, who has interviewed Mark Arminski on his show, wrote the following words of introduction: Named \\"Artist of the Year\\" by Visions magazine, Arminski is not limited to poster art and CD covers; he is a master muralist, fine artist and body painter. Arminski is also featured in the book Art of Modern Rock: The Poster Explosion, the first and last word on the finest rock concert posters of the past fifteen years, a period of unprecedented explosion in poster-making activity for both the biggest names in rock as well as the most highly regarded new rock acts. This comprehensive work includes posters from rock's greatest bands and the most exciting new bands. He was sued by the bands Phish and the Dave Matthews Band over claims that he sold copies of posters produced for the two bands. The lawsuits were reported in several newspapers. “I’m one of those individuals who tends to view everything with artistic merit.” —Arminski References  Movement 2009 Limited Edition Prints Available Now!! * Mark Arminiski featured on Art Beat * San Francisco Chronicle (January 23, 1998): David vs. Goliath, The Rock Version - Modest poster artist sued by giant pop acts * Metro Times, January 7, 1998: Ill-suited art - Artists fear that a court case could be the end of the rock poster as we know it. * Mark Arminski displays his rock poster oeuvre online: Mark Arminski Collection * River's Edge Gallery: Mark Arminski Category:American poster artists Category:Artists from Michigan Category:1950 births Category:Living people ","title":"Mark Arminski"},{"id":"6692395","text":"is an action video game released in 2004 by Konami.

Grown on its own rootstock and self-pollinating, the Evans Cherry displays white blossoms in spring and bears abundant fruit. Evans once thought the cherry originated in Minnesota, but according to more recent reports, he believes it may have come from Alaska where Evans Cherry trees were given out to settlers. Characteristics The Evans Cherry cultivar grows from – other sour cherries are taller – with abundant white blossoms in spring, bright red fruit at an average weight of 0.15 ounces (4.4 grams), and juice that is pink-tinted to clear. The tree can be grown on its own root stock so there are no grafting problems; an advantage, since with grafting there can be incompatibility between the top or shoot and the grafted root stock, or a poor graft union can cause a trunk to split later on as the tree grows larger. Best trained as a tree rather than bush to make harvest of fruit easiest, the Evans Cherry is a self-fruitful, zone 3a cherry with a ripening season in North America in August. History Ieuan Evans, who is a horticulturist, and was a specialist in plant disease and a research scientist for Alberta Agriculture, discovered a gardener, identified as \\"Mrs Bower,\\" who lived northeast of Edmonton near Fort Saskatchewan. She had been growing cherry trees which bore abundant fruit that dated to 1923. The orchard was being destroyed to make room to build a Federal jail, so Boward invited Evans to take some of the orchard's trees both for the Alberta Tree Nursery and for his personal use. Evans discovered suckers from the cherry trees were easy to propagate and to grow so he distributed them to a wide circle of acquaintances and friends. Response from those growing the vigorous tree with its excellent fruit was very positive. However at that time, nurseries refused to sell the now-named Evans Cherry tree believing, despite the evidence, that cherries would not grow on the Canadian prairies. Eventually, nurseries like the DNA Gardens near Red Deer, Alberta began propagation and selling the trees. Later, a Winnipeg Manitoba nursery began selling thousands of the trees, and at present they sell out every year. The tree, now in the public domain, has been sold as cuttings as well as having been tissue cultured in parts of Canada and the United States.

The plot involves telepathy, speaking to animals, and, in the last few pages, an invasion by extraterrestrials. The nominal adversaries in the novel are known as \\"cow-dyes\\", a corruption of Caodai, a religion of Vietnamese origin. On the American side, telepaths, who are used in espionage and other covert activities, are falling victim to \\"the glotch\\", a fatal affliction which is believed to be a Caodai bio-weapon, transmitted telepathically. Reception Galaxy reviewer Floyd C. Gale praised the novel as \\"an authentically convincing picture of a wartime navy and . . . a think- tank tickler.\\"\\"Galaxy's 5 Star Shelf\\", Galaxy Science Fiction, October 1957, p.123 Anthony Boucher reported Slave Ship to be \\"at once fascinating and disappointing.\\" Boucher praised Pohl for his \\"Heinleinesque skill in the detailed indirect exposition of a convincing future,\\" but faulted the novel as episodic, weakly characterized, and arbitrarily resolved.\\"Recommended Reading,\\" F&SF;, May 1957, pp.74-75.

He was one of the young Chicagoans who fell in love with jazz as a result of hearing King Oliver's band (with Louis Armstrong on second cornet) at Lincoln Gardens in the early 1920s. Oliver's drummer, Baby Dodds, made a particular and lasting impression on Wettling. Ernie Caceres, Bobby Hackett, Freddie Ohms, and George Wettling, Nick's, NYC, 1940s. Photography by William P. Gottlieb Wettling went on to work with the big bands of Artie Shaw, Bunny Berigan, Red Norvo, Paul Whiteman, and Harpo Marx, but he was at his best with bands led by Eddie Condon, Muggsy Spanier, and himself. In these small bands, Wettling demonstrated the arts of dynamics and responding to a particular soloist that he had learned from Baby Dodds. Wettling was a member of some of Condon's bands, which included Wild Bill Davison, Billy Butterfield, Edmond Hall, Peanuts Hucko, Pee Wee Russell, Cutty Cutshall, Gene Schroeder, Ralph Sutton, and Walter Page. In 1957 he toured England with a Condon band that included Davison, Cutshall, and Schroeder. Towar the end of his life, Wettling, like his friend clarinetist Pee Wee Russell, took up painting and was influenced by the American cubist Stuart Davis. He has been said to have believed that \\"jazz drumming and abstract painting seemed different for him only from the point of view of craftsmanship: in both fields he felt rhythm to be decisive\\".

On 9 August 1914, U-15 became the first U-boat loss to an enemy warship after it was rammed by British light cruiser . Constructed by Kaiserliche Werft Danzig, U-15 was ordered on 23 February 1909 and was commissioned three years later on 7 July 1912. The boat left port for its first patrol on 1 August 1914, but on 9 August, U-15 was forced to lie stopped on the surface off the coast of Fair Isle, in Shetland, Scotland, after its engines had failed. While stranded on the surface, the British warship spotted the boat through a thick fog and could hear hammering from inside the boat as the crew tried to repair the damaged engines. The Birminghams Captain Arthur Duff ordered his crew to fire on the U-boat, but missed. As U-15 attempted to dive to avoid the attack, Duff ordered for his ship to ram the submarine at full speed, cutting it in half and killing all 23 members of its crew.

It follows the protagonist Lucy and her immediate contacts. The book was shortlisted for the Booker and Whitbread Prizes in 2002. Plot summary It begins with Lucy, on a night in 1921. She is the only child of an Anglo-Irish land owner on the coast of County Cork. It starts during the Irish War of Independence, when Loyalist Protestant landowners caught in the battle between the IRA and the British army had their houses burned. The place is under martial law and Captain Gault is disturbed by young arsonists from the nearby village. When he fires a warning shot with his old rifle, he injures a boy in the shoulder. Out of fear, the family plans to move to England. Lucy is not told why her family wishes to move and longs for the house she was kept from and the sea close by. On the eve of their departure, she hides in the woods. Due to a series of events, her parents are led to believe that she drowned in the sea. By the time she is discovered, her parents are gone. She thus gets what she wished for, to live in the house, being taken care of by the house servants turned caretaker-farmers. Lucy lives a very lonely life, reading books and keeping bees. She feels very guilty about running away and thus feels that she deserves her loneliness. When another character, Ralph, tries to relieve her of her sad life, she feels that she cannot let him love her without, one of the characters opines, getting forgiveness from her parents. Her father returns after the Second World War, having spent the previous years in Italy and Switzerland, too late to salvage her happiness. They settle into an uneasy companionship, with too much unspoken. Having lost the love of her life, she forms a bond with the person who was wounded by her father. Lucy spends many years visiting the asylum where the person is incarcerated in his confusion and his silence. Lucy in old age sees people with phones to their ears and hears on the wireless about the Internet, and wonders what it is.
