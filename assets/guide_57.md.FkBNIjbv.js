Keene (born June 22, 1947, Jacksonville, Florida) is a James B. Duke Professor of Molecular Genetics and Microbiology at Duke University. Keene studies the regulation of RNA and the mechanisms of RNA-protein interactions. He identified RNA recognition motif (RRM) proteins, which are the largest family of RNA-binding proteins. He isolated the first human autoimmune antigen. He formalized the posttranscriptional operon and regulon (PTRO) model to describe global gene regulation, and proposed the RNA regulon hypothesis to better understand post-transcriptional regulation of mRNAs encoding proteins. Keene introduced the RIP (ribonucleoprotein immunoprecipitation) protocol for isolating specific mRNPs, which has become a tool for the mapping of mRNA targets of specific RBPs. Early life and education Jack Donald Keene was born in Jacksonville, Florida on June 22, 1947. His father worked for the RAND Corporation. Keene attended Redlands High School in Redlands, California, graduating in 1965. Initially a student at University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), he transferred to the University of California, Riverside, where he majored in biology, working with Carlton Bovell. He received his A.B. degree in 1969. Next, Keene studied with Helen Riaboff Whiteley at the University of Washington in Seattle, Washington, graduating in 1975 with a doctorate in microbiology and Immunology. He did postdoctoral work in molecular virology with Robert A. Lazzarini in the Laboratory for Molecular Genetics at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland from 1974-1978. Career In 1979, Keene was recruited by Wolfgang Joklik to the Department of Microbiology and Immunology at Duke University Medical Center. At that time the department was ranked one of the top three in the United States by the National Research Council. Keene was the chairman of the Department of Microbiology from 1992-2002, and Director of Basic Sciences for the Duke Comprehensive Cancer Center from 1995-2003. As of 1997 he became the James B. Duke Professor of Molecular Genetics and Microbiology at Duke University. In 1999 Keene founded the Duke Center for RNA Biology. Research Keene studies the regulation of RNA and the mechanisms of RNA- protein interactions. In his work on molecular genetics, he and his coworkers have examined the role of DNA and RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) in the pathogenesis of autoimmunity. In the late 1970s and early 1980s he identified genomic sequences for vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and rabies virus (RABV), members of the Rhabdoviridae family of viruses, and for Ebola virus and Marburg virus from the broader group of negative-strand RNA viruses (NSRV). He identified the origins of defective interfering particles of negative-strand RNA viruses. Through combinatorial studies of viral and bacterial systems, he has identified targets for novel pharmacological studies. Later in the 1980s, Keene identified RNA recognition motif (RRM) proteins. RRM proteins are the largest family of RNA-binding proteins and the seventh largest protein family of the human genome. RRM is a prevalent RNA- binding fold involving proteins implicated in RNA biogenesis, processing, transport, and degradation. In 1987, Query and Keene first identified a B-cell epitope within the U1-70K protein. Keene isolated the first human autoimmune antigen and elucidated its autoimmune epitopes, the parts of an antigen to which antibodies in the immune system can bind. He cloned rheumatological autoimmune protein genes. He developed a diagnostic test for systemic lupus erythematosus using recombinant antigens. Keene's lab has identified functions of the ELAV/Hu posttranscriptional regulators HuB, HuC and HuD and their roles and that of HuR in processes of growth, proliferation, differentiation, and immune response. The study of RNA-binding proteins such as HuR and the determination of the binding of specific sequences have informed Keene's later post-transcription theory and his coordination theory of RNA operons. RNA- binding proteins appear to be implicated in the functioning of many posttranscriptional processes. As of 1994, Keene suggested that RNA-binding proteins could be involved in the regulation of messenger RNA that encode cytokines. In 2000, he was able to apply this approach to demonstrate neuronal differentiation. He also introduced the first use of the RIP (ribonucleoprotein immunoprecipitation) protocol, isolating specific mRNPs using immunoprecipitation, and identifying the mRNA component with microarray or deep sequencing. This method has become a tool for the mapping of mRNA targets of specific RBPs. In 2001-2002, Keene formalized the posttranscriptional operon and regulon (PTRO) model for global gene regulation. By 2007, Keene proposed the RNA regulon hypothesis, \\"that mRNAs encoded by functionally related genes may be coordinately regulated as posttranscriptional RNA regulons by specific mRNP processing machineries\\". The purpose of the RNA regulon model was to better understand post-transcriptional regulation, to answer the question \\"How does the cell coordinate metabolism and regulation of mRNAs encoding proteins in the same biological process so that the proteins can be coordinately produced?\\" Awards and honors * 1985, Pew Scholar in the Biomedical Sciences, The Pew Charitable Trusts. * 2009, Fellow, American Academy of Microbiology * 2009, James Buchanan Duke Distinguished Professorship, Duke University. * 2009, Member, American Academy of Microbiology  References  Category:1947 births Category:Living people Category:Chemists Category:American molecular biologists Category:Molecular genetics ","title":"Jack D.

Initially named the International Bureau of National Associations of Teachers in Public Secondary Schools, it became moribund during World War I, but was revived after the war and began growing. By 1932, it had 26 affiliates, with a total of 100,000 members. It became the \\"International Federation of Secondary Teachers\\" in 1935. In 1921, the federation launched the International Bulletin journal, for the discussion of education issues. After World War II, the federation also began campaigning on professional and social topics. It built closer contacts with the International Federation of Teachers' Associations (IFTA), which represented primary school teachers, while with the International Teachers' Federation and World Organisation of the Teaching Profession (WOTP), it formed the loose Comit√© d'Entente, to lobby international organisations on education issues. In 1952, FIPESO, the IFTA and the WOTP merged to form the World Confederation of Organizations of the Teaching Profession. FIPESO continued as an autonomous section of the new federation. Its membership initially grew, as secondary education expanded in many countries, but fell during the 1970s, rebounding in the 1980s as it attracted members in Africa, Latin America and Asia.

The species is native to Cuba where it was endemic but it has been introduced to Hawaii. Description The Cuban limia is olive-green in background colour and has a bluish-grey back, silvery flanks marked with black-edged scales and a white belly. There is a yellow patch close to the vent in fenmles. In the males have the dorsal fin and the anal fin are normally yellow-orange in colour marked with blue-black spots. The females have colorless fins which are marked with a few scattered, black freckles. The females grow to over twice the size of the males which can have a total length of , and females reach . In structure it is a rather robust species, depressed towards the rear with a rounded tail and it has a compressed head which has a small, oblique mouth with a protruding lower jaw and a protractile upper jaw. Distribution The Cuban limia is, as the common name suggests, native to Cuba. It occurs throughout the island of Cuba and the neighbouring Isla de la Juventud. It has been introduced to Hawaii, where it is found on the islands of Oahu and Hawaii, where it is found in the Kaloko-Honok≈çhau National Historical Park. Habitat and biology Within its native range the Cuban limia inhabits streams, lakes, estuaries, coastal lagoons, and mangrove swamps and can be found in both freshwater and brackish water, or saline water. Its diet consists of worms, crustaceans, insects and plant material. It often forms mixed shoals with species such as sailfin mollies and mosquitofish. A larger female may give birth to up to 50 fry at a time and in a 4-6 week period can produce up to 100 young. Human uses This species is present in the aquarium trade and a number of colour variations have been bred. It is thought that released aquarium fish are the origin of the population in Hawaii where they have been blamed for impacting the population of native damselflies. In Hawaii it has been given the local name tabai. Taxonomy The Cuban limia was described by the French zoologist Alphone Guichenot in 1853 as Poecilia vittata. A year leter the Cuban zoologist Felipe Poey described a fish he named Limia cubensis and designated this as the type species of the genus Limia. This was a synonym of Guichenot's Poecilia vittata and so L. vittata was considered the valid name.

He was one of the co-founders of the Communist Party of Germany (KPD). As the first party chairman of the KPD in Bavaria, he was in April 1919 one of the protagonists of the Bavarian Soviet Republic that emerged in the wake of the German November Revolution of 1918.  Life  = Early life = Despite his Jewish sounding patronymic, research has established that Levien was descended from Huguenot immigrants into Russia by the name of Lavigne.Red Rising in Bavaria, Ricahrd Grunberger, Arthur Baker Ltd, 1973, p.56 Max Levien was born into a German merchant family in Moscow in 1885. His studies began in 1893 at the Moscow German Gymnasium and continued in 1897 in Meissen, Germany, where he graduated in 1902. He discontinued his scientific studies at the University of Halle in the fall of 1905 to participate in the Russian revolution that year. Joining the Socialist Revolutionary Party (SR) in 1906, he was arrested by the Okhrana and sentenced to prison in Moscow in 1907. After his release in 1908, Levien went to Zurich where he continued his studies, and graduated with a doctorate in the summer of 1913. In Switzerland, he joined the Russian Social Democratic Party, had contacts with Lenin and became a follower of the Bolsheviks. After graduation, Levien went to Germany and became a German citizen. On 29 October 1913, he volunteered for the Royal Bavarian Infantry Lifeguards Regiment and served from 1914 to 1918 on most fronts in the First World War, fighting alternately in France, Italy, Serbia and Romania. = Revolution and Council republic = During the November revolution he was active in the soldiers¬¥ councils, working closely together with anarchist writer and activist Erich M√ºhsam. Levien became chairman of the Munich Soldiers¬¥ Council and the Munich Spartacus group. He participated as a delegate for Munich in the founding convention of the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) over the New Year 1918-19, and became party chairman for KPD in Bavaria. Levien was together with Eugen Levin√© one of the leaders of the second phase of the Soviet Republic after the suppression of the right-wing counter-coup on Palm Sunday 13 April 1919. Unlike Levin√©, Levien was not of Jewish descent, but was nevertheless defamed as Jewish by political opponents. Levien was arrested after the suppression of the Soviet Republic, but managed to flee to Vienna in May 1919. There he was arrested again. Karl Retzlaw, who personally knew and worked with him, wrote in his biography: \\"Max Levien was an interesting figure. About 35 years old, medium-sized, full dark hair - \\"artist's mane\\" - doctor of science and a great, quick-witted speaker.‚Äú The Austrian government released Levien by the end of 1920. Before that, long negotiations had taken place after the Bavarian judiciary had placed a request for his extradition. = Soviet exile = Levien settled in Moscow in June 1921, there he first worked in the hunger relief for Soviet Russia. Elected in 1922 into the Executive Committee of the Comintern (ECCI), he worked in his apparatus and participated in 1924 at the 5th World Congress of the Communist International. Levien was also working as editor of the Comintern journal Under the Banner of Marxism and lectured at the Communist University of the National Minorities of the West. In 1925 he became member of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. During this time Levien was closely associated with the disgraced former KPD leader Arkadi Maslow. In the 1930s he last had a professorship for History and Philosophy of natural sciences at the Moscow University.  Death  Eventually Levien fell victim to the Great Terror. He was arrested by the NKVD on 10 December 1936 and was in March 1937 initially sentenced to five years camp imprisonment. But on 16 June the verdict was converted into a death sentence, which was executed he following day. Max Levien is classified by the Russian historian Alexander Vatlin as a victim of the German operation of the NKVD, even if he was sentenced and executed before Nikolai Yezhov signed the order of its initiation.

The treatise was published in Isfahan in July 1909. This treatise was written in the years between the first and the second Persian Constitutional Revolution. In this treatise, the author presents an Islamic version of the constitutional political system. The treatise Moqim va Mosafer, which was written in constitutional history, took a prominent place in its political treatises and explored the concept of constitutional jurisprudence with the idea of a \\"powerful government\\". The treatise Moqim va Mosafer proved by the powerful principle that injustice of the constitutional state are less than monarchy and almost controllable; yet it believes that if the constitution leads to mass despotism, there will be a great deal of tyranny that cannot be easily reformed. On the first page of the book, in the four corners of the page, are the words justice, dignity, equality and freedom. The subject The content of this book is about the intellectual defense of some kind of religious reading of the constitution and the author has sought to answer the questions of the parliamentary and constitutional system. This book is a theoretical design in form of a discussion. During the book, an informed constitutionalist discuss with an informed theocrat and finally the constitutionalist responds to the theocrat's criticism then he decides to testify on the constitutional necessity. This book is considered as the headline of religious democracy. In this treatise, Nourollah Najafi Esfahani seeks to answer the questions of the constitutional opponents who were either against authoritarianism or from a religious point of view, opposed to the constitution, or opposed the constitutional movements seeking extremism. At the same time as writing this book, Muhammad Hossein Naini wrote his most famous religious work, the treatise Tanbihal Omma va Tanzihal Mellah in defense of the constitution. The writing style The style of the book, which is based on dialogue, is a question-and-answer format that is new in its kind and tells the delicate taste of the author who is a aware Mujtahid of the time. In this dissertation, Haj Aqa Nourollah as the \\"traveler\\" (Mosafer) who represents a religious constitutionalist, with \\"Haji Moghim\\" (the Resident) representing religious figures who were pessimistic about the constitutionalism of some constitutionalists, with the presence of an observer named \\"Mirza Hedayatollah\\", he sat in an imaginary conversation about the government and the constitutional system. At the end of this thesis we read: \\"The first volume of the book is finished with felicity and blessing.\\" This phrase indicates that other volumes were either written or intended to be written, but no other volumes have been found so far. The main source of Hajj Aga Nourollah's political thought is the Moqim va Mosafer treatise. The Moqim va Mosafer treatise is the most documented text that can illustrate the political thought of the Isfahan seminary in the constitutional era. This treatise is similar to the philosophical-jurisprudential treatise of Tanbihal Omma va Tanzihal Mellah, which was also written in explaining the Islamic constitution and the state from the Islamic point of view in years between the first and the second Persian Constitutional Revolution. In this book, Hajj Aga Nourollah acted like Muhammad Hossein Naini in writing the Tanbihal Omma va Tanzihal Mellah treatise, but in simple terms, presents an Islamic version of the constitutional political system. Documentation principle Among the points that the author has used in this dissertation is the principle of documenting and citing numerous evidences in various disciplines, so these increased text richness that informs the reader unlike the constitutional claims, the author is familiar with the issues of this affairs; for example, in expressing the constitutional emphasis from Marja's of Hawza Najaf, he mentions each of their ruling about it or in trying to express the difference between constitutionalists and tyrants in each case, he cite an example of the tyranny of the Iranian society. Moving from superstructure to analysis of fundamentals and assumptions The author does not restrict the scope of his arguments and content to supersensitive topics; rather, he extends them to infrastructural analysis and theoretical presuppositions. In the text of the book, the chatacter \\"Moqim\\" goes beyond criticism of \\"political thought\\" to analysis of \\"political philosophy\\" when some peoples denounces the constitutionalism on the grounds that \\"constitutionalism is something new and unprecedented in Islam\\". From this approach the chatacter \\"Moqim\\" shows, constitutionalism was not only invented by Europeans but rooted in Islam and religious principles; For this reason: \\"The constitution is the same as Islam and Islam is the constitution, and constitutionalism is Islamism.\\" Accordingly, the theoretical presuppositions of the topics have also been critically and elaborated in this thesis.

She is known for her 1931 book The Art of the Body: Rhythmic Exercise for Health and Beauty, one of the first to combine yoga and nudism. Early life Marguerite, born 21 January 1891, was one of the six children of George Agniel, an Indiana farmer, and Ada Lescher Flowers. Her father died in 1893 while she was an infant, leaving her mother to raise all the children. The Agniel family was French Jewish; her mother's family was English. She was married in New York on 21 March 1917.Married 21/03/1917 Manhattan New York, certificate no. 9261. Index to New York City Marriages, 1866-1937. She performed in Broadway plays including The Amber Empress with music by Zoel Parenteau in 1916, and Raymond Hitchcock's Pin Wheel in 1922. Author She appeared in the 15 November 1926 issue of Vogue, demonstrating slimming exercises in the form of floor stretches, with postures close to the yoga asanas Salabhasana, Supta Virasana, Sarvangasana and Halasana. She wrote for Physical Culture magazine in 1927 and 1928. In 1931 Agniel wrote the book The Art of the Body : Rhythmic Exercise for Health and Beauty, illustrated mainly with photographs of herself; she notes in the Preface that her dance technique derives from Ruth St. Denis (who in turn followed Fran√ßois Delsarte), but that her \\"system of 'aesthetic athletics'\\" was based mainly on that of Bernarr Macfadden, an advocate of physical culture. She names the sexologist Havelock Ellis and the musicologist Sigmund Spaeth as major influences, stating that both had shown \\"an extraordinarily intuitive understanding\\" of her work. Agniel wrote a piece called \\"The Mental Element in Our Physical Well-Being\\" for The Nudist, an American magazine, in 1938; it showed nude women practising yoga, accompanied by a text on attention to the breath. The social historian Sarah Schrank comments that it made perfect sense at this stage of the development of yoga in America to combine nudism and yoga, as \\"both were exercises in healthful living; both were countercultural and bohemian; both highlighted the body; and both were sensual without being explicitly erotic.\\" File:Marguerite Agniel in a Buddha position with her legs crossed Wellcome V0048585.jpgIn \\"Buddha position\\", Muktasana.

She has a wonderful art of posing, & they are largely nudes, though she is no longer young.\\" Agniel is depicted in an \\"elegant, though sharply ironic\\" Palladium photographic print by Margaret Watkins, \\"Head and Hand\\".

Devon Smither describes Agniel as \\"a leading health and beauty guru\\", and the Art of the Body as \\"a moralizing exercise manual\\" providing a mixture of exercises, advice on cosmetics, and spiritual guidance. Mary O'Connor and Katherine Tweedie comment on Watkins's portraits of Agniel that they were circulated sometimes as artistic \\"nudes\\", sometimes as portraits, and sometimes as instances of \\"a regime of exercise and body modification\\". They write that since Agniel chose to use these photographs of herself, she is presenting them \\"not as the passive victim of an objectifying male gaze .. but as the means of promulgating her own vision of the world and her own expertise.

An example of a turned part with and without an undercut On turned parts an undercut is also known as a neck or \\"relief groove\\". They are often used at the end of the threaded portion of a shaft or screw to provide clearance for the cutting tool, and also referred to as thread relief in this context. A rule of thumb is that the undercut should be at least 1.5 threads long and the diameter should be at least smaller than the minor diameter of the thread. Strictly speaking the relief simply needs to be equal or slightly smaller than the minor diameter of the thread. Thread relief can also be internal on a bore, and then the relief needs to be larger than the major thread diameter. They are also often used on shafts that have diameter changes so that a mating part can seat against the shoulder. If an undercut is not provided there is always a small radius left behind even if a sharp corner is intended. These types of undercuts are called out on technical drawings by saying the width and either the depth or the diameter of the bottom of the neck.. References =Bibliography= *.

Harris was the National President of the Association for Women in Communications and she chaired the Defense Advisory Committee on Women in Service. Early life and education Harris was born in Detroit in 1909 as an only child. Career After graduating from Grinnell College, Harris earned an advertising position with the Himelhoch Brothers in Detroit. She eventually left the Himelhoch Brothers for a radio position at WWJ where she discussed household items. Due to cutbacks during WW2, Harris approached Harry Bannister on December 27, 1942, to ask to join the newsroom to replace the deported men. She sent an audition tape of several news stories and an interview with an available station engineer. On January 4, 1943, Harris became the first woman to broadcast news in Michigan on WWJ radio in Detroit. By 1946, she was the first woman on WWJ-TV and had the first woman-run television show in Michigan. Two years later, she received the Peabody Award for her expose on sex offenders. However, after the war ended, Harris was back in daytime programming, a show that aired at one o'clock and contained news, features, and interviews, under the title of \\"Women's Editor\\". In 1952, she received the Headliner Award from the Association for Women in Communications. During the 1960s, she was appointed to sit on the Status of Women Commission by Governor Swainson, and was subsequently reappointed by the two following governors until 1976. In 1964, Harris moved into an upper management position with WWJ until her eventual retirement. In 1968, Harris was appointed to the Ferris State College Control Board.

She showed top-class form as a juvenile in 2019 when she won three of her seven races including the Silver Flash Stakes and the Moyglare Stud Stakes as well as running third in the Fillies' Mile. On her first appearance as a three-year- old she won the 1000 Guineas, following up with a facile victory in the Oaks Stakes and a similar win in the Yorkshire Oaks. Background Love is a chestnut filly with a broad white blaze and a white sock on her right foreleg bred in Ireland by the Coolmore Stud. She is owned by the Coolmore partners Michael Tabor, Susan Magnier and Derrick Smith. Like many Coolmore horses she was sent into training with Aidan O'Brien at Ballydoyle. She was sired by Galileo, who won the Derby, Irish Derby and King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes in 2001. Galileo became one of the world's leading stallions, earning his tenth champion sire of Great Britain and Ireland title in 2018. His other progeny include Frankel, Nathaniel, New Approach, Rip Van Winkle, Found Minding and Ruler of the World. Love's dam Pikaboo showed no racing ability, failing to win or place in five starts, but did better as a broodmare, producing several other winners including Lucky Kristale (Lowther Stakes), Peach Tree (Stanerra Stakes) and Flattering (Munster Oaks). Her grand-dam Gold Runner was a half-sister to Don't Forget Me. Racing career =2019: two- year-old season= Love was ridden her first three races by her trainer's son Donnacha O'Brien. The filly made her debut in a maiden race over seven furlongs at Leopardstown Racecourse on 6 June in which she started the 11/4 favourite but came home fourth of the seven runners, just over three lengths behind the winner Cayenne Pepper. Three weeks later she started favourite for a similar event at the Curragh and disputed the lead from the start before going down by a neck to the Jessica Harrington-trained Windracer. On 11 July Love started 5/6 favourite for a maiden at Leopardstown and recorded her first success as she led from the start and held off a challenge from Soul Search to win by a head. Seamie Heffernan took over the ride when Love was stepped up in class for the Group 3 Silver Flash Stakes at Leopardstown two weeks later. She started at odds of 8/1 in an eight-runner field which also included her stablemates Precious Moments (the 2/1 favourite) and So Wonderful as well as Windracer. Love immediately went to the front and was never seriously challenged, pulling away from her opponents in the last furlong to win \\"easily\\" by three and a quarter lengths from Unforgetable [sic]. After the race Aidan O'Brien described the winner as \\"a lovely filly\\" who was \\"coming forward with every run\\". In her last three races of 2019 Love was parnered by Ryan Moore. On 23 August at the Curragh she was made the 6/4 favourite for the Group 2 Debutante Stakes but after taking the lead two furlongs out she was overtaken in the closing stages and faded to come home fifth of the nine runners behind Alpine Star, Petite Mustique, Soul Search and So Wonderful. The Group 1 Moyglare Stud Stakes at the Curragh on 15 September attracted a field of nine two-year-old fillies and saw Love go off the 6/1 third choice in the betting behind the British-trained Daahyeh (winner of the Albany Stakes) and Albigna. Soul Search, Precious Moments and So Wonderful were again in opposition as well as Tango (another Aidan O'Brien entry), Under The Stars (Princess Margaret Stakes) and Assurance. Moore settled the filly just behind the leaders as Tango set the pace before giving way to Soul Search two furlongs from the finish. Love overtook Soul Search just inside the final furlong and stayed on well to win by three quarters of a length from Daahyeh. Aidan O'Brien commented \\"She is a queen. She's genuine, has a beautiful pedigree, and stays very well. She has a beautiful action and when Ryan asked her to get down and lengthen she stuck her head out. She's been working lovely and progressing with every run\\". On 11 October Love was sent to England and stepped up in distance for the Fillies' Mile at Newmarket Racecourse and started the 4/1 third favourite in a nine-runner field. She took the lead four furlongs from the finish but was not able to break away from her rivals and was outpaced in the closing stages, finishing third behind Quadrilateral and Powerful Breeze. =2020: three-year-old season= The flat racing season in England was disrupted by the COVID-19 Pandemic and the 1000 Guineas was run a month later than usual on 7 June over the Rowley mile at Newmarket. Quadrilateral headed the betting with Love (ridden by Moore) starting the 4/1 joint second favourite alongside Millisle while the other twelve runners included Raffle Prize (Queen Mary Stakes), Cloak of Spirits, Boomer (Prestige Stakes), Under The Stars and Summer Romance (Empress Stakes). In rainy conditions the fillies raced on the far side of the wide, straight course with Cloak of Sprits setting the pace and Love settling in mid division to the left of the leaders towards the centre of the track. Love made steady progress approaching the last quarter mile, went to the front a furlong out and drew right away in the closing stages to win by four and a quarter lengths from Cloak of Spirits with Quadrilateral a head away in third place. After the race Moore commented \\"She's a very uncomplicated filly and we've always thought a lot of her... she was in control of the race from a long way out... At the moment she looks the best three-year-old filly around. I don't know what the plan is but I'd say the Oaks is an option for her\\". The 242nd running of the Oaks was run behind closed doors, over one and a half miles at Epsom Racecourse on 4 July and Love, with Moore in the saddle, went off the 11/10 favourite with the best of her seven opponents appearing to be Frankly Darling and Ennistymon who had finished first and second in the Ribblesdale Stakes at Royal Ascot. Love settled towards the rear as the two pacemakers, Tiempo Vuela and Passion set off in front and opened up a huge lead on the rest of the field. Love began to make rapid progress in the straight, picked off the pacemakers approaching the final quarter mile and drew away to win in \\"impressive\\" fashion by nine lengths. Her winning time of 2:34.06 was a new record for the race and 0.37 seconds faster than the time recorded by Serpentine when winning the Epsom Derby over the same course and distance an hour later. Aidan O'Brien said \\"Before the Guineas we thought the mile might be a little bit short, we always felt she‚Äôd get a mile and a quarter well and she's very genuine and tries hard, so we were always hoping the extra distance was going to improve her... her last few canters during the week were incredible, really. Obviously you never know what is going to happen, but we felt she was very well\\" while Moore commented \\"She was exceptional today. We‚Äôve always thought she's very good and she proved that in the Guineas, but today she's taken a step forward. Almost her best furlong was her last furlong. She's got a great temperament and I don‚Äôt think she could have been any more impressive, really... she‚Äôll be a threat to anything\\". On 20 August, Love won the Darley Yorkshire Oaks by 5 lengths ridden by jockey Ryan Moore despite some concern by her trainer over rain on the course the previous day. Second was Alpinista. Moore said Love had been exceptional this year ‚Äì \\"she's just got stronger and stronger and has done it very easily today\\". Her next start will be the Breeders' Cup Turf.

Two weeks later the SFMTA's Board of Directors approved a permit system and pilot program for shared motorized scooters. This pilot program would last for 12 months and may grant up to five permits.

Some of the many companies that trialed their scooters in San Francisco were Bird and Lime. They argue that these scooters are good for the cities because they do not create emissions, they are convenient, and easy to use, allowing a commuter to ride a scooter the last half mile to work after taking the train or bus rather than walking. On April 16, 2018, a day before the ordinance passed that required these companies to have a permit, a city attorney for San Francisco issued a cease- and-desist letter to Bird, Lime, and Spin for operating their shared electric scooter programs in San Francisco.

If the subject is closer than 2 cm, the phone will use both cameras. The CC9 Pro can record 4K video at 30fps, 1080p video at 30, 60, 120 or 240fps or ultra slow-motion 720p video at 960fps. Four LEDs are located to the right of the camera module for the flash, two of which are placed behind a diffuser. A 32 MP f/2.0 sensor is also used for the front camera, which can record 1080p video at 30fps. =Software= The Mi CC9 Pro runs on MIUI 12, which is based on Android 10. Reception Reviewing the global Mi Note 10, GSMArena gave it a 4.2/5, but had mixed feelings about the camera and chipset, noting that for the phone's pricepoint a flagship processor would have made it more compelling. The camera was described as producing excellent daylight photos, yet lowlight photos were merely average and video recording was unimpressive. Overall, they concluded that while the device is not the best smartphone on the market, it is \\"certainly a great package worth recommending\\". It received a camera score of 121 from DXOMARK, tying it with the Huawei Mate 30 Pro as the top-ranked phone on the site at the time, and also received a video score of 102, the highest score for videos.

The cloth, embroidered in an elaborate floral design and made of cloth of silver, is an important relic of Tudor fashion and luxury trade, containing dyes from as far away as India and Mexico. It was rediscovered in 2015 at St Faith's Church in Bacton, Herefordshire, where it had been used as an altar cloth for centuries. After several years of conservation and restoration, the garment was exhibited to the public in 2019 and 2020 along with the Rainbow Portrait, in which the queen is depicted wearing a highly similar dress. Description A closer look at the intricate embroidery of the dress-turned-altar cloth The garment is made of cream-coloured silk and Italian cloth of silver. Cloth of silver was, under Sumptuary Law, reserved for members of the royal family, which was an early clue of its origin. It was elaborately embroidered with colourful flowers and vegetation in silk, silver and gold thread, including caterpillars and deer. Unusually, the embroidery was stitched straight onto the fabric, indicating expert workmanship and therefore an elite owner. Dye used in the embroidery thread included cochineal red from Mexico, evidence of early trade from North America, as well Indian indigo blue traded through Portugal. History of the dress Bacton Altar Cloth on display in 2007 in St Faith's Church, Bacton Elizabeth I wore a highly similar dress in her Rainbow Portrait The dress dates to late in Queen Elizabeth I's life, when she was nearly 70. It is highly similar to the embroidered dress she is depicted wearing in her Rainbow Portrait. The style of the floral embroidery puts the dress squarely into the 1590s, as anything from later years would have featured more scroll-like detail on the stems and vines, in line with early Stuart trends; additionally, only inventories from the later part of Elizabeth's reign show such expensive dresses were in her possession. It was believed the garment was given to Bacton by the Queen in memory of Blanche Parry. Parry, from Bacton, was a personal attendant of the Queen, and held the offices of Chief Gentlewoman of the Queen's Most Honourable Privy Chamber and Keeper of Her Majesty's Jewels. Parry, who never married, remained devoted to Elizabeth and was her longest-serving courtier, by her side for 56 years. The Altar Cloth had survived the centuries as it was considered a sacred object by the parishioners at St Faith's Church in Bacton, where in 1909, it was framed in oak and mounted on the wall above the pews. Nearby is the Blanche Parry Monument, the earliest depiction of the Queen as Gloriana. For 106 years the framed cloth remained on the north wall, away from direct sunlight, which helped preserve the garment from fading. Return to prominence In the early 20th century, Sir Lionel Cust, then Surveyor of the King's Pictures, recognised the importance of the cloth and published an article in 1918 about its similarity to the costume of Elizabeth I depicted in her portraits.Lionel Henry Cust, 'Queen Elizabeth's Kirtle', The Burlington Magazine, 33:189 (December 1918), pp. 196‚Äì201. In 2015, the garment was researched by Ruth Elizabeth Richardson while writing a biography of Blanche Parry and Lady Troy. Richardson recognised the rarity and importance of the cloth. Subsequently, Eleri Lynn, a curator at the Historic Royal Palaces who was researching a book on Tudor fashion, saw Richardson's photos of the cloth online. Lynn examined the cloth and discovered it was of extraordinarily high quality, while also observing evidence of pattern cutting that ultimately revealed it had been a dress. Lynn recognised that it is a unique survival, being the only known cloth with direct embroidery from any museum or collection worldwide. This led to the cloth being restored and eventually displayed to the public at Hampton Court Palace.

The line operates every 15‚Äì45 minutes during weekdays and 60 minutes during weekends. Trips are roughly 30‚Äì40 minutes long. There are a few early morning/late night and rush hour trips that only operate between the Suitland Metro Station & Penn Mar Shopping Center. Background Route K12 operates between Branch Avenue and Suitland Stations via Penn Marr Shopping Center. Some trips are shortened to operate between Penn Marr and Suitland. Route K12 operates out of Andrews Federal Center garage since 2019. Prior to moving to Andrews, K12 operated from Southern Avenue until 1989 when it was moved to Landover division.. History =Initial Background= K12 & K19 were initially created as new bus routes in 1963, to operate between Federal Triangle in Downtown Washington D.C. & Andrews Air Force Base Gates in Camp Springs, MD, via 11th Street NW, E Street NW, 10th Street NW, Pennsylvania Avenue NW, 7th Street SW, Independence Avenue SW/SE, Pennsylvania Avenue SE, Pennsylvania Avenue, Shadyside Avenue, Suitland Road, Silver Hill Road, Pennsylvania Avenue, Parkland Drive, Surrey Service Drive, the Park Berkshire Apartment Complex, Hil Mar Drive, Walters Lane, Forestville Road, and Allentown Road. Both routes eventually became WMATA Metrobus Routes on February 4, 1973 when WMATA acquired all four private bus companies that were operating throughout the Washington D.C. Metropolitan Area and merged them all together to form its own, \\"Metrobus\\" System. Both routes were rerouted to serve Potomac Avenue & Eastern Market stations in the middle of their routes on July 15, 1977. =1978 Service Changes= On September 25, 1978, both routes K12 & K19 were truncated to Potomac Avenue station only eliminating service to Downtown DC. =2001 Service Changes= On January 13, 2001 when the Green Line was extended to Branch Avenue and both the Suitland and Branch Avenue stations opened, route K19 was eliminated K12 was truncated even further, to only operate between Suitland and Branch Avenue stations, via Andrews Air Force Base. A new route K11 replaced the segment of the former route K12 & K19's routing between Potomac Avenue Metro Station and the intersection of Suitland Road & Silver Hill Road operating parallel to route K12. Unlike route K12, route K11 would not serve Suitland station and operated during times the Green Line is not operating. Another new route, the K13 was also introduced to operate on select rush hour trips between Suitland Metro Station & Penn Mar Shopping Center. =2004 Service Changes= Due to the planned closure by the management of the Park Berkshire Apartments roadway that connects with Hil Mar Drive on June 27, 2004, routes K11, K12 & K13 were rerouted to operate to Suitland station, via their regular routing between the intersection of Walters Lane & Pennsylvania Avenue and intersection Hil Mar Drive & Park Berkshire roadway. All K11 & K12 trips to the Branch Avenue station as well as the K13 routes were also rerouted to follow the exact same routing, except in the exact opposite direction. =2016 Service Changes= On June 26, 2016, route K11 was discontinued and replaced by K12. This and the J11 were the last one morning trips that operate prior to Metro opening heading to Potomac Avenue station. =2018 Service Changes= On June 24, 2018, route K13 was discontinued and replaced by Route K12. Route K13 shortened trips between Suitland Metro Station & Penn Mar Shopping Center, were replaced by rush hour K12 trips as of a result. Route K12 was also rerouted to operate via Donnell Drive, Marlboro Pike, and Forestville Road between Pennsylvania Avenue & Donnell Drive and Pennsylvania Avenue & Forestville Road but no longer stop on Command Drive at Allentown Road (Joint Base Andrews West Gate).

Biography  Nail became interested in philosophy through his political activism at the University of North Texas, where he received his B.A. in philosophy. He received his Ph.D. from the University of Oregon, where he studied political philosophy, environmental philosophy, feminist philosophy, phenomenology, post-structuralism, and continued his political activism. In Oregon, Nail wrote his dissertation on the theme of political revolution in the work of French philosophers Gilles Deleuze and F√©lix Guattari and the Zapatista uprising in Chiapas, Mexico. This research was the foundation of his first book, Returning to Revolution: Deleuze, Guattari, and Zapatismo, published in 2012. In 2009-2010, Nail was awarded a U.S. Fulbright Scholarship to conduct a year-long participatory research program with the migrant activist movement, No One is Illegal in Toronto, Canada. This was a major source of inspiration for The Figure of the Migrant and Theory of the Border and the beginning of his work on the philosophy of movement.  Philosophy of Movement  Nail defines the philosophy of movement as ‚Äúthe analysis of diverse phenomena across social, aesthetic, scientific, and ontological domains from the primary perspective of motion.‚Äù The philosophy of motion is a unique kind of philosophical methodology. It is related to process philosophy but is distinct from Whitehead's discontinuous \\"occasions\\" and from Bergson's vitalism. ‚ÄúThe difference between simply describing the motion of things, which almost every philosopher and even layperson has done, and the philosophy of movement is the degree to which movement plays an analytically primary role in the description.‚Äù alt= For example, Nail contrasts two methods of describing motion. On the one hand, if we describe a body moving through a space (x, y, z) over a time (t), we are describing motion, but we are not describing motion from the perspective of motion. This is because we have assumed the prior existence of static background spacetime coordinates (x, y, z, t) and the prior existence of a discrete, internally unchanging, ‚Äúbody‚Äù that moves through them. On the other hand, if we describe a situation from the perspective of motion there are no pre-given phenomena of space, time, or discrete bodies. There are only emergent features of matter-in-motion. In other words, if we begin from the perspective that movement (not space, time, or force) is primary, then motion is not reducible to spacetime. Matter-in- motion is not in spacetime but rather produces spacetime itself. This conclusion is consistent with, but not identical to, recent physical theories of motion in quantum gravity. From the perspective of movement, according to Nail, all seemingly discrete bodies are the result of moving flows of matter that continually fold themselves up in various patterns or what he calls ‚Äúfields of motion.‚Äù Nail's philosophy of movement provides a conceptual framework for the study of these patterns of motion through history. = Historical methodology = Nail, however, also claims his philosophy of movement is not a metaphysical theory of reality in itself. Instead, he describes it as a practical and historical methodology oriented by the unprecedented scale and scope of global mobility in the early 21st century. In particular, he names four major historical conditions that situate his thought: mass migration, digital media, quantum physics, and climate change. He therefore describes his philosophy as a ‚Äúhistory of the present.‚Äù = New materialism = Nail also describes his work as loosely part of the recent philosophical tradition of new materialism. The term ‚Äúnew materialism‚Äù has been applied to numerous and divergent philosophies including speculative realists, object-oriented ontologists, and neo-vitalists who all share in common some version of non-anthropocentric realism. However, Nail's work does not fit into any of these camps. His philosophy of movement instead offers a different kind of new materialism insofar as it focuses on the pedetic/indeterministic motion of matter and its various kinetic patterns. His philosophy is also unique among new materialists because of its strongly historical methodology. = Book Series I: The Theory of Motion = Nail's published work is divided into two primary books series. The first series is composed of six ‚Äúcore‚Äù books, each written with a similar organization on five major areas of philosophy: ontology, politics, aesthetics, science, and nature. Each book provides a theory, history, and contemporary case study of the kinetic method. The purpose of each book is to redefine its subject area from a kinetic or process materialist perspective. The Figure of the Migrant (2015) and Theory of the Border (2016) develop a theory and history of what he terms ‚Äúkinopolitics‚Äù based on the study of patterns of social motion. Theory of the Image (2019) develops a ‚Äúkinesthetics‚Äù of moving images in the arts. Theory of the Object (not yet published) develops a ‚Äúkinemetrics‚Äù of moving objects in the sciences. Theory of the Earth (not yet published) develops a ‚Äúgeokinetics‚Äù of nature in motion, and Being and Motion (2018) develops an original historical ontology of motion. = Book Series II: Philosophers of Motion = The second series is composed of several books, each written on a major historical precursor to the philosophy motion. This includes Lucretius, Karl Marx, and Virginia Woolf. Each book offers a kinetic interpretation and close reading of one of these figures as philosophers who made motion their fundamental starting point. They include Lucretius I: An Ontology of Motion, released in 2018; Lucretius II: An Ethics of Motion, 2020, Marx in Motion: A New Materialist Marxism, 2020.

The Indonesians launched an attack on the Japanese garrison with the intent of acquiring weapons for use in the war of independence. Background Shortly after the proclamation of Indonesian independence on 17 August 1945, nationalist youths (pemuda) began seizing power and administrative authority from the Japanese garrison stationed there. In Central Java, they had largely seized civil powers by late September, and negotiations began with Japanese troops for the garrisoned units to surrender their arms to the Indonesians. In some cases, negotiations went favorably for Indonesians, and Japanese commanders surrendered their weapons and relocated outside the major cities, such as in Surakarta. In Yogyakarta, former members of PETA (a Japanese-established volunteer unit) banded together to form part of the Yogyakarta branch of the People's Security Agency (BKR, later People's Security Army/TKR). Among the Indonesian soldiers' leaders in the branch was Suharto, who would later become President of Indonesia. After its establishment, the unit began seeking arms from Japanese units. On 5 October, Sultan of Yogyakarta Hamengkubuwono IX declared his affiliation to the declared Republic of Indonesia, and the Japanese resident of the city was apprehended by the pemuda. Battle On 6 October, local pemuda negotiated with the city's Kenpeitai commander based in the Kotabaru area of Yogyakarta, one major Otzuka, for the surrender of weapons, but the commander refused. The negotiations went on through the night, and Otzuka offered to hand over the weapons if provided with orders from his superior officer, but the Indonesians refused this, and clashes began around 4 AM on 7 October. The clashes lasted for around six hours, during which 21 Indonesians were killed and 32 were wounded, while 9 Japanese soldiers were killed and 20 were wounded. In the heat of the fighting, the Indonesian negotiators returned inside the garrison and again offered an opportunity to surrender - which was accepted by Otzuka, provided the weapons were handed over to the Sultan. Fighting ended at around 10:30, and around 360 Japanese were taken prisoner. Aftermath Following the surrender, the Japanese commander visited Hamengkubuwono IX, formally surrendering the garrison's weapons which was handed over to the newly formed People's Security Army. A monument was later erected to commemorate the battle and the 21 Indonesians killed in the fighting, whose names were used as street names in the Kotabaru area.

Description Old Survivor has a unique shaggy appearance with several large branches drooping outward from its sparse upper crown. The tree is much taller than the surrounding trees, all of which are second growth. Despite its name, the tree, which dates to 1549-1554, is actually young for an old-growth coastal redwood, many of which live between 1200-1800 years old or more. Between 7-12 years before Old Survivor was seeded, Spanish/Portuguese explorer Juan Rodr√≠guez Cabrillo had led the first expedition to explore the coast of what is now California. The tree can be observed at a distance from the York Trail of Leona Heights Park, or from the parking lot of Carl B. Munck Elementary School where there is a plaque detailing the tree's statistics and history. History From 1845 to 1860, logging of the coastal redwoods in the area for their valuable timber wiped out much of the dense coastal redwood forest that once populated the Oakland Hills of East Bay. A second wave of logging following the 1906 San Francisco earthquake further contributed to the forest's destruction, leaving only a few scattered pockets of old-growth redwoods left in the entirety of East Bay. However, Old Survivor's location on an exceptionally steep and rocky slope beside Horseshoe Creek made it unprofitable to log, and thus the tree was spared the fate of its neighbors. In 1916, the land where the tree stands was purchased by the city of Oakland in order to preserve the remaining redwoods in the area. The tree was rediscovered in 1969 by Oakland Parks naturalist Paul Covel in what was then McCrea Memorial Park (today called Leona Heights Park). A core ring count at the time made by Glen Strouse at Humboldt State University estimated the tree's age to be between 415 and 420 years old relative to 1969. The tree's location on an exceptionally steep and rocky slope beside Horseshoe Creek made it unprofitable to log. Old Survivor was designated a City of Oakland Historic Landmark on June 24, 1980. In 2018, the documentary film \\"Old Survivor\\" was released celebrating the tree and reflecting back on the history of Oakland's coastal redwood forests.

The film stars Breeda Wool as a young woman named Eden, who sabotages her wedding day, and makes a life-changing journey in order to retain her identity and independence, to which it leads her down a dark and self-destructive path. Plot On the eve of her wedding, Eden, overcome with pressure at the prospect of married life, suddenly downs a full bottle of scotch in order to numb the suppressed feelings she didn't know she had, although the doubt may have been around for sometime as everyday leading up to the wedding she recorded a supportive and self-affirming message for herself to remind her she is doing the right thing. The following morning, she awakes in the desert covered in cuts and bruises, having no recollection of the night before. Upon seeking help, she finds it difficult to communicate as her jaw is broken. With the help of some strangers, Eden is mistaken for a meth addict and a derelict. Following a seizure caused by a head injury, she is taken to the hospital by a reluctant sheriff. In the meantime, Eden's fiancee, Christopher, becomes frantic when he has difficulty locating her, despite the fact that Eden instructed she be left to her own devices in preparing for the wedding. He remains on edge. Eden undergoes an operation at the hospital to repair her broken jaw; however, when it is discovered that there is a problem with medical insurance, she is offered no further help and is dropped off in Skid Row still dressed in a revealing hospital gown. She wanders around until she is helped by a kind biker named Sam who takes her to a local shelter, run by a religious pastor. Eventually walking off again, Eden finds a scooter and wanders the streets, making dangerous encounters, until she decides it's time to return home. She picks up her wedding dress from the store and goes to her apartment. In trying to convince herself that she loves Christopher enough to marry him, she begins to masturbate while fantasizing about him, which ultimately cases her distress. A distraught Christopher eventually receives a reply from Eden and the wedding is to go ahead as planned on the beach. When she arrives, she looks as Christopher and the guests from a distance and decides not to go through with it and again wanders off. Eden goes to a tattoo parlor, still in her wedding dress, and is having a tattoo design on the right side of her face of a cross which reads \\"RIP Christopher\\". Production Erasing Eden was shot over the course of one year. Director Beth Dewey worked closely with screenplay writer Justo Diaz, where they constructed the story in a way which was stripped down so that the leading character was left to herself in order to tell her story, as opposed to simplifying the plot having it run at a faster pace. Certain aspects of the film were inspired by Dewey's real-life experiences of blackout drinking, where she admitted that when she was in college she would wake up in places and was unaware of how she go there; Dewey also revealed that during the making of the film, her marriage was beginning to unravel and that the story reflected that. Dewey described the character, stating that \\"Eden demonstrates that the modern woman no longer needs a hero or villain in her life. She can be both.\\" The film was shot on a minimal budget using a Canon EOS 5D Mark III, while lighting was supplied by a simple household clip light. During the filming, people were mistaken and believed that the crew were photographing a wedding. Dewey mentioned that \\"it was liberating to roam around with nothing but a bounce board and a DSLR camera.\\" The story was written so that the character of Eden has virtually no dialogue during the film and we become acutely aware of Eden‚Äôs behaviors and reactions. Post production was a much bigger challenge as it was obvious that the story was difficult to follow without dialogue, therefore, Eden's messages to herself were added so that we can get inside her head.

In a somewhat favorable review from Katie Walsh of the Los Angeles Times, she commented on the film's themes of exploration and self-sabotage, however, she went on to mention that \\"those morals are lost in the downright disturbing and degrading gauntlet Eden has to walk through to find herself. With so much focus on the darkness, it‚Äôs hard to embrace the eventual light.\\" In a positive review from Alan NG of Film Threat, he gave the film a rating of 7 out of 10 and praised lead's performance, as well as the writing. He said \\"Breeda Wool gives an exhausting performance in a good way as Eden. She first puts herself through the physical wringer, only to be shoved through an emotional one later on. Kudos to writer/director Beth Dewer and co-writer Justo Diaz for not taking the easy route with their story. Erasing Eden‚Äôs story is not for everyone. Sometimes I wanted to quit in the same way I almost (and actually) gave up on my friends like Eden.

It was part of Walker‚Äôs efforts to dislodge the resurgent Allied Central American Army from its fortifications in Masaya, which lay within a day‚Äôs march of his capital. After significant initial filibuster advances were made, Walker‚Äôs army was forced to retreat towards Granada after receiving notice that the city was under attack.  Background  Following the defeat of the Filibusters at the Battle of San Jacinto on September 14, the newly emboldened Allied Central American Army began to take up the initiative against Walker‚Äôs men. On November 7th, Costa Rican troops under Jose Maria Ca√±as captured the key coastal city of San Juan del Sur. Feeling the pressure, Walker sought to win a decisive victory over the Allied Central American force. The Allied army had been stationed in recently captured Managua up until the 24th of September, when they received the news of the victory at San Jacinto on the 14th.The Legacy of the Filibuster War: National Identity, Collective Memory, and Cultural Anti-Imperialism By Marco Antonio Cabrera Geserick ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY May 2013 Upon hearing this, Ramon Belloso, the leader of the Allied army, elected to pursue Walker‚Äôs army, which had last been spotted near the town of Masaya. On October 2nd, the Allies occupied Masaya without resistance, realizing that Walker and his men had already fled back to their power base at Granada. Foolishly, Walker had left all of his fortifications in Masaya intact and open for use by the Central Americans. More than a week passed before he attempted to retake Masaya, giving the Allied army time to recover from their long march. As Walker‚Äôs army finally began its march towards Masaya from Granada on October 11, it numbered only 800 men, dwarfed in size by the recently reinforced, resupplied, and fortified Allied army of 2,300 men. As Walker‚Äôs force approached, bickering broke out in the ranks of the multinational Central American army, resulting in the departure of 1,000 Guatemalan men, under General Jos√© V√≠ctor Zavala, from the main army under Belloso. Nonplussed, Belloso ensured that the loyal portion of his still large army remained unperturbed by any small arguments, restoring harmony before Walker‚Äôs arrival.  Battle  Scene from the Battle of San Jacinto (1856) Having begun their march in the morning, the 800 men under Walker arrived in Masaya as darkness was beginning to fall on October 11. Instantly taking up the initiative, Walker attacked, winning a small skirmish and capturing the small plaza of San Sebastian. Sporadic fire continued throughout the night, and by dawn on the 12th, the filibusters, led by their two howitzers under the command of a certain Captain Schwartz, had pushed the city‚Äôs defenders all the way back to the main plaza. Positioned in adobe houses surrounding the plaza, Walker‚Äôs small force of men found it impossible to capture the plaza itself despite having the Allied Central Americans on the back foot, and inconclusive fighting was carried out throughout the rest of the day and into the night. That midnight, a courier arrived from Granada with the shocking news that the Guatemalan force under Zavala which had earlier detached from Belloso‚Äôs army was now beginning to approach Walker‚Äôs capital, Granada. Defended by a mere 250 men, Walker knew that the rescue of his vulnerable capital would have to take priority over the current engagement at Masaya, and thus ordered the siege of the plaza lifted. Early in the morning on the 13th, Walker and his force retreated to the southeast, ending the battle.  Aftermath  Walker‚Äôs speed in returning to Granada after the failure at Masaya shocked the Guatemalans who had so recently taken the city, and Walker quickly retook his capital, with his men brutally gunning down helpless soldiers of Zavala‚Äôs force as an act of revenge in response to their initial capture of the filibuster capital. In Masaya and Granada, Walker had lost over 100 men, with Allied losses being similarly heavy. Denied the opportunity to repel a large Central American force from so near his capital, Walker would soon again attempt to retake Masaya, only to be met with similarly frustrating results.

When the former provided an account of the latter's good qualities, Susƒ´ma approached the Buddha with an assembly of deities. After properly greeting him, the young deva repeated ƒÄnanda's praises, adding that among the gods, the same praises may be heard. The assembly radiated a rainbow of colors in response to Susƒ´ma's words. Susƒ´ma then spoke in verse: > :He‚Äôs considered to be an astute person, :SƒÅriputta, free of anger. :Few in > wishes, sweet, tamed, :the hermit shines in the Teacher‚Äôs praise! The Buddha responded: > :He‚Äôs considered to be an astute person, :SƒÅriputta, free of anger. :Few in > wishes, sweet, tamed; :developed and well-tamed, he bides his time. The second sutta begins with the Buddha informing his disciples about the battle between the devas and the asuras. He explains that Sakka appealed to Susƒ´ma to join in the fight against the asuras. When Susƒ´ma fell into negligence, the two gods speak to each other in verse about laziness. The Buddha concludes the sermon by reminding the monks of the virtue of applying effort and initiative. Mahayana In the Chinese Buddhist canon, Susƒ´ma appears in the SarvƒÅstivƒÅda Sa·πÉyukta ƒÄgama (SA 1306) and the KƒÅ≈õyapƒ´ya Sa·πÉyukta ƒÄgama (SA-2 305), where his name is transliterated as; È†àÊ∑±Êë© or È†àÊ∑±Â§©Â≠ê, and È†àÂ∞∏Êë©Â§©Â≠ê; respectively. Both of these sutras generally correspond in content to SN 2.29 of the Pali Canon. The deity also appears briefly in several Mahayana Sutras, including: *MƒÅyopamasamƒÅdhi S≈´tra (ËßÄ‰∏ñÈü≥Ëè©Ëñ©ÊéàË®òÁ∂ì) (where his name is translated as ÂñÑÁïåÂ§©Â≠ê) *Sa·πÉv·πõtiparamƒÅrthasatyanirde≈õa S≈´tra *Su·π£·π≠hitamatidevaputraparip·πõcchƒÅ S≈´tra (Â¶ÇÂπª‰∏âÊòßÁ∂ì, T 0342). *RatnajƒÅli Parip·πõcchƒÅ S≈´tra (‰ΩõË™™ÂØ∂Á∂≤Á∂ì, T 0433) *Ma√±ju≈õrƒ´vikurvƒÅ·πáa Parivarta S≈´tra (‰ΩõË™¨È≠îÈÄÜÁ∂ì, T 0589) *Sutra of the One-Syllable Wheel-Turning Ruler Spoken at the Seat of Enlightenment (Ëè©ÊèêÂ†¥ÊâÄË™¨‰∏ÄÂ≠óÈ†ÇËº™ÁéãÁ∂ì, T 0950) References Category:Buddhist gods ","title":"Susƒ´ma (deity)"},{"id":"62264129","title":"Modern pentathlon at the 1952 Summer Olympics ‚Äì Men's"},{"id":"62264136","text":"Zahra Hankir (Arabic ÿ≤Ÿáÿ±ÿ© ÿ≠ŸÜŸÉŸäÿ±) is a Lebanese-British journalist and editor.

His initial narrow ten vote victory in 1917 against incumbent Albert S. Drew is the closest mayoral election in Burlington's history, although Clarence H. Beecher's 1927 victory was decreased from 89 votes to 8 votes by a Supreme Court ruling in 1929, and wasn't matched until Bernie Sanders won the 1981 mayoral election by ten votes after a recount. Life Jackson was born in Montreal, Canada and moved to Vermont with family which later became a prominent Vermont political family which included his brothers, Horatio Nelson Jackson and Hollister Jackson. Following his graduation from the Philadelphia Dental College he practiced dentistry in Barre, Vermont until 1896 when he moved to Burlington, Vermont. In 1894 Jackson was put on trial for interfering with an officer while he was beating a criminal and was found not guilty. In 1917, Jackson defeated the incumbent Republican Albert S. Drew in the Burlington mayoral election by ten votes with 1,416 votes to 1,406 votes. In 1919 Jackson won reelection against Harris R. Watkins with 2,149 votes to 1,930 votes. During his tenure in 1918 he handled the Spanish flu outbreak in the city and motorized the fire department and in 1919 he became one of the first Vermonters and politicians to ride in a seaplane. In 1920, Jackson was elected to represent Burlington in the Vermont House of Representatives and he served one term, 1921 to 1923. In 1921 he was elected to a third term after defeating William B. McKillip with 1,941 votes to 1,476 votes. In 1922 he was the Democratic nominee for governor, but was defeated in a landslide by Redfield Proctor Jr. with 51,104 votes to 17,059 votes. In 1923 he faced no opposition for reelection as mayor, with both the Democratic and Republican city committees choosing to endorse him. At the 1924 Democratic National Convention, Jackson was a delegate and on the 39th ballot received one vote for president. John W. Davis won the nomination on the 103rd ballot, and lost the general election to incumbent Republican Calvin Coolidge. On April 1, 1929, Jackson returned to the mayoralty. Shortly after taking office he shut down the city Convention Bureau, which was unable to account for all of the $5,000 of city funds it spent to host the 1928 New England Firemen's Convention. After winning reelection he was nominated for lieutenant governor in 1930; he lost, as did all statewide Democratic candidates during this era, but received two percent more of the vote than Park Pollard, his party's nominee for governor. In the 1930 House election he endorsed former Burlington municipal court judge Joseph A. McNamara in his unsuccessful run. Jackson declined to run for reelection and endorsed former mayor James Edmund Burke. Burke won, and on April 3, 1933 he succeeded Jackson as mayor. In 1936, Jackson was a delegate to the state Democratic convention. He also attended the national convention as a supporter of Franklin D. Roosevelt, who was renominated by acclimation. During World War II, Jackson, James J. Carney, and Phillips M. Bell were appointed by Governor William Wills to serve as Burlington's rationing board. Personal life On June 4, 1901, Jackson married Caroline Deming Smalley, the granddaughter of David Allen Smalley, who served as judge of the United States District Court for the District of Vermont and chairman of the Democratic National Committee. They were the parents of a son, Bradley Smalley Jackson. During his career as mayor he appointed Caroline to multiple positions including the library board of commissioners. On December 14, 1944, Jackson died at the Bishop DeGoesbriand Hospital (later merged with the University of Vermont Medical Center). He was buried at Lakeview Cemetery in Burlington.

Within Plaza Mayor, you can find several important buildings, such as the town hall, the Juan Bravo Theatre, the San Miguel Church, and the cathedral.  History  Centuries before the plaza was built in the 17th century, the space was treated as the center of the village, where vendors would install their stands and citizens would socialize and meet. It is said that in the middle ages, the street was known as Calle de la Cinteria, which means Ribbon Street because of the sector's shops and all its vendors. The town hall was built in the 17th century and ever since has been the building where the majority of Segovian events take place. Then towards the left of the town hall, there is the Cathedral known as Santa Maria de la Asuncion and San Frutos that was built between 1525 and 1577. The Church of San Miguel collapsed in the year 1532 but was then rebuilt in the same current place. As the core of Segovia, the plaza was the center of political activity, where the council of the city would meet in the atrium of San Miguel. It was also the center for economical activity, especially because of the market granted by Enrique IV that up to today still continues to take place every Thursday. It is said that Plaza Mayor is considered to be a religious area due to the holidays that are celebrated within it and because it is located closest to the Cathedral.The kiosk located in the middle of Plaza Mayor in the evening.One of the main buildings in the plaza, Juan Bravo Theater, was built in 1917 and is still in use today for both locals and tourists. At the end of the 19th century, the plaza was filled with coffee shops, hotels, and boutique stores, leading to a higher rate of tourism for Segovia. Lastly, the name of the plaza has changed over the years. At first its name was Plaza Mayor and later during the Bourbon Restoration it was called Plaza de la Constituci√≥n. After the civil war, it was changed to Plaza de Franco, until it was once again changed to its original name, Plaza Mayor, at the end of Francisco Franco's dictatorship.  Characteristics  Plaza Mayor is essentially shaped as a rectangle. The cathedral known as Santa Maria de la Asunci√≥n and San Frutos was built using Gothic architecture. On the other hand, the Juan Bravo Theatre was built in a way that it rises on a granite archway. There is also a small kiosk located in the middle of the plaza where people tend to play music and have social gatherings for Segovian festivities.  Segovian festivals  Plaza Mayor is the center for many Spanish holidays, especially Segovian ones. For example, fiestas Frutos de Segovia, which is celebrated with Segovian artists such as the painter Amadeo Olmos who in 2019 was in charge of the illustration that expressed the desire of the hermit on a sheet: ‚ÄòWe are all in the same tree‚Äô, representing San Frutos next to a bird.Plaza Mayor during Segovian Festival San Frutos October 25, 2019.The plaza has been the center of the city for a long time, a meeting place for parties and public rejoicing. In the Plaza Mayor the traditional fairs of San Juan are held until the day of San Pedro, June 29. During these traditional fairs, folk walks, illuminations, and fireworks take place.

It was based on the World of Darkness series' setting, which several of White Wolf Publishing's tabletop role- playing games take place in. Players were to have assumed the roles of humans who could be turned into vampires of one of seven vampiric clans with various abilities. The gameplay was going to be nonlinear and focus on social interaction and politics, with goals reached both through combat and through players forming alliances with each other. The game's development was long and troubled, with organization and management issues including staff from the development team being moved to other CCP Games projects for months at a time, significantly slowing down progress and leading to work being abandoned and redone repeatedly. The team size was also significantly decreased throughout the production, with several rounds of layoffs. Although World of Darkness was considered one of the highest-profile games to have been canceled in the 2010s, the cancellation and layoffs were not unusual for the video game industry, something The Guardian considered a scandal in itself. Preview impressions of the game were generally positive, particularly of its visuals and experimental gameplay, while later impressions based on leaked screenshots were less favorable. Gameplay alt=A screenshot of a city environment in a 3D game, showing four characters, one of which is a vampire, and three of which are humans. The player-controlled vampire is shown sucking blood from a human character's neck. World of Darkness was planned to be an open world, single-server massively multiplayer online role-playing game. It was meant to take place at night and have a supernatural horror theme, and was based on the World of Darkness series' setting ‚Äì the shared fictional universe of several of White Wolf Publishing's tabletop role-playing games, including Vampire: The Masquerade. Players were planned to start the game as humans, with the possibility of being turned into a vampire from one of seven vampire clans with access to various vampiric powers, such as sucking blood, running quickly, and leaping high in the air. Other World of Darkness character types such as werewolves or mages were not planned to be playable at launch, but would possibly appear as non-player characters (NPCs) or as player characters in an expansion pack or in a separate game; ghouls were planned to be included as minions to the player characters, which could be sent on missions. The gameplay was going to be nonlinear, and focused on social interaction and politics among players, with web-based communication tools available. The game was to emulate the politics of World of Darkness tabletop games, allowing players things such as achieving the role of a vampire prince by being voted into office and rule a stylized version of one of several real-life capital cities, and communicate with other cities. Cities were to be divided into different kinds of zones, including social zones like a coffeehouse district where players could meet up, and zones where players could fight territory battles. Like in Vampire: The Masquerade, combat and killing was not going to be necessary, as players instead were to be able to reach their goals through creating alliances with other players; player-versus-player and player-versus- environment combat was however also going to be to an option, and permanent death would be applied to player characters who die. The game was also planned to include tools to create items, distinctly different from typical item crafting systems in games. Development =Production and cancellation= alt=The logo of CCP Games World of Darkness was developed by the Icelandic developer CCP Games, and was directed by Reynir Hardarson and produced by Chris McDonough, with concept art by Erling S√¶varsson. The game was said to be in its early planning stages during the announcement of CCP Games' merger with White Wolf in late 2006; in June 2007, CCP Games estimated that the game would take them four to five years to finish. The game was eventually unveiled three years later along with a trailer and concept art at White Wolf's Grand Masquerade event in New Orleans in 2010, with a planned release date of 2012. The next year, CCP Games laid off 20% of its staff, about 120 people, as they had been stretching their resources too thin; they moved their focus to their MMORPG Eve Online, but did not cancel World of Darkness, instead letting its development continue with a significantly reduced development team; by 2012, the game was still in its pre-production phase, with a team of 60 working full-time on it. The team had grown to 70 by early 2013, 15 of which were laid off later in the year. By early 2014, CCP Games described the game as still \\"years away\\". In April of the same year, the game was canceled, and 54 staff members at CCP Atlanta were laid off, with remaining staff there shifting to working on Eve-related games. According to World of Darkness staff, the cancellation came after a troubled development, which they described as having issues relating to management and organization; staff often had to switch to working on other projects for 3‚Äì6 months, and at times the entire World of Darkness team was working on Eve projects, particularly leading up to the 2009 Eve expansion Apocrypha. Because staff kept getting moved between World of Darkness and other projects, progress was significantly slowed down, and partially-finished features and systems ended up getting abandoned and re- started several times. According to former CCP Games developer Nick Blood, very little of the core game was implemented five years into the production, with nothing to appreciate for people who were not already fans of the setting. After Paradox Interactive acquired the World of Darkness series in 2015, including the produced assets from the video game, they said that the art and ideas that had been created for it would be used in other World of Darkness projects. =Design= CCP Games wanted the game to be more similar to live action role-playing games than massively multiplayer online games; to achieve this, they focused on encouraging human interactions and social gameplay by rewarding players for creating social networks, similarly to those in the World of Darkness tabletop games. Comparing it to Eve Online, they were hoping to attract a larger number of female players, citing Eve Online lack of accessibility, its complexity, and bad game design as reasons women would be less likely to be interested in it, as well as its science-fiction setting compared to World of Darkness supernatural horror. Influenced by the games DayZ and Rust, CCP Games wanted World of Darkness to have an open world and unstructured game mechanics, allowing for natural player interactions. The developers also wanted the game to focus on traversal and movement in a vampiric, \\"super-powered individual\\" manner, something McDonough described as akin to a \\"vampire simulator\\"; they did not plan to put much focus on developing functionality for human player characters at launch, but considered adding expansions later on for human characters who are hunters or mages. The developers chose to set the game in the original World of Darkness setting rather than its successor, Chronicles of Darkness, despite the original World of Darkness line of tabletop games already having ended; this was because of how Vampire: The Masquerade was what White Wolf was known for, and was the more influential game, even though some tabletop players might care more about the Chronicles of Darkness setting. Reception Although GameSpot described World of Darkness as one of the most notable games to have been canceled in the last few years as of 2019, other publications found it typical for the industry: The Guardian wrote that the \\"real scandal\\" was that job cuts like those are common in the video game industry, Polygon described it as neither shocking nor unusual, and Kotaku called it disappointing but unsurprising. Preview impressions of World of Darkness were positive, praising its visuals and how it felt new and experimental; PCGamesN considered it one of the most interesting MMOs in development at the time, with a lot of potential, and IGN described it as \\"super-stylish\\". Following the cancellation, Polygon echoed these sentiments, calling the experience it was promising unique, and noting its freedom and ability to manipulate game politics interesting; because of this, and how there were no future World of Darkness games expected at the time, they thought the cancellation hit particularly hard for fans of the series. Following the emergence of leaked screenshots and a manual from the game, however, Rock, Paper, Shotgun thought that the game looked poor, describing it as feeling \\"too MMORPG-y\\" and not enough like World of Darkness, lacking its mystique, sexiness and excitement. Gamereactor similarly considered it a good example of the lacklusterness of CCP Games' projects outside of Eve Online.

It is situated north of the Canada‚ÄìUnited States border, west of Chilliwack Lake, and east of Slesse Mountain, which is its nearest higher neighbor. Precipitation runoff from the peak drains into Nesakwatch and Centre Creeks, both tributaries of the Chilliwack River. Originally known as Ensawkwatch, the mountain was named for an early settler in the area, Rexford, who had a cabin near Slesse Creek and had trap lines in the vicinity. The mountain has two subsidiary peaks known as the Nesakwatch Spires. The mountain's name was officially adopted on June 2, 1950, by the Geographical Names Board of Canada. Mount Rexford was first climbed in July 1951 by Herman Genschorek and Walt Sparling via the West Ridge. Geology Mount Rexford is composed of granitic rock related to the Chilliwack batholith, which intruded the region 26 to 29 million years ago after the major orogenic episodes in the region. This is part of the Pemberton Volcanic Belt, an eroded volcanic belt that formed as a result of subduction of the Farallon Plate starting 29 million years ago.Cenozoic to Recent plate configurations in the Pacific Basin: Ridge subduction and slab window magmatism in western North AmericaCatalogue of Canadian volcanoes: Franklin Glacier During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area. The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks and ridges, deep glacial valleys, and granite spires. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to various climate differences which lead to vegetation variety defining the ecoregions in this area. Climate Based on the K√∂ppen climate classification, Mount Rexford is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel east toward the Cascade Range where they are forced upward by the range (Orographic lift), causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall.

Due to Priest's color-blindness, his primary medium was pen and ink, which he put to great use in inexpensively printed, highly graphic, rock posters. Often printed in single color or split-fountain reliefs, the posters were done mostly for Armadillo World Headquarters, a music hall in Austin, Texas that operated from August 7, 1970 to December 31, 1980.  Biography  Priest had a prodigious and humorous cartoon style inspired by Walt Disney. In the seventh grade he was awarded a scholarship to the California Institute of the Arts, founded by Walt Disney in Santa Clarita, California in 1961, but his family moved from California to Texas before he could start school. Undeterred, he adopted his personal interpretation of the style anyway, stating it \\"was actually a brush style where you used the varying thickness of line to imply weight, depth, or shadow.\\" His 1972 poster for the Armadillo World Headquarters for a Willie Nelson and Greezy Wheels set him on a path that eventually totaled more than 100 posters for the Armadillo alone. Priest moved to Austin in 1969, where he got his start at the Vulcan Gas Company, a rock music venue in Austin. He worked with artist Jim Franklin and took over as art director after cartoonist Gilbert Shelton moved to San Francisco to become a key member of the underground comix movement. Beginning in 1972, Priest ran a counter-culture art studio called Directions Company and commissioned artists for various clients, beginning with Eddie Wilson of The Armadillo World Headquarters. \\"The Armadillo Art Squad,\\" with Priest as its most prominent member, included artists Michael E. Arth, Kerry Awn, Guy Juke, Ken Featherston, Jim Franklin, Danny Garrett, Henry Gonzales, Bill Narum, Dale Wilkins, and Sam Yeates. Directions Company closed down in 1974. In 1976, priest, John Rodgers and Sam Yeates founded an arts collective called Sheauxnough Studios. Obituaries An obituary in The Austin Chronicle described Priest: > Besides art, Micael was a master of the story. He was never short of them. > The city and the state it capitalized; citizens of all stripes and denizens > of cafes, bars and clubs; the countryside and its critters; the music and > the musicians ‚Äì especially these ‚Äì were all grist for his mill. Stories > constituted the air he breathed, with the exhale always more than the > inhale. Always. He was a counter-cultural sage, and frequently dressed the > part. So much so, in fact, that in his later years, he cut the striking > figure of a hippie Gandolf, parting the air with a yarn, and the pavement > with his serpentine walking stick. Colorful in language, and wicked smart in > perception, he crafted tales that still glow like embers in deep memory. > When you observed the Priest story train passing, a chuckle was always the > caboose. Kerry Awn, a member of the Amadillo Art Squad, described Priest in an Austin Chronicle obituary: > Priest was a walking, talking, real-life cowboy hippie cartoon character > artist. Ink ran through his veins. When he came to town he changed > everything just by being himself. He never heard a story he couldn't > embellish, an experience he couldn't top, nor a chance to let you in on a > pearl of wisdom spoken in a down-home manner so thick you might have thought > it was all an act.

Education In the 1970s, Arianrhod left her honours program in mathematics to join a radical counterculture community, without electricity, running water, or communications. She returned to school, earned a bachelor's degree from Monash University in 1993, and a doctorate from Monash University in 2003. She remains affiliated with Monash University as an honorary research associate in the mathematical sciences. Books Arianrhod's first book, Einstein's Heroes: Imagining the World through the Language of Mathematics (University of Queensland Press and Oxford University Press, 2005) has little to do with Albert Einstein himself. The titular heroes are James Clerk Maxwell, Michael Faraday, and Isaac Newton, and (although the book is broad-ranging in its outline of the development of physics) the central narrative is Maxwell's development of Maxwell's equations for electromagnetism. Einstein kept a portrait of Maxwell in his laboratory, and Maxwell in turn was inspired by Faraday and Newton. A broader goal of the book is to communicate the beauty of mathematics and the way that mathematical language has become central to modern physics.; Seduced by Logic: √âmilie du Ch√¢telet, Mary Somerville and the Newtonian Revolution (Oxford University Press, 2012) describes and compares the accomplishments and lives of two women of mathematics separated by a century, √âmilie du Ch√¢telet in 18th-century France, and Mary Somerville in 19th-century England. Both women are best known for their popularization of the works of others, Newton's Principia Mathematica for Du Ch√¢telet and Pierre-Simon Laplace's Trait√© de m√©canique c√©leste for Somerville, but they had many other accomplishments, and the book keeps their scientific work in the foreground. Her treatment of Somerville has been criticized for ignoring Kathryn Neeley's earlier work on Somerville, and also criticizes the book for its anachronistic treatment of lines of research that have been superseded by modern physics and its imprecise referencing to its source material. Her newest book is Thomas Harriot: A Life in Science (Oxford University Press, 2019). A biography of 16th-century English polymath Thomas Harriot, it also establishes Harriot's contributions to astronomy, optics, physics, cartography, ethnology, and linguistics, which until recently had been little known,; in part because of Harriot's failure to publish his discoveries.; References External links * Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:21st-century Australian historians Category:21st-century Australian women writers Category:Australian women historians Category:Historians of science Category:Monash University alumni ","title":"Robyn Arianrhod"},{"id":"62264729","text":"350px Holy Family under an Oak Tree or Madonna of the Oak Tree is an oil on panel painting by Giulio Romano using a composition or underdrawing by Raphael.

Image courtesy of NASA. The North Atlantic Aerosols and Marine Ecosystems Study (NAAMES) was a five-year scientific research program that investigated aspects of phytoplankton dynamics in ocean ecosystems, and how such dynamics influence atmospheric aerosols, clouds, and climate. The study focused on the sub-arctic region of the North Atlantic Ocean, which is the site of one of Earth's largest recurring phytoplankton blooms. The long history of research in this location, as well as relative ease of accessibility, made the North Atlantic an ideal location to test prevailing scientific hypotheses in an effort to better understand the role of phytoplankton aerosol emissions on Earth's energy budget. NAAMES was led by scientists from Oregon State University and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). They conducted four field campaigns from 2015-2018 that were designed to target specific phases of the annual phytoplankton cycle: minimum, climax, intermediary decreasing biomass, and increasing intermediary biomass. The campaigns were designed to observe each unique phase, in order to resolve the scientific debates on the timing of bloom formations and the patterns driving annual bloom re-creation. The NAAMES project also investigated the quantity, size, and composition of aerosols generated by primary production in order to understand how bloom cycles affect cloud formations and climate. Scientists employed multiple complementary research methods, including intensive field sampling via research ships, airborne aerosol sampling via airplane, and remote sensing via satellites. The findings from NAAMES, while still forthcoming, have shed light on aerosols and cloud condensation nuclei, phytoplankton annual cycles, phytoplankton physiology, and mesoscale biology. Several methodological advances have also been published, including new remote sensing algorithms and advances in satellite remote sensing.  Background = Competing hypotheses of plankton blooms = 379x379px NAAMES sought to better understand the impact of bioaerosol emissions on cloud dynamics and climate. It also aimed to test two competing hypotheses on plankton blooms: Critical Depth Hypothesis - a resource-based view The critical depth hypothesis is a resource-based view of the North Atlantic annual phytoplankton blooms. It is the traditional explanation for the cause of spring blooms and has been documented as a foundational concept in oceanography textbooks for over 50 years. It focuses on the environmental conditions necessary to initiate a bloom such as high nutrients, shallower mixing, increased light, and warmer temperatures. The central argument for the critical depth hypothesis is that blooms are a consequence of increased phytoplankton growth rates resulting from shoaling of the mixed layer above the critical depth. The critical depth is a surface mixing depth where phytoplankton biomass growth equals phytoplankton biomass losses. In this hypothesis, losses are both constant and independent of growth. The decline in biomass may be due to grazing, sinking, dilution, vertical mixing, infection, or parasitism. When the surface mixed layer becomes shallower than the critical depth, initiation of the seasonal bloom occurs due to phytoplankton growth exceeding loss. There is a correlation of phytoplankton growth with springtime increases of light, temperature, and shallower stratification depths. Climate warming may increase stratification or decrease mixed layer depth during the winter, which would enhance the vernal bloom or increase phytoplankton biomass if this hypothesis governed spring phytoplankton bloom dynamics. A primary criticism of this resource-based view is that spring blooms occur in the absence of stratification or shoaling of the mixed layer. Dilution-recoupling Hypothesis - an ecosystem-based view The dilution-recoupling hypothesis is an ecosystem-based view of the North Atlantic annual phytoplankton bloom. This hypothesis focuses on the physical processes that alter the balance between growth and grazing. The spring bloom is considered to be one feature of an annual cycle, and other features during the cycle ‚Äúset the stage‚Äù for this bloom to occur. This ecosystem-based view is based upon a dilution experiment where the addition of seawater dilutes predators but does not change the growth of phytoplankton. Thus, growth rates increase with dilution. Although the dilution effect is transient, predator-prey interactions can be maintained if the rate of the addition of water equals the rate of growth. The deepening of the surface mixed layer dilutes the predator-prey interactions and decouples growth and grazing. When the mixed layer stops deepening, the increase in growth rate becomes apparent, but now growth and grazing become coupled again. The shoaling of the mixed layer concentrates predators, thereby increasing grazing pressure. However, the increase in light availability counters grazing pressure, which allows growth rates to remain high. In late spring, when the mixed layer is even more shallow, nutrient depletion or overgrazing ends the bloom -- losses exceed growth at this point in the cycle. Climate warming would increase stratification and suppress winter mixing that occurs with the deepening of the mixed layer. The suppression of winter mixing would decrease phytoplankton biomass under this hypothesis. =Physical oceanographic processes= Mixed Layer Depth Debate  Meso-scale Eddies Meso-scale eddies play a significant role in modulating the Mixed Layer Depth (MLD). Fluctuations created by mesoscale eddies modulate nutrients in the base of the mixed layer.Gaube, P., J. McGillicuddy Jr, D., & Moulin, A. J. (2019). Mesoscale eddies modulate mixed layer depth globally. Geophysical Research Letters, 46(3), 1505-1512. These modulations, along with light availability, drive the abundance of phytoplankton in the region. The availability of phytoplankton significantly affects the marine food web and ocean health. The Anticyclonic eddies rotate clockwise and the Cyclonic eddies rotate counter- clockwise. Downwelling and Upwelling processes in the open ocean leads to a warm-core in Anticyclonic eddies and a cold-core in Cyclonic eddies. The fast-moving currents in the Gulf Stream meander and pinch-off to create eddies. These eddies retain the physical properties of their parent water mass (e.g. temperature, density, salinity, and other ocean dynamic properties) when they separate. As the eddies migrate, their physical properties change as they mix with the surrounding water. In the Gulf Stream, migrating eddies are known as anticyclonic or cyclonic eddies based on the direction in which they spin (clockwise vs. counter-clockwise). The two eddies differ in motion, physical properties, and, consequently, their effects on biology and chemistry of the ocean. The Coriolis force combined with high velocity currents drive eddy motion. This motion creates a 'bulge,' i.e., high sea surface height (SSH) in the center of the Anticyclonic eddies. In contrast, cyclonic eddies exhibit a low SSH in the center. The SSH in both anticyclonic and cyclonic decreases and increases, respectively, as the distance from the center increases.Gaube, P., Chelton, D. B., Samelson, R. M., Schlax, M. G., & O‚ÄôNeill, L. W. (2015). Satellite observations of mesoscale eddy-induced Ekman pumping. Journal of Physical Oceanography, 45(1), 104-132. Upwelling and downwelling processes in the eddies create a cold and warm core.Chi, P. C., Chen, Y., & Lu, S. (1998). Wind-driven South China Sea deep basin warm-core/cool-core eddies. Journal of Oceanography, 54(4), 347-360. Chicago Downwelling in the anticyclonic eddy prevents colder water from entering the surface, thus creating a warm-core in the center. Whereas in the cyclonic eddy, the upwelling entrains deep cold water and forms a cold-core. Previous studies show the deepening effects of MLD under anticyclonic eddies and shoaling of MLD in cyclonic eddies.Klein, P., Treguier, A. M., & Hua, B. L. (1998). Three-dimensional stirring of thermohaline fronts. Journal of marine research, 56(3), 589-612.Kunze, E. (1986). The mean and near-inertial velocity fields in a warm-core ring. Journal of physical oceanography, 16(8), 1444-1461. These phenomena may be due to increased heat loss to the atmosphere in anticyclonic eddies. This loss of heat causes the sinking of dense water, referred to as convective mixingTalley, L. D. (2011). Descriptive physical oceanography: an introduction. Academic press., and the deepening of the MLD. In contrast, in cyclonic eddies the water temperature at the core is less cold than the Anticyclonic eddy. This therefore does not lead to deepening of the MLD. Studies conducted in the region via a network of Argo Floats and model simulations created through satellite data have shown cases of the opposite phenomena. The deepening and shoaling of MLD via eddies is ubiquitous and varies seasonally. Such anomalies are most significant in the winter. Thus, the role of meso-scale eddies in MLD is complex, and a function of simultaneous processes where enhanced wind shear induced currents contribute to a shallowing of the MLD in anticyclonic eddies. = Relevant Atmospheric Processes = Marine Boundary Layer The marine boundary layer (MBL) is the part of the atmosphere in direct contact with the ocean surface. The MBL is influenced by the exchange of heat, moisture, gases, particulates, and momentum, primarily via turbulence. The MBL is characterized by the formation of convective cells (or vertical flow of air) above the ocean surface, which perturbs the direction of the mean surface wind and generates texture, roughness, and waves on the sea's surface. Two types of boundary layers exist. One is a stable, convective layer found between the lower 100m of the atmosphere extending up to approximately 3km in height, and is referred to as the convective boundary layer (CBL). The other boundary layer forms as a result of a surface atmospheric inversion. This generally occurs closer to the surface in the absence of turbulence and vertical mixing, and is determined through the interpretation of vertical humidity and temperature profiles. The MBL is often a localized and temporally dynamic phenomenon, and therefore its height into the air column can vary considerably from one region to another, or even across the span of a few days. The North Atlantic is a region where diverse and well-formed MBL clouds are commonly formed, and where MBL layer height can be between 2.0-and 0.1km in height  Regional Atmospheric Processes  The westerlies are prevailing winds in the middle latitudes (between 35 and 65 degrees latitude), which blow in regions north or southward of the high-pressure sub-tropical regions of the world. Consequently, aerosols sampled over the North Atlantic Ocean will be influenced by air masses originating in North America, and therefore be characterized by both the natural terrestrial and anthropogenic inputs. Relevant to NAAMES are the emissions from industry and urban environments in eastern North America, which emit substantial quantities of sulfates, black carbon, and aromatic compounds. Such substances can be transported hundreds of kilometers over the sea. This contribution of continental influences may create a false positive signal in the biological fluorescence signals being measured and could affect cloud microphysical properties in the open North Atlantic Ocean. Furthermore, aerosols such as black carbon mixed with carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases are emitted through the impartial combustion of fossil fuels from ship engines. These unburned hydrocarbons are present in the marine boundary layer of the North Atlantic and most other remote oceanic regions. As these particles age or are chemically transformed as a function of time in the air, they may alter microphysical and chemical properties as they react with other airborne particles. = Role of aerosols = alt=  Aerosols  Aerosols are very small, solid particles or liquid droplets suspended in the atmosphere or inside another gas and are formed through natural processes or by human actions. Natural aerosols include volcanic ash, biological particles, and mineral dust, as well as black carbon from the natural combustion of biomass, such as wildfires. Anthropogenic aerosols are those that have been emitted from human actions, such as fossil fuel burning or industrial emissions. Aerosols are classified as either primary or secondary depending on whether they have been directly emitted into the atmosphere (primary) or whether they have reacted and changed in composition (secondary) after being emitted from their source. Aerosols emitted from the marine environment are one of the largest components of primary natural aerosols. Marine primary aerosols interact with anthropogenic pollution, and through these reactions produce other secondary aerosols. alt= One of the most significant yet uncertain components of predictive climate change models is the impact of aerosols on the climate system. Aerosols affect Earth's radiation balance directly and indirectly. The direct effect occurs when aerosol particles scatter, absorb, or exhibit a combination of these two optical properties when interacting with incoming solar and infrared radiation in the atmosphere. Aerosols that typically scatter light include sulfates, nitrates, and some organic particles, while those that tend to exhibit a net absorption include mineral dust and black carbon (or soot). The second mechanism by which aerosols alter the planet's temperature is called the indirect effect, which occurs when a cloud's microphysical properties are altered causing either an increase in reflection of incoming solar radiation, or an inhibited ability of clouds to develop precipitation. The first indirect effect is an increase in the amount of water droplets, which leads to an increase in clouds that reflect more solar radiation and therefore cool the planet's surface. The second indirect effect (also called the cloud's lifetime effect) is the increase in droplet numbers, which simultaneously causes an increase in droplet size, and therefore less potential for precipitation. That is, smaller droplets mean clouds live longer and retain higher liquid water content, which is associated with lower precipitation rates and higher cloud albedo. This highlights the importance of aerosol size as one of the primary determinants of aerosol quantity in the atmosphere, how aerosols are removed from the atmosphere, and the implications of these processes in climate . Fine particles are generally those below 2 micrometers (Œºm) in diameter. Within this category, the range of particles that accumulate in the atmosphere (due to low volatility or condensation growth of nuclei) are from 0.1-1 Œºm, and are usually removed from the air through wet deposition. Wet deposition can be precipitation, snow or hail. On the other hand, coarse particles, such as old sea-spray and plant- derived particles, are removed from the atmosphere via dry deposition. This process is sometimes also called sedimentation. However, different types of biogenic organic aerosols exhibit different microphysical properties, and therefore their removal mechanisms from the air will depend on humidity. Without a better understanding of aerosol sizes and composition in the North Atlantic Ocean, climate models have limited ability to predict the magnitude of the cooling effect of aerosols in global climate. Contribution of aerosols and gases in the atmosphere of to the Earth's radiative forcing. This is Figure 8.17 of Working Group 1 Firth Assessment (AR5) report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Note the net cooling effect of sulphates.  Sea-spray Aerosols  Although the amount and composition of aerosol particles in the marine atmosphere originate both from continental and oceanic sources and can be transported great distances, freshly emitted sea-spray aerosols (SSA) constitute one of the major sources of primary aerosols, especially from moderate and strong winds. The estimated global emission of pure sea-salt aerosols are on the order of 2,000-10,000 Tg per year. The mechanism by which this occurs starts with the generation of air bubbles in breaking waves, which then rise to the atmosphere and burst into hundreds of ultra-fine droplets ranging from 0.1-1.0 Œºm in diameter. Sea-spray aerosols are mostly composed of inorganic salts, such as sodium and chloride. However, these bubbles sometimes carry organic material found in seawater, forming secondary organic compounds (SOAs) such as dimethyl sulfide (DMS). This compound plays a key role in the NAAMES project. An important biogeochemical consequence of SSA are their role as cloud condensation nuclei. These are particles that provide the surfaces necessary for water vapor to condensate below supersaturation conditions. The freezing of organic matter in these aerosols promotes the formation of clouds in warmer and drier environments than where they would otherwise form, especially at high latitudes such as the North Atlantic Ocean. Organic matter in these aerosols help nucleation of water droplets at these regions, yet plenty of unknowns remain, such as what fraction contain ice-freezing organic materials, and from what biological sources. Nevertheless, the role of phytoplankton blooms as a source of enhanced ice nucleating particles has been confirmed in laboratory experiments, implying the important role of these aerosols in cloud radiative forcing. Primary marine aerosols created through bubble-bursting emission have been measured in the North Atlantic during spring 2008 by the International Chemistry Experiment in the Arctic Lower Troposphere (ICEALOT). This research cruise measured clean, or background, areas and found them to be mostly composed of primary marine aerosols containing hydroxyl (58% ¬±13) and alkene (21% ¬±9) functional groups, indicating the importance of chemical compounds in the air with biological origin. Nonetheless, the small temporal scale of these measurements, plus the inability to determine the exact source of these particles, justifies the scientific need for a better understanding of aerosols over this region.  Bioaerosols  Bioaerosols are particles composed of living and non-living components released from terrestrial and marine ecosystems into the atmosphere. These can be forest, grasslands, agricultural crops, or even marine primary producers, such as phytoplankton. Primary biological aerosol particles (PBAPs) contain a range of biologic materials, including bacteria, archaea, algae, and fungi, and have been estimated to comprise as much as 25% of global total aerosol mass. Dispersal of these PBAPs occur via direct emission into the atmosphere through fungi spores, pollen, viruses, and biological fragments. Ambient concentrations and sizes of these particles vary by location and seasonality, but of relevance to NAAMES are the transient sizes of fungi spores (0.05 to 0.15 Œºm in diameter) and larger sizes (0.1 to 4 Œºm) for bacteria. Marine organic aerosols (OA) have been estimated through their correlation to chlorophyll pigments to vary in magnitude between 2-100 Tg per year. However, recent studies of OA are correlated with DMS production and to a lesser extent chlorophyll, suggesting that organic material in sea salt aerosols are connected to biological activity in the sea's surface. The mechanisms contributing to marine organic aerosols thus remain unclear, and were a main focus of NAAMES. There is some evidence that marine bioaerosols containing cyanobacteria and microalgae may be harmful to human health. Phytoplankton can absorb and accumulate a variety of toxic substances, such as methylmercury, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Cyanobacteria are known to produce toxins that can be aerosolized, which when inhaled by humans can affect the nervous and liver systems. For example, Caller et al. (2009) suggested that bioaerosls from cyanobacteria blooms could play a role in high incidences of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). In addition, a group of toxic compounds called microcystins are produced by some cyanobacteria in the genera Microcystis, Synechococcus, and Anabaena. These microcystins have been found in aerosols by a number of investigators, and such aerosols have been implicated as causing isolated cases of pneumonia, gastroenteritis, and non- alcoholic fatty liver disease. Dinoflagellates are also thought to be involved in bioaerosol toxicity, with the genus Ostreopsis causing symptoms such as dyspnea, fever, rhinorrhea, and cough. Importantly, marine toxic aerosols have been found as far as 4 km inland, but investigators recommend additional studies that trace the fate of bioaerosols further inland. The fungi phylum of Ascomycota has been understood as the major contributor (72% in relative proportion to other phyla) to marine bioaerosols, at least in the Southern Ocean. Of these, Agaricomycetes constitutes the majority (95%) of fungi classes inside this phylum. Within this group, the Penicillium genus is most frequently detected in marine fungi aerosols. Fungi bioaerosols can also serve as ice nuclei, and therefore also impact the radiative budget in remote ocean regions, such as the North Atlantic Ocean. In addition to sea-spray aerosols (see section above), biogenic aerosols produced by phytoplankton are also important source of small (typically 0.2 Œºm) cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) particles suspended in the atmosphere. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), forecasted an increase in global surface ocean temperatures by +1.3 to +2.8 degrees Celsius over the next century, which will cause spatial and seasonal shifts in North Atlantic phytoplankton blooms. Changes in community dynamics will greatly affect the bioaerosols available for cloud condensation nuclei. Therefore, cloud formation in the North Atlantic is sensitive to bioaerosol availability, particle size, and chemical composition. = Marine Bioaerosols and Global Radiation Balance = Marine aerosols contribute significantly to global aerosols. Traditionally, biogeochemical cycling and climate modeling have focused on sea-salt aerosols, with less attention on biogenically-derived aerosol particles such as sulfates and related chemical species emitted from phytoplankton. For example, in the eastern North Atlantic during the spring 2002 bloom, high phytoplankton activity was marked more by organic carbon (both soluble and insoluble species) than by sea-salts. The organic fraction from phytoplankton contributed as much as 63% of the aerosol mass in the atmosphere, while during winter periods of low biological activity it only accounted for 15% of the aerosol mass. Those data provided early empirical evidence of this emission phenomena, while also showing that organic matter from ocean biota can enhance cloud droplet concentrations by as much as 100%. alt=  Data to test the CLAW Hypothesis  There is growing evidence describing how oceanic phytoplankton affect cloud albedo and climate through the biogeochemical cycle of sulfur, as originally proposed in the late 1980s. The CLAW hypothesis conceptualizes and tries to quantify the mechanisms by which phytoplankton can alter global cloud cover and provide planetary-scale radiation balance or homeostasis regulation. As solar irradiance drives primary production in the upper layers of the ocean, aerosols are released into the planetary boundary layer. A percentage of these aerosols are assimilated into clouds, which then can generate a negative feedback loop by reflecting solar radiation. The ecosystem-based hypothesis of phytoplankton bloom cycles (explored by NAAMES) suggests that a warming ocean would lead to a decrease in phytoplankton productivity. Decreased phytoplankton would cause a decrease in aerosol availability, which may lead to fewer clouds. This would result in a positive feedback loop, where warmer oceans lead to fewer clouds, which allows for more warming. One of the key components of the CLAW hypothesis is the emission of dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) by phytoplankton. Another chemical compound, dimethyl sulfide (DMS), has been identified as a major volatile sulfur compound in most oceans. DMS concentrations in the world's seawater have been estimated to be, on average, on the order of 102.4 nanograms per liter (ng/L). Regional values of the North Atlantic are roughly 66.8 ng/L. These regional values vary seasonally and are influenced by the effects of continental aerosols. Nonetheless, DMS is one of the dominant sources of biogenic volatile sulfur compounds in the marine atmosphere. Since its conceptualization, several research studies have found empirical and circumstantial evidence supporting the CLAW hypothesis in mid-latitudes of the Atlantic Ocean. The NAAMES campaign sought to provide an empirical understanding of the effects of marine bioaerosols on cloud formation and global radiation balance by quantifying the mechanisms underlying the CLAW hypothesis.  Emissions from the sea surface micro-layer  Dissolved organic compounds containing remnants of polysaccharides, proteins, lipids, and other biological components are released by phytoplankton and bacteria. They are concentrated into nano- sized gels on the surface of the oceans. Specifically, such compounds are concentrated in the sea surface micro-layer (SML), the uppermost film of water in the ocean. The SML is considered a \\"skin\\" within the top 1 millimeter of water where the exchange of matter and energy occurs between the sea and atmosphere. The biological, chemical, and physical processes occurring here may be some of the most important anywhere on Earth, and this thin layer experiences the first exposure to climatic changes such as heat, trace gases, winds, precipitation, and also wastes such as nanomaterials and plastics. The SML also has important roles in air-sea gas exchange and the production of primary organic aerosols. A study using water samples and ambient conditions from the North Atlantic Ocean found that a polysaccharide-containing exopolymer and a protein are easily aerosolized in surface ocean waters, and scientists were able to quantify the amount and size resolution of the primary sea to air transport of biogenic material. These materials are small enough (0.2Œºm) to be largely emitted from phytoplankton and other microorganisms. However, predicting aerosol quantity, size distribution, and composition through water samples are currently problematic. Investigators suggest that future measurements focus on comparing fluorescence detection techniques that are able to detect proteins in aerosols. NAAMES filled this research gap by providing a fluorescent-based instrument (See section on Atmospheric Instruments below), both in the air column and near the sea's surface. = NAAMES Objectives = * Identify the different features of the annual cycle of phytoplankton blooms in the North Atlantic and determine the different physical processes affecting those features. To accomplish this objective, a combination of ship-based, airborne, and remote sensing measurements was used. NAAMES conducted multiple campaigns that occurred during the various phases of the cycle in order to capture the important transitory features of the annual bloom for a comprehensive view. * Understand how the different features of the North Atlantic annual phytoplankton cycle interact to ‚Äúset the stage‚Äù for annual blooms. This objective seeks to reconcile the competing resource-based and ecosystem-based hypotheses. NAAMES goal was to provide the mechanistic field studies necessary to understand a more holistic view of the annual bloom cycle. * Determine how the different features of the annual phytoplankton cycle affect marine aerosols and cloud formation. The effects of aerosols on clouds is an understudied topic despite the major implications it could have for predicting future climate change. This objective addressed this gap by using combined measurement methods to understand the contribution of various aerosols to cloud formation produced during each major phase of the annual phytoplankton cycle.  Methodology  =Field Campaigns= Schematic of the diverse sampling strategies for NAAMES research campaigns, including satellite sensors, vessel measurements and deployments and aircraft remote sensing. It also depicts key processes, such as phytoplankton booms and aerosol emission and dispersion. Four field campaigns were conducted to target the four specific changes during the annual plankton cycle. The four NAAMES field campaigns synchronized data collections from the ship, air, and satellites, and were strategically timed to capture the four unique phases of plankton blooms in the North Atlantic: winter transition, accumulation phase, climax transition, and depletion phase. Campaign 1: Winter Transition sampling completed November 5-December 2, 2015 Campaign 2: Climax Transition sampling completed May 11-June 5, 2016 Campaign 3: Declining Phase sampling completed August 30-September 24, 2017 Campaign 4: Accumulation Phase sampling completed March 20-April 13, 2018alt= = Sampling =  Research cruises on the R/V Atlantis  Ship-based instruments measured gases, particles, and volatile organic compounds above the ocean surface. Water samples were also collected to describe the plankton community composition, rates of productivity and respiration, and physiologic stress. All four campaigns followed a similar ship and flight plan. The R/V Atlantis departed from Woods Hole, Massachusetts, to embark on 26-day cruises covering 4700 nautical miles. The ship first sailed to 40\\\\circW. It then moved due north from 40\\\\circN to 55\\\\circN latitude along the 40\\\\circW longitude parallel. This intensive south- north transect involved multiple stationary measurements. The ship then returned to port in Woods Hole. Underway sampling (i.e., while the ship was moving) occurred along the entire cruise using the ship‚Äôs flow-through seawater analysis system. Then, once it reached the beginning of the triangular transect area, the ship stopped twice a day at dawn and noon for stationary measurements to collect water samples for incubation (e.g. respiration), and perform water-column sampling and optical measurements. Scientists also used autonomous ARGO floats at three locations during each cruise. These autonomous floating instruments measured parameters such as chlorophyll (a measure of phytoplankton abundance), light intensity, temperature, water density, and suspended particulates. A total of 12 autonomous instruments were deployed during the four cruises.  Airborne sampling  Airplane-based measurements were designed to run at precisely the same time as the research vessel cruises so that scientists could link ocean-level processes with those in the lower atmosphere. Satellite data were also synthesized to create a more complete understanding of plankton and aerosol dynamics, and their potential impact on climate and ecosystems. Airborne sampling involved a C-130 equipped with sensitive scientific instruments. The flight crew based at St. John‚Äôs, Canada, conducted 10-hour flights in a ‚ÄúZ-pattern‚Äù above the study area. Flights took place at both high-altitudes and low-altitudes to measure aerosol heights and aerosol/ecosystem spatial features. High-altitude flights collected data on above-cloud aerosols and atmospheric measurements of background aerosols in the troposphere. Once above the ship, the airplane underwent spiral descents to low-altitude to acquire data on the vertical structure of aerosols. These low-altitude flights sampled aerosols within the marine boundary layer. Cloud sampling measured in-cloud droplet number, density, and size measurements.  Satellite Observations  Satellite measurements were used in near real-time to help guide ship movement and flight planning. Measurements included sea surface height, sea surface temperature, ocean color, winds, and clouds. Satellite data also provided mean surface chlorophyll concentrations via NASA‚Äôs Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), as a proxy for primary productivity. Autonomous ARGO Floats Autonomous in-situ instruments called Argo floats were deployed to collect physical properties and bio-optical measurements. Argo floats are a battery-powered instrument that uses hydraulics to control its buoyancy to descend-and-ascend in the water. The Argo floats collect both the biological and physical properties of the ocean. The data collected from the floats are transmitted remotely via the ARGOS satellite.  Atmospheric Instruments  Instruments used to characterize processes in the atmosphere can be divided into those that measure gas composition, and those that measure the composition of optical properties. Generally, aerosol sampling instruments are categorized by their ability to measure optical, physical, or chemical properties. Physical properties include parameters such as the particle diameter and shape. Two commonly measured optical parameters are absorption and scattering of light by aerosol particles. The absorption and scattering coefficients depend on aerosol quantity.286x286pxTotal light scattering by aerosol particles can be measured with a nephelometer. In contrast, aerosol light absorption can be measured using several types of instruments, such as the Particle Soot/Absorption Photometer (PSAP) and the Continuous Light Absorption Photometer (CLAP). In both of these instruments, particles are collected on a filter and light transmission through the filter is monitored continuously. This method is based on the integrating plate technique, in which the change in optical transmission of a filter caused by particle deposition is related to the light absorption coefficient of the deposited particles using Beer- Lambert's Law. One of the instruments used to characterize the amount and composition of bioaerosols was the Wideband Integrated Bioaerosol Sensors (WIBS). This instrument uses ultraviolet light-induced fluorescence (UV-LIF) to detect the fluorescence signals from common amino acids like tryptophan and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH). A lamp flashing the gas xenon is able to detect particle‚Äôs size and shape using high precision ultraviolet wavebands (280nm and 370nm).  Scientific Findings  = Results = Some results stemming from NAAMES research include scientific articles on aerosols and cloud condensation nuclei, phytoplankton annual cycles, phytoplankton physiology, and mesoscale biology. There have also been publications on improved methodologies including new remote sensing algorithms and advances in satellite remote sensing.  Phytoplankton annual cycles  Seasonal changes in phytoplankton biomass are controlled by predator-prey interactions and changes in mixed layer conditions such as temperature, light, and nutrients. Understanding the relative importance of these various factors at different stages of the seasonal cycle allows for better predictions of future ocean changes. One publication from NAAMES found the winter mixed layer depth to be positively correlated with spring chlorophyll concentrations in the Labrador Sea. Losses through sinking during the winter were compensated by net growth of phytoplankton, and this net wintertime growth was most likely a function of reduced grazing due to dilution.  Phytoplankton physiology  Understanding taxonomic differences in photoacclimation and general phytoplankton community photoacclimation strategies is important for constructing models that rely on light as a major factor controlling bloom dynamics. Furthermore, a better understanding of phytoplankton light-driven physiology can assist with better readings of satellite data on chlorophyll concentrations and sea surface temperature. A NAAMES study determined the photoacclimation responses of multiple taxonomic groups during a 4-day storm event that caused deep mixing and re-stratification in the subarctic Atlantic ocean. There were significant differences in photoacclimation and biomass accumulation at various depths of light intensity during the storm event.  Mesoscale biology  One of the most recent results of the NAAMES campaign includes a better understanding of how biology helps draw atmospheric carbon dioxide down into the water column. Specifically, the impact of zooplankton vertical migration on carbon export to the deep sea via the Biological Pump was parametrized and modeled for the first time.  Aerosols and cloud condensation nuclei  Illustration of sources of aerosols found during NAAMES cruisesA clear seasonal difference in the quantity of biogenic sulfate aerosols was discovered in the North Atlantic as a result of the NAAMES campaign. These aerosols were traced to two different biogenic origins, both of them marine due to the lack of continental air mass influences during the study period. The biogenic origin was the production of dimethyl sulfide (DMS) by phytoplankton, which then act as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) and affect cloud formation. This study classified the sulfates as \\"New Sulfate\\", formed by nucleation in the atmosphere; and \\"Added Sulfate\\", which were existing aerosols in the atmosphere where sulfate was incorporated. During the November 2015 cruise (Campaign 1), primary sea salt was the main mechanism (55%) for CCN budget. However, during the spring bloom in May‚ÄìJune 2016 (Campaign 2) Added Sulfate accounted for 32% of CCN while sea-salt accounted for 4%. These empirical measurements by seasonality will help improve the accuracy of climate models that simulate warming or cooling effects of marine bioaerosols.  Improved measurement methodologies  NAAMES scientists developed several novel measurement techniques during the project. For example, sorting flow cytometry combined with bioluminescent detection of ATP and NADH provides relatively precise determination of phytoplankton net primary productivity, growth rate, and biomass. Both laboratory and field tests validated this approach, which does not require traditional carbon-14 isotope incubation techniques. Other NAAMES investigators employed new techniques to measure particle size distribution, which is an important metric of biogeochemistry and ecosystem dynamics. By coupling a submersible laser diffraction particle sizer with a continuously flowing seawater system, scientists were able to accurately measure particle size distribution just as well as more established (but more time- and effort-intensive) methods such as Coulter counter and flow-cytobot. In addition to new oceanographic techniques, the NAAMES team also developed a novel method of collecting cloud water. An aircraft-mounted probe used inertial separation to collect cloud droplets from the atmosphere. Their axial cyclone technique was reported to collect cloud water at a rate of 4.5 ml per minute, which was stored and later analyzed in the lab.  New remote sensing algorithms  Advances in remote sensing algorithms were also developed during the NAAMES expeditions. Zhang et al. provided atmospheric corrections for the hyperspectral geostationary coastal and air pollution events airborne simulator (GCAS) instrument using both vicarious and cloud shadow approaches. Other scientists tested new approaches to measuring cloud droplet size, and found that using a research scanning polarimeter correlated well with direct cloud droplet probe measurements and high-spectral resolution LIDAR. Their findings suggest that polarimetric droplet size retrieval may be an accurate and useful tool to measure global cloud droplet size.  Advances in satellite LIDAR ocean remote sensing  The NAAMES team made advances in the use of LIDAR in oceanography. For example, Behrenfeld et al. (2017) showed that space-based LIDAR could capture annual cycles of phytoplankton dynamics in regions poleward of 45\\\\circ latitude. Using these new techniques, they found that Antarctic phytoplankton biomass mainly changes due to ice cover, while in the arctic the changes in phytoplankton are driven mainly by ecological processes. In another paper, the team described new advances in satellite LIDAR techniques, and argued that a new era of space- based LIDAR has the potential to revolutionize oceanographic remote sensing.  Future Implications  NAAMES provided groundbreaking data on aerosols and their relationship to numerous ecosystems and oceanographic parameters. Their discoveries and methodologic innovations can be employed by modelers to determine how future oceanic ecosystem changes could affect climate. = NAAMES Data = Finalized versions of field data can be viewed through NASA‚Äôs Distributed Active Archive Centers (DAACs).

It was first published in a satirical magazine Szpilki in 1973Pawe≈Ç Kozio≈Ç, \\"\\"Dzienniki gwiazdowe\\" Stanis≈Çawa Lema\\", culture.pl, May 17, 2011 and later republished in several collections and anthologies.

The \\"frame story\\" starts with the author (Ijon Tichy) complaining that he has to cut his memoir in clay tablets, the way Babylonians did. This unfortunate situation resulted from the world ignoring the warning of professor Do≈Ñda (whose sidekick was Ijon Tichy), who established that information has a kind of \\"critical mass\\", and when it is exceeded, similar to uranium, a destructive chain reaction may happen.\\"Profesor Do≈Ñda\\", wyborcza.pl August 30, 2011 Tichy then proceeds to tell the story of the professor. Wojciech Orli≈Ñski writes that professor Affidavid Do≈Ñda is one of the most sympathetic geniuses of Lem. His whole life, literally from his very conception including his first and last names, was a chain of errors and coincidences, which had eventually led to his discovery and the ignored prediction of the catastrophe.Wojciech Orli≈Ñski, Co to sƒÖ sepulki? Wszystko o Lemie [What are Sepulki? Everything about Lem], 2007, , p. 62 His hilarious exploits in the fictional African country of Gurundiwaju is an acute satirical allegory of Polish People's Republic of 1970s.Orli≈Ñski, p. 109 Do≈Ñda's Law The doomsday conclusion was derived from the following \\"Do≈Ñda's Law\\": > \\"Whatever a small computer with a large program can do, a big computer with > a small program can do the same; hence the logical conclusion is that an > infinitely large program can work alone, i.e. without any computer\\".\\"W > polskich firmach blogujƒÖ\\", Computerworld, Polish edition, June 2, 2009 Do≈Ñda further explains his reasoning: \\"Well, what does it mean that infinitely much information can work directly, without the help of any devices? This means that the enormity of information will manifest itself directly. I figured it out, but I didn't know the formula of equivalence [similar to the mass‚Äìenergy equivalence ]. ... Simply, how much information weighs. So I had to devise this whole project. I had to. Now I know. The machine became 0.01 grams heavier: that is the weight of the information entered.\\" Commentary in his afterword to Dzienniki gwiazdowe writes that the story of professor Do≈Ñda is not only a \\"comedy of errors\\" but also an illustration of Lem's idea that the chance is a driving force of the change, Jerzy Jarzƒôbski, \\"Sp√≥r Miƒôdzy Munchhausenem A Guliwerem\\" an afterword to Dzienniki gwiazdowe expounded by Lem in his essay The Philosophy of Chance. In the words of Donda, the whole evolution \\"is based on the error, because an error imprints onto an error, turns out to be an error, creates an error, so that chance [losowo≈õƒá in the original] turns into the Fate of the World [Los ≈öwiata]\\". The catastrophic finale of the novel resembles that of another adventure of Ijon Tichy: Peace on Earth ends with a silent devastation of the whole Earth's technological infrastructure and information stored in it. Jerzy Jarzƒôbski observes that it also resembles the finales of other Lem's novels: The Invincible, and Memoirs Found in a Bathtub.\\"KALLOTOMIA PLANETARNA\\" [Planetary Callotomy], an afterword by References Category:Novels by Stanis≈Çaw Lem Category:1986 science fiction novels Category:Apocalyptic novels Category:Mad scientists of Stanis≈Çaw Lem ","title":"Professor A.

Born in , Jochade was the oldest of twelve siblings, and moved around as his father found work in railway construction. From 1888, the family lived in L√ºneburg. Jochade began working for his uncle, building new railway lines, then in 1891 worked in the local iron foundry, and while there joined the Social Democratic Party of Germany. In 1895, Jochade joined the military, and proved successful despite being denounced for his socialist politics. He left to work in an iron foundry in Kiel, but was fired in 1899 for participating in a strike. He travelled to find work, and for the first time won office in his union. In 1901, it merged to become part of the German Metal Workers' Union, and Jochade lost his position. Instead, he found work editing the journal of the German Railwaymen's Association, regularly facing fines and imprisonment for his writing. The following year, he became the chair of the small union, and led it into the International Transport Workers' Federation (ITF). The leadership of the ITF was attracting criticism in the early 1900s, in contrast with Jochade's reputation as a well-organised, moderate but fearless leader. In October 1904, he was elected as the part-time general secretary of the federation, immediately drafting a new constitution, launching a journal, and made contact with unions which had left the federation, and by 1913, affiliated membership reached 700,000. Jochade supported German participation in World War I, and in 1915 was drafted into the army, serving on the Western Front. After the war, he returned to trade unionism, and served on the council of the ITF, though no longer as secretary. He also served on the executive of the German Transport Workers' Federation, and headed its literature department, but resigned in 1933, due to his steadfast opposition to the Nazis.

Life Cope was born on May 14, 1906 in Salt Lake City. He was trained by Utahn artists LeConte Stewart and Lawrence Squires, and at the Acad√©mie Julian in Paris, France in 1928. He also studied singing at the Op√©ra-Comique. Cope taught art at Latter-day Saints University, and he served as the chair of its Department of Art in 1930‚Äì1931. He taught at the Mountain School of Art from 1932 to 1938, and he was the director of the Art Barn School in Salt Lake City in 1939‚Äì1941. Cope painted Utahn landscapes as well as a portrait of Henry H. Blood, who served as the seventh governor of Utah from 1933 to 1941. Cope exhibited his work in the United States and Europe. According to the Deseret News, Cope \\"felt that music and painting are closely interrelated, and that the study of one form may be used to complement the appreciation and understanding of the other.\\" Cope died on June 10, 1999 in San Francisco, California.

Users can optionally run the guest Android VM as a rooted Android OS. The VMOS guest Android operating system has access to the Google Play Store and other Google apps. VMOS was the first virtual machine for Android to support Google Play services and other Google apps.  Virtualization  The app itself when downloaded is the base virtualization core, however the Android operating system image for the guest os is downloaded when the app is first opened up. Being that the guest operating system is in a virtualized environment, any configurations like a rooted android kernel on the guest, would not affect the host Android operating system or device. Due to this, via VMOS allows running a rooted Android operating system on the phone via virtualization without the device actually being rooted, and thus no issues with warranty or with the cellular carrier/provider. Being a virtual machine, the guest Android operating system has a separate disk image, and thus if a virus or other threat does something malicious in the guest operating system, it will not affect the host device and the host operating system. = Device requirements = Due to being a virtual machine app, the app does have requirements that the device must meet in order to run the app. One such requirement is that the phone must have at least more than 32GB storage. The app also requires at least 3GB of RAM. In order for the app to do virtualization and any optional user configured settings for the guest OS, the app requires multiple permissions. = VM guest OS settings = VMOS comes with many configuration settings for the guest os other than the rooted Android operating system option. Some of these options include choosing the display size resolution the guest would use, the ability to import/clone apps from the host operating system, allowing the use of phone calls, and many others.  Known uses  Although the VM app can be used for anything the user wishes to do, there have been some notable uses that have been known. Some major software developers suggest users to install VMOS to use their software on a device running Android operating system. One such known use is by app developers who create Android apps that are intended for rooted Android devices. Another use was the ability for users to multitask or utilize an app with two instances of it, as many Android apps can only have a single instance.  Huawei Mate 30  The Huawei Mate 30 was known to not be shipped with the official Google Play Store and related android system apps, due to Huawei being on the US blacklist. Huawei on the blacklist meant that it was not allowed to use any US hardware or software. However, the unofficial Google Play App that was developed by a Chinese developer, enabled users of the device to download and install android apps. However, the unofficial Google Play App was eventually removed. However, many users have found ways to bring back the unofficial Google Play App, as well as port google apps to the device. With one of these ported android apps being VMOS, many reviewers and critiques of the device stated that VMOS was able to bring somewhat the Android operating system and the official Google Play apps to the device. Huawei's next phone which is the Nova 5T, will eventually have actual Google apps and an actual Android operating system.  Reception  The virtual machine app received a range of responses. However all gave a positive remark over the fact that it can virtualize an Android operating system. Some of the positives that it received was that it could be used by developers to test Android apps that were intended for rooted devices, thus removing the hassle that developers faced with rooting their own devices to test their own apps. Another positive that was given was that the app can not only just run in the background, but can also be run as a floating window. Thus the guest OS and host could be used simultaneously. One of the major pros was that if the app was ported to a non-Android device like Huawei Mate 30, the user would be able to use Google apps, Google Play Apps, as well as the Android operating system, via the ported VMOS app. VMOS also makes it possible to have multiple accounts on apps. Some of the negatives that were found were that, with all virtualized operating systems regardless of the platform that the host is on, it would never reach the same speed as the host. Another issue that was raised was the size that the app took on the phone. Another negative that was stated was that online or on guest file system videos will display at a lower resolution and frame rate.

Its Chinese title was initially ÊÑõÂúãÂ†± Aiguobao (‚ÄúPatriotic Newspaper‚Äù, 1902-1905), later Ë≠¶Êù±Êñ∞Â†± Jingdongxinbao (1905-1914), Âπ≥Â†± Pingbao (1917), Ê∞ëÂ†± Minbao (‚ÄúThe People‚Äù, 1919-1922). At the time of its establishment it was the only Chinese-language newspaper in Melbourne, and one of three in Australia (along with the Chinese- Australian Herald and the Tung Wah Times, both published in Sydney). From 1919 it was the official newspaper of the Kuomintang in Australia. It moved to Sydney in 1922, where it continued to publish until 1949. The first edition appeared on 5 February 1902. It appeared weekly, initially on Wednesdays but from February 1905 on Saturdays. It ceased publication on a few occasions, including in 1907, between 1915 and 1919, and between 1920 and 1922.  Editorship  The founding editor and owner was ÈÑ≠Á•ø Zheng Lu, also known as Thomas Chang Luke. Zheng had been editor of the Tung Wah Times between 1899 and 1901 but his republican views became a source of tension and he left to start his own newspaper. In 1905 Zheng sold the Chinese Times to Ruan Jianzhai. The paper closed temporarily in 1907 owing to financial difficulties. In 1908 it was revived by the Chinese Empire Reform Association as an organ for the republican movement, with Lew Goot-chee (Liu Dihuan) and later Wong Shee Ping (Wong Yue-kung) acting as editors. In 1919, the paper was transferred to the Melbourne branch of the Kuomintang. In 1922 the paper moved to Sydney, initially with Wong as editor. It continued to publish until the end of the Second World War.  Politics  The Chinese Times was critical of the Ch‚Äôing establishment, encouraged its readers to support reform, and according to historian Morag Loh ‚Äúby 1910 was openly republican‚Äù. From 1919 it was the official publication of the Kuomintang in Australia. It was frequently critical of the Tung Wah Times, which supported a constitutional monarchy. As well as encouraging its readers to support the republican cause back in China, the newspaper documented the discrimination faced by Chinese people living in Australia and the effects of the White Australia Policy, which had come into effect in 1901.  Publication of The Poison of Polygamy  In 1909 and 1910, the Chinese Times published, in serial form, The Poison of Polygamy by Wong Shee Ping, the first Chinese-language novel to be published in Australia and possibly in the West. A bilingual edition of the novel, reproducing the original Classical Chinese and an English translation by Ely Finch, was published by Sydney University Press in 2019.  Digitisation  The National Library of Australia and State Library of Victoria digitised the Chinese Times as part of the Chinese Heritage of Australian Federation project. The digitised copies span 1902 to 1922 and can be accessed via Trove.https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/title/705 There are few known remaining copies from after 1922, when the newspaper‚Äôs editorial office moved to Sydney.

Va. Code ¬ß 11‚Äì3‚Äì1A. Geography Washington District is located in the southeastern portion of Jackson County. To the north, it is bounded by Ravenswood District; to the west by Ripley District; to the south by District 4, formerly by Poca District, in Kanawha County; and to the east by District I and District III, formerly Harper, Curtis, and Reedy Districts, in Roane County.United States Geological Survey, Topographical Maps, West Virginia, Gay Quadrangle (ed. 1960, rev. 1987).United States Geological Survey, Topographical Maps, West Virginia, Kenna Quadrangle (eds. 1906, 1957, rev. 1975).United States Geological Survey, Topographical Maps, West Virginia, Kentuck Quadrangle (ed. 1957, rev. 1975).United States Geological Survey, Topographical Maps, West Virginia, Liverpool Quadrangle (ed. 1960, rev. 1975).

Most of the district consists of rolling hills, separated by creeks and low ridges.\\"Ripley and Washington Districts\\", in Hardesty's Biographical Atlas of Jackson County. =Streams= All of the principal streams in Washington District are tributaries of either Mill Creek, which flows through the center of Jackson County and empties into the Ohio River at Millwood in Union District, or the Middle Fork of the Pocatalico River, draining the southern part of the district. The only other streams are Whiteoak Creek, and other tributaries of the main branch of the Pocatalico River, along the southeastern boundary of the district. Mill Creek is formed from the confluence of Little Mill Creek and the Elk Fork in eastern Ripley District; both streams arise in western Roane County, and drain the northern part of Washington District as they flow westward. Little Mill Creek enters the district at its easternmost point, and is met by Buffalo Creek, also flowing westward out of Roane County, at the former village of Buffalo, half a mile west of the county line. Two miles to the west, Little Mill Creek is joined by Little Creek, flowing southwest out of western Roane County; its tributaries include the Poplar Fork and Mitchell Run. Half a mile further downstream is the village of Frozencamp, along the mouth of Big Run. In the hills north of Frozencamp, Big Run divides into Right and Left Forks, running from the northern end of the district; just above Frozencamp, Big Run is met by Board Run. Below the village of Frozencamp, Little Mill Creek is met by Frozencamp Creek, flowing northwest. Two miles above its mouth, Frozencamp Creek divides into Right and Left Forks, both flowing westward out of Roane County. Above the village of Louther, the Right Fork of Frozencamp is joined by McCrady Run. Two miles below Frozencamp is the village of Hereford, West Virginia, along the eastern boundary of the district. At Hereford, Joes Run flows out of the northwestern corner of Washington District and joins Little Mill Creek. Joes Run is met by Poverty Run a short distance above the village, then divides into Right and Left Forks a mile above Hereford. The Elk Fork of Mill Creek flows northwest out of the central portion of Washington District; its upper waters arise in western Roane County. Its Left Fork flows westward out of Roane County, and is joined by Wash Run, then turns southward below the village of Gay, before joining the main branch of the creek. The Elk Fork then continues westward, and is met by Billy Run, flowing northwest out of western Roane County, and Brush Run, coming from the south. As it winds northwest through the hills, the Elk Fork is met by Forked Run, Haw Run, Spruce Run, Claylick Run, and Rocklick Run. After curving around Horseshoe Bend, the creek is met by Welch Run, coming from the west; and just after the Elk Fork crosses into Ripley District, it is joined by Scale Run, flowing southwest out of Washington District. The third branch of Mill Creek in Washington District is the Tug Fork, formed by the confluence of the Bear Fork and Grasslick Creek in the center of the district. The Bear Fork arises in western Roane County, and winds northwest through Washington district, until it joins Grasslick Creek, flowing eastward out of Ripley District. As the Tug Fork, the creek continues in a northwesterly direction, until it enters Ripley District about two miles above its juncture with Mill Creek. In its upper course, the Bear Fork is met by Upper Big Run and Lower Big Run, flowing northeast, and the Beech Fork, flowing southwest out of Roane County. Just above Belgrove it is met by the Laurel Fork, coming from the southwest; half a mile above its mouth, the Laurel Fork divides into its Right Fork, curving westward around a hill, and its main branch, coming from the south; Boardtree Run is a tributary of the main branch. At Belgrove, Long Run extends into the hills east of the village; below Belgrove, the Bear Fork is joined by Laurel Run, coming from the northeast, and Straight Run, from the site of Aplin, to the north; Lower Run and Alumrock Run are tributaries of Laurel Run. The Bear Fork then meets with Grasslick Creek, all the major tributaries of which are in Ripley District, except for Wildcat Run and Little Wildcat Run. The Tug Fork meets with Richards Run above Staats Mills; at Staats Mills, the creek is met by Cranesnest Run; Gandees Run joins the creek below the village. Before leaving Washington District, the Tug Fork is joined by Grass Run and Little Grass Run; another, smaller creek also called Bear Fork; Boar Run, Fourmile Run, and Buffalolick Run. The southern portion of Washington District is drained by the Middle Fork of the Pocatalico River, initially flowing southwest from the district's eastern flank. Above the village of Fletcher, the Middle Fork is joined by Pleasant Run and several smaller streams. At Fletcher, it meets Mudlick Run, and continues southward until it meets the Laurel Fork, flowing out of the hills west of Kentuck, where its main branch is met by its Left Fork. Below the Laurel Fork, the river is met by Pigeonroost Run, then Second Creek, flowing from the northeast, and First Creek, from the east; Spruce Run is a tributary of Second Creek. The Middle Fork turns southwest below First Creek, and is met by Sugar Creek, flowing south along the western edge of the district; Johns Branch is a tributary of Sugar Creek. Below Sugar Creek, the river is joined by the Short Branch, Wolfpen Branch, Matthews Branch, and Rockheap Branch. The river continues to the southernmost point in the district, where it meets with the Left Fork of the Pocatalico along the Kanawha County line, continuing southward into Kanawha County, and joining the river's main branch. In the southeastern corner of Washington District is White Oak Run, which flows southeast out of Jackson County, crossing the northernmost point of Kanawha County, and entering Roane County, where it joins the main branch of the Pocatalico River. =Communities= There are no incorporated towns in Washington District, but there are a number of unincorporated communities, most of which are on the various branches of Mill Creek. Marshall, Frozencamp, and Hereford lie along the waters of Little Mill Creek, while Louther is on the Right Fork of Frozencamp Creek. The village of Gay is on the Left Fork of the Elk Fork. Belgrove is located on the Bear Fork, while Staats Mills and Skidmore are further down the Tug Fork; the former village of Aplin was on a ridge northeast of that creek. Several villages lie along the branches of the Middle Fork of the Pocatalico, in the southern part of the district. Fletcher is on the main branch, while Kentuck is on the Laurel Fork; Advent is on Second Creek; while Mount Tell and Romance lie along Sugar Creek. =Roads and transportation= The only highway in Washington District is U.S. Route 33, known locally as the Spencer Road, which crosses the district from west to east between Ripley and Spencer, in Roane County, following the course of Little Mill Creek. Other important routes include Gay Road, which travels along the course of the Elk Fork between U.S. 33 and the village of Gay, and Staats Mills Road, which runs along Southall Ridge to Staats Mills, then continues eastward through the district. History Until 1831, the land that would become Jackson County was part of Mason, Wood, and Kanawha Counties; most of Washington District was part of Mason County, except for the southernmost portion, which was in Kanawha County.Michael F. Doran, Atlas of County Boundary Changes in Virginia, 1634‚Äì1895, Iberian Publishing Company, Athens, Georgia (c. 1987). Prior to the civil war, most counties in Virginia were not subdivided into smaller units. Jackson County was one of forty-eight Virginia counties admitted to the Union as the state of West Virginia on June 20, 1863. On July 31 of that year, the West Virginia Legislature passed an act requiring the division of the counties into civil townships. Section five of the bill appointed George L. Kennedy, John Johnson, Robert R. Riley, Abraham Slaughter, and George Click to establish Jackson County's townships. Washington was one of the five original townships of Jackson County. The original purpose of the townships was to provide for local government, as well as local control over revenue and the newly-created system of free public schools. However, the rural nature of the state proved an impediment to participation in township government, and revenues fell far below expectations. In 1872, the townships were converted into magisterial districts, serving various administrative purposes, but having no governmental function.Otis K. Rice & Stephen W. Brown, West Virginia: A History, 2nd ed., University Press of Kentucky, Lexington (1993), p. 240. The names and boundaries of Jackson County's magisterial districts remained largely unchanged until the 1990s, when the county was redistricted in order to equalize the area and population of its magisterial districts as nearly as possible. Washington District was combined with the eastern portion of Ripley District, including the town of Ripley, to form the new Eastern Magisterial District. However, redistricting in a number of counties created confusion with land and tax records, so the legislature provided for the establishment of tax districts, following the lines of the historic magisterial districts, and serving all administrative functions other than the apportionment of county officials. As a result, Washington District remains an administrative unit of Jackson County, although it is no longer one of the magisterial districts.

Career =Playing= Large played his college hockey at Western Michigan for Bill Wilkinson. He played for years for the Broncos, serving as an alternate captain in his junior season. After being named team captain for his senior season, Brekke helped Western Michigan to a 24-win season, the third-highest win total in program history (as of 2019), and reach the NCAA Tournament for only the second time. After graduating with a degree in marketing Brekke embarked on a two-year professional career, splitting time between the AHL and ECHL affiliates of the Quebec Nordiques/Colorado Avalanche, the team that had drafted him in 1991. =Coaching= After a year off from hockey, Brekke signed on as the Director of Player Personnel and assistant coach for the Chicago Freeze, a junior team in the NAHL. After two years with the Freeze Brekke returned to the college ranks as an assistant at Cornell for Mike Schafer. In nine years Brekke helped the Big Red reach the NCAA Tournament 4 times, including the Frozen Four in 2003, and helped build one of the toughest defensive corps in college hockey history. Brekke was lured away from Ithaca in 2008 by Miami and the RedHawks promptly reach the Championship Game, falling in overtime to Boston University. After two years he was promoted to associate head coach and continued to serve in that capacity for another 8 seasons. In 2018, with the team stuck in the mire, Brekke and fellow assistant Nick Petraglia both agreed to part ways with the program. Brekke didn't remain jobless for long, accepting an offer from Clarkson to be an assistant under Casey Jones. In his only season with the Golden Knights Brekke helped Clarkson win its first conference tournament in over a decade. Less than two months after St. Lawrence fired Mark Morris the Saints announced Brent Brekke as the 15th head coach in program history.

It is an airmobile brigade of the Kazakh Airmobile Forces. They are trained in accordance with NATO and United Nations standards and are therefore authroized to wear blue helmets while on duty and during parades. The battalion was established on 31 January 2000 by decree of President Nursultan Nazarbayev and is responsible for conducting peacekeeping operations and humanitarian missions in foreign countries on behalf of the Republic of Kazakhstan. In 2015, the Law \\"On Peacekeeping of the Republic of Kazakhstan\\" was adopted by the Parliament of Kazakhstan, defining the tasks and competencies of the state in regulating the participation of the country's peacekeeping operations around the world.

In 2003, Nazarbayev sent close to 300 KAZBAT peacekeepers to Iraq during the early stages of the Iraq War, where its personnel took part in Demining operations. During this 5 year action as part of a NATO-led Multi- National Force ‚Äì Iraq, an explosion occurred when Kazakh sappers accompanied by a Ukrainian back-up team set off two rigged aerial bombs while attempting to unload them from the transport vehicles Compared to the 8 deaths from the Ukrainian 72nd Mechanized Brigade, the battalion suffered a sole fatality. Ukrainian President Kuchma ordered the immediate withdrawal of Ukrainian peacekeepers as a result, but the Kazakh unit remained until 2008. Soldiers of the battalion have also been sent on peacekeeping missions led by the United Nations, including those in Lebanon (as part of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon), Afghanistan, Haiti, Western Sahara, Cote d‚ÄôIvoire and Liberia. In the Lebanese contingent, a company of 120 personnel were part of the IndKazBat unit. The Ministry of Defence described the mission as one that \\"will help strengthen international security and demonstrates Kazakhstan‚Äôs position as a responsible member of the international community\\". It has also participated in many joint exercises with other peacekeeping units and military units, such as the Arizona Army National Guard. Since 2002, the unit has hosted the joint tactical peacekeeping exercise \\"Steppe Eagle\\" in Kazakhstan, during which it operates within a multinational force under a unified NATO-led command.KAZBATSteppe Eagle. The battalion annually sends at least a dozen soldiers to the United Kingdom to attend the British Armed Forces Training Establishment for Peace Support Operations in the region. In 2019, a film directed by Askar Uzabaev was released called The KAZBAT Soldiers, which depicted a border skirmish during a peacekeeping operation in Tajikistan during their civil war when 17 members of the battalion's predecessor unit were killed in fighting with Islamic rebels. The film was primarily aired on the Qazaqstan state media channel. Requirements All members of the battalion are fluent in English, as well as other languages, including Russian and French.

Prior to being elected in 2019, Mueller held positions within the administration of his predecessor Pete Buttigieg. Early life and career Mueller was born June 29, 1982 to Thomas and Sarah Mueller. He was raised in the River Park‚ÄìSunnymede neighborhood of South Bend. He lived on Hoover Avenue near Potawatomi Park. He was one of five children. His father, Thomas, was a professor of aerospace and mechanical engineering at the University of Notre Dame, and his mother, Sarah, was a teacher, homemaker and social service coordinator at the YWCA. =Education= Mueller attended elementary school at St. Anthony de Padua School and was classmates with Sean M. Haas, who later became his opponent in the 2019 mayoral general election. He was also classmates with Pete Buttigieg at St. Joseph High School, where Mueller graduated in 2000. In 2004, Mueller graduated with a bachelor's degree from the University of Notre Dame, triple majoring in mathematics, history, and philosophy. Mueller went on to study ocean sciences and engineering at the University of Delaware, where he bypassed the graduate program and earned his PhD in oceanography. =Professional career= Mueller worked at George Washington University‚Äôs Solar Institute in Washington, D.C., ultimately serving as its director. Mueller also worked in the office of Senator Maria Cantwell for four years, first as a John A. Knauss Legislative Fellow, and later as a policy advisor on energy and natural resources. =Work in the Buttigieg administration= In July 2015, Mueller returned to South Bend and became the chief of staff to mayor Pete Buttigieg. This opportunity came after the resignation of Buttigieg's previous chief of staff, Kathryn Roos. Among the projects he was involved in as chief of staff was the creation of South Bend's Department of Venues, Parks and Arts as well as its Department of Innovation and Technology. On April 24, 2017, Mueller stepped down as chief of staff to assume a new position, becoming the city's director of community investment. Mueller left his position in city government during his mayoral campaign to avoid ethics conflicts. 2019 mayoral campaign Mueller‚Äôs 2019 campaign logo On December 17, 2018, Buttigieg announced that he would not be seeking reelection to a third term. On January 22, 2019, Mueller announced his candidacy for mayor. This was Mueller's first bid for elected office. At the time he launched his campaign, Mueller lacked name recognition. Mueller's campaign closely tied him with Buttigieg, and promised to build upon the progress made during Buttigieg's tenure. He pledged to continue many of the policies and programs implemented by Buttigieg. His slogan was, \\"Keep South Bend Moving Forward.\\" Buttigieg endorsed Mueller in February. Mueller's campaign manager was Kacey Gergely. On May 7, Mueller won a crowded primary to capture the Democratic nomination. In the November 5 general election, Mueller defeated Republican nominee Sean M. Haas. Mayoralty =Transition= After being elected mayor, Mueller worked to fill positions on his staff. Mueller expressed a view as mayor-elect that, while South Bend had made tremendous progress under Buttigieg, it was not yet entirely \\"back\\" (i.e., revived), stating, ‚ÄúAfter decades of decline, we finally turned the corner, but we are not where we want to be as a community. There are a lot of people that haven‚Äôt experienced the growth yet.‚Äù This was in contrast with Buttigieg's farewell speech as mayor before the Common Council, in which Buttigieg had declared that, \\"South Bend is back\\". As mayor-elect, Mueller expressed his view that public safety would be his top priority upon becoming mayor. He declared that, in order to help the entirety of the South Bend community to experience growth, the city would need to address issues in its public safety system. He expressed an eagerness to see the pending results of a study being conducted by the national police consulting group 21st Century Policing (21CP) on the matter. He declared that he intended to discuss the results of the study, once it completed, with police leadership, as well as discussing the department policy regarding body cameras. Mueller also expressed his desire to create a working group consisting of people that have an interest in the relationship between South Bend's community and its police force. He expressed hope that such a working group could include community members and members of the Fraternal Order of Police. As mayor-elect, Mueller had supported Dawn Jones to remain as South Bend City Clerk. Jones had been temporarily serving as City Clerk since winning a Democratic party caucus vote in August to replace Kareemah Fowler, after Fowler had resigned as City Clerk in 2019 to become chief financial officer at South Bend Community School Corporation. However, Fowler had resigned as City Clerk too late to remove her name from the ballot for reelection in the 2019 general election, therefore creating a scenario in which Fowler was elected to another four-year term as City Clerk and a Democratic precinct caucus needed to be held to again appoint someone in her place. Jones, carrying Mueller's endorsement, along with the endorsement of South Bend Common Council president Tim Scott, defeated her challenger in the caucus, Jill LaFountain, the director of advancement for Girl Scouts of Northern Indiana Michigan. Mueller stated that Buttigieg had offered him much advice during the transition. =Tenure= Mueller assumed office on January 1, 2020 at noon. His ceremonial inauguration was held later that day at Century Center. He is the 33rd mayor of South Bend. Five new Common Council members were sworn-in along with Mueller. As a result of the 2019 Common Council election, the Common Council that took office alongside Mueller is the city's first majority-female Common Council. Additionally, Dawn Jones was sworn-in as City Clerk alongside Mueller. Mueller took office at a time when South Bend had been enjoying an increased national spotlight by virtue of Buttigieg's presidential candidacy. On January 6, Mueller announced several appointments. These included Kacey Gergely (his 2019 campaign manager) as his Chief of Staff, Jordan Gathers as Deputy Chief of Staff, and Shalon ‚ÄúShay‚Äù Davis as Director of Community Outreach. He also announced that he would retain a number of individuals from Buttigieg's administration in the same roles, including Aaron Perri as Executive Director of Venues, Parks and Arts, Chuck Bulot as Building Commissioner, Daniel Parker as City Controller, Denise Riedl as Chief of Innovation Office, Eric Horvath as Director of Public Works, Kyra Clark as Director of Human Resources, Scott Ruszkowski as Chief of Police, and Stephanie Steele as Corporation Counsel. On April 1, 2020, Mueller named Carl Buchanon as fire chief. Months into his tenure, the global COVID-19 pandemic began to impact the United States. On March 16, 2020, Mueller ordered the closing of city parks buildings, the suspension of the ability for residents to pay their water bills in-person, and the suspension of water service shutoffs for nonpayments (the latter step taken in an effort to receive the burden on individuals losing income due to the pandemic). On March 19, Mueller declared an emergency, which automatically issued a level 2 travel advisory (out of 3 levels) against all nonessential travel. In mid-April he announced that the city had leased a Motel 6 location in order to allow the homeless to have a location in which they could self-quarantine. In early April South Bend Regional Chamber of Commerce President and CEO Jeff Rea signed a memorandum of understanding with Mueller and all three St. Joseph County commissioners under which he would help lead the South Bend and St. Joseph County response to the coronavirus pandemic. In mid-April Mueller also announced that the city had pledged $600,000 for CDFI groups loaning capitals to small businesses not covered by federal grants. Political positions Mueller is critical of Donald Trump, declaring in his 2019 victory speech that, \\"Trumpism has no place in South Bend\\". Mueller believes that systemic racism is a problem that needs to be dealt with. He believes that it is present in South Bend, and that it is important to admit that. He does not believe that the admittance of the presence of systemic racism is about vilifying anyone, but rather, is about recognizing institutions and how they have historically and currently been discriminatory towards certain groups of people. Electoral history =2019= Personal life By the time of his mayoral run, Mueller was dating Kellye Mitros, an administrative assistant at Notre Dame Law School. It was announced by a spokesperson for Mueller that, in September 2020, Mueller married Mitros before a small number of friends and family in a small wedding ceremony officiated by Pete Buttigieg, which was held outdoors, socially distanced, with masks worn due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. This made Mueller the second South Bend mayor to get married while in office, after only Buttigieg himself.

However, the group did not have time to name or measure the two trees after measuring King Arthur. In 1993, Flint again mentioned the existence of an unnamed, roughly 25-foot (7.62 meter) diameter giant sequoia just upslope from King Arthur that he wasn't able to formally measure or name. In 2001, naturalists James Chelebda, Arthur P. Cowley, Lawrence L. Otter (son of Floyd L. Otter), and Michael Reed were able to locate, measure, and name Floyd Otter while surveying Garfield Grove for the National Park Service. Their measurements were later published in December 2012, along with a definitive list of the 30 largest known giant sequoias and their respective measurements.

Controversially, it declined to blame the British government and emphasized the natural, rather than man-made, causes of the famine. After Archibald Wavell arrived as Viceroy of India in October 1943, he encountered sustained demands from Indian politicians for an inquiry into the ongoing famine. Leopold Amery, secretary of state for India, worried that an inquiry would be \\"disastrous\\". If an inquiry had to be held, it should focus not on Indian financing of the war effort‚Äîwhich he believed was responsible for the famine‚Äîbut instead on the food supply and population growth to the exclusion of political considerations. The commission was finally appointed in 1944, chaired by Sir John Woodhead, a former civil servant and friend of Amery's who had previously led the Palestine Partition Commission. Other members included a representative each from the Hindu and Muslim communities, a nutrition expert, and Sir Manilal Nanavati, the former deputy governor of the Reserve Bank of India. The hearings were acrimonious and held in camera. Reportedly, the commission's members were ordered to destroy the transcripts of the proceedings following the publication of their report, but Nanavati declined to do so. The commission published its report in May 1945, absolving the British government of most of the blame for the deaths during the famine. According to the inquiry, shortage in the rice harvest was one of the main causes of the famine. It also found that the shortage only amounted to three weeks and that shortage had been more serious in 1941, a year in which there had been no famine. The report acknowledged some failures in British price controls and transportation efforts but reserved its most forceful finger-pointing for local politicians in the (largely Muslim) provincial Government of Bengal: As it stated, \\"...after considering all the circumstances, we cannot avoid the conclusion that it lay in the power of the Government of Bengal, by bold, resolute and well-conceived measures at the right time to have largely prevented the tragedy of the famine\\". For example, the position of the Famine Inquiry Commission with respect to charges that prioritised distribution aggravated the famine is that the Government of Bengal's lack of control over supplies was the more serious matter. American writer Madhusree Mukerjee questions the accuracy of some of the inquiry's figures, claiming that the final report altered the figures from some sources. The estimate of the number of deaths, at 1.5 million, is much lower than the commonly accepted estimates today. At the time, Indian nationalists were infuriated with the report and blamed Britain for the famine. According to developmental economics professor Siddiqur R. Osmani and Amrita Rangasami, the report was ‚Äúdesigned to exonerate the administration from any blame for the famines\\" by focusing on a FAD (food availability decline) explanation. Mukerjee writes that Bengali administrators exhibited a sophisticated understanding of famine, specifically the role of taxation and speculation in causing them, but the Famine Inquiry Commission ignored this aspect. In her opinion, the \\"Famine Commission‚Äôs best efforts were directed not towards explaining the famine, but towards obscuring the role played by His Majesty‚Äôs government in precipitating and aggravating\\" it. Cormac √ì Gr√°da refers to \\"the muted, kid-glove tone\\" of the report, stating that wartime circumstances led the commissioners to omit criticism of the British government for allegedly failing to send additional supplies. According to Benjamin Siegel, the commission reached correct and nuanced conclusions, but \\"the political imperatives of the day won out\\" in the final report. Economist Peter Bowbrick defends the report's accuracy, which he considers \\"excellent... [i]n spite of the deficiencies of their market analysis\\" and much superior to that of Amartya Sen's writing.

The film's sets were designed by the art director Umberto Turco. Synopsis After inheriting a small-town football club in Romagna from his long-estranged father, Vatican official Benito Fornaciari shows little interest despite the club being promoted shortly afterwards. However, after selling several top players provokes a riot in the town, he has a damascene conversion and begins to plough huge amounts of money in the club and hires a supposedly brilliant Peruvian coach. When he proves to be inept and the club loses several games at the start of the new season, Fornaciari himself takes over control of the team from the bench. This leads to a dramatic surge in form as the club win match after match, with Fornaciari rallying the fans in a populist manner. He takes this too far during a local derby, provoking a pitch invasion and major damage to a rival team's stadium. The ensuing trouble, including a fine and a points deduction, leads a rival consortium to try and oust Fornaciari as President. However, he counters by signing Omar S√≠vori for Borgorosso and is acclaimed by the supporters once more. The film ends with Fornaciari leading a convoy of the team and their supporters to an away game, in exactly the same style his father had done at the beginning. The film is known to the Italian public for the sheer amount of stereotypes that depict the Italian society of the 1970s. Examples of this include the fraud Italian-Peruvian manager, who puts on a fake South American accent to fool the president, and the overwhelming presence of the Catholic Church, represented by the priest who rushes the weekly mass to make sure he can attend the match.

His father was an active member of the Soci√©t√© royale d'arch√©ologie de Bruxelles and after retiring as a major, a professor of construction at the Acad√©mie Royale des Beaux-Arts in Brussels. Gisbert studied law at the Universit√© libre de Bruxelles from which he graduated in 1891 with the title of doctor of laws. He practised for a while as a lawyer at the Brussels bar. He gave up his legal career in 1893 to devote himself to art. Before leaving Brussels to seek a teaching position to fund his new career as an artist, he studied briefly at the Acad√©mie Royale des Beaux-Arts in Brussels. He found his first teaching position at the Institute Agricole in Gembloux. Here he worked from 1895 to 1900 as a teacher of drawing for pupils who studied engineering, chemistry and agriculture. Louvain On 16 April 1895, Gisbert Combaz married Marthe Verhas, a daughter of the prominent Realist painter Jan Verhas. From this union were born three children, the architect Jean Combaz born in 1896, Suzanne in 1897 and Denise in 1903.Paul Lombotte, Jan Verhas in: Biographie Nationale de Belgique, Volume 26, Brussels, √âtablissements Emile Bruylant, 1936-1958 pp. 637‚Äì638 From 1898 to 1940, he taught decorative arts at the √âcole des arts industriels et d√©coratifs (School of Industrial and Decorative Arts) of Ixelles. He was appointed professor of art history at the Universit√© Nouvelle (New University, later renamed 'Institut des Hautes √âtudes de Belgique' (Institute of High Studies of Belgium)) in 1905 where he replaced Paul Janson as member of the Steering Committee. On 1 October 1912 he was appointed professor of ornamental composition at the Acad√©mie Royale des Beaux-Arts of Brussels. One of his students was Ren√© Magritte. Among the rocks He was influenced by the work of the Belgian artistic and literary group known as Les XX, one of Europe's most prominent avant-garde circles and a catalyst for the development of Symbolism and Art Nouveau.Un esprit japonais. Gisbert Combaz, la c√©ramique d'Edo et la cr√©ation belge, 2016 Mus√©e royal de Mariemont Combaz exhibited with the group's successor, La Libre Esth√©tique starting from 1897 and designed many of the exhibition posters of the group. He also participated in group exhibitions of L‚ÄôEstampe, an artists' association founded at the end of 1906 in Brussels. It brought together graphic artists with the intention of promoting the print medium through exhibitions. Its members included Fernand Khnopff, Auguste Danse, Richard Heinz, Auguste Oleffe, Henry De Groux, Marie Danse, Louise Danse, Georges Lemmen, Richard Baseleer, Willy Finch, Victor Mignot, Gustave- Max Stevens en Henri Meunier. Combaz never did a solo show during his career, and only one brief article about his work was published during his lifetime. Orchids and an Emperor Moth From the late 19th century he gradually developed an interest in the art of the Far East, of which he became an avid scholar. Combaz was first introduced to Oriental art by the Belgian Indologist and scholar of Buddhist Studies Louis de La Vall√©e-Poussin. Louis de La Vall√©e- Poussin introduced him to the members of the Soci√©t√© Artistique de Paris who formed the elite of French Orientalism such as Sylvain L√©vi, Paul Pelliot, who were later joined by Hac-kin, Jeanine Auboyer and Ren√© Grousset. When in 1929 the Institut belge des hautes √©tudes chinoises ('Belgian Institute of Advanced Chinese Studies') was founded in Brussels, the founders asked Combaz for his collaboration. He published several of scholarly works in the Institute's publication M√©langes de l'Institut and gave lectures. Poster for the 1895 Expositions Peinture, Sculpture, Architecture, Arts Appliqu√©s at La Maison d‚Äôart, Brussels In 1934 he founded in Brussels the Belgian Society of Oriental Studies, of which he was the president. The stated aim of the Society was to overcome the shortcomings of official education in Orientalism. He also built a significant collection or Oriental artifacts including Chinese and Japanese ceramics. This inspired him to experimenting himself with artisanal pottery at home. The artist died in Brussels not long after the start of the Second World War. Work Gisbert Combaz was a versatile personality who combined a variety of artistic pursuits with scholarly studies and academic education. He is mainly known for poster design and postcards and was active as a lithographer, illustrator, furniture designers and potter. He was talented painter whose works show the inspiration of Maurice Denis who also directed him towards religious subjects. His paintings have a decorative character and a great tenderness of tone. He was one of the principal protagonists of the Art Nouveau movement in Belgium. He was a prolific designer of posters. At the end of the 19th century, the poster was a successful new medium that reflected the aspirations of the bourgeoisie. Aside from encouraging consumption, it evoked moments of pleasure and lightness that were part of the leisure and entertainment of the affluent and influential population. He designed many posters for exhibitions of the artist circle La Libre Esth√©tique. He developed a personal style which remains very recognizable. It is inspired by calligraphy and Japanese prints. The iconographic repertoire of Japanese artists such as Hokusai and Hiroshige were an inspiration for his compositions. The reference work was clearly theHokusai Manga, published in 1815 and composed of 15 volumes. From 1897 Combaz designs different posters for the annual exhibitions of the artistic group La Libre Esth√©tique. Characteristic of his posters is there use of a central theme, such as a boat, a tree, a peacock or an eagle. In addition, his posters are also characterized by a very bright color palette. Combaz mixes the Japanese print style with Art Nouveau elements such an arabesques. Through these posters Combaz gave the Art Nouveau a very powerful and modern form.Hadewych Hernalsteen, Brussel Bedrukt Affiches voor de tentoonstellingen van Brusselse kunstenaarsverenigingen 1880-1914, Masters thesis submitted to the Faculty of Arts and Philosophy, Department of Art, Music and Theater Sciences of the University of Ghent to obtain the degree of Masters, Supervisor: prof. Dr. M. Sterckx. Universiteit Gent Academy Year 2011-2012 Postcard representing the Element Air Combaz was very effective in transposing the Japanese wood block print style known as ukiyo-e to the medium of posters. In his Poster for the 1895 Expositions Peinture, Sculpture, Architecture, Arts Appliques at La Maison d‚Äôart, Brussels, Combaz succeeded like the Japanese masters to express the maximum with a minimum of resources. With the motif of the sailboat treated in a single flat color, his poster gains a great expressiveness equal to that of Japanese prints. Combaz wrote in the journal L'Art moderne that the quality of the Japanese landscapes is their chromatic unity: in each print there is a dominant palette which, by simplifying the impression, makes it strong and confers to these pictures a character of powerful homogeneity. These characteristics were clearly transposed by Combaz to his posters.Julie Bawin, Le japonisme en Belgique. L‚Äôaffiche Art nouveau et l‚Äôestampe ukiyo-e in: Bulletin de la Classe des Beaux-Arts, Acad√©mie Royale de Belgique, Volume XIV, 2003, pp 47-69 Combaz' work further shows the influence of contemporary movements such as cloisonnism and pointillism. His early lithographs are based on a few flat decorative shapes. He then developed towards a cloisonne style of patterned images - birds, figures, land and seascapes - enclosed by a thick dark line. After 1906 he blended cloisonnism and pointillism as shown in some gouaches of oversized flowers in particular of orchids.Vivien Raynor, Art Nouveau: A Recurring Theme, in: the New York Times, 8 March 1981, p. 20 Poster for the First International Congress of Lawyers in Brussels in August 1897 Combaz further designed book covers and postcards. Particularly well known are his postcards with designs of the four elements, scenes of the ocean and fishermen, expressions and proverbs. He further created a number of drawings that expressed the horror of the Belgians at the atrocities committed by the German occupiers during the First World War. One of his drawings called Louvain shows the terror of the citizens of Louvain at the burning down of their town by German soldiers on 25 August 1914. Combaz depicted in very graphic detail the horrified people fleeing the town with flames visible in the background of the drawing. He also tried his hand at sculpture and exhibited sculptures of a lion and a peacock at the Triannual Salon of Brussels in 1919. Publications In the 1930s, along with Ren√© Grousset, Henri Maspero and Paul Pelliot, he published a number of publications on oriental art. He wrote among other things, several articles for the Annals of the Brussels Archeological Society. =Selected publications= *Les S√©pultures imp√©riales de la Chine, Brussels, Vromant, 1907 *Les Palais imp√©riaux de la Chine, Brussels, Vro-mant, 1909 *Les Temples imp√©riaux de la Chine, Brussels, Vromant, 1912 *√âvolution du St√πpa en Asie, in: 'M√©langes chinois et bouddhiques', vol.

Often the absurd implication is that they have eaten each other. In the nineteenth century the Kilkenny cats were a common simile for any conflict likely to ruin both combatants. Kilkenny cat is also used more generally for a fierce fighter or quarrelsome person. These senses are now rather dated.; In the later twentieth century the motif was reclaimed by Kilkenny people as a positive symbol of tenacity and fighting spirit, and \\"the Cats\\" is the county nickname for the Kilkenny hurling team. The original story is attested from 1807 as a simple joke or Irish bull; some early versions are set elsewhere than Kilkenny. Nevertheless, theories have been offered seeking a historical basis for the story's setting. Versions of the story The earliest attested version of the story is from June 1807, in Anthologia, a collection of jokes and humorous pieces copied by \\"W.T.\\" of Inner Temple from unnamed previous publications.; Steven Connor characterises the story as an Irish bull. Under the heading \\"Kilkenny Cats\\" it runs: :In a company, consisting of naval officers, the discourse happened to turn on the ferocity of small animals; when an Irish gentleman present stated his opinion to be, that a Kilkenny cat, of all animals, was the most ferocious; and added, \\"I can prove my assertion, by a fact within my own knowledge:‚Äî I once,\\" said he, \\"saw two of these animals fighting in a timber yard, and willing to see the result of a long battle, I drove them into a deep sawpit, and placing some boards over the mouth, left them to their amusement. Next morning I went to see the conclusion of the fight, and what d'ye think I saw?\\"‚Äì \\"One of the cats dead, probably,\\" ‚Äîreplied one of the company.‚Äî \\"No by Ja‚Äîs! there was nothing left in the pit, but the two tails and a bit of flue!\\" The tale was repeated verbatim the next month in The European Magazine's review of Anthologia, as well as The Sporting Magazine, also in London, and Walker's Hibernian Magazine in Dublin. It reappeared in 1812 in Thomas Tegg's The Spirit of Irish Wit, and in the 1813 supplement to William Barker Daniel's Rural Sports. The following appears in Thomas Gilliland's The Trap, an 1808 satire on the theme of love:; quoted in :When I was last at Kilkenny, said Teague, I saw two big ram-cats fight a duel for love, your honour; and they fought, and fought, till they ate each other up. Devil burn me, if I lie, your honour! I went after them into the gutter! \\"Tommy!\\" says I, \\"my dear Phely!\\" says I, but no Tommy or Phely was there: I found only the tips of their tails. An 1811 joke book from Boston in the United States included: :On a gentleman's reading an account of a tiger fight in the East Indies, an Irishman present exclaimed: 'a tiger be hang'd! Why, sir, I once myself saw two Kilkenny cats fight till they devoured each other up, excepting the very tips of their two tails.' Another version is alluded to in an 1816 critique of a pamphlet by Andrew O'Callaghan, master of Kilkenny College: :There is a story told in Kilkenny, that several cats had been locked up in a room, for a fortnight together, without food, and, upon opening the door, there was nothing found but the tail of one of them. Surely Mr. O'C. must have been dreaming of this native story, when he made his arguments thus to swallow themselves, after destroying each other‚Äîbut the tail of one of them remains Responding to the 1816 critique, Rowley Lascelles, an English antiquarian based in Ireland, denied the existence of such a story, which he saw as a slur on Kilkenny. Although in 1835 John Neal called the story \\"one of the oldest and most undoubted Joe [Miller]s\\",; reprinted in the first edition of Joe Miller's Jests to include it was in 1836 (verbatim from Anthologia). Theodore Hook's 1837 novel Jack Brag jocularly sources the story to [Joe] Miller's History of Ireland. =Elsewhere than Kilkenny= An 1817 memoir of the Irish wit John Philpot Curran situates the story in Sligo rather than Kilkenny, as a tall tale told by Curran: :Passing his first summer at Cheltenham ... he had resort to a story to draw himself into notice. ... The conversation of the table turning altogether on the stupid, savage, and disgusting amusement of cock-fighting, he was determined to put an end to it, by the incredible story of the Sligo cats. ::At [a cat-fight meeting in Sligo] three matches were fought on the first day ... and before the third of them was finished (on which bets ran very high), dinner was announced in the inn where the battle was fought. The company agreed ... to lock up the room, leaving the key in trust to Mr. Curran, who protested to God, he never was so shocked, that his head hung heavy on his shoulders, and his heart was sunk within him, on entering with the company into the room, and finding that the cats had actually eaten each other up, save some little bits of tails which were scattered round the room. :The Irish part of the company saw the drift, ridicule, and impossibility of the narrative, and laughed immoderately, while the English part yawned and laughed, seeing others laugh, and sought relief in each other's countenances. In Real life in Ireland, an 1821 stage Irish novel by Pierce Egan, Captain Grammachree, a retired soldier, tells Brian Boru, a young country squire, of a cat-fight in the neighbourhood of Dublin: :'There was hundreds betted, but not a cross won or lost; for by Jasus! they left nothing on the ground but a bunch of hair and two tails!' :'What!' said Brian, 'then I suppose the cats ran away?' :'An Irish cat run away!' sneered Grammachree, 'no; never! by the powers of Moll Kelly! they eat one another up!' An 1830 \\"dialogue on Popery\\" by one Jacob Stanley summarises \\"the Travellers tale of the Irish Cat fight\\", giving no specific location. =The battle of the cats of Ireland= S. Redmond in 1864 in Notes and Queries recounted a tale told to him \\"more than thirty years\\" earlier when he was \\"very young\\" by \\"a Kilkenny gentleman\\", about a battle \\"some forty years before\\" [i.e. about 1790] on \\"a plain near that ancient city\\": :One night, in the summer time, all the cats in the city and county of Kilkenny, were absent from their \\"local habitations;\\" and next morning, the plain alluded to (I regret I have not the name) was found covered with thousands of slain tabbies; and the report was, that almost all the cats in Ireland had joined in the contest; as many of the slain had collars on their necks, which showed that they had collected from all quarters of the island. The cause of the quarrel, however, was not stated; but it seemed to have been a sort of provincial faction fight between the cats of Ulster and Leinster‚Äîprobably the quadrupeds took up the quarrels of their masters, as at that period there was very ill feeling between the people of both provinces. Although Redmond states \\"This has nothing to do with the story of the two famous Kilkenny cats\\", the two have occasionally been linked subsequently. A similar story was told in Charles Henry Ross' 1867 Book of Cats, to which Kilkenny antiquarian John G. A. Prim responded that he had heard such a story told of many places in Ireland, but not of Kilkenny. In 1863, Once A Week had a story of a similar battle in Yorkshire. Folklorist John O'Hanlon in 1898 published a version from John Kearns of Irishtown, Dublin which situated the battle on Scald Hill in Sandymount, the future site of Star of the Sea Catholic Church, witnessed by curate Father Corrigan. In the 1930s, the Irish Folklore Commission noted a seancha√≠ from Rossinver, County Leitrim tell of a cat battle in Locan Dhee near Kinlough on New Year's Day 1855. Use as a simile 'The Kilkenny Cats; or, Old and Young Ireland \\"coming to the scratch.\\"' (Punch, 1846) ‚Äî caricature of William Smith O'Brien and Daniel O'Connell. The story was sufficiently well known in the 19th century to be used frequently as a simile for \\"combatants who fight until they annihilate each other\\"; to \\"fight like [the] Kilkenny cats\\" means \\"to engage in a mutually destructive struggle\\". Early instances include: (from 1814) an account in Niles' Register of the loss of USS Wasp after sinking HMS Avon; (from 1816) the critique of Andrew O'Callaghan mentioned earlier; a letter from the 4th Duke of Buccleuch to Walter Scott comparing Lord Byron's poem \\"Darkness\\" to the story; and a riposte to disagreeing literary critics: :Indeed, so mortal is your reciprocal hostility, that your victims may, with Mercutio, form the reasonable expectation, that, being, 'two such, we shall have none shortly, for one will kill the other;' and like the celebrated Kilkenny cats, leave no other vestige to designate the tribe of ferae naturae to which you belong, than an odd tooth or a claw! A similar metaphor is Spanish defined in a 1740 dictionary as \\"to eat up one another; to be always quarrelling\\". One context for the simile was advocating isolationism, allowing one's enemies to defeat each other, or divide and conquer policy. A report in Niles' Register of Spanish church opposition to the 1817 tax reform of wished 'the fate of the \\"Kilkenny cats\\"' on \\"Ferdinand and his priests\\". Similarly Charles Napier in 1823 hoped \\"the French and Spaniards [would] war like Kilkenny cats\\"; likewise Figaro in London in 1832 urging British neutrality after the Ten Days' Campaign and Charles Darwin in 1833 in Buenos Aires during the Revolution of the Restorers. J. S. Pughe in a 1904 political cartoon in Puck depicted Japan and Russia as Kilkenny cats fighting the Russo-Japanese War in Manchuria. Similarly in 1941, after Germany invaded the Soviet Union, Clifford Berryman depicted Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin as \\"a modern version of the Kilkenny Cats\\". In The German Ideology, Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels accuse Bruno Bauer of fomenting antagonism between Max Stirner and Ludwig Feuerbach \\"as the two Kilkenny cats in Ireland\\". \\"About the Size of it\\" (Harper's Weekly, 1864) ‚Äî \\"Well, and what if it should come to a Kilkenny fight? I guess Our Cat has got the longest tail!\\" Conversely, the fable serves as a cautionary tale for the moral \\"united we stand, divided we fall\\". It was invoked in 1827, in The Lancet during disputes around the Royal College of Physicians; and in The Literary Gazette of the rivalry between Drury Lane and Covent Garden theatres. It was a common metaphor before and during the American Civil War, a conflict seen as likely to destroy both sides; especially when criticising the war of attrition strategy of Ulysses S. Grant. Some extended the metaphor to say the North would win as having the longest tail; this was popularly reported in 1864 as a quip by Grant, but George Gordon Meade made the same comparison in an 1861 letter to his wife. Some Mormons viewed the Civil War as fulfiling a prophecy by founder Joseph Smith, who said after an 1843 attempt to arrest him, \\"The constitution of the United States declares that the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall not be denied. Deny me the writ of habeas corpus, and I will fight with gun, sword, cannon, whirlwind, and thunder, until they are used up like the Kilkenny cats.\\" Donald Dewar, the First Minister of Scotland, in 1999 denied media talk of a rift with John Reid, the Scottish Secretary, conceding, \\"I must confess the casual outsider who simply read the headlines might think it was a collection of Kilkenny cats fighting\\". In the Supreme Court of India in December 2018, K. K. Venugopal, the Attorney General, justified the government's suspension of Alok Verma and Rakesh Asthana from the Central Bureau of Investigation by saying, \\"The government was watching with amazement the director and his deputy fight like Kilkenny cats.\\" Indian media explained the simile in their reports on the case. It was invoked in 1837 for political gridlock in divided legislatures: by Thomas Corwin in the 24th Congress, and by Thomas Carlyle in The French Revolution: A History. James Grant (1837, 1843) and S. Gerlis (2001) draw analogy with litigants who are both ruined by legal costs.; ; It was often used in accounts of factionalism within Irish nationalist politics, such as between the Repeal Association and Young Ireland in the 1840s,; Isaac Butt against Joseph Biggar in the 1870s, or the Parnell split of the 1890s. Francis Jacox invoked the Kilkenny cats in 1865 when enumerating \\"Certain Eligible Cases of Mutual Extermination\\" in Bentley's Miscellany. Prosper M√©rim√©e alluded to in 1860s correspondence, prompting a query to L'Interm√©diaire des chercheurs et curieux in 1904, the answer to which was prefaced, \\"Those of us who ever had an English governess will recall the 'Kilkenny Cats'.\\" In his diary in 1950, Ernest Bevin, the UK Foreign Secretary, described the UK's Cold-War security links to the US as being \\"tied to the tail of a Kilkenny cat\\". A single Kilkenny cat may be invoked to symbolise ferocity or vigour without the implication of mutual destruction. In an 1825 humorous verse, Anthony Bleecker inquiring into the cause of death of a peaceable cat asks, \\"Did some Kilkenny cat make thee a ghost?\\" John Galt in 1826 refers to \\"an enormous tiger almost as big as a Kilkenny cat\\". In an 1840 story by Edgar Allan Poe, \\"Sir Pathrick O'Grandison, Barronitt, of Connacht\\" says he was \\"mad as a Kilkenny cat\\" when a rival came to court his beloved. In George Lippard's 1843 satire of Philadelphia publishers, Irishman Phelix Phelligrim exclaims, when his associates are cursing and red-faced with anger, \\"Its in a fine humor ye are, gentleman! The Kilkenny cats was a mere circumstance to ye!\\" Leo Richard Ward in 1939 described someone as \\"contrary and mean as a Kilkenny cat.\\" In 2009, a Children's Court magistrate in Sydney described a schoolgirl arrested for fighting as a \\"Kilkenny cat\\". =Reclaimed= Irish counties have nicknames, some long established and in general use, others invented by sports journalists covering inter-county Gaelic games. The Kilkenny county team, which has won more All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championships than any other county, has been called \\"the Cats\\" in newspapers since at least the 1980s. ; ; ; ; ; In 2016 correspondence in the Irish Daily Mail, one reader said the nickname was not used for the GAA team in the 1960s, while another said it was used in the press since the 1920s and attracted wider currency with the introduction of televised coverage in the 1960s. In 1998 a man in Clark County, Washington changed his surname from \\"Kenny\\" to \\"Kilkenny\\", reversing a change his great-grandfather had made to avoid the fighting stereotype associated with the name \\"Kilkenny\\" in the United States. Origin theories The simplest theory for the story is that it is merely an Irish joke or Irish bull, and that the selection of Kilkenny as opposed to somewhere else in Ireland is arbitrary, perhaps favoured by the alliteration of the phrase \\"Kilkenny cats\\". John G.A. Prim in Notes and Queries in 1850 conceded that this was the most commonly accepted theory (\\"This ludicrous anecdote has, no doubt, been generally looked upon as an absurdity of the Joe Miller class\\"). La Belle Assembl√©e in 1823 credited Curran (for Kilkenny rather than Sligo). As regards the age of the story, Prim in 1868 wrote: :Thirty years ago I made inquiries amongst the \\"oldest inhabitants\\" of my acquaintance then living, and their unanimous testimony was, that the story of the Kilkenny cats was in vogue as long as they could remember, and the recollections of some of them extended to nearly half a century before [1798]. Rowley Lascelles claimed the 1816 version of the story was \\"taken from another, a well-known one, which is shortly this. Into a kennel of hounds, a dog of another species, did, one night, accidentally make its way. In the morning nothing was found of him but his tail.\\" In the Histoire Naturelle (1758), Buffon describes how twelve unfed captive field mice ate each other, the survivor having mutilated legs and tail.; Prim proposed that the cats were originally an allegory for continual jurisdictional disputes between the adjacent municipal corporations of Kilkenny (or Englishtown, or Hightown) and Irishtown (or Saint Canice, or Newcourt). Prim claimed that \\"mutual litigations, squabbles, assaults and batteries, with the accompanying imprisonments, fines and law costs\\", which brought both near to bankruptcy, lasted from 1377 to \\"the end of the seventeenth century\\". He claimed to have a paper on \\"the natural history of the Kilkenny cats\\" in preparation, and cited a Close Roll entry from the Irish Chancery for the 1377 date. (The entry notes that Alexander de Balscot, the bishop of Ossory and sovereign of Irishtown, objected to Kilkenny corporation levying octroi for murage on Irishtown market.Rot. Claus. 51 Ed. III. 78) Prim's paper about the cats story was not published, though in one of 1870 he states, \\"Soon after [1658] the municipal body of Kilkenny became involved in an expensive lawsuit with the neighbouring Corporation of Irishtown, concerning questions of privilege and superior authority within the latter borough\\"; while in 1857 he wrote that John Hartstonge, as bishop of Ossory from 1693, and his brother Standish, as Recorder of Kilkenny from 1694, were on opposing sides of the dispute. C. A. Ward suggested in 1891 that Prim's explanation is \\"simply a tale invented after the fable relating to the cats had got into circulation\\". Prim's theory was bolstered in 1943 by publication, in a calendar of Ormond papers, of a 1596 arbitration between the corporations over markets, merchants' guilds, and musters.; The New International Encyclopedia in 1903 claimed this allegory was a satire by Jonathan Swift, who attended Kilkenny College from 1673 to 1681. Henry Craik's 1894 biography suggests the alleged dispute between Englishtown and Irishtown was still in progress in Swift's time and was between Protestants and Catholics. In fact, Irishtown corporation was controlled by the Church of Ireland bishop of Ossory. Thomas D'Arcy McGee in 1853 claimed the origin is a metaphor for feuding, not between Englishtown and Irishtown, but in the Confederation of Kilkenny between supporters and opponents of Ormonde's first peace in 1646. D. M. R. Esson in 1971 gave Ormonde's second peace in 1648 as the source.; Detail from First stage of cruelty (Hogarth, 1751) depicting two cats tied and suspended by a rope to fight each other. Another theory was reported by \\"Juverna\\" in Notes and Queries in 1864, as having been heard \\"in Kilkenny, forty years ago, from a gentleman of unquestioned veracity\\". The story holds that a group of bored soldiers stationed in Kilkenny held fights between two cats tied together by their tails and suspended from a clothes line or crosspost. Their commander forbade the practice, but they carried on in secret. When the commander was heard approaching, a soldier hastily cut through the cats' tails, allowing them to escape. The commander asked about the hanging tail ends, and the soldier averred that the cats had eaten each other. In Juverna's version, the troops were Hessians after the Wexford Rebellion of 1798 or Emmet's Insurrection of 1803. A review in The Athenaeum of Ross' Book of Cats claims the soldiers were in the Williamite army of 1690. Prim agrees that the episode occurred with Hessians in 1798, but states that their sport was influenced by a story already proverbial. In other accounts, the soldiers were the regular garrison at Kilkenny Castle in Elizabethan times (1558‚Äì1603); or the Catholic Confederate army of the 1640s; or Cromwell's occupying force of the 1650s. John Baptist Crozier when Bishop of Ossory, Ferns and Leighlin endorsed the theory. Joseph O'Connor's 1951 memoir has Matt Purcell, a comrade of his father's in the 10th (North Lincoln) Regiment of Foot in the 1880s, claim the original Kilkenny cats were tied together by the Earl of Ormond's jester. A 1324 witchcraft case in Kilkenny saw Dame Alice Kyteler flee and her servant Petronilla de Meath burnt at the stake after admitting relations with a demon which variously took the form of a dog, a cat, and an Aethiopian. This cat has occasionally been linked to the Kilkenny cats story. In 1857, John Thomas Gilbert made passing reference to \\"the Kilkenny cat of Dame Alice\\". Austin Clarke's 1963 poem \\"Beyond the Pale\\" recounts the story of \\"Dame Kyttler\\", continuing: In 1986 Terence Sheehy suggested a link with the luchthigern, a beast mentioned in Brocc√°n Craibdech's poem in the \\"Book of Leinster\\" as having been slain by Midgna's wife at a place named Derc-Ferna. Luchthigern is usually interpreted as \\"mouse lord\\" and Derc-Ferna as Dunmore Cave near Kilkenny city. Sheehy follows Praeger and P.W. Joyce in regarding the luchthigern as a huge cat; in contrast to Brian O'Looney (\\"some sort of monster\\") Thomas O'Neill Russell (\\"Can this word mean a great mouse?\\") and Dobbs (\\"a demon or a giant\\"). A Dictionary of Celtic Mythology says that luchtigern was \\"Mouse-lord of Kilkenny, slain by a huge cat, Banghaisgidheach\\"; this is apparently a misreading of Joyce, who describes Midgna's (human) wife as a \\"female champion\\". In 1857, the editor of The Journal of the Kilkenny and South-East of Ireland Archaeological Society suggested that a heading \\"Grimalkin slain in Ireland\\" reported in a synopsis of the 1584 book Beware the Cat might be relevant; this was disproved by an 1868 reply in the successor journal explaining that the episode (a version of the folktale \\"The King of the Cats\\") is set in Bantry in County Wexford about \\"Patrik Agore\\", a kern of John Butler, son of Richard Butler, 1st Viscount Mountgarret, who sets out to kill Cahir mac Art Kavanagh.; Authorities which discuss various origin theories include Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable (the Prim and Juverna theories in early editions; the 19th edition follows Brewer's Dictionary of Irish Phrase and Fable in plumping for the Juverna theory); the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Eleventh Edition (Prim, Juverna and J. P. Curran); World Wide Words (Prim, Juverna, and Redmond's great battle); Charles Earle Funk (the same three, Prim's credited to Swift; \\"probably none of them is true\\"); Terence Dolan (Juverna); and Eric Partridge (Curran). Cashman and Gaffney's Irish Proverbs & Sayings recounts the Juverna theory as \\"probably just a tall tale\\". , the Oxford English Dictionary does not comment on any of the purported historical origins. =Folkloristics= Comparative mythology seeks to find parallels with folklore elsewhere. Angelo de Gubernatis wrote in 1872: :In a German belief noticed by , two cats that fight against each other are to a sick man an omen of approaching death. These two cats are probably another form of the children's game in Piedmont and Tuscany, called the game of souls, in which the devil and the angel come to dispute for the soul. Of the two cats, one is probably benignant and the other malignant; they represent perhaps night and twilight. An Irish legend tells us of a combat between cats, in which all the combatants perished, leaving only their tails upon the battlefield. (A similar tradition also exists in Piedmont, but is there, if I am not mistaken, referred to wolves.) Two cats that fight for a mouse, and allow it to escape, are also mentioned in Hindoo tradition. Moncure Daniel Conway built on this in 1879: :De Gubernatis has a very curious speculation concerning the origin of our familiar fable the Kilkenny Cats, which he traces to the German superstition which dreads the combat between cats as presaging death to one who witnesses it; and this belief he finds reflected in the Tuscan child‚Äôs ‚Äògame of souls,‚Äô in which the devil and angel are supposed to contend for the soul. The author thinks this may be one outcome of the contest between Night and Twilight in Mythology; but, if the connection can be traced, it would probably prove to be derived from the struggle between the two angels of Death, one variation of which is associated with the legend of the strife for the body of Moses. The Book of Enoch says that Gabriel was sent, before the Flood, to excite the man- devouring giants to destroy one another. In an ancient Persian picture in my possession, animal monsters are shown devouring each other, while their proffered victim, like Daniel, is unharmed. The idea is a natural one, and hardly requires comparative tracing. Carl Van Vechten in 1922 was sceptical: :Angelo de Gubernatis, too, is infected with this familiar and somewhat silly method of trying to explain all folk-stories symbolically. In \\"Zoological Mythology, or the Legends of Animals,\\" he gives it as his belief that the celebrated fable of the Kilkenny Cats may mean the mythological contest between night and twilight. God pity these men! \\"R.C.\\" in 1874 suggested a comparison with an epigram by Palladas from the Greek Anthology:; citing ; translation from :A son and father started a competitive contest as to which could eat up all the property by spending most, and after devouring absolutely all the money they have at last each other to eat up. Archer Taylor suggested the Kilkenny cats \\"may involve an old story with parallels in Icelandic saga\\"; in the Bandamanna saga, Ofeig says, \\"And with me it has fared after the fashion of wolves, who eat each other up until they come to the tail, not knowing till then what they are about\\". The cat with two tails, a stonemason's carving associated with the Gob√°n Saor in Irish folklore, is sometimes conflated with the Kilkenny cats. Steven Connor comments, \\"Because they involve bodily illogic ... in which a body is imagined as simultaneously present and absent, the cake both eaten and miraculously intact, the fact of death is often in play in Irish bulls\\". In the 1930s the Irish Folklore Commission collected two origin stories: * From Mrs Maher, Tulla, Threecastles, County Kilkenny, aged 87: *:One day a lady visitor came to Kilkenny Castle and brought with her three fat mice. The owner of the Castle never noticed anything until the place was full of mice. There were mice everywhere. They advertised for cats. Soon the castle was full of cats. The is how Kilkenny got the name \\"Kilkenny Cats.\\" * From Edward Quinn, Barrettsgrange, County Tipperary: *:In ancient times a team of Tipperary men visited Kilkenny to play a team of Kilkennymen at football. The Tipperarymen were winning, and advancing towards the Kilkenny‚ÄìTipperary border, when they were attacked by Kilkennymen and women, who fought like cats. The Tipperary followers retaliated, and picked up field stones and hurled them at their opponents, who had to retreat, the Tipperary team then being enabled to take the ball into their own territory. *:Ever afterwards the term \\"stonethrowers\\" was applied to Tipperary and \\"Kilkenny cats\\" to Kilkenny. Derivatives =Verse and song= Several poems have been written about the Kilkenny cats; the best known ; ; appeared in November 1867 in New York in The Galaxy, along with a grandiloquent literary commentary extolling it as \\"the Kilkenny epic\\" and comparing its \\"unknown author\\" to Homer: This is often reduced to a limerick by omitting \\"excepting their tails and some scraps of their nails\\". ; ; ; ; ; ; With standardised spelling it has been included in 20th-century Mother Goose anthologies. ; ; ; ; ; ; The full version has been set to music by Beth Anderson and performed on her 2004 album Quilt Music by Keith Borden and H.

History Angkas is a Singaporean-owned company conceptualized by its founder and CEO Angeline Tham sometime in 2015 after she claimed that she got late for several meetings after spending six hours in traffic. DBDOYC Inc. was set up as Angkas's operator. The legality of Angkas' operation has been challenged by the government. The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LFTRB) suspended Angkas' operation in November 2017 over lack of a business permit and safety concerns regarding the usage of motorcycles in ride-sharing services. This led to Angkas to introduce parcel delivery service dubbed as \\"Angkas Padala\\" in December 2017. LFTRB's move was still challenged by Angkas before the Mandaluyong Regional Trial Court which made a decision on August 20, 2018 which barred LFTRB from arresting Angkas drivers. Angkas resumed operations the following month. In December 2018, the Supreme Court issued a temporary restraining order which put on hold the implementation of the Mandaluyong court's decision. Despite of the high court's TRO, Angkas continued operations risking its drivers to arrest since it believe that the ruling didn't concern the legality of the company's operations itself. The government through the Department of Transportation (DOTr) announced in May 2019 that it would provisionally allow Angkas to operate again. Pilot operations of Angkas' motorcycle taxis in Metro Manila and Metro Cebu were allowed by the government for six months from June 2019 so the firm's operation could be monitored by the state as part of a study regarding the legality of motorcycles as public utility vehicles. During the pilot operations, Angkas would be serviced by its 27,000 riders and could not add more motorcycles to its fleet. The pilot operations which was originally set to end on December 26, 2019 was extended by the technical working group of the DOTr until March 23, 2020 with the inclusion of two competitors, JoyRide and Move It. A cap of 30,000 riders in Metro Manila and 9,000 riders in Metro Cebu was imposed with the allocation of riders equally shared between the three motorcycle taxi service providers. Angkas would have to cut down its fleet of 27,000 riders to comply with the cap. Angkas in response sought a temporary restraining order from the Quezon City Trial Court against the imposition of the cap. It withdrew its bid in January 2020 after DOTr's technical working group increased the cap for of Metro Manila riders to 45,000. Drivers Angkas has over 20,000 drivers as of November 2019, which were drawn from a pool of 60,000 applicants who were provided free training from the company. Applicant drivers are subjected to test by the company which includes on how to use the Angkas mobile app, and accomplishing an obstacle course. Markets Prior to the crackdown of the government in late 2018, Angkas provides its services in Metro Manila, Cebu, Cagayan de Oro, and General Santos. As of October 2019, Angkas is available in Metro Manila and Metro Cebu. There are plans to introduce the service in Davao City and Batangas City, and resume operations in Cagayan De Oro.

Fake is known for their comics/zines, gouache and ink paintings, and murals. Fake has an award winning comic-zine series about Gaylord Phoenix, a bird-like man that travels to different environments and has various lovers. He is currently based in Joshua Tree, California, after previously residing in Chicago and Los Angeles.  Early life and education  Fake was born in 1980 and raised in Evanston, Illinois. In 2002, Fake received a B.F.A. degree in Film, Animation and Video (FAV) from Rhode Island School of Design (RISD). After graduating from RISD, Fake worked as a negative cutter for approximately 6 years, and started working in comics, collage and drawing, and translating their animation into two dimensional work because it was more accessible. In 2015, he had been enrolled at Roski School of Art at University of Southern California (USC) and was one of the seven artists (nicknamed the \\"USC7\\") that dropped out of the school in protest of the mistreatment by the administration.  Work  Fakes work uses visual abstraction in their work as an exploration of identity in the transgender and queer experience. The Gaylord Phoenix short comics series started in 2002. In the illustrated book, Gaylord Phoenix (2010) there is expression of desire and transformation happening to a bird-like man in a dream-like, fantasy environment. In the illustrated book, Memory Palaces (2014), Fake reimagines the facades of historical queer spaces in Chicago in abstract, fantasy-like paintings of architecture, which are used as a metaphor for the transgender body. Both with architecture and the human body, these exist as structures and present decoration and protective features, and both of these are vulnerability due to shifts in U.S. politics and social change. Additionally in the exhibition of the same name, Memory Palaces (2013), at Thomas Robertello Gallery in Chicago, there were a series of drawings titled \\"Gateway\\", where Fake pays tribute the death of his five artist friends, Mark Aguhar, Nick Djandji, Dara Greenwald, Flo McGarrell, and Dylan Williams. Fake won the 2011 Ignatz Award for \\"Outstanding Graphic Novel\\" for Gaylord Phoenix. In 2019, Fake was one of the guests of honors at MoCCA Festival by the Society of Illustrators.

Deputy prosecutor Nemeth served as a deputy prosecutor. Judicial career For twenty years, from 1993 until 2013, Nemeth served as a judge on the St. Joseph Probate Court. Nemeth had been appointed to the judgeship in 1993 by governor Evan Bayh to fill out Nemeth's father's term. Nemeth played a role in the establishment of St. Joseph County's Juvenile Justice Center. In 2007 a court- ordered audit of the Indianapolis Juvenile Correctional Facility found numerous deficiencies and rated it as \\"not satisfactory\\" or \\"needs improvement\\" in 13 of 27 areas reviewed. On December 17, 2007, Nemeth informed governor Mitch Daniels that he would refuse to send female juvenile offenders to the facility, declaring it understaffed and that it was \\"neither safe nor productive\\" to send girls to this facility. In early 2012, Nemeth announced he would forgo seeking reelection to another term as a judge. Jim Fox was elected to succeed him in the judgeship. In December 2012, a month before his retirement as a judge, Nemeth agreed to a sanction from the Judicial Qualifications Commission. In August 2012, the Judicial Qualifications Commission had filed a misconduct charge against him, alleging that he violated the code of judicial conduct in a 2911 guardianship hearing when he suggested that it was inappropriate for taxpayers to pay for a sign language interpreter for a woman seeking custody of a deaf tennage because she, \\"hadn't paid taxes for several years\\".

His mother was the daughter of a Jewish-Lithuanian teacher who had fled the pogroms. In 1850, the family moved to G√∂m√∂r √©s Kishont County, where his father became a Royal tenant farmer. While there, he was introduced to literature by , a Reformed priest. Soon, his parents decided that he should be a rabbi and sent him to study in Miskolc. In 1856, at the age of thirteen, he fled to Vienna. He eventually returned home and enrolled at the in Debrecen. In 1862, when he was 19, his mother died and, around the same time, his father's business failed. He was forced to give up his studies and subsequently spent several years as an itinerant Hebrew teacher, the cities of the Great Hungarian Plain. In 1867, the year that Jewish emancipation was reproclaimed, with the establishment of the constitutional monarchy of Austria-Hungary, he went to Pest and unsuccessfully appealed to the Jewish community there to support the publication of his first book of poems. He published the volume privately, as Zsid√≥ dalok (Jewish Poems); however, it failed to gain notice. He then took work as a proofreader at the Deutsch publishing house. From 1870 to 1873, he was the editor of the Illustrated World, a journal he had taken over from . In 1873, he married a distant relative. The following year, he became seriously ill and wrote his novel, Budapesti rejtelmek (Secrets of Budapest) while bedridden. His first success came in 1875 with his long ballad-poem, ', which was presented at a meeting of the Kisfaludy Society by Ferenc Toldy. As his popularity grew, so did the controversies surrounding his point of view. The journalist, Jen≈ë R√°kosi, was an especially harsh critic. He also translated many older Psalms into modern language with a contemporary perspective, which he had to publish himself due to dogmatic criticisms. Since 1882, he had supported his literary activities by working for a French-Hungarian insurance company. When the company failed in 1889, he returned to his editing work and, in 1890, created ', a social and literary bulletin. In 1914, he became a member of the Kisfaludy Society.

Early life  Kitamura was born on January 1, 1900 in what is now Yanai city, Yamaguchi prefecture, Japan. She was the fourth daughter in a farming family of Jodo Shinshu Buddhists. She got married in November 1920, and moved to Tabuse, Yamaguchi to be with her husband.  Career  In July 1942, a barn on the Kitamura property burned down. Blaming herself for the incident, Kitamura began visiting a shaman. On May 4, 1944, Kitamura was possessed by a spirit, which was later said to be Tensho Kotaijin. She had her first sermon on July 22, 1945, during which she preached she had been sent to save the world, because it was about to end. She said that people should become \\"true human beings\\" in order to create a peaceful \\"land of god\\", and that Japan's defeat in World War II was just the prelude to a battle between good and evil. Her sermons included singing and dances of \\"non-ego\\", which earned the group the nickname \\"the dancing religion\\". In 1946, she incorporated the sect as the Tensho Kotai Jinshukyo. Her son, Yoshito, performed the administrative functions of the new religion. As the religion became more established, she became more critical of politicians, the emperor, and other people in power, calling them \\"maggots\\". She gained a lot of negative media attention, which she then used to publicize her group and gain followers. In 1952, Kitamura went on a mission trip to Hawaii. Her first overseas branch was in Kalihi, Hawaii. Soon, more branches were formed throughout the world, including in Europe, Africa, and South America. She eventually had over 300,000 followers. Kitamura died in her home on December 28, 1967. In 1968, her granddaughter, Kitamura Kiyokazu, became head of the religion.

Nutrients, 2018. 10(7). . Probiotics are widely used and accepted in many countries in clinical practice. Postbiotics, the immobilised version of probiotics are gaining traction in recent years due to the concerns about the possibility of low tolerance of probiotics, especially in paediatric populations and in severely ill or immunocompromised patients. Pique, N., M. Berlanga, and D. Minana- Galbis, Health Benefits of Heat-Killed (Tyndallized) Probiotics: An Overview. Int J Mol Sci, 2019. 20(10). Postbiotics seem to have similar beneficial properties as live probiotics with fewer of the constraints associated with unstable, diminishing bacteria.  Postbiotic types  Postbiotics could be generated using different methods: * Heat-inactivation (also includes tyndallisation) * Ultraviolet-inactivated * Chemical treatment (e.g. formalin) * Gamma-irradiation * Sonication In most cases heat treatment is considered the method of choice for deactivating probiotic strains. The effect that different types of inactivation have on bacterial structure and components as well as the maintenance of probiotic properties requires further research.  Mechanism of action  The mechanisms of action for postbiotics is less understood, though the possible mechanisms include immune system regulation and interference with pathogen attachment to host cells. Limited research hypothesises that immobilised postbiotics release key bacterial components, such as lipoteichoic acids, peptidoglycans, or exopolysaccharides which exhibit key immunomodulating effects and antagonising properties against pathogens.  General postbiotics applications  As postbiotics are newly emerging, so is the evidence to support the use of postbiotics. Emerging clinical and pre-clinical studies have demonstrated that postbiotics play a role in general health and well-being and for improving host immune function like that of probioticsBerni Canani, R., et al., Specific Signatures of the Gut Microbiota and Increased Levels of Butyrate in Children Treated with Fermented Cow's Milk Containing Heat-Killed Lactobacillus paracasei CBA L74.

Family  Robert Anstruther was a son of James Anstruther (d. 1606) and Jean Scott of Abbotshall. He was from Anstruther in Fife, Scotland. James Anstruther was the king's carver and Master of the Household. His eldest son, William Anstruther of Anstruther was a gentleman of the king's bedchamber, but had no heirs, so, in time, the Anstruther estates came to Robert's eldest son, Philip Anstruther. On 22 April 1617, Sir Robert Anstruther married Mary Swift, the daughter of Sir Robert Swift of Doncaster. They had five children. # Robert (born c. 1629) # Philip (d. 1702) # Christian (died in infancy) # Elizabeth # Sarah  Early Career, 1598-1618  Robert Anstruther graduated from St Salvator's College, St Andrews and was further educated as a page at the court of Christian IV of Denmark in 1598.'Anstruther, Robert', SSNE database, St Andrews University. Around this time he also served as a courtier to John, Prince of Schleswig-Holstein when the latter went to Russia to marry the daughter of the Tsar. Anstruther was reported to have been present at Prince John's funeral there. By 1603, Anstruther was back at the court of Christian IV, carrying falcons to Denmark‚ÄìNorway as a gift from James VI. Anstruther remained in the Danish court as a Stuart agent from 1606, and by 1612 he was noted as a famulis communis of the two kings. That year, along with his step-relative Sir James Spens of Wormiston, who was serving as British ambassador to Sweden, he helped to broker the Treaty of Kn√§red, which brought peace between Sweden and Denmark-Norway. It was because of this service that Robert Anstruther received his knighthood, although it is unclear if this was from Christian IV or James VI and I. Between 1614 and 1615, Anstruther once again served as a mediator for Christian IV and James VI, when he settled Christian's disputes with the city of L√ºbeck. Sir John Throckmorton was Governor of Vlissingen. He mentioned Anstruther bringing news in April 1612 of the defeat of Christian IV in Sweden.William Shaw & G. Dyfnallt Owen, HMC 77 Viscount De L'Isle Penshurst, vol. 5 (London, 1961), p. 41. Anstruther was passing through Vlissingen in March 1613, and they discussed the peace settlement mediated between Denmark and Sweden, the √Ñlvsborg Ransom, and the return of Kalmar and Elsburg to Sweden. Throckmorton wrote to William Trumbull that Anstruther was \\"a very honest gentleman.\\"A. B. Hinds, HMC 75 Downshire: 1613-1614, vol. 4 (London, 1940), p. 73. Throckmorton met Anstruther at Vlissingen again on 16 February 1615 for an hour. Anstruther brought him a letter from Viscount Lisle, and was going to mediate in a dispute between the town of L√ºbeck and Christian IV. He spoke to Throckmorton again on 14 May, who took his letter for Lisle.William Shaw & G. Dyfnallt Owen, HMC 77 Viscount De L'Isle Penshurst, vol. 5 (London, 1961), pp. 273, 287, 290.  Service during the Thirty Years' War, 1618-1644  In 1618, the outbreak of the Thirty Years' War in Bohemia, saw the next phase of Anstruther's service begin. By 1620, Anstruther was James VI and I's main negotiator in Germany for a settlement on behalf of Frederick V and Elizabeth Stuart. By 1621, he was traveling between Denmark-Norway and the Dutch Republic, bringing Elizabeth nearly 20,000 pounds in compensation for her household goods and helping the broker The Hague Alliance between Denmark, the Republic, and Britain. The following year, Anstruther was a gentleman of the Privy Chamber and served as a translator for the Imperial Ambassador at the English Parliament. Between 1624 and 1625, Anstruther attempted to negotiate between Christian IV, Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden, John George I, Elector of Saxony, and the Lower Saxon Circle, but the Swedish plans were ultimately rejected and King James accepted Christian's plans. Although he continued as ambassador to Denmark-Norway after the coronation of Charles I, he left the Danish court in 1629 after the Treaty of L√ºbeck, finishing much of his residency from Hamburg. In August 1630, Anstruther served as ambassador to the Diet of Regensburg, and was kindly received by Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor. Although the Diet was dissolved, Anstruther managed to secure another meeting with Ferdinand, before returning to Scandinavia, believing that any further work in the Holy Roman Empire would be prejudicial to Stuart interests. In 1631, after a sojourn to London, Anstruther returned to Hamburg. En route he visited The Hague to discuss new proposals offered by Charles I. These centered on trying to get the Duke of Bavaria elected as Emperor, and although the Dutch expressed reservations, Anstruther attended the Diet of Allied Princes at Heilbronn. In 1633, he attended another diet of Protestant princes and continued negotiating in Germany through April 1635. However, the Peace of Prague (1635) largely undermined Stuart interests in Germany, and in 1638 he turned down an appointment to represent Britain in a meeting with Christian IV in Hamburg. This may have been due to the signing of the National Covenant and the outbreak of the Bishops' Wars in Scotland. He returned as an envoy to Denmark on behalf of both Charles I and the English parliament in 1641, and signed the Solemn League and Covenant in 1643.

The inventory of the art-works in the palaces of Charles I made by Abraham van der Doort records paintings brought home by Robert Anstruther. These include a picture of a family brought from Germany (in 1630) and a \\"Martyrdom of St Bartolomew\\" attributed by Van der Doort to the Carracci in the King's chair room at Whitehall. There was also a miniature of \\"A falconer with a white dog\\" by Princess Louise which Anstruther had brought from The Hague.Oliver Millar, 'Abraham Van Der Doort's Catalogue of the Collections of Charles I', The Volume of the Walpole Society, 37 (1958-1960), pp. 62, 67, 120, 214, 224, 232.

The Court held that the onus of proof under the legislation lay with the Examiner to show that a proposed scheme of debt restructuring was not unfair to any interested party.  Background  The applicant‚Äôs company were part of the McInerney construction group but due to the economic down-turn in 2010 the group has suffered financially. This led to an application for the appointment of an examiner and the associated protection from creditors. Under this procedure a scheme was arranged and put before the High Court for approval. The banks in question, namely Bank of Ireland, Anglo-Irish Bank and KBC, contested the application with the High Court finding that the scheme was ‚Äúunfairly prejudicial to their interests‚Äù. An injunction was granted in July 2011 in order to prevent McInerney Homes from taking certain steps that would weaken the Banks security. It is alleged that McInerney Homes have not complied with the injunction order and therefore the Banks bring further proceedings to the court for contempt of court. The Supreme Court examined the question as to whether Bank of Ireland, Anglo-Irish Bank and KBC acting as creditors were unfairly prejudiced by the examiner‚Äôs proposal under the Companies (Amendment) Act 1990. = Grounds of appeal = The case was appealed to the Supreme Court and on this appeal it appears that the issue which the Court had to decide were the following (chronologically): > \\"i) What is the test for the determination of the existence of unfair > prejudice pursuant to Section 24 of the Companies Act 1990? ii) On whom does > the onus lies of establishing unfair prejudice or its absence? iii) Was the > Court correct in the first confirmation Judgement to conclude that the banks > did suffer unfair prejudice on the information before the Courts? iv) If so, > was the Court correct to reopen the issue of unfair prejudice? v) Was the > Court correct to refuse to reopen the decision in light of the improve > Oaktree offer?\\"  Holding of the Supreme Court  The Supreme Court gave its majority ruling through Justice Donal O‚ÄôDonnell. Addressing the first question the Supreme Court majority panel first commented on the examinership process, holding that ‚Äúthe process is not intended to operate to secure the survival of a company‚Äù. The process of examinership should be approved when it is beneficial to all parties as per Section 24. As such the Supreme Court was of the view that the trial Judge‚Äôs approach was consistent and that a creditor may be required to accept less than it would obtain in circumstances of liquidation or receivership. The Supreme Court highlighted that where the above applies to a creditor it would normally require weighty justification. Addressing the second question the Supreme Court majority panel held that ‚Äúonce an objection is made under Section 25 the onus of establishing the matter is on the objector‚Äùhttps://www.bailii.org/cgi- bin/format.cgi?doc=/ie/cases/IESC/2011/S31.html&query;=(McInerney)+AND+(Supreme)+AND+(Court).Therefore Sections 24 and 25 of the Companies Act 1990 were to be read together, thus placing the onus on the objector to establish unfair prejudice. As such, the Court is prohibited from approving a scheme unless it is satisfied that this is not unfairly prejudicial to any creditor and the party seeking this takes the burden of proof. Addressing the third question the Supreme Court majority panel was of the view that under Section 24, hearing are required to be conduced on the evidence available on the basis that should cross-examination of witnesses become a routine it would amount to considerable delays in hearing and finalising cases. The Supreme Court was of the view that the trial Judge was correct in concluding that it could not approve the proposals. Addressing the forth question the Supreme Court majority panel concluded that the trial Judge correctly recognized the importance of unfair prejudice when deciding to reopen the issue of unfair prejudice. The criteria being set out under the case of Paulin v Paulin and Anor [2010]Paulin v Paulin and Anor [2010] 1 WLR 1057. Addressing the fifth and final question the Supreme Court majority panel was of the view that the trial Judge was correct in refusing to re-open the decision in light of the improved offer from Oaktree. The Supreme Court noted that when Oaktree made its final offer it had indicated that this was its final offer and therefore it cannot complain as this words was taken by all other parties involved including the Court. The Supreme Court highlights that in the course of examinership a party cannot indicate willingness to adjust certain aspects of the proposal if a Court should consider same necessary, as the hearing would normally be adjourned to allow for parties to consider the proposal this did not occur in the present case precisely because of everyone‚Äôs belief that Oaktree insisted that it had made its final offer. In light of the above the Supreme Court majority panel dismissed the companies‚Äô appeal on all of the five questions before the Court. The Court further held that this litigation, amongst others, is ‚Äúone sad illustration of the loss and damage that has been caused by the traumatic expansion, and traumatic contraction, of the property marked in Ireland in the early years of this century‚Äù. = Dissent of Justice Fennelly = In dissent Justice Fennelly expressed the view that the right to object on the grounds of unfair prejudice was probably included in Section 25 of the Companies Act 1990 and that this does not affect the burden of proof. He argued that it was a burden on the balance of probabilities, as seen in the remarks of Judge McCarthy in Re Atlantic Magnetics [1993]Re Atlantic Magnetics [1993] 2 I.R. 561 and further through the observations made by Judge Clarke in Re Traffic Group Limited [2008]Re Traffic Group Limited [2008] 3 IR 253. As such, Justice Fennelly was of the view that the trial Judge did not correctly apply the principles of the burden of proof in the first judgement of the 10th of January 2011. Justice Fennelly concluded that the trial Judge had applied the correct principles in reopening the case and that he had been correct to find that the banks and, in particular, KBC, would be unfairly prejudiced and would therefore allow the appeal.  Subsequent developments  Following some of the difficulties in interpreting the Companies Act 1990 in modern times, up to date legislation was required, this came through the Companies Act 2014Companies Act 2014..

It is located in north eastern Sri Lanka, approximately west of Trincomalee and north-east of Anuradhapura. History In 2005 the Minister for Environment and Natural Resources, A. H. M. Fowzie, instructed the Director-General of the Department of Wildlife Conservation to initiate the creation of a new national park recognising the rich biodiversity in the area. The forest has been identified as receiving the highest rainfall in the Anuradhapura District. It is the natural habitat of leopards, elephants (with officials estimating that at the time there were approximately 400 wild elephants in the forest), samba deer, sloth bears, rabbits and mouse-deer. The Minister believed that declaring the forest as a national park would assist in minimising human- elephant conflict in the area, would protect villagers' cultivations and eliminate poaching and unauthorised timber logging. The creation of the park was formally ratified by gazette notification No 1735/21 on 6 December 2011. The park comprises and is situated on the left bank of Tawalamham Hammillewa and south of Kapugollewa Ihala Divul Wewa. Its eastern border starts from Kapugollewahoropothana Road which lies south of Palugaswewa. The southern border of the park starts at Kebbetigollewa Horowpothana on the A 29 road while its western border is located next to the Welimuwapothanna Wewa. In 2015 the country's first Elephant Holding Ground (EHG) was established in the national park, where problem elephants from around the country are translocated to. The EHG comprises of land within the national park with the capacity for 40 elephants. The translocation process and the management of the EHG has been criticised by a number of sources. On 12 September 2019, the park was increased to include the land area adjacent to the Elephant Retention Centre in Horowpothana. Etymology Horowpathana comes from the Sinhalese words for ‚Äòsluice‚Äô and ‚Äòseven‚Äô, which refers to the area‚Äôs ancient irrigation system.

Background  In terms of background of the case, the parents have applied for places for their two children, aged 9 and 10 at the time, at St. Mologa‚Äôs National School. The parents were verbally informed that the school was full and no further pupils were accepted. The above response was further confirmed in writing to the parents in a letter dated the 6th of February 2008. St. Mologa‚Äôs National School is a senior primary school with 3rd to 6th classes only and has a longstanding relationship with St. Peter and St. Paul‚Äôs School. The latter cater for children up to 2nd class only. Therefore, the enrollment policy of St. Mologa‚Äôs National School is to give priority to pupils entering 3rd class coming from Sr. Peter and Paul‚Äôs School, then to siblings of children already in the school, then to catholic children of the parish, then to catholic children outside the parish and finally to non-catholic children from outside the parish. The school has no formal transfer policy to cater for children seeking to enter the school other than new entrants in 3rd class. As the school board of management refused to enroll the two children, the parents appealed the decision to the appeal committee with the appeal being allowed. The school board of management brought judicial review proceedings of the decisions of the appeals committee and Judge Irvine in the High Court allowed the appeal, as such the appeals committee appealing to this Court against the judgement and order of the High Court quashing the decisions of the appeals committee. The issue that was raised was the interpretation of Section 29 of the Education Act 1998, the High Court Judge accepting the submissions of the board of management in so far that a ‚ÄúSection 29 appeal is limited in its scope.‚Äù = Grounds of appeal = The grounds of appeal were filled by the appeals committee on the 9th of June 2009, submitting that the High Court erred in law and in fact on a number of occasions, as follows: > i) The appeals committee acted ultra vires within the powers conferred on > the committee under Section 29. ii) The substantive power given under > Section 29 did not give the appeals committee the jurisdiction to re-hear > the appeal. iii) The substantive power given under Section 29 did not allow > the appeals committee the jurisdiction to substitute, on appeal from a > decision of the board of management, its decision. iv) The powers of the > appeals committee were restrained to reviewing the lawfulness and/or > reasonableness of the board of management‚Äôs decision making. v) Applying the > ‚Äúinformed interpretation rule‚Äù. vi) The appeals committee did not regard the > considerations on reaching its decision.  Holding of the Supreme Court  Ruling on the above grounds of appeal, the Supreme Court expressed the view that the description of the process of Section 29(1) is straightforward. In circumstances where a board refused to enroll a student in a school, the parent can appeal that decision to the Secretary General of the Department of Education and Science. The Supreme Court was of the view that Section 29 should be attributed its plain meaning as its literal meaning was clear, unambiguous and not absurd. Accordingly, the Supreme Court held that it was further satisfied that an appeals committee has the jurisdiction to conduct a full re-hearing on an appeal under Section 29. It therefore held that the High Court had erred in its interpretation of Section 29 and allowed the appeal on the preliminary issue.  Subsequent developments  The Supreme Court's ruling on the interpretation of Section 29 has been applied in subsequent case law.

The colliery, which was owned by The Weardale Iron and Coal Company, consisted of two mines: Eden Pit, sunk in 1872 and Charles Pit, sunk in 1874. At its height, the pit employed 420 people, who routinely mined 600 tons of coal per day. http://www.dmm.org.uk/colliery/m032.htm. Charles Pit Charles Pit reached a maximum depth of 590 feet (180 metres), and contained the Brockwell coal seam at approximately 400 feet deep (roughly 119 metres) http://www.dmm.org.uk/shafts/m032-01.htm . Charles Pit closed in 1914 https://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/news/4540644.i-was-born-at-eden-pit/. The remains of Charles Pit can be seen in Charles Row and the spoil tip, still referred to in the village as \\"the pit heap\\". The pit heap contains part of the park/recreational area. Eden Pit Coal from Charles Pit was transported here on the Tramlines; Eden had an area where the coal was then dropped down onto the Stockton and Darlington Railway. The pit closed in 1894 https://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/news/4540644.i-was-born-at-eden-pit/ A nearby settlement, consisting of 37 houses http://www.middridge.org.uk/page12/page22/page23/page23.html, provided homes for the miners. However, after the pit closed, the ex-miners (now almost all unemployed) and their families remained in Eden. At this stage, Eden was described as a 'stagnant, suffering village' https://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/history/4656910.come-friendly-bombs-and- fall-oneden/. Despite attempts to regenerate Eden, the situation did not improve, and the entire village was demolished in the 1950s. Today, along with nearby Riseburn, little if any trace remains.

It derives its name from the two Gallo-Roman stone lions that stand guard at the entrance of the building. History Around 630, Saint Loup, bishop of Limoges, bestowed St. Michel's Chapel to the canons of St. Martial. The church was destroyed by two successive fires in 1123 and 1147 and was re-built by monk Pierre de Verteuil. It was consecrated in 1213. But the building collapsed and the foundation stone of another church was laid in 1364. Only two chapels and some walls remain from the church of 1364. In 1552, the church was extended and a new bay with glass walls were added to the west side. Other works were made in the following centuries, mainly on the bell tower in 1604, 1754, 1810, ect. Description This Gothic church from the 14th and 16th centuries has a typical Limousin bell tower (as the Limoges Cathedral) topped by a metal ball. In 1810, lighting stroke the bell tower and damaged the building. The soldier in charge of the renovation of the spire wanted to install a ball atop the bell tower \\"to facilitate triangulation operations and geodetic measures\\". This ball weighs 600 kg and is 2 meters wide. Indeed, the ball endangered the building because it had a high wind factor. Renovation works were launched and the presence of the ball was controversial among the inhabitants. With the authorization of the Ministry of Fine Arts, a new ball was supposed to replace the older one, but the First World War broke out. The new copper ball was finally installed after the end of the War. It stands next to the weathercock which has never been moved since 1824. The church was listed as a Historic Monument in 1909.

Kennedy cites this as a nationalist distortion of the Great Famine. Unhappy the Land: The Most Oppressed People Ever, the Irish? is a 2016 book by Liam Kennedy, professor emeritus at Queen's University, Belfast. Kennedy introduces, as well as criticizes, the concept of \\"most oppressed people ever\\" (MOPE) to describe what he sees as a pervasive assumption both among Irish nationalists and the Irish diaspora that Irish people have been uniquely victimised throughout history. Throughout the book he plays devil's advocate while questioning many truisms he perceives as being commonly accepted about Irish history. The book received generally favourable reviews. Contents The title comes from Bertolt Brecht's aphorism that \\"Unhappy the land that is in need of heroes\\". It is meant somewhat ironically as Kennedy argues against the idea that Ireland is especially unhappy. Kennedy introduces the idea of \\"most oppressed people ever\\" (MOPE) in the first chapter, an idea which he believes is the master narrative for Northern Ireland. According to him, ‚ÄúThis beguiling framework, which speaks as much to the emotions as to reason, has been enormously influential in shaping historical thought on Ireland, both at the level of folk history and academic writing.‚Äù The first part of the book is explicitly comparative, arguing that the British government did not suppress the Irish language and traditions as much as far-right and fascist governments in continental Europe dealt with minorities. Another chapter is focused on criticising analogies between the Great Famine and the Holocaust of European Jews. Kennedy argues that those who make this analogy are typically vague, as specific parallels do not exist. Instead, the genocide allegations were invented to support the Irish nationalist narrative. The book is not meant to be comprehensive, but supplies plenty of examples to support his thesis. Another of Kennedy's aims is to question the traditional model of mutually antagonistic Catholic and Protestant communities, in favour of pluralism. He is critical of both unionist and nationalist historiography, coming to similar conclusions about the Proclamation of the Irish Republic and the contemporaneous Ulster Covenant, which he says are \\"manipulative documents... replete with contradictions, evasions and silences... Each has its quotient of make- believe\\". He also questions whether a \\"War of Independence\\" really took place in Ireland, as it continued to have close ties with the United Kingdom, which was also the main destination of Irish emigrants. He also considers that it is more accurate to consider it a civil conflict between nationalists and unionists that was dealt with as a police action by the British. Full-scale war was prevented by public opinion in Britain, which opposed keeping Ireland in the Union by force. Reception According to a favourable Irish Times review, \\"Kennedy seems to regard the historian‚Äôs role as somewhere between professional sceptic, state pathologist and investigative journalist\\". A review in the Irish Examiner describes the book as \\"a seminal book that poses fundamental questions about the social and political history of Ireland\\", although it is critical of Kennedy's \\"unprofessional\\" dismissal of Tim Pat Coogan's The Famine Plot. Irish senator Maurice Hayes said that the book \\"slaughters almost every sacred cow in sight, from the Famine to the Rising, the Ulster Covenant and the Proclamation of the Republic, the Troubles (however labelled retrospectively) and the Civil War\\". Ruth Dudley Edwards recommended giving a copy to then-Sinn F√©in leader Gerry Adams, who, she says, clings to the MOPE mentality \\"like a comfort blanket\\". In an academic review, Professor Penelope Corfield lauds the book for being \\"Sombre in subject matter, lucid in approach, impressive in range, brilliant in insights, sturdy in documentation, judicious in tone, coolly courageous in its willingness to debunk stereotypes\\". She writes that the book should be required reading not just for Irish historians but for all those who study human disasters and historical memory. Writing in Irish Studies Review, Ian Miller calls Unhappy the Land \\"an intriguing book that sets out to challenge, provoke and presumably annoy many of its readers\\". He states that it is well-written, thoroughly researched, and convincing.

There were two main palace complexes, the Eastern and the Western Palace. They were located in the center of the walled city of Cairo around the area still known today as Bayn al-Qasrayn (\\"Between the Two Palaces\\").  History and description  = Overview = Fatimid Cairo (before 1200 CE), as reconstructed by Stanley Lane-Poole, showing the approximate layout of the city and the location of the palaces.alt= The Fatimids were originally based in Tunisia and conquered Egypt in 969 CE with a North African Kutama Berber army under the command of the general Jawhar al-Siqilli. In 970, Jawhar was responsible for planning, founding, and constructing a new city to serve as the residence and center of power for the Fatimid caliphs. The city was named al-Mu'izziyya al-Qahira, the \\"Victorious City of al-Mu'izz\\", later simply called \\"al-Qahira\\", which gave us the modern name of Cairo. The new city was located northeast of Fustat, the previous capital and main city of Egypt. Jawhar organized the city so that the caliphal palace complex was at its center, in addition to the main mosque, al- Azhar, to the southeast. The palace complex consisted of two main parts: the Great Eastern Palace, the first to be laid out in 970 by Jawhar for the arrival of the triumphant Caliph al-Mu'izz, and the Western Palace, which was added under his successor, Caliph al-'Aziz (). Together they served as the residences of the caliphs and their family throughout the Fatimid period, and were thus also known as the Dar al-Khilafa (\\"Abode of the Caliphate\\"). Information about the layout and appearance of these palaces comes from a few written reports, and especially from the chronicles of the Arab historian Maqrizi and of the Persian traveler Nasir Khusraw. The two palaces faced each other across an open square or plaza which became known as Bayn al-Qasrayn (meaning \\"Between the Two Palaces\\"), on a pattern repeated from the original Fatimid royal city at al-Mahdiya, Tunisia.√áelik, Zeynep, Diane G. Favro, and Richard Ingersoll, eds. Streets: Critical Perspectives on Public Space. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1994, p. 72 This square was rectangular and measured , taking up over .Raymond, Andr√©. 1993. Le Caire. Fayard. It had great public and symbolic significance, and was the site of various ceremonies related to the dynasty. The grand official entrance to the Great Eastern Palace, known as Bab al-Dhahab (\\"The Golden Gate\\"), was located here. = The Great Eastern Palace = The Great Eastern Palace was the larger of the two, and is believed to have occupied about , or one-fifth of the total area of Cairo at the time. It was begun under al-Mu'izz and finished under al- Aziz, although work of various kinds continued for decades, even under al- Hakim and under the vizier al-Ma'mun al-Bata'ihi in the 12th century. The palace opened to the rest of the city through nine gates (three to the west, one to the north, three to the east, and two to the south), but it was also separated from the city around it by gardens and open squares. This sprawling but secluded layout in the center of the city kept with a tradition, already established by the Abbasid caliphs, of isolating the caliph from the public sphere. Members of the Isma'ili religious establishment (scholars and clerics) were also housed in or around the palace, which had its own muezzin and thus did not rely on the call to prayer of the al-Azhar Mosque. Carved wooden panel with images of animals and humans, believed to have belonged to a door in one of the Fatimid palaces. (On display at the Louvre.) The Eastern Palace was composed of many great halls, the most important of which were preceded by courtyards (called dihliz). The palace also featured many gardens or courtyards, often bordered by porticos and featuring pavilions and fountains, where court life unfolded. Visitors who wrote about the palaces reported marble pavements of different colors, central fountains, gold fixtures and ornamentation, and animals on display to impress guests. The palace's official grand entrance was through its central western gate called Bab al-Dhahab (\\"The Golden Gate\\"), which opened off the Bayn al-Qasrayn plaza. (Its location would have been facing the present-day Mausoleum of Qalawun across the street.) It apparently featured gold brought from Ifriqiya (present-day Tunisia). Above the gate was a balcony at which the caliph would appear to the public on occasions. This entrance led to the \\"Golden Hall\\" (Qa'at al-Dhahab or Dar al- Dhahab) via a vaulted passage around 30 meters long. The Golden Hall acted as a throne room where the caliph held his daily audiences and where official receptions and some religious festivals took place. Another important hall was known as the Great Iwan, which was crowned by a dome. This was the venue were the Isma'ili clerics and missionaries (da'is) would hold sermons for the palace residents, as well as some of the most important religious festivals. In this hall the caliph's seat was hidden behind a screen or grille known as the Shubbak al-Khalifa (\\"Caliph's Window\\"). Both the Golden Hall and the Great Iwan were built or completed under al-Aziz. About one quarter of the palace to the northeast was taken up by a great square called Rahbat al-Eid (\\"Festival Square\\"), measuring 157 by 105 meters, which was the starting point for the caliph's processions through the city. One of the eastern gates, called Bab al-Zumurrud (\\"Emerald Gate\\"), opened off this square and gave access to the part of the palace known as the Emerald Palace, the private residence of the caliph. Another gate opening off the southern side of the square was called Bab al-Eid. An arsenal hall, called Khizanat al-Bunud (roughly the \\"Arsenal of Banners/Flags\\"), lay to the east of the palace, as did a gate known as Bab Qasr al-Sharq (\\"Eastern Palace Gate\\"). The southeastern gate, Bab Daylam (\\"Gate of the Daylamites\\"), led to the monument that later became the shrine of al-Husayn (see below), while the southwestern gate was called Bab Turbat al-Za'faraan (or Bab al-Za'faraan), after the name of the adjacent royal mausoleum (see below). The southwestern part of the palace was occupied by the kitchens, which also provided food for the poor during the fasting month of Ramadan. The southernmost of the western gates, located here, became known as Bab Zuhuma, named after the odors of food emanating from the kitchens. The only northern gate of the palace, Bab al-Rih (\\"Gate of the Wind\\"), was the entrance used by the da'is. This gate may also have been the last one to disappear in the post-Fatimid period, having survived at least until 1408 and having been seen by Maqrizi. In the 12th century, the vizier al-Ma'mun al- Bata'ihi (in office from 1122-1125) added three more pavilions to the palace. He was also responsible for building the al-Aqmar Mosque, which still stands today, at the northwestern edge of the palace.  The mausoleum: Turbat al- Za'faraan  Attached to the southern end of the eastern palace was a mausoleum known as Turbat al-Za'faraan (\\"The Saffron Tomb\\"), which served as the burial site of the caliphs.Lev, Y. 2001. \\"Aspects of the Egyptian Society in the Fatimid Period\\". In Vermeulen, Urbain & J. van Steenbergen (eds.). Egypt and Syria in the Fatimid, Ayyubid, and Mamluk Eras III: Proceedings of the 6th, 7th and 8th International Colloquium Organized at the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven in May 1997, 1998, and 1999. Peeters Publishers. p. 20. Even the remains of the Fatimid caliphs in Tunisia were transferred here when the caliphate moved to Egypt. The tombs were eventually completely demolished by the Mamluk amir Jaharka al-Khalili to make way for the Khan al-Khalili in the late 14th century, which gave its name to the surrounding souq area still present today. Jaharkas reportedly disposed of the bones of the Fatimid royal family by throwing them into the rubbish hills east of the city. Also adjacent to the caliphs' mausoleum was the later 12th-century shrine which allegedly housed the head of al-Husayn, the son of Ali ibn Abi Talib who was slain at the Battle of Karbala in 680 and is revered as a martyr by the Shi'a. His head was originally believed to be interred at Ascalon, but the Fatimids brought it to Cairo in 1153 when Ascalon was threatened by the Crusaders. Since the Fatimids claimed descent through al-Husayn's mother, Fatima, the creation of this shrine was an important symbolic and religious act. The shrine still exists today (albeit rebuilt many times) in the al-Hussein Mosque, which is heavily visited by Muslims. = The Western Palace = An iwan in the maristan (hospital) of Sultan Qalawun which incorporates remains from the Fatimid Western Palace which previously stood here. The smaller Western Palace (sometimes referred to as the Lesser Palace) was initially built as a residence for one of Caliph al-Aziz's daughters, Sitt al-Mulk (who was also de facto ruler between 1021 and 1023). It covered about 4.5 hectares and had two wings which wrapped around the south and north sides of the Bayn al-Qasrayn plaza. Less is known overall about this palace, as it was quickly replaced by other structures in the post-Fatimid era. The palace was built on the site of a vast, previously-existing garden called al-Bustan al-Kafur (or al-Bustan al- Kafuri), which was originally established here by the Ikhshidid ruler Abu'l-Misk Kafur, who ruled Egypt before the Fatimids. The western part of the garden was retained for the Fatimids' pleasure and was initially reserved for the caliph's family. The Eastern and Western Palaces, as well as these gardens to the west, were all connected by large tunnels that allowed the caliphs to get from one to the other by horse. The Western Palace was refurbished in 1064 by Caliph al-Mustansir who had hoped to house the Abbasid caliphs, his Sunni rivals, after having briefly deposed them in Baghdad for a year (in 1058-59); however, this purpose was never served. The palace was also known as Qasr al- Bahr (\\"Palace of the Sea/River\\") in reference to the fact that it lay near the ancient canal (the Khalij), which passed next to Cairo and which once extended to the Red Sea. = Other nearby Fatimid palaces and facilities = Throughout the Fatimid period various other minor palaces and establishments were also built in the areas surrounding the caliphs' palaces. To the south of both palaces were a set of stables. The vizier's palace, the Dar al-Wizara, was located northeast of the Eastern Palace, on the site of the current Khanqah of Sultan Baybars al-Jashnakir and the Madrasa of Amir Qarasunqur. It was built by the vizier al-Afdal (son of the famous vizier Badr al-Gamali) after 1094. Caliph al-Hakim (between 996 and 1021) or al-Amir (in 1116) added next to the southern end of the Western Palace an academy known as the Dar al-'ilm (roughly \\"House of Knowledge/Science\\"). Another palace known as al-Qasr al- Nafi'i was located to the south of the eastern palace on a site occupied today by the 19th-century Wikala al-Silahdar inside Khan al-Khalili. The Fatimids also built leisure palaces along the shores of the Nile and along the Khalij canal, such as the Lu'lu'a or Pearl Palace built by al-'Aziz and rebuilt by al-Zahir. (It was later used as the residence for Salah ad-Din's father.) The mother of al-'Aziz also built a large palace within al-Qarafa, the vast necropolis and cemetery of the main city of Fustat to the south.  The palaces after the Fatimids  Cairo was definitively opened to all people under the rule of Salah ad-Din (Saladin), who dismantled the Fatimid Caliphate in 1171 and embarked on the construction of a new fortified citadel (the current Citadel of Cairo) further south, outside the walled city, that would house Egypt's rulers and state administration. This ended Cairo's status as an exclusive palace-city and started a process by which the city became an economic center inhabited by ordinary Egyptians and frequented by foreign travelers. The old Fatimid palaces in the city became obsolete as caliphal residences and were opened up to redevelopment. Salah ad-Din initially transformed them into residences for the aristocracy of his own Ayyubid dynasty, as well as into madrasas, a khanqah, and a hospital.Behrens-Abouseif, Doris. 2007. Cairo of the Mamluks: A History of Architecture and its Culture. Cairo: The American University in Cairo Press. The Ayyubid sultans al-Kamil and al-Salih built important madrasas in different areas of the site of the former palaces. In the Mamluk period the transformation of the area continued and most of the palaces disappeared and were replaced with various urban structures, and transformed into new city neighbourhoods. Some remnants of the palace remained standing for centuries after the fall of the Fatimids. Nonetheless, the main north‚Äìsouth street of Cairo, the Qasaba (al-Muizz Street), remained a fixture and the former area of Bayn al-Qasrayn remained a privileged site for the construction of royal architectural complexes such as the Maristan-Mausoleum-Madrasa complex of Sultan Qalawun. The Bayn al-Qasrayn square itself, however, steadily disappeared and became essentially another stretch of the Qasaba street, as construction on either side filled up the previously open space.  Remnants of the palaces today  A pair of wooden beams carved with scenes of animals and humans which belonged to the Fatimid Western Palace. (On display at the Museum of Islamic Art, Cairo.) Practically nothing remains of the palaces today, other than the occasional toponym and a few minor physical fragments. Most of the buildings in the Bayn al-Qasrayn area were built on top of the foundations or ruins of the palaces. One of the main courtyards in the maristan (hospital) of Sultan al-Mansur Qalawun (built in 1285) incorporates remnants of the Western Fatimid Palace, in particular some carved stucco windows in its eastern iwan, probably part of what was originally a palace courtyard which had four iwans arranged in a cross formation. Likewise, the lobed fountain in the middle of the courtyard of Qalawun's madrasa (in the same complex) also belonged to that palace. The 13th-century Madrasa of al-Salih Ayyub was built in part over the former kitchens of the palace. The Khanqah of Sultan Baybars al-Jashnakir (built in 1306-1310) and the Madrasa of Amir Qarasunqur (built in 1300) stand on the site of the former residence of the Fatimid viziers, which faced a western gate of the Eastern Palace. The large iron window grille in the exterior facade of the mausoleum of Baybars al-Jashnakir's khanqah was originally an artifact brought from the Abbasid palaces in Baghdad and used in the Fatimid viziers' palace. The old Ayyubid minaret at the entrance of the al-Hussein Mosque is built over one of the Fatimid Eastern Palace's former gates (cited as the \\"Bab al-Akhdar\\" but perhaps the same as the Bab al-Daylam) as the shrine of al-Hussein was originally adjoined to the palace. Some artifacts and architectural fragments from the Fatimid Great Palaces are now on display in Cairo's Museum of Islamic Art, including wooden panels and beams found in the Maristan complex of Qalawun and in the Madrasa of al-Nasir Muhammad.O'Kane, Bernard (with contributions by Mohamed Abbas and Iman R.

The title work is described as \\"a nationalistic poem in four cantos\\", named as \\"Florida\\", \\"Virginia\\", \\"Acadia\\", and \\"Louisiana\\"; and as \\"one of the few full- length poems by early southern writers\\". Content The Oxford Companion to American Literature, fourth edition, described Hesperia as \\"a long poem in Tom Moore's vein.\\" The Encyclopedia of American Poetry: The Nineteenth Century calls it \\"part epic, part Byronesque narrative in the manner of Childe Harold, part autobiography and part philosophic essay.\\" It is written in ottava rima. Dedication Hesperia is dedicated to a fictitious \\"Marchesa Manfredina di Cosenza\\". Tucker points out that the name derives from Manfredi di Cosenza, mentioned in the Purgatorio of Dante. In the Dedication, the title Hesperia is explained, as to an Italian: from the Greek, it implies the westward land (from the literal evening star), and so Italy. But also it is to apply to America, further to the west. Tucker accepts the identification of the dedicatee made by Aubrey H. Starke, as Ellen Adair White (Mrs. White Beatty). She was Eleanor Katherine Adair, a daughter of John Adair, who married Joseph M. White, and after his 1839 death as a result of a duel, Theophilus Beatty. Another suggestion, made by Wright, is that the Marchesa, addressed as \\"Mary\\", stands for Maria Robbins (1806‚Äì1869), English wife of the Italian Marchese Lorenzo Bartolommei of Florence.Nathalia Wright, The Letters of Richard Henry Wilde to Hiram Powers, Part II, The Georgia Historical Quarterly Vol. 46, No. 4 (December, 1962), pp. 417‚Äì437, at p. 437 note 111. Published by: Georgia Historical Society She was widowed in 1836, the year in which Wilde settled for about four years in Florence, and they were rumoured to be intending to marry, though nothing came of it. She was the sister of the Rev. George Robbins.Nathalia Wright, The Italian Son of Richard Henry Wilde, The Georgia Historical Quarterly Vol. 43, No. 4 (December, 1959), pp. 419‚Äì427, at p. 419 note 2. Published by: Georgia Historical Society Arguing that Ellen Adair White is referred to in the fourth canto of Hesperia, by means of the name of her parental home, and that Wilde was in love with her as a married woman, Graber then finds a crux. \\"Why Wilde did not marry Mrs. White-Beatty after the death of her first husband is still a mystery.\\"Ralph S.

Published by: Georgia Historical Society Pseudonym and notes All the indications are that Wilde was chary of publishing literary work under his own name, considering that a reputation as an author could damage his reputation as a lawyer. His intention was that Hesperia should be published under the pseudonym \\"FitzHugh de Lancy\\". The book publication, 20 years after his death, subverted the pseudonym by the device of a doubled title page, one page showing his real name.Douglas C.

A. Durai. The film features newcomer Selvin and Nicole in lead roles, with Soori, Sippy, and Jayakumaran playing supporting roles. The film's music was composed by Vijayabharathi with cinematography by C. H. Prasath and editing by K. Thanikachalam. The film was released on 31 December 2009. Plot In a slum in Chennai, Naai Kutty (Selvin), an orphan, is brought up by a cycle rickshaw puller. He spends his time drinking alcohol in the company of his friend Maari (Soori), and he does not go for any work. Malli (Nicole) sells flowers in a temple near the slum, and she is in love with Naai Kutty, while her friend Ammu (Sippy) treats him like her brother. After the death of his adoptive father, Naai Kutty decides to ride his cycle rickshaw. Naai Kutty then comes in contact with prostitutes who uses his rickshaw and he gets paid handsomely for his service. Naai Kutty starts to carry prostitutes and he eventually buys an auto rickshaw. One day, rowdies try to misbehave with the prostitutes in a brothel, Naai Kutty beats the rowdies up and saves the prostitutes. Impressed by his strength, the kingpin of the flesh trade Reddy (Jayakumaran) hires Naai Kutty as his henchman. One day, Ammu is sold by her father to Reddy, Naai Kutty clashes with Reddy to save her and he quits his job in disgust. Later, Naai Kutty sells his auto rickshaw and buys a van to start a new life. In the meantime, Maari, who runs in the councillor election, begs Naai Kutty to lend him money for the election, but Naai Kutty refuses because he has run out of money. A vengeful Reddy hatches a conspiracy against Naai Kutty, and he convinces Maari to leave Malli to him. Malli is drugged, and wealthy clients rape an unconscious Malli in the brothel. Naai Kutty then meets Reddy, and Reddy gives him money to dispose of a body. At the cemetery, a drunk Naai Kutty discovers the body of Malli, and he is in shock. The slum dwellers who come across Naai Kutty misunderstand the situation and beat Naai Kutty to death. The film ends with Ammu killing Maari for betraying Naai Kutty.

A. Durai, producer of Pithamagan (2003) and Gajendra (2004), in mid-2008, where it was reported that S. S. Joe, an associate of Ram, would work on a film revolving a youth brought up in a Chennai slum. S. S. Joe was himself raised in the slums of Chennai and so he was expected to bring out the emotional and social plight of slum dwellers with reality as the strength. Prasanna and Nicole signed to play the lead roles while comedian Santhanam was approached to play a significant role and Sundar C. Babu was chosen to compose the music. The film was inaugurated in Chennai on 24 September 2008 without the presence of S. S. Joe. In late-September 2008, a complaint had been lodged by director Ram Shiva in the councils of Tamilnadu film producers and directors. Director Ram Siva, regarding his complaint said, \\"The story of Naai Kutty has been stolen from the Kannada film Nanda Loves Nanditha which was a smash hit in Karnataka. I hold the copyright to remake the movie in Tamil. As the efforts of Durai and Sathaji to buy the right for the remake ended in vain, they have ventured into remaking the same movie in Tamil with a different name Naai Kutty\\". Director S. S. Joe had withdrawn from the project and had left Chennai, to avoid facing the legal problems which would possibly come in the future. Subsequently, V. A. Durai restarted the project with a new script and Sathaji was chosen to direct the film whereas Kannada music director Vijayabharathi signed to compose the music. Newcomer Selvin signed on after Prasanna opted out of the role and Soori replaced Santhanam. Soundtrack The film score and the soundtrack were composed by film composer Vijayabharathi. The soundtrack features 6 tracks, and it was released on 25 July 2009 by actor Silambarasan. A reviewer rated the album 2.5 out of 5 and said, \\"This album doesn't shout from the rooftops, of course. But it is pleasant, neat and functional, probably falling well in line with the storyline\\". Release The film got an A certificate with a few cuts for its violence and bloodshed and it was released on 31 December 2009. =Critical reception= Sify wrote, \\"There is nothing positive in the film. It tries to cash in on the slum life and its brutal ways but ends up as too pretentious\\" and called the film \\"a waste of time\\". Behindwoods rated the film 0.5 out of 5 stars and stated, \\"Naai Kutty is a sorry tale of a man for whom nothing went right in life. It does not bring any cheer to the audience, neither is it able to make the viewer pity nor feel for the suffering characters\\". Indiaglitz said, \\"Though Naaikutty had all potential to become a sleeping hit, it has ended up a dull affair, blame predictable sequences narrated in a vague way\\". =Box office= The film took a below average opening at the Chennai box office.

In 1971, Ross Jackson co-founded SimCorp A/S: one of the world's first financial engineering companies. Later, Jackson began focusing more on international finance, consulting around the world in investment strategies for banks, insurance companies, and mutual fund providers. This led Ross Jackson to research currency trading methods and the creation of various investment strategies. In the early 1980s, Ross Jackson traveled to India and met Muktananda, a Hindu swami whose teaching led Jackson to an epiphany. > \\"I felt a divine connection,\\" he says. \\"Material things meant less after > that.\\" Ross Jackson has described his awakening in the book, Kali Yuga Odyssey: A Spiritual Journey (San Francisco, Robert D. Reed, 2000). In 1987 he integrated his spiritual insights with his business and environmental interests by forming Gaia Trust, a charitable Danish entity with the mandate to support people and projects that are moving the planet towards sustainability through grants and proactive initiatives. > \\"As a thinker, entrepreneur, author, activist and chair of a Danish > foundation that supports renewable energy and sustainable living, Ross > Jackson is trying to steer humanity on a different, more nature-oriented way > of life.\\" - The Complete Engineer, The magazine of the Faculty of > Engineering and applied science at Queen‚Äôs University. Winter Edition 2011  Gaia Trust  Gaia Trust is a Danish-based charitable association founded in 1987 on the initiative of Ross and Hildur Jackson, with the intention of supporting the transition to a sustainable and more spiritual future society through grants and proactive initiatives. Ross has been Chairman of Gaia Trust since its foundation. The first major project was to support the people on the ground who were actually trying to live sustainably and lead by example. In 1991 Ross Jackson co-founded the Global Ecovillage Network (GEN) together with his wife Hildur Jackson. GEN ‚Äî The Global Ecovillage Network was formally founded at Findhorn Ecovillage, Scotland, in October 1995 with financial support from Gaia Trust, which continues to this day. The next major NGO project initiated by Gaia Trust evolved out of GEN in 1998 and was largely inspired by Ross Jackson's wife Hildur. It came to be known as Gaia Education, which was formally founded in 2005 at Findhorn Ecovillage and is an educational curriculum for the sustainable design of communities, available both face-to-face and online in three languages at this time, now expanding into applying SDGs and promoting Gaia Schools. In the foreword to Ross Jackson's book And We ARE Doing It: Building an Ecovillage Future (San Francisco, Robert D. Reed, 2000) David C. Korten, author of \\"When Corporations Rule the World\\" writes: > ‚Äú‚Ä¶ Ross leads an unusual double life. In the world of global finance, he is > known as the board chair of GaiaCorp, a leading manager of currency-based > hedge funds and advisor to international financial institutions on foreign > exchange management. In the world of environmental activism, he is known as > the board chair of Gaia Trust, a visionary grant-making foundation that has > expended more than $15 million in GaiaCorp profits to support groups around > the world pioneering the development of ecovillages and green enterprises as > the foundation of 21st-century civilization. ‚Ä¶ While it is not uncommon for > successful entrepreneurs who create large personal fortunes to eventually > turn their attention to philanthropy, Ross is distinctive in that he > established GaiaCorp for the primary explicit purpose of generating profits > to finance progressive social change.‚Äù Gaia Trust has always been self-funded by earnings from its very successful daughter company Gaiacorp, a foreign currency manager and advisory firm. The basis for Gaiacorp‚Äôs business was software and research donated to Gaia Trust by Ross Jackson, who retained 10% of the shares for the first five years. The announced intention from the beginning was to sell off Gaiacorp after about 10 years in order to free up capital for the charitable activities, and this sale was indeed completed in 2000, where Gaiacorp was sold to The Appleton Group. Gaia Trust‚Äôs strategy has always been two-pronged with yin and yang components. The yin component was to support the ecovillage movement through grants, while the yang component was to invest its capital in ‚Äúgreen‚Äù startup companies that would complement the grants policy, creating jobs and promoting more sustainable businesses. The major projects resulting were the establishment of the Global Ecovillage Network and Gaia Education and a venture capital firm Gaia Technologies A/S. Over 300 grants have been made to projects in over 30 countries. The current board of directors of Gaia Trust comprises Ross Jackson (chair), Lars Kjeldsen, Flemming Jensen and Peter Pruzan.  Green Invesments  Besides the IT consulting companies and his financial consulting business that characterized most of Ross Jackson‚Äôs professional career, he continues to take an active part in companies with a double purpose, sustainability, and financial viability. The most successful has been Gaia Trusts' investment in Urtekram. The company was early out (1972) as a major Scandinavian organic foods wholesaler, but was continually in financial difficulties and close to bankruptcy. Ross personally, along with Gaia Trust, took over 2/3 of the company in 1995, brought in a professional management team, and turned it around over the next 20 years with a net turnover of almost DKK 400 million. Urtekram A/s was sold to Midsona AB, Sweden, in 2015 as a well-consolidated and profitable firm. Ross Jackson says the following about the sale: > \\"By making healthy organic products Urtekram every day contributes to a > better environment. I am happy together with Gaia Trust to have contributed > to the success of a sound and profitable green company in Denmark\\" For many years, Ross hoped that some traditional developers would discover the potential in ecovillages and bring a professional approach to the concept, so ecovillages could become mainstream and not take 8‚Äì10 years for a small group of amateurs to get from concept to actually move in. Now he has decided to do it himself with a partner from the traditional development world in start-up B√¶rebo A/S (Danish abbreviation for ‚Äúsustainable living‚Äù) A second recent green start-up is Nerve Smart Systems, a technology company specializing in advanced battery technology with the goal of making industrial batteries far more efficient and long-living. Ross is the major shareholder and chairman of the board.  Family  Ross married Hildur, a Danish law graduate (1967) with postgraduate studies in cultural sociology, in 1967. They have three children (Rolf, 1968), (Thor Leif, 1969) and Frej (1979) and seven grandchildren. Hildur and Ross were equal partners from the beginning of Gaia Trust‚Äôs activities. Hildur died of cancer in 2015.  Early Life and Education  Ross was born in 1938 in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada (full name James Thomas Ross Jackson) and lived in Ottawa, Ontario for most of his youth. His father was a flying instructor and psychologist, working for the Canadian Defense Department, later as secretary to the Joint Chiefs of Staff. After matriculating from Fisher Park High School, Ross won a four-year scholarship to study engineering at Carleton University, Ottawa, where he was elected president of the Engineering Society in his sophomore year. After his sophomore year he transferred to Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario, where he was elected president of the Engineering Society at the much larger university and graduated cum laude in engineering physics in 1960. Ross won a scholarship to pursue a master's degree at Purdue University's Krannert School of Management in Lafayette, Indiana. After receiving his M.S., he won a systems research scholarship to study Operations Research under Professor Russell Ackoff at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio. He completed his PhD in financial engineering in 1964, his focus was on the virgin area of stock options, 10 years before the CBOE existed.  Books by Ross Jackson  Ross has written articles and books on a variety of topics, including his personal transformation from businessman to environmental activist, on economics, on politics, on his spiritual journey, and a \\"documented novel\\" on the incredible life of Francis Bacon as the author of the Shakespeare works and the son of Queen Elizabeth I. One of Ross Jackson books Occupy World Street: A global roadmap for radical economic and political reform (Vermont, Chelsea Green, 2012) inspired the development of a new political party in Denmark. The founder of The Alternative Uffe Elb√¶k gives credit to Ross Jacksons book as one of the books that changed his political view and made him create the green political party.

It is the only representative of the monotypic genus Lindenia.  Description  Adults are easily recognizable due to their impressive body size with 69‚Äì80 mm length, the leaf-shaped flaps on the bottom side of the abdomen tip which are unique in European species, and wing venation. The flaps give the narrow and long abdomen club-shaped appearance. Basic color is pale yellow with dark brown or black markings of variable size. The pterostigma is also similarly colored. In south Croatia and Montenegro, it is possible to observe completely black individuals, which is probably a consequence of them developing in cold springs. The adults fly in the summer, from the end of May until August.  Habitat and distribution  A male and a female forming a copulatory \\"wheel\\" Bladetail breeds in larger lakes and larger, slowly flowing rivers. Adults tend to wander far from where they hatched, and may colonize new bodies of water, such as abandoned gravel pits, as a pioneer species. They are however more commonly found above lakes with wide reed beds or floating patches of aquatic plants in which the females oviposit. The species has a broad distribution range in most parts of Central and Southwest Asia, and eastern Mediterranean. However, it is scattered throughout the range, and higher population densities are only a local occurrence. In the Mediterranean, it is restricted to coastal plains. The largest local population is probably found on the banks of Lake Skadar on the border between Albania and Montenegro where a 2011 field census estimated one million individuals, but Lake Skadar is one of only two known sites in Montenegro where Bladetails are present. Individuals can occasionally wander as far north as SW Slovenia where one specimen was caught in the 1960s, but none have been observed since. The northernmost known breeding population in the Mediterranean lives on the Croatian island of Cres. Only individual sightings of males are known for North Africa, and the species' current status there is unknown.

He developed the manganese bronze alloy used extensively in the manufacture of ships' propellors. Early career Parsons was a son of John Parsons of Scraptoft, Leicestershire, and was born in London. Schooled privately in Shooter's Hill, he displayed an aptitude for engineering and, from the age of 15, studied for two years at Portsmouth Dockyard before being articled to Messrs. Braithwaite & Milner in London. In 1841, he was employed on railway engineering work by Peter Bruff, working as a resident engineer on the Eastern Counties Railway until 1845. In 1846, Parsons was employed on engineering work by John Rennie, engaged as superintendent of large fixed plant and machinery on the Eastern Union Railway. He then established his own engineering business in London in 1850, being mainly concerned with design and construction of railway fittings, patenting improved switches and axle-boxes.Obituary: Perceval Moses Parsons, Iron and Steel Institute, 1892.

Engineer =Central London railway= In 1853, Parsons developed proposals to construct a central London railway following the route of the modern day Metropolitan and District Lines, connecting with other London lines, and involving a large central station at Embankment Gardens. The proposal was approved by Robert Stephenson (appointed consulting engineer); John Hawkshaw was to be chief engineer, with Parsons among the acting engineers. However, the scheme was not developed due to the Crimean War (1853-1856). =Ordnance patent= Parson's ordnance inventions included a system of inserting rifled steel tubes into old cast-iron guns, making previously unusable weapons serviceable. An initial trial by the Ordnance Committee in 1860 was not favourable, and Parsons, believing his invention had been rejected, let his 1855 patent lapse. However, in 1862, William Palliser patented an almost identical system of converting guns, and Parsons reasserted his claim to be the original inventor of the system, eventually, following an adjudication by Charles Hutton, receiving ¬£1,000 compensation from the War Office. =Metallurgy= In 1871 Parsons was appointed engineer to the Bessemer Steel and Ordnance Co, and supervised construction of new works at East Greenwich. During this time he started studying the use of metals generally, establishing a private mechanical laboratory at his home in Blackheath. His experiments led to the production of a better compound of copper, tin, zinc and lead, called 'white brass', which was used for marine engines, and later 'manganese bronze' (combining ferro- manganese with bronze and brass alloys), which became extensively used in manufacture of ship propellers. Following an 1876 patent for manganese bronze, Parsons established his own company, P. M. Parsons, to produce the metal at St George's Wharf, in Deptford. On 28 June 1882, the Manganese Bronze and Brass Co was incorporated and acquired Parsons' company, retaining Parsons as one of the directors. Between 1851 and 1889 Parsons took out 52 patents, including 19 concerning artillery and related military appliances, 11 concerning railway apparatus, and one relating to metallurgy. He was elected a Member of the Institution of Civil Engineers on 2 December 1873. Personal life Parsons married Anne Jane Rexford (daughter of a school mistress running a school in Greenwich South Street) at St Alfege Church, Greenwich on 20 August 1851; they subsequently had 11 children. He died from an attack of apoplexy on 5 November 1892 at his home, Melbourne House at 136 Shooters Hill Road in Blackheath, and was buried in Greenwich Cemetery on 10 November 1892. His wife died, aged 78, on 26 June 1905 and was also buried in Greenwich Cemetery.

In Ku's first collection of short stories Noneun ingan (ÎÖ∏Îäî Ïù∏Í∞Ñ The Idle (2005), none of the characters works for wages. The main character of The Idle, the title story in the collection, is a novelist little more than a loafer. He sleeps until the middle of the day and spends much time gaming and little time writing.

In June 2020 Portland Black Lives Matter activists released demands after days of protesting including the dismissal of city manager Jon Jennings, to which Snyder responded by declaring \\"The city manager has my full support.\\" In June 2020 Snyder sought permission from city council to allow private citizens to paint a Black Lives Matter mural in front of Portland City Hall. In September Snyder apointed 13 members to a Racial Equity Steering Committee. https://www.newscentermaine.com/article/news/politics/portland- mayor-appoints-13-members-to-racial-equity-steering- committee/97-4494dfd8-cdc1-4e2f-9223-191f078db6d8 Personal Snyder earned her B.A. from Skidmore College in New York and a M.A. in Public Policy & Management from the Muskie School at the University of Southern Maine as well as a Certificate of Graduate Studies in Applied Research and Evaluation Methods.

The proposal was presented as the \\"quickest and simplest method\\" for a 2024 Moon landing. The lunar lander concept was not selected for funding by NASA as part of Artemis in the 30 April 2020 announcement. Overview Boeing Human Landing System was a proposal for the design of a lunar lander and lunar orbit spacecraft that would use the Space Launch System (SLS rocket) being developed by NASA to launch the lander into Earth orbit and then place it in lunar orbit where it would rendezvous with the NASA NASA Lunar Gateway and join up with a crew sent up in an Orion space capsule. This design concept was presented as a response to NASA's solicitation in May 2019, where about a dozen companies proposed lunar lander designs. The Boeing lander consists of a descent and ascent stage with the descent stage being able to deorbit the lander, which eliminates the need for a third transfer stage. The lander was explicitly designed to be launched on the Boeing-built SLS Block 1B rocket rather than assembled in space after multiple launches, reducing the number of mission-critical events from 11 to 5, and reducing mission complexity. The lander was to be designed such that it would not have to dock onto the Lunar Gateway and could dock with Orion directly in order to allow for a simpler mission profile. The lander was intended to reuse several technologies from Boeing's CST-100 Starliner, so that the pressure vessel, life support and avionics systems could be flight- tested and human-rated before being integrated into the lander. Intuitive Machines was selected to build and test the lander's engines and fuel tank structure. Aerojet Rocketdyne was also participating in the project.  Challenges  One problem with the lander is its high launch mass which required it to be launched by a SLS Block 1B. This variant of SLS is not expected to be operational until 2025 at the earliest. It was stated that the lander could be launched in parts with the descent stage launching on SLS Block 1 and the ascent stage launching on a commercial launcher and the two parts be assembled in lunar orbit in case Block 1B is not ready.

In this case, the European Commission asked Italy to abolish the tax on exportation of articles having an artistic, historic, archaeological or ethnographic value. Italy did not do so, claiming that the national law applied only to a specific category of goods. They argued that export restrictions could be justified on grounds of the protection of national treasures possessing artistic, historic or archaeological value. The European Court of Justice had to specify the scope of application of an EEC Treaty provision on customs union and define the term of goods. According to this ruling, the Court defined the concept of goods as products which can be valued in money and which are capable, as such, of forming the subject of commercial transactions. Therefore, the articles of an artistic, historic, archaeological or ethnographic nature fall under the concept of goods and under the provisions on customs union. In addition, every tax burden related to the free movement of goods was prohibited according to Article 12 EEC Treaty. This burden did not have to be necessarily characterized directly as ‚Äúcharge‚Äù but also burdens that substantially have equivalent effect to charges were not in compliance with Community law. Article 12 of the EEC Treaty specifically states that Member States shall refrain from introducing between themselves any new customs duties on imports or exports or any charges having equivalent effect  Facts  Law No 1089 of 1 June 1939 under Italian law on protection of articles of artistic or historic interest contained several provisions related to exportation of such articles. According to the circumstances, it could impose an absolute prohibition on exportation, require a license, vest a pre-emption right in the state, or impose a progressive tax on exportation ranging from 8% to 30%. In January 1960, the Commission asked the Italian Republic to abolish the tax in respect of the other Member states before 1 January 1962. The Commission considered the tax to have an equivalent effect to a customs duty on exportation and therefore was contrary to the Article 16 of the EEC Treaty. After a prolonged exchange of correspondence, on 25 February 1964 the Commission set in motion the procedure laid down by Article 169 of the EEC Treaty. It states that if the Commission considers that a Member State has failed to fulfil an obligation under this Treaty, it shall deliver a reasoned opinion on the matter after giving the State concerned the opportunity to submit its observations. The observations did not satisfy the Commission, which then by letter of 24 July 1964 delivered the reasoned opinion. The Commission stated its reasons for declaring that the Italian Republic had failed to fulfil the obligations imposed on it by Article 16, and gave it a time-limit of two months in which to abolish the disputed tax on transactions with other Member States. This time-limit was extended to 31 December 1965 after the Commission had been informed by the Italian Government that a parliamentary committee had been set up with the task of studying a system of protection which would take account of the Commission's observations. On 16 May 1966, the Commission, in reply to another request for an extension, informed the Italian Government that it had already granted an extension sufficient to allow for the abolition of the tax and that it reserved the right to bring the matter before the Court of Justice at the appropriate time. A draft law by the Italian Government to exempt exports to Member States of the Communities from payment of the tax was approved by the Italian Senate on 26 July 1967 and passed to the Chamber of Deputies. The draft law lapsed on dissolution of the Italian Parliament on 11 March 1968. Meanwhile, the Commission had brought proceedings before the Court of Justice by an application lodged on 7 March 1968. Content is copied from this source, which is ¬© European Union, 1995‚Äì2018. Reuse is authorised, provided the source is acknowledged.  Conclusions of the parties  The applicant (Commission) claims that the Court should: * declare that the Italian Republic has failed to fulfil the obligations imposed on it by Article 16 of the EEC Treaty by continuing to levy the progressive tax against other Member States * order the defendant to pay costs The defendant(Italian Republic) contends that the Court should: * dismiss the application by the Commission * order it to pay the costs  Grounds of judgment  = Admissibility = The defendant(Italian Republic) questioned the admissibility of the application. It submitted that the Commission disregarded the obligationimposed upon the Community institutions under Article 2, that is to 'promote throughout the Community a harmonious development of economic activities'. It supposedly did that by bringing the matter before the Court at a time when the Italian Parliament was on the point of being dissolved and therefore could not pass the draft law which would amend the provision in dispute. The Court ruled that the action of the Commission was admissible, because according to the Article 169 of the EEC Treaty, it is for the Commission to judge at what time it decides to bring an action before the Court. The consideration of time, in which the Commission decides to do so, cannot affect the admissibility of the action. Moreover, in this case the action of the Commission begun before the expiry of the second stage of the transitional period and was preceded by a prolonged exchange of views with the Italian Government. During the transitional period, the Commission tried to persuade the competent authorities in the Italian Republic to amend the provisions which were criticized by the Commission. = The substance of the case =  Scope of the disputed tax  Based on Article 16, the Commission considered articles of an artistic, historic, or archaeological nature, to fall under the provisions relating to the customs union. The Italian Republic on the other hand argued that these articles cannot be considered as 'ordinary merchandise' and for that reason they are excluded from the application of Article 16 of the Treaty. But under Article 9 of the Treaty, the customs union shall cover all trade in goods and the Court ruled that by \\"goods must be understood products which can be valued in money and which are capable, as such, of forming the subject of commercial transactions\\". By this logic all the articles covered by the Italian law that can be valued by money, are the subject of commercial transactions regardless of their characteristics. For this reason the rules of the Common Market apply to these goods and the only exceptions applicable are those expressly provided by the Treaty.  The classification of the disputed tax having regard to Article 16 of the Treaty  The Commission believed that the tax in this dispute had an equivalent effect to a customs duty, therefore violated the Article 16 of the Treaty and for this reason should have been abolished. Italian Republic argued, that this tax should not fall into this category, because its sole purpose was to ensure the protection of national historic and archaeological heritage, hence the tax did not have a fiscal nature. However, the Article 16 of the Treaty prohibits collection of customs duty in dealings between Member States and the Court ruled that altering the price of an article exported, has the same restrictive effect on the free circulation of that article as a customs duty. Under those circumstances the disputed tax falls within Article 16 because export trade was hindered by the burden which it imposed on the price of the exported articles.  The classification of the disputed tax having regard to Article 36 of the Treaty  The Italian Republic relied on the Article 36 of the Treaty as authorizing export restrictions, which are claimed to be justified on grounds of the protection of national treasures possessing artistic, historic or archaeological value. Article 36 of the Treaty provides that: \\"The provisions of Articles 30 to 34 shall not preclude prohibitions or restrictions on imports, exports justified on grounds of the protection of national treasures possessing artistic, historic or archaeological value.\\" It refers clearly and solely to prohibitions or restrictions, which are clearly distinguished from customs duties. The provisions of Article 36 do not relate to customs duties and charges having equivalent effect, therefore such measures cannot be used for objectives mentioned above. Consequently, the levy of the disputed tax, is incompatible with the provisions of the Treaty.

The trail is being designed for use by walkers, cyclists, equestrians, and cross-country skiers.  History  The Concord-Lake Sunapee Rail Trail sits on the former Claremont branch of the Boston and Maine Railroad. The line was originally part of the Concord and Claremont Railroad that connected Concord and Claremont, which was opened on September 21, 1848. The Boston & Maine Railroad took over the line in 1887 and called it the Claremont branch. Passenger service on the line ended in 1955. After World War II, with the decline of rail transportation and increased popularity of the automobile, the line fell into disuse, and the last freight train ran on the line in 1962. Some concrete signal bases, rail rests and mile markers can still be seen. The Friends of the Concord-Lake Sunapee Rail Trail formed in early 2018 and began negotiating easement rights on properties where the original right-of-way ran. Work is ongoing with various sections being completed.  Features  The Concord-Lake Sunapee Rail Trail travels along a flat and scenic landscape through wetlands, ponds, woods, farmlands, and for several miles travels along the Contoocook River. Improvements to completed trail sections include bench seating, informational kiosks, bicycle repair stations, historic mile-marker repairs, railroad bridge re-decking and vehicular gates.

Early life and education Sultana was born on 31 October 1993 in the West Midlands and raised in Lozells, Birmingham. She is a Muslim. Her grandfather moved to the West Midlands in the 1960s from Pakistan administered Kashmir. She attended Holte School, a non-selective community school. Sultana then studied at King Edward VI Handsworth School, a grammar school, for sixth form. She then went on to study International Relations and Economics at the University of Birmingham. She joined the Labour Party in 2011, whilst doing her A-levels, following the coalition government's decision to treble university tuition fees to ¬£9,000. While at university, Sultana was elected to the National Executive Council of both Young Labour and the National Union of Students. Parliamentary career Sultana was listed fifth of seven among the Labour candidates for the 2019 European Parliament elections in the West Midlands constituency, meaning that she would be elected if Labour received enough votes in the region to receive 5 MEPs. She was not elected, as Labour won 1 MEP in the constituency. In October 2019, she was selected as the Labour candidate for Coventry South after Labour MP Jim Cunningham announced that he would stand down. Her campaign was backed by Unite the Union, Momentum, the Fire Brigades Union, the Communication Workers Union and Bakers, Food and Allied Workers' Union. She is on the left-wing of the party. She was elected as MP for Coventry South in the 2019 general election, with a majority of 401. During the campaign, The Jewish Chronicle reported that in 2015, while she was a student, Sultana made social media posts from a subsequently deleted account which implied that she would celebrate the deaths of former Labour prime minister Tony Blair, Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former US president George W. Bush and she supported \\"violent resistance\\" by Palestinians. Sultana apologised for the posts and stated that she no longer held those views and \\"wrote them out of frustration rather than any malice\\". The Labour Party re-interviewed her as a consequence of the posts, and she remained the candidate. Subsequent to her election, a further social media post made by Sultana in 2015 was reported in which she stated that students supporting Zionism were \\"advocating a racist ideology...champion[ing] a state created through ethnic cleansing ...apartheid and war crimes.\\" In her maiden speech, she decried what she called \\"40 years of Thatcherism\\", criticised the effects of austerity, and voiced her support for a Green New Deal to combat climate change. She joined the Socialist Campaign Group shortly after being elected and in the 2020 Labour Party leadership election, nominated Rebecca Long-Bailey for leader and Richard Burgon for deputy leader. In January 2020, Sultana was appointed as Parliamentary Private Secretary to Dan Carden, the Shadow Secretary of State for International Development. She was removed from this role by Keir Starmer when he became leader.

The film was directed by Nora Lam and was first screened on 23 November 2017. Plot The film tracks Leung's life from his university education to his participation in various elections and protests. This includes his participation in the 2016 New Territories East by-election, where he won more than 60,000 votes; the 2016 Hong Kong legislative election, where he was disqualified, despite signing the confirmation form; and the 2016 Mong Kok civil unrest, where he was arrested with three charges of rioting. Development In an interview with Stand News, director Nora Lam said she was inspired to make films after watching ', a 2009 Hong Kong biopic. Lam noted that while she and Leung were both students at the University of Hong Kong's Faculty of Arts, she has never attempted to contact Leung, and her perception of Leung mainly came from depictions of him in mainstream media. Lost in the Fumes was the third documentary Lam made. Release The film was distributed by Ying e Chi, a company founded by independent filmmaker Vincent Chui in 1997 which has distributed several films relating to the 2014 Hong Kong protests. The film was first screened on 23 November 2017 at the Hong Kong Arts Centre. Tickets for the film's two premieres were sold out in two hours, and the film has since been popular at many screenings at colleges, universities, arts and community venues, including the Hong Kong Film Archive, and the Hong Kong Science Museum. However, as of May 2018, no mainstream cinema in Hong Kong was willing to screen the film, renewing fears about the continued erosion of freedom of speech and self-censorship in Hong Kong. Time magazine, in recognition of Edward Leung on its \\"100 Next\\" list, called the film essential viewing for participants of the 2019‚Äì20 Hong Kong protests. Protesters frequently screened the film during the 2019 protests in order to raise public awareness of protest activities. In Singapore, the film was classified as M18, which meant that the film was restricted to persons aged 18 or above, because of \\"political sensitivities,\\" and was only screened to members of the Singapore Film Society. Reception The film won a merit award at the 2017 Hong Kong Film Critics Society Awards. At the 2018 Taiwan International Documentary Festival, the film received a Special Award for Chinese-language documentaries.

Dryzek, Norgaard, and Schlosberg suggest that critical reflection on the history of climate policy is necessary because it provides 'ways to think about one of the most difficult issues we human beings have brought upon ourselves in our short life on the planet‚Äô. Climate change emerged as a political issue in the 1970s, where activist and formal efforts were taken to ensure environmental crises were addressed on a global scale. International policy regarding climate change has focused on cooperation and the establishment of international guidelines to address global warming. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) is a largely accepted international agreement that has continuously developed to meet new challenges. Domestic policy on climate change has focused on both establishing internal measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and incorporating international guidelines into domestic law. In the late 20th and 21st century, climate change policy moved away from attempts to mitigate the impact of global warming and towards adapting to unavoidable changes to the human environment. There has also been a shift towards vulnerability based policy for those most impacted by environmental anomalies. Over the history of climate policy, concerns have been raised about the treatment of developing nations and a lack of gender specific action.  Activism  alt= Since the early 1970s, climate activists have called for more effective political action regarding global warming and other environmental anomalies. In 1970, Earth Day was the first large-scale environmental movement that called for the protection of all life on earth. The Friends of Earth organisation was also founded in 1970. Between 2006 and 2009, the Campaign against Climate Change and other British organisations staged a series of demonstrations to encourage governments to make more serious attempts to address climate change. In 2019, activists, most of whom were young people, participated in a global climate strike to criticise the lack of international and political action to address the worsening impacts of climate change. Greta Thunberg, a 17-year-old activist from Sweden, became a figurehead for the movement.  Origins of Political Concern  In the mid-1970s, climate change shifted from a solely scientific issue to a point of political concern. The formal political discussion of climate change began in June 1973 with the UN Conference on the Human Environment (UNCHE) in Stockholm. The UNCHE identified the need for states to work cooperatively to solve environmental issues on a global scale. Logo for the IPCC The first World Climate Conference in 1979 framed climate change as a global political issue, giving way to similar conferences in 1985, 1987, and 1988. In 1985, the Advisory Group on Greenhouse Gases (AGGG) was formed to offer international policy recommendations regarding climate change and global warming. At the Toronto Conference in 1988, climate change was suggested to be almost as serious as nuclear war and early targets for CO2 emission reductions were discussed. The United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP) and the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) jointly established the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in 1988. A succession of political summits in 1989, namely the Francophone Summit in Dakar, the Small Island States meeting, the G7 Meeting, the Commonwealth Summit, and the Non- Aligned Meeting, addressed climate change as a global political issue.  International Policy  Through the creation of multilateral treaties, agreements, and frameworks, international policy on climate change seeks to establish a world wide response to the impacts of global warming and environmental anomalies. Historically, these efforts culminated in attempts to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions on a country-by-country basis. alt= In 1992, the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) was held in Rio de Janeiro. The UNCED (also referred to as the Earth Summit) introduced the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development, Agenda 21, the Forestry Principles and the Convention on Biological Diversity. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) was also introduced during the conference. The UNFCCC established the concept of common but differentiated responsibilities, defined Annex 1 and Annex 2 countries, highlighted the needs of vulnerable nations, and established a precautionary approach to climate policy. In accordance with the Convention, the first Conference of the Parties (COP-1) was held in Berlin in 1995. In 1997, the third Conference of the Parties (COP-3) passed the Kyoto Protocol, which contained the first legally binding greenhouse gas reduction targets. The Kyoto Protocol required Annex 1 countries to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 5% from 1990 levels between 2008 and 2012. Adoption of Paris Agreement in 2015 At the 13th Conference of the Parties (COP-13) in 2007, the Bali Action Plan was implemented to promote a shared vision for the Copenhagen Summit. The Action Plan called for Annex 2 nations to adopt Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Actions (NAMAs).United Nations Development Programme. (2008). The Bali Action plan: key issues in the climate negotiations: Summary for Policy Makers. Retrieved from http://content- ext.undp.org/aplaws_assets/2512309/2512309.pdf The Bali Conference also raised awareness for the 20% of global greenhouse gas emissions caused by deforestation. In 2009, the Copenhagen Accord was created at the 15th Conference of the Parties (COP-15) in Copenhagen, Denmark. Although not legally binding, the Accord established an agreed-upon goal to keep global warming below two degrees Celsius. The Paris Agreement was adopted at the 21st Conference of the Parties (COP-21) on the 12th of December 2015. It entered into force on the 4th of November 2016. The agreement addressed greenhouse- gas-emissions mitigation, adaptation, and finance. Its language was negotiated by representatives of 196 state parties at COP-21. As of March 2019, 195 UNFCCC members have signed the agreement and 187 have become party to the agreement. In November 2019, a coalition of 11,000 scientists declared that a worldwide climate emergency exists. Climate change: ‚ÄòClear and unequivocal‚Äô emergency, say scientists, By Matt McGrath, Environment correspondent, 6 November 2019, bbc.com  Domestic Action  Domestic policy regarding climate change has historically combined the incorporation of international guidelines and the creation of state-specific goals, legislation and programs to address global warming and environmental anomalies at a state level. = Climate change policy in Australia = Domestic action to address climate change in Australia began in 1989, when Senator Graham Richardson proposed the first greenhouse gas emission reduction target of 20% by 2005.Talberg, A., Hui, S. and Loynes, K., 2015. Australian Climate Change Policy: A Chronology. Canberra: Parliamentary Library. The Australian Government rejected this target. In 1990, Ros Kelly and Jon Kerin announced that the Australian Government would adhere to the goals initially proposed by Richardson but not to any economic detriment.Kelly, R. and Kerin, J., Government sets targets for reductions in greenhouse gases, joint statement, 11 October 1990. Australia signed the UNFCCC in 1992. This was followed by the release of the National Greenhouse Response Strategy (NGRS), which provided states and territories with the mechanisms to adhere to UNFCCC emission guidelines. Australia attended the first UNFCCC Conference of the Parties in Berlin in March 1995. Throughout the 1990s, Australia regularly failed to meet its own emission targets and those set by the UNFCCC. In 1997, Prime Minister John Howard announced that by 2010, an additional 2% of electricity would be sustainably sourced.Howard, J., 1997. Safeguarding the Future: Australia‚Äôs Response to Climate Change. Canberra: House of Representatives. The following year, the Australian Greenhouse Office (AGO) was established to monitor greenhouse gas reductions. The AGO later combined with the Department of Environment and Heritage. In April 1998, Australia became a party to the Kyoto Declaration. The Declaration was ratified in 2007 under Prime Minister Kevin Rudd. In the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Act 2000, the Federal Government introduced the Mandatory Renewable Energy Target program, which aimed to sustainably source 10% of electrical energy by 2010. In 2011, the Mandatory Renewable Energy Target program was divided into the Large-Scale Renewable Energy Target and the Small-Scale Renewable Energy Scheme. In January 2003, the New South Wales State Government implemented the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Scheme (GGRS), which allowed carbon emissions to be traded. Protests against the CPRS in 2009 Under Rudd, the Labor Government proposed the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, which was intended to take effect in 2010. This scheme was rejected by the Greens for being too permissive and by Tony Abbott‚Äôs Coalition for being economically detrimental. Under Prime Minister Julia Gillard, the Labor Party passed the Clean Energy Act 2011 to establish a carbon tax and put a price on greenhouse gas emissions. This carbon tax was a divisive partisan issue. In 2012, the Coalition ran a campaign to repeal the carbon tax. Upon election victory in September 2013, Prime Minister Tony Abbott passed the Clean Energy Legislation (Carbon Tax Repeal) Bill. In replacement of the carbon tax, Abbott introduced the Direct Action Scheme to financially reward businesses for voluntarily reducing their carbon emissions. This was followed by a decision not to participate in the 19th Conference of UNFCCC Parties (COP-19). Australia became a party to the Paris Agreement in 2015. In the agreement, Australia committed to reducing its emissions by 26% by 2030. In 2019, Prime Minister Scott Morrison was criticised for a lack of commitment to addressing climate change while taking a vacation during the 2019 bushfires. = Climate change policy in the USA = From the mid-1980s, the United States attempted to promote climate action at an international level. The USA ratified the Montreal Protocol of 1987 in a 1990 amendment to the Clean Air Act. In 1993, the Clinton Administration commissioned the Climate Change Action Plan, which lacked both funding and parliamentary support and relied on voluntary compliance. 203x203px The Kyoto Protocol was never submitted for ratification in the US. This was because a previous Senate resolution suggested that it would not be ratified. In 2001, President George W. Bush cited economic concerns as a reason for his withdrawal from the Kyoto Protocol. Instead, the administration set an 18% reduction target over the next 10 years. In 2013, the Obama Administration created the Climate Action Plan, which aimed to cut 32% of carbon emissions from electrical power plants. In December 2015, the USA became party to the Paris Agreement. President Trump announced his intention to withdraw from the agreement in 2017. This was formalised in 2019, when Trump officially notified the United Nations of the impending US withdrawal. As of 2017, 20 states have pledged to abide with the terms of the Paris Agreement regardless of federal withdrawal.  Trends  = Adaptation = In the early 21st century, policy approaches shifted from mitigation, aiming to reduce the environmental impact of human behaviour, to adaptation. Adaptation based policy focuses on adjusting environmental and human systems to respond to the predicted impacts of global warming. According to Klein, Schipper and Dessai, adaptation is necessary to accommodate permanent changes to the human environment that, regardless of mitigation attempts, cannot be reversed. Haibach and Schneider suggest that climate policy continues to move towards ‚Äòcrisis management and plans for preventative measures‚Äô.Haibach, H. and Schneider, K., 2013. The Politics of Climate Change: Review and Future Challenges. In: O. Ruppel, C. Roschmann and K. Ruppel-Schlichting, ed., Climate Change: International Law and Global Governance: Volume II: Policy, Diplomacy and Governance in a Changing Environment, 1st ed. Baden-Baden: Nomos Verlagsgesellschaft mbH, p.372. Ford also states that the UNFCCC has evolved to address ‚Äòexposure to predicted climate change impacts‚Äô by stressing the need to adapt.Map of the global south, which is more impacted by climate change policy = Vulnerability based policy = Vulnerability based policy is regionally or socioeconomically specific policy aimed at reducing the disproportionate impacts of climate change on certain groups. This policy is emerging in developing countries in the global south, where communities are more impacted by climate change and environmental disasters. In the Kyoto Protocol, the Least Developed Country fund and Special Climate Change fund were established to improve development and adaptation in regions least equipped to manage the consequences of climate change. This form of policy has also been linked to sustainable development in developing countries. In vulnerable arctic regions, climate policy has increasingly focused on addressing changing weather patterns, animal demography and sea ice levels. = Partisan division = In the late 2000s, the political discourse regarding climate change policy became increasingly polarising. The political right has largely opposed drastic climate policy while the political left has favoured progressive action to address environmental anomalies. In a 2016 study, Dunlap, McCright, and Yarosh note the ‚Äòescalating polarisation of environmental protection and climate change‚Äô discourse in the USA. In 2020, the partisan gap in public opinion regarding the importance of climate change policy was the widest in history. The Pew Research Center found that, in 2020, 78% of Democrats and 21% of Republicans in the USA saw climate policy as a top priority to be addressed by the President and Congress. In Europe, there is growing tension between right-wing interest in migration and left-wing climate advocacy as primary political concerns. The validity of climate change research and climate scepticism have also become partisan issues.  Controversy  = Disproportionate impact on developing nations = Developing nations have commented that climate change and climate change policy disproportionately impact vulnerable states. Ford mentions that international climate policy does not adequately address the different needs and capacities of Annex 1 and Annex 2 states. The New Delhi Declaration of Principles of International Law Relating to Sustainable Development (2002) suggests that developing countries are both more impacted by and less equipped to address climate change. The Declaration also restates the concept of common but differentiated responsibilities. Gupta suggests that these disproportionate impacts justify lowering emission reduction targets for developing nations. Critics of equity-based policy have argued that it is ‚Äúunfair‚Äù to create differentiated emission targets. = Gender = alt= There is debate over whether policy has addressed the gendered impacts of climate change.Hemmati, M. and R√∂hr, U., 2008. Solidarity In The Greenhouse: Gender Equality And Climate Change. In: V. Grover, ed., Global Warming and Climate Change: Ten Years after Kyoto and Still Counting, 1st ed. Boca Raton: Enfield, N.H.: Science Publishers, pp.779-804. R√∂hr and Hemmati suggest that climate policy does not consider how mechanisms and instruments for change impact women. This inequality is prominent in the global south.Dankelman, I. 2012. Climate change, human security and gender. In Gender and climate change: An introduction (pp. 83-105). Routledge. A UNEP report suggests that women are more impacted by climate change and climate policy because they have less access to resources and because environmental disasters amplify preexisting 'power imbalances' in the global south. This report also recommends that climate policy should include adaptation programs aimed at improving women's mobility and access to resources during environmental disasters. Gender sensitive climate innovations have also been recommended to address the needs and concerns of women in developing nations. R√∂hr and Hemmati also state that women have been underrepresented in climate discourses. A UNEP report states that 'a lack of meaningful participation by women' in local and regional climate movements is having a negative impact on the mobilisation of communities.Habtezion, S., 2012. Overview Of Linkages Between Gender And Climate Change. [online] New York: United Nations Development Programme. Available at: <https://www.undp.org/content/dam/undp/library/gender/Gender%20and%20Environment/PB1_Africa_Overview- Gender-Climate-Change.pdf> In a similar study, Buckingham and K√ºlc√ºrl conclude that climate action groups and coalitions do not mirror mainstream gender diversity.

Despite several attempts of recovery, the abbey continued to decline. In 1790, the Revolutionaries ousted the only remaining monk and destroyed the abbey. Although the abbey was still visible on the cadastral plan in 1808, the site was turned into a quarry in the 19th century. No remnants of the abbey are visible today.

She founded and chaired the aerodynamics program at Beihang University, the first in the country.  Early life and education  Lu Shijia and Zhang Wei on board a ship to Europe She was born Lu Xiuzhen () in Suzhou (Soochow) on March 18, 1911, the final year of the Qing dynasty. Her ancestral home was Xiaoshan, Zhejiang. Soon after she was born, her grandfather , who served as Governor of Shanxi, and her father , were both killed by Yan Xishan during the Xinhai Revolution. Her superstitious mother blamed the baby for her father's death, and gave her away to be raised by a paternal uncle. She attended the primary school and the High School Attached to Beijing Normal University, where Qian Xuesen and her future husband Zhang Wei were her classmates. Inspired by Marie Curie, she entered the Physics Department of Beijing Normal University as the only female student. After graduating in 1933, she taught at the Fifth Women's Normal School in Daming, Hebei, and Zhicheng Middle School in Beijing. With financial help from her maternal uncle, the renowned doctor Shi Jinmo, Lu went to study in Germany in 1937. She studied at G√∂ttingen University and received her Ph.D. in fluid mechanics in 1942. Her supervisor was Ludwig Prandtl, one of the founders of modern fluid mechanics. She was the only Chinese student and the only female graduate student of Prandtl.  Career  After the end of the Second World War, Lu returned to China in 1946. She taught at Tongji University, the Aeronautics Department of Peiyang University, and the Institute of Hydraulic Engineering of Tsinghua University. She joined the China Democratic League in 1951. In 1952, Lu became a member of the preparatory committee for the establishment of the Beijing Institute of Aeronautics (now Beihang University). In 1962, she founded Beihang's aerodynamics program, the first in China, and served as its first chair. At Beihang she helped create China's first high-speed wind tunnel. When the Chinese Academy of Sciences resumed its election for academicians in 1980 after the end of the Cultural Revolution, Lu was nominated twice, but she declined both times and insisted on giving the opportunity to a younger scientist. She was a member of the first, second, and third National People's Congresses, the fifth and sixth CPPCC Standing Committees, the Standing Committee of the China Democratic League Central Committee, and the Executive Committee of the All-China Women's Federation. She also served as Vice Chair of the China Aerodynamics Research Association.  Personal life  Lu Shijia and husband Zhang Wei, circa 1941 In 1941, Lu married scientist Zhang Wei, her elementary school classmate, in Germany. Zhang was a member of both the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Chinese Academy of Engineering, and served as Vice President of Tsinghua University. The couple had a son, Zhang Kecheng (), and a daughter, Zhang Kequn (). Kequn's son Gao Xiaosong is a renowned musician.  Death and legacy  Lu died in Beijing in August 1986, and her husband died in 2001. According to their will, their children mixed their ashes together and dispersed them in the lotus pond on the Tsinghua campus. On the first anniversary of her death, Qian Xuesen presided over a scientific symposium held in her memory. On March 18, 2017, Lu's 106th birthday, Beihang University established the Lu Shijia Laboratory, the first university laboratory in China named after a female scientist.

(He is also identified in some sources under the pseudonym that he sometimes used as \\"Junius\\".) His emigration from what had become, by 1939, part of Nazi Germany, appears to have been undertaken as a result of his (hitherto, to most people, unknown) Jewish provenance. During the 1930s his work had a German-nationalist focus, and dealt in particular with ethnic and religious minorities. After 1945 his contributions became more theoretical and less overtly political. Life =Provenance and early years= Emerich Klaus Franzis was born at Gablonz (as Jablonec nad Nisou was known before 1945), a midsized trading and manufacturing town northeast of Prague, in the mountain foothills of northern Bohemia, which at that time was part of the Austro-Hungarian empire. Both his parents had converted from Judaism before he was born: that was something of which he remained unaware through much of his childhood. He grew up in a Catholic home in Innsbruck, however. This meant that despite being born in what became, after 1918, Czechoslovakia, he was nevertheless able to retain his Austrian citizenship after the postwar break-up of Austria-Hungary. After passing his school final exams he was briefly apprenticed as a typesetter. He then studied for two terms during 1924/25 at the University of Innsbruck where he embarked on courses at the Philosophy and Arts (\\"Philosophisch-Kulturwissenschaften\\") Faculties. In 1926 he moved on to Prague where he studied a wide range of subjects, including Germanistics, Philosophy, Pedagogy, Psychology, Social History and what then counted as Mainstream History. His student years were concluded with a period at the University of M√ºnster where, subsequently, he took a junior academic post as a research assistant at the \\"German Institute for Foreign Trade\\" (\\"... Institut f√ºr Auslandkunde\\") which he would retain for three years, between 1930 and 1933. =Student years, local journalism and escape= Prague University during the 1920s and 1930s was the focus of intensifying nationationalist polarisation: as a student there Francis joined the \\"Hochschulbund des Staffelstein\\", an elite Catholic-Nationalist \\"Volksdeutsche\\" association that opposed Czechoslovak nationalism. He openly rejected his Jewish provenance, presenting himself instead as a committed Roman Catholic and German nationalist. Meanwhile, in 1930 he received his doctorate from Prague University for a dissertation on the educational aspects of Bernard Bolzano's work. As a postgraduate student in Prague he also supported himself both through journalism and by working as a home tutor to families from the Bohemian nobility. During 1933, which was his final year in M√ºnster, he worked as an assistant to Georg Schreiber, a church historian and (since 1905) ordained priest who, till the National Socialist take-over, combined his career as a university professor with an active role as a (Catholic) Centre Party politician. After this he returned to Bohemia where he worked till early 1939 as editor in chief, at the \\"Volkszeitung\\" (a Catholic newspaper) based in Warnsdorf which was linguistically and ethnically still, at this stage, a German town, despite having been politically part of Czechoslovakia since 1919. During 1935 Emerich Francis married Gisela Schweizer from nearby Leitmeritz. The couple's son was born in March 1939, but Emerich Francis only met his boy in 1947 when the family were reunited in the United States. In September 1938 the region was incorporated into the newly enlarged German state as the \\"Reichsgau Sudetenland\\". In 1938 Francis was still insisting on his Catholicism but by early 1939, unable any longer to conceal his Jewish provenance, Emerich Francis fled to the South Tyrol (Alto Adige), which since 1919 had been part of Italy. From Italy he made his way to England. =Exile, internment and Manitoba= In England, Francis lived for some months in seclusion at Prinknash Abbey, in a Benedictine monastery near Gloucester. One source indicates that he was hoping to become a monk or a priest. However, in May 1940, eight months after the outbreak of the Second World War, but just a few days after the German army invaded France, the British government invoked legislation that triggered a massive round-up of so-called \\"enemy aliens\\". Those hastily arrested included several thousand Jewish refugees from Nazi Germany. He was extracted from his monastic refuge, becomings one of several thousand foreigners hastily placed in internment camps, at some stage incarcerated on the Isle of Man. As the summer progressed the internment policy became progressively more controversial with members of the British political class: many foreign internees were shipped overseas. Francis was one of those now sent for internment to Sherbrooke, Quebec. He was released in 1942, initially employed as an \\"agricultural worker\\", and ending up at the trappist monastery in the St. Norbert neighbourhood of Winnipeg, capital of the mid-western Canadian province of Manitoba. Several sources describe his professional career over the next couple of years as \\"adventurous\\". He was employed variously as an orphanage care assistant, a gardner and a bank clerk. At one point, taking advantage of his vocational training during the 1920s, he was able to take skilled work as a typesetter. In his spare time he studied to master the English language and, later, to familiarize himself with the (still, especially in Canada, relatively underdeveloped) Anglo-American world of Social science. =Relaunch of an academic career= During 1945 Francis briefly taught German at United College (today the University of Winnipeg)). He also helped out at the Political sciences department. As matters turned out, this marked a return to the academic life for which he had been trained before 1933. Later that year the Historical and Scientific Society of Manitoba asked Francis to undertake a detailed study of one of the ethnic groups in Manitoba. For a number of reasons he selected the Russian Mennonites, an Anabaptist religious group, committed to pacifism, many of whom still spoke a version of Low German, known as Plautdietsch, as their first language. Since his release from internment in 1942 Francis had already come across various Mennonite communities. He was able to receive help from others, notably the scholar-businessman (and \\"fervent Mennonite\\") Ted Friesen, who dedicated a considerable amount of time to driving Francis round the countryside, between the East and West Mennonite \\"reserves\\". Friesen later recalled that although Francis was, on most occasions, perfectly able to understand the Plautdietsch dialect he encountered during his researches, he always insisted on conducting his interviews in High German.Francis was able to devote himself full-time to the project, since the Historical and Scientific Society, which had commissioned the work, backed him with a fellowship which provided support from September 1945 till March 1947. He also continued to teach German and assist the embryonic sociology department at the university. While undertaking his study Francis was able to cultivate the Winnipeg historian William Lewis Morton, with whom he had much in common personally and politically. Morton became an ally in the search to try and find a publisher for the substantial book that the research work could support. In the event the book in question was published only in 1955 due to issues over permissions (from the Historical Society that had sponsored the research) to publish and a succession of disagreements with the University of Toronto Press on matters such as the inclusion of large numbers of (expensive to reproduce) tables and appendices, along with the ticklish question of whether and how much the original manuscript might be edited down. Nevertheless, long before that the Mennonite research had formed the basis for several well based academic papers. Even though many of the audiences from the Historical and Scientific society to whom he presented his findings were more appreciative of the historical narratives included in his work than in the extensive demographic, ecological and institutional analyses, many of them delivered by means of a formidable battery of number based charts and tables, by 1947 Francis was already establishing himself in North America as a social scientist of note. The subject was not yet widely taught outside continental Europe, but that would change during the 1950s and 1960s. =Indiana= In 1947 Francis accepted an assistant professorship at the Catholic University of Notre Dame, located across the border at South Bend, Indiana. The brief was \\"to help develop a doctoral programme in sociology\\". There is more than a hint that the appointment resulted as much from personal networking as from the reputation Francis was establishing at Winnipeg. The Notre Dame dean had come across Francis in the early 1930s at the University of M√ºnster and, it would appear, been appropriately impressed. During nearly twelve years at Notre Dame, Francis continued to publish articles on sociology, choosing high-profile academic journals in America, Britain and West Germany, which did much to establish him, in the words of one commentator, \\"as a sociological scholar of stature\\". In 1950 he accepted an extraordinary professorship and in 1954 a full professorship from Notre Dame. In 1954 Francis took US citizenship. This was also the year in which he undertook his first visit to Europe since 1939. He was able to re-establish contact with friends from his school days in Innsbruck and from the years he had spent in Bohemia. It is clear from a letter he wrote to a friend on 1 February 1955 that the trip left him profoundly homesick. During the next two years he took on visiting professorships at the Universities of both Innsbruck and Munich.Universit√§tsarchiv LMU M√ºnchen, Sen-I-250, Lebenslauf Prof. Francis vom 21.12.1955. =Munich= In 1955 Francis applied for the newly instituted Chair in Sociology at the University of Munich. The chair came with the opportunity to create the university's new Institute of Sociology. His appointment was opposed by the Bavarian Minister for Education and Culture, August Rucker. Even after the minister's favoured candidate turned down the position, Rucker continued to oppose the appointment of Emerich Francis to it. The vacancy as envisaged remained unfilled: Alfred von Martin administered the new sociology department, but von Martin was by now in his mid-70s and contributions he made between 1955 and 1958 appear to have made relatively little impression. In the end it took a change of government to open the way for Francis. The coalition government of Wilhelm Hoegner fell in October 1957 and Rucker lost his ministerial position. Emerich Francis took up the teaching chair in sociology at the University of Munich.Universit√§tsarchiv LMU M√ºnchen, E-II-1349, Bayer.Staatsmin. f√ºr Unterricht und Kultus an Francis am 18.11.1957; dortauch Berufungsurkunde vom16.9.1958. Francis remained in post at Munich till his retirement in 1974. Admirers record with obvious regret that his \\"list of publications in journals after 1958 is rather sparse\\". In 1967 his responsibilities were added to when he accepted a part-time Honorarprofessor position at the University of Innsbruck. There is a sense that setting up the new Institute of Sociology and the quantity of teaching he found himself doing left little time either for writing or for \\"hiking in the Alps\\" beyond Garmisch.

It was the comics industry's first miniseries. World of Krypton was published by DC Comics from July to September 1979. Taking place in the Silver Age era of DC Comics history, the series explores Superman's home world of Krypton. The story details his father Jor-El's life, the launch of the rocket that carried Kal-El to Earth, and the destruction of the planet. Background and creation \\"The Fabulous World of Krypton\\" had been a recurring back-up feature in Superman and other titles since the early 1970s. The feature was created by E. Nelson Bridwell and many stories were written by Cary Bates. The stories comprising World of Krypton were originally scheduled to be published in Showcase #104-106 to coincide with the premiere of the 1978 film Superman: The Movie. (Those issues would have had cover-dates of Sept. 1978‚ÄìNov. 1978.) When the film's release date was delayed (with it eventually coming out in December 1978), the stories were rescheduled for Showcase issues #110-112 (cover dates Apr.‚ÄìMay 1979). In the meantime, however, the Showcase title was canceled as part of the so-called \\"DC Implosion.\\" At that point, the storyline was revised and released as World of Krypton ‚Äî comics' first ever limited series.McCue, Greg S. with Clive Bloom. Dark Knights, the New Comics in Context (Pluto Press, 1993), p. 61.Goulart, Ron. Over 50 Years of American Comic Books (Mallard Press, 1991), p. 292. Bridwell commissioned the project. Paul Kupperberg, a regular contributor to Showcase at the time of the story's conception, wrote the storyline. His brother Alan Kupperberg did uncredited layouts, upon which Chaykin expanded.  Plot  World of Krypton provides a great amount of detail into Krypton's history just before its destruction, along with the life story of Jor-El, the world's leading scientist, and his wife Lara Lor-Van. Superman himself appears in framing sequences, as do notable Kryptonians such as General Zod, Jax-Ur, Faora Hu-Ul, Lar Gand, and Beppo; as well as Clark Kent's adoptive parents Jonathan and Martha Kent. The individual issues were titled, \\"The Jor-El Story,\\" \\"This Planet Is Doomed!\\", and \\"The Last Days of Krypton,\\" respectively.  Reception and legacy  World of Krypton's reception was positive, leading to subsequent similar titles and later more ambitious productions like Camelot 3000 for the direct market in 1982. World of Krypton was reprinted and translated on a number of occasions. It was republished, in part or in whole, in Superman the Comic #2 (K.G. Murray Publishing Company, 1978), The Best of DC #5 (May-June 1980), and Tor Books' World of Krypton (June 1982). It has been translated into German, French, Swedish, Norwegian, Portuguese, and Italian. DC published another World of Krypton miniseries from December 1987 to March 1988. Produced after the retcon events of Crisis on Infinite Earths, Krypton itself was the main subject of the latter The World of Krypton miniseries. Written by John Byrne and illustrated by Mike Mignola, it fills in much of Krypton's new history.  Collected editions  In 2018, DC published the trade paperback Superman: The Many Worlds of Krypton, which collected both World of Krypton miniseries as well as stories from Superman #233, 236, 238, 240, 248, 257, 266, and Superman Family #182.

Background  The French and German parliaments had previously held a joint session on occasion of the 40th anniversary of the √âlys√©e Treaty, a key document for France‚ÄìGermany relations after World War II, in January 2003. First steps for an inter-parliamentary organisation were laid with regular meetings of parliament committees during 2018. This led to the Aachen Treaty, signed by Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron on 22 January 2019. Subsequent talks between and representatives ultimately resulted in an inter- parliamentary agreement to create a new parliamentary assembly, which was approved separately by both legislatures. The assembly's first session was held on 25 March 2019 in Paris after the agreement was signed by Wolfgang Sch√§uble and Richard Ferrand, each parliament's president.  Purpose  The parliamentary assembly does not have the capacity to make binding resolutions or legislation, nor any budgetary authority. Its goal is to discuss matters of French-German cooperation, such as the ratification of the Aachen Treaty, cross-border development projects, and the implementation of EU Directives. Other topics for discussion include foreign, defence and security policy. Sessions are held twice per year, alternating between Paris and Berlin.  Membership  The joint assembly is composed of 100 members, 50 sent by each parliament. The President of the Bundestag and President of the National Assembly are its chairpersons. An administrative bureau (, ) led by Sabine Thillaye (France) and Andreas Jung (Germany) was formed.

She was an expert on Cham√° pottery: polychrome, cylindrical vases produced in the eighth century CE in the highlands of what is now Guatemala. After earning BA, MA, and PhD degrees from the University of Pennsylvania, Danien worked at the Penn Museum, where she conducted and published research, developed exhibits, initiated public outreach events including \\"Member's Nights\\" and an annual \\"Maya Weekend\\", and later, after retirement, volunteered as a docent. She co-founded the Museum's Pre-Columbian Society, which gathered professional and amateur scholars interested in indigenous peoples of the Americas. As a philanthropist, she founded a scholarship program called Bread Upon the Waters which gave women over age thirty the opportunity to pursue and complete undergraduate degrees at the University of Pennsylvania through part-time study. A colleague remembered her as someone who was \\"more than a force of nature,\\" and who often claimed that, \\"Archaeology is the most fun you can have with your pants on.\\"  Education and career  Born in New York City July 17, 1929, Elin Corey Danien became interested in Central America and its pre-Columbian culture when she hitchhiked to Mexico as a young woman and stayed in the region for two years. She later worked as an advertising copywriter in New York and then, in the early 1970s, moved to Philadelphia. Danien earned her BA degree from the University of Pennsylvania in Anthropology in 1982, summa cum laude, by which time she was fifty-three years old. She went on to earn an MA degree and, in 1998, her PhD, also from Penn. For her doctoral dissertation, she studied the Penn Museum's collection of Cham√° pottery, which the archaeologist Robert Burkitt had excavated between 1912 and 1937. With her husband, Wilton R. \\"Bud\\" Danien (who died in 2013), Danien traveled to Guatemala in 1979 and found many of the records and papers of Robert Burkitt in the stables of a ranch in Cob√°n. With the ranch owner's permission, Danien took the papers back to Philadelphia and deposited them in the archives of the Penn Museum, for researchers to consult. Danien worked as Events Coordinator for the Penn Museum from 1981 to 1989. She also started the annual Maya Weekend, which ran from 1983 to 2013, and which exposed Museum visitors to Mayan epigraphy (reading Mayan glyphs). Later, recognizing her work as a volunteer and her connection to the Penn Museum for more than forty years, the Penn Museum recognized her as its Volunteer of the Year for 2015. She died February 19, 2019.Obituaries, The Pennsylvania Gazette, Aug. 28, 2019; accessed 2020.02.12  Scholarship and publications  Danien earned an Anthropology PhD for her 1998 dissertation entitled \\"The Chama Polychrome Ceramic Cylinders in the University of Pennsylvania Museum\\", which she wrote under the supervision of Robert J. Sharer. The Penn Museum's specimens were especially valuable for study, she argued, because they \\"constitute the only museum collection of Chama polychrome cylinders with provenience information.\\" Her approach was interdisciplinary, combining approaches from archaeology, art history, epigraphy, ethnohistory, and more. Danien compiled and edited a collection of Maya folktales, published in 2005 as Maya Folktales from the Alta Verapaz. This volume gathered stories that anthropologists and folklorists had recorded in Guatemala in the early twentieth century, including tales of the Popul Vuh, the ancient Maya creation legend. Danien also published several articles in the Penn Museum's magazine, Expedition. Her research formed the basis of an exhibit at the Penn Museum in 2009; it was called Painted Metaphors: Pottery and Politics of the Ancient Maya. She prepared a guide to the Penn Museum's Mesoamerican collections, and also edited a volume of conference papers on Alexander the Great and his father, Philip of Macedon.  Philanthropy  In 1986, Danien founded a scholarship program at the University of Pennsylvania called Bread upon the Waters. The program took its name from a verse from the Bible ‚Äì Ecclesiastes 11:1, \\"Cast thy bread upon the waters: for thou shalt find it after many days\\" ‚Äì a statement often understood to mean that doing good for and sharing with others reaps rewards of its own. In 2009, the Charlotte W. Newcombe Foundation established a partnership with Penn to fund three of the twenty-five \\"Bread\\" scholarships that were intended for \\"serving Mature Students by offering free tuition for selected part-time students as a way of helping them earn a bachelor's degree\\". The Newcombe Foundation noted that Danien, the program's founder, \\"began her [own] freshman year at the age of forty-six\\" and appreciated the needs and challenges of \\"nontraditional students\\" when she graduated with her BA in seven years. The Newcombe Foundation also noted the successes of many past Bread scholars, including one who went on to earn a PhD, and another who became a prize-winning poet and high school teacher. Danien called graduates of this program her \\"daughters\\" and declared that \\"each one is a marvel!\\" References Category:1929 births Category:2019 deaths Category:20th-century Mesoamericanists Category:American Mesoamericanists Category:Mesoamerican anthropologists Category:Mayanists Category:20th-century anthropologists Category:University of Pennsylvania alumni Category:Scientists from New York City Category:American women philanthropists Category:Philanthropists from Pennsylvania Category:American women anthropologists Category:Philanthropists from New York (state) Category:20th-century philanthropists Category:21st-century philanthropists Category:University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology ","title":"Elin C.

Lesbian mothers were in desperate need of support, and the Lesbian Mothers Union offered assistance to those residing in the San Francisco Bay area. Origins The Lesbian Mothers Union can trace its origins to the Gay Women's West Coast Conference in June of 1971, in Los Angeles. The conference planners neglected to provide child care options to attendees, and had previously ignored a request for events specifically for Lesbian mothers. The initial membership included thirty-six women, out of the conference attendance of two hundred, with Del Martin as a contact for the organization. Eventually the Lesbian Mothers Union was established in both San Francisco and Oakland, California, totaling more than a hundred members locally by 1973. The group described their unique burden as both mothers and lesbians, facing rejection from within even their own community. They described difficulties securing housing, navigating relationships between romantic partners and their children, and preparing their children to deal with \\"the cruelties of straight world oppression.\\" Specifically the organization sought to provide financial and legal aid to Lesbian mothers as, at the time of the group's formation, no \\"admitted Lesbians\\" had won a child custody case in California. The organization would find witnesses and research to demonstrate that Lesbian mothers provided good homes for their children. Because custody battles were inextricably linked to morality, and Lesbianism was perceived to be deviant, the organization also worked to change the perception of Lesbians.  Founders and Prominent Members  Del Martin, a lesbian rights activist, passed away in 2008 after five decades of her efforts to promote gay rights. Martin was married to Phyllis Lyon, and had the two were partners for 55 years. Working together, Martin and Lyon spent their lives working for these rights for themselves, as well as other lesbians and gays. Del Martin became known as one of the founders for the Lesbian Mothers Union, and her contact information was tied to the organization within its first year. She also founded various other similar organizations, such as the National Organization for Women, Council on Religion and the Homosexual, and the Alice B Toklas Democratic Club, America‚Äôs first openly gay political organization. Together, the two women co-founded the organization the Daughters of Bilitis in 1956. It was in this same area, the San Francisco Bay, that the Lesbian Mothers Union was created, just a mere 15 years later. Pat Norman was born on October 21, 1939 in Brooklyn, New York. Throughout her life, she has advocated for women‚Äôs rights, as well as spending much of her life dedicated to the rights of the LGBTQ+ community. In 1971, she founded the Lesbian Mothers Union, along with other activists. Between the years of 1972 and 1979, she focused her time on policies about mental health services for sexual minority groups. She also spent her time training employees on how to best help the LGBTQ+ communities, using sensitivity and awareness of the proper resources. Pat spent a great deal of the 1970s working for the San Francisco Health Department, in which she was the only openly gay employee. Her time spent her was focused on the AIDS epidemic. In 2017, ABC released a docuseries about the life of Cleve Jones, another LGBT activist. The series featured LGBTQ+ activists as well, including Pat Norman, who was played by Whoopi Goldberg. Other active members of the LMU included Phyllis Lyon, Ruth Mahaney, Judie Ghidinelli, and Cathy Cade.  Support  After the creation of the Lesbian Mothers Union in San Francisco, other women from different cities were inspired by the idea and created similar groups to support the lesbian mothers of their areas. The Lesbian Mothers Union also circulated their newsletter in Boston, Chicago, and New York. Groups like the LMU ‚Äúraised funds for legal fees, put lesbians fighting for custody in touch with sympathetic expert witnesses, and in rare cases, helped lesbian mothers and their children go underground when it was clear that they were going to be separated.‚Äù Members Del Martin and Pat Norman conducted outreach like speaking at UC Davis School of Law on issues facing Lesbian mothers. The groups also aimed to hold discussions to address concerns of the lesbian mothers in their area, as well as deeper topics, such as the societal push for heterosexuality. They helped to link other lesbian mothers together by organizing events that all members could participate in. By 1973 the LMU had created a legal defense fund to support members financially as they fought custody battles. Scott‚Äôs Pit, a popular gay bar in San Francisco, was the site of two benefit auctions/raffles in 1973 and 1974, that included guest auctioneers like Jos√© Sarria and J.J. Van Dyke. At this time, the Lesbian Mothers‚Äô National Defense Fund also began fundraising in Seattle to support custody battles involving Lesbians. Other events included a 1972 Christmas party, planned by gay motorcycle clubs of San Francisco; Toys for Tots drives in 1973 and 1975, sporadic potluck dinners for members, and a 1977 \\"day in the park\\" for mothers and children. All these events served to encourage community. At the fundamental level, the Lesbian Mothers Union made lesbian mothers visible, which is a political act in itself. The organization grew from meeting every so often to regular meetings which were held along with fund-raising events. Through their fundraisers and events they received many supporters and friends which was vital to their organization. One of their main fundraisers was called the Lesbian Mothers Day Auction. People would gather in a popular lesbian bar where objects would be auctioned off. All funds would go directly to lesbian mothers and their custody battles. It is estimated that there were 130 members in San Francisco. In May of 1975, The Lesbian Mothers Union was changed to Lesbian Mothers and Friends. This gave space for people who were allies to join political and social conversations surrounding lesbian mothers.  Today  After the 1970s, there is little evidence that the group remains active. However, they were a large inspiration for many other similar groups that spread throughout other cities in the nation. Many of these other groups are still active today and are still working towards supporting and fighting for the rights of the LGBTQ+ community.

It is found in the Peninsular Malaysia, Singapore, the Tioman Island (Malaysia), Sumatra (Indonesia), and possibly the Natuna and Mentawai Islands (Indonesia). In the past it has been confused with Pelophryne signata and P. brevipes. Etymology Pelophryne ingeri is dedicated to the late Robert F. Inger, an American herpetologist who was Emeritus Curator at the Field Museum of Natural History, for his \\"great contributions to Southeast Asian herpetology, including taxonomy of Pelophryne\\". Description The type series consists of two adult males that measure in snout‚Äìvent length. A female has been reported to measure in snout‚Äìvent length. The overall appearance is slender. The head is depressed, slightly longer than it is wide. The snout is truncate. The tympanum is oval and conspicuous. The forelimbs are thin and long; the hindlimbs are slender and moderately long. The fingers and the toes have fleshy webbing. The finger tips are expanded into small discs. The dorsum is scattered with small and large, round tubercles. Coloration is dorsally clay brown, with light cruciform pattern outlined in dark brown. The head has a dark brown interorbital bar. A wide blackish brown band runs from the eye, surrounding the tympanum, and above the arm insertion to the groin. Another brown band, bordered below by a creamy yellow streak, runs from below the eye and the tympanum backwards to the groin, merging on the flank with creamy venter; the venter has irregular dark brown markings. Limbs have irregular dark crossbars dorsally. The throat and chest are creamy brown with light brown mottling. The iris is orange-red. The male advertisement call consists of ticking notes, emitted either continuously or in very long series. In the latter case, notes last about 0.4 seconds and are emitted at intervals of 5‚Äì6 seconds. The dominant frequency is 6.6‚Äì6.75 kHz. Habitat and ecology Pelophryne ingeri occurs in primary forest at elevations of above sea level. Specimens have been found some above ground on vegetation and tree stumps.

The line operates every 20‚Äì30 minutes at all times. P12 trips are roughly 60 minutes long. Background Route P12 operates daily between Addison Road station and Eastover Shopping Center via Southern Avenue station and Suitland station. The line mostly provide service along Addison Road, Silver Hill Road, Iverson Street connecting many neighborhoods to various Metrorail stations. The P12 operates 20-25 minutes on Weekdays and Saturday and 30 minutes during the Late nights and Sundays. Route P12 currently operates out of Landover division. History Route P12 was created as a brand new bus route by the WM&A; Bus Company in 1965, to operate as part of the District Heights-Silver Hill Road Line between the Eastover Shopping Center in Forest Heights, Maryland and the intersection of Shady Glen Drive and Central Avenue along Walker Mill Road. P12 was eventually converted into a WMATA Metrobus Route on February 4, 1973 when WMATA acquired all four bus companies that operated throughout the Washington D.C. Metropolitan Area and merged them to form its own Metrobus System. =1978 Changes= On December 3, 1978, route P12 was extended from its original terminus at the intersection of Shady Glen Drive & Central Avenue to Deanwood station beginning on December 3, 1978. The name of the P12 was also changed to the Eastover‚ÄìDeanwood Line. =1981 Changes= On January 4, 1981 two months after the Addison Road station opened, route P12 discontinued service to Deanwood station and instead terminate at Addison Road station. Route P14 and R12 would replace the P12 between Deanwood and Addison Road stations operating along the former P12 routing. The only changes route P12 would also have was that the P12 would operate along Central Avenue to Shady Glen Drive, then turn onto Shady Glen Drive to the Eastover Shopping Center and vice versa to Addison Road. The line was then renamed the Eastover‚ÄìAddison Road Line. =2001 Changes= On January 13, 2001 when both Suitland and Southern Avenue stations opened, P12 went through a minor rerouting change to divert to Suitland and Southern Avenue stations. =2014 Proposed Changes= In 2014, it was proposed for the P12 and V12 to swap routings between Addison Road station and the intersection of Addison Road and Walker Mill Road which will provide a more direct route for the P12 as the V12 is focused to become a neighborhood focused route. Also P12 was also proposed to terminate only at Southern Avenue station with a brand new P10 service operating between Southern Avenue and Eastover Shopping Center but discontinue service at United Medical Center with alternative service provided by the A2, W2, and W3. This was because discontinuing service through United Medical Center property will save time and increase reliability, since buses will make fewer turns and will no longer get stuck behind illegally parked vehicles at the hospital entrance, swapping P12 and V12 routing on Wheeler Road and Shady Glen Drive will provide a more direct route for the P12 as the V12 is already designed to be a more neighborhood-focused service, and splitting the P12 route at Southern Avenue Station will increase reliability and on time performance plus also provides the flexibility to focus future resources on the portions of the line with the highest demand. According to Performance Measures, only 11% of passengers on the route travel through Southern Avenue Station, the route averages approximately 52 passengers per hour on weekday, and 41 passengers per hour on Saturdays and Sundays north of Southern Avenue Station, and the route averages approximately 58 passengers per hour of weekdays, 54 passengers per hour on Saturdays and 56 passengers per hour on Sundays south of Southern Avenue Station. =2015 Changes= On June 21, 2015, routes P12 and V12 swapped its routing between the intersection of Addison Road and Walker Mill Road and Addison Road station. Route P12 would operate along Addison Road while route V12 would operate along Shady Glen Drive, Walker Mill Road, and Central Avenue. Also, route P12 discontinue service into United Medical Center and instead serve bus stops along Southern Avenue.

His brother Gaspard-Fran√ßois Bart entered the school three years later. Naval career (1722‚Äì1756) Bart joined the Gardes de la Marine in 1722. He was promoted to ship-of-the-line lieutenant (lieutenant de vaisseau) in 1741. He became a ship-of-the-line captain (capitaine de vaisseau) on 1 April 1748. He was Lieutenant de port in Fort Royal (Fort-de-France), Martinique in 1753. On 2 June 1756 in Dunkirk he married P√©ronne Jeanne Elisabeth Huguet du Hallier (10 January 1737 ‚Äì 10 May 1774). Governor of Saint-Domingue (1756‚Äì1761) The naval battle of 20 May 1756 and the taking of Menorca was followed by a formal declaration of war against France by the English. This was the start of the Seven Years' War. The declaration of war was not published in Paris until 16 June. From 29 June to 5 July various notables arrived in Dunkirk to review the situation there and consult with Captain Philippe-Fran√ßois Bart, commander of the navy at Dunkirk, and other heads of service. Bart was appointed Governor and Lieutenant General of Saint-Domingue on 1 October 1756, and was received by the Council of Le Cap on 14 March 1757, and by the Council of Port-au- Prince on 8 July 1757. He replaced Joseph-Hyacinthe de Rigaud. As governor, Bart had to provide continuous support to Prince Joseph de Bauffremont, who commanded the Royal Navy in the French colonies in America. On 16 March 1757 a squadron from France under Bauffremont encountered the 50-gun HMS Greenwich near Saman√° Bay, Santo Domingo, and after a two day pursuit captured the ship, which was taken to Saint Domingue. On 5 June 1757 Bauffremont entered Louisbourg with five ships of the line and a frigate from Saint Domingue. Bart and Lalanne noted in a letter of 17 November 1758 that buccaneers, who could have been a great resource, had gradually disappeared since they could not find a living since the war had begun. In the first two years of the war there were no serious shortages in Saint Domingue, but as the English tightened up control, including seizing neutral ships and imposing a blockade, Bart and the intendant Jean-Baptiste Laporte-Lalanne began to fear a famine. Wine and flour were very expensive at Cap Fran√ßois between October 1757 and February 1758, but then became more affordable. Although prices fluctuated considerably, neutral traders and New England Flag of Truce ships maintained supplies. On 13 May 1761 Bart and Clugny issued an ordinance authorizing formation of a commodity market (bourse au commerce) in Le Cap. On 26 July 1757 Bart and Laporte-Lalanne issued an ordinance defining improved postal service in the colony. On 14 February 1759 Bart issued an ordinance concerning choice of blacks to bear arms against enemies of the state, reviving and adapting an ordinance issued on 9 September 1709 by the governor Choiseul and intendant Mithon. The blacks would be rewarded by gifts, pensions or even freedom for the most distinguished actions. Bart and Jean-Etienne-Bernard de Clugny issued an ordinance on 25 April 1761 concerning registration of land titles. Bart wrote in 1761 that a total of 8,000 whites were spread along more than 300 leagues of coastline, while almost 200,000 blacks, their slaves and their enemies, were around them day and night. It was necessary that these 8,000 whites be armed, as well as their women and children. Last years (1761‚Äì1784) Gabriel de Bory was appointed to succeed Bart on 13 February 1761, and was received by the Council of Le Cap on 30 March 1762. On 1 April 1764 Bart was promoted the squadron commander (chef d'escadre). He retired as squadron leader in 1764. On 1 January 1766 he was appointed a knight of the Order of Saint Louis. Bart died on 12 March 1784 in Paris. He had no children.

He has been the Old Believer bishop of Tomsk since 2015. Personal life Korobeynikov was born into a large family of Old Believers who were peasant farmers in the small town of Chernaya Rechka about 79 km from Izhevsk. He was the youngest of nine children. In his youth most of his family moved to the city of Izhevsk, where he graduated from high school, and later attended the Sarapul College of Food Industry. After serving in the Soviet Army, he returned to the city of Izhevsk, where he worked at a factory, being a member of the Izhevsk Old Believer community of the Protection of the Holy Virgin. In 1971 he married Anna Zadvornova in Novosibirsk. The two had 9 children and 28 grandchildren. His wife died on 25 December 2014.

In 1986, by decree of the Archbishop , Korobeynikov was transferred to permanent service in the Assumption community of the city of Tomsk and moved there in November of that year. On 7 April 1993, on the Eastern Orthodox feast of the Annunciation of the Most Holy Theotokos, Korobeynikov was elevated to the rank of archpriest of the old-rite Orthodox church by Bishop Siluyan (Kilin), who said that Korobeynikov had displayed \\"tireless work for the good of the Church.\\" He was assigned to the pastoral care of the Old Believer communities in eastern Siberia, including Novokuznetsk, Kemerovo, Krasnoyarsk, Kyzyl, as well as Transbaikalia and Kamchatka. Because of the rule regarding clerical celibacy in the old-rite Orthodox Church, Korobeynikov could not become a bishop in the Church. However, after the death of his wife in December 2014, he then became eligible as he was then in state of celibacy. At the synod of the Old Believer bishops from 29‚Äì30 April 2015, the synod discussed the candidates for the position of bishop; it was decided by Archbishop Cornelius (Titov) to ask Bishop Siluyan to make a monastic tonsure to Archpriest Gennady Korobeiniko) and to consecrate the latter as bishop. = Bishop = On 14 September 2015, Korobeynikov received the monastic tonsure and was bestowed the name Gregory by the in the Church of the Assumption in the city of Tomsk.

Aside from the city of Tomsk, the new diocese also included the parishes of the Tomsk and Kemerovo regions, Krasnoyarsk Territory, Khakassia and Tuva. On 31 October 2015 in Tomsk, Cornelius (Titov) intronized the newly appointed Bishop Gregory (Korobeynikov).

The hoard consists of forty-nine coins, two silver brooches with Trewhiddle style decoration, three finger rings, and miscellaneous fragments. The coins date the burial of the hoard to approximately 875 AD. History The Beeston Tor hoard was discovered by Rev. George. H. Wilson of Chorlton-cum-Hardy, England in 1924. The treasure was found in a cave known as St. Bertram's cave on the limestone cliff of Beeston Tor in Staffordshire, England. The hoard's close proximity to a Viking army camped in nearby Repton in the winter of 873 to 874 AD suggests a possible connection between the hoard and the Viking invasion. The find consisted of 49 Anglo-Saxon pennies, three gold rings, two silver brooches, and assorted fragments. Wilson wrote about the treasure in his book, Some Caves and Crags of Peakland and Cave Hunting Holidays in Peakland, which was published in 1926. Besides the coins, brooches, and finger-rings, Wilson recounted finding various fragments and strap ends. He also described discovering the hoard items loose among traces of skin or leather, and suggested that the jewellery and coins may have originally been inside a bag or purse. Items discovered =Coins= Openwork disc brooch, Beeston Tor hoard The hoard consists of forty-nine Anglo-Saxon pennies dating to the ninth century, the newest pre- dating 875 AD. Twenty coins each were issued by King Burgred of Mercia (853-874) and Alfred the Great from Wessex (871-886). Of the remaining nine coins, seven were minted by √Üthelred I, King of Wessex (865-871), one by Archbishop Ceonolth of Canterbury (833-870), and one by √Üthelwulf, King of Wessex (839-858). =Brooches= The two silver brooches found in the hoard are representative of the ninth century Trewhiddle style of Anglo-Saxon England. Characteristics of the style are: the use of silver, niello inlay, intricate carving, and interlaced animal, plant and geometric patterns. Each brooch represents different features of the style, the smaller brooch belongs to the class of intricately designed openwork brooches with zoomorphic motifs and the larger brooch is characteristic of the more simple, flat disc brooches with abstract ornamentation. Sheet disc brooch, Beeston Tor hoard The smallest brooch has an openwork design with a niello background. A beaded outer rim contains a central cross motif with expanded terminals, each containing a boss (raised ornament). Three of the five bosses positioned in the center of the brooch, connect the pin attachment to the base of the brooch. The ornamentation of the brooch includes animal motifs with beaked heads The zoomorphic designs on the brooch are nonidentical, and are mixed with interlacing and ivy-scrolls. The second, larger brooch is a flat, silver disc brooch plainly decorated with abstract motifs. The brooch design contains four intersecting circles with nine small bosses (one missing) equidistant to each other and joined by pointed oval spaces. Ornamentation includes simple interlacing along with plant and geometric symbols. =Rings and binding= Three finger rings were among the hoard items. One gold finger ring with a lozenge shaped cross section and two copper-alloy wire finger rings, one broken, were found by Wilson. A copper-alloy binding was also found. It consists of a warped sheet with beaded edging, narrowing to a rounded terminal. The terminal contains one rivet; two other rivets are located on the binding at the point where the piece narrows.

He was named the best CS:GO player in both 2016 and 2017 by the CS:GO ranking website HLTV.org. Career In August 2015, coldzera was signed by the Luminosity Gaming team, his first contract. His first tournament for the new team was ESL One Cologne 2015, where he managed to get his team through the group stage to reach the quarterfinals of the tournament, but they were eliminated by the Swedish team FNATIC. In 2016, they managed to get out of the group stage in every tournament they participated in, bar one, and including two finals. However, it was not until April that they were able to win their first tournament, MLG Columbus 2016. This resulted in a prize of $500,000 for the team and $100,000 for coldzera personally. This was the first tier 1 championship in which a Brazilian won the MVP (Most Valuable Player) for the tournament, and it was coldzera who won it. Subsequently, his team won two more tournaments for the Luminosity organization; DreamHack Austin and ESL Pro League Season 3. The team's last tournament for the organization was ECS Season 1, where they were second, losing to the G2 Esports team. In July 2016 the five players who played for Luminosity Gaming were hired by the organization SK Gaming. The team's first championship for the new organization was ESL One: Cologne 2016 in July, just days after the acquisition by SK Gaming was announced. Again, the team managed to take first place, becoming a two-time Major championship roster, a feat that only the Swedish Fnatic team and the French Team EnVyUs core lineup had ever achieved (the former being the only ones to win two majors in a row before the Brazilians, and the latter winning DreamHack Winter 2014 as LDLC and DreamHack Open Cluj-Napoca as EnVyUs). coldzera again took the championship MVP award.

Then, on 21/12/2018, the organization announced the return of TACO, felps and zews. And with this line, coldzera stood out individually, but that was not enough to yield great achievements as his team did not work collectively, but this individual highlight earned him the tenth position in the top 20 best players in the world in 2018, according to HLTV.org. On July 12, 2019, it was confirmed by MIBR that coldzera would go to the team bench and zews would provisionally take his place, eventually playing the major in Germany.

Pyotr Podgorodetsky assisted with the arrangement of the song and is often credited as a co-writer. \\"Povorot\\" made it into the only official music chart at the time, Zvukovaya Dorozhka in the newspaper Moskovskij Komsomolets, and spent eighteen months at the top. It remains one of the band's most popular songs. The song was ranked fourth in the list of the 100 best Russian rock songs of the 20th century published by Nashe Radio on December 31, 2000. In 2015, the song's lyrics were ranked 30th in the top 100 most popular poetic lines in Russian society, according to the results of a sociological study by Russian Reporter () magazine.  General information  The song was first officially released in 1987 on the album Desyat let spustya (). The song was also included on other compilations and on all of the group's concert albums. The song was included in the second version of the conceptual concert program Malenkiy prints () in the period from1979 to 1980, after the group's break-up and reformation. In concert performances from 1982 to 1988, part of the song went into a medley along with old songs such as \\"Kovo ty khotel udivit\\" (, \\"Sinyaya ptitsa\\" (), \\"Skachki\\" (), and \\"Za tekh, kto v more\\" (). From 1990 to present, the song remains one of the main concert hits and is usually played at the end of shows, along with the song \\"Svecha\\" ().  Composition  In his memoir, \\"Mashina\\" s evreyami (), Pyotr Podgorodetsky wrote that he composed the music for the song \\"Povorot\\" in 1976, while serving in the army, in the barracks of the military unit of the Internal Troops of the USSR Ministry of Internal Affairs in the city of Aleksandrovka in Belgorod Oblast, where he guarded prisoners. On April 29, 2008, Podgorodetsky performed the song's initial melody on the Russian television channel Lya-Minor (). According to the official version of events, during work on the Malenkiy prints program, Alexandr Kutikov proposed a melody he had come up with, which Makarevich thought was too lyrical and calm. After this, Kutikov and Pogorodetsky prepared a more aggressive version, for which Makarevich quickly wrote lyrics. However, Pogorodetsky claims that he was the one who proposed the slow and lyrical melody, which Kutikov criticized, after which they tried to play it at a faster tempo. Podgorodetsky's version is confirmed by Aleksey Bogomlov, with supplementary details.

Colour polymorphism Poecilia parae are known to have a number of colour morphs in the males, at least five distinct morphs are known, while there is a single female colour form. The colour of the male is linked to the Y-chromosome. Some of the morphs are always abundant in the wild, and others are invariably rare leading to the conclusion that the colour of the males has implications for their fitness. Laboratory work has shown that the most frequent morph is also the most reproductively successful morph. However, when the females were given the choice between two different males they preferred the rare morph males over the common morph males. This suggests that there are alternative male mating strategies involved such as sperm competition and overt male-male competition, among other possible factors, which override the preferences of the female fishes. Habitat and biology Poecilia parae is found in estuaries in areas of both fresh and brackish water. It inhabits small swamps and shallow, slow-flowing creeks located inland with very fresh water. It is also found along riverine vegetation where there is clear water and a bed of mixed sand and mud. They are an ovoviviparous species and the females give birth to 5 to 15 live young after a gestation period of 24 days. Species description and taxonomy Poecilia parae was described by Carl H. Eigenmann in 1894 as Poecilia vivipara parae with the type locality given as \\"Ditches of Rua das Mongubas of Par√°, Brazil\\". Carl Leavitt Hubbs used this species as the type species of the subgenus Micropoecilia, which Fishbase recognises as a genus but does not include this species in it. Other workers support the monophyly of the genus Poecilia sensu lato with a number of subgenera, including Micropoecilia with P. (Micropoecilia) parae as the type species. Eigenmann used the specific name parae in reference to the Brazilian state of Par√°, where the type was collected. Aquaria Poecilia parae, especially the form melanozona, is a popular fish in the aquarium trade.

Although Reed initially denied knowing Stites, after his DNA matched semen inside Stites's dead body, Reed claimed that he was having a clandestine affair with Stites and that they had consensual sex the day before her death. During the penalty phase of the trial, the state argued for capital punishment on the basis of Reed's criminal history, in which he was a suspect in attacks on five women and a 12 year old girl.https://time.com/5722795/rodney-reed-innocent- execution-protests/ Reed was sentenced to death on May 28, 1998, and is incarcerated at the Allan B. Polunsky Unit death row facility in Polk County, Texas. His conviction and death sentence remain controversial. Reed was scheduled to be executed on November 20, 2019, but doubt over Reed's guilt led to bipartisan support for a stay of his execution from Texas state legislators, as well as numerous celebrities and other public figures. On November 15, 2019, the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles unanimously recommended that Texas Governor Greg Abbott grant Reed a 120-day reprieve. Later that day, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals indefinitely stayed Reed's execution. Early life Reed was born in Ventura County, California, to Walter and Sandra Reed. His father was a native of Bastrop, Texas, and an Air Force veteran while his mother was a nurse. Reed was raised with his six brothers in Texas and attended Hirschi High School in Wichita Falls, Texas. He played on the school's football team and was a state Golden Gloves champion boxer. Murder of Stacey Stites Stacey Stites, a 19 year old resident of Giddings, Texas, was found dead on April 23, 1996. Police had received a call at 3:11 PM that her unidentified body had been discovered in some bushes near a dirt road behind Bastrop High School in Bastrop, Texas. A pickup truck that belonged to Stites' fianc√© that she regularly drove to work had been found earlier, parked at the school nearby. The authorities determined that Stites had been beaten, sodomized, and raped before being strangled to death with her own belt some time between 3:00 and 5:00 AM. When discovered in the bushes, Stites was wearing a black bra and jeans. Part of the belt that had been used to kill her was found near her body, and the other part of the belt was found near the truck. Her body had been partially burned, and her shirt was found nearby. Stites had lived in Giddings with her fianc√©, a local police officer, whom she was scheduled to marry in three weeks. Her fianc√© said he last saw her around 3:00 AM after the couple showered together and she left for work. Bastrop High School was en route from their home in Giddings on the way to her workplace in the produce section at the H-E-B grocery store in Bastrop. After Stites did not arrive for her 3:30 AM shift, the store called her mother, who then called the police. H-E-B offered a $50,000 reward for information leading to the capture of her killer, but it went unclaimed. On July 12, 1996, an anonymous woman called the authorities once and said she believed that her son may have been with Stites in the hours before she was killed, but the call could not be traced. Stites was buried in her hometown of Corpus Christi on April 26, 1996. Her brother never recovered from her death and committed suicide in 1997. Arrest and trial The authorities began to suspect Reed had been involved in the Stites murder based on similarities in the case to an attack on another woman six months later on November 9, 1996. Linda Schlueter, age 19, had agreed to give a ride to a man she met after stopping at a drive- up payphone at a now-closed Long's Star Mart. When she went to drop him off, he attacked her and said he would kill her for resisting him, but then fled the scene with her vehicle after seeing car lights approaching. Reed was detained by police based on Schlueter's description, and she subsequently picked him out of a photo line-up. The police department had been familiar with him because of prior arrests. Schlueter's vehicle was found close to where Stites's pickup truck had been abandoned at Bastrop High School. DNA extracted from three sperm found in Stites' vagina and saliva found on her chest matched to Reed. Local law enforcement already had Reed's DNA on file from a investigation into an alleged rape of a woman with intellectual disabilities in May 1995. Reed was officially charged with the murder of Stacey Stites on April 4, 1997, and held without bond. At the time, he was already in jail on an unrelated charge. He was indicted and \\"charged with two counts of capital murder, one for murder in the course of aggravated sexual assault and one for murder in the course of kidnapping.\\" His arraignment was scheduled for May 29, 1997, and jury selection began in March 1998. The jury was described as \\"mostly white\\", with no African-Americans among the 12 jurors or two alternates. The case against Reed rested heavily upon the DNA evidence, with no additional physical evidence or eyewitness testimony. Upon his initial questioning by police and before he learned about the DNA evidence, Reed denied knowing Stites outside of what he had heard in news reports. At trial, Reed's defense attorneys, Lydia Clay-Jackson and Calvin Garvey, argued that there had actually been a clandestine sexual relationship between Reed and Stites. Reed said that he initially denied knowing Stites because it would be best for him not to admit to knowing \\"a dead white girl\\" and later because \\"I knew she was seeing a cop, and we're in the South. There's still a lot of racism going on.\\" The prosecutors noted that Reed had previously used a similar defense of a clandestine affair when charged with a different aggravated rape in 1987 which had led to him being acquitted. According to prosecutor Lisa Tanner, DNA evidence was taken from 15 suspects, including Stites' fianc√© and individuals who allegedly confessed to or bragged about the killing. DNA testing eliminated everyone except Reed as the source of the semen. Police investigators could find no one who would attest to a relationship between Reed and Stites, including her mother and sister, and the defense brought forward no witnesses who could testify to the affair. Further, Stites' mother claimed that her daughter and her fianc√© \\"looked happy and in love\\". The prosecution put forward the DNA evidence and speculated that Reed may have ambushed Stites at a railroad crossing or a stoplight on her way to work the morning of the murder. Reed was convicted on May 18, 1998, after a jury deliberation of six hours. Stites' family and friends were relieved by the conviction. Reed's family wept, because they were convinced that he was innocent. He was sentenced to death on May 28, 1998, after a deliberation of four hours. During sentencing, prosecutors pushed for the death penalty by arguing that Reed was likely to pose a danger in the future based on a history of similar previous charges. To bolster their case, the prosecution brought forward women Reed allegedly raped: Schlueter, a 12 year old girl, the intellectually disabled woman, and a woman named Vivian Harbottle to testify against him in the penalty phase. The prosecution asserted that DNA found on them matched Reed. Appeals and stays of execution Reed has unsuccessfully appealed nine times on grounds of ignored witnesses and evidence that may have raised reasonable doubt but was not handed over to defense attorneys because prosecutors claimed that it was irrelevant. Reed's attorneys have subsequently argued that the broken belt used in the murder has never been tested for DNA, and that forensic experts have admitted to making errors in their testimony. His case has since been taken up by the Innocence Project. Reed was scheduled to be executed on January 14, 2015, but the execution was rescheduled to March 5, 2015, based on a request by the state. On February 23, 2015, his execution was stayed to allow the consideration of further evidence. His execution was later rescheduled for November 20, 2019. In the weeks preceding Reed's November 20, 2019, execution date celebrities such as Kim Kardashian West, Rihanna, Beyonc√©, Meek Mill, Pusha T, Susan Sarandon, Seth Green, and Oprah Winfrey publicly urged Texas Governor Greg Abbott to exonerate Reed or stay his execution. Some, such as Amanda Seales, have rescinded their support for Reed's exoneration after learning more about his history. The case received coverage in major news outlets, and Reed was interviewed on an episode of Dr. Phil, in which host Phil McGraw opined that Reed should not be executed because he had not received a fair trial. By November 14, 2019, a petition to free Reed started by Shaun King had reportedly garnered more than three million signatures. A bipartisan group of 16 Texas state senators has petitioned Abbott to stay the death penalty on grounds that new, possibly exculpatory evidence had come to light. On November 15, 2019, the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles unanimously recommended that Texas Governor Greg Abbott grant Reed a 120-day reprieve. Later that day, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals indefinitely stayed Reed's execution, stating that his legal team's claims of suppression of evidence, false testimony, and ineffective counsel satisfied the requirements of habeas corpus. On February 24, 2020, the Supreme Court announced that it would not be taking up Reed's appeal, citing ongoing litigation in lower courts. In popular culture Reed was the subject of the 2006 documentary film State vs. Reed and a 2018 episode of the CNN series Death Row Stories.

Its proximity to the Edinburgh law courts also meant it was a haunt of Edinburgh lawyers and judges. History John Dowie as illustrated by John Kay John Dowie took over a tavern named \\"The Mermaid\\" on Liberton Wynd, off Edinburgh's Royal Mile, close to the Law Courts and St Giles Cathedral around 1770. The building held a date-stone of 1728 over the entrance. Dowie was a convivial host, and despite the small rooms and lack of daylight, it was a popular place, due to both Dowie himself and the quality of the beers.Lost Edinburgh, Hamish Coghill Liberton Wynd was a steep and narrow alley leading from the High Street to the Cowgate. The south wall of the tavern was defined by the King's Wall, one of the early city town walls.Memorials of Edinburgh in Olden Times vol.I, Sir Daniel Wilson Edinburgh Ale was supplied to the tavern by Archibald Younger from the Croft-an-Righ Brewery near Holyrood Abbey (which was set up in 1777). The tavern also sold food such as Nor' Loch trout, Welsh rabbit and \\"puffed herring\\" (bloater). It was upon from around 10am until midnight.Kay's Originals, by John Kay c.1800Scotsman (newspaper) 28 October 2006 The largest room in the tavern held around 14 people. The smallest space, known as \\"the coffin\\", held four, or six at a squeeze, and was the favourite space of Burns. In 1806, the poem \\"Johnnie Dowie's Ale\\" was published, raising the fame of the tavern.Scots Magazine, 1806. Following the death of John Dowie in 1817, the tavern was renamed the Burns Tavern due to its connection to Robert Burns. Dowie left around ¬£6,000 in his will (a small fortune at that time). He was survived by his second wife and the children from his first marriage.Kay's Original Portraits, c.1800. It was demolished (together with all of Liberton Wynd) to create George IV Bridge, which began construction in 1827. It is thought the tavern was one of the last buildings demolished for the project, around 1836. Although some records state the tavern was demolished in 1881, this appears to relate to a second Burns Tavern, possibly built by the owner of the first.Edinburgh Evening News, 14 August 2019. Known clientele The following are known to have visited the tavern: *Robert Fergusson *Robert Burns *Henry Mackenzie *David Herd *James Cummyng, Lord Lyon *George Paton *David Hunter of Blackness *Anthony Woodhead *George Martin *William Nicol, headmaster of the High School *Allan Masterton The College of Dowie This was a \\"club\\" which met in the tavern in the last decade of the 18th century.

Constructed between 1880 and 1940, the buildings in the district include the first parts of Ravenswood to be developed. Ravenswood was one of Chicago's first suburban neighborhoods, and the area's many trees and proximity to the Chicago River appealed to residents looking for less urbanized surroundings. Transit connections, including the new Ravenswood branch of the Chicago 'L', and the growth of Chicago as a whole brought new residents and greater density to the neighborhood over the ensuing decades. The district is mainly composed of houses and small apartment buildings, the designs of which reflect the transition from the Queen Anne and Victorian designs of the late nineteenth century to the Prairie School and revival styles of the twentieth. It is also noted for its many churches, which represent the variety of religious denominations in the neighborhood and showcase religious architecture of the period.

Stephen Thomas Erlewine at AllMusic gives the album two out of five stars, calling it \\"a polished collection of contemporary pop and soul hits as sung by the gifted jazz vocalist. . . . But Hartman is simply not suited for this straightahead style -- he is too idiosyncratic to put himself into this straightjacket. As a result, I've Been There sounds awkward, with only a few moments rising to the merely pleasurable status.\\". In The Last Balladeer: The Johnny Hartman Story, biographer Gregg Akkerman calls I've Been There \\"an album of considerably poor quality. . . . It came off sounding like good musicians were asked to play music they really weren't excited or knowledgeable about, and hoping something good would come of it.\\" The only positive note, Akkerman claims, is the song \\"Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head,\\" which he calls \\"the highlight of the album. . . .

Biography Achard was born in Paris on July 14, 1918. When the Nazis invaded France, Achard, like many Frenchmen, took up arms for the French Resistance, eventually becoming editor-in-chief of one of the many resistance newspapers, \\"Debout\\" (French for \\"On Our Feet\\"), which was founded by Claude Julien, another member of the French Resistance. Achard eventually became the Chairman of the F√©d√©ration nationale fran√ßaise des anciens combattants(\\"French National Federation of Former Combatants\\"). He made his racing debut in a supercharged Maserati 1500. Achard was successful in the 1946 and 1947 racing seasons, but in June 1947 he crashed on the first lap, while the V12 Delahaye 155 that he had used in 1946 was lent to Levegh for the race. Achard drove the Delahaye again on July 13, 1947. That same day, he had crashed at the Grand Prix de l‚ÄôAlbigeois at Albi, when one of the wheels from his Delahaye flew into the grandstands, killing a female spectator. He did not race again until 1951. In 1950, Achard decided to make a comeback. He brought Philippe √âtancelin's Talbot-Lago T26C and he emigrated to Rio de Janeiro in Brazil. That year he raced at Interlagos on May 13, finishing 5th and at Boavista on June 24, finishing 3rd. Achard was even accepted into the 1951 running of the Indy 500, but he never made it to the race: he was killed in a hill climb event in Brazil.

It consists of a mixture of the site's own international content, together with local news provided by a small resident news bureau. It is reached by accessing The Guardians own site in New Zealand. It has existed since the 4 November 2019, and started as part of the news site's \\"New Zealand at 5 million\\" project. Despite its local name, the site is sub edited outside country by the page‚Äôs sister sites Guardian Australia and The Guardian.  Background  In 2019, the website was one of the top ten news sites in New Zealand, and the forty-fifth most visited site in the country. There was also growing interest in news from the country from outside New Zealand, which meant an increasing contact with resident journalists. From that, The Guardian recruited their previous freelance correspondent, Dunedin-based Eleanor Ainge Roy and placed her under a full time contract, and kept in touch with The New York Times New Zealand correspondent Charlotte Graham-McLay. Unlike The Guardian Australia, which started though a one-off grant from businessman Graeme Wood, the bureau has no further external funding and so it is entirely dependent on readers and advertising revenue. As with other Guardian Media Group publications, Guardian New Zealand is ultimately owned by The Scott Trust, which aims to stay independent and free from \\"commercial pressures\\". The online publication relies on digital advertising and voluntary reader donations or subscriptions for revenue, eschewing enforced paywalls implemented by other news websites like The New Zealand Herald online.

As a player, he enjoyed football, and pitching baseball. =American Expeditionary Force (AEF) team Coach, 1918-19= In Army, 1918 He followed several of the fighters he'd been with into signing with the 29th Division of the Maryland National Guard in 1917 and continued his coaching career in WWI rising to the rank of Sergeant by 1919 coaching National Guard boxers at Camp McClellan, a large army mobilization camp outside Anniston, Alabama.Graham, Frank, \\"Graham's Corner\\", Graham, Corner, Pittsburgh Sun-Telegraph, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, pg. 37, 3 June 1954 While serving in the Army in France, he fought reigning European featherweight champion, Frenchman Charles Ledoux, in a rugged bout to a six round draw in an exhibition in an underground canteen in Verdun, France on October 4, 1918. During the same period he had an exhibition with the future French light heavyweight champion Georges Carpentier.Taylor, Walter, \\"Webb Tabs Tussle with Ledoux\\", The Evening Sun, Baltimore, Maryland, pg. 60, 16 June 1954 Towards the end of the war, he Captained and trained the highly successful American Expeditionary Force (AEF) boxing team. On January 14, 1919, the Blue and Grey team of the Maryland National Guard 29th Division, coached by Webb, won every bout in a contest arranged for them with French fighters in Paris. In a telegram sent the following morning to the Divisional commander, Webb summed up the day, stating his team had \\"Nine fights, nine victories, five knockouts.\\" When the Division left Paris, Webb was picked to stay behind and coach the American team in the Paris Inter-Allied Games Competition.Cutchins, John Abram, and Stewart, George Scott, 1921, History of the Twenty-ninth Division, Blue and Gray, 1917-1919, Division Historical Committee, Philadelphia, PA, pg. 252-253 Coaching the team to a win in the Inter-Allied Games finals at the Cirque-de-Paris on July 26, 1919, Webb was the subject of strong praise from the American Commander General Pershing, who watched the competition, for steering the team to victory. Webb was known for introducing AEF team member Gene Tunney, future world heavyweight champion, to the inside right hook. A boxer starts the blow with the elbow of the right arm close to the side of the body, than shoots that arm straight out, finally turning the wrist inward just before impact.\\"Don't Learn to Take it Spike Webb Advises, Special Blow\\", Abilene Reporter-News, Abilene, Texas, pg. 11, 25 February 1940Outstanding members of the team included Olympian Eddie Eagan and Bob Martin. Tunney, who won the light heavyweight championship for the American AEF team, later said, \\"Spike Webb ranks as one of the two or three top men in boxing for all time, either professional or amateur. He is an institution. The regard in which boxing holds him is a result of his way of life. He never asked anything for himself. He was always giving to others.\\"Taylor, Walter, \\"LaBarba Best Olympic Boxer\\", Baltimore Evening Sun, Baltimore, Maryland, pg. 49, 17 June 1954 =US Naval Academy coach, 1919-54= Webb, early career, 1920 Immediately after his service in WWI, he became an associate professor and boxing coach at the United States Naval Academy, Annapolis, Maryland, and served for 35 years until his retirement on June 30, 1954. During his career as a coach, he amassed a record of wins and titles that many boxing historians consider unsurpassed in his era. His Academy teams at Annapolis won a total of six intercollegiate boxing titles, where they were undefeated for 12 seasons from 1921-32, and won 26 individual crowns. His naval team record for the period between 1919-1941 was 93 wins, 14 losses, and 8 ties. With a few interruptions, boxing techniques continued to be taught at the Naval Academy after 1941 but as an intramural and not as a competitive intercollegiate sport and Webb coached many of the intramural teams. Boxing was dropped as an Inter- collegiate sport at Navy in 1941 due to a loss of recruits due to WWII. It became an inter-collegiate sport again in 1983 under Coach Emerson Smith who carefully researched to determine the safest available amateur headgear and gloves for competitions. An Annual Brigade Boxing Championship continues today for Navy Mid-shipman, featuring head gear and three round matches. The winner receives the Tony Rubino Trophy, named in honor of Webb's replacement as coach in 1954. Considered the \\"Father of Navy Boxing\\", the \\"Spike Webb Outstanding Boxer Award\\" has been given to the outstanding Navy boxer each year since Webb's retirement in 1954. In the same year he began coaching the Navy team in 1919, Webb started Boxing Juniors, a boxing club for the children of officers.

As coach, in 1920, 1924, 1928, and 1932, he led the team to 3 overall team titles, and seven individual gold medals. Finding success in his first year as Olympic Coach at the 1920 Antwerp Summer Olympics, his boxers received 4 medals, with golds won by Frankie Genaro, Samuel Mosberg, and Eddie Eagan. In the 1924 Paris Olympics, Webb said he was proud he had picked Jackie Fields over the protests of other coaches, despite his being beaten in his second Olympic trials elimination round. Proven correct in his evaluation, Fields took the gold medal in Paris, and later became World welterweight champion. Fidel LaBarba, whom Webb considered his most intelligent protege, won the other gold. His 1928 Amsterdam Olympic boxing team was the only one of the four he coached that failed to win the team medal, but won two Silvers and a Bronze. At the 1932 Los Angeles Olympics, the team once again won the team title, taking two gold and three bronze medals. While they were Olympians, Webb coached future champions Jackie Fields, Fidel LaBarba, and Frankie Genaro. He trained Eddie Saunders at Annapolis, before he became the 1952 Olympic Gold medalist at Helsinki.

The idea began as an entrepreneurship class project at Case Western Reserve University. Crowdfunding Campaign Everykey launched its Kickstarter campaign on October 29th, 2014. Within 48 hours, the campaign had reached trending status and raised over $25,000 in pre-orders. The project quickly gained attention, and Everykey launched another crowdfunding campaign on Indiegogo with John McAfee on December 7, 2015. While some media outlets such as Wired and TechCrunch were excited about the traction, they also expressed concern over the security versus convenience factor of the product. Writers at Business Insider focused more on the vision of the company, exploring Everykey‚Äôs future plans and classroom origin story. Products The company's debut product was an electronic wristband designed to replace keys and passwords. Development of the prototype into a working product was funded by a Kickstarter campaign. The current product, resembling a USB thumb drive that can be inserted into a wristband accessory, was funded by an Indiegogo crowdfunding campaign. The software enables Everykey to work with a variety of computer and mobile platforms. Everykey currently offers the hardware thumb-drive style product as well as a Key Ring Accessory, Band Accessory, Charging Cable, and Bluetooth Dongle. Technology Everykey is a Bluetooth device that can communicate securely with an unlimited number of other Bluetooth devices, simultaneously. The Everykey device employs a patented method including AES and RSA encryption to allow the user to unlock their devices and login to online accounts without having to type passwords. When the user leaves with Everykey, the app can lock everything back down and log out of online accounts. Everykey‚Äôs patented method allows it to perform unlocking and locking actions without plugging in the device. Reception Many were skeptical about Everykey‚Äôs legitimacy due to the company‚Äôs delayed shipment to early adopters. John McAfee‚Äôs involvement as the company‚Äôs brand ambassador was controversial, with some being concerned and others elated regarding his involvement. The company has even hosted an r/IAmA style open forum on Reddit so anyone could ask about topics ranging from security to late delivery. Everykey has since addressed many of the initial concerns, and is now selling their products with retailers such as Best Buy, Newegg, and Office Depot. Competitors In the password managers market, Everykey competes with LastPass, 1Password and Dashlane. In the hardware security key market, Everykey's competitors include Nymi, and YubiKey.

He later became a symbol in the 2019‚Äì2020 Chilean protests as a sort of resistance to police brutality and the fight for dignity, he has many graffiti and statues made in his honor throughout the country and even in the subway protests in NYC on 2019. Among his characteristics was his black fur and the red handkerchief that was tied around his neck, although he also had a blue and a white handkerchiefs that were placed by their caregiver. His name came from Spanish matar (to kill) and paco, which is Chilean slang for \\"policeman\\".  Biography  The dog gained fame among the university circles of Santiago, mainly in the universities of Santiago (Usach), Metropolitan of Technology (UTEM) and Central (Ucen). During the 2019 student protests Negro Matapacos became known for participating in the street marches and attacking members of Carabineros de Chile, which garnered the sympathies of the Chileans protesters Although Negro Matapacos was considered a stray dog, due to its presence in different university headquarters and streets of Santiago, he was under the care of Mar√≠a Campos, who adopted him in 2009 and who fed him, had a bed for him in her residence, and tied his handkerchiefs around his neck and also gave him a blessing before he went out. During his participation in street demonstrations, several media outlets also called him the \\"Chilean Loukanikos\\", due to his similarities with the dog that became famous during the protests in Greece between 2010 and 2012. Negro Matapacos died on August 26, 2017, attended by veterinary personnel and caregivers. Various sources mention that at the time of his death he had left descendants of 32 puppies with 6 different dogs.  Cultural references  Papier-m√¢ch√© sculpture of Negro Matapacos, displayed during a protest at Plaza Baquedano. In December 2013 the documentary Matapaco was released, made by V√≠ctor Ram√≠rez, Carolina Garc√≠a, Nayareth Nain, Francisco Mill√°n and Sergio Medel of EnMarcha Films, and which won the Best Documentary award at the Santo Tom√°s Festival in Vi√±a del Mar. During the 2019 Chilean protests, the image of Negro Matapacos acquired notoriety again, and protesters drew inspiration from him during street demonstrations, appearing on various posters, stickers, murals and sculptures of papier-m√¢ch√©, and requests have even been made to install a statue of the dog in a public place. Tributes have also been made outside of Chile, such as in Japan on November 14, where the statue of Hachik≈ç outside Shibuya station in Tokyo was intervened with a red handkerchief, similar to that worn by Negro Matapacos. On November 18 the statue of Balto at Central Park in New York City was intervened in the same way. During the mass evasions that took place on November 1 of the same year in the New York subway in protest at the police repression towards a fare evader, a lot of stickers appeared in the stations of that city with the image of Negro Matapacos jumping a turnstile.

CU created a scholarship in honor of her and her husband, Charles, who was CU's first African American faculty member.  Early life and education  Nancy Mildred Harper (who went by the name Mildred) was born July 26, 1920 in Montgomery, Alabama. She was the youngest of three children of Lemuel Paul Harper and Fannie Harper. Her father's job as a railroad mail clerk made her family slightly better off than most African Americans families at the time which allowed her to attend Alabama State Laboratory High School. But her race and gender limited her career choices. She took a position teaching but did not enjoy it so she returned to school and obtained a master's degree at Atlanta University in Library Science.  Career  NIlon held a series of library jobs in Atlanta, Alabama, and Detroit until her husband, Charles, accepted a job teaching in the University of Colorado's English department in Boulder, Colorado in 1956. In 1962 she was offered a position with the University of Colorado Libraries helping with an emergency staffing situation. CU asked her to return in the fall of 1962 to work in the library's General Reference and Interlibrary Loans section. She was eventually appointed Assistant Director for Public Services, a position she held until her retirement in 1987. She was CU's first African American librarian.  Family  Mildred Harper met Charles Nilon at Alabama State University and they married in 1953. They had a son, Charles Nilon, Jr., who graduated from Morehouse College in Atlanta. Charles Nilon, Jr., is now a faculty member at the University of Missouri.  Community involvement  Nilon was active in numerous community organizations including the United Black Women of Boulder Valley, the Town and Country YWCA board, the Mental Health board, and the Historic Boulder board. Soon after arriving in town the Nilons tried to buy a house outside of the Goss/Grove area which was Boulder's ‚ÄúBlack ghetto‚Äù at the time. Owners changed their minds about selling to the Nilons after their neighbors complained when the Nilons were shown houses. They were finally able to purchase a house outside the ‚Äúghetto‚Äù which paved the way for other African American families to purchase homes without discrimination. Their experience led to their efforts to end housing segregation and support affordable housing in Boulder. While at CU they mentored African American students who were welcomed into their home. They sought to increase the number of African American faculty and students at a time when there were very few of either on campus.  Scholarship  The Charles and Mildred Nilon Teacher Education Scholarship Fund honors the Nilons. It is designated for students who are ‚Äúcommitted to advancing educational opportunities in under-resourced schools, especially those that serve African American communities.‚Äù Mildred Nilon died September 30, 2017 in Boulder at the age of 97.

In the 1990s, it started to parasitise the larvae of the invasive amber-marked birch leaf miner in Alberta. When this pest spread to Alaska, the wasp was used in biological pest control. Ecology Like other parasitic wasps in the family Ichneumonidae, the adult female L. luteolator uses its ovipositor to lay eggs inside the body of its prey, usually the larval stage of a sawfly larva, often a leaf miner. When the eggs hatch, the carnivorous larvae live in and consume the body of their host. Various sawfly larvae are attacked including the red oak leaf miner (Profenusa alumna). In Alberta, the host is the \\"pear slug\\" (Caliroa cerasi), which is not a mollusc but the larva of a sawfly. However, in Alberta in the early 1990s, the wasp adopted a new host and started parasitising the amber-marked birch leaf miner (Profenusa thomsoni), an invasive species that had appeared in the province twenty years earlier and become a major pest of birch trees (Betula). A dramatic collapse in populations of the leaf miner followed, and numbers remain low, seemingly kept under control by the parasitic wasp. By 2003 the range of the amber- marked birch leaf miner had extended into Alaska, and it was spreading, first throughout the Anchorage Basin, and later into the Eagle River watershed and the Matanuska-Susitna Valley and southwards to Bird Ridge, causing serious defoliation of birch trees. A biological control program of the pest using Lathrolestes luteolator was initiated in 2004.
