Courvoisier's adroit virtuosity provides the perfect accompaniment to Friedlander's sinuous lyricism, her neo-classical technique finding sympathetic accord in the leader's straightforward approach. Mori, on the other hand, is the date's wildcard, conjuring a kaleidoscopic array of beguiling textures from her laptop that imbue the proceedings with a surreal, cinematic air\\".Collins, T.

The occupation received widespread coverage from media outlets. During the course of the occupation, statements were issued by anti-government activists and sympathetic residents, who criticized the militants' tactics. Other statements of condemnation were issued by legal scholars; federal, state, local, and tribal governments; and other organizations. In the first days, the takeover sparked a debate in the United States on the meaning of the word \\"terrorist\\" and on how the news media and law enforcement treat situations involving people of different ethnicities or religions. Response of authorities On January 2, the Harney County Sheriff's Office reported the Oregon State Police (OSP) was \\"handling the incident.\\" At the same time, a spokesperson for the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) said the agency was \\"aware\\" of the situation. Later that same day, The Guardian observed that there was no visible law enforcement presence in the area. Authorities had not approached the refuge or blocked access to it. On January 3, Harney County Sheriff David Ward issued a statement asking residents to avoid the scene and saying that the militants aimed to overthrow the government. The following day, Ward said at a press conference: > I want to directly address the people at the wildlife refuge: You said you > were here to help the citizens of Harney County. That help ended when a > peaceful protest became an armed and unlawful protest. The Hammonds have > turned themselves in. It is time for you to leave our community. Go home, be > with your own families and end this peacefully. On the evening of January 3, Oregon State Police officials announced that a multi-agency command post would be established the following day to coordinate a response to the situation. The command post was ultimately set up at Lincoln Junior High School in Burns, Oregon, which had been closed as part of a district-wide school shutdown. U.S. Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon said that he had been briefed by the special agent in charge of the Portland, Oregon, FBI field office and added that federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies were monitoring the situation. Also that same day, the FBI assumed the lead role in the investigation and announced that it was working with local and state authorities to seek \\"a peaceful resolution to the situation.\\" The statement also read: \\"Due to safety considerations for both those inside the refuge as well as the law enforcement officers involved, we will not be releasing any specifics with regards to the law enforcement response.\\" Another version of this story was published January 5, 2016, with headline \\"Oregon Protesters Vow to Dig In Even as Their Heroes Surrender,\\" by Alexander Smith, Alex Johnson, Joe Fryer, and Elisha Fieldstadt. Ward later announced that the Harney County Court officially appealed for police reinforcements from the sheriffs of neighboring counties. Media outlets reported that the entrance gates to Burns Municipal Airport had been blocked by the Oregon State Police using patrol cars and armored vehicles. Despite the increased presence in and around Burns, by the end of the day on January 4, media noted that no overt police presence was visible in the between the town and refuge headquarters. In taking a cautious approach, federal authorities were thought to \\"be mindful of prior clashes with people who did not recognize government authority,\\" such as the Ruby Ridge incident in 1992 and the Waco siege in 1993. Those events \\"ended in bloodshed and became rallying cries for antigovernment militants,\\" in contrast to similar standoffs which ended peacefully, such as the 1996 standoff with the Montana Freemen, which was resolved by extended negotiations leading to the group's surrender. \\"A version of this article appears in print on January 5, 2016, on page A12 of the New York edition with the headline: Occupying Federal Land, to Little Response.\\" Sheriff Ward, meanwhile, told reporters that steps were underway to break the occupation and that the measures authorities were taking would \\"not be visible to the public.\\" Ward also reported law enforcement personnel from nine Oregon counties had begun converging to Harney County in response to the Harney County Court's plea for help, but that they would be used to bolster courthouse security and increase the visible police presence in populated areas, rather than respond to the situation at the MNWR. Among the agencies to send personnel were the sheriffs of Wasco, Clackamas, Marion, Deschutes, Crook, Umatilla, Multnomah, Baker, and Linn Counties, along with the Burns Paiute tribal police. The sheriffs of Benton and Yamhill Counties both declined a request to deploy some of their deputies to Harney County due to what they described as existing manpower shortages. Ward assured residents on January 4 that deputies from outside the county would not \\"harass the good citizens of Harney County\\" and called on residents at a community meeting at the Harney County Fairgrounds on January 6 to form a \\"united front.\\" In an interview with Oregon Public Broadcasting on January 5, he said that any resident providing supplies to the militants would only be \\"prolonging the situation.\\" Media Due to the presence of members with connections to right-wing groups such as the Three Percenters and the Oath Keepers, The Daily Beast dubbed the event \\"Wingnut Woodstock,\\" referencing a militant, Dylan Anderson, who at the time would only identify himself as \\"Captain Moroni\\" (in an apparent reference to a leader in the Book of Mormon) who told media outlets, \\"I didn't come here to shoot I came here to die.\\" Pacific Standard magazine published a detailed analysis of many of the historical claims made by the militants in their public statements and in an \\"open letter\\" addressed to Harney County Sheriff David Ward. The magazine rates the claims as \\"libertarian fairy tales\\" and \\"revisionist\\" and noted \\"you can tell the story of Harney County as a morality tale about the evils of big government only if you leave most of it out. And so they do.\\" Legal scholars Lawyers and legal scholars said that the occupiers \\"are making demands that fly in the face of the U.S. Constitution.\\" Erwin Chemerinsky, the dean and Distinguished Professor of Law at the University of California, Irvine School of Law, wrote: > Those who are occupying the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in Oregon are > making a legal argument that has no basis. ... Although the law on this is > clear and has been for decades, the protestors continue to argue that the > federal government does not have valid legal ownership of the land and must > give it back to the states. It is similar to tax protestors who continue to > argue that the federal income tax is unconstitutional, despite every court > rightly rejecting this argument. During the legal proceedings, legal scholars expressed doubts over Ammon Bundy's defense that the federal government no longer had jurisdiction over federal land in Oregon ever since it became a state. They cited the Property Clause of Article Four of the United States Constitution, which granted the government jurisdiction over federal property, and several related U.S. Supreme Court cases that ruled in favor of the government. Anti-government activists Cliven D. Bundy, the father of Ammon and Ryan Bundy, said he was not involved in organizing the takeover of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge headquarters and added that it was \\"not exactly what I thought should happen.\\" Asked about the incident, Mike Vanderboegh, a founder of the 3 Percenters, described the militants as \\"a collection of fruits and nuts,\\" described Jon Ritzheimer as a \\"fool,\\" and said Ammon Bundy had \\"a John Brown complex.\\" This is a reference to the 19th century American abolitionist, who advocated the use of armed insurrection to overthrow the institution of slavery in the United States. Stewart Rhodes, founder and leader of the Oath Keepers (of which Jon Ritzheimer was formerly a member) published an online statement one day prior to the seizure of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge headquarters, saying, \\"We cannot force ourselves or our protection on people who do not want it. Dwight and Steven Hammond have made it clear, through their attorney, that they just want to turn themselves in and serve out their sentence. And that clear statement of their intent should be the end of the discussion on this.\\" On January 15, Rhodes warned of a \\"bloody, brutal civil war\\" if the situation did not end peacefully. Residents The New York Times reported that \\"Residents expressed sympathy with the underlying complaints, but elected officials criticized the armed protesters as an outsider militia group whose actions had thrown their community into a harsh national glare.\\" \\"A version of this article appears in print on January 4, 2016, on page A1 of the New York edition with the headline: Armed Protesters Vow to Stay on Oregon Refuge Indefinitely.\\" Former Burns mayor Len Vohs said, \\"The majority of us support the Hammonds, but we don't need outsiders telling us what to do.\\" He criticized the tactics used by the militiamen, saying that it was \\"anarchy\\" and \\"might is right\\" thinking. Harney County commissioner Dan Nichols, a neighbor of the Hammond family, made similar comments, saying that he shared frustrations about federal land policy but strongly disagreed with the involvement of armed outsiders. In a meeting held on January 6, local residents nearly unanimously agreed they wanted the militants to leave in a show of hands to a question from Harney County Sheriff David Ward, although some expressed agreement with the concerns raised by the militia group over land use issues. Federal, state, local, and tribal governments On January 4, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said, \\"Ultimately this is a local law enforcement matter and the FBI is monitoring the situation and offering support to local law enforcement officials.\\" Earnest added that President Barack Obama was aware of the situation. In a statement issued January 7, Oregon Governor Kate Brown said, \\"...I agree that what started as a peaceful and legal protest has become unlawful. It was instigated by outsiders whose tactics we Oregonians don't agree with. Those individuals illegally occupying the Malheur Wildlife Refuge need to decamp immediately and be held accountable.\\" In a January 4 press release, Harney County Judge Steven Grasty said that \\"[T]he Refuge is under federal jurisdiction. The County Court will stay engaged within the limits of our legal authority. ... The Hammond family is well respected in Harney County, [the] motivation of the militia groups that have descended on Harney County goes far beyond the troubles of the Hammond family as demonstrated by their actions at the Refuge.\\" Harney County increased security at the county courthouse. Judge Grasty announced that the Bundy group would be billed the security costs incurred by the county as a result of the occupation, estimated at to per day. The governing council of the Burns Paiute Tribe, an Indian nation in Harney County, declared the militants were endangering the tribe's history by their presence and called on them to leave. Tribal chair Charlotte Rodrique went on to explain that the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) was the protector of traditional Burns Paiute religious and archaeological sites in the area and that the displacement of federal authorities put such locations at risk. Oregon Representative Cliff Bentz, who represents the region in the Oregon House of Representatives, said that the outside groups do not represent Burns or Harney County, explaining, \\"They're trying to use the misfortune of the Hammonds to further the interests of the Bundys.\\" U.S. Representative Greg Walden from Oregon said in his speech on the floor of the House that \\"I am not condoning this takeover in any way. I want to make that clear. I don't think it is appropriate. There is a right to protest. I think they have gone too far. But I understand and hear their anger.\\" In a January 6 press release, the Western States Sheriffs' Association (WSSA), an organization representing 800 sheriffs in the Western United States, said its mission was to \\"promote the office of Sheriff and to assist our member Sheriffs on issues of mutual concern\\" and that it had offered Harney County Sheriff David Ward to organize out-of-state resources to send to Oregon if requested. The WSSA statement went on to note that it did not \\"support efforts of any individual or groups who utilize intimidation, threats or fear in order to further an agenda.\\" Following the end of the occupation, U.S. Representative Jason Chaffetz from Utah introduced a bill which would ban the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and United States Forest Service (USFS) from law enforcement activities on federal lands and would transfer the responsibility to local sheriffs instead—a key demand of the militants. Other organizations Immediately following the seizure of the refuge, the Harney County School District ordered all schools in the county to be closed for one week. The Oregon Cattlemen's Association, while maintaining that it still supported the Hammonds, released a statement that declared it did \\"not support illegal activity taken against the government. This includes militia takeover of government property, such as the Malheur Wildlife Refuge.\\" In a January 4 statement released by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, church leaders said they \\"strongly condemn the armed seizure of the facility and are deeply troubled by the reports that those who have seized the facility suggest that they are doing so based on scriptural principles. This armed occupation can in no way be justified on a scriptural basis.\\" Story originally titled, \\"Why the Oregon occupiers are citing the Book of Mormon's 'military stud muffin'\\". The group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) launched a publicity stunt on January 5 by sending a delegation to the area to give vegan jerky to militia members. The Audubon Society of Portland, in a written statement, said that the \\"occupation of Malheur by armed, out of state militia groups puts one of America's most important wildlife refuges at risk. It violates the most basic principles of the public trust doctrine and holds hostage public lands and public resources to serve the very narrow political agenda of the occupiers.\\" Beginning at the end of January, the Oregon Natural Desert Association (ONDA) and other Oregon- based conservation groups have begun efforts to mobilize volunteers who are interested in assisting environmental restoration at the refuge after the occupation ends. ONDA announced that more than 600 people from all over the Pacific Northwest responded to their calls. Other On February 3, additional security officers were sent to national wildlife refuges in southern Oregon, northern California, and Nevada in response to the occupation. = Online response = The militants were mocked on social media, with commentators ridiculing the groups as \\"Y'all Qaeda\\" (in reference to American dialectical Y'all and the group al-Qaeda). Twitter hashtags such as \\"#OregonUnderAttack,\\" \\"#VanillaISIS\\" (Vanilla Ice and ISIS), \\"#Yeehawdists\\" (Yeehaw and Jihadists), \\"#Yokelharam\\" (Yokel and Boko Haram), and \\"#Talibundy\\" (Taliban and the Bundy surname) were used. After the militants asked their supporters for food and fuel donations to be sent to them, internet trolls mailed the militants numerous packages of glitter and sex paraphernalia. = ISIL-sympathizers = Some supporters of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) congratulated the takeover on social media and called for ISIL partisans in the U.S. to provide support to the militias. One self-identified ISIL supporter, using the nom de guerre Abu Adriatic Irhabi, wrote that \\"these rebels have military experience and are trained in warfare. They may be able to degrade and destroy their corrupt, evil, and oppressive government, or at the least severely damage its operations.\\" = Ursula K. Le Guin's letter = Writer Ursula K. Le Guin, a resident of Oregon, wrote in a letter to the editor to The Oregonian that \\"Ammon Bundy and his bullyboys aren't trying to free federal lands, but to hold them hostage. I can't go to the Malheur refuge now, though as a citizen of the United States, I own it and have the freedom of it.\\" Le Guin referred to the militants as \\"a flock of Right-Winged Loonybirds.\\" Debates over the definition of terrorism A Joint Intelligence Bulletin released by the United States Department of Homeland Security and the FBI on January 29 classified the militants as \\"domestic extremists,\\" which they define as: > [I]ndividuals located in the United States who seek to advance political or > social goals, wholly or in part through force or violence, in violation of > federal law. Note: the mere advocacy of political or social positions, use > of strong rhetoric, or generalized philosophic embrace of violent tactics > may not constitute extremism and may be constitutionally protected. The occupation sparked a public debate on whether the militants should be classified as \\"terrorists,\\" and some commentators were critical of the government's decision to \\"wait out the occupiers rather than charge in with guns blazing.\\" A version of this article appeared in print on January 6, 2016, in the Opinion section of the Los Angeles Times with the headline \\"Oregon 'terrorists.'\\" A number of commentators viewed the law enforcement response to the occupation as more lenient than the treatment accorded to Black Lives Matter protesters, with some terming this an example of white privilege. Others say that this is a case of the wealthy being granted special treatment, both in the media and by law enforcement, and that racial inequality is being used to distract from wider issues of social inequality.

It is one of the most venerated Christian icons (dated at the 12-13th centuries), attracting many Christian pilgrims of different religious denominations from all over the world as it is considered to be miraculous, according to tradition. Like some other old icons it was believed to have been painted by St Luke the Evangelist from its living subjects. Art history The Madonna di Sant’Alessio is a fine and early example of the iconography of the Haghiosoritissa type (Paraklesis). The Icon of the \\"Madonna di Sant’Alessio\\" is thought to have been painted in Byzantium. It was painted with tempera on canvas. The cloth was pasted on a wooden board (probably of cedar) measuring 70 x 40 cm. Art and church historians disagree about when the icon was created. According to older church traditions, the icon dates to the Early Christian period. However, today most art historians believe the date of the Madonna of St. Alexis is either the 12th and the 13th century. In Italy this icon is known as «Madonna di Edessa» (\\"Edessa Icon of Madonna\\"), «Madonna Avvocata» («Protectress») and «Madonna dell'Intercessione» («Our Lady of Intercession\\" ) since it matches the poses of the Virgin in the common image of the Deesis, a Greek word that means \\"supplication\\"). In the Deesis the mercy of Christ as judge is invoked by figures of the Virgin and Saint John the Evangelist flanking Christ. More specifically: the icon of the Madonna of St. Alexis refers to the theme of the prayer of Intercession in a way that is different from the scenes in which the Lord is represented. It has a connection with a certain type of Marian imagery that can be found both in Constantinople and in Rome. The Madonna on the icon is represented without the Child, turning to a side, with the upper body slightly inclined as though carrying a weight, with one hand extended forward and the other raised to indicate that she intercedes for those who have no other hope but in Her alone. The Madonna of St. Alexis reveals faithful adherence to the Byzantine pattern. One element is the dimness and softness of the colors, while some other details (asymmetric shape of the lengthened face, eyes with intense look, wide and thin mouth) reveal the search of a dramatic effect on the part of the artist. The Icon must have undergone some renovations over the centuries. Probably there was some retouching on the occasion of its Canonical coronation that took place in 1645, by pontifical decree (Pope Innocent X).List of canonically crowned images In 1952 the icon underwent restoration and cleaning on the Somascan Fathers' initiative. In 2014-2015 the High Institute for Conservation and Restoration (ISCR) in Rome carried out another restoration of the \\"Madonna of St. Alexius\\" after which it was returned to Basilica of St. Alexius.A Roma l’Iscr scopre il volto originale della Madonna di Sant’AlessioIL RESTAURO DELLA MADONNA DI SANT’ALESSIO. Una giornata di studio dedicata al restauro della Madonna di Sant’Alessio Legend According to the legend, the icon was brought to Rome by the metropolitan Sergius Damascus in 977, after it had been kept in Edessa church of the Blessed Virgin for a long time. There had been many miracles from the icon so that it was known as a miraculous image. The history of the icon is closely related to the legend about St. Alexius, the only son of Euphemianus, a wealthy Christian Roman of the senatorial class. Alexius fled his arranged marriage to follow his holy vocation. Disguised as a beggar, he lived on the porch of the church in Edessa (Mesopotamia) for seventeen years.\\"Saint Alexius of Rome\\", Magnificat Eating only bread and drinking only water he prayed day and night near the icon of the Blessed Virgin, accepting alms, even from his own household slaves, who had been sent to look for him but did not recognize him, until a miraculous voice of the Blessed Virgiin Mary from the Icon singled him out as a \\"Man of God\\".VITALE BOVARONE, vol II, 2006; 510-514. Dalla Legenda aurea di Iacopo da Varazze, LEGGENDA LATINA DI SANT’ALESSIO, cap. XCIV; Fleeing the resultant notoriety, he returned to Rome, so changed that his parents did not recognize him, but as good Christians took him in and sheltered him for seventeen years, which he spent in a dark cubbyhole beneath the stairs, praying and teaching catechism to children. After his death, his family found writings on his body which told them who he was and how he had lived his life of penance from the day of his wedding, for the love of God. So the icon from an Edessa church where Alexis had prayed daily for seventeen years, was called the \\"Madonna of St. Alexis\\". When the icon was brought to Rome, it was placed in the church dedicated to St. Alexius (Basilica of the Saints Bonifacio and Alexis) where his holy relics could be found. According to another legendary version, the icon is thought to have been brought from the East by St. Alexius himself. The \\"Madonna di Sant’Alessio\\" is a wonderful object of interest and devotion to be seen in the Chapel of the Most Holy Sacrament on the right side of the south transept of the basilica. The Chapel was built by Abbot Angelo Porro in 1674, restructured in 1750-1755, modified in 1814 by Charles IV of Spain (during his exile in the monastery of St. Alexis). It was restored by Antonio Munoz in 1935. The icon can be found above the altar of this Chapel. In Rome there is one other icon of this type – the Madonna of Santa Maria in Ara Coeli in the basilica beside the \\"Campidoglio\\". References Bibliography * Holweck, F.

Background  The Sophia Naturalization Act 1705 provided that all the children and descendants of Electress Sophia of Hanover, with the exception of Roman Catholics, shall be naturalized as British subjects. The Act was repealed by the British Nationality Act 1948, with the proviso that every person who was a British subject before the entry of force of the Act shall continue to be a British subject. Prince Ernest Augustus of Hanover, a linear descendant of the Electress Sophia, sought a declaration that he was a British subject under the 1705 and 1948 Acts. The Attorney-General opposed the application, arguing that Parliament had not intended to naturalize a large number of remote descendants of the Electress Sophia when it passed the Sophia Naturalization Act 1705. It was argued that the 1705 Act's preamble suggested that Parliament did not intend to naturalize remote descendants of the Electress Sophia. In the High Court, Vaisey J found against the plaintiff.[1955] 3 All E.R. 647 ; [1955] Ch. 440 Prince Ernest appealed to the Court of Appeal, where Evershed MR, Birkett and Romer LJJ reversed the High Court's decision.[1955] 3 All ER 647; [1956] 1 Ch. 188 The Attorney-General then appealed to the House of Lords. The Attorney-General and Bryan Clauson appeared for the appellant; Richard Wilberforce and John Knox appeared for the respondent.  House of Lords  The House of Lords upheld the Court of Appeal's decision. Viscount Simonds held that the words of the 1705 Act clearly naturalized all the linear, non-Catholic descendants of Electress Sophia of Hanover, no matter how remote. Concerning the Act's preamble, Lord Simonds stated that: > if enacting words are plain and unambiguous one does not need to look at the > preamble to an Act of Parliament, but if they are not clear and unambiguous > one may look at it. [1957] AC 436, HL, 452 Prince Ernest's claim was allowed and he was recognized as a British subject. At the time of the case, it was pointed out privately that the Act in 1705, could not make him A ‘British’ citizen, only an ‘English ‘ citizen, since Great Britain only came into existence as an international state in 1707, following the Treaty of Union, but the point was not raised in the court case.

In 2009, Mayor Plaza II began construction of a new three-story councilor's building, but construction was halted due to lack of funds. The councilor's building was finally completed in 2013 as a two-story building, and the rescue office was also opened. In 2014, a command center was added to the city hall.

The work was commissioned by the BBC and was composed between 2002 and 2003. It was given its world premiere by the BBC Symphony Orchestra under the direction of Jukka-Pekka Saraste on September 30, 2003 at the Barbican Centre, London. Composition The Concerto for Orchestra has a duration of roughly 28 minutes and is composed in five numbered movements played without pause. =Instrumentation= The work is scored for a large orchestra comprising three flutes (3rd doubling alto flute and piccolo), three oboes (3rd doubling cor anglais), four clarinets (3rd doubling E-flat clarinet; 4th doubling bass clarinet), three bassoons (3rd doubling contrabassoon), four horns, four trumpets (4th doubling trumpet in D), three trombones, tuba, timpani, three percussionists, piano (doubling celesta), harp, and strings. Reception The Concerto for Orchestra has been praised by music critics. Steven Pritchard of The Guardian compared the work favorably to Lindberg's Campana In Aria, saying the \\"Concerto for Orchestra is altogether more commanding.\\" Annette Morreau of The Independent wrote, \\"In recent years, Lindberg has written a series of purely orchestral pieces and a series of concertos; this work is a triumphant combination of the two with real concertante demands on all sections of the orchestra and the occasional big solo for individual members.\\" She added, \\"Lindberg, in his mid-forties, has come of age: this is a piece on another level with extraordinary confidence, boldness of gesture and an architectural logic that makes it at once familiar. Lindberg's harmonic language is now so rich and varied, consonance, if anything, more evident than dissonance.\\" The music was similarly praised by Steven Pritchard of The Observer and Joshua Kosman of the San Francisco Chronicle, who called the piece \\"a grandiose canvas\\". Andrew Clements of The Guardian compared the work to Lindberg's Sculpture, observing: Conversely, Richard Whitehouse of Gramophone was more critical of the work, remarking: Recording A recording of the Concerto for Orchestra, performed by the Finnish Radio Symphony Orchestra under the direction of Sakari Oramo, was released through Ondine on January 1, 2008.

The event was headlined by a UFC Welterweight Championship bout between then champion Robbie Lawler and top contender Tyron Woodley. A UFC Flyweight Championship bout between current champion Demetrious Johnson and challenger Wilson Reis was expected to serve as the co-main event. However, on July 8, it was announced that Johnson pulled out due to an undisclosed injury and the bout was rescheduled for UFC on Fox 24. Reis was expected to remain on the card against promotional newcomer Sean Santella, but a few days later Santella announced the bout was scrapped because the UFC said \\"he needed to get more medicals done and there wasn't enough time\\". In turn, Reis faced Hector Sandoval, another newcomer. Cláudio Silva was expected to face Siyar Bahadurzada at the event. However, on June 16, Silva pulled out due to injury and was replaced by Jorge Masvidal. In turn, Bahadurzada pulled out of the bout on July 12 citing an illness and was replaced by The Ultimate Fighter: United States vs. United Kingdom winner Ross Pearson. Ray Borg was expected to face Fredy Serrano at the event, but pulled out on July 21 due to injury and was replaced by Ryan Benoit. Justin Scoggins was expected to face Ian McCall in a flyweight bout.

Distinguished by the enormous tusks with which males fight, it was saved from extinction by a captive breeding programme and translocation: the entire world population is descended from a male and two females captured and bred in captivity in 1998, just before the species went extinct in the wild. Motuweta isolata is the largest of the three tusked wētā species, and the most endangered wētā, ranked Nationally Critical by the Department of Conservation.  Taxonomy  Motuweta isolata was discovered in 1970 on Middle Island (Atiu in Māori) in the Mercury Islands group by herpetologist Tony Whitaker, and was nicknamed \\"Jaws\\". It was 15 years before more specimens were collected for research, and another 12 years before the species was finally described and named in 1997. Its name derives from the Māori word motu, or island. It was placed in its own genus, in a different subfamily to the Northland tusked wētā Anisoura nicobarica. Subsequent genetic research suggests that in fact all three known tusked wētā species are closely related, with their nearest relatives in New Caledonia, and should be classified in the same subfamily or even the same genus.  Description  Motuweta isolata on Korapuki Island M. isolata is the largest tusked wētā, 90 mm long. Captive males can weigh 28 g and females 37 g, though wild specimens are generally smaller: 23 and 25 g. Adult males have long brown tusks curving from their mandibles, projecting far in front of their head; these vary significantly in size between males. They use these to spar with other males in territorial pushing contests, each trying to overturn the other. If disturbed, they will raise their forelegs, hiss, and gnash their jaws; they stridulate by rubbing their femurs against their abdomen, and males can make a rasping noise by rubbing their tusks together. Both sexes will also defecate foul-smelling liquid faeces. Despite these displays, they rarely bite when handled. Eggs are laid in the soil and take anywhere from three to nine months to hatch. From hatching to adulthood takes 16–17 months, and adults live for 6–10 months after their final moult.  Ecology  Motuweta illustrated by Des Helmore Mercury Islands tusked wētā are nocturnal, hiding underground during the day. They dig a burrow and underground chamber, plaster and smooth the walls with saliva, back in, and seal the entrance with a plug made of soil and saliva. They are reluctant to emerge, coming out during the darkest nights when it is warm and moist and there is little moonlight. This seems to be a strategy for avoiding tuatara and the numerous lizards on the forest floor: M. isolata translocated to islands with fewer predators are more willing to emerge at night. M. isolata is largely carnivorous, feeding on invertebrates in the leaf litter, but will also eat plant material in captivity.  Distribution and conservation  Motuweta isolata on Middle Island, 1993 Motuweta isolata are known naturally from just one island: Atiu/Middle Island in the Mercurys, an island group off the eastern coast of the Coromandel Peninsula. Middle Island is small, just , and free of introduced mammals, although it has several species of predators: giant centipedes, tuatara, lizards, and morepork. The island also has ground wētā (Hemiandrus) and a large population of burrow-nesting seabirds. M. isolata were growing increasingly scarce on Middle Island during the 1990s, with an estimated population of less than 200, so a breeding programme was set up at the DSIR's Mt Albert Research Centre. In 1993–94, and again in 1998, two female and one male wētā were captured and bred in captivity by DOC ranger Rob Chappell and other entomologists. The first batch failed, but the 1998 trial produced 181 hatchlings, and 77 more in the second generation. In 2000–2001, 130 of the first generation of captive bred wētā were released onto two other islands in the Mercury group, Moturehu/Double Island and Whakau/Red Mercury. These islands had been cleared of their only mammalian predator, kiore, in 1989 and 1991. Regular monitoring showed immature wētā, indicating breeding, and the species has continued to spread and increase on both islands. Tracking tunnels showed that they were spreading out from their release site on Red Mercury by 50–100 m each year. This breeding programme was just in time, because tusked wētā were disappearing from Middle Island. In the 1980s, dozens could be seen in a single night, but between 1998 and 2003 biologists searched for a total of 64 nights and found only four. None have been seen there since 2001, despite eight searches between 2009 and 2012. Middle Island tusked wētā have either gone extinct on Middle Island, or dropped to such low numbers that they are undetectable. It is possible that Middle Island is drier than the rest of the Mercury Islands, and a prolonged drought drove the population there to extinction. One conservation concern for Mercury Islands tusked wētā is loss of genetic diversity: from 2000 to 2009, 567 captive-bred individuals were released onto six islands, all descended from two females and a male taken from Middle Island in 1998. As well as the healthy populations on Moturehu and Red Mercury, there are now M. isolata on Ohinau (where they are also thriving), Stanley, Korapuki, and Cuvier Islands, all cleared of mammalian predators, and the species seems safe from extinction.

Billboard hacking or billboard hijacking is the practice of altering a billboard without the consent of the owner. It may involve physically pasting new media over the existing image, or hacking into the system used to control electronic billboard displays. The aim is to replace the programmed video with a different video or image. The replaced media may be displayed for various reasons, including culture jamming, shock value, promotion, activism, political propaganda, or simply to amuse viewers.  History  Billboard hacking started when commercial messages appeared in public space. In the first centuries BC, inscriptions promoting gladiatorial battles on the houses of the wealthiest in Pompeii commonly encountered passers-by who would inscribe their own humorous or insulting responses. The commercialisation of paint markers and spray paint in the 1960s helped popularise the practice. During May 1968 protests in Paris, protesters wrote over billboards to give voice to their messages. A decade later, the first collectives of billboard hackers emerged. In San Francisco, the Billboard Liberation Front altered the meaning of a diverse range of billboards by selectively adding or removing words. In Sydney, the Billboard Utilising Graffitists Against Unhealthy Promotions, a collective of activists and medical professionals, used spray paint to alter the words and images of billboards promoting cigarettes and alcohol. In 1984, the art collective Frères Ripoulain collaborated with the American artist Keith Haring to paint over billboards on the platform of Metro Dupleix in Paris. The action is followed by an illicit exhibition on the platform.  Self-promotion  A Russian daredevil group called Ontheroofs hacked into a billboard atop a skyscraper in Hong Kong, causing it to display the name of their organization, a video of a previous climb up the then unfinished Shanghai Tower, and the words \\"What's Up Hong Kong\\". Two college students in Belgrade, Serbia hacked into a billboard and then contacted the owner describing the vulnerability. The hack allowed them to play Space Invaders and then display \\"Hacked4Fun\\". The students were thanked by the owner for pointing out the vulnerability and each given an iPad Mini. In Republic Square, Belgrade, Serbia, hackers caused a billboard to display an advertisement for The Pirate Bay which read \\"First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win.\\"  Activism  A billboard hijacked by the Billboard Liberation Front A group named \\"Brandalism\\" has been hacking European billboards since 2012. Around November 2015, just prior to the Paris climate talks (COP21), street artists joined with this group and gained control of around 600 billboards around Paris making display the message \\"We'll keep on bribing politicians and emitting greenhouse gases\\" and a Volkswagen promotion reading \\"We're sorry that we got caught.\\" In London, students recreated film posters with black leads and installed them in bus shelter advertising spaces. These posters sought to highlight the lack of black representation in popular culture.  Legal response  Depending on the circumstances, billboard hacking may be illegal. The FBI opened an investigation following the display of the obscene Goatse image on a billboard in Buckhead, Atlanta. In another instance, one man was sentenced to 18 months in prison for displaying pornography on a Moscow billboard. Non-electronic billboard hacks have rarely led to arrests. One study warned corporate clients that attempts to prosecute billboard hackers would likely cause more bad publicity than the original offence, and suggested the best response may be to \\"address any criticisms raised.\\"  Methods  An example of hijacking using détournement Control over the display of electronic billboards may be achieved by hacking. One possible way of doing this is by knowing the default password provided by the manufacturer as the customer may neglect to choose a new one. Manufacturers increasingly try to prevent billboard hacking by installing CCTV cameras or embedding anti-hacking features into the software and hardware of the billboard. With non-electronic billboards, the image may simply be pasted over with a new image, or, the original image modified using the technique of détournement.

Marks (28 October 1882 – 22 September 1971), was an Australian ophthalmologist. He studied first as a geologist, and then began a second career as an ophthalmologist. His work on preventing trachoma in children was significant in reducing eye disease in remote communities.  Early life  Marks was born at Wickham Terrace, Brisbane, Queensland, the son of Charles and Elizabeth Marks. His mother had three sons from her first marriage to Robert Dods, including Robin Dods and Espie Dods. Charles Marks was a doctor and would later become a member of the Queensland Legislative Council. Charles and Elizabeth had four children, including Alexander Marks. Ted Marks attended the Southport College in 1895 and Brisbane Grammar School from 1896 to 1900. His family sent him to Ireland to study engineering at Trinity College, Dublin, alongside his brother Alexander Marks (1880-1954), who was studying medicine. Marks graduated with a BA in January 1905 and a BAI (engineering) in December 1905. He took every possible prize for a student of Engineering including geology, mining, metallurgy and palaeontology distinctions. After practical experience on the Isle of Man, Wales and England, he spent a further year at the Royal School of Mines in London studying metallurgy. Although offered a job with the Geological Survey of India, he elected to return to Australia.  Early career  Upon his return to Brisbane, Marks worked at Mount Morgan Mines as a metallurgist, and then joined the Geological Survey of Queensland in 1908 as Assistant Government Geologist, preparing one of the first geological maps of Queensland. His first job was to survey the coal resources of the Southeast Moreton District. The map he produced in 1910, \\"Geological map of south east Moreton coal measures\\" was one of the most consulted maps in Queensland history. His report a “Deep- sinking Proposal on the Charters Towers Mineral Field”, which included a scale model, was displayed at the Brisbane Exhibition, in August 1913. After becoming engaged to childhood friend, Nesta Drury in 1913, Marks returned to study in Ireland, pursuing a medical degree. After their marriage in London in July 1914, they moved to Dublin. He was a Resident at St Patrick Dun's Hospital during the Easter Rising in Dublin of 1916. After completing medical studies in 1916, Marks joined the Royal Army Medical Corps, during World War I as he could not join the Australian Infantry Force (AIF) without returning to Australia. However he contracted rheumatic fever in the trenches of France and was invalided out of the army, with the rank of Captain. He and Nesta's only child, Elizabeth Nesta (Pat) Marks was born in 1918 in Dublin, Ireland. Marks graduated with his MD in 1919, but concerns about the lingering effect of rheumatic fever on his stamina, induced him to pursue ophthalmology. He was a Resident at the Royal Victoria Eye and Ear Hospital in Dublin, and then a locum at the Shrewsbury Eye and Ear Hospital, before returning to Australia in 1920.  Later career  Marks would demonstrate a particular interest in children's health in his work as an eye specialist. He would become a member of the Ophthalmological Society of Australia and an Honorary Member of the Brisbane Children's Hospital from 1921 to 1938. He was a senior ophthalmologist from 1938 to 1946. From 1932 he was also part-time Ophthalmologist to the Queensland School Health Services. Marks was in charge of the Wilson Ophthalmic Hostel for Trachomatous Children at Windsor and made four surveys of the eye disease, trachoma in western Queensland. He was for many years Councillor and Deputy Chairman of the Queensland Bush Children's Health Scheme, and a Councillor of the Royal Flying Doctor Service in Queensland. To quote Dorothy Hill (Queensland Naturalist 20 4/6, 1972), “His work for trachomatous children practically eliminated this disease from western Queensland”. By 1953, the Wilson Hostel closed for lack of patients, due to his team's work in identifying and treating the disease. He retired from practice in 1957.  Professional memberships  In 1922, Marks became a Foundation Member of the Great Barrier Reef Committee. The Committee organised the Michaelmas Cay and Heron Island bores of the Great Barrier Reef in 1927 and 1937. They also worked at establishing the 1928-1929 Great Barrier Reef (Yonge) Expedition to Low Isles Reef. Marks served as Chairman of the Great Barrier Reef Committee from 1947 to 1954, following the death of Henry Caselli Richards, who had established the Committee with Sir Matthew Nathan. He played an important part in the establishment of the Heron Island Research Station, along with Dr Dorothy Hill. Marks continued to serve in the military after his return to Australia, as a Captain and Army Ophthalmologist in the AAMC from 1923 until 1939. He also served as Wing Commander and a Consultant in the RAAF for six years. The Marks family held a strong view on the importance of science in the community, and belonged to many societies. At different times Marks was a member and office holder in the Royal Society of Queensland. He was elected an Honorary Life Member in 1954. He was also a member of the Geological Society of Australia, the Royal Historical Society of Queensland, the Anthropological Society of Queensland, the National Parks Association of Queensland, and the National Trust of Queensland.  Legacy  Marks died in 1971. He was survived by his daughter, Pat Marks, who was an entomologist with the Queensland Institute of Medical Research. The Marks family were strongly motivated to preserve history and during their lifetime they donated furniture and artefacts to the Queensland Museum, and in time donated both professional and personal objects to a number of museums around Brisbane. These included personal correspondence, scientific specimens, furnitures and the family's property at Samford, which was donated to QUT. Items from E.O. Marks can be found at the Queensland Museum, Queensland State Library, and a number of smaller military and medical museums.

He was the third Minister President of the state of North Rhine- Westphalia from 1956 until 1958. Early life Steinhoff was born in 1897 in a miner's family and grew up in Unna. He became a miner at the age of seventeen. Steinhoff was drafted into the Navy in 1917 and served on a torpedo boat until 1919. He returned to his job as a miner and joined the SPD. He belonged to a nationalistic section of the Young Socialists in the SPD. In 1922, he went to the European Academy of Work in the University of Frankfurt to hear lectures about business and politics from lectures such as Franz Oppenheimer. Due to unemployment, Steinhoff went to Berlin, where he worked and attended Deutsche Hochschule für Politik. Career In 1926 he was a volunteer at the SPD party newspaper, Westfälische Allgemeine Volkszeitung (WAVZ), in Dortmund. A year later Steinhoff became managing director of newspaper distribution, and became the party secretary in Hagen. In the 1929 local elections, the SPD reached a majority, and Steinhoff was an honorary magistrate for Youth Sport Care and city gardening. =1933–1945= After the seizure of power by the Nazi Party, Steinhoff was arrested several times for vigorously opposing the party. He later worked at a stove and oven cleaning business from 1937 until his sentence in 1938, where Steinhoff was sentenced to three years in prison, due to smuggling the Vorwärts into Germany in 1934, after the banning of the newspaper in 1933. He worked again as a laborer after his release in 1941. After the assassination attempt on 20 July 1944, Steinhoff was arrested again and was sent to the Sachsenhausen concentration camp. In 1945, Steinhoff was in a death march, being liberated by American troops in Mecklenburg. =Rise in the SPD: 1945–1957= After World War II, Steinhoff became a city councilor for Iserlohn. In 1946 he was the mayor of Hagen. Despite the CDU having a majority in the city council after the local elections, Steinhoff retained his office until 1956. He was a member of the first Landtag of North Rhine-Westphalia, of which he was the Minister of Reconstruction in the cabinet of Karl Arnold. In 1950, Steinhoff became the Vice Chairman of the SPD group in the state parliament, and after the death of Fritz Henßlers in 1953, took over as the chairman, leading the party into the 1954 election, before losing to a coalition between the CDU and the FDP. =Social-liberal coalition: 1956–1958= After a conflict between the CDU/CSU and the FDP, the FDP turned on the CDU in North Rhine-Westphalia. Steinhoff was using the \\"Young Turks\\" in the FDP successfully in a motion of no confidence put against Arnold. The social-liberal coalition was dependent on support from the center, so the coalition made several reforms, including in the fields of research of nuclear energy and the reform of municipal financial compensation. In the parliamentary election of 1958, the SPD were able to win votes alongside the FDP and the center, but suffered electoral losses. The CDU won an absolute majority and Franz Meyers became Minister President. =Bundestag:1958–1965= Monument to Fritz Steinhoff at Friedrich-Ebert-Platz in Hagen Steinhoff was the chairman of the Ruhr Regional Association in 1958.

It was released by S.M. Entertainment on May 11, 2016. Lee Soo-man, former president of S.M. Entertainment, served as executive producer on the EP. The EP marked the official solo debut of Tiffany after having been known as a member of South Korean girl group Girls' Generation for nearly nine years. Musically, the record is a primarily synthpop album with elements of trap and R&B; that draws heavy influence from American female artists of the 1990s. Tiffany promoted the EP in South Korea by holding a debut showcase at SMTown COEX Artium in Seoul on May 10, 2016 and through a six-leg concert titled Weekend-Tiffany in June 2016. She also appeared on several music shows including M Countdown and Show Champion. The title track \\"I Just Wanna Dance\\" was released as the lead single from the EP. Upon its release, I Just Wanna Dance received generally favorable reviews from music critics, who praised Tiffany's vocals while comparing its styles to those of works by Carly Rae Jepsen, Ariana Grande and Mariah Carey. The EP was also well received commercially, peaking at numbers three on South Korea's Gaon Album Chart and US Billboard World Albums Chart. Background and development Since 2007, South Korea-based American singer Stephanie Young Hwang (better known by her stage name Tiffany) has been known to be a member of the popular girl group Girls' Generation. During the early part of her career, her solo work mostly involved songs recorded for side projects and original soundtracks. In May 2016, Tiffany became the second Girls' Generation member, after fellow member Taeyeon, to officially debut as a solo artist, releasing her debut album, titled I Just Wanna Dance. Tiffany began working on her solo record during the summer of 2015, having the mindset of it being the \\"transition into the next chapter of [her] music career.\\" She recalled having long meetings with her label, S.M. Entertainment, to figure out the music concepts for the project. Her label initially expected Tiffany to put together an album that reflects a bubbly image. However, the singer had a different idea, stating that she wanted \\"something much more chill\\". According to Tiffany, the \\"real exciting part\\" for her being a solo artist is the ability to decide her own new \\"sound\\" and \\"message\\", while still being a part of Girls' Generation. Heavily influenced by the American female artists of the 90's, Tiffany has described the album to embrace a throw-back American pop sound. She further described it as having \\"chill\\" and \\"natural\\" vibes and cited the most difficult part in putting the album together was her efforts in \\"work[ing] out of [her] comfort zone\\" and \\"learning how to push limits\\". She credited her 9-year experience being a member of girl group Girls' Generation as the force that helped making it easier for her to transition into a solo artist. She also hailed Girls' Generation member Taeyeon as \\"a big part\\" who had supported her throughout the entire process of the album preparation. Speaking of her titular title track, Tiffany expressed \\"Most girls my age, when they are stressed or want to kind of get away, they dance the night away. I think it should be everybody's theme song.\\" Since 2014, Tiffany started writing music, calling it \\"nerve-wrecking to put out music [she’s] written on [her] own.\\" One of her songs, \\"What Do I Do\\", made it to the final track list. Although Tiffany participated in both music writing and English lyrics for the track, Girls' Generation member Sooyoung helped write the Korean lyrics. Tiffany also named \\"Talk\\" as her favorite track of the album, recalling she was having a \\"fan girl moment\\" after finding out its music was written by Girls Aloud's Nicola Roberts. Known to be taking part in the artwork and visuals for previous Girls’ Generation and TTS's releases, Tiffany purposely avoided it and only wanted to focus on the music for her solo album. She, however, took a directorial role for her follow-up single \\"Heartbreak Hotel\\". The track, featuring Simon Dominic, was supposed to be a part of the album, but was pushed back and released under the SM Station digital music platform in June 2016. She explained the song was meant to be a prequel to \\"I Just Wanna Dance\\", where the woman goes through the \\"falling for the bad boy\\" stage; being heartbroken, she forgets about her stress and dances the night away.  Composition  I Just Wanna Dance is a synthpop record that draws inspiration from American retro musical styles of the 1990s with a \\"modern take.\\" The EP was noted for its American influence: Chester Chin from The Star wrote that the EP's \\"sonic DNA bears closer resemblance\\" to the likes of Carly Rae Jepsen and Selena Gomez. Most tracks are incorporated with synthesizers that gives a \\"cool\\" feel of the 1980s and the 1990s. The opening track \\"I Just Wanna Dance\\" is an electronica song that is backed by \\"icy\\" 1980s synthesizers. Entertainment Weeklys Joey Nolfi described the track as \\"bubbly electronic dance\\" that \\"recall works by Mariah Carey, Robyn, and Gwen Stefani.\\" Jeff Benjamin writing for Fuse compared Tiffany's \\"more sensual\\" vocals on the song to those of Carly Rae Jepsen and Ariana Grande while likened her \\"powerhouse\\" notes in the second chorus and the bridge to Mariah Carey's famous whistle register. \\"Talk\\" is a trap- influenced song instrumented by synthesizers, while \\"Fool\\" is characterized as a 1990s-inspired R&B; number with a \\"slow-burning\\" vocal performance. \\"What Do I Do\\" is a 2000s-inspired dance song in which Tiffany, according to Chester Chin from The Star, \\"channels R&B; diva vibe.\\" \\"Yellow Light\\" was detailed as a 1990s R&B-leaning; track, while the last track \\"Once in a Lifetime\\", as opposed to the rest of the album, is an acoustic ballad. Release and promotion On May 4, 2016, Tiffany was officially announced to be debuting as a solo artist with I Just Wanna Dance. The album was released one week after on May 11, 2016. After receiving good feedback from the international fanbase, a remix for the English version of \\"I Just Wanna Dance\\", by South Korean music producer Kago Pengchi, was released on May 23, 2016. A promotional showcase for I Just Wanna Dance, where Tiffany performed four of the album's songs for the first time, was held on May 10, 2016. Afterwards, the singer also held a live show where she interacted with fans through a Naver online app. On May 12, 2016, she made her debut performance on Mnet's weekly music television program M! Countdown. Tiffany spent June 2016 promoting the album through a series of small concerts titled Weekend. The concert was held at the SMTown COEX Artium in Gangnam, Seoul and took place on June 10–12 and June 24–26, 2016; it was a sold-out. Reception I Just Wanna Dance received positive reviews from music critics. A writer from Popjustice wrote: \\"The EP contains very good music and comes with very good artwork.\\" Jeff Benjamin writing for Fuse noted the \\"unexpected sonic and vocal environments\\" on the title track \\"I Just Wanna Dance\\" and compared its musical styles to those of Carly Rae Jepsen, Ariana Grande and Mariah Carey. He also complimented the \\"cool, synth- driven feel\\" of the EP with standouts including \\"Talk\\", \\"Yellow Light\\" and \\"Fool\\". Lee Suho from South Korean magazine IZM praised the EP's synthpop and R&B; styles and commented that Tiffany's vocals were soft enough to \\"harmonize with the sounds naturally;\\" he however picked the ballad \\"Once in a Lifetime\\" as a \\"disappointment\\" that does not fit into the EP's musical styles. Chester Chin from The Star was not enthusiastic towards the EP, writing that Tiffany opted for \\"sexy shimmering melodies\\" instead of \\"one-two punch hooks and memorable choruses\\". He concluded that the album is \\"too safe for its own good\\". Billboard ranked I Just Wanna Dance at number 7 on their list of top 10 K-pop albums of 2016. Upon the release of the album, the title track debuted at number 8 on the Twitter Top Tracks by Billboard, and number 49 on the Spotify Viral 50. Joey Nolfi from Entertainment Weekly listed \\"I Just Wanna Dance\\" as one of the six songs that their readers should be listening to during May 2016. The song was nominated for Best Dance Performance Solo and Song of the Year at the 18th Mnet Asian Music Awards. Track listing Charts { class=\\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\\" ! Chart !

It took the name Jeunes-Artistes in 1794 under the direction of Jacques Robillon who set up a troupe of child actors modeled on that of the Théâtre de l'Ambigu-Comique, which faced it (the idea was again taken over by Louis Comte and his Théâtre des Jeunes-Élèves in 1820). Despite the great success it enjoyed, the theatre was closed following the Napoleonic decree of 8 August 1807 on the limitation of Parisian theaters.

The exoplanet was found by using the transit method, in which the dimming effect that a planet causes as it crosses in front of its star is measured. The first signs of the planet were announced in 2016, but it wasn't until the following years that more information concerning the probable nature of the planet was obtained. TRAPPIST-1d is the least massive planet of the system and is likely to have a compact hydrogen-poor atmosphere similar to Venus, Earth, or Mars.https://www.space.com/39613-trappist-1-planet- atmospheres-lack-hydrogen.html It receives just 4.3% more sunlight than Earth, placing it on the inner edge of the habitable zone. It has about <5% of its mass as a volatile layer, which could consist of atmosphere, oceans, and/or ice layers. Recent studies by the University of Washington have concluded that TRAPPIST-1d might be a Venus-like exoplanet with an uninhabitable atmosphere.https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2018-11/uow-sbn112118.php  Discovery  A team of astronomers headed by Michaël Gillon of the Institut d’Astrophysique et Géophysique at the University of Liège in Belgium used the TRAPPIST (Transiting Planets and Planetesimals Small Telescope) telescope at the La Silla Observatory in the Atacama desert, Chile, to observe TRAPPIST-1 and search for orbiting planets. By utilising transit photometry, they discovered three Earth-sized planets orbiting the dwarf star; the innermost two are tidally locked to their host star while the outermost appears to lie either within the system's habitable zone or just outside of it. The team made their observations from September to December 2015 and published its findings in the May 2016 issue of the journal Nature. The original claim and presumed size of the planet was revised when the full seven-planet system was revealed in 2017: Artist's impression of the TRAPPIST-1 planetary system :\\"We already knew that TRAPPIST-1, a small, faint star some 40 light years away, was special. In May 2016, a team led by Michaël Gillon at Belgium’s University of Liege announced it was closely orbited by three planets that are probably rocky: TRAPPIST-1b, c and d... :\\"As the team kept watching shadow after shadow cross the star, three planets no longer seemed like enough to explain the pattern. “At some point we could not make sense of all these transits,” Gillon says. :\\"Now, after using the space-based Spitzer telescope to stare at the system for almost three weeks straight, Gillon and his team have solved the problem: TRAPPIST-1 has four more planets. :\\"The planets closest to the star, TRAPPIST-1b and c, are unchanged. But there’s a new third planet, which has taken the d moniker, and what had looked like d before turned out to be glimpses of e, f and g. There’s a planet h, too, drifting farthest away and only spotted once.\\" New Scientist. Exoplanet discovery Characteristics =Radius, mass, and temperature= TRAPPIST-1d was detected with the transit method, allowing scientists to accurately determine its radius. The planet is about 0.784 with a small error margin of about 147 km. Transit timing variations and complex computer simulations helped accurately determine the mass of the planet, which led to scientists being able to calculate its density, surface gravity, and composition. TRAPPIST-1d is a mere 0.297 , making it one of the least massive exoplanets yet found. It has 61.6% the density of Earth (3.39 g/cm3) and just under half the gravity. Both its mass, density, and surface gravity are the lowest in the entire TRAPPIST-1 system. In addition, the density of TRAPPIST-1d indicates a mainly rocky composition, with about ≤5% of its mass in the form of a volatile layer. The volatile layer of TRAPPIST-1d may consist of atmosphere, ocean, and/or ice layers. TRAPPIST-1d has an equilibrium temperature of , assuming an albedo of 0. For an Earth-like albedo of 0.3, the planet's equilibrium temperature is around , very similar to Earth's at .http://phl.upr.edu/projects/habitable-exoplanets- catalog/calculators =Orbit= TRAPPIST-1d is a closely orbiting planet, with one full orbit taking just 4.05 days (about 97 hours) to complete. It orbits at a distance of just 0.02228 AU from the host star, or about 2.2% the distance between Earth and the Sun. For comparison, Mercury, our Solar System's innermost planet, takes 88 days to orbit at a distance of about 0.38 AU. The size of TRAPPIST-1 and the close orbit of TRAPPIST-1d around it means that the star as seen from the planet appears 5.5 times as large as the Sun from the Earth. While a planet at TRAPPIST-1d's distance from our Sun would be a scorched world, the low luminosity of TRAPPIST-1 means that the planet gets only 1.043 times the sunlight that Earth receives, placing it within the inner part of the conservative habitable zone. =Host star= The planet orbits an (M-type) ultracool dwarf star named TRAPPIST-1. The star has a mass of 0.089 (close to the boundary between brown dwarfs and hydrogen-fusing stars) and a radius of 0.121 . It has a temperature of , and is between 3 and 8 billion years old. In comparison, the Sun is 4.6 billion years old and has a temperature of 5778 K (5504.85 °C, 9940.73 °F). The star is metal-rich, with a metallicity ([Fe/H]) of 0.04, or 109% the solar amount. This is particularly odd as such low-mass stars near the boundary between brown dwarfs and hydrogen-fusing stars should be expected to have considerably less metals than the Sun. Its luminosity () is 0.05% of that of the Sun. Stars like TRAPPIST-1 have the ability to live up to 4–5 trillion years, 400–500 times longer than the Sun will live (which the Sun only has about 5.5 billion years of lifespan left (which is almost a halftime of life)). Because of this ability to live for long periods of time, it is likely TRAPPIST-1 will be one of the last remaining stars when the Universe is much older than it is now, when the gas needed to form new stars will be exhausted, and the remaining ones begin to die off. The star's apparent magnitude, or how bright it appears from Earth's perspective, is 18.8. Therefore, it is too dim to be seen with the naked eye (the limit for that is 5.5). The star is not just very small, and far away, it also emits comparatively little visible light, mainly shining in the invisible infrared. Even, from the close in proximity of TRAPPIST-1d, about 50 times closer than Earth is from the Sun, the planet receives less than 1% the visible light Earth sees from our Sun. This would probably make the days on TRAPPIST-1d never brighter than twilight is on Earth. However, that still means that TRAPPIST-1 could easily shine at least 3000 times brighter in the sky of TRAPPIST-1d than the full moon does in Earth's night sky. Habitability There is no consensus on whether TRAPPIST-1d approaches Earth-like habitability or is subject to a severe greenhouse effect. In some respects,TRAPPIST-1d is one of the most Earth-like exoplanets found. While being significantly smaller, it receives about the same amount of irradiation as Earth and appears to be very similar in temperature as well. It does not have a large hydrogen-based atmosphere, which would render the planet uninhabitable if one were to exist. The planet may also have liquid water, up to about 250 times more water than all of Earth's oceans. TRAPPIST-1d has one of the highest earth similarity indexes of any known exoplanet, at 0.91.http://phl.upr.edu/projects/habitable-exoplanets-catalog While the planet is most likely tidally locked, its atmosphere could be enough to transfer heat around the planet and keep the climate stable. Studies by the University of Washington have concluded that TRAPPIST-1d may be a Venus-like exoplanet with an uninhabitable atmosphere. The exoplanet is on the inside part of the expected habitable zone of its parent star (i.e. the region where, with the correct conditions and atmospheric properties, liquid water may exist on the surface of the planet). However, three-dimensional climate modeling predicts a runaway greenhouse effect, although small quantity of water may have persisted in limited regions beyond the early hot phase in the planet's history. TRAPPIST-1d may resist a runaway greenhouse effect, especially if it has an Earth-like albedo of ≥0.3, according to other analyses. The same researchers point out that the proximity of TRAPPIST-1d to the host star could result in geothermal activity, and tidal heating at the bottom of any hypothetical oceans.

Within the book, Sarris explores the factions of Unionist and Confederate sympathizers that were present from 1861 to 1865.  Appalachian wartime experience  Sarris' focus is to examine \\"the wartime experiences of Fannin and Lumpkin counties, located in the southern spur of the Blue Ridge Mountains.\\" The experiences of these counties during this period are complicated by the allegiances of the local leaders toward different centers of political power. Lumpkin county was more connected to the Georgia capital than Fannin county and was therefore more open to the idea of secession in comparison. Fannin county did not have the access to the Georgia capital that Lumpkin did during this time, so the political leaders of Fannin leaned more toward federal law rather than state law and thus did not support secession as much as their neighboring county. Sarris describes an area that was far from uniform in its ideology within his book. The notion that there could be any clear dividing lines within the region is challenged constantly throughout by Sarris. This book offers a unique look at the war's impact on Appalachia and according to Sarris, \\"attempts to analyze a region of the Confederacy that has not been extensively studied.\\" The book also explores the validity of Appalachian exceptionalism.  Guerrilla warfare in North Georgia  A Separate Civil War offers a look at the Civil War beyond the glorious battlefields that are often romanticized by other works and describes the far less romantic guerrilla warfare that \\"escaped Ken Burns's sepia tinted camera lens.\\" This facet of the Civil War is only recently being discovered by historians and scholars.

Hazard would survey the works necessary to raise the Lehigh to make it navigable, at least temporarily enough to float coal barges past obstacles and the constant-grade road bed which descended about in from Summit Hill, PA to the coal chute designed by White to load barges at Mauch Chunk, the infant town shown in this 1832 painting. Erskine Hazard (1790-1865),dates reference a younger son of the first United States Postmaster Ebenezer Hazard, became the partner of Josiah White about 1810 when around 19 years old. White and Hazard together established themselves as innovative businessman with a bent for novel and clever engineering, a fearless business disposition and willingness to work extremely hard. Together they spearheaded efforts that enabled the industrial revolution, the advancement of steam power, and of railroading--creating the infrastructure and business climate to accelerate the Northeast out of an agrarian society to the industrial power that manhandled the South in the Civil War in just forty years. The Partnership Together they put together the wherewithal to open a foundry and wire drawing plant on the falls of the Schuylkill River near Philadelphia in 1810.Bohlin Their first reputation establishing event was to build a small suspension bridge across the Schuylkill in order to better demonstrate their factory. When the US President put an embargo in place on Bituminous Coal imports from Great Britain in the tension prior to the War of 1812, the partners moved to secure an anthracite supply, which was an barely known, much misunderstood unexploited commodity at that time. Its discovery was credited to various individuals in widely varying locales by different historiansNungesser, pp73-74 but history speaks more clearly about that find which was first to be regularly commercially exploited, and inspire a revolution in energy use in the young United States. It was the outcrop stumbled over by the hunter Philip Ginter in 1791 that lead to the Lehigh Coal Mining Company (LCMC, 1792), then in 1818, the Lehigh Coal Company and the Lehigh Navigation Company a few months afterwards. White and Hazard were principals in both. Pioneering Educated as a geographer and surveyor Hazard would compliment White's mechanical innovations with resourceful use of given landforms and the two would go on together to found what is arguably the most influential company of the first half of the 19th century, the Lehigh Coal & Navigation Company, build the Lehigh Canal, the Ashley Planes, the Lehigh and Susquehanna Railroad, and a half-dozen other subsidiary railroads and industries, most of which would last into the 1960s. They also had a major role in inspiring the use by others of the hard to burn 'rock coal', Anthracite--initially only in industrial processes, and together brought about the opening up of a trickle in supply brought into Philadelphia along the Schuylkill River valley. Hazard the geographer and surveyor pioneered a technique which became standardized in the rail transport industry, and indeed, adopted in building many roads and ramps; that of dividing the overall height (the rise) from the starting reference point to the destination by the distance (or run)--then setting the grade (regardless of excavations needed, or supports needing constructed) of the road to maintain that average slope.OK, where did I read this? He used the technique when surveying the initial mule road the Lehigh Coal Company used to connect the new settlement and mines at Summit Hill, PA with the loading chute at what would become Mauch Chunk, PA. When the company decided to lay rails along the mule trail, the pre-graded slope allowed the workers to lay rails over the nine mile descent in only a few months of conversion.  Notes  Legacy Erskine Hazard died in 1865 a wealthy individual that had, along with partner-mentor Josiah White created thousands of jobs and founded whole industries unknown in their youth. Railroading grew up from the early strap iron angles attached to hardwood tracks to T-rails which have common ancestry with today's steel welded rails. Their influence goes farther than listed below, for they made many capital investments, and those which fit their overall coal-iron business were sometimes bought out when they proved successful. Others in need of additional investment were finished by the two, or by the board of LC&N; Co. then either sold off when profitable or retained as part of the LC&N; Co. family of subsidiaries, while a third were just investments made part of a portfolio, having no relation to LC&N; Co. assets other than that of a common individual owner.

Background Somalia participated in nine Summer Olympics between its debut in the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, West Germany, and the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The highest number of Somalis participating at any single Summer Games was seven at the 1984 Games in Los Angeles, United States. No Somali has ever won a medal at an Olympics. Somalia received universality slots from the International Association of Athletics Federations to send one male and one female athlete to the 2016 Summer Olympics. In 2014, the Somali Olympic Committee appointed a team of professionals to find talented Somali athletes for the upcoming Summer Olympics. Efforts were hampered by the ongoing Somali Civil War, both in access for the scouts and because athletes were fleeing the fighting. Samia Yusuf Omar, who represented the national at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, China, drowned off the Libyan coast while attempting to reach Europe by boat in 2012. Maryan Nuh Muse was chosen to compete in the women's 400 metres and Kenyan-born Mohamed Daud Mohamed in the men's 5000 metres. Other Somali nationals competed at the 2016 Summer Olympics, but under the citizenships of other countries; these included Mo Farah, for Great Britain and Mohammed Ahmed, for Canada. Mohamed was chosen to be the Somalia's flag bearer during the Parade of Nations. Athletics Somalia was represented by one male athlete at the 2016 Games in athletics – Mohamed Daud Mohamed, a 5000 metres runner. It marked his first appearance at an international athletics competition, following a transition into athletics from football. He said prior to the Olympics, \\"I am improving by the day and I hope to improve on my finish time. Running is hard and all athletes aim to win. My objective is to win; but there are different ways of winning. It is not about being first, second or third. If I set a new personal record, it is a win for me\\". Mohamed competed on 17 August in the first heat of the 5000 metres, finishing in 24th position out of the 25 runners, only ahead of Rosefelo Siosi of the Solomon Islands, thus eliminating him from the competition. The country's sole female athlete at the 2016 Games was Maryan Nuh Muse, in the 400 metres. Muse had previously competed on behalf of Somalia at international youth athletic competitions around the world. Prior to the competition, she spoke of the difference in the quality of the training facilities in Somalia compared to those in other countries, saying \\"A number of countries will be participating among them Jamaica and United States; but I am hoping to shine. We don’t have the same training facilities, theirs is better than ours. I know they are determined to win but we are also equally determined.\\" She competed in the sixth heat of the 400 metres competition on 13 August; she came in last place with a time of 1:10:14, over 18 seconds behind the heat's winner Salwa Eid Naser of Bahrain. ;Track events {class=wikitable style=\\"font-size:90%\\" - !rowspan=\\"2\\"Athlete !rowspan=\\"2\\"Event !colspan=\\"2\\"Heat !colspan=\\"2\\"Semifinal !colspan=\\"2\\"Final -style=\\"font-size:95%\\" !Time !Rank !Time !Rank !Time !Rank -align=center align=leftMohamed Daud Mohamed align=leftMen's 5000 m 14:57.84 24 colspan=2 colspan=2Did not advance -align=center align=leftMaryan Nuh Muse align=leftWomen's 400 m 1:10.14 8 colspan=4Did not advance } References  External links  * Category:Nations at the 2016 Summer Olympics 2016 Olympics ","title":"Somalia at the 2016 Summer Olympics"},{"id":"50431227","text":"TRAPPIST-1b, also designated as 2MASS J23062928-0502285 b, is a mainly rocky, Venus-like exoplanet orbiting around the ultra-cold dwarf star TRAPPIST-1, located approximately 39 light-years (12 parsecs) away from Earth in the constellation Aquarius. The planet was detected using the transit method, where a planet dims the host star's light as it passes in front of it. It was first announced on May 2, 2016, and between 2017 and 2018, more studies were able to refine its physical parameters. The planet is about the same mass as Earth, but about 12% larger. Its relatively low density, along with spectroscopic observations, have confirmed that it has an extremely thick and hot atmosphere. Observations published in 2018 showed that the atmosphere of TRAPPIST-1b was much larger than that of Earth or Venus, as well as being very hot and potentially rich on CO2. More recent modeling studies have suggested the planet is too hot even to allow the formation of sulfuric acid clouds, as found on Venus, the hottest planet in our solar system. Characteristics =Mass, radius, and temperature= TRAPPIST-1b is very close in both mass, radius and gravity to Earth. It has a radius of 1.121 , a mass of 1.02 , and about 81% Earth's surface gravity. However, the density of the planet indicates that it is not entirely rocky. With a density of 3.98 g/cm3, about ≤5% of its mass must be water, likely in the form of a thick Venus-like atmosphere due to its high stellar flux being nearly 4 times higher than Earth's. The planet's extremely thick atmosphere has likely risen its temperature far above its equilibrium temperature of . Its surface temperature is estimated to be between and , potentially as high as . This is much hotter than the surface of Venus and can melt certain metals. =Orbit= TRAPPIST-1b orbits very close to its parent star. One orbit on this planet lasts about 1.51 Earth days, or about 36 hours. It orbits about 0.0115 AU from its star, just 1.2% the distance between Earth and the Sun. The close proximity to its host star means that TRAPPIST-1b is likely tidally locked. It also has a very circular orbit, with an eccentricity of 0.00622, significantly more circular than Earth's orbit. =Host Star= TRAPPIST-1b orbits the ultracool dwarf star TRAPPIST-1. It is 0.121 and 0.089 , with a temperature of 2511 K and an age between 3 and 8 billion years. For comparison, the Sun has a temperature of 5778 K and is about 4.5 billion years old. TRAPPIST-1 is also very dim, with about 0.0005 times the luminosity of the Sun. It is too faint to be see with the naked eye, having an apparent magnitude of 18.80. =Atmosphere= The combined transmission spectrum of TRAPPIST-1 b and c rules out a cloud- free hydrogen-dominated atmosphere for each planet, so they are unlikely to harbor an extended gas envelope. Other atmospheres, from a cloud-free water- vapor atmosphere to a Venus-like atmosphere, remain consistent with the featureless spectrum. In 2018, the planet's atmosphere was better examined with the Spitzer Space Telescope and found to be quite large and hot. The planet's transmission spectrum and refined density suggested two main possibilities for the atmosphere: one rich in carbon dioxide, and one with water vapor. The more likely CO2 atmosphere would have a scale height of approximately 52 km (with Earth's being at 8 km, and Venus's at 15.9 km) and an average temperature in excess of , far higher than its equilibrium temperature. A water vapor atmosphere would need to have a scale height of >100 km and a temperature of > to produce the variations seen in the planet's transit depths and its transmission spectrum. Other sources for the effects seen, such as hazes and thick clouds, would require an even larger atmosphere. TRAPPIST-1b will have to be studied further to confirm its potential large atmosphere.

It is the most massive and third largest planet of the system, with about 116% the mass and 110% the radius of Earth. Its density indicates a primarily rocky composition with a very thick Venus-like atmosphere, although it is expected to be thinner than that of TRAPPIST-1b. Characteristics =Mass, radius, and temperature= TRAPPIST-1c was observed with the transit method, which enabled scientists to calculate its radius. Transit-timing variations and computer simulations were able to determine the mass, density, and gravity of the planet. TRAPPIST-1c is the third-largest planet of the TRAPPIST-1 system, with a radius of 1.095 . It is also the most massive of the system as well, with a mass of 1.156 , slightly higher than that of the next most massive, TRAPPIST-1g. Despite its Earth-like mass and radius, TRAPPIST-1c has a lower density (4.89 g/cm3) and gravity (0.966g) than Earth. This is consistent with a rock-based composition and a thick, Venus-like atmosphere of water vapor, similar to TRAPPIST-1b. TRAPPIST-1c's atmosphere is expected to be thinner than that of its inner sibling, but still large enough to raise its surface temperature far above the calculated equilibrium temperature. =Orbit= The orbit of TRAPPIST-1c is very close to its host star. One year on this planet lasts a mere 2.42 days (58 hours), a fraction as long as that of our Solar System's innermost planet, Mercury. The planet orbits at a distance of 0.0158 AU, which is about 1.6% the distance between Earth and the Sun. At this proximity, TRAPPIST-1c is most likely tidally locked. However, due to the small size of its host star, the planet only receives about 2.1 times the sunlight as Earth. Its orbital eccentricity is very low at 0.00654, similar to that of TRAPPIST-1b. =Host star= TRAPPIST-1c orbits the ultracool dwarf star TRAPPIST-1.

Mechanism  For the majority of eukaryotic messenger RNAs (mRNAs), translation initiates from a methionine-encoding AUG start codon following the molecular processes of 'cap-binding' and 'scanning' by ribosomal pre-initiation complexes (PICs). In rare exceptions, such as translation by viral IRES-containing mRNAs, 'cap- binding' and/or 'scanning' are not required for initiation, although AUG is still typically used as the first codon. RAN translation is an exception to the canonical rules as it uses variable start site selection and initiates from a non-AUG codon, but may still depend on 'cap-binding' and 'scanning'.  Disease  RAN translation produces a variety of dipeptide repeat proteins by translation of expanded trinucleotide repeats present in an intron of the C9orf72 gene. The expansion of the trinucleotide repeats and thus accumulation of dipeptide repeat proteins are thought to cause cellular toxicity that leads to neurodegeneration in ALS disease.

The title track of the series have been sung by Nooran Sisters. Based on the practice of Bacha posh, it starred Arti Singh, Sania Touqeer, Wahib Kapadia, Farnaz Shetty and Neel Motwani. Plot  Waaris tells about the story of Amba Pawaniya, a Punjabi mother who is forced to raise her girl child Manpreet as a boy in efforts to keep peace in the village and prevent her violent brother- in-law Jagan Pawaniya from taking leadership. The show deals with its consequences, focuses on different situations and shows the gender discrimination still popular in society, along with every mother's protective nature towards her child. =Seven years later= Amba has brought Manpreet up as a boy namely Mannu to keep her husband Charan's title and doesn't want Jagan to become leader of the village. Manpreet tends to prefer feminine things like her sisters Simran and Gunjan. Once old enough to understand, Manpreet decides to become the son her mother needs and suppresses the girl in her. Simran learns of Manpreet's truth but supports her whenever she wants to indulge in her feminine side. Manpreet befriends Raj, a handicapped boy neglected by his father Harjeet Bajwa. The Pawaniyas and Bajwas are known for their rivalry but work together to try and bring peace to the village. Manpreet meets an older man named Jai and even thinks to match make Amba with him but he dies in an accident. Enter Mohini, Jai's friend from his former life who loves Jai dearly. Simran and Raman fall in love. Manpreet sees this as an opportunity to bring the clashing families together and form a bond of love between the families but Amba and Harjeet refuse to accept. Raman and Simran try to elope but are caught. A confrontation ensues during which Mohini secretly shoots Raman and Harjeet shoots Simran. The Bajwas assume Manpreet is responsible for Raman's death. Raj and Manpreet's friendship breaks and Amrit takes Raj outside the city, leaving Harjeet and Rohan behind. =Ten years later= Manpreet and Gunjan grow up. Gunjan knows the truth of Manpreet who secretly dresses as a girl every once in a while and goes by the name Preet. A grown-up Raj returns to the village and falls in love with Manpreet not knowing her identity. Mohini is shown to be married to Harjeet as Amrit left him and has a son named Nihaal. Eventually, Raj comes to know the truth. He convinces Manpreet to reveal her true identity and they decide to marry. When Amba finds out, she tries to kill Raj but Manpreet dresses up as a bride and takes Raj to a temple to marry her. As soon as the marriage is completed, Raj reveals that it was all a plan to avenge Raman's death. The village council dethrones her and she is sentenced to live her life outside of the Pawaniya clan's jurisdiction. Manpreet enters the Bajwa mansion with Amrit's help. Sakshi and Mohini try to break up Raj and Manpreet's marriage. Revealed to be alive and kidnapped by Amba, Simran has lost her memory and is mentally unstable. A grown-up Rohan finds Simran when she is running away from where Amba has been hiding her. Simran is forced to live with the Bajwas as Raman's widowed wife due to Mohini. Mohini is afraid because Simran knows that she was the one who killed Raman. Raj makes a deal with Manpreet - he will help her cure Simran and she will divorce him as soon as Simran regains her memory. Mohini brings Chandar back into their lives to have Simran remarried. Amba and Manpreet disapprove knowing Chandar is a fraudster. Manpreet decides to marry Chandar to save Simran. Seeing Manpreet close to Chandar, Raj realises that he has really fallen in love with her, but she has lost all trust in him. Raj and Rohan find out that Mohini killed Raman. They fail to prove Manpreet's innocence because of Mohini's plans. On Manpreet and Chandar's wedding, Mohini is arrested while Simran is secretly married off to Rohan and regains her memory. Manpreet is saved from the wedding but gets shot while trying to save Raj from Chandar who is arrested and vows revenge. Simran rejects her marriage with Rohan. Raj proposes to Manpreet and confesses his love but she rejects him. Both Raj and Rohan fight their love for Manpreet and Simran respectively.

He was a close friend of American soldier and statesman Alexander Hamilton. Stevens' date of birth was unclear due to lack of records, with the year 1752 being published by Kristian Caroe, without sources, in his 1905 book \\"Den danske lægestand, 1479-1900\\" until Historian Michael E. Newton published contemporary records establishing Stevens birthplace and date. Early life Stevens was born in Antigua on February 21, 1754. Stevens's father, a Scottish merchant named Thomas Stevens, would later become the adoptive father of the orphaned Alexander Hamilton. Stevens was one of five children. He quickly became good friends with his adopted brother Hamilton, displaying many similar mannerisms. Both were interested in classics, spoke French fluently, opposed slavery, were interested in medicine, and were considered clever. Contemporaries would often remark that Edward Stevens and Hamilton looked very much alike. Secretary of State Timothy Pickering, who knew both men in adulthood, noted that the men were strikingly similar in appearance and concluded that they must be biological brothers. Hamilton biographer Ron Chernow says many aspects of Hamilton's biography make more sense given Stevens's paternity. It would explain why Hamilton was adopted into the Stevens family while his older brother, James, apparently was not. It may have also been a factor in Hamilton's acknowledged father abandoning his family. However, this speculation, mostly based on Pickering's comments on the resemblance between the two men, has always been vague and unsupported.Henry Cabot Lodge, Alexander Hamilton, 1882, appendix Rachel Faucette had been living on St. Kitts and Nevis for years at the time when Alexander was conceived, while Thomas Stevens lived on Antigua and St. Croix and James Hamilton Sr never disavowed his paternity, signing his letters to Alexander even in later years ”your very affectionate Father”.Michael Newton, Alexander Hamilton: The Formative Years, 2015, pp 30-32 Moreover, William Cissel does find possible evidence that Thomas Stevens did initially take both Hamilton boys in, not just Alexander, as in 1769 the registers read that the household had two “white male servants” that hadn't been listed before. By the 1772 register the “white male servants” are gone: Hamilton may have been upgraded and James Jr., who was by then 19 years old, had gone to live elsewhere. Stevens graduated from King's College in 1774 and then sailed to Britain to study Medicine at the University of Edinburgh. He gained his doctorate (M.D.) on September 12, 1777. Stevens' dissertation on gastric digestion was entitled De alimentorum concoctione. Based on this work, he was the first researcher to isolate human gastric juices. His work confirmed that of René Antoine Ferchault de Réaumur, who showed the digestive power of gastric juices, and helped dispel earlier theories of digestion. Stevens's work on digestion would influence Lazzaro Spallanzani. Career On January 20, 1776, Stevens was admitted to the university's Royal Medical Society. He served as the Society's president for the academic year 1779/1780. Stevens conducted experimental inquiry into the color of blood and received a prize for his work. Stevens remained in Edinburgh until 1783 and was one of the joint founders of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in that year. Stevens returned to St. Croix in 1783. He worked there as a physician for ten years. He maintained his friendship with Hamilton through correspondence. In adulthood, Hamilton tended to shun his turbulent adolescence, and Stevens was the only person from his childhood, including even his closest living family members, with whom he kept in regular contact. Following the death of his wife, Eleanora, in 1792, Stevens decided to move to North America. Stevens had considered a move to Guyana, but William Thornton urged him to choose the United States. Also in 1792, Stevens married Hester Kortright Amory. Stevens ended his ten years of practicing medicine in the Caribbean and moved to Philadelphia in 1793. While in Philadelphia, he engaged in a controversy with Benjamin Rush on methods for treating an outbreak of yellow fever. Alexander Hamilton and his wife Eliza contracted the disease, and Stevens treated them with bark, wine, and cold baths, a regimen that stirred some controversy since Stevens spurned the bloodletting treatment advocated by most doctors including Rush. Upon his recovery, Hamilton became an advocate for Stevens's method. Stevens was admitted to the American Philosophical Society on April 18, 1794. Stevens's work in digestion may have influenced other researchers in Philadelphia, notably John Richardson Young. In 1795, Stevens was appointed as a professor at King's College. Stevens served as the United States consul- general in Saint-Domingue (later Haiti) from 1799 to 1800. John Adams sent Stevens to Haiti with instructions to establish a relationship with Toussaint Louverture and express support for his regime. The Federalist administration hoped to incite a movement toward Haitian independence, but Louverture maintained a colonial relationship with France. Stevens's title, \\"consul\\", suggested a diplomat attached to a country not a colony, reflecting the administration's view of the Haitian situation. Following his arrival in Haiti in April 1799, Stevens succeeded in accomplishing several of his objectives, including: the suppression of privateers operating out of the colony, protections for American lives and property, and right of entry for American vessels. Stevens pushed for similar privileges for the British, who, like the United States (see Quasi-War) were engaged in war with France. Negotiations between Haiti and Britain were difficult given Haiti's fears of Britain's desire to take control of the colony, and Britain's fears of the Haitian slave revolt spreading to its own Caribbean colonies. In fact, Stevens had to serve as the British agent for a time since Haitian troops feared having a British official in the colony. The convention, signed on June 13, 1799, continued an armistice among the three parties, gave protections to British and American ships from privateers, and allowed American and British ships to enter the colony and engage in free trade. Stevens's correspondence with Timothy Pickering, John Adams, and Thomas Jefferson provide important insight into US geopolitics during the Haitian Revolution. Later life Little is known of Stevens's last years. For two and a half months in 1809-10, during the British occupation of the Danish West Indies, Stevens served as President of St. Croix. He corresponded with David Hosack, including a letter introducing his son in 1823.

It went on to sell over 15,000 copies, ranked as high as #4 on the college radio charts, and earned them “Best New Artist” and runner up for “Album of the Year” from Homegrown Music Network.

The band's music eventually caught the ear of revered producer Jim Scott (Tedeschi Trucks Band, Wilco, Grace Potter, Tom Petty, Rolling Stones, Red Hot Chili Peppers). The seven-time Grammy-winner invited the band to travel to Los Angeles after hearing the demos the band had been work-shopping. There, The Broadcast recorded their sophomore album From the Horizon in the desert of California. Scott’s enthusiasm about the band and genuine excitement about this collection of songs shines brightly in the finished recording. When asked about From the Horizon, Scott says, “I think this record is very brave in the fact that it doesn’t follow a pattern or trend. It's classically good music based on the music that we’ve all listened to since the ‘50s till today. It’s got soul, and vibrancy, and life.” From the Horizon is an apt title, expressing a sense of change and lightning-in-a- bottle potential that The Broadcast taps into on this latest offering. A slight departure from their debut album, Dodge The Arrow, the 11-song record finds the band delving deeper into the realms of Americana. In 2018, The Broadcast recorded their 3rd studio album produced by Tim Lefebvre (David Bowie, Tedeschi Trucks Band) and Tyler \\"Falcon\\" Greenwell (Tedeschi Trucks Band, Col.

The first meeting was held at Mann's Hotel at Hallett on 24 September. It was expanded by the District Councils Act 1887 to include the Hundred of Tomkinson and portions of the Hundred of Hallett excluded in the initial proclamation.

Many Chinese nationals were forced to leave the country due to increased government surveillance and coercion. After the start of World War II and the subsequent collapse of Sino-German Cooperation, the Gestapo launched mass arrests of Chinese Germans and Chinese nationals across Germany and sent many to labor camps.  History  Until the end of the Cold War, few Chinese lived in Germany, as compared to immigrants from other nations, and their influence on German society was limited. Nevertheless, in Hamburg, Bremen, and Berlin, Chinese communities formed. Most of the Chinese who immigrated to Germany in the 19th and 20th centuries were sailors from Guangdong and Zhejiang. These sailors generally went on leave upon docking in German ports; in time, Chinese communities developed there. The Chinatown in the St. Pauli quarter of Hamburg (around Schmuckstrasse), Chinesenviertel, eventually became the largest Chinese community in Germany. By the time the Chinese consulate was established in Hamburg in 1921, more than 2,000 Chinese persons resided in Germany; professional sailors aside, the vast majority were in the catering and entertainment industries, as proprietors of Chinese restaurants, bars, cafes and dance halls. Illegal establishments included opium dens and casinos and weapon smuggling. Starting in the 1920s, university graduates of Chinese origin emerged in Berlin, and most of them adhered to a radical left-wing ideology. Zhu De, Liao Chengzhi and Zhou Enlai and others later became prominent leaders of the Chinese Communist Party. Others joined the Communist Party of Germany, and founded a saloon called \\"Circle for the Chinese language\\". = Initial persecutions = A memorial plaque on Schmuckstraße in Hamburg provides a brief history of the Chinese quarters in St. Pauli and its destruction by the Gestapo in 1944. Initially the everyday life of Chinese people in Germany was unaffected by the Nazi government. Adolf Hitler praised Chinese culture and didn't consider the Chinese Untermensch. Nevertheless, the status of Honorary Aryan was not granted to the Chinese, in contrast to Japanese people. Later, Chinese people in Germany, some of whom adhered to a right-wing ideology, were targeted for persecution by the Nazi government. Although most of them were not politically active, the government conducted surveillance on them. Under these circumstances, life became increasingly difficult for Chinese civilians in Germany. Beginning in 1936, Gestapo, local police and custom officers enforced unethical regulations in Hamburg's Chinatown. On January 25, 1938, the Reich Main Security Office founded the Center for Chinese () under the control of Reinhard Heydrich, which was dedicated to controlling the size of the Chinese population. Most members of Germany's Chinese population chose to return to China, but some of them chose to fight in the Spanish Civil War. According to a report composed by the Overseas Community Affairs Council, the Chinese population in Germany was reduced to 1138 before the outbreak of the Second World War. 1934 Chinese passport issued in 1934 to a couple living in Berlin During the war After the Chinese government declared war on Nazi Germany following the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, the Gestapo launched mass arrests of Chinese Germans and Chinese nationals across Germany, concentrating them in the Arbeitserziehungslager Langer Morgen (\\"Langer Morgen Labor Camp\\") in Wilhelmsburg, Hamburg, and used them as slave laborers; many were tortured or worked to death by the Gestapo. Post-war By the end of World War II, every Chinese restaurant in Hamburg had closed; the pre-war Chinese communities in Berlin, Hamburg, and Bremen were all destroyed, and virtually no Chinese presence remained in Germany.

Overview  In 1986, MC Shan released a song called “The Bridge”, in which he stated how Queensbridge was a monument for Hip Hop over any other place. KRS-One did not agree with that and released the song “South Bronx” in response. These two songs started what is now known as The Bridge Wars.

In 2016, with the release of MC Shan’s 3 minute freestyle, the beef from 30 years prior was reignited. In the interview, in which he released his 3-minute freestyle, MC Shan stated “I’m not going to do it on the strength of oh I got something to prove, yall gonna pay me! “. With this being said some might think MC Shan might be bringing this back up as a power play, looking to gain money or fame once again.

On the other hand, chronic conditions are not late-appearing, they are long-lasting. In the medical field, tardive is most commonly associated with tardive neurological disorders, such as tardive dyskinesia, tardive dystonia, tardive psychosis and tardive akathisia.

It was composed in the Late Renaissance period sometime during the late 16th century. It is centered on the 20 verses of text that constitute the hymn of the same name. History The text predates Palestrina's composition and dates as far back as the 13th century. The author of the text is unknown. Some possible authors include: St. Bonaventure, Pope Innocent III, and Jacopone da Todi, a Franciscan friar. The liturgical text is centered on Mary's suffering at the Crucifixion of Christ. It has both a regular meter – frequently trochaic – and an intricate rhyme scheme, both of which are qualities that most academics date back to the 12th century. Palestrina's Stabat Mater appears to have been written for Pope Gregory XIV, who was Pope from 1590 until his death in 1591. Therefore, the work may have been composed during this time– a period which was within the final years of Palestrina's life. Since then, the work was initially guarded closely by the choir for which it was written. The first part was performed annually on Palm Sunday at a slower tempo. In Rome in 1770, the English historian Dr. Burney was able to obtain a copy of the work. This acquisition produced the first printed edition in 1771 in London, in \\"La Musica Che Si canta annualmente nelle Funzioni della Settimana Santa nella Capella Pontificia\\". Since then, the composition has had many editions, including one by the German composer Richard Wagner in 1877. Structure Stabat Mater is a motet for unaccompanied double chorus, and consists of 20 sections in accordance with the 20 verses of text. It is scored for double chorus, with both choruses set for SATB chorus. It contains rare examples of anticipation, which are relatively early for its time. It also contains many suspensions. The texture is thick and is more homophonic than contrapuntal. The two choruses alternate during the work, usually per line of verse. Within the work, there are moments of full chorus, where both choruses sing together, and moments with soloists within the two choirs. The piece contains changes in tempo: It begins as Adagio ma non troppo and slows to Largo at the beginning of the 9th verse. At the start of verse 11, it returns to the first tempo, but this time un poco animato. The tempo winds down to Piu Lento at the beginning of verse 20, before slowing down to Largo for the final 9 bars. The work either begins on the dominant of D Dorian or on the tonic A Mixolydian, with an unexpected progression of four major chords, which is an unusual chord progression for this time period. This composition arguably concludes in D Major with a cadence that spans three bars. Text Stabat Mater dolorósa Juxta crucem lacrimósa, Dum pendébat Filius. Cujus ánimam geméntem, Contristátam, et doléntem, Pertransivit gladius. O quam tristis et afflicta Fuit illa benedicta Mater Unigéniti! Quae mœrébat, et dolébat Et tremebat, cum vidébat Nati pœnas inclyti. Quis est homo qui non fleret, Christi Matrem si viderét In tanto supplicio? Quis non posset contristári Piam Matrem contemplári Doléntem cum Filio? Pro peccátis suæ gentis Vidit Jesum in torméntis, Et flagéllis súbditum. Vidit suum dulcem natum Moriéntem desolátum, Dum emisit spiritum. Eia, Mater, fons amóris, Me sentire vim dolóris Fac, ut tecum lúgeam. Fac ut árdeat cor meum In amándo Christum Deum, Ut sibi compláceam. Sancta Mater, istud agas, Crucifixi fige plagas Cordi meo válide. Tui nati vulneráti, Tam dignáti pro me pati, Pœnas mecum divide. Fac me tecum pie flere, Crucifixo condolere Donec ego vixero, Juxta crucem tecum stare Et me tibi sociáre In planctu desidero. Virgo virginum præclára, Mihi jam non sis amára, Fac me tecum plángere. Fac ut portem Christi mortem, Passiónis fac consórtem, Et plagas recólere. Fac me plagis vulnerári, Cruce hac inebriári, Et cruóre Filii. Inflammatus et accénsus, Per te Virgo sim defénsus In die judicii. Fac me cruce custodiri, Morte Christi praemuniri Confoveri gratia: Quando corpus moriétur Fac ut ánimæ donétur Paradisi Glória. Translation At the cross her station keeping, Mary stood in sorrow weeping When her Son was crucified. While she waited in her anguish, Seeing Christ in torment languish, Bitter sorrow pierced her heart. With what pain and desolation, With what noble resignation, Mary watched her dying Son. Ever-patient in her yearning Through her tear-filled eyes were burning Mary gazed upon her Son. Who, that sorrow contemplating, On that passion meditating, Would not share the Virgin's grief? Christ she saw, for our salvation, Scourged with cruel acclamation, Bruised and beaten by the rod. Christ she saw with life-blood failing, All her anguish unavailing, Saw him breathe his very last. Mary, fount of love's devotion, Let me share with true emotion All the sorrow you endured. Virgin, ever interceding, Hear me in my fervent pleading: Fire me with your love of Christ. Mother, may this prayer be granted: That Christ's love may be implanted In the depths of my poor soul At the cross, your sorrow sharing, All your grief and torment bearing, Let me stand and mourn with you. Fairest maid of all creation, Queen of hope and consolation, Let me feel your grief sublime. Virgin, in your love befriend me, At the Judgement Day defend me. Help me by your constant prayer. Saviour, when my life shall leave me, Through your mother's prayers receive me With the fruits of victory. Virgin of all virgins blest! Listen to my fond request: Let me share your grief divine Let me, to my latest breath, In my body bear the death Of your dying Son divine. Wounded with His every wound, Steep my til' it has swooned In His very Blood away Be to me, O virgin, nigh Lest in flames I burn and die, In His awe-full judgement day.

It is an integrative perspective drawing from aspects of ecological psychology, cognitive science, evolutionary ecology and anthropology. Notions of domain-specific modules in the brain and the cognitive biases they create are central to understanding the enacted nature of cognition within a cognitive ecological framework. This means that cognitive mechanisms not only shape the characteristics of thought, but they dictate the success of culturally transmitted ideas. Because culturally transmitted concepts can often inform ecological decision-making behaviors, group-level trends in cognition (i.e., culturally salient concepts) are hypothesized to address ecologically relevant challenges.  Theoretical basis  Cognitive ecology explores the interactive relationship between organism- environment interactions and its impact on cognitive phenomena. Human cognition in this framework is multimodal and viewed similarly to enactivist perspectives on cognitive processing. For cultural concepts, this emphasizes cognitive distribution across an ecosystem, which is predicated on models of the extended mind thesis. = Ecological psychology = While the multi- faceted nature of cognitive ecology is a consequence of its interdisciplinary history, it primarily derives from early work in ecological psychology. Paradigm shifts from behaviorist orientations of psychology to cognition, or the \\"cognitive revolution\\", gave rise to the ecological psychology approach, which distanced itself from mainstream cognitivist views by breaking down the common mind-environment dichotomy of psychological theory. One particularly influential progenitor of this work was ecological psychologist James Gibson, whose legacy is marked by his ideas on ecological and social affordances. These are the opportunistic features of environmental objects that can be exploited for human use, and are therefore particularly perceptible (e.g., a knob affords twisting, an agreeable social cue affords a warm reaction). Gibson argued further that organisms cannot be disentangled from their environments, and that their cognitive constraints were consequences of a limited set of environmental invariants which shaped them over evolutionary time. An illustrative example for Gibson is the human capacity for three- dimensional visual perception, which he argues is a cognitive concept resulting from the way that people interact with their environment. Another foreshadowed element of cognitive ecological theory comes from ecological anthropologist Gregory Bateson, who considered the notion of informational feedback loops between mind and environment, particularly their role in generating meaning and awareness of one's surroundings. In an essay, he speculates on how an observer might best delineate the \\"self\\" of a blind man. In his treatment, he questions whether one may arbitrarily choose to carve out the man's informational processing loop at his brain or his hands or his walking stick without offering an incomplete view of his cognitive process. This discussion of concept remains influential in modern cognitive ecological considerations of the densely interconnected elements of ecology that play relevant roles in cognition. = Enactivism = An enactive perspective of cognition is fundamental to a cognitive ecological view. Rather than a passive interpretation of internally represented information, cognition is considered to be an active process involving the transformation of information into meaningful relationships between the organism and its environment. For humans then, a perceived environment is only constructed insofar as cognitive constraints will allow. In other words, they \\"enact a world\\" by building perspectives out of ecological information, using their evolved cognitive equipment.  Extended cognition  Cognitive ecology borrows ideas from views of extended cognition, as articulated by Chalmers and Clark (1998). They argue that humans cognitively utilize elements of their environment to aid the cognitive process and further entangle the mind-environment relationship as a result. They illustrate their claim with a hypothetical example of two people who achieve the same navigational success through a museum by different means; a person with Alzheimer's may use a notebook with written directions, while another may use her memory. The primary difference between the two people is that the former outsourced his memory to readily available external representations of information about the museum, whereas the latter relied on internal representations. A variant of this concept they also consider is socially extended cognition, which is a similar outsourcing of cognitive representations into other peoples' minds. These ideas elaborate a cognitive interpretation of broader anthropological notions maintaining that humans are a species deeply entangled in social and material elements of culture. = Distributed cognition = Distributed cognition is an important model of the extended mind thesis for cognitive ecological theory put forth by Edwin Hutchins. This conceptualizes human groups as active networks with cognitive properties of their own, much like neural networks themselves yield emergent cognitive properties. For a social group, cognitive properties are disseminated into an individual's surrounding network. The cognitive properties of a group, Hutchins notes, is completely distinct from those of an individual. Distributed cognition is fundamentally contingent on and emergent from trending ideas among a collection of brains and artefacts. This is conceptually similar to models of collective cognition in other social animal groups, which use agent based models to understanding insect swarming, fish schooling, bird flocking and baboon pack behaviors. Collective cognition in social animal groups is adaptive because the group can amplify its overall responsiveness to ecological cues. Likewise, the computational power of a human group can be more effective than that of even its best individuals. This idea is echoed by anthropologists noting the collective intentionality of cultural institutions. Existing models of cultural learning dynamics seem to articulate the mechanisms by which information is acquired by and distributed within groups. In particular, cultural evolution theorists assert that individual learning is required for tracking environmental dynamics, but this information is retained in culture by social learning. For Hutchins, this theoretical similarity is not a coincidence. After describing distributed cognitive networks and their relationships with ecological dynamics as \\"cognitive ecosystems\\", he defines culture as a \\"shorthand way of referring to a complex cognitive ecosystem.\\"  Applications to cultural concepts  = Religious beliefs = Religious behaviors typically exist in the form of ritual and correspond to religious god concepts. These behaviors are phenotypic outcomes of god concepts that are ultimately subject to natural selection. Cognitive ecologists who study religion predict that god concepts across cultures can be linked to coordination solutions for local socioecological challenges, such as large-scale cooperation, intragroup cohesion and commitment, and resource management. For example, an omniscient and morally punitive \\"Big God\\" may be adaptive for large-scale populations by motivating prosocial behavior, whereas gods associated with small-scale societies are often concerned about the stability of local resources. = Economic exchange = Social contracts and their associated fairness norms are thought by many economists to be contingent on means of production. A hunter- gatherer society, for instance, may operate at an equilibrium where each person contributes to the best of his or her ability and receives according to need. But if this society were to shift toward larger-scale agricultural practices, this equilibrium would be destabilized by increases in free riding and general temptations to profit by defecting. This has been supported empirically in cross-cultural studies using experimental economic game data, which showed a wide range of variance in fairness expectations between populations based on culturally-specific exchange concepts. This shift in fairness expectations has also been implicated in archaeological data. In particular, the relaxed sharing norms hypothesized to be built upon periods of successful maize exploitation in the pre-Hispanic Pueblo Southwest seemed to be eroded by decreases in agricultural success. In other words, when crops began to fail and supply became low, cultural exchange norms became more stringent, kin-based and based on reciprocity.

Deep Space is a science fiction video game created by developer Daniel Wilson and published by Iron Cloud Entertainment on January 7, 2015. In the game, the player must use simple voice commands to instruct a man who is stuck on a spaceship full of monsters. As of May 2016, the game is available on the Apple App Store, and an Android version is in development. The game follows the story of an unnamed man, who is stranded on a space ship after the rest of the ship's crew members were mysteriously killed while the man was asleep. The player's role is to guide the man, and keep him alive using commands to tell him what to do. Mayday! Deep Space generally received mixed opinions from reviewers. Critics praised the voice commands and the unique way the game allowed the player to control the main character. The main criticism for the game was the lack of length, with only a total of forty minutes of gameplay.  Plot  The story begins as the player receives a call from a ship, which is named the USS Appaloosa. The player discovers that a mysterious incident led to the massacre of all of the crew members onboard, bar one. After this, the game follows the sole survivor on the spacecraft, who was on a mission. The goal of the game is to keep the man alive, by avoiding enemies and navigating him through passages and corridors on the ship.  Gameplay  In the game, the main character is portrayed as a blue dot, whilst his enemies are shown as red. In the game, the man is controlled by simple voice commands from the player, such as \\"go left\\", \\"run faster\\" and \\"stop\\". However, touch controls are also available and can be used instead. There are a total of five playable levels in the game. Mayday! Deep Space also includes a map on the device the game is being played on, which shows the current surroundings of the player. On the map, the player is displayed as a blue dot, whilst his enemies are displayed as red dots. The game also contains environmental obstacles which must be avoided. Since the player is leading the man in the game, rather than controlling him, the game only gives partial control over the character. The man generally listens to the player, however, if the player too obviously tries to kill the man, he will not listen to commands.  Reception  The game received mostly average to positive reviews from critics. Many reviews found the use of voice commands to be unique and one of the highlights of the game as a whole. The Verge called the gameplay \\"simple and intuitive\\". David Shimomura from Kill Screen praised the game for its pace and mood, and how the games makes the player want to protect the main character, and keep him safe. However, with only around forty minutes of gameplay, the game was criticized by some reviews for its lack of length.

Authored by Shri. Govind Raghunath Dabholkar alias Hemadpant, the original edition of the Sai Satcharitra was published in Marathi on 26 November, 1930. A subsequent english edition was soon published in 1944, by Shri. Nagash Devastate (N.V.) Gunaji, translated from the original Marathi composition. The work has since been translated to English, Hindi, Gujarati, Kannada, Tamil, Telugu, Sindhi, Bengali, Odiya, Nepali, Punjabi and Konkani languages. Another English version was also published in New York.  History  In 1910, when Hemadpant (also known as Late. Govindrao (Annasaheb) Raghunath Dabholkar)http://www.saibabaofshirdi.net/satcharita came to Shirdi, he observed a miracle by Sai Baba in which baba had prevented the raging cholera epidemic from entering Shirdi by grinding wheat on a grindstone and dispersing them around the borders of the Shirdi village. Witnessing this event is believed to have inspired Hemadpant to document the leela's of Sai Baba of Shirdi. Hemadpant soon sought the help of \\"Madhavrao Deshpande\\" alias Shama who advocated his cause before Sri Sai Baba himself. In 1916, Sai Baba gave his consent, stating, \\"You have my full consent to write my life history. Take notes and keep them. If my leelas are recorded, sins committed through ignorance will be dissolved. When my leelas are heard and/or read with love and devotion, the cares and troubles of worldly life will be forgotten.\\" This event, mentioned in the second chapter of Sri Sai Satcharita, marked the beginning of the Sai Satcharita. Hemadpant wrote the Sai Satcharita at his residence called Sai Niwas in Bandra, Mumbai. Sai Niwas is more than 100 years old today and still carry forwards the tradition of Sai Bhakti (Sai Devotion) for numerous Sai devotees across the world. Shri Sai Satcharitra also mentions about Sai Niwas (Chapter 40 : Attending Mrs.Deo's Udyapan Ceremony as a Sannyasi with two Others (Trio) and Hemadpant's House in the Form of His Picture) where this divine holy book was written. http://saiamrithadhara.com/mumbai.html https://aniruddhafoundation.com/sai- niwas/ http://www.saibabaofshirdi.net/satcharita/sai40.html http://www.shirdibooks.com/sai-satcharitra-chapter-40/ The Sai Satcharita consists of 9450 verses spread over 52 Chapters. Hemadpant is believed to have begun writing the Sri Sai Satcharita in 1922. He died after finishing the 51st Chapter in 1929. The desk on which Hemadpant wrote the manuscript of the Sai Satcharita is well preserved and is placed in the same room in Sai Niwas on which he sat and wrote the Sai Satcharita. Besides the desk, other memorable, such as Hemadpant’s turban, etc. have also been well preserved.

They were accused of spying by carrying coded documents to Saif al-Islam Gaddafi, their client. Taylor was accused of smuggling a miniature video camera pen and watch. Taylor was arrested and although her colleagues were released, they chose to remain with her. They were detained in the Libyan town of Zintan on 7 June. It was the first time an International Criminal Court official had been seized. The president of the court, Sang-Hyun Song, demanded Taylor's immediate release, claiming she had immunity as she was on an official mission. Many diplomatic officials, including Australian Foreign Minister Bob Carr, who flew to Tripoli, lobbied for their release. In order to secure her release, the court apologised to the Libyan rebels for the incident and promised to investigate Taylor and her colleagues. They were released on 3 July and flown to Rome on a plane provided by the Italian government.

The United States prevented other powers from recognizing the Confederacy, which counted heavily on Britain and France to enter the war on its side to maintain their supply of cotton and to weaken a growing opponent. Every nation was officially neutral throughout the war, and none formally recognized the Confederacy. The major nations all recognized that the Confederacy had certain rights as an organized belligerent. A few nations did take advantage of the war.

France therefore encouraged Britain to join in a policy of mediation, suggesting that both recognize the Confederacy.Lynn M. Case, and Warren E. Spencer, The United States and France: Civil War Diplomacy (1970) Lincoln repeatedly warned that any recognition of the Confederacy was tantamount to a declaration of war. The British textile industry depended on cotton from the South, but it had stocks to keep the mills operating for a year and in any case, the industrialists and workers carried little weight in British politics. Knowing a war would cut off vital shipments of American food, wreak havoc on the British merchant fleet, and cause an invasion of Canada, Britain and its powerful Royal Navy refused to join France.Kinley J. Brauer, \\"British Mediation and the American Civil War: A Reconsideration,\\" Journal of Southern History, (1972) 38#1 pp. 49–64 in JSTOR Historians emphasize that Union diplomacy proved generally effective, with expert diplomats handling numerous crises. British leaders had some sympathy for the Confederacy, but were never willing to risk war with the Union. France was even more sympathetic to the Confederacy, but it was threatened by Prussia and would not make a move without full British cooperation. Confederate diplomats were inept, or as one historian put it, \\"Poorly chosen diplomats produce poor diplomacy.\\" Other countries played a minor role. Russia made a show of support of the Union, but its importance has often been exaggerated. United States Lincoln's foreign policy was deficient in 1861, and he failed to garner public support in Europe. Diplomats had to explain that the United States was not committed to ending slavery, instead appealing to the unconstitutionality of secession. Confederate spokesmen, on the other hand, were much more successful: ignoring slavery and instead focusing on their struggle for liberty, their commitment to free trade, and the essential role of cotton in the European economy. Most European leaders were unimpressed with the Union's legal and constitutional arguments and thought it hypocritical that the U.S. should seek to deny to one of its regions the same sort of independence it won from Great Britain some eight decades earlier. Furthermore, since the Union was not committed to ending slavery, it struggled to persuade Europeans (especially Britons) that there was no moral equivalency between the rebels who established the United States in 1776 and the rebels who established the Confederate States in 1861. Even more importantly, the European aristocracy (the dominant factor in every major country) was \\"absolutely gleeful in pronouncing the American debacle as proof that the entire experiment in popular government had failed. European government leaders welcomed the fragmentation of the ascendant American Republic.\\"Don H. Doyle, The Cause of All Nations: And international history of the American Civil War (2014) pp 8 (quote), 69–70 For decades historians have debated who played the most important roles in shaping Union diplomacy. During the early 20th century, Secretary of State William Seward was seen as an Anglophobe who dominated a weak president. Lincoln's reputation was restored by Jay Monaghan who, in 1945, emphasized Lincoln's quiet effectiveness behind the scenes.Jay Monaghan, Diplomat in carpet slippers: Abraham Lincoln deals with foreign affairs (1945). A new study by Norman Ferris in 1976 was a realistic study of Seward's actual programming, emphasizing his leadership role.Norman B. Ferris, Desperate diplomacy: William H.

The Confederates had for years uncritically assumed that \\"cotton is king\\"—that is, Britain had to support the Confederacy to obtain cotton. However, this assumption was disproven during the American Civil War. Peter Parish has argued that southern intellectual and cultural insularity proved fatal: Once the war began, the Confederacy pinned its hopes on military intervention by Great Britain and France. However, British was not as dependent on Southern cotton as Confederate leaders believed; it had enough stock to last for over a year and developed alternative sources of cotton, most notably in India and Egypt. Great Britain was unwilling to risk war with the U.S. to acquire more cotton at the risk of losing the large quantities of food imported from the North.Blumenthal (1966) Meanwhile, the Confederate national government had lost control of its own foreign policy when cotton planters, factors, and financiers spontaneously decided to embargo shipments of cotton to Europe in early 1861. It was an enormously expensive mistake, depriving the Confederacy of millions of dollars in cash it would desperately need.Jay Sexton, \\"Civil War Diplomacy\\". In Aaron Sheehan-Dean, ed., A Companion to the US Civil War (2014): 745–746. The Confederate government sent delegations to Europe but they were ineffective in achieving their diplomatic aims. James Murray Mason went to London and John Slidell traveled to Paris. They were unofficially interviewed, but neither secured official recognition for the Confederacy. However, Confederate purchasing agents in Europe, often working with blockade runners funded by British financiers, were more successful. For example, James Bulloch was the mastermind behind the procurement of warships for the Confederate Navy.Sexton, \\"Civil War Diplomacy\\". 746. Confederate propagandists, especially Henry Hotze and James Williams, were partly effective in mobilizing European public opinion. Hotze acted as a Confederate agent in Great Britain. His success was based on using liberal arguments of self-determination in favor of national independence, echoing the failed European revolutions of 1848. He also promised that the Confederacy would be a low-tariff nation in contrast to the high-tariff United States.Marc-William Palen, \\"The Civil War's Forgotten Transatlantic Tariff Debate and the Confederacy's Free Trade Diplomacy\\". Journal of the Civil War Era 3#1 (2013): 35–61. He consistently emphasized that the tragic consequences of cotton shortages for the industrial workers in Britain were caused by the Union blockade of Southern ports.Andre Fleche, Revolution of 1861: The American Civil War in the Age of Nationalist Conflict (2012) p. 84.Stephen B. Oates, \\"Henry Hotze: Confederate Agent Abroad\\". Historian 27.2 (1965): 131–154. In March 1862 James Murray Mason made it to England and collaborated with several British politicians to push the government to ignore the Union blockade. Mason and his friends argued that it was only a \\"paper blockade\\", not actually enforceable, which by international law would make it illegal. In that case, the British were free to openly support the Confederacy. However, most British politicians opposed this interpretation because it was counter to traditional British views on blockades, which Britain saw as one of its most effective naval weapons.Charles M. Hubbard, \\"James Mason, the 'Confederate lobby' and the blockade debate of March 1862\\". Civil War History 45.3 (1999): 223–237. Confederate agent Father John B. Bannon was a Catholic priest who traveled to Rome in 1863 in a failed attempt to convince Pope Pius IX to grant diplomatic recognition to the Confederacy.David J. Alvarez, \\"The Papacy in the Diplomacy of the American Civil War\\". Catholic Historical Review 69.2 (1983): 227–248. Bannon then moved on to Ireland, where he attempted to mobilize support for the Confederate cause and to neutralize the attempts of Union recruiters to enlist Irish men in the Union armies. Nevertheless, thousands of Irishmen did volunteer for the Union.Philip Tucker, \\"Confederate Secret Agent in Ireland: Father John B. Bannon and His Irish Mission, 1863–1864\\". Journal of Confederate History 5 (1990): 55–85. United Kingdom Lord Palmerston, pictured in 1863, was British prime minister throughout the war. The British cabinet made the major decisions for war and peace and played a cautious hand, realizing the risk it would have on trade. Elite opinion in Britain tended to favor the Confederacy, while public opinion tended to favor the United States. Throughout the war, large scale trade with the United States continued in both directions. The Americans shipped grain to Britain while Britain sent manufactured items and munitions. Immigration continued into the United States as well. British trade with the Confederacy fell off 95%, with only a trickle of cotton going to Britain and some munitions slipping in by small blockade runners, most of them owned and operated by British interests. Prime Minister Lord Palmerston was sympathetic to the Confederacy.Kevin Peraino, \\"Lincoln vs. Palmerston\\" in his Lincoln in the World: The Making of a Statesman and the Dawn of American Power (2013) pp 120–169. Although a professed opponent of the slave trade and slavery, he held a lifelong hostility towards the United States and believed a dissolution of the Union would weaken the United States – and therefore enhance British power – and that the Southern Confederacy \\"would afford a valuable and extensive market for British manufactures\\".Jasper Ridley, Lord Palmerston (1970) p. 552. Britain issued a proclamation of neutrality on 13 May 1861. The Confederacy was recognized as a belligerent, but it was too premature to recognize the South as a sovereign state since Washington threatened to treat recognition as a hostile action. Britain depended more on American food imports than Confederate cotton, and a war with the U.S. would not be in Britain's economic interest. Palmerston ordered reinforcements sent to the Province of Canada because he was convinced the Union would make peace with the South and then invade Canada. He was very pleased with the Confederate victory at Bull Run in July 1861, but 15 months later he wrote that: = Trent affair: 1861 = Punch magazine in London ridicules American aggressiveness in the Trent Affair, 7 December 1861. A serious diplomatic dispute with the United States erupted over the \\"Trent Affair\\" in late 1861. The United States Navy seized two Confederate diplomats from a British ship and refused to release them. Public opinion in the United States celebrated the humiliation of the British, but London demanded redress. Lincoln gave in and returned the diplomats: James Murray Mason and John Slidell.Walter Stahr, Seward: Lincoln's Indispensable Man (2012) ch. 11 The Trent Affair in November 1861 produced public outrage in Britain and a diplomatic crisis. Palmerston called the action \\"a declared and gross insult\\", demanded the release of the two diplomats, and ordered 3,000 troops to Canada. In a letter to Queen Victoria on 5 December 1861, he said that if his demands were not met, \\"Great Britain is in a better state than at any former time to inflict a severe blow upon and to read a lesson to the United States which will not soon be forgotten.\\"Ridley, Lord Palmerston (1970) p. 554. In another letter to his Foreign Secretary, he predicted war between Britain and the Union: In fact Irishmen did not control any major newspapers in the North, and the U.S. decided to release the prisoners rather than risk war. Palmerston was convinced the presence of troops in Canada persuaded the U.S. to acquiesce.Kenneth Bourne, \\"British Preparations for War with the North, 1861–1862\\". The English Historical Review 76# 301 (1961) pp 600–632 =Cotton and the British economy= The British Industrial Revolution was based on textiles, which in turn were based mostly on cotton imported from the American South. The war cut off supplies. By 1862, stocks had run out, and imports from Egypt and India could not make up the deficit. There was enormous hardship for the factory owners and especially the unemployed factory workers. The issues facing the British textile industry factored into the debate over intervening on behalf of the Confederacy in order to break the union blockade and regain access to Southern cotton.Sven Beckert, \\"Emancipation and empire: Reconstructing the worldwide web of cotton production in the age of the American Civil War\\". American Historical Review 109#5 (2004): 1405–1438.Beckert, Empire of cotton: A new history of global capitalism (2014) pp. 241–273. Historians continue to be sharply divided on the question of British public opinion. One school argues that the aristocracy favored the Confederacy, while the anti-slavery Union was championed by British liberals and spokesmen for the radical working class. An opposing school argues that many British working men—perhaps a majority—were more sympathetic to the Confederate cause.Mary Ellison, Support for secession: Lancashire and the American Civil War (1972). Finally, a third school emphasizes the complexity of the issue and notes that most Britons did not express an opinion on the matter. Local studies have demonstrated that some towns and neighborhoods took one position, while nearby areas took the opposite.Duncan Andrew Campbell, English Public Opinion and the American Civil War (2003). The most detailed study by Richard J. M. Blackett, noting that there was enormous variation across Britain, argues that the working class and religious nonconformists were inclined to support the Union, while support for the Confederacy came mostly from conservatives who were opposed to reform movements inside Britain and from high Church Anglicans.Richard J. M. Blackett, Divided Hearts: Britain and the American Civil War (2001). =Humanitarian intervention, 1862= The question of British and French intervention was on the agenda in 1862. Palmerston was especially concerned with the economic crisis in the Lancashire textile mills, as the supply of cotton had largely run out and unemployment was soaring. He seriously considered breaking the union blockade of Southern ports to obtain the cotton. But by this time the American Navy was large enough to threaten the British merchant fleet, and of course Canada could be captured easily. A new dimension came when Lincoln announced the Emancipation Proclamation in September 1862. Many British leaders expected an all-out race war in the south, with so many tens or hundreds of thousands of deaths that humanitarian intervention was called for to stop the threatened bloodshed. (In the event, there was no race war.) Chancellor of the Exchequer William Gladstone opened a cabinet debate over whether Britain should intervene. Gladstone had a favorable image of the Confederacy and, indeed, of slavery (his family wealth depended on slavery in the West Indies). He emphasized the humanitarian intervention to stop the staggering death toll, risk of the race war, and failure of the Union to achieve decisive military results. In rebuttal, Secretary of War Sir George Cornewall Lewis opposed intervention as a high risk proposition that could result in massive losses. Furthermore, Palmerston had other concerns at the same time, including a crisis over King Otto of Greece in which Russia threatened to take advantage of the weaknesses of the Ottoman Empire. The Cabinet decided that the American situation was less urgent than the need to contain Russian expansion, so it rejected intervention. Palmerston rejected Napoleon III of France's proposal for the two powers to arbitrate the war and ignored all further efforts of the Confederacy to gain British recognition.Niels Eichhorn, \\"The Intervention Crisis of 1862: A British Diplomatic Dilemma?\\" American Nineteenth Century History 15#3 (2014) pp. 287–310.Frank J. Merli and Theodore A. Wilson. \\"The British Cabinet and the Confederacy: Autumn, 1862\\". Maryland Historical Magazine (1970) 65#3 pp. 239–262.Ridley, Lord Palmerston (1970) p. 559. = Blockade runners = British financiers built and operated most of the blockade runners, spending hundreds of millions of pounds on them, but that was legal and not the cause of serious tension. They were staffed by sailors and officers on leave from the Royal Navy. When the U.S. Navy captured one of the fast blockade runners, it sold the ship and cargo as prize of war for the American sailors, then released the crew. =Alabama= A long-term issue was the British shipyard (John Laird and Sons) building two warships for the Confederacy, especially the CSS Alabama, over vehement protests from the United States. The controversy was resolved after the war in the form of the Alabama Claims, in which Britain gave the United States $15.5 million in arbitration by an international tribunal for damages caused by British-built warships.Frank J. Merli, The Alabama, British Neutrality, and the American Civil War (2004). =Canada= The Union successfully recruited soldiers in Canada, and local officials tolerated the presence of Confederate agents despite Union protests. These agents planned attacks on U.S. cities and encouraged antiwar sentiment. They actually did stage a small raid in late 1864 on a Vermont town, where they robbed three banks of $208,000 and killed an American. The raiders escaped back into Canada where the Canadian government arrested them, and then released them.Adam Mayers, Dixie and the Dominion: Canada, the Confederacy, and the War for the Union (2003) online review =Slave trade= The British had long pressured the United States to join vigorously in fighting the illegal Atlantic slave trade. Pressure from southern states had neutralized this, but the Lincoln administration was now eager to sign up. In the Lyons–Seward Treaty of 1862, the United States gave Great Britain full authority to crack down on the trans-Atlantic slave trade when carried on by American ships.Conway W. Henderson, \\"The Anglo-American Treaty of 1862 in Civil War Diplomacy\\". Civil War History 15.4 (1969): 308–319. France Pierre-Paul Pecquet du Bellet, unofficial diplomatic agent of the Confederate States of America in France The Second French Empire under Napoleon III remained officially neutral throughout the War and never recognized the Confederate States of America. It did recognize Confederate belligerency. Kevin Peraino, \\"Lincoln vs. Napoleon\\" in Peraino, Lincoln in the World: The Making of a Statesman and the Dawn of American Power (2013) pp 224–295. The textile industry needed cotton, and Napoleon III had imperial ambitions in Mexico which could be greatly aided by the Confederacy. The United States had warned that recognition meant war. France was reluctant to act alone without British collaboration, and the British rejected intervention. Emperor Napoleon III realized that a war with the U.S. without allies \\"would spell disaster\\" for France. Napoleon III and his Minister of Foreign Affairs Edouard Thouvenel adopted a cautious attitude and maintained diplomatically correct relations with Washington. Half the French press favored the Union, while the \\"imperial\\" press was more sympathetic to the Confederacy. Public opinion generally ignored the war, showing much interest in Mexico.Lynn M. Case, and Warren E. Spencer, The United States and France: Civil War Diplomacy (1970) = Mexico= In 1861, Mexican conservatives looked to French leader Napoleon III to abolish the Republic led by liberal President Benito Juárez. France favored the Confederacy but did not accord it diplomatic recognition. The French expected that a Confederate victory would facilitate French economic dominance in Mexico. Napoleon helped the Confederacy by shipping urgently needed supplies through the ports of Matamoros, Mexico, and Brownsville, Texas. The Confederacy itself sought closer relationships with Mexico. Juarez turned them down, but the Confederates worked well with local warlords in northern Mexico, and with the French invaders.J. Fred Rippy. \\"Mexican Projects of the Confederates\\". Southwestern Historical Quarterly 22#4 (1919), pp. 291–317Kathryn Abbey Hanna, \\"The Roles of the South in the French Intervention in Mexico\\". Journal of Southern History 20#1 (1954), pp. 3–21 Realizing that Washington could not intervene in Mexico as long as the Confederacy controlled Texas, France invaded Mexico in 1861 and installed an Austrian prince Maximilian I of Mexico as its puppet ruler in 1864. Owing to the shared convictions of the democratically elected government of Juárez and Lincoln, Matías Romero, Juárez's minister to Washington, mobilized support in the U.S. Congress, and raised money, soldiers and ammunition in the United States for the war against Maximilian. Washington repeatedly protested France's violation of the Monroe Doctrine. Once the Union won the war in spring 1865, the U.S. allowed supporters of Juárez to openly purchase weapons and ammunition and issued stronger warnings to Paris. Washington sent general William Tecumseh Sherman with 50,000 combat veterans to the Mexican border to emphasize that time had run out on the French intervention. Napoleon III had no choice but to withdraw his outnumbered army in disgrace. Emperor Maximilian refused exile and was executed by the Mexican government in 1867.Robert Ryal Miller. \\"Matias Romero: Mexican Minister to the United States during the Juarez-Maximilian Era\\". Hispanic American Historical Review (1965) 45#2 pp. 228–245. Other countries =Russia= Russian–Union relations were very generally cooperative. Alone among European powers, Russia offered oratorical support for the Union, largely due to the view that the U.S. served as a counterbalance to the British Empire.Norman A. Graebner. \\"Northern Diplomacy and European Neutrality\\". Why the North Won the Civil War, ed. David Donald (1960), pp. 57–58. During the winter of 1861–1862, the Imperial Russian Navy sent two fleets to American waters to avoid their getting trapped if a war broke out with Britain and France. Many Americans at the time viewed this as an intervention on behalf of the Union, though historians deny this.Thomas A. Bailey. \\"The Russian Fleet Myth Re-Examined\\". Mississippi Valley Historical Review, Vol. 38, No. 1 (June 1951), pp. 81–90 The Alexander Nevsky and the other vessels of the Atlantic squadron stayed in American waters for seven months (September 1863 to June 1864). 1865 saw a major project attempted: the building of a Russian–American telegraph line from Seattle, Washington through British Columbia, Russian America (Alaska) and Siberia – an early attempt to link East–West communications. It failed and never operated.Rosemary Neering, Continental Dash: The Russian-American Telegraph (1989) In 1863, Russia brutally suppressed a large scale insurrection in Poland during the January Uprising. Many Polish resistance leaders fled the country, and Confederate agents tried and failed to encourage them to come to America to join the Confederacy.Krzysztof Michalek. \\"Diplomacy of the Last Chance: The Confederate Efforts to Obtain Military Support from the Polish Emigration Circles\\". American Studies (1987), Vol. 6, pp 5–16. = The Netherlands= The Lincoln administration looked abroad for places to relocate freed slaves who wanted to leave the United States. It opened U.S. negotiations with the Dutch government regarding African American migration and colonization of the Dutch colony of Suriname in South America. Nothing came of the idea, and after 1864 the idea was dropped.Michael J. Douma. \\"The Lincoln Administration's Negotiations to Colonize African Americans in Dutch Suriname\\". Civil War History 61#2 (2015): 111–137. =Garibaldi= The Italian hero Giuseppe Garibaldi was one of the most famous people in Europe as a proponent of liberty; Washington sent a diplomat to invite him to become an American general. Garibaldi declined the offer because he would not be given supreme power over all the armies, and because the United States was not yet committed to abolishing slavery. Historians agree that it was just as well because he was too independent in thought and deed to have worked smoothly with the U.S. government.R. J. Amundson, \\"Sanford and Garibaldi\\". Civil War History 14#.1 (1968): 40–45. World perspective Historian Don H. Doyle has argued that the Union victory had a major impact on the course of world history.Don H. Doyle, The Cause of All Nations: An International History of the American Civil War (2014) The Union victory energized popular democratic forces. A Confederate victory, on the other hand, would have meant a new birth of slavery, not freedom. Historian Fergus Bordewich, following Doyle, argues that: =Postwar adjustments= Relations with Britain (and Canada) were tense; Canada was seen at fault in the St. Albans Raid into Vermont in 1864. The Canadian government captured the Confederates who robbed a bank and killed an American, then released them, angering American opinion.John Herd Thompson and Stephen J. Randall. Canada and the United States: Ambivalent Allies (4th ed. 2008) pp. 36–37. London forced the Canadian Confederation in 1867, in part as a way to meet the American challenge without risking on British armed forces. The U.S. looked the other way when Irish activists known as Fenians tried and failed badly in an invasion of Canada in 1871. The arbitration of the Alabama Claims in 1872 provided a satisfactory reconciliation; the British paid the United States $15.5 million for the economic damage caused by Confederate warships purchased from it.Maureen M. Robson. \\"The Alabama Claims and the Anglo- American Reconciliation, 1865–71\\". Canadian Historical Review (1961) 42#1 pp. 1–22. Congress did pay Russia for the Alaska Purchase in 1867, but otherwise rejected proposals for any major expansions, such as the proposal by President Ulysses Grant to acquire Santo Domingo.

She was emerged as a candidate for the Aberdeenshire East constituency of the Scottish Parliament in July 2015. and was selected by local party members the following month. She was elected to serve as MSP in the 2016 Scottish Parliament election.Aberdeenshire East – BBC News The seat was previously held by Alex Salmond.  Parliamentary work  Martin brought forward the Seat Belts on School Transport (Scotland) Bill. The purpose of the Bill is to introduce a requirement to Scottish law that all dedicated home-to-school transport service vehicles are fitted with seat belts, as there is presently no UK legal obligation for the provision of seatbelts on such vehicles. On 27 June 2018 the Scottish Government announced that Martin would be appointed Minister for Further Education, Higher Education and Science. Following media attention around a series of offensive blogs Martin wrote during her time as a college lecturer, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon subsequently withdrew Martin's nomination when presenting her new ministerial team to the Scottish Parliament for approval. In September 2018, Martin was appointed as Convener of the Environment, Climate Change and Land Reform Committee. From 2016 to 2018 Martin was co- convenor of the Scottish Parliament cross-party group on Oil and Gas. She has used her time in parliament to highlight the downturn of the oil and gas sector in the North East, and the effect it has had on those living in Aberdeenshire East. Martin has spoken out on behalf of workers who have been discriminated against due to their oil and gas connections, and has been a vocal supporter of the efforts being by the Scottish Government made to assist those facing unemployment. Personal life Martin is married to a teacher and has two children. She lives in Newmachar, Aberdeenshire.  Controversies  In 2018, Martin apologised \\"unreservedly\\" for \\"inappropriate and offensive\\" remarks she had posted on a blog about transgender people in 2007. On 28 June 2018, she issued a second apology about offensive remarks made a decade earlier about the tipping habits of black customers.

Bouchard Jr. (Johnson & Bouchard, 2005) They developed the model by analyzing Gf-Gc theory, John Carroll’s Three-stratum theory and Vernon’s verbal-perceptual model. The g-VPR model is a four stratum model: # First stratum: Primary traits. # Second stratum: Broader than stratum I, but still narrow abilities. # Third stratum: Verbal, perceptual and rotation factors. # Fourth stratum: g factor. VPR model  Why Johnson and Bouchard claim the g-VPR model is better  Johnson and Bouchard made comparisons between Gf-Gc, three-stratum and verbal-spatial model. They found that Vernon's verbal-perceptual model got better modeling- fit results than the other two, but still did not fit very well. Then, based on the verbal-spatial model, Johnson and Bouchard \\"began by adding a memory factor (labeled content memory to distinguish it from the memory factor in the fluid-crystallized model)\\". They also made some extra changes to improve model fit. According to results from CAB (comprehensive ability battery), they added/moved loadings to adjust new model. Then it came into a new \\"visual- perceptual-memory\\" model. However, Johnson and Bouchard found that \\"[i]solation of the tests involved resulted in identification of an additional third-stratum factor for image rotation, which also eliminated the contradictory cross-loadings.\\" Therefore, finally, the new model was named as verbal-perceptual-rotation (VPR) model. After Johnson and Bouchard concluded this g-VPR intelligence structure model, they compared the model fit of g-VPR with the Gf-Gc model and the verbal-spatial model. Results showed that the g-VPR model fitted better than any other models. In the article, Johnson and Bouchard (2005) also discussed specifically about the g-VPR model and Gf-Gc theory. According to Garlick (2002), special neuronal connections will be built under environmental stimuli when people's knowledge and skills are developed. We may thus relate the Gf-Gc theory with forming neuronal connections. However, forming of the neuronal connections under environmental stimuli takes place individually; it is uncertain for a universal process. \\"We can understand how intellectual performance emerges in the individual through the use of Gf–Gc theory, but understanding why intellectual performance takes the particular pattern it does requires comparison across individuals. The distinction between fluid and crystallized intelligence can only emerge to the extent that it is possible to develop a battery of tests that accurately distinguishes between material to which test takers should have been exposed and tasks that they should find novel.\\" (Johnson & Bouchard, 2005) Another problem is about the \\"Flynn effect\\" (Dickens & Flynn, 2002). Vocabulary performance (considered as crystallized intelligence) has smaller cohort effects than reasoning performance (considered as fluid intelligence). Both exposure to vocabulary task and reasoning task have been increased greatly in past decades. However, whatever there is a great increase in mental ability test score, the performance on fluid intelligence \\"may merely reflect greater development of related neuronal patterns.\\" The g-VPR model includes the idea that the left brain is related to verbal and logical process, and the right brain is related to non-verbal, spatial process (e.g., Gray, 1999; Hugdahl, 2000; Toga & Thompson, 2003) Under this framework, the results of factor analysis can gain a clear explanation.

She worked in the archaeological excavation sites in Sicily and Athens for her doctoral thesis from Princeton University on the subject of Hellenistic houses at Morgantina. Her thesis was published as The Domestic Architecture of Morgantina in the Hellenistic and Roman Periods (1984). She taught at the Vanderbilt University's Department of Classical Studies and was an associate professor from 1992 to 2019. Biography Tsakirgis was from Boston, Massachusetts. She studied at Yale University from 1972 to 1976 and obtained a Bachelor of Arts (Cum laude in Classics). She then pursued her studies in archaeology from Princeton University and received Master of Arts in June 1979 and doctoral degree (Ph.D.) in January 1984. Her doctoral thesis was on Hellenistic Greek art and archaeology for which she did field investigations at Athens and Sicily. These excavations were done at Morgantina, La Befa, Corinth, and the Athenian Agora which provided information on how the past history and human behavior as patterns and activities of human behavior have replicated over time. She also studied at the American School of Classical Studies in Athens during 1975, and 1980–1981. Her studies included at the American Numismatic Society during 1982. Tsakirgis started her professional career in the Princeton University as an Assistant Instructor in 1979. In 1984 she joined as assistant professor in the Department of Classical Studies, and in the College of Arts and Science, Vanderbilt University, and worked as associate professor from 1992 to 2019. She was chair of the Faculty Council of the College of Arts and Science and the Secretary of the College Faculty between 2005 and 2011 for two terms. Earlier, she worked as the director of undergraduate studies and the director of graduate studies. She teaches several courses with a \\"multi- and interdisciplinary approach to classical antiquity.\\" Based on her research activities in Greek architecture and urbanism, she also conducts classes on Greek art, the Periklean period of fifth century BC Athens, and the institutions of the Greek city. Her teaching assignments also cover subjects such as Alexander the Great and the Trojan War with specific relevance to history, art, and literature. Her teaching assignment has, from time to time, involved seminar in writing on \\"spectacle (drama and sports) in the Greek and Roman world\\". During 2010, she did a hands-on-training for 18 students of the university at an excavation site in Greece. Tsakirgis was a long-time member of the research team excavating the Hellenistic city of Morgantina in Sicily; her particular interests, on which she has published, have been in the domestic organisation of the houses and households and the decorated pavements. For her research studies in Greece, Tsakirgis received many research grants such as the Franklin grant from the American Philosophical Society in 2012 to pursue research and publish papers and books on the excavations of houses in the Athenian Agora. With these funds she also did research in Greece on the houses and compared it with the Athenian houses. She died on January 16, 2019.

It is bounded by Monmouth, Mercer and Shelton Streets, and comprises a perimeter of terraced buildings surrounding Ching Court, a public space. A 1980s regeneration of the block by the architecture firm Terry Farrell and Partners is considered an exemplar of British postmodern architecture. History The site was created when Thomas Neale laid out the Seven Dials area in 1692. By the 1970s the block was occupied by an ageing, densely-packed cluster of terraced houses surrounding a yard that had been completely filled with building extensions. The whole Seven Dials area was then considered run-down and ripe for wholesale redevelopment. Between 1978 and 1988 Terry Farrell and Partners undertook a multi-phase regeneration of the block for the Comyn Ching architectural ironmongery, who had been in business on Shelton Street since before 1723 and owned the entire block. The scheme comprised the restoration of 25 early 18th century houses; three new infill buildings at the three corners of the block, replacing \\"poorer quality\\" 19th century buildings; and the clearance of the hodgepodge of building extensions in the centre of the block to create a new public square called Ching Court. The regeneration was commenced in consultation with the Greater London Council historic buildings division. The three new buildings at the corner lots were sold to private developers to finance the repair of the historic listed buildings. Comyn Ching and Company moved their operations to Holborn but kept a showroom at 17-19 Shelton Street. The three new buildings were each designed to respond to their particular context, but also to complement one another and the existing urban fabric. Reception The scheme was well received by historians and architects as an exemplary work of urban regeneration. It won a Civic Trust Award in 1985. Brian Ashley Barker, architect and former director of the Heritage of London Trust, wrote in the Architects' Journal of 6 March 1985: \\"Where the old fabric has been kept it has been revered and treated seriously; but in the final result we are not so much aware of old and new co-existing side by side as of one single lively identity embodied in the still recognisable historic streets.\\" The 2014 book London's Contemporary Architecture: An Explorer's Guide, by Ken Allison and Victoria Thornton, praised the \\"extraordinary\\" detailing of the scheme and called it a \\"fine urbanistic exercise whose stylistic tropes are now so unfashionable that, some 30 years later, we still find it difficult to acknowledge the work\\". In the same year the columnist Sir Simon Jenkins cited Comyn Ching as an example of \\"postmodernism’s skill at context\\", calling the scheme \\"little-noticed (and therefore brilliant)\\". In support of the 2016 historic listing bid, Henrietta Billings of the Twentieth Century Society called Comyn Ching \\"an important and influential example of postmodern urban development that fully deserves recognition and protection through listing\\". Several other noted architectural theorists wrote to Historic England in support. Charles Jencks stated: \\"This post-modern strategy of creating what could be called the Time City has today become much more prevalent even among modernists – witness Norman Foster at Berlin’s Reichstag or David Chipperfield’s mixed methods at the Neues Museum in the same city – but Comyn Ching was the first example here 40 years before, and should be preserved and celebrated for starting this more inclusive approach.\\" Deyan Sudjic called the scheme \\"a painstaking piece of urban embroidery, lovingly carried out by an architectural team determined to do things differently from the dogmatic approaches of the past, combining mixed-use development, creative insertion, and handsome restoration\\". Architectural critic Jonathan Glancey wrote: \\"With its unexpected courtyard, its intriguing passageways, fairy-tale entrances, rich use of materials and colour, and imaginative corner towers, Farrell's Comyn Ching is an enchanting development [...] The scheme is also important because, both physically and ideologically, it marks a major break away from the kind of comprehensive redevelopment that, fashionable until the early 1970s, would have seen not just Seven Dials, but effectively the whole of Covent Garden swept away for inept and insensitive new development.\\" Rowan Moore said: \\"it is becoming an increasingly important and pressing question which works of this period should be protected by listing. Comyn Ching is up there with the best, representing Farrell’s thinking about the urban fabric and its renovation. It is also one of the best examples of his use of ornament.\\" Proposed alterations In late 2015 Rolfe Judd Planning, on behalf of property investor Shaftesbury and Morrow & Lorraine Architects, submitted a planning application to Camden London Borough Council for alterations to Comyn Ching Triangle. These include the removal of a triangular window at Monmouth and Shelton streets, meant to echo the triangular plan of the Seven Dials blocks, replacing it with a flush window behind balconets, as well as the replacement of wooden doors on Shelton Street to provide level access. Terry Farrell strongly objected to the proposal, stating: \\"The removal of the triangular motif that runs up the front of the building, which provides it with an unusually dynamic push-and-pull, in-and-out geometry that speaks rather powerfully to the junction of Shelton and Monmouth, would effectively drain it of much of its effect. To replace this with a run-of-the-mill, uniform flat window and balcony is not acceptable.\\" The alterations were announced the same week as proposed changes to 76 Fenchurch Street, another postmodern Farrell building from the same era which he is also trying to preserve. The proposed changes were approved by the council in early 2016. In response his practice, Farrells, has applied to Historic England for an urgent listing of the scheme. Adam Nathaniel Furman, a researcher at Farrells, explained that the company hopes Comyn Ching \\"can set a precedent that post- modern architecture is worth protection\\". In November 2016 Historic England announced a Grade II listing of the scheme. They stated: \\"Comyn Ching Triangle represents Postmodernism at its purest and is an early, masterful exercise in placemaking by one of the country’s leading architects. It is widely seen as one of Terry Farrell’s most important works of the time where he delivered much-needed urban regeneration to Covent Garden by keeping, respecting and integrating historic buildings, rather than redeveloping the site.\\" References Category:Covent Garden Category:Postmodern architecture in the United Kingdom Category:Squares in the London Borough of Camden Category:Terry Farrell buildings ","title":"Comyn Ching Triangle"},{"id":"50432372","text":"Andrés Gómez was the defending champion but he lost in the second round to Gary Muller.

The system would have included 500 bikes and 34 stands in downtown Helsinki, modeled after the Paris Vélib' program, with part of the program costs to be paid by commercial businesses in exchange for 45 double- sided advertisement boards inside the city centre. However Helsinki could not agree places for advertisement boards and the deal was cancelled. In 2015 HKL made agreement with Moventia and Smoove about 2nd generation City Bikes and operation started in May 2016. During the first week of operation, the bikes were used 15 000 times, which amounted to more than 6 rides per bike per day. In first three weeks 43 000 trips were made with the bikes and system had 6 000 registered users. During the first season when 500 bikes were in operation users rode over 740 000 kilometers. After successful start Helsinki metropolitan area cities Espoo and Vantaa are considering joining the Helsinki bike sharing system. Autumn 2016 Espoo decided to start pilot trial with Helsinki bikes in summer 2017. July 2017 system had 28 000 registered users for annual pass which is over double compared to 2016 season. Helsinki ranked first in the study made in 2019 about the popularity of city bikes in different cities around the world. In the study, the Helsinki City Bike System was compared with 50 cities around the world. Rate of use was used as a measure of popularity, ie the number of journeys made per bike per day. Hubs and bikes Helsinki City Bike in hub at Hietalahdentori Helsinki's city bike system was opened in May 2016 with 50 city bike stations (hubs) and 500 bikes serving the inner city area. The system was expanded for the 2017 season to 150 hubs and 1500 bikes, covering Munkkiniemi, Pasila and Kumpula in addition to the inner city. For the 2018 season the system was expanded to Espoo, having 70 stations from May and 35 more to be added during the summer. And had altogether 2550 city bikes. Rental system The rental system is fully web- based. Unlike many other city bike systems, riders do not need to pick up a card to access the system. A rider can register for and pay for a daily, weekly or annual pass. The rider will be given a personal cyclist ID and a PIN code for unlocking a bike from any station. The locations of stations and information about bike availability can be accessed on HSL's Journey Planner. A HSL Travel Card can be used instead of a cyclist ID. The pass entitles the user to an unlimited number of rides of up to 30 minutes. Extra charges apply for longer journeys. Bikes are available from April until 31 October, unlike many other public bicycle programs that are available throughout the year. Financing and management The Helsinki city bike system is procured by Helsinki City Transport. The contract has been made for 10 years for a total value of 12 950 000 euros. The bikes and bike stations are supplied by Smoove, and Moventia is responsible for supplying the stations with bikes at even rates and for the upkeep of the bikes. Clear Channel Finland organizes project promotion and partnerships as a Moventia & Smoove subcontractor. Helsinki Cooperative Society Elanto’s (HOK-Elanto's) grocery store Alepa is the main cooperation partner of the city bike's and supports the system's implementation. Integration with public transport City bikes form a part of the overall public transport travel chain in Helsinki. The city bike stations, the availability of bikes and route information are included in the revised Helsinki Region Transport (HSL) on-line journey planner. The inclusion of city bikes in the public transport routing system is unique by worldwide standards. Locations of stations and information about bike availability is also available as Open data API.

It was designed by British game company Glitchers in 2016 in association with Alzheimer's Research UK, University College London and the University of East Anglia and with funding from Deutsche Telekom. The idea for the game came from neuroscientist Michael Hornberger of the University of East Anglia who collaborated with Hugo Spiers of University College London and a group of six other neuroscientists. The game was designed to help researchers to understand the mental process of 3D navigation, which is one of the first skills lost in dementia. It was hoped that a large number of people would play the game, thus contributing much more data than could easily be obtained in a laboratory experiment. The plot of the game involves a sea journey taken by a son in a quest to recover the memories his father has lost to dementia. There are three sections: navigation, shooting flares to test orientation, and chasing creatures. Each has been \\"carefully crafted to be as fun and exciting as it is scientifically valid\\". It was named \\"App of the week\\" by BT. It won nine Cannes Lions at the 2016 International Festival of Creativity. By February 2017, the game had been downloaded 2.7 million times. In August 2017, Sea Hero Quest came in a virtual reality edition. The game was nominated for the 2018 British Academy Games Awards, in the new category \\"Game Beyond Entertainment\\" for games which \\"deliver a transformational experience beyond pure entertainment\\". At the 2018 Webby Awards, it won the award for \\"Social Impact\\". It was also nominated for the Coney Island Dreamland Award for Best AR/VR Game at the 2020 New York Game Awards.

Lorenz had been looking for a place to continue research on greylag geese and the biologist Otto König facilitated the establishment of an appropriate field station in association with a recently established game park in Grünau.http://derstandard.at/1285199085788/Jubilaeum-20-Jahre-Konrad-Lorenz- Forschungsstelle For seven years, the Max Planck Society financed the facility, before the Austrian Academy of Sciences took over the financing in 1980. Konrad Lorenz died in 1989, which required a re-structuring of the field station. Since 1990, the reformed Konrad Lorenz Forschungsstelle is maintained by a private association, the federal province of Upper Austria and the University of Vienna. The KLF is chaired by the behavioural biologist Kurt Kotrschal. In 2008, the Wolf Science Center was established as a spin-off of the KLF.https://idw-online.de/de/news386890 Research In line with the legacy of Konrad Lorenz, the research focus of the KLF lies on behavioural biology of birds and cognitive studies. Research models are in particular greylag goose, bald ibis and corvid birds. In addition to behavioural studies, the KLF is active in conservation efforts of bold ibis and was the first institution world-wide that succeeded in establishing a self-sustained colony of bold ibis from birds bred in captivity.http://klf.univie.ac.at/ Funding and facilities The core—funding of 80,000 Euro per year is provided from private sources (one third) and as a subsidy by the province of Upper Austria (two thirds).

In the late Middle Ages it was known as Hagios Donatos (Ἄγιος Δονᾶτος). History The city was likely settled since Classical Antiquity, but is only known in later times. It appears in the 6th-century Synecdemus, and according to Procopius of Caesarea, it was restored by Justinian I (). Procopius says that it originally stood in a marshy situation, and that Justinian built a citadel upon a neighbouring height.Procop. 4.1; That citadel was likely named after Saint Donatus; in the lists of Justinian's buildings provided by Procopius, there are two forts of that name in the province of Epirus Vetus. The city is attested as a bishopric, a suffragan see of the Metropolis of Naupaktos, since the Council of Chalcedon in 451. Only a few of its bishops are known: John (at the Council of Chalcedon), Diadochus (signatory of a letter on the murder of Proterius of Alexandria to Emperor Leo I the Thracian), Hilarius (signatory of a letter to Pope Hormisdas), Manuel (at the time of Germanus II of Constantinople), Antony (in 1564), and Nicholas (). From the 10th century, the see was moved to nearby Bela, probably for a short time at first; by the 13th century, the bishopric resided permanently at Bela. By that time, Photice itself was known as Hagios Donatos; the chastel de Saint Donnat was promised as his wife's dowry to Philip of Taranto by Nikephoros I Komnenos Doukas, Despot of Epirus. In the revolt of Epirus in 1338/39 against the Byzantine emperor Andronikos III Palaiologos (), Hagios Donatos remained loyal to the emperor. In 1367 or 1368 the town, under its ruler Bardas, abandoned the allegiance to the Serbian ruler of Epirus, Thomas Preljubović, but in 1380 Thomas purchased its possession. In 1411 the town submitted to Carlo I Tocco, who later appointed his second son, Torno, as its governor. Paramythia, which eventually succeeded the settlement, is attested at about the same time. The Ottomans knew the town as \\"Aidonat Kalesi\\". Location and remains Its site is located near the modern area of Limponi, some 2 km northwest of Paramythia. Remains of the fortifications on a rocky plateau, stretching in an east–west direction with sheer cliffs to the west, include walls up to 5 m high, remains of a gate with tower, and of a square keep. The wider area features a number of Byzantine monuments: At the site of Balsamari, remains of a three-aisled Byzantine basilica, probably dating to the 11th century, dedicated to Saint Photeine. Its dimensions are 13.7 m × 12.3 m, and its walls survived in places up to 2.5 m in height. West of Balsamari, at Palioklisi, remains of an early Christian basilica on a hilltop. Probably three-aisled, some 20 m × 14 m large, with walls up to 2 m high, in the apse up to 4.5 m. West of Plioklisi is the Panagia Lampobithra (or Lampovitsa), a ruined small, one-aisled church, some 7 m × 5 m large. In Paramythia itself lies the Church of the Dormition or Great Church (Μεγάλη Εκκλησία), a late Byzantine three-aisled basilica. Some 100 m to the north are remains of a Byzantine bath-house. Some 3 km south of Paramythia, near the village of Chrysavgi, remains of a three-aisled basilica (6th/7th century).

During the Middle Ages, gold and silver coins saw widespread use as currency in Europe, and facilitated trade with the Middle East and Asia; the shortage of these metals therefore became a problem for European economies. Many causes for the famine have been proposed, such as the Hundred Years' War (1337–1453), depopulation and poor agricultural output due to the aftermath of the Black Death (1346–1353), and an outflow of silver to the east unmatched by mining output. The Late Middle Ages particularly saw a deficit in silver rather than gold. Overview Numerous factors may have caused the Great Bullion Famine. In the 14th century, the Black Death ravaged Europe, killing over half of its population, and leaving many areas heavily depopulated and unable to meet previous levels of economic production. In addition, Europe had a long-running precious metal deficit in its trade with the Middle East and Asia, ever since the days of the Roman Empire. This is due to the fact that products from China and India such as spices, silks, and cotton, were very rare or completely unavailable in Europe, and thus highly valued - but Europe lacked as many goods to trade back to the east, and so relied on precious metals, which were always in demand due to their use in coinage, bullion, and luxury goods. This meant that in exchange for renewable eastern goods, Europe was trading away its non-renewable precious metals. Additionally, the price of goods was very low in Europe, making the trade deficit worse. Silver mine in Kutná Hora in 15th century These factors likely led to the weakening of Europe's silver mines. Since 1392, the minting of silver in France had slowed to a trickle, and at about the same time Sweden ceased minting silver for the next twenty years. An absence of bullion urged mints in the Rhineland to shut one after another between 1440 and 1443, as well as silver mines in present- day Germany, Austria, Czech Republic, and Slovakia. One of the largest silver mines in Europe, located in Kutná Hora in the Kingdom of Bohemia (modern-day Czech Republic), had at one point represented one third of Europe's total silver production, but in 1370 its output began to wane, and it was later shut down by King Sigismund in 1422. Production of silver also diminished in mines at Srebrenica, Kingdom of Bosnia and Novo Brdo in the Serbian Despotate. From 1440 to 1450, many other major European mints, including in England, also saw greatly reduced outputs. The English mint at Calais shut down completely in 1442, and at one point the Tower of London housed the only active mint in Northwestern Europe. At the height of the Bullion Famine, mints closed down in Flanders, Holland, Hainaut, Dordrecht and Valenciennes. Combined with the trade deficit resulting from the eastern trade, this led to a critical scarcity of precious metals and a shortage of coins, mainly those with small denominations. Due to the bullion famine, the wage rates were affected during the 15th century. The silver crisis The scarcity of silver peaked in the mid-15th century throughout Europe. Silver mines started to slump in output during the 14th century, partly due to the economic toll of the Black Death, as well as an inability to access and mine silver at greater depths due to an inability to prevent the mines from flooding. This issue not only affected silver mines, but also copper mines where copper was also used as a currency in some places for lesser values. Additionally, the process of liquation had not yet been developed, and so ores containing silver, such as the silver-rich copper of Central Europe, could not be refined into usable silver. This scarcity affected all of Europe, including the Kingdom of England, which drastically reduced the amount of new silver coin issued for circulation during the crisis. Edward I of England issued 100 tonnes of silver coin from 1278 to 1280, but Henry IV of England, who ruled during the Famine, only issued 2 tonnes of new coin from 1412 to 1414. In order to prevent deflation, measures such as debasement were taken, but ultimately the price of goods still remained so low as to cause economic hardship. The inability of silver mines to match demand led to a search for an alternative, such as gold. The availability of gold did not provide a solution for the crisis however, because gold was more highly valued than silver and was not suitable for small transactions. Eventually, the problem of the scarcity of silver would spread from Europe to the Middle East, and would affect the Far East, including the Ming Dynasty. Venetian silver trade The Venetian silver trade was greatly affected by the Bullion Famine. Normally, silver produced in mines in Central Europe and the Balkans flowed through Venetian ports, to be traded with merchants for Eastern goods. The Venetian export of silver to the East increased at a rate of over 20 tons per year in the 1420s. Apparently at this point, only Bosnian silver was able to make up for the scarcity of silver in Europe. In the 15th century, Venetian ships that went to Alexandria or the Black Sea ports for exchange often brought with them gold and silver coins and bullion worth approximately 100,000 ducats. Over time, even Bosnian silver mines started to decline in production, and during the 1430s Venetian traders primarily began to trade using gold instead. People struggled in other parts of Europe at this time without the flow of silver and gold; with a shortage of currency, people were unable to perform daily transactions, and deflation drove down the price of goods, which also had the effect of impoverishing those who would produce or sell the goods. Additionally, the operating silver mines in Serbia were taken by the Turks in 1455, and they also captured the last Bosnian mine in 1460. In 1462, the Doge Cristoforo Moro minted the last silver grosso, and on 17 March 1464 they traded most of the city’s money with Syria and nothing was left behind except small coins. By this point, Constantinople had already fallen to the Ottomans as well, meaning that the Venetians were locked out of the Black Sea trade due to Turkish control over the Bosphorus Strait. At this point, the Bullion Famine peaked, which culminated in a suffocation of Venetian trade. The gold crisis The Great Bullion Famine did not only affect the European silver supply, but also resulted from gold mining in Europe. Christian merchants in Europe used gold as a currency, which created a demand for gold, too. Initially, Portugal was struck in 1383 when it minted its last gold coin until 1435. The production of gold in the northwestern part of Europe greatly declined from 1414 to 1454. Flanders (modern-day Belgium) was one of Europe's major producers of gold, but in 1454, its gold mints were closed. Nearby Brabant also stopped minting gold from 1439 to 1453 due to insufficient supply. Similarly, mints in other places such as Amiens, Saint-Quentin, Tournai, and the Rhineland were also short on gold. Sooner or later, the shortage of gold compounded and caused the market price for gold to exceed legal rates, forcing the production of gold coins to cease in many places. German and Central European silver and copper mining boom =Phase I= The Bullion Famine led to the need for an alternate way of acquiring silver. In 1448, new silver mines at Schneeberg, Saxony and Schwaz, Tyrol were explored to fulfill the skyrocketing demand for silver. In 1451, a new process known as liquation was discovered which allowed the silver-rich copper of Central Europe to be separated into silver and copper, and by the late 1450s, Martin Claus of Gotha found a solution to the problem of flooding silver mines in Saxony. The old mines quickly re-opened, and new discoveries were made in the Harz Mountains (the Erzgebirge). Old silver mines including those in Kutná Hora, Freiberg, and Rammelsberg resumed full-scale operation. The boom of silver-copper mining started in the 1460s and peaked in 1540 in Central Europe. =Phase II= Joachimsthaler Silver coinThe flow of silver was steady, and a huge amount of silver came from Italy in 1471, which grew to become the key area of silver trade. Milan in northern Italy became the major city for bullion exchange, especially silver. The Venetians learned from the silver crisis of 1465, and they used copper coins instead of silver as currency in 1473. The well-organized precious metal trade in Venice led the Venetians to open new copper mines in the Alps. The idea of using copper as a currency took a long time to get used to for the Venetians and those who traded with them; even after copper-based currency started flowing into the market, the desire for silver did not end. That continued demand led to the opening of a silver mine at Joachimsthal in Bohemia in 1516, which produced 3 million ounces of silver per year at its peak in the 1530s. Silver from the Joachimsthal mine was used to make silver coins called Joachimsthaler, which later came to be called the Thaler and saw use around much of Europe for over four hundred years. This name lives on today in the dollar as well as the Slovenian tolar. Portuguese-African gold trade The shortage of gold during the 15th century in Europe motivated importation of gold from other continents. The Portuguese attempted to solve the gold shortage by traveling to Africa where gold was rumored to be found in abundance. This rumor likely originated from the fact that the trans-Saharan trade routes between the Songhai and North African traders had long provided Europe with gold. At one point, two thirds of Europe's gold originated from sub-Saharan Africa. Portuguese expansion into Africa began due to the determination of King John I to get into the gold-producing parts of West Africa. Eventually, King John's son, Prince Henry the Navigator, would send out expeditions to further explore these opportunities to find gold. In the beginning, the Portuguese founded trading posts along the coast of West Africa instead of long-lasting settlements. Hopes arose when the Portuguese captain Antão Gonçalves found gold in Guinea, West Africa and brought it back to Lisbon in 1441. Eventually, the Portuguese would realize this gold was making its way to Morocco across the Sahara, and seek to secure this trade for themselves. Gold was still in high demand, as the capture of Constantinople by the Ottoman Turks in 1453 was a huge loss for Venetian traders, whose ships were now locked out of the Black Sea trade due to Turkish control of the Bosphorus Strait. The critical deficiency of gold in Venice and in other places made the price of gold shoot up, to the point that gold was worth around 12.5 times as much as silver. However, in 1455, Sicily imported 15,000 ounces of gold from North Africa in return for wheat, and that same year, 1455 Portugal would mint coins made from African gold. Before long, the Portuguese replaced the Venetians and found a flow of gold from Africa that satisfied the demand of Europe's economy. Since 1440, the Portuguese had imported smaller volumes of gold from Senegal and the Gambia. However, after 1471, the Portuguese-African gold trade began in earnest when the Portuguese arrived at so-called \\"Gold Coast\\" of Guinea, in present-day Ghana. By 1482, they had built a fortress at Sao Jorge da Mina to cement their hold on the coast and nearby trade. In the near future, the Portuguese were shipping as much as 25,000 ounces of gold per year back to Lisbon in a treasure fleet of 12 caravels. The Portuguese also built forts at Cape Blanco, Sierra Leone to safeguard their trading posts from competing European traders. By doing this, the Portuguese diverted the trade of gold and slaves around the Sahara desert and directly to Europe, bringing about the decline of the trans-Saharan trade routes, and the rise of Portugal as an influential trading power. Even though a variety of English voyagers attempted to break into the African gold trade, the Portuguese preserved a majority hold on it all the way through the 16th century. The Portuguese explorer Bartolomeu Dias would later round the Cape of Good Hope in 1488 in an attempt to establish a sea route to India, and four years later, Christopher Columbus would discover the New World, opening the door to a completely new source of precious metal imports. Age of Discovery and the end of the Famine The Central European silver-copper mining boom, brought about by alternate methods of manufacturing and mining silver, signaled the end of the silver crisis in Europe. In addition, Portuguese explorations of the coast of Africa initiated new and innovative routes for Europeans to acquire sub-Saharan gold. Demand for gold would later be a great motivator of exploration in the Americas during the Age of Discovery, and may have even contributed to the myth of the Seven Cities of Gold. Christopher Columbus mentioned gold in the diary documenting his first voyage 65 times. After the mid-16th century, the discovery of silver in Latin America put an end to the Great Bullion Famine for good, and Europe entered an era of rising prices known as the price revolution, and trade with the Eastern world greatly increased.

(\\"Essay on the customs and spirit of nations and key facts of history from Charlemagne to Louis XIII.\\") is a work by the French writer, historian, and philosopher Voltaire, published for the first time in 1756. It discusses the history of Europe before Charlemagne until the dawn of the age of Louis XIV, also addressing the colonies and the East. The 174-chapter work resulted from fifteen years of research by Voltaire at Cirey, Brussels, Paris, Lunéville, Prussia, Alsace and Geneva. Voltaire revised the text until his death in 1778, expanding an Appendix with defences of the work and responses to criticism.  Content  The Essai is a work of Enlightenment philosophy as much as of history. It urges the active rejection of superstition and fable and their replacement by knowledge based on reason. Voltaire traced common themes across various human cultures and languages, explained by a shared reality but also shared human failings, such as superstitions and dreams, that kept humans from appreciating this reality. Voltaire was reacting against Jacques-Bénigne Bossuet's Speech of Universal History, which had presented Judeo-Christian nations as the most advanced. In contrast, the Essai praised ancient China and India. Voltaire also attempted to refute prejudices about the Muslim world, according to which the Ottoman Empire and all other Muslim states were despotisms in which individuals had no rights and no property of their own. He countered that these states differed among each other just as Christian states did, none of them treating subjects as slaves. He also pointed out that European feudalism gave individuals no more rights than a typical person in Turkey or Prussia. While arguing that Christianity was not essential for a civilised and highly moral society, Voltaire countered writers, including Pierre Bayle, who had used China as an example of a morally advanced culture based on atheism. Pointing to Chinese classic literature, including Confucius, Voltaire wrote that all societies, China included, had recognised a supreme being and used ideas of this being as a basis for morality. Voltaire credited his intellectual partner Émilie du Châtelet as an influence: She had criticised works of history that were dull lists of facts. The Essai was written to show that history could be readable and engaging so as to \\"enlighten the soul\\" rather than weigh it down.  Reception  The Jesuit preacher Claude-Adrien Nonnotte spent much of his life opposing the view on Christianity that Voltaire had taken in the Essai. At first, he anonymously published Examen critique ou Réfutation du livre des moeurs (\\"Critical examination or refutation of the book of customs\\"). Over the next twenty years, he wrote a succession of revised editions of this work, which was translated into Italian, German, Polish, and Portuguese. Voltaire, in turn, responded with criticisms of Nonnotte in revised editions of the Essai and in his Eclaircissements historiques (\\"Historical clarifications\\"). The critic Paul Sakmann praised the Essai as \\"large-scale, critically-sifted, and treated in a philosophical spirit\\". Siófra Pierse in 2013 wrote that it is \\"a magisterial work of compression, summary, synthesis and selectivity.\\" Saul Anton in 2012 described it as \\"a masterpiece of prose that pioneered many of the foundations of modern historical study and a style of historical discourse that placed the reader’s experience at the center.\\"  Published editions  * \\"Essai sur les mœurs et l’esprit des nations\\", Critical edition, in Œuvres complètes de Voltaire, (Voltaire Foundation, Oxford) Volumes: 22 , 23 , 24 , 25 , 26A , 26B , 26C * \\"Essai sur les mœurs et l'esprit des nations et sur les principaux faits de l'histoire depuis Charlemagne jusqu'à Louis XIII.\\" edited by René Pomeau (1990) in 2 Volumes (Garnier frères, Paris)  Notes and references   External links  * Prefaces and indexes to published volumes of the Essai Category:Philosophy essays Category:Works by Voltaire Category:1756 books Category:18th-century history books Category:Age of Enlightenment ","title":"Essai sur les mœurs et l'esprit des nations"},{"id":"50432823","text":"is a Japanese child actress.

Career Orme entered the British army as an ensign in the 35th Regiment of Foot but transferred to the Coldstream Guards in 1745. He became a lieutenant in that regiment in 1751. By the time of the French and Indian War, Orme was aide-de-camp to General Edward Braddock. Although officially a lieutenant, he became a brevet captain and was known as Captain Orme. Also serving as an aide to Braddock was George Washington who wished to acquire military experience and with whom Orme became friends. In 1755, Braddock was engaged in a push by British and American forces towards Fort Duquesne, in what is now Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania, which was held by French opposing forces. In July that year, Braddock's army was decisively ambushed by a smaller French and native Indian force in the Battle of the Monongahela with the loss of nearly 900 British and American soldiers. Braddock was mortally wounded and Orme shot in the leg. Some of the dead were scalped by the Native American allies of the French and their scalps nailed to trees in order to terrify the British. Orme escaped in the disorderly retreat and returned to England in 1755, becoming something of a celebrity as a survivor of the massacre. He resigned from the army in 1756.

The name's original spelling in the 11th century was Heron or Heroun. As early as the 17th century, the spellings Hearn, Hearne, and Harn would also appear in England and the United States. The Hearn family has sometimes been incorrectly linked with the Irish ancestral name Hearn. Origin The surname Hearn is thought to be derived from Hairun, a settlement near Rouen, Normandy. The name can be traced back to the English settlement after the Norman Conquest. The Clan Heron, a border-raiding clan along the Anglo-Scottish border, would settle at Chipchase Castle in the 17th century. History =In England= After the name's establishment in England from its Norman origin of Hairun in the eleventh century, numerous variations in the name's spelling would develop, including Heiron, Heron, and Herne. Alternate uses of the word occur in Old English as hyrne, meaning a nook or a corner of land or in a bend. In a glossary originating from Newcastle upon Tyne in 1825, both Hearn and Harn were used interchangeably to refer to a \\"coarse linen cloth\\" among the citizens of Newcastle. The variant spelling Heron has incorrectly led the name to be confused with the Irish name O'Heron (of which later variations would also include Heron and Hearn), an Anglicized form of the Gaelic Ó hUidhrín. The names, however, are of different origin. =Heron baronets= The Heron Baronetcy, of Chipchase,The Baronetage of England, Containing a Genealogical and Historical Account of all the Baronetcies now existing Vol 2.

Arrival in the United States =William Hearne (1627–91)= The Hearn family's arrival in the United States was a result of William Hearne, born in 1627 in London, son of baron Jordan Heron. Hearne was a Captain in Oliver Cromwell's army, and would later maintain a successful business enterprise in London selling Muscovado sugar from the West Indies between 1680 and 1688. Around 1688, William immigrated to America with his wife, Mary (née Cuthbert), settling on the border of contemporary Maryland and Delaware in Somerset County, United States, where he died in 1691. After his death, the Hearne estate in Maryland, nicknamed \\"St. Kitts\\" after Saint Kitts and Nevis, was occupied by his descendants for nearly two-hundred years. Variations and alternate spellings of the family name would occur onward from the seventeenth and eighteenth-centuries in both England and the United States, including Hearne and Harn.

Propane is pumped into shale rock formation instead of water. The use of propane does not block all pathways and therefore more natural gas is released. In addition, it does not carry poisonous chemicals and underground radioactivity back to the surface, and when it does comes back to the surface it can have another usage or be used again for LPG.Janiczek, Nathan. \\"Waterless Fracking: A Clean Substitute.\\" Our Energy Policy. http://www.ourenergypolicy.org/wp- content/uploads/2013/09/WA3.pdf (accessed May 1, 2016) The only drawback is the cost as propane is more expensive than water. Another drawback is that the possible leak of propane may lead to flash fire, so fracturing with propane requires more safety instructions and monitoring equipments in order to reduce possible risks. According to Nathan Janiczek, the new era of waterless fracturing is growing and it is called Liquefied Petroleum Gas, or LPG fracturing. LPG is always pumped in a well and because of that pumping, rocks are destroyed and gas is released. Besides that, LPG is fully converted into gas when it is pumped up to the surface and that guarantees a one hundred percent retrieval rate. If we compare conventional fracking and fracking using propane gel, LPG fracking does not produce waste, nearly 100% of propane gas is pumped back while 50% of hydraulic frack fluid remains underground. It has lower viscosity, less surface tension and lower specific gravity, which makes the fluid more effective in transport and less dependent on pressure. LPG has many advantages; however, it is a new technique, which needs further research. Liquefied petroleum gas fracturing was developed by a GasFrac energy company, based in Calgary, Alberta. The Chief Technology Officer of the GasFrac company said that it is being used since 2008 in gas wells of Canada in Alberta, British Columbia, New Brunswick, Texas, Pennsylvania, Colorado, Oklahoma and New Mexico.

The Republic of Kazakhstan has the potential to generate 10 times as much power as it currently needs from wind energy alone. But renewable energy accounts for just 0.6 percent of all power installations. Of that, 95 percent comes from small hydropower projects. The main barriers to investment in renewable energy are relatively high financing costs and an absence of uniform feed-in tariffs for electricity from renewable sources. The amount and duration of renewable energy feed-in tariffs are separately evaluated for each project, based on feasibility studies and project-specific generation costs. Power from wind, solar, biomass and water up to 35 MW, plus geothermal sources, are eligible for the tariff and transmission companies are required to purchase the energy of renewable energy producers. An amendment that introduces and clarifies technology-specific tariffs is now being prepared. It is expected to be adopted by Parliament by the end of 2014. In addition, the World Bank's Ease of Doing Business indicator shows the country to be relatively investor-friendly, ranking it in 10th position for investor protection. Kazakhstan is a party to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (1995) and ratified the Kyoto Protocol in 2009. Kazakhstan has committed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Having more renewable energy in the energy balance of Kazakhstan is one of the most effective mechanisms to reduce harmful effects of the energy sector and to diversify the national power generation capacity. To help Kazakhstan meet its goals for renewable energy generation, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) is launching the Kazakhstan Renewable Energy Financing Facility (KazREFF). The KazREFF aims to provide development support and debt finance to renewable energy projects which meet required commercial, technical and environmental criteria. Renewable energy technologies supported will include solar, wind, small hydropower, geothermal, biomass, and biogas. The Facility comprises an amount of up to €50 million for financing projects together with up to €20 million of concessional finance from Clean Technology Fund (CTF), and the technical assistance funded by the Japanese government through the Japan-EBRD Cooperation Fund (JECF). In 2019, Kazakhstan launched 21 renewable energy facilities. The amount of green energy doubled over three years. In 2017, stations with renewable energy sources generated more than one billion kWh. In 2019, this indicator grew to nearly 2.5 billion kWh. As of 2020, there are 97 operating renewable energy facilities in Kazakhstan with over half of the renewable power generated by solar power plants. Current status In 2013, the Government of Kazakhstan adopted a new law, On Supporting the Use of Renewable Energy Sources. This promotes technology- specific feed-in tariffs for selected renewable energy technologies, such as biomass, solar, wind, geothermal and hydropower, up to 35 MW. The cost of the programme is estimated at KZT 1,100 billion (c. €5.3 billion). A plan to develop alternative and renewable energy in Kazakhstan for 2013-2020 was adopted by the Government in 2013. The plan aims to install about 1040 MW renewable energy capacity by 2020, including 793 MW from wind, 170 MW from hydro and 4 MW from solar sources. The cost of the plan is estimated at KZT 317.05 billion (c. €1.25 billion). Also in 2013, the Government of Kazakhstan adopted the Energy Efficiency 2020 programme, which plans to reduce energy consumption by 10 percent annually until 2015. A long-term strategy for Kazakhstan (until 2050) was also adopted in 2012. The strategy sets an ambitious goal of generating 50 percent of all power from alternative energy sources, including renewable sources. There are more incentives for investment in renewable energy. On November 22, 2012 Astana was chosen by the International Exhibitions Bureau (BIE) as the venue to host EXPO-2017, which focused on future energy issues. The theme of Future Energy is aimed to concentrate on both the future of energy but also on the potential energies of the future. Kazakhstan is very aware that the time has come for the world to move from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources. The selection of Astana to serve as host city is especially notable, because EXPO-2017 was the first time that a major international exhibition of this kind was held in a country from the former Soviet Union. More than 100 countries and 10 international organizations participated. The exhibition gathered and demonstrated best global developments in the field of energy conservation, as well as latest technology achievements in solar, wind and water energies. Moreover, the energy for the exhibition itself was obtained from renewable energy sources produced domestically. Hydropower High potential regions for Hydropower plants Small hydropower plants are the most rapidly developing areas of use of renewable energy in the country. Thus, in the period from 2007 to 2010 the Almaty region introduced five small hydropower plants with a total installed capacity of 20 MW. One of the important areas of energy efficiency of Kazakhstan's economy is construction of hydroelectric power plants on small rivers operating without retaining dams. Hydropower accounts for approximately 13% percent of Kazakhstan's total generating capacity delivering around 7.78TWh from 15 large (450 MW)hydropower station with a total capacity of 2.248GW. Large hydropower plants comprise the Bukhtyrma (750 MW), Shulbinsk (702MW) and Ust-Kamenogorsk (315 MW) plants on the Irtysh River, the Kapshagai (364 MW) plant on the Ili River, the Moinak (300 MW) plant on the Charyn Rriver and the Shardarinskaya (104MW) plant on the Syrdarya River. Small (1–10 MW) and medium-scale (10–50 MW) hydropower projects have become more popular because of their low cost, reliability and apparent environmental friendliness. There are seven small hydropower plants (<10 MW), with a total installed capacity of 78 MW and an estimated potential of 13 TWh, spanning east and south Kazakhstan, Zhambyl and Almaty provinces. According to the experts, provided the smaller hydropower stations are installed about 8 billion kWh can produced per year and this is more than enough to meet the demand that is now satisfied through imports from Central Asia. In December 2011 the Moynak hydropower plant (300 MW) was put into operation within the realization of the State Program for Rapid Industrial-innovative Development. A number of the projects to build smaller hydropower plants are being implemented in southern Kazakhstan. Solar energy High potential regions for Solarpower plants Kazakhstan has areas with high insolation that could be suitable for solar power, particularly in the south of the country, receiving between 2200 and 3000h of sunlight per year, which equals 1200–1700 kW/m2 annually. Both concentrated solar thermal and solar photovoltaic (PV) have potential. There is a 2 MW solar PV plant near Almaty and six solar PV plants are currently under construction in the Zhambyl province of southern Kazakhstan with a combined capacity of 300 MW. In addition to solar PV, concentrated solar thermal is advantageous given it does not require water for operation so can be used in desert and semi-desert areas, the materials (steel, glass,and concrete) are domestically produced in Kazakhstan and readily available, and solar thermal plants store energy in the form of heat, which is far more efficient than the batteries used in PV systems and allows electricity to be produced on demand, even after the sun has set, enabling both base and peak loads to be met. There are no current plans to install a concentrated solar thermal plant although the government plans to create 1.04GW of renewable energy capacity by 2020. The South-Kazakhstan, Kyzylorda oblast and the Aral region are the most suitable locations to build solar power plants. The most significant project in this field implemented in 2002 in Kazakhstan and financed by the UN was to install 50 prism solar power plants with capacity of 100 liters of water each, and 50 solar stills, using the water from the Syr Darya river to provide the residents of two villages in the Aral region for drinking water and heating. In particular, according to the Plan of Activities for Alternative and Renewable Energy in Kazakhstan, it is planned to put into operation about 28 solar energy projects until the end of 2020 with total installed capacity of 713.5 MW. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) financed two solar parks in Kazakhstan. The first one, 50 MW Burnoye Solar 1, was established in April 2014. The second one, known as Burnoye Solar 2, is also 50 MW and will be located in the Zhambyl region. Wind energy High potential regions for Windpower plants Kazakhstan's steppe geography makes it suitable for wind energy applications and the estimated potential of wind energy that can be economically developed is about 760GW. About 50% of Kazakhstan's territory has average wind speeds suitable for energy generation (4–6 m/s) with the strongest potential in the Caspian Sea, central and northern regions. The most promising individual sites are in the Almaty region in the Dzungar (Dzungarian) Gates, 600 km northeast of Almaty close to the Xinjiang border and the Chylyk Corridor 100 km east of Almaty. Wind potentials of 525Wm2 in the Dzungar Gates and 240Wm2 in the Chylyk corridor have been estimated with power production from wind turbines potentially achieving 4400 kW/h/MW and 3200 kW/h/MW respectively. Currently, the Ministry of Industry and New Technologies selected 10 sites to build large wind power plants (WPP) with total capacity of 1,000 MW with a view to commercial production of electricity in the amount of 2-3 billion kWh. Currently only one wind energy plant is operating in Kazakhstan; the Kordai wind power plant with 1500 kW capacity was launched in December 2011 in Zhambyl region. One of Kazakhstan's power companies, Samruk-Energy JSC, was recently awarded a $94 million loan from the Eurasian Development Bank to build Kazakhstan's largest wind farm. The project will produce 172 million kilowatt/hours of electrical energy per year, save more than 60 million tons of coal, and reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. The first wind generator production plant in the post-Soviet region is set to be constructed in Kazakhstan's Aktobe. This project, with a cost of 84 million euros (US$95.3 million), is expected to create 500 jobs. Bioenergy Kazakhstan has 76.5 Mha agricultural land, 10 Mha forest and 185 Mha steppe grasslands providing abundant biomass wastes and residues which have the potential to generate arrange of bioenergy services. Kazakhstan produces and exports crops such as wheat (winter and spring), rye (winter), maize (for grain), barley (winter and spring), oats, millet, buckwheat, rice and pulses, with an average grain yield of 17.5–20 Mt, which equates to roughly 12–14Mt of biomass wastes. Biomass wastes are currently poorly exploited and only ~10% of the total volume of the residues issued, mostly as a feed additive for livestock; the proportion of rural households using biomass cook stoves for cooking and heating is currently unknown. Organic wastes are also a potential source of energy and at least 400,000 households are known to keep cattle, horses and sheep. It has been estimated that electricity generation potential in Kazakhstan from biomass is 35 billion kWh per year and heat generation potential is 44 million Gcal per year. Various external funding agencies(UNDP, GEF, HIVOS Foundation) have supported the development of biogas initiatives including the Biogas Training Centre at the Eco-museum in Karanga (2002–2003) and the ‘Azure Flame’ Central Kazakhstan Biogas Education Centre (2004–2005) however despite this promotion there is only one large scale biogas unit currently in operation in the country which is a 360 kWe biogas plant run at Vostok village in the Kostanai region. The Vostok biogas unit consists of two 2400 m3 digesters operating with a feedstock of 40 t/day of cow, sheep and camel manure, grain residues and 1t/day of slaughterhouse waste. The plant was installed in 2011 by Karaman-K Ltd. and Zorg Biogas with an aim of delivering 3 million kWh of electricity annually. Another potential area is the use of biogas, which is produced from the waste of farms and poultry factories. Kazakhstan has a significant number of livestock and poultry. Methane production potential of the waste in cattle is more than 85 thousand tons. Potential methane production from waste-water communal services is about 3 million tonnes. Barriers to renewable energy In spite of considerable renewable energy potential there are still significant barriers to address including: low electricity tariffs; transmission losses and inefficient technologies; weak regulatory and legal frameworks to stimulate the use of renewable energy in the electricity sector; persistent governmental body reforms; inadequate levels and quality of scientific support; awareness and information barriers; and a high-risk business environment. Obstacles to renewable energy promotion in Kazakhstan are similar to the ones that are persisting in Russia.Indra Overland, ‘The Siberian Curse: A Blessing in Disguise for Renewable Energy?’, Sibirica Journal of Siberian Studies, Vol. 9, No. 2, pp. 1-20. https://www.researchgate.net/publication/263524693 Renewable energy projects In 2016, Kazakhstan's capital Astana started testing and implementing energy-saving systems in construction. Thus, the Kazakhstan Centre for Modernisation and Development of Housing and Communal Services moved to a new building equipped with energy-saving wind and solar energy systems. Kazakhstan encourages SME's to develop and implement green energy projects. To that end, Kazakhstan's DAMU Entrepreneurship Development Fund (DAMU) and European Investment Bank (EIB) has signed two contracts to finance SMEs working to mitigate climate change and protect the environment. The EIB agreed to provide €200 million (£169.04m) of funding to support small sustainable projects in Kazakhstan. The Energy Ministry of Kazakhstan announced 2017 to be the \\"Green Energy\\" year with 37 new projects aimed at attracting investment in the renewable energy projects throughout the country. One of Kazakhstan's primary goals in its transition to green economy set by President Nazarbayev is to achieve 50% of total electricity to be generated by renewable sources by 2050. As of mid-2017, there were 50 enterprises operating in Kazakhstan that produced energy from renewable sources with a total capacity of 300 megawatts. One of the biggest renewable energy projects in the country is the EBRD's €500 million Kazakhstan Renewables Framework, established in 2016. The Framework's goal is to help the country respond to the challenges of climate change, increase investments in renewables, provide technical assistance and build institutional capacity. Green finance Kazakhstan's goal to achieve the 50% share of alternative and renewable energy in all energy production by 2050 requires significant resources and investments. To that end, Kazakhstan's AIFC launched the Green Finance Centre to develop and promote green finance in the country. Some of the key activities of the AIFC Green Finance Centre include developing green finance instruments and facilitating their introduction, supporting projects, providing training and certification of green finance specialists, etc. Kazakhstan's first-ever green bonds were issued on the Astana International Exchange (AIX) by the Damu Entrepreneurship Development Fund (Damu Fund) in partnership with the United Nations Development Program (UNDP). The green bonds were listed in the amount of $478,469 with the goal of reducing investment risks in the country's renewable energy.

The main town and council seat was Eudunda. The council was proclaimed on 15 August 1878, comprising the cadastral Hundred of Neales. The first meeting was held at the Eudunda Hotel on 29 August. It was initially divided into four wards: Dutton, Eudunda, North and South. Ratepayers in the Hundred of Brownlow in the District Council of Morgan had advocated to be included in the Neales council from the early 1890s, and this was successful on 30 July 1904, when it was severed from Morgan and attached to the District Council of Neales as its new fifth ward. The early business of the council has been described as an \\"almost entire preoccupation with clearing land\\". It initially rented the \\"White Iron House\\", owned by J. Hannon, for use as a council office, and from 1886 rented a room in the Eudunda Hotel. In 1916, the council purchased the Century Hall at Eudunda from the Eudunda Unterhaltungs Club, renaming it the District Hall; they were based out of the hall for the remainder of their existence. It was renovated and extended in 1925 at a cost of more than £2,000. In 1923, it had an area of 100 square miles, with a population of 1,950, including 485 ratepayers. The capital value of ratable property in the district in that year was £363,560. The revenue of the council in 1924 was £3,100, having increased from £1,090 in 1894. It ceased to exist on 12 May 1932 when, as part of broad local government amalgamations in South Australia, it merged with the District Council of Julia to form the District Council of Eudunda.

The story concerns the schemes of the orphan Jabez North to acquire an aristocratic fortune, and the efforts of Richard Marwood, aided by his friends, to prove his innocence in the murder of his uncle. Portraying many themes associated with the sensation novel — including violence, potential bigamy and the lunatic asylum — it has also been hailed as the first British detective novel; plot devices and elements such as the detective's use of boy assistants, the planting of evidence on a corpse, and the use of disguise to fool the criminal, were later used by this school of fiction in the twentieth century. Initially selling poorly, Braddon condensed and revised Three Times Dead on the advice of the London publisher John Maxwell; re-issued under its current title, the novel achieved greater success — it was serialized in 1864 and then reprinted several times in the following years.  Synopsis  Richard Marwood returns to the home of his mother, Agnes, in Slopperton after an absence of seven years. His uncle, Montague Harding, having recently returned from the East Indies after amassing a large fortune, is also staying there. After a brief reconciliation, Richard leaves swiftly on the encouragement of Montague, who promises him help in turning around his hitherto dissolute lifestyle; on his train journey away from the town, however, he is apprehended by two detectives, Mr. Jinks and the mute Joseph Peters, who charge him with the murder of his uncle on the night of his departure. Peters comes to suspect that Richard is innocent of the murder, and in the trial that follows manages to arrange that he plead insane; subsequently, Richard is interred in a lunatic asylum. Meanwhile, the orphaned schoolmaster Jabez North kills a child under his care after he threatens to reveal Jabez's suspicious activity on the night of the murder. Later encountering his twin brother, on his deathbed in a derelict neighborhood of Slopperton, he switches places with the dying man; after finding a body on the heath, the police declare Jabez North to have committed suicide. In Paris, the Spanish heiress Valerie de Cevennes is discovered by Jabez (now under the name of Raymond de Marolles) in a secret marriage with an opera singer, Gaston de Lancy. With the assistance of the fortune-teller and chemist Laurent Blurosset and a mimic, Raymond manipulates Valerie into believing that Gaston has been unfaithful to her, and she poisons him for betraying her trust. In the aftermath of the poisoning, Raymond blackmails Valerie into marrying him. Eight years later, Richard's confinement is interrupted by the arrival of Joseph Peters' son, Sloshy. (The child is in fact the offspring of Jabez, left to die by its mother when he abandoned her.) Together with Augustus Darley, a friend of Richard's, the pair effect an escape for the prisoner. Subsequently, Richard travels to London and rejoins his former compatriots, the 'Cherokees'; they are later joined by Joseph and the housemaid Kuppins, with whom the detective has brought up Sloshy. The group resolve to vindicate Richard's innocence in the murder of his uncle and to find the guilty person. Meanwhile, Raymond (now the Count de Marolles) has established a household in London with Valerie, now his wife, and her son from her former relationship with Gaston. Richard and Joseph Peters make headway in confirming that Jabez and Raymond are the same person. Meanwhile, Raymond discovers that the Marquis de Cevennes, Valerie's uncle, is actually his father. Valerie uncovers Raymond's plot, including the use of the mimic to trick her; when she confronts Laurent, however, he reveals that she did not in fact poison Gaston but merely drugged him—after the incident he fled Paris for a military life in India, and goes under the name of Captain Lansdown. Valerie calls her uncle, the Marquis, to London; his paternal connection to Raymond is revealed when the pair confront one another, but the meeting is interrupted by an attempt to apprehend the latter (the evidence of his involvement in the murder having grown in the meantime). Raymond manages to escape them and flees London. Joseph and Augustus gather more evidence from Slopperton, and visit the house where the murder took place (now vacated by Agnes). The group suspect that Raymond will be on board a ship bound for New York; they eventually find him inside a coffin due to be taken aboard, and he is apprehended. In the subsequent trial, Raymond is found guilty of Montague's murder and sentenced to be hanged; he kills himself before the sentence is carried out. Valerie again marries Gaston, now Captain Lansdown, whilst Richard marries Augustus' sister, Isabella, who supported him during the efforts to prove his innocence; the two couples travel to South America to start new lives there.

Composition  Braddon wrote about the composition and publication history of the novel in an essay that first appeared in 1893, entitled 'My First Novel: The Trail of the Serpent'.  Reception  The Sporting Gazette remarked on the release of an 1866 edition of the novel by Ward, Lock, & Tyler: > Admirers of the highly wrought \\"sensational\\" school of novels, will find > ample gratification in \\"The Trail of the Serpent,\\" while the republication > of this first essay is especially interesting as enabling readers of Miss > Braddon's later novels to judge how much she has profited by time, study, > and observation, and to note the progressive improvement in style and > artistic construction so apparent in her more matured works.

It was the first sinking of a Royal Navy ship in four decades. Early life He was born in Villa Maza, but moved to Macachín, La Pampa Province when he was a child. He lived and studied there until the secondary school. Then he moved to the city of Buenos Aires. Currently, he is living there but visiting Macachín frequently, because he has a country farm and friends in this town.

Bedacarratz and Lieutenant Armando Mayora were the two pilots on duty in the Search and Attack Naval Squadron, and were ordered to take off. Neither pilot had fired an Exocet missile before. The two Super Etendard planes detected Sheffield, out of sight, from 20 miles away. Four seconds after Bedacarratz pressed the release button, the Exocet left his aircraft. Lieutenant Mayora, after seeing the Exocet launch, fired his own Exocet. Afterward, both aircraft turned home for their base, but flew at 15 metres above the sea in the direction of the Antarctic, to confuse the Royal Navy. Sheffield was with and . The two approaching aircraft had been picked up by Glasgow; Sheffield was twenty miles away at the time and its operations room was not fully manned so that not everything Glasgow sent was received by Sheffield. At the time, Sheffield was sending a message back to Britain via satellite, meaning that it could not see anything on its radar. There were 281 on board, and 20 sailors were killed, with 26 injured. Bedacarratz retired in 1991, with over 3,500 military flying hours and 200 carrier landings. Personal life He has two daughters, a son and three granddaughters.

Early life Born in the 1370s, his family may have been connected with the village of Great Stukeley in Huntingdonshire. Career He initially appears in the Royal Household of Richard II in 1396 as a king's esquire, paid by a life interest in the manor of Ridgewell in Essex, his only landholding, which yielded him 15 pounds a year. He worked with Roger Walden, the Lord High Treasurer, and his brother, the MP John Walden, on land transactions and was also involved at the Court of Exchequer. In 1397 his fortunes were transformed through marrying a widow who brought him estates in at least six counties yielding an income of over 100 pounds a year. Her lands included Chewton and Trent in Somerset, Merston in Sussex, part of West Kington in Wiltshire; Mapperton in Dorset, Selling in Kent and Glen Magna in Leicestershire. As a considerable and wealthy landowner, from 1398 on he undertook various responsibilities in local government, primarily in Sussex and Somerset or adjoining counties. In Sussex, through the MP Sir William Percy he came under the patronage of the local magnates, the Earls of Arundel, first Richard and then from 1406 Thomas. In 1412 he was Collector of Customs for Chichester as well as escheator for Somerset and Dorset, in 1416 a justice of the peace for Sussex, and in 1418 on the Commission of Array for both Sussex and Surrey, raising troops for the war in France. He was chosen as Member of Parliament for Sussex in 1415, March 1416 and 1417. In 1413 he had been asked to take on the feoffeeship of the West Country estates of William Botreaux, 3rd Baron Botreaux, and he later did a similar service for Thomas Camoys, 1st Baron Camoys. In 1414 his wife died and by a settlement the two had made in 1410 he was able not only to retain her estates for life but also to pass some on to their elder son Roger. This arrangement was challenged by his elder stepson William, who obtained judgements which by 1422 stripped Stucley of all his late wife's lands except possibly for a part of Merston. Though no longer a significant landowner, he was not impoverished and, while no longer seeking public office, his credit was still good for private transactions with noble and gentry associates such as Lord Botreaux, the MP Sir Richard Stafford, and Sir Edward Stradling. He died shortly before 28 November 1441. Marriage and children quartered by the Stucley familyThe Magna Charta Sureties, 1215: The Barons Named in the Magna Charta, 1215 ...

The larval host-plants are various grasses, including Poa annua. The eggs are not stuck to the host plant but fall among the foliage. The first instar caterpillar may aestivate until the autumn, at which time it feeds to some extent before overwintering. It feeds again more vigorously in the spring, before pupating in June. The butterflies are on the wing from early July until mid-August. In summer, they are often observed on flowers. When it is hot they prefer shaded areas under tree canopies or in high grasses and often settle on branches and tree trunks, where they are well-camouflaged.

Once complete, the line will be used by long-distance passenger services and freight. It shall form part of the Rotterdam–Genoa corridor; the tunnel is also part of the Main line for Europe (Magistrale für Europa in German and Magistrale européenne in French; Paris–Budapest). Having been under consideration since the 1970s, and given planning approval during 1996, the tunnel's construction was delayed by decades due to a lack of financing. During 2013, construction finally commenced with the awarding of a contract to Arbeitsgemeinschaft Tunnel Rastatt (\\"Rastatt tunnel construction community\\"). In 2012, it was projected that Rastatt Tunnel should be opened during 2022. Being financed by the German federal government, early projections forecast a total cost of around €693 million. On 12 August 2017, there was a collapse during the construction of the tunnel's eastern bore. This collapse not only affected the tunnel, but also stopped operations on the Rhine Valley Railway, disrupting international rail traffic; the line was not reopened until on 2 October 2017. While construction work on the unaffected western bore was resumed during September 2017, the eastern bore was intentionally sealed with concrete as a measure to stabilise the ground. The project was re-planned to account for the collapse; as of August 2019, the eastern bore is intended to be dug out using traditional cut-and-cover construction methods, while the tunnel's overall completion date has been set back to 2025. The Rhine Valley Railway shall also be relocated during the renewed construction phase to minimise the potential impact of further instability.  Route The will pass under the entire Rastatt urban area, the existing Rhine Valley Railway and the Federbach flats. It is the largest tunnel in terms of cross-section to be built on the high-speed line and begins east of Ötigheim and ends at Niederbühl. The distance between the track- centres of the two single-track tunnels is and they are linked at intervals by cross passages. To the north and south are trough structures with a length of connecting to the rail tracks on the surface. The gradient descends from both portals towards the centre of the tunnel. The two tracks are largely in circular tunnels with an inner radius of in sections with an open design a rectangular cross-section has been chosen with an equivalent cross-sectional area. The planned cover of the tunnels is between . The tunnels will run through sandy-gritty subsoil, mostly under the water table. The tunnel is the centerpiece of a section of new line, which is designed for operations at . The long-distance passenger services and part of the rail freight traffic passing through the corridor are expected to use it. The local geology largely comprises sedimentary rock, while various underground rivers are also present in the vicinity; the Rhine itself is roughly seven kilometres west of Rastatt. It has been observed that there is a high presence of ground water around the tunnel's route, which is particularly concentrated around the sandy sediments found up to 10 metres below surface level.  History  = Planning= Between 1970 and 1983, more than 20 above ground options for section 1, to which the tunnel belongs, were considered. Under planning procedures introduced in 1983, five main above or underground options in the area Rastatt with different design speeds were examined. In its spatial planning assessment, the administration of the Karlsruhe region called on Deutsche Bundesbahn to discard the aboveground options and to provide for a tunnel under Rastatt. As there is mainly rail-freight operating on the line and to achieve permissible noise levels for the local residents and avoid noise mitigation at the vehicles and tracks a tunnel was planned in the sandy plains of the Rhine valley. Also to avoid construction noise a construction in mining technique was foreseen instead of cut and cover what would be much simpler in this environment. The initially planned route of the new line through Durmersheim, Bietigheim and Ötigheim was fought intensely by local residents. Under political pressure, the new route was eventually moved to follow the already planned deviation of federal highway 36. According to Deutsche Bahn (DB), this transfer was possible at no additional cost, taking into account the need to resolve local issues if the previously considered route was chosen. According to DB, the selected tunnel solution is more economical, has greater capacity, would allow more efficient operations and would allow shorter journey times. As a result, the regional planning process was launched in July 1986 with the proposed route following the proposed new federal highway closely and then passing through a tunnel. In the middle of 1987, Deutsche Bundesbahn intended to initiate the planning approval process in late 1987. The B36 bypass was built between 2002 and 2004. The planning process for section 1 was launched on 27 June 1990. Due to the high cost of the tunnel solution, possible savings were investigated in 1991 and 1992, including other routes for the tunnel and a shorter tunnel. The planning approval procedure was completed on 19 March 1996. After several complaints were dismissed, the decision on section 1.2, to which the tunnel belongs, was finalised on 11 August 1998. In the spring of 1997, the Federal Ministry of Transport commissioned Deutsche Bahn to carry out a study comparing an aboveground route with the underground route. The result was verified by the Federal Railway Authority (Eisenbahn-Bundesamt) and notified to the Baden-Württemberg state government in December 1997. The study confirmed that, an aboveground route would have a similar cost as a tunnel, but it would not provide the same increase in capacity. In 2000, the planned tunnel would have had a length of . The northern portal would have been at federal highway 462 and the southern portal would have been near Autobahn 5. (map with status of September 2000) In 2002, the tunnel's planned length was . The northern and southern portals had been moved to the north. (map with status of May 2002) In mid-2010, the length of the tunnel was quoted as . In early 2009, it was intended to revise the planning for the Rastatt Tunnel, which was now over ten years old and to begin construction in early 2011. Both would be financed from funds from the economic stimulus package II. Because of the high financial requirements and the long duration of the project, it was later separated from the stimulus package. In 2011, Deutsche Bahn proposed an amendment to the plan, with among other things, the longitudinal spacing of the cross tunnels reduced from and special construction methods in the portal area to deal with tunnel boom. Among other things, the route of the eastern tunnel was shifted slightly to give a uniform distance of between the airlock doors of the cross tunnels. The amended plans provided for a new safety concept over a length of . The amendment was approved in November 2012. According to a media report the amendments to the plan were necessary because of new safety regulations (as of February 2012). On 24 August 2012, the Federal Ministry of Transport, Building and Urban Development concluded a financing agreement on the northernmost section of the Rhine Valley Railway. It includes a northern section of line, which includes the Rastatt Tunnel. The section is designed for operations at up to . At the end of February 2012, a notice was published on the tendering of the construction contract for zoning section 1, to which the tunnel belongs. The estimated contract value was €808 million. Tendering and contracting were to run from May 2013 to August 2014. = Construction= Already finished subgrade of the approach line in the Durmersheim area in September 2009 North portal of Rastatt Tunnel in March 2016 Assembly of the tunnel boring machine in March 2016 South portal of Rastatt Tunnel in April 2016 During 2001, the construction interval was forecast to take around six years to complete. However, prior to any work commencing, the construction phase of the project was subject to multiple postponements; according to the European Commission, these delays were due to a lack of available funds. On 7 April 2011, fresh exploratory drilling for the tunnel began in the district of Niederbühl. Another exploration program began between Ötigheim and Rastatt Süd on 9 May 2012. Three rigs were due to drive 40 holes to depths of up to by October 2012. Work on the ramp at the northern tunnel portal was tendered in March 2013. On 30 July 2013, the official ground-breaking ceremony was held at the future groundwater basin under Autobahn 5 in Niederbühl. This was to allow construction work to commence between Basheide junction and Rastatt Süd. The work was expected to be completed by 2015. At the end of 2013, work began on the construction of the northern groundwater basin. As part of works worth about €13 million, a and up to excavation pit was established and approximately of material and of sheet piles were installed. The work was expected to be completed by October 2014 (as of late 2013). It was expected that the construction of the actual groundwater basin would begin in early 2015, By the end of March 2014, the earthworks for the northern groundwater basin has been completed. Starting in July 2014, sheet piles were driven into the ground in preparation of further construction activity commencing. The contract for construction of the shell of the tunnel was awarded to Arbeitsgemeinschaft Tunnel Rastatt (\\"Rastatt tunnel construction community\\"), a company founded specifically to undertake this project. The technical leadership was taken by Ed. Züblin AG and the commercial leadership by Hochtief AG. The tunnel contract is worth €312 million; making it the biggest contract of the project in terms of value. On 4 August 2014, the contract for the shell of the tunnel was signed in Berlin. Construction work was expected to start in November 2014 with the preparation of a building site area in Ötigheim. The first tunneling machine was expected to be assembled in April 2015 and the driving of the tunnel was expected to start in October 2015. The completion of the shell was intended to be achieved at the end of the first quarter of 2018. The completion of technical construction is to follow in 2020 and trial operations are scheduled to start in 2022. Due to the geological and hydrological environment of the tunnel, a large part of it is being driven by two tunnel boring machines (TBMs), which travelled its length along the north- to-south alignment. Some of its length was tunnelled through ground that has been stabilised by a combination of ground freezing (using either brine or liquid nitrogen) and concrete injections. Around of the tunnel would be bored, about would be built using the New Austrian Tunnelling method or by cut-and- cover. In early December 2014, Deutsche Bahn provided updated details of the procurement of the two TBMs. The two and machines would be provided by Herrenknecht AG. At the time, the first machine was to be assembled in September 2015 and excavation work was set to commence during December 2015. The assembly of the second machine would begin in early January 2016 and the excavation would begin in April 2016. With a boring shield, each TBM would prepare a usable section of . The contract for the two machines was estimated to be worth €36 million. The structure of the tunnel was still estimated to be completed in the first quarter of 2018. According to an updated schedule of June 2015, the beginning of the tunnel drive had been delayed by three months to the spring of 2016 as the first parts of the tunneling machine would be delivered at the end of 2015. The completion of the tunnel shell is still scheduled for July 2018. From the end of 2015, the first parts of the TBM were delivered at the north portal at Ötigheim and were assembled there in preparation for driving the eastern tube from early February. The first TBM was symbolically launched on 8 December 2015. It was expected to start driving the eastern tunnel at the end of May 2016. A stretch of earthworks with a length of about was completed to the north of the tunnel at the end of 2006 and it has been extended at Ötigheim since early 2013. In April 2016, the construction of the tunnel's connections were put to tender.  August 2017 collapse  Sensors at the tunnel construction site at Niederbühl reported a lowering of the track on the existing line above the tunnel on 12 August 2017 at about 11:00. Signals along the line automatically set to danger, stopping all train traffic. The track had subsided by half a metre () over a section of track that was about long. In this area, the tunnel is covered by of material. Over the length of the bore, the ground was intentionally frozen with cooling liquid to to stabilise it. The bore was intended to run over a length of through completely frozen material, representing an innovation in the use of TBMs. \\\\-- Note: The freezing technology is being used in the construction of the U5 (Berlin U-Bahn). As a result of a water spill, the tunnel was not accessible at first. At the time of the collapse, the breakthrough of the tunnel was believed to be close at hand. Following work to stabilise the area, DB Netze commenced work to plan the line's reopening and resumption of construction. The line was initially expected to remain blocked until 26 August. By 22 August, a closure of the line until 7 October was expected.https://www.bahn.de/p/view/home/info/sonderkommunikation- rastatt.shtml?dbkanal_007=L01_S01_D001_KIN0001_blitzbox- rastatt-2017-08-13_LZ01 During the closure, an emergency bus service was established between Rastatt and Baden-Baden. This service was operated at six- minute intervals from 14 August; passengers were informed to expect extensions of travel time of at least an hour. The residents of four neighbouring houses were asked to leave them on 13 August. In rail freight, DB rail operations worked on alternative concepts that focused on large-scale bypasses and transfers to other modes of transport. A change in the schedule of construction sites was considered. Within the framework of large-scale diversions, the Plochingen–Tübingen and Tübingen–Horb railways were temporarily operated around the clock on working days. The Netzwerk Europäischer Eisenbahnen estimated the revenue loss for freight companies at €12 million per week. Even with all the large-scale diversions, insufficient capacities would be available, since several detours were also blocked. By 15 August 2017, according to DB information, work was already being carried out on the restoration of the line, although the stabilisation of the tunnel still had remaining queries to address. It was anticipated that a section of the eastern tube would be filled with concrete in order to stabilise the ground, allowing the re-opening of the railway line as soon as possible. This process necessitated the abandoning of the existing TBM, which was valued at €18 million, as it would remain in the ground. At the time, the means of addressing the damaged eastern bore of the tunnel, and the project's overall completion, were unclear. On 2 October 2017, the old rail line, which had been rendered unusable for nearly two months due to damage sustained from the collapse, was reopened. DB had constructed a large concrete slab, being 120 metres in length, 15 metres in width and one-metre deep, to effectively act as a bridge for the old ground level railway over the eastern bore; a second slab was built over the western bore as well to avoid any possibility of reoccurrence. A section of the old railway was removed, which included the lifting of the rails, 400 sleepers, overhead line electrification (OLE), and around 2,500 tonnes of ballast, and rebuilt nearby to reposition the line to run through the site of the bores over top of the two concrete slabs. According to industry publication Rail Engineer, the costs associated with both the line's closure and the wider disruption caused to rail customers has been estimated to be as high as €2 billion. Rail freight operators had sought compensation for the impact to their businesses caused by the collapse and subsequent disruption, some companies publicly criticised DB specifically for failing to provide a temporary low-speed diversionary line around the tunnel site and generally for its lack of disaster mitigation planning.  Resumption of work  Initially, tunnelling work on both bores was suspended on 12 August 2017 immediately following the collapse, the focus of work being switched to stabilisation efforts instead. However, being sufficiently confident in the condition of the western bore, boring activity resumed in the western bore during early September 2017. Work on the eastern bore, which had been heavily affected by the collapse, remained suspended indefinitely at this point. A detailed evaluation of ground conditions, which involved a total of 60 bore holes, was conducted to help ascertain responsibility for the tunnel collapse. By early October 2017, proposals had been mooted for the recovery of the TBM's remains, which had been intentionally entombed in concrete, by digging it out of the ground; however, there was no immediate plan of how to resume construction of the eastern bore. By January 2018, such work was still pending and no recovery had taken place. By July 2018, limited activity was happening on the eastern bore, including the creation of an opening to act as an emergency escape and to aid logistics during further construction work. During August 2019, DB Netze announced that construction activity on Rastatt Tunnel would be fully resumed during 2020, and that its completion date was now projected to occur during 2025, three years later than originally planned. As agreed, Arbeitsgemeinschaft Tunnel Rastatt would continue with work to finish the remaining 200 metres of the undamaged western bore, while DB shall reposition a 700-metre section of the old line to follow the course of the completed western bore on the surface, putting it clear of the eastern bore's construction site. After the repositioning, which is anticipated by 2021, the remaining portion of the eastern bore shall be excavated using an open 'cut- and-cover' method after inserting concrete walls to the required depth. Once the tunnel is complete, it shall be back filled and the old line repositioned above the eastern bore. Finishing work, including the construction of several cross passages and the entrance portals, as well as fitting-out, is projected to take until 2024.  Costs In 2012, it was projected that the project would have a total cost of around €693 million, including both the route and the tunnel itself; financing was provided by the German federal government.

It was released by The Leaf Label and Brassland. The album features nine orchestral pieces with a different vocalist on eight of the nine tracks. Background In a departure from the recording techniques normally associated with orchestral music, Bischoff relied heavily on the process of overdubbing in the creation of Composed. Spending a summer travelling by bicycle he recorded \\"each individual musician of the ‘orchestra’ in their own living rooms\\", sometimes leading to \\"one violinist playing one part twenty times...until it was the size of a huge orchestra\\". After recording the instrumental parts, Bischoff then visited each of the guest vocalists to record them, apart from Caetano Veloso and David Byrne, who recorded their own parts at home. The other guest vocalists on the album are Greg Saunier (Deerhoof), Mirah Zeitlyn, Paris Hurley, Nels Cline, Craig Wedren, Carla Bozulich, Zac Pennington (Parenthetical Girls), Soko and Dawn McCarthy (Faun Fables). Critical reception In a 4/5 star review, The Guardian describes Composed album as \\"a collection of lavishly orchestrated pop songs that throb with expressionistic drama, by turns romantic, playful and faintly sinister\\" adding, \\"occasionally Composed sounds indulgent, when Bischoff succumbs to syrupy, symphonic cliche; even so, its ambition and singularity are intoxicating\\".

This technique is employed as accurate indicator of age among wildlife biologists on present and archaeological populations but is increasingly used in forensic anthropology and physical anthropology. Cementochronology is a subdiscipline of the field of study called skeletochronology which is a subdiscipline of the broader field called sclerochronology.  Principle  Cementochronology is based on the assumption that dental cementum deposits reflect an annual rhythm and involves the counting of incremental lines in histological preparations. This incremental structure has been reported in the dental cementum of marine and terrestrial mammals. When viewed under light microscopy, a specific type of cementum (Acellular Extrinsic Fibers Cementum - AEFC) surrounding the root appears as layers of alternating dark and light bands. 500x500px One pair composed of a single light and a single dark line is considered to represent one calendar year and age estimation is calculated by adding the average age of tooth eruption to the line count determined. The age-at-death of an individual is estimated by adding this count to the average age of tooth eruption.  History  Cementochronology was first used in zoology for estimating both age-at-death and season of death. Then, cementochronology has been successfully implemented in bioarchaeology. In an investigation yet based on nonhuman mammalian, Mina and Klevezal established in human teeth the considerable interest for archaeologists, anthropologists, and forensic pathologists.Mina M, Klevezal GA. Autobiographies of animals. Znanie. En. 1970 It took 12 years to reproduce the experiment on other human teeth. Since, this technique has a particular interest for physical and forensic anthropologists because counting cementum deposits would give a direct access to chronological age and some studies performed on cementum have shown a correlation reaching 0.98 between incremental lines in the cementum and known age at death.  Technique  Different protocols are used depending on the field and the period. On present teeth, classical histological methods are often used and require decalcification of the dental tissue and staining protocol for collagen. In archaeology where collagen can be poorly preserved, tooth root is embedded in an epoxy resin and dried in a vacuum chamber. On human teeth, the crown and the upper third of the root are removed. 100-μm, non-decalcified cross sections are prepared from the middle third of the root using a Low Speed Saw fitted with a diamond-coated blade. The polishing of both faces can be performed to remove cutting marks. Each slice is washed and sections are mounted on slides. Observations are conducted using an optical microscope at ×400 magnification. Segments that showed readable cementum layers are captured with a digital camera and readings are performed on selected segments.  Critical evaluation  The destruction of the tooth is the first inconvenient of this technique especially in the fields of archaeology and paleontology where non-invasive techniques are preferred. This technic also suffers from the fact that the physiological and structural biological background of cementum is not well elucidated. The alternating deposits could be regulated under genetic factors but could be influenced by biomechanical and physiological factors in link with nutrition and/or environment. Nonetheless, studies performed on cementum annulation have shown a strong correlation between the deposits the known age-at-death and allow to estimate adult age- at-death with a better precision than classical dental and osseous methods. Cementochronology narrow down the age at death estimations in zoology, bioarchaelogy and forensic sciences.  Cementochronology Research Program  In 2012, bio-archaeologists, forensic anthropologists, and forensic odontologists created the Cementochronology Research Program to provide a platform for researchers interested in the age-at-death estimation through Tooth Cementum Annulation. The Cementochronology working group is assembling and distributing experiences from its members in order to promote the study of cementum annulations, to explore cementum related issues and to improve a standardized protocol.

Born in Rossendale, Kershaw worked part-time for his father. He then moved with his family to Barnoldswick, where he worked as a half-timer in a cotton mill. When he was thirteen, he began working full-time as a weaver, and joined the Barnoldswick Weavers' Association, in which his father was an official. He joined the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB) when he was nineteen, and in 1929 he was sacked for his trade union activity. Initially, he was refused unemployment benefit, but a court determined that his activity was justified, and he was paid the benefit. However, he was unable to find work at the local mills, and instead went to work for a year in the Soviet Union. In 1944, Kershaw began working full-time for the Colne Weavers' Association. He was elected as Assistant Secretary of the association 1945. The association was a member of the Amalgamated Weavers' Association, and Kershaw was elected as its full-time Second Assistant Secretary in 1947, becoming Assistant Secretary in 1960, then General Secretary in September 1968, spending his first month working alongside Lewis Wright.Edwin Hopwood, A History of the Lancashire Cotton Industry and the Amalgamated Weavers' Association, p. 180.

She is a Professor and Joint Head of the Department of Neurodegenerative Diseases at the UCL Institute of Neurology; the founder and Director of the UCL Huntington's Disease Centre; a Principal Investigator at the UK Dementia Research Institute at UCL; and an Honorary Consultant Neurologist at the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, Queen Square, London, where she established the Multidisciplinary Huntington's Disease Clinic. The UCL Huntington’s Disease Centre was officially opened on 1 March 2017 by UCL President and Provost Professor Michael Arthur.  Education and Career  Tabrizi graduated with a first-class degree in biochemistry from Heriot-Watt University in 1986 and an MB ChB from the University of Edinburgh in 1992, where she graduated with the Gold Medal (Ettles Scholar) for the most distinguished medical graduate. She obtained a PhD at University College London in 2000. During her time as a trainee neurologist at the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery (NHNN), Queen Square, Sarah worked for Professors Anita Harding and David Marsden, both of whom would make a lasting impression on her. She undertook an MRC Clinical Training Fellowship PhD studying mitochondrial dysfunction in neurodegeneration with Tony Schapira and Gillian Bates from 1996-1999 then obtained a Department of Health National Clinician Scientist Fellowship at the UCL Institute of Neurology in 2002 to work with John Collinge and Charles Weissmann. She was promoted to UCL Clinical Senior Lecturer and Honorary Consultant Neurologist in 2003, to Reader in 2007 and Full Professor in 2009.  Research  Tabrizi is distinguished for her work on mechanisms of cellular neurodegeneration and in particular Huntington's disease pathobiology, biomarkers, outcome measures and clinical trials. Amongst her achievements, she has identified a key role for the innate immune system in the pathogenesis of Huntington’s disease, published the first assay of the mutant HD protein in human blood cells, and designed and led two major, international, influential research initiatives, TRACK-HD and Track-On HD. To date these studies have yielded fundamental new insights into the preclinical phase of neurodegeneration in Huntington’s disease including identifying predictors of disease onset, progression, evidence of brain compensation and plasticity and neurobiological changes occurring twenty years before predicted disease onset, and her work established a battery of clinical trial outcome measures. Recently her work identified an important new genetic modifier of disease progression in Huntington’s disease, which has opened up new avenues of research into targeting DNA repair pathways as possible therapeutics for Huntington’s disease. Tabrizi gave a keynote presentation at the 2016 Google Zeitgeist Minds conference about the trial, and the prospect of gene silencing for neurodegenerative disease. She was the lead Clinical Investigator for the first clinical trial of a 'gene silencing' or huntingtin-lowering drug in Huntington's disease patients. The announcement of the ‘top line’ results from the Phase 1b/2a safety trial in December 2017 received widespread national and international media coverage and was covered in features by BBC News, Guardian and Nature. In May 2019 the full results were published in The New England Journal of Medicine. In 2017 Tabrizi was the subject of a profile article in The Lancet Neurology. As of November 2019, Tabrizi had authored over 300 publications, with over 22,000 citations for her research.

Founded by the animal photographer Otto Koenig and his wife, the illustrator Lilli Koenig as “Biologische Station Wilhelminenberg” (Biological Station Wilhelminenberg) in 1945, it was later named after the Nobel laureate Konrad Lorenz and incorporated into the University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna in 2011. History and organisation The “Biologische Station Wilheminenberg” was founded by the biologist couple Otto and Lilli Koenig in response to the ground-breaking research in the field of comparative ethology, including the work by Konrad Lorenz. The research institute was established in abandoned army barrackshttp://sciencev2.orf.at/stories/1671239/ in the outskirts of Vienna’s 16th district Ottakring at the onset of the Vienna Woods, and endowed with substantial space and facilities supported by private means. The facility developed and was re-structured into the Institute of Ethology of the Austrian Academy of Sciences in 1967. Otto Koenig, who became a public figure through his role as a presenter of nature documentaries,https://idw- online.de/de/news609724 remained director also after this re-structuring until his retirement in 1984. He was succeeded by the ornithologist Hans Winkler. When Konrad Lorenz died in 1989, the institute was renamed after him. Under the leadership of Hans Winkler, the Konrad Lorenz Institute was gradually modernised and both laboratories and staff were extended. This resulted in substantial refurbishments between 1985 and 2002, when Dustin J. Penn succeeded Winkler as director. In 2011, the Konrad Lorenz Institute joined the University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna and with the Research Institute of Wildlife Ecology formed a new Department. Both research institutes combined now provide a facility for approximately 80 scientists. Director of the Konrad Lorenz Institute is now Leonida Fusani. Since spring 2015, the Konrad Lorenz Institute is also the headquarter of the Austrian Ornithological Centre (AOC).http://www.vetmeduni.ac.at/en/konrad-lorenz-institute-of- ethology/austrian-ornithological-centre-aoc/ Research The scientific work at the Konrad Lorenz Institute traditionally focusses on ethology and evolutionary aspects of animal behaviour, in particular related to sexual selection and sexual conflicts.

The loss of his father at a young age traumatized him. That, coupled with physical ailments, bewildered him. But he also became appreciative of even minor joys and the same continues to this day. His Mother encouraged him and hard work enabled life to get on track again. When it was time to decide the course of his life, he was in no doubt, he wanted to don a white coat. MBBS and MS were a breeze but the real grind started after that. Just when life seemed to be at a dead-end, by a twist of fate, he got admission in MCh in plastic surgery and thus became a certified sculptor of humans. Currently, he is practicing Laser cosmetic surgery at Elina Aesthetic and Laser Clinic in Ludhiana. His wife is an anesthesiologist and they have a son and a daughter.  Education  He did his schooling in KVM School and later joined for the M.B.B.S. course at Dayanand Medical College, Ludhiana. He did M. S. in surgery at the same institution. After working as a surgeon for five years, he did his super- specialization (M. Ch.) in plastic surgery and joined Safdarjang Hospital at New Delhi.

It is a fictional book which is based on the experiences of a plastic surgeon. It describes the journey of the protagonist, Dr Dhruv from the days of his training to his stint in Bollywood where he shapes the movie stars and is full of humour, drama and action. The novel has been published by Srishti publishers and has been received well. Synopsis – Anything to Look Hot Dr Dhruv, a surgeon named after the pole star, is a surprise topper in the entrance test for a degree in plastic surgery. But he is aware that he has to work hard like a husky and brook insults like a donkey for the next two years as a resident doctor. His chief initially mocks at him publicly but Dhruv gradually wins his confidence. Each day of his residency is exciting as he comes face to face with many piquant characters and situations. He also takes fancy to Nandini, a ravishing junior doctor from Assam and has a wobbly romantic journey before ensnaring her in matrimony. However their togetherness is short lived because she has to leave for Assam after selection in the MD course. After passing his exam, he gains a fellowship in a cosmetic surgery hospital in the US where he finds out that humour is a great leveller. After coming back, Dhruv is all set to lead a run of the mill life in his hometown Delhi. His mom reveals a family secret about the unfulfilled wish of his dad who, in his youth, badly wanted to leave Delhi to try out his luck in Hindi film industry but could not do so because of family responsibilities. This sparks Bollywood dreams in him and he takes the train to Mumbai on a mad mission to knife as many stars as possible, in the operation theatre of course. He joins a renowned plastic surgeon Dr Jayaraj where he learns about the special skills required to deal with the film stars and other celebrities who are the major chunk of Dr Jayaraj's clientele. In a surprise turn of events, Dr Jayaraj opts to settle in Dubai. Dhruv reluctantly takes over his practice. His career takes off after he takes up the challenge of radical transformation of looks of a gossip columnist, Chitra, by doing three marathon surgeries. Chitra's relative, Shagun, an aspiring actor, wants her vital statistics to be top heavy. Dhruv fulfills her wish by doing breast implants. Meanwhile, his wife finishes her MD and joins him in Mumbai. Soon they have a daughter. Dhruv has by now made a good name and lot of actors, come to him. On the flip side, he has to handle not only big-headed stars but also fraudulent colleagues who go for his jugular. Shagun also brings along her boyfriend who gives him an offer to be an actor but Dhruv puts it in cold storage. Instead, he plans to orchestrate his dad's entry into showbiz. His father gets a stellar role in a television serial and shifts to Mumbai. There is an exciting interlude in his life, when one of his patients, who is a model, invades his mind space. Just when both of them seem to be going beyond the point of no return, a whistleblower nips the affair in the bud. Dhruv immerses himself in his work as he becomes the demanded one. But ignoring his back pain proves to be his nemesis as it precipitates as disc prolapse. He is advised total bed rest and surgery is not ruled out. An escape route via an acting career is proposed again. However his chief Dr Vidur motivates him to fight back and not to give up plastic surgery. After the period of bed rest his problem subsides to a great extent and he escapes surgical intervention. Meanwhile, to his profound delight, his dad switches to big screen, bagging a lead role. .

Fossil remains were found in Europe and Asia. Description This animal looked not very different from present Chevrotain, but possessed two small horns on the skull. Its size was very small (Lagomeryx means \\"rabbit ruminant\\" in reference to the size). The smallest species, Lagomeryx pumilio, was just as big as a hare. Lagomeryx and his close relatives (such as Ligeromeryx and Stephanocemas) had many primitive features resembling those of moschoid ancestors, such as the presence of two elongated canines in adult males. The cranial appendages were formed by a relatively short pedicle. In smaller species (such as L. pumilio) these horns were very tiny, and did not exceed the height of 1.5 centimeters.

Location The Amanã Sustainable Development Reserve (RDS) covers in the north-central part of Amazonas. It covers parts of the municipalities of Maraã, Codajás, Barcelos and Coari. It partly overlaps with the Jaú National Park to its east. To the north the RDS adjoins the Rio Unini Extractive Reserve. To the west it is bounded by the Japurá River and the Mamirauá Sustainable Development Reserve on the other side of the river. The reserve is in the area of the middle course of the Solimões River, near the point where it is joined by the Japurá River, and is about west of Manaus. It contains Amanã Lake, , the largest lake in the Amazon region. The reserve connects the Mamirauá Sustainable Development Reserve to its south west with the Jaú National Park. The three form one of the largest contiguous areas of protected forest in the world. History The Amanã Sustainable Development Reserve was created by decree 19.021 of 4 August 1998, and is administered by the Mamirauá Institute of Sustainable Development (Instituto de Desenvolvimento Sustentável Mamirauá). The conservation unit is supported by the Amazon Region Protected Areas Program. Jaú National Park was inscribed by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site in 2000. It became part of the Central Amazon Ecological Corridor, established in 2002. In 2003 the property was expanded by the addition of the Anavilhanas National Park, Amanã Sustainable Development Reserve and Mamirauá Sustainable Development Reserve to form the Central Amazon Conservation Complex, a larger World Heritage Site. The park became part of the Lower Rio Negro Mosaic, created in 2010. Environment Vegetation is mostly tall terra firma forest with areas of white water várzea and black water igapó flooded forest, and small areas of white sand forest or campinarana. The reserve experiences seasonal flooding around the perimeter of the Amanã lake, but the flooded forest area is small compared to the areas of terra firma. In the lake region the change in water level is . The reserve is home to various rare or endangered species including the golden-backed uakari (Cacajao melanocephalus), Amazonian manatee (Trichechus inunguis), Amazon river dolphin (Inia geoffrensis), bush dog (Speothos venaticus), short-eared dog (Atelocynus microtis), harpy eagle (Harpia harpyja) and the Arapaima fish. During the dry season the lake is home to relatively large populations of manatee. During the wet season the manatee migrate to várzea regions, mainly to Mamirauá. The undulated tinamou (Crypturellus undulatus)) follows the same pattern of migration. Primates found in the reserve include the mottle-faced tamarin (Saguinus inustus), squirrel monkey (Saimiri sciureus), tufted capuchin (Sapajus apella), white- fronted capuchin (Cebus albifrons), collared titi (Callicebus torquatus), Venezuelan red howler (Alouatta seniculus), golden-backed uakari (Cacajao melanocephalus) and Spix's night monkey (Aotus vociferans). People The reserve was formed after the successful implementation of the Mamirauá Sustainable Development Reserve, and was fully supported by the local people. They already recognized the importance of preserving the vegetation and animals that they depend upon for their livelihood. As of 2011 the reserve had a human population of 3,860 people in 648 households living in 80 locations in the reserve and six locations around the reserve. The people manage the reserve and engage in agriculture, hunting, fishing and logging.

On 29 December 2018, the Australian government announced it had revoked Prakash's Australian citizenship due to his links to terrorism. Although Australia maintains that he retains Fijian citizenship despite being born in Melbourne, in 2019, the Fijian government refused to allow him to go there, insisting he was not and had never been a Fijian citizen.

It was later discovered that Prakash had been wounded in a strike, and then escaped to Syria. Then on 29 July 2016, the United States Central Command said four civilians had been killed in a strike targeting Prakash on 29 April 2016. = Capture = In November 2016, Prakash was captured in Turkey after he tried to cross the Syrian border into Turkey using false documents and a fake name.

The SAFE investor receives the futures shares when a priced round of investment or liquidation event occurs. SAFEs are intended to provide a simpler mechanism for startups to seek initial funding than convertible notes. Mechanics The precise conditions of a SAFE vary. However, the basic mechanics are that the investor provides a certain amount of funding to the company at signing. In return, the investor receives stock in the company at a later date, in connection with specific, contractually-agreed on liquidity events. The primary trigger is generally the sale of preferred shares by the company, typically as part of a future priced fund-raising round. Unlike a straight purchase of equity, shares are not valued at the time the SAFE is signed. Instead, investors and the company negotiate the mechanism by which future shares will be issued, and defer actual valuation. These conditions generally involve a valuation cap for the company and/or a discount to the share valuation at the moment of the trigger event. In this way, the SAFE investor shares in the upside of the company between the time the SAFE is signed (and funding provided) and the trigger event. Unlike a convertible note, a SAFE is not a loan; it is more like a warrant. In particular, there is no interest paid and no maturity date, and therefore SAFEs are not subject to the regulations that debt may be in many jurisdictions. This simplicity is the primary motivation of a SAFE. \\"Safes should work just like convertible notes, but with fewer complications\\", according to startup accelerator Y Combinator. History and criticism Y Combinator released the Simple Agreement for Future Equity (\\"SAFE\\") investment instrument as an alternative to convertible debt in late 2013. This investment vehicle has since become popular in both U.S. and Canada, due to its simplicity and low transaction costs. However, as use has become more prevalent, concerns have emerged as to its possible impact on entrepreneurs, especially where multiple SAFE investment rounds are done prior to a priced equity round, as well as possible dangers for non-accredited crowdfunding investors who might invest in SAFEs of companies that realistically will never obtain VC financing, and therefore never trigger a conversion into equity.

It drains an area of . Sharps Run starts in Evesham Township, and flows eastward into Medford Township. Sharps Run has been defined as a low-gradient stream. In recent years, Sharps Run has improved in water quality.NJ Department of Environmental Protection Water Monitoring and Standards Sharps Run's headwaters lie in Evesham Township, near N. Elmwood Road, and its confluence with Southwest Branch Rancocas Creek is in Medford Township. Sharps Run is generally a slow-flowing river, but has been known to flood and flow rapidly during rain. It drains mostly a suburban/rural area, with plenty of woodlands and agriculture. Freshwater emergent wetlands and freshwater forested wetlands can be found along Sharps Run. Because of marl excavations in the past, there are still some pits that have filled with water and are now wetlands. The elevation ranges from about feet at the start of the river, and at the mouth, though the tributaries have higher elevations near the headwaters. History The name \\"Sharps Run\\" has been attributed to maps as early as the early/mid 19th century. Along the banks of the river was much farmland, as well as marl excavations. Sharps Run marl was used very much in the 19th century, and contributed to the wealth of the farming industry in the area, as the marl was used for fertilizing purposes to give health to the soil. There have not been any major accidents or chemical spills along the river. Conservation The Barton Arboretum is a reserve in Medford Township, near the mouth of Sharps Run, that has protected some of the forests and floodplains along the river, near County Route 541 and Route 70. There are trails along the river here. The riparian buffer zone of Sharps Run, despite recent developments near the river, has remained a healthy size. Water quality Sharps Run has had problems with fecal coliform and pathogens in the past, mostly due to non-point sources such as excessive goose populations and wastes, and agricultural runoff. Sharps Run also has a problem with phosphorus, and this can also be said to have come from non-point sources. There are some farms near the banks of the river, and fertilizers used on these farms run off into the river. Tributaries There are no named tributaries, but Sharps Run has many smaller tributaries throughout its watershed. Along the headwaters of Sharps Run, especially, there are many tributaries.

It was one of eleven black junior colleges founded in the late 1950s at the initiative of the Florida Legislature. Since racial integration in schools was prohibited in the Florida Constitution of 1885 then in effect, the Legislature wished to avoid the integration mandated in the unanimous Brown v. Board of Education Supreme Court decision of 1954 by demonstrating that a \\"separate but equal\\" higher education system existed in Florida for African Americans. The college, which opened without a name other than \\"The Negro Junior College\\", was soon named for Nathan W. Collier and Sara Blocker, two educators whose efforts led to the establishment of the black Florida Normal and Industrial College (today Florida Memorial University) in St. Augustine in 1918.Walter L. Smith, The Magnificent Twelve: Florida's Black Junior Colleges, Winter Park, Florida, FOUR-G Publishers, 1994, , p. 190. It opened its doors in 1960, simultaneously with St. Johns River Junior College (today St. Johns River State College), for white students. The college was jointly supported by Clay, St. Johns, and Putnam Counties;Smith, pp. 185-186. bus transportation was provided by Clay and St. Johns Counties.Smith, p. 194. The college's initial home was an abandoned church building belonging to Shiloh Baptist Church (today the Greater Shilow Missionary Baptist Church) which was across the street from the black Central Academy High School.Smith, p. 191. It moved into its own new building in 1961, located at the west end of Central Academy.Smith, p. 195. The college's only curriculum was college- parallel (preparing for transfer).Smith, p. 201. Collier-Blocker was (with Carver Junior College) the least successful of Florida's twelve black junior colleges, the lowest-enrolled and shortest-lived. Initial enrollment was 59; peak enrollment was 105.Smith, pp. 192 and 194. It had governance problems from the outset, and never achieved even limited autonomy. The disappointing enrollment meant that almost all the faculty were moonlighting high school teachers. Both faculty and students felt the line between the high school and the college was not clear, or that the college resembled the high school too much.Smith, p. 195. There was no money for a guidance center. The initial president was Albert Williams, who was expected to create and open the college within one month of his hiring.Smith, p. 187. He resigned under pressure in 1962; the details are not public.Smith, pp. 197-198. He was replaced on an \\"acting\\" basis by Fred Brooks, principal of the black high school, for which he received a $500 supplement to his $8,000 salary;Smith, pp. 199-200. Brooks felt \\"he was taking on the role of caretaker of a dying institution.\\"Smith, p. 200. The 1964 graduating class was the last; there were 12 graduates.Smith, pp. 206-207. The college was placed under the supervision of St. Johns River Junior College, and the position of president was abolished.Smith, p. 208. The president of St. Johns felt that Collier-Blocker should emphasize vocational and remedial work in the evening, and stated that \\"only 19 of the students...could meet the standards for admission to St. Johns Junior College.\\"Smith, p. 209. It stayed open as the Collier-Blocker Center of St. Johns, until it was closed completely in 1966. Today the building houses the Robert Jenkins, Jr., Middle School.Smith, pp. 194 and 209.

She was the daughter of a Liberal military from Puerto Rico. She carried out propaganda tours and she stayed in Ibero-America for long periods of time. In the twenties, she was an anticlerical activist together with Atala Apodaca, during the Mexican Revolution. She held conferences all over the country aided by revolutionary governments. She actively took part in the second Spanish Republic politics. She was exiled in México. In 1904, she was arrested and convicted in Málaga, for two months and one day of major arrest, because of giving a speech against the Polavieja General at the entrance of the Hotel where she was staying. She criticised the General for the execution of the poet and the hero of the Philippine Independence, José Rizal.  Biography  Belén de Sárraga Hernández was born in Valladolid on 1872, during the Sexenio Democrático. She was Vicente de Sárraga's first-born who was a republican and mason. She was coming from a bourgeois family and she was born two years after the civil marriage of her parent's in 1874. Her mother was Felisa Hernández Urgón, from Valladolid and from humble origins. In 1877, Vicente de Sárraga and Felisa celebrated a new marriage: canonical. Belén and her parents moved to Puerto Rico in 1880 and advised by her grandfather Fernando Ascensión de Sárraga y Aguayo (previous Education Director from San Juan de Puerto Rico School) she studied a teaching degree. She received a cultivated education. According to reliable sources, Belén's father was an arrogant gambler, as well as a conspirator. His personality brought him numerous exiles, accusations and trials. Due to this, Vicente de Sarraga and Felisa split up in 1888, after returning to Spain. One year later, in 1889, Belén's mother died, causing a wave of criticism and leaving Belén and his brother Rafael in the care of their maternal grandmother, Ana Urgón. This woman was described as being illiterate but strong enough to look after her grandchildren. In 1891, Belén's father abandoned them in order to begin a new sentimental relationship and get married again. Belén fought for financial support to her and his brother's maintenance, thereby she introduced herself slowly in the Republican federal circles, where she met her peer Emilio Ferrero Balaguer, a Republican and mason trader. In 1890, she moved with Emilio and her brother Rafael to Barcelona, and in 1890 (1894 according to other sources), Emilio and Belén got married. Belén, following the traditions of the time, added her husband's family name to hers. They had three children: Libertad, Demófilo Dantón and Víctor Volney. Her children's names indicate her left-leaning idealism. Belén admitted that she had found a 'life companion' and doctrine companion, her soul mate and, also, a mentor with whom she could preach her ideas in conferences, meetings, speeches and other functions. Not long after, Belén began to gain recognition in the spheres of oratory and press, after writing numerous articles in Barcelona and Madrid magazines. The fame and acts of Belén Sárraga de Ferrero —as she was known then—, made her rise quickly: She studied and graduated as a doctor at the University of Barcelona. In the university, Belén organized a protest against the removal of Odón de Buen from the professorship. She was also a contributor with the spiritual magazine La Luz del Porvenir de Barcelona. Belén was an enthusiastic reader of works of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, Mikhail Bakunin and Piotr Kropotkin, and proclaimed herself a spiritual daughter of Pi y Margall, Eduardo Benot and Nicolás Estévanez, Olimpia Gouges, Madame de Stäel, George Sand y Louise Miche The fame of Belén remained for fifteen years, but her marriage was in crisis, since the role of Emilio gradually became just \\"the husband of Belén Sárraga\\", which broke down the fraternal, secular and Republican ideal that was beginning to be maintained. It is believed that this generated troubles in the relationship and eventually they split up. In 1911, Belén changed her family name and chose \\"de Sárraga\\" again. Emilio, Demófilo Dantón and Víctor Volney moved to Dayton, Ohio; however, Emilio continued to travel extensively in South America. Demófilo Dantón later acted in films such as Verbena tragica which is housed in the Library of Congress National Film Registry. = Journalism and political and civic activity = In 1895, she founded the Federación de Grupos Femeninos in Valencia. One year later, in Barcelona, she founded the Asociación de Mujeres Librepensadoras, which was forbidden by the governor and that is why she was arrested. Another time in Valencia, she took part in some protests against the monarchy and in favour of Cuban Independence. She was arrested during an independence protest in August. At the end of that year, she became part of the masonic lodge 'Severidad'. Moreover, she also directed the newspaper La Conciencia Libre. = Death = She died of nephritis, old and with financial problems, on 10 September 1950 in Mexico. Her Spanish and Mexican friends kept watch over her body according to masonics rituals and she was later incinerated.  Works  Belén de Sárraga wrote in prose and verse. Some of her libertarian publications are Adelante, El Amigo del Pueblo, El Despertar de los Trabajadores, El Obrero, El Porvenir del Obrero, La Protesta. Nevertheless, she has other works (books and brouchures) such as: * Minucias (Poems) (Málaga, 1902) * Congreso Universal de Librepensadores de Ginebra (Málaga, 1903) * Conferencias sociológicas y de crítica religiosa, dadas en Santiago de Chile en enero y febrero de 1913 (Santiago (Chile), 1913) * A través de un continente.

It is listed by UNESCO since 1979 as a World Heritage Site.  History  The amphitheatre was built around 238 AD in Thysdrus, located in the Roman province of Africa Proconsularis in present-day El Djem, Tunisia. It is one of the best preserved Roman stone ruins in the world, and is unique in Africa. As other amphitheatres in the Roman Empire, it was built for spectator events, and it is one of the biggest amphitheatres in the world. The estimated capacity is 35,000, and the sizes of the big and the small axes are respectively and . The amphitheatre is built of stone blocks, located on a flat ground, and is exceptionally well conserved. The amphitheatre of El Jem is the third amphitheatre built on the same place. The belief is that it was constructed by the local proconsul Gordian, who became the emperor as Gordian III. In the Middle Ages, it served as a fortress, and the population sought shelter here during the attacks of Vandals in 430 and Arabs in 647. In 1695, during the Revolutions of Tunis, Mohamed Bey El Mouradi made an opening in one of the walls to stop the resistance of the followers of his brother Ali Bey al-Muradi who gathered inside the amphitheater. It is believed that the amphiteatre was used as a saltpetre manufacture in the end of the 18th and in the 19th century. Around 1850, the breach in the wall was enlarged by Ahmad I ibn Mustafa to approximately . In the second half of the 19th century, the structure was used for shops, dwellings, and grain storage.  References in popular culture  It was featured in films such as Monty Python's Life of Brian and the television series Long Way Down. American sportswear company Nike used this location in 1996 to shoot a television commercial titled \\"Good vs Evil\\", which depicts a gladiatorial-style soccer game set in a Roman amphitheatre. Football players from around the world, including Eric Cantona, Ronaldo, Paolo Maldini, Luís Figo, Patrick Kluivert and Jorge Campos defend \\"the beautiful game\\" against a team of unsportsmanlike demonic warriors, which ends with Cantona receiving the ball from Ronaldo, pulling up his shirt collar as was his trademark, and delivering the final line, \\"Au Revoir\\", before striking the ball which punches right through the demon goalkeeper. The fourth episode of The Amazing Race 1 concluded at the amphitheatre.

Education Galione was educated at Felsted School in Essex and Trinity College, Cambridge where he was awarded a Bachelor of Arts degree in Natural Sciences (Pharmacology) in 1985 followed by a PhD in 1989 for research on calcium signalling in the blowfly salivary gland supervised by Michael Berridge. Research and career Galione's research investigates calcium signalling. HC Lee established the concept of multiple calcium mobilising messengers which link cell surface stimuli to release of internal calcium stores, while Zhu, Evans and co-workers identified their target two-pore channels (TPCs) and organelles. This has enhanced our understanding of how calcium as a ubiquitous cellular regulator may control a myriad of cellular processes with precision. Galione established that cyclic ADP-ribose regulates calcium-induced calcium release and globalisation of calcium signals, and that Nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP) is a ubiquitous trigger for initiating and co-ordinating calcium signals, often involving communication between organelles at contact sites. By developing novel pharmacological, molecular and physiological approaches, he has demonstrated that these messengers and their targets regulate many fundamental pathophysiological cellular processes as diverse as Ebola virus disease infection, fertilisation and embryology, cardiac contractility, T cell activation and neuronal excitability. The discovery of lysosomes as calcium stores mobilised by NAADP has identified an entirely new signalling role for these organelles in health and disease. Galione served as head of the Department of Pharmacology at the University of Oxford from 2006 until 2015. =Awards and honours= Galione was elected a Fellow of the Academy of Medical Sciences (FMedSci) in 2010 a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 2016.

He was the son of the Cornish writer, Sir Arthur Quiller-Couch of Fowey, Cornwall. He was engaged to the war poet, May Wedderburn Cannan, but he died before they could be married. A book of his letters was published in 2002. The book was also made into a radio play by the BBC. Education He attended Trinity College, Oxford in 1908 where he was captain of his College VIII rowing crew. He won the University Pairs in 1912 and 1913. He also rowed in the final for the Goblets at the Henley Royal Regatta. While he was at Oxford, he joined the Officer Training Corps and joined the Special Reserve. War service His war service started in August 1914 where he served with the Royal Field Artillery at Mons and Aisne. He was involved in the transportation of ammunition to the gun batteries. He saw action at the First Battle of Ypres. He later saw action at Festubert and in May 1915 he was the Orderly Officer responsible for writing the regimental war diary. By 1916 he was on the Somme and in August of that year he was promoted to acting Major. In September 1917, he was wounded during the Third Battle of Ypres. He was later involved at Cambrai, and by January 1918 went on leave back to England. Towards the end of the war, Quiller-Couch led his battery into action at Noyelles. He last saw action in November 1918 before joining the reserve forces at Villers Pol.Winchester college at war Citation Death Quiller-Couch survived the war only to die at Langerwehe, near Düren in Germany, on 6 February 1919 during the Spanish flu pandemic. He was buried at Cologne, Southern Cemetery, in Germany.Find A Grave Memorial# 12748001 Although he died after the end of the war, his name is still recorded on the war memorial at Fowey Church.

It was the largest synagogue in the south of the then Russian Empire. People came from all over the world to hear cantors sing there. History =Early 1800s= In the early 1800s, Jewish immigrants began to stream into Odessa from Europe, many of them came from the town of Brody. In the 1840s, the “Brodsky” Jews leased their first synagogue, at the corner of Pushkin and Postal (now Zhukovsky) streets in a relatively small house from the wealthy Greek businessman Ksenysu. The Cantor was Rabbi Nissan Blumenthal, who had also come from the town of Brody. One of the documents from the Office of Novorossiysk and Bessarabian Governor-General, dated 1852, states: \\"All the educated people of the Jewish community in Odessa are going there. Their school leases a house, but it is deliberately arranged. The hall is quite extensive, there is also a gallery for the women…” =The new synagogue= In 1860, they received permission to begin building a new synagogue. It was designed by the famous architect Joseph N. Kollovich in the Gothic Florentine style, built with local limestone, and completed in 1863. It was the largest synagogue in the south of the then Russian empire. Many famous composers and singers performed in the synagogue. Among them the composer Novakovsky, and Cantor Minkovsky. The synagogue is mentioned in writings of Babel, Sholem Aleichem, and Ivan Bunin (first Russian writer to win the Nobel Prize for Literature). Ze'ev Jabotinsky, and Meir Dizengoff, former Mayor of Tel Aviv, are among the many Jews associated with this synagogue. Odessa at one point boasted the second-largest Jewish population (after Warsaw), according to YIVO. In 1897, Jews made up 34.6% of the city's population. =Synagogue in the Soviet era= In 1920, all the synagogues in Odessa were taken away from the Jewish community. The Brodsky Synagogue was transformed into the “Rosa Luxemburg Workers Club”, as recorded in YIVO archives, which was a meeting place to push socialist propaganda. The Ten Commandments over the synagogue's ark were covered with a photo of Vladimir Lenin. =During WWII= In 1939, the Jewish population had numbered 80,000 to 90,000, but by 1945 only 5,000 remained. During the war, Hitler requested Romanian leader Ion Antonescu to occupy the Ukrainian territory between Dniester and Bug Rivers. In those days, the Odessa State archive was located in the basement of the Uspensky cathedral. The Romanians moved the archive into the Brodsky Synagogue. Today =Local and national landmark= In August 1985, the Odessa Regional Council established the Brodsky Synagogue as a monument of local importance. In June 2006, the Ministry of Culture and Tourism of Ukraine included the building in the State Register of Monuments of Ukraine. Today, the building is on the verge of collapse. It has not been renovated for many years. The walls are being held by the bookshelves inside. =Restoration= As of February 2016, the Brodsky Synagogue has been returned to the Jewish Community of Odessa. The decision was reached by a decisive majority of the regional council who voted to transfer the building taken from its community nearly 100 years ago. The building, once restored, will house the Chabad Lubavitch Congregation and the Odessa Jewish Museum and Tolerance Center.

Format Two three-member teams compete in each episode for a chance to win up to £40,000. The main game consists of four rounds. =Rounds 1 through 3= In each round, the hosts describe a pre-recorded challenge they have undertaken, and both teams predict who won it. The winner of a backstage coin toss chooses first in rounds 1 and 3, and the loser in round 2. Footage of the challenge is then played, and the team with the correct guess chooses two boxes from a group of nine. Each box contains a different number from 1 to 9 and shows a different random picture, such as a tartan pattern, a teapot, or a pair of high-heeled shoes. The numbers in the two chosen boxes are revealed, those boxes are removed from play, and a challenge is then described to both teams. The team that won the prediction chooses one of the two numbers as their target, while the other number is given to their opponents. Both teams then play the challenge separately, the team with the lower target number playing first. If a team succeeds, they carry their number through the rest of the game; if they fail, they are given a zero for the round. Higher numbers increase the difficulty of a challenge, but also add more money to the team's prize pot if they succeed. The Round 1 challenge is for a single player, who then sits out in Round 2 as his/her teammates play together. In Round 3, all three team members participate. =Round 4: The Decider= Each team's initial prize pot is set by arranging their three numbers in descending order (e.g. \\"7-4-8\\" would become £874). The remaining boxes are taken out of play at this point. A challenge is described, and each team secretly selects a target number from 1 to 9. Both teams then play the challenge, with each team member having one turn. Teams alternate turns, starting with the team whose target number is lower; if they are the same, the team with the lower prize pot goes first. If any one player succeeds, the team completes the challenge and their target number is multiplied by £1,000 and added to their pot. (In the previous example, if the team chose 9 as their target and completed the challenge, their pot would become £9,874.) The team with the higher prize pot after this round advances to the final, while their opponents leave with nothing. =Final: Circle of Cash= One player at a time stands at the centre of the Circle of Cash, a large circle of lights traced out on the stage floor. The money is placed on the Circle and begins to orbit the player. Three spots are marked as tunnels, which can randomly allow the money to pass through or reverse its direction; these tunnels are located directly behind the player and to his/her left and right. A buzzer known as the Bang Button is on a pedestal before the player. When pressed, it sends a beam of light directly ahead of the player, out to the edge of the circle. He/she has one chance to press the Bang Button and hit the money with the beam as it passes. The first hit awards the money in the prize pot to the team, and each subsequent hit doubles the total. The movement speed of the money also increases after each hit. After all three players have had their turn, they split the final winnings equally. The maximum potential prize for a single episode is £39,948, obtained by getting 9-8-7 as the target numbers in the first three rounds, winning the Decider with a target of 9, and hitting the money three times in the Circle of Cash. Challenges =Round 1 (1 player)= *Go Slow: The player must walk a balance beam from one end to the other while staying within a zone of green lights that slowly advances across the floor. Higher target numbers reduce the beam width. Falling off the beam or moving outside the zone requires the player to restart. (90 seconds) *Lights Off: The player stands before a semicircle of light-up posts, each with a button mounted on its top end. Enough lights are initially on to match the target number, and others turn on at random. The player turns lights off by pressing their buttons, and must leave as many on as there were lit at the start. (60 seconds) *Putt It: Standing behind a line, the player must putt golf balls into a row of oversized holes. The number of holes is equal to the target number, and the rows for higher numbers are closer to the line. The player must get at least one ball into every hole to win. (90 seconds) =Round 2 (2 players)= *Coin It In: The players stand on opposite sides of a long table divided into zones. Each zone contains a cup and several coins. The players must pick up the coins with one hand each and place them in the cup, and must clear a zone before moving on to the next one. The number of zones in play is equal to the target number; all must be cleared to win. (10 seconds, multiplied by the target number) *In the Loop: The players must manoeuvre a large metal ring along five towers from top to bottom, using wires attached to the outer edge. Higher target numbers reduce the inner diameter of the ring. If the ring touches a tower, the players must restart that one from the top. (60 seconds) *Magnet Track: The players stand on opposite sides of a vertical wall that contains a path outlined in red. One player moves a magnetic disc along the path and must guide it from one end to the other while avoiding the edges. The wall has two sections in which the player moving the disc cannot see the path, but his/her partner can see it and must call out directions to guide the disc through. The size of the disc increases with the target number, and 1 second is lost every time it touches either edge of the path. (90 seconds) *Mind Map: The players are shown a path in which every segment is a different colour and length. They are given a short time to memorise the path, then must build it on the stage floor by connecting a set of pre-arranged posts with coloured bars. The time given to memorise the path decreases for higher target numbers. (90 seconds) =Round 3 (3 players)= *Age Gap: The team is shown a blank grid with pictures of five celebrities along its top edge, and a second grid of 25 two- digit numbers. One player must place a number beneath a picture to match that celebrity's age as the other two call out advice, then press a buzzer to find out if the guess is correct. The team may play the celebrities in any order, and must get all five ages correct to win. Higher target numbers place the buzzer farther from the two grids. (90 seconds) *Escape the Tower: A rack of triangular plaques is set on the floor within a slowly rotating tower. Using tweezers, the players must pick up a plaque and pass it from one to another until they can remove it from the top of the tower. The players may only reach in through three sets of coloured holes, one colour per player. If they drop the plaque, they must get a new one from the rack and restart. Higher target numbers reduce the size of the plaques. (60 seconds) *Turntable: The players stand around the edges of a slowly rotating turntable with one hole in its surface. Each player has a swivel-mounted ramp to use in rolling balls onto the table, attempting to get them into the hole. Higher target numbers reduce the size of the hole. To win, the team must get 10 balls in. (90 seconds) *Untangle: Three coloured ropes are used, with one end tied to a post and each free end attached to a belt worn by a different player. The ropes have been formed into a number of tangles equal to the target number. The players must undo all of the tangles and each press a buzzer corresponding to their rope. (90 seconds) =Decider= *Catch It If You Can: The player stands facing away from a ball held in a clamp at a certain height above the floor. Higher target numbers reduce this height. The player must press a button with both hands to release the ball, then turn around and catch it before it hits the floor. *Clear Run: A dumbbell-like roller rests at the top of a ramp on one end of a long, straight track. Several pegs are inserted into the other end: six white ones, followed by a number of orange ones equal to the target number. The player must press a button next to the ramp to start the roller, then run to the pegs and pull them all out with one hand so that the roller reaches the far end without touching any of them. *Roll with It: The player must roll a ball from one end of a track to the other, without allowing it to fall into any of several holes that open and close in a set pattern. The number of holes that are open at any moment is equal to the target number. *Swing Low: The player must jump up from the floor and completely clear the horizontal bar of a giant trapeze as it swings down toward him/her. Higher target numbers increase the required jump height. The bar is padded and designed to break away from its supports without injuring the player if the jump is unsuccessful.

As a player Doherty was a powerful centre back, who was named Football Association of Ireland (FAI) School's International Player of the Year in 1998. He was transferred from Home Farm Everton to Liverpool FC in the same year and played for the Premier League club's youth and reserve teams, as well as for the Republic of Ireland under-18 team. A broken femur suffered at the end of his first season with Liverpool was the first of several injuries which beset Doherty throughout his playing career. Doherty never played for Liverpool's first team and was released on the expiry of his contract in 2001, joining League of Ireland club Shelbourne. Despite further injury problems, he became an important player for Shels; collecting three Premier Division winner's medals and selection to the 2002–03 Professional Footballers' Association of Ireland (PFAI) Team of the Season. After losing his place in the team during his fourth season at the club, Doherty was put on the transfer list ahead of the 2005 campaign. He joined Waterford United for 2005, then spent 2006 and 2007 with Longford Town and 2008 with Bray Wanderers. In 2009, he returned to Shelbourne, who had been demoted for financial reasons and were languishing in the First Division. After retiring from playing in 2010, Doherty began taking his coaching qualifications and working with youth teams at his first club Home Farm. In 2011, he began coaching Shelbourne's youth team, moving up to work with the adult first team in 2013. After a spell as interim manager during May 2013, he was appointed the club's permanent manager for the 2015 season. Following a lukewarm first season in charge, fan favourite Doherty resigned on 25 June 2016 following a poor run of form for the Reds, culminating in a 2-0 defeat at home to Waterford United. He was replaced four days later by former teammate Owen Heary.  Early life and non-League career  Doherty was born in Artane, Dublin. He attended Scoil Chiaráin, Donnycarney and St. Joseph's Secondary C.B.S., Fairview. From the ages of 6-13, he played his football for the now-defunct St. Martin's Boys Club, who played their home games in Donnycarney Park (known locally as \\"Maypark\\"). At the age of 14, he was approached to join Home Farm, one of the leading schoolboy clubs in the country. Doherty quickly found success by winning the All Ireland Cup in his first season. In 1998, Doherty won the FAI School's International Player of the Year.  Playing career  =Club career= Doherty's play with Home Farm drew the attention of Liverpool FC. It was reported that Doherty's performance in a trial match against Bury caused drooling amongst four of Liverpool's coaches who were in attendance. Liverpool Head of Youth Steve Heighway flew to Dublin to complete the signing on a three-year contract. He went on to play three seasons with Liverpool. In a reserve team match against Wrexham in September 1998 Doherty was named coach Sammy Lee's man of the match, despite Robbie Fowler scoring six goals. In May 1999, Doherty's progress was derailed by a broken femur sustained while playing for Ireland Under-18s against PSV Eindhoven's youth team. Though he recovered, his further career at Liverpool was hampered by the injury. In July 2001, Doherty returned to Irish football signing with Shelbourne, under his former Home Farm manager Dermot Keely. He had been released by Liverpool and chose Shelbourne over competing offers from English clubs Grimsby Town and Crewe Alexandra. Valuing the opportunity to play competitive first-team football, he hoped to learn from experienced teammates Tony McCarthy, Jim Gannon and Peter Hutton. Doherty remained with Shelbourne for four years making more than 70 appearances. During his time at Shelbourne the team won the league championship three times. Doherty's early good form with Shelbourne saw him named League of Ireland Player of the Month in January 2002 and also earned him a call up to the national Under-21 team. But he missed the end of the 2001–02 season with a broken rib sustained in February 2002. He started Shelbourne's qualifying round UEFA Champions League match against Hibernians FC of Malta in July 2002, only to re-injure his ribs and miss the second leg defeat. Doherty was briefly dropped from the team at the beginning of the 2002–03 season, after a poor performance in a 3–0 defeat by Cork City and an on-field argument with Shelbourne's new player-manager Pat Fenlon. He recovered to take his place in the Professional Footballers' Association of Ireland (PFAI) Team of the Season. In the 2003 season it was reported that in-form Doherty had extended his contract with Shelbourne and had bought a new house in Dublin. Two separate calf injuries kept him out for three months in 2004, reducing his role in the squad and leaving him hoping for a \\"cameo\\" in Shelbourne's European campaign. In December 2004 Doherty was transfer listed by the club, with one year of his contract remaining. He rejected an offer from Norwegian Tippeligaen club FK Lyn, while Bohemian and Drogheda United were dissuaded by Shelbourne's demand for a €15,000 transfer fee. Eventually, Doherty was loaned to Waterford United for the 2005 season, where he made 19 appearances. After a change in management, Waterford attempted to return Doherty to Shelbourne in mid-season. But Shelbourne disagreed and a tribunal ruled in their favour. On his return to Shelbourne in January 2006, he was released. Subsequently, he went on to play for Longford Town for two seasons, and then Bray Wanderers for another year. He played for Longford in their 1–0 2007 FAI Cup Final defeat by Cork City. In his last stint as a player, he returned to Shelbourne for the 2009 season, making 16 appearances. Doherty retired from playing in 2010 due to persistent health issues. =International career= In 1998 and 1999 Doherty played for the Republic of Ireland under-18 team, coached by Brian Kerr. A broken leg suffered before the tournament ruled Doherty out of the 1999 UEFA European Under-18 Championship in Sweden. He was replaced in Ireland's squad by Clive Clarke. In January 2002, Don Givens called up Doherty to a training camp for the Republic of Ireland under-21 team at Bisham Abbey. He was hopeful of selection for the Toulon Tournament that May, but suffered a broken rib in February 2002.  Management career  Doherty's first appointment as a coach was with his old Home Farm club, where he coached youth in the Dublin and District Schoolboys League. In 2011, Doherty coached the Shelbourne U-19 team during its inaugural season. In May 2013 Doherty was put in temporary charge of Shelbourne's first team when Alan Mathews resigned. For the remainder of the 2013 Shelbourne season, Doherty was the assistant to incoming manager John McDonnell. At the end of the 2014 campaign, McDonnell left to manage Drogheda United and Doherty was promoted to be Shelbourne's manager. Doherty left his managerial role at Shelbourne in June 2016. He joined Longford Town as a coach in September 2016. He departed the midland's club in May 2017. In December 2017, Doherty was appointed as assistant manager at Drogheda United.

First Sandwich This lugger served between 24 December 1798 and 6 November 1801. She was of 170 tons (bm), and was armed with fourteen 12-pounder carronades. At the time of the signing of the peace treaty with France in October 1801, her commander was Lieutenant W.R. Wallace. Second Sandwich Sandwich served under two contracts. The first contract ran between 16 June 1804 and 10 August 1804. The second contract ran between 6 May 1808 and 6 May 1815. She was of 166 tons (bm), and was armed with twelve 12-pounder carronades. Before the first of these contracts, and then between them, a lugger Sandwich of 165 tons (bm) received three letters of marque. The first letter, dated 7 June 1803, gave the name of her master as John Bateman, Jnr.; it described her as having a crew of 50 men and being armed with fourteen 12-pounder carriage guns. The second letter, dated 3 November 1804, repeats all the details of the first, but gives the size of her complement as 70 men. The third letter, dated 6 May 1806, gives the name of her master as Francis Giffard. This time, her complement was 60 men, and her armament fourteen 6 and 9-pounder guns.Letter of Marque, p.86, - accessed 14 May 2011. On 11 June 1806 Sandwich came under the command of Lieutenant Martin White. On 20 October 1808 was in company with and Sandwich when they discovered the Revenue cutter Active chasing a French privateer. The British were able to capture their quarry, which turned out to be the lugger Point du Jour, of Roscow (Roscoff). She was armed with three guns and carried a crew of 30 men. Captain Thomas Smyth reported that she \\"has cruized successfully against our Trade.\\" On 30 December Sandwich was under the command of Lieutenant Atkins when she encountered a French privateer lugger off the Île de Batz. In the two-hour engagement the privateer repeatedly tried to board Sandwich, but eventually gave up and sailed off. Sandwich had one man killed and seven wounded (two dangerously); Atkins was among the wounded. She then went into Guernsey to refit.Edinburgh Annual Register, Vol. 2, (1809), p.23. The French privateer was , under the command of Antoine-Joseph Preira (aka Balidar). She suffered 15 men killed and 22 seriously wounded. On 5 March 1810 Lieutenant William Edmund Drake assumed command of Sandwich on the Jersey station. On 17 October 1810, captured the French privateer Vengeur, a lugger from Dieppe with 78 men and 16 guns, off Cherbourg. Next, on 6 November, captured the privateer Surcouf, a lugger from Saint-Valéry with 56 men and 14 guns. Revenge, Donegal, and Sandwich shared in the prize money for Vengeur and Surcouf. On 8 February 1811, Sandwich recaptured Sedulous, Wheatley, master, and sent her into Portsmouth. Sedulous had been on her way to London from Malta when a French privateer captured her.Lloyd's List, no. 4536, 12 February 1811, - accessed 5 May 2016. On 15 February 1812 Sandwich recaptured North Star. was in sight. North Star, of St Mary's, Peterson, master, had been off the Eddystone on 13 February when the French privateer Petit Jean, of Dieppe, had captured her. She had sailed from Roscoff on the 9th and had made no captures before she took North Star.Lloyd's List, no. 4641, 21 February 1812, - accessed 5 May 2016. (Petit Jean was a lugger with a complement of 52 men armed with small arms, and 8 guns; would capture her on 28 March, some six weeks later.) On 28 February Sandwich recaptured Petite Famille. On 15 June Sandwich was in company with the hired armed cutter Queen Charlotte when Sandwich captured the French privateer Courageux. Courageux, Jean-Baptiste Sauveur, master, was a privateer from Saint-Malo armed with two guns and carried a crew of 24 men. She was four days out of Brehat and had not captured anything. On 21 July, captured the 113-tonne French lugger Ville de Caen, of sixteen 4- or 6-pounder guns and 75 men, under Jean-Marie Cochet, in a sanguinary engagement that earned her crew the Naval General Service Medal with clasp \\"Sealark 21 July 1812\\". Lieutenant Thomas Warrand, commander of Sealark, reported that Ville de Caen had repulsed the lugger Sandwich some time earlier. Ville de Caen had 15 killed, including her captain, and 16 wounded. Sandwich was based in Guernsey. On 6 May 1813 she recaptured Diane. Later that year Sandwich captured a number of other merchant vessels: Marie Charlotte (29 May), Jeune Victoire (9 June), Adelle (17 July), and Lydia (18 September). Lydia was apparently a privateer and one of the prize money notices for her referenced the \\"peculiar circumstances attending her capture\\". On 1 January 1814 Sandwich arrived at Falmouth. On 27 December 1813, off the coast of France, she had repulsed an attack by two well-armed and well-manned French naval luggers.Lloyd's List, no. 4835, 7 January 1814, - accessed 5 May 2016. In March Drake left Sandwich. On 24 March Sandwich, under the command of Lieutenant Henry Jewry, captured the French sloop Isabella.

Built in 1851 for a ship's captain, its lavish Italianate styling epitomizes the wealth that came to the city in the mid-19th century. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. Description and history The Captain Merritt House is located on the east side of High Street, which runs on the hill above the city's shipyards, and was in the 19th century a fashionable residential area. The house is a two-story wood-frame structure, with a shallow-pitch hip roof and shiplap siding. The building corners are quoined, and the roof is pierced by hip-roof dormers. The main entrance is set at the center of the west-facing front facade, sheltered by a portico supported by paired Doric columns. A polygonal window bay projects above the portico. The south facade has a two-story projecting rectangular bay. The interior retains much of its original period woodwork, the dining room having been remodeled c. 1900 in the Colonial Revival style. The house was built in 1851 for Captain Isaac Merritt, a shipbuilder and owner, whose brother Samuel Merritt, was also a successful businessman. Merritt moved to California in 1880, joining his brother, and the house was sold to William Rogers, another shipbuilder. The house's fine exterior and interior are symbolic of the city's success and significance as a shipbuilding and shipping center in the mid-19th century.

It follows the exploits of a group of pensioners who, having seen their pensions diminished, decide to tour National Trust properties in their caravan and rob nearby banks. It stars Bernard Hill, Virginia McKenna, Simon Callow, Una Stubbs, Alun Armstrong and Phil Davis. The film was produced by Mark Foligno and edited by Dan Lincoln, with cinematography by Adam Lincoln and music by Neil Athale. Plot Law- abiding retired couple, Arthur (Hill) and Martha Goode (McKenna) live a quiet life in suburbia, tending their garden and socialising with friends. The pensions crisis and a steadfast refusal to accept the injustice of old age force Arthur and Martha into a life of crime. Refusing to take the loss of their pensions lying down and to fade away into their declining years, they decide to fight back and take back what was theirs in the first place. They decide to start robbing banks to recover their money. With masks to hide their identities and canvas shopping trolleys to transport their loot, they embark on a whistle-stop tour of countryside bank branches within easy reach of National Trust properties, which they tour in a caravan. The media reports the banks robberies and assumes the heists to be conducted by a young crew of professionals. The notoriety of the Goodes grows as more banks are targeted, including a narrow escape when, after robbing a village bank and hiding their masks, they are invited back into the branch for a cup of tea by bank manager Stephen, played by Richard Cambridge. Soon, their drinking buddies Royston (Callow), Shirley (Stubbs), Brian (Davis), whom they know from their failing bingo and bowls club, managed by Mark Williams, discover their identities and choose to join the gang, enabling more daring heists at High Street bank branch vaults.

Engraving by Ignaz Alberti. The Magic Flute is a celebrated opera composed in 1791 by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. Mozart employed a libretto written by his close colleague Emanuel Schikaneder, the director of the Theater auf der Wieden at which the opera premiered in the same year. (He also played the role of Papageno). Grout and Williams describe the libretto thus: > Schikaneder, a kind of literary magpie, filched characters, scenes, > incidents, and situations from others' plays and novels and with Mozart's > assistance organized them into a libretto that ranges all the way from > buffoonery to high solemnity, from childish faerie to sublime human > aspiration – in short from the circus to the temple, but never neglecting an > opportunity for effective theater along the way.Donald Grout and Hermine > Weigel Williams (2003) A Short History of Opera. New York: Columbia > University Press. Page 327. Extracts on line at Google Books: Sources The sources for the work fall into (at least) four categories: works of literature, earlier productions of Schikaneder's theater company, Freemasonry, and the 18th-century tradition of popular theater in Vienna. =Literary sources= thumb *In work with D. D. Roy Owen, Peter Branscombe notes strong resemblances between the opening scenes of The Magic Flute and episodes of the medieval romance Yvain by Chrétien de Troyes (c. 1177). This work attracted attention in Mozart and Schikaneder's time and appeared in a 1786–7 German translation by K. J. Michaeler, a member of the same Masonic lodge as Mozart. Yvain offers the following possible models: an imperiled hero in a desolate countryside, carrying a bow and rendered unconscious, is rescued by three ladies, who bring him to a high-born mistress who is in need of a hero's services. In another scene of Yvain (which Owen and Branscombe suggest Schikaneder conflated with the first), the hero encounters a sort of wild man in dress so outlandish that he doubts his humanity; like Papageno, this wild man must assure the hero that he is human.D. D. Roy Owen and Branscombe, in Branscombe (1991:7–10) *A major source appears to have been the 1731 novel Life of Sethos by the French author Jean Terrasson. The work appeared in a German translation by Matthias Claudius in 1777–8. Branscombe sees this a possible source for the serpent that appears in the opening scene, for the trials of water and fire, for the words sung by the Two Armed Men, and for the text of Sarastro's hymn \\"O Isis und Osiris.\\" The connection is sufficiently close that Branscombe even suggests that modern directors attempting a new production should consult Sethos carefully for the hints it provides concerning what Mozart and Schikaneder would have wanted in terms of production and stage design.Branscombe (1991:10–18) *The long essay \\"Über die Mysterien der Ägypter\\" (\\"On the mysteries of the Egyptians\\"), published by the Vienna scientist and Freemason Ignaz von Born in the first issue of the Masonic journal Journal für Freymaurer in 1784. This work describes among other things the worship of Isis and Osiris, the gods to whom Sarastro and his priests pray. It also is a possible source for the passages of overt misogyny, discussed below, that often perturb modern readers of Schikaneder's libretto.Branscombe (1991:21–25) 1805 portrait of Christoph Martin Wieland by Ferdinand Carl Christian Jagemann * The series of three books entitled Dschinnestan published by Christoph Martin Wieland in 1786 to 1789 contains a total of 19 fairy tales.

Various of these stories – which were being separately published in Vienna at the time The Magic Flute was being written – are held to have influenced Schikaneder's Magic Flute libretto. **\\"Adis und Dahy\\" contains a model for the character Monostatos; he is a black slave who watches over the heroine and is later punished by his master.Branscombe (1991:26) **\\"Neangir und seine Brüder\\" (\\"Neangir and his brothers\\") provides a model for Tamino's famous aria \\"Dies Bildnis ist bezaubernd schön\\": a hero falls in love with a woman merely by seeing her portrait and sets off to rescue her. As Branscombe notes, this situation is common enough in literature, but \\"Neangir\\" contains many of the actual words used in the text Schikaneder wrote for this aria. **\\"Die klugen Knaben\\" (\\"The clever boys\\") is perhaps the model for the Three Boys. They give wise advice to characters in the story, including a somewhat more verbose version of Schikaneder's \\"Sei standhaft, duldsam, und verschwiegen\\" (\\"Be steadfast, resolute, and discreet\\"). They also descend from the skies \\"on a white shining cloud to prevent a tragic outcome\\", perhaps the model for the Three Boys' interventions to prevent the intended suicides of Pamina and Papageno.Branscombe (1991:27) **\\"Lulu, oder die Zauberflöte\\" (\\"Lulu, or the Magic Flute\\"). Branscombe takes the view that this story provided little more than the title of the opera. =Earlier theatrical productions= The Schikaneder troupe prior to the premiere of The Magic Flute had developed considerable experience with performing fairy tale operas with similar plots, characters, and singers. Two bear a particularly strong relationship to The Magic Flute: *Oberon, a romantic Singspiel in five acts by Friederike Sophie Seyler, premiered in a plagiarized version by Karl Ludwig Giesecke, later the first First Slave in The Magic Flute. Its source is a verse epic of the same title by Wieland.Branscombe (1991:28) *Der Stein der Weisen oder Die Zauberinsel, premiered 1790. This, too, was based on a source in Wieland's Dschinnestan\\". =Freemasonry= A Masonic lodge meeting of Mozart's day, once thought to portray Mozart's own lodge; see Mozart and Freemasonry for discussion. A very long tradition asserts that Freemasonry plays a major role in the content of Schikaneder's libretto.A major reference is Chailley (1972). A review sharply attacking the quality of scholarship in Chailley's book is \\"P. J. B.\\" (1972). Mozart was an active Mason in Vienna, and wrote a substantial quantity of music for his own lodge, including in 1791 (see Mozart and Freemasonry). Schikaneder had been a Mason in Regensburg (1786–7) for a few months before his lodge suspended him.Branscombe (1991:43–44) The simpler accounts of Masonic influence in The Magic Flute assume that Masonry provided a system of values, symbolism, and ritual for the opera, but no part of the narrative. More elaborate accounts suggest that the opera was intended as an allegory with a hidden Masonic agenda. For instance, the evil Queen of the Night is sometimes taken to be an emblem for the empress Maria Theresa, who was hostile to Freemasonry in Austria during her reign (1740–1780). It remains a near-consensus that the opera is in a sense Masonic. However, the Mozart scholar David J. Buch has expressed a contrarian view, suggesting that Masonic interpretations have been oversold. His key point is that careful study of some of the other possible sources, such as those mentioned above, provides alternative origins for elements of the libretto thought to be Masonic. Buch is particularly skeptical of allegorical Masonic interpretations, since libretti with such hidden agendas do not appear to have been commonly created in Mozart and Schickaneder's day.Buch (2004) =Viennese popular theater= The Hanswurst character was a mainstay of the popular theater tradition in Vienna, dating back decades before 1791. This character is earthy, wily, and charming, and Papageno survives in modern times as the best known representative of his type. During the period that the Schikaneder troupe was successfully mounting fairy tale operas, it also produced a series of musical comedies featuring Schikaneder in a Hanswurst-like role. These consisted of Der Dumme Gärtner aus dem Gebirge, oder Die zween Antons (\\"The Foolish Gardener from the Mountains, or The Two Antons\\"), premiered in July 1789, and a series of five sequels.Clive (1993, 136) Mozart himself enjoyed attending these comedies, as a letter to his wife Constanze attests.\\"Yesterday I attended the second part of Una Cosa Rara but it didn't please me as much as the Antons.\\" (“gestern war ich in dem zweÿten theil von der Cosa rara — gefällt mir aber nicht so gut wie die Antons.”). See W. A. Mozart. Briefe und Aufzeichnungen, ed. Wilhelm A. Bauer, Otto Erich Deutsch and Joseph Heinz Eibl, 7 vols. (Kassel, 1962–75), IV, 110 (No. 1129) Viennese popular theater in this tradition often included improvisation, and there is evidence that Schikaneder may have improvised some of his part when he premiered the role of Papageno. For instance, when Mozart played a practical joke on him during his performance of \\"Ein Mädchen oder Weibchen\\", Schikaneder quickly went off- script and turned the joke to his own advantage. Mozart related the story in a letter to his wife: > Today I had such a yen to play the Glockenspiel myself I went on stage. Just > for fun, at the point where Schikaneder has a pause, I played an arpeggio. > He was startled, looked into the wings and saw me. When he had his next > pause I played no arpeggio. This time he stopped and refused to go on. I > guessed what he was thinking and again played a chord. He then struck the > magic bells and said, \\"Shut up!\\" This made everyone laugh.Quoted from the > English translation of Heartz (1990:267), who also provides the original > German. The physical comedy that was an element of Viennese popular theater is called for directly at one point in the libretto. The opening eight bars of orchestral introduction to the duet \\"Pa pa pa\\", at the moment when Papagena is revealed to Papageno as his future wife, includes the stage direction that Papageno and Papagena \\"both engage during the ritornello in comic play.\\"German \\"beide haben unter dem Ritornell komisches Spiel\\". The page on the online NMA edition is . =Mozart's background= The experiences and background of the composer, who liked to have considerable input into the libretto (see The Abduction from the Seraglio for testimony), are also relevant. *Mozart is known to have visited the Temple of Isis at Pompeii in 1769, just a few years after it was unearthed and when Mozart was himself just 13 years old. His visit and the memories of the site are considered to have inspired him 20 years later in his composition of The Magic Flute.The Magic Flute, Matheus Franciscus & Maria Berk, p. 450, Brill, 2004, *The play Thamos, King of Egypt by , with themes similar to those in The Magic Flute, premiered in Vienna in 1774. Between 1773 and 1780, Mozart wrote incidental music, K. 345/336a, for this work. Didactic poetry Nedbal writes, \\"Moral maxims appear frequently in eighteenth-century German drama and contemporary German theorists of theater often discuss them in their treatises. The main function of maxims is to draw a generalized observation from the proceedings on stage in order to promote virtue or condemn vice.\\"See Nedbal (2009:125), who uses this fact as a caution to those who would interpret the didactic passages of The Magic Flute as intended ironically. Cairns attributes a taste for \\"didactic sentiment\\" specifically to the Viennese popular theater.Cairns (2006, 202) Concerning The Magic Flute specifically, Rosen writes that it \\"develops ... a conception of music as a vehicle for simple moral truths.\\"Rosen (1997:319) The opera's didacticism is concentrated in passages of poetry, set in the ensemble scenes, in which the characters cease to converse with each other and join in singing an edifying lesson to the audience. \\"Schnelle Füße, rascher Mut\\", the scene with the magic bells: Pamina, Papageno, and Monostatos among his three slaves. From a production at Texas A&M; University-Commerce One example is found in the first act, just after Monostatos and his slaves dance peaceably off the stage, enchanted by Papageno's magic bells and leaving Pamina and Papageno in freedom.NMA score: The two celebrate their escape by singing the following. {  style=\\"padding-right:2em;\\"  Could but every brave man Find such bells, His enemies would effortlessly disappear; And he would live without them In the best harmony. Only friendship's harmony Can make burdens easier, Without this sympathy There is no happiness on earth. } The second act finale begins with a scene framed by didactic poetry.In the NMA edition the scene begins on p. 267: . First the Three Boys enter, singing: {  style=\\"padding-right:2em;\\"   Soon, to herald the morning, The sun will gleam along its golden path, Soon, superstition will vanish, And the wise man will soon win the victory. O gracious peace, descend hither, Return to the hearts of the people, Then the Earth will become a heavenly kingdom, And mortals like the gods. } \\"Halt ein!\\": the Three Boys restrain Pamina. From a production at Texas A&M; University-Commerce The action then shifts to drama and dialogue: the Three Boys find Pamina in despair in the belief that Tamino has abandoned her, and she nearly commits suicide. The Three Boys succeed in dissuading her, explaining that Tamino truly loves her and indeed is willing to risk death for her. Pamina, once convinced, ardently sings \\"Ich möcht' ihn sehen\\" (\\"I want to see him\\") five times; then after a brief pause the four characters sing: {  style=\\"padding-right:2em;\\"  Two hearts that burn with love Can never be separated by human weakness. The enemy's efforts are lost; The gods themselves protect them. } Rosen suggests that not just the words of these passages, but even the music is didactic: \\"The morality of Die Zauberflöte is sententious, and the music often assumes a squareness rare in Mozart, along with a narrowness of range and an emphasis on a few notes very close together that beautifully illuminate the middle-class philosophy of the text.\\" As an example Rosen cites the music for the passage beginning \\"Könnte jeder brave Mann\\", cited above. The didactic passages in Schikaneder's libretto attracted the admiration of Franz Liszt, who after attending a performance copied down several of them in a personal letter.Letter to Princess Carolyne zu Sayn- Wittgenstein, 23 July 1857. See La Mara (ed.) Franz Liszt's briefe, Volume 4, Breitkopf & Härtel, 1900, p. 380. Viewable on line at Google Books: / Ingmar Bergman in his 1975 film of the opera gave special treatment to the didactic poetry by having his characters hoist \\"a series of placards on which these moral sentiments are carefully lettered.\\"Duncan (2004:239), part of an extended analysis and appreciation of Bergman's filmed version. See Nedbal (2009) for a much less sympathetic view of Bergman's placards. The passage quoted above beginning \\"Zwei Herzen\\" has attracted particular admiration: Heartz called it \\"the loveliest of all the opera's beautiful moments\\";Heartz (2009:283) Abert wrote of \\"a paradisal radiance unique in this work\\".See Abert (1920/2007:1290), who discusses the scene in detail. Liszt quoted Schikaneder's verse in his letter and appended, \\"Amen!\\". Authorship Mainstream scholarship views Schikaneder as the highly probable author. For a marginally-supported alternative candidate, see Karl Ludwig Giesecke. Assessment It is not uncommon for critics to describe the libretto of The Magic Flute as being of dreadful quality. Thus Bauman writes, \\"The libretto has been generally regarded, in Dent's words, as \\"one of the most absurd specimens of that form of literature [i.e. libretti] in which absurdity is regarded as matter of course.\\"Bauman, Thomas (1990) \\"At the north gate: instrumental music in Die Zauberflöte. In Heartz, Daniel (1990) Mozart's operas. Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press. With occasional exceptions, critics voice harsh views on the quality of Schikaneder's German versification as well. Such critics generally do not defend it on its own terms (as if it could stand independently as a work of theater), but rather as a vehicle that served as a great inspiration for Mozart for composition, particularly in its assertion of high ideals and the portrayal of selfless love in the characters of Pamina and Tamino. The harsh assessment is not universal; see for instance the quotation with which this article begins. Johann Wolfgang von Goethe admired the work sufficiently to undertake writing a sequel.

Hartwig became the last Count of Stade belonging to the House of Udonids in 1144 when his brother Rudolf died. He succeeded Adalbero as Archbishop of Bremen in August 1148. He is regarded as the most politically significant Archbishop of Bremen of the 12th century. Hartwig was first canon of Magdeburg Cathedral. In 1143, he became Provost of Bremen Cathedral and was from 1148 until his death, archbishop of the diocese. Hartwig contracted to marry his sister Lutgard of Salzwedel to King Eric III of Denmark in 1143 or 1144. With the death of her elder brother Count Rudolf II of Stade and Freckleben in 1144, who was without heir, Lutgard and her children became the eventual heirs of the County of Stade, since her younger, inheriting brother, Hartwig, was also childless. However, in 1148, Hartwig stipulated with the cathedral chapter his election as Archbishop of Bremen in return for his bequest of the county to the archdiocese on his death, thus disinheriting Lutgard's children. He participated in the Diet of Roncaglia in 1158 in which Emperor Frederick Barbarossa attempted to establish his rights as feudal sovereign, but Hartwig returned home prior to the resulting Italian Campaign by the Emperor. After the death of Rudolf II in 1144, Hartwig transferred his inheritance to the archbishopric of Bremen in return for a regrant of a life interest, presumably to obtain a powerful protector against the aggression of Henry the Lion. The move was ineffective, as Henry took possession of the lands and captured both Hartwig and the archbishop Adelbero, releasing them only after they agreed to recognize his claim. In 1890, the Hartwigstraße in Bremen-Schwachhausen was named after him.  Sources  Krause, Karl Ernst Hermann, Lothar Udo II. und das Stader Grafenhaus. In: Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie.

He was the creator and host of The Joy of Painting, an instructional television program that aired from 1983 to 1994 on PBS in the United States and in Canada, Latin America and Europe. Ross subsequently became widely known via his internet presence. Early life Ross was born in Daytona Beach, Florida, to Jack and Ollie Ross, a carpenter and a waitress respectively, and raised in Orlando, Florida. As an adolescent, Ross cared for injured animals, including armadillos, snakes, alligators and squirrels, one of which was later featured in several episodes of his television show. He had a half-brother, Jim, whom he mentioned in passing on his show. Ross dropped out of high school in the 9th grade. While working as a carpenter with his father, he lost part of his left index finger, which did not affect his ability to later hold a palette while painting. =Military career= In 1961, 18-year-old Ross enlisted in the United States Air Force and was put into service as a medical records technician. He rose to the rank of master sergeant and served as the first sergeant of the clinic at Eielson Air Force Base in Alaska, where he first saw the snow and mountains that later appear as recurring themes in his paintings. He developed his quick painting technique during brief daily work breaks. Having held military positions that required him to act tough and mean, \\"the guy who makes you scrub the latrine, the guy who makes you make your bed, the guy who screams at you for being late to work,\\" Ross decided he wouldn't raise his voice when he left the military. Career as a painter During his 20-year Air Force career, Ross developed an interest in painting after attending an art class at the Anchorage U.S.O. club. He found himself frequently at odds with many of his painting instructors, who were more interested in abstract painting. Ross said, \\"They'd tell you what makes a tree, but they wouldn't tell you how to paint a tree.\\" Ross was working as a part-time bartender when he discovered a TV show called The Magic of Oil Painting, hosted by German painter Bill Alexander. Alexander used a 16th-century painting style called \\"alla prima\\" (Italian for \\"first attempt\\"), widely known as \\"wet-on-wet\\", that allowed him to create a painting within thirty minutes. Ross studied and mastered the technique, began painting and then successfully selling Alaskan landscapes that he would paint on novelty gold-mining pans. Eventually, Ross's income from sales surpassed his military salary. He retired from the Air Force in 1981 as a master sergeant. He returned to Florida, studied painting with Alexander, joined his \\"Alexander Magic Art Supplies Company\\" and became a traveling salesman and tutor. Annette Kowalski, who had attended one of his sessions in Clearwater, Florida, convinced Ross he could succeed on his own. She, along with Ross and his wife, pooled their savings to create his company, which struggled at first. Ross was noted for his permed hair, which he ultimately disliked but kept after he had integrated it into the company logo. The origins of the TV show The Joy of Painting are unclear. It was filmed at the studio of the PBS station WIPB in Muncie, Indiana. The show ran from January 11, 1983 to May 17, 1994, but reruns continue to appear in many broadcast areas and countries, including the non-commercial digital subchannel network Create. In the United Kingdom, the BBC re-ran episodes during the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020 while most viewers were in lockdown at home. During each half-hour segment, Ross would instruct viewers in the quick, wet on wet oil painting technique, painting a scene without sketching it first, but creating the image directly from his imagination, in real time. He explained his limited paint palette, deconstructing the process into simple steps. Art critic Mira Schor compared Ross to Fred Rogers, host of Mister Rogers' Neighborhood, noting that Ross's soft voice and the slow pace of his speech were similar. With help from Annette and Walt Kowalski, Ross used his television show to promote a line of art supplies and class recordings, building what would become a $15million businessBob Ross Inc.which would ultimately expand to include classes taught by other artists trained in his methods. Following Ross's death, ownership of the company was passed to the Kowalskis. Ross also filmed wildlife, squirrels in particular, usually in his garden, and he would often take in injured or abandoned squirrels and other animals. Small animals often appeared on his Joy of Painting canvasses. =Technique= Ross used a wet-on-wet oil painting technique of painting over a thin base layer of wet paint. The painting could progress without first drying. The technique used a limited selection of tools and colors that didn't require a large investments in expensive equipment. Ross frequently recommended odorless paint thinner (odorless mineral spirits) for brush cleaning. Combining the wet painting method with the use of large one- and two-inch brushes, as well as painting knives, allowed the painter to quickly complete a landscape scene. Ross painted three versions of almost every painting featured on his show. The first was painted prior to taping and sat on an easel off-camera during filming, where Ross used it as a reference to create the second copy which viewers actually watched him paint. After filming the episode, he painted a more detailed version for inclusion in his instructional books. The versions were each marked on the side or back of the canvas: \\"Kowalski\\" for the initial version, \\"tv\\" for the version painted during the TV show and \\"book\\" for the book version. =Influences= Ross dedicated the first episode of the second season of The Joy of Painting to Bill Alexander, explaining that \\"years ago, Bill taught me this fantastic [wet-on-wet] technique, and I feel as though he gave me a precious gift, and I'd like to share that gift with you.\\"The Joy of Painting with Bob Ross: Meadow Lake, season 2, episode November 1, 1983 As Ross's popularity grew, his relationship with Alexander became increasingly strained. \\"He betrayed me,\\" Alexander told The New York Times in 1991. \\"I invented 'wet on wet', I trained him, and... he thinks he can do it better.\\"Stanley, A. (December 22, 1991). Bob Ross, the Frugal Gourmet of Painting. New York Times archive, retrieved December 24, 2015. Art historians have pointed out that the \\"wet-on-wet\\" (or alla prima) technique actually originated in Flanders during the 15th century and was used by Frans Hals, Diego Velázquez, Caravaggio, Paul Cézanne, John Singer Sargent and Claude Monet, among many others.Taubes, F. Mastery of Alla Prima Painting. F&W; Pub.(1980), pp. 22-4. .Gury, A. (2009) Alla Prima: A Contemporary Guide to Traditional Direct Painting. Watson-Guptill, p. 16. . =Style= Ross was well-known for phrases he tended to repeat while painting, e.g. \\"let's add some happy little trees\\". In most episodes, Ross would note that he enjoyed cleaning his paint brush. He was fond of drying off a brush dipped in odorless thinner by striking it against the can of thinner, then striking it against a box (on early seasons of the show) and a trash can (on later seasons). Occasionally, he would strike the brush hard on the trash can, saying he \\"hit the bucket\\" and then on the easel. He would smile and often laugh aloud as he said to \\"beat the Devil out of it\\". He also used a lightly sanded palette to avoid reflections from the studio lighting. Ross wore jeans and a button-down shirt, which he believed would be a timeless look, and spoke as if addressing one viewer. When asked about his relaxed and calm approach, he said, \\"I got a letter from somebody here a while back, and they said, 'Bob, everything in your world seems to be happy.' That's for sure. That's why I paint. It's because I can create the kind of world that I want, and I can make this world as happy as I want it. Shoot, if you want bad stuff, watch the news.\\" The landscapes he painted, typically mountains, lakes, snow and log cabin scenes, were inspired by his years in Alaska, where he was stationed for the majority of his Air Force career. He repeatedly said everyone had inherent artistic talent and could become an accomplished artist given time, practice and encouragement. Ross would say, \\"we don't make mistakes; we just have happy accidents.\\" In 2014, the blog FiveThirtyEight analysed 381 episodes in which Ross painted live, concluding that 91% of Ross's paintings contained at least one tree, 44% included clouds, 39% included mountains and 34% included mountain lakes. By his own estimation, Ross completed more than thirty thousand paintings.Rife, Katie (April 16, 2014). \\"Study the happy little numbers with a statistical analysis of Bob Ross's Joy Of Painting\\". The A.V. Club. His work rarely contained human subjects or signs of human life. On rare occasions, he would incorporate a cabin, sometimes with a chimney but without smoke, and possibly unoccupied. Other media appearances Ross was fond of country music and in 1987 was invited on stage by Hank Snow at the Grand Ole Opry in Nashville, Tennessee. The audience gave him a huge ovation; he was slightly nervous at first, but felt better after cracking a joke to the crowd. Snow was later given a private painting lesson by Ross. Ross visited New York City to promote his hardcover book, The Best of the Joy of Painting with Bob Ross,Bob Ross; Annette Kowalski (1989) The Best of the Joy of Painting with Bob Ross, W. Morrow, NY and painting techniques to a studio audience several times. On one visit in 1989, he appeared on The Joan Rivers Show. He returned in 1992 for a live show with hosts Regis Philbin and Kathie Lee Gifford. In 1994, Ross appeared on the Phil Donahue Show and took five audience members on-stage to do a painting. Donahue also did a painting during that episode. In the early 1990s, Ross did several MTV promotional spots that, according to the American City Business Journals, \\"dovetailed perfectly with Generation X's burgeoning obsession with all things ironic and retro\\".Harris, Scott (February 9, 2009) \\"Happy accidents and the legacy of Bob Ross\\". American City Business Journals In 1995, a visibly ill Ross made his final public television appearance as a guest on the pilot episode of the children’s series The Adventures of Elmer and Friends. The series premiered in 1996, one year after Ross's death. The episode included a final message of thanks from Ross to his fans and viewers and a musical tribute. Personal life Ross had one son, Robert Stephen \\"Steve\\" Ross, with his first wife, Vivian Ridge. Steve, also a talented painter, occasionally appeared on The Joy of Painting and became a Ross-certified instructor. Steve appeared on camera in the last episode of Season 1, in which he read a series of general \\"how-to\\" questions sent in by viewers during the season, and Bob answered them one at a time, technique by technique, until he had completed an entire painting. Ross and Ridge's marriage ended in divorce in 1977. Ross and his second wife, Jane, had no children together. In 1992, Jane died of cancer. In 1995, two months before his death, Ross married for a third time, to Lynda Brown. Ross was very secretive about his life and had a great liking for privacy. Some of only a few interviews with his close-knit circle of friends and family can be found in the 2011 PBS documentary Bob Ross: The Happy Painter. Bob Ross Inc. is protective of his intellectual property and his privacy to this day. Death Ross died at the age of 52 on July 4, 1995 due to complications from lymphoma. His remains are interred at Woodlawn Memorial Park in Gotha, Florida under a plaque marked \\"Bob Ross; Television Artist\\". Ross kept his diagnosis a secret from the general public; his lymphoma was not known outside of his circle of family and friends until after his death. Legacy A Bob Ross cosplay at New York Comic Con 2016.

He was spoofed in the YouTube series Epic Rap Battles of History in the episode \\"Bob Ross vs. Pablo Picasso\\". Google celebrated the 70th anniversary of his birth with a Google Doodle on October 29, 2012.

Ross was going to have a video game released on Wii, the Nintendo DS and PC, with development handled by AGFRAG Entertainment Group, although this never came to fruition. Newfound interest in Ross occurred in 2015 as part of the launch of Twitch Creative. Twitch hosted a nine-day marathon of The Joy of Painting beginning on October 29 to commemorate what would have been Ross's 73rd birthday. Twitch reported that 5.6million viewers watched the marathon and, due to its popularity, created a weekly rebroadcast of one season of The Joy of Painting each Monday. A portion of the advertising revenue was promised to charities, including St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. In June 2016, Ross's series Beauty Is Everywhere was added to the Netflix lineup. The 30-minute episodes are taken from seasons 20, 21 and 22 of the original The Joy of Painting series. The newfound interest surprised the Kowalskis, since they were managing Ross's image and The Joy of Painting episodes. They created a YouTube channel for Ross which gained more than a million subscribers within a year. The renewed interest in Ross also led to questions of where his paintings were located, given that more than a thousand works were created for The Joy of Painting. In an investigative report by The New York Times, the Kowalskis affirmed that they still held all of them, though without the proper care generally needed to store art. Prompted by numerous letters from fans of Ross, the Smithsonian American Art Museum contacted the Kowalskis and offered to take a selection of Ross's paintings, along with other items from the show, to place on exhibit at the museum. =ASMR= The Twitch streams created a new interest in Ross and caused his popularity to grow. His videos became popular with devotees of the autonomous sensory meridian response (ASMR). ASMR refers to a euphoric feeling which can be experienced in a variety of ways.

It was a Leninsky Komsomol-class cargo ship, with steam-turbine engines, and was built in accordance with the specifications of Projects 567 and 567K. Construction Its keel was laid on 20 September 1962, the ship was completed in December 1963 and the Bratstvo was delivered to the Black Sea Shipping Company on 29 December of that year. Early voyages Due to the closure of the Suez Canal from June 1967 to summer 1975, the Bratstvo sailed around Africa on her voyages to the Indian Ocean or Far Eastern ports and sailed to Cuba and Syria. The ship sailed from Antwerp on 19 January 1973, bound for North Korea via Las Palmas and around Africa. In 1974 she sailed from the Black Sea to Umm Qasr, Iraq, a voyage which again took her around the Cape of Good Hope. The ship stopped at Cape Town for bunkering. Yom Kippur War The Yom Kippur War, also known as the Ramadan War, October War and the 1973 Arab–Israeli War, was fought by a coalition of Arab states led by Egypt and Syria against Israel from 6 to 25 October 1973. Twenty-three Soviet merchant ships carried military cargo to Syria and Egypt in October and early November of that year. The Bratstvo was one of eight Leninsky Komsomol-class cargo ships which participated in the transport. According to the United States, the Bratstvo visited Syria once—sailing from the Black Sea, passing through the Bosphorus on 18 October and arriving at Latakia on 20 October. The merchant seamen were witnesses to and participants in the war, since the ports were bombed by the Israeli Air Force. When the Bratstvo arrived in Syria on 20 October, she was unloaded despite the air raids. Final voyage The Bratstvo, carrying a bulk shipment of Canadian wheat, sailed from Port-Cartier bound for Odessa in early September 1984. When the ship passed the Strait of Gibraltar, she visited Ceuta for fresh water and bunkering. After fresh water and fuel were supplied to the ship, the Bratstvo left Ceuta for Odessa on 18 September. When the ship passed the port gates, she changed course to 98 degrees and her speed was 14.0 knots. The weather was favorable and the night visibility good, about . =Incident= At 23:33 local time on 18 September, a severe concussion occurred aboard the Bratstvo. According to the memoirs of Captain Vadim Fillipovich Demchenkov, it felt like an explosion across the ship. Within 50 seconds, the ship's engine room was flooded up to the main deck. Although the captain's memoirs indicate his belief that the ship should have sunk within a minute of the disaster, it did not capsize as expected. The engine room was flooded and the turbine generator had stopped, but the emergency diesel generator was started in 20 seconds. This, and the disruption of the ship's internal lighting for only 30–40 seconds, allowed the crew to evacuate. In 10 minutes, the lifeboats were lowered into the water and all crew members escaped. The crew was near the abandoned ship. After a quick SOS signal, other vessels came to the aid of the Bratstvo. The Bulgarian transport ship Pyatiero iz PMS arrived first. Her crew lowered their ship's motor-boat into the water, and its engine stalled; the captain did not take the Soviet seamen aboard until the engine could be started and the Soviet crew was towed to the Bulgarian ship. The Bulgarian crew welcomed each bratooshka.Bratooshka is a diminutive of \\"brother\\" in Bulgarian, and Bulgarians call Soviet seamen and soldiers bratooshki. The Soviet ship Kapitan Medvyedev soon reached the scene and took the Soviet sailors. Although the crew had abandoned the Bratstvo, a lifeboat was moored at the side of the ship to prevent looting. The captain and the chief radioman boarded her periodically to communicate with the shipping company. Her crew found a Spanish tug-boat, which towed the waterlogged ship to the Bay of Gibraltar onto a shallow sand bank. Demchenkov said, \\"Until the Spanish diver emerged from the flooded engine room, showed us pieces of rubber and shouted 'Russian submarine', everyone thought it was an explosion.\\" The hole in the Bratstvo was : above the keel and long. It was later learned that a Soviet submarine accidentally struck the ship with its nose at the end of the third hold, damaging the engine room. =Soviet Navy version= Admiral Arkady Mikhailovsky, commander of the Soviet Navy Northern Fleet and a Hero of the Soviet Union, was called by the Northern Fleet chief of staff and Vice-Admiral Vadim Konstantinovich Korobov on 19 September and informed of the incident. According to the Soviet Navy, the commander of submarine K-53 (the submarine which rammed the Bratstvo) did not report the incident for nine hours. This failure to report led to the first news of the collision arriving from the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which had received the intelligence from the Spanish government; the normal route of information would have been the Ministry of Defence. The central command of the general staff remained uninformed, since no alarm from the submarine had been received. K-53's eventual reporting of the incident evoked the indignation of Defence Minister Dmitry Ustinov and a dressing-down ()\\"Втык\\", which can be translated in English as \\"dressing down\\" or \\"to insert a stick\\", is an obscenity in Soviet military jargon. of Chief Commander and Fleet Admiral Sergey Gorshkov. =Summary= The Bratstvo collided with the Soviet Victor I-class submarine K-53 at the exit of the Strait of Gibraltar in the Alboran Sea on 18 (ship time) or 19 (submarine time) September 1984 and was towed to Algeciras to be scrapped. The incident was described differently by three parties: the crew of the Bratstvo, the crew of K-53 and the Soviet Navy. Until the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the Bratstvo was listed as decommissioned after an explosion due to engine failure. During the early 2000s, declassified information and reports from involved seamen detailed the actual events of September 1984. The Bratstvo was decommissioned in March 1985 and scrapped in Algesiras that year. Crew Anatoliy Matveyevich Romanov, staff master of the Bratstvo, died in 2011. Viktor Snisarenko worked aboard the Bratstvo from 1969 to 1983, rising from junior deck officer to master of the ship. Vladimir Filipovich Demchenkov was the ship's captain in 1984, when the collision occurred.

With the opening of China, it is sometimes encountered in Western and modern Chinese fashion as a sleeveless shirt and backless halter-top blouse. Name In Ancient Chinese, referred to a kind of helmet or hood.. By the time of the development of the dudou, it had taken on extended senses of encasing or enwrapping something as in a hood, scarf, or loose parcel. Dùdōu may thus be understood as Chinese for \\"belly wrap\\" or \\"cover\\",. referring to its early use to flatten the breasts and, within traditional Chinese medicine, to preserve stomach qi. Using the same characters, it is also known as a doudu.. or doudou.. The latter form is diminutive and is particularly used for the dudous worn by Chinese children.. Its various Chinese names are typically left untranslated in English.. In Chinese sources, the dudou is sometimes mistranslated as a \\"bellyband\\",. . . which more commonly refers to a variety of other devices including a horse's harness. and a compression garment used by expectant mothers.. The oddity arises from the similarity of the dudou's purpose (though not construction or appearance) with the Japanese haramaki. In the 19th century, it was translated or glossed as a Chinese \\"stomacher\\" or \\"corset\\". The dudou is also sometimes translated or glossed as an \\"apron\\". or \\"bib\\". owing to its similar appearance. History The dudou's original development is sometimes credited to Yang Yuhuan, the curvy consort of Emperor Xuanzong of the Tang still remembered as one of China's Four Beauties,. at that time, dudou was called hezi (诃子), but the importance of the stomach as the origin of the body's blood and qi in traditional Chinese medicine. has meant that variations of the undershirt are found as early as the Qin's tunic-like xièyī The dudou proper was popularized under the Ming dynasty beginning in the mid-1300s. around the time of the Black Death. Versions of it were worn by female babies in medieval China until age three. The medicinal aspect of the dudou was underscored by its common incorporation of small pockets to hold snatches of ginger, musk, or other herbs intended to boost the stomach's qi. Its red form is also held to ward off evil spirits in Chinese folk religions. The dudou inspired similar fashions elsewhere in East Asia, including the Vietnamese yem and the Japanese haragake. Within China, it has remained a traditional item of Chinese clothing,. particularly in traditional wedding attire.. Generally, however, the dudou fell out of favor towards the end of the Qing as part of the drive to modernize the country, displaced by European-style corsets and bras.. After a decade of public debate, the use of dudous for flattening breasts was formally outlawed, beginning in Guangdong in 1927.. This change in fashion has sometimes been linked to the rise in breast cancer occurring around the same time. Dudous first became an object of Western fashion in the year 2000, when variations of the Chinese design appeared in the spring collections of Versace, Versus,. and Miu Miu.. It has since become a mainstay of some Chinese-influenced fashion designers.. This development inspired some Chinese women, including Zhang Ziyi, to begin wearing the dudou as an article of outerwear,.. although many older Chinese remain (sometimes sternly) disapproving of this development... Design The typical design of a dudou consists of a single rectangular, rhomboidal, diamond-shaped piece of fabric which covers the breasts and belly, tied to the neck and waist with attached strings. It is thus a form of halter top. Richer women use silk yarn or brocade while the poor make do with cotton. Popular colors are red, pink, and green and they are often embroidered with flowers, butterflies, or Mandarin ducks. Formerly popular designs included bats (homophonous with \\"happiness\\" in Chinese), peaches (\\"longevity\\"), guavas (whose many seeds caused it to represent fertility), and virtuous expressions. Under the Ming and Qing, dudous were solely items of underwear and were used to flatten women's breasts, similar to a gentle corset. Wealthier families used bronze, silver, or gold chains instead of silk thread. The first dudous were simple rectangles, but by the Qing they had been turned to form a diamond shape, exposing more of the shoulders. Some variants have a collar which is lowered around the head. Western-influenced dudous may be made of other fabrics, including leather or transparent cloth.

History It appears from the inscription in the temple of the Koteshvar Mahadev at Kodinar that in 1272 (Samvat 1328) this village was under the rule of Visaladeva, the Vaghela king of Anhilwad Patan, the then lord paramount of Gujarat, and that he granted it to a dependent of his named Nana, a Nagar Brahmin, who also held a seventh share in the revenue of Mangrol. There is a paliya (memorial stone) in the grain-yard at Bagasara dated 1392 (Samvat 1448) from which it seems that Pato, son of Samo, was slain in battle at Bagasara in the victorious reign of Mokalasimha, the Chudasama ruler of Junagadh. Later paliyas bear the names of the Sultans of Gujarat Sultanate of Ahmedabad as being lords-paramount here. All these paliyas bear the name Bagasara. Afterwards in 1472 (Samvat 1528), the Bagasra Chovisi was granted in jagir to Bhupatsingh, son of Mandalika III, the last Chudasama ruler of Junagadh. The descendants of this Bhupatsingh, who are called Raizadas, are still living in certain villages near Keshod. It was a subdivision under Sil mahal during British period. Agriculture Thegi or Thek The village lands form part of the huge marsh called the Ghed and are inundated in the rainy season. Kase grass grows spontaneously in the Ghed ; the green grass is cut and given to cattle to eat ; when the grass seeds, the seed or grain is collected and called kasaiya and is eaten by the residents of the Ghed villages. As it is not considered a grain it is eaten by Hindus on fast days. This grass has bulbous roots and the bulbs are black and the size of small potatoes. They are also cut up and the husk removed and then boiled and eaten. These bulbs are called lodh when green and bid when dry. Thegi or Thek, Cyperus jemenicus, a sedge, is also found in the Ghed, and in the, sand hills on tho sea coast. There are thousands of lotus plants in the Ghed. The pods of the lotus are called kumnas and they contain small white seeds which are made into bread and eaten by the poorer classes and also by the rich on fast days. The gram grown in the Ghed is specially famous both for its excellent flavour, and because it is very easily cooked. It is called Ghedia chana or Ghedia gram. Demographics The population of Bagasara consists chiefly of Mers, Ghedia Kolis, Memons, Khojas, Lohanas, Girnar Brahmins, and Sindhis.

Built in 1890, it is the downtown's only example of a 19th-century high rise. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986. Description and history The Doughty Block stands in Augusta's downtown commercial district, on the east side of Water Street, opposite the Key Plaza just north of Front Street. It is a six-story masonry structure, noticeably taller than the other 19th-century buildings lining the east side of Water Street. It is built out of red brick with stone trim. The front facade is three bays wide, with a modern storefront (c. 1970) on the ground floor. The upper levels are divided by stone stringcourses, emphasizing the building horizontally, and its windows are set in round-arch openings, whose voussoirs alternate between stone and brick. It has a project cornice at the top, studded with a combination of Italianate brackets and modillions. The block was built in 1890 for Charles Doughty by Charles Fletcher, a prominent local builder. The building's styling is somewhat retardaire, as the Italianate was out of fashion when it was built. However, the styling of the windows gives it a suggestion of Renaissance style, which was then coming into fashion.

This brought him into direct touch with the Government of India, with whom from that time until his death he did all he could to maintain friendly relations. In 1885 a mission under Sir William Lockhart visited Chitral and was very cordially received, and so too was Colonel Durand, who went there in 1888. By the agreement of 1878 Aman ul-Mulk the Mehtar or Chief of Chitral got an annual subsidy of Rs 12,000 from the ruler of Kashmir. The Mehtar was to present the latter annually three horses, five hawks and five Tezi dogs. Further a treaty was signed between the Amir of Afghanistan and Mortimer Durand that the former would not interfere in Bajaur, Dir, Swat and Chitral. But the disagreements increased after settlement. More than anything else, it was Aman ul-Mulk, sense of his own interests which led him to rely upon Kashmir and the British. Aman ul-Mulk, now secure and strengthened, swiftly eliminated his old rivals south of the Hindu Kush and was able as a result to expand his dominion from Ishkamun in the Gilgit Agency to Asmar in Afghanistan. The two valleys of Chitral, along the perceived border with Afghanistan were unified under Aman ul-Mulk in 1880, with encouragement from Colonel Biddulph.  External pressures  For the first time after the withdrawal of the Gilgit Agency in 1881 the Amir of Afghanistan Abd-ar-Rahman, in a letter, claimed suzerainty over Chitral in 1882, he claimed Chitral in unqualified terms and asked its rule Aman ul-Mulk to acknowledge his suzerainty and declared that the British had no right of interference with the affairs of his Chiefship. The Governor General of India, Lord Ripon could not leave the letter unchallenged. After telegraphic references to London for permission to threaten Abd-ar-Rahman with ‘force of arms if needful’. Ripon warned him, tactfully, whereupon Abd-ar-Rahman promised to desist from interferong in the affairs of Chitral in the future. However, on 14 June 1877, officials of the Amir came to Chitral to arrange for the betrothal of one of the Mehtars daughters to the Amirs eldest son, Sardar Habibullah Khan. And to hussel the Mehtar into concluding the matrimonial alliance. The Amir imposed political and economic pressures. Aman however did not crumble to this pressure and continued to be reluctant to enter into the said marriage alliance without the sanction of the British Government. With the few incidence of turbulence apart Chitral remained relatively undisturbed during this period noting which Churchill wrote, \\"Meanwhile Aman ul-Mulk ruled in Chitral showing great respect for the wishes of the British Government and in the enjoyment of his subsidy and comparative peace\\".  Further events  In October 1889, Colonel Durand arrived in Chitral, the Mehtars reception of his guest was most cordial. During the course of the visit Aman readily agreed to the following depending on receipt of increased subsidy: # His assistance in opening up the Peshawar-Chitral road. # Improving the main path in his country to tracks passable by laden muels. # Fortification of certain selected positions to be afterword's pointed out to him. In 1886, and again in 1888, he sent two of his sons, Afzal ul-Mulk and Nizam ul-Mulk, down to India. They came back much impressed with what they had seen and did all they could to strengthern the alliance of their father with the Great Sircar.  Death  = Expiry = Aman ul-Mulk died very suddenly and all the circumstances of his death indicate that he succumbed in the ordinary course of nature to a sudden attack of illness but it is so unusual in Chitral for a Mehtar to come to come to a peaceful end, that most of the Chitralies believe that he was poisoned. = Gravity = By the time of Aman ul-Mulk's death in 1892, Chitrals primary importance was that it contained the series of valleys stretching from Wakhan to British held India. Fear of this area as an invasion route went back to 1874, amid the claim that Russia could be in British territory within thirteen days with an army if held Chitral. During the Viceroyalty of Lord Lytton, it was deemed expedient, in view of Russian military activity in Central Asia, to obtain more effective control over the passes of the Hindu Kush. And it was the same menace, real or fanciful, which prompted the Marquess of Lansdowne to re-establish the Gilgit Agency in 1889. Until 1892 Mehtar Aman ul-Mulk had provided a sturdy bulwark to British interests, his death had jeopardised that security. The British preferred to conciliate Nizam ul-Mulk, as he was connected with Umra Khan of Jandul and with the influential Mullah Shahu Baba of Bajaur through his maternal uncle Kokhan Beg. He also had connections in Badakshan, Hunza and Dir. = Build-up to the siege of Chitral = However, with Aman ul-Mulks death, all hell broke loose in Chitral, a three way struggle for succession broke out between two of his sons, Nizam ul-Mulk and Afzal ul-Mulk and their uncle Sher Afzal. Having the fortune of being on the spot Afzal took control and proclaimed himself Mehtar. The first thing that Afzal did was to invite as many brothers as were within reach to a banquet where he murdered them. Nizam ul-Mulk was away in Yasin, of which he was the governor, when the Mehtarship was seized by his brother Afzal ul-Mulk. Anxious to consolidate his power Afzal asked the British that an officer might be sent to reside permanently in Chitral. Before, however, any arrangements could be made he was killed, after a short reign of a few months, by his uncle Sher Afzal. Nizam ul-Mulk at once hurried to Chitral and succeeded in ousting Sher Afzal. Nizam, like his brother, asked that a political officer might reside in Chitral territory, and Captain Youngshusband was accordingly sent to Mastuj. Later probably not feeling himself very secure Nizam urged for the headquarters of the residence political officer who happened at that time to be Lieutenant Gurdon, to be shifted from Mastuj to Chitral but while the question was still under determination the Mehtar was murdered by his brother Amir ul-Mulk. Amir demanded recondition from Lieutenant Gurdon who was acting as assistant political agent in Chitral. When Amir ul-Mulk came to him he very properly said that he had no power to grant recognition until instructed to do so by the Government of India but that in all probability he would be recognised. = Aftermath = Amir ul-Mulk had shown himself quite unfit to rule. He had made himself hateful to the Chitralies and had been guilty of treachery to the English. Sir George Robertson therefore declared that subject to the approval of the Government of India, Shuja ul-Mulk his younger brother was recognised as Mehtar. The critical nature of the situation leading up to the siege of Chitral is brought out very clearly in the speech made by Lord Elgin, the Viceroy of India, on 29 March 1895, to the Supreme Legislative Council.  Description  Though admirably suited to govern a savage people, he was exceedingly cruel, treacherous and vindictive. Sir Lepel Griffin has called him – a translucent old savage. At his accession he killed all his near relations except his brother Sher Afzul, who fled. Historian John Keay has put him down as \\"the cunning genius\\". whereas orientalist, Gottlieb Wilhelm Leitner has referred to him as, \\"A terrible man, who to extraordinary courage joined the arts of the diplomatist\\".  Murder of Hayward  Aman ul-Mulk is believed to be the instigator of the murder of British explorer George W. Hayward through the agency of Mir Wali of Yasin.

Shortly after taking off, the Lockheed L-188 Electra of Reeve Aleutian Airways was travelling over the Pacific Ocean when one of the propellers broke away from its engine and struck the fuselage, damaging the flight controls. The pilots were able to make a successful emergency landing at Anchorage International Airport; none of the fifteen passengers and crew on board was injured in the incident. Aircraft The aircraft involved in the incident was a Lockheed L-188C Electra, powered by 4 turboprop engines, with manufacturer's serial number 2007 and registration N1968R. It had been delivered to Qantas in 1959. In 1968, after service with other airlines, including Air New Zealand and the California Airmotive Corporation, the aircraft was sold to Reeve Aleutian.https://www.planelogger.com/Aircraft/Registration/N1968R/781753 Retrieved June 30, 2017 It had flown approximately 33,000 hours in service at the time the accident happened. Flight Just after takeoff from Cold Bay Airport, on the Alaska Peninsula for a flight across the northern Pacific Ocean to Seattle, Washington, with 10 passengers, the crew noted an unusual vibration in the aircraft, but were unable to isolate the source. As the aircraft climbed from FL190 (approximately ) to FL250 (approximately ), the Flight Engineer left the cockpit to visually check the engines from the passenger cabin, but saw nothing amiss. The Flight Attendant went into the cockpit to discuss the vibration, which suddenly increased in intensity as she went back into the cabin. She looked out the window just in time to see the propeller on the No. 4 engine (the outboard engine on the right wing) detach itself and fly spinning under the fuselage. The propeller tore a gash long in the aircraft's belly, depressurizing the cabin and jamming the flight and engine controls. The pilots managed to gain some control of the aircraft by using the autopilot and diverted the aircraft to Anchorage. With the engine throttle controls jammed at cruise power, on approach to land the crew was able to make the aircraft descend and climb after shutting down No. 2 (the left inboard) engine in combination with lowering and raising the landing gear. The Electra landed safely at Anchorage International Airport, even with the loss of almost all flight controls. The crew had to shut down all engines once the aircraft was on the ground in order to help bring it to a stop; one tire blew out and the brakes caught fire. Nobody was hurt when the propeller hit the fuselage or during the emergency landing. The captain, 54-year-old James (Jim) Gibson, with 5,700 hours' experience flying Electras, was honored for the successful landing by a meeting with President Ronald Reagan in the White House. The Air Line Pilots Association also honored Captain Gibson, 39-year-old First Officer Gary Lintner and 45-year-old Flight Engineer Gerald \\"Moose\\" Laurin later in 1983 with its Superior Airmanship Award.

The film tells a deceptively simple account of tramautized schoolgirl's quest to her shoes, since, her school is reopening one and half months after the devastating Gorkha earthquake. The film is the first fiction film to be filmed in Gorkha, the epicentre of Nepal earthquake 2015 after the earthquake. The film won Best Children Film in Nepal Culture international Film Festival.  Logline  One and a half months after the devastating earthquake reduced an entire village to rubble, and a ten-year-old girl longs for normality. News reaches her that school will re-open in a day and she is understandably overjoyed, but there is a hitch: she must first locate her shoes --- mandatory under new school rules --- in the debris that was once her home.  Synopsis  In the Gurung village of Ghyachchok, almost all the houses have collapsed. Inside the crumbling walls of a roofless house, a hangman’s knot hangs from a beam. Ram Sir, the village school teacher, has just arrived after several weeks in his own village in Sindupalanchok, leaving his wife and daughter in a makeshift shelter made of zinc sheet. The government has announced that all educational institutions must re-open, but Ram is worried about the monsoon and the increased threat of landslides in his own village. Moreover, mobile network is poor in Ghyachchowk and the lack of news about his family adds to the teacher’s woes. Ten-year-old Phulsiri is attending the funeral of a Gurkha soldier, who served in the Indian army and appears to have taken his own life after he lost all the members of his family to the earthquake. Along the way, Phulsiri meets her classmate Prabal and learns from him that school is re-opening the very next day. Phulsiri and her father Amber, who broke his leg in an aftershock, have been living in temporary shelter after the earthquake destroyed their home. Like most people of the village, Phulsiri has been longing for normalcy. The news about her school, understandably, leaves her in high spirits. But the school has strict rules about the school uniform, including shoes, and hers are still buried under the rubble of her home. Phulsiri remembers her teacher Ram, only a day before the earthquake, expressly warning her not to show up without shoes. Phulsiri already has her school shirt and frock, and she is impatient to look for her shoes. But her continuous pleading to her father to allow her to leave the funeral is in vain. Moreover, he tells her that even if her shoes survived the earthquake, they would not have survived the subsequent rains. Even the conclusion of the funeral doesn’t mean freedom for Phulsiri to look for her shoes in peace. New obstacles materialize and the process of overcoming them is slow and painful. Phulsiri learns that the hard way that surviving an earthquake isn’t enough as the film painstakingly chronicles her struggles and her coping strategies in the wake of the worst natural disaster in the living memory of her community.

Cwynar was born in Vancouver, Canada in 1985 and currently lives and works in Brooklyn, New York. Cwynar's work presents a marriage of old and new forms that are intended to challenge the way that people encounter visual and material culture in everyday life. Early life and education Cwynar grew up in Vancouver, Canada, where her twin sister Kari Cwynar is currently a curator. She was introduced to the idea of “kitsch,” which features prominently in her work, by the figure-skating costumes that she and her sister would wear in competition. She studied English literature at the University of British Columbia and eventually earned a Bachelor of Design Honours degree from York University in Toronto in 2010. Cwynar works as a freelance graphic designer for the New York Times. She earned an MFA in Photography from Yale University in 2016. Work Cwynar uses a variety of media, including photography, collage, book-making and installation, to explore the nature of photographic images and the power and limitations of the medium itself. Cwynar's background in literature and graphic design helps to create the fascinating hybridity of her pieces. Through the use of saved personal photographs and found images from both printed resources and the internet, Cwynar's work communicates not only about the final image of a photograph but also about the process of image making. Cwynar has been exhibiting work since 2009, when she was featured in her first group show at Gallery 1313 in Toronto called \\"Wayfaring: Towards Answering a Call\\". She designed the cover art for a 2013 album by the band Washed Out using a combination of photography, illustration and Photoshop. Cwynar had an exhibition in 2014 at Flat Death at Foxy Production in New York. The exhibition had its ideological roots in Kitsch Encyclopedia and explored “a kind of ‘ritual extermination’ upon the hyperreal by confusing representation and reality.” Like Cwynar’s work in general, this show was a mix of photography, collage, rephotography, appropriation and studio set-ups. Cwynar's 2015 project Presidential Index featured photographs of Avon Presidential Bust Cologne bottles that she bought on eBay and removed the heads of the presidents so that only their torsos are visible. In some pieces, she enlarged the busts to be as large as her own torso and in others she arranged the bottles according to the popularity of that president’s scent. She paired these images with pictures of a make-up palette from “Ultra Cosmetics” and two photographs of rugs. Cwynar's ideas behind this piece link these objects to the desire for aesthetic change through commercial and material goods. Her work is in the permanent collection at the Dallas Museum of Art; Foam Fotografiemuseum Amsterdam; Milwaukee Art Museum; MoMA Collection, New York; Minneapolis Institute of Art; SFMOMA, San Francisco; Guggenheim Museum, New York; Art Gallery of Ontario, Toronto; Fondazione Prada, Milan; Baloise Art Collection, Basel, Switzerland; Kadist Art Foundation, San Francisco; Nerman Museum of Contemporary Art, Kansas City; Zabludowicz Collection, London; Centre Pompidou, Paris; MMK Museum für Moderne Kunst, Frankfurt Soho House, Toronto; and TD Bank Canada Collection, Toronto. Rose Gold (2017) is a research-oriented mediation on the emotional impact of color: how color can manifest desire. It has the tone and structure of an educational film, like the National Film Board of Canada documentaries produced in the 1960s and ‘70s.It is richly layered reflection on the relationship between color, technology, material objects, and desire elicited from the talismanic powers of the Apple Rose Gold iPhone. Publications She has published two books, *Cwynar, Sara. Kitsch Encyclopedia: A Survey of Universal Knowledge. Blonde Art Books, 2014. *Cwynar, Sara. Pictures of Pictures.New York : Printed Matter Inc., 2014. Kitsch Encyclopedia builds on an interest in the ordinary object that Cwynar attributes to her reading of Milan Kundera’s The Unbearable Lightness of Being. The title reflects Cwynar’s understanding of Kundera’s definition of “kitsch” as images that we are drawn to in order to escape from all that is aesthetically unpleasant in life.

The lighthouse is maintained by the Lancaster Port Commission. It is registered under the international Admiralty number A4876 and has the NGA identifier of 114-5144. Description The lighthouse at high tide in 2009 The lighthouse consists of an white conical stone tower, with a black lantern and twin galleries, built on a rock ledge that is uncovered at low tide. With a focal height of 6m above sea level, the light can be seen for six nautical miles. Its light characteristic is made up of a flash of white light every two seconds. History The lighthouse was built in 1847, as the lower light of a pair of leading lights, and is therefore also called the front or Low Light. The rear or High Light, known as Cockersand Lighthouse, once stood next to the Abbey Lighthouse cottage on Slack Lane. It was a square wooden tower supported by angled wooden struts. The leading lights helped ships navigate into the Lune estuary, to reach Glasson Dock and then onwards via the Lancaster Canal to the port of Lancaster, with Plover Scar marking the rocky outcrop at the edge of the deep water channel into the estuary. Both lighthouses were equipped with a pair of paraffin lamps mounted in parabolic reflectors, each displaying fixed light seawards. In the early 1950s electric lamps replaced the oil lanterns; at the same time the wooden High Light was replaced by a metal framework tower. By the end of the decade the lights were fully automated; the High Light was deactivated some time after 1985 but Plover Scar remains active. =Keepers= Prior to automation the lighthouse keepers and their families lived in the lighthouse cottage next to the Cockersand lighthouse. Originally the accommodation was incorporated into the base of the lighthouse structure, but was later replaced by the cottage that still stands today. The keepers maintained both lighthouses, walking across to Plover Scar at low tide. The Raby family kept the lights for nearly a century, until 1945 when it was taken over by the Parkinson family. Mrs Parkinson was filmed maintaining the lights in 1948 by the British Pathé news organisation. 2016 collision damage In March 2016, the lighthouse was badly damaged when it was struck by a passing commercial vessel, which was navigating its way at night to Glasson Docks. The collision dislodged the upper part of the tower, and although the light continued to operate, substantial reconstruction of the tower was deemed necessary. The subsequent repairs which started in September 2016 meant the stone tower had to be partially dismantled, with the lantern removed for renovation. Over 200 stone blocks from the dismantled tower were taken to a work site on the beach and numbered so that they could be reused when the light was rebuilt. The works also revealed that an extra outer layer of stones had been built around the tower, which had been added in 1856 to create an outer walkway. Although the works were delayed by various factors, they were finally completed in May 2017.

There is a kund (well) in Bagdana called the Gangajalia Kund at the ancient temple of Lord Mahadeva known as Bagadeshwar Mahadeva. The kund is actually a formation by three rivers namely The Bagad, The Hadamtaalu and The Saraswati. The Saraswati is said to be sourced underneath the Self evolved(Swaymbhu) Linga out of two lingas inside the temple. On the festival of Balev(Rakhi Bandhan), Brahmins of Bagdana and around gather at this ancient Bagadeshwar Mahadeva temple for the ritual of Transformation(Shuddhikaran) of Sacred thread(Yajno Pavita) and take the holy bath in Gangajalia Kund praying for the societal welfare. The Bagad river which is the main waterbody flows past Datha, rises in the jungles of Dareda, Ghebar near Bagdana and ends in Gopnath.

He ruled the princely state of Chitral from 1936 to 1943.  Early life and education  Nasir ul-Mulk was born in the royal fort at Chitral on 29 September 1897. He was the eldest son of Mehtar Shuja ul-Mulk. He spent his early days in the Chitral fort under the tutelage of several teachers who trained him in Persian, Urdu, English and Arabic. In 1916 he enrolled in Islamia College Peshawar, from where he did his Matriculation. He later completed his Bachelor of Arts with a distinction, earning first position in the North West Frontier Province. For the feat he received the Chelmsford Gold Medal. Starting from a young age Nasir was education oriented and had advanced political ideas.  Third Anglo-Afghan War (1919)  As the Third Anglo-Afghan War unfolded, the southern borders of Chitral were attacked. The Chitral Scouts and Bodyguards with Nasir ul-Mulk as Colonel Commandant (Col. Cdt) fought off the advancing army. He personally lead a force of over a thousand men up the valley of Urtsun, over a pass with the intention of surprising the Afghan forces and cutting them off. To the credit of the young prince, the Chitral forces along with the Kurram Militia were the only legions fighting along the Durand Line which did not disband or disburse during the conflict. The success of the campaign brought Nasir a good name in British circles with Shuja ul-Mulk being rewarded reverently for the war efforts.  Life as crown prince  When Shuja ul-Mulk went for pilgrimage to Mecca (1923-1924), Nasir ul-Mulk acted as Regent and administered the affairs of the state. Upon his father’s return he became Governor of Mastuj, which post he retained till his accession. On 10 September 1924 he was commissioned as Honorary Lieutenant in the British Indian Army and was attached to the 6th Royal Battalion Frontier Force Regiment. He was later attached to the 13th Frontier Force Rifles (1926-1927). In 1932 he was elected as a life member of the Royal Society for Asian Affairs. On 1 January 1934 he was promoted as Honorary Captain of in the British Indian Army. During this period he was also inducted into the Indian Civil Service (ICS) as an Assistant Commissioner. A career that he seriously contemplated pursuing before circumstances obliged him to forgo the option.  Accession to the throne  On 13 October 1936 Sir Shuja ul-Mulk died suddenly in Chitral of heart failure. Nasir ul-Mulk being the eldest son, succeeded him and was proclaimed Mehtar with full powers at a durbar attended by the Political Agent Malakand Major Johnson on 19 October 1936. Shuja ul-Mulk had died leaving a comparatively stable atmosphere for his successor. Upon becoming the ruler of Chitral he automatically acquired the title of His Highness (which was then hereditary). However the honorific title of Sir would be bestowed several years later when he was Knighted.  Reign (1936-1943)  Nasir ul-Mulk ruled for about seven years, in which he proved to be an enlightened chief. He immediately set up the first school in Chitral in 1937. In 1939, he proceeded on a pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia. On the way there he met Sir Sultan Muhammad Shah Aga Khan III at Bombay. Upon completion of Hajj and while returning, he visited the State of Hyderabad and was received with official protocol by Sir Muhammad Akbar Nazar Ali Hydari the Prime Minister of Hyderabad. He also met the Nizam of Hyderabad before returning to Chitral. Soon after his return to Chitral, news broke out of World War II starting in Europe. In India, the Viceroys War Purpose Fund was being collected, into which the Mehtar made a donation of 30,000 Indian Rupees. The Governor of the North West Frontier Province welcomed the initiative. Nasir was promoted as Hon Major in the British Indian Army in 1940. In October 1940, the governor of NWFP Sir George Cunningham accompanied by the Political Agent Malakand visited Chitral. Massive celebrations were held in their honor. At the conclusion of their visit two demands were placed before the Governor by Nasir ul-Mulk. # The area of Yasin and Ghizer which were part of Chitral at the time of Aman ul-Mulk were taken away by the British in 1895. These areas, it was pleaded, should be returned to Chitral. # All outside forces serving in the defense of Chitral should be replaced by local recruits. Sir George assured the Mehtar that both demands would be considered and eventually the second was accepted. Nasir was made a Knight Commander of the Indian Empire (KCIE) on 1 January 1941. In February the same year, he traveled to Delhi and met the Viceroy Victor Hope, the Marquess of Linlithgow. He also met leaders of the All-India Muslim League and Indian National Congress including Muhammad Ali Jinnah, Mohandas Gandhi, Sir Zafarullah Khan, Sir Shah Muhammad Sulaiman and Maulana Abul Kalam Azad. On 1 January 1943, he was promoted to the rank of Honorary Colonel in the British Indian Army. Until then, Nasir had also served as Honorary Colonel Commandant of the Chitral State Scouts (1936-1943). He had no sons but left behind two daughters, one of whom would marry Nawab Bahadur Mohammad Saeed Khan of Amb and the other her cousin, Saif-ur-Rahman later Mehtar of Chitral.  Literary pursuits  Nasir ul-Mulk was a scholar of Persian literature and published several volumes of poetry and prose, he was a close associate of several prominent literary figures of British India, including Sir Mohammad Iqbal. Perhaps his most accomplished work is a Persian treatise on Darwinism in the light of the Quran, Sunnah and Sufi mysticism. The Tarikh-i-Chitral written in Persian by Mirza Muhammad Ghufran was revised and enlarged as the Nayi Tarikh-i-Chitral with the additional research of Nasir ul-Mulk by Mirza Ghulam Murtaza. Nasir is believed to have taken a personal and keen interest in the expansion of the text.  Death  Nasir ul- Mulk, died in 1943 without leaving a male heir. He had reigned for seven years and was succeeded by his brother, Muzaffar ul-Mulk.  Disambiguation  Sir Nasir ul-Mulk is not to be confused with Justice Nasir-ul-Mulk the 22nd Chief Justice of Pakistan. The latter's father Kamran Khan, was a wealthy and respectable businessman from Swat who had his business branches throughout N.W.F.P including the State of Chitral. Kamran Khan, upon learning about the royal family of Chitral is believed to have developed a liking for the surname ul-Mulk and named his sons Shuja-ul-Mulk, Nasir-ul-Mulk and Rafil-ul-Mulk (the first two being after Chitral's ex-rulers). There is no lineal connecting between the families or Sir Nasir ul-Mulk and Justice Nasir-ul-Mulk for that matter.

Born and raised in France, Maidenberg is best known for his architecture and interior work with hotels throughout Paris. Maidenberg established his firm, Maidenberg Architecture, in 1991. The company is one of the few firms in Paris that specializes in hotel architecture and design. Maidenberg's creative and eclectic style can be found in all of his projects, including Hotel 34B, Hotel Grand Amour, Hotel Bel Ami, Hotel Le Six, Joke Hotel and Hotel 123 Sebastopol, which was honored with the World Luxury Boutique Award in 2015. Early life Philippe Maidenberg's parents owned a tour operating company and travel agencies, so as a child, Maidenberg had seen and learned about the hospitality industry. His parents also exposed him to music, film and Parisian culture at an early age. Maidenberg's father particularly loved music, dance and aesthetics. As a teenager, Maidenberg's main creative influence was his continuous love for music. Some of his favorite artists included Thelonious Monk, Dizzy Gillespie, Elvin Jones, Max Roach, and Art Blakey. When the time came for Philippe to decide on a focus of study, he knew that, like his musical heroes, he wanted to do something creative. Inspired by his uncle, who was an architect, Philippe studied architecture and design, combining his personal creativity, his uncle's influence, and the hospitality industry information he learned from his parents. Education Maidenberg completed his main studies at the Parisian architectural university of Paris-Malaquais. As part of his studies, Maidenberg completed a hands-on, three-year internship at the Grand Louvre Pyramid construction site with Ieoh Ming Pei and Partners. Maidenberg has credited the site and company with opening the world of architecture up to him. Following work on the Grand Louvre pyramid, Maidenberg interned at the Murphy/Jahn agency in Chicago, where he worked on his first hotel, a Hyatt near Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport. Maidenberg received his architecture degree in 1990. Career Maidenberg's design style ranges from luxurious to outrageous and always utilizes fresh, light and innovative design. His projects are often personal or experience-based, reflecting a passion of Maidenberg's or a specific theme inspired by art and music. Early in his career, Maidenberg worked with the Astotel Group in Paris to design fourteen hotels, beginning with a small part of Hotel 34B and including a full refurbishment of the Lorette Hotel. Maidenberg's partnership with the Astotel Group led to much of his early work, which garnered national and international acclaim. Maidenberg has also worked for the Bessé Group (Hotel Bel Ami – St- Germain) and the Beaumarly Group (Gilbert & Thierry Costes). Maidenberg's firm has directed over 40 hotel renovations and constructions, and Maidenberg himself continues to be recognized for his unique designs. Maidenberg Architecture is made up of a small team of expert architects and interior designers.

Maidenberg and his team have collaborated with A-list celebrities and creators, including Claude Lelouch, Jean-Paul Belmondo, Rickie Lee Jones, Ennio Morricone, Archie Shepp, Manu Katché, Jacques Higelin, MC Solaar, Daniele Thompson, Elsa Zylberstein, and Agnes Jaoui.

He was responsible for enduring innovations in translation, such as the simultaneous, head-set method used at the Nuremberg Trials, which is still used today at international gatherings and international institutions like the United Nations, the Council of Europe, the European Commission and the European Parliament.  Early life and education  Born in Longwy, France, at the beginning of the twentieth century, Dostert's foreign-language capabilities became apparent during a childhood affected by World War I. His village on the Belgian border was overrun by the German army during that conflagration before being liberated by its American counterpart, and Dostert had mastered both German and English before the end of hostilities. Such was his command of both languages, he worked as a translator for both the Germans and the Americans.. Orphaned before the outbreak of war, Dostert was well liked by the American troops he worked for – so much so, in fact, that a few of them sponsored his education in the United States after the war. In 1921, after recovering from war-related ill-health, Dostert enrolled in a high school in Pasadena, California.Sources differ on which school he attended. For example, Gordin (2015), p. 230) states Pasadena High School, while gives South Pasadena High School. He entered Occidental College in 1925, before moving to Georgetown University a few years later, where in 1928 he gained a BS in foreign service.. Another bachelor's degree, in philosophy, followed in 1930, and a master's in 1931. Dostert was accepted as a PhD student in languages at Johns Hopkins, though he never finished his thesis.  Wartime service  Dostert was responsible for translation at the Nuremberg Trials.  Machine translation  Dostert became the inaugural head of Georgetown's Institute of Languages and Linguistics. The Institute would collaborate with IBM to perform the first ever machine translation, which was publicly demonstrated in 1954. Dostert himself announced the achievement, though the public event itself was more a proof of concept to garner further interest and resources.

He took the important decision of Chitrals accession to Pakistan in 1947. He dispatched his army into Gilgit in August 1947, to help secure that territory for Pakistan.  Life prior to accession  Muzaffar ul-Mulk was born on 6 October 1901. He was the second son of Mehtar Sir Shuja ul-Mulk. He was given over for foster care at a young age and spent the early part of his childhood at his foster home. He received education from Islamia College Peshawar, ultimately ending up with an F.A. During the Anglo-Afghan War of 1919 he served with the Chitral State Bodyguards under the command of his brother Nasir ul-Mulk, in fending off the Afghan attack. In 1924 he returned to Chitral and became the Chief Secretary to his father Mehtar Shuja ul-Mulk. In 1930 he became the administrator of Torkhow region in Chitral. The designation was formally termed the Governor of Torkhow. In 1939 he accompanied Nasir ul-Mulk on pilgrimage to Mecca. Meanwhile Muzaffar was to retain his administrative post until his unforeseen accession as Mehtar in 1943. On 29 July 1943 Mehtar Nasir ul-Mulk died of a stroke. He had two daughters but no son’s. As fate would have it, he died without leaving a natural heir. Thus the seat of power passed on to Muzaffar ul-Mulk, who was the Mehtars immediate younger brother. The Political Agent Malakand came to Chitral and formally recognised the new ruler.  Reign (1943-1949)  After his accession as Mehtar, Muzaffar ul-Mulk embarked on an initiative to replace the existing administration, with his own appointees. He established a separate office for the Wazir-e-Azam Chitral and delegated to the office many administrative functions. In January 1944, the British Government presented Muzaffar ul-Mulk with a gift of 4 large cannons and 106 Martini–Henry Rifles. By this period Muzaffars health had steadily declined, in May 1946 it was discovered that the reason for his ailing health was diabetes. The effect of this reflected itself in his administration, which grew inoperative. By early 1947 large scale protests were held across the state, which entailed the Political Agent Malakand to come to Chitral and persuade the ailing Mehtar to dismiss some of the officials who’s negligence had contributed to the situation. Some of the legitimate demands of the protesters were acceded to, resulting in the protests fading. In early 1947 it was clear that it was a matter of time before the British would leave the subcontinent and two independent sovereign states would emerge. Conscious of this, Muzaffar ul-Mulk sent a delegate to Muhammad Ali Jinnah to convey that he wholeheartedly supported the cause of Pakistan and would in due time exercising his right under the Indian Independence Act 1947 accede to Pakistan. He also deposited Rs 40,000 into Mr Jinnahs Pakistan Fund. In May 1947 Indian Secretary for Frontier and Tribal Affairs visited Chitral. Muzaffar ul-Mulk conveyed to him Chitrals plans of acceding to Pakistan and asked that the intention be formally conveyed to the authorities. Chitral became the first princely state to announce that it would accede to Pakistan. Although formal accession and signing of the Instrument of Accession occurred in November 1947. Thus Chitral became a part of Pakistan and a constitutional monarchy. Meanwhile it became clear that the Maharaja of Kashmir desired to accede to India. Considering this a betrayal of the Muslim majority populace of Kashmir, Muzaffar telegraphically conveyed to Maharaja Hari Singh that such a decision would provoke aggression from Chitral. With the endorsement of Muzaffar ul-Mulk many mujahideen left Chitral to fight a jihad in Kashmir and be part of the conflict which had arisen. The jihadists were followed by the Bodyguards and the Chitral Scouts lead by Mata ul-Mulk and Burhan-ud-Din. The Chitral forces fought for 4 months laying Siege to Skardu and returning with triumph.

Tikal is one of the most important archaeological sites of the pre-Columbian Maya civilization and is located in the Petén Department of northern Guatemala. The complex served dual administrative and residential purposes.Harrison 2001, p. 200. The Central Acropolis was first established in the Late Preclassic period (c. 350 BC – 250 AD) of Mesoamerican chronology,Harrison 2001, p. 201. and it remained in use until approximately 950 AD.Harrison 2003a, p. 184. The Central Acropolis housed Tikal royal families.Schele and Mathews 1999, pp. 66–67. From its earliest period of use, the eastern portion of what later became the Central Acropolis was used as a royal residence, and by the Early Classic period (c. 250 – 550 AD) it was the location of an important residential palace complex. The inhabitants of Tikal levelled out the natural bedrock underlying the Central Acropolis at above mean sea level, a few meters above the level of the Great Plaza. The bedrock drops off steeply to the east and south of the acropolis. History The earliest known activity in the complex dates to the period from 350 BC to 1 AD. The first structures consisted of masonry platforms with perishable superstructures, evidenced by postholes. None of these early structures have been completely excavated, with glimpses of them being given by tunnelling into the acropolis. These early remains have been discovered in various locations beneath later structures, suggesting that the entire area of the Central Acropolis extends back to the earliest period of activity. The early structures on the southern boundary of the acropolis were much lower than later structures, and were probably built directly upon the bedrock of the ridge. As the acropolis developed, these were overlain by later architecture but the area covered by the complex remained within the early- established boundaries.Harrison 2003a, pp. 184–185. Between 250 and 550 AD, masonry began to be employed in building palace structures. =Modern history= A description of the complex was published by Teoberto Maler in 1911. Maler described the Central Acropolis as a labyrinthine multi-storey complex with several preserved wooden lintels, one of which was sculpted. The first excavations of the acropolis were undertaken in 1962 under the direction of Peter Harrison, and seasonal excavations continued until 1967; the project completely excavated 25 structures. When the acropolis was mapped in the 1960s, some structures were large mounds overgrown by forest; excavation revealed them to be complex structures with numerous rooms.Harrison 2003a, p. 171. As of 2003, the Central Acropolis had still not been completely excavated.Harrison 2003a, p. 172. Description Structure 5D-46 was a residence of king Chak Tok Ich'aak The Central Acropolis is oriented east- west, and this orientation was established very early in its history. The acropolis continued to develop over a period of more than five hundred years.Harrison 2003a, p. 182. As the complex developed over time, it expanded upwards with the superposition of new architecture, rather than outwards to cover a greater area. The palace structures in the acropolis are arranged around a series of six courtyards, each at a different level.Coe and Haviland 1982, p. 17. Harrison 2003a, p. 171. The complex includes 43 structures. Excavations uncovered few burials within the Central Acropolis, but four were discovered underneath a single structure (5D-46).Harrison 2003a, pp. 176–177. In general at lowland Maya sites, burials were common under family residences; the lack of burials under most structures in the Central Acropolis indicates that most were not permanently occupied residential structures. Those complex structures in the acropolis that did not have burials were likely to have been temporary residences serving such functions as housing for the priesthood, schools, and ritual retreat houses. These uses would parallel functions represented in similar contexts after Spanish contact with the Postclassic period Maya.Harrison 2003a, pp. 177–178. The courtyards within the Acropolis each had four sides, although they were not square.Harrison 2003a, p. 181. Although the courtyards were all on different vertical levels, this appears to have been a deliberate decision by planners, and the multi-level nature of the complex was intentionally maintained throughout its period of use, even though the architectural layout, floor levels, and access between courtyards changed over time. The courtyards were enclosed by a labyrinthine mass of multi-level architecture decorated with complex sculpture representing mythic and historical subjects, combined with hieroglyphic texts.Harrison 2003a, pp. 179, 181. =Structures= The east façade of Structure 5D-65, also known as Maler's Palace 5D-46 was an opulent, complex structure and was likely to have been the residence of the royal family; it was built upon levelled bedrock. Four burials were excavated under the structure. The structure has been dated to about AD 350 by a combination of radiocarbon dating and ceramic evidence. A hieroglyphic inscription on a ceramic vessel interred under the principal western stairway identifies the building as the residence of king Chak Tok Ich'aak I, who reigned from c. 360 until his violent death in 378 AD.Martin and Grube 2000, pp. 26, 28–29. Sharer 2203, p. 321. Structure 5D-46 was a single-storey palace built upon a raised platform, with stairways giving access on the east and west sides. The west stairway remained relatively unchanged throughout five centuries of development, while the east stairway underwent various alterations, each modification being marked by a dedicatory human burial with associated grave goods.Harrison 2003, pp. 186-187. It is notable that this palace structure was not pillaged during the corresponding conquest, nor was it buried under later construction, although later modifications to its original layout did occur, even though other structures from the same period, in common Maya practice, were buried by later construction projects.Harrison 2003a, pp. 178–179. The original structure is thought to have been the clan house of Chak Tok Ich'aak's lineage. The Irma Structure is a very early platform with post holes from a perishable structure. It was found immediately to the south of the south patio of Structure 5D-46, and was built directly upon levelled bedrock.Harrison 2003a, p. 186. It was the most impressive of the earliest platforms,Harrison 2003a, p. 185. and was likely to have been the first royal residence in the Central Acropolis.Harrison 2003a, pp. 185–186. The Irma Structure was buried under later flooring, and subsequently under the 9th-century AD expansion of Structure 5D-46, which included the addition of its south patio, a part of the wall of which ran straight across the earlier structure. 5D-52 faced southwards; it was built over an earlier structure that faced in the opposite direction. The earlier structure is known as the Palace of the Red Dado, due to a band of red decoration painted around the base of the interior walls. Later construction resulted in the destruction at the base of its former corbel vaulting, but below that the walls are very well preserved. This underlying structure has not yet been dated. 5D-57 has not been completely excavated, but when the exterior of this complex building was uncovered, two images of a ruler were revealed, accompanied by a short hieroglyphic text. The scene celebrates the capture of an important person allied with Calakmul by Tikal king Jasaw Chan K'awiil I. This event took place in AD 695, and the structure was built soon afterwards. Structure 5D-57 was probably Jasaw Ch'an K'awiil's royal residence.Harrison 2003a, p. 178. 5D-60 has not been thoroughly excavated, and its exact nature is unknown. However, it possessed a false façade facing north towards the side of Temple I.Harrison 2003a, pp. 175, 183. This false front gave the impression of a high, terraced temple, although the superstructure is not laid out like a temple shrine and was only accessible from the summit. This façade had been added to a pre-existing structure, which is now buried under later construction.Harrison 2003a, p. 183. 5D-65 has been nicknamed Maler's Palace. Its western façade was the retaining wall of the southwest side of the acropolis. The west room of the structure has an exterior doorway opening above the retaining wall. The room's interior possesses a large, recessed false doorway opposite the exterior door, designed to give the illusion of a temple when viewed from below.Harrison 2003a, pp. 175, 183–184. 5D-71 faces north onto the Great Plaza. The remains of an early masonry platform dating to c. 350 BC – 1 AD were found underneath the structure. It was located on the sacred axis that runs through the North Acropolis, but not enough has been uncovered to state whether or not the early structure was centred upon that axis.Harrison 2003a, p. 175. =Burials= Burial 177 was a small chamber cist. It was found under the fill of Courtyard 1, interred on the sacred axis of the acropolis, also the central axis of Structure 5D-71; it was dated to the Early Classic period.Harrison 2003a, p. 177. Gómez 2006, p.780. The buried individual is likely to have been very high in status.Harrison 2003a, p. 177. Burial 180 was found under the external stairway of Structure 5D-46, and was apparently interred as a dedicatory offering. It was not accompanied by any grave goods.

Specifically, it would take advantage of the direct sampling opportunities of a subsurface ocean. The study concept was produced by the 2015 Jet Propulsion Laboratory Planetary Science Summer School under the guidance of TeamX. The study has not yet been formally proposed for funding. Mission concept 'tiger stripes' feature. hydrothermal activity on Enceladus. A plume of water vapor and ice spews from Enceladus's south polar region, offering a unique opportunity for a low-cost mission in the search for life and habitable environments beyond Earth. The THEO mission would further understanding of life and habitability in our solar system by addressing (i) the limits of life under colder, fainter Sun conditions, (ii) the importance of hydrothermal alteration in the origin of life, and (iii) the distribution of molecules in the Solar System that may have served as the precursors for life. The Cassini mission data suggest that this plume, sourced by a liquid reservoir beneath the moon's icy crust, contain organics, salts, and water-rock interaction derivatives. Thus, the ingredients for life as we know it are available in Enceladus's subsurface ocean. The THEO mission would primarily focus on whether Enceladus is habitable. It would not look for life forms directly, but for higher abundances of certain molecules, ratios of organic compounds, or chains of amino acids could all be biosignatures that all give away the presence of life. Mission design The trajectory of THEO would obtain the needed kinetic energy with one Venus and two Earth gravity assists. THEO would reduce its velocity (delta-v) by making flybys of Saturn moons Titan, Rhea, Dione, Tethys, and Enceladus before the Enceladus orbit insertion. The data would be collected from three orbital attitudes (500 km, 100 km, 30 km) with each representing a separate mission phase. More than 600 science orbits are expected over the span of nominal six-month mission. At the end of the mission, and according to planetary protection protocols, the orbiter will be sent on an impact trajectory to Tethys, where it will be discarded. Proposed payload This mission concept includes remote sensing and in situ analyses with: * a mass spectrometer (SWAMP) * a sub-mm radiometer-spectrometer (WAVES) * a camera (DRIPS) * a magnetometer (OSMOSIS) * doppler tracking (GEISER) These instruments (total mass ≈80 kg) were selected to address four key questions for ascertaining the habitability of Enceladus's ocean within the context of the moon's geological activity: #How are the plumes and ocean connected? #Are the abiotic conditions of the ocean suitable for habitability? #How stable is the ocean environment? #Is there evidence of biological processes?

History  Muslik-Mahmud I Begadha, Sultan of Gujarat, employed the Jats in the siege of Champaner (Chhota Udepur) in 1484, and granted the estate of Bajana with 24 villages to their leader Hadoji. The Jats subsequently conquered Mandal in Viramgam Taluqa from the Jhalas. They were allowed to retain several of its villages, although Mandal itself was taken by the Sultan.

The Hotel Nevada was built at a cost of $400,000, and was opened on July 7, 1929, with 100 hotel rooms. At six stories high, it was the tallest building in the state until 1931. Many celebrities and politicians have stayed at the hotel since it opened. The hotel-casino has changed ownership numerous times during its history, and was closed temporarily in 1986, because of a local economic downturn. The Hotel Nevada was sold to Bert Woywood and Paul Kellogg in February 1994. After 20 years, Woywood sold his ownership stake to Gaughan Gaming in February 2014. History =Early history and construction= In 1926, Earl Ray \\"E. R.\\" Miller ( 1884–1978), an East Ely businessman who was searching for markets for his cement product, chose to promote the construction of a large hotel in Ely. With financial backing from various local groups and citizens, the Hotel Nevada Realty Company, Incorporated was formed. Joseph \\"Candy Joe\\" Fouilleul, an officer of Hotel Nevada Realty Company, operated Joe's Candy Kitchen on the property that was desired for the new hotel, at the corner of Aultman Street and Fifth Street. Fouilleul was ultimately persuaded to move his business in exchange for a high position on the board of the new company. The H.L. Stevens & Company of San Francisco was hired to design the hotel. Plans for the six-story hotel included at least 60 rooms, a restaurant, a banquet room, a club room, a barber shop, and large storage areas. A picture of the proposed hotel appeared on the front cover of Hotel World magazine in September 1927. On November 3, 1927, it was announced that organization of the new Hotel Nevada Corporation was complete, after six months. Removal of buildings on the property, as well as excavation work, was expected to begin in January 1928. Clearing of the present buildings on the property began in May 1928, with demolition expected to be completed around the end of the month and excavation expected to begin immediately afterward. Excavation work was later expected to begin in mid–June 1928, at which point the demolition of the recently vacated Collins hardware store was to be completed. The site of the future hotel was 100 feet by 100 feet. The hotel's basement was expected to be 10 feet deep. Construction was to be handled by The Wheelwright Construction Company, with a contract price of $2,875,000. Excavation for the basement was completed in early July 1928. During construction, approximately four feet of cement was poured between each floor of the hotel. After the completion of the brick building's exterior on February 5, 1929, construction crews transferred their focus to the hotel's interior. =Opening and operation (1929–1986)= The $400,000 Hotel Nevada opened on July 7, 1929, with 100 rooms. An official grand opening ceremony was held on the night of July 15, 1929, with 167 guests in attendance from Nevada, California and Utah. U.S. Senator Tasker Oddie and U.S. Representative Sam Arentz were the guest speakers at the event; they and others, including Ely mayor Alfred Tamblyn, gave speeches about the hotel's various construction phases. The six-story hotel was the tallest building in the state until 1931, when the seven-story El Cortez Hotel in Reno, Nevada was completed. The Hotel Nevada was also the state's first fire-proof building. The Hotel Nevada covertly offered Bathtub gin and moonshine to its customers, as Prohibition in the United States was still in effect. The Hotel Nevada also secretly provided its guests with gambling, which was made illegal in Nevada in 1910. After the Great Depression began in October 1929, the hotel was forced to lease commercial space to a drug store and a bank to maintain profits and stay open. When gambling was once again legalized in Nevada in 1931, the owners immediately renovated the casino, and added slot machines and blackjack tables, with an opening planned for March 30, 1931. In February 1932, ownership was taken over by Wingfield banks when they bid $100,000 for the property, after its stockholders were unable to refinance loans amounting to $175,000. That month, the stockholders were planning to reacquire the property. In April 1932, the Hotel Nevada was purchased by a group that was headed by Winfield Scott \\"Ole\\" Elliott (18691938), of Goldfield, Nevada. The building was owned by the Henderson Bank Mortgage Company of Elko (50 percent), the Tonopah Banking Corporation (15 percent), the Carson Valley Bank (12 2/3 percent), and the Bank of Nevada Savings & Trust Company (23 1/3 percent). Elliott acted as the hotel's manager on behalf of the banks. Elliott subsequently partnered with Bert Riddick when they purchased the hotel from the banks for $80,000 in April 1936, with Elliott remaining as the hotel's manager. Elliott also owned Ely's Northern Hotel, which had been the city's leading hotel until the opening of Hotel Nevada. In October 1938, Elliott died of a cerebral hemorrhage in his home at the Hotel Nevada, after suffering several strokes. A beauty shop operated inside the hotel in 1939. Elliott's wife, Mae, operated the hotel as co-owner with Riddick until her death in May 1941. Mae Elliot's interest in the hotel was inherited by her two sisters, and later disposed to Riddick when he purchased the Elliotts' interest in the hotel in February 1943, giving him sole ownership. In August 1955, Francis Everett \\"Bud\\" Simpson (19041968), a well-known local businessman, purchased Hotel Nevada for more than $500,000. At that time, Hotel Nevada had 90 rooms and was considered one of the best-known hotels in the state. Simpson planned to remodel the hotel's ground floor and convert it into a casino. The Blue Cab taxi company opened in Ely in July 1961, with its headquarters inside the Hotel Nevada. In May 1962, three men Milan Milovich, Norm Goeringer, and Lee Warren applied for approval to take over the hotel's operations and ownership as part of a $400,000 deal. That year, Simpson sold the hotel to Goeringer, Warren, and Dick Piper. In January 1964, Goeringer and Piper filed a $1 million damage suit against Warren, who was no longer an owner of the hotel. Goeringer and Piper alleged that Warren had made false statements about the hotel. The partners later split, with Goeringer as the hotel's sole owner. On December 31, 1969, an Alaska man shot and wounded a police officer inside the hotel's restaurant. In October 1971, Goeringer sold the hotel to Gary Everhart a credit manager for the Aladdin resort in Las Vegas, Nevada and his wife, Connie. The Everharts later divorced and lost the hotel back to Goeringer in 1974. In 1978, Kennecott Minerals Company closed its copper mine in nearby Ruth, Nevada, which caused a severe economic depression for Ely that endured for years. Justice Court Judge Eugene Rasmussen, of South Lake Tahoe, California, had been in eastern Nevada with a friend when they discovered that the Hotel Nevada was for sale. Rasmussen, who lacked the finances to purchase the hotel, discussed it with Terry Goggin, a Democratic state assemblyman from San Bernardino, California. Goggin subsequently recruited Dennis Krieger, an old friend and stockbroker from Beverly Hills, California. Together, the men would form the White Pine Company, with Krieger holding a 55 percent interest and acting as president, treasure and director. A 30 percent interest in the company would be held by the White Pine Trust, a fund that would be established by Goggin with his wife Jill and three children as the beneficiaries. Rasmussen, who would hold a 2.5 percent interest, would act as the secretary and director of the Hotel Nevada, as well as the trustee of Goggin's trust. On December 10, 1980, plans by the men to purchase the hotel from Goeringer for more than $380,000 were delayed by the Nevada Gaming Control Board, which had concerns about Goggin's trust fund. Because of the trust, Goggin would seemingly not benefit directly from the hotel. However, Control Board members requested that Goggin still participate in a suitability hearing. One Board member said that Goggin's trust seemed like an attempt to \\"cover something up.\\" Goggin denied that he was using the trust fund to obscure his investment in the Hotel Nevada, which was expected to range between $80,000 and $130,000 depending on bank financing. The $2.4 million takeover deal was later recommended for approval by the Control Board, and was unanimously approved by the Nevada Gaming Commission on December 18, 1980. The group received a one-year gaming license, to allow the Control Board to review the group's financial operations during that time. The group hired Robert Sanderson, a Certified Public Accountant, and his wife Janet, a former blackjack dealer and native of Fallon, Nevada, to manage the Hotel Nevada. The Sandersons became co-owners a month later in January 1981. In 1981, Norm Goeringer and his wife, Mary, sold a deed of trust on the hotel to the White Pine Company. In June 1981, Krieger, Goggin, and businessman David T. Smith signed a short-term note for $690,000, which included Krieger signing a trust deed on the Hotel Nevada. Money from the loan was used for a renovation of the hotel, beginning in September 1981. In December 1981, the Control Board recommended that the group be approved for a permanent gaming license. Because of declining business, the Hotel Nevada lost $124,456 in 1981, and continued to perform poorly during the first half of 1982. On March 14, 1983, gambling at the Hotel Nevada was briefly shut down when officials from the Internal Revenue Service seized money from the casino, although hotel guests were still allowed to stay. White Pine Company had owed back taxes of $231,380, dating to 1981. At the time of the closure, the Hotel Nevada was Ely's only hotel- casino, as well as the city's largest structure. The casino reopened the next day. In an attempt to solve its financial problems, White Pine Company filed for Chapter 11 reorganization in a Reno bankruptcy court in 1983. In summer 1986, Goeringer filed for foreclosure on the deed after White Pine Company defaulted on its payments. =Closure (1986–1987)= Because of ongoing financial difficulties, Hotel Nevada closed at approximately 2:00 p.m. on September 1, 1986, resulting in the layoffs of approximately 65 people. The closure was not authorized by bankruptcy court officials, resulting in the building's status changing to a Chapter 7 liquidation under federal bankruptcy laws. Approximately 65 slot machines and other items were removed from the property and sold in Las Vegas. A sale of the building was scheduled for September 23, 1986, but was postponed until October 3, after no potential buyers appeared for the sale. If the property failed to sell, ownership was expected to be reverted to the Goeringers, although Norm Goeringer said the building was no longer operational after the liquidation; Goeringer believed that the Hotel Nevada considered to be an important part of Ely's public image and economy could have reopened sooner had the sale not occurred. The sale was delayed again to October 15, 1986, after another lack of potential buyers. The Goeringers were declared the owners on November 17, 1986, after no prospective buyers appeared at the sale. The minimum bid had been set at just over $1.1 million, including $147,100 in equipment and furniture. Norm Goeringer planned a tentative New Year's Eve re-opening date, and had workmen refurbishing the building's interior to bring it up to state, fire, and safety standards, at a cost of at least $300,000. By February 1987, the building's interior had been gutted for the installation of a fire sprinkler system and fire alarms. New furniture was also planned for inclusion to help modernize the building. Hotel Nevada, at that time, was expected to reopen later that spring, with potentially 60 employees. =Reopening and later years (1987–present)= In March 1987, Norm Goeringer planned to have the hotel's main floor reopened in early April, while the hotel portion was planned for reopening in early May. The hotel's renovated bar reopened in early April, while the restaurant reopened on April 12. The hotel portion was scheduled for reopening on May 1, 1987, with 60 rooms. A total of 55 jobs were created when the Hotel Nevada reopened. In November 1987, Goeringer and the hotel were among 29 businesses and business owners honored at the Nevada Governor's Conference on Tourism for their promotion of tourism. The Goeringers operated the hotel until their divorce in 1989. Mary Goeringer received the hotel as part of the divorce settlement, and sold it in February 1994, to Bert Woywood and Paul Kellogg, who both lived in Las Vegas, Nevada. Woywood had been a frequent visitor to Ely since the 1970s, and would always stay at the Hotel Nevada. Woywood spent the next four years renovating the building, to restore its historical aspect. By September 1998, 40 of the hotel's 65 rooms had been renovated. The deluxe rooms were themed and dedicated to a celebrity guest who had stayed in each room. Woywood had doubled the casino from 80 slot machines to 150, and also doubled the hotel's parking and was in the process of creating a rear entrance for the building. Woywood had built up the hotel's occupancy rate to nearly 100 percent during the summer season, compared to approximately 30 percent four years earlier. Occupancy rates for the winter season were also raised significantly, to 50 percent. The hotel had planned a fireworks show for December 31, 1999, as part of a New Year's Eve celebration; those plans were cancelled because of safety concerns. For the New Year's Eve celebration, $1,500 in cash was thrown from the hotel's roof. By 2001, a new $100,000 elevator had been installed. As of 2002, the hotel remained the tallest building in Ely. Hotel Nevada's Postal Palace in 2014. Ely's former post office, a block west of Hotel Nevada, was purchased by the hotel-casino and reopened as its Postal Palace convention center on December 15, 2005. In February 2014, Gaughan Gaming and its CEO, John Gaughan, purchased Woywood's 50 percent stake of the hotel, which had 67 rooms at that point. Gaughan's young daughter was friends with Kellogg's daughter; through that relationship, Gaughan learned that Woywood wanted to sell his ownership of the hotel. Upon entering the Hotel Nevada, John Gaughan was reminded of the El Cortez hotel and casino owned by his grandfather, Jackie Gaughan in downtown Las Vegas. After Gaughan's acquisition, the building's carpets were replaced and the casino's 185 slot machines were upgraded with new technology. John Gaughan, the son of South Point casino owner Michael Gaughan, was provided unused casino equipment and furniture from the South Point for use in the Hotel Nevada. A sportsbook opened at the casino on October 23, 2014, replacing the casino's William Hill betting machine. It was the first live betting sportsbook to be introduced in Ely. Within three weeks, the sportsbook was deemed a success. The Hotel Nevada is the only casino in Ely to provide table game gambling, with three blackjack tables and a poker table. After Gaughan's purchase, the table games were eventually moved from the basement and onto the casino's ground floor. In February 2015, the restaurant was being renovated. As of 2015, the casino is , including the sportsbook. Sealed tunnels beneath the hotel are rumored by local residents to be haunted. Hotel Nevada's restaurant closed in March 2017, to allow for renovations that converted the space into a Denny's restaurant, which opened in late April 2017. Film history In January 1950, scenes for the film Operation Haylift were shot at the Hotel Nevada, which also served as headquarters for the cast and crew. Scenes for the 2008 film, My Blueberry Nights, were shot at Hotel Nevada. The hotel's interior and exterior are also featured in the 2009 film, Play Dead. Celebrity guests, memorabilia and murals The hotel's entrance features a walk of fame sidewalk for the celebrities who have stayed there. Notable Hotel Nevada guests include Ingrid Bergman, Gary Cooper, Veronica Cooper, U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson, Ray Milland, Hoot Gibson, Mickey Rooney, Tennessee Ernie Ford, Senator Harry Reid, Charlie Rich, Stephen King, Evel Knievel, and Pretty Boy Floyd. Celebrities such as Hank Thompson, Vikki Carr, Wanda Jackson, and The Ink Spots have entertained at the hotel, as well as Wayne Newton. Pat Nixon, who was born in Ely, made her only known visit to the city on September 16, 1952, appearing at a campaign rally outside the hotel with her husband, vice-presidential candidate Richard Nixon. A star with Pat Nixon's name is included on the hotel's walk of fame. Photos of the hotel's famous visitors were displayed on walls throughout the building, while the casino's walls featured 200 photographs of the White Pine County area and a collection of old guns. Other various memorabilia and antiques were featured throughout the building, including taxidermy animals. In August 1965, a slab of the Prometheus tree was put on display in the hotel's lobby; by 1998, it had been moved to the city's convention center. Other memorabilia included wagon wheel chandeliers, motorcycles, Roy Rogers memorabilia, miniature mechanized dioramas, and a life-sized hand-carved statue of actor John Wayne. Woywood, who gathered all the memorabilia and unique furnishings, said the building was \\"like a museum with no theme.\\" Much of the memorabilia was removed after Gaughan's purchase of the hotel. The hotel's donkey mural in 2012. In the 1930s, a large mural of a donkey dressed as a cowboy was painted on the hotel's east exterior wall. It was the largest mural in the entire state at the time. By 1997, the donkey mural had been restored by Stephanie Bruegeman, an art teacher who also worked at Hotel Nevada as a secretary. In 1999, local artist Larry Bute painted 7-by-12-foot murals on the building's exterior, depicting 19th century cowboys in a saloon. Bute also spent a week painting murals in each hotel hallway on each floor. The casino floor also received a mural.

Her research helps develop farming techniques that improve how we raise cattle for meat and milk, while reducing the environmental impacts of livestock production.http://innovationcanada150.ca/2016/05/karen-beauchemin-cattle- nutrition-and-greenhouse-gases/ The work of Beauchemin and her colleagues, has led to Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada being recognized as a world leader in measuring greenhouse gases and in developing strategies to reduce emissions from agricultural activities including from livestock production. Beauchemin has been recognized with awards from the Canadian Society of Animal Science, American Dairy Science Association, the Chinese Academy of Science, and the Royal Swedish Academy of Agriculture and Forestry in Stockholm, Sweden. Biography Beauchemin was born in 1956 in Montreal, Quebec. She was raised in Nova Scotia until the age of 10, and then moved with her family to Quebec. During her formative years, she developed an interest in food and nutrition, which led her to pursue a career in animal science. Beauchemin obtained a BSc in agriculture with honours at McGill University (1978), an MSc in animal nutrition at Université de Laval (1982), and a PhD in ruminant nutrition with distinction at the University of Guelph (1988).She married Sean McGinn in 1983, and together they have two daughters. She and her husband reside in Lethbridge, Alberta. Career Before starting her PhD, Beauchemin spent several years in the feed industry as a Beef and Dairy Cattle Nutritionist for a large feed manufacturer, where she gained an appreciation of the practical aspects of ruminant nutrition. She began her research career as a scientist at Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada’s Lethbridge Research Centre in Alberta in 1988. She was quickly promoted throughout her career, eventually achieving the top level of research scientist (RES5) in 2005. She is also an adjunct professor at the University of Alberta, the University of Saskatchewan, Utah State University, and a former adjunct professor at the University of British Columbia. She often credits her many scientific achievements over the years to the contributions of many enthusiastic and talented technicians, students, and post-doctoral fellows, as well as to collaborations with other very capable scientists. In the early stages of her career, Beauchemin's research focused mainly on dairy cattle nutrition, but in later years her interests widened to include both beef and dairy cattle. She worked on various aspects of nutrition over the years and made many outstanding contributions to the dairy and beef industries in the area of rumen function and feed utilization. Beauchemin developed a broad based research program to improve feed utilization of cattle, with specific interests in the areas of rumen function and feed digestion, acidosis prevention, physically effective fiber, forage and grain utilization, and enteric methane mitigation. Beauchemin's research in the area of rumen function has led to guidelines that minimize ruminal acidosis in dairy cows and feedlot cattle, while maintaining high levels of animal production. She studied the dietary factors that contribute to subacute ruminal acidosis, as well as the role of physically effective fiber in stimulating rumen function and digestion. The results from these studies have contributed to dietary fiber recommendations for cattle. Beauchemin is also internationally recognized for her work in the area of improving the utilization of forages by ruminants through the use of feed enzyme technology and other feed additives. The focus of her work has been to identify the mechanisms of action whereby enzymes improve feed digestion, such that feed enzymes that ensure positive and consistent results can be developed for the cattle industry. More recently, Beauchemin extended her research to examine the larger environmental aspects of cattle farming. Her research looks at the impact of ruminant production systems on greenhouse gas emissions, with the aim of developing strategies to reduce the enteric methane that is produced by cattle as a byproduct of digesting fiber. Her research is leading to novel nutritional approaches that improve air quality and lessen the environmental footprint of the livestock sector. In addition to curbing greenhouse gas emissions, reducing methane produced during feed digestion improves the efficiency by which dairy cows and beef cattle convert plant material into food (milk and meat) for people. In 2011, Beauchemin was awarded the Bertebos Prize, a prestigious award from the Royal Swedish Academy of Agriculture and Forestry, for her work on curbing methane emissions. Beauchemin used the prize money to establish a scholarship fund at the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology in Kumasi, Ghana to promote the education of women. So far, the scholarship has been awarded to three female graduate students pursuing graduate degrees in animal science. Beauchemin served as an invited member of the Committee on Nutrient Requirements of Beef Cattle, National Academy of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine. The committee recently published the 8th Revised edition of the Nutrient Requirements of Beef Cattle, which is the feeding guidelines for beef cattle in North America.As the sole Canadian invited member, her contributions to the Nutrient Requirements of Beef Cattle, helped ensure that the publication was also suitable for Canadian conditions. Today this is universally used by nutritionists, veterinarians, and feed regulators such as the Canadian Food Inspection Agency. Throughout her career, Dr. Beauchemin has served on numerous international beef industry committees including the Global Research Alliance (GRA) on Greenhouse Gases and the European Research Council: Advanced Grant. She is also a member of the Science Advisory Committee for the Canadian Roundtable for Sustainable Beef, which works to ensure that the Canadian beef industry remains competitive and sustainable. Since 1984, Beauchemin has been an active member of the American Dairy Science Association, the American Society of Animal Science, and the Canadian Society of Animal Science (past-president, 2000–01). Throughout her career, Beauchemin has published a total of 16 book chapters, 21 authoritative reviews, 390 peer-reviewed scientific papers, with many of these papers published in high impact journals, and more than 850 technology transfer articles, abstracts, conference proceedings, and presentations.

She led the rose-breeding program at the Central Experimental Farm in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada (now Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada) for nearly 25 years. She developed the Explorer Rose Series named in honour of Canadian explorers. Many of her roses also thrive in Finland, Russia, Iceland, Germany and Austria. Biography Felicitas Svejda was born November 8, 1920 in Vienna, Austria. She obtained her Ph.D. in agricultural science in 1948 from the University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences (Hochschule fur Bodenkultur) in Vienna. She later moved to Canada in 1953 and settled in Ottawa, Ontario. She died on January 19, 2016 at the age of 95, in the city of Ottawa from brief complications following Alzheimer's disease. Career After graduation, Svejda remained at the university in Vienna where she worked as a research assistant in agricultural economics from 1947-1951. She then moved to Sweden to work at the Swedish Association of Seed Selection for a year. When she moved to Canada she worked for the federal government's Department of Agriculture (now Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada) as a statistician in the cereal division from 1953-1961 before accepting the position in ornamental plant breeding. The Canadian Explorer Rose series, developed by Svejda, made the Central Experimental Farm famous for rose breeding by creating a plant both hardy and recurrently blooming. In 1961 she reactivated the rose breeding program in Ottawa aimed to develop completely winter-hardy, recurrent-flowering varieties. She also sought varieties resistant to black spot and mildew, and ones with good ornamental features of flower and shrub.T.H. Anstey, Agriculture Canada One Hundred Harvests, Research Branch, Agriculture Canada, 1886-1986. Research Branch, Agriculture Canada, Horticulture Series No. 27, 1986. p. 252-256 The rose varieties available in Canada in 1961 could not survive without winter protection outside the warmer conditions of southern Ontario (Niagara Peninsula) and the coast of British Columbia. Armed with patience and determination, Svejda managed to succeed in developing a first variety with these characteristics after 8 years. In 1968 she launched the first national trial of ornamental shrubs in Canada whereby she sent her roses and other plants to locations across North America to test their survival rates in local climates. The Explorer rose series includes 25 different varieties released between 1968 and 1999; 13 developed during her career, the remainder developed by the program after her retirement. The Explorer Roses are winter hardy, recurrent- flowering, disease-resistant plants that have made their way into park gardens and backyards all over Canada. Some of the hardier cultivars are also grown in Finland, Russia, Iceland, Germany and her homeland of Austria, and have been adapted by others for harsh climates such as the Nevada desert. The Explorer Roses include: Alexander Mackenzie, Captain Samuel Holland, Champlain (a bush rose that flowers throughout the summer and fall), Charles Albanel, David Thompson, De Montarville, Frontenac, George Vancouver, Henry Hudson, Henry Kelsey, J.P. Connell, Jens Munk, John Cabot (released in 1977, a climber with vigorous arching branches bearing a profusion of media red, slightly fragrant clusters of 7-10 flowers), John David, Lambert Closse, Louis Jolliet, Marie- Victorin, Martin Frobisher (released in 1968, vigorous, fragrant, pink- flowered, hardy, disease-resistant, free-flowering), Nicholas, Quadra, Royal Edward, Simon Fraser, William Baffin (released in 1983), and William Booth. She also worked with ornamental shrubs; five weigelias named after dances [Minuet, Rumba, Samba, Tango and Polka], robust forsythias Northern Gold and Happy Centennial, and three mock oranges including Buckley's Quill. Honours and awards Svejda received several awards and recognitions. She received a certificate of merit from the Royal National Rose Society of Great Britain (1985) and the Canadian Ornamental Plant Foundation (1999), the prestigious Portland Gold Medal (2004), and an honorary Doctorate of Science from York University, Toronto (2000) for her scientific career and contributions to ornamental horticulture. She was also the honorary patron of the Canadian Rose Society. The \\"Explorer Rose Garden\\" was planted in 2005 at the Central Experimental Farm in Ottawa to proudly display the results of her research. It combines plants from the original collection as well as more recent varieties. Svejda was a special guest at the official opening ceremony. In 2010, she generously donated her personal records, correspondence, and library to the Montreal Botanical Garden Library.

Launch and deployment It is a CubeSat satellite, placed in orbit by Arianespace with Soyuz Booster, VS14 flight, on April 25, 2016 at 21:02 GMT (23:02 CEST) from Europe's spaceport in Kourou, French Guiana . The main payload of the launch was Sentinel-1B from program Copernicus and Microscope designed by the CNES, the French space agency. In addition to e-st@r-II there was other two CubeSats 1U (AAUSAT 4, .htm OUFTI 1) they were packed aboard the Soyuz. These small satellites, each measuring just 10 × 10 × 11 cm in height, have been developed by teams of university students through ESA programs. E-st@r-II is the successor of e-st@r, the first Italian CubeSat and the first CubeSat of the Polytechnic University of Turin. More than 30 students have been working on this project, with the unique opportunity of practical experience of space applications. E-st@r-II is a 1U CubeSat developed for demonstrating the autonomous active attitude control capabilities based on magnetic actuation: in fact, the payload is an Active Attitude Determination and Control System. The commissioning phase foresees that the payload is deactivated leaving the satellite in its free tumbling motion, without any attitude stabilization. The A-ADCS starts its work when commanded from GCS, controlling the angular velocities and the attitude of the satellite. The primary scientific objectives of e-st@r-II mission are: * to demonstrate the capability of autonomous determination, control and manoeuver, through the development and test in orbit of an A-ADCS entirely designed and manufactured by students * to test in orbit COTS technology and self-made hardware E-st@r-II is a follow-on of e-st@r-I, the first Italian CubeSat and the first satellite of Politecnico di Torino to be inserted on orbit. More than 30 students worked on this project, using a unique opportunity of hands-on experience on space applications. It will demonstrate the ability of determining (with gyros and magnetometers) and actively controlling its attitude. The bus functionalities, as a basis for other CubeSats, will be demonstrated: it is a step towards future missions and applications. Currently the team that developed the satellite, the CubeSatTeam of Politecnico di Torino, is actively working on the development of the Next model: 3-STAR, a 3U CubeSat. Communications Issues Once deployed into orbit, e-st@r-II was designed to begin transmitting signals to Earth approximately 30 minutes after activation. Signals could be picked up by anyone with common amateur radio equipment. To celebrate the launch of this second CubeSat, members of the world amateur radio community were invited in a contest to listen for the satellite. While transmissions from the satellite were received by multiple ground stations following deployment, the received signal was not strong enough for either radio amateurs or the satellite's dedicated ground station to demodulate. An analysis of the received signal strength gave figures up to 15 dB lower than what was estimated from pre-launch link budget calculations. Ground tests using prototype hardware and flight spares were able to determine that the antenna likely did deploy correctly and the probable cause of the discrepancy was attributed to improper assembly of the satellite's RF hardware, leading to a large degree of mismatch loss. Ultimately, stations employing high-gain antennas were able to demodulate e-st@r-II's transmitted data packets and the error did not constitute a mission failure.

His work explores the longstanding relationship between photography and science and combines classical and contemporary photographic techniques. He is currently an assistant professor of photography at Central Washington University in Ellensburg, Washington.Marcus DeSieno, {http://www.marcusdesieno.com/pagecv}  Early life and education  DeSieno received his Degree in Documentary Studies/Documentary Photography from the Salt Institute for Documentary Studies in 2008 and his Bachelor of Arts from Marlboro College, where he focused on Photography, in 2010. He went on to complete his Masters in Fine Arts in Studio Art at the University of South Florida in 2015.  Work  DeSieno’s works include several collections of photographs, including Surveillance Landscapes, Mars, Self-Portraits, Parasites, and Cosmos. DeSieno uses antiquated photographic processes along with contemporary imaging methods to explore how the invention of photography has shaped our perception of nature and the universe around us. = Cosmos Series = To create his works for Cosmos, DeSieno collected various strains of bacteria from public and private places, such as ATM machines, iPhone screens, toilet seats, saliva, and human orifices, and bred them on surfaces of film depicting scenes from outer space originally taken by Hubble, NASA, and the European Space Agency (ESA). He then scanned the film, killing the microscopic ecosystem, after it had been partially eaten away by the bacteria. Examples of titles of the works in the series include A Photograph of the Reticulum Constellation Eaten by Bacteria Found on My Television’s Remote, A Photograph of the Crab Nebula Eaten by Bacteria Found on a Table at a Red Lobster Restaurant, and A Photograph of the Planet Venus Eaten by Bacteria Found Inside of a Vagina. Uniting microscopic organisms with infinite galaxies, DeSieno states in an interview with FeatureShoot that “Cosmos ultimately refutes mankind’s dominion over the universe as much as it strives to affirm it, and the bacteria become an allegory for the fragility of human life. We, like the microbes, flicker in and out of existence, and if we’re lucky, we leave something beautiful behind”. DeSieno attributes his inspiration for his work to three notions. The first is a lifelong fascination with the invisible. As a child, he would place everything under the lens of the microscope his parents gave him. The second is a desire to interrogate photographic materiality in an age of digital uniformity. The third is an exploration and confrontation with his childhood fears of bacteria and germs. = Parasites Series = In his making of Parasites, DeSieno combined classical and cutting-edge photographic techniques. He captured images of microscopic organisms that dwell in the human body obtained through the National Institutes of Health (NIH), microscopy laboratories at the University of South Florida, and Etsy. DeSieno first dehydrated the dead organisms and viewed them under a scanning electron microscope (SEM). He then used images collected from the SEM to print a digital negative, which was exposed to a dry plate gelatin process ferrotype. The ferrotype was scanned, enlarged, and printed at four-foot length prints. In an interview with National Geographic's Proof, DeSieno articulates his belief that \\"photo and science have had an intrinsic relationship since its conception—the founding mothers and fathers of photo were all scientists themselves. My practice is really driven by curiosity, which is at the heart of scientific inquiry. I’d like to hope that my work can light an inquisitive spark in my viewer that allows them to explore their own wonders and fears”. = Surveillance Landscape Series = To create the images for \\"Surveillance Landscapes\\", DeSieno taps into surveillance cameras from around the world. The artist is interested in pushing our understanding of privacy in the \\"surveillance state\\" by using empty landscapes as a metaphor to show that we are never truly alone.9  Exhibitions  DeSieno has had solo exhibitions entitled Parasites at Gallery 501 and Invisible Monster: Parasites at the Vermont Center for Photography. His work has also been exhibited nationally at the Aperture Foundation in New York, The Center for Fine Art Photography in Fort Collins, Colorado; the Fort Wayne Museum of Art in Indiana; and Rayko Photo Center in San Francisco, among others.

History =Formation and Too Close to Touch (2012–2014)= In an interview with Highlight Magazine, guitarist Mason Marble stated that though the band first started playing together in 2012, he and drummer Kenny Downey had been playing together since 2008. \\"Kenny and I have been playing together for about seven years now. We just started jamming out in his basement—Improv kind of stuff. Eventually we started getting into constructing songs, which was when we decided to look for people to start a band. We had a bunch of different people who would come and go, and Kenny and I would just carry on. Eventually we met Travis. We began playing with him consistently. Then, through mutual friends we got in contact with Keaton, who lived four hours away at the time... Then, Thomas actually sought us out. He was looking for bands in the area after just moving from Tucson, Az. to Kentucky, so we brought him up to Lexington one weekend to the studio to see what he had going on. Everything just sort of fit.\\" The band had been \\"shopping the record out\\" with multiple labels before finally being signed to Epitaph in 2014. Their label debut, the eponymous EP Too Close to Touch, was released digitally on October 21, 2014. Upon release it was met with generally positive reviews. The band supported Emarosa on their CD Release Tour alongside PVRIS and Sink the Ship. =Nerve Endings and Haven't Been Myself (2015–2017)= They worked with producer Erik Ron on their full-length debut, Nerve Endings. Of the album, Pierce said, \\"It's an album with a message. It's an album that any instrument that you hear played, every vocal on the record is full of emotion and purpose. I guess it's just exciting showing the world our message. Not to sound cliché, but I want it to help people. It's a very brutally honest record. I opened up about a lot of stuff that I've never talked about before the album. I want to be able to change people like they changed me\\". Since the album's release the band has toured extensively in support. In March 2015 they accompanied I Prevail on their The Heart vs Mind Tour with Chasing Safety. That summer they supported I the Mighty on their Connector Tour with fellow opening acts Hail the Sun. In November 2015, the band supported Hands Like Houses on the North American leg of their Dissonants Tour. The band released a new track \\"Heavy Hearts\\" for free download on February 12, 2016.

About the 3-song series, the band said on their Facebook, \\"It explores the abrupt absence of someone you care about in life — be it romantic or otherwise. First comes the initial moment of clarity; realizing you're better off without them. Next comes the relapse; you can't get them out of your head, questioning if you ever had control in the first place. Lastly, finding yourself wanting nothing more than to rid your memories of what’s left and leave it all behind. I’ll leave you lonely before I cave in and watch us burn.\\" On April 17, 2018, the band released a statement confirming that they had parted ways with lead guitarist Thomas Kidd and bassist Travis Moore, and would continue as a trio for the foreseeable future.

Marble has said of the band's sound and image, \\"From day one we always have been a band where we knew what we wanted to do. We've always written music that we wanted to write—never conforming to a specific genre. Not to say we don’t have influences. We definitely do. It's just more meaningful for us to write without boundaries. We didn't have to conform to any sort of style. We write the music that makes us feel something.\\" Writing for AllMusic, James Christopher Monger described the band as, \\"a post hardcore quintet with a knack for infusing might with melody... offering up an explosive mix of indie rock, cool, and punk blasted emo pop energy in the vein of Sleeping with Sirens and The 1975. The band have honed their chops on the road with like- minded rockers Emarosa and A Lot Like Birds\\".

He played three first-class matches for the Otago cricket team after the beginning of World War II, but he is most noted as a paediatrician and an historian. He served as director of medical services for the Plunket Society from 1956 to 1977, and, with his brother Charles, wrote four books on the history of Fiordland. He chaired the New Zealand Historic Places Trust between 1978 and 1986. Early life and family Born in Dunedin on 13 April 1915, Begg was the younger son of surgeon Charles Mackie Begg and Lillian Helen Lawrance Begg (née Treadwell), and nephew of Robert Campbell Begg. His father served throughout World War I, becoming the senior medical officer with the New Zealand Expeditionary Force, but contracted influenza and pneumonia and died at Twickenham, London, in February 1919. Begg and his mother and brother, who had travelled to England at the end of the war, then returned to New Zealand. Begg was educated at John McGlashan College in Dunedin, and then studied medicine at the University of Otago, graduating MB ChB in 1941. A tall man, Begg was an all-round sportsman, and represented the university at cricket, golf and skiing. On 11 April 1942, Begg married Margaret Milne \\"Margot\\" MacLean, a librarian, at Dunedin. She was a granddaughter of John Shand, one of the foundation professors of the University of Otago. The couple went on to have four children. World War II service In February 1941, Begg was commissioned as a lieutenant in the New Zealand Medical Corps, and posted to the Otago University Medical Company. He went on to serve in the Middle East, Italy and the United Kingdom with the 2nd New Zealand Expeditionary Force, rising to the rank of major. Cricket A right-arm medium pace bowler and a tail-end batsman, Begg played three first- class matches for Otago in the 1939/40 and 1940/41 seasons. He took five wickets, at an average of 47.60, with best bowling figures of 2 for 43. With the bat, he made a total of 30 runs in four innings including one not out, with a high score of 16 and an average of 10.00. Begg played one match for New Zealand Services, on 12 July 1945, against P.F. Warner's XI at Lord's, bowling 11 overs without success and scoring 1 not out with the bat. Medical career Between 1946 and 1948, Begg trained in paediatrics in London, Edinburgh and Stockholm, earning a diploma in child health in 1947, and membership of the Royal College of Physicians and the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh in 1948. Returning to Dunedin the following year, he was appointed as a paediatrician at Dunedin Public Hospital, Queen Mary Maternity Hospital, and the Karitane-Harris Hospitial in Andersons Bay. He was also a lecturer in paediatrics at the Otago Medical School from 1949 to 1976. An admirer of Sir Truby King, Begg served as medical director of the Plunket Society between 1956 and 1977, and was a leading advocate for preventive medicine. He campaigned for the fluoridation of public water supplies, the eradication of hydatids and bovine tuberculosis, and the development of a milk biscuit for protein-deprived children in developing countries. Between 1971 and 1976 he served as the medical advisor to the New Zealand Food Bank, which distributed the biscuits overseas. His parental reference book, The New Zealand child and his family, was published in 1970. Begg gave service to various professional bodies, as president of the Paediatric Society of New Zealand, chair of the council of the New Zealand branch of the British Medical Association from 1964 to 1966, and president of the New Zealand Medical Association in 1974. Historian Begg and his brother Charles became experts on the history of Fiordland. Their first book, Dusky Bay, was published in 1966 and won the Hubert Church Memorial Award for prose. This was followed by the publication of James Cook and New Zealand in 1969, Port Preservation in 1973, and The World of John Boultbee in 1979. He served on the council of the New Zealand Historic Places Trust from 1970 to 1978, and as the trust's chair between 1978 and 1986. Honours Begg was elected a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh in 1957, the New Zealand Medical Association in 1976, and the Royal College of Physicians in 1977. In the 1972 New Year Honours, Begg was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire, for services to the community. He was promoted to Knight Commander of the same order, for services to the New Zealand Historic Places Trust and the community, in the 1986 New Year Honours. Death Begg died at his home in the Dunedin suburb of Maori Hill on 25 June 1995. His wife died in Dunedin in 2006.

Racing as a two-year-old in 2015, he won three of his six starts including the Saratoga Special Stakes and the Delta Jackpot Stakes as well as finishing second in the Breeders' Futurity and fourth in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile. The following spring, he finished second in the San Vicente Stakes and third in the San Felipe Stakes before establishing himself as a contender for the 2016 Kentucky Derby with a six length win in the Santa Anita Derby. After finishing second to Nyquist in the Derby, he turned the tables to win the 2016 Preakness Stakes. He ran poorly in the Belmont Stakes but defeated Nyquist again in the Haskell Invitational. Tactically, Exaggerator was a \\"closer\\" – one who prefers to come from behind in his races. Background Exaggerator is a dark bay or brown colt with a small white star and a white sock on his right hind leg. Bred in Kentucky by Joseph B Murphy, he is from the fourth crop of foals sired by the 2007 Preakness Stakes and Breeders' Cup Classic winner Curlin, whose other offspring have included Palace Malice and Keen Ice. Exaggerator's dam Dawn Raid showed some good form as a two-year-old in 2007, winning two races and finishing third in the Fanfreluche Stakes. She was a great-granddaughter of Bon Debarras, whose other descendants have included the Queen's Plate winner Niigon. Exaggerator was foaled at Stoneleigh Farm, where his nickname was \\"Buster.\\" At Stoneleigh, he was well-liked by the staff, reputed to be a well- mannered colt in training, but playful in the pasture, where he would throw a horse toy \\"Jolly Ball\\" over the fence at passers-by, hoping they would throw it back in a game of fetch. The yearling colt was consigned to the Keeneland sale in September 2014 as Hip 1473 and bought for $110,000 by Big Chief Racing. After the 2015 Breeders' Cup, the owner of Big Chief Racing, Matt Bryan, brought additional partners into ownership of the horse. A 20 percent share is held by Sol Kumin under the business name Head of Plains Partners. Kumin is also noted as the owner of the mare Lady Eli. Another significant share in the partnership is held by Rocker O Ranch, owned by Ronny Ortoski. Prior to the Kentucky Derby, WinStar Farm announced that it had acquired the breeding rights to Exaggerator. During his racing career Exaggerator was trained by J. Keith Desormeaux. His regular jockey was his trainer's younger brother, Kent Desormeaux. Racing career =2015: two-year-old career= Exaggerator began his racing career by finishing fifth behind Nyquist in a five-furlong maiden race at Santa Anita Park on June 5. On July 26 at Del Mar Racetrack Exaggerator started favorite for a maiden over six furlongs and recorded his first success, coming from well off the pace to take the lead in the final stride and win by a nose from Miner's Light. The colt was then stepped up in class for the Grade II Saratoga Special Stakes over six and a half furlongs at Saratoga Race Course. Racing for the first time outside California his final preparation for the race was handled by Desormeaux's assistant Julie Clark and he was ridden by Junior Alvarado. He raced at the rear of the six-runner field before producing a sustained run along the rail to take the lead inside the final furlong and won by three-quarters of a length from the favored Saratoga Mischief. After the race Clark commented that Exaggerator \\"showed some real class for a baby\\". On October 3 Exaggerator started favorite for the Grade I Breeders' Futurity over eight and a half furlongs at Keeneland. After tracking the leaders he took the lead in the stretch but was overtaken in closing stages and finished second, beaten a length by Brody's Cause. Four weeks later, over the same course and distance, Exaggerator was one of fourteen colts to contest the Breeders' Cup Juvenile. After tracking the leaders he stayed on in the stretch without ever looking likely to win and finished fourth behind Nyquist, Swipe and Brody's Cause, beaten three lengths by the winner. On his final appearance of the season, Exaggerator started favorite for the Delta Downs Jackpot Stakes run on November 21 on a muddy track at Delta Downs in Louisiana. The best fancied of his rivals was Sunny Ridge, who had finished runner-up in the Champagne Stakes. Exaggerator took the lead after a quarter mile and fought off a sustained challenge from Sunny Ridge to win by a neck. Commenting on the colt as a potential Kentucky Derby contender Keith Desormeaux said \\"He's bred for it. He has the precociousness and the athleticism for it.\\" =2016: three- year-old career= Exaggerator winning the Preakness Exaggerator began his second season in the Grade II San Vicente Stakes at Santa Anita on February 15. He came from off the pace and finished strongly but was beaten one and a half lengths into second place by Nyquist. Up to this point the colt tended to run as a \\"stalker\\", staying close to the pace. After the San Vicente, Desormeax changed tactics and began training him to colt fall back and come from behind, making him a \\"closer\\". In the San Felipe Stakes on March 12 Exaggerator started second favorite behind Mor Spirit, a Bob Baffert-trained colt who had won the Los Alamitos Futurity and the Robert B. Lewis Stakes on his last two starts. He challenged for the lead on the final turn but finished third behind the wire-to-wire winner Danzing Candy with Mor Spirit taking second. Exaggerator faced Danzing Candy and Mor Spirit again in the Grade I Santa Anita Derby on April 9 and started third choice in the betting at odds of 3.4/1. Racing on a sloppy track, Exaggerator trailed the field in the early stages as Danzing Candy set the pace but began to make rapid progress half a mile from the finish. He drew alongside the leaders on the final turn and quickly went clear of the field to win by six and a quarter lengths from Mor Spirit with Uncle Lino taking third ahead of the tiring Danzing Candy. Kent Desormeaux commented \\"He was the fourth horse that I rode in the mud today and the others felt like they had ice skates on: Exaggerator felt like he had track shoes on. He really liked the going and I think that was part of his incredible effort today. He enjoyed the mud\\". On May 7 Exaggerator started second favorite in a twenty-runner field for the 2016 Kentucky Derby. Racing on a fast surface he was towards the rear of the field until he began to overtake horses in the last half mile. He made a strong challenge in the straight but was unable to overhaul the favored Nyquist and finished second, beaten one and a quarter lengths. On May 21 Exaggerator started second favourite behind Nyquist for the Preakness Stakes at Pimlico Race Course, with the lightly-raced Stradivari the best-fancied of the other nine runners. On a rainy day, and a sloppy but sealed track, Kent Desormeaux restrained the colt well behind the very fast pace set by Nyquist and Uncle Lino. Exaggerator began to make progress on the inside approaching the final turn before being switched to the outer to make his challenge in the straight. He overtook Nyquist approaching the final furlong and drew away in the closing stages to win by three and a half lengths. The outsider Cherry Wine, who had hit his head on the starting gate and was second-to-last for much of the race finished strongly to deprive Nyquist of second by a nose. After the race the winning jockey commented \\"I had a dream trip today. I was on the fence and they all stayed wide. With these turns you want to paint the fence. We did, they didn't... knowledge is power\\". Explaining the colt's light training regimen since the Derby, Keith Desormeaux said: \\"My philosophy was to take it as easy as possible because you're not going to gain any fitness in those two weeks. I did what I could to get him happy and fresh and strong\\". After an 11th-place finish in the G1 Belmont Stakes on June 11 Exaggerator returned to the races in the G1 Haskell Invitational at Monmouth Park on July 31. Over a sloppy track, Exaggerator bested American Freedom to win the race in a final time of 1:48:70. \\"It was a reminder of the Preakness. … I just tried to bide my time\\", Desormeaux said after trailing by 8 1/2 lengths at the half-mile pole. \\"He really exploded at the quarter pole … rode right off my fingertips. Exceptional race horse.\\" In the Travers Stakes on a fast track at Saratoga on 27 August Exaggerator started favorite but was never in contention and finished eleventh of the thirteen runners behind Arrogate. Retirement On October 10, 2016 it was announced that Exaggerator had been retired from racing. Starting in 2017, he stands as a breeding stallion at WinStar Farm in Kentucky. His first foals will be of racing age in 2020.

Edward Mateusz Jan Oktawiusz Römer (Belarusian: Эдвард Матэй Ромер; 19 September 1848, Vologda - 10 February 1900, Lunna) was a Baltic-German/Polish painter who spent much of his career in what is now Belarus. His brother was the sculptor and painter, Alfred Izydor Römer and his father was Edward Jan Römer, a noted writer and social activist.Entry @ Geni.com Biography He was born in Vologda, where his father had been exiled for supporting the radical politician, Szymon Konarski. In 1852, they returned home, to Vilnius, and he began his art studies; first with his father (who was an amateur painter), then with Kanuty Rusiecki.Brief biography @ Rodovid. After finishing his public school education in 1867, he enrolled at the Dresden Academy of Fine Arts, then transferred to the Academy of Fine Arts, Munich in 1870, where he studied with Hermann Anschütz and Arthur von Ramberg. Some of his drawings appeared in the Illustrirte Zeitung. In 1873, he had a showing at an exhibit held by the Kraków Society of Friends of Fine Arts and later won a silver medal at an exposition in Lwów. Five years later, he opened a studio in Vilnius, which he shared with his brother Alfred.

It was the largest national distributor that focused on providing janitorial products with revenues over $300 million. It was merged with four brands of Interline Brands forming a new brand called SupplyWorks. History AmSan logo on an Interline Brands delivery truck. In the 1990s AmSan became a conglomerate by buying 44 independent janitor and sanitary distributors. Some of AmSan's acquisitions are AmSan Eve, AmSan Vonachen-Elton, AmSan Nogg Chemical & Paper, and AmSan West. In 2002 Michael Mulhern became CEO of AmSan. Mulhern moved the headquarters of AmSan from Raleigh, North Carolina to Chicago, Illinois. Under Mulhern AmSan underwent a series of reforms dedicated to increasing profitability. AmSan turned over 40% of its top 35 executives, downsized its office operations and downsized under-performing distribution centers. AmSan created its own line of products with Renown. Renown represented 20% of AmSan's total revenue. By 2005 AmSan had revenues totalling $300 million. American Capital invested $25 million in the recapitalization of AmSan in 2005. Interline Brands acquired AmSan in May 2006 for $127.5 million. AmSan West, which has operations in Sacramento and Los Angeles, was not acquired by Interline Brands. In 2008 AmSan established a sales and distribution territory in Columbus, Cleveland, Pittsburgh, Atlanta and Nashville. In 2009 a showroom and walk-in store was established in Fort Myers, Florida.

Plot Husband-and-wife team Sam and Remi Fargo are asked by a colleague to help with an underwater archaeological project on Guadalcanal in the Solomon Islands. An ancient underwater complex is found just off the coast. The process of uncovering the ruins brings more questions than answers. This is a location where no known advanced civilization supposedly existed. Besides that someone has been to the site before and there is evidence the valuable items that were there have been removed. A clue points to the Japanese who occupied the site in World War II. Sam and Remi look to the scant evidence to find answers as to where the gold and gems from the ruined complex ended up. Their efforts seem to upset a group of rebels, who make attempts to stop the excavation and to kill anyone, including Sam and Remi, who has any information or starts poking around. Added to all this are legends about the area around the ruins being cursed, legends about giants and unexplained disappearances of islanders over the years.

Launched after the release of Sandberg's bestselling book, Lean In: Women, Work, and the Will to Lead, the organization views itself as the next step in an effort to change \\"the conversation from what we can’t do to what we can do.\\" Since its launch, over 380,000 women and men have joined the Lean In community, creating 34,000 Lean In Circles in over 157 countries to date. The organization is also responsible for annual national campaigns such as #BanBossy and #LeanInTogether, which were designed to accomplish Lean In's goals and establish partnerships. The Lean In Foundation also develops an annual Women in the Workplace Survey in conjunction with McKinsey & Company, which examines female leadership and diversity management across organizations in corporate America.  Background and mission  The Lean In Foundation was formed in response to the success of Sandberg's book, Lean In: Women, Work, and the Will to Lead. The proceeds from book sales went toward funding the nonprofit.  Circles  Lean In Circles are communities of peers who “meet regularly to learn and grow together.” Circles were originally designed to have 8 to 12 peers who would meet monthly. Although each circle varies in location and size, all Circles provide robust networks of peer support. Circles frequently involve facilitated discussion on gender issues between both women and men. After a year of operation, there were 14,000 Lean in Circles around the world. To date, over 34,000 Lean In Circles have been created in over 157 countries, and 85% of circle members accredit Lean In Circles for a \\"positive change in their life.\\" = CSE = Lean in Computer Science and Engineering Chapter supports women studying computer science and engineering. Founded in collaboration with The Anita Borg Institute, Facebook, and Linkedin, to date, there are over 250 Circles and 6,000 members. In summer 2015, chapter members launched a “Lean IN-terns Program” for students interning at Bay Area tech companies. = Military = The Lean In Military Chapter launched in September 2015 in partnership with the Department of Defense. Within just one year, the chapter grew to over 100 circles and nearly 2000 members. This Chapter includes all branches of the military. = Veterans = On May 21, 2016, National Armed Forces Day, Lean In kicked off the launch of Veterans Circles by top influences like Michelle Obama, Sheryl Sandberg, and Senator Amy Klobuchar. The goal is to assimilate and integrate women veterans into civilian communities. = Partnerships = The Lean In Foundation Partnerships team is responsible for developing and maintaining strategic partnerships for the organizations as well as manage the Circles program. In February 2014, the nonprofit partnered with Getty Images to offer a collection of images that represent women in empowering ways.  Women in the Workplace Survey  The Women in the Workplace Survey is a comprehensive study conducted by LeanIn.org and McKinsey & Company on current statistics of working women at corporate American companies. The first study was conducted in 2015, building on similar McKinsey research in 2012, and studied more than 118 companies and 30,000 employees. The 2015 report concluded that in spite of modest improvements, women are still severely underrepresented at every level in the corporate company leadership pipeline, with the “greatest disparity at the senior levels of leadership” and lowest in technology and industrial companies.”.http://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/organization/our- insights/women-in-the-workplace The report disproves the belief that women are underrepresented in leadership because they are leaving companies at higher rates or because they cannot find a work-life balance. Instead, it explains that this disparity occurs because women face an uneven playing field, gender diversity not prioritized widely, and participation in work and family balance programs is low because of fears from both genders that doing so will negatively affect their careers. The key findings of the study include: The leadership ambition gap persists. Women experience an uneven playing field. Gender diversity is not widely believed to be a priority. Employee programs are abundant, but participation is low. There is still inequality at home. Men and women have very different networks. Based on the research conducted, it will take over 25 years to reach gender equity at the senior vice-president level of corporate companies and over 100 years to reach equity in the C-suite.  Campaigns  = Ban Bossy = The organization partnered with Girl Scouts of the USA on a public initiative to encourage girls leadership called Ban Bossy. Beyoncé, Jennifer Garner, Condoleezza Rice, Jane Lynch, Diane Von Furstenberg were featured in a promotional video for the project. The campaign suggested that use of the word discouraged women from achieving leadership positions––arguing that when a boy asserts himself, he is recognized as a leader, but in the same scenario when a girl asserts herself, she risks being called as “bossy.” The campaign included pledges to #banbossy, along with a website including education guides and leadership tips to ban bossy in action. Beyoncé stated in the PSA that “girls are less interested in leadership than boys,” and Lynch who explained “and that’s because they worry about being called bossy.” These statements were backed up by Garner who stated that “being labeled something matters.” Beyoncé's closing quotation served as the basis for the campaign as she said “I’m not bossy, I’m the boss.” There was some backlash to the campaign. Joan Rivers found the movement petty, while Margot Talbot argued the campaign should have reclaimed the word instead of condemning it. = Lean In Together = In March 2015, a partnership with the NBA and WNBA was initiated to emphasize \\"how men benefit from equality and providing practical tips for men to do their part at home and at work.\\" = #20PercentCounts = In April 2017, the organization launched #20PercentCounts, a national campaign on Equal Pay Day to highlight the importance of closing the gender pay gap. Working with Lean In community leaders in more than 25 U.S. cities, the organization was able to recruit hundreds of businesses to offer 20% off purchases and share information on the gender pay gap in their communities. And In partnership with Funny or Die and Hulu, LeanIn.Org produced a video showing the impact of the pay gap on women's everyday lives, amassing more than 5 million views.  Criticism  An early criticism of Lean In came from Sandberg's advertisements for unpaid interns in 2013. Melissa Gira Grant in The Washington Post criticized the concept of the Lean In Circles. She was critical of the requirement to stay \\"positive\\" and that working-class women would be left out of the conversation. Some women have had trouble finding the right circle to fit their own needs and lifestyles. Other critics claim that Lean In is designed for \\"financially well-off women.\\" References Further reading *  External links * Category:Non-profit organizations based in California Category:Organizations established in 2013 Category:Organizations based in Palo Alto, California Category:2013 establishments in California ","title":"LeanIn.Org"},{"id":"50439436","text":"The Greeks and the Trojans Fighting over the Body of Patroclus is an oil painting by Antoine Wiertz.

Work From 22 April to 17 July 2016, the writer posted a science fiction horror story in short installments to apparently random Reddit discussion threads. The story, sometimes referred to by others as the Interface series, touches on such topics as \\"Vietnam, Elizabeth Bathory, the Treblinka concentration camp, humpback whales, the Manson Family and LSD\\", and particularly involves entities called \\"flesh interfaces\\". The story attracted media notice the day after its first parts were published. The Guardian, reporting on the story, described it as \\"compelling\\" and \\"gradually more beautifully and boldly written from multiple narrative perspectives\\". Vice mentioned the possibility of the whole thing being part of a viral marketing campaign for something yet unknown. An impromptu fandom collects information about the story in a subreddit and wiki. =Plot summary= The story features several loosely-interconnected narratives. Most individual narratives are linear, but the story jumps between them non-linearly. Early parts of the story focus on two main narratives: # The first one deals with attempts to create, understand and control interdimensional portals with the form of tunnels lined with human flesh, named \\"flesh interfaces\\", created by subjecting people to large doses of LSD. Flesh interfaces are first created in 1944 in Treblinka, and research about them is abandoned around the year 2020. # The second narrative takes place in 2039, with a large share of humanity spending their entire lives connected to virtual reality Internet feeds. An unknown entity named Q hijacks the Internet to take over the minds of humanity. It is hinted that Q has been empowered by the prior experimentation on flesh interfaces. The last survivor of a group dedicated to fight Q and her caretaker flee the nuclear bombing of Atlanta and, knowing that all their attempts to stop Q will be futile, start writing their life stories, trying to create another timeline in which Q is stopped. The later parts of the story deal with two more narratives: # In one of them, a young child is abducted by a supernatural entity made of animal body parts, including horse eyes, which names itself Mother. Mother makes his parents disappear, keeps him locked at his own house and forces him to perform magic for it. His magic doesn't let him escape, but eventually he uses it to bring his future self to his rescue. # The second narrative focuses on the experience of addiction through the eyes of Nick, a failed writer struggling with alcoholism and childhood trauma. The novel Nick claims to have written reflects the first parts of the story about flesh interfaces and Q. Eventually, Nick reveals that the abducted child is himself, and the experiences with Mother triggered both his writing and his alcoholism. He doubts his own sanity, but after his roommate narrates his own experience finding a flesh interface made of bones, he is convinced of the reality of his own experiences and tries to face and understand his past. He visits the flesh interface and unknowingly uses it to travel to the past. In the final scene of the story the two versions of Nick meet, as the older one makes peace with his past and the younger one is freed from Mother. It's hinted that Mother and Q are the same entity, and it's not clear if the rescue of Nick is part of a timeline in which Q is defeated. There are also some small side narratives. One of them culminates with the narrator being assimilated to a flesh interface, one of them seems to document how humans got the ability to create the interfaces and one of them seems to be a metaphor for humans not being able to comprehend flesh interfaces and Q. Identity In a later deleted post, the writer described himself as a \\"30-something American male\\", and indicated a history of substance abuse. However, this post also incorporated fictional elements of the story.

He is a Professor of Voice and Opera at the Bienen School of Music of Northwestern University, voice faculty for the Ryan Opera Center of Lyric Opera of Chicago, voice faculty emeritus of the Aspen Music Festival and School and founder/director of the Naked Voice Institute.  Early life  Smith was born in Jonesboro, Arkansas on December 18, 1950, the son of Buel Smith and Jolene (née Hooton). He was raised in Pocahontas, Arkansas and Corning, Arkansas. His father owned a nearby Ford dealership. As Smith’s father did not approve of his musical interests as a child, his first job was mowing a neighbor’s lawn every week in order to be able to afford to pay for piano lessons on his own. Education and early career After graduating as valedictorian from Corning High School in 1968, Smith attended Harding University, where he graduated with a B.A. in music in 1972. Smith’s voice teacher at Harding was Erle T. Moore. He continued at the University of Arkansas, studying voice with Richard Brothers and graduating with an M.M. in voice in 1975. He was then hired as a one-year sabbatical replacement choir director at Oklahoma Christian University, and remained on the faculty when a professorship was created for him the following year. His teaching responsibilities included voice lessons, music theory, musicianship and stage directing of student operas and musicals. During his first year at OC, he became interested in the pedagogy of Inez Lunsford Silberg, who taught voice at the nearby Oklahoma City University. Smith enrolled in OKCU’s M.P.A. program in opera performance, taking classes while continuing to serve on the faculty of OC, and graduating in 1981. He remained on the faculty of OC until 1987, when he was hired as the chair of the voice department of St. Louis Conservatory, a position he held until that institution closed in 1990. Career Smith was appointed to the faculty of Moores School of Music of the University of Houston in 1990. In 1991, he began instructing apprentice artists of the Houston Grand Opera Studio. In 1996, he joined the faculty of the Aspen Music Festival and School. In 1998, he was appointed to the faculty of The Juilliard School. He resigned from the University of Houston but retained his position with Houston Grand Opera, commuting weekly between New York and Houston until he resigned from Houston Grand Opera in 2003. In 2011, Smith joined the faculty of Northwestern University. Subsequent to his appointment, he founded the Naked Voice Institute, a summer program of Northwestern University that instructs students in his method of pedagogy. Prominent students Smith has instructed include Christine Brewer, Joyce DiDonato, Rod Gilfry, Brian Mulligan and Eric Owens. Pedagogy Since the early 19th century, vocal pedagogy has made use of the vocalise as a means to present to the student specific technical challenges with an aim to solving those challenges in order to make a sound of ever increasing quality and consistency. Smith’s pedagogy differs from this tradition in that he has developed a series of six vocalises, which he trains in sequence, that he has designed to first isolate two specific activities that produce vocal sound: phonation, as in conversational speech, and breath release, as in a voiced sigh. In isolation, these activities do not necessarily produce a pleasing or complete sound. Subsequent vocalises in Smith’s progression seek to achieve balance between these two forces. Smith‘s first vocalise, a slow, sostenuto declamation of the phrase on a single pitch, isolates intention to speak as the primary force of tone generation. His second vocalise, an ascending glissando followed by a descent from scale degree five to scale degree one in major, isolates the release of breath (as in Bernoulli's Principle) as the primary force of tone generation. His third vocalise is a legato ascending and descending arpeggiation of a major triad, utilizing the same phonemes as the first vocalise. His fourth vocalise trains the balanced onset of phonation through the performance of a sequence of detached tones on . His fifth vocalise trains continuous breath release through slow, followed by rapid, arpeggiation of the interval of a perfect fourth on . His sixth vocalise is a swift ascending major scale encompassing the range of a perfect eleventh, followed by a descending arpeggio outlining a dominant seventh chord before returning to the tonic, on for the first four tones, on tones five through eight and for the remainder of the vocalise, to promote flexibility and range extension.
