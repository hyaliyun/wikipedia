Floris Ltd or Floris of London Holdings Ltd) is the oldest English retailer of fragrance and toiletries and is still family owned and run today by the 8th and 9th generation of the family.  History  Juan Famenias Floris arrived in England from his native island of Menorca to seek his fortune. Shortly after his arrival in 1730, he secured premises in Jermyn Street, in the elegant quarter of London's St. James's. Floris initially set up business as a barber shop and comb-maker; however missing the aromas and sensations of his Mediterranean youth, he and his wife Elizabeth began making and selling perfume. = Royal warrant = The first Royal Warrant granted to J. Floris Ltd was in 1820 as 'Smooth Pointed Comb-makers' to the then King George IV soon after his accession. Today this first Royal warrant is still on display at 89 Jermyn Street together with no less than 19 others. Floris holds the warrants Perfumers to HM The Queen Elizabeth II, granted in 1971, and Manufacturers of Toilet Preparations to HRH The Prince of Wales, granted in 1984.  Stores  The London store is in Jermyn Street, London, in the same building Juan Floris created the business in the 18th century. The mahogany counter used in the store was purchased from the Great Exhibition at the Crystal Palace in Hyde Park in 1851. In 2012, Floris opened a second London shop at 147 Ebury Street, Belgravia, offering the full Floris range, together with a Bespoke Perfumery service.  Notable customers  The Floris archives hold letters from famous customers detailing their preferences and their thanks, including the following examples: * Florence Nightingale wrote a 25 July 1863 letter thanking Mr Floris for his 'sweet-smelling nosegay'. * Mary Shelley, whilst abroad, sent friends instructions to purchase her favourite combs and toothbrushes from Floris. * Beau Brummell in the early 19th century would discuss his current fragrances at length with Mr Floris. * Floris also creates bespoke fragrances for the British royal family, including the creation of a unisex fragrance for the wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex in 2018. Floris is also referenced by fictional characters. Al Pacino's character in Scent of a Woman famously declared he knew the 'woman in his sights' was wearing a Floris fragrance. In the James Bond novel Moonraker, Ian Fleming writes that Floris supplies the soaps and other toiletries in the restrooms in the private club Blades.

Its first recording was a split CD with the Nice-based band Agressor. They have released seven albums on the record labels Semetary/Fnac, Metal13, and Listenable. They began playing thrash metal influenced by the classic American bands such as Slayer. In 1991, they recorded the album \\"Disincarnate\\" in Morrisound Recording studios in Tampa, Florida, and the result was a pure death metal album. In the late 1990s, they incorporated more melody and groove in their music while maintaining a thrash/death aesthetic. The band announced that they were splitting in 1999, but after a support concert to Death's late frontman Chuck Schuldiner in 2000, the band reformed with Agressor's Alex Colin-Tocquaine and released Planet Pandemonium in 2002. After a few years hiatus, St√©phane and Herv√© announced in November 2009 a new line-up including Alex Lenormand (Locust) and Drakhian (Fornication, Black Dementia, Griffar). In February 2017, J√©r√¥me Point-Canovas replaced Drakhian as the band's guitarist during the \\"Sublime Dementia Tour\\", and he was officialised as permanent member in May.

This is a tax on the increase in the value of an asset between the date of purchase and the date of sale of that asset. The tax operates under two different regimes for a natural person and a body corporate. For a natural person, the rates of the capital gains tax are the same as those for earned income. The tax is levied at a rate determined by the highest rate of income tax which that person pays. If the person is a higher-rate tax payer, then the higher rate of income tax (currently 40%) is charged on the gain. Each year a natural person has an amount of gain, fixed by law, which is exempt from tax. By contrast, for bodies corporate, the chargeable gain is treated as additional profits for the accounting period in question. The capital gains tax is charged as additional corporation tax. Bodies corporate have no allowance for gains free from tax. Various reliefs from capital gains tax exist. These include indexation relief, where the amount of gain subject to tax is reduced by factoring in general price inflation, and taper relief, where set percentages of the gain are exempt from tax if the asset has been held for a certain length of time. The Act has been amended yearly by subsequent Finance Acts.

Modeled on the I Ching, the work was attributed to Jiao Yanshou (ÁÑ¶Âª∂Â£Ω, see :zh:ÁÑ¶Ë¥õ), courtesy name Jiao GanÁÑ¶Ë¥õ, who came from Liang Ê¢Å (modern Shang Qiu ÂïÜ‰∏ò, Henan) and was a tutor in the household of the Prince of Liang (early 1st century BCE). He was a scholar and official, reaching the rank of district magistrate in Xiao Huang Â∞èÈªÉ (near modern Kaifeng ÂºÄÂ∞Å, Henan). He was a student of the great Yi Jing scholar Meng Xi Â≠üÂñú and passed on the traditions of his school to Jing Fang ‰∫¨Êàø. However, some scholars suspect that the book was composed later, perhaps in the late Western Han, perhaps even somewhat later. I am inclined to agree with those who attribute the book to Cui Zhuan (Â¥îÁØÜ), a scholar and official who was active in the time of the Wang Mang interregnum (9 - 23 CE). Many of the verses seem oriented to the use of traveling merchants.Loewe, Michael; A Biographical Dictionary of the Qin, Former Han & Xin Periods (221 BC ‚Äì AD 24); p. 199-200Gait, Christopher, (2016) The Forest of Changes, A Han Dynasty Compendium of Divination Yi Lin literally means a forest or grove of changes. The book consists of 4096 verses. The verses represent all the possible combinations of the sixty-four hexagrams of the Book of Changes (Yi Jing/I Ching), thus 64 X 64 = 4096. Many of the verses of the Yi Lin were apparently lost over time and only approximately 1500 verses are unique, with the remaining verses full or partial duplicates. The verses are most often two couplets of four characters each. Some verses are as short as three lines and some as long as eight. Many of the longer verses have orphaned couplets at the end that do not seem to fit with the first two couplets. When divining using the Yi Jing the figure may be unchanging (hexagram 50 remains 50, for example), or can have one or more moving lines which change it into another hexagram (16, third and fourth, lines changing, becomes 8). In this edition of the Forest of Changes that would be described as 16 - 8, and the text is: 16 - 8 Even a ravenous tiger, Will not eat a spiny hedgehog. Yu the Great carved out the Dragon Gate. Avoiding misfortune and eliminating calamity, The people attain peace. This verse has several typical elements of the Forest. For one, there is a bit of folk wisdom on tigers and hedgehogs. Then comes the reference to Yu the Great, tamer of floods and founder of the Xia Dynasty. The verse uses an image from Chinese mythology in which Yu is supposed to have carved out a mountain as part of his herculean labors changing the flood pattern of China. Later diviners made use of various techniques to determine one or both of the hexagrams for an Yi Lin reading. These often included drawing trigram images from the world around them and the events they were inquiring about and using a system to associate hexagrams with each hour. The Song Dynasty Yi Jing scholar Shao Yong is said to have used the Forest of Changes as part of his system of Plum Blossom Numerology. Dating the Text The following items lend credence to at least portions of the text being written later than the lifetime of Jiao Yan Shou (1st century BCE), the purported author: The Red Lord, mentioned in 28 - 34, is a mythological figure that became popular in the waning days of the Western Han, and is to be found in the so-called Han Apocrypha literature. References to the Queen Mother of the West as a goddess to whom prayers for rescue are directed place the book at or near the end of the Western Han since an attitude toward her as a saving figure was not observed until that time (See Loewe, 1979). At least one verse (45 - 42) points quite clearly to the story of Wang Zhao Jun. Most of the key events in her life were in the 30s BCE. Although there have been many periods of flooding in China, one particularly heavy set of floods happened in 29 BCE. The large number of verses in the Forest about flood disasters lead me to believe it was written at a time when many floods were happening. Thus this is a very tenuous dating parameter, but it cannot be entirely excluded. Themes in the Forest A somewhat subjective survey of the themes in the book produces this list: * The wisdom and power of the ancient sage kings. * The mandate of heaven and the rise and fall of dynasties. * The events of the Zhou overthrow of the Shang and the parallels with the overthrow of the first dynasty, the Xia, overthrown by the Shang. * The arc of dynastic history, from receiving the mandate and the glory days down to the descent into madness and perversion is often mentioned, along with the continuity or lack thereof of ancestral veneration for the ruler and state. * The importance of both auspicious and inauspicious omens at the level of the state or empire; * Confucian virtues such as filial piety, humility and moral resilience. By this last term I mean the many occasions in which Confucian officials and those they admire in history stand up to rulers on matters of right and wrong and decisions that affect the safety of the state, as well as the habit of such officials to retire in times of bad governance and reemerge when a worthy ruler is on the throne. * Reliance on omens, a practice particularly popular with the school of governance of scholars of the Gong Yang Commentary on the Spring and Autumn Annals during the Han Dynasty. * The cult of the Queen Mother of the West. * Remembering and watching out for disasters in good times before they get a chance to develop; a concept found in the Book of Changes and elsewhere. * Traveling merchants. A large number of texts are about business journeys, markets, transporting goods, obtaining profits, etc. * Folk sayings and songs and folk beliefs and Daoist or Huang Lao schools.

Reception and collections Idlebrain Jeevi in his review gave a rating of 3 out of 5 for the movie with concluding remarks \\"Overall, it's an average film that has chances to become hit because of the Teja's mass-attracting episodes and Mahesh Babu's brilliant portrayal of the character\\".

In total, we made a profit of 5-6 cr INR and Nijam was not a flop\\". He corroborated the same in an interview with The Hindu \\"I worked with Mahesh after he had a flop called Bobby, but Nijam released after Okkadu and people drew comparisons. I don‚Äôt argue when people say Nijam was a flop. The film was made with a budget of Rs. 6.5 crore and sold for Rs. 21 crore.

It stars Bugs Bunny and it is the debut for Marvin the Martian -- although he is unnamed in this film -- along with his Martian dog, K-9. Marvin's nasal voice for this first film is different from the later one he is most known for, which was similar to one that Blanc used for the emcee in What's Cookin' Doc?, for just one line, where the emcee says, \\"Shall we give it to him, folks?\\" The title is a play on \\"daredevil\\", although it has only a vague metaphorical connection to the plotline, as Bugs is a reluctant participant in the cartoon's acrobatics. Plot Bugs Bunny, disguised as a Martian, hands Marvin the Uranium PU-36 Explosive Space Modulator. Animation by Ken Harris. The cartoon opens with the newspaper headlines \\"Scientists to Launch First Rocket to Moon\\" and \\"Heroic Rabbit Volunteers as First Passenger.\\" However, the scene then changes to Bugs literally being dragged across the launching pad to the waiting rocket as he frantically protests against what is to be expected of him, but then immediately becomes cooperative when he sees the rocket being loaded with carrots. The rocket is then launched into space. Shocked by the sudden acceleration of the rocket, Bugs attempts to exit it, but when he opens up the hatch, he is horrified when he sees that the rocket has now already left Earth. When the rocket lands on the Moon, Bugs completely goes to pieces, but quickly regains his composure as he starts to walk on the surface of the moon, contemplating the fact that he is the first living creature to set foot on it, while passing behind a large rock on which the words \\"Kilroy was here\\" are written. Another rocket soon lands nearby, called the Mars to Moon Expeditionary Force from the planet Mars, and from it emerges an unnamed Martian (later known as Marvin the Martian), who begins work on something that involves a missile and clearly concerns Earth. Curious, Bugs asks Marvin what he is up to, and Marvin explains he is there to blow up the earth. Bugs is initially not concerned, until he realizes the severity of the situation and steals from Marvin the missile's fuel source, a Uranium PU-36 Explosive Space Modulator, a small device resembling, and that operates the same as, a mere stick of dynamite. He shortly has to then deal with Marvin's Martian dog, named K-9, who, as ordered to by Marvin, retrieves it while Bugs is distracted trying to send an SOS to Earth. In one of his classic word switcharoos, and after that through flattery, which the dog is absent- mindlessly, extremely prone to, Bugs successfully gets the Uranium PU-36 Explosive Space Modulator back. This prompts an angry Marvin to berate and scold his dog. Bugs quickly arrives disguised as a Martian with a \\"special delivery from Mars\\" and hands Marvin the Uranium PU-36 Explosive Space Modulator, now wired to a detonator. While Marvin is celebrating the return of the Uranium PU-36, Bugs activates the detonator. The explosion reduces the moon to a crescent. A silhouette on earth resembling Friz Freleng contacts Bugs Bunny, and asks if he has a statement to the press. Bugs, hanging precariously from the edge of the Moon, with Marvin and the dog clinging to him and dangling below, answers that he does, and in his typical Brooklyn accent yells out, \\"GET ME OUTTA HERE!\\" Crew *Story: Michael Maltese *Animation: Ben Washam, Lloyd Vaughan, Ken Harris, Phil Monroe, Abe Levitow, Pete Burness *Layout: Robert Gribbroek *Backgrounds: Peter Alvarado *Effects Animation: A.C.

The present-day small Jewish community of Slovenia () is estimated at 400 to 600 members, with the Jewish community of Slovenia suggesting 500 to 1000 members . Around 130 are officially registered,http://www.zurnal24.si/judje- zakljucujejo-s-praznovanjem-hanuke-clanek-144186 most of whom live in the capital, Ljubljana.  History of the community  =Ancient community= Painting of a Jewish woman, c. 1682. In the collection of the Ptuj Ormoz Regional Museum. The Jewish community of Slovenia pre-dates the 6th century Slavic settlement of the Eastern Alps, when the Slavic ancestors of present- day Slovenes conquered their current territoryJews of Yugoslavia 1941‚Äì1945 Victims of Genocide and Freedom Fighters, Jasa Romano,. The first Jews arrived in present-day Slovenia in Roman times, with archaeological evidence of Jews found in Maribor, and in the village of ≈†kocjan in Lower Carniola. In ≈†kocjan, an engraved menorah dating from the 5th century AD was found in a graveyard.Excerpts from Jews in Yugoslavia ‚Äì Part I In the 12th century, Jews arrived to the Slovene Lands fleeing poverty in Italy and central Europe. Even though they were forced to live in ghettos, many Jews prospered. Relations between Jews and the local Christian population were generally peaceful. In Maribor, Jews were successful bankers, winegrowers and millers. Several \\"Jewish Courts\\" (Judenhof) existed in Styria, settling disputes between Jews and Christians. Israel Isserlein, who authored several essays on medieval Jewish life in Lower Styria, was the most important rabbi at the time, having lived in Maribor.V. Travner, Mariborski ghetto, Kronika 2, 1935, pp. 154‚Äì150. In 1397, Jewish ghettos in Radgona and Ptuj were set ablaze by anonymous anti- Jewish assailants.Enciklopedija Slovenije, 4. Zvezek, 1990, p. 315. The first synagogue in Ljubljana is mentioned in 1213. Issued with a Privilegium, Jews were able to settle an area of Ljubljana located on the left bank of the Ljubljanica River. The streets ≈Ωidovska ulica (\\"Jewish Street\\") and ≈Ωidovska steza (\\"Jewish Lane\\"), which now occupy the area, are still reminiscent of that period.  The Expulsion of Jews  The wealth of the Jews bred resentment among the Inner Austrian nobility and the burghers, with many refusing to repay Jewish money-lenders, while local merchants considered Jews as competitors. The antisemitism of the Catholic Church also played an important role in whipping up animosity against the Jews, In 1494 and 1495 the assemblies of Styria and Carinthia offered Austrian Emperor Maximilian a bounty for the expulsion of Jews from both provinces. Maximilian granted their request, citing as reasons for the expulsion the Jewish pollution of the Christian sacrament, the ritual killings of Christian children, and the defrauding of debtors. The expulsions started immediately, with the last Jews expelled by 1718.Jewish Virtual Library ‚Äì Slovenia The Jews were expelled from Maribor in 1496. Following separate demands by the citizens of Ljubljana for the expulsion of Jews, Jews were expelled from Ljubljana in 1515. After the expulsion of the Jewish community, the Maribor synagogue was turned into a church. =The modern era= The building of a former synagogue in Lendava. In 1709, the Holy Roman Emperor Charles VI, ruler of the Habsburg Monarchy, issued a decree allowing Jews to return to Inner Austria. Nevertheless, Jews in that time settled almost exclusively in the commercial city of Trieste and, to a much smaller extent, in the town of Gorizia (now both part of Italy). The decree was overturned in 1817 by Francis I, and Jews were granted full civil and political right only with the Austrian constitution of 1867. Nevertheless, the Slovene Lands remained virtually without a consistent Jewish population, with the exception of Gorizia, Trieste, the region of Prekmurje, and some smaller towns in the western part of the County of Gorizia and Gradisca (Gradisca, Cervignano), which were inhabited mostly by a Friulian-speaking population. According to the census of 1910, only 146 Jews lived in the territory of present-day Slovenia, excluding the Prekmurje region. Yet despite this, as elsewhere in Austria-Hungary, antisemitism started to intensify also in Slovenia, from the mid-19th century onward. propagated by prominent Slovene Catholic leaders, such as Bishop Anton Mahniƒç and Janez Evangelist Krek. The former called for a war against Judaism and the latter sought to persuade believers that the Jews were transmitters of the most harmful influences. In 1918, in the chaotic transition between Austria-Hungary and the new Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, riots broke out against Jews and Hungarians in many places in Prekmurje. Soldiers returning from the front and locals looted Jewish and Hungarian shops. On November 4, 1918, in Beltinci, locals looted Jewish homes and shops, tortured Jews, and set fire to the synagogue.. After the pogrom, the once powerful Beltinci Orthodox Jewish community, numbering 150 in the mid-19th century, disappeared. In 1937 the local authorities demolished the Beltinci synagogue Rampant anti-Semitism was among the reasons why few Jews decided to settle in the area, and the overall Jewish population remained at a very low level. In the 1920s, after the formation of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (Yugoslavia), the local Jewish community merged with the Jewish community of Zagreb, Croatia. According to the 1931 census, there were about 900 Jews in the Drava Banovina, mostly concentrated in Prekmurje, which was a part of the Kingdom of Hungary prior to 1919. This was the reason why in the mid-1930s Murska Sobota became the seat of the Jewish Community of Slovenia. During that period, the Jewish population was reinvigorated by many immigrants fleeing from neighbouring Austria and Nazi Germany to a more tolerant Kingdom of Yugoslavia. Nevertheless, in the prewar period the Slovene Roman Catholic Church and its affiliated largest political party, the Slovenian People's Party, engaged in antisemitism , with Catholic papers writing about \\"Jews\\" as \\"a disaster for our countryside\\", \\"Jews\\" as \\"fraudsters\\" and \\"traitors to Christ\\", while the main Slovene Catholic daily, Slovenec, informed local Jews that their \\"road out of Yugoslavia ...was open\\". and that from Slovenia \\"we export such goods [I.e. Jews] without compensation\\". While Interior Minister in the Yugoslav government, the leading Slovene politician and former Catholic priest, Anton Koro≈°ec, declared \\"all Jews, Communists, and Freemasons as traitors, conspirators, and enemies of the State\\". Then in 1940 Koro≈°ec introduced two antisemitic laws in Yugoslavia, to ban Jews from the food industry and restrict the number of Jewish students in high schools and universities Slovene Jews were severely affected, as Sharika Horvat noted in her testimony for the Shoah Foundation, \\"everything fell apart....under the Koro≈°ec government.\\" According to official Yugoslav data, the number of self-declared Jews (according to religion, not to ancestry) in Yugoslav Slovenia rose to 1,533 by 1939. In that year, there were 288 declared Jews in Maribor, 273 in Ljubljana, 270 in Murska Sobota, 210 in Lendava and 66 in Celje. The other 400 Jews lived scattered around the country, with a quarter of them living in the Prekmurje region. Prior to World War Two, there were two active synagogues in Slovenia, one in Murska Sobota and one in Lendava. The overall number of Jews prior to the Axis invasion of Yugoslavia in April 1941 is estimated to have been around 2,500, including baptised Jews and refugees from Austria and Germany. =The Holocaust= The Jewish community, very small even before World War II and the Shoah, was further reduced by the Nazis occupation between 1941 and 1945. The Jews in northern and eastern Slovenia (the Slovenian Styria, Upper Carniola, Slovenian Carinthia, and Posavje), which was annexed to the Third Reich, were deported to concentration camps as early as in the late spring of 1941. Very few survived. In Ljubljana and in Lower Carniola, which came under Italian occupation, the Jews were relatively safe until September 1943, when most of the zone was occupied by the Nazi German forces. In late 1943, most of them were deported to concentration camps, although some managed to escape, especially by fleeing to the zones freed by the partisan resistance. In Ljubljana, 32 Jews were able to hide until September 1944, when they were betrayed and arrested in raids by the collaborationist Slovene Home Guard police and handed over to the Nazis, who then sent them to Auschwitz, where most were exterminated. The Slovene Home Guard greatly intensified the antisemitism already present in prewar Slovene Catholic circles, engaging in vicious antisemitic propaganda. Thus the Slovene Home Guard leader, Leon Rupnik, attacked Jews in virtually all his public speeches, In 1944, the Slovene Home Guard newspaper wrote: \\"Judaism wants to enslave the whole world. It can enslave it if it also economically destroys all the nations. That is why it drove nations into war to destroy themselves and thereby benefit the Jews. Communism is the most loyal executor of Jewish orders, along with liberal democracy. Both ideas were created by Jews for non-Jewish peoples. The Slovenian nation also wants to bring Judaism to its knees, along with its moral decay and impoverishment.\\" The influential Catholic priest, Lambert Ehrlich, who advocated collaboration with the Italian Fascist authorities, campaigned against ‚ÄúJewish Satanism,‚Äù which he maintained was trying to get its hands on other peoples‚Äô national treasures. The Jews of Prekmurje, where the majority of Slovenian Jewry lived prior to World War Two, suffered the same fate as the Jews of Hungary. Following the German occupation of Hungary, almost the entire Jewish population of the Prekmurje region was deported to Auschwitz. Very few survived. All together it is estimated that of the 1,500 Jews in Slovenia in 1939, only 200 managed to survive, meaning 87% were exterminated by the Nazis, among the highest rates in Europe. Some Slovene Jews managed to save themselves by joining the partisans. Unlike the Polish resistance, which did not allow Jews in their ranks, the Yugoslav partisans welcomed Jews. 3,254 Jews in former Yugoslavia survived by joining the partisans, more than one-fifth of all survivors. After the war 10 Jewish partisans were named Yugoslav national heroes. For assisting Jews during the Holocaust, 15 Slovenes have been named Righteous Among the Nations, by Yad Vashem. =Post-war community= Jewish cemetery in Lendava, in the eastern Slovenian Prekmurje region. Under Communism in Yugoslavia, the Jewish community in Socialist Slovenia numbered fewer than 100 members. The Federation of Jewish Communities was reestablished and upon the establishment of the State of Israel (1948), the Federation sought and received permission from the Yugoslav authorities to organize Jewish emigration to Israel. 8,000 Yugoslav Jews, among them Slovene Jews, who were all allowed to take their property with them, left for Israel. In 1953, the synagogue of Murska Sobota, the only remaining after the Shoah, which the handful of Jewish survivors were unable to maintain and therefore sold in 1949 to the city, was demolished by the local Communist authorities to make way for new apartments. Many Jews were expelled from Yugoslavia as \\"ethnic Germans\\", and most of Jewish property was confiscated. The Judovska obƒçina v Ljubljani (Jewish Community of Ljubljana) was officially reformed following World War II. Its first president was Artur Kon, followed by Aleksandar ≈†varc, and by Roza Fertig-≈†varc in 1988. In 1969, it numbered only 84 members and its membership was declining due to emigration and age. In the 1960s and 1970s, there was a revival of Jewish themes in Slovenian literature, almost exclusively by women authors. Berta Bojetu was the most renowned Jewish author who wrote in Slovene. Others included Miriam Steiner and Zlata Medic-Vokaƒç.Enciklopedija Slovenije  After 1990  In the last Yugoslav census in 1991, 199 Slovenes declared themselves of the Jewish religion, and in the 2011 census, this number was 99.The Jewish community today is estimated at 400‚Äì600 members, although only 130 are members of the Jewish Community of Slovenia organization. The community consists of people of Ashkenazi and Sephardi descent. In 1999, the first Chief Rabbi for Slovenia was appointed since 1941. Before that, religious services were provided with help from the Jewish community of Zagreb. The present chief rabbi for Slovenia, Ariel Haddad, resides in Trieste and is a member of the Lubavitcher Hassidic school.The Jewish Community of Slovenia The current president of the Jewish Community of Slovenia is Andrej Ko≈æar Beck. Since the year 2000, there has been a noticeable revival of Jewish culture in Slovenia. In 2003, a synagogue was opened in Ljubljana.https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/slovenia.html In 2008, the Association Isserlein was founded to promote the legacy of Jewish culture in Slovenia.http://www.bizi.si/podjetje/o-podjetju.aspx?rDxAvxJYStSQReojk53ILkr0E9MbqyYir9BDpgUWqLs%3D It has organized several public events that have received positive responses from the media, such as the public lighting of the hanukiah in Ljubljana in 2009.http://www.siol.net/slovenija/novice/2009/12/priziganje_svecnika_hanukija.aspx There has also been a growing public interest in the Jewish historical legacy in Slovenia. In 2008, the complex of the Jewish Cemetery in Ro≈æna Dolina near Nova Gorica was restored due to the efforts of the local Democratic Party politicians, pressure from the neighboring Jewish Community of Gorizia, and the American Embassy in Slovenia.http://lojze68.blogspot.com/2010/04/studij- judovska-skupnost-na-goriskem.html In January 2010, the first monument to the victims of the Shoah in Slovenia was unveiled in Murska Sobota. Occasional antisemitic incidents still occur, such as the defacing of the Maribor synagogue with graffiti saying ‚ÄúJuden Raus‚Äù (\\"Out with the Jews\\"), while others have warned against Holocaust denial and antisemitic pronouncements by Slovene right-wingers.

It is a Catholic, Marist College set on of land overlooking the Tamaki Estuary in Glen Innes.  History  The college was opened in 1903 in Ponsonby, by the Marist Brothers. It is the oldest continuously existing Catholic boys' secondary school in Auckland although it has changed its location, moving to its current Glen Innes site in 1955. St Paul's College was founded on the old Sacred Heart College site in that year. The Marist Brothers continue to be a presence in the school community, with both teaching and maintenance of school grounds undertaken in part by the Brothers. The headmaster role at the college was served solely by Marist Brothers up until 1993, when Brendan Schollum took the role; the college's first lay principal. In 2003, the college held its centennial celebrations, which included the opening of a new administration building, technology block and Year 7 and 8 Department, and in 2005 it celebrated 50 years of being at the Glen Innes site. At the end of 2006, Jim Dale became the third lay headmaster at Sacred Heart College, taking over from Phillip Mahoney. Current Principal, Stephen Dooley, started in 2019 was previously Deputy Principal at St Peter's College, Epsom.  Education  Sacred Heart currently offers NCEA as its national qualification standard. In the 2007 academic year, the school's board of trustees and management team began an Academic Review. This will look at the schools current assessment process and performance, and whether the school should look at alternative courses of education, such as Cambridge International Examinations (CIE) and the International Baccalaureate (IB).  Sport  Sacred Heart offers a wide range of sporting options to its pupils, though it is traditionally a school with a very strong rugby culture. Sacred Heart won four titles in the 2006 season, with its 3A, 3B, 5A and 5B teams victorious. The Under-15 Open team won the North Island Catholic Boys Under 15 Tournament, held at Francis Douglas Memorial College in that year also. The Sacred Heart 1st XV remains the only team never to have been relegated from the 1A grade. The 2011 1st XV was one of the more successful teams in college history and went unbeaten in the 1A competition round robin and won the Moascar Cup, Fitzpatrick Kirckpatrick cup, Hibernian Shield and the Marist Quadrangular Cup. Also in 2016 and 2017 the 1st XV reached the final of the Auckland 1A competition, losing on both occasions. Other Sports include: Football, Cricket, Water Polo, Tennis, Cycling, Basketball, Hockey, Badminton, Rowing, Swimming and Athletics. For 2007, a new Sports Institute has been opened for boys in years 7‚Äì10. Currently, the only sports on offer for this academy are Cricket, Football, Rugby union, Tennis and Water Polo, though this is likely to expand to include other sports in subsequent years.  Houses  Photo of the school's year 7 and 8 and technology blocks. The houses of Sacred Heart College are named after either famous people in the Catholic and Marist community in New Zealand, or important figures in the school's history. The six houses are: * Basil Basil House is named after Brother Basil, who taught at the college for over 50 years, and was also the college's first principal. * Coolahan Coolahan House is named after the landowner who donated the land for the original site of the college in Ponsonby, now the site of St. Paul's College. * Lenihan Lenihan House is named after the Bishop of Auckland in 1903, who saw the need for a Catholic boys' school in the area and was a driving force in Sacred Heart's foundation. * Marcellin Marcellin house is named after Marcellin Champagnat, founder of the Marist order. * Pompallier Pompallier house is named after Jean Baptiste Pompallier (1802‚Äì1871), the first Catholic vicar apostolic and bishop to visit and be located in New Zealand (arrived 1838); first Catholic Bishop of Auckland (1848‚Äì1868). * Stephen Stephen House is named after Brother Stephen Coll FMS, a well known former teacher and Marist Brother at the college. There is also a seventh 'House', Leonard House, named after Brother Leonard Tobin FMS, which is home to the senior boarding students in the college hostel.  Boarding hostel  The boarding hostel is home to roughly 160‚Äì170 boarders from all over New Zealand and from overseas.

It lies between the villages of Whalley and Langho. It forms part of the Billington and Langho civil parish and contains the schools St Augustine's RC High School, St Leonard's Primary and St Mary's Primary. The village population at the 2011 census was 1,409. The 16th century Chapel of St Leonard is a Grade I listed building. According to local tradition, the chapel was constructed using materials taken from Whalley Abbey following the dissolution of the monasteries in the Tudor period, but this has never been conclusively proven.  History  In 798, early in his reign, Eardwulf of Northumbria fought a battle at Billington Moor against a nobleman named Wada, who had been one of those who killed √Üthelred I of Northumbria. Wada was defeated and driven into exile. A charter written in 1308 mentions a hermitage by the rocks on the eastern side of Billington.Farrer, W. and Brownbill, J. (editors) (1911) \\"Townships: Billington\\", A History of the County of Lancaster: Volume 6, pp. 325‚Äì334, accessed 2 September 2014. The village has been known previously as Billindon (1203), Billinton (1208), Bilingdon (1241), Belyngton or Bilyngton (14th‚Äì16th centuries). In the 16th century, tenants of the village shared common land known as Billington Common with tenants of local villages Great Harwood and Wilpshire. There also existed a wood of approximately 60 acres named Elker, which contained oak trees, as well as hazel and alder. Oak and ash trees could also be found in the smaller Nab wood, which was around 40 acres.

Merrie Melodies theatrical short directed by Tex Avery, with story by Dave Monahan and musical direction by Carl Stalling. The cartoon was released on August 2, 1941. Synopsis This is one of the cartoons that Warner would occasionally produce that featured none of its stable of characters, just a series of gags, usually based on outrageous stereotypes and plays on words, as a narrator (voiced by Robert C. Bruce) describes the action. In this case, the story concerns a small airplane taking its passengers on a world tour. Some excerpts: *The plane, as well as its shadow, are remarkably flexible. The plane takes off like a bird, running and jumping and flapping its wings. The plane's shadow, seen from above, dodges ground-level obstacles. *The plane passes Mount Rushmore, which is seen to include the two major candidates from the 1940 election, Franklin D. Roosevelt (\\"For Democrats\\") and Wendell Willkie (\\"For Republicans\\"). *In Ireland, an Irish tenor (in rotoscoping) sings \\"When Irish Eyes Are Smiling\\", while a (cartooned) stray hair keeps appearing in the frame, as if stuck in the projector. The Irishman abruptly stops singing and yells at the top of his lungs to the projectionist, \\"Hey, you, up there! Get that hair out of here!\\" This joke was later reused in Avery's cartoon Magical Maestro (1952). *In \\"Darkest Africa\\", natives are listening to jungle drumbeats which are used for communication. One native asks another what the drums are saying, and the second native (illustrating the age of this kind of joke), responds, \\"Boop- ditty, boop-ditty, boop-boop-de-boop!\\" *Also in Africa, a native is using a blowgun, and is revealed that he was merely aiming at a practice target. His target calls him a \\"terrible shot\\". *A group of ostriches hide their heads in the sand. Another ostrich arrives, perplexed, wondering where everyone went. *A series of cocoons opens up, all of them producing beautiful butterflies, except for a weak and scrawny one: \\"Well, I've been sick!\\" *The cartoon ends with the plane lost in fog while returning to New York City. When the fog finally clears, the plane is discovered to be attached to a carousel ride, and as it circles, \\"The Merry-Go-Round Broke Down\\" is playing. In this unique instance for a WB cartoon, the Looney Tunes theme segues into the Merrie Melodies theme at the fade-out.

Distribution The green-thighed frog is native to the east coast of Australia. Its range stretches from Cordalba State Forest in south-eastern Queensland to Ourimbah in New South Wales; within this area, though, populations are severely fragmented. The several records from Darkes Forest, south of Sydney, are erroneous. Numbers have decreased at Ourimbah, but there have been no record of declines or disappearances elsewhere. They are believed to occupy an area of less than 500 km2; this has led to them being listed as endangered on the IUCN RedList of Threatened Species Description The dorsal surface is chocolate brown with darker flecks. The ventral surface is white or pale yellow and peppered with fine dark spots over the throat. A thick stripe runs from the snout, across the eye and tympanum, and then breaks up into blotches on the sides. The margin of the upper jaw is marked with white; this stripe continues to the base of the arm. The armpits are marked with lime green or yellow. The backs of the thighs and groin are bright blue, green, or blue-green, with black mottling. The tympanum is distinct, and finger and toe pads are medium-sized. The fingers don't web and the toes are one-third webbed. The iris is dark brown with a golden crescent in the upper half. The legs are shorter compared to other ground-dwelling hylids. Ecology and behaviour It inhabits areas of rainforest, wet sclerophyll, and open forests. Breeding occurs from September to May after heavy rain. From 300 to 600 eggs are deposited in temporary pools and flooded areas, and are laid in clumps among water weeds at the water's surface. Similar species Green-thighed frogs are unlikely to be confused with any other species because of the bright colours in the groin and on the thighs and the lack of toe webbing.

Informal wear, also called business wear, corporate/office wear, tenue de ville and (colloquially) dress clothes, is a Western dress code for clothing defined by a dress shirt with necktie, sometimes with a business suit for men, and cocktail dress or pant suit for women. On the scale of formality, it is considered less formal than semi-formal wear but more formal than casual wear, yet retaining availability for more personal expression than semi-formal wear. Thus, informal should not be confused with casual wear such as business casual or smart casual despite that some people may refer loosely to informal dress as \\"formal\\" in contrast with merely casual. The suit originated as leisure wear in the late 19th century but eventually replaced the frock coat as every day wear in the city. After World War I, the suit was established as informal daily wear. Hats, such as fedora or bowler hats, are sometimes worn with informal wear. Informal wear is commonly applied for office use in professions like politics, academia, law and finance, business, as well as certain events such as job interviews in other sectors. It is a traditional dress code that aims to indicate respect to the situation and not draw attention. History The suit originated in Britain in the 19th-century as a leisurewear. Seeking a casual alternative to the knee-length, heavy frock coats then considered appropriate business dress, men began to wear lighter coats cut just below the seat when not engaged in business. Standard suit-making fabric is fine combed wool, with the inclusion of cashmere in more expensive fabrics. Middle-price suits are often made of wool-polyester blends, whilst the cheapest are made entirely of polyester fabric. This business suit (also known as the \\"sack suit\\" in North America, commonly by Brooks Brothers) became the standard business daywear for all men who were not engaged in physical labor. The waistcoat (British) or vest (American) was worn regularly with the suit up to World War II, but is rarely seen today, due to central heating in offices and the expense of construction. Until at least the early 1960s it was common to wear a hat. In general, business suits are characterized by three styles and a fourth fusion style. English suits are noted for having a \\"touch fit\\" to the wearer's body shape and carefully made padded shoulders. Italian suits are often slimmer, with higher armholes and highly shaped to complement a slim physique. Traditional American suits have lightly padded shoulders and loose natural fit with minimal shaping. Since the 1960s, designer brands (especially Polo Ralph Lauren) have created fusion style that brings a more shaped European look to the natural American cut. Suits in Britain were often made in tweed, often with three pieces, and were worn outside the City of London. Tweed is made from uncombed wool, and, like all fabrics from the time, was thick and durable (18-ounce was considered medium-weight in the Edwardian era). A full tweed suit is less common today, with just tweed sports jackets more often worn, but is still used generally as everyday wear by some, and for outdoor sports such as shooting and angling. It is worn with appropriate accompanying clothes, much as any other suit; brown full brogues and wool ties are common items not worn with other types of suit. Etiquette Informal attire is today considered a form of dress customarily appropriate for all formal settings, which do not explicitly require white tie or black tie. For instance, it is commonly worn to religious services and funerals, in government offices and schools. Some professions, like law or finance, may require it. At present, informal attire is the typical dress at daytime weddings in the United States, serving as a replacement for the increasingly rare morning dress. As \\"dress clothes\\", the term is considered a secular version of \\"Sunday clothes\\" or \\"church clothes\\", which signifies clothes worn by some Christians to church services. Because of its strong association with the business world, informal attire is also known as international standard business dress, business professional or business formal. =Boys and men= *Dress socks, differentiated from normal socks by a tighter fit and dark colors *Underpants, seen as required by casual and above. *Trousers, generally monochrome, and in a dark color.

However, when on a job interview or attending business meetings, many men who do not otherwise wear suits will dutifully wear them as a mark of respect and formality. Many how-to books for men recommend wearing a conservatively styled suit to an employment interview even when the man does not expect to ever wear a suit on the job. In the 1990s, Internet businesses flourished and so did the relaxed dress standards enjoyed by unconventional dot-com businesspeople. A new form of attire had arisen, business casual, which consists of nice trousers, often chinos or khakis, and a polo shirt or short-sleeved shirt. Today this is acceptable and common attire at technically oriented business meetings and in semiprofessional settings, and is continuing to gain ground over traditional business attire. The standard for women is also in flux. In the 1970s, women aspiring to managerial or professional status were advised to \\"dress for success\\" by wearing clothing that imitated the male business suit: jacket and matching skirt, worn with a plain blouse and discreet accessories. The plain blouse is designated as a long sleeve button down shirt tucked properly into the skirt at the waist. Some women wore pantsuits, substituting pants for the skirt, but in doing so, they risked the displeasure of many who felt that women should not wear pants. Now even conservative Western workplaces are more accepting of pants on female employees. However, they may still expect female employees to exhibit the formality of men's suits. Women in \\"creative\\" professions, such as advertising, web design, or fashion, can usually dress with more color and flair. Male business attire is also nuanced. Choice of clothing and accessories proclaims social and financial status. An inexpensive ready-to-wear suit will lack the cachet of a bespoke suit fashioned by a famous tailor. Custom shirts, hand-made leather shoes, fine cuff links and expensive watches may indicate wealth, and in certain professions may effectively amount to a \\"dress code\\" (e.g., in investment banking). Western business wear is standard in many workplaces around the globe, even in countries where the usual daily wear may be a distinctive national clothing. Some non-Western business-people will wear national clothing nonetheless. A Saudi Arabian sheikh may wear the traditional robes and headdress to an international conference; United Arab Emirates diplomats in particular are noted for attending conventions of the United Nations General Assembly in full keffiyeh and thawb. Diplomats of the People's Republic of China are similarly noted for wearing the Mao suit to international events; Indian leaders often wear Nehru jackets, with Manmohan Singh wearing a suit-like combination including such a jacket with his Sikh turban. Wearing national clothing in such contexts can proclaim national pride, or just extremely high status which allows the wearer to defy convention. Sometimes an element of the national attire such as a hat is combined with a Western business suit; for instance, Yasser Arafat was noted for wearing the aforementioned kaffiyeh with a Western-style military uniform, a derivative of the suit. The aloha shirt, while considered casual attire in the mainland United States, is considered acceptable business wear in Hawaii, where it is well-suited to that state's warm and humid climate. Similarly, Kariyushi style attire is encouraged in Japan, especially southern locales of Japan, to allow more comfort in the workplace, and to encourage dress that conforms with Cool Biz guidelines. Akihiko Higa, a researcher of Kaiho Soken who has worked on a Kariyushi style project for an Okinawan clothing manufacturer, said, ‚ÄúIt (the Kariyushi shirt) is easy-to-wear and highly functional for wearing either in an office situation or in a resort.\\" References External links Category:Clothing by function Category:Workwear Category:Dress codes ","title":"Informal wear"},{"id":"6680361","text":"Project: Starfighter is a 2D shoot 'em up written by Parallel Realities (Stephen J Sweeney).

With WEAPCO overthrown Bainfield chases Kethlan to Venus where he begs the commander to surrender, so that he does not have to kill him. Kethlan refuses and informs Bainfield that he would prefer to die a warrior's death. The two dog fight for one last time, with Bainfield emerging as the victor.  Development history  Project: Starfighter was originally developed for the Amiga, and the source code was available as freeware (allowing only non- commercial usage) in the early 2000s.www.parallelrealities.co.uk/starfighter.html webarchive version 2001 Can I use it as a basis for a commercial product? No! This code is freeware. If you make anything out of it you should make the product freeware. You may not use this code to construct a shareware product either. On 7 March 2002 the game was released for Linux too, and the source code was released under non- commercial terms.www.parallelrealities.co.uk/fighters.html webarchive version 2002 License: This code may be used as the user wishes, with the exception of any commercial (including shareware) package. Since you are receiving this code for free, the program you make it a part of should also be free (hey, that's only fair, right?). You can credit Parallel Realities if you wish, although it is not necessary. On 18 April 2004 the game become available for Debian and the GPL license was linked for the complete Parallel Realities website.parallelrealities.co.uk/LICENSE webarchive versions Project: Starfighter has been ported later to many platforms, including Linux, FreeBSD,freshports.org/games/starfighter/ Mac OS X,Abandonia Reloaded @ Project: Starfighter Microsoft Windows,Project: Starfighter - netzwelt Sony PSP, Amiga OS4,Project Starfighter - OS4Depot QNX and Xbox. A continuation of Project Starfighter exists, where the original Freeware game assets were replaced by various Open content artwork (mostly CC BY and CC BY-SA licensed) in 2012 and 2015. The project moved in 2015 from Sourceforge to GNU Savannah,starfighter on savannah.nongnu.org and then moved to GitHub with the release of version 2.0 in 2019. The project continues to be updated under the GNU GPL version 3 or later. Novelization In June 2014, Sweeney published a novelization of the story of Project: Starfighter,Project Starfighter on stephenjsweeney.comSF novel based on free/open game \\"Project: Starfighter\\" by Cory Doctorow Jun 16, 2014 making it the first time a commercial novel has been based on a GPL video game. The story retains much of the plot of the original game, while also expanding on a number of aspects of the universe. Key characters from the game - Chris Bainfield, Sid Wilson, Kline Kethlan, Krass Tyler, and Phoebe and Ursula Lexx - are all given prominent roles, while WEAPCO is presented as the \\"Wade Ellen Asset Protection Corporation\\" (by way of a backronym). The most substantial change was that the starfighter itself that Chris flew during the game is now sentient in the book. The fighter goes by the name of Athena. Athena plays a large role in the story, and helps Chris in his fight back against WEAPCO. While piloting the Firefly, Athena is able to merge her mind with Chris', allowing him to increase his perception of the world and react much faster than an ordinary human pilot. The speed at which he learns to master flight and combat in the Firefly also increases significantly, with Chris becoming a legendary pilot in a matter of only a few days.

Minentaucher (Mine Clearance Divers) are particularly trained military divers of the German Navy. Their operational areas are: *Searching, identifying, and removing or salvaging underwater weapons such as mines or explosives in the water. *Servicing underwater drones. *Removing weapons in water and ashore, in particular removing explosives attached by enemies to hulls and underwater equipment. *Rescuing and salvaging. Mine Clearance Divers are highly qualified specialists, who are stationed partly on board schwimmenden Einheiten (= \\"swimming units\\"), which can be ordered to be in standby if necessary. A part of the trained mine clearance divers is available as a special-purpose force in the mine clearance diver company in Eckernf√∂rde. In 2001 the Bataillon Spezialisierter Kr√§fte (= \\"Battalion of Specialized Forces\\") was separated from the German commando frogmen group. The Bataillon Spezialisierter Kr√§fte (SEK M) (= \\"Specialized Task Forces Battalion\\" was formed by the transformation of 2003. SEK M was divided further into the Kampfschwimmerkompanie (= \\"combat diver company\\", one mine clearance diver company, and two naval companies for special employments (e.g. boarding ships), a training inspection, and further support elements. On 1 April 2014 the Minentaucherkompanie became an integral part of the newly formed Naval Force Protection Battalion (Seebataillon).Das ‚ÄûMultitool‚Äú der Marine - Seebataillon in Eckernf√∂rde aufgestellt See :de:Bild:MiTa Wappen.JPG for the coat of arms of the Minentaucherkompanie. Training The mine clearance divers are trained in the mine clearance diver company (MiTaKp) in Eckernf√∂rde. This unit is subordinated to the Flottille Minenstreitkr√§fte (= \\"flotilla of mine armed forces\\"). Entrance requirements To qualify for armed divers diver training, which includes mine clearance divers and combat frogmen, these conditions are to be fulfilled:- Examination without restriction *Serving as a soldier on a timed contract \\"Soldat auf Zeit\\" for at least 4 years or as a career soldier. *Completing the basic training at a naval school;. *Undergo the TuKV (diver and combat frogman suitability) examination at the Schiffahrtsmedizinisches Institut (= Shipping-medical Institute) in Kiel. *Top condition (physical fitness), which is examined in special tests before and during the training. *Strength of will, which makes the applicant loadable over the borders of reflexes and physical pain. They are taught much more about diving physics and medicine than a sport diver or civilian work diver is taught, and knowledge about (any kind of) underwater weapons, tactics and employment procedure. This forms the largest part of the training practical exercises, Fitness training and associated \\"sifting out\\" weeds out over 70% of the course participant in the first 6 weeks of the mine clearance diver training. See :de:Bild:Schwimmtaucher.jpg for the German armed forces diver badge. Expiration of the training Starting from week: *0: general military basic training at the naval technique school at Parow, Germany. *13: Swimming diver training course in the naval training centre of the navy in Neustadt / Holstein. *19: Initial mine clearance diver training in the training inspection of the specialized task forces of the navy (MiTaKp, combat frogmen company and naval weapon school in Eckernf≈çrde) *24 Mine clearance diver employment training (as above) *36.

In all countries the employments, operating conditions and employment regulations of the weapon divers are subject to secrecy. Combat frogmen and mine clearance divers differ clearly in their equipment, due to their different tasks. =Combat frogmen= Combat frogmen (Kampfschwimmer) operate offshore undiscovered and in shallow water, but mine clearance divers are used also in lakes and partly into deeper water. The preferred diving equipment of the combat frogmen is accordingly oxygen rebreathers, which reprocesses breathed out air and delivers only small masses of gas to the environment, so that the combat frogman cannot be discovered by rising bubbles. See also German commando frogmen. =Mine clearance diver= Clearance divers use either compressed air or mixed gas devices. With \\"oxygen cycle devices\\" the depth is limited to ; with \\"compressed air diving devices\\", which are used also in sport diving, the depth is ; with \\"mixed gas devices\\" with trimixes the oxygen portion according to the depth is reduced, thus the possible depth is higher. Since 2002 their compressed air diving devices \\"FTG\\" were replaced by computer-controlled mixture rebreathers called \\"Stealth\\". Apart from the mechanical and electronic special tools used by mine clearance divers, items of equipment are used which are also used by civilian divers. Diving safety The mine clearance diver boat M≈´hlhausen (replacement for the Stier which was decommissioned in 1994) and the diver school boat Langeoog (replacement for the ansa) in Eckernf√∂rde have stationary decompression chambers for up to 6 persons, in which divers can be treated immediately after accidents. To these, mobile decompression chambers can be clamped on by flanges. They are transported if necessary (e.g. by SAR helicopters in low- altitude flight) to Kiel, to the largest pressure chamber of the German Federal Navy, in which up to 12 people can be subjected to pressure, as a simulation of deep diving as part of training, or to treat decompression sickness. For this reason and due to the outstanding training, the number and the consequences of serious and deadly diving accidents with the mine clearance divers in the German navy are remarkably small compared to the comparable units in other countries. A component of the training is the Armed Forces boat driving licence and the training about naval underwater explosives. Afterwards the training takes place to troop leader in the context of the ship safeguard training. The members of the MiTaKp can participate in numerous special training courses beyond that. Most longer-serving mine clearance divers are qualified e.g. also as motorists BCE, helmet divers (nationally examined diver), the parachutist, and single fighter. The training and operational planning was aimed originally to defend against conventional and more unconventional underwater weapons in case of emergency in a possible confrontation of NATO with the Eastern Bloc. Since 1985 the tasks and course contents were modified accordingly. The training in removal of unorthodox exploding and fire devices (IEDD) still takes place in a \\"special training course for the fulfilment of special orders for employment\\". Employments Mine clearance divers were predominantly used from 1957 to 1984 in German territorial waters, mainly in the Baltic Sea and removing naval mines left over from wars. Also they joined in search and salvage of damaged ships, submarines and fallen airplanes. The most dangerous task of the mine clearance divers consisted of seeking out and salvaging weapons, which were sunk after the World War in the Baltic Sea, containing chemical agents and therefore today endangering navigation and fishery. Removing freshly laid mines in autumn 1985 in the Suez Canal was the first exterritorial use of German mine clearance divers. With this NATO employment in an international maritime route, with which the clearing equipment (Troika), developed for open ocean, could not be used, German mine clearance divers were used.

They were perhaps most known for their mutant metallic cover of Prince's \\"Kiss\\" which topped the UK Indie Chart in 1986, and peaked at No. 50 in the UK Singles Chart in January the following year. Despite signing for major label Virgin, and being favourites with the UK music press, they never enjoyed a major hit in the UK, although \\"Don't Get Mad‚Ä¶ Get Even\\" reached No. 8 on the US Billboard Hot Dance/Club Play chart. Musically they were a mixture of punk, hip hop, industrial rock and Northern soul. Steven E provided a distinctive strident nasal vocal style, often employing a megaphone. Striking cover art visuals were a collaboration between the group and The Designers Republic, who would go on to graphic design fame. They were the first band to be remixed by Public Enemy - AKA Hank Shocklee and Carl Ryder, who remixed ‚ÄúTake it‚Äù from ‚Äú1000 Years of Trouble‚Äù (1988). They were contemporaries of Pop Will Eat Itself, whose music also featured rock guitar, dance beats and copious samples, and other early UK samplist groups such as Coldcut and The JAMMs. History Steve Elvidge was a Leeds native, and attended St Michael's College (R.C.); being the most notable musical alumnus of that school since Jake Thackray. Neil Howson, (guitar) also from Leeds studied at Jacob Kramer College of Art, Geoff Taylor (Liverpool) and Jan Perry (Stockport) were students at Leeds Polytechnic, now Leeds Beckett University. Age of Chance first came to national attention in 1985, when their debut single, \\"Motorcity/ Everlasting Yeah\\" released on their own label, Riot Bible, was picked up and championed by BBC Radio 1 DJ, John Peel. A session followed, recorded at Maida vale studios and four songs, \\"Going, Going Gone Man\\", \\"Mob Hut\\", \\"The Morning After the Sixties\\" and \\"I Don't Know and I Don't Care\\" were recorded. \\"I Don't Know..\\" was re-recorded for Gunfire and Pianos, a compilation album released by Zigzag magazine. They released their second self-funded single, \\"Bible of the Beats\\" / \\"Liquid Jungle\\" in January 1986, which led to an invitation to contribute a track, \\"From Now On, This Will Be Your God\\" on the NME C86 compilation tape. The band made their London debut at the ICA Rock week in July 1986. A second Peel session was recorded in June 1986, with \\"Be Fast, Be Clean, Be Cheap\\", \\"From Now On, This Will be Your God\\", \\"Kiss\\" and \\"How the West was Won\\". \\"Kiss\\" was recorded for the John Peel session while the Prince single was still in the charts. The band then signed to the Sheffield independent record label, Fon, for \\"Kiss\\" and its remix 12\\"s and six track mini-LP Crush Collision. \\"Kiss\\" was No. 2 in John Peel's Festive Fifty for 1986. The band signed to Virgin in January 1987, and embarked on a nationwide UK tour. They recorded a Janice Long session comprising \\"Who's Afraid of the Big Bad Noise\\", \\"Hold On\\" and \\"Bible of the Motorcity Beats.\\" They began recording their first single for Virgin with producer Howard Gray: \\"Who's Afraid of the Big Bad Noise/Big Bad Rap\\" and then started their first Virgin album, One Thousand Years of Trouble. A second single \\"Don't Get Mad, Get Even\\" was released in October, followed by the album. In 1988, Channel 4 began using \\"Don't Get Mad...\\" as the music for the American Football programme, which ran over the next three years. The band began recording their second Virgin album in the summer at Rockfield in Wales. Original singer Steven-E left in September 1988, during the recording of their second LP, forcing the rest of the band to recruit a new singer, Charles Hutchinson, in January 1989, and \\"re-vocal\\" the LP, which was released as Mecca in 1990. The main single from that collection, \\"Higher Than Heaven\\" reached No. 53 in the UK, despite being voted \\"record of the week\\" by BBC Radio 1's breakfast show listeners. When Hutchinson left, Perry took on vocal duties briefly before the band split in 1991. Cover art Cover of \\"Kiss\\" A strong visual identity was developed by the band, from their clothes (notably featuring cycling tops, the idea for which came after seeing a cyclist standing at the bar in The Faversham public house in Leeds) to their cover art. The first singles had a punk like cut-up graphic design produced by the band featuring slogans and mini-manifestos. \\"Stay Young!! Say Yeah!! Call Each Other Bay-Beah!!\\" \\"You CAN live forever with the Age of Chance\\". The slogans and visual imagery were passed to The Designers Republic who produced a series of classic cover designs for the Kiss releases and the series of 1987 Virgin releases. The sleeve of Don't Get Mad ... Get Even was one of Q Magazine's 100 Best Record Covers Of All Time (2001), with the citation describing the collaborations as \\"Too intricate to rightfully exist in the pre-desktop publishing age, the sleeves were edgy, loaded, with menacing visual manifestos adorned with slogans ... alongside bar codes, cruise missiles and (first woman in space)Valentina Tereshkova's face.\\"Q Magazine's 100 Best Record Covers Of All Time (2001), Designer Ian Anderson recalled that \\"The way they were presented was very much as a philosophy; it was a punk attitude crossed with disco styling, that asked questions to get a reaction. Once the vocabulary was set, the sleeves almost designed themselves. We may have done the designs, but the language was created by the band.\\" Line-up * Steven Elvidge (vocals) * Geoff Taylor (bass guitar) * Neil Howson (lead guitar) * Jan Perry (percussion) * Charles Hutchinson (vocals on Mecca) Discography =Albums= * Kiss Crush Collision (mini LP, 1986) (UK Indie No. 4) * One Thousand Years of Trouble (1987) * Mecca (1990) =Singles= * \\"Motorcity\\" (1985) (UK Indie No. 26) * \\"Bible of the Beats\\" (1986) (UK Indie No. 3) * \\"The Twilight World of Sonic Disco EP\\" (collecting first 2 7\\" singles, 1986) * \\"Kiss\\" (1986) (UK Indie No. 1) (re-issued 1987) UK No. 50, (NZ No.21) * \\"Who's Afraid of the Big Bad Noise\\" (1987) (NZ No.34) * \\"Don't Get Mad ...

Unlike their digital cousin, the FPGA, the devices tend to be more application driven than general purpose as they may be current mode or voltage mode devices. For voltage mode devices, each block usually contains an operational amplifier in combination with programmable configuration of passive components. The blocks can, for example, act as summers or integrators. FPAAs usually operate in one of two modes: continuous time and discrete time. *Discrete-time devices possess a system sample clock. In a switched capacitor design, all blocks sample their input signals with a sample and hold circuit composed of a semiconductor switch and a capacitor. This feeds a programmable op amp section which can be routed to a number of other blocks. This design requires more complex semiconductor construction. An alternative, switched-current design, offers simpler construction and does not require the input capacitor, but can be less accurate, and has lower fan-out - it can drive only one following block. Both discrete-time device types must compensate for switching noise, aliasing at the system sample rate, and sample-rate limited bandwidth, during the design phase. *Continuous-time devices work more like an array of transistors or op amps which can operate at their full bandwidth. The components are connected in a particular arrangement through a configurable array of switches. During circuit design, the switch matrix's parasitic inductance, capacitance and noise contributions must be taken into account. Currently there are very few manufactures of FPAAs. On-chip resources are still very limited when compared to that of an FPGA. This resource deficit is often cited by researchers as a limiting factor in their research.  History  The term FPAA was first used in 1991 by Lee and Gulak. They put forward the concept of CABs that are connected via a routing network and configured digitally. Subsequently, in 1992 and 1995 they further elaborated the concept with the inclusion of op- amps, capacitors, and resistors. This original chip was manufactured using 1.2 ¬µm CMOS technology and operates in the 20 kHz range at a power consumption of 80 mW. Pierzchala et al introduced a similar concept named electronically- programmable analog circuit (EPAC). It featured only a single integrator. However, they proposed a local interconnect architecture in order to try and avoid the bandwidth limitations. The reconfigurable analog signal processor (RASP) and a second version were introduced in 2002 by Hall et al. Their design incorporated high-level elements such as second order bandpass filters and 4 by 4 vector matrix multipliers into the CABs. Because of its architecture, it is limited to around 100 kHz and the chip itself is not able to support independent reconfiguration. In 2004 Joachim Becker picked up the parallel connection of OTAs (operational transconductance amplifiers) and proposed its use in a hexagonal local interconnection architecture. It did not require a routing network and eliminated switching the signal path that enhances the frequency response. In 2005 Fabian Henrici worked with Joachim Becker to develop a switchable and invertible OTA which doubled the maximum FPAA bandwidth. This collaboration resulted in the first manufactured FPAA in a 0.13 ¬µm CMOS technology. In 2016 Dr. Jennifer Hasler from Georgia Tech. university designed a FPAA System on Chip that uses analog technology to achieve unprecedented power and size reductions.

History  The school opened in 1957 as a flagship campus for the new comprehensive education strategy, intended to replace the existing grammar, central and secondary modern schools. Much of the interior and fittings were avant garde and included specially designed 'Sedgehill furniture' that was later adopted by other schools run by the London County Council education department. In 1971 the joint head of science at the school, Donnahadh O'Shea, was jailed for 12 months for possessing explosives after an explosion on a train injured a woman. He was convicted of possessing 2 lb. of nitrocellulose powder and 3,454 priming caps.'Train blast denial by science master', The Times (26 January 1971), p. 3.'Teacher cleared of throwing bomb from train', The Times (2 February 1971), p. 4.'Teacher jailed over explosives', The Times (4 February 1971), p. 4. An assistant headteacher, Patrick Stack, was found hanged in an outbuilding in the school grounds in 2001. He had been suffering from depression. He had been awarded the MBE for his outstanding contribution to education in the Queen's birthday honours for 2000. In 2008, the School had over 1,800 pupils with over half from ethnic minorities. The school was re-built in 15 months (while the old school was still open) by the London Borough of Lewisham to create a state-of- the-art learning environment. The project cost ¬£6.3m and was carried out by Costain. The students moved into the new building in January 2009. Lewisham Council and the parents of the pupils were concerned in 2014 about suitable interventions to improve pupils' results, and support was offered from Bethnal Green Academy and Hayes School. By September 2017 the school had contracted to under 1,000 students. The United Learning academy trust became a 'school improvement partner', to address the longstanding criticism from Ofsted.Ofsted full inspection May 2018 The school then became a sister school to Lambeth Academy. This was to be for a three-year period and the school was governed by an interim executive body. Sister schools are financially connected and can have joint social activities for students. The partnership was successful from the interim board's point of view and parents have been told that this arrangement will become permanent. In September 2020 the school formally converted to academy status and is now sponsored by United Learning.

Houston Independent School District, 486 F.2d 137 (5th Cir. 1973) was an American legal case brought by a parent of a student in the Houston Independent School District in Houston, Texas suing on behalf of her daughter and fellow students to prevent the district from teaching evolution as fact and without reference to alternative theories. The plaintiffs claimed evolutionary theory endorsed a secularist religious view, and argued the school's failure to incorporate the teaching of a particular religious alternative to evolutionary theory as derived from the Bible's creation account held that religious view up to ridicule and contempt. To allow evolution while avoiding creationism was unconstitutional, the suit claimed, because it advanced one particular sectarian view over another. The plaintiffs maintained that the school's evolutionary teaching constituted \\"the establishment of a sectarian, atheistic religion\\" and was an interference of their own rights to the free exercise of religion as guaranteed by the Establishment clause in the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. The case is one of a series of legal battles over the teaching of evolution in American public schools, and the first to be initiated by opponents of such teaching. The suit was dismissed prior to trial, the presiding judge for the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas finding Wright had \\"wholly failed to establish the analogy\\" between the teaching of evolution and an establishment of religion. The Court held: > Plaintiffs' case depends in large measure upon their demonstrating a > connection between \\"religion,\\" as employed in the first amendment, and > Defendants' approach to the subject of evolution. The Court is convinced > that the connection is too tenuous a thread on which to base a first > amendment complaint. The judge, Woodrow B. Seals, outlined three findings. He found the Houston school district was not following any policy to promote secularism. Further, he found the free exercise of religion did not include any such right to be shielded from scientific theories which are incompatible with a particular religious belief. And he rejected the plaintiffs' proposal that the school district be court ordered to provide \\"equal time\\" in the curriculum for alternative theories, finding such an order would constitute unwarranted intrusion into the district's affairs. Wright appealed the decision to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. In 1973 the Appeals Court affirmed the lower court decision dismissing the suit. In June 1974 the United States Supreme Court refused to hear the case, and later lawsuits involving restrictions and impositions on evolution in school curricula reaffirmed the Wright decision.

View from \\"Croce del Termine\\" Suasa was an ancient Roman town in what is now the comune of Castelleone di Suasa, Marche, Italy. It is located in the Pian Volpello locality, in the valley of the Cesano River. History Suasa was founded by the Romans in the early 3rd century BC, after the Battle of Sentinum (295 BC), in a territory inhabited by the Senones. The town was crossed by a secondary branch of the Via Flaminia and by the Via Salaria Gallica, which connected it to Forum Sempronii (Fossombrone) and Ostra. In 232 BC, it became a prefecture and, in the 1st century BC, a municipium. Suasa started to decline from the 3rd century; in 409, it was sacked by Alarich's Goths during his march against Rome (see Sack of Rome). It was abandoned in the 6th century after the Gothic War, the population moving to nearby settlements. The remains have been excavated by the University of Bologna since 1987. The edifices found include: *an amphitheater *a theater *the Coiedii domus *a late-Republican era domus *the cardo maximus *a necropolis  The Archaeological Park  Entrance to Suasa amphitheater from a vomitorium. The Suasa archaeological park is an archaeological area in Castelleone di Suasa (province of Ancona, Marche, Italy). It includes the remains of the ancient town of Suasa, abandoned in the 6th century AD. The open-air museum of a Roman house (the Coiedii domus), of great interest because its size and architectonic complexity, can be visited in the park. The domus was inhabited over a long period, reaching its maximum splendour in the 2nd century AD. The mosaics discovered in the interior are splendid and are the most important unitary complex of the Marches. Mythological, floral, and geometric scenes can be admired, but above all, a magnificent marble floor created with over fifteen different kinds of stone. An avant-garde roofing and super-elevated passageways make the visit easily available. The large amphitheatre lies at the foot of the hill.

The roots of the partnership go as far back as 1989, but the partnership was officially established in 1996. Since then it created links with over 30 schools. It is one of the biggest international and long established school partnerships in the world. Some examples of projects within the Global Classroom Partnership include: Global classroom conference Since 1997, small groups of ten to twelve senior students from each partner school share ideas and information using Global Classroom's website in preparation for an annual Conference hosted on a rotating basis by one of the partner schools. Families of students and staff provide home stay opportunities and a programme enabling sharing of work prepared in advance along with cultural and sightseeing is arranged by the host school.

Learning school - student research Since 1999 the Global Classroom Partnership has enabled a senior student from each of the schools to join together as a small international team of student researchers led by two graduate coordinators to research aspects of learning and teaching in each school. With advice from Professor John MacBeath, Head of Leadership Education at Cambridge University this student research known as The Learning School also includes schools in Malmo Sweden and Canberra Australia in addition to the Global Classroom core schools. The Learning School project is one school self-evaluation model. School self-evaluation which engages students redresses outdated democratic imbalances in evaluation, encourages students to be participative and active contributors to learning evaluation and to be more responsible learners. The project has a uniquely international dimension, as the members which make up the research group represent the schools of an international partnership of schools known as the Global Classroom. Those nominated to become Learning School participants are typically either current or recent high school students. Over the course of ten months, the group conducts research into learning issues in each partnership school - taking them to a diverse range of countries and social, cultural and economic situations. This translates to a rich social, cultural, personal and academic learning experience for group members in particular, but also for students in participant schools, host families, wider communities and experts. Extended exchange Extended Exchange goes back to 1989 when the first links were established. The Global Partnership of schools offers senior students from each of the schools the opportunity to spend extended periods of study at any of the schools in the partnership. Ideally if reciprocal exchange arrangements can apply a senior student from one school swaps host family and school for an extended period of study and residence. The programme depends on the willingness of families of students to offer hospitality to visiting students. Students usually can spend up to one year in the chosen country and school. Video conferencing Since 2003 Anderson High School has been sharing aspects of learning and teaching by video conferencing. This began as a Future Learning and Teaching project involving senior students sharing Advanced Higher courses ‚Äì Maths with Nara Women‚Äôs Secondary School Japan, History and Modern Studies with South Peninsula High School Cape Town South Africa and Higher German with Graf Friedrich Schule Diepholz. The Video Conferencing project makes use of an advanced video conferencing technology. The video-conferencing sessions are an important part of learning and teaching within the Global Classroom and the partnership is currently extending the subjects and areas where it uses this technology. Sharing perspectives Sharing Perspectives aims to partner each class group of 12- and 13-year-olds at Anderson High School with a class group from each of the schools. The class groups work in and across subjects based on the following themes: *To hear ourselves as others hear us - structured around English lessons *To see ourselves as others see us ‚Äì structured around Social Subjects *What is a House and Home? ‚Äì structured around Art & Design, Technology and Science Students will share ideas, planning and preparations using the Blog / Discussion Forums with the sharing of applications materials work and outcomes integrated to learning and teaching. Shared images - Britain/Europe/Global A group of six Anderson High School students aged 13 ‚Äì 18 began sharing Images of themselves, their school and community with similar groups of students from Hawick High School, Ballyclare High School in Northern Ireland and Kidbrooke School in Greenwich London. As well as sharing images of Britain small groups of students aged 12 to 18 from partner schools in Czech Republic, Germany and Sweden will share Images of Europe. In the same format, this will become a Global Sharing Images project. Enterprise education Enterprise Education is a new emerging project within the Global Classroom Partnership. A senior student from each of the partner schools along with a student from a new potential partner school ‚Äì Trenton High School / West Campus in Trenton New Jersey USA have formed an International Enterprise and Development Team. Led by a Graduate Student and working in partnership with Shetland Catch and COPE Shetland the team will undertake market research for Shetland Catch and learn skills of working with young people with support needs from COPE Shetland and share these skills with an NGO Rainbow Trust in Hermanus South Africa. Asn Sharing learning, teaching and living with additional support needs students. A group of students with additional support needs from Anderson High School and from Minervaskolan in Ange Sweden exchanged information, material ideas and took part in video conferencing in preparation for exchange visits . For the Swedish students there was experience of early summer in Shetland and for Shetland students late winter in the middle of Sweden. Great experiences for all with plans to continue but with planning time during 2006/7.

Kythrea is under the de facto control of Northern Cyprus. History The larger-than-life bronze statue of Septimius Severus, found in Kythrea, now displayed in Cyprus Museum Kythrea is situated near the ancient city-kingdom of Chytroi, which was founded by Chytros, grandson of the Athenian King Akamas. According to one tradition, the name Kythrea derives from Chytroi (ŒßœçœÑœÅŒøŒπ > *ŒßœÖœÑœÅŒ≠Œ± > ŒöœÖŒ∏œÅŒ≠Œ±). According to another tradition, it derives from the name of the Greek Ionian island Kythera, from where millstones were transferred to Kythrea's watermills. The small town was watered for millennia by the Kefalovrysos spring; however, shortly after the 1974 Turkish invasion, the water stopped flowing. Other forms of the name include Chytri, Cythraia, Cythereia, Cythroi, Chytrides,Sophrone P√©trid√®s, \\"Chytri\\" in Catholic Encyclopedia (New York 1908) Chytros and Chytria. With the spread of Christianity in Cyprus, Chytroi became a bishopric. The first bishop, whose name is known is Pappus, is mentioned in the Life of Epiphanius of Salamis as having been bishop for 58 years of the \\"miserable town of Chytria\\", and as having died a martyr at some unspecified date, which must have been under either the pagan emperors Licinius or Maximinus II, or the Arian Constantius II. The acts of the Council of Chalcedon (451) show that Bishop Photinus was represented there by his deacon Dionysius, and those of the Second Council of Nicaea in 767 that Bishop Spyridon attended in person.Michel Lequien, Oriens christianus in quatuor Patriarchatus digestus, Paris 1740, Vol. II, coll. 1067-1070Raymond Janin, v.

XII, Paris 1953, col. 820 Contemporary documents are lacking concerning Demetrianus, whom Henri Gr√©goire described as perhaps the most obscure of the local saints of Cyprus. The medieval Leontios Machairas is the earliest writer to make even a brief mention of his name. According to the oldest Life of Demetrianos, published in the 18th century, he became bishop in around 885, was captured by Arabs and taken to Egypt with many of his faithful, but by his prayers obtained the liberation of all.Henri Gr√©goire, Saint D√©m√©trianos, √©v√™que de Chytri, in Byzantinische Zeitschrift 16 (1907), pp. 204‚Äì240 No longer a residential bishopric, Chytri is today listed by the Catholic Church as a titular see.Annuario Pontificio 2013 (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 2013 ), p. 868 Kythrea is a remarkable archaeological area.

A team of some ninety members of staff caters for approximately 48 students, of whom about one fifth are girls, and the school also accepts part-time students. Newbury Manor School is run by the Priory Group. It also holds the Investors in People Award. History The school has its origins in Ravenscroft School, founded at Yelverton, Devon, in the 1930s and later moved to Beckington Castle and then to Farleigh House at Farleigh Hungerford, near Bath. This began as a prep school, but in the 1970s it found a new role as a special school specializing in teaching dyslexic children, and in 1996 it was re-organised as Farleigh College, a new institution which took over its staff, pupils, and premises. Farleigh College was launched in September 1996 with forty children, of whom thirty were dyslexic and ten had been diagnosed with Asperger's, and at the outset it had a five-year lease on Farleigh House.Bradshaw, Stephen (2012) Asperger's Syndrome-that Explains Everything. Jessica Kingsley Publishers, London. . p. 16 The name of Farleigh College was kept after September 2000, when the school moved to Newbury House, near Mells, an 18th-century Grade II* listed country house. In 2013, the name of the secondary school was changed to Newbury Manor School, while the \\"Farleigh College\\" identity was kept for the later years. Farleigh Further Education College Originally launched in September 2000 on the Farleigh House site to meet the needs of young people with Asperger's, a year later Farleigh Further Education College moved to Frome. It is still operated by the Priory Group as a Further Education College for students aged 16 to 19 (upon entry) with Aspergers Syndrome and associated disorders. This is registered with the Learning and Skills Council and is a full member of the National Association of Specialist Colleges of Further Education (NATSPEC). Farleigh Further Education College gives learners the opportunity to reach their potential and develop academic and life skills for independence and integration into the community. Learners have ambitions to live independent lives in the community and they aim to facilitate this. Learners may have attended special schools or have experienced difficulty at mainstream schools or colleges. The main residence is North Parade. There are other residences which the students can choose to live at and they are Tallowood, Maple, Ashleigh Grove, Sandusky Mews, Bridgwater and Delta Close.Accommodation-and- facilities at priorygroup.com Students go to a mainstream college during the day, choosing their course during their enrolment before the start of year one.

He continued to study at the Graduate Studies R.P.I., New York University. After graduation Hermann became manager of Management Education for General Electric (GE) in 1970. His primary responsibility was to oversee training program design; specifically, maintaining or increasing an individual's productivity, motivation, and creativity. In 1978, Herrmann created the \\"Herrmann Participant Survey Form.\\" He profiled workshop participant's thinking styles and learning preferences in accord with brain dominance theory. This quickly evolved into a theory of stable brain quadrants, independent of brain anatomy facts, each with its own characteristic ‚Äúgenius.‚Äù He developed the Herrmann Brain Dominance Instrument (HBDI), the scored and analyzed Participant Survey, and designed the Applied Creative Thinking Workshop (ACT), which remains a leading personality assessment instrument and workshop topic in corporate training. Herrmann's contributions brought him worldwide recognition. In 1992, he received the Distinguished Contribution to Human Resource Development Award from the American Society for Training & Development (ASTD). In 1993, he was elected President of The American Creativity Association.  Work  Herrmann was a pioneer in exploring, explicating and expanding understanding of the brain in close-up view as a four quadrant system. He was one of the first to ascertain, through testing, how individuals use or prefer one, two, three or all four possible brain quadrants. His approach to brain balance was to encourage experiments, use and exercise of weaker quadrants through live, in- person games, small group processes and discussion. This evolved into more and better ideas about whole-brainedness. He spent 30 years from approximately 1964-1996, exploring and explicating Herrmann Brain Dominance Instrument to teaching, learning, increased self-understanding and enhanced creative thinking capabilities, on both an individual and corporate level.

Located in the Lower Galilee, south of Carmiel and in the vicinity of the Atzmon mountain ridge, north of the Beit Netofa Valley, it falls under the jurisdiction of Misgav Regional Council. In it had a population of . Modern Yodfat is named after the Second Temple-era town of the same name and is situated to the north of the archaeological mound.Encyclopedia Judaica, Joptapata, Keter Publishing, Jerusalem, 1978, volume 10, p. 300. Yodfat was established in 1960 by graduates of the Hebrew Reali School of Haifa. History =Antiquity= Site of ancient Yodfat. Ancient Yodfat (Jotapata), situated to the south east of the modern moshav, is mentioned in the Mishna as a fortified Jewish village dating from the time of Joshua, corresponding with the Iron Age.The Mishnah, (ed.) Herbert Danby, Arakhin 9:6 (p. 553 - note 10) \\"Jotapata may be the same as Jotbah which was the birthplace of Meshullemeth, ... the mother of Amon, King of Judah (2 Kgs. 21:19).\\" Archaeological explorations of the site, however, have thus far revealed a modest village established some time during the Hellenistic period, between the 4th and 3rd centuries BCE. As the Hasmonean kings extended their influence into the Galilee during the last decades of the 2nd century BCE, a change of population occurred at Yodfat and the village was populated by Jews. According to the Mishnah, the town of Yodfat was encompassed by a wall before the Israelite conquest of Canaan under Joshua. Greeks called it Iotapata ().Stephanus of Byzantium, Ethnica, ¬ß I344.4 =Classic era= First Jewish‚ÄìRoman War Memorial to the Jewish defenders of Yodfat, which fell to Roman forces on July 20, 67 CE By the first century CE Yodfat had expanded to encompass an area of 50 dunams (13 acres). Its siege and subsequent destruction in 67 CE are described in Josephus Flavius' The Wars of the Jews, his chronicle of the Revolt against the Romans. Led by future emperor Vespasian, three Roman legions ‚Äî Legio V Macedonica, X Fretensis, and XV Apollinaris ‚Äî besieged Yodfat, meeting strong Jewish resistance. After 47 days the city fell by treachery, and Josephus describes the death of 40,000 Jews and the enslavement of 1,200 women and children. Yodfat was razed and burnt on the first of the Hebrew month of Tammuz. While a few dozen remaining fighters committed suicide, Josephus managed to survive this pact and was captured by the Romans. After the fall After its capture by the Romans, Yodfat was re-established at a nearby site by refugees from Jerusalem, among them the priestly family of Miyamin. This town is mentioned in the Talmud as the home of Rabbi Menachem of Jotapata (Zev. 110b). It flourished for another 300 years, before being destroyed once again. After that, the village lay in ruins until 1960. =Modern times= Yodfat was re- established in 1960 by graduates of the Hebrew Reali School of Haifa. It is currently an agricultural Jewish community, located about 1 km north-west of the ancient ruins. The modern village was built by traditional Jews, seeking to preserve traditional values in parallel to agricultural work. At first, the village was an observation site of the JNF, while its inhabitants were mostly the JNF employees. Later, the village became an agricultural society, with most of its residents working the nearby lands. By the 1990s, the village turned into a larger communal center, with a larger variety of professions for its residents. Today it includes 200 families. Agricultural community of Yodfat Archaeology Ancient Yodfat was first identified in 1847 by Ernst Gustav Schultz (1811‚Äì1851), Egyptologist and Prussian consul in Jerusalem, using the geographical and topographical descriptions provided by Josephus, as well as by the phonetic similarity to the adjacent ruin of Khirbet Shifat. Six excavation seasons were carried out at the site between 1992 and 2000, under the direction of Mordechai Aviam on behalf of the Israel Antiquities Authority and the University of Rochester. These have revealed remains of fortifications, cisterns and extensive evidence of the large scale battle which took place at Yodfat, including a mass grave containing human remains. Economy In 1968, Yodfat established a flower bulb nursery which exports millions of bulbs throughout the world. The nursery employs forty people and has an R&D; facility for developing new hybrids, including the Ornithogalum dubium and Cyclamen persicum. Yodfat's Jerusalem hybrid F1 anemones and Galilee hybrid F1 anemones are hand-pollinated and unique in the cut-flower trade. A short walk from Yodfat there is the \\"Goats with the Wind farm\\", a family-run organic goat cheese farm and restaurant, founded in 1993 by former residents of Yodfat. The farm's walls and buildings were constructed over time out of stones collected from the surrounding area. See also *Tarichaea *Bersabe Bibliography *Josephus, The Wars of the Jews, iii. 7.

Gold and Fizdale met during their student years at the Juilliard School.accessed August 25, 2006 They formed a lifelong gay partnership and shared interests in music (forming one of the most important piano duos of the 20th century)Jean-Pierre Thiollet, 88 notes pour piano solo, ¬´ Solo de duo ¬ª, Neva Editions, 2015, p.97-98. , travel, and cooking.  Two- piano ensemble  Gold and Fizdale commissioned from American composers and premi√®red a number of works for piano duo in the second half of the 20th century, including works by John Cage (\\"A Book of Music\\" (1944) which is one of Cage's earliest experiments in using the prepared Piano), Paul Bowles, Virgil Thomson, Ned Rorem and others. Among their friends were American literary and cultural figures such as Truman Capote, James Schuyler, George Balanchine, Jerome Robbins, among others. In 1948, they were part of the wave of American artists, musicians and writers who took advantage of the first possibility since the end of World War II to freely travel in Europe. They arrived in Paris with a letter of introduction from Marcelle de Manziarly to Germaine Tailleferre of Les six who invited them to a lunch with Francis Poulenc and Georges Auric. This lunch ended with Auric and Tailleferre taking the score of Thomson's \\"The Mother of Us All\\", which Thomson had given as a gift, turning it upside down on the piano and having Poulenc singing all of the roles (including Susan B. Anthony) in nonsense English syllables which were supposedly an imitation of Gertrude Stein's Libretto while Tailleferre and Auric improvised a four-hands version of Thomson's score.Gold and Fitzdale (sic), Misia, the Life of Misia Sert, William Morrow 1981, cited in Georges Hacquard, \\"Germaine Tailleferre: la Dame des Six\\" (L'Harmattan 1997) pp. 143-144 Tailleferre invited the couple to her home in Grasse to spend two months while she was writing her ballet Paris-Magie and her opera Il √©tait Un Petit Navire. She wrote two-piano versions of both works and gave them to the duo as a gift. These manuscripts were later donated to the Library of Congress after the death of Robert Fizdale. Tailleferre later dedicated two other works to Gold and Fizdale: her Toccata for Two Pianos and her Sonata for Two Pianos.Clinton-Narboni Duo Germaine Tailleferre: Music for Two Pianos and Piano Four-hands Elan recordings 1997 - liner notes Francis Poulenc also wrote his own Sonata for Two Pianos for \\"the Boyz\\" (as he called them), a commission which was paid by their mutual friend the American Soprano and arts patron Alice Swanson Esty, according to Poulenc's correspondence. The duo also recorded a number of recordings featuring works by Les six, Vittorio Rieti, and other composers, as well as a series of Concerto recordings with Leonard Bernstein and The New York Philharmonic, including the Poulenc Concerto for Two Pianos, The Mozart Two Piano Concerto and Saint-Sa√´ns's \\"Carnival of the Animals\\". Bobby Fizdale was born Robert Fish, the son of John and Rose Fish of Chicago. Had a brother Walter. Both Gold and Fizdale were of Russian Jewish descent.  Literary and culinary careers  In the late 1970s, Arthur Gold began to have problems with his hands which made it difficult for him to perform, so the duo began to write biographical works, including \\"Misia: the Life of Misia Sert\\" (William Morrow 1981), and \\"The Divine Sarah: a Biography of Sarah Bernhardt\\" (Knopf 1991). The duo also began writing food articles for Vogue magazine and began a television cooking show.

He played lead guitar for The Clash from 1983 until the band's breakup in 1986. Life and career Sheppard was educated at Bristol Grammar School, one of Bristol's leading public schools, and was in the same year as fellow musician Mark Stewart of The Pop Group. He started at 16 with The Cortinas, named after a well-known British car, the Ford Cortina. The band moved from R&B; towards covering songs by punk forerunners like the New York Dolls and The Stooges. \\"In retrospect, I suppose we were very hip,\\" Sheppard says. \\"We were listening to the right records, as we were right there at the right time.\\" The Cortinas' singles, \\"Fascist Dictator\\" and \\"Defiant Pose\\" both appeared on Step Forward, the label run by Police manager Miles Copeland, as did their only album \\"True Romances\\". The band split up in September 1978, after which Sheppard played in a number of bands, including The Viceroys and The Spics, a Bristol-based big band. Sheppard moved to California, then back to Britain. When The Clash sacked Mick Jones in 1983, Sheppard and Vince White replaced him, and he toured America and Europe with them in 1984, playing on their final album Cut the Crap. The album attracted criticism through manager Bernie Rhodes' intrusive production and use of a drum machine. When \\"This Is England\\" reached a number 24 in the UK charts, Sheppard is quoted as saying: \\"I remember sitting in a different city watching it, thinking, 'There isn't a band'\\". The Clash finally split up shortly afterwards. From 1986 to 1989 he collaborated with Gareth Sager (formerly of The Pop Group and Rip Rig + Panic) in Head, but their three albums made little impact. Sheppard next worked with Koozie Johns in Shot, which signed with I.R.S. Records in 1991, with Copeland as manager; the band's recordings were never released. Sheppard moved to Perth, Australia in 1993, and has formed/played in two local bands, Heavy Smoker and the New Egyptian Kings with Shakir Pichler. Sheppard owns the Elroy clothing store on Beaufort Street in Mount Lawley. In July 2002, it was suggested that he would be guest guitarist on a Japanese tour with Koozie Johns' new band, Sinnerstar, but the tour was cancelled. In 2007 Sheppard formed The DomNicks with Dom Mariani (The Stems, The Someloves, DM3), together with bass player Howard Shawcross (The Elks) and drummer Marz Frisina (The Chevelles). This combo play a mix of Mariani and Sheppard originals with a spread of 1960s and 1970s garage rock and soul material. In 2009 they released an EP, Hey Rock 'n' Roller, which was produced by Wayne Connolly (The Vines, You Am I). The DomNicks toured with the Hoodoo Gurus and performed in Sydney and Melbourne at the Joe Strummer tribute concert, 'Revolution Rock'.

Bend is an unincorporated community in Lampasas and San Saba Counties in western Central Texas. The population was 1,678 as of the 2010 census. It is located on Farm to Market Road 580 on the western leg of a horseshoe-shaped bend in the Colorado River. The Lampasas County portion of Bend is part of the Killeen‚ÄìTemple‚ÄìFort Hood Metropolitan Statistical Area. History Settlement of the area began in the mid-19th century. In 1854, the community took the name Schleicher's Bend, after an early settler Gustav Schleicher. By 1856, it was called McAnelly's Bend after Robert Daugherty McAnelly, a landowner on the Lampasas side of the river. The community exists on both sides of the Colorado River, the Lampasas (west) side of the river is known locally as \\"Little Bend\\". When the application for a post office on the San Saba side of the river was made in the late 1870s, the names Little Breeches and Bend were submitted; the Bend Post Office opened in 1879 and has continuously operated ever since. Bend had a population around 400 in 1890. For most of the 20th century, however, the community recorded 100 to 125 residents. Sulphur Springs Three miles south of Bend, on the Colorado River, was the Victorian resort and spa of Sulphur Springs. It fell into disuse during the Great Depression, but was revived in the 1980s as a fishing resort. Jumbo Hollis In the early 20th century, extensive pecan orchards were planted in the area. By mid-century, the Hollis native pecan had become the region's cash crop. Bend boosters consider the Jumbo Hollis, a tree whose name is derived from its unusually large fruit and its first owner, Thomas I. Hollis, to be the world's most productive pecan tree. When other native pecan trees averaged 70 to 80 nuts per pound, Jumbo's averaged 33. At the 1904 World's Fair, Jumbo Hollis pecans won the bronze medal for being the largest displayed. The tree's record year was 1919, when it produced 1,015 pounds of nuts. Education The Little Bend school closed in the 1920s and the Bend school was consolidated with San Saba schools in 1960. The San Saba County portion of Bend is served by the San Saba Independent School District, while the Lampasas Independent School District serves Little Bend, the Lampasas County portion of the community. Transportation Farm to Market Road 580 crosses the Colorado River at Eagle Ford Crossing, connecting Bend with Little Bend. In 1884, a cable-line ferry was installed at Eagle Ford Crossing, and it was replaced by a bridge in 1902. The main road in Bend was paved in 1960.

The objective clearly is to bring a sense of awe to the proceedings. Each performer represents a particular deity and is sponsored by devotees as a prayer offering. These dancers are viewed as being possessed by the gods when they are in their act, with devotees queuing up to meet them to share woes and wishes.

Cherokee became a county center of higher education when Francis Marion Behrns established the Cherokee Academy in 1894. Two years later, the name was changed to West Texas Normal and Business College. A building that originally belonged to the college was purchased from Behrns on April 4, 1911, to house Cherokee Junior College. In 1921, it was sold to the county school district to serve as a high school. The community population was around 250 during the 1920s.

The nearest stations to the south and north of the tunnel are Kowloon Tong and Tai Wai respectively. Today, the tunnel carries the MTR East Rail Line metro service and through trains to Mainland China. There are actually two tunnels of this name. The first () opened in 1910 and operated until its replacement () came into operation following its 1981 completion. History =First tunnel= A team of surveyors was commissioned to plan the route for the KCR British Section in 1905. Two routes were proposed: #Construction of a tunnel 1.5 mile (2.4 km) long through Beacon Hill, then following the west coast of Tolo Harbour #Routing through western New Territories and Castle Peak Bay Although option two was less of an engineering challenge, the overall route was longer, and passed through less economically active areas; therefore option one was selected. Works on the railway to the border started early 1906. Construction of the tunnel, referred to as Tunnel No.2 in the plan (since it was the second tunnel out from the Kowloon terminus), was the greatest engineering project in Asia of its time. Construction of the tunnel presented great engineering challenges during construction of the line, and local workers were very reluctant to work underground due to feng shui-related objections. In the end, Italian workers were employed. \\"On a doctor's advice, all the Italians working on the Beacon Hill tunnel were housed high up on the hillsides and a ropeway was built to slide them gently down to work each day.\\" The tunnel cost ¬£298,500 to build and opened with the rest of the line on 1 October 1910, together with four smaller tunnels along the line. It accommodated a single standard track with a standard gauge of . Throughout its operating life, the tunnel was noted for its fume problems, due to its relatively steep gradient of 1%. The tunnel was closed upon completion of the new one, and is now partially occupied by several town gas pipelines, operated by The Hong Kong and China Gas Company. The potential for damage to the pipes was a factor in determining the intensity of blasting during construction of the Sha Tin to Central Link, thereby protecting the old tunnel as a whole.SCL - NEX/2206 EIA Study for Tai Wai to Hung Hom Section, Appendix 13B, Use of Explosives, p36.

Originally recorded as the band's first (and unnamed) demo (while the band was still known by their original moniker, Bruce Banner), it was handed at out the band's local shows to fans and attendees. As a result of the popular demo tape, the band won a contract with local New Jersey punk specialist label, Blackout! Records. The demo was then renamed \\"Posthumous\\" and re-released as a CD-EP. It was the first of two recordings the band released with Blackout! before leaving for Ferret Music. It was released in June, 2003. Overview Debate continues over what genre this band fits into and this EP was probably where it all started. The opening track, \\"Outgunned\\", has metal qualities ‚Äì including Slayer-like riff flourishes, but the vocal style throughout is undeniably hardcore punk. \\"Rattlesnakes\\", \\"The Screaming\\", and \\"Marked For Life\\", on the other hand are more in the straightforward hardcore punk mould, especially influenced by the New York hardcore subgenre. Fast-paced songs with trademark refrains ‚Äì commonly referred to as breakdowns. While \\"The Screaming\\" does contain a small amount of metal influence, \\"Marked For Life\\" is probably more comparable to an early Black Flag track. The EP's closing track, \\"Trial By Fire\\", brings all these influences together to form a song which is, in the early part, quite technical metal.

Hercules first appears in All Star Comics #8 (December 1966) as part of a Wonder Woman story, and was created by William Moulton Marston and Harry G. Peter, in the first of several incarnations. Later versions appeared in Superman #28 (May 1966), created by Jerry Siegel and Ira Yarbrough, Wonder Woman #105 (April 1967) and Hercules Unbound #1 (October 1975) created by Gerry Conway and Jos√© Luis Garc√≠a-L√≥pez. Fictional character biography =Pre-Crisis on Infinite Earths= Hercules Unbound #1, by Jos√© Luis Garc√≠a-L√≥pez. In the Golden Age, he was mentioned in the origin of the amazons as a slave to them, and he was able to escape by tricking Hippolyta (spelled 'Hippolyte' in the original issue) into giving him her golden girdle on the bequest of Ares (spelled 'Mars') who hated the Amazons. Hercules was shown as an archetypal muscle- bound man wearing a lion-skin, and only appeared in flashbacks. A picture of him, during Wonder Woman's time, shows him as the God of Strength with black hair and a beard. In the universe of DC Comics, Hercules was used on several occasions before Crisis on Infinite Earths. One of his first appearances is in December 1966 in the pages of All-Star Comics #8, where he appears alongside several characters from Greek mythology in the first appearance of Wonder Woman. Hercules is depicted as a brutish 'hero,' who represented masculine violence, and one of his 12 labors is deconstructed as a treacherous act to enslave the Amazons under Queen Hippolyte. \\"In the days of Ancient Greece,\\" relates Hyppolyte to her daughter, \\"we Amazons were the foremost nation in the world. In Amazonia, women ruled and all was not well. Then one day, Hercules, the strongest man in the world, stung by taunts that he couldn't conquer the Amazon women, selected his strongest and fiercest warriors and landed on our shores. I challenged him to personal combat -- because I knew that with my MAGIC GIRDLE, given me by Aphrodite, Goddess of Love, I could not lose. And win I did! But Hercules, by deceit and trickery, managed to escape my evil clutches--and soon we Amazons were taken into slavery. And Aphrodite, angry at me for having succumbed to the wiles of men, would do naught to help us! Finally our submission to men became unbearable -- we could stand it no longer -- and I appealed to the Goddess Aphrodite again. This time not in vain, for she relented and with her help, I secured the MAGIC GIRDLE from Hercules. With the Magic Girdle in my possession, it didn't take us long to overcome our masters, the MEN -- and taking from them their entire fleet, we set sail for another shore, for it was Aphrodite's condition that we leave the man-made world and establish a new world of our own!\\" Subsequently, in Wonder Woman (first series) #1, cover-dated summer 1967, the episode is recapped. Hercules is written as \\"The God of Strength\\" who \\"was half-mortal and half-God! When a mere child, he strangled two fierce serpents sent to slay him. He performed twelve labors requiring prodigious strength and upon his earthly death, was taken to Mount Olympus to dwell among the Gods ever after.\\" (Wonder Woman #1, 1968). Thus, in his first appearance, Hercules has already finished his heroic deeds and has ascended to the status of a god. The same issue reiterates Hercules' deception and subsequent enslavement of the Amazons, this time being said to have been spurred on by the God of War, Mars, whose swordsmen \\"slew their weaker brothers and plundered them\\" and sold women as slaves \\"cheaper than cattle.\\" When Aphrodite creates her race of Amazons to overcome Mars' slaves, the God of War \\"inspired Hercules, strongest man in the world, to make war on the Amazons.\\" This Hercules is portrayed as a drunken, brutish warrior in his lion-skin, as mentioned above, who is determined to \\"take the magic girdle\\" of Hippolyte, challenging the Queen of the Amazons in personal combat. Upon being defeated by Hippolyte, he is given the chance \\"to return home and leave\\" but he conspires to \\"make love to her and steal the magic girdle\\" instead. Hercules feigns surrender and woos Hippolyte with his promise of \\"eternal friendship\\", while his comrades make merry with the Amazons. Once he seduces Hippolyte to remove the magic girdle, he and his men proceed to bind the prisoners, loot Amazonia and enslave the Amazons. It is not until the intervention of the Goddess Aphrodite that Hippolyte is able to recover her girdle and best the brutish 'hero' of Man's World. She takes her Amazons and leaves the world of men to form Paradise Island. Thus, this original appearance of Hercules subverts the heroic archetype, whose machoism is used to deconstruct traditional stories about heroism. 'Hercules' is also used several times in allusion in both Superman and Wonder Woman comics to allude to feats of strength. In Action Comics #7, cover-dated December 1938, Superman is said to be \\"A Modern Day Hercules\\"; while in Sensation Comics #2, cover- dated February 1967) he is mentioned to compare Wonder Woman's strength, along with other gods and goddesses from Greek Mythology: \\"As lovely as Aphrodite -- as wise as Athena -- with the speed of Mercury and the strength of Hercules, WONDER WOMAN brings to America a new hope and salvation from Old World evils, conquest, and aggression!\\" In other comics, Hercules is used as a foil to Superman. In these Silver Age books, Hercules usually appears as a giant, and frequently tests his strength with the Bible character Samson and another giant named Zha-Vam, to whom he granted strength, as well as with Superman. In one story, he is transported to the 20th century by Lex Luthor, and, in the guise of reporter Roger Tate, falls in love with Lois Lane. He gains power from other gods and puts Superman into a 100-year sleep with the pipe of Apollo, saying that he will only revive Superman if Lois marries him. However, Venus realizes what has happened and wakes Superman up. After this, Hercules is tricked into flying back in time with the sandals of Mercury, and loses his memory of the events. In 1975, DC produced a comic book series titled Hercules Unbound, featuring the adventures of Hercules in a post-apocalyptic future. This Hercules looked different from the other DC interpretations - he had long black hair and no beard. The series lasted 12 issues. It made use of characters and concepts, such as The Atomic Knights and the intelligent animals from Jack Kirby's Kamandi, the Last Boy on Earth series as an attempt to tie in some of the future series. There, we see this version of Hercules chained to a rock outcropping in the Mediterranean. He escapes and learns that in the centuries he had been chained by Ares, humans had not only made great scientific progress but also used that same science to destroy the human world by means of nuclear weapons. He wanders the world making friends along the way and battling monsters, mad gods, and warlords that threatened the remaining humans. It climaxed with him saving Olympus from the gods' evil duplicates and, having been deceived by Zeus, deciding to stay in the human world. It closed with him walking away into the night with his girlfriend Jenny. It was later hinted that this version of Hercules was actually part of a dream suffered by Gardner Grayle, but was later shown to have existed somewhere in the Multiverse and was eliminated during the Crisis on Infinite Earths. Jos√© Luis Garc√≠a-L√≥pez drew the first six issuesJos√© Luis Garc√≠a-L√≥pez checklist http://sites.google.com/site/joseluisgarcialopezchecklist/ and Walt Simonson drew the remainder of the series. Wally Wood inked several issues. =Post- Crisis on Infinite Earths= Wonder Woman After the reboot of the DC universe in Crisis, Heracles ‚Äî the Greek spelling ‚Äî appeared in the pages of Wonder Woman. George P√©rez, putting Greek mythology at the center of Wonder Woman's world, relates the tale of Heracles' and his men's conquest of the Amazons and his rape of Queen Hippolyta, and their revenge upon him. Heracles subduing Hippolyta. Art by George P√©rez. During Diana's Challenge of the Gods storyline, she discovered that Heracles was transformed into a colossal stone pillar within Doom's Doorway, and was supporting Themyscira's weight for several millennia. In this stone state, he was tormented and scarred by various mythological creatures, feeling the pain inflicted by them but not being able to do anything about it. This was the punishment given to him by his Olympian family for his past transgressions. Gaining his original form back, he begged the Amazons for forgiveness. Though some of the Amazons still harbored hatred for their past rapes and humiliation, most of them were moved by Heracles' newfound humility, and Queen Hippolyta asked her people to search their hearts for the strength to forgive, which they eventually did. Doing so herself, Hippolyta not only forgave Heracles, but shared a brief romance with him before he left the mortal realm to return to his father in Olympus. Later, John Byrne did an inconclusive storyline in which Heracles appeared in the contemporary world and schemed to take revenge on the Amazons by seducing Wonder Woman. He did this by making an agreement with a mortal Golden Age superhero named Harold Champion. In exchange for his identity, Heracles gave Champion admission into Olympus. Once this was agreed upon, Heracles used the Mirror of Circe to alter his appearance into that of Champion. He proceeded to befriend Wonder Woman as a \\"new\\" friend, helping her deal with such problems as a confrontation with a duplicate of the monstrous Doomsday. Heracles' identity was eventually revealed and he resumed his life on Olympus. War of the Gods In the Post-Crisis DC Universe, the Roman Gods existed separately from the Greek ones after Darkseid tricked them into splitting up so they could be worshipped by two different cultures at the same time; only after the \\"War of the Gods\\" did the two versions merge again. So in effect, both Heracles and Hercules existed, and they merged into one being during John Byrne's run on the comic. One Year Later A revamped Hercules reappears during the events of One Year Later. Now shaven and bearing an updated version of the armor worn in the Hercules Unbound series, his place in the Wonder Woman comic has been renewed as a fellow agent of Olympus, who occasionally aids Diana and even replaces her in battle. He is referred to as \\"Wonder Man\\" by Cheetah and Nemesis. He temporarily sets up base in the Greek Embassy. Wonder Woman (vol. 3) #4 reveals that Hercules lied about his reasons for returning to Earth. As one of the inhabitants of Olympus who rejected Athena's decision to remove themselves from the mortal realm, Hercules journeyed to Tartarus in hopes of recruiting Ares to aid him in returning to Earth. Instead, he found Circe who, upon hearing Hercules' story and not wanting to spend eternity in limbo with Athena, decided to partner with Hercules instead. However, this did not last long, as Circe betrayed him. The two part as enemies once Circe magically binds him to a rock. Some time before the events of Wonder Girl, but after the events of \\"Who Is Wonder Woman?\\", Hercules encounters and battles Gog (who is killing gods and those who claim to be gods). After suffering a blast from Gog's staff, Hercules is incapacitated and encounters Superman and his Earth-22 counterpart. He enters into combat with the two of them, but is ultimately defeated. Hercules' physical appearance here is closer to the one seen in \\"Who Is Wonder Woman?\\". In addition, he is described as a \\"god\\" (and not a demigod, as in Wonder Girl) and wears gold bracelets instead of the gray shackles Zeus will place on him as punishment. Wonder Girl A being claiming to be Hercules' father Zeus eventually frees Hercules from his prison and informs him that he must partner with his half sister Cassie Sandsmark. Together Hercules and Cassie try to discover who is attacking the remaining Olympian gods. Soon into their search they are attacked by the Female Furies. Hercules stops the fight by explaining that he is allied with the Furies in hopes of rescuing the gods, or, failing that, starting a new pantheon with them. The Furies have their own plans, though, and are only using Hercules to get to Cassandra. The Furies soon betray Hercules, with Bloody Mary using her bite to gain power over Hercules, forcing him to do what the Furies want. The Furies then kidnap Cassandra's mother to lure her into a trap. Aided by the Olympian, Cassandra goes into battle, being forced to fight her own brother. The Teen Titans and Wonder Woman herself show up to help out, which evens the odds. After Bloody Mary is murdered by the New God killer, Hercules is freed from her spell and immediately saves his sister from being kidnapped by the fleeing Furies. After being questioned by Wonder Woman, Hercules tells her he was freed by Zeus and sought his closest relative‚ÄîCassandra‚Äîfor help. He explains that Zeus freed him to help stop \\"the Great Disaster,\\" which Hercules does not know much about. However, there were two conditions for his release: he must always wear his gauntlets to remind him of his punishment (similar to the punishment that the gods placed on the Amazons) and he must give up his godhood, becoming a demigod again. Rather than being upset, Hercules is happy to be human again and having his mother's blood flowing through his veins. Although Wonder Woman is initially skeptical, Cassandra vouches for Hercules, telling Diana that he has saved her life twice. Hercules is allowed to remain free, to complete his \\"labors\\" and make up for the things that he has done. The series mentions several important facts about Hercules, including his cycle of crime, punishment, and redemption; gods and other beings (Hera and Circe being mentioned by name) using him to commit great evil (such as the death of his family); and his uneasy relationship with the Amazons and Wonder Woman in particular. The Hercules that empowers the Marvels is apparently different from this Hercules, sharing only his name. He is one of the Lords of Magic and possesses superhuman strength. =Post-Flashpoint= In the newest continuity, Hercules is reintroduced in the pages of Aquaman Aquaman (vol. 7) as a maddened prisoner alongside the monstrous children descended from the Titans called the Giant Born. It was revealed that, thousands of years ago, the son of Zeus sacrificed himself so that Atlan, King of Atlantis of the bygone era, could trap them within a hellish penal dimension opened using the Maelstrom,Aquaman (vol. 7) #29an extra-dimensional translocation gateway which enabled the Atlanteans of old to traverse the world as well as to other worlds. When accidentally released from their Tartaran prison by a misguided archaeologist, these fiends of old are intercepted by Aquaman and sent in their former jailer; whose mind had been corrupted by their torment and dark magics over the years to do battle with him while they made their escape. After a lengthy battle between him and the Sea King, Hercules was bested when he tried to drown Arthur, who dragged him into the sea, beating him into unconsciousness, before sending him back through the Maelstrom into a maze of the Minotaur-like dimension. Hercules is later seen living a quiet, peaceful life as a human in the mountains outside Oregon. He is confronted by Darkseid's daughter Grail, who kills him and steals his life force in order to feed it to an adolescent Darkseid.Wonder Woman (vol. 6) #31 Powers and abilities As the son of Zeus and Wonder Woman's step-brother, Hercules is the one who provides Shazam's grand superpower and is therefore, one of DC's most physically powerful characters for having a level of strength equivalent to that of the aforementioned hero (and Shazam was already able to injure Kryptonians without major difficulties). As an Olympian demigod, he has other standard characteristics for all members of the race; superhuman speed, agility, reflexes, senses, endurance, durability, healing factor and immortality. He still has some degree of shape change. Hercules is also an advanced level martial fighter. Though easily dominated by Hippolyta, the Queen noted and congratulated him on his excellent combat skills (though below the standard Amazon level). He is able to combine his martial techniques and tactics with his incredible strength, revealing himself as a complicated and dangerous opponent to anyone facing him. Other versions Quality Comics' Joe Hercules *A Golden Age superhero, Joe Hercules, had adventures in Quality Comics's Hit Comics from issue #1 (July 1940) through #21 (April 1942). Joe Hercules was an ordinary man from the \\"North Woods\\" imbued with superhuman strength who became a circus strongman and crimefighter, not a god.http://www.internationalhero.co.uk/q/quherc.htmhttp://ratmmjess.tripod.com/ga/goldh.htmlhttp://goldenageheroes.blogspot.com/2008/08/third- golden-age-hercules.html This character was purchased, along with Quality's other characters, by DC Comics. He makes a cameo appearance in the 1993 Elseworlds miniseries The Golden Age. Joe Hercules is first referred to in a canonical DC Universe story in Starman (vol. 2) #35 (October 1997). He is mentioned in a conversation between Ted Knight (formerly the Golden Age Starman) and Sentinel (Alan Scott, a.k.a. Green Lantern) and is said to be suffering from Alzheimer's disease.http://www.cosmicteams.com/quality/profiles/Hercules.html *During the Marvel/DC crossover JLA/Avengers, Wonder Woman believed the Marvel Comics' Hercules to be a villain, assuming that he had raped his dimension's Hippolyta; however, Marvel Comics' Hercules had simply had a consensual relationship with Marvel Comics' Hippolyta. Ironically, the Marvel Universe version of Hercules is a hero, while Hippolyta is a villainess. However, this presents some continuity problems as Diana and her mother had already accepted his forgiveness, and Wonder Woman had not yet reverted to any previous incarnations. It is possible she was using the incident to fuel her rage, but she was still threatening approaching Asgardian gods that she would harm a subdued Hercules at the end of the fight. It may also be possible that Wonder Woman (who, like most of the JLA, did not believe that good was championed sufficiently in the Marvel Universe) was too disgusted at the idea that this Hercules had never been punished for what he did to the Amazons to think straight. In other media *Hercules appeared alongside Captain Marvel's friend and ally Isis in the TV series The Freedom Force, which was part of Tarzan and the Super 7. This version of Hercules had earlier appeared in Space Sentinels. * In 1982, several of the characters from the Warlord series received action figures in a line called \\"Lost World of the Warlord\\" from Remco. Despite his not being related to the Warlord series, Hercules (from the Hercules Unbound era) was one of the figures in the line. *Joaquin Phoenix (credited as Leaf Phoenix) appears on the Superboy television series in the season one episode titled Little Hercules as Billy Hercules. His character is a boy genius that teams with Superboy after an attempt at impressing his crush (by implanting a love poem as a virus within the Navy's missile system) goes awry.

History  SIEDS was founded on June 29, 1939, at the initiative of Livio Livi and others. The first seat of the society was located in Florence. Initially named \\"Italian Society of Demography and Statistics\\", it originated in the Advisory Committee for the Population Study (), also founded by Livi. The first publications of the society were only the scientific meeting proceedings but, starting from January 1947, the society published its own scientific journal,the Italian Review of Demography and Statistics. On 18 April 1950 the society decided to expand its fields of interest also to economics and obtained its current name. In 1950 the society's journal was renamed accordingly to Rivista italiana di economia demografia e statistica. During the first meeting of the society, held at Istat (Rome, 28‚Äì29 May 1939), Livi underlined that at that time there were already 16 statistical societies in Europe as well as in North America, Argentina, Brazil, India, China, and Japan. Therefore, Italian academics thought that the time was arrived also for their own wide national society. During the scientific meeting held on December 28, 1940 the society already counted 122 ordinary members.

GaPO4 is isotypic with quartz, possessing very similar properties, but the silicon atoms are alternately substituted with gallium and phosphorus, thereby doubling the piezoelectric effect. GaPO4 has many advantages over quartz for technical applications, like a higher electromechanical coupling coefficient in resonators, due to this doubling. Contrary to quartz, GaPO4 is not found in nature. Therefore, a hydrothermal process must be used to synthesize the crystal. Modifications GaPO4 possesses, in contrast to quartz, no Œ±-Œ≤ phase transition, thus the low temperature structure (structure like Œ±-quartz) of GaPO4 is stable up to 970¬∞C, as are most of its other physical properties. Around 970¬∞C another phase transition occurs which changes the low quartz structure into another structure similar with cristobalite. Structure The specific structure of GaPO4 shows the arrangement of tetrahedrons consisting of GaO4 and PO4 that are slightly tilted. Because of the helical arrangement of these tetrahedrons, two modifications of GaPO4 exist with different optical rotation (left and right). Sources GaPO4 does not occur in nature; thus it must be grown synthetically. Presently, only one company in Austria produces these crystals commercially. History and technical importance Pressure sensors based on quartz have to be cooled with water for applications at higher temperatures (above 300¬∞C). Starting in 1994 it was possible to substitute these big sensors with miniaturized, non cooled ones, based on GaPO4. Further exceptional properties of GaPO4 for applications at high temperatures include its nearly temperature independent piezo effect and excellent electrical insulation up to 900¬∞C. For bulk resonator applications, this crystal exhibits temperature compensated cuts of up to 500¬∞C while having Q factors comparable with quartz. Due to these material properties, GaPO4 is very suitable for piezoelectric pressure sensors at high temperatures and for high temperature microbalance.

Kullen is one of the most prominent landmarks along the Swedish coastline, and with its 1000 Watt electric bulb in a huge lenshouse, also the most powerful lighthouse in Scandinavia, overlooking one of the world's most heavily traveled waters. The lighthouse is 15 meters tall and its focal plane is located 78.5 meters above sea level making it the highest located lighthouse in Sweden. Every 5 seconds, the Kullen Lighthouse flashes white for 0.3 seconds with 27 nautical miles reach.  History  The lens assembly at the Kullen lighthouse, the most powerful lighthouse in Scandinavia. Kullen is the oldest lighthouse location in Scandinavia founded 1561 by the Danish king Fredrik II This lighthouse was a \\"Parrot lighthouse\\" with an iron casket 20 feet above ground. 1563 there was a new stone tower with 12 candlelight as source for light but already 1585 it was replaced with a covered lantern and from 1624 coal was used for light. During the centuries wood, candlelights, coal, oil, kerosene and electricity have been used to send out a beam that reached 50K as a minimum. The present lighthouse is built in stone and brick and has three large 1 order Fresnel lenses in a lens house that rotates four times per minute, hence giving twelve flashes per minute. Based on Augustin-Jean Fresnel's design, the lens house was constructed by the French company Barbier & Barnard and delivered in the summer of 1900. It consists of three lenses of 2.58 m in diameter, weighs 6 metric tons and originally rotated on a base filled with 50 liters of mercury. The mercury was replaced in September 2016 with two bearings. The Kullen lighthouse was automated in 1979 and is remote-controlled by the Swedish Maritime Administration's check at Norrk√∂ping. The last keeper left in 1996.  Area setting  The Kullen Lighthouse is situated within the Kullaberg Nature Reserve, a cliff and forest habitat for a variety of rare species, criss- crossed by numerous hiking trails.

It was one of the most arterial transportation mode in erstwhile Travancore princely state. Most of the trade, commerce and freight traffic in Travancore used to happen through this canal. The canal used to pass through rice bowl of the state, Kuttanad, centre of Coir trade i.e. Alappuzha, centre of Cashew business, Kollam, Changanassery market, strategic Thevally, Kayamkulam, Varkala etc. and used to connect Thiruvithamkoor with Cochin State and Malabar.  History  The T S canal was commissioned in stages under the three erstwhile states of Travancore, Cochin and Madras between the 18th and 19th century. The portion between Channankara and Thiruvananthapuram was first done to effect through-traffic from Varkala to Thiruvananthapuram. Then, Paravur canal was constructed to link the backwaters of Paravur Lake and Edava Kayal. Quilon canal came next, connecting Paravur Lake and Ashtamudi Kayal. Thus, the waterway route in this region was completed by 1880 to have through movement of goods and passenger traffic between the southern parts of Travancore parts of the state.

It was invented by Maynard Ferguson and Larry Ramirez and remains an exceptionally rare, specialist instrument. They were occasionally produced by Holton. History Instruments equipped with both a slide and valves have been in existence since the early 20th century. One popular model was created by C.G. Conn. Jazz trumpet player Maynard Ferguson and Holton (now a division of C.G. Conn) worked together to develop Ferguson's first trumpet, Model ST302. The designer of that trumpet, Larry Ramirez, spoke to Ferguson about a valve/slide trombone that he had designed some 12 years earlier, and this eventually led to Ramirez designing a new valve/slide trombone for Ferguson, called the Superbone, in October 1974.Email correspondence with Larry Ramirez After touring with the Superbone, Ferguson spoke to Ramirez about making a trumpet with the same valve/slide capabilities. In order to preserve the length of tubing required to make a B trumpet, the hand slide could only be made with four positions instead of the standard seven on a trombone. In addition, the bell was bent up approximately 20 degrees so that the hand slide could be extended and clear the bell. This instrument was dubbed the ‚ÄúFirebird‚Äù, and went into production on or around May 28, 1983. The Firebird is Model ST303. By 2000, Ramirez came up with a design for a full seven-position Firebird trumpet. The hand slide was constructed as a telescoping assembly, or a slide within a slide that could be extended to twice its length. One prototype was made for Ferguson and years later a second one was made after the first one was damaged. These two remain the only seven-position Firebird trumpets in existence. Technique The Firebird may be played strictly as a valve trumpet, or using the valves and slide in conjunction. With only the first four slide positions available, some lower notes (low F, G, A, C, D, E, and the second A) require the use of valves. Higher As can be achieved using normally out-of-tune harmonics, since the slide allows for microtuning adjustments. The horn may be gripped with either the left hand or the right hand, and the valves may also be operated by either hand, which is facilitated by the presence of two pinky rings on the top of the horn. Similarly, the slide may be operated by either hand, giving the player the option to finger the valves with the right hand and operate the slide with the left, or vice versa. Other than the slide, the Firebird's playing technique is no different from standard trumpet technique. Notable players Popular artists who have used the Firebird on recordings and live performances include: * Axel D√∂rner * Don Ellis * Maynard Ferguson * Leonel Kaplan * Lee Morgan * James Morrison  References  External links * Firebird page (archived) on trumpetstuff.com * Firebird page on konakkol.com Category:Brass instruments Category:B-flat instruments Category:Trumpets ","title":"Firebird (trumpet)"},{"id":"6681679","text":"Donald Edward Farrell (born 6 June 1954) is an Australian politician and a former trade union leader. He was a Labor member of the Australian Senate from 2008 to 2014, representing the state of South Australia and re-elected at the 2016 double dissolution election. Appointed the Parliamentary Secretary for Sustainability and Urban Water on 14 September 2010, Farrell was promoted into the outer ministry on 25 March 2013 as the Minister for Science and Research and the Minister Assisting on Tourism, in the Second Gillard Ministry. On 1 July 2013 Farrell was appointed the Minister for Sport as well as remaining Minister Assisting on Tourism in the Second Rudd Ministry. Farrell failed in his attempt to be re-elected to the Senate at the 2013 federal election, and his first term concluded on 30 June 2014.Labor \\"Godfather\\" hints at political return. ABC News Online, 2 October 2013. Retrieved 2 October 2013 Political career Before entering the Senate, Farrell was the South Australian Secretary and the National President of the Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees Association (SDA) union and a leader of Labor Unity in South Australia. Farrell first ran for parliament at the 1988 Adelaide by-election but was unsuccessful. In June 2007, Farrell won preselection for the first position on Labor's Senate ticket in the 2007 election and he was subsequently the first elected senator for South Australia at the general election. Following the 2010 federal election, he was appointed Parliamentary Secretary for Sustainability and Urban Water. On 25 March 2013, Farrell was promoted into the Outer Ministry as the Minister for Science and Research and the Minister Assisting on Tourism. On 1 July 2013 as part of the Second Rudd Ministry, Farrell was appointed the Minister for Sport as well as remaining Minister Assisting on Tourism. In 2011 Farrell was listed as number six on the top ten political fixers as identified by The Power Index website. Where the article states that Labor's former deputy leader, Ralph Clarke commented: > \\"He controls the pre-selection directly or indirectly of every MP in South > Australia. If you want to get on, you get on with Don.\\" In 2012, he was again selected as the first candidate on Labor's Senate ticket in the 2013 federal election, causing some controversy as he defeated Penny Wong for the leading Senate position. At the time, Wong was a senior minister in the Second Gillard Ministry and a member of the Australian Cabinet. Anthony Albanese accused union powerbrokers of not listening to the electorate and instead focusing on its own ructions. He labelled the move as: > \\"...gross self-indulgent rubbish.... [taken by] ....those who should care > more about the party and less about themselves.\\" He stated that he would demand that Labor's national executive overturn the decision and promote Senator Wong to the number one spot. On 30 October 2012, Farrell stepped aside to give Wong the number one spot on Labor's senate ticket for the 2013 election. He was quoted as saying: > \\"I was concerned that the issue was damaging the Labor Party. ..... I was > prepared to do a swap with Penny. This is a case whereby modern Labor can't > be seen to be concentrating on our internals at the expense of what is going > on out there in the electorate and what is expected.\\" Wong later expressed favourable sentiments about Farrell after his decision to stand aside: > \\"Throughout his career, Don has always put the Labor Party first and he has > demonstrated that principle again today.\\" Farrell was subsequently defeated at the 2013 federal election and his term in the Senate ended on 30 June 2014. In January 2014 it was announced that Michael O'Brien offered Farrell his state seat of Napier, so that Farrell could contest the 2014 South Australian election, representing Labor. Premier Jay Weatherill threatened to resign if Farrell was successfully preselected. A few hours later, Farrell withdrew his nomination. In 2016 Farrell was endorsed as a Labor candidate for the Senate in South Australia in the 2016 federal election, and was subsequently re-elected. Farrell opposes same-sex marriage and supports the view of \\"traditional marriage as being between a man and a woman\\". He has publicly stated that he will vote against marriage equality in the parliament regardless of the results of the Australian Marriage Law Postal Survey. However from 2019 he will follow the Labor Policy Platform from that time which will not permit a conscience vote on the issue.

It was written for British clarinet player Frederick Thurston and was the composer's last major chamber work. History The precise circumstances under which the sonata was composed are not known, but it is known that it is related to the rejection of the composer's 1942 oboe sonata by its intended dedicatee, L√©on Goossens. Fabian Huss, writing on the relationship between the two compositions, speculates that the clarinet sonata grew out of the process of revising the oboe sonata. He noted that in 1947 Howells wrote in a review of Ralph Vaughan Williams Oboe Concerto that he considered the oboe best suited for short musical spans, much shorter than the ones he had included in the oboe sonata. Both Huss and the anonymous writer of the liner notes to the Hyperion recording of the oboe sonata, point to similarities in the rhythmical procedures and musical structure between the two compositions to argue that the clarinet sonata represents the result of an attempt by the composer to simplify and clarify the structural concepts he had explored in the oboe sonata combined with a change of instrument to one he felt better suited to them. Aileen Razey in their thesis comments that despite advocacy from Frederick Thurston, Boosey & Hawkes did not publish the sonata, in a transcription for the B‚ô≠ clarinet, until 1956. Structure The two movements have the main tempo indications: #Con moto, dolce e con tenerezza #Allegro, ritmico, con brio The music is typical of Howells's improvised sound world and is technically challenging, with sweeping arpeggiated figurations.

He specialized in a variety of still lifes. Career Born in Naples, he likely apprenticed with his family, including his father Giacomo Recco and uncle . Later, he perfected his technique with Paolo Porpora, who had been one of his father's students. During a stay in Lombardy, from 1644 to 1654 with his uncle, he was influenced by the works of Evaristo Baschenis. As his fame spread, he was invited to come to Spain by King Charles II. His assemblies of victuals, both vegetable and animal, were very popular there. His style is often compared to that of Giovan Battista Ruoppolo, who was also a student of Porpora. Early in his career, he went from painting flowers to more varied assemblies and was among the first Italian painters to do so. Recco may have died at Alicante, Spain, before reaching Madrid, although contemporary sources indicate that he lived there for seven years and became a Knight in the Order of Calatrava. His children Nicolo and Elena also became painters. In 1989, the art historian, Federico Zeri, raised questions concerning his father's true identity.

March 1929 Gordon England was a British coachbuilding company based in Putney, South West London and later in the Palace of Industry, Wembley, North London with a showroom at 28 South Molton Street, Mayfair, London W1. Gordon England E. C. Gordon England, after beginning an engineering apprenticeship with Great Northern Railway in Doncaster, changed to aviation and went on to pilot and design both gliders and powered aircraft and was works manager at Bristol Aeroplane Company during World War I. After that war he raced cars and also developed and patented lightweight car bodies. Lightweight bodies for cars Palace of Industry, Wembley before demolition After the war his interest turned to motor racing and in 1922 he obtained a chassis version of the new Austin 7 which he tuned and entered successfully at several events. This led him to make and sell a series of cars to the public based on his racers. He believed that car performance was being held back by the heavy coachwork being fitted to many models and set about designing bodies largely of plywood covered with fabric and fixed to the chassis with three rubber mountings. To make these George England (Motor Bodies) Ltd was incorporated in 1925. =Construction= Gordon England took four years to develop his own construction technique using a solid plywood shell without Weymann's skeletal frame. His seats, and floorboards were mounted directly onto the chassis as was the scuttle and instrument panel. The body was given a hollow box-girder of plywood around its base and attached to the frame at three points. This way the body on its three separate mounting points was able to maintain its shape even over rough roads.R J Wyatt, The Austin 1905‚Äî1952, David & Charles, Newton Abbott, 1981. =Austin= The first model to be sold was the Brooklands Super-sports Austin 7 and although his racing version had been fabric covered the production version was aluminium panelled. Each one was supplied with a certificate stating that it would attain 80 mph (130 km/h). The \\"Cup\\" model followed in 1925 and then a fabric saloon which came out before the official factory version. In 1927 almost 20,000 bodies were supplied for the Austin 7. Work extended beyond Austin and in 1925 a Rolls-Royce was fitted followed by work on Bentleys, MG, Morris, Standard and Wolseley. The Putney premises were outgrown and in 1927 the company moved to Wembley and exhibited at the London Olympia Motor Show with an Invicta on the stand. The company was reformed as Gordon England (1929) Ltd and claimed to be making 35 bodies a day. However, the fabric body started to lose out to all-metal types, the company's fortunes declined and in 1930 it closed.

According to family records, he was an ethnic German with roots in Trieste Austro-Hungary (now in Italy). German was his first language; that is, the German commonly spoken in Trieste in the 19th century. Most of his books were written in German. Recruited by Em√≠lio Goeldi, Ducke began his work in Amaz√¥nia as an entomologist for the Museu Paraense Em√≠lio Goeldi, but due to the influence of botanists Jacques H√ºber and Paul Le Cointe, he switched to botany. He traveled throughout Amaz√¥nia to study the complicated tree system of the rainforest. He published 180 articles and monographs, primarily on the Leguminosae, and he described 900 species and 50 new genera. In 1918, while continuing his work for the Paraense Museum, he collaborated with the Rio de Janeiro Botanical Garden and the Instituto Agron√¥mico do Norte. In the first half of the 20th century, he became one of the most respected authorities on the Amazonian flora. In 1954, his concerns about the future of the Amazonian forest led him to make a suggestion to the National Institute of Amazonian Research (INPA) for the creation of a nature reserve. He died in Fortaleza in 1959 before witnessing the fulfillment of his dream: In 1963, the Reserva Florestal Adolpho Ducke was established and named in his honour. Also named in his honour is a botanical garden east of Manaus, and the phytochemical research laboratory at the museum in Bel√©m. Ducke's entomological material is currently located at the Museu Paraense Em√≠lio Goeldi in Bel√©m, the Natural History Museum of Bern, the Museu de Zoologia of the University of S√£o Paulo, and The Natural History Museum, in London. Ducke's general classification of the Neotropical social wasps is still used. Additionally, Ducke is known for his findings on the species Melipona subnitida, a species which he discovered and did significant field research on.  Entomological publications  * Ducke, A. (1897).

Ronde Lutherse Kerk (\\"Round Lutheran Church\\"). The Munttoren seen from the Singel, postcard from 1900. The Singel Bridge at the Paleisstraat in Amsterdam, painting by Breitner, c. 1897. A bird's eye view of Amsterdam circa 1544, encircled by the Singel (right side), woodcut by Cornelis Anthonisz. The Singel is one of the canals of Amsterdam. The Singel encircled Amsterdam in the Middle Ages, serving as a moat around the city until 1585, when Amsterdam expanded beyond the Singel. The canal runs from the IJ bay, near the Central Station, to the Muntplein square, where it meets the Amstel river. It is now the inner-most canal in Amsterdam's semicircular ring of canals. The canal should not be confused with the Singelgracht, which became the outer limit of the city during the Dutch Golden Age in the 17th Century. Other Dutch towns also have ring-shaped canals named Singel. The name is related to the Dutch word omsingelen, \\"to surround\\", and comes ultimately from Latin cingulum, meaning \\"belt\\". Locations along the Singel Amsterdam's famous flower market, Bloemenmarkt, is located along the Singel between Koningsplein and Muntplein squares. The market stalls are actually boats floating in the canal. Part of the Singel has developed into a red-light district, with prostitutes offering their services from behind red-lit windows. The area, known as the Singelgebied, is located near Lijnbaanssteeg and Oude Nieuwstraat. Yab Yum, one of Amsterdam's most exclusive brothels until closed by the local authority in January 2008, was located at Singel 295. The Singel is lined by many beautiful, richly decorated canal houses built during the Dutch Golden Age. Notable buildings along the canal include: * A house said to be the narrowest in the world -- only one meter wide (admittedly, this is the back of the house; the front is quite a bit wider), at Singel 7. * De Dolphijn, at Singel 140‚Äì142, a monumental canalside house built in ca. 1600, once inhabited by Frans Banning Cocq, the central figure in Rembrandt's painting The Night Watch. * The Oude Lutherse Kerk (\\"Old Lutheran Church\\"), at Singel 411, built in 1632‚Äì1633. * The Ronde Lutherse Kerk (\\"Round Lutheran Church\\"), also known as Koepelkerk or Nieuwe Lutherse Kerk, built in 1668‚Äì1671. * The library of the University of Amsterdam, at Singel 425. * The Kalvertoren shopping center, between Koningsplein and Muntplein squares. * The Munttoren tower, originally part of a gate in the Medieval city walls, on Muntplein square, where the Singel meets the Amstel River. The Haringpakkerstoren tower was part of Amsterdam's Medieval city defenses. The tower stood at the beginning of the Singel, near the IJ. It was demolished in 1829. The municipal government is currently considering a plan to rebuild the tower and adjacent houses. However, this plan remains highly controversial; opponents consider it in poor taste and a waste of money. The Torensluis, built in 1648, is an arched and exceptionally wide bridge across the Singel. Now covered by cosy caf√© terraces and a bust of Dutch writer Multatuli, the Torensluis is the oldest remaining bridge in Amsterdam, and also the widest bridge in Amsterdam (42 meters). The Jan Roodepoortstoren tower stood on one end of the bridge but was torn down in 1829. However, the tower's foundations remain part of the bridge. The entrance and barred windows of the tower's dungeon are still visible. The bridge, also known as Brug 9, crosses the Singel near Dam square, at Oude Leliestraat. Other names Up until the 15th century, the Singel was known as the Stedegracht (\\"City Canal\\"). In the 17th century the canal was known for some time as Koningsgracht (\\"King's Canal\\"), in honor of King Henry IV of France, who was an important ally of the Dutch Republic during the early part of the 17th century. Part of the canal, stretching from Spui square to Lijnbaanssteeg / Blauwburgwal, was also known at one time as Londense Kaai (\\"London Quay\\") or Engelse Kaai (\\"English Quay\\") because many ships sailing between Amsterdam and London moored there.

Rodolfo Cerr√≥n Palomino (born February 10, 1940 in Huancayo, Peru) is a Peruvian linguist who has crucially contributed to the investigation and development of the Quechuan languages. He has also made outstanding contributions to the study of the Aymara, Mochica and Chipaya languages.  Biography  He pursued his first degree at the National University of San Marcos in Lima. After graduating, he obtained his master's degree at Cornell University and his Ph.D. degree at the University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign. He started his studies by researching the Quechuan variety spoken in his homeland: the Mantaro Valley region. Engaged by the Peruvian Ministry of Education, he wrote the first grammar and dictionary of Wanka Quechua, both published in 1976. He has fought strongly for preservation and development of Quechua in all of its varieties.

History The School was founded in 1885 by Gerard Rogers at Canford Cliffs just outside Bournemouth. Rogers was only 27; pupil numbers grew rapidly and many scholarships were won. He drowned around 1920 while swimming off the local beach and was succeeded as head by his deputy, Sydney Phillips, who ran the school until his death in 1930. He in turn was succeeded by the Reverend Thomas Flynn. After the difficult years of early 1930s the school prospered but then war came, France fell and all the South Coast was considered a likely German invasion area. Numbers fell rapidly and the school was forced to evacuate to East Devon for the duration. It never returned to Bournemouth as the premises there were considered too small and cramped, so a large building was bought at Little Horwood in North Bucks when the war ended. However, 14 years later The Old Ride was forced to move again when a plan was drawn up by British Rail to extend the nearby station into a huge marshalling yard which would have meant acquiring virtually all the school grounds. Subsequent to the school's move this plan was scrapped. The school therefore finally settled at Bradford on Avon in Wiltshire where it amalgamated with a similar prep school, Kingwell Court, whose headmaster had just left. This building, originally Frankleigh House, was early Victorian but with some surviving sections believed to be Tudor. The merged schools retained the name of The Old Ride but for a while kept their separate uniforms: red caps for The Old Ride and purple for Kingwell Court. The Rev. Thomas Flynn died in 1962 and was succeeded as headmaster by his son, Mark Flynn. Until then the school had had only three headmasters in 77 years. After a further 19 years the headship was taken on by Jeremy Willder in May 1981. He was a graduate of Christ Church, Oxford whereas all four previous heads had been graduates of Corpus Christi College. Girls were first admitted to the school in 1982. The tradition of The Old Ride was for children to be awarded 'plus and minus' points for good or bad work or behaviour. Those receiving one hundred pluses in a term would go on the Plus Outing with the headmaster and his wife. The four houses, for many years, were called Nations: Britons, Spartans, Trojans and Vikings. Children were required to carry a comb and handkerchief with them at all times. The school closed in 1990 when attendance figures dropped dramatically, following adverse inspection reports. In 2002, a former science teacher, Peter Hamilton-Leggett, was charged with having molested several students in the 1970s and 1980s. He was given a gaol sentence in 2003. Later uses A Rudolf Steiner school, The Orchard School, occupied part of The Old Ride's premises until it was forced to relocate to Holt due to financial difficulties. The buildings were left in disrepair until a group of families bought them in 1995, and have since been divided into ten individually owned apartments.

When her husband died, she worked as a maid to earn money to support herself and her son. Then one day she said she had a dream which inspired her to teach herself to paint and become a painter, which she did. She was influenced by works of artists from the CoBrA painting movement.

He represented Great Britain in two consecutive Summer Olympics, the FINA world championships and European championships, as well as England in the Commonwealth Games. Profile Jameson was born in Crosby, Merseyside. His swimming career was initially centred on individual medley and backstroke events, but after studying at Arizona State University, he decided to specialise in the 100-metre butterfly and 100-metre freestyle events. Initially he represented England in the backstroke events, at the 1982 Commonwealth Games in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. He had also won the 1982 ASA National Championship title in the 200 metres backstroke. A founder member of Kelly College Swim Squad in Tavistock (along with Sharron Davies) Jameson represented Great Britain at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, where he finished 5th place in the 100-metre butterfly. He then won silver in the 100-metre butterfly at the 1985 European Championships (Sofia), behind the German star swimmer Michael Gross. Jameson took bronze in the 100-metre butterfly at the 1986 World Championships (Madrid), and then went on to take gold when representing England in the same event at the Edinburgh Commonwealth Games later that year. In addition to the gold he won a silver and bronze in the relay events and a bronze in the 100 metres freestyle. He went on to win the 1986 and 1988 ASA National Championship 100 metres butterfly titles, the 1988 ASA National Championship 100 metres freestyle title and the 200 metres backstroke title in 1982. He won gold at the 1987 European Championships (Strasbourg) in the 100-metre butterfly, and was also part of the team which took silver in the 4√ó100-metre medley relay and going into the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, South Korea, he was one of the pre-race favourites to win, having been undefeated for over two years in the 100-metre butterfly. He qualified fastest into the final, where he took bronze in a time of 53.30 seconds, breaking both the British and Commonwealth records in the process. Personal life Jameson retired from competitive swimming in 1989. He commentates on swimming for the BBC with fellow Olympian Adrian Moorhouse. His older sister Helen was also a competitive swimmer, and represented Britain at the 1980 Olympic Games in Moscow and won a silver medal in the 4√ó100-metre medley relay.

Massacre  By 1942, the city of Bar became a home of many Serbians and other refugees who were forced to flee from Kosovo and to escape the violence done by Albanian units. Many of these joined the Partisan forces and participated in their activities at Bar. The victims were Albanian recruits from Kosovo, who had been pressed by the Yugoslav Partisans into service. These men were then assembled in Prizren and marched on foot in three columns to Bar where they were supposed to receive short training and then sent off to the front. The march took the rugged mountain ranges of Kosovo and Montenegro to reach its destination. Upon arrival locals reported that these men, who had marched a considerable distance, were \\"exhausted\\" and \\"distressed\\". The column of men which stretched a few kilometres were then gathered on the Barkso Polje. At one point, in Polje, one of the Albanians from the column attacked and killed one of the Yugoslav officers, Bo≈æa Dabanoviƒáa. Very soon after that somebody from the column threw a smuggled bomb at the commander of the brigade. This created a panic among the Partisans. The guards watching over the recruits then fired into the crowd killing many and prompting the survivors to flee into the surrounding mountains. In another case, several hundred Albanians were herded into a tunnel, near Bar, which was subsequently sealed off so that all of those trapped within the tunnel were asphyxiated. Yugoslav sources put the number of victims at 400 while Albanian sources put the figure at 2,000 killed in Bar alone. According to Croatian historian Ljubica ≈†tefan, the Partisans killed 1,600 Albanians in Bar on 1 April after an incident at a fountain. There are also accounts claiming that the victims included young boys. Other sources cited that the killing started en route for no apparent reason and this was supported by the testimony of Zoi Themeli in his 1949 trial. Themeli was a collaborator who worked as an important official of the Sigurimi, the Albanian secret police. After the massacre, the site was immediately covered in concrete by the Yugoslav communist regime and built an airport on top of the mass grave.

A child life degree may be attained either at a bachelor's or masters degree level. Child life may be a major, minor, or area of concentration within a related field of study.Child Life Council. (2002). Official Documents of the Child Life Council. Rockville, MD; Child Life Council.  The child life profession  Child life specialists primarily work in hospital settings. In pediatric hospitals, it is common to find an entire child life department. Child life programs are devoted to minimizing anxiety and stress experienced by pediatric patients and their families. In addition, they may help advise or facilitate sick adults in explaining to children an acute and/or chronic illness, or (impending) death, in an age-appropriate way. They facilitate therapeutic interventions including playroom sessions, educational preparation for procedures, diagnosis education and grief support. They also offer distraction to ease anxiety during invasive procedures.  Academic requirements  Child life academic programs have a theoretical basis of study in child development, family systems, play, stress/coping, separation, and loss with supplemental areas of study in human/lifespan development, learning, education, organizational systems and group dynamics. Child life programs also have applied areas of study, including: therapeutic play; family-centered care; pain management (non-pharmacological); guided imagery/relaxation techniques; comfort positioning; preparation; expressive interventions; ethics; bereavement support; impact of illness, injury and health care on patients and families; supervision/program administration; pediatric diagnoses; scope of practice; and charting/documentation. In order to qualify for the Certified Child Life Specialist (CCLS) credential, which is administered by the Child Life Council, students must complete a minimum of 10 college level courses in child life, human development, education, psychology, or a related field of study. Beginning with the fall 2013 exam administration, the Child Life Council will require that applicants for the exam have completed an academic course taught by a Certified Child Life Specialist.Curriculum Recommendations for Academic Programs from www.childlife.org, retrieved April 1, 2012  Internship requirements  Child life academic programs often have an internship or fieldwork program as part of their degree requirements. The Child Life Council requires that a minimum of 480 hours of fieldwork under the supervision of a Certified Child Life Specialist be completed in order for a candidate to be eligible to take the Child Life Certification Examination and attain the Certified Child Life Specialist (CCLS) credential.‚ÄúCertification Manual and Application\\" , from www.childlife.org, retrieved March 15, 2012 The primary goal of a clinical internship is to facilitate students‚Äô application of theory into practice, thus preparing students for employment as child life professionals. Child life internships are typically not paid, and effective beginning in 2012, the Child Life Council will cease accepting paid work experience in lieu of a 480 internship as a prerequisite for the certification exam.  Practicum  Prior to completing a child life internship, students may choose (or academic programs may require students to participate in) a practicum experience in which a child life student is familiarized with the child life profession in general.  Fellowship  Following an internship, child life students may choose to continue their educational experience with a child life fellowship. A fellowship often offers some form of compensation, but is still supervised directly by an experienced child life specialist for the purpose of further developing the fellow's child life skills.

The band developed a large and enthusiastic following in their hometown. Unfortunately, their growing popularity began to attract a great deal of crowd trouble.Larkin, C. (1992) Indie & New Wave Music, Guinness Publishing, Enfield, p. 70; The band were also frequent visitors to London and became one of the pioneering punk bands that played live in the first few months of the Roxy Club. They supported The Stranglers in January 1977 and then headlined twice the following month. The Cortinas headlined the Roxy again in March and April, supported by The Models on both occasions.Thompson, D.

Swarland's 'village rival' is Felton. Swarland is the highest settlement between London and Edinburgh.  History  The manor of Swarland was owned from ancient times by the de Haslerigg family of Swarland Old Hall until the 18th century. In 1741 the estate was purchased by Richard Grieve of Swansford. In 1765 his son Davison Richard Grieve commissioned architect John Carr to build a new park and mansion, Swarland Hall. The new house was later the home of Alexander Davison, a friend of Horatio Nelson, who in 1807 erected the Nelson Memorial on the park. Many of the modern local street names are linked with Nelson, including Nelson Drive, Admiral Close and Lady Hamilton Drive. The new Hall was demolished in the early 1930s and in 1936 a new village of 77 cottages was built on the estate by the Fountains Abbey Settlers Trust.  Present day  The village has a sporting culture; with various amenities at hand such as: 3 tennis courts, a 5-a-side court, football field, equestrian centre and an astroturf bowling green. It also hosts Percy Wood Country Retreat and Golf Course that is part of the old Percy Wood area and a tourist attraction.  Governance  Swarland is in the parliamentary constituency of Berwick-upon-Tweed.  Landmarks  Swarland Old Hall is a small 17th-century country house and is a Grade II* listed building. The house which has a four-bay south front and two storeys with attics was built in the late 17th century and incorporates fabric of earlier properties. The east front is notable for its castellated full height screen wall with three blind Gothic arches. Overgrass Tower A railed monument nearby (Grade II listed) records the death of William Haslerigg in 1681. His brother and heir was High Sheriff of Northumberland in 1698. A little over a mile to the west of the village, by the Swarland Burn, are the ruins of Overgrass Tower, a medieval tower house dating from the fourteenth or fifteenth century.  Transport  = The A1 junction = The junction with the A1 has had numerous crashes, some fatal, so people now often travel through Newton on the Moor when travelling north. All local 'bus services to and from Swarland were cancelled in 2014. The nearest 'bus stop is at the bottom of Lemingtom Lane, a good mile walk from the bottom of Park Road. However, the crossing/junction has been improved in recent times so that anyone exiting from the village area and wishing to travel south onto the A1 will now find a 'refuge area' so you can cross the fast dual carriageway in two distinct stages.  Education  Swarland First School is a small school in the village, with approximately 60 students between the ages of 3 and 9. The children usually go on to either an Alnwick or Rothbury middle school. Quite a number of pupils from the first settlers have left the village to become the parents of Doctors, nurses and police officers of senior rank. One boy was employed at Buckingham Palace as a footman and married the Queen Mother and Princess Margaret's travelling maid. A gift of daffodils was given to the school by this man's brother and planted around the school and on the verges in 2009. In memory of all those first pupils when the school first opened.  Sports and Recreation  The first recorded leek show in North East England was held in Swarland in 1846. An annual pantomime is performed by the local drama group. Traditionally performed during December, over the last few years, it has been performed during February. Some of the recent performances have included takes on Star Trek, Sleeping Beauty and Western(genre). There is a Working Men's Club in the village. Every year, the working men's club holds a Quoits competition, which is affectionately claimed by locals to be the 'Quoits World Championships'.

It is being designed and constructed by the Parsons Corporation for treatment of nuclear salt waste and is expected to become operational in 2019. Background The Savannah River Site (SRS) presently contains legacy nuclear waste from the production of nuclear materials between 1951 and 2002. The nuclear waste is stored in large (typically nominal capacity) underground double walled storage tanks located in F-Area and H-Area tank farms. Upon completion, the Salt Waste Processing Facility (SWPF) will be the cornerstone of the Savannah River Site (SRS) salt processing strategy. It is designed to be capable of processing of salt solution per year. The waste currently in storage at SRS presently includes approximately of salt solution that must be processed, of which are projected to be processed through SWPF. SWPF will use specific processes that have been developed at Oak Ridge National Laboratory and Argonne National Laboratory using annular centrifugal contactors and that will be the state-of- the-art methods to target the removal of cesium-137, strontium-90, and actinides from SRS salt wastes. SWPF will remove approximately 99.998% of the cesium-137/barium-137 (metastable) activity while also removing strontium and actinides (Ref 1). Planned Deployment of SWPF Treatment Facility About of salt waste are currently stored in underground waste storage tanks at SRS. This waste, along with future salt waste forecast to be sent to the tank farms, will be processed through DDA, ARP/MCU, and the SWPF. DOE estimated in preparing the Section 3116 Determination that an additional 41.3 Mgal of unconcentrated salt waste would have been received by the Tank Farms between December 1, 2004, and the completion of salt waste processing. After both liquid removal by processing through the Tank Farm evaporator systems and later additions of liquid for saltcake dissolution and chemistry adjustments required for processing, approximately 84 Mgal (5.9 Mgal existing salt waste through the DDA process, 1.0 Mgal future salt waste through the DDA process, 2.1 Mgal existing and future salt waste through ARP/MCU, 69.1 Mgal existing salt waste through SWPF, and 5.9 Mgal future salt waste through SWPF) of salt solution will be processed by Interim Salt Processing and High Capacity Salt Processing resulting in approximately 168 Mgal of grout output from the Saltstone Production Facility to be disposed of in the Saltstone Disposal Facility. (DOE Amended Decision) Planned Start Date Delayed The start date for SWPF operations has been delayed to allow for modification of the SWPF preliminary design to incorporate a higher degree of performance category (PC)in the confinement barriers necessary for worker protection during natural phenomena hazard events. The Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board initially identified concerns related to the PC designations of the SWPF in August, 2004. DOE agreed in November, 2005, to modify the SWPF design after extensive analysis and review, resulting in an approximate two-year delay in the planned startup of SWPF. DOE anticipates that it will continue to explore possible ways to improve the schedule for design and construction of the SWPF. It remains DOE's goal to complete processing of salt waste through the SWPF by 2019 although this date may need to be modified in the future. Despite this projected delay, DOE will not increase the quantity of waste (total curies) to be disposed of in the Saltstone Disposal Facility, nor increase the quantities (curies) processed with interim processes or SWPF from those described here and in the Draft Section 3116 Determination for Salt Waste Disposal at the Savannah River Site and the Section 3116 Determination for Salt Waste Disposal at the Savannah River Site. Therefore, the date change does not affect the analyses in the Section 3116 Determination for Salt Waste Disposal at the Savannah River Site, its supporting documents, or the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) consultation. The modified schedule is reflected in the Section 3116 Determination for Salt Waste Disposal at the Savannah River. However, the technical and programmatic documents that are referenced by the Section 3116 Determination for Salt Waste Disposal at the Savannah River Site have not been updated to reflect this new date because the schedule change did not occur until after those documents were completed.

He was a student at the National University of San Marcos, from which he graduated in the early 1960s, and then traveled to France, where he continued his doctorate at the University of Paris. There he obtained a doctorate in 1965, under the direction of the linguist Andr√© Martinet, with his thesis Le puquina, la troisi√®me langue g√©n√©rale du P√©rou. Alfredo Torero came to prominence thanks to his article \\"The Dialects of Quechua\\" in 1964 and ranks among the founders of Andean linguistics. Much of his work is characterised by bringing into his linguistic investigations also cultural aspects of the Andean peoples. Besides Quechua and Aymara, he researched extinct languages such as Mochica and Puquina. The present classification of the Quechua language family is based fundamentally on his analysis and that of Gary Parker, who, independently, came to similar conclusions. He found that Quechua clearly did not originate, as is still often believed, in the region of the Inca capital Cuzco, but almost certainly somewhere considerably further north in Central Peru. Torero's proposed precise homeland for Quechua was the central coast of Peru in the Lima Region, but that remains both unproven and challenged by other linguists.

History Cabo da Roca, the westernmost point of Europe. Convent of the Capuchos. Even before there was a \\"Portugal\\", the region of Colares was a place of human movement and settlement.

AVG. PR. PR. PROVINCIAE LUSITANAE. It was conquered and held by Sigurd I of Norway for a few months in 1108 in the Norwegian Crusade. After a period of Moorish occupation, forces loyal to Afonso Henriques conquered the region, as a sequence of their victory in Sintra, around 1147 The region remained in the hands of the Crown until 1385, when it was donated by John I to the constable Nuno √Ålvares Pereira to compensate the mercenary for his support against Castile. These lands returned to the crown following the death of Infanta Beatriz, mother of Manuel I. The historical village of Colares, which was important in the nation's pre- history, obtained a foral early after its creation. The parish of Nossa Senhora da Assun√ß√£o was a bishopric rectory in the old comarca of Torres Vedras, and Colares was the seat of its own municipality, attributed to King Afonso III, in May 1255. A new foral was issued on 10 November 1516 by Manuel I. In 1801, the municipality of Colares included 1930 inhabitants, and by 1849, it already had 3341 inhabitants. During administrative reforms, on 24 October 1855, the municipality of Colares was extinguished and the territory integrated into the municipality of Sintra, as a civil parish. Grapevines are grown directly upon the sand in the Colares DOC, which covers 50 acres of remaining vineyards. In 1940s, vineyards covered 2,500 acres. Between 1934 and 1994, only the local co-op could use the Colares appellation. Red wines, which make up 75% of platings, are grown from ramisco grape and are aged over ten years before being marketed. White wines, grown from a local variant of malvasia, are not aged as long. Because phylloxera aphids cannot live on sand, Colares vineyards are some of the only European vines that are not grafted upon American rootstocks.

This changed after a New York City real estate developer purchased several abandoned farms and part of the dune field in the area during the 1980s and proposed a major golf course and exclusive resort on the property, creating a stir in publicity and causing an outcry among Islanders who feared loss of access to the area, and by environmentalists, who feared irreparable damage to the ecosystem. Islanders and tourists began to explore Greenwich's dune fields in increasing numbers and the pedestrian and frequently, illegal motorized vehicle use, was causing damage to the dunes. The provincial government held many public meetings which resulted in the government acquiring the land as part of a real estate swap with the American developer. Local Member of Parliament Lawrence MacAulay was elected to the riding of Cardigan in 1988 and became a Cabinet minister in the government of Prime Minister Jean Chr√©tien in 1993. MacAulay lobbied for Parks Canada and the provincial government to come to an agreement that would see the Greenwich property added to Prince Edward Island National Park. The national park was officially expanded in 1998 when 6 square kilometres of the Greenwich Peninsula were transferred from the provincial government to Parks Canada. Parks Canada has implemented a development plan which has controlled access to the dune field and prevented pedestrians and motorized vehicles from trespassing on sensitive areas. A visitor centre was constructed and a new beach complex was built at the eastern end of the property.

Merrie Melodies animated short directed by Robert McKimson and written by Tedd Pierce. The cartoon was released on November 15, 1952, and stars Bugs Bunny. The cartoon was animated by Charles McKimson, Herman Cohen, Rod Scribner, Phil DeLara and Keith Darling. The music was scored by Carl Stalling while the layouts and backgrounds were done by Robert Givens and Richard H. Thomas, respectively. Mel Blanc performs the voice of Bugs Bunny and Shorty Rabbit, while Stan Freberg voiced Bugs' new enemy Pete Puma, doing an imitation of the character Frank Fontaine introduced on The Jack Benny Show named John L. C. Silvoney, and later performed on The Jackie Gleason Show as Crazy Guggenheim. The title is a play on \\"rabbit skin\\", but is also a literal term in that Bugs is caring for a \\"kin\\", here, another rabbit. Blanc used a slightly higher register of Sylvester the Cat for the voice of Shorty, before it was sped up. Plot A rabbit named Shorty with a fast high pitched voice is running from a cougar named Pete Puma, until he stumbles down Bugs Bunny's rabbit hole. Shorty tells Bugs his problem (\\"My heart pounded, my legs trembled, I was frozen with fear\\"), and Bugs agrees to help him out. Bugs then proceeds to play various tricks on Pete who is now outside of Bugs' hole feeling around inside for the little rabbit. Bugs leaves a fake rabbit dynamite decoy which Pete grabs and pulls out of the hole, then BOOM! Bugs goes outside and engages in some small talk with Pete who offers him a cigar (\\"El Explodo\\"). After Bugs accepts it (and wisely puts it away before Pete can light it), he asks Pete to stay for tea. He pours tea into two cups, holds up the sugar bowl and asks Pete how many lumps he wants, to which Pete replies \\"Oh, three or four\\". Bugs repeatedly hits Pete Puma on the head with a wooden mallet, producing five lumps on his head which is \\"one too many\\". Bugs flattens the extra lump with a reflex hammer, then shoves the explosive cigar into Pete's mouth, lights it and runs off before the explosion. Later that day, Pete tries to disguise himself as the little rabbit's mother, prompting Bugs to start the \\"cup of tea\\" trick again. Here, Pete tries to outsmart Bugs twice but fails both times, by first suggesting they have coffee instead of tea (the \\"lumps\\" gag is predictably repeated), then by showing Bugs he has protected his head with an \\"Acme Stovelid\\"; Bugs removes it with his \\"Acme Stovelid Lifter\\", revealing the lumps on Pete's head. Shorty enjoys the shenanigans so much that he wants to get involved. As he hops down the road alone, Pete grabs him and runs home to his cave, intending to cook him. Bugs shows up in a costume disguised as Pete's second cousin, Paul Puma. He insists on helping his \\"cuz\\" get the fricasseeing off to a good start and asks how many lumps of coal Pete wants for the stove. After Pete decides that he needs a lot of lumps (\\"A whoooooooole lotta lumps\\"), he gets \\"wise\\" right away, grabs the mallet from Bugs and insists: \\"I'll help myself\\". As Pete repeatedly conks himself over the head with the mallet, Bugs & Shorty leave the cave. As they go, Bugs comments that \\"he's much too smart for us\\" and imitates Pete's laugh.

It occurs throughout North America, from southern British Columbia to Nova Scotia southwards to Arizona and Florida. The species is distasteful and there is evidence that it emits aposematic ultrasound signals; these may also jam bat echolocation, as the functions are not mutually exclusive. Ecology It is a common feeder on Apocynum cannabinum (dogbane, Indian hemp) which produces a milky latex containing cardenolides, toxic cardiac glycoside that defend against herbivores. It also feeds on milkweed species, Asclepias, at least in parts of its range, but is most commonly reported from dogbane. Its interactions with bats have been much studied, but are an area of dispute regarding whether the clicks emitted by adult moths are disruptive of bat echolocation, or merely aposematic warning signals. The two functions are not mutually exclusive, however, so it may not be possible to resolve the issue. The moth's coloration appears to be aposematic for insectivorous birds. Chemical signals do not prevent bats from attacking, but do cause bats to release C. tenera they have caught. Life cycle Dogbane tiger moth larva This moth has several generations per year through much of its range, so caterpillars may be found from June to November. Eggs are laid in clutches of 50‚Äì100. Larvae are reported to feed in aggregations of five to seven, at least in the early instars. Caterpillars are covered all over in soft grey to whitish hairs. Larvae feed at night. Dogbane tiger moth cocoon The cocoon is grayish and covered in hairs from the caterpillar's body. Adults have white wings with a buttery yellow margin along the front of the forewing; the legs are black. The underside of the forewing may have a dusting of black. The body is yellow with a row of black spots. The wingspan is . Ultrasound calls Bats refuse to eat either muted or intact moths of C. tenera. Hawking bats, that is, those seeking moths in flight, attacked intact, clicking C. tenera less frequently than surgically muted (with tymbal organs destroyed) moths in experiments. Intact moths emitted calls when the hunting bats switched from search phase calls to approach phase calls. In gleaning attacks, when bats attack moths perched on surfaces, bats use a different frequency of sound that these moths cannot hear, and the moths do not respond until actually handled by bats. Then clicking moths were dropped more frequently than mute moths. In a set of experiments using bats that had never been exposed to moths before, Hristov and Conner found the clicking signals helped the bats to learn which moths are distasteful, and so to avoid them. They did not rule out a jamming function for the calls, however, and Ratcliffe and Fullard noted 20% of these native bats aborted attacks on the moth. The calls are additionally used by male moths to signal to female moths. Like many Arctiinae, C. tenera flies all day and night, though preferentially some time after dusk. Its sense of hearing, on the other hand, is only moderately well- developed. Thus, the calls of Cycnia tenera have more of a defensive than a social function, and the aposematic role is likely to be significant.

Chic's was a place where you could pick up limeade and an ice cream. Eventually, this site became what is now Buoy 44 Restaurant. The terms Chic's and Chick's Beach have stuck.

He is the author of several short story and poetry collections, and has published six novels: The Fanatic, Joseph Knight, The Testament of Gideon Mack, And the Land Lay Still, The Professor of Truth, and To Be Continued‚Ä¶. The Testament of Gideon Mack was long-listed for the 2006 Man Booker Prize. Robertson also runs an independent publishing company called Kettillonia, and is a co-founder (with Matthew Fitt and Susan Rennie) and general editor of the Scots language imprint Itchy Coo (produced by Black & White Publishing), which produces books in Scots for children and young people. Early life Educated at Glenalmond College and Edinburgh University, Robertson attained a PhD in history at Edinburgh on the novels of Walter Scott. He also spent an exchange year at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. Robertson worked in a variety of jobs after leaving university, mainly in the book trade. He was a publisher's sales rep and later worked for Waterstone's Booksellers, first as a bookseller in Edinburgh and later as assistant manager of the Glasgow branch. Literature Robertson became a full-time author in the early 1990s. From 1993 to 1995 he was the first writer in residence at Hugh MacDiarmid's house outside Biggar, Lanarkshire. Robertson had already been heavily influenced by MacDiarmid and MacDiarmid's Scots language poetry prior to this appointment. His early short stories and first novel used contemporary and historical life in Edinburgh as a key theme, drawing on his experience of living there intermittently during his PhD and during the later 1990s before moving to Fife, and subsequently Angus. Each of his three novels has been influenced to a degree by where he was living when he wrote them. Joseph Knight is based on the true story of a slave brought from the Caribbean to Scotland, and the novel revolves primarily around the cities of Dundee, near where Robertson was then living, and Edinburgh. The Testament of Gideon Mack, meanwhile, is set in a fictitious rural village that resembles the villages of eastern Scotland bordering the Highlands between Dundee and Aberdeen where Robertson currently lives. His novels, therefore, feature the Scottish urban and rural landscape as prevalently as Scottish history between the 17th and 20th centuries. While Robertson's first two novels featured the Scottish past (The Fanatic merged a story of contemporary Scotland in the months surrounding the 1997 election with a story of Scotland in the 17th century, while Joseph Knight was purely historical) he is not a historical novelist, and Gideon Mack was set in Scotland between the 1950s and the present day. The other side of Robertson's career since circa 2000 has been Itchy Coo, a publisher of children's books in the Scots language. Initially funded by the Scottish Arts Council, Itchy Coo has proved to be a popular enterprise. Robertson's interest in and use of Scots also features heavily in his poetry and prose, and notably in his first two novels, which blend modern English with Scots. Katie‚Äôs Moose won the early years category in the Royal Mail Awards for Scottish Children's Books 2007. In 2011 Robertson contributed a short story \\"The Quaking of the Aspen\\" to an anthology supporting The Woodland Trust. The anthology - Why Willows Weep - has so far helped The Woodland Trust plant approximately 50,000 trees, and is to be re-released in paperback format in 2016. Personal life Politically, Robertson was involved in the political magazine Radical Scotland in the 1980s. He was awarded an honorary degree by The Open University at the degree ceremony in the Usher Hall, Edinburgh on 21 June 2014.

He was one of the founders of the Pan-American Mission and later founded Corvilla, a Christian retreat center in Zephyrhills, Florida.  Biography  In his twenties, Holt graduated from college with a degree in chemistry and for a while taught that subject at the high school level. During the late depression and early years of World War II he sang to make his living as a nightclub entertainer. Following a religious experience in 1943, Holt redirected his life towards the ministry, attending Central Bible Institute, an Assemblies of God Bible school in Springfield, Missouri. Following his graduation, he served in the Assemblies of God as a pastor and evangelist, both in the United States and in Africa. He was also designated the national soloist for the Assemblies of God with a daily radio program. In 1947 the Latter Rain Revival, precursor to the Latter Rain Movement emerged in the Assemblies of God and Holt associated himself with that movement. When the movement was rejected by the leadership of the Assemblies of God, Holt and a number of other adherents were dismissed or resigned from the Assemblies of God. Holt, along with Donald W. Murphy, former missionary to India and Illinois District Superintendent for the Assemblies, joined Dr. Thomas Wyatt at the Wings of Healing Temple in Portland, Oregon. Holt also spent time at Bethesda Missionary Temple in Detroit, Michigan, the spiritual center of the Latter Rain Revival, founded by Myrtle Beall. It was there that Holt met and married Lucille Hamer. In 1950 Holt and his wife Lucille moved to Portland, Oregon where he was Dean of Bethesda Bible Institute till 1954 and also on staff at the Wings of Healing Temple. He also sang on the international Wings of Healing Radio Broadcast. In November 1953, Holt along with Max Wyatt, Paul Shaver and Paul Cannon met Dr. Thomas Wyatt and Raymond G. Hoekstra in Ibadon, Nigeria where they held huge meetings at the Race Track with many thousands attending. Great healings and miracles happened nightly. Completing those meetings they went to Accra, Gold Coast (Ghana) in meetings with healing and miracles happening there. After a week Dr. Wyatt and Hoekstra returned home. Holt and Max Wyatt remained for a month leaving the two younger men to continue the meetings all over Ghana and Nigeria. Upon leaving the Bible School, he founded Shiloh Temple in Muncie, Indiana. He was a significant contributor to the Jesus movement of the 1970s. Presenting himself as part of the \\"establishment\\" he was also able to connect with the hippie youth culture of that era and organize their informal gatherings into ongoing house church congregations. As an older, mature Christian leader, he was able to provide some guidance to otherwise leaderless youth gatherings. Holt encouraged the development of house churches on college campuses. As the Jesus movement came to its quick end, many of the house churches he formed or nurtured moved into forming established churches, including Calvary Chapel. After the demise of the Jesus movement, Holt continued to travel throughout the United States, and on occasion to other nations. He continued to visit \\"remnant\\" groups of Christians, such as those in house churches and informal Bible study gatherings that were not connected to any denomination or structure. Holt was a follower of Charismatic Christianity and believed in traditional Pentecostal gifts, such as speaking in tongues. He strongly advocated a teaching known as five-fold ministry.

In 1964, he became the 6th Baron Deramore and 7th Baronet upon the death of his elder brother, the 5th Baron Deramore. Determined to pursue a career as a writer, he collected many rejection letters before a short story, A Touch of Bird Lime, was published. His first novel, Still Waters was published in 1997. He lost his seat in the House of Lords after the House of Lords Act 1999. Upon his death in 2006, aged 95, the barony and baronetcy became extinct.

It was produced in several variations and sub-variations, including both the \\"Russian Model\\", so named because it was supplied to the military of the Russian Empire (41,000 No. 3's were ordered in .44 caliber by the Imperial Russian Army in 1871), and the \\"Schofield\\" model, named after Major George W. Schofield, who made his own modifications to the Model 3 to meet his perceptions of the Cavalry's needs. Smith & Wesson incorporated these modifications into an 1875 design they named after the Major, planning to obtain significant military contracts for the new revolver. The S&W; Model 3 was originally chambered for the .44 S&W; American and .44 Russian cartridges, and typically did not have the cartridge information stamped on the gun (as is standard practice for most commercial firearms). Model 3 revolvers were later produced in an assortment of calibers, including .44 Henry Rimfire, .44-40, .32-44, .38-44, and .45 Schofield. The design would influence the smaller S&W; .38 Single Action that is retroactively referred to as the Model 2. Russian Model George Amstrong Custer with Grand Duke Alexei Alexandrovitch after the Duke Buffalo Hunt; the Duke with his new Smith & Wesson No. 3 in the holster Smith & Wesson No. 3, open for loading. Note: the automatic ejector is up. Smith & Wesson Russian Model No. 3 Smith & Wesson produced large numbers of the Model 3, in three distinct models, for the Russian Empire by special order. The first was the 1st Model Russian (the original order design), with the Russian Ordnance Inspector mandating a number of improvements to the design, resulting in the 2nd Model Russian, with a final revision to the Russian design being known as the 3rd Model Russian. Smith & Wesson nearly went bankrupt as a result of their Russian contract production, as the imperial government assigned a number of engineers and gunsmiths to reverse-engineer the Smith & Wesson design, and then began to produce copies of the revolver‚Äîboth in their own arsenal at Tula and by contracting other manufacturers in Germany and elsewhere in Europe to manufacture copies of the revolver (a common practice at the time‚ÄîWebley & Scott's British Bulldog revolver was widely copied, too, by European and American gunsmiths). The Russian and European copies of the S&W; Model 3 revolver were generally of very high quality, but considerably cheaper than the S&W; produced revolvers. This led to the imperial government cancelling the order for significant quantities of Smith & Wesson‚Äìmade revolvers (which Smith & Wesson had already produced), and delaying (or refusing) payment for the handguns that had already been delivered.Lawman, Tuolumne \\"Smith & Wesson's #3, Colt's Biggest Rival in the Old West\\". . Sam Hane's Western History. Schofield Revolver The U.S. Army adopted the .44 S&W; American caliber Smith & Wesson Model 3 revolver in 1870, making the Model 3 revolver the first standard-issue cartridge-firing revolver in US service. Most military pistols until that point were black powder cap and ball revolvers, which were (by comparison) slow, complicated, and susceptible to the effects of wet weather. In 1875, the US Ordnance Board granted Smith & Wesson a contract to outfit the military with Model 3 revolvers incorporating the design improvements of Major George W. Schofield (known as the \\"Schofield revolver\\"), providing that they could make the revolvers fire the .45 Colt (AKA \\".45 Long Colt\\") ammunition already in use by the US military. Smith & Wesson instead developed their own, slightly shorter .45 caliber round, the .45 Schofield, otherwise known as the .45 S&W.; When it became obvious in the field that the two cartridges would not work interchangeably in the Schofield (although they both worked in the Colt), the U.S. Government adopted the shorter .45 Schofield cartridge as the standard cartridge. Despite the change, old stocks of the longer .45 Colt rounds in the supply line caused the Army to drop most of the Schofields and continue with the Colt. Major Schofield had patented his locking system and earned a payment on each gun that Smith & Wesson sold, and at the time his older brother, John M. Schofield, was the head of the Army Ordnance Board and the political situation may have been the main issue for the early end of army sales. Many of the S&W; Model 3 Schofield revolvers saw service in the Indian Wars, and there are reports of them in use as late as the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War and Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War. Like the other Smith & Wesson Model 3s, they were also reportedly popular with lawmen and outlaws in the American West, and were reportedly used by Jesse James, Bob Ford (who used one to kill James), John Wesley Hardin, Pat Garrett, Theodore Roosevelt, Virgil Earp, Billy the Kid, and many others. The Smith & Wesson No. 3 revolver was famously used by Wyatt Earp during the OK Corral Gunfight with the Clanton Gang. While the standard barrel length was 7\\", many Schofields were purchased as surplus by distributors, and had the barrels shortened to 5\\", and were refinished in nickel. After the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War of 1898, the US Army sold off all their surplus Schofield revolvers. The surplus Schofield revolvers were reconditioned by wholesalers and gunsmiths (at professional factory-quality level) with a considerable number offered for sale on the commercial market with a 5-inch barrel as well as the standard size barrel of 7 inches. Of the most notable purchasers of these reconditioned model 3 Schofield revolvers was Wells Fargo and Company, who purchased the revolvers for use by Wells Fargo Road Agents and had the barrels shortened to a more concealable 5 inches length. These revolvers were then inspected by the Wells Fargo armorer and uniquely stamped \\"W.F. & Co\\" or \\"Wells Fargo & Co\\", along with the original Smith & Wesson serial number re-stamped alongside the Wells Fargo stamping on the flat part of the barrel just forward of the barrel pivot as well as re-stamping any part of each revolver which had not originally been stamped or stamped in a location that would be difficult to view the serial number, when needed. The Wells Fargo Schofield revolvers became so popular with collectors from the 1970s onwards that the unique Wells Fargo markings were being \\"counterfeited\\" or \\"faked\\" by unscrupulous sellers to enhance the value of other similar versions that had not been genuinely owned by Wells Fargo & Co. There are more \\"fake\\" Wells Fargo marked Schofield revolvers than genuine ones in existence and, accordingly, a collector interested in purchasing a \\"Wells Fargo\\" Schofield revolver would be well advised to have a pre-purchase inspection and verification performed by an expert who specializes in this model. Lieutenant Colonel Schofield shot himself on December 17, 1882, with a S&W; Schofield revolver after suffering a bout of mental illness, stress and isolation. An engraved, gold-plated New Model Number 3 with pearl grips was presented to sharpshooter Annie Oakley in the 1890s by her husband Frank Butler. The revolver was one of three embellished guns that were cased for Oakley as a presentation group. =Versions= First Model Schofield The First Model Schofield has a latch configuration that is rather pointed at the top and has a circle around the screw head at the bottom. Second Model Schofield The Second Model latch has a large raised circle at the top of the latch. One of General Schofield's revisions and improvements to the predecessor Model 3 Revolvers included mounting the spring-loaded barrel catch on the frame as opposed to the standard Smith & Wesson Model 3 which has the latch mounted on the barrel. In the previous engineering, the posts of the frame would wear out after heavy usage. Schofield's improvement called for heat treated, replaceable components at this sensitive \\"wear\\" area of the catch and latch. The serial number range also will give an indication of whether it is First or Second Model, with the serial numbers changing from the First Model to the Second Model at a little over 3,000. New Model Number 3 Smith & Wesson No. 3, New Model, 44 Russian In 1877, S&W; discontinued production of its other Model 3s such as the American, Russian, and Schofield‚Äîin favor a new improved design called the New Model Number Three. This new model has a longer cylinder allowing it to fire longer cartridges. Standard chambering was .44 Russian, although other calibers were offered on special order or in related models such as the .44-40 Frontier Model, the .32-44 & .38-44 Target Models, and the very rare .38-40 Winchester Model. Australian Model In 1880 the South Australia Police, who were then interested in re-arming with up-to-date weapons, noted a display of New Model Number Three revolvers at the Australian Exposition in Melbourne. At the direction of Police Commissioner Peterswald an order was placed through S&W;'s New York agent for 250 nickel revolvers in .44 Russian with a seven- inch barrel length. The order, which included extension shoulder stocks, ammunition, and reloading kits, arrived at Adelaide in March 1882. The revolvers and stocks were thereupon marked with a government broad arrow punch mark, and were called revolver-carbines. They were issued to mounted police, known as troopers, who at that period also policed the Northern Territory. Both the South Australia and Western Australia police made further small purchases during 1886-88, none of which was marked with the broad arrow. For some thirty years the revolver-carbine was the front line weapon of the mounted police of S.A., W.A., and N.T. Nearly all serial numbers are known, and are listed in the book Service Arms of the South Australian Police.Service Arms of the South Australian Police : 1838 to 1988, the first 150 years by Max Slee : (Antique & Historical Arms Assoc., of South Australia, Adelaide, 1988) : The S.A. revolvers were sold as surplus in 1953 to the Western Arms Corporation of Los Angeles. 1st Model .44 Double Action Often improperly referred to as a \\"New Model 3 Double Action\\". The 1st Model .44 Double Action is NOT a Model 3 production / variation but rather a stand alone model. (edited 7/23/20 by Sal Raimondi, Sr., S&W; Collectors Assn, life member #1300 & contributing editor to the Blue Book of Gun Values on entire S&W; production since 1994). Copies The popular Model 3 was copied in many countries. Most common were the versions made in Spain, Mexico and Belgium; but companies such as Ludwig Loewe & Company of Germany and the Tula Arsenal in Russia played a hand in the counterfeit game, too. Copies have been found in Turkey and Pakistan as well, made by local manufacturers. =11mm Orbea Hermanos y Cia. M1884 Sistema ON√Å (\\"S&W; Model 7\\")= An Orbea Hermanos revolver at the Seville Military History Museum. In 1884 the Spanish government made a decree stating that any invention not copyrighted by their copyright office was not under their protection. One victim of this was Smith & Wesson, whose lucrative contract to produce Model 3 revolvers for the Spanish Army was quickly cancelled. Its work given to local gunsmiths in Eibar by different firms without any standardization of parts. The Orbea Hermanos Modelo 1884 Sistema ON√Å (Basque on√° > \\"good\\") or \\"S&W; Model 7\\" revolver was made from 1884 until the 1920s. It is notable for its grip medallion, which is an \\"OH\\" interlaced like the Smith & Wesson \\"S&W;\\". An interesting footnote is that Smith & Wesson immediately copyrighted all of their other designs in Spain from then on. That is why their firearms have MARCA REGISTRADA and the date of the Spanish patent on their barrels. =Liege copies= There were a number of unauthorized Belgian copies made in .44 Russian and .44-40 Winchester as Single and Double Action revolvers. These copies, mostly manufactured in Liege, were marked as if to deceive a buyer into thinking that they were a revolver produced by Smith & Wesson. Many of the finer details such as the location of the Smith & Wesson factory were incorrectly stamped on the revolvers (\\"New York\\" and \\"VK\\" being the two most common). Smith & Wesson brought lawsuits against two gunmakers in Liege, which they originally lost, but won on appeal. =Users= Italy The prime contractor for the Italian military was Orbea, which chambered their revolvers for the Italian 10.4mm cartridge. These Spanish-made revolvers were used during World War I, and according to online sources were the preferred handgun of elite Arditi troops. Philippines Many Spanish firearms were captured by the Liberation Army during the Revolution, among them Model 1884 revolvers. Some were brought by defectors from the Spanish military. These handguns also saw service, later, in the Philippine-American War. Romania Revolvers for the Romanian military were chambered for the .44 Russian cartridge, and were made by Trocaola, Aranzabal y C√≠a. These Spanish-made revolvers were used during World War I. Spain Spain used these revolvers, which were chambered for the .44 Russian cartridge, during the Philippine Revolution, the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, the Rif War, and the Spanish Civil War. United Kingdom The M1884 was later briefly made chambered in .455 Webley for British government contracts in 1915 and 1916. It was designated by the British Army as the \\"Pistol, Old Pattern\\", due to its old design. They were dubbed \\"Spanish Webleys\\" by troops even though they were copies of the S&W; Model 3. Orbea Hermanos y Cia., Garate, Anitua y Cia., and Trocaola, Aranzabal y Cia. were contracted to make 30,000 revolvers among them. Orbea Hermanos was the major contractor and the other two were sub-contractors. Rexach & Urgoite was later contracted in 1916 to make 500 pistols but all failed proofing and the lot was refused. Finish and quality control was varied throughout the run of production. The fact that they were making service pistols and revolvers for France and Italy at the same time was definitely a factor. As there was no standardization of design or parts between manufacturers, each manufacturer's model was considered a different gun altogether. The Garate, Anitua y Cia. model was designated the Pistol, Old Pattern, No.1 Mk.I,Taylerson-Chamberlain, W. H. J. and A. W. F. Revolvers of the British Services, 1854-1944, pp. 57-59.Maze, Robert J. Howdah to High Power ‚Äì A Century of British Breechloading Service Pistols (1867-1967), pp. 93-94 the Trocaola, Aranzabal y Cia. model was designated the Pistol, Old Pattern, No.2 Mk.I, and the Orbea Hermanos model was designated the Pistol, Old Pattern, No.3 Mk.I. The weapons were given to the Royal Ulster Constabulary after the war. The RUC later sold them off to the New South Wales Police Force, who made snub-nosed revolvers out of them and issued them as backup pistols. A cut-down snub-nosed .455 \\"Old Pattern\\" Revolver was carried by one of Michael Collins' bodyguards. Empire Of Japan Modern reproductions Modern reproductions of the Smith & Wesson model 3 Revolver are made by a number of companies, including (most notably) Smith & Wesson themselves, as well as the Italian arms-makers Uberti and Armi San Marco. =Smith & Wesson= Smith & Wesson manufactured a modern reproduction of the original Model 3 Revolvers from 2000 to 2003. Despite being touted as a \\"true\\" reproduction, there are significant differences between the modern version and the original. Side-by-side comparison of an original with the pre-production gun showed that the new version is slightly more stout than the original around the barrel and top strap, though not as much as on the Navy Arms guns. Changes in the internal lock mechanism were also made. The \\"reproduction\\" S&W; Model 3 firing pin is frame-mounted instead of being an integral part of the hammer, a modern safety feature ‚Äì with a transfer bar as a practical safety catch in a revolver ‚Äì preventing accidental discharge if dropped. There is no transfer bar on the firing pin but a blocking bar on the hammer, should it slip off the thumb when cocking the pistol. A heavier cylinder was fitted into the stronger frame. Unlike the Uberti reproductions that have a longer-than-original cylinder and frame the S&W; was made to only accommodate the shorter original Schofield rounds. =Uberti/Armi San Marco= The Uberti version, imported by Navy Arms and Cimarron Firearms, has external dimensions generally similar to the original 2nd Model Schofield, but the barrel and topstrap are considerably thicker, for additional strength. These replica Model 3 revolvers have lengthened cylinders to accommodate .45 Colt and .44-40 cartridges. Although there were some problems with the locking latch angles in early versions, these were generally corrected or the revolvers were replaced. European reproduction Model 3 revolvers have changes made to their lockwork to meet import regulations. A Uberti produced reproduction was also marketed as the Beretta Laramie.

In 520, after a conflict with her lover Yuan Yi (ÂÖÉÊáå) the Prince of Qinghe, he killed Yuan Yi and put Empress Dowager Hu under house arrest, effectively taking over as regent. In 525, a countercoup by Empress Dowager Hu restored her, and bowing to public pressure, she forced him to commit suicide. Background Yuan Cha was the oldest son of Yuan Ji (ÂÖÉÁπº) the Prince of Jiangyang, who was a distant member of the imperial clan, whose ancestor was a son of Northern Wei's founder Emperor Daowu. He served as a low level official in Emperor Xuanwu's administration. Rise to power After Emperor Xuanwu's death in 515 and succession by his young son Emperor Xiaoming, Emperor Xiaoming's mother Empress Dowager Hu, who was Emperor Xuanwu's concubine, became regent. Yuan Cha had married Empress Dowager Hu's sister, whom she created the Lady of Fengyi and saw often. Because of this relationship, Yuan Cha became trusted by her and was continuously promoted. As a result, Yuan Cha became corrupt and arrogant. Empress Dowager Hu forced Emperor Xuanwu's brother Yuan Yi the Prince of Qinghe, who was popular among the people and the officials for his humility and abilities, to have an affair with her, and Yuan Yi, by 520, was effectively the leader of the administration. He often curbed the abuses of power that both Yuan Cha and the eunuch Liu Teng (ÂäâÈ®∞), who became powerful because he had once saved Empress Dowager Hu's life. Yuan Cha therefore had one of his associates, Song Wei (ÂÆãÁ∂≠), falsely accuse Yuan Yi of treason, and Empress Dowager Hu, for some time, put Yuan Yi under house arrest while she investigated, but eventually Yuan Yi was cleared. Yuan Cha, fearful of retaliation by Yuan Yi, conspired with Liu Teng, and after convincing the 10-year-old Emperor Xiaoming that Yuan Yi was in fact plotting treason, took Emperor Xiaoming into their custody and then carried out a coup against Yuan Yi and Empress Dowager Hu, executing Yuan Yi and putting Empress Dowager Hu under house arrest. Yuan Cha made Emperor Xiaoming's granduncle Yuan Yong the Prince of Gaoyang the titular head of government, but in effect, Yuan Cha, in association with Liu, was the actual regent. Regency Yuan Cha was not particularly able as a regent, and he and Liu multiplied their corruption once they were in power. Yuan Cha himself was not dedicated at all to the affairs of state, but spent much of his time on feasting, drinking, and women. He put his father Yuan Ji and his brothers into positions of power, and they were just as corrupt. Yuan Cha's incompetence and corruption, together with the level of corruption that Empress Dowager Hu herself tolerated while in power, led to popular dissatisfaction with the regime and many agrarian revolts, although the first revolt was by a non-agrarian‚ÄîYuan Xi (ÂÖÉÁÜô) the Prince of Zhongshan, who was friendly with both Empress Dowager Hu and Yuan Yi‚Äîin fall 520, trying to avenge Yuan Yi and restore Empress Dowager Hu. Yuan Cha quickly had Yuan Xi's rebellion suppressed. In late 520, Yuan Cha spent much of Northern Wei's energy on trying to restore Rouran's khan Yujiul√º Anagui, who had been overthrown by his cousin Yujiul√º Shifa (ÈÉÅ‰πÖÈñ≠Á§∫Áôº), despite warnings that doing so would either be fruitless or counterproductive. The restoration was successful, but by 523 Yujiul√º Anagui had rebelled and was an enemy to Northern Wei again. In spring 521, the general Xi Kangsheng (Â•öÂ∫∑Áîü) made an attempt to restore Empress Dowager Hu, but failed. Yuan Cha had him put to death. In 523, the official Li Chong (ÊùéÂ¥á) saw that the people of the six northern military garrisons, largely ethnic Xianbei, who had for generations been forced to stay at those garrisons to defend against Rouran attacks, were stirring with discontent, and he suggested to Yuan Cha and Emperor Xiaoming that the garrisons be converted into provinces and that the people be given the rights of the people of other provinces. Yuan Cha refused. Later that year, the people of Huaihuang (Êá∑Ëçí, in modern Zhangjiakou, Hebei) and Woye (Ê≤ÉÈáé, in modern Bayan Nur, Inner Mongolia) Garrisons rebelled‚Äîrebellions that Northern Wei forces could not quickly quell, and the rebellions soon spread throughout not only the six garrisons but throughout virtually the entire empire. Death In 525, Yuan Faseng (ÂÖÉÊ≥ïÂÉß), the governor of Xu Province (ÂæêÂ∑û, modern northern Jiangsu), who had been a close associate of Yuan Cha, believing that Yuan Cha would soon fall, rebelled as well, declaring himself emperor. After some initial defeats at the hands of Northern Wei forces sent against him, he surrendered his post of Pengcheng (ÂΩ≠Âüé, in modern Xuzhou, Jiangsu) to Northern Wei's southern rival Liang Dynasty. By this point, Yuan Cha's precautions against Empress Dowager Hu had been greatly relaxed, particularly after Liu Teng's death in 523, as he no longer saw her as a threat. Empress Dowager Hu, Emperor Xiaoming, and Yuan Yong therefore took the chance to conspire against Yuan Cha. Empress Dowager Hu first threw Yuan Cha's guard off by often discussing about his overly trusting of Yuan Faseng, which caused Yuan Cha to be an apologetic mood. Then, with his agreement, she relieved him of his command of the imperial guards, replacing him with his associate Hou Gang (‰æØÂâõ). In summer 525, she took sudden action and declared herself regent again, killing most of Yuan Cha's and Liu's associates and putting Yuan Cha under house arrest. However, she was initially hesitant to take further action against Yuan Cha, because of her relationship with her sister. Eventually, however, with popular opinion favoring Yuan Cha's death, she forced him and his brother Yuan Gua (ÂÖÉÁìú) to commit suicide, but still posthumously awarded him much honor.

The line closed in the 1980s, but a heritage railway group, the Yarra Valley Railway, is working to retain part of the line between Yarra Glen and Healesville. History The Lilydale railway line was extended to Yarra Flats (now known as Yarra Glen) on 15 May 1888 with intermediate stations at Coldstream and Yering. Part of the structure included a long timber viaduct with 502 openings near Yarra Glen, spanning the Yarra River and the adjacent flood plains. The extension of the line from Yarra Glen to Healesville on 1 March 1889 required a 1 in 40 climb into a 154.4 metre tunnel with a corresponding descent at nearly the same grade. Opened at the same time was the intermediate station of Tarrawarra. Traffic on the line included timber, livestock, milk and dairy products. Early timetables included regular goods services specifically for transporting milk. The last regular steam passenger service was hauled in August 1964. From that time until the closure of the line in 1980, passenger services were run using diesel-electric rail motors. As from 9 December 1980 all services were withdrawn, except for some goods services to Coldstream. The line was officially closed to all traffic on 10 March 1983. Around 2003 the uncontrolled level crossings at Beresford Rd and the Macintyre Lane were effectively removed by simply rebuilding the roads at a slightly raised level, burying the tracks beneath the bitumen. This was advantageous for the bus company whose depot is situated near the Beresford Rd crossing as buses are required to come to a complete stop at uncontrolled level crossings even if the rail line is disused. Stopping is no longer necessary now that the crossing has been removed. On 7 February 2009 most of the trestle bridges which were a major part of the viaduct crossing the Yarra river and its floodplains were destroyed in the Black Saturday bushfires. Services The Healesville line had both passenger and freight services. The passenger services generally ran as a shuttle between Lilydale and Healesville stations. The freight services transported local timber, live-stock, and dairy products. Early trains running on the line included a daily evening \\"mixed milk and passenger train\\" and a single milk train on Sundays. Prior to electrification reaching Lilydale in November 1925, the line was operated by 'A2' locomotives. After this time passenger trains on the Healesville and Warburton lines were run by two electric motor carriages from Melbourne to Lilydale, at which place 'K' or 'D3' steam locos took the carriages onto Healesville and Warburton. On 28 October 1957 the steam hauled 7-day-a-week service was replaced by a 153hp Walker railmotor operating four services a day each way and three on weekends. Prior to this, services were limited to three each way on weekdays and two each way on weekends. On 21 April 1958 the Victorian Education Department subsidised school trains using a Walker railcar. This rail car service crossed with other services at Yarra Glen until 1972. Trains operating on the line Throughout the existence of the line many steam and diesel locomotives and railcars operated on the Healesville line. *R class steam locomotives (1889‚Äì) *D class steam locomotives (1908‚Äì) By 1913 all classes of locomotives were permitted on the line, however by 1918 all classes but the C class were allowed. *A2 locomotives (ceased by 1925) *J, K and D3 steam locomotives (ceased regular service in 1964). *T and B class diesels (1952‚Äì1962). *Y class diesel (until the line's official closure) *Walker railmotor (1957‚Äì1978). *DERM 62 (1978‚Äì1979) *DERM 58 (1979‚Äì1980) Towards the closure of the line the DERM (Diesel Electric Rail Motor) was only permitted a maximum speed on 30 km/h and no locomotive-hauled passenger trains were permitted. Only \\"Y\\" class diesels could haul the freight services due to the deterioration of the track condition, which resulted in the derailment of T401 on 5 August 1980. Current status The Yarra Valley Railway currently run a Walker railmotor from Healesville to the Tarrawarra Winery, crossing the Watts River, under the Donovan's Road overbridge and through the tunnel. There are plans in place to improve the line from Healesville to Tarrawarra to a standard suitable for the running of Rail Motors, with further goals being reconstruction to Yarra Glen. Works are underway to restore the track from Yarra Glen to Healesville following the loss of 13 bridges on Black Saturday 2009. It is hoped to have this complete by 2017, as much progress has been made by an enthusiastic volunteer group throughout 2015. Railmotor operations have commenced with restored 153 hp walker railmotor RM22 receiving accreditation to run a passenger train on the line as of 5 March 2010. It ran its first paying passenger run since restored on 7 March with the seats being auctioned in singles, doubles and triples to the exhibitors of the model railway show. The tourist railway is in possession of a number of locomotives, including two Victorian Railways J-class steam engines, a T-class diesel-electric locomotive, a W-class diesel-hydraulic locomotive, a Y-Class diesel, a 153 hp Walker Rail motor and a diesel electric rail motor (DERM).

It was released on Blackout Records in December, 2003 and it follows the Posthumous EP which was released in the same year. The album takes influence from several musical styles with an overall melodic hardcore sound. In line with the band's horrorcore imagery, the cover depicts a photograph of a cassette tape clipped to a blood-soaked diary. The inlay follows this theme through, with the lyrics largely in handwriting as if in a diary. The label on the CD itself is black with a splash of red to symbolise a bloodstained handprint. The song material and lyrics are quite dark, covering subjects consistent with the cover and inlay image, such as zombies, murder, conflict, and personal rejection. In spite of all this imagery, the band still felt the need to add a liner note proclaiming, \\"These songs are fictional and aren't a veiled threat to anyone living or dead. Seriously\\". Overview The first few tracks are in the same vein as the band's Posthumous (EP) material, mixing metal with hardcore in equal measures, before moving into more intricate arrangements with more metal elements. The metal material culminates with \\"Black Duct Tape\\" which is verging on black metal, before moving back to hardcore with \\"Red Devil\\". The closing track proper ‚Äì before the silence and hidden track ‚Äì \\"September Song\\" slows the pace down slightly and is perhaps a precursor for the material to come on their next album, Each Breath Haunted.

Biography He was born in La Paz, Tarlac to Alejandro Macabulos of Lubao, Pampanga and Gregoria Soliman. He organized the first Katipunan group there after he was inducted into the secret society by Ladislao Diwa in 1896. When the revolution broke out in 1898, he liberated Tarlac and established town councils in areas he liberated. Macabulos refused to honor the Pact of Biak-na-Bato, which called for a truce with the Spanish colonial government, and continued operations in Central Luzon. But on January 14, 1898, he disbanded his troops and accepted amnesty after receiving P14,000 as part of Spanish reparations to Filipino revolutionaries. Macabulos distributed the money to his men. However, he resumed operations against the Spanish and on April 17, 1898, an assembly of citizens representing the town councils Macabulos established, calling themselves representatives of Central Luzon, met and drafted a provisional constitution. They created the Central Executive Committee, a government that was to exist \\"until a general government of the Republic in these islands shall again be established\\", consisting of a president, vice president, secretary of interior, secretary of war and a secretary of the treasury. Macabulos dissolved his government after the First Philippine Republic was created by the Malolos Constitution, which he also signed. He also led his men to free nearby provinces, like Pangasinan where he led revolutionists in the Battle of Dagupan.http://losindiosbravos.blogspot.com/2010/11/1898-battle-of- dagupan-pangasinan.html Images File:Francisco Makabulos House historical marker.jpgHistorical marker File:FranciscoMakabulosjf7362 02.JPGMonument marker File:FranciscoMakabulosjf7362 03.JPGMarker File:FranciscoMakabulosjf7362 06.JPGFacade of the Ancestral house (La Paz, Tarlac) File:FranciscoMakabulosjf7362 04.JPGThe Heritage house, still to be restored File:Francisco Makabulos House site 2018 1.jpgHeritage house site as of 2018.

An Australian international and Queensland State of Origin representative, he played club football in the Brisbane Rugby League premiership for the Souths Magpies (winning the 1985 grand final) and in the NSWRL Premiership for the Canberra Raiders (winning the 1989 and 1990 grand finals). Belcher's position of choice was . 1980s Belcher in 1985 played for the Wayne Bennett coached Magpies in the 10-8 BRL grand final win over Wynnum Manly at Lang Park, alongside the pairing of Mal Meninga and Peter Jackson. In 1986 he and Meninga signed with the Canberra Raiders, making his d√©but in Round 1 of the season against Manly-Warringah at Brookvale Oval. He also made his State of Origin d√©but for Queensland in 1986, the first year the Maroons lost the series 3‚Äì0. Belcher had replaced long- serving Qld fullback Colin Scott. He won the Raiders 1986 player of the year award and was also selected for the season-ending 1986 Kangaroo tour. However, as the understudy to incumbent fullback Garry Jack, he played no test matches on the tour, though he did play in ten matches on the tour scoring 6 tries. Early in the tour Belcher often joined the Channel 10 commentary team for games in which he did not play. In 1987, Belcher again won the Raiders' player of the year award and played in the grand final against Manly-Warringah. Belcher kicked a goal to convert a late Chris O'Sullivan try, but the Raiders were defeated 18‚Äì8 in front of 50,201 in what was the last grand final played at the Sydney Cricket Ground. In 1989, Belcher scored Canberra's first try in their dramatic 19‚Äì14 Grand Final victory over Balmain. The extra-time win securing the club its first premiership. A fortnight later, Belcher started in Canberra's first (and to date only) appearance in the World Club Challenge, which the Raiders would lose 30‚Äì18 to Widnes. 1990s In 1990, Belcher was again at fullback for Canberra as they beat Penrith 18‚Äì14 in the Grand Final to secure back to back premierships. Belcher was one of five Canberra players selected for the 1990 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain and France, and played in all three tests against Great Britain, with Australia winning the series 2-1. Belcher also played in the first test against France, scoring two tries in the comfortable 60-4 victory for Australia. In 1991, Belcher played in his, and Canberra's, fourth Grand Final in five years, as Penrith beat Canberra 19‚Äì12. Despite still being good enough to represent Queensland during the State of Origin series of 1993, a combination of injuries and salary cap constraints at the Raiders forced Belcher to announce his retirement at the end of that season. Post-playing career Belcher spent time on the Brisbane Broncos coaching staff until a major cleanout by head coach Wayne Bennett at the end of 2005 saw him removed. He has been a commentator for Fox Sports coverage of NRL matches since sometime before 2007. In 2017, he joined the Seven Network to call matches of the 2017 Rugby League World Cup.

Self-taught, he became a writer within the socialist movement and published journals important to the radical intellectual culture of Budapest in the early 1900s. Although he cannot be fully identified with any single avant-garde movement, he adopted elements of expressionism, futurism and dadaism. Early life and education Lajos Kass√°k was born in √ârsek√∫jv√°r, Austria-Hungary (present-day Nov√© Z√°mky, Slovakia). His father was an apothecary assistant and his mother a laundress. Although his parents wanted him to attend higher education, he decided to quit his studies and started work as a locksmith assistant, gaining a letter of indenture as an apprentice. His sister was Erzsi √öjv√°ri who went on to marry S√°ndor Barta. Career In 1904 Kass√°k moved to Budapest, where he worked in a factory on the outskirts of the city. He participated in the labor union movement, and organized several strikes. In 1905 he was fired several times for organizing strikes. In 1907 he left for Paris ‚Äì on foot and without any money; the city was attracting artists and intellectuals from throughout eastern Europe. He was expelled to Hungary in 1910. The experiences of this journey were later covered in his autobiography entitled Egy ember √©lete (A Man's Life). Despite his lack of formal education and inadequate writing skills, Kass√°k began to publish his works. His first poem was published in 1908, and his first collections of short stories in 1912, titled √âletsirat√°s. In 1915 he published his first collection of poems, √âposz Wagner maszkj√°ban (Epic in the Mask of Wagner). That same year, he launched his first journal, entitled A Tett (The Action), which was soon censored and banned for being \\"pacifist\\". He was part of the intellectual movement that included the group of painters known as The Eight whose work he supported in his journals. He started Ma (Today) in Budapest, and later published it from Vienna. During the Hungarian Soviet Republic in 1919, he became a member of the special Writers Directorate. After fierce debates with the republic's leader, B√©la Kun, he distanced himself from Bolshevism whilst always remaining a leftist. He never distinguished between being a socially responsible individual and an artist: his art was part of his self-definition as a \\"socialist man\\". After the fall of the Hungarian Soviet Republic, he emigrated to Vienna. There he continued publishing his second journal, MA (\\"Today\\" but also \\"Magyar Aktivizmus\\"= Hungarian Activism]). He also published an anthology, Buch neuer K√ºnstler, a project in which L√°szl√≥ Moholy-Nagy was to help him by gathering material for him from Berlin. However in May 1922 B√©la Uitz and Alad√°r Komj√°t published the first issue of Egys√©g, a rival journal, critical of Kassak. In 1926, Kass√°k returned to Hungary. He continued editing and publishing journals such as Munka (Work) (1927‚Äì1938) and Dokumentum (Document) (1927), both of which were independent leftist avant-garde journals. His autobiography, Egy ember √©lete (A Man's Life) was published in sections periodically in the Hungarian literary journal, Nyugat, between 1923 and 1937. After he published it as a book, he was prosecuted because of its chapters concerning the Hungarian Soviet Republic. He regularly published in leftist newspapers. From 1945 to 1947, he edited the journal Kort√°rs (Contemporary), which closed when it was banned. In 1947 he returned to political duties, as the communists had taken over the Hungarian government. He was appointed as the head of the Social Democratic Party's Art Commission. In 1948 he became an MP. A year later he had to change seats in the Parliament, and later he had to resign, and finally retire because of the change of the political climate. In 1953, Kass√°k criticised the Party's cultural politics, and was expelled from the party. Because of this, he was not allowed to publish for years, until 1956, when he was elected to be a chair in the Writers Association, an influential organization of the era. From 1957 he became practically muted by the cultural censorship of the Party, and for the rest of his life was not allowed to travel, exhibit and publish. However even in his silence, he influenced a large number of artist both in Hungary and internationally. He died in Budapest on July 22, 1967.  Work  Kass√°k is considered to be the main father figure of the literary Hungarian Avant-garde, and one of the first poet/writer/artists from a working-class background. His views on historical avant-garde movements influenced the region's perception and artistic production. His journals Ma (\\"Today\\") and the Tett (\\"The Deed\\") were widely followed. He was heavily influenced by the international constructivist movement and issued several manifestos: K√©parchitekt√∫ra (\\"Image Architecture\\", 1922), Vissza a kaptaf√°hoz (\\"Back to the Basics\\", 1923), and A konstruktivizmusr√≥l (\\"On Constructivism\\", 1922). As he is associated with more than one style or movement, most art historians refer him as an \\"Activist\\", a special label issued to express the socially engaged style of his artistic production. Functionality and social effectivity were the main characteristics of his works, which have to be implemented by the modern being in order to create a world of social equality. His works include concrete poetry, billboards, design, novels, and paintings, and were influenced by Expressionism, Dadaism, Futurism, Surrealism and Constructivist tendencies. =K√©parchitekt√∫ra= K√©parchitekt√∫ra, or Image Architecture was first defined in pamphlet by Kass√°k in late 1921. The manifesto was reprinted in MA 7, no. 4 (March 1922), pp. 52‚Äì54.

V. Devan, Kanayi Kunhiraman, A. C. K. Raja, Namboothiri, K. P. Soman, M. K. K. Nair, C. N. Sreekantan Nair, M. K. Sanu, Pattathuvila Karunakaran, M. Thomas Mathew and T. Ramachandran. Three years later, he founded Chitrakoodam, the first privately-owned art gallery in Kerala but the initiative ran only for four years until 1977. He was also involved with Ochre, another private art gallery in Kochi. Subsequently, he focused his career mainly on painting and illustrations; Manorama Weekly, Kalakaumudi, Kerala Kaumudi Weekly, Malayalanadu, Chintha, Deshabhimani Weekly, Kumkumam, Mathrubhumi Weekly, Bhashaposhini and India Today were some of the publications he illustrated for. He also illustrated Lore and Legends of Kerala, the English translation of Aithihyamala, published by Oxford University Press. Karaunakaran as married to Easwari, and the couple had a son, Ayillyan and a daughter, Ammini. He died in Kochi on December 14, 2013, at the age of 73, succumbing to cardiac failure following a brief period of illness. The body was cremated at the Corporation of Cochin Ravipuram Crematorium. His son, Ayillyan Karunakaran, is an advertisement filmmaker.  Legacy  A drawing by C. N. Karunakaran One of the first assignments Karunakaran undertook after returning to Kerala from Chennai was the restoration of murals at Guruvayur temple. He participated in several exhibitions, both group and solo, at various places in India and abroad, including the Embassy of India in Washington, Asian Art Gallery, Virginia, Brazilian cities like Rio de Janeiro, Paraty, S√£o Paulo and Brasilia, Asian Art Gallery, Vienna and Kuwait. During his stay in Chennai, he was also involved with the Madras Design Demonstration Centre, a unit of the Government of Tamil Nadu where he assisted the centre in improving the handicrafts business and has illustrated a number of literary works in book form. Karaunakaran's debut in films was in 1978 when he designed the production of Ekakini, directed by G. S. Panicker. The next year, when K. R. Mohanan made his debut film, Ashwadhamavu, Karunakaran started his career as an art director, in which he also played a small part. He went on to work for four more films, Akkare (1984) of K. N. Sasidharan, Purushartham (1986) of K. R. Mohanan, Ore Thooval Pakshikal (1988) of Chintha Ravi and Alicinte Anveshanam (1989) of T. V. Chandran.  Awards and honours  His performance during his student years at the Government College of Fine Arts, Chennai earned him the gold medal of the Government of Madras for the best outgoing student in 1956. He received one more award before he returned to Kerala, the annual award of Madras Lalit Kala Akademi in 1964. He received the Kerala Lalithakala Akademi Award, thrice, twice in succession in 1971 and 1972 and later, in 1975. He was selected for the P. T. Bhaskara Panicker Award in 2000 and for the Malayattoor Ramakrishnan Award in 2003. The Kerala Lalithakala Akademi indicted him as a distinguished fellow in 2005; Akademi honoured him again in 2009, with Raja Ravi Varma Puraskaram, their highest award. Artist Sathypal, the former chairman of the Kerala Lalithakala Akademi, has published a book, Mythic Imagination: Art of C.N. Karunakaran, which covers Karaunakaran's work from 1950s to 2011.

He is best known for historical scenes and portraits. Biography He was born in Csetnek, and descended from an impoverished noble family originating in G√∂m√∂r √©s Kis-Hont County. His father, , was an iron manufacturer and craftsman. Originally, he was destined for a career in law and went to study in Pozsony.Brief biography (with a biography of his daughter, Adeline) @ Budapest XV District Blog. When the Hungarian Revolution began, he and his brother (also named Andr√°s) left school to join the struggle. He was a participant in numerous actions, became a Second Lieutenant and was present during the surrender at Vil√°gos. After hiding out briefly, he returned home on foot and joined his family in P√©cs. He continued with his legal studies, but also began taking lessons from a local artist. In 1853, he enrolled for preparatory work at the Academy of Fine Arts, Vienna. Two years later, he entered the history painting class of Ferdinand Georg Waldm√ºller.Brief biography @ Hungarian Visual Arts. His first historical painting, Kuruc and Labanc (depicting brothers fighting on opposite sides), was warmly received. In 1856, he went to Paris, where he studied in the studios of L√©on Cogniet and at the √âcole des Beaux Arts. He was also influenced by the style of Paul Delaroche. His painting The Mourning of L√°szl√≥ Hunyadi won a medal at the 1861 Salon. He returned to Hungary in 1870, but his style was heavily criticized for being too French, and revolutionary fervor had lessened considerably. In 1873, after especially harsh criticism of his work G√°bor Bethlen Among the Scholars, he retired from painting and took over his father's business. He was so discouraged that many of his best works were virtually given away. In 1902, his business went bankrupt and was sold at auction. The following year, he attempted to restart his artistic career by painting portraits, but they were not up to his previous standards. He died in Budapest, totally forgotten, during the First World War.

She was the mother of Emmett Till, who was murdered in Mississippi on August 28, 1955 at the age of 14, after allegedly offending a white cashier woman, Carolyn Bryant, at the grocery store. For her son's funeral in Chicago, Mamie Till insisted that the casket containing his body be left open, because, in her words, \\"I wanted the world to see what they did to my baby.\\"Recollection by Joyce Ladner of conversation with Till's mother, in the context of a Brookings Institution panel discussion on the Civil Rights Movement . Born in Mississippi, Till- Mobley moved with her parents to the Chicago area during the Great Migration. After her son's murder she became an educator and activist in the Civil Rights Movement. Early life Born Mamie Elizabeth Carthan on November 23, 1921, in Webb, Mississippi, Till-Mobley's family left the South during the period when millions of black Southerners migrated to the industrial North in the Great Migration to escape racial violence and Jim Crow laws. In 1922, shortly after her birth, her father, Nash Carthan, went ahead to Argo, Illinois, near Chicago. There, he found work at the Argo Corn Products Refining Company. Alma Carthan joined her husband in January 1924, bringing two-year-old Mamie and brother, John, with her. They settled in a predominantly black and close-knit neighborhood in Argo.https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/till/peopleevents/p_parents.html When Mamie was 13, her parents divorced. Devastated, she threw herself into her school work and excelled in her studies. Alma had high hopes for her only child, and although Alma Carthan said that in her day \\"the girls had one ambition -- to get married\\", she had encouraged Mamie in her studies. Even though very few of Mamie's peers even finished high school, Mamie was the first black student to make the \\"A\\" Honor roll and only the fourth black student to graduate from the predominantly white Argo Community High School. Aged 18, she met a young man from New Madrid, Missouri named Louis Till. He worked at the Argo Corn Company, was an amateur boxer, and was popular with women. Her parents disapproved, thinking the charismatic Till was \\"too sophisticated\\" for their daughter. At her mother's insistence, she broke off their courtship. But the persistent Till won out, and they married on October 14, 1940. Both were 18 years old. Their only child, Emmett Louis Till, was born 9 months later. They separated in 1942 after Mamie found out he had been unfaithful. Louis later choked her close to unconsciousness, to which she responded by throwing scalding water at him. Eventually, she obtained a restraining order against him. After violating this repeatedly, a judge forced him to choose between enlistment in the U.S. Army or jail time. Choosing the former, he joined the Army in 1943.Till-Mobley and Benson, pp. 14‚Äì17. In 1945, Mamie received notice from the War Department informing her, without a full explanation, that her husband had been killed during army service in Italy. She later said that she was only told that his death was due to \\"willful misconduct\\" and noted that bureaucracy had frustrated her attempts to learn anything more. In fact, Louis Till had been court-martialed on charges of the murder of an Italian woman and the rape of two others in Civitavecchia, in Italy. After a lengthy investigation, he was convicted and was executed by hanging near Pisa on July 2, 1945.Whitfield, p. 117.Houck and Grindy, pp. 134‚Äì135. But the details of Till's execution only fully emerged ten years later, after the murder of his son Emmett and the subsequent trial for that crime. By the early 1950s, Mamie and Emmett had moved to Chicago's South Side. Mamie met and married \\"Pink\\" Bradley, but they divorced two years later. Murder of Emmett Till In 1955, when Emmett was fourteen, his mother put him on the train to spend the summer visiting his cousins in Money, Mississippi. She never saw him alive again. Her son was abducted and brutally murdered on August 28, 1955, after being accused of interacting inappropriately with a white woman. The following month, Roy Bryant and his half-brother J.W. Milam faced trial for Till's kidnapping and murder but were acquitted by the all-white jury after a five-day trial and a 67-minute deliberation. One juror said, \\"If we hadn't stopped to drink pop, it wouldn't have taken that long.\\"Whitfield, pp. 41‚Äì42. Only months later, in an interview with Look magazine in 1956, protected against double jeopardy, Bryant and Milam admitted to killing Emmett Till.Whitfield, p. 52. For her son's funeral, Till insisted that the coffin containing his body be left open, because, in her words, \\"I wanted the world to see what they did to my baby.\\" Tens of thousands of people viewed Emmett's body, and photographs were circulated around the country. Through the constant attention it received, the Till case became emblematic of the disparity of justice for blacks in the South. The NAACP asked Mamie Till to tour the country relating the events of her son's life, death, and the trial of his murderers. It was one of the most successful fundraising campaigns the NAACP had ever known.Till-Mobley and Benson, pp. 191‚Äì196. Later life, education, and death Mamie Till graduated from Chicago Teachers College in 1960 (now Chicago State University, 1971). She remarried one last time, to Gene Mobley on June 24, 1957. She became a teacher, changed her surname to Till-Mobley, and continued her life as an activist working to educate people about what happened to her son. In 1976, she obtained a master's degree in administration at Loyola University Chicago. In 1992, Mamie Till-Mobley had the opportunity to listen while Roy Bryant was interviewed about his involvement in her son's murder. With Bryant unaware that Till-Mobley was listening, he asserted that Emmett Till had ruined his life. He expressed no remorse and stated, \\"Emmett Till is dead. I don't know why he can't just stay dead.\\"Till-Mobley and Benson, p. 261. Two years later, in 1994, Roy Bryant died of cancer, aged 63.FBI (2006), pp. 24‚Äì26. Mamie and Gene Mobley remained happily married until Gene's death from a stroke on March 18, 2000.Till-Mobley and Benson Mamie Till-Mobley died of heart failure in 2003, aged 81. The same year, her autobiography (written with Christoper Benson), Death of Innocence: The Story of the Hate Crime that Changed America, was published. Till-Mobley was buried near her son in Burr Oak Cemetery, where her monument reads, \\"Her pain united a nation\\".  Activism  Mamie's activism extended far beyond what she did in regards to her son's death. However, since her son's death became symbolic for many of the lynchings going on in the South during the mid-1950s, some history books only reference her in relation to him. Following Emmett's death she continued working as an activist. A large part of her work centered around education. She worked throughout her life to help children living in poverty. Her activism in this field alone lasted over 40 years. Specifically, she spent 23 years teaching in the Chicago public school system. She also established a group called \\"The Emmett Till Players,\\" which worked with school children outside of the classroom. The members learned and performed famous speeches by civil rights leaders like Martin Luther King Jr.. The group still performs to this day. She also spent a great deal of time contributing to knowledge production. She was frequently interviewed for documentary films and began working on a book which was later published after she died. Additionally, she was a very sought-after speaker. Mamie began holding speaking engagements soon after Emmett died. The NAACP even hired her to go on a speaking tour around the country and share what happened to Emmett to \\"overflowing crowds\\", making it one of the most successful fundraising tours in NAACP history. Despite the tour being a huge success, Mamie, and the NAACP quickly ended it due to a business dispute with executive secretary Roy Wilkins of the NAACP over payment for her being on tour. Even without the support of the NAACP, Mamie continued to be an influential speaker throughout her entire life. Mamie did speaking engagements as late as 2000. She flew down to the South and gave testimony at her son's murder trial on his behalf. At the time the case was prominent news and she utilized that publicity to speak about the violence of lynching. Ever since Emmett's death she had a close relationship with many African-American media outlets. These media organizations were relatively new at the time of Emmett's murder yet she was able to enlist their support in her cause. An important fixture of Mamie's activism was religion as she was a deeply religious person. Throughout her life she drew connections between what happened to Emmett and what happened to Christ. These connections helped to establish Emmett as a martyr figure. Mamie was able to use her role as a mother to relate to other people, and gain support for her cause of racial justice. A few years after Emmett's death, many female activists united around motherhood and defending children in a similar fashion. Women uniting around motherhood became a unifying force for other social movements like the Women's Movement in the 1960s and 1970s.  Memoir  Mamie Till coauthored with Christopher Benson her memoir Death of Innocence: The Story of the Hate Crime that Changed America, published by Random House in 2003, almost 50 years after the death of her son. Mamie Till's inspiration to write Death of Innocence came from the love for her son Emmett Till, the importance to herself to keep his story alive so that it could never happen again, and to bring to light just how racist white southerners were during those crucial times during the civil rights movement. She died just a few months before the final publication and release of her book. Whoopi Goldberg announced in 2015 plans for a movie called Till, based on Mamie Till's book and her play, The Face of Emmett Till.

Although his family wanted him to become an engineer, he studied at the Academy of Fine Arts, Vienna from 1851 to 1855, under Johann Nepomuk Geiger and Carl Rahl.Brief biography @ the Magyar √âletrajzi Lexikon. He then returned to his hometown where, for the next three years, he worked as an art teacher. After a year of employment with Count Aichelburg in Marschendorf, he married and moved to Munich, where he studied with Karl von Piloty. It was there that he first developed his interest in history painting. In 1862, he settled in Pest. The following year, he won a contest with his painting \\"The Escape of Emperor Charles VII\\" and used the prize money to finance a trip to the Netherlands and Paris, returning in 1864. He became one of the first teachers hired at the new \\"Hungarian Royal Drawing School\\" (now the Hungarian University of Fine Arts) in 1871 and served as its Director from 1902 to 1905, when he took over the master classes. From the 1860s through the 1880s, he mostly painted portraits and female figures, then turned to landscapes. He also created decorative murals in the Matthias Church, Budapest Opera House and the City Hall in Kecskem√©t.

He is a great-grandson of Henry Ford, founder of the Ford Motor Company. Background Alfred Ford's father was Walter B. Ford II (1920‚Äì1991), whose family were prominent in chemical manufacturing in the Downriver area south of Detroit. His mother, Josephine Clay Ford (1923‚Äì2005) was the daughter of Edsel Ford (1893‚Äì1943), who was the son of Henry Ford (1863‚Äì1947). The two Ford families were unrelated to each other; both his father and mother were born with the last name Ford. Alfred and William Clay Ford, Jr. (b. 1957), the current executive chairman of the Ford Motor Co., are first cousins. Alfred's mother was the sister of William Clay Ford, Sr. (1925‚Äì2014), William Clay Ford, Jr.'s father. Alfred Ford currently serves on the board of directors of privately held digital marketing firm ChannelNet, where he is also an investor. Ford Motor Company was one of ChannelNet's early clients. Association with ISKCON  He is an initiated disciple of A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada (Srila Prabhupada) since 1974. He first met Bhaktivedanta Swami in Dallas, USA. Alfred Ford joined the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (the Hare Krishnas) in 1975 and that same year he made his first trip to India with Prabhupada. He assisted in the establishment of the first Hindu temple in Hawaii and also donated $500,000 to help establish the Bhaktivedanta Cultural Center in Detroit which was completed in 1983. Alfred Ford has made many significant donations to ISKCON over the years which have assisted ongoing projects to build the Pushpa Samadhi Mandir of Prabhupada. He is the chairman of the Sri Mayapur Temple of the Vedic Planetarium (also called TOVP).

His most critically acclaimed film is It's For You! / ¬°Es para ti! (2004) premiered at the Malaga Film Festival in Spain and screened at international film festivals including Donostia-San Sebasti√°n, Barcelona, S√£o Paulo, and Montevideo. It's For You! / ¬°Es para ti! was described by Variety as a \\"A miniature techno fable about a twentysomething trying to keep a relationship alive through the healing power of the vidcam, writer-director Bruno Lazaro Pacheco's debut \\"It's for You!\\" seeks to describe a trip to the dark side of the soul. But pic works better as a straight-up take on a scruffy post-teen charmer going through a tough time\\". French film critic Rapha√´l Jullien called it \\"A simple and deeply moving masterpiece!\\" : \\"The feeling of authenticity is strengthened by a not inconsiderable part of improvisation ‚Äì palpable and well done ‚Äì that tends to compare the movie with John Cassavetes's work. \\"It's for you!\\" also seems to be a successful hybrid of theatre and cinema, an heir of a less pretentious and less eccentric underground cinema, and a declaration of love to... so many things! Bruno Lazaro Pacheco seems to enjoy an alternation of rhythms, laughs, tears... and sometimes a kind of contemplation with nearly abstract and purely aesthetic shots: plane tracks in the sky, graffiti...\\" His work often explores themes of cultural duality and questions the control of the individual by the state. \\"My parents were political activists and leaders of the movement against the fascist Franco dictatorship in Spain in the 1960s. This struggle and the clash of cultures at an early age have definitely influenced my work.\\" Bruno Lazaro. The narrative structure of his films tends towards non-linear, dream-like constructions where an impressionist portrayal of character and action provoke emotional connections to the viewer outside the usual realm of film plot tradition. In 1989, The Traveller was described as \\"Evokes the works of such masters of modernist existentialism as Andrei Tarkovsky and Wim Wenders.\\" Toronto International Film Festival Biography He completed his film studies at the Centre for the Arts at Simon Fraser University in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada where he studied with filmmakers Al Razutis and David Rimmer. In 1981, Bruno Lazaro was a founding member of Cineworks, an independent filmmakers' co-operative society in Vancouver where he began making short fiction, documentary and experimental films. His first feature, The Traveller (1989), had its premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival and participated in the presentation of Canadian Cinema at the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris, France. After moving to Toronto in the 1990s, he made a controversial sci-fi cult film City of Dark in 1997. In 2004 he released his first Canada-Spain co-production ¬°Es para ti! / It's For You! shot both in Toronto and Barcelona. Bruno Lazaro has been a guest programmer and jury member at international film festivals, and established the Festival of Canadian Cinema in Madrid showcasing independent Canadian films in Spain.

At the end of 2016, a total of 178 employees were working at the institute, including 48 scientists and 50 junior researchers. The Nobel Prize winner Hartmut Michel has been Director of the Institute since 1987. Scientific links to fellow researchers at Goethe University have been strengthened further as the institute is now situated next to the University's biology, chemistry and physics laboratories. Together with the Max Planck Institute for Brain Research and the Goethe University of Frankfurt am Main the institute run the International Max Planck Research School (IMPRS) for Structure and Function of Biological Membranes, a graduate program offering a Ph.D. in the period from 2000 until 2012.

Two of the four Departments are devoted to the challenging task of determining the structure of membrane proteins. Under the direction of Hartmut Michel (Nobel Prize in Chemistry of 1988 for the first structure determination of a membrane protein), the Department of Molecular Membrane Biology approaches this problem primarily by x-ray crystallography, whereas the Department of Structural Biology, headed by Werner K√ºhlbrandt, uses the complementary technique of electron microscopy. The Department of Biophysical Chemistry, directed by Ernst Bamberg, studies the function of these proteins in native or reconstituted membranes by electrophysiological and spectroscopic methods. Since 2013, the institute hosts the Department of Theoretical Biophysics, directed by Gerhard Hummer focusing on development and implementation of broad range of computational and theoretical methods to bridge fundamental physics, chemistry and biology of molecular systems. In the Department of Molecular Sociology integrative cellular structural biology is studied by cryo-electron microscopy, biochemical and mass spectroscopic methods applied to nuclear pores, macromolecular machines that are responsible for the communication between the cell nucleus and the cytoplasm.\\"Departments of the Institute\\". Website of MPI of Biophysics. Retrieved 30 April 2020. Institute's history The institute was founded in Frankfurt am Main as the \\"Kaiser Wilhelm Institute of Biophysics\\" in 1937. However, it had a predecessor, the \\"Institut f√ºr Physikalische Grundlagen der Medizin\\" which had been established in 1921 by Friedrich Dessauer, an admirer of Wilhelm R√∂ntgen, who endeavored to apply radiation physics to medicine and biology. Being a conservative member of parliament for the democratic \\"Zentrumspartei\\", Dessauer opposed the National Socialists' rise to power and was then forced to emigrate in 1934. His successor, Dessauer's colleague and long-standing collaborator, Boris Rajewsky was the first director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute of Biophysics. Rajewsky firstly coined the term \\"Biophysics\\" and consequently the institute became one of the first to be known by this name. Research has been conducted primarily on the effects of radioactive radiation on humans and possible medical use, as well as on aerosols.\\"A brief history of the Institute\\". Website of MPI of Biophysics. Retrieved 30 April 2020. After the Second World War, the institute was reopened in 1948 as the \\"Max Planck Institute of Biophysics\\". With the retirement of Boris Rajewsky in 1966 and the appointment of Reinhard Schl√∂gl in 1965, the research work was oriented away from work with radioactive radiation towards the investigation of \\"mass transport through biological and artificial membranes\\". With the subsequent appointment of Karl Julius Ullrich in 1967 and finally Hermann Passow in 1968 as new directors of the institute, the management of the Max Planck Institute of Biophysics also developed away from the classic one-director institute to a more modern board of directors. The main focus of research was (and still is) the investigation of the cell membrane and its building blocks, the membrane proteins (and especially the transport proteins). The cell membranes and the proteins were and are being investigated using the most modern physical methods available at the time, including \\\\- X-ray crystallography \\\\- high- resolution electron microscopy \\\\- Spectroscopy This development was initiated, especially after the retirement of Passow and Ullrich in 1993 and Schl√∂gl in 1996, by the appointment of a new generation of directors, in 1987 by Hartmut Michel (Dept. of Molecular Membrane Biology), in 1993 by Ernst Bamberg (Dept. of Biophysical Chemistry) and in 1996 by Werner K√ºhlbrandt (Dept. of Structural Biology).  Architecture  The functional new building of the MPIBP on the Riedberg university campus is divided into two halves by an entrance hall running continuously in an east-west direction. The laboratories and other research facilities of the institute are located in the northern half, while the offices and meeting rooms of the scientists and the administration are located in the southern half from the first floor onwards. For fast communication, the two halves are connected by bridges spanning the entrance hall. The architects of the new building were the Auer Weber Assoziierte GmbH in Stuttgart.\\"Architecture of the Institute\\". Website of Auer Weber Assoziierte GmbH . Retrieved 30 April 2020.  Miscellaneous  Since the founding of the MPI of Biophysics, one of the directors has also held a chair at Frankfurt's Goethe University. In cooperation with other MPIs (for Biochemistry, Medical Research, and Molecular Physiology) it operates its own beamline at the Swiss Light Source (SLS) in Switzerland, \\"one of the most modern and powerful \\"third generation\\" synchrotron radiation sources in Europe\\" (source), in order to avoid the normally long waiting times for a measurement. The sharply focused and intense synchrotron radiation (X-rays) is intended to enable, among other things, large protein complexes to be better investigated by X-ray structure analysis.

Life  He was descended from a noble family and his father was a postmaster, which resulted in frequent moves for the family. He displayed an early talent for art and his first lessons came from P√°l B√∂hm in Arad. Upon his father's request, he went to Vienna in 1864 to study law, but began preparatory studies at the Academy of Fine Arts and became a student of Albert Zimmermann in 1866. Three years later, he participated in a major exhibition in Munich, where he first came into contact with painters of the Barbizon school. In 1870, he and Eugen Jettel took a study trip to the Netherlands and, later that same year, he entered the Kunstakademie D√ºsseldorf on the recommendation of his boyhood friend, Mih√°ly Munk√°csy. This was followed by an invitation to London, made by a major art dealer there, and his discovery of the works of John Constable. After 1873, he married and lived at the Barbizon art colony,Fine Arts in Hungary: Brief Biography was a regular participant in the Salon and won a medal at the Exposition Universelle (1878). By this time, his health had noticeably deteriorated (possibly from tuberculosis) and he suffered an accident at home, which resulted in a serious brain injury.

It stood overlooking Spreewaldplatz in the Outer Luisenstadt, the eastern part of Kreuzberg but wartime bombing and Cold War tensions led to its closure and eventual demolition. The G√∂rlitzer Bahnhof (Berlin U-Bahn) station was named after this historic station and is located on a different site nearby. The rise The station was designed by August Orth, an architect later responsible for the Emmauskirche in nearby Lausitzer Platz, and built between 1865 and 1867 in the Palazzo style of the Italian Renaissance. It formed part of a railway expansion project that would link Berlin with Cottbus and G√∂rlitz, and then ultimately with cities such as Sagan (≈ªaga≈Ñ) and Breslau (Wroc≈Çaw) (both in Poland since 1945) and Vienna in Austria. On 13 June 1866 a military train bound for the Austro-Prussian war became the first train to leave the then incomplete station site. The connection was one of convenience because the military had built their barracks in neighbouring Wrangelstra√üe. Shortly afterwards, on 13 September, a regular passenger service began between Berlin and Cottbus. By late 1867 the Berlin-G√∂rlitz line was complete and the route, which passed through the countryside of the Spreewald and the Lower Lusatia and the towns of K√∂nigs Wusterhausen, L√ºbben and L√ºbbenau, officially opened on 31 December 1867. Although founded by a private company, owned by industrialist and \\"rail king\\" Bethel Henry Strousberg, the service was nationalised on 28 March 1882. The new line proved an immediate success with the public. After only a few months, it was accommodating 70,000 travellers a day and during the whole of 1880, approximately 1,5 million people used G√∂rlitzer Bahnhof. Its popularity had a stimulating effect on the surrounding area, with shops and caf√©s springing up in the neighbouring streets, helping to establish it as one of the liveliest in the city. Aside from the transport of people, the line also served as a vital trade route connecting the capital with the cloth factories, and the brick and glass works of industrial G√∂rlitz. Lausitz proved to be not only a rich source of Spreewald gherkins but also, more importantly, of coal. A section of the 1902 Pharus Plan of Berlin showing G√∂rlitzer Bahnhof and the eastern Kreuzberg environs =G√∂rlitzer Tunnel= In order to improve access between the neighbourhoods that emerged around G√∂rlitzer Stra√üe (the Wrangelkiez) and Wiener Stra√üe (the Reichenberger Kiez), an underpass was constructed under the railway site. Opened to the public in 1910, this connected Oppelner Stra√üe on the northern side with Liegnitzer Stra√üe to the south.Berliner-unterwelten.de Berliner Unterwelten e.V. This was officially known as the ‚ÄòG√∂rlitzer Tunnel‚Äô, although it would later also acquire the nickname \\"Harnr√∂hre‚Äú (Urethra). The fall During World War II, the Allied aerial bombardments of 3 February 1945, that left 3,255 dead or missing and over 119,000 homeless in the surrounding Kreuzberg district, meted out severe damage to the station. Nevertheless, by June, a mere month after the surrender of Berlin, a makeshift G√∂rlitzer Bahnhof was back in service.\\"History of G√∂rlitzer Bahnhof\\" , www.goerlitzer-bahnhof.de (German) The revival proved temporary however. From 25 September 1946 all its long distance trains were redirected to Schlesischer Bahnhof (renamed Ostbahnhof in 1950) on the central Stadtbahn. Furthermore, over the next few years the ongoing expansion of the electric S-Bahn system would supersede its role in the local network too. Ultimately though, it was the deepening crisis in political relations between East and West that sealed the station's fate, and made its position as a Western station operating an Eastern line untenable. It therefore came as no surprise when the GDR decided to close G√∂rlitzer Bahnhof to passenger trains on 29 April 1951. Although the complete absence of the railway on the 1954 Berlin city map suggests the station was subsequently demolished and cleared, it actually remained relatively undisturbed in its bombed-out state for ten years after the closure. The arrival of the Wall in 1961, however, quashed any hopes of a reconstruction. Over the following decade or so all the remaining station buildings were demolished, beginning with the large platform hall in 1962 and the main reception area in 1967. The remaining public buildings ‚Äì which were substantial enough to include two towers, various waiting rooms and a restaurant ‚Äì were levelled in 1975 during a wave of city clear up during the 70s that claimed many historic victims across the city. At the time the reasons for demolition was given that the buildings served no practical purpose in standing empty and as a result were being occupied by an ‚Äúanti- social‚Äù element. The removal of these ‚Äúruins‚Äù would therefore be better for the image of West Berlin.Kreuzberger-chronik.de By 1976 the site lay mostly empty.  Continuing use of G√∂rlitzer Bahnhof after closure Although the station stood abandoned and the site lay undeveloped for over thirty years, the area was never dormant. Since the closure in 1951, the land and buildings were used variously for coal storage, as a scrapyard, an auto garage, and for other small enterprises. Furthermore, the northern goods side of the station site remained in active use by the Deutsche Reichsbahn for transporting freight between West and East Berlin, and for this reason a border crossing point stood on the bridge over the Landwehrkanal. This passage of freight was permanently discontinued on 30 June 1985. Between the years 1984-87 a local swimming baths, the Spreewald Bad, an innovative structure designed by Christoph Langhof architects, was built on the site of the former station. Before the remaining area from Skalitzer Stra√üe up to the G√∂rlitzer Ufer was developed into G√∂rlitzer Park in the early 1990s,Morgenpost.de Berliner Morgenpost, 29. April 2007 (German) it was a waste ground partly accessible by the public. This vacancy led to the site being occupied during the summer of 1989 by the Mutoid Waste Company, an anarchist art commune from London. The location was chosen in part because of its proximity to the Wall. On one memorable occasion the scrap metal artists created a \\"Peace Bird\\" contraption which featured a bird suspended high in the air which was able to roll along the railway tracks to the border point on the bridge and, in a gesture of peace towards the GDR, exhibit the bird to those in the east.Mutoid Waste Company im Sommer 1989 in West Berlin Tip, 21. Aug 2009 (German) Although the G√∂rlitzer Tunnel remained in use until the beginning of the 90s, the public access to the site prompted by the new park left it redundant. In the creation of a ‚Äònatural‚Äô arena in the centre of the park the tunnel was destroyed, although not completely with its remains incorporated into the design.  The remains  The remaining office building and one of the goods sheds. The only obvious physical remains of the station site are the two goods sheds, an old office building, the railway bridge and the remnants of the underpass visible in a crater in the centre of the park. Nevertheless, it is possible to follow part of the old railway route on foot, as it leads out of the park, over the Landwehrkanal and then comes to an end over Elsenstra√üe in Treptow, just before the original line would have met the ring of the S-bahn. The historic building itself lives on in existing local names. In 1926 the local U-Bahn station Oranienstra√üe was renamed as G√∂rlitzer Bahnhof to indicate the neighbouring mainline terminus but despite the latter's demise the U-bahn stop maintains the historical name, much like with the similarly doomed Anhalter Bahnhof. In addition to this, the road that runs alongside the western side of G√∂rlitzer Park, was renamed Wiener Stra√üe in 1873 because the first trains connecting Berlin and the Austrian capital Wien (Vienna) left from G√∂rlitzer Bahnhof. Likewise, the neighbouring squares Spreewaldplatz and Lausitzer Platz were named after the areas of countryside once accessible from its platforms.

But it is clear that he knows next to nothing about farming, and that black workers run it ‚Äì Mehring is simply an outsider, an intruder on the daily life of \\"his\\" farm. His objective in buying the farm is to make a tax deductible expense. \\"No farm is beautiful unless it's productive,\\" says Mehring. Plus it is proper for his amorous escapades. Land was a thing of his race. He once visits his farm with his girlfriend, Antonia. One day the black foreman, Jacobus, finds an unidentified dead body on the farm. Since the dead man is black, the police find no urgency to look into the case and simply bury the body on the spot where it was found. The idea of an unknown black man buried on his land begins to \\"haunt\\" Mehring. A flood brings the body back to the surface; although the farm workers do not know the stranger, they now give him a proper burial as if he were a family member. There are hints that Mehring's own burial will be less emotional than this burial of a stranger. Theme Political and resurrection themes are combined to convey a larger meaning. The sterility of white has been depicted in Mehring's attempts of keeping his farm. He tries to conserve both nature and apartheid, while nature fails him and doesn't return what he had given to it. The dead body laying claim to his land is the embodiment of Africa, having no land of its own while in fact possessing all of Africa. Characters =Mehring= He is the protagonist, an antihero of the novel. In his middle age, he is an attractive figure and has already had a number of mistresses. He is a frequent traveller and a calculating businessman. =Antonia Mancebo= She is the mistress of Mehring with olive complexion and dark hair. She is a revolutionary activist and has often a brush with law. She has to leave Africa as her life is in danger. =Terry= Son of Mehring who has left him long ago. =Jacobus= Works as a foreman at Mehring's farm. He breaks the news of the dead body to Mehring.

After starting his career with the Philadelphia Phillies, Oeschger was traded to the New York Giants. He was soon traded to the Boston Braves, where he pitched his best seasons. Oeschger is best known for holding the MLB record for the most innings pitched in a single game (26). In 1920, both Oeschger and Leon Cadore of the Brooklyn Robins pitched 26 innings for their respective teams in a game that was eventually called a tie due to darkness.The day the pitchers went 26 innings.

He played out the rest of his career for the New York Giants before retiring in San Francisco. Never appearing in a World Series over his career he had 83 wins and 116 defeats. In San Francisco he was a teacher for the San Francisco Board of Education for 27 years.  Early life  Oeschger was born in Chicago, one of six children of immigrants from Switzerland. In 1900 his family moved to Ferndale, California, where Joe's father bought of land and established a dairy ranch. Joe and his three brothers all attended Ferndale High School, where they played baseball. After high school, Joe attended and played baseball at Saint Mary's College of California, graduating in 1914.Lynwood Carranco (1980), Joe Oeschger Remembers, Society for American Baseball Research ‚Äì Research Journal Archive  Major league career  Oeschger began his career with the Philadelphia Phillies in the 1914 season. He won four games, while losing eight and posting a 3.77 earned run average for the Phillies. He pitched in a handful of games for the 1915 and 1916 seasons, before becoming a full-time starter in 1917. That season he had 15 wins against 14 losses and a 2.75 earned run average. Oeschger then led the league in losses during the 1918 season with 18, but still had a good earned run average of 3.03. One of the few highlights of his season was his shutout against the Brooklyn Robins on April 22. He also was tied for the league lead in saves, with three. On May 27, 1919 Oeschger was traded from the Phillies to the New York Giants for Ed Sicking and George Smith. He only pitched in five games for the Giants before being included in a trade to Boston for Art Nehf. = Longest game = A baseball field is named for him in Ferndale, California. The plaque commemorates the longest game of baseball ever played. On May 1, 1920 the Brooklyn Robins went to play the Boston Braves at Boston, in front of a crowd of 2,000 spectators. Leon Cadore was starting for the Robins. The game was held scoreless until the top of the fifth inning, when Ernie Krueger scored on Ivy Olson run batted in single. The game was tied in the sixth when Walton Cruise tripled, then scored on Tony Boeckel single. The game was ruled as a tie after 26 innings because of darkness. Oescheger only gave up 9 hits the entire game, while Cadore allowed 15. Oeschger had one hit in nine trips to the plate. It was a double. If they had played one more inning the pitchers would have played the equivalent of three games. For the rest of the 1920 season Oescheger won 15 games with a 3.46 earned run average.  Later career  On September 8, 1921, Oeschger struck out three batters on nine pitches in the fourth inning of an 8‚Äì6 loss to the Philadelphia Phillies. Oeschger became the fourth National League pitcher and the fifth pitcher in Major League history to throw an immaculate inning. He had his only 20-win season that year, which finished third in the National League. He also had a lack of control, leading the league in walks with 97, and hit by pitches with 10. Oeschger collapsed the next two seasons, having a combined total of 36 losses with only 11 wins, and an earned run average over 5. On November 11, 1923, Oeschger with Billy Southworth was traded from Boston to the New York Giants for Dave Bancroft and Casey Stengel Over his career he had 83 wins and 116 defeats and he never appeared in a World Series. Later life Oeschger later retired to San Francisco, where he taught physical education for the San Francisco Board of Education for 27 years. He was invited to throw out the first pitch of game one of the 1983 World Series that pitted the Philadelphia Phillies against the Baltimore Orioles. He died in Rohnert Park, California at age 94.

During the following night these ships removed 4,000 troops from Crete. Between December 1942 and April 1943 Abdiel, in cooperation with the minelaying submarine and Abdiels sister ship , laid several minefields with about 2,000 mines in the Strait of Sicily. On 9 January 1943, after Abdiel laid a minefield across the Axis evacuation route from Tunisia,the escort of an Italian convoy ran into it and the destroyer (1,645 tons) was sunk, while the destroyer (1,440 tons) was severely damaged. On 3 February 1943 another Italian convoy's escort fouled another of her minefields south of Marettimo island, off the western tip of Sicily, losing the destroyer (1,225 tons) and the torpedo boat (910 tons). On 8 March 1943, Abdiel again laid a minefield on the Axis evacuation route, north of Cap Bon, Tunisia. On 24 March a convoy entered the field, and the Italian destroyers (1,645 tons) and (2,125 tons) were lost.

The mines had been laid just a few hours earlier by two German torpedo boats (S-54 and S-61), as they left the harbour. Abdiel, carrying troops of the British 1st Airborne Division (6th (Royal Welch) Parachute Battalion and 204 (Oban) Anti-Tank Battery, Royal Artillery204L A/T Bty at Paradata website.), took the berth which had been declined earlier by the captain of the US cruiser . Shortly after midnight, two mines detonated beneath Abdiel and the minelayer sank in three minutes, with great loss of life among both sailors and soldiers. The 1st Airborne Division lost 58 dead and around 150 injured and 48 crew were lost.

The proliferation of base communities is due in part to the documents of the Second Vatican Council which called for the Catholic laity to take a more active role in the church, and also from the shortage of priests. They spread to Africa, and then to Asia where some have morphed into models for neighborliness in modern urban and ecumenical environments, with the hope that Christian renewal at the peripheries will impact cultural centers. Latin America In the 1960s Basic Ecclesial Communities (BEC) spread rapidly, encouraged by the emphasis which the Catholic bishops at the Second Vatican Council and at the Latin American Medellin Conference gave to more active engagement of the laity in living the gospel imperatives. BECs realize the presence of the church in all its aspects, as communion, servant, herald, sacrament, and institution. They present a pattern of Christian life which is less individualistic, self- interested, and competitive, as preferred by the poor in mutual support and co-responsibility. Due to a shortage of priests, the sacraments are not always accessible in some of these communities but for them the word of God is an \\"immediate point of reference, the source of inspiration, nourishment, and discernment, ... to shape a just society that will turn the word into reality and embody the gospel project in a coherent way, ... conscious of the gift given to us in Jesus Christ.\\"Marcello de C.Azevedo, \\"Bacis Ecclesial Communities: A Meeting Point of Ecclesiologies\\", Theological Studies 46, no. 4 (1985): 601-16. http://cdn.theologicalstudies.net/46/46.4/46.4.1.pdf. BECs were not a product of liberation theology; they existed before it arose, and have thrived despite some Vatican reaction against the liberation theology movement. The liberationists built upon the BEC movement, giving it a more explicitly social edge. Peruvian theologian Gustavo Guti√©rrez, who coined the term ‚Äúliberation theology‚Äù, once said that ninety percent of the movement is the preferential option for the poor. The Latin American bishops, following up on their 1968 statement at Medellin which called for an ‚Äúeffective preference to the needy and poorest sectors‚Äù of society, issued in 1979 at Puebla a document entitled ‚ÄúA Preferential Option for the Poor‚Äù. Then in 2007, with Pentecostal and Evangelical movements threatening the faith of Catholics within the impoverished peripheries of Latin America‚Äôs mega-cities, these bishops at the Fifth Episcopal Conference of Latin America and the Caribbean (\\"Council of Aparecida\\") embraced the base communities as a pastoral model. A decline in base communities in some parts of Latin America has been attributed to Pope John Paul II's appointment of more conservative bishops and his difficulty in understanding the complexities of liberation theology.A Commitment to Neighborhood. The Argentine-born Pope Francis‚Äôs message \\"often has stood in marked contrast to the words of his two predecessors. Francis has in fact sought to revive liberation theology in its pastoral application ‚Äì ... what theologians call 'base community' work in the region‚Äôs slums and marginalized areas.\\" He has averaged a trip a year to Latin America during his papacy. Speaking from his experience in Latin America, Francis has highly extolled \\"popular movements\\", which demonstrate the ‚Äústrength of us‚Äù and serve as a remedy to the ‚Äúculture of the self‚Äù. He sees such movements as an \\"antidote to populism\\" and as capable of revitalizing democracies which he finds \\"increasingly limp, threatened, and under scrutiny over countless factors.\\" The communities have received strong endorsement from the Catholic hierarchy, beginning with the Latin American bishops at Medellin in the wake of Vatican II, who strove \\"to encourage and favor the efforts of the people to create and develop their own grassroots organizations for the redress and consolidation of their rights and the search for true justice.\\" In 2016, the bishops' committee for the accompaniment of base ecclesial communities on the continent issued the statement: \\"In this ecclesial spring, aroused by the gestures and doctrine of Pope Francis, the communities have been strengthened and renewed in their evangelizing and missionary enthusiasm. We reaffirm our conviction that the communities are the Church of Jesus at the base, the poor and poor Church.\\" One example of the need for these communities would be Guatemala where a single parish among the native Mayans has 100,000 members in 53 distinct communities served by 3,000 lay ministers. The diocesan bishop here is √Ålvaro Leonel Ramazzini Imeri who was made a cardinal by Pope Francis in the 5 October 2019 consistory. The cardinal has long been an advocate for the poor, and has survived several death threats. =Brazil= The Brazilian Paulo Freire's classic work Pedagogy of the Oppressed increased literacy and raised the awareness of human rights. This furthered the BEC movement and \\"provided a springboard for Liberation theologians, most of whom were inspired by the theological insights they learnt from the struggles of poor communities.\\" Brazil has had members of the Catholic clergy who gained an international reputation as defenders of the poor, such as Archbishop H√©lder C√¢mara, Cardinal Paulo Evaristo Arns, Cardinal Alo√≠sio Lorscheider, and Leonardo Boff. BECs have afforded protection for social activists, as in the Amazon region where land seizures are a contentious issue.R. Pace (1992), \\"Social conflict and political activism in the Brazilian Amazon: a case study of Gurup√°\\". American Ethnologist, 19: 710‚Äì732. doi: 10.1525/ae.1992.19.4.02a00050 The Message of Pope Francis to the Participants in the 13th Meeting of the Basic Ecclesial Communities in Brazil, in January 2014, declared that \\"the motto of this meeting, 'BECs Pilgrims of the Kingdom, in the Countryside and the City', must resound like a call so that they might increasingly assume their very important role in the Church‚Äôs mission of evangelization.\\" Quoting the Document of Aparecida, Francis stated that BECs allow people ‚Äúto attain greater knowledge of the Word of God, a greater social commitment in the name of the Gospel, for the birth of new forms of lay service and adult education in the faith.‚Äù He had chaired the committee that drafted the Aparecida document. Francis also recalled his more recent statement to the whole church, that base communities ‚Äúbring a new evangelizing fervor and a new capacity for dialogue with the world whereby the Church is renewed.‚Äù =Violent opposition= The Roosevelt Corollary to the Monroe Doctrine (1904) established a pattern of the United States imposing a capitalist model of development on Latin America, often to the detriment of the poorest peoples. \\"In Brazil and Central America, as U.S.-endorsed dictatorships made it increasingly dangerous for workers to gather, organize, and/or protest while their living conditions worsened, the sacred space of religious meetings often became the only environments left where workers could still somewhat safely convene, organize, share information, and plan protests,\\" while finding vital support and healing. However, \\"hundreds of thousands of defenseless BEC members were killed by state-sponsored, U.S.-trained and supported military, paramilitary, and police forces in no less than ten Latin American countries,\\" including missionaries from the United States, local pastors, and a bishop.http://www.derechos.org/nizkor/salvador/informes/truth.html UN Truth Commission on El Salvador. Worldwide =Africa= Many authors have pointed out the \\"sacramental service station\\" model of church established by colonialism, contrary to the African cultural preference for close, participatory community. When The Association of Member Episcopal Conferences in Eastern Africa (AMECEA) Documentation Service \\"circulated a questionnaire in 1975 to ascertain how the dioceses ranked their priorities they were pleased to find that the highest priority in AMECEA was ‚Äòbuilding Christian communities‚Äô.\\" Then in 1994 at the first African Synod, the Bishops Conference in Africa described Small Christian Communities (SCC) as \\"the theological mainstay of the model of Church as Family of God\\". They are seen as \\"the ecclesiastical extension of the African extended family or clan\\", where the Christian faith is more intensely lived and shared.L. Magesa, Anatomy of Inculturation, Transforming the Church in Africa, (New York: Orbis, 2014), 43. See also: G. Cieslikiewicz, Pastoral Involvement of Parish-Based SCCs in Dar es Salaam, in J. Healey and J. Hinton, Small Christian Communities Today, (New York: Orbis, 2005), 101. In Africa's patriarchal culture, the challenge is to attract more men to these communities and still have the voice of women heard in them. \\"Due to the emergence and growth of SCCs, the church is no longer considered a remote reality subject solely to the direction of the ordained clergy. ...Women and men feel a sense of belonging, celebrate their shared faith and take responsibility for the mission of the church in the local context.\\" Already in 2001 there were over 180,000 SCCs in the nine AMECEA countries in Eastern Africa. A leading African theologian has suggested that they can still learn from Latin America \\"to include attention to the socio- political, ecological and economic conditions of their context.\\"Agbonkhianmeghe E. Orobator, Marquette U. publication. =Asia= At their assembly in Bandung, Indonesia, in 1990, the Federation of Asian Bishops' Conferences endorsed the promotion of Small Christian Communities (SCC) throughout Asia.as a new way of being church, as a \\"communion of communities\\" ‚Äì participatory, ecumenical, and a leaven for the transformation of the world.FABC V Plenary Assembly Final Statement ‚ÄòJourneying Together Toward the Third Millennium‚Äô July 17-27 1990 Bandung, Indonesia 8.1.11. Then in 1999 after the meeting of the Asian Synod of Bishops in New Delhi, Pope John Paul II wrote in his apostolic exhortation Ecclesia in Asia that \\"the Synod Fathers underlined the value of basic ecclesial communities as an effective way of promoting communion and participation in parishes and Dioceses, and as a genuine force for evangelization. These small groups help the faithful to live as believing, praying and loving communities like the early Christians (cf. Acts 2:44-47; 4:32-35).\\" John Paul II went on to describe them as \\"a solid starting point for building a new society, the expression of a civilization of love, ... and I encourage the Church in Asia, where possible, to consider these basic communities as a positive feature of the Church's evangelizing activity.\\" The diversity of religions and the small number of Christians in most parts of Asia have also led to experiments in forming local Basic Human Communities (BHC) open to people of all faiths. From these it is hoped that the new humanity will emerge, with small communities at the periphery feeding back to transform the center into the likeness of one world under God. =Philippines= In the Philippines, the formation of BECs has been adopted as the pastoral priority of the Church throughout the country. In 1991, the Second Plenary Council of the Philippines decreed: \\"Basic Ecclesial Communities under various names and forms ‚Äì BCCs, small Christian communities, covenant communities ‚Äì must be vigorously promoted for the full living of the Christian vocation in both urban and rural areas.\\" The Council directed the Catholic Bishops' Conference of the Philippines (CBCP) to \\"issue an official statement on BECs, on their nature and functions as recognized by the Church, making it clear that they are not simply another organization. This official statement of the CBCP shall be, among other things, for the proper orienting of priests and seminarians. Training for work with BECs shall be made part of seminary formation.\\" Catholic Bishops' Conference of the Philippines (1991), \\"Acts and Decrees of the Second Plenary Council of the Philippines (PCP II)\\", Makati: CBCP. In 2007, the CBCP established the Episcopal Committee on Basic Ecclesial Communities with the task of assisting the dioceses in the promotion and formation of BECs. The small Christian communities in the Philippines often began as administrative or liturgical centers for the parishes, and have needed to evolve into consciousness-raising communities more like the Latin American model.Quevedo O. (2008) ‚ÄòRenewing the Church: Pastoral Thrusts for BECs‚Äô In: Arquiza Y. (ed) Creating a Culture of Sustainability for BECs. Manila: CBCP-BEC Desk. 195-196. =India= The 1980 Bombay Priests Synod recognized SCCs as necessary to build community in city parishes characterized by individualism, impersonal relationships, superficial religious practice, and unconcern for others. \\"Believers were defined by the doctrinal truths they adhered to\\" with a privatized Christianity that ignored the social and communitarian dimensions of being disciples of Jesus Christ. The sense of community experienced at Sunday Mass was found to be too superficial to realize the sense of Christian community.Bombay Priests Synod Document 138, quoted in A. Nazareth, Handbook of Small Christian Communities for the Archdiocese of Bombay, (Mumbai, India: FILMC, 2003), 1. From 1984 to 2006, virtually the whole Bombay archdiocese was formed into 1,800 SCCs. The program involved bringing together Catholics in neighborhood communities for Gospel sharing and service to the poor and needy, while maintaining links with the universal Church. Experience led to dividing SCCs into smaller clusters of about ten families, to facilitate presence and participation at the monthly meetings. =Western world= It has been suggested that to revitalize the Church in the Western world, neighborhood communities should become places where the Bible is reflected upon and applied, the faith shared and celebrated, in a more democratic rather than hierarchical structure. Priest and bishop become enablers, encouraging full missionary discipleship among the laity, overseeing from a distance rather than accustomed to control. The question which the clergy in the North must answer is what model of church best responds to the needs and expectations of the secular society. A program that originated in the United States, now RENEW International, offers materials and training for parish-based discussion groups. Their programs have reached an estimated 25 million Catholics in 160 dioceses in the United States, Canada, South Africa, Australia, Venezuela, El Salvador, and Guatemala. Since 2007 it has sponsored the program Theology on Tap which involves young adults in faith discussions held in restaurants and taverns. RENEW International has a strong presence in England and in Africa. A similar effort originating in Italy in 1987 now involves thousands of people on five continents. Pope Francis has commended these cells for their ability to revive parishes, adding that: ‚ÄúIf we have encountered Christ in our lives, then we cannot keep him only for ourselves. It is crucial that we share this experience with others as well.\\"  See also  *Cell group *Conventicle References External links *Small Christian Communities, pp. 97-109. *Basic Ecclesial Communities: Adelaide's 'new model of church'. *Committee on Basic Ecclesial Communities of the Catholic Bishops' Conference of the Philippines.

The club currently has seven men's and three women's teams participating in the Kingdom of Fife AFA and the BUCS Leagues while also boasting two developmental teams. History =Senior/amateur Saturday football= The club fully affiliated to the Scottish Football Association (SFA) in 1907, playing senior football until it allowed its membership to lapse in 1939. Since then the university teams have been playing in the local Amateur league. In the early 20th century the four 'Ancient' Universities (Aberdeen, Edinburgh, Glasgow and St. Andrews) were given a bye into the 3rd qualifying round of the Scottish Cup. St. Andrews debuted in 1907 against the Vale of Atholl in front of 1000 spectators at University Park. The club have appeared in the Scottish Cup proper on three occasions losing 10‚Äì1 to Cowdenbeath in 1923, 3‚Äì;0 at home to Bathgate in 1929 and 6‚Äì1 away to Nithsdale Wanderers in 1930. There are no records of the club's exploits in the Scottish Amateur Cup, but the university side have won the Fife Amateur Cup on three occasions ‚Äì1934-35, 1957-58, and more recently in 2018-2019. A second XI can be traced back to the 1923‚Äì24 season, but it is unknown exactly when the club first entered a second team into the Fife Amateur League. However, when they did so it was under the moniker 'United Colleges' in reference to the amalgamation of St Leonard's and St Salvator's Colleges' in 1747. The club have spent most of their time in Divisions 1 and 2. Their most successful season to date was 2003‚Äì04 where they were 'promoted' to division 1 via a restructuring of the league and they won the Division 2 Cup, defeating Inverkeithing Swifts in the final 2‚Äì1. The club entered a third team into the Saturday Amateur League for the first time in 2005, under the banner of St. Andrews Academicals. After two disappointing seasons, the club decided to stop fielding Academicals in the Fife League. The university currently play in the Fife Premier Division while the United Colleges have been disbanded. =Inter-university competition= The club competed against the four Ancients in 'Friendly' competition from their formation in 1887 until the introduction of the Queen's Park Shield (QPS) competition in 1921. The First XI have won the competition four times with the last being in the 2017-2018 season. The format of the QPS changed a number of times over the years, but settled finally in the late 1990s when BUCS took over the co- ordination of Scottish University Football from the now defunct SUSF. The Shield is now awarded to the winner of the Scottish 1A Conference, which for the last four years has been won by Heriot-Watt. St Andrews 1st XI have, since the late nineties, been in Scottish Conference 2A suffering many years of frustration and near misses in their quest for promotion. This all changed in 2005 when the team won the Conference and promotion into the top division. On top of that the team qualified for the BUSA Trophy, a British University knock-out competition, for the first time. After defeating the University of Central Lancashire in the last 16 and University of York. St. John in the quarter-finals, the team were very unfortunate to lose to DeMontford University on penalties, in a game that was watched by over 150 at University Park. The United Colleges (2nd XI) are also believed to have competed in friendlies up until the advent of the SUSF Paterson trophy in 1973‚Äì74. In 2002 the Colleges came close to winning the Trophy and entry to BUSA plate but were lost the league by 1 point to Stirling University. With the advent of integrated leagues (all 1st, 2nd and 3rd XI play in the same league and can be promoted/relegated to any division) in BUSA competitions in 2004, the Paterson Trophy disappeared. Since 2002 the team have suffered a couple of relegations and are fighting for promotion from Scottish 5a. The Academicals (3rd XI) entered the Colts trophy at its inception in 1979‚Äì80. The team have never won the competition, but came close in 1999‚Äì2000 and 2000‚Äì01. The majority of players from these years went on to play for the first XI. In fact the team of 2000‚Äì01 defeated the United Colleges by 4‚Äì1 in a highly contested 'friendly' match. The team are currently holding their own in BUSA Scottish Conference 5b. SUSF did organise an indoor five-a-side tournament and a Freshers' tournament. The inaugural tournament of the former was won by Edinburgh in 1975‚Äì76, but St. Andrews have won it three times since then in 1977‚Äì78, 1981‚Äì82 and 1985‚Äì86. The competition stopped running in the mid-1990s for reasons unknown. The Freshers' Tournament was first contested in 1984‚Äì85 and has been dominated by Edinburgh University since its inception. Saints finally lifted the trophy in 1999‚Äì2000 winning every game in the regional competition in St Andrews and the finals in Edinburgh. Most of the 'Golden Generation' went on to pick up University Colours later in their Saints careers. With increased games in the BUSA leagues and each University putting more and more teams into the Amateur Leagues, the competition came to an end in 2003‚Äì04. =Kits= Management Since the club has an ever-changing roster of Office Bearers and limited resources, it has been difficult to attract coaches of a high quality on a regular basis. In the late 1980s, Andy Law, a barman from the Central Bar on Market Street, volunteered to coach the First XI, providing much needed objectivity from the sidelines. In the mid-1990s, rector Donald Findlay helped to provide coaching on a sporadic basis from Rangers But with the Q.C's resignation as rector came the end of the tie-up. In between times, all three squads have relied on the team captains to take training and pick the team. During the 1997‚Äì98 season, the then AU president and 1st XI left- back, Thomas Finbar Patrick William Doyle, drafted in Eric Walker to help first team captain Ross Gilder, whose form was suffering as a result of the dual strains of team selection and his ever increasing waistline. Walker's arrival, a former Scottish Amateur Cup winner (sporting discipline unknown), looked like it would herald a new era of total football within the club. However, the new managerial duo only ever really hit it off during happy hour which led to both departing (Gilder to The Kinnes Fry Bar and Walker to Bell's distillery) shortly after. In 2002 the first team took the unprecedented step of 'employing' a coach to take training and attend matches, but with team selection remaining with the captain. Gary Cardle coached the team to varying success before 'losing the dressing room' in the 2003‚Äì04 season. He moved on to Cowdenbeath Youth team and Heriot-Watt 2nd XI respectively. The reigns were immediately taken up voluntarily by Peter Henry, father of 1st team player Pete Henry Jr. His effect was immediate, with the players galvanised, the team finished mid-table in the Fife Amateur Premier League and second in the BUSA Scottish 2a Conference in his first season. The 1st XI were to enjoy a period of success unrivaled in modern times under Henry, as in his second season the team marched to League victory in the BUSA Scottish 2a Conference and the semi-finals of the BUSA Trophy in 2006. Henry left the club with immediate effect after the 2006 committee election, spelling the end of an era for the 1st XI. Without a manager the team's standards slipped in the Fife League and they were eventually relegated. Happily, however, the university agreed a deal in July 2006 with Dundee United allowing the professional Club to train on the university grounds in return for professional coaching for all three University teams. In January 2011 Stuart Milne was hired as director of football at the university, being given the responsibility to improve the results and stature of all the university sides. Since then the 1st XI have been promoted in both the BUCS League and Fife Amateur League, while a fourth XI has also been created.

They are usually dome-shaped or cone-shaped and can range in size from having very wide brims to being almost helmet-like. They are made from various materials including bamboo, rattan, nito ferns, and bottle gourd. The tip of the crown commonly has a spiked or knobbed finial made of metal or wood. It is held in place by an inner headband and a chinstrap. Salakot is also spelled as salacot in Spanish and salacco in French. It is the direct precursor to the pith helmet (also called salacot in Spanish and French) widely used by European military forces in the colonial era. Description Salakot is a general term for a range of related traditional headgear used by virtually all ethnic groups of the Philippines. It is usually dome-shaped or cone-shaped, but various other styles also exist, including versions with dome-shaped, cone-shaped, or flat crowns with a flat or gently sloping brim. The tip of the crown commonly has a spiked or knobbed finial made of metal or wood (sometimes with horsehair or feather plumes). The rim may also feature tassels of beads, feathers, or metal ornaments. They can range in size from having very wide brims to being almost helmet-like. It is held in place by an inner headband (baat) and a chinstrap. It was widely used in the Philippines until the 20th century when it was largely replaced by western-style hats. Salakot worn by a woman harvesting rice Salakot worn with a barong tagalog Salakot can be made from various materials including bamboo, rattan, nito, bottle gourd, buri straw, nipa leaves, pandan leaves, carabao horn, and tortoiseshell. The way they are manufactured and ornamented varies by ethnic group. Salakot can also have named subtypes based on the material used. Among Tagalogs for example, salakot made from split bamboo were known as tinipas, while salakot made from dried bottle gourd were known as takukom. They can also be coated with resin to make them waterproof. Most salakot were simple and were made from cheap materials. These were worn as protection against the sun and rain by farmers and fishermen. However, more elaborate salakot made from rarer materials, with inlaid ornaments and tassels, were treated as precious heirloom objects, handed down from generation to generation. They were status symbols and could be used as currency, as collateral for a promise, or as gifts. Some salakot also had cloth overlays (which are commonly decorated with elaborate embroidery) or have linings which can have pockets used for storing valuables and money, as well as tobacco or betel leaves. Variants T'boli women The uniquely shaped sadok of the Mandaya people of southeastern Mindanao The name salakot is derived from the version of the headgear from the Tagalog and Kapampangan people. The names of similar headgear in other ethnic groups of the Philippines include: *Hallidung - also known as lido, are the salakot of the Ifugao people. Usually made from twilled rattan or bamboo and covered in a coating of resin to make it waterproof. *Kalugung - are the salakot of the Kalinga people. They were usually made of rattan and nito, or from light wood. They were either shaped like a dome or a gently sloping cone. *Kattukong - also known as katukong, tukong, or tabungaw, are the salakot of the Ilocano and Tinguian people, usually made from dried gourd reinforced with nito woven at the rim. *Sadok or Sarok - refers to the different salakot designs of the Cebuano, Bikolano, and Mandaya people. **Cebuano Sarok - Also known as Takokong in Sialo-dialect Cebuano. Features a lightweight and design-central design. It is made of woven nito vines and dried leaves creating a patterned net-like structure, with a signature six-petal flower design made from lighter leaves or thin wood plates secured at the very top of the hat. **Bicolano Sadok - This salakot is made from anahaw leaves and bamboo and either features a pointed shape resembling Mt Mayon, or a rounded shape with an inner attached hat fitted around the wearer's head. This is also he style of salakot worn in Leyte and Sorsogon. **Mandaya Sadok - The Mandaya sadok is uniquely elongated from front to back, and are often decorated with feathers, tassels, and beads. *Saro - are the salakot of the Tausug people *Saruk - are the salakot of the Yakan and Sama-Bajau people made from plaited rattan, nito and cotton. The Yakan version is characteristically dome-shaped with a wide crown. Both men and women can wear the saruk. Among men, they are worn over the traditional pis syabit headscarves. *Sayap - also known as binalano or tapisan, are the salakot of the Maguindanao people. They are made from twilled bamboo and nito. *S'laong - are the salakot of T'boli people. They are gender-specific. Men wore the shallow conical s'laong naf, made from bamboo and rattan with geometric black-and-white designs. Women wore the wide-brimmed s'laong kinibang which was made from bamboo covered with a cloth lining that distinctively hang down the sides and back, usually decorated with bead fringes. * History 19th-century silver-inlaid salakot in the Villa Escudero Museum Salakot is part of the pre-colonial culture of the Philippines. The earliest record of salakot was in 1521 when Antonio Pigafetta of Ferdinand Magellan's expedition described a \\"queen who wore a large hat of palm leaves in the manner of parasol, with a crown about it of the same leaves like the tiara of the pope; and she never goes any place without such one.\\" During the 19th century in the Spanish colonial era, the salakot were worn as status symbols by members of the aristocratic class (the Principal√≠a) as part of the barong tagalog ensemble.Cf.

These Spanish-era salakot were made from prized materials like tortoiseshell and elaborately decorated with gems and precious metals like silver,Manuel Buzeta y Felipe Bravo, Diccionario geografico, estadistico, historico de las Islas Filipinas, Charleston, South Carolina: 2011, Nabu Press, Vol. I, p. 241. or, at times, gold.Laureano, Felix, ed.

Many depictions of gobernadorcillos and cabezas de barangay would portray these colonial public functionaries as wearing ornate salakot.Alfredo R.

They were commonly cloth-covered. This was copied first by the French colonial troops in Indochina who called it the salacco. British and Dutch troops in nearby regions followed suit and the salakot became a common headgear for colonial forces in the mid-19th century.Manuel Buzeta y Felipe Bravo, Diccionario geografico, estadistico, historico de las Islas Filipinas, Charleston, South Carolina: 2011, Nabu Press, Vol. I, p. 241. The salakot was most widely adopted by the British Empire. They began experimenting with derivative designs in search of a lightweight hat for troops serving in tropical regions. This led to a succession of designs ultimately resulting in the \\"Colonial pattern\\" pith helmet. French marines also introduced the early version of the salacco to the French Antilles, where it became the salako. Cultural significance The salakot is a common symbol for Filipino identity, often worn by the National personification Juan dela Cruz along with a barong tagalog. The kattukung made from bottle gourd is also commonly associated with the 18th-century Ilocano revolutionary leader Diego Silang. In 2012, Teofilo Garcia of Abra in Luzon, expert artisan of a special kind of salakot made of bottle gourd (Lagenaria siceraria) was awarded by the National Commission for Culture and the Arts with the \\"Gawad sa Manlilikha ng Bayan\\" (National Living Treasures Award) for his dedication to the traditional craft of making gourd salakot, affirming the status of the salakot as one of the intangible cultural heritage of the Philippines under the traditional craftsmanship category.

It is calculated by dividing putouts and assists by the number of innings or games played at a given defense position.Baseball-Reference.com (Fielding Stats Glossary) The statistic is premised on the notion that the total number of outs in which a player participates is more relevant in evaluating that player's defensive play than the percentage of cleanly handled chances as calculated by the conventional statistic fielding percentage. However, some positions (especially first baseman) may have substantially more putouts because of a superior infield around them that commits fewer errors and turns many double plays, allowing them to receive credit for more putouts. Also, catchers who have many strikeout pitchers on their team will have a high range factor, because the catcher gets the putout on a strikeout if the batter does not reach base.

The Vicarate was promoted to the Roman Catholic Diocese of Kimberley in 1951.  History  In 1886 it became a separate vicariate comprising Basutoland, Griqualand West, Bechuanaland and the Orange River Colony (then still Orange Free State). On 8 May 1894, Basutoland was separated and made an independent prefecture. Since then the vicariate included the Orange River Colony, Griqualand-West and Bechuanaland, and after the later Anglo-Boer war all this territory came under British colonial rule. The whole vicariate lay between the Tropic of Capricorn and the southernmost point of the Orange River Colony, and between 22¬∞ and 30¬∞ East Longitude. Before the discovery of diamonds the white population was practically composed of Protestant Boers. The number of Catholics was insignificant. The towns now in existence were then mere small villages or did not yet exist. But in 1870 Kimberley began to attract attention; diamonds had been first discovered about three years previously by John O'Reilly, and immigration brought to South Africa and especially to Kimberley multitudes of Europeans, most of them Irish and English. By the time Kimberley was leaping into existence there was already a priest in Bloemfontein, Father Hoendervangers of the Order of Saint Norbert, who had followed the troops as Military chaplain during a war between the British and Boers in 1854. He built a church which was replaced by a new one in 1880. When Father Hoendervangers left Bloemfontein he was replaced by Father Victor Bompart, sent by Dr. Jolivet to minister to the scanty Catholic population. For some time, the number of Catholics remained limited to eight or ten. All of them were too poor to support the priest who very often saw himself on the verge of starvation. However, Father Bompart never swerved from his duty; he was always ready to face sacrifice. His greatest trial was neither starvation nor physical sufferings, but the fruitlessness of the soil he had to cultivate. Being obliged to live in the midst of an element prejudiced against anything which might remind them of Rome and hating the very name of Catholic, his labours were to remain apparently fruitless for several years. The Boers were unwilling to hear of another creed than their own. Their ministers never wearied of railing at and abusing pope and priests. Owing to such a spirit conversions have been always few; many prejudices, however, have been overcome by schools conducted by nuns of various orders. When Kimberley started into existence the number of Catholics in the locality necessitated the frequent visit of the priest and very soon the establishment of a permanent mission. Fathers Bompart, Lebihan and Hidien used to visit them occasionally. Father Hidien finally established a Catholic Society and began the erection of a hospital. A poor and small chapel was first erected, but owing to the increase of the Catholic congregation, a larger and more substantial one was planned and built. Its erection is due to the indefatigable Father Hilary Lenoir, Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate (O.M.I.). The whole vicariate is greatly indebted to him for all the missions he has founded or helped to found; Kimberley, Mafeking and Harrismith have, thanks to him, their churches and presbyteries. When in 1886 a separate vicariate was erected, the Right Reverend Anthony Gaughren, also O.M.I., was appointed the first Vicar Apostolic; he was elected in May, 1886, consecrated on 10 August 1886, and died in Kimberley on 15 January 1901. On 29 January 1902, his brother, the Right Rev. Matthew Gaughren, O.M.I., was elected to replace him, and was consecrated titular bishop of Tentyra on 16 March 1902. Under the jurisdiction of these two bishops the Vicariate of Kimberley has seen its churches and schools multiplied. In 1910, the vicariate had 16 churches and chapels; 19 priests (of whom 16 belong to the Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate); one college under the management of the Congregation of Christian Brothers, where over 300 boys received a thorough education. The Sisters of the Holy Family conducted 6 parochial schools and 3 boarding schools. The Sisters of Mercy had two schools, a boarding school in Mafikeng and a parochial school in Vryburg, North West. The Sisters of St. Jacut conducted at Taungs a school for natives. Taungs, the only native mission then, was founded in May, 1898, by Father Porte, O.M.I., and counted over 400 Catholics. The total number of children frequenting Catholic schools was over 1200. Besides the schools, the Vicariate of Kimberley had an establishment for orphans, the poor and the aged, managed by the Sisters of Nazareth. The devoted self-sacrifice of these Sisters contributed to overcome the prejudices of Protestants who help them generously in the upkeep of their establishment, where over one hundred and fifty children and aged persons were cared for; all the primary schools were in part supported by the Government. Besides the 16 Oblates and the 3 secular priests, 3 lay brothers, 11 Christian Brothers (Irish), 42 Sisters of the Holy Family of Bordeaux, 14 Sisters of Nazareth, 5 Sisters of Saint Jacut and 12 Sisters of Mercy carried out the work of regeneration in the vicariate. One of the great obstacles to evangelisation in this vicariate was the fact of the population being scattered and unsettled, preventing the priest from being in continual touch with his flock. The small number of priests permitted no increase of mission work amongst the natives, who far outnumbered the white population. The mining industry seemed the only source of material wealth, and its exploitation was to end. In the farming districts, though communication was facilitated by the construction of railways, the future seemed precarious owing to droughts, cattle diseases, locusts etc. As a consequence the population is unsettled and shifting, and sacerdotal vocations within the vicariate are hardly to be expected for the present. Catechisms and prayer books in the native language have, however, been compiled by Father Porte who made an expedition into Bechuanaland in 1898, and discovered that the natives, while akin in race and speech to the Basutos, are more rooted in fetishism.

Spamigation is similar to a strategic lawsuit against public participation (\\"SLAPP\\"), which is filed by a large organization, or in some cases an individual plaintiff, to intimidate and silence a less powerful critic by so severely burdening them with the cost of a legal defense that they abandon their criticism. Spamigation differs in that it aims at stopping an economic activity, in the case of the RIAA's lawsuits the copying of copyrighted material. Instances *In the case of DirectTV's lawsuits, they were \\"sued for racketeering and the courts forced them to stop the spamigation campaign.\\" *Viacom's lawsuits against YouTube and Google in the mid-to-late 2000s, in which over 100,000 DMCA takedown notices were sent, used a system of spamigation that sent notices to videos if they contained selected phrases of material under Viacom copyright. As a result of this technique, many non- infringing videos were removed. *Scientology has often been accused by critics of using spamigation under their Fair Game policy. L Ron Hubbard said that enemies of Scientology \\"May be deprived of property or injured by any means... May be tricked, sued or lied to or destroyed.\\" (taken from HCOPL Oct. 18, 1967 Issue IV, Penalties for Lower Conditions ). Hubbard is also quoted as saying \\"The purpose of the suit is to harass and discourage rather than to win.

Appearance The Tahltan was built somewhere between the lines of the spitz and pariah types. The ideal dog was, above all else, athletic and agile. As they were always bred solely for hunting value, appearance could vary significantly between dogs. =Coat and colour= A Tahltan Bear Dog was primarily black, dark brown or blue, with some white patches on the chest, underbelly and sometimes the feet or tail. Standing 14 to 17 inches high at the shoulder, with relatively large, erect pointed ears, with a refined, pointed muzzle. The glossy coat was of average length, with guard hairs covering a thicker undercoat. Paws some what webbed and relatively large for the size of the dog. They were bred to be double jointed and gaited, enabling them to switch gaits as they moved through different terrain or heavy brush, as were all the aboriginal dogs of the North and South American continents. Like others of their group, they had a peculiar yodel. Foxy in appearance, their main distinction among dogs is their novel tail. Short, bushy and carried erect, it has been described variously as a shaving brush or a whisk broom. History Raised by the Tahltan people to hunt bears, the Tahltan Bear Dog was a mighty power in a small package. Before a hunt, the dogs were ceremonially bled by stabbing them in the hindquarters with the fibula bone of a fox or wolf. The morning of the hunt, two dogs were carried in a sack over the hunter's shoulder until fresh bear tracks were sighted. Upon release, these little dogs moved lightly over the crust of snow while the bear was slowed by the deep drifts. Their fox-like staccato yaps harassed the bear into submission or confused it until the hunter could come close enough for a kill. To prepare for a foray against big cats, a claw from a lynx was used to ceremonially mark the dog's face. The Tahltan Bear Dog had the courage to face a bear, but was friendly and gentle with smaller animals and with humans. They lived in the tent with the family, sharing bed and board. Descended from pariah-type dogs that had come with prehistoric migrations, the Tahltan Dogs were centralized in the remote mountainous areas of northwestern British Columbia and the Southern Yukon. Their usual diet was small bits of birds, meat and fish, and they flourished in the bitter cold. Outside their native environment, they succumbed to distemper, heat prostration and problems due to dietary changes. As European explorers came into the territory, bringing a variety of other dogs, the Tahltan Dog became diluted. There are no living descendants past 1960‚Äì70. Genetic references in the archeological record show no modern relationship of Tahltan dogs to any modern populations.

The SASE process starts with an electron bunch being injected into an undulator, with a velocity close to the speed of light and a uniform density distribution within the bunch. In the undulator the electrons are wiggled and emit light characteristic of the undulator strength but within a certain energy bandwidth. The emitted photons travel slightly faster than the electrons and interact with them each undulator period. Depending on the phase to each other, electrons gain or lose energy (velocity), i.e. faster electrons catch up with slower ones. Thereby the electron bunch density is periodically modulated by the radiation which is called microbunching. The structured electron beam amplifies only certain photon energies at the cost of kinetic energy until the system goes into saturation. SASE energy spectra show a noise-like distribution of intense spikes on top of a lower-amplitude background. The micro-bunch structuring reduces the phase space available to the photons, thus they are also more likely to have a similar phase and the emitted beam is quasi-coherent. This concept has been demonstrated at the SPring-8 FEL SACLA in Japan, the Free electron LASer in Hamburg (FLASH) and the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) at SLAC.

Present day The station lies on a dismantled section of the Severn Valley Line north of Bridgnorth and has been sold into private hands as a dwelling. The building is very similar in style to Arley on the Severn Valley Railway and retains many of its original architectural features having been extended in a sympathetic manner. Although the bay platform has been filled in, the platform edging bricks remain. The space between the two main platform faces has been only partially filled and the station thus retains much of its former character.

The IMO was formed in January 1984 through the amalgamation of the Irish Medical Association and the Irish Medical Union. It is a negotiating body which represents doctors in Ireland, recognised for negotiating purposes under the Trade Union Act 1941. History of Irish medical organisations =1839 ‚Äì The Irish Medical Association= On 29 May 1839, a union of physicians and surgeons was formed at the Royal College of Surgeons in Dublin. > \\"That it is therefore our opinion a legislative measure should be sought for > by us, to unite the medical profession of Ireland into a co-operation upon > such principles as shall constitute them one National Faculty, and thereby > identify in feelings and interests, the greater mass of provincial > practitioners with their metropolitan brethren\\" The group lapsed from 1846 to 1852. On 7 June 1853, another congress was held in Dublin to re-establish the Association, and in 1882 it became incorporated as the Irish Medical Association. On 1 January 1936, the IMA merged with the Irish branch of the British Medical Association to form the Irish Free State Medical Union. It was later renamed the Medical Association of √âire (IMA & BMA), which became the IMA in 1950. =1962 ‚Äì The Irish Medical Union= In 1957 negotiations between the IMA and the Irish government over employment conditions for doctors broke down with the government announcing that the IMA was not a registered trade union and so could not be recognised as a negotiating partner. A debate began then within the organisation, between those who wanted to register as a trade union and those who felt that industrial trade union membership was incompatible with being a professional association with clinical/patient responsibilities or what was sometimes previously termed as a \\"learned profession\\". In 1962, the Irish Medical Union was established, initially, as a sub-section of the IMA and then became a break-away group under the presidency of Dr Johnny Cox, a general practitioner and farmer in Delvin, Co. Westmeath. The medical doctors' trade union was initially housed at the offices of the IMA in Fitzwilliam Place, Dublin 2, and later moved to separate offices in Northumberland Road, [Dublin 4], then Harcourt Street [Dublin 2], and finally, to Drumcondra, Dublin. Soon after this split the government agreed to engage in direct negotiations with the Irish Medical Association (IMA) without requiring it to formally register as a trade union. Following the creation of the breakaway IMU in 1962 this effectively divided medical doctors' representation in the Republic of Ireland for over two decades weakening their influence on emerging healthcare public policy and the formation of the state's Health Boards structures in 1970. =1984 ‚Äì The Irish Medical Organisation= In January 1984 the IMA and the IMU amalgamated to become the Medical Union, a name which was later changed to the Irish Medical Organisation. Five years later a group of hospital consultants formed the Irish Hospital Consultants' Association (IHCA) to represent the specific interests of senior medical specialists. It was established in 1989 and maintains that it has 1,800 of Irish medical consultants within its ranks. Today the Irish Medical Organisation (IMO) is a negotiating body which acts on behalf of doctors in Ireland, recognised for negotiating purposes under the Trade Union Act 1941, though the IHCA also represents consultant grades in official negotiations with the Health Service Executive HSE and the Department of Health. The role of the IMO is to represent doctors in Ireland and to provide them with all relevant services. It is organised into four 'craft groups': general practitioners; Consultants; ' Non-consultant hospital doctors (NCHDs); and public health & community medicine doctors. It is also committed to the development of caring, efficient and effective health services in Ireland. Structure The organisation has the following Departments: Industrial Relations, Policy & International Affairs, Membership, Operations and Communications. The current President is Professor Trevor Duffy, a Consultant Rheumatologist at the Connolly Hospital, Blanchardstown, Dublin and the Hermitage Medical Clinic and is Honorary Clinical Associate Professor at the RCSI.

This report was instrumental in Leopold finally relinquishing his private holdings in Africa. Leopold had had ownership of the Congolese state since 1885, granted to him by the Berlin Conference, in which he exploited its natural resources (mostly rubber) for his own private wealth. Prelude: The Stokes Affair Through intercepted letters, Captain Hubert- Joseph Lothaire, the commander of the Congo Free State forces in the Ituri- campaign, learned that Charles Stokes (born in Dublin) was on his way from German East Africa to sell weapons to the Zanzibari slavers in the eastern Congo region. Stokes was arrested and taken to Captain Lothaire in Lindi, who immediately formed a Drumhead court-martial. Stokes was found guilty of selling guns, gunpowder and detonators to the Congo Free State's Afro-Arab enemies. On 14 January 1895 he was sentenced to death and was hanged the next day (hoisted on a tree). To Lothaire, Charles Stokes was no more than a criminal whose hanging was fully justified. Lord Salisbury, the British Prime Minister at the time, commented that if Stokes was in league with Arab slave- trading, then ‚Äòhe deserved hanging‚Äô. Sir John Kirk, for years the British Consul in Zanzibar, remarked that ‚Äúhe was no loss to us, although he was an honest man.‚Äù The news of Stokes‚Äô execution was received with indifference by the British Foreign Office. When the German ambassador asked Sir Thomas H. Sanderson, the Permanent Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, whether the British government planned to take any steps regarding the execution of this ‚Äúwell-known character‚Äù, Sanderson wrote: ‚ÄúI do not quite understand why the Germans are pressing us.‚Äù In August 1895, the attention of the British press was drawn to this case by Lionel Decle, a journalist for the Pall Mall Gazette. The press began to report on these events in great detail, The Daily News emphasized 'bloodthirsty precipitation' , The Times a 'painful and disgraceful death', The Liverpool Daily Post 'horrified amazement through the British race', The Daily Telegraph 'death like a dog', adding 'Have we all been wrong in believing that the most audacious foreigner ‚Äì not to speak of any savage chief ‚Äì would think once, twice and even trice, before he laid hands on a subject of Queen Victoria'.Roger Louis, W. (1965). \\"The Stokes Affair and the Origins of the Anti-Congo Campaign, 1895‚Äì1896\\". Revue belge de philologie et d'histoire. 43: 572‚Äì584. As a result, the case became an international incident, better known as the Stokes Affair. Together, Britain and Germany pressured the Congo Free State to put Lothaire on trial, which they eventually did, a first trial was held in the city of Boma. The Free State paid compensation to the British (150,000 francs) and Germans (100,000 francs) and made it impossible by decree to impose martial law or death sentences on European citizens. Stokes's body was returned to his family. Lothaire was acquitted twice, first in April 1896 by a tribunal in Boma. In August 1896, the appeal was confirmed in Brussels by the Supreme Court of Congo, paving the way for the rehabilitation of Lothaire. The Stokes Affair mobilized British public opinion against the Congo Free State. It also damaged the reputation of King Leopold II of Belgium as a benevolent despot, which he had cultivated with so much effort. The case helped encourage the foundation of the Congo Reform Association ‚Äì by Roger Casement and E. D. Morel ‚Äì which on its turn put pressure on the Belgian government, which helped lead to the annexation of the Congo Free State by the Belgian state in 1908.Roger Louis, W. (1965). \\"The Stokes Affair and the Origins of the Anti-Congo Campaign, 1895‚Äì1896\\". Revue belge de philologie et d'histoire. 43: 572‚Äì584. Publicity 1895‚Äì1903 E. D. Morel For many years prior to the Casement Report there were reports from the Congo alleging widespread abuses and exploitation of the native population. In 1895, the situation was reported to Dr Henry Grattan Guinness (1861‚Äì1915), a missionary doctor. He had established the Congo-Balolo Mission in 1889, and was promised action by King Leopold later in 1895, but nothing changed. H. R. Fox-Bourne of the Aborigines' Protection Society had published Civilisation in Congoland in 1903, and the journalist E. D. Morel also wrote several articles about the Leopoldian government's behaviour in the Congo Free State. On 20 May 1903 a motion by the Liberal Herbert Samuel was debated in the British House of Commons, resulting in this resolution: Subsequently, the British consul at Boma in the Congo, the Irishman Roger Casement was instructed by Balfour's government to investigate. His report was published in 1904, confirmed Morel's accusations, and had a considerable impact on public opinion. Casement met and became friends with Morel just before the publication of his report in 1904 and realized that he had found the ally he had sought. Casement convinced Morel to establish an organization for dealing specifically with the Congo question. With Casement's and Dr. Guinness's assistance, he set up and ran the Congo Reform Association, which worked to end Leopold's control of the Congo Free State. Branches of the association were established as far away as the United States. The Casement Report Emile Vandervelde The Casement Report comprises forty pages of the Parliamentary Papers, to which is appended another twenty pages of individual statements gathered by Casement as Consul, including several detailing grim tales of killings, mutilations, kidnappings and cruel beatings of the native population by soldiers of the Congo Administration of King Leopold. Copies of the Report were sent by the British government to the Belgian government as well as to nations who were signatories to the Berlin Agreement in 1885, under which much of Africa had been partitioned. The British Parliament demanded a meeting of the fourteen signatory powers to review the 1885 Berlin Agreement.Foreign Office Blue Books, 1904 Cd. 1933 While the Report was issued as a Command paper in 1904, and was laid before the Houses of Parliament, the original was not published in full until 1985, in an annotated book by two Belgian professors of the history of colonialism.Vellut J-L, and Vangroenweghe D.; Le Rapport Casement (Enqu√™tes et documents d'histoire africaine) Universit√© Catholique de Louvain: Centre d'Histoire de l'Afrique (1985). Pp. xxviii + 174. The Belgian Parliament, pushed by socialist political leader and statesman Emile Vandervelde and other critics of the King's Congolese policy, forced a reluctant Leopold II to set up an independent commission of enquiry. Its findings confirmed Casement's report in every detail. This led to the arrest and punishment of officials who had been responsible for murders during a rubber-collection expedition in 1903 (including one Belgian national who was given a five-year sentence for causing the shooting of at least 122 Congolese natives). Dissolution of the Congo Reform Association Despite these findings, Leopold managed to retain personal control of the Congo until 1908, when the Parliament of Belgium annexed the Congo Free State and took over its administration as the Belgian Congo. However the final push came from Leopold's successor King Albert I, and in 1912 the Congo Reform Association had the satisfaction of dissolving itself. Other diplomatic manoeuvres by Roger Casement =Hindu-German Conspiracy= Franz von Papen, the Vice- Chancellor of Germany under Adolf Hitler in 1933‚Äì34. Papen was key in organising the arms shipments. During World War I, Casement is known to have been involved in the \\"Hindu‚ÄìGerman Conspiracy\\", a German-backed plan by Hindu nationalists to win their independence from the British Raj (formerly British India), recommending Joseph McGarrity to Franz von Papen as an intermediary. This Irish collaboration with Indian revolutionaries resulted in some of the early but failed efforts to smuggle arms into India, including a 1908 attempt on board a ship called the SS Moraitis which sailed from New York for the Persian Gulf before it was searched at Smyrna. The Irish community later provided valuable intelligence, logistics, communication, media, and legal support to the German, Indian, and Irish conspirators. Those involved in this liaison, and later involved in the plot, included major Irish republicans and Irish-American nationalists like John Devoy, Joseph McGarrity, Roger Casement, √âamon de Valera, Father Peter Yorke and Larry de Lacey. These pre-war contacts effectively set up a network which the German foreign office tapped into as WWI began in Europe.Plowman, Matthew Erin. \\"Irish Republicans and the Indo- German Conspiracy of World War I\\", New Hibernia Review 7.3 (2003), pp. 81‚Äì105. The Indian nationalists may also have followed Casement's strategy of trying to recruit prisoners of war to fight for Indian independence. =Anglo- Peruvian Amazon Rubber Company= In 1906 Casement was on his way to Brazil, where he became consul for the foreign office in Santos, then he was transferred to Par√°,Brian Inglis, \\"Roger Casement\\" 1973, pp. 157‚Äì65 and lastly he was promoted to consul-general in Rio de Janeiro.See Roger Casement in: \\"Rubber, the Amazon and the Atlantic World 1884‚Äì1916\\" (Humanitas) He was attached as a consular representative to a commission investigating rubber slavery by the Anglo-Peruvian Amazon Rubber Co, which had been registered in Britain in 1908 and had a British board of directors and numerous stockholders. In September 1909, a journalist named Sidney Paternoster, wrote in Truth, a British magazine, of abuses against PAC workers and competing Colombians in the disputed region of the Peruvian Amazon. Casement travelled to the Putumayo District, where the rubber was harvested deep in the Amazon Basin, and explored the treatment of the local indigenous peoples in Peru.Casement‚Äôs journal maintained during his 1910 investigation was published as The Amazon Journal of Roger Casement (London: Anaconda Editions, 1997). A companion volume of documents relevant to 1911 and his return to the Amazon was published as Angus Mitchell (ed.), Sir Roger Casement‚Äôs Heart of Darkness: The 1911 Documents (Irish Manuscripts Commission, 2003) The isolated area was outside the reach of the national government and near the border with Colombia‚Äîwhich played an important role at that time, with the construction of the Panama CanalJane M. Rausch (2014). Colombia‚Äôs Neutrality during 1914‚Äì1918: An Overlooked Dimension of World War I. University of Massachusetts Amherst, USA. Iberoamericana, XIV, 53. pp. 103‚Äì115.‚Äî, Colombia periodically made incursions in competition for the rubber. For years, the indigenous peoples had been forced into unpaid labour by field staff of the Anglo-Peruvian Amazon Rubber Company, who exerted absolute power over them and subjected them to near starvation, severe physical abuse, rape of women and girls by the managers and overseers, branding and casual murder. Casement found conditions more inhumane than those in the Congo. He interviewed both the Putumayo and men who had abused them, including three Barbadians who had also suffered from conditions of the company. When the report was published, there was public outrage in Britain over the abuses. =Collaboration with the German Empire in WWI= German U-Boot SM U-19, second from the right. c. 1914. In August 1914, at the outbreak of World War I, Casement and John Devoy arranged a meeting in New York with the western hemisphere's top-ranking German diplomat, Count Bernstorff, to propose a mutually beneficial plan: if Germany would sell guns to the Irish revolutionaries and provide military leaders, the Irish would revolt against England, diverting troops and attention from the war with Germany.Casement's diaries kept in Germany, containing his speaking openly of his treason, have been edited and published by Angus Mitchell (ed.), One Bold Deed of Open Treason: The Berlin Diary of Roger Casement 1914‚Äì1916 (Dublin: Merrion Press, 2016). In 1916, the British had intercepted German communications coming from Washington and suspected that there was going to be an attempt to land arms shipments on Irish shores, although they were not aware of the precise location. The arms ship SS Libau, masqueraded as a merchant ship, under Captain Karl Spindler, was apprehended by HMS Bluebell on the late afternoon of Good Friday. In the early hours of 21 April 1916, three days before the Easter Rising began, the German submarine put Casement ashore at Banna Strand in Tralee Bay, County Kerry. Casement was suffering from a recurrence of malaria that had plagued him since his days in the Congo Free State, and too weak to travel, he was discovered at McKenna's Fort in Rahoneen, Ardfert, and arrested on charges of treason. Sir Basil Thomson headed Scotland Yard's Criminal Investigation Division during WWI. A group of Irish American congressmen with the help of Joseph Tumulty (the President's personal and Irish-catholic secretary) presented a petition to Woodrow Wilson (of Scots-Irish descent) with the request to lean in on the Casement trial. Wilson was in the middle of his re-election campaign and was counting on the Irish American vote. The British hoping for American intervention in the war, could have hardly ignored a plea from Wilson. On 2 May 1916, Wilson wrote Tumulty: ‚ÄúWe have no choice in a matter of this sort. It is absolutely necessary to say that I could take no action of any kind regarding it.‚ÄùAngus Mitchell (2003). Casement. London: Haus Publishing. p.150. Terry Golway (1999). Irish Rebel: John Devoy and America's Fight for Ireland's Freedom. St. Martin's Griffin. Robert Schmuhl (2016). Ireland's Exiled Children: America and the Easter Rising. NY: Oxford University Press. On 3 August 1916 Casement was hanged for treason, sabotage, and espionage against the British Crown on the basis of collaboration with the German Empire.

He is one of the most well-known military generals of his time due to his humble background, outstanding command abilities, strength and valour in battle. During his career, he participated in successful campaigns against remnants of Western Tujue and against Goguryeo, with only one major flaw on his record which was an unsuccessful campaign against Tibetan Empire in 670, where another general in his army refused to listen to Xue's advice and charged ahead and caused the majority of the army to be lost. During Emperor Taizong's reign Xue Rengui was born in 614, during the reign of Emperor Yang of Sui, but his early activities were not recorded, other than that his wife had the surname Liu (). It was said that he was poor and was a farmer. Around the time that Tang Dynasty's second emperor Emperor Taizong was set to launch a major campaign against Goguryeo in 644, Xue was planning to rebury his ancestors, when Lady Liu told him: Xue thus went to meet the general Zhang Shigui () to volunteer for the army. Once he reached the front, on an occasion when the general Liu Jun'ang () was being surrounded by Goguryeo forces, Xue went to rescue Liu, and he was able to kill the Goguryeo commander and hang the Goguryeo commander's head on his saddle; after this incident, he began to gain fame and was promoted to become an officer. When Emperor Taizong was ready to attack the Goguryeo city of Ansi (, in modern Anshan, Liaoning) in 645 and was faced with a major relief army sent by Goguryeo's Dae Mangniji (regent) Yeon Gaesomun, commanded by the generals Go Yeonsu () and Go Hyejin (), Emperor Taizong had his officers try to repel the Goguryeo forces. Xue, despite his low military rank, believing himself to be powerful and wanting to show his ferocity, decided to lead the charge. He put on a white armor and armed himself with a Ji and two bows, roaring fiercely and charging into the enemy forces, and no one from the Goguryeo army could stop him, the rest of Tang officers then followed and charged into the enemy line as well. As Xue fought his way through the frontlines against the overwhelming numbers of enemy forces, he inflicted much casualties on the Gogureyo soldiers. Taizong personally led 4,000 elite soldiers into the battle as well, the Goguryeo army's formation was broken, at least 20,000 Goguryeo soldiers were killed and 36,800 soldiers including their generals Go Yeonsu and Go Hyezin, surrendered. In the midst of battle Emperor Taizong spotted Xue from a distance and asked his attendants, \\"Who is that man in white armor?\\" and was told it was Xue. Emperor Taizong summoned Xue to his presence and awarded him with gold and silk and also gave him a general title. After Emperor Taizong retreated later in the year, he told Xue: Emperor Taizong made Xue one of the commanding generals for the imperial guards. During Emperor Gaozong's reign After Emperor Taizong's death in 649, his son Li Zhi succeeded him (as Emperor Gaozong), and for the first few years of Emperor Gaozong's reign, Xue Rengui appeared to remain a commanding general for the imperial guards. In 654, when Emperor Gaozong was visiting the vacation palace Wannian Palace (, in modern Baoji, Shaanxi), there was a major storm. On the night of June 22, it rained particularly hard, and a flash flood descended on the Xuanwu Gate of Wannian Palace. The imperial guards all fled, but Xue did not, and instead climbed up the gate and yelled loudly inside the palace to warn the emperor. Emperor Gaozong quickly got out of his bed and climbed as high as he could, and in brief time, the water flooded into his bedchambers, and this flood killed some 3,000 residents of Linyou County, where the palace was located, and imperial guards. Afterwards, Emperor Gaozong made the comment to Xue, \\"It is only by your call that I avoided drowning, and from this I know that you are a faithful subject.\\" He awarded Xue a horse. In 657, when the general Su Dingfang attacked Western Turkic Khaganate's Shaboluo Khan Ashina Helu (), Xue submitted a suggestion that if the wife and children of the chief of one of Western Turkic Khaganate's constituent tribes, Nishu Tribe (), who did not particularly support Ashina Helu but was forced to comply after Ashina Helu took his wife and children hostage, were to be captured by Tang forces, that they be immediately released so that the chief of Nishu would submit to Tang. When Emperor Gaozong approved this suggestion, the chief of Nishu did, indeed, join Tang's army. Su was subsequently able to defeat and capture Ashina Helu. Later that year, Xue was made deputy to the general Cheng Mingzhen () in an operation against Goguryeo, and they captured Goguryeo's city Chifeng (, in modern Fushun, Liaoning) and defeated the Goguryeo general Du Bangnu (). In 659, Xue personally led a surprise cavalry charge to attack the Goguryeo formation under the command of Goguryeo general Wen Shamen () and defeated him, single-handedly killing dozens of enemy soldiers in the battle. He also engaged Qidan forces, capturing their chief Abugu () and taking him back to the eastern capital Luoyang. For this achievement, he was created the Baron of Hedong. In 661, after the chief of Tang's vassal Huige, Yaoluoge Porun () died and was succeeded by his nephew Yaoluoge Bisudu (), Yaoluoge Bisudu broke away from Tang and allied with two other tribes, Tongluo () and Pugu () in attacking Tang's northern boundary. Emperor Gaozong commissioned the general Zheng Rentai () to be in charge of an operation against Huige, while making the Xue and Liu Shenli () Zheng's deputies. When they encountered Huige's coalition forces‚Äîwhich by this point appeared to include all nine major tribes of Tiele‚Äîthe coalition challenged Tang forces to a small battle, with Tiele sending out their 10 fiercest warriors. Xue personally engaged them and killed three of them with three arrows, intimidating the Tiele coalition and causing them to submit‚Äîbut after their surrender, he ordered to kill all the ten and several thousands people. From this incident, a military song was written to praise Xue's ferocity, including the words: \\"The general is able to pacify Tian Shan with three arrows, and the warriors sing their long songs as they enter the boundaries of Han.\\" After the army returned to Tang territory, however, Xue was charged with killing those who had already surrendered and seizing the spoils of war and arrested for a time, but was eventually released after Emperor Gaozong ruled that the achievements outweighed the crimes. In 666, Yeon Gaesomun died, and infighting developed between Yeon's oldest son Yeon Namsaeng, who succeeded Yeon Gaesomun as Dae Mangniji, and two younger sons Yeon Namgeon and Yeon Namsan, over suspicions that they had for each other. Eventually, Yeon Namgeon, while Yeon Namsaeng was away from the capital Pyongyang, claimed the Dae Mangniji title himself. Yeon Namsaeng sent his son (later known as Cheon Heonseong/Quan Xiancheng (), as Yeon () was the same character as Emperor Gaozong's grandfather Emperor Gaozu's name Yuan and therefore could not be used as part of naming taboo) to seek aid from Tang. When Emperor Gaozong sent the generals Pang Tongshan () and Gao Kan () to aid Yeon Namsaeng, Yeon Namgeon tried to intercept them, and Xue, who trailed them, marched forward to aid them, allowing them to defeat Goguryeo forces together. After they captured the cities of Namso (, in modern Tieling, Liaoning), Mokjeo (, in modern Fushun), and Changam (, in modern Benxi, Liaoning), they were able to rendezvous with Yeon Namsaeng. In spring 668, they further marched east and captured Goguryeo's major northeastern city Buyeo (, in modern Siping, Jilin), and Xue was described to have marched to the sea (probably Sea of Japan) and taking some 40 cities in Goguryeo's northeastern territories, before marching southwest to rendezvous with the supreme commander of the entire operation, Li Ji, at Pyongyang. After Pyongyang fell later in 668, thus ending Goguryeo, Emperor Gaozong ordered that Goguryeo territory be annexed into Tang territory and that a protector general (known as the Protectorate General to Pacify the East) by established at Pyongyang, with Xue appointed as the protector general to defend Pyongyang, along with the general Liu Rengui. Emperor Gaozong created him the Duke of Pingyang. It was said that Xue was a capable administrator and was, for a while, able to receive allegiance from the people of Goguryeo. Battle of Dafeichuan in which Xue was defeated by Tibetans In 670, Tibetan Empire launched a major attack on Tang's Anxi Protectorate and captured 18 prefectures. Emperor Gaozong commissioned Xue to command a counterattack, with Ashina Daozhen (), and Guo Daifeng (), the son of Tang's veteran general Guo Xiaoke (ÈÉ≠Â≠ùÊÅ™), as his deputies. However, as Guo had been of the same rank as Xue, he viewed serving as Xue's deputy as a dishonor and often disobeyed Xue's orders. Xue's initial strategy was to take some troops ahead toward, with Guo remaining behind at Qinghai Lake with the military supplies‚Äîand once Xue had cleared the pass, he would then signal for Guo to proceed. Guo, however, disobeyed the order and did not wait for Xue's signal, but proceeded after Xue departed, and he was intercepted and defeated by a 200,000-men Tibetan army. After Guo's army collapsed, Xue was himself attacked by the Tibetan prime minister Gar Trinring Tsendro (\\"Lun Qinling\\" () in Chinese) and defeated at the Dafeichuan. Nearly the entire army was lost, and Xue was forced to sue for peace under unfavorable terms. Emperor Gaozong sent the official Le Yanwei to the front to put Xue, Guo, and Ashina under arrest, but released them once they were brought back to the capital Chang'an. However, they were relieved of their posts. At later time, when the people of Goguryeo were rising in resistance to Tang occupation, Xue was put in charge of pacifying the region, but yet later, probably in 675, Xue was deposed for reasons not clearly stated in historical records and exiled to Xiang Prefecture (, roughly modern Laibin, Guangxi), only allowed to return from exile when a general pardon was declared. In 681, Emperor Gaozong, remembering Xue's contributions, summoned him and again made him a general. In 682, when remnants of the Eastern Tujue, rising under the chiefs Ashina Gudulu and Ashide Yuanzhen (), declared independence from Tang, Xue was commissioned to attack Ashide Yuanzhen. His presence intimidated the Eastern Tujue soldiers, who had thought that he was long dead, and he scored a major victory over Ashide Yuanzhen. Xue died in 683. His sons Xue Ne and Xue Chuyu (), and several later descendants would serve as generals as well. In fiction Xue Rengui's life was dramatized in a number of fictional works. The most prominent of these works were the play Xue Rengui's Glorious Return Home (), by the Yuan Dynasty playwright Zhang Guobin () and an anonymous novel from Qing Dynasty, Xue Rengui's Campaign to the East (). His tenure as General of Andong Protectorate following the fall of Goguryeo has been dramatized in a popular Korean television series called Dae Joyeong, and portrays Xue Rengui as a Tang general who is constantly frustrated by the insurgency of the Dongmyeongchun League; remnants of the Goguryeo underground resistance against the Tang. According to this television action-drama, broadcast worldwide on KBS-1, Xue Rengui could finally claim victory over the Goguryeo insurgency when he had Dae Joyoung and his legion of escaped Baekje, Goguryeo, Khitan, and Silla prisoners cornered, and had Dae Joyoung vow loyalty to the Tang Empire, and become a military officer of high- rank in the Tang army. However, Xue Rengui is to lose Dae Joyoung again following a stratagem in which Dae Joyoung volunteers to lead a punitive force of Tang soldiers against nomadic bandits in Mount Madu to recover stolen Tang money. While Dae Joyoung successfully recovers the gold and silver taels and convinces the bandits to fight another group of the Tang punitive force led by the evil Tang general Li Wen, he dispatches the stolen property back to Chang'an alongside his close Dongmyeongchun League confidant Mimosa and a small group of Tang soldiers, Dae Joyoung took the opportunity escape the Tang to return to his Goguryeo land on the true-pretext that general Li Wen was going to attack kill him and his Goguryeo subordinates. This television series also portrays Xue Rengui travelling from Chang'an with only his friend and bodyguard Hongpei to the Khitan-held Yingzhou in order meet his old war protege the Khitan Khan Li Jinzhong to personally warn him about general Li Wen's desire to destroy the Khitans in the year 695. But this is apparently a symbolic gesture made by the show's producers, since General Xue Rengui died in 683, to indicate his good and friendly nature and his disdain for political matters. A \\"ballad-narrative\\" () known as \\"The story of Xue Rengui crossing the sea and Pacifying Liao\\" () is to written in the Suzhou dialect of Wu Chinese. Popular culture He also appears famously as a hero in Chinese folklore in which he is the father of the fictional general Xue Dingshan and the father-in-law of the Turkic princess Fan Lihua. The story of Xue Dingshan and his wife Fan Lihua is often used as a subject for Chinese opera. There is a drama film named Xue Dingshan San Qi Fan Lihua about them. Because of his campaigns in Korea against both Goguryeo and Silla, he was referred as \\"The General who Pacified the East\\" for the Tang. It is ironic, since Xue's fictional son is referred as \\"The General who Pacified the West\\" for the Tang because of his fictional campaigns against the Turks, however, the campaigns against the Turks should also be attributed to the latter Xue. In the folklore, Xue Rengui was known to have a massive appetite in which he was thought to be possess by the \\"hungry god.\\" The legend of Xue Dingshan and Fan Lihua takes place between the Tang and the fictional Turkic kingdom of Western Liang, ironically there was a real Western Liang during the Sixteen Kingdoms period that was thought to be the ancestors of the Tang. Xue Rengui also sometimes appears as a door god in Chinese and Taoist temples along with the Korean general Yeon Gaesomun. =Film and television= *Portrayed by Alex Man in the 1985 TVB series The Legend of The General Who Never Was * Portrayed by Lee Deok-hwa in the 2006-2007 KBS TV series Dae Jo Yeong. * Portrayed by Yoo Tae-woong in 2006-2007 SBS TV series Yeon Gaesomun. * Portrayed by Bao Jian Feng in the 2006 TV series Legend of Xue Ren Gui References =Citations= =Bibliography= * Old Book of Tang, vol. 83. * New Book of Tang, vol. 111. * Zizhi Tongjian, vols. 198, 199, 200, 201, 203.

Nehrling was responsible for supplying information to the Soviet Union and hid banned books. He was later caught by the SS and killed at the Dachau concentration camp. Biography Kurt Nehrling was born in Weimar to restaurateurs Max and Emma Nehrling. His parents' restaurant, Zum Goldenen Stern in the Jakobstrasse, was a popular workers' tavern and served as a meeting place for members of the Social-Democratic People Association (a local chapter of the SPD). This exposure influenced Nehrling's future political career.Biography at SPD-Weimar From 1901 to 1905, membership in the local chapter of the SPD increased dramatically from 120 to 616. The party therefore created an autonomous social and cultural environment in the worker-populated areas of the Weimar. In 1907, the Social Democrats, trade unions, and associations laid the foundation for their own building, the \\"Community Center\\". Two years later, a local group of the Socialist Worker Youth was founded there. Nehrling joined the SPD in 1919. In the years following World War I, he worked at the district administration of Weimar. There he became acquainted with Marie Prox, the daughter of Emil Prox, the chairman to the Social Democratic People Association. In 1921, Nehrling married Prox but tragedy struck two years later when Marie died from complications of childbirth with their second child. Nehrling, however, continued to maintain strong relations with his father-in-law. Although Prox is not very well remembered today, Nehrling's son later recalled his significance on his father's life. In 1923, Nehrling was working as an employee in the Thuringian Ministry of Economic Affairs when he met and later married his second wife, Hedwig Nehrling. In 1929, Nehrling became ill with tuberculosis. This was a long illness, finally breaking in 1931. Although employed in the Th√ºringer government, the National Socialists broke all relationship with the SPD in 1933 and terminated all non-National Socialist employment. Kurt and Hedwig Nehrling had immense financial problems in these years. In their dwelling they opened Homestead Way 16 (today Kurt Nehrling road) a provisional linen shop. Later moving to a corner shop at the Zeppelinplatz. At this time Kurt Nehrling joined the Social-Democratic Reichsbanner Schwarz-Rot-Gold, a front fighter organization formed to defend the Republic from National Socialist control.

These services include the Symphony Services Music Library, the Artist Development program, publications/program note editing and international artists‚Äô contracts, visas, travel and accommodation. Some of these services are also provided to other orchestras and individuals on a user-pays basis. Symphony Services Australia began in 1997 after the Concerts Division of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation devolved.http://www.abc.net.au/tv/ypa/past/ This process came about after the beginnings of privatisation of the Australian six state orchestras, creating the need for a company that provided services in a centralised environment. Symphony Services International supports the ABC Symphony Australia Young Performers Awards and runs a Conductor Development Program. They also hold one of the Southern Hemisphere's largest classical print music library with over 460,000 itemshttp://symphonyinternational.net/music-library/ and holds over 3,500 program notes.http://symphonyinternational.net/products/ The members of Symphony Australia are: *Adelaide Symphony Orchestra *Melbourne Symphony Orchestra *Queensland Symphony Orchestra *Sydney Symphony Orchestra *Tasmanian Symphony Orchestra *West Australian Symphony Orchestra As of August 2010 Symphony Services International introduced other forms of membership.

An autonym might not be mentioned in the publication that creates it as a side-effect. Autonyms \\"repeat unaltered\\" the genus name or species epithet of the taxon being subdivided, and no other name for that same subdivision is validly published (article 22.2). For example, Rubus subgenus Eubatus is not validly published, and the subgenus is known as Rubus subgen. Rubus. Autonyms are cited without an author. The publication date of the autonym is taken to be the same as that of the subdivision(s) that automatically established the autonym, with some special provisions (the autonym is considered to have priority over the other names of the same rank established at the same time (article 11.6)). Articles 6.8, 22.1-3 and 26.1-3 relate to establishing autonyms. Autonyms are not created if the name of the genus or species being subdivided is illegitimate. Definition The definition of an autonym is in Art. 6.8 of the ICN: :\\"6.8. Autonyms are such names as can be established automatically under Art. 22.3 and 26.3, whether or not they appear in print in the publication in which they are created\\" :\\"22.3. The first instance of valid publication of a name of a subdivision of a genus under a legitimate generic name automatically establishes the corresponding autonym (see also Art. 11.6 and 32.8).\\" The form of this autonym is described in the earlier Art. 22.1: \\"The name of any subdivision of a genus that includes the type of the [...] name of the genus to which it is assigned is to repeat the generic name unaltered as its epithet, not followed by an author citation [...] Such names are termed autonyms\\". :\\"26.3. The first instance of valid publication of a name of an infraspecific taxon under a legitimate species name automatically establishes the corresponding autonym (see also Art. 32.8 and 11.6).\\" And as above, but now for infraspecific taxa, Art. 26.1 says: \\"The name of any infraspecific taxon that includes the type of the [...] name of the species to which it is assigned is to repeat the specific epithet unaltered as its final epithet, not followed by an author citation [...] Such names are termed autonyms\\". Interpretation The application of names of taxonomic groups is determined by means of nomenclatural types (Principle II of the ICN). For all taxa, nomenclatural types are preserved specimens or illustrations. In the case of an infraspecific taxon, if a botanist described a new taxon and publishes a new name at infraspecific level, all elements that previously belonged to the species (and are not included in the newly described taxon) now become a new infraspecific taxon. But as neither the type nor the final epithet has changed, there is no need for a change in author citation. The same goes for a subdivision of a genus. If a botanist creates a new subdivision of a genus, for example by dividing a large genus into two or more subgenera, sections, or series, then a new subdivision of the genus at each of the new ranks will share the type of the genus and have as its epithet the name of the genus. As will be clear from the definition, an autonym can be one of two kinds: * for a taxon at a rank below that of genus and above that of species (technically a \\"subdivision of genus\\", but loosely speaking an \\"infrageneric taxon\\"), in which case its epithet repeats the generic name (Art. 22), for example :: Magnolia L. sect. Magnolia, automatically established when A.P. de Candolle published sect. Gwillimia DC., in: Syst. Nat. 1 (1817): 455. * for a taxon at a rank below that of species (an infraspecific taxon), in which case the infraspecific epithet repeats the specific epithet (Art. 26), for example :: Elmerrillia papuana (Schltr.) Dandy var. papuana, automatically established when var. glaberrima Dandy, and var. adpressa Dandy were published. Other provisions concerning autonyms The name of a subdivision of a genus that includes the type of the genus is not validly published if its epithet does not repeat the generic name unaltered,ICBN (Vienna Code) Art. 22.2. \\"A name of a subdivision of a genus that includes the type [...] of the [...] name of the genus is not validly published unless its epithet repeats the generic name unaltered. [...]\\" in other words: it may not be anything other than an autonym, for example ::When Seringe published Magnolia L. subgen. Gwillimia Ser., in: Fl. Jard. 3 (1849): 222, the autonym Magnolia L. subgen. Magnolia was automatically established. When the latter was named Magnolia L. subgen. Eumagnolia by Seringe, same publication, p. 224, that name was not validly published as it included Magnolia virginiana L., the type of the genus. The autonym however, was validly published, even though it did not appear in print. The same goes, mutatis mutandis, for infraspecific taxa.ICBN (Vienna Code) Art. 26.2. \\"A name of an infraspecific taxon that includes the type [...] of the [...] name of the species is not validly published unless its final epithet repeats the specific epithet unaltered. [...]\\" An autonym is considered to have been published at exactly the same time as the earliest name(s) in that particular rank under the genus or species. ::When Rehder & Wilson in C.S. Sargent, Pl. Wilson. 1 (1913): 392, published Magnolia officinalis Rehder & E.H. Wilson var. biloba, they established at the same time Magnolia officinalis Rehder & E.H. Wilson var. officinalis, even though that name was nowhere mentioned in Plantae Wilsonianae. The autonym has nomenclatural priority over the name (or the names, as the case may be) that established it (Art. 11.6). ::When Heracleum sibiricum L., with subsp. lecokii (Godr. & Gren.) Nyman and subsp. sibiricum (autonym), is placed under Heracleum sphondylium L. as a subspecies, then the correct name of the subspecies is Heracleum sphondylium L. subsp. sibiricum (L.) Simonk.ICBN (Vienna Code) Art. 11 Ex. 25. This can be viewed as uniting the subspecies lecokii and the subspecies sibiricum into one subspecies, and as such a choice has to be made between the two subspecies names; the autonym sibiricum has priority. The type of an autonym is the same as that for the corresponding genus or species (Art. 7.6): \\"The type of an autonym is the same as that of the name from which it is derived.\\" As an autonym is automatically created (without an author being involved), no author citation follows the name.

It was held at Palazzo delle Esposizioni, one of the main contemporary art museums in Rome - Italy, from 24 April to 10 July 2002. The exhibition was visited by over 50,000 people. The exhibition Palazzo delle Esposizioni in Rome Displayed on 1300 square meters, it showed over 300 videogames starting from the 1961 Space War to the latest hits for PC, PlayStation 2, Xbox and GameCube. There were also more than 40 different consoles, including the Magnavox Odyssey, the Vectrex, the TurboGrafx-16, and over 50 handheld consoles from the 1970s to nowadays. Play tried to show the evolution of video games not only from a technical point of view, but also the interactions between them and society. This was illustrated through interviews with important game designers such as Shigeru Miyamoto, Hideo Kojima, Tetsuya Mizuguchi and the biographies of many other leading personalities in the games industry, through the advertisement campaigns, and though highlighting the relationships between games and sports, politics, Hollywood and the military industries. The exhibition was mainly organised in a chronological order and divided in five main areas. The first area went from the beginnings of video games till the raise of Nintendo, whose playing cards dated 1900 and few electrical toys from the 50s where shown. The second area was characterized by the 16-bit consoles. The third one was dedicated to PlayStation, Sega Mega Drive, N64 and other minor consoles such as Atari Jaguar, whilst the fourth one was on PC games, from the first Id Software productions to the recent Mmorpg (Massively-Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Games). The last area was focused on PlayStation 2, Xbox and Gamecube.

At this time it was the tallest ride of its type in the world. Smoke can be seen at the top of the ride's canisters. Many consider it to be one of the best flat rides in the UK.  Construction  Construction for Rush started late 2004, after Eclipse, the Ferris wheel had been removed. It was originally meant to have four air tanks, instead of two. It took around 4 months to construct and test. The ride was installed by Ride Entertainment Group.  Ride Opening  The grand opening for Rush was at midday on 27 May 2005. After testing all through the morning, it opened, only to break down after four ride cycles. It tested for over 1 hour, and reopened again. As the ride has two swings which swing in opposite directions, it is thought the ride needed to close due to the swings falling out of sync, which caused the ride to operate with one swing, meaning it can only hold 16 people per ride.  Ride Experience  The ride begins with low swings which gradually get higher. After about 5 swings it reaches its full height of and its top speed of 50 mph. The approximate angle the swings reach is 104 degrees. At the peak of the swing, riders feel strong negative G's and at the bottom, positive forces of up to 3.5 G. After 4 swings at its full height, the ride slows down quickly to a stop. The ride experience is enhanced by the fact that it has a lap bar instead of the over the shoulder restraints. This gives riders more freedom and feel more exposed. The ride is powered by compressed air which makes the ride extremely loud. Some guests feel the noise adds to the experience but it has been criticised due to the noise as well. The ride can also run on one swing if the park is quiet or if the other is not working. The capacity with one swing is 375 riders per hour, with two swings 768 riders per hour.  2008 Incident  On 27 May 2008, a piece of metal fell from the ride, while it was operating with guests seated. The ride was stopped immediately and was closed for inspection. The incident was caught on film and posted on YouTube.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcSAoHLopgY The fallen part was re- made and re-fitted and new platforms were built. The ride was covered in scaffolding for a week whilst being repaired. The ride re-opened shortly afterwards.

They found only limited success, and are perhaps best known for having Johnny Depp as a guitarist before he launched his acting career. History In 1981, the band was founded as The Abusers by singer Bobby Bondage and original bassist Andy Panik after meeting at a screening of the documentary The Decline of Western Civilization.\\"Gold Coast Live\\" August 1985 Later evolving into the Rock City Angels, the band assumed a more glam rock fashion style; members grew out their hair and began wearing eyeliner, lipstick, and nail polish. Bobby Bondage adopted the alias Bobby St. Valentine. Their sound reflected this shift. Sonically, the band became an aggressive mix of hardcore punk and glam rock marked by themes of rebellion, failed relationships, and the independent music scene. Songs such as \\"Cinderella in Black\\", \\"Hush Child\\", \\"Dark Angels\\", and \\"Teenage Lipstick Boys\\" incorporate strong melodies and power chords. The band's high turnover rate retarded their path to mainstream success, however. While the band developed a large local following in South Florida, members were ready to disband in the mid-1980s. At what was to be their farewell show, Ann Boleyn of New Renaissance Records offered the act a recording contract. The band then relocated to Los Angeles where they became a local fixture into the 1990s. In 1986, Bobby St. Valentine changed his name to Bobby Durango, and actor Johnny Depp, also from South Florida, joined the band as a rhythm guitarist before debuting as an actor on the police procedural television series 21 Jump Street. At this time, after signing with Worldwide Media, Geffen Records took notice and bought their contract from New Renaissance Records in 1986. Before the release of their debut studio album, Young Man's Blues, in 1988, the band assumed the aliases Delta City Angels and Delta Rebels due to conflict with a gospel group of the same name. The name was reverted prior to the album's release, however. In 1990, the band began the process of recording demos for a second album titled Lost Generation. They recorded some 80 songs, all of which were rejected by Geffen. Frustrated by Geffen's lack of interest, they went to London and recorded six songs with Thin Lizzy guitarist Brian Robertson, which Geffen also declined to support. Eventually, Geffen dropped the band. According to the band's own website, the song, \\"Hush Child\\", which appeared on their debut album, and which helped secure their deal with Geffen, was actually written by former lead guitarist Davy Lightning, but was not so credited on the album. A major label follow-up album was never released. Amid the burgeoning alternative rock scene, the band broke up in 1993. New Renaissance Records released Rock City Angels in 1999. In 2001, the band reunited and began recording a third album titled Use Once & Destroy, a return to the band's punk rock and blues roots. The album remained unfinished for several years but was finally completed in 2007 and released in November 2008. Following the album's release, a new iteration of the band played shows in the Southeastern United States from June 2009‚ÄìMay 2012. In 2010, FNA Records released a compilation of songs meant for the second record called Midnight Confessions. On June 4, 2012, SleazeRoxx.com reported that Bobby Durango had died. At the time, the band had reportedly been working on a studio album titled Devils in the Countryside due for release at the end of 2012. Throughout its lifespan, the band toured with Joan Jett, Jimmy Page, the Georgia Satellites, and played with L.A. Guns, Jetboy, The Zeroes, Flies on Fire, and Junkyard, and opened for Black Flag and Circle Jerks.

However other Malay polities also flourish prior to Srivijayan expansion in late 7th century, such as Langkasuka, Pan Pan and Panai. The Melayu Kingdom (also known as Malayu, Dharmasraya Kingdom or the Jambi Kingdom; , reconstructed Middle Chinese pronunciation mat-la-yu kwok)Muljana, Slamet , (2006), Sriwijaya, Yogyakarta: LKIS, . was a classical Malay Buddhist kingdom located in Southeast Asia. The primary sources for much of the information on the kingdom are the New History of the Tang, and the memoirs of the Chinese Buddhist monk Yijing who visited in 671, and states was \\"absorbed\\" by Srivijaya by 692, but had \\"broken away\\" by the end of the eleventh century according to Chao Jukua. The exact location of the kingdom is the subject of studies among historians. One theory is that the kingdom was established around present-day Jambi on Sumatra, Indonesia, approximately 300 km north of Palembang. According to this theory, it was founded by ethnic groups in the Batanghari river area and gold traders from the Minangkabau hinterland. The theory is disputed as the geographical location of Jambi contradicts the descriptions by Yijing, who explicitly mentioned that the kingdom is located half-way between Ka-Cha (Kedah) and Bogha (Palembang)\\". Etymology The origins of the word Melayu ('Malay') are disputed. One theory suggests that it is derived from the Javanese terms melayu or mlayu (to steadily accelerate or to run), to describe the strong current of a river in Sumatra that today bears the name Sungai Melayu ('Melayu river'). The name was later possibly adopted by the Melayu Kingdom, as it is common for people in the region to be known by the name of the river on which they settled. Another theory hold that it originates from the Tamil words Malai and ur meaning \\"mountain\\" and \\"city, land\\", respectively. An early literary appearance was in Vayu Purana where the word \\"Malaya Dvipa\\" (literally \\"mountainous dvipa\\") was mentioned, referring to the mountainous terrain of Malay Peninsula. Then, the term \\"Maleu-Kolon\\" was used in Geographia by Ptolemy which is believed to have originated from the Sanskrit term malayakolam or malaikurram, referring to a geographical part of Malay Peninsula. In 7th century, the first use of the term for a nation or a kingdom was recorded by Yijing. The East Javanese Anjukladang inscription dated from 937 CE Medang Kingdom stated the Sima status is awarded to Anjukladang village and a jayastambha (victory monument), which later upgraded as a temple, was erected in recognition of their service on repelling the invading forces from Malayu. The temple mentioned here is probably the Candi Lor made of bricks which is now in ruins, located in Candirejo village in Nganjuk Regency. The mentioning of invading Malayu forces refer to the old name of Sumatran Malayu Kingdom, which probably refer to Srivijaya instead. This means by the 10th century, the Javanese identify their Sumatran-based enemy as \\"Malayu\\". An inscription on the south wall of the 11th century Brihadeeswarar Temple also made a reference to Malaiyur, a kingdom that had \\"a strong mountain for its rampart\\" in Malay Peninsula that fell to the Chola invaders during Rajendra Chola I's campaign. In the later Yuan Dynasty (1271‚Äì1368) and Ming Dynasty (1368‚Äì1644), the word Ma-La-Yu was mentioned often in Chinese historical texts - with changes in spelling due to the time span between the dynasties - to refer to a nation near the southern sea. Among the terms used was \\"Bok-la-yu\\", \\"Mok-la-yu\\" (Êú®ÂâåÁî±), Ma-li-yu-er (È∫ªÈáå‰∫àÂÖí), Oo-lai-yu (Â∑´Êù•Áî±) - traced from the written source of monk Xuanzang), and Wu-lai-yu (ÁÑ°Êù•Áî±). In the chronicle of Yuan Dynasty, the word \\"Ma-li-yu-er\\" was mentioned in describing the Sukhothai Kingdom's southward expansion against Malay states of the peninsula.: ::\\"..Animosity occurred between Siam and Ma-li-yu-er with both killing each other...\\" In response to the Sukhothai's move, a Chinese envoy arrived at the Ram Khamhaeng's court in 1295 bearing an imperial order: \\"Keep your promise and do no evil to Ma-li-yu-er\\". This nation of \\"Ma-li-yu-er\\" that appeared in the Chinese record possibly a similar nation that was mentioned by the famous Venetian traveller Marco Polo (1254‚Äì1324) who lived during the same period. In Travels of Marco Polo, he made a reference to a kingdom named \\"Malauir\\" in the Malay peninsula. The Khmer recorded the nation of Melayu, however, its progeny Srivijaya, was also called Melayu. According to the translation by Slamet Muljana, the word bh≈´mi MƒÅlayu (literally \\"Land of Malayu\\") is inscribed on the Padang Roco Inscription, dated 1286 CE,Muljana, Slamet, 1981, Kuntala, Sriwijaya Dan Suwarnabhumi, Jakarta: Yayasan Idayu, hlm. 223. according to the inscription, bh≈´mi MƒÅlayu is associated with the Dharmasraya kingdom. On the Amoghapasa inscription, dated 1347 CE, the word Malayapura (literally \\"city of Malaya\\" or \\"kingdom of Malaya\\") was proclaimed by Adityawarman, again referring to Dharmasraya. The word \\"Melayu\\" is also mentioned in the Malay annals referring to a river in Sumatra: ::\\"...Here now is the story of a city called Palembang in the land of Andelas. It was ruled by Demang Lebar Daun, a descendant of Raja Shulan, and its river was the Muara Tatang. In the upper reaches of the Muara Tatang was a river called Melayu, and on that river was a hill called Si-Guntang Mahameru...\\" Yijing's account On his route via Maritime Southeast Asia, Yijing visited Srivijaya twice where he stayed from 688 to 695, studying and translating the original texts in Sanskrit. Srivijaya appears to have been flourishing around the time of Yijing's visit, which he initially called \\"Bogha\\" during his first visit. At its greatest extent, the kingdom extended to Malayu, which seems to have been annexed or to have come spontaneously under the realm of Bogha prince. The whole country as well as the capital received the name \\"Sribogha\\" or Srivijaya. The change of the name Malayu to Sribogha is likely to have occurred before Yijing's time or during his stay there, for whenever he mentions Malayu by name, he added that \\"it is now changed to Sribogha\\". The following extract from Yijing's work, A Record of Buddhist Practices Sent Home from the Southern Sea, further describes his route via Bogha and Malayu: ::Wu Hing came to Bogha after a month's sail. The king received him very favourably and respected him as a guest from the land of the son of heaven of the Great Tang. He went on board the king's ship to the country of Malayu and arrived there after fifteen days sail. Thence he went to Ka Cha, again after fifteen days. At the end of winter he changed ship and sailed to the west. Further for the determination of the location of Sribogha-Malayu, Yijing furnishes the following: ::In the country of Sribogha, we see the shadow of the dial-plate become neither long nor short (i.e \\"remain unchanged\\" or \\"no shadow\\") in the middle of the eighth month (Autumnal equinox), and at midday no shadow falls from a man who is standing on that day, so it is in the middle of spring (Vernal equinox). Thus it can be inferred that the country of Sribogha covered the place lying on the equator, and the whole county therefore must have covered the north east side of Sumatra, from the southern shore of Malacca, to the city of Palembang, extending at least five degrees, having the equatorial line at about the centre of the kingdom. According to Yijing, Hinayana Buddhism was predominantly adopted in Srivijaya, represented for the most part by the Mulasarvastivada school, however there were few Mahayanists in Malayu. Gold seems to have been abundant in the kingdom, where people used to offer the Buddha a lotus flower of gold and used golden jars. Moreover, people of the kingdom wear a type of long cloth and used fragrant oil. Further, Melayu had accessed to gold producing areas in the hinterland of Sumatra. This slowly increased the prestige of Melayu which traded various local goods, including gold, with foreigners. Center of Srivijaya Muaro Jambi of Melayu Kingdom, later integrated as one of Srivijaya's important urban centre. Between 1079 and 1088, Chinese records show that Srivijaya sent ambassadors from Jambi and Palembang.Page 165. Early Kingdoms of the Indonesian Archipelago and the Malay Peninsula. Paul Michel Munoz. In 1079 in particular, an ambassador from Jambi and Palembang each visited China. Jambi sent two more ambassadors to China in 1082 and 1088. This suggests that the centre of Srivijaya frequently shifted between the two major cities during that period. The Chola invasion of Srivijaya and as well as changing trade route weakened Palembang, allowing Jambi to take the leadership of Srivijaya from the 11th century on.Page 167. Early Kingdoms of the Indonesian Archipelago and the Malay Peninsula. Paul Michel Munoz. Demise In 1275, Kritanagara, of the Singhasari Kingdom, took advantage of Srivijaya's decline and sent a military expedition to establish Javanese control of Melayu. Embassies were sent to China in 1299 and 1301. Mahesa/Kebo/Lembu Anabrang was a General of Singhasari, who conquered Srivijaya and Melayu in 1288. Almost a century after taking over Palembang's role as the centre of an empire, Jambi and Srivijaya experienced decline in influence.Page 168. Early Kingdoms of the Indonesian Archipelago and the Malay Peninsula. Paul Michel Munoz. This was caused by a change of policy by the Song dynasty to no longer accept ambassadors from Srivijaya and Jambi's inability to cope with changing scenario. Instead of the Jambi controlling the trade through tributary system, traders were allowed to trade directly.Page 169. Early Kingdoms of the Indonesian Archipelago and the Malay Peninsula. Paul Michel Munoz. According to George Coedes, by the beginning of the fourteenth century, Melayu \\"remained the only Sumatranese state of some political importance and it had become the refuge of Indian culture in opposition to the sultanates of the north that were already Islamized or in the process of becoming so.\\"  Melayu's last prince Parameswara  In the year 1347, Gajah Mada the military leader of Majapahit installed Adityawarman as the king of Melayu to prevent the revival of Srivijaya. Adityawarman later conquered Tanah Datar to take control of the gold trade and founded a kingdom in Pagar Ruyung. In the year 1377, the Majapahit defeated Palembang and ended efforts to revive Srivijaya. The last prince of Srivijayan origin, Parameswara, fled to Temasik to seek refuge before moving farther north, where he founded what would become the Malacca Sultanate.

Biography  Isao Kikuchi was born in East Los Angeles on 9 December 1921, the second child of Yoriyuki Kikuchi ‚Äì one of the first Asian Americans to graduate from the University of Southern California School of Dentistry - and Miya Sonomiya Kikuchi. In 1942, at the onset of World War II, Isao was lured to the high desert of California by an offer of construction work at union wages. He found himself interned at the Manzanar relocation camp which would become home to his family and 10,000 other Japanese Americans evacuated from the West Coast under authority of Presidential Executive Order 9066. Isao recounted his time at Manzanar in an interview conducted by Richard Potashin as part of the Densho Digital Archive - Manzanar National Historical Site Collection. The interview is available on the Densho site under a Creative Commons license. A video recording of the interview (Kirk Peterson, videographer) is also available. After 12 months, Isao was allowed to leave Manzanar for Chicago where he was drafted into the army. As a member of the now famed 442nd Regimental Combat Team, Isao served with distinction and saw fierce fighting against German forces in the Italian Alps and in France. At the conclusion of the war, Isao returned to Chicago and then to Los Angeles in 1950 with his new bride, Alice Ishii. After a successful career as a Graphic Designer, Isao called upon his wartime experiences to produce a number of hauntingly beautiful paintings and sculptures and, in some cases, photographs combining the two. Isao also illustrated children's book on the subject of the Relocation experience, including Blue Jay in the Desert,Welcome Home Swallows, and The Spirit of Manzanar (written by his daughter, Junie).

Now mostly residential, but originally an area of good-quality agricultural land, it covers the area north of Portslade village as far as the urban boundary. Mile Oak is on the edge of the South Downs and as such has much farmland nearby; the Monarch's Way and Sussex Border Path long-distance footpaths skirt the edge of the built-up area. The first urban development occurred in the 1930s, and growth continued throughout the postwar era; houses were provided by the council, private builders and housing associations, many of them provided for people occupying substandard houses in the southern part of Portslade. The Portslade Aldridge Community Academy is located at Chalky Road in Portslade, and houses a public library. Other local amenities include The Mile Oak Inn public house, the Anglican Church of the Good Shepherd and Mile Oak Farm. History The location of the oak tree to which the name \\"Mile Oak\\" refers is not known for certain, but researchers have suggested two sites. In 1935, a contributor to the Sussex County Magazine described \\"an old oak that stood on the roadway until about 30 years ago, when it gradually rotted away ... it was on the west side of the road, about a mile [north of] the old George Inn on [Portslade] High Street\\". Alternatively, it may have been at Mile Oak Farm further north. Mile Oak, also spelt Mileoak in early documents, was first mentioned on a tithe map of 1840; and the Ordnance Survey map of 1873 identified Mileoak Cottages and Mileoak Barn on the road (now Mile Oak Road) leading north from Portslade village to the South Downs. Two families were recorded as living in Mile Oak in the 1881 census. They were agricultural workers; the main farm in the area was Mile Oak Farm, which covered . Brighton Corporation bought Mile Oak Farm on 2 January 1890 with the intention of building a waterworks and pumping station there. This was completed in 1900 to the design of James Johnston, who also designed two adjacent cottages for waterworks employees (these are now locally listed buildings). The Corporation intended that the surrounding land should remain undeveloped to preserve the purity of the water. Also in 1900, a rifle range was opened to replace an earlier facility in east Brighton. It was used by the 1st Volunteer Battalion of the Royal Sussex Regiment. It was in an isolated position north of Mile Oak Farm on the slopes of the South Downs; this seclusion made it an ideal location. The facility was set to be closed in September 1934, but it was used throughout World War II. No trace of it remains. Apart from a terrace of four houses on Mile Oak Road which date from the early 20th century and which are locally listed, development of the area now known as Mile Oak began in the 1930s and was piecemeal. Portslade Council established a girls' school and built some council housing; private housing development also took place; and some people informally occupied land along Mile Oak Road and claimed squatters' rights. A central focus to the Mile Oak area developed when Chalky Road was built up with private and housing association houses, shops and community buildings after World War II: until that time it was merely a chalk-covered cart track. East Sussex County Council built Portslade Senior Girls School, the predecessor of Portslade Community College, and a clinic and doctors' surgery in 1960. Mile Oak Gospel Hall followed in 1966. Housebuilding then continued until the end of the 20th century, both on the land originally acquired by Brighton Corporation and on parcels of land in other ownership, and urban development is now continuous north of Portslade village to the South Downs. Mile Oak Farm is still council- owned, and the remaining land and managed by tenant farmers. Downs Park Downs Park is an area of late 20th-century housing at the eastern edge of Mile Oak, between the estate and Hangleton. Although located in the borough of Hove, the land was owned by Brighton Borough Council. They built some council housing, and other houses were built by private developers and housing associations between the late 1970s and the 1990s. The area has no community facilities of its own, although the large West Hove Sainsbury's supermarket is at the southern edge of the estate. The company bought the site in June 1989, and the store opened in October 1992 and was extended in July 1999. Since 1986 Downs Park and the Sainsbury's supermarket have been served by the Brighton & Hove bus company's route 6 to Brighton station via Portslade station, Aldrington, central Hove and central Brighton. A connecting road to the Mile Oak estate (Fox Way) was built the early 1990s but did not open until January 1996. A large park was built on the north side of this road on a former chalk pit‚Äîa site with a \\"peculiar shape\\" and steep slope‚Äîfunded by a housing trust and Brighton Borough Council; Hove Borough Council agreed to maintain the park. It opened in August 1994. Buildings and facilities Planning permission for an Anglican church for the Mile Oak area was granted in March 1936, and later that year a tin tabernacle was acquired with help from the Church of the Good Shepherd, Brighton and a private benefactor. The land and building cost ¬£450, and it was dedicated on 8 November 1936. Work to replace this temporary facility began in June 1966, and on 28 October 1967 the new Church of the Good Shepherd was dedicated. It was designed by local architects Clayton, Black and Daviel (scheme architect M. G. Alford) in a Modernist style and cost ¬£25,000; local churches including All Saints Church, Hove and St Nicolas Church, Portslade contributed towards this. It was consecrated in 1994 and became a parish church in its own right in the same year, separating it from the parish of St Nicolas, Portslade. It is a locally listed building. Mile Oak Gospel Hall, a place of worship for the Church of God, was built on Chalky Road in 1966. Hove Borough Council sold land to the community for ¬£500, and construction cost ¬£6,000; most of this was raised by the sale of the congregation's former chapel in Portslade. It was registered for the solemnisation of marriages in August 1968. The church closed in the early 2010s and is now occupied by the Brighton Wellness Centre. The Mile Oak Inn on Mile Oak was designed in 1951 by local architects John Leopold Denman and Son for the Kemp Town Brewery of Brighton. It is Neo-Georgian in style and opened in December 1954. The Campaign for Real Ale have listed it as a \\"Heritage Pub\\" with a historic interior of regional importance, noting the prevalence of original features and the retention of its traditional three-bar layout. The Mill House Inn at the south end of Mile Oak, close to Portslade village, opened on Mill Lane in 1950 for the Tamplins Brewery of Brighton. It closed in July 2013, and a planning application for its demolition and replacement with houses was raised in July 2015. East Sussex County Council bought of land at Mile Oak in 1937 and built Portslade Girls' School on the site. Pupils moved from a smaller school in Wellington Road in Portslade. The new building cost ¬£19,800 and opened in 1940. It merged with Portslade Boys' School in Portslade High Street in 1972 to form Portslade Community College, which operated across both sites. The Chalky Road building was extended soon after this, and a library which could be used by the public was also provided. Until it opened in May 1975, Mile Oak residents had to make do with \\"a few boxes of books in the community centre\\". The school is now called Portslade Aldridge Community Academy and is based solely at Mile Oak, the Portslade High Street site having been sold to another school. Portslade Industrial School, a \\"handsome structure of red brick\\", was built jointly by London County Council (who ran it from 1913) and Brighton Corporation in 1904 at a cost of ¬£30,000. It was a reform school for boys, many of whom were sent there from outside Sussex. Later names were Mile Oak School, Mile Oak Approved School and finally (in 1971) Mile Oak Community Home. It closed in 1977, and after a brief period when the sixth form of Portslade Community College occupied it, the building and its attached farm were demolished and the site redeveloped for housing. Mile Oak Primary School opened in September 1965 on a site on Graham Avenue bought by East Sussex County Council 11 years earlier. It was designed by architect J. Catchpole and cost ¬£48,000. By the start of the 21st century it had grown to be the largest primary school in the city of Brighton and Hove; an extension was built in 1999 at a cost of ¬£475,000. Hill Park School, for children with special educational needs, was created in September 2019 from the merger of Hillside and Downs Park Schools. Downs Park School opened on its site on Foredown Road in October 1961, four years after it was established in the church hall of Bishop Hannington Memorial Church in West Blatchington. Hillside School opened three years later on an adjacent site. Mile Oak Recreation Ground was laid out in the 1930s by Portslade Council. The land was part of a farm but had been used for dumping rubbish. It covers and is home to local football club Mile Oak F.C.. A children's playground opened in 1992. Transport A route 1 bus to Mile Oak at Old Steine, Brighton A bypass for Brighton and Hove, rerouting the A27 trunk road away from inner suburban areas, was first discussed in the 1920s, but the borough and county councils only voted in favour of one in 1980‚Äì81. A route looping tightly around the northern boundary of the Mile Oak estate and the rest of the urban area was chosen. Hove Council insisted that the road must run entirely to the north of Mile Oak, rather than passing through it; this pushed the route further north and added engineering complexity, and the Department for Transport stated in 1982 that the budget would have to increase by ¬£5.75 million to accommodate this change. Another disadvantage would be that it would sever Mile Oak Farm's buildings from its farmland. Construction started in 1989, but the section between Mile Oak and Southwick Hill Tunnel was the last to be built, between 1993 and 1995. The whole route opened in April 1996. There are no junctions leading into the estate; access can be obtained via the Hangleton Link Road (A293). The Brighton & Hove bus company run regular services around the Mile Oak estate on routes 1 and 1A. Destinations include Portslade village, Portslade railway station, central Hove, central Brighton, Kemptown, the Royal Sussex County Hospital and Whitehawk. Mile Oak's first bus service began in 1928 and ran from Portslade station to the waterworks. The \\"Mile Oak Shuttle\\", an express service to central Brighton using buses in a special livery, ran from 1982 to 1992. Sport and leisure Mile Oak F.C. were founded in 1960 and play in Division One of the Southern Combination Football League, the tenth tier of the English football league system. They played in the Brighton, Hove & District Football League until 1987, when they moved up to the Sussex County League. Home games are played at Mile Oak Recreation Ground, which has been equipped with floodlights since 1996. Mile Oak Wanderers F.C. were formed in 2007 to provide youth football for the boys and girls within the local community. They originally played at Mile Oak Primary School, but since October 2010 all home matches have taken place at Southwick Hill Recreation Ground in Southwick, West Sussex. Portslade Sports Centre is part of the Portslade Aldridge Community Academy complex on Chalky Road. It has two sports halls, four squash courts, two exercise studios, a gymnasium and an all- weather 3G pitch. The building, which opened at a cost of ¬£115,200 in 1973, was designed by architect J. Catchpole.

The film features Vijay and Simran in lead roles, while Vivek, Nassar and Rajesh play other supporting roles. The soundtrack for the film was composed by A. R. Rahman and the background score was by Pravin Mani. The editing was by Raja Mohammad, and the cinematography was by Priyan. Plot Udhayakumaran (Vijay) is a college student who does research on subatomic physics. He is offered a research position at Princeton University due to his ground-breaking research papers. However, he declines the offer and becomes a lecturer in his college, where he meets Vasanthi (Simran), and they fall in love with each other. Udhaya later comes to know that she has already been engaged and decides to move to another city. With the help of Basheer (Vivek), he finds a job as a reporter in Chennai. Unfortunately, Basheer dies in a bomb blast, and Udhaya unwittingly gets to meet the people responsible for Basheer's death, who introduce him to their boss Dhananjay Veeran (Nassar), who poses as a crusader with veiled intentions. Udhaya sympathizes with the crusaders and helps build an instrument to break granite slabs, aiding manual labor. Later, he builds a bomb born out of his research and gives it to Veeran to help their cause in supporting laborers. However, Veeran uses the bomb on a train without Udhaya's knowledge, killing many innocent people and framing Udhaya for the bomb blast, who is further arrested for a crime he did not commit. En route from the court, the police vehicle is caught in a puddle, and Udhaya gets a chance to escape. On the run, he stumbles upon Veeran and his accomplice discussing a plot to bomb a school bus, and then, he comes to the realization that Veeran is the culprit. Udhaya manages to save the school kids from the explosion. Veeran arrives and attempts to shoot Udhaya. A fight ensues in which Veeran is thrown into the flames of the wreckage.

He played a part in helping Nazi sympathisers and war criminals escape prosecution in Europe by easing their passage to South America. Biography Caggiano was born in Coronda, Santa Fe Province. He studied in the seminary of Santa Fe and became a priest there in 1908, at the age of 23. From 1913 to 1931 he taught at the seminary. In the 1920s he was sent to Rome by the Argentine episcopacy, together with three other priests, in order to study the organization of the Azione Cattolica (the Italian Catholic Action). The Argentine Catholic Action was founded in 1931 following this model. Caggiano was appointed the first bishop of the newly erected Diocese of Rosario on 13 September 1934, for which he was consecrated on 14 March 1935. Pope Pius XII elevated him to Cardinal on 18 February 1946. In his 2002 book The Real OdessaFrom the 'Per√≥n tapes' he recorded the year before his death, published in Yo, Domingo Per√≥n, Luca de Tena et al.; this translation as quoted in Uki Go√±i's The Real Odessa: Smuggling the Nazis to Per√≥n's Argentina, Granta (revised edition) 2003, p. 100 Uki Go√±i showed that Argentine diplomats and intelligence officers had, on Per√≥n's instructions, vigorously encouraged Nazi and Fascist war criminals to make their home in Argentina. Argentina's first move into Nazi smuggling was in January 1946, when Caggiano flew with Bishop Agust√≠n Barr√©re to Rome where Caggiano was due to be created cardinal. While in Rome, the Argentine bishops met with French Cardinal Eug√®ne Tisserant, where they passed on a message (recorded in Argentina's diplomatic archives) that \\"the Government of the Argentine Republic was willing to receive French persons, whose political attitude during the recent war would expose them, should they return to France, to harsh measures and private revenge\\". Over the spring of 1946 a number of French war criminals, fascists and Vichy officials made it from Italy to Argentina in the same way: they were issued passports by the Rome ICRC office; these were then stamped with Argentine tourist visas (the need for health certificates and return tickets was waived on Caggiano's recommendation). The first documented case of a French war criminal arriving in Buenos Aires was Emile Dewoitine, who was later sentenced in absentia to 20 years hard labour. He sailed first class on the same ship back with Cardinal Caggiano.Go√±i, The Real Odessa: Smuggling the Nazis to Per√≥n's Argentina, Granta (revised edition) 2003, pp. 96‚Äì98Uki Go√±i, The Real Odessa, Granta, London, 2002, and La Odessa que cre√≥ Per√≥n, Pagina/12, 15 December 2002 quote: \\"el cardenal Caggiano viaj√≥ al Vaticano en 1946 y ofreci√≥ en nombre del gobierno argentino al pa√≠s como refugio de los criminales de guerra franceses escondidos en Roma.\\" He participated in the 1958 and 1963 Papal conclaves, but his age prevented him from participating in the conclaves of 1978. On 15 August 1959 he was appointed Archbishop of Buenos Aires. He was installed there on 25 October. On 14 December of that year he was also appointed head of the Military Ordinariate of Argentina. Caggiano retired from the Archbishopric on 22 April 1975, and resigned from the Military Ordinariate on 7 July of the same year. He was the Archbishop Emeritus of Buenos Aires for four more years. He died in 1979, at the age of 90, and was buried in the Metropolitan Cathedral of Buenos Aires. Views =Le Marxisme-L√©ninisme= In 1961, Caggiano wrote a prologue for the Spanish translation by Juan Francisco Guevara (who later became a colonel) of Le Marxisme-l√©ninisme, written by Jean Ousset, private secretary of monarchist intellectual Charles Maurras, and founder of the Cit√© catholique fundamentalist organization. The book states that Marxism‚ÄìLeninism can be successfully combated only by a \\"profound faith, an unlimited obedience to the Holy Father, and a thorough knowledge of the Church's doctrines\\"; and Caggiano thanked the \\"men of La Ciudad Cat√≥lica of Argentina\\" for publishing the book.Quoted by Horacio Verbitsky, in The Silence, extract transl. in English made available by openDemocracy: Breaking the silence: the Catholic Church in Argentina and the \\"dirty war\\" , July 28, 2005, p.4 Along with Colonel Jean Gardes, French expert in psychological warfare, Ousset developed the new concept of \\"subversion\\". According to Horacio Verbitsky, who does not say that it was expounded in the book, this concept \\"conceived a protean, quintessential enemy who, rather than being defined by his actions, was seen as a force trying to subvert Christian order, natural law or the Creator's plan.\\"Verbitsky, ibid., p. 3 Verbitsky also says that the Cit√© catholique included members of the OAS terrorist group founded in Madrid during the Algerian War, and that the first branch outside France was created in 1958 in Argentina.Verbitsky, ibid., p. 3 In this prologue, Caggiano explained that Marxism is born of \\"the negation of Christ and his Church put into practice by the Revolution\\" and spoke of a Marxist conspiracy to take over the world, for which it was necessary to \\"prepare for the decisive battle,\\" although the enemy had not yet \\"taken up arms.\\" Caggiano compared this vigilance to the one that preceded the 1571 Battle of Lepanto \\"to save Europe from domination by the Turks\\". Ousset's book included a list of the papal bulls condemning communism. On this basis, Verbitsky, a member of the Montoneros, attributed to Caggiano support for human rights violations, commenting: \\"As often happens in a continent that imports ideas, the doctrine of annihilation preceded that of the revolutionary uprising.\\" =Counter- insurgency= In October 1961, Caggiano, who was then vicar (not head) of the Argentine Military Ordinariate, participated in the inauguration ceremony of the first course on counter-revolutionary warfare in the Higher Military College at the side of President Arturo Frondizi, who within a few months was ousted, accused, Verbitsky says, of being too tolerant towards communism. Verbitsky says that Bishop Victorio Bonam√≠n, Caggiano's associate in the military vicariate general, was one of the instructors in the course, but not Caggiano himself. He also says that in the course of counter-insurgency classes cadets at the Navy Mechanics School were shown the film The Battle of Algiers (1966), made by Italian communist director Gillo Pontecorvo. The film, which was censored in France, showed the methods used by the French colonial army in Algeria, including the systemic use of torture. The naval chaplain (again, not Caggiano) introduced the film and added a commentary from the religious point of view, reportedly justifying the use of torture as a weapon.

At the time of his death McKusick worked at the firm Pierce Atwood in Portland, Maine as of Counsel. His most prominent rulings included Connecticut v. New Hampshire, Kansas v. Nebraska and Colorado and Louisiana v. Mississippi. McKusick began practicing law with Pierce Atwood in 1952. For twenty-five years‚Äîuntil he was appointed by Governor James B. Longley as Maine's Chief Justice‚ÄîMcKusick engaged in general practice with the firm.Profile, martindale.com; accessed December 9, 2014. Prior to joining Pierce Atwood in 1952, McKusick served successively as law clerk to Chief Judge Learned Hand of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and to Justice Felix Frankfurter of the United States Supreme Court. From 1943 to 1946, he served in the U.S. Army, in part in Los Alamos, New Mexico, participating in the Manhattan Project. Education McKusick received his A.B. degree from Bates College (1943), his S.B. and S.M. from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (1947), and his LL.B. from Harvard Law School (1950), where he served as President of the Harvard Law Review. Chief Justice In 1977, Governor Longley appointed McKusick Chief Justice of the Maine Supreme Judicial Court, the first such appointment directly from the bar since the appointment of Chief Justice Prentiss Mellen in 1820. Chief Justice McKusick had responsibility for managing Maine's entire court system as well as for presiding over its highest appellate court. Over the years, he had been deeply involved in modernizing the rules of procedure for the Maine courts, serving on rules committees appointed by the Supreme Judicial Court and co- authoring two editions of the classic work on Maine Civil Practice. For his public service in the courts, McKusick received the American Judicature Society's Herbert Harley Award in 1982 and the Neal W. Allen Award for Community Leadership of the Greater Portland Chamber of Commerce in 1988. In 1991, Cumberland County named its newly expanded courthouse for the Chief Justice. Vincent was the 1999 recipient of the National Center for State Court's Paul C. Reardon Award given to those who have made outstanding contributions to the administration of justice nationally and to the work of the National Center. During 1990-91, his fellow chief justices elected McKusick President of the National Conference of Chief Justices and Chairman of the Board of Directors of the National Center for State Courts. He has served and continues to serve on the council of the American Law Institute, and also has served on the governing boards of the American Philosophical Society, the American Arbitration Association, and the U.S. Supreme Court Historical Society. Since his retirement on February 28, 1992, McKusick has served \\"of counsel\\" to Pierce Atwood. In July 1992, he served on a pro bono basis as the neutral arbitrator for the determination of the terms under which Long Island would separate from the City of Portland. By appointment of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, Vincent served in 1995-96 as Master in the liquidation of American Mutual Liability Insurance Co. and an affiliate. Among numerous arbitrations conducted by him since retirement from the Court, he served in 1996 as the neutral arbitrator in San Francisco in a substantial contract dispute between a major public utility and an independent power marketer. In recent years he has successfully mediated a dispute over the disposition of the proceeds from the sale of two not-for-profit hospitals in Massachusetts, as well as a legal malpractice claim of a government agency against a large international law firm. Currently he is engaged in further substantial commercial arbitrations for the American Arbitration Association. Late in 1992, he led a small State Department delegation to the Republic of Georgia to advise on court reform, and by President George H. W. Bush's appointment he served from 1993 to 2001 as one of the five members of the Committee to Administer the Oliver Wendell Holmes Devise.

He also posed as an Emmy Award accepter. Bremen was a self-proclaimed jock who regularly played touch football, basketball, and softball. His wife Margo, in a 1980 People magazine profile of the imposter, said Bremen was \\"fulfilling a grand fantasy to be in the limelight. He feels if you have no guts you have no glory in your life.\\" His advice to other impostors: \\"Don't do it. It's against the law. Stay away. This is my act.\\"  Sports impersonations  = Basketball = The stunt that started it all was on February 4, 1979, when Bremen donned a Kansas City Kings uniform and got onto the floor during pre-game warmups for the NBA All-Star Game at the Pontiac Silverdome. (He was outed by genuine All- Star Otis Birdsong, who really did play for Kansas City: \\"You're on my team, and I don't even know who you is.\\") Bremen repeated that act in a Houston Rockets uniform at the 1981 All-Star Game at the Richfield Coliseum. Later that season, he donned an officials' jacket and stood with the real officials, Earl Strom, Paul Mihalak and alternate Joe Gushue, during the national anthem prior to Game 5 of the World Championship Series at the Boston Garden. = Baseball = On July 17, 1979, with the help of telecaster Dick Schaap and Kansas City Royals third basemen George Brett, Bremen snuck onto the field dressed in a New York Yankees uniform at the Major League Baseball All-Star Game, held at the Seattle Kingdome. Bremen shagged flies in the outfield for a half-hour and attempted to pose for a group picture with future Hall of Famers Brett, Reggie Jackson, Joe Morgan, Mike Schmidt, Gaylord Perry, Dave Winfield, Steve Carlton, Nolan Ryan, Carl Yastrzemski, Lou Brock, and Tommy Lasorda. Bremen was finally spotted and ushered off the field. He tried again, hiding out in the Mariners clubhouse whirlpool bath, until Seattle Mariners (and AL) trainer Gary Nicholson had him ejected from the premises. Bremen dressed as an umpire at a 1980 World Series game and he walked out to home plate with actual umpires Harry Wendelstedt (NL), Don Denkinger (AL), Paul Pryor (NL), Bill Kunkel (AL), Dutch Rennert (NL), and Nick Bremigan before he was discovered. In 1986, wearing a New York Mets uniform, Bremen again shagged flies in the outfield during the All-Star pre-game at the Houston Astrodome, when he was discovered and berated by NL All Star coach, then LA Dodgers manager Tommy Lasorda. After, Bremen was quoted as saying he was treated so poorly in jail that the all-star game stunt would be his last, and it was.http://dodgersway.com/2013/02/05/top-ten-tommy-lasorda-moments-10-tommy- busts-imposter-at-1986-all-star-game/ = Football = On December 16, 1979, Bremen posed as a Dallas Cowboys cheerleader at a Cowboys-Redskins game held at Texas Stadium in Irving, Texas. In preparation, Bremen lost twenty-three pounds, practiced drag routines with his wife, had a replica Dallas Cowboys cheerleader uniform custom-made, shaved his legs and bankrolled the project with $1,200 of his own money. During the game, Bremen burst onto the sidelines in boots, hot pants, falsies and a blond wig. He got out only one cheer ‚Äî \\"Go Dallas!\\" ‚Äî before Cowboy security had him hogtied and handcuffed. The Cowboys hit Bremen with a $5,000 lawsuit for trespassing and creating a nuisance, and petitioned to have him banned from Cowboy games for life.

In 1982, Bremen, dressed as the San Diego Chicken, was stopped from entering Super Bowl XVI at the Pontiac Silverdome. = Golf = At the 1979 U.S. Open, Bremen (who had a 7 handicap) sneaked on to Inverness Club in Toledo, Ohio, and played a practice round with Wayne Levi and Jerry Pate. He returned for an encore at the 1980 U.S. Open at the Baltusrol Golf Club, where he played so poorly in a practice round that a spectator asked the United States Golf Association's P.J. Boatwright, Jr. how such a lousy golfer had made it through qualifying. In 1985, Bremen played a practice round with Fred Couples, Jay Haas, and Curtis Strange at the U.S. Open at the Oakland Hills Country Club in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan. Scouting the course early in the week, Bremen was introduced to Couples, then an up-and-coming pro. \\"I had a great chuckle with him,\\" Couples said. \\"[Bremen] said, 'Obviously, I can't tee off with you, but I'll find you out there.'\\" A friend of Bremen's ‚Äî an Oakland Hills member ‚Äî smuggled Bremen's clubs and caddie into the club. Bremen, wearing a disguise and claiming to be a qualifier named Mark Diamond, went in search of Couples, who was playing a practice round with Haas. Couples remembers: At the 10th hole, Strange and Bob Eastwood joined the group. \\"We played as a fivesome. That's when I got a little nervous,\\" Bremen said. \\"All they said was, 'We don't mind you playing as long as you keep the ball in play.\\" Bremen claimed to have shot a 77. Bremen said that out of all of his stunts, he was proudest of his golf antics. \\"I was out there for the longest time,\\" he said proudly, \\"and I was never caught.\\"  Emmy Awards  At the 1985 Emmy Awards in Pasadena, Bremen suddenly arose from a front-row seat and accepted from a confused Peter Graves a Best Supporting Actress award for Hill Street Blues actress Betty Thomas. Bremen was arrested and fined $175 for his stunt. He later apologized to Thomas, telling her he had really thought she wasn't there to accept her award.  Fame and Notoriety  Due to his Great Imposter successes, Bremen became a celebrity in his own right in the '80's and made a number of TV appearances, including The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson, Late Night with David Letterman, and was anointed Sportsman Of The Week, twice, by Dick Schaap on The Today Show. He was interviewed in People Magazine, Parade Magazine, and by George Plimpton, among others. ESPN Films In November 2013, director Matt Dilmore's short documentary, The Great Imposter, debuted as part of ESPN Films' 30-for-30 shorts series. The 10-minute film stands as an oral history of Bremen's exploits and features interviews with members of the Bremen family as well as baseball great George Brett and sports reporter Jeremy Schaap. The film was aired online on Grantland.com and was reportedly instrumental in 30 for 30 Shorts winning an Emmy Award in 2014.  \\"Retirement\\" and death  In 2005, Bremen claimed to be retired from gatecrashing (\\"You've heard of the Taser gun? You've heard of 9/11? They don't ask questions anymore.\\") but he didn't rule out a final bow at a future U.S. Senior Open. \\"Could there be an opportunity when I'm 60? Yeah,\\" he said, although when he later did turn 60, he was not reported to have attempted any impersonations. Bremen died of esophageal cancer on his 64th birthday, leaving behind his wife Margo and three children.  References  ; Footnotes ; Sources * Not-So-Great Moments in Sports, HBO Home Video, 1988.

However, the more specific meaning indicates the growth is weak and insufficient to provide jobs for those entering the labor market (see the Hoisington and Hunt reference). There may also be a third meaning referring to growth in which more jobs are actually being destroyed than created. In all cases, the term indicates, Real GDP is expanding (slowly) but with job contraction, so the economy behaves or feels in many ways like a recession. A Soft Landing tends to also be a Growth Recession, but this is not always the case.

The remains of Byllis are situated north-east of Vlor√´, 25 kilometers from the sea in Hekal, Fier County, Albania. Stephanus of Byzantium mentions a town called Byllis as a seaside city in Illyria and its foundation legend, according to which the city was built by Myrmidons under Neoptolemus, returning from the Trojan War. This legendary tradition is reflected also by numismatics. The city was located on the territory of the Illyrian tribe of Bylliones. The massive walls of Byllis were built before the end of the 4th century, and literary sources report them as an Illyrian rather than Epirote or Macedonian foundation. Later Byllis acquired the trappings of a Hellenistic town, and because the southernmost Illyrian tribes, including the Bylliones, were inclined to become bilingual, it was also a Greek-speaking city. The Bylliones were first attested in the mid-4th century BC, in the description of the geographer Pseudo-Scylax, and also asking the oracle of Dodona to which god they should sacrifice in order to ensure the safety of their possessions. The archaeological attestation of the city is possible as far back as the second half of the 4th century BC and was later conquered by Pyrrhus.Pyrrhus King of Epirus Petros Garouphalias Byllis received sacred Greek envoys, known as theoroi during the early 2nd century BC, which seems to indicate that it was a Greek city, or that its inhabitants had become Greek-speaking.Peter Allan Hansen. Carmina epigraphica Graeca. Novus Eboracus, 1983. , p. 295: \\"Sacred envoys from Greek sanctuaries visited Greek cities only: Dyrrachium, Apollonia, Oricum, Amantia and Byllis (BCH 45 [1921], 1f.), from which it appears that Byllis was a Greek city, founded probably by Pyrrhus, or that its citizens, the Byllideis, had become Greek-speaking.\\". The city Byllis, being a Greek-speaking city,Tom Winnifrith. Perspectives on Albania. Macmillan, 1992. , p. 37: The southernmost Illyrian tribes tended to become bilingual. Thus Byllis, the largest city in the territory of the Illyrian Bylliones, was a Greek-speaking city, visited by Greek envoys from the shrines of Greece. on the borders of Illyria and Epirus, had its own stadium and theatre during the Hellenistic era.Tom Winnifrith. Badlands, borderlands: a history of Northern Epirus/Southern Albania. Duckworth, 2002. , p. 58 About its foundation it has been suggested that Byllis was founded by Greek settlers. The predominantly Greek character of the city is confirmed in the vast majority of the corpus of the names which mainly belong to the northern Greek onomastic area (Alexander, Andriscus, Archelaus, Kebbas, Maketa, Machatas, Nikanor, Peukolaos, Phalakros, Philotas, Drimakos and Alexommas) with an exception of a few Illyrian names (Preuratos, Triteutas, Trasos). The city had its own coinage which was different from that of the tribe of the Bylliones. M. B. Hatzopoulos believes that Byllis is the northernmost non- colonian Greek city in the region.M. B. Hatzopoulos. The Borders of Hellenism in Epirus during Antiquity. Epirus: Ekdotike Athenon, p. 145, 1997. Fanula Papazoglou states that Byllis together with nearby Nikaia were \\"Greek foundations on barbarian territory\\". The walls of Byllis were 2,200m long, enclosing 30 hectares of a plain atop a hill 524m above sea level. There were 6 gates in the city walls. The road coming from Apollonia passed through two of them, crossing Byllis in the direction of the narrows of gorges of the Vjosa river on the way to Macedonia or those of Antigonia in the direction of Epirus. In 2011 during a road reconstruction near the archaeological park found in the site a statue of the Hellenistic era, which may depict an Illyrian soldier or a war deity, was discovered.Fier: Ancient statue discovered in Byllis However, there is little point in proposing an Illyrian label for city in which language, institutions, officials, onomastics, city- planning and fortifications were Greek.

League of the Bylliones The League (Koinon) of the Illyrian tribe of the Bylliones (Ancient Greek: ŒöŒøŒπŒΩ·Ω∏ŒΩ ŒíœÖŒªŒªŒØœâŒΩ), which had been hellenized to a degree and was bilingual,Marjeta ≈†a≈°el Kos. Appian and Illyricum. Narodni muzej Slovenije, 2005, p. 226 was a coalition of one or two poleis,Pleket, H. W. Supplementum Epigraphicum Graecum, Volume XXXIX: 1989. as attested after 232 BC. The league was restricted to Byllis and Nikaea,Robert, L. \\"Discours inaugaural\\", L' Illyrie m√©ridionale et L'√âpire dans l'Antiquit√©, Actes du colloque international de Clermont-Ferrand. Clermont-Ferrand, 1984 , p. 14. and Byllis considered Nikaia as one of its demes. Nikaia was a member of the league, as a 2nd-century BC inscription indicates. The only attestation of the city as polis is in the work of Stephanus of Byzantium in the 6th century. On the other hand, the citizens of Byllis were called Byllideis (). Roman and Byzantine rule Under the Roman Empire, Byllis became part of the province of Epirus Nova. Its name often occurs at the time of the civil wars.e.g., Cicero, Phil. 11.11; Julius Caesar B.C. 3.40. et alii In the time of Pliny the Elder, it was a Roman colony, and was called Colonia Bullidensis. Its territory is called Bylliake (ŒíœÖŒªŒªŒπŒ±Œ∫ŒÆ) by Strabo. The walls of Byllis carry more than four inscriptions written in Greek with details regarding their construction by the engineer Victorinus, as ordered by Emperor Justinian I (483-565).. During the early Christian period Byllis remained an important settlement in Epirus Nova though it was reduced in size. A significant number of basilica churches have been unearthed which contained mosaic floors and various carvings. Two of those basilicas had possibly diaconicon chambers attached, while a baptistery was established at basicila B.  Association with see of Apollonia  One of the participants in the Council of Ephesus in 431 was a Felix who signed once as Bishop of Apollonia and Byllis, at another time as Bishop of Apollonia. Some assume that the two towns formed a single episcopal see, others suppose he was, strictly speaking, Bishop only of Apollonia, but was temporarily in charge also of Byllis during a vacancy of that see. At the Council of Chalcedon in 451, Eusebius subscribes simply as Bishop of Apollonia. In the letter of the bishops of Epirus Nova to the Byzantine Emperor Leo I in 458, Philocharis subscribed as Bishop of what the manuscripts call \\"Vallidus\\", and which editors think should be corrected to \\"Byllis\\". Whether Philocharis is to be considered Bishop also of Apollonia depends on the interpretation of the position of Felix in 431.Daniele Farlati-Jacopo Coleti, Illyricum Sacrum, vol.

It is a part of Columbus City Schools. The school opened in 1976, initially only housing new students in 10th grade. The smaller start allowed the school to get set up properly, and was designed as such so it wouldn't cause inconvenience to upperclassmen who were attending other high schools but lived in Centennial's newly formed attendance area. History At the time the school was built, the surrounding area of Northwest Columbus was experiencing tremendous growth. The need for a new school became apparent as nearby Whetstone High School had become very crowded. A considerable portion of the land around the school was undeveloped at the time of opening, but was rapidly built up in the ensuing years. A rivalry has developed between Centennial and Whetstone due to the splitting of Whetstone's district and the fact that many students in both buildings attended lower grades together. As the building opened in the year of the United States Bicentennial, the building was so named as a patriotic gesture, as was Independence High School, which opened at the same time. At the time of the school's construction, trends in K-12 schooling were moving towards more non-traditional classroom setups. This manifested itself in the architecture and design of the building. When the school opened, there were no walls between almost all of the classrooms (save for the art, music, and science rooms). Rather, movable dividers were employed in a setup similar to what might be found in an office with cubicles. Additionally, both floors of the building were laid out with wings centered around a common area, rather than long and straight corridors. All of these elements were designed to increase interaction between classrooms and promote learning. Additionally, the lockers were formerly painted a bright orange color, which was thought to have a positive psychological effect for learning. \\"The Galaxy\\" student section cheering on their basketball team at home. In 1997, the school was threatened with closure, as it was stated by the Columbus school board that the building was operating far below capacity with approximately 550 students. This provoked a large public outcry, and it was later discovered that the capacity of 900 students as originally assumed was overstated. It was revised downward to approximately 750 pupils, but in recent years the school has had approximately 850 students attending due to its good reputation. Design With the 1973 oil crisis weighing on the minds of the designers, energy efficiency was a top priority in the design of the building. Because of this, the school has very few windows, and the few windows that do exist are found in only a handful of classrooms. However, one benefit of this is that most classrooms need not evacuate to another location in the event of a tornado. For a school that was designed to hold approximately 800-900 students, the auditorium is especially small, seating only 250 people. In the original design, an indoor swimming pool was to be added in a wing on the north side of the building. Although the area was excavated for a pool, it became the vocal music room instead when costs needed to be scaled back. It is especially unusual in that one must walk downstairs to get to it in a building which otherwise has no publicly accessible basement. With the exception of the aforementioned vocal music room, the entire building is fully wheelchair accessible, despite having been built 15 years before the Americans with Disabilities Act came into force. An outdoor amphitheater is integrated into the facade of the building on the northeast side. After a few years, it was decided that the hassle of dealing with noise transmission between classrooms wasn't worth the positive effects of collaboration. Walls were built to divide the classrooms in 1980, and remain today. Because the school was designed to be open, adding walls where needed has the unintentional effect of making the building especially difficult to navigate. It is easy to spot the walls that were subsequently added, as all the permanent walls in the building as originally built are concrete block, while those added later are made of drywall. Additionally, to cut costs, the ceiling tiles and grid were not rebuilt to accommodate the new walls, which makes for a small gap at the top and reduces noise insulation. Some of the lockers were painted a neutral beige color, while others were painted dark blue (one of the school colors). With the Columbus City Schools switch to Middle schools from the Junior High setup, 9th graders began to be admitted in the fall of 1980. Academics U.S. News & World Report ranked Centennial among the top high schools in the country, giving it a silver award. Additionally, the school has consistently received a score of \\"Excellent\\" from the Ohio Department of Education, the highest mark given. The high performance is made more remarkable by the fact that approximately 60% of students fall into the \\"economically disadvantaged\\" category, and 15% have limited English proficiency. Racially, the school is quite balanced, with no group being in the majority. Approximately 39% of students are African-American, 50% are Caucasian, and 11% from other groups such as Asian and Hispanic. These categories do not readily display the diversity present at the school, as there are many students from Eastern Europe, the Middle East, and the Horn of Africa who attend Centennial. Although situated in a prosperous area of Columbus, the boundaries for attending stretch along a narrow corridor towards the south which encompasses a variety of neighborhoods and socioeconomic statuses. The attendance area is bordered by Upper Arlington to the west, Grandview and Victorian Village to the south, Whetstone High School's attendance area to the east, and Worthington to the north. Sports  The Centennial football team playing at Desales High School. Centennial's sports teams include Football, Basketball, Volleyball, Soccer, Baseball, Golf, Wrestling, Softball, Swimming, Track, Cross Country, Cheerleading, Bowling, Lacrosse, and Tennis. The football stadium includes a 400 meter track in addition to a natural grass field. Other facilities include three baseball/softball fields, however only two are used on a regular basis due to the third field's proximity to busy Bethel road and the risks foul balls would cause. Like most other Columbus High Schools (except for Walnut Ridge), Centennial has three tennis courts, although room was provided for a full five (which makes matches go much more quickly). The adjacent area remains an open field with trees at the edge. The school colors are red, white and blue. The school mascot is a Star. Battle For The Olentangy Due to the proximity of the two schools (2.5 miles), Centennial and Whetsone have a very intense sports rivalry. Every football season, in the last week, the two teams take part in the battle for the Olentangy, named after the Olentangy River that separates the two schools.

It is located at the southern end of the island near the entrance to the prison. The first light house on the island was completed in 1854, and served the bay during its time as a Citadel and military prison. It was replaced by a taller ( above mean sea level) concrete tower built in 1909 to the south of the original one which was demolished after it was damaged due to earthquake in 1906. The automation of the lighthouse with a modern beacon took place in 1963, the year Alcatraz closed as the Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary. It is the oldest light station on the island with a modern beacon and is part of the museum on the island. Although when viewed from afar it easily looks the tallest structure on Alcatraz, it is actually shorter than the Alcatraz Water Tower, but as it lies on higher ground it looks much taller. History Original lighthouse Alcatraz Lighthouse, 1909, U.S. Coast Guard Archive Even though the Native Indians of the San Francisco area are stated to be the original settlers on the island (they collected eggs from the large flock of birds that regularly gathered there), Alcatraz got its name during Spanish rule in 1775 when naval officer and explorer Juan de Ayala surveyed the harbor and the San Francisco Bay. Since he observed pelicans in large numbers on the island he named the island as \\"Isla de los Alcatraces\\" meaning the \\"Island of Pelicans\\". The island is separated from the main land by more than . The gold rush and the inherent risk of the choppy waters of the west coast prompted the urgent need for establishing lighthouses. Congress recognized the need and passed suitable acts in the years 1851 and 1852 to build seven lighthouses on the West Coast to guide navigation. The Baltimore firm of Gibbons and Kelly was awarded the contract to build seven lighthouses in California, at Alcatraz Island, Fort Point, Point Pinos, Point Loma, Farallon Island, and Humboldt Bay, and one at Cape Disappointment in Washington state. Equipment were shipped on Oriole, reached San Francisco on January 29, 1853. The Alcatraz Lighthouse was the first to be completed in July 1853, making it the oldest major navigational light on the West Coast. However, the foundation for building the light house had begun much before the equipment reached San Francisco. Alcatraz Light at sunset In the original order placed for supply of the equipment Argand lamps and parabolic reflectors had been specified as the Fresnel lens, created by Augustin Fresnel of France in 1822 was considered very costly at that time. However, the Lighthouse Board which replaced the Fifth Auditor of the Treasury's control, decided to install Fresnel lenses in all lighthouses considering its established better performance, even though the cost was high. The Baltimore firm was informed of this change before the equipment was shipped. The shipping involved a long sea voyage of from the East Coast going round the cape of South America. It was lit on June 1, 1854, from a fixed, third-order Fresnel lens. In 1902, it was transferred to the Cape St. Elias Lighthouse in Alaska and replaced by a revolving fourth-order Fresnel lens, producing a white flash every five seconds. In 1909‚Äì12, the present cell house of Alcatraz was built. Since the new structure would interfere with the operation of the lighthouse, a taller , concrete tower was built south of the original lighthouse. The original lighthouse had been damaged during the great San Francisco earthquake of 1906 and was eventually torn down. In 1963, the Alcatraz Lighthouse was automated by the United States Coast Guard. In 1970 a fire destroyed the warden's house, the keepers' quarters and other buildings on the island. The only remaining building is the tall cement tower equipped with a modern beacon. The lighthouse has been a museum since 2000 and can be visited. In over 50 years, the lighthouse has not been seriously damaged despite many prison escapes, the Battle of Alcatraz and fires. Structural details left Alcatraz Lighthouse, 2007 The first lighthouse was in height, and was based on a design that was typical of early \\"Cape Cod style\\" lighthouses, in which the light tower was an integral part of the keeper's house, and was centered atop the dwelling's roof. Construction of the foundation started in 1852, and the one-and-a-half-storied keeper's house and light were completed in 1853. The lens arrived in October 1853 and Michael Cassin lit it on June 1, 1854, thus setting a \\"milestone\\" of sorts for this lighthouse, as the first lighthouse on the Pacific Coast. The old lighthouse was damaged in the earthquake which occurred on Wednesday the April 18, 1906. A new lighthouse was built to the south east of the old one. The old lighthouse existed alongside the new structure for a while and used as a storehouse, but was eventually demolished between 1912 and 1913. The existing lighthouse is built to a height of , above sea level, to the south of the original lighthouse. Its foundation is made of masonry while the octagonal pyramidal shaped tower is made of concrete. Initially, a third order Fresnel reflector was installed in 1854, and was replaced by a fourth order reflector in 1903. The foghorn bell was replaced by electronic Klaxon. Near the base of the tower was family accommodation also built to house three keepers and their families. Similar \\"Cape-cod style\\" lighthouses, encircling the thick light brick tower, were built at Point Loma in San Diego, Point Pinos near Monterey and also on the Southeast Farallon Island about west of the San Francisco Strait. Coastguard building blueprint There was also a telephone installed, in the 1930, in the keepers quarters (moved to the hall later) known to and accessed only by the keepers. When the Federal Penitentiary was established on the island more telephones were installed and was made accessible to others also. The lighthouse was operated and maintained by the keepers whose responsibility included operation of fog signals found located on the northern and southern tips of the island. The prison guards facilitated the keepers to blow the fog horns as they were in advantageous position stationed on the elevated watch towers; the guards who were in position to see \\"a bank of fog started to roll through the Golden Gate\\", would inform notify the keepers so that the fog horns could be activated. =Navigation aids= The leading marks which guide the ships while entering the island are the lime point which is east and the black point which is lime north. The island itself is interspersed with several buildings and military towers. The highest point of the island is where the light house is located. Northwestern and southeastern tips of the island have small buildings which housed the fog signals (the electric horns were installed in small buildings known as \\"mid twentieth century foghorn shacks\\".). The white light is shown by a grey tower flashes white that lasts for 0.5 seconds and eclipses' for 4.5 seconds and forming with the Fort Point light House a range for crossing the bar for the main ship. Fog signals are electric sirens, one on the southeast end sounding two blasts of 4 seconds duration, every 30 seconds while the one on the northwest end gives a single blast every 20 seconds of 5 seconds duration. Keepers The three lighthouse keepers, known as \\"wickies\\", were dressed in prescribed formal uniforms which consisted of a \\"navy blue hat, sack coat, vest and trousers\\". Decorative buttons and insignia patches adorned their uniforms. The keepers worked on an eight-hour shift with the beacon lighted all through the year; during day time the lens was covered and protected from sun rays.

History  Calaveras, in Spanish, means \\"skulls\\". The original members of the trio in the 1930s were Guillermo Bermejo (died 2002), his brother Miguel Bermejo (died 1996) and Ra√∫l Prado (died 1989). Guillermo Bermejo left the Trio and moved to Argentina in 1945 his brother replaced him with Pepe Saldivar (died 1975). There are conflicting rumors that Prado had a brief marriage with Mexican actress Mar√≠a F√©lix, but no concrete evidence has emerged that the marriage ever took place. Most of the rumors agree in claiming that Prado and F√©lix allegedly got married in 1943 after meeting on the set of The Rock of Souls and separated two months after the wedding. Mexican writer Enrique Serna interviewed the last survivor of the trio, Miguel Bermejo, who told him he was a witness to the wedding. Prado's niece Mar√≠a Escalera also corroborated the marriage, saying that the marriage ended when Agust√≠n Lara sent F√©lix a white piano as a gift, and \\"Ra√∫l threw her out ‚Äî with the piano.

It is known that F√©lix vehemently denied ever having married Prado. Serna, who also interviewed F√©lix, said \\"On our first meeting I asked her about her marriage to Ra√∫l Prado (which she denied until the end) [...] and she told me that if I was going to go on with those lies, we were not going to be able to work on the book.\\"  References  General references * Mexico y Su M√∫sica Roberto Villoro 1967 Inline citations External links *Official web site Category:Mexican musical groups ","title":"Tr√≠o Calaveras"},{"id":"6684612","text":"Jousting is a medieval sport.

The stadium was home to the Montreal Royals of the International League, as the top farm club of the Brooklyn Dodgers from 1928 to 1960. The stadium was additionally home to the Montreal Alouettes of the Canadian Football League (CFL) from 1946 to 1953. History Delorimier Downs, as it was originally called, was built by former Major League Baseball manager George Stallings, Montreal lawyer and politician Athanase David, and Montreal businessman Ernest Savard. Among the stadium's other local affluent financiers were close friends Lucien Beauregard, Romeo Gauvreau, Hector H. Racine, and Charles E. Trudeau. The stadium opened in May 1928 following a parade and a large inauguration ceremony. Royals' general manager Frank Shaughnessy had a lighting system installed in the stadium for the 1933 season. Delorimier Stadium, circa 1933. The stadium saw the launching of the baseball career of Gene Mauch, who later came back to manage the Montreal Expos, plus future Hall of Fame members Sparky Anderson, Roberto Clemente and Jackie Robinson, the latter debuting in professional baseball with the Montreal Royals in 1946, and who went on to break baseball's color barrier with the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1947. Other Royals' players of note include player-turned-actor Chuck Connors and Hall of Fame members Duke Snider, Don Drysdale, Walter Alston, Roy Campanella and Tommy Lasorda. The Montreal Alouettes were founded in 1946 and played there to capacity crowds until 1953 when the team moved to larger facilities. It is where Canadian Football Hall of Fame quarterback Sam Etcheverry made his CFL debut. In 1951, several association football teams toured North America. Celtic played an exhibition match at Delorimier Stadium on May 20 against Fulham. In 1957 Celtic returned to Delorimier for a June 9 exhibition match against Tottenham Hotspur. Although six years apart, on both occasions the ticket price was 15¬¢.Celtic Programmes Online - Tours of the USA and Canada Delorimier Stadium was also the site of a number of professional boxing and wrestling matches.

Other bordering streets were Parthenais Street (north, right field); Lariviere Street (west, left field); and De Lorimier Avenue (south, third base). The outfield was basically rectangular. There are some uncertainties about the precise dimensions of the outfield: *The book Baseball's Fabulous Montreal Royals, by William Brown, Robert Davies Publishing, Montreal, 1996, p.28, has the left field line as , center field , and right field line , with a wall high surrounding the outfield. *The book Green Cathedral, by Phil Lowrey (several editions) has left field as , center field , and right field . *The Baltimore Sun for May 2, 1935, p.30, has a drawing comparing Oriole Park's dimensions with those of the Montreal ballpark. The article has it as left field , center field , and right field . Legacy After the Montreal Royals disbanded in 1960, the stadium saw limited use. It was briefly considered as a home for the major league Expos when that team launched in 1969. However, it could not be renovated or expanded because it was in the middle of a residential area, and was thus deemed unsuitable even for temporary use. It was eventually torn down. Prior to the demolition of the stadium, the building was torn down in bits, and the interior was used to house makeshift classrooms by the Montreal Catholic School Commission as the student population in Quebec grew rapidly in the late 1960s). There is a small stone memorial surrounded by a red batting cage at the corner of the park at Ontario and Delorimier with a bronze plaque honouring Jackie Robinson's accomplishments.

Players guide a robot called \\"Slambird\\" through nine different scenarios to complete several objectives. The game was noted for its use of voxel-based graphics for its environments rather than the polygonal models which were standard at the time of its release. Developed by Lemon, Amok began as a technology demo for the Sega 32X, but was reworked for the Saturn after Sega discontinued support for the 32X. Story Taking place on the planet Amok, a company war has been raging on for 47 years straight. However, upon the 47th year, a peace treaty was finally put into effect and both warring sides ceased fire. Unbeknownst to them is The Bureau, an underground collection of Arms Dealers who were benefiting from the constant weapon sales. The Bureau starts a plan to keep the war going by striking the heart of a strong military compound and research center on the island of Falster. By employing the mercenary mech-pilot Gert Staun - commandeering their latest light ground-sea mech, the Slam Bird - does the Bureau hope to achieve their ultimate goal. Gameplay The gameplay follows a seek and destroy format, where the player must destroy certain structures with a cannon that is attached to the Slambird robot. Enemies such as sharks, robots and structures can only be destroyed with the cannon. However, some enemies can be destroyed by simply walking into or over them, mostly foot soldiers and mines (though if mines are swam into, the Slambird endures damage). The game's levels include both underwater and land areas. In the underwater mode, propellers guide the Slambird Robot. Underwater and land are no different in control, except that the propeller mode fires torpedoes instead of missiles, although they both have the same firing speed, damage and firing rate. Missiles, heavy missiles and bombs can also be fired by the robot, and at the end a special power gun is found to fight Svinet 17. The game contains many different enemy types. These enemies are split into two groups - non-corporation enemies and corporation enemies. The non-corporation enemies are enemies that have not been developed to destroy the robot by the corporation, such as the bat, the steeljaw rat and the huge ant that can be found in the later missions. The corporation enemies are grunts and machines that have been developed to kill the Slambird Robot; these include the \\"Grunt,\\" \\"Scuba Grunts,\\" and various robots and flying objects. The final enemy, \\"Svinet 17\\", is a scorpion-shaped robot that must be defeated to finish the game, and it is the most powerful of all the enemies: it can only be killed using the special weapon provided in the last level. Amok includes both cooperative and deathmatch two-player modes via split screen. Reception The Saturn version was met with a range of responses. The most common criticism was that the gameplay in single-player mode is too routine to engage the player, though those critics who commented on the multiplayer mode said that it is much deeper than the single-player. The most common subjects of praise were the easy controls and the unique look of the voxel-based graphics. However, Air Hendrix of GamePro disagreed on the latter subject, remarking that \\"the muddy, chunky graphics and boring sounds never provide an interesting environment.\\" Jeff Gerstmann of GameSpot also gave the game a fairly dismal assessment, saying it lacks the freshness and fun of most mech games, and that fans of the genre should save their money for the soon- to-be-released console versions of MechWarrior 2. Most of Electronic Gaming Monthlys four reviewers likewise said that the impressive graphics and stylistics are outweighed by shallow gameplay. Crispin Boyer elaborated, \\"You wander through the game's nine levels blowing stuff up, and that's about it. You don't have to worry about strategy - other than knowing when to shoot at the bad guys and when to run like hell.\\" Sushi-X disagreed with his three co- reviewers, deeming Amok \\"a rock-solid 3-D action title with a nice mix of strategy\\". Rich Leadbetter gave the game an outright laudatory review in Sega Saturn Magazine, making particular note of how failing certain secondary tasks changes the progression of the mission. He concluded that while the high difficulty and unusual look may initially puts players off, \\"Give it some time though and you can't help but get drawn into this deep, compelling blasting game.\\" References External links * Category:1996 video games Category:Action video games Category:Cooperative video games Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games Category:Sega Saturn games Category:Split-screen multiplayer games Category:Windows games Category:Video games scored by Jesper Kyd Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Video games with voxel graphics ","title":"Amok (video game)"},{"id":"6684671","text":"Lawrence D.

It stars Tony Curtis, Janet Leigh, David Farrar, Herbert Marshall, and Torin Thatcher. The screenplay was adapted by Oscar Brodney and is based on Howard Pyle's 1891 novel Men of Iron. The original music score was composed by Hans J. Salter. The film was Universal-International's first feature made in CinemaScope. It opened in New York City's Times Square on October 6, 1954 at the Loew's State Theater. It was the second of five feature films in which husband and wife Tony Curtis and Janet Leigh appeared together on screen during their marriage (1952-1961). Plot Myles Falworth (Tony Curtis) and his sister Meg (Barbara Rush) live in obscurity on a farm in Crisbey-Dale with their guardian Diccon Bowman (Rhys Williams). This is to protect them from the attainder placed upon their family by King Henry IV of England (Ian Keith) because their father has been (falsely) accused of treason and murdered by the Earl of Alban (David Farrar). When a hunting party comprising the Earl of Alban, the lord of Crisbey-Dale, and another nobleman, Sir Robert, stop at their farm for refreshment, they are repulsed by Myles, who stops them from molesting his sister. This confrontation accelerates Diccon's plans to send them to Mackworth Castle in Derbyshire (based on the eponymous castle), so that they can come under the protection of William, The Earl of Mackworth (Herbert Marshall), a close friend of Myles and Meg's father. In Myles he sees the man who can finally rid England of the evil machinations of the Earl of Alban. Myles is first trained to be a squire, then as a knight, and is finally knighted by the king. He is successful in killing the Earl of Alban in a trial by combat, foiling Alban's attempt to seize the English crown. Myles, having fallen in love with the Earl of Mackworth's daughter while staying at the castle, is finally able to propose marriage to the Lady Anne (Janet Leigh) after he has proven his mettle. The Earl gives his hearty consent, and the two families are joined. Cast False quotation The film is famous for an apocryphal line, attributed to Tony Curtis and rendered as \\"Yonda stands da castle of my fodda\\" or similar. The plot details above show that this would not fit the story: there is no \\"castle of my father\\". The line is said to have come from a remark made by Debbie Reynolds on television.Harry Purvis and Clyde Gilmour, Leisure Ways magazine, 1980s. Life magazine attributed the line to Curtis while performing in the 1951 film The Prince Who Was a Thief.

It was a small component of the roles of Nordic countries in World War II. In April 1940, the United Kingdom occupied the strategically important Faroe Islands to forestall a German invasion. British troops left shortly after the end of the war.  Occupation  Map of the Faroe Islands At the time of the occupation, the Faroe Islands had the status of an amt (county) of Denmark. Following the invasion and occupation of Denmark on 9 April 1940, British forces launched Operation Valentine to occupy the Faroe Islands. On 11 April, Winston Churchill ‚Äî then First Lord of the Admiralty ‚Äî announced to the House of Commons that the Faroe Islands would be occupied: > We are also at this moment occupying the Faroe Islands, which belong to > Denmark and which are a strategic point of high importance, and whose people > showed every disposition to receive us with warm regard. We shall shield the > Faroe Islands from all the severities of war and establish ourselves there > conveniently by sea and air until the moment comes when they will be handed > back to Denmark liberated from the foul thraldom into which they have been > plunged by German aggression. An announcement was broadcast on BBC radio. An aircraft of the Royal Air Force (RAF) was seen over the Faroese capital T√≥rshavn on the same day. On 12 April, two destroyers of the Royal Navy arrived in T√≥rshavn harbour. Following a meeting with Carl Aage Hilbert (the Danish Prefect of the Islands) and Kristian Djurhuus (President of the L√∏gting, the Faroese Parliament), an emergency meeting of the L√∏gting was convened the same afternoon. Pro- independence members tried to declare the independence of the Faroe Islands from the Kingdom of Denmark but were outvoted. An official announcement was later made announcing the occupation and ordering a nighttime blackout in T√≥rshavn and neighbouring Argir, the censorship of post and telegraphy and the prohibition of the use of motor vehicles during the night without a permit.Niels Juel Arge, Str√≠√∞s√°rini VI (The Years of War VI) , at www.faroestamps.fo On 13 April, the Royal Navy cruiser arrived at T√≥rshavn. Colonel T. B. W. Sandall (the British military commander) and Frederick Mason (the new British Consul to the Faroe Islands) then met with the Danish Prefect. The Prefect responded with what Sandall took to be a formal protest, although Hilbert maintained that owing to the occupation of Denmark he was unable formally to represent the Danish government. He duly accepted the British terms on the basis that the UK would not seek to interfere with the internal affairs of the islands. A formal protest was made by the L√∏gting, albeit expressing the wish for friendly relations. 250 Royal Marines were disembarked, later to be replaced by other British troops. Cordial relations were maintained between the British forces and the Faroese authorities. In May, the Royal Marines were replaced by soldiers of the Lovat Scouts, a Scottish Regiment. In 1942, they were replaced by the Cameronians (Scottish Rifles). From 1944, the British garrison was considerably reduced. The author Eric Linklater was part of the British garrison and his 1956 novel The Dark of Summer was set in the Faroe Islands during the war years.  Events  On 20 June 1940, five vessels of the Swedish Navy arrived in the Faroe Islands. Four (, , Romulus and ) were destroyers bought from Italy, one with civilian passengers; the fifth (Castor) was a tanker converted to military status. Britain seized all the ships under armed threat and moved them to the Shetland Islands. Although Sweden was a neutral country and not at war with Britain, the British feared Germany would seize them if they continued to Sweden. After political negotiations Sweden secured their return. The British Navy had stripped equipment and caused damage to the ships, which Britain later gave compensation for. The Swedish commander was criticized by other Swedish officers for conceding the ships without resistance.  Aftermath  Minnisvar√∞in, in honour of the 210 men who died at sea during World War II. Erected in 1956, made by (Norwegian artist), Lamhauge and Waagstein, Jacob Simonsen, the stoneplates were made by the F√∏roya Mekaniski Gr√≥t√≠dna√∞ur. A plaque has been erected by British veterans in T√≥rshavn Cathedral expressing thanks for the kindness shown to them by the Faroese people during their presence. Approximately 170 marriages took place between British soldiers and Faroese women; the British Consul, Frederick Mason (1913‚Äì2008) also married a local woman, Karen Rorholm. The Faroe Islands suffered occasional attacks by Luftwaffe aircraft but an invasion was never attempted. Drifting sea mines proved to be a considerable problem and resulted in the loss of numerous fishing boats and their crews. The trawler N√Ωggjaberg was sunk on 28 March 1942 near Iceland; 21 Faroese seamen were killed in the worst loss of Faroese lives in the war. Faroese ships had to hoist the Faroese flag and paint FAROES / F√òROYAR on the ships' sides, thus allowing the Royal Navy to identify them as \\"friendly\\". To prevent inflation, Danish Krone banknotes in circulation on the islands were overstamped with a mark indicating their validity only in the Faroe Islands. The Faroese kr√≥na (technically the Danish Krone in the Faroe Islands) was fixed at 22.4 DKK to ¬£1 Sterling. Emergency banknotes were issued and Faroese banknotes were later printed by Bradbury Wilkinson in England.Faroe Islands Paper Money - British Protectorate, Faer√∏erne, 1.10.1940 Emergency Issues., article on Faroese currency during the British occupation During the occupation, the L√∏gting was given full legislative powers, albeit as an expedient given the occupation of Denmark. Although in the 1944 Icelandic constitutional referendum, Iceland became an independent republic, Churchill refused to countenance a change in the constitutional status of the Faroe Islands whilst Denmark was still occupied. Following the liberation of Denmark and the end of World War II in Europe, the occupation was terminated in May 1945 and the last British soldiers left in September. The experience of wartime self-government left a return to the pre-war status of an amt (county) unrealistic and unpopular. The 1946 Faroese independence referendum led to local autonomy within the Danish realm in 1948. The largest tangible sign of the British presence is the runway of V√°gar Airport. Other reminders include the naval guns at the fortress of Skansin in T√≥rshavn, which served as the British military headquarters. A continuing reminder is the Faroese love of fish and chips and British chocolate such as Dairy Milk (which is readily available in shops throughout the islands but not in Denmark). American and German neuroepidemiologists John F. Kurtzke, Klaus Lauer, R. G. Cooke, Stuart Cook and others, have studied a series of multiple sclerosis epidemics that began in 1943 and are felt to be related to an unknown transmitted infectious agent. In 1990, the Faroese government organised British Week, a celebration of the 50th anniversary of the friendly occupation. The celebration was attended by and a Royal Marines band. Sir Frederick Mason, the former wartime British consul to the Faroes, was also present.Obituary of Sir Frederick Mason in The Times = Fatalities = More than 200 Faroese seamen lost their lives at sea during World War II, most due to the war. A monument in their memory stands in T√≥rshavn's municipal park. Several Faroese vessels were either bombed or sunk by German submarines or by drifting sea mines. Faroese fishing vessels harvested the sea near Iceland and around the Faroe Islands and transported their catch to the UK for sale.  Airport  Faroese flag The only airfield on the Faroe Islands was built in 1942‚Äì43 on the island of V√°gar by the Royal Engineers under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel William E. Law. The majority of the British personnel in the Faroes were stationed at V√°gar, mostly working on the construction of the airfield. Abandoned after the war, it was reopened as the civilian V√°gar Airport in 1963. Left-hand traffic was in force on the roads of the island of V√°gar until the British troops left the Faroe Islands.  The Faroese flag  Following the occupation of Denmark by Germany, Faroese vessels were no longer permitted by the British Admiralty to fly the Danish flag. This was of considerable significance given the importance of the fishing fleet to the Faroese economy. Following some intensive discussions between the British occupation authorities, the Faroese authorities and the Danish Prefect, as well as discussions between the UK Foreign Office and the Danish Embassy in London, on 25 April 1940 the British authorities recognised the Faroese flag ‚Äî Merki√∞ ‚Äî as the civil ensign of the Faroe Islands.History of the Faroese flag , Flags of the World  Gallery  Image:Faroes030417-nasa(2).jpgNASA photo of the islands Image:Faroe stamp 536 world war 2.jpg2005 Faroese stamp commemorating friendly relations between British soldiers and the Faroese Image:British gun, skansin (Faroe Islands).jpgBritish Second World War naval gun, Skansin fortress, T√≥rshavn Image:New zealand pilot died in the faroes.jpgGrave of F/O H.

In 1941, he received his Ph.D. from Stanford University thereafter accepting a temporary appointment as assistant professor. In 1943, he became a visiting assistant professor at [the University of Montana (www.umt.edu/)]. In 1945, Krug became the Wisconsin State Curriculum Coordinator and held a concurrent position as Associate Professor of Education at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison. In 1947, he returned to Stanford as an associate professor, but returned to Madison the next year. Krug's early works dealt with US social life. Beginning in 1950, Krug began a long publishing career on the history of US education. In 1950 he published Curriculum Planning and, a decade later, Secondary School Curriculum. He also wrote Charles W. Eliot and Popular Education (1961) and Salient Dates in American Education (1966). He collaborated on Schools and Our Democratic Society (1952), Multzple-Period Organization in Wisconsin Secondary Schools (1952), Administering Curriculum Planning (1957) and The College-Preparatory Function in Wisconsin High Schools (1959). His legacy, though, was established by a two-volume study of the American high school, The Shaping of the American High School (vol. 1, 1964; vol. 2 1971).

In Animal Crossing, the player character is a human who lives in a village inhabited by various anthropomorphic animals, carrying out various activities such as fishing, bug catching, and fossil hunting. The series is notable for its open-ended gameplay and extensive use of the video game console's internal clock and calendar to simulate real passage of time. Since its initial release in 2001, five Animal Crossing games have been released worldwide, one each for the Nintendo 64/iQue Player (enhanced and reissued for the GameCube), Nintendo DS, Wii, Nintendo 3DS and Nintendo Switch. The series has been both critically and commercially successful and has sold over 40 million units worldwide. Three spin-off games have also been released: Animal Crossing: Happy Home Designer for Nintendo 3DS, Animal Crossing: Amiibo Festival for Wii U, and Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp for mobile devices.  Common elements  = Characters = While the series features various villagers for each title, certain prominent characters return in each series installment. Tom Nook is a tanuki character who functions as both a shop owner and real estate broker, giving the player a loan for their house and allowing them to pay it back with no interest. Mr. Resetti is a mole character who appears from underground whenever players shut off the game without saving, berating them for circumventing one of the game's systems. Due to a new autosave function, he was \\"laid off\\" from his job in Animal Crossing: New Horizons, although he has gotten a new job as the Rescue Service operator. K.K. Slider is a canine traveling musician based on series composer Kazumi Totaka, and plays on certain nights in the town's club. Afterwards, he gives the player a free copy of the song played, saying that his music \\"wants to be free\\". This was seen by some fans as tacit support for music piracy, although Nintendo denied that it was intended as social commentary. =Gameplay= In the Animal Crossing games, the player assumes the role of a human character who moves into a rural village populated with anthropomorphic animals and lives there indefinitely. Gameplay is open-ended: players have no defined objectives, but are instead encouraged to spend their time in the village performing any number of activities, which include collecting items, planting plants or other items, and socializing with the village's residents. Animal Crossing games are played in real time, utilizing the video game console's internal clock and calendar. Thus, passage of time in the game world reflects that in reality, as well as the current season and time of day. Some in-game events, such as holidays or the growth of a tree, occur at certain times or require some duration of time to have passed. One notable feature of the Animal Crossing series is the high level of customization available, some of which affects the outcome of the game. The player character is both named and gendered by the real life player at the start of the game, and their appearance can be modified by buying or designing custom clothes and accessories or changing the hairstyle (introduced in Wild World). The player's house can also be furnished, decorated, and later expanded: the player can purchase and collect furniture and place it anywhere in the house, as well as change both the wallpaper and floor designs. While its terrain, building locations, and initial residents are randomly generated when the game is first begun (except in Animal Crossing: New Leaf, in which the player decides between four given towns, and Animal Crossing: New Horizons, in which the player similarly decides between four given islands), the village's name and anthem, as well as some of the residents' catchphrases, are also determined by the player. Collecting items is a major facet of Animal Crossing: the player can explore the village and gather objects, including fruit from trees, seashells, and discarded items. Nearly all objects can be sold for Bells, the in-game currency. Players collect objects to obtain more Bells, which can then be used to buy furniture and clothing, purchase home expansions, invest in stocks, and play games. A number of specialized tools are available for other activities such as fishing and insect collecting. Special items, such as fossils and paintings, may be donated to the village museum. The player can choose to socialize with the other animal residents by engaging in conversation, sending and receiving letters, bartering, or playing hide-and-seek. Residents may move in or out of the village depending on the player's actions. All installments of Animal Crossing allow some form of communication between players, both offline and online. A single village can house up to four human players, though only one can be exploring the village at any given time. The players can interact via written messages through the village post office or bulletin board. The GameCube iteration allowed players to travel to other villages by trading memory cards written with the game data, but all subsequent installments allow players to travel and interact online via Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection, although City Folk also allows the DS Suitcase to travel to others' towns.

The player has to catch a fish using the same mechanics as the original game. The 2008 Wii game Super Smash Bros. Brawl features elements from Wild World. Most prominent is a stage based on the animal village, called \\"Smashville\\", which changes its scenery in accordance with the Wii system clock and features a number of songs remixed or extracted from the original game. Mr. Resetti and a pitfall seed, which appear in all Animal Crossing games, are available as an Assist Trophy and an item respectively. Brawl also features 24 collectible trophies based on Animal Crossing characters and items. Wii Music features two playable songs from Animal Crossing. The minigame \\"Animal Crossing: Sweet Day\\" in Nintendo Land is based on the Animal Crossing game series. The objective of the game is for the Wii Remote players (1-4), to gather large amounts of candy scattered around the area and store them in their head without getting caught by the Gatekeepers, who are controlled using the two Wii U GamePad analog sticks. A playable character called \\"Villager\\" represents the Animal Crossing series as a fighter in Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. The character has both male and female forms, which are selected when choosing the character. His or her moves include the ability to catch other players in a net and firing Lloid the gyroid as a missile. Additionally, Isabelle from New Leaf appears as an Assist Trophy, and later appeared as a standalone fighter in Ultimate. Two new Animal Crossing stages appear in the games: \\"Town & City\\" from City Folk in the Wii U version, and \\"Tortimer Island\\" from New Leaf in the 3DS version. \\"Smashville\\" from Brawl returns in the Wii U version. Villager and Isabelle are playable characters in Mario Kart 8 via downloadable content, along with a racetrack based on Animal Crossing and a cup named after the series known as the \\"Crossing Cup\\". The two racers, along with the Animal Crossing track, were also included in the Nintendo Switch version of the game, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe along with a racing suit based on the series for the Mii. In June 2015, Isabelle and Mr. Resetti-themed cosmetics were added as costumes options for the player's \\"Palico\\" companion in Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate.

Constructed in 1912, it was the last major light station built on the west coast. Anacapa and several other islands were collectively designated as Channel Islands National Monument in 1938, though the Coast Guard retained responsibility for the Anacapa lighthouse. Now fully automated and unmanned, the light house still operates, but the National Park Service (NPS) is responsible for Channel Islands National Park. Anacapa Island is noted now for an environmental restoration program devised by the NPS to exterminate the large population of non-native rats which infested the island and was making significant inroads on native species. The program, which began in 2003, selectively killed off the invaders with few adverse effects on the non-targeted native wildlife species. By 2014, after careful examination of the island, NPS could declare it rat-free. History Positioned at the eastern entrance to the Santa Barbara Channel, Anacapa was a natural choice for a lighthouse. The Lighthouse Board decided to place a light on the island, but to limit the expense of building an offshore beacon, an unmanned acetylene lens lantern on a tower was erected in 1912. In 1932, the current permanent light station was built on the island, and was the last major light station to be built on the west coast. The tower and fog signal were built on the highest point of the island. In 1938, under the direction of Franklin D. Roosevelt, Santa Barbara and Anacapa Islands became Channel Islands National Monument. The United States Coast Guard automated the station in 1966. In 1980, Congress designated five of the eight Channel Islands, Anacapa, Santa Cruz, Santa Rosa, San Miguel, and Santa Barbara Islands, and of submerged lands as Channel Islands National Park. The lighthouse is still an active aid to navigation. Historical Information from Coast Guard web site:  Current usage  The buildings other than the lighthouse are now being utilized by the National Park Service.

He has lately been promoted as one of the best strategists in naval history.Larrie D. Ferreiro, Measure of the Earth: The Enlightenment Expedition That Reshaped Our World, (Basic Books, 2011), 191. Throughout his naval career, Lezo sustained numerous severe wounds. He lost his left eye, left hand, complete mobility of the right arm, and had his left leg amputated in situ after being hit by the projectile of a cannon. Biography = Early missions and injuries = Born in Pasajes, in the Basque Province of Guip√∫zcoa in Spain, Blas de Lezo y Olavarrieta commenced his naval career in the French navy in 1701 as a midshipman. In 1704 he fought in the War of Spanish Succession as a crew member in the Franco-Spanish fleet which fought the combined forces of Great Britain and the Netherlands at the indecisive Battle of V√©lez M√°laga. At this time, his left leg was hit by cannon-shot and was later amputated under the knee. Promoted to ensign, he was present at the relief of Pe√±√≠scola, Spain, and Palermo in Sicily; his service in these and other actions resulted in his promotion to ship lieutenant. Participating in the 1707 defence of the French naval base of Toulon cost him his left eye. In 1711 he served in the Spanish Navy under the orders of Andr√©s de Pez. In 1713 he was promoted to captain. In 1714 he lost use of his right arm in the Siege of Barcelona. Later in this campaign, his ship captured the Stanhope commanded by John Combes, sometimes claimed to be a 70-gun but actually just a 20-gun merchantman. Thus, by age 25 or 27, depending on the sources, de Lezo had lost his left eye, his left leg below the knee, and the use of his right arm. Modern sources often focus on these salient features and refer to Lezo with nicknames such as \\"Patapalo\\" (Pegleg) and \\"Mediohombre\\" (Half-man). There is no contemporary proof that these (or others) were actually used during Lezo's lifetime. A 19th-century depiction of Blas de Lezo's frigate towing its prize, the Stanhope (ca. 1710). =First posting to the Americas= Lezo served in the Pacific in 1720-1728. Although it has been claimed that he took many prizes during this period, documentary evidence indicates that in fact he took only two French frigates and not in the Pacific but in the Atlantic. He reached Callao with them in January 1720 although he had left Spain in 1716 as second-in-command of the Nuestra Se√±ora del Carmen or Lanfranco as part of the expedition commanded by Juan Nicol√°s de Martinet. He was separated from the expedition while attempting to sail past Cape Horn. The prizes attributed to Lezo were taken by Martinet, who reached Callao in June 1717 and left the Pacific in 1719 before Lezo's arrival. Lezo married in Peru in 1725. =Return to the Mediterranean= In 1730 he returned to Spain and was promoted to chief of the Mediterranean Fleet; with this force he went to the Republic of Genoa to enforce the payment of two million pesos owed to Spain that had been retained in the Bank of San Jorge. Deeming the honour of the Spanish flag to be at stake, Blas de Lezo threatened the city with bombardment. In 1732, on board the Santiago, he and Jos√© Carrillo de Albornoz commanded the enormous expedition to Oran and Mers-el-K√©bir with more than 300 ships and around 28,000 troops, comprising infantry, cavalry and artillery. In the Battle of A√Øn-el-Turk they recaptured the cities lost to the Ottoman Empire in 1708. After the defeat, Bey Abu l-Hasan Ali I managed to reunite his troops and surrounded the city of Oran. Lezo returned to its aid with six ships and 5,000 men and managed to drive off the Algerian pirate after a hard fight. Dissatisfied with this he took his 60-gun flagship into the corsair's refuge of Mostaganem Bay, a bastion defended by two forts and 4,000 Moors. He inflicted heavy damage on the forts and town. In the following months he established a naval blockade, preventing the Algerians from receiving reinforcements from Istanbul, thereby gaining valuable time for the securing of Oran's defense, until an epidemic forced him to return to Cadiz. =General Commander and Battle of Cartagena de Indias= In 1734 the king promoted him to Lieutenant General of the Navy. He returned to South America with the ships Fuerte and Conquistador in 1737 as General Commander of the Spanish fleet stationed at Cartagena de Indias, in modern-day Colombia. He took up his new post just prior to the conflict between Great Britain and Spain that would become known as the War of Jenkins' Ear and that would later be subsumed into the War of Austrian Succession. De Lezo as Lieutenant General of the Spanish Navy In the early stages of the conflict, the British Admiral Edward Vernon undertook attacks on various Spanish outposts in America. One early victory involved the capture of Portobelo (Panama), the dismantling of its fortifications and the withdrawal of British forces having left the place defenceless. Admiral Vernon tested Cartagena de Indias on three separate occasions. Both Vernon and Edward Trelawny, British governor of Jamaica, considered the Spanish gold shipping port to be a prime objective. The first attempt, in March 1740, was essentially a reconnaissance in force by a squadron including ships of the line, two fire ships, three bomb vessels, and transport ships. Vernon's intention was to gather information on topography and troop strength and to provoke a response that might give him a better idea of the defensive capabilities of the Spanish. In May, Vernon returned to Cartagena de Indias in charge of 13 warships, with the intention of probing the city's defences. The actual attack on Cartagena de Indias took place on March 13-May 20, 1741. The British concentrated a fleet consisting of 196 ships, including 2,620 artillery pieces and more. There were 10,000 soldiers, 12,600 sailors, 1,000 Jamaican slaves and 4000 recruits from Virginia. The defences of Cartagena de Indias comprised between 3,000 and 6,000 combatants, including regular troops, militia, Indian archers and the crews of six Spanish warships. Blas de Lezo's advantages consisted of a formidable primary fortress and numerous secondary fortifications. Blas de Lezo Statue in Cartagena de Indias On the evening of April 19, the British mounted an assault in force upon San Felipe. Three columns of grenadiers supported by Jamaicans and several British companies moved under cover of darkness, with the aid of an intense naval bombardment. The British fought their way to the base of the fort's ramparts but were unable to overcome the defence and withdrew. After comprehensively destroying the forts in their possession, the British began an orderly withdrawal back to Jamaica. =Death and blame= Lezo died four months after the siege was raised and a contemporary source indicates that the cause of death was epidemic typhus: \\"unas calenturas, que en breves d√≠as se le declar√≥ tabardillo\\".Letter from Rodrigo Torres to Zen√≥n de Somodevilla, Marqu√©s de la Ensenada, 28 October 1741. The site of his grave is unknown. Blas de Lezo was blamed for not having used his naval forces to full effect and for having sunk his own ships to no gain and at an immense cost to the Crown. He was later honoured for his part in the siege of Cartagena de Indias as a square and an avenue in the city of Cartagena are named after him. A modern statue stands in front of the Castillo San Felipe de Barajas. In 2011, during a conference on Blas de Lezo's place in history and honouring the 270th anniversary of Cartagena de Indias' defence, a plaque was placed on the wall at the Plaza de los Coches, by the Clock Tower portal.Medallas, Mapas y Grabados: La Iconograf√≠a de la Defensa de Cartagena\\" Razon Cartografica, in Spanish And in November 2014, a 35,000 kilo statue of Lezo was erected in Madrid's Plaza Col√≥n. Legacy Several Spanish warships have been named Blas de Lezo in his honour including: * An Elcano-class cruiser, named General Lezo, built in 1884. * A Blas de Lezo-class cruiser built in 1924, sunk in a shipwreck in 1932. * The former a Gearing class destroyer - 1978 to 1991. * An √Ålvaro de Baz√°n-class frigate, F103 was built at the Spanish Izar shipyard and launched in May 2003.

It was released in August, 2005 on the Ferret Music record label. It follows their late 2003 release of Your Murder Mixtape and the EP, Posthumous. This album's sound is heavily influenced by The Misfits. In addition, the horrorcore imagery prevalent in all their works continues on this album, this time taking a more gothic horror direction with lyrics about mythical subjects such as werewolves, vampires, and other hell- beasts. The cover was created by the vocalist, Joey Southside, a professional dark comic cartoonist. Each Breath Haunted was pressed on 12\\" vinyl for the first time in March 2012. . Overview By this time, and with input from experienced sources, the band's songwriting had developed sufficiently to carry the themes they portray. The end result being that the music is more refined, still brutal, but with many softer, reflective mood parts ‚Äì \\"Interlude\\" and \\"I Am Legend\\" as examples. The music in general involves more technical, angular riffs which are not out of place or carried out ineffectively, bringing about a comparison to early dark and moody Danzig. It is only near the end, on \\"Coffin Nails\\", that they tip a nod to their traditional hardcore punk roots. Joey Southside again changes vocal style; from traditional hardcore on the EP, to metalcore on Your Murder Mixtape, to this time a darker tone ‚Äì more in keeping with the style of music they chose to play at this time.

( / Pomoravlje, ), is a general term which in its widest sense marks valleys of any of three Morava rivers in Serbia: the West Morava (West Morava Valley), the South Morava (South Morava Valley) and the Great Morava (Great Morava Valley). In the narrow sense, the term is applied only to the Great Morava Valley ( / Veliko Pomoravlje). The Serbian term follows the general manner of coining river valley names in Serbian using the prefix po- and suffix -je, meaning literally \\"(land) along the Morava\\". Morava valley lies in the central Balkans, at the crossroads which lead eastwards, towards the Black sea and Asia Minor, and further south, down the Vardar river into the Aegean sea. ƒåaƒçak Kraljevo Kru≈°evac The West Morava Valley =Location= The West Morava Valley ( / Zapadno Pomoravlje) is the valley of the West Morava. It is the southernmost Peripannonic region of Serbia. It is parallel, latitudinally elongated, in the west-to-east direction, opposed to the meridian, south-to-north direction of South Morava Valley and Great Morava Valley. It occupies and area of 5,220 square kilometers and generally corresponds to the valley of the West Morava River and sections of its watershed around the rivers of Skrape≈æ, ƒêetinja (headwaters of West Morava) and Rasina (a tributary, near the confluence with South Morava). It is generally bounded by the mountains of Tara, Zlatibor, Jelica, Goƒç, Suvobor, Maljen, Kotlenik and Glediƒá, that is, by the large geographical regions of ≈†umadija and Stari Vlah. =Geography= The West Morava Valley is a composite valley, which means it consists of a sequence of valleys (depressions) and gorges. Sections include: * The Po≈æega Depression (Po≈æe≈°ka kotlina) ‚Äì starting point of the West Morava Valley. Ta≈°ti field is a place where rivers of Skrape≈æ, ƒêetinja and Golijska Moravica meet to create West Morava. Depression is located between the mountains of Krstac on the east, Blagaja on the south, Crna Kosa on the north-west and Loret on the north-east. Depression is known for frequent fogs, due to the abundance in water sources (tributaries of Bjelica, Kravariƒçka reka, Lu≈ænica). Central settlement is the town of Po≈æega and smaller settlements are Luƒçani and Gorobilje. * The Ovƒçar-Kablar Gorge (Ovƒçarsko-kablarska klisura) ‚Äì a narrow of the West Morava valley, between the mountains of Ovƒçar (985 meters) on the south and Kablar (885 meters) on the north. The gorge is a meandering and 15 kilometers long. Epigynous in nature, it is a crucial for the genesis of the entire West Morava Valley. The gorge is a location of Ovƒçar Spa and 10 Serbian Orthodox monasteries, which is why the gorge has been nicknamed Serbian Mount Athos. There are two hydro electrical power plants with artificial lakes: Ovƒçar and Meƒëuvr≈°je. * The ƒåaƒçak-Kraljevo Depression (ƒåaƒçansko-kraljevaƒçka kotlina) ‚Äì the largest tectonic-erosive depression of all in the valley. It covers an area of 270 square kilometers and is elongated for 40 kilometers. Despite being this long, it is located between only three mountains: Kotlenik on the north and Jelica and Stolovi on the south. West Morava receives many tributaries in this area. Apart from Ibar river, the longest tributary to West Morava, and Gru≈æa, most of them are short and include Diƒçina, Laƒëevaƒçka reka, Ribnica, etc. Main settlements are the towns of ƒåaƒçak, the most populous settlement in the entire West Morava Valley, and Kraljevo. Other smaller settlements include Preljina, Mrƒçajevci, Ribnica, Adrani, Konarevo, ≈Ωiƒça, etc., most of them suburbs of either ƒåaƒçak or Kraljevo. * The Vrnjci Depression (Vrnjaƒçka kotlina) ‚Äì widening at the confluence of the small Vrnjaƒçka and Lipovaƒçka rivers. Area, located between the mountains of Glediƒá on the north and Goƒç on the south, is rich in mineral springs. The most popular Serbian mineral spa, Vrnjaƒçka Banja is located in the depression. Other settlements include Vrnjci, Graƒçac and Novo Selo. * The Trstenik Depression (Trsteniƒçka kotlina) ‚Äì depression centered around the town of Trstenik, direct extension of Vrnjci depression. Agricultural area, other settlements include larger villages of Medveƒëa and Velika Drenova. * The Kru≈°evac Depression (Kru≈°evaƒçka kotlina) ‚Äì final section of the West Morava Valley, a large widening at the confluence with South Morava which directly extends into the Great Morava Valley on the north. Itself, extends into the south in the valley of the Rasina River and it is bounded by the Jastrebac mountain on the south. The largest settlement is the town of Kru≈°evac and its suburbs of Parunovac, Pepeljevac, Jasika, etc. Artificial lake of ƒÜelije is created on the Rasina. =Sub-regions= The West Morava Valley comprises several historical and geographical regions of Serbia, which are its own geographical sub-regions. From west to east, they are: { - valign=top  * Crna Gora * Dragaƒçevo  * Takovo * Goraƒçiƒái  * Gru≈æa * ≈Ωupa  * Rasina * Temniƒá } =Population= The West Morava Valley had a population of 531,978 inhabitants by the 2002 census of population, which gives an average population density of 102 inhabitants per square kilometer. The largest is in the area of ƒåaƒçak (184 per km2) and the smallest in the neighboring area of Luƒçani (54 per km2). Despite large urban centers, population has been depopulating for almost two decades. The population of the Morava Valley by the official censuses of population: * 1948 ‚Äì 375,798 * 1953 ‚Äì 417,667 * 1961 ‚Äì 448,393 * 1971 ‚Äì 493,905 * 1981 ‚Äì 541,428 * 1991 ‚Äì 551,871 * 2002 ‚Äì 531,978 Largest settlements of the West Morava Valley in 2002 were: * ƒåaƒçak ‚Äì 73,217 * Kraljevo ‚Äì 57,411 * Kru≈°evac ‚Äì 57,347 * Trstenik ‚Äì 17,180 * Po≈æega ‚Äì 13,206 * Vrnjaƒçka Banja ‚Äì 9,877 * Aleksandrovac ‚Äì 6,476 * Luƒçani ‚Äì 4,309 =Economy= The West Morava Valley is economically the most developed of all three Morava river valleys. Being a large floodplain, frequently flooded by the West Morava due to the extreme fluctuation of its discharge, The West Morava Valley was always an agricultural area, but in the second half of 20th century industry also developed in all major towns along the river. Agriculture Fertile land in the valley is best for grains and orchards. Corn is being cultivated in the ƒåaƒçak-Kraljevo depression, while wheat is being grown in the Kru≈°evac depression. Dragaƒçevo region is known for the potato production. ƒåaƒçak area is known for the plum growing, Po≈æega is known for the apples (\\"budimka\\" brand) and ≈Ωupa region around Aleksandrovac is famous for white grapes and wine production. The reservoir Parmenac near ƒåaƒçak is created for the purpose of irrigation and further fertilization of the land. Also, out of all three sections of the Morava Valley, the West Morava Valley is the most forested one. Mining and industry The West Morava Valley is rich in ores. It includes the mining of brown coal (\\"West Morava's coal basin\\"), hard coal, asbestos, magnesite, chromium, etc. As a result, the industry is very developed with a string of heavily industrialized towns: Po≈æega, ƒåaƒçak, Kraljevo, Trstenik and Kru≈°evac. With the valley of the Ibar, the West Morava has a huge potential in electricity production. Hydroelectric power plants Ovƒçar (6 MW) and Meƒëuvr≈°je (7 MW) with artificial lakes are built near ƒåaƒçak, in the Ovƒçar-Kablar gorge, so as the lakes Parmenac (also on Morava) and ƒÜelije (on Rasina). Transportation and tourism The entire river valley is a natural route for both roads and railways connecting eastern, central and western Serbia, so traffic is also important for the economy of the region. Tourism is almost entirely based on mineral spas, as the West Morava Valley is dubbed \\"First spa region of Serbia\\". Best known spas include Vrnjaƒçka Banja, Mataru≈°ka Banja, Bogutovaƒçka Banja, Ovƒçar Banja, Viƒçka Banja, Gornja Trepƒça, etc. Additional interests are the Goƒç mountain and medieval Serbian Orthodox monasteries of ≈Ωiƒça, Kaleniƒá, Lazarica, Ljubostinja, Naupara, etc. One of top mountain resorts of Serbia, Tara and Zlatibor, are marking the eastern border of the region. The South Morava Valley =Location= The South Morava Valley ( / Ju≈æno Pomoravlje) is the valley of the South Morava. It is the southernmost region of Serbia, bordering North Macedonia. It is meridionally elongated, in the south-to-north direction. In the narrower sense, as a valley of the South Morava, it occupies an area of 4,800 km2, of which 1,660 km2 on Kosovo and the rest in Central Serbia. In wider sense, the South Morava Valley is identified with southern Serbia in general and covers the entire watershed of the South Morava (15,469 km2). =Geography= * Konƒçulj Gorge (Konƒçuljska klisura) ‚Äì gorge in the original section of South Morava, while it is still being called Binaƒçka Morava. It connects sub-regions of Izmornik on Kosovo and Bujanovac section of the Vranje depression. Gorge is 11 kilometers long, cut by Morava in the gneiss-granite rocks of the northernmost extension of the Skopska Crna Gora mountain. It was named after the village of Konƒçulj and forms a natural route for the Vranje-Bujanovac-Gnjilane road. * Vranje Depression (Vranjska kotlina) ‚Äì larger widening of the valley mainly bordered by the mountains of Skopska Crna Gora on the south-west, Rujen on the south, Sveti Ilija on the west, Kukavica on the north and Besna Kobila on the east. Center of the depression is the town of Vranje and other settlements include Vranjska Banja, Veliki Trnovac, Bujanovac and Pre≈°evo. Sometimes called Vranje-Pre≈°evo depression, with northern section mostly corresponds to the sub-region of Inogo≈°te, while southern, through the Pre≈°evska povija ridge extends to the south into the region of ≈Ωegligovo and Pƒçinja valley in North Macedonia. * Grdelica Gorge (Grdeliƒçka klisura) ‚Äì one of the most famous gorges in Serbia, a valley narrow which is 33 kilometers long (48 by the river course) and up to 550 meters deep. Gorge is carved between the mountains of Kukavica on the west and ƒåemernik on the east. The highest point above the gorge is orographic (geomorphological) water divide of the Pannonian and Aegean basins, which doesn't correspond with hydrological divide of the South Morava watershed (which spread south of it, too). Due to the deforestation, Grdelica gorge is an area of excessive erosion, which is the main reason for the elevation of the river bed of the Great Morava downstream and flooding in the Great Morava Valley. In the gorge area, erosion as a result has floods, torrents, inundations, trenching, etc. Largest settlement, Vladiƒçin Han is at the entrance, while Grdelica, after which the gorge is named, at the exit. Other settlements in the gorge include D≈æep and Predejane. * Leskovac Depression (Leskovaƒçka kotlina) is a main section of the larger Leskovac field (Leskovaƒçko polje), the largest fluvial-tectonic depression in the valley. A 50 kilometers in diameter, it was completed flooded by the lake in Neogene. Today it is a place where many important South Morava's tributaries flow in it: Jablanica, Veternica, Vlasina, etc. The area is one of the best known vegetable growing regions in Serbia, especially for tomatoes and bell peppers. It encompasses several sub-regions (Jablanica, Vlasina) and due to its size, it is bordered by almost a dozen of mountains. It roughly corresponds to the region of Duboƒçica. Largest settlement is the town of Leskovac, fourth largest town in Central Serbia. Other settlements include Vlasotince and Vuƒçje. * Peƒçenjevce Defile (Peƒçenjevaƒçka sutjeska) ‚Äì small gorge which connects Leskovac field and Brestovac micro-depression, carved through the western slopes of the Babiƒçka Gora mountain. * Brestovac Micro-depression (Brestovaƒçka kotlinica) ‚Äì actually, the northernmost extension of the Leskovac field. It is located between the mountains of Babiƒçka Gora and Seliƒçevica on the east, and Pasjaƒça on the west. In the west it extends into the regions of Toplica and Pusta reka. Remains of the medieval town ruins of \\"Kurvin Grad\\" are located above the depression. Ni≈° * Ni≈°-Aleksinac Depression (Ni≈°ko-aleksinaƒçka kotlina) ‚Äì most populous section of the valley, thanks to the city Ni≈°, second largest town in Central Serbia, or popularly styled \\"metropolis of southern Serbia\\". Depression roughly begins at the village of Malo≈°i≈°te and ends at historical settlement of ƒêunis. Long and elongated, its borders are marked by the mountains of Seliƒçevica on the south-east, Ozren on the east, Bukovik on the north-east, Veliki Jastrebac and Mali Jastrebac on the west and Pasjaƒça on the south-west. Apart from Ni≈°, other important settlements in the depression include the string of Ni≈°' suburbs and the town of Aleksinac. Sometimes considered a two separate depressions, Ni≈° and Aleksinac. * Stalaƒá Gorge (Stalaƒáka klisura) ‚Äì the final narrow of the South Morava Valley before it meets the West Morava to form the Great Morava. The gorge is 20 kilometers long and 350 meters deep, carved in the form of the typical base epigyny (cut through the middle of the massif's base), with \\"pitched\\" meanders among the Stalaƒá Hills (Poslonjska and Mojsinjska mountains), part of the extreme north- west section of the Rhodope Mountains. Named after the small town of Stalaƒá at the exit of the gorge. =Sub-regions= Sub-regions which partially make up the South Morava Valley include: { - valign=top  * Binaƒçko Pomoravlje * Gornja Morava  * Izmornik * Inogo≈°te  * Jablanica * Pusta Reka  * Poljanica * Dobriƒç  * Toplica } =Population= The South Morava Valley had a population of 680,176 inhabitants by the official 2018 estimate by the State Statistical Office, with an average population density of 217 inhabitants per square kilometer, but the area's density is in general smaller, average density being enlarged by the large centers like the city of Ni≈° (430 per km2) and Leskovac. The South Morava Valley has been known for rural depopulation and stagnation almost for the last five decades while the cities grew larger.

Vranje is also known for floriculture. The area is also producing grains (corn in Vranje and Leskovac, wheat in Leskovac and Aleksinac- Ni≈° region), figs, fruits (cherries in Vranje, grapes in Leskovac) and industrial plants (sugar beet in Aleksinac- Ni≈°, tobacco in Aleksinac- Ni≈°, Vranje and Leskovac). Leskovac is also known for the cattle and sheep. Walnuts and almonds are produced as well. Region is also known for producing melons and watermelons. Textile industry is developed, because the region produces much linen. Sunflower seeds provide vegetable oil. Water from South Morava is also used for the irrigation, due to parts of the region being semi-arid. Mining and industry The mountains surrounding the region are rich in minerals and ores. The mountain of Besna Kobila has findings of zinc, lead and silver. Other findings include chromium, antimony, graphite, lithium and tungsten. Oil shales are found near Leskovac and Aleksinac. Aleksinac is also part of a large Aleksinac coal basin, while lignite is abundant in the area. Though South Morava has a significant potential for electricity production, it has not been dammed, though some parts of its watershed on the east (Vlasina, Vrla) have a series of hydro electrical plants (Vrla I, II, III and IV). Area is rich in mineral springs with many spas: Vranjska Banja, Bujanovƒçaka Banja, Ribarska Banja, Kulinska Banja, Klokot Banja, etc. There are several large industrial centers in the region, some of the largest in Serbia (Ni≈°, Leskovac, Vranje). Secondary centers are Aleksinac, Vlasotince and Pre≈°evo. Transportation Along with the Great Morava Valley, its natural continuation, the South Morava Valley is an important European transportation route and Ni≈° is a major crossroads. It makes a section of the Belgrade-Skopje-Thessaloniki route, that is, of the European route E75 (which connects Norway and Greece), with a branch splitting at Ni≈° for Sofia, Bulgaria, which is actually a crossroads of the routes E75 and E80 which connects Portugal and Turkey. Since 2019, route has been turned into a highway. The South Morava Valley is also a railway crossroads: railway Belgrade-Ni≈°-Skopje, trans-Balkan railway Peƒá-Prahovo, etc. The Great Morava Valley =Location= The Great Morava Valley ( / Veliko Pomoravlje) is the valley of the Great Morava. It is often referred to only as the Morava Valley ( / Pomoravlje; Pomoravlje District is located in the southern area of the Great Morava Valley). At the beginning, it is bounded by the mountains of Juhor on the west and Kuƒçaj on the east. In the later section, the Morava Valley gets much wider, with only smaller hills bounding it and opens widely to the Danube and Banat region, across the river. It covers an area of 4,360 square milometers, which is over 70% of the entire Great Morava watershed. =Geography= Po≈æarevac Smederevo The Great Morava Valley is a valley region of the middle, Peripannonic Serbia. In the Neogene, it was a deep bay (\\"Morava Bay\\") of the inner Pannonian Sea, which flowed off through the ƒêerdap gorge 600,000 years ago. As the sea withdrew, the Great Morava cut in its flow through the drained bay, almost for 500 meters. The region is 120 kilometers long and up to 40 kilometers wide. Altitudes vary from 75 meters on the north to 130 meters on the south. It has a tempered continental climate with not much rainfall but frequend floods. Composite valley of the Great Morava has three main sections. * The Upper Great Morava or ƒÜuprija Depression (Gornjovelikomoravska or ƒÜuprijska kotlina) ‚Äì southern half of the Great Morava Valley, located between the mountains of Juhor (east) and Kuƒçaj (west). After the Neogene phase, in which the depression was the southernmost extension of the Pannonian Sea, the Great Morava cut through from the relative elevation of 350 meters (\\"Five Morava Plateaus\\"). It has three larger (Paraƒáin, ƒÜuprija and Jagodina) and two towns (Varvarin, ƒÜiƒáevac), so as several large villages. In this section, the Great Morava receives the tributaries of Kaleniƒáka Reka, Lugomir, Belica (from the left), Crnica and Ravanica (from the right). * The Bagrdan Gorge (Bagrdanska klisura) ‚Äì wide gorge, epigynously cut in the nearby hills. It is 17 kilometers long and it is the final gorge of the entire Morava course. It was named after the village of Bagrdan. River Osanica flows into the Great Morava from the left in the gorge. In the 1980s, the gorge was planned for the hydro electrical dam construction and creation of a reservoire. * The Lower Great Morava or Po≈æarevac Depression (Donjovelikomoravska or Po≈æarevaƒçka kotlina) ‚Äì northern half, ending section of the entire Morava river system, where it finally empties into the Danube. Very wide and open to the north (Pannonian Plain), with two larger cities, Smederevo and Po≈æarevac. =Sub-regions= Regions, which partially or completely make the Great Morava Valley, include Jasenica, Lepenica, Resava and Temniƒá. Because the Great Morava and West Morava are considered the eastern and southern borders, respectively, of the super-region of ≈†umadija, they largely overlap with it in these areas. =Population= The South Morava Valley had a population of 545,517 inhabitants by the 2002 census of population, with an average population density of 125 inhabitants per square kilometer. Extremes include Smederevo, with 230 per km2, and Despotovac, with 41 per km2. Despite being developed as an agricultural and industrial region, it has been depopulating for the last few decades. The population of the Morava Valley by the official censuses of population: * 1948 ‚Äì 495,903 * 1953 ‚Äì 530,335 * 1961 ‚Äì 565,584 * 1971 ‚Äì 594,934 * 1981 ‚Äì 632,984 * 1991 ‚Äì 586,033 * 2002 ‚Äì 545,517 In the 1980s plans were made to join towns of Jagodina, Paraƒáin and ƒÜuprija into the first planned conurbation in Yugoslavia, including inter-city tramway lines, etc., but the idea was dropped later. The largest settlements of the Great Morava Valley in 2002 were: { - valign=top  * Smederevo ‚Äì 62,805 * Po≈æarevac ‚Äì 41,736 * Jagodina ‚Äì 35,589 * Paraƒáin ‚Äì 25,292 * Smederevska Palanka ‚Äì 25,300 * ƒÜuprija ‚Äì 20,585 * Velika Plana ‚Äì 16,210 * Svilajnac ‚Äì 9,395 * Kostolac ‚Äì 9,313 * Lapovo ‚Äì 7,422 * Kusadak ‚Äì 5,691 * Lozovik ‚Äì 5,607 * Batoƒçina ‚Äì 5,574 * ƒÜiƒáevac ‚Äì 5,094 * Radinac ‚Äì 4,920 * Azanja ‚Äì 4,713  * Despotovac ‚Äì 4,363 * Krnjevo ‚Äì 4,253 * Osipaonica ‚Äì 4,071 * Varvarin ‚Äì 3,977 * Selevac ‚Äì 3,864 * Milo≈°evac ‚Äì 3,426 * Lugavƒçina ‚Äì 3,384 * Lipe ‚Äì 3,338 * Markovac ‚Äì 3,228 * Obre≈æ ‚Äì 3,221 * Staro Selo ‚Äì 3,022 * Ribare ‚Äì 3,165 * Mihajlovac ‚Äì 3,093 * Majur ‚Äì 2,777 * Raƒça ‚Äì 2,744 * Vranovo ‚Äì 2,682  * Ku≈°iljevo ‚Äì 2,569 * Stalaƒá ‚Äì 2,428 * Saraorci ‚Äì 2,413 * Golobok ‚Äì 2,396 * Resavica ‚Äì 2,365 * Baƒçina ‚Äì 2,318 * Veliko Ora≈°je ‚Äì 2,299 * Glibovac ‚Äì 2,269 * Trnava ‚Äì 2,237 * Luƒçica ‚Äì 2,192 * Brzan ‚Äì 2,073 * Donja Livadica ‚Äì 2,053 * Porodin ‚Äì 2,036 * Ratari ‚Äì 2,035 * Udovice ‚Äì 2,018 * Drenovac ‚Äì 2,009 } =Economy= Agriculture With very fertile arable land, almost endless gardens, orchards and vineyards and its intensive agriculture, the Great Morava Valley is the granary of Central Serbia. The Great Morava agricultural region covers much larger area than the Great Morava Valley or even the watershed of the Great Morava: regions of Mlava and Pek on the east (Braniƒçevo District) and almost half of ≈†umadija, on the west. Main products in the valley are corn, wheat, sugar beet and sunflower. Hilly areas surrounding the valley are producing fruits, grapes (Smederevo), fodder plants and livestock. Braniƒçevo region has the largest production of beans in Serbia. Horse stud farm Ljubiƒçevo is located near Po≈æarevac. In the past centuries the Great Morava Valley was famous for its vast forest, but today it is almost entirely turned into an arable land. Mining and industry Unlike the West Morava Valley and South Morava Valley, the Great Morava Valley has almost no ores or minerals, except for the cement marl near Paraƒáin. But the area has vast finding of coal, near Kostolac (Kostolac-Podunavlje Basin; brown coal), in the valley of Resavica (Despotovac Basin; brown coal at Makvi≈°te and Resavica, lignite at Despotovac) and near ƒÜuprija (Senje Basin; brown coal). Also, the Great Morava Valley has only a few mineral springs (Luƒáiƒçka Banja, Stragarska Banja, etc.). Major industrial centers are Jagodina, Smederevo, Smederevska Palanka and ƒÜuprija, followed by Paraƒáin, Po≈æarevac and Velika Plana. Thermal power plant \\"Morava\\" (125 MW) is located near Svilajnac. One of three Serbian cement plants is located in Popovac (formerly \\"Novi Popovac\\", in 2002 bought by one of the Swiss cement company Holcim). Transportation The Great Morava Valley was always an important traffic route. In Roman times, it was the location of Via Militaris, while in the medieval period Constantinople road ran through. Today, it makes a section of the European route E75 (Belgrade-Ni≈° highway) which continues into the South Morava Valley. It also a route for the Belgrade-Ni≈° railway. In past times, the Great Morava used to be navigable, but due to the huge amounts of materials which are brought by the South Morava, as a result of extreme erosion in its watershed, the river bed of the Great Morava is literally being covered up so the river is not navigable today. Only some 3 kilometers near its mouth into the Danube can be used for navigation.

It was the fourth episode of series 6, and was first screened on 29 January 1989. In the episode, Rodney wins a holiday to Majorca, Spain. The only catch is the organisers think he is 14. Synopsis Del Boy has taken an interest in entering competitions, and enters a painting produced by Rodney when he was 14 into one, though without Rodney's knowledge. Rodney's work is selected as one of the winners, and his prize is a free holiday to Majorca in Spain, but when informing him of his success, Del declines to tell Rodney that he has won in the under-15 category. When at the airport, Del finally tells Rodney and Cassandra the full details of the prize, namely that the organisers think Rodney is 14. He persuades the two to go along with it, meaning that Rodney has to pretend to be 14 for the week, with Del posing as his father and Cassandra posing as his common law stepmother. The ploy appears to work, despite strange glances from the organisers, especially after it emerges that Del has modified the birth date on Rodney's passport. However it turns out that the organisers, in order to allow the parents of all the children present (also competition winners) a chance to enjoy the break as well, have set up a club filled with activities for the youngsters to enjoy. As a result, Rodney is conscripted into the Groovy Gang, a youth activity group, and is forced to undergo a week of misery as he is forced to take part in a variety of children's activities, such as skateboarding, in which Rodney comes second in a contest, and attending a junior disco, where Rodney advanced to the final of the breakdancing contest. If that was not bad enough, he has to fight off the affections of a thirteen-year-old Bros fan. Both Rodney and Cassandra are soon miserable (since they cannot spend any time together) and are ready to blow the whistle on the lie, but Del, who is having a great time, pretends to each of them (separately) that the other is enjoying it. Whilst on the trip, Del purchases some Spanish lottery tickets for each of them - to placate Cassandra and Rodney's rage at being duped - and Rodney's numbers win the one million peseta jackpot. The group are then informed by the holiday organisers that they will be unable to claim the prize, since the winning tickets were in Rodney's name and under Spanish law, people under 18 are not allowed to gamble. Knowing their charade is over and desperately wanting to claim the prize, Rodney produces his student card to prove he is really over 18, so the Trotters can then legally claim the prize. However, that has also been modified by Del, meaning the Trotters' windfall cannot be claimed. Del ruefully suggests \\"It's only money, bruv...\\" to calm Rodney down. Rodney chases Del out of the bar as the credits roll.

It is known for its shops, bazaars and Hindu temples. It is bounded by Kodambakkam to the north and Saidapet to the south. T. Nagar and Nandanam stretch all along its eastern frontiers while Ashok Nagar lies to its west. The Ayodhya Mandapam is an important landmark. Etymology Mambalam is believed to have derived its name from the existence of Maha vilvam trees in the locality, which in due course become Mavilam and then Mambalam In ancient times it was known as Mylai mel ambalam (place located on the west of Mylai). Then it changed to mel-ambalam. Then mel(top) changed into west and ambalam changed into Mambalam. With the railway line dividing the locality into East Mambalam and West Mambalam, and with East Mambalam having renamed as \\"Thyagaraya Nagar,\\" the western part continues to be known as \\"West Mambalam\\" today.  History  Prior to its inclusion in the then city of Madras, Mambalam was a village in the Saidapet taluk of Chingleput district. The oldest surviving reference to Mambalam is believed to be in a 1726 stone plaque commemorating the construction of the Marmalong Bridge (now known as Maraimalai Adigal Bridge) across the Adyar river by the merchant Coja Petrus Uscan. The bridge is believed to have been named after the village of Marmalong or Marmalan identified with Mambalam. The village was, then, a zamindari administered by zamindars belonging to a Telugu-speaking Reddi family. Urbanisation of Mambalam was started in 1911 with the construction of the Mambalam railway station on the Madras-Kanchipuram railroad. The Long Tank, which formed the western frontier of Madras city, was drained out in 1923. The same year, the administration of Mambalam was handed over to the British by its zamindar. The township of Theagaraya Nagar, popularly known as T. Nagar, was constructed in the southern part of the zamindari during 1923‚Äì25. The townships of Mambalam and Theagaraya Nagar covering an area of 1.008 sq. miles were included in the Mambalam division of Madras city. These outlying residential suburbs were connected to the rest of the city by an effective bus service. The areas surrounding Arya Gowda Road (originally the Ari Gowder Road) were obtained from Badaga leader and politician H. B. Ari Gowder. In its early days, Mambalam was affected by sanitation issues and was notorious for its filaria epidemics. This area was annexed to Chennai in 1946. Starting from the 1960s, Mambalam grew into a middle-class residential neighbourhood in counterbalance to the sister-township of Theagaraya Nagar which was evolving into a busy shopping district. Corporation ward office Mambalam has 3 corporation wards under the old zone of 8 and new zone 10.

It is registered as a California Historical Landmark, and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as \\"Crescent City Lighthouse\\". History Battery Point Light was one of the first lighthouses on the California coast. Rugged mountains and unbridged rivers meant coastal travel was essential for the economic survival of this region. In 1855, Congress appropriated $15,000 for the construction of a lighthouse on the tiny islet, which is connected to Battery Point by an isthmus which is visible, and can be traversed on foot, at low tide. Although not included in the 1852 contract by the United States Lighthouse Service for the first eight west coast lighthouses, the Battery Point Lighthouse was actually lit ten days before the Humboldt Harbor Lighthouse, the last of the original eight to become operational. The fourth-order Fresnel lens was lit in 1856. The lighthouse was automated in 1953, and a modern lens replaced the fourth-order Fresnel lens. Theophilis Magruder was the station's first keeper; Wayne Piland was its last before automation in 1953. The 1964 Alaska earthquake, the strongest earthquake ever recorded in the northern hemisphere, caused a tsunami. The lighthouse survived. In the following year, the modern beacon that replaced the Fresnel lens in the tower was switched off, and a flashing light at the end of the nearby breakwater served as the harbor's navigational aid. In 1982, the light in the lighthouse tower was lit again, and the Battery Point Lighthouse was listed as a private aid to navigation. Battery Point Lighthouse and Museum Del Norte Historical Society operates the Battery Point Lighthouse and Museum. The lighthouse is open to the public only when low tide permits access, daily from April through September with tours between 10 AM and 4 PM. October through March, the lighthouse is open for tours on weekends, from 10 AM to 4 PM. In both seasons, visits to the Battery Point Lighthouse and Island are only possible at low tides. It is recommended that visitors research tide times before visiting, as the tide rises very quickly at the point and the land bridge to the lighthouse can disappear rapidly. The museum includes the lighthouse keeper's quarters with period furniture and artifacts left behind since the 1850s, as well as displays of maritime artifacts, photos and historical documents. Tours include a climb into the light tower. In popular culture At least two novels have been set at Battery Point Light. Walk Across the Sea, by Susan Fletcher, is a 2001 historical fiction for teens. The Lightkeeper's Daughter, by Colleen Coble, is a 2010 inspirational romance for adults. Also, the music video for the Tim McGraw song \\"Not a Moment Too Soon\\" has scenes of Tim next to the light on the lighthouse's top balcony and scenes of the Battery Point Light from a distance.

Amateur career  Johnston had a storied amateur career, compiling an amateur record of 260-13. Some of his highlights include: * 1989 lost at Lightweight in the United States Championships to Shane Mosley * 1990 United States Amateur champion at Light Welterweight * 1990 2nd place at Light Welterweight at the World Championships in Lima, Peru; losing to Hector Vinent of Cuba. * 1991 Silver medalist at the USA Sports festival beating Shane Mosley by decision, and losing to Terron Millett by decision * 1991 Light Welterweight Gold Medalist at the Pan-American Games in Havana, Cuba.

Results were: ** Mark Lewis won on points ** Terron Millett won on points ** Vernon Forrest lost on points, Johnston then lost again to Forrest in the Box-Offs in Phoenix.  Professional career  Known as \\"Lil' But Bad\\", Johnston turned pro in 1993 and fought for the WBC Lightweight Title against Jean Baptiste Mendy in 1997, winning a close split decision. Johnston defended the title three times before losing the belt to Cesar Bazan in 1998 in a close decision. In 1999 he won a rematch against Bazan in another close decision. He defended the title four times, including a victory over Angel Manfredy, but lost the belt in a loss to Jos√© Luis Castillo in 2000 via majority decision. The loss was declared the 2000 Upset of the Year by Ring Magazine, as Castillo was relatively unknown at the time and Johnston was thought to be over the hill. It wasn't until a couple years later that the world would know how good of a fighter Castillo was. Later that year, in an attempt to regain the belt, Johnston rematched Castillo. In a bizarre ending, Johnston was originally declared the winner by Majority decision. Several minutes later it was discovered that Judge Ken Morita's scorecard (originally 115-114 Johnston) had been added incorrectly and should have read 114-114, thus making the bout a draw and allowing Castillo to retain his title. This was to be Johnston's last shot at a major title. He lost his next big fight, a WBC Lightweight Title Eliminator in 2003 to contender Juan Lazcano, a stunning 11th round TKO loss. Prior to the loss, the durable Johnston had never been stopped. After the loss, Johnston was inactive for more than two years due to injuries suffered in a car accident later that year. \\"I'm lucky to be alive, never mind fighting,\\" Stevie explained. \\"I went through the windshield, woke up in the hospital, and ended-up with more than 100-stitches in my face.\\" Johnston came back in 2005 and in 2006 took on former 140 lbs WBA world title holder Vivian Harris and was dominated. Johnston was down twice in the 1st round and once in rounds 4 and 7, losing in a 7th round TKO. In 2007 he was stopped by Rolando Reyes. In 2008, Johnston suffered another defeat by way of KO at the hands of a taller and younger Edner Cherry. A left jab followed immediately by a right cross which landed squarely on Johnston's chin and knocked him down with only 30 seconds left in the 10th and final round. Making matters worse, Johnston slammed the back of his head against the canvas on the way down, and was unconscious for several minutes after the count.

Kazanjian (, March 18, 1879 ‚Äì October 19, 1974) was an Armenian American oral surgeon who pioneered techniques for plastic surgery and is considered to be the founder of the modern practice of plastic surgery. He graduated from Harvard School of Dental Medicine in 1905. He served as professor of oral surgery from 1922‚Äì1939 and he was the first to hold the title of Professor of plastic surgery at Harvard Medical School. He also co- authored the first concise book on plastic surgery. Dr. Kazanjian's brother's daughter was actress and television celebrity Arlene Francis (Kazanjian- Gabel). Biography Varaztad Kazanjian was born in Erzincan, Ottoman Empire on March 18, 1879. In 1879, he attended a French Jesuit school in the city of Sivas. Thereafter, he moved to Samsun to live with his older half-brother. While in Samsun, he worked with his brother but eventually worked in a post office. In an attempt to escape the massacres of Armenians in the Ottoman Empire, he left to the United States in October 1895 and settled in Worcester, Massachusetts, and took a job in the local wire factory. It was at the mill that Dr. Kazanjian first displayed the natural dexterity that would serve him well in the field of plastic surgery. After attaining United States citizenship in 1900, he decided to try for a career as a dentist, and in 1902 was accepted by Harvard Dental School, qualifying in 1905. First World War He was married and successfully running his own dental practice when the First World War broke out, but he volunteered to join the Harvard Medical Corps, posted to a huge tented hospital complex in Camiers, France where he served British forces. There he began to treat some of the worst injuries suffered in trench war-fare - jaws, noses, cheeks and skulls shattered by bullets and grenades. Working under primitive conditions in makeshift hospitals near the battlefields of France, Varaztad H. Kazanjian exhibited humane concern combined with innovative medical procedures that established his reputation and marked his subsequent career as a founder of the modern practice of plastic surgery. He was subsequently promoted to the rank of major in June 1916. Career Dr. Kazanjian was Professor of Clinical Oral Surgery at Harvard from 1922 to 1941 when he was named Harvard's first Professor of Plastic Surgery. In addition, Dr. Kazanjian was past President of the American Association of Plastic Surgeons, the American Society of Maxillofacial Surgery, and the New England Society of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery. He was also a Fellow of the American College of Surgeons, the American Academy of Ophthalmology and Otolaryngology, and the American College of Dentists, and a diplomate of the American Board of Plastic Surgery. He was made an Honorary Fellow of the British Association of Plastic Surgeons in London in 1966 and of the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons in Glasgow in 1967. He was also an honorary member of the Massachusetts Dental Society, the American Society of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, and of the Academy of Oral Surgery. Awards and recognition He was awarded several awards including the Order of St Michael and St George by the King George V of England. In 1951, he was awarded the Honorary Award of the American Society of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeons. References  External Links  * Varaztad Hovhannes Kazanjian Papers, 1900-1979, 1984.

A bump key must correspond to the target lock in order to function correctly.http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/magazine-archive/2011/june/home- garden/best-door-locks/the-truth-behind-bump-keys/index.htm History A US patent first appears in 1928 by H. R. Simpson called a rapping key.High Security Mechanical Locks - An Encyclopaedic Reference published by Graham W. Pulford 2007, p. 19 In the 1970s, locksmiths in Denmark shared a technique for knocking on a lock cylinder while applying slight pressure to the back of the lock plug. When the pins would jump the inside of the cylinder, the plug would be able to slide out freely, thus enabling the locksmith to disassemble the lock quickly. The use of a bump key was not introduced until some time later and was first recognized as a potential security problem around 2002-2003 by Klaus Noch, who brought it to the attention of the German media. After further examination of the procedure, a white paper was drafted in 2005 by Barry Wels & Rop Gonggrijp of The Open Organization Of Lockpickers (TOOOL) detailing the method and its applicability. A patent exists for a lock device following the same principle as the bump key from 1926-1928\\\\. Marc Tobias, an American security expert, began to talk publicly in the United States about the technique and its potential security threats. In 2006, he released two further white papers regarding the technique and its potential legal ramifications.  Mechanics  In a pin tumbler lock, when the correct key is inserted, the gaps between the key pins (red) and driver pins (blue) align with the edge of the plug, called the shear line (yellow). A pin tumbler lock is composed of a series of spring-loaded stacks called pin stacks. Each pin stack is composed of two pins that are stacked on top of each other: the key pin, which touches the key when it is inserted, and the driver pin, which is spring driven. When the different length key pins are aligned at their tops by the insertion of the correspondingly cut key at their bases, the tops of the key pins and, consequently, the bases of the driver pins, form a shear line, so that the cylinder can be turned, rotating the key pins away from the driver pins. When no key or the wrong key is in the lock, pin misalignment prevents the cylinder from turning. To bump a lock, a person inserts a bump key into the key way one notch (pin) short of full insertion, then bumps the key inward to push it deeper into the key way. The specially designed teeth of the bump key transmit a slight impact to all of the key pins in the lock. The key pins transmit this force to the driver pins; the key pins stay in place. This is the same physical phenomenon seen in the desktop toy Newton's cradle. Because the pin movements are highly elastic, the driver pins \\"jump\\" from the key pins for a fraction of a second, moving above the cylinder (shear line of the tumbler), then are pushed back by the spring. With no other forces applied, the driver pins would come back to rest against the key pins once again, but the person applies a light rotational force to the key during the process and this causes the cylinder to turn during the short time that the driver pins are above the shear line, thus opening the lock. Lock bumping takes only an instant to open the lock. The lock is not visibly damaged, although the force of the bump can leave an indentation on the front of the cylinder. Certain clicking and vibrating tools designed for bumping can also be used. These allow for rapid repetition of bumping. Though some locks have advertised \\"bump proof\\" features, only a rare few key-pin locks cannot be bumped. A different tool with a similar principle of operation is a pick gun. Use by criminals Lock bumping is a trend in burglaries, which can make it easy and fast to break into homes without needing too much special equipment or leaving any trace of forced entry. It works almost as well as having a key, and a set of ten rapping keys can make the criminals capable of opening 90% of common tumbler locks.  Countermeasures  High-quality locks may be more vulnerable to bumping unless they employ specific countermeasures. More precise manufacturing tolerances within the cylinder make bumping easier because the mechanical tolerances of the lock are smaller, which means there is less loss of force in other directions and mostly pins move more freely and smoothly. Locks made of hardened steel are more vulnerable because they are less prone to damage during the bumping process that might cause a cheaper lock to jam. In the United Kingdom, a British standard TS007 Kitemark has been legislated which benchmarks the effectiveness of bumping at 1-star level and 3-star level. The former implies a minimum bump time of 1 minute while the latter offers much greater protection at a minimum bump time of 10 minutes. Security pins (e.g. spool or mushroom pins)--even when combined with a regular tumbler mechanism--generally make bumping somewhat more difficult but not impossible. Because a bump key must only have the same blank profile as the lock it is made to open, restricted or registered key profiles are not any safer from bumping. While the correct key blanks cannot be obtained legally without permission or registration with relevant locksmith associations, regular keys can be filed down to act as bump keys. Trap pins that engage when a pin does not support them will jam a lock's cylinder. Another countermeasure is shallow drilling, in which one or more of the pin stacks is drilled slightly shallower than the others. If an attempt is made on a lock that has shallow-drilled pin stacks, the bump key will be unable to bump the shallow-drilled pins because they are too high for the bump key to engage. Locks that only use programmable side bars and not top pins are bump-proof. BiLock is an example of this technology. Many bump-resistant locks are available which cannot be easily opened through the lock bumping method. Time locks, combination locks, electronic locks, electromagnetic locks, and locks using rotating disks, such as disc tumbler locks, are inherently invulnerable to this attack, since their mechanism does not contain springs. However, some electronic locks feature a key backup that is susceptible to bumping. Warded locks are not vulnerable to bumping, but they are vulnerable to a similar attack called a skeleton key, which is also a filed-down key. Changing the spring tension can help reduce bumping. A few sources inside the industry offer stronger top springs for conventional pinned locks. Changing one or two top springs to a firmer spring changes the ricochet tuning of the top pins, making it hard to bump.

Early life Balderson was born in Manhattan, Kansas and raised in nearby Wamego, Kansas until the age of twelve, when his family moved to Manhattan. Balderson attended Manhattan High School.\\" Balderson attended film school at California Institute of the Arts, where he directed six full-length digital movies, including a screen adaptation of Anne Rice's novel The Vampire Lestat. At the end of his third year at CalArts, Balderson realized he'd never had a mid-residency review. When he asked his dean, Hartmut Bitomsky, Bitomsky answered, \\"Master's students don't have mid-residency reviews.\\" When Bitomsky learned Balderson was an undergrad, he instructed Balderson to stop going to his classes and instead, to do independent study with him. Once a week the two would meet and dissect Alfred Hitchcock films and Steve learned how to focus his vision. After months of working one-on-one with his dean, Balderson decided he was ready to leave CalArts without graduating. Films right *Pep Squad: After leaving CalArts in 1996, Balderson returned to Kansas and directed his debut feature film.

The Constitution of the United States specifically charges the National Guard with dual federal and state missions. In fact, the National Guard is the only United States military force empowered to function in a state status. Those functions range from limited actions during non-emergency situations to full scale law enforcement of martial law when local law enforcement officials can no longer maintain civil control. The National Guard may be called into federal service in response to a call by the President or Congress. The Minnesota Army National Guard is composed of approximately 11,000 Soldiers, spread out in 65 training and community centers across the state. When National Guard troops are called to federal service, the President serves as Commander-in-Chief. The federal mission assigned to the National Guard is: \\"To provide properly trained and equipped units for prompt mobilization for war, National emergency or as otherwise needed.\\" The Governor may call individuals or units of the Minnesota National Guard into state service during emergencies or to assist in special situations which lend themselves to use of the National Guard. The state mission assigned to the National Guard is: \\"To provide trained and disciplined forces for domestic emergencies or as otherwise provided by state law.\\" The State Defense force is a military entity authorized by both the State Code of Minnesota and executive order. The State Defense Force (SDF) is the state‚Äôs authorized militia and assumes the state mission of the Minnesota National Guard in the event the Guard is mobilized. The SDF is composed of retired active and reserve military personnel and selected professional persons who volunteer their time and talents in further service to their state. The Minnesota Army National Guard is a component of the United States Army and the United States National Guard. Nationwide, the Army National Guard comprises approximately one half of the US Army's available combat forces and approximately one third of its support organization. National coordination of various state National Guard units are maintained through the National Guard Bureau. Minnesota Army National Guard units are trained and equipped as part of the United States Army. The same ranks and insignia are used and National Guardsmen are eligible to receive all United States military awards. The Minnesota Guard also bestows a number of state awards for local services rendered in or to the state of Minnesota. Units and Formations See list of Minnesota National Guard units. Duties National Guard units can be mobilized at any time by presidential order to supplement regular armed forces, and upon declaration of a state of emergency by the governor of the state in which they serve. Unlike Army Reserve members, National Guard members cannot be mobilized individually (except through voluntary transfers and Temporary DutY Assignments TDY), but only as part of their respective units. However, there has been a significant number of individual activations to support military operations (2001-?); the legality of this policy is a major issue within the National Guard. =Active Duty Callups= For much of the final decades of the twentieth century, National Guard personnel typically served \\"One weekend a month, two weeks a year\\", with a portion working for the Guard in a full-time capacity. The current forces formation plans of the US Army call for the typical National Guard unit (or National Guardsman) to serve one year of active duty for every three years of service. More specifically, current Department of Defense policy is that no Guardsman will be involuntarily activated for a total of more than 24 months (cumulative) in one six year enlistment period (this policy is due to change 1 August 2007, the new policy states that soldiers will be given 24 months between deployments of no more than 24 months, individual states have differing policies). History The Minnesota Army National Guard was originally formed in 1856. The Militia Act of 1903 organized the various state militias into the present National Guard system. Two cavalry regiments with long ties to the Minnesota Army National Guard are the 94th Cavalry Regiment and the 194th Cavalry Regiment. The origins of the 94th Cavalry lie with the 1st Battalion, 136th Infantry Regiment (United States). On 22 February 1959 the 1-136 Infantry was converted and redesignated the 2nd Reconnaissance Squadron, 194th Armor (47th Infantry Division (United States)). \\"Additional copies of this publication may be requested by writing National Guard Bureau, ATTN: NGB-PAH, 2500 Army Pentagon, Washington DC 20310-2500.\\" Became 2nd Bn, 194th Armor in 1963, remaining with the 47th Infantry Division. The battalion was reorganized and redesignated on 1 Feb 68 as the 194th Armor, a CARS regiment, consisting of the 2nd Battalion, still with the 47th ID; reorganised and redesignated 8 Jan 72 as the 94th Armor, a CARS regiment, consisting of the 1st Battalion, an element of the 47th Infantry Division. Transferred with HQ at Duluth from CARS to USARS 1 June 1989. 1-94 Armor transferred to 34th Infantry Division on 1 September 1991.

He played college football at University of Southern California (USC) and professionally in the National Football League (NFL) and the All-America Football Conference (AFC). He, along with Harry Marker, are the only NFL players to serve in World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War. Biography Born in Los Angeles, California, and raised during the Great Depression, Heywood received a football scholarship to attend college at the University of Southern California (USC). Despite having football scholarship, he took a job as a busboy at a sorority house, while attending USC. As two-way end, he was a captain on the 1943 USC team that finished with an 8‚Äì2 record. He was unable to play in USC's a 29‚Äì0 win over Washington in the Rose Bowl, due to being drafted into the United States Marine Corps and sent to the South Pacific Ocean to serve on the . In his absence he was awarded an All-America honors as an end and punter in 1943, despite playing in only 5 games that season. Heywood initially enlisted in the Marine Corps in 1943 to fight in World War II. He entered the V-12 program, which was initiated to meet the increased need for Navy and Marine Corps officers, allowed him to stay in school while learning the military basics. The program allowed officer candidates to attend civilian schools while in an enlisted status in the Navy or Marine Corps. However, he was shipped off to the USS Iowa, before he had a chance to graduate. In prior years, he led the Trojans in receiving yards in 1942 and 1943, and had the school's first-ever 100-yard receiving game when he gained 101 yards on 4 receptions versus St. Mary's Pre- Flight in 1943. He also led USC in punting in 1941 and 1942. After his initial discharge from the Marines following World War II, Heywood completed his degree in cinematography at USC. When he left USC for the war, he was eight units short of graduating. However, the university awarded him 10 units in military science, based on his service, allowing him to graduate. He then played for the Chicago Rockets, of the All-America Football Conferences in 1946. In 1947 he moved to the NFL, playing the next two season for the Detroit Lions. The Lions had originally selected Heywood in the 1944 NFL draft while he was still at fighting in the war. In 1948, he played for the Boston Yanks and the New York Bulldogs in 1949. In 1952, during the Korean War, he returned to active duty. He later commanded the 26th Marine Regiment in South Vietnam. He rose to the rank of colonel and was discharged from the Marines in 1974. After retiring from active duty, Heywood became the Commandant of the Marine Military Academy, located in Harlingen, Texas. He played tennis with Charlton Heston and was a golf buddy of Bob Hope. On August 9, 2004, Heywood made an appearance, when he delivered the game ball at the Pro Football Hall of Fame Game, between the Washington Redskins and Denver Broncos. On April 10, 2007, Heywood died in Bandera, Texas, while laying in the arms of his wife, Suzie, as she softly sang to him. During a ceremony on January 25, 2013, he was inducted into the Marine Corps Sports Hall of Fame.

It was originally two outdoor flights of granite-clad stairs and an escalator that connected Vesey Street to the World Trade Center's Austin J. Tobin Plaza. During the September 11 attacks, the stairs served as an escape route for hundreds of evacuees from 5 World Trade Center, a 9-floor building adjacent to the 110-story towers. The staircase is now an important feature of the National September 11 Memorial & Museum. Preservation efforts The preservation of the staircase became a matter of dispute since May 11, 2006, when it was listed as one of America's Most Endangered Places by the National Trust for Historic Preservation. The stairs occupied part of the site of a new office building which the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey was contractually obliged to clear before the site was turned over to developer Larry Silverstein of Silverstein Properties, who in turn has a contractual obligation to develop the site as the 200 Greenwich Street office building, which is also referenced as \\"Tower 2\\" in the master plan. The World Trade Center Survivors' Network urged the Port Authority and Silverstein to make a commitment to preserve the stairs, but neither made a public decision on the issue. Meanwhile, the already heavily damaged stairs continued to deteriorate due to the heavy vibrations caused by construction of the permanent PATH station, the World Trade Center Memorial and 1 World Trade Center on the site. In January 2007, the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation (LMDC), according to Real Estate Weekly, rejected a plan proposed by structural engineer Robert Silman, who functioned as an independent consultant, to move the staircase in its entirety. Silman estimated the move would cost somewhere between $500,000 and $700,000 to complete. Those supporting dismantling the staircase claimed such a procedure would cost over $2 million. In early August 2007, Avi Schick, Governor Eliot Spitzer's redevelopment chief, outlined plans to remove the stairs from their concrete structure for eventual use in the World Trade Center Memorial museum. All 38 steps would be inlaid into the side of the staircase leading from the visitor's center to the underground museum. Confirming earlier plans, the LMDC announced on October 31, 2007 that the stairs would be removed and preserved, and would be restored in the future at a location inside the World Trade Center Memorial museum with a display explaining their significance. On March 9, 2008, the Staircase was moved by crane about 200 feet on Vesey Street.World Trade Center Staircase Moved In 2010, as construction throughout the World Trade complex reached peak activity level, the staircase ‚Äì as well as two \\"tridents\\" of Twin Tower facade, and other oversize artifacts ‚Äì was placed into the National September 11 Memorial & Museum space before the Memorial Plaza and museum entrance pavilion were built above it.

It is a part of the Columbus City Schools district. The school is a magnet school for college-bound students in Columbus, with both AP and IB programs. While most Columbus City schools are assigned a neighborhood to whose residents they guarantee admission, places at CAHS are available exclusively through the district's school lottery. Historically, CAHS has not fielded sports teams, and students have had the option to play sports at the schools in their home neighborhoods. As of 2009-2010, CAHS has an Ultimate Frisbee team that plays in the Central Ohio Ultimate League. CAHS also fields a nationally-rated chess team, as well as In The Know and Robotics teams. The school is often referred to by its abbreviation, CAHS (pronounced \\"cause\\"). The school's mascot is Pegasus of Greek mythology. Academics CAHS students participate in an internship program beginning their junior year. The program, which fulfills the community-service requirements of the district, is designed to provide real-world experience. Students choose their own sponsors, who range from local artisans to politicians to teachers. Students report to their site on Wednesdays in place of attending classes. Also, CAHS has offered an International Baccalaureate diploma program for 11th and 12th graders since the 2005-2006 school year. Students are required to take an AP, IB, or Post Secondary course at least one time before their graduation. History The Columbus Alternative High School was conceived in 1977, initially as part of a plan to save the original Columbus North High School, now Columbus International High School from closure. As part of its plan to comply with a 1977 court order to desegregate Columbus high schools, the Columbus Board of Education had announced that many students would be bussed to other neighborhoods beginning in the fall of 1978, and that certain schools, including North High School, would be closed. A group of teachers, led by would-be principal Timothy Ilg, proposed a new magnet school to occupy the North High School building, featuring independent study and a rigorous curriculum. Nearly 700 students (mostly freshmen and sophomores) from around metropolitan Columbus applied for entry. Then, in the summer of 1978, a temporary stay was placed on the court order. The desegregation plan was postponed, North High School was saved, and the CAHS plan was shelved. That summer, a call went out to all applicants interested in saving the alternative school idea. Since the majority of applicants and teachers had been from the North High School neighborhood, fewer than 75 applicants and families expressed interest. However, Ilg sought and obtained assurances from the Columbus Board of Education that if he could recruit 100 students and funding via outside grants, space would be provided for the school. In the fall of 1978, with enough money to operate for only one semester, and a reported enrollment of exactly 100 students, the Columbus Alternative High School opened as a half-day program on the third floor of Mohawk Elementary School in downtown Columbus. CAHS students spent their mornings at Mohawk Elementary and were bussed to their neighborhood schools in the afternoons for science and physical education programs. As a half-day program, CAHS was not able to grant degrees to its eight seniors. The following year, enrollment surpassed 100 students, and CAHS was moved to the top floor of McGuffey Elementary School (now closed), where the half-day program again shared space with a grade school. In 1980, bolstered by a number of high-profile academic awards and a growing reputation for excellence, requests for enrollment surged, and the school received a $300,000 federal grant, permitting it to expand and become a full-time program. The first CAHS degrees were granted to the class of 1981. Accomplishments Columbus Alternative High School has received a silver medal from U.S. News & World Report magazine as one of the nation's top high schools. Columbus Alternative High School has earned the Central Region Triple Crown Award from the Ohio School Boards Association, the only high school of 300 in the l4-county central region to be honored by Newsweek and U.S. News & World Report and to be designated by the Ohio Department of Education as a School of Promise. This is the third consecutive time CAHS has won this award. Over ninety percent of CAHS graduates attend college afterward, and each graduating class has earned millions of dollars in scholarships. The College Board recognized Columbus Alternative High School as one of seven schools in the country for the advancement of higher level math and science for minority students. National Chess champions CAHS chess teams have won eleven consecutive city and state championships from 1998 to 2010. In December 2008, CAHS's four-member senior chess team won the 12th Grade National Chess Championship title at the National Grade Level Chess Championship in Orlando, Florida.

Forth has a population of about 711. Previously known as Hamilton-on-Forth, the village predates the larger settlement of Devonport.Forth, The Sydney Morning Herald, 8 February 2004. Nearby is the Forthside Dairy Research Facility run by the Tasmanian Institute of Agricultural Research. History James Fenton, a young man of Irish descent came to the Forth estuary in 1839 in search of arable land. Assisted by his hired male companion, he erected the first European edifice in the district, and in 1840 returned to take up permanent settlement. He was soon to be followed by Andrew Risby, his wife and young family and a handful of other settlers seeking a new life.F. C. Green, Fenton, James (1820 - 1901), Australian Dictionary of Biography, Volume 4, Melbourne University Press, 1972, pp 162-163. Fenton expended large sums of money attempting to drain the estuarine swamplands which he hoped would produce ideal cropping fields. This venture failed and he resorted to moving further inland to the rich, although heavily timbered soils of the sloping ground to the west. Fenton is attributed to introducing the practice of ring-barking the large eucalyptus trees to allow light to penetrate the forest floor where the first domestic crops were grown. The district produced fine crops of potatoes in those early years. Forth Post Office opened on 12 May 1856 (it was known as Hamilton On Forth between 1868 and 1876).

Laingen is best known for having been the most senior American official held hostage during the Iran hostage crisis, while serving as the charg√© d'affaires (head of diplomatic mission) at the U.S. Embassy in Tehran. Early life, naval service, and education Laingen was born on a farm near Butterfield and Odin in Watonwan County, Minnesota. During World War II, Laingen served in the U.S. Navy in the South Pacific as a lieutenant.Sepic, Matt, \\"Former diplomat, Iran hostage and Minnesota native Bruce Laingen dies\\", Minnesota Public Radio News, July 17, 2019. After the war he graduated from St. Olaf College and obtained an M.A. in International Relations from the University of Minnesota. He also studied at the National War College in 1968. Diplomatic career In 1949 Laingen joined the U.S. Foreign Service. He served at posts in Germany, Iran, Pakistan, and Afghanistan, and was then appointed Ambassador to Malta by President Gerald Ford in 1977. Laingen was then sent back to Iran as the U.S. charg√© d'affaires in June 1979, after ambassador William H. Sullivan and charg√© d'affaires Charlie Naas were relieved of their posts by President Jimmy Carter. Laingen had previously served in Iran during the 1950s. On November 4, 1979, the U.S. embassy was overrun by student protesters following the Iranian Revolution. 63 hostages were taken at the embassy, while Laingen and two others were seized at the Iranian Foreign Ministry Office. Mrs. Laingen tied a yellow ribbon about the oak at their home during the crisis. Laingen and 51 hostages were released on January 20, 1981, following 444 days of captivity. Laingen remains the last American head of mission to Iran, as direct bilateral diplomatic relations between the two governments were severed following the seizure of the embassy and have not been restored since.

History The site on which Barryscourt castle now stands has been occupied for over a thousand years- there is evidence of a wooden watermill having been built next to a stream at the site sometime in the 7th century, long before any fortification existed there. Barryscourt fell into the hands of the Anglo-Norman de Barry family in the 12th century, and masonry from this period found at the site may be the remains of another watermill or possibly an early fortification built by the Barrys. While the de Barry's lands in various parts of County Cork were divided amongst various branches of the family, Barryscourt remained in the possession of the most powerful branch, the Barrymores (Barra m√≥r or \\"Great Barry\\" in Irish). The Barrymore line later became extinct, Barryscourt thus passing to a distant cousin, James FitzRichard of the Barryroes (Barra rua, \\"Red Barry\\"), in 1556. The present Tower house at Barryscourt was probably built late in the reign of the Barrymores, either in the 15th or 16th century, with a tentative date of about 1550 based on the architectural style, and became the family seat of the Barrys. The Barrys supported the Desmond Rebellions of 1569 and 1579, and in 1581 they destroyed or severely damaged the family castles to prevent English forces from capturing them, including Barryscourt, which was threatened by an army led by Sir Walter Raleigh. After the suppression of the second rebellion, the Barrys were pardoned by Queen Elizabeth I and Barryscourt was repaired, with an outer wall or \\"bawn\\" surrounding an inner courtyard being added, including 3 corner towers. Barryscourt ceased to be main residence of the Barry family in 1617, but was evidently still an important fortification for many years afterwards, as it was attacked and captured in 1645, during the Irish Confederate War. The marks caused by the impact of cannonballs during this attack can still be seen on the castle walls. Barryscourt castle eventually fell into disuse, and a house was built by the Coppinger family (who had taken over the property from the Barrys) next to the castle in the early 18th century; this house has long since disappeared. The Barryscourt Trust was set up in 1987 for the purpose of conserving and developing the potential of the castle as a heritage site. In the 1990s, the relatively intact shell of the tower house was repaired and reroofed by D√∫chas, and is now a popular tourist heritage site run by the Office of Public Works. The interior is furnished as it would have been in the 16th century. The castle has daily guided tours available free of charge. Barryscourt Castle Architecture Barryscourt castle was built in a style fairly typical in Ireland in the 16th century, consisting of a main tower house building with smaller adjacent buildings arranged around a courtyard, which was protected by an outer \\"bawn\\" or curtain wall, with 3 smaller corner towers. A large building once stood next to the main tower inside the bawn, and was probably a dining hall, but only ruins remain. The main tower is situated at the south- west corner of the roughly rectangular curtain wall and the main entrance to the courtyard is right next to it, set into the south curtain wall (there is also a smaller gate in the north curtain wall). The dungeon is a drop- prisoner-in-from-the-top type. Three smaller turrets project from the north- east, south-east and south-west corners of the main tower. These three turrets are 5 storeys high, while the main block of the tower is only 3 storeys high. See also *List of castles in Ireland References Medieval Ireland: The Barryscourt Lectures I-X.

Ceri () is a small town in the Lazio (central Italy), a frazione of the comune of Cerveteri, in the Metropolitan City of Rome. It occupies a fortified plateau of tuff at a short distance from the city of Cerveteri. History Inhabited before the 7th century BC, the town's native population changed several times, from Etruscans to Romans. Numerous tombs from the Etruscan and Roman periods can be found in the area. The town as it looks today was founded in 1236 when the inhabitants of its Caere neighbour abandoned the former to be better protected by rock formations. To this, they gave the name of Caere Novum (simply Ceri, not to be confused with another neighbour, Cerenova), in order to distinguish it from the ancient city, Caere Vetus (today Cerveteri). In the same period, the castle was constructed for the defence of the town. View of fortified walls. Since the 14th century, Ceri became the property of some of the greatest Italian families: from the Anguillara (of which the greatest exponent was Renzo da Ceri) to Cesi, the Borromeo, the Odescalchi, and ended with the Torlonia, who are still owners of a large part of Ceri.

He was a right-handed batsman who played for both Warwickshire and Worcestershire, captaining the latter county between 1947 and 1949, though sharing the captaincy with Bob Wyatt in the last of those three seasons. He also played for Cambridge University, as well as making a single appearance for Free Foresters. Curiously, he passed fifty 26 times without ever going on to score a century. Early life and education Born in Earlsdon, Coventry, White was educated at Uppingham School before going up to Pembroke College, Cambridge. He made his first-class debut for Cambridge University against Sussex in May 1936, scoring 93 (which was to remain his highest score for the university) before being out lbw to the bowling of Charles Oakes. He won his blue that season, playing in the Varsity Match at Lord's where he made 19 and 5. He also played six games for Warwickshire in the County Championship, often getting a good start though never going on to a big score, and finishing with 272 runs at an average of 30.22, placing him third in the county's averages. County cricket career In 1937 White continued to play for Cambridge, although without winning another blue. He also made a further two appearances for Warwickshire, although his four innings totalled just 14 runs. He was then out of first- class cricket for a while before moving to Worcestershire in 1939, and although his record was mediocre (386 runs at 13.78, with a top score of only 47) he was kept on by the county when cricket resumed after World War II, enjoying his most successful season in 1946 with 1,179 first-class runs and a career-best 95 against the Combined Services. In 1947 White was made Captain of Worcestershire. This proved to be a good choice ‚Äì his obituary in Wisden called him \\"a popular and enterprising leader\\"Obituaries in 1993. Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, 1994. ‚Äì and he again passed a thousand runs for the season, albeit from 54 innings, the most he was ever to play in a single summer. From 1948 onwards his attentions were increasingly taken up by his off-field responsibilities as a mushroom farmer and after a final season for Worcestershire in 1949 (a successful year in which they came third in the County Championship), he retired from first-class cricket. However, he played on for several years afterwards, representing the county's Second XI. Death White died in Worcester at the age of 77.

Biography  M. V. Devan was born on January 15, 1928 at Panniyannur, a small village in Thalassery in the south Indian state of Kerala. After completing high school in 1946, he left for Madras to study painting. At Chennai, he joined the Government College of Fine Arts, Chennai where he had the opportunity to study under D. P. Roy Choudhury and K. C. S. Paniker, the then principal and vice principal of the institution. It was during this time itself, he met M. Govindan, who influenced his thinking. Returning to Kerala, he was involved in many artistic, cultural and literary movements, besides his own artistic pursuits. Devan was married to Sreedevi and the couple had two daughters, Jameela and Shalini. He died on April 29, 2014, at the age of 86, at his residence in Aluva, survived by his daughters; his wife had predeceased him.  Career and legacy  On his return from Chennai in 1952, he joined Mathrubhumi daily at their Kozhikode office as a staff artist and stayed there until 1961 when he got an opportunity as an art consultant with Southern Languages Book Trust, Chennai. A year later, he quit the job when the Lalit Kala Akademi, Chennai was established to work as its founder secretary; during his tenure, the academy was a meeting point for the Chennai-based artists and this was known to have served as an inspiration for the formation of Cholamandal Artists' Village, of which he was also a founder member. Later, he moved to the New Delhi office of the academy in 1996 for a two year stint and it was during this time he came in touch with M. K. K. Nair, the visionary civil servant, with whom he was involved in the organization of the All India Writers‚Äô Conference in Aluva. Nair, who headed the Fertilizers and Chemicals Travancore Limited (FACT) during those days, invited Devan as an art consultant with Fact Engineering and Design Organisation (Fedo), a division of FACT and he worked for FACT till 1972, a year after Nair left the company to take up the position of a joint secretary at the Planning Commission of India. In 1977, Devan was selected as the chairman of the Kerala Lalithakala Akademi, a post he held till 1977. Simultaneously, he ran an architectural design firm, Perunthachan, where he practised environment-friendly cost-effective construction techniques, a pioneering effort much before Laurie Baker popularised the concept in the state; he designed around 450 constructions, which include auditoria, hotels and church. After his tenure with Kerala Lalithakala Akademi ended in 1977, he continued his involvement with the fine arts, literature and cultural activities; the founding of Nadaka Kalari, a theatre group based in Vaikom, in 1967, along with M. Govindan, C. N. Sreekantan Nair, K. S. Narayana Pillai, K. Ayyappa Paniker and G. Sankara Pillai, was one among them. Devan founded Kerala Kalapeedom, art and cultural centre based in Kochi, in 1978, where several artists such as T. Kaladharan, M. R. D. Dattan, C. N. Karunakaran and Artist Namboothiri; he would also chair the organization later. He was also involved in the founding of two art villages, Malayala Kalagramam, in New Mahe and Kalagramam, in Kollam. Navashakti, Gopuram, Sameeksha, Kerala Kavita and Jwala were some of the literary publications he was associated with. Devan compiled the articles he had published earlier, as an essay anthology, under the title, Devaspandanam, in 2001. Devan's paintings and sculptures have been exhibited in many paces in India. T. Kaladharan, one of his proteges, has cataloged his drawings, paintings, graphic paints, and sculptures which has since been published by the Kerala Lalithakala Akademi, under the title, Remembering M. V. Devan. In 2019, the family members of Devan, primarily his daughters and grandchildren, as a commemoration of Devan‚Äôs art and legacy, initiated the ‚ÄòM V Devan Puraskaram‚Äô - an award in Devan‚Äôs name. It was envisaged to render recognition to exemplary icons in the field of visual arts. The primary M V Devan Puraskaram was presented to artist NKP Muthukoya on 29 April 2019, the death anniversary of Devan.  Awards and honours  Devaspandanam, which is considered by many the magnum opus of Devan, was selectd for two awards, starting with the Vayalar Award in 2000, followed by the Mathrubhumi Literary Award in 2003. The book would also receive Malayattoor Award later. In between, he received the Raja Ravi Varma Puraskaram of the Kerala Lalithakala Akademi in 2002. He also received the fellowship of the academy as well as the fellowship of the Chennai Lalit Kala Akademi. The other honours received by Devan include the Critics Award and the M. K. K. Nair Award. On the occasion of his first death anniversary, an event was organized in Kochi, Remembering Devan, which featured several lectures and an exhibition of Devan's paintings as well as the works of some of his contemporaries including Tyeb Mehta, F. N. Souza, K. K. Hebbar, Laxma Goud, Bhupen Khakhar and Akbar Padamsee. Binuraj Kalapeedam, one of his students at Kerala Kalapeedam, has made a documentary on the life of Devan, titled Devaspandanam, the title of his award winning book.

Haas, and later incorporated in 1990. ALPO is an organization for advancing and conducting astronomical work by both professional and amateur astronomers who share an interest in solar system observations.ALPO website, \\"About ALPO\\" tab (see External links). It is currently headquartered in Springfield, Illinois. ALPO studies solar system objects such as the Sun, the Earth's Moon, planets, asteroids, meteors, and comets. ALPO stimulates, coordinates, and generally promotes the study of these bodies using methods and instruments available within the communities of both amateur and professional astronomers. The organization holds a conference each summer, usually in conjunction with other astronomical groups. Sections ALPO had no initial formal structure but later found it necessary to specialize as its membership chose to narrow their studies to certain favored observed celestial objects. ALPO adopted a similar structure with sections like that of the British Astronomical Association (BAA) in order to properly study the objects observed. ALPO established interest sections as needed, such as the Saturn Section. Each section would be directed by an individual known as a \\"recorder\\", which later became known as \\"coordinator\\" (a term still used today). Julius L. Benton still serves to the present day as the first coordinator of the ALPO Saturn Section since its founding in 1971.(2006) McKim, The Observatory. One of its most active sections over the decades has been its Lunar Section which would record, extensively draw, and record features on the Earth's Moon, including transient lunar phenomenon (TLP) [also known as lunar transient phenomenon (LTP)].(1996) Benton, S&T.; ALPO's \\"Lunar Recorder\\" for 1957-1961 was Alika K. Herring, an individual whose drawings of lunar craters would appear several times in the astronomical magazine Sky & Telescope.Sky & Telescope, various issues, between 1958-1967. Herring would help determine astronomical seeing conditions in Hawaii in conjunction with observations taken by Franklin E. Roach (not ALPO affiliated) that would eventually determine the establishments of various telescope facilities. The 19 various sections fall into two main categories: observing, and special. Many of these sections participate with online discussion boards subgroups contained in Yahoo! Groups on the internet. =Observing Sections= Fourteen sections specialize as \\"Observing Sections\\". Moving outward from the Sun, they are by object (12): Solar, Mercury, Venus, Meteorite, Meteors, Lunar, Mars, Minor Planets, Jupiter, Saturn, Remote Planets, and Comets. By additional phenomena (2) they are: Eclipse, and Transit. =Special Sections= Five sections serve functionally as \\"Special Sections\\", fulfilling historical and administrative purposes. They are, alphabetically: Computing, Historical, Publications, Training Program, and Youth Programs. Publications ALPO publishes a quarterly periodical, The Strolling Astronomer - The Journal of the Association of Lunar and Planetary Observers (, ) since 1947, referred to by abbreviation as both StAst and JALPO. It has published other material on specialized subjects like Saturn,(1975) Benton. sometimes later becoming a major publication of note through a major publisher.(2006) Benton. ALPO also occasionally issues small works on either astronomical topics or their conference proceedings in its ALPO Monographs series. In context, the journal StAst-JALPO was started by its founder Haas in order to provide an archive and formal scholarly study of objects where no existing journal would adequately address publication needs or access. The journal establishment was similar to the starting of The Astrophysical Journal and The Astronomical Journal by George Ellery Hale. ALPO's journal filled a void in planetary science for over a decade prior to the founding of the journal Icarus by Carl Sagan in 1962. The Minor Planets section of ALPO publishes The Minor Planet Bulletin.

Once that was no longer happening, in 2014 at the end of the season they played Whetstone, which isn't considered a ‚Äúrivalry‚Äù , but is Mifflin's City League North Foe. Mifflin developed a lot of rivalries within their division which include Beechcroft High School and Northland High School which are predominately played in the middle of the season back to back. Beechcroft was also Brookhaven's rival also. Beechcroft and Brookhaven are exactly 3.8 mi apart, which made the rivalry more intense. Once Brookhaven closed most of the students that attended were transferred to Mifflin. Then came ‚ÄúThe Battle of the North‚Äù between Beechcroft and Mifflin, and also Northland and Mifflin.

Naltrexone is typically prescribed for opioid dependence or alcohol dependence, as it is a strong opioid antagonist. It has been suggested that LDN might operate as an anti-inflammatory agent and therefore be used to treat some chronic conditions such as chronic pain, but the research is still highly experimental and few studies have been replicated. Some proponents of low-dose naltrexone have brought forth unproven claims about its efficacy in treating a wide range of diseases, including cancer, chronic fatigue syndrome and HIV/AIDS. Mechanism of action = Action of naltrexone = Naltrexone and its active metabolite 6-Œ≤-naltrexol are competitive antagonists at Œº-opioid and Œ∫-opioid receptors, and to a lesser extent at Œ¥-opioid receptors. Standard therapeutic doses of naltrexone blocks these receptors, which does two things; it prevents inhibition of GABA receptors (normally, signalling through the GABA receptors inhibits the activity of neurons; many recreational drugs inhibit GABA and thus \\"free up\\" neuronal activation; preventing inhibition of GABA allows GABA's normal inhibition activity to take place) and it blocks dopamine release (many recreational drugs stimulate dopamine release, which is part of the brain's reward system that creates pleasure). = Hypothesised action of LDN = Low-dose naltrexone refers to doses about 1/10th the size of the dose used normally, typically 4.5 mg or within a couple of milligrams of that value. It is hypothesised that low-dose naltrexone may inhibit opioid receptors and therefore cause the body to increase production of endorphins and upregulate the immune system; it may also antagonize Toll-like receptor 4 that are found on macrophages, including microglia, and any reported anti- inflammatory effects might be due to that. These apparent effects have not been seen at standard doses or in major trials. Researchers have also examined \\"ultra-low-doses\\" of naltrexone at microgram, nanogram, and picogram doses, that are co-administered with opioid analgesics with the goal of increasing pain relief and reducing side effects. Research Organizations promoting low-dose naltrexone have advocated it as a treatment for a variety of medical conditions, but research has not demonstrated its effectiveness. No peer- reviewed studies that would justify clinical use of low-dose naltrexone in treating multiple sclerosis (MS) have been published. As of 2015 the UK National Health Service had concluded that it could not be recommended for treating the symptoms of multiple sclerosis due a lack of evidence. Prescription and medical formulation of low-dose naltrexone in the UK are unlicensed in the treatment of multiple sclerosis. Criticisms In addition to proposed uses for low-dose naltrexone that have been studied in clinical research, low-dose naltrexone advocates make unproven claims of its efficacy in treating other conditions, including: various types of cancer, Alzheimer's disease, HIV/AIDS, rheumatoid arthritis, and others. Steven Novella of the Yale University School of Medicine disputed these claims as unsupported by rigorous clinical research, calling many applications pseudoscientific.

History =Grimsby College of Further Education= It was known as Grimsby Technical College in the 1950s, administered by the County Borough of Grimsby Education Committee, becoming Grimsby College of Further Education in the 1960s, offering three-year HNDs (a higher education qualification) in food science, and also applied chemistry. It was based at Nuns Corner. The food science course involved six months of teaching and six months in industry per year. In 1966 it became Grimsby College of Technology, and was heavily involved with training people for food science careers; which was of considerable importance to the economy of Grimsby. =Grimsby College of Technology= By 1967 it was also offering HNDs in Refrigeration Engineering, Analytical Chemistry and Chemical Engineering. Refrigeration was taught on a site on Weelsby Street. It also offered courses in training for the British Merchant Navy. It hosted food science conferences. By 1968 it was also offering HNDs in Business Studies and Mechanical Engineering (refrigeration or environmental). Its departments included: * Food and Fashion * Science and Mathematics * Engineering * Management and Business Studies. * School of Art * Maritime Studies and Fisheries * Building * General Studies (the humanities) * Grimsby School of Nursing By the early 1970s it was offering four HNDs ‚Äì Business, Refrigeration Engineering, Food Technology, and Food Science (Applied Chemistry). Its HNC courses also were food or chemical industry based, to train technicians. By 1972 it had a department of Science and Food Technology, as well as Food and Fashion (which looked at catering qualifications, not the chemistry involved). In 1973 it was offering an Applied Biology HND (with options of Nutrition and Biochemistry). In April 1974 administration transferred to Humberside Education Committee, and more HNDs (briefly) included Data Processing and Marketing and Advertising. By 1989 more arts courses were being offered than science, so the college name became Grimsby College of Technology & Arts (GCTA), then just Grimsby College in 1993. In 2004 in its 60th anniversary year, it became Grimsby Institute. =Connections with Humberside University= By September 1982 it was offering its same set of four food-industry-related HND through Hull College of HE on Inglemore Avenue in Hull. On 1 January 1983, the Humberside College of HE came into existence, through integrating Grimsby's HND courses with the Hull College of HE. At this point, it was becoming a full-fledged HE college. On 11 June 1990, the HE College, at Hull, became Humberside Polytechnic. Three of its thirteen sites were in Grimsby (its food and fisheries site), one being the College of Technology's food-industry-related HE courses. The plan was to reduce the number of sites to four by the mid-1990s: three in Hull and one in Grimsby. The grand plans and vision for expansion of the polytechnic extended as far as Lincoln, York and Scarborough. This would almost actually happen: except (conversely) Lincoln would be the centre, extending as far north as Hull; Grimsby would be jettisoned. The former Humberside Polytechnic, which became the University of Humberside in 1992 (and essentially closed down in Hull when it became the University of Lincoln in 2002), had its Food, Fisheries and Environmental Studies site adjacent to Grimsby College on Bargate, which became the School of Applied Science and Technology with around 500 students. It offered BSc courses in Food Science. It offered a similar range of courses to that of the University of Lincoln's current site in Holbeach. In the 1990s it offered HNDs in wine-making (oenology) Grimsby College, as it was known from 1993, was known as an 'Associate College' of the University of Humberside, and offered a wide range of HNDs, not its former range of food-industry courses, although it even offered an HND in Viticulture and Vinification, which became the UK's first degree course in Oenology (wine- making) in 1994, run by Mike Grubb. It offered a Sports Science HND through Nottingham Trent University. The type of degree courses it offered were social science, business, humanities, and marketing & tourism. The former food department was not part of the college. In 1999 it began to offer Broadcast Journalism and Media Production courses, and in 2000 it branched out to ECE Television, which became East Coast Media, which worked with GTV (owned by Granada). In 2015, The Media Production Course was renamed from East Coast Media to Estuary Student TV. This was to reflect on the Estuary TV brand which is the Local Television Channel owned by the Grimsby Institute. =Higher education college= In 2004 it became the Grimsby Institute of Further & Higher Education. Its connection (associate college status) with the former University of Lincolnshire and Humberside (formed in 1996) finished when this changed its name to the University of Lincoln in 2002, which rapidly closed most of its main Hull site down (now occupied by the Hull York Medical School), concentrating it all in Lincoln. Grimsby Institute was now separate from any partner university. In 2006 it sponsored the Pyewipe roundabout on the A180. The Humber Food School was moved from Grimsby to Lincoln. The Food Refrigeration and Process Engineering Research Centre (FRPERC) moved to the College in August 2009. Ray Ellis took over as acting principal from Professor Daniel Khan OBE in February 2010, who had been there for nine years. In July 2010 the Institute announced that Sue Middlehurst had accepted the post of Principal. Structure It is situated at the junction of the A1243 and A46, just north of the Diana, Princess of Wales Hospital. =Main campus= The Institute's main campus is at Nuns Corner in Grimsby, and it has 12 branch sites. In 2006 the Institute had around 23,000 students.

Graduation ceremonies are held in October. College future The College has plans to achieve University status in the future, possibly to replace what the Humberside Polytechnic formerly offered in the Humber region. A¬£16 million university centre opened in 2011. Construction work began on 15 February 2010. Due to a Scarborough further education college's financial problems caused by its small size, the Yorkshire Coast College merged with the Grimsby Institute on 1 January 2010.2010 Merger Merger proposals were first announced in October 2008.

The series, conceived by Ellis as a parody of the Marvels series by Kurt Busiek and Alex Ross, is set in a dystopian version of the Marvel Universe. Like Marvels, the comic features reporter Phil Sheldon as the main character and was published in prestige format, with fully painted artwork and acetate covers, further creating the impression that it is a more twisted companion piece. In the Marvel Multiverse, Earth of the Ruins universe is listed as Earth-9591. Plot summary =Issue One= Former Daily Bugle reporter Phil Sheldon explores a dystopian version of the Marvel Universe where in his own words \\"everything that can go wrong go wrong\\". In this world, the myriad experiments and accidents which led to the creation of superheroes on Earth-616 have instead here resulted in horrible deformities and painful deaths. Sheldon tours the country, investigating the aftereffects of these events and researching a book about the strange phenomena in order to prove that the world has taken a wrong turn somewhere. In this reality, the Avengers are a radical secessionist rebel group from California rebelling against an oppressive United States government led by 'President X'. Sheldon witnesses the destruction of the last Avengers Quinjet which has killed Captain America, Giant-Man, Wasp, and the Man in the Iron Mask. He encounters a decaying Wolverine, whose flesh is slowly falling off from the toxicity of his adamantium bone structure. Sheldon proceeds to a Kree internment camp in Nevada, situated on a nuclear test site, where the last survivors of a Kree invasion fleet are slowly dying of cancer. Sheldon interviews Captain Mar-Vell, one of the Kree prisoners, who tells him why their invasion failed. The Kree had encountered the Silver Surfer (who had gone mad and torn open his own chest in a futile attempt to experience respiration again) only to discover that the Power Cosmic emanating from the Surfer's body had been interfering with their scanners. This prevented the Kree fleet from detecting a nuclear barrage which subsequently destroyed 90 percent of the Kree warships. After his interview with Mar-Vell, Sheldon goes to Washington, D.C. where he meets government agent Nick Fury, who attacks and almost shoots him, insisting that he 'proved he was clean' and claiming that Captain America introduced him to cannibalism. They are interrupted by Jean Grey, a prostitute, who offers herself to the two men for $20. Fury shoots her dead and then kills himself. After his encounter with Fury, Sheldon visits Chicago, Illinois and interviews Rick Jones, a morphine addict living with fellow addict Marlo Chandler, who tells the story of when Bruce Banner saved him from a gamma radiation blast. The blast transformed Banner into a monstrous green mass of pulsating tumors. Leaving the apartment, Sheldon trips over the corpse of the Punisher in the snow. Sheldon begs on his knees to be allowed to show the world how this state of affairs came to pass. =Issue Two= Sheldon is traveling on a plane with Raven Darkholme, who has developed multiple personality disorder. She has neglected to take her prescribed pills, and this results in her shapeshifting uncontrollably, which leads to her death. When the plane lands, government agents take her body away while a protest against President X's government is underway. An agent bumps into Max Eisenhardt, damaging a magnetic dampening device that Magneto carries to nullify his powers, which causes all metal objects nearby to attach to him, killing him and several others. Later, Sheldon visits a special prison in Texas which houses many mutants, including Scott Summers, Katherine Pryde, Kurt Wagner and Pietro Maximoff, all of whom have been mutilated and deformed in efforts to control their powers while trying to escape. Sheldon is given a tour by the warden, Wilson Fisk, who says that the only reason Sheldon was allowed to see the prison was because President X knew Sheldon was dying and wanted to grant a dying man his wish. Sheldon visits a carnival where Johnny Blaze performs and commits suicide by setting his skull on fire. Sheldon interviews Ben Grimm, who describes the painful deaths of this world's counterparts of the Fantastic Four and Victor Von Doom when their spaceship flew through a cloud of radiation. Grimm had refused to pilot the ship due to safety concerns, so Reed Richards hired Von Doom instead and is the main point of divergence in Ruins for the would-be Marvels. Sheldon decides to begin writing his book, which he will title Marvels. However, he discovers that he has run out of the medication he has been taking; he has been infected with a virus passed on to him by Peter Parker (who had worked at the Daily Bugle alongside Sheldon), a virus caused by an irradiated spider that Parker himself experimented on that resulted in a highly infectious rash all over his body. The virus overcomes Sheldon, and he dies. As he lies on the ground, ignored by the passersby, his notes scatter in the wind. =Fates of other characters= Throughout the story, there are breaks within scenes that briefly describe the lives of other would-be Marvels; such as a version of Dr. Donald Blake, a cult leader who believes he can channel the entity Thor through his body after becoming addicted to fly-agaric mushrooms. (Thor's hammer is seen to be recovered at the site of the destroyed Quinjet at the start, hinting that the two are possibly different people.) Warren Worthington III serves President X in exchange for keeping his mutant nature a secret. Bucky Barnes, Jack Munroe, and Victor Creed are part of a fascist, cannibalistic militia from Oklahoma. Matt Murdock died as a child after a crashing truck caused radioactive material to strike him in the face. Doctor Strange, a founding member of the Avengers, is missing. Beaubier twins Jeanne-Marie and Jean-Paul are homeless and fused together by their elbows that Jeanne-Marie is unaware that her brother is dead. Amora is a porn star accused of killing her producer with ‚Äúmagic‚Äù. Emma Frost owns the Church of the Next Generation where she legally adopts the children of her followers and has them undergo surgery to unlock their \\"psychic abilities\\". Zelda DuBois is a circus performer who performs illegal acts with a python. Hawkeye is executed due to being a member of the Avengers. T'Challa is imprisoned due to his affiliation with the Black Panther Party. Scarlet Witch (a former member of the Avengers) being the one who betrays the Avengers for government protection after turning in state's evidence against the team. Galactus, who is thought to have been a god by the media, is found dead with his floating corpse being near Mars. Collected editions In 2009, the series was collected into a single volume.

Shipp, 203 U.S. 563 (1906), was a ruling of the Supreme Court of the United States with regard to a lynching in Chattanooga, Tennessee.. See also . As of 2020, it remains the only Supreme Court criminal trial in history. Background Ed Johnson, a black man, had been convicted in Hamilton County, Tennessee, of the rape of a white woman on February 11, 1906 and sentenced to death. On March 3, 1906, Johnson filed a writ of habeas corpus, alleging that his constitutional rights had been violated. Specifically, he alleged that all blacks had been systematically excluded from both the grand jury considering the original indictment against him and the trial jury considering his case. He further argued that he had been substantively denied the right to counsel, as his lawyer had been too intimidated by the threats of mob violence to file motions for a change of venue, a continuance, or a new trial, all of which could be reasonably expected under the circumstances. Johnson asserted he was thus about to be deprived of his life without due process. Johnson's petition was initially denied on March 10, 1906, and he was remanded to the custody of Hamilton County Sheriff Joseph F. Shipp, with the stipulation for Johnson to be given 10 days to file further appeals.Chattanooga Times Article on Shipp Case His appeal to the Supreme Court was granted by Justice Harlan on March 17 and subsequently by the entire court on March 19. However, despite being advised of the ruling by telegram on that date and the case and the ruling being given full coverage by Chattanooga's evening newspapers that day, the case purported that Shipp and his chief jailer nonetheless allowed a mob to enter the Hamilton County Jail and to lynch Johnson on the city's Walnut Street Bridge. The court felt that the action constituted contempt of court in that Sheriff Shipp, with full knowledge of the court's ruling, chose to ignore his duties to protect a prisoner in his care. Shipp's actions resulted in his prosecution by the US Department of Justice. Included as defendants were his chief jailer and the members of the lynch mob who could be reasonably identified. When the case came to the Supreme Court, the government was represented by both Solicitor General Henry M. Hoyt and Attorney General William H. Moody. Shipp's attorneys argued that the Supreme Court was not competent to hear the case, as it was now a party to the case in that it was involved in the action as a plaintiff rather than as a court. Holding In a decision written by Justice Holmes, the court held that it was not a party in any sense that would create a conflict of interest, as members of the court were not affected by Shipp's actions in any way in their persons (Shipp's actions were not a threat to the justices personally but to their ruling and the authority of the court) and so they were not \\"interested parties\\" in any sense that would affect their competence with regard to the case. The prosecution of Shipp was allowed to proceed. Justice Peckham, joined by Justices White and McKenna, dissented on the grounds that the only evidence for Shipp's criminal actions were the analysis from his testimony, which was circumstantial at best. Peckham argued that \\"To be free from any contempt of this Court, it was not necessary that the sheriff should have stood by the prisoner at the peril of his own life, or that he should have sacrificed it in an unsuccessful attempt against overwhelming odds to prevent the mob from taking the prisoner out of his custody.\\" Impact The case took on special significance as the only criminal trial of the Supreme Court in its entire history. The main impact of the case was its reiteration of the principle that the Supreme Court could always intervene in state capital cases if there was a question of violation of the constitutional right to due process. Sheriff Shipp and several other men were convicted of contempt of court. Shipp and two others were sentenced to 90 days imprisonment, and three other defendants were sentenced to 60 days imprisonment. In the court's words, \\"Shipp not only made the work of the mob easy, but in effect aided and abbetted it.\\" However, when Shipp was released he still swore innocence and was welcomed back like a hero. Threatened with violence, Johnson's two African-American lawyers had to leave the state, never to return.  Commemoration  Ninety-four years after the lynching, in February 2000, Hamilton County Criminal Judge Doug Meyer overturned Johnson's conviction after hearing arguments that Johnson did not receive a fair trial because of the all-white jury and the judge's refusal to move the trial from Chattanooga, where there was much publicity about the case. On April 15, 2016, the Tennessee General Assembly passed a resolution, commending the valor of Johnson's legal defense and the federal intervention by President Theodore Roosevelt, the Justice Department and the Supreme Court and deploring the actions of Shipp and the lynch mob which he abetted in the \\"untimely lynching of Mr. Ed Johnson.\\" See also *Edward Terry Sanford, lead prosecutor in the case, who became a Supreme Court Justice. *List of United States Supreme Court cases, volume 203 Notes = References = * * Further reading * * External links  * Category:United States Supreme Court cases Category:United States Supreme Court cases of the Fuller Court Category:United States due process case law Category:1906 in United States case law Category:Lynching deaths in Tennessee ","title":"United States v.

The rails are embedded in the roadway, and the train shares the street with pedestrians and automobile traffic. Street running trains generally travel at reduced speed for safety reasons. Stations can appear similar in style to a tram stop, but often lack platforms, pedestrian islands, or other amenities. Passengers may be required to wait on a distant sidewalk, and then board or disembark directly among mixed traffic in mid-pavement, rather than at curbside. Rails can be embedded in the surface of bridges and tunnels as on Inuyama Bridge (Japan) or Anton Anderson Memorial Tunnel (US). Examples This list does not include conventional tram, interurban, light rail or the tram portions of tram-train systems, which usually run in the street. =Argentina= * Over the Salto Grande Dam, between Concordia, Argentina and Salto, Uruguay. * Bridge between Viedma, R√≠o Negro and Carmen de Patagones, Buenos Aires. = Australia = A passenger train running down the centre of Ellen Street, Port Pirie (1940) * The Adelaide-Port Augusta railway line ran down the centre of Ellen Street, Port Pirie until 1967. * The North Coast main line runs down Denison Street in Rockhampton, Queensland carrying freight and passenger services. * Mossman, Queensland. A sugar-cane railway runs down Mill Street. =Austria= WLB freight train in Guntramsdorf * Wiener Lokalbahn ‚Äì tram-train running on tram tracks in Vienna and Baden and as light rail between the two towns. A section of the light rail tracks in Guntramsdorf runs directly on the Feldgasse narrow street, but without any stops on it. =Brazil= * Uruguaiana, almost 300 m in the Vasco Alves street to reach the Paso de los Libres‚ÄìUruguaiana International Bridge. =Cambodia= The Toll Royal Railways airport train runs along the main street in Phnom Penh in Cambodia. =Canada= Notable examples in Canada include:Trains Magazine, Vol. 68, Issue 4 (April 2008) (pages 22-31) ; Brantford, Ontario: : Clarence Street (From Nelson Street to Icomm Drive, formerly Canadian National Railway;now Southern Ontario Railway, still in use) ; Guelph, Ontario : Kent Street (from Glasgow Street to Gordon Street), CNR, still in use : ;St. Catharines, Ontario: : Louisa Street (From just east of Thomas Street to Catherine Street, Canadian National Railway, removed, continues to Welland Avenue below) : Welland Avenue (From Francis Street to Balfour Street, removed) ;Waterloo, Ontario: : Caroline Street (from Erb Street West to Allen Street West, tracks removed in 1994) =Croatia= In Rijeka, freight trains (and occasional passenger trains) run from western to eastern cargo terminal of Port of Rijeka through the city centre. =Germany= For tramways the legal separation of a street running trackbed and an exclusive trackbed in urban traffic is given in ¬ß 16 BOStrab tramway regulations. Germany has some street-running railways: A \\"Mollibahn\\" train running through Bad Doberan, Germany *In the northeast of Germany, the steam \\"Mollibahn\\" narrow gauge railway travels on-street through the town of Bad Doberan at the start of its journey. *Near Mannheim, the Oberrheinische Eisenbahn and Rhein-Haardt-Bahn are street running through several villages. *In Linkenheim, near Karlsruhe, the Hardt Railway was changed to BOStrab (tramway) in 2011 for that reason. *Road and rail share the Lindaunis Bridge in Schleswig-Holstein. *Freight trains using the infrastructure of Rhein-Sieg- Verkehrsgesellschaft to the company Evonik in Niederkassel-L√ºlsdorf passing the village Sieglar (next to Troisdorf) are running inside the Pastor-B√∂hm- Stra√üe. =Hungary= *A section of service track of the H8/H9 BH√âV lines on Kerepesi Road in Budapest was rebuilt as street running in order to allow metro replacement buses to use the path to avoid traffic jams. The railway is only used by maintenance trains, mainly at night. Buses also only operate occasionally. *The only operational road-railway bridge in Hungary where street running happens is at Kisk√∂re on the Tisza. Here, the non-electrified single-track railway carrying the branch line 102 of M√ÅV runs on the same path as local car traffic. The bridge is closed for road vehicles when trains pass. =India= A Darjeeling Himalayan Railway running through the street in Darjeeling The steam-powered Darjeeling Himalayan Railway runs along the main street in Darjeeling in West Bengal in India. =Indonesia= Indonesia used to have an extensive \\"steam tramways\\" (more accurately defined as local railways) network, which had many street running sections in various towns and cities in Java and Sumatra. Two sections remain in use in 2010: part of the Wonogiri branch runs along the Slamet Riyadi street in Surakarta, and a short branch to an oil depot in Madiun. The earlier line sees both passenger and freight service (including a steam-hauled tourist train), while the other line is exclusively for freight. =Ireland= Freight trains to and from the docks at Dublin share the Alexandra road with cars. In Cork, there have been street railways and tramways in the central area of the city, and the Cork and Muskerry Light Railway also had street lines running through the western suburbs, later shared with trams. = Italy = The Bernina Railway runs in the streets of Tirano.

The Rome‚ÄìFiuggi railway (now practically a tramway) runs completely along the Via Casilina in Rome. =Japan= Japanese law distinguishes between tramways and railways, but light rail does not exist as a separate category. For instance, the Toyama Light Rail line - with extensive street trackage - is legally a railway but uses low-floor light rail vehicles. Only operations with 'heavy rail' vehicles are listed here. Examples under the jurisdiction of Japan's Railway Law include: * Enoshima Electric Railway has a street running section between Koshigoe and Enoshima stations . * Inuyama Bridge (The bridge on the Meitetsu Inuyama Line runs across the Kiso River. Since 2000 the bridge has been used exclusively by trains, with a new parallel bridge for road traffic.) * Kumamoto Electric Railway (A short section on the Fujisaki Line.) Examples classified legally as tramways - but using heavy rail vehicles and often inter-operating with full-size railways - are listed below. * Keihan Keishin Line ( A section between Hama≈çtsu Station and Kamisakaemachi Station. Around of street trackage in Kyoto were replaced by through services on the Kyoto Subway T≈çzai Line in 1997.) * Keihan Ishiyama Sakamoto Line ( A section between Hama≈çtsu Station and Karahashimae Station. * Keifuku Electric Railroad (Like the above Keihan lines, Keifuku uses high-profile railway-style vehicles and only includes short sections of street trackage; however the entire network is classified as a tramway.) * Fukui Railway (Operated as a single line, formerly with heavy rail stock, but street running section is legally a tramway.) * Nagoya Railroad's 600V network in Gifu (Abandoned in 2005, this network of street tramways inter-operated with interurban lines - such as the Minomachi, Tagami, Ibi and Tanigumi lines - that were classified as railways and used large, high-floor vehicles. The Minomachi and Tagami lines included short sections of street trackage classified as tramways.) * Niigata Kotsu Railway Line (This interurban line, abandoned in 1999, included a short street running section - legally a tramway - near its Niigata terminus.) =Laos= The rail link across the Thai‚ÄìLao Friendship Bridge over the Mekong River between Thailand and Laos is shared-use, although road traffic stops while trains cross the bridge. =New Zealand= Kawakawa The Bay of Islands Vintage Railway, part of the former Opua Branch of the New Zealand Railways, runs down the middle of the state highway in the centre of Kawakawa. The Taieri Gorge Railway, part of the former Otago Central Railway runs down the middle of a one lane road bridge in Hindon. These tourist passenger trains have the right of way, with only signs warning motorists of trains. =Peru= In Aguas Calientes, the town at the foot of Machu Picchu, the railway shares the streets with pedestrians, as well as in other towns further up the line. This railway serves as the only way of reaching Machu Picchu from Cusco without walking. = Portugal = Av. Em√≠dio Navarro with Ramal da Lous√£ track, in Coimbra, Portugal (2007) In Coimbra, an 800 m single-track segment of Ramal da Lous√£ runs along Em√≠dio Navarro, immediately southeast of the Coimbra-City station; closed ‚Äúprovisionally‚Äù in 2004, track scheduled to be lifted upon total closure of the spur line from Coimbra-B. In Lisbon a series of short single track segments along Avenue Bras√≠lia / Avenue √çndia in riverside southwest Lisbon, links Linha de Cintura with Linha de Cascais and with cargo tracks associated with the harbour. It carries freight traffic only, mostly at night. =Serbia= In 1999, ≈Ωe≈æelj Bridge, a railway and road bridge in Novi Sad (with separated traffic) was destroyed during NATO bombing of Yugoslavia. As a temporary replacement, a street running Road-Railway Bridge was constructed in 2000. It remained actively used up to 2018, when the new ≈Ωe≈æelj Bridge opened, and the dismantling of the temporary bridge began in October that year. =Switzerland= A Berninabahn train crossing the main square in Tirano Swiss law does not distinguish between trams and railways, making the distinction between street running by trams and that by railways legally indistinct. The Berninabahn has three sections of street running, in Le Prese, Miralago and in Tirano (in Italy), where the approach to the station involves street running and crossing a public square. Rhaetian Railway has a section of street running in Chur. In Z√ºrich, 1,000-tonne grain trains make up to 4 journeys a day between Bahnhof Hardbr√ºcke and the Swissmill Tower on Sihlquai, following a 2-kilometre route along Zahnradstrasse, Hardstrasse and Z√∂llystrasse, including a tram crossing. The driver controls traffic lights manually.https://www.nzz.ch/zuerich/und-taeglich-gruesst-der- gueterzug-1.18637961 =Taiwan= The Pinghsi Line runs along the streets near several of its stations, e.g., Shihfen Station and Pinghsi Station. =Thailand= Maeklong Railway Market, Bangkok =United Kingdom= The combined road and rail swing bridge at Preston Marina The most notable track where street running was common was the Weymouth Harbour Tramway; however this ended service to regular traffic since 1987, and to all traffic since 1999. The Porthmadog cross town link links the narrow-gauge Welsh Highland and Ffestiniog railways and includes a short length of street running on the outskirts of Porthmadog. A freight-only street-running railway network was through Trafford Park; only one section along Barton Dock Road has seen use in recent years. This branch is abandoned and removed.Google maps The heritage Ribble Steam Railway runs across a swing bridge at the entrance to Preston Marina. The route is shared between road and rail traffic. =United States= Entries marked with a ‚àÜ denote instances where a railroad is laid alongside a road or in the median of a divided roadway rather than embedded in the road surface.

Patton and Jak Kendall play brothers David and Jimmy, who live in a small Kansas town in the 1950s and have an abusive relationship. Both brothers become involved with Sandra (Black), a singer with the traveling carnival that visits the town each summer. Sandra is also trapped in an abusive relationship with the carnival owner Frank (also played by Patton). When the carnival leaves town, David also disappears, leading to an investigation of his apparent murder. Plot The body of a murder victim is being exhumed from under a storage shed in 1950s small-town Wamego, Kansas. The story leading up to the murder is told. Handsome, sociopathic, David, the owner of a local garage, bullies his meek, sensitive piano-playing younger brother, the teenage Jimmy. Their religious, mentally unbalanced mother, Eleanor, attempts to ignore David's behavior; their withdrawn and ill father is about to be placed in a nursing home. When Jimmy shyly announces at the family dinner table that his piano teacher plans to include him in an upcoming recital, David belittles and beats him, ordering him to give up his \\"sissy\\" piano and work at the garage, earn money and be a real man. Jimmy finds temporary escape from his family dysfunction by visiting a traveling carnival that stops in Wamego each summer. He forms a platonic friendship with the premiere sideshow attraction, Sandra, an aging but still glamorous lounge singer. Sandra is virtually a captive of the sadistic carnival owner, Frank, who abuses her emotionally and physically. While Jimmy dreams of running away to play piano for the carnival, Sandra has the opposite dream ‚Äî to escape the carnival and live a normal life. Sandra had a past relationship with David, but when he approaches her again, she makes it clear that she is no longer interested in him and tells him that she won't let him \\"hurt her\\" again. David goes home and takes out his frustrations on Jimmy, in a scene where sexual abuse is strongly implied but not shown. It is later revealed that David got Sandra pregnant the previous summer, and when the pathologically jealous Frank found out, he cruelly terminated her pregnancy and mutilated her genitals to make her unattractive to other men. Unwilling to take no for an answer, David confronts Sandra at her trailer, and discovers Jimmy hiding there. David flies into a rage, rapes Jimmy in front of Sandra, and storms out. Sandra consoles Jimmy, who goes home. The next day, the carnival leaves town, its departure coinciding with David's disappearance, which the female police chief, Edith \\"Ed\\" Carlisle, begins to investigate. It begins to appear that a murder, presumably of David, took place at his family's home. Meanwhile, the carnival is losing money and Frank's treatment of Sandra is becoming worse, including sending his gang of brutal henchmen to menace her sexually. She resolves to leave and the other carnival freaks bid her goodbye. Jimmy arrives planning to join the carnival, but Sandra, knowing that the carnival is also a dysfunctional environment and not the escape of which Jimmy dreams, sends him home. Frank refuses to let Sandra go and instead chains her up. When Frank comes to see her in her chains, the other freaks help Sandra overpower him, and she strangles him to death with her chains. The freaks hide Sandra from Frank's vengeful henchmen and give her money and a bus ticket to help her escape, but the henchmen capture her in a field and brutally kill her. Back in Wamego, flashbacks show how David came home to find Eleanor comforting the traumatized Jimmy in a locked room. David broke down the door, dragged Jimmy downstairs and started abusing him. Eleanor, praying, took a pair of scissors from a drawer and stabbed David to death. Jimmy and Eleanor then buried the body under the shed. Pearl, a local psychic girl, realizes the location of David's body and digs up his corpse, revealing a hand to Chief Ed. Eleanor, now clearly mentally ill, is taken away by attendants to a mental institution, while Jimmy cries. In an attempt to save his mother, Jimmy tearfully confesses to David's murder. Jimmy was sentenced to life in prison and later released on parole, at which time Chief Ed, who had become a district judge, sealed the case so no record of it exists today. Production Writer, director and co-producer Steve Balderson based Firecracker on a real-life murder that occurred in Wamego in the 1950s, three blocks from the house where Balderson grew up. According to Balderson, a traveling carnival visited the town each year on July 4. The murder victim disappeared on the morning of July 5, as the carnival was leaving town, and was later found to have been killed by his brother. Balderson changed the names and some details of the story for his film. He called the finished film \\"more fiction than fact\\" and not a historical piece. Dennis Hopper was originally cast as Frank but dropped out before the film was made. Balderson said this was because Hopper's involvement in the film did not result in financing, so he reverted to his \\"original vision\\" of having the same actor play the parts of both Frank and David, and Hopper was \\"forty years too old\\" to play David. The film was shot in Wamego and the surrounding area over two months in 2003, on a budget of just under $500,000. The Ottaway carnival, a real carnival that visited Wamego regularly, was used for the carnival scenes, with local residents as extras. Critical reaction Finished in 2005 and released in the first-ever \\"Freak Show Tour\\" exclusively in Landmark Theatres, and was released on DVD in 2006. Film critic Roger Ebert called it \\"Brilliant\\" and gave Firecracker a Special Jury Award on his list of the year's best films. Hailed as a ‚Äúmasterpiece‚ÄùFirecracker that is ‚Äútold by a story teller who has a nascent finger on the pulse of contemporary cinema‚Äú (Aftertaste magazine), Firecracker premiered at London‚Äôs Raindance Film Festival, to sold out crowds, where it won a Jury Prize nomination for Best Picture. It also won numerous awards on the festival circuit worldwide including: Best Picture, Best Cinematography, Best Actress for Karen Black, and director Steve Balderson won the 2005 Domani Vision Award for emerging talent at Tribeca‚Äôs Visionfest.

Early life and career  Ingrid Chauvin was born on 3 October 1973 in Argenteuil in the department of Val-d'Oise, to a lifeguard father and a watercolor painter and documentalist mother. Despite her parents' opposition, Ingrid sought to become an actress since she was a child. Her parents then divorced when she was eight.

A by- product of aqueous alcohol soy protein concentrate production, soy molasses is a concentrated, desolventized, aqueous alcohol extract of defatted soybean flakes. The term \\"soy molasses\\" was coined by Daniel Chajuss, the founder of Hayes Ashdod Ltd., which first commercially produced and marketed soy molasses in the early 1960s. The name was intended to distinguish the product from ‚Äúsoybean whey‚Äù or ‚Äúcondensed soybean solubles‚Äù, the by-products available at the time from soy protein isolate and acid washed soy protein concentrate production. Manufacture The alcohols are removed from the liquid extract by evaporation and the distillation residue is an aqueous solution of the sugars and other soy solubles. This solution is concentrated to viscous honey- like consistency to yield soy molasses. Composition Typically, soy molasses contains 50% total soluble solids. These solids consist of carbohydrates (60%), proteins and other nitrogenous substances (10%), minerals (10%), fats and lipoids (20%). The major constituents of soy molasses are sugars that include oligosaccharides (stachyose and raffinose), disaccharides (sucrose) and minor amounts of monosaccharides (fructose and glucose). Minor constituents include saponins, protein, lipid, minerals (ash), isoflavones, and other organic materials. Use Soy molasses is used as a feed ingredient in mixed feeds as pelleting aid, added to soybean meal (e.g. by spraying it into the soybean meal desolventizer toaster), mixed with soy hulls, and used in liquid animal feed diets. Soy molasses can be used as a fermentation aid, as a prebiotic, and as an ingredient in specialized breads. It is also possible to burn soy molasses in a dedicated boiler to generate process steam. In combination with a support fuel (e.g. natural gas, ...) the low calorific liquid can be valorized in a steam boiler. Soy molasses is an important commercial and biological product, and a source of phytochemicals and soy sugars.

The abbey is located within the grounds of the Kilcooley Estate. This abbey dates from 1182 when Donal Mor O‚ÄôBrien granted lands to the Cistercians, to build an abbey here. The abbey which is a sister house to both Jerpoint Abbey and Holy Cross Abbey, is considered to be a hidden gem, tucked away in this remote corner of Co. Tipperary. The Abbey is found inside a private walled estate. After the Reformation, Kilcooley passed into the possession of the Earl of Ormond. It was granted to the English-born judge Sir Jerome Alexander in the 1630s. It passed to his daughter Elizabeth, and then through marriage to the Barker baronets of Bocking Hall, the last of whom died in 1818. Structure  The tower with the flamboyant east window below it The main part of the abbey consists of the Entrance Chamber, the Church, the Tower and the Sacristy. The Entrance Chamber has a well carved baptismal font on its south wall. The nave of the church is still roofed, but the rest of it is out in the open. The church has two large carved windows on its east and west side. The chancel contains two stone tombs and a stone altar. One of these tombs is that of the knight Piers Fitz Oge Butler. His tomb records his death as taking place in 1526 and has some carvings of 10 apostles on the side of it carved by Rory O Tunney, who is also noted for his work in Jerpoint Abbey. On top of the Butler tomb there is the effigy of a knight with a dog curled up at his feet. The Sacristy is entered through a carved archway that has many carvings, such as a scene depicting the crucifixion and a mermaid holding a mirror, which was meant to depict vanity. Roger Stalley suspects this screen wall may represent the entrance to a private Butler chapel, as two Butler shields are depicted. The east end of the nave is notable, because seats for the officiating clergy have been carved into the crossing piers. The work here is very fine, but does not have the sculptural finesse of nearby Holycross Abbey. Outside the abbey there is also a beehive shaped ruin. It is not known whether this was used as a Columbarium to store ashes or a dove-cote for pigeons. But most probably it was a dove- cote since there is a wide hole in the ceiling from which they would have entered and left. Also outside the abbey is the Infirmary which is still in a fairly good condition although access to the roof of it is blocked. The Cloisters of the abbey are long gone with only one column still remaining. The path of the cloisters though still remains with a pebbled walkway around the grass square. The centre even has a large tree growing in it. Beside the Cloisters the Parlour and Chapter House are still there. Also the Calefactory (Warming room) still remains but without a roof. And on the south side of the Cloisters the Monks Dining Hall still stands. Although the dining hall has no roof, it still has a spiral staircase, but this has been barred up. One can also find all the second floor rooms -- such as the Monks Dorms and the Main Tower -- locked up by the Office of Public Works. The Parlour, Chapter House, and Calefactory are also barred. Kilcooly Abbey was also used in the making of the film \\"Excalibur\\" by John Boorman, which is based on the tale of King Arthur and the knights of the round table. There is a pyramid structure on the grounds of the abbey.

He was a right-handed batsman and right arm fast bowler who played 18 times for Worcestershire (and twice for Oxford University) in the early 1920s. Born in Southwold, Suffolk, Greig made his first-class debut for Worcestershire against Hampshire in May 1920, going wicketless in the first innings but taking 4-119 in the second; his maiden first-class wicket was that of Hampshire opener Alex Bowell. He also hit 37 in the first innings, which was to remain his highest score. After another game for the county a few days later, he played his two matches for Oxford, though met with little success in either of them. In Worcestershire's final game of the 1920 County Championship, Greig enjoyed his best performance with the ball, claiming 7-86 in Lancashire's first innings, five of the dismissed batsmen being out bowled. His feat was in vain, however, as Lancashire triumphed by nine wickets to leave the county languishing in 16th place in the final Championship table. Grieg played five matches in 1921, taking nine wickets at 40 apiece, but after that his first-class career was almost at an end, and he was to play only two more games, these coming almost four years later. Against Warwickshire he bowled only five overs, but took what was to prove his last wicket, that of Willie Quaife; in his very last match, against Gloucestershire, he bowled not a ball. He became a clergyman and was from 1955 to 1960 the vicar of Walton- on-Thames, Surrey. He died at the age of 63 in Ewhurst, Surrey.

The show was originally aired between 1987 and 1988 on DD National. It was created, written, and directed by Ramanand Sagar. The show is primarily based on Valmiki's Ramayan and Tulsidas' Ramcharitmanas. The series had a viewership of 82 per cent, a record high for any Indian television series. Each episode of the series reportedly earned DD National 40 lakh. The series was reaired during the 2020 Coronavirus lockdown and broke several viewership records globally which includes setting the record for one of the most watched TV show ever in the world, with 77 million viewers on 16 April 2020. Plot Adapted and based on the ancient Hindu epic Ramayana, the series follows the journey of Rama who goes to an exile of 14 years along with Sita and Lakshman.

S. Gill wrote that it was during his tenure as the secretary with the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting in September 1985 that he contacted Ramanand Sagar in association with the project. Gill added that in a letter to Sagar, he had written about the Ramayana as a subject for the television series was ideal in that it was \\"a repository of moral and social values\\" and that its message was \\"secular and universal\\". He added that he had noted in the letter that Sagar's \\"real challenge would lie in seeing the epic \\"with the eyes of a modern man and relating its message to the spiritual and emotional needs of our age\\". Gill added that he also wrote a similar letter to B. R. Chopra over the production of the series Mahabharat based on another epic of the same name, and mentioned that both he and Sagar accepted to his suggestions and constituted panels of experts and scholars to conceptualize the production. The series was initially conceptualized to run for 52 episodes of 45 minutes each. But, owing to popular demand it had to be extended thrice, eventually ending after 78 episodes. Initially, Both Ramayan and Mahabharat was planned to air together, but later it was decided to air Ramayan first which was followed by Mahabharat after its end. =Casting= Govil expressed his desire to play Rama and appeared for a screen test. Initially he was considered to be inappropriate for the role. He then appeared for the screen test again wearing a smile on his face and got finalized for the role. Since Govil's collaboration with Debashree Roy in Kanak Mishra's Jiyo To Aise Jiyo (1981) was adulated, the actress was approached to play Sita but due to her hectic schedule in Bengali cinema, she failed to appear for the screen test. Several other famous actresses were approached as well but all of them backed off due to the prevalent premonition that playing the role of Lady Sita would blemish their romantic appeal resulting doom to their on screen career. Deepika Chikhalia was then summoned to appear for the screen test. She had to undergo a rigorous screen tests and was finalized then. Sanjay Jog was originally approached for the role of Lakshmana but he refused since he was unable to give bulk dates. Sagar then urged him to play Bharata since the role would not require a bulk dates. The role of Lakshmana then went to Sunil Lahiri. Arvind Trivedi went to audition for the role of a boatman where Ramanand Sagar chose him as Ravan. However, when Trivedi rejected the offer, Paresh Rawal convinced him for playing the role. Vijay Kavish played three roles in the series which were Shiva, Valmiki and Mayasura.  Reception  D. K. Bose, the media director of Hindustan Thompson Associates, remarked, \\"The unique thing about the Ramayana was its consistency. Other programmes like Buniyaad and even Hum Log did achieve viewership of around 80 per cent and more, on occasion. In the case of Ramayana that figure had been maintained almost from the beginning.\\" He added, \\"Starting at around 50 per cent the 80 per cent figure was reached within a few months and never went down.\\" He noted that the viewership was more than 50 per cent even in the predominantly non- Hindi speaking southern Indian States of Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Karnataka. He also added that the show's popularity spanned across religions and was watched by people of the Islam faith in high numbers as well. He mentioned that it was common among people threatening to burn down the local electricity board headquarters during a power outage. The success of the series was documented well by the media. Soutik Biswas of BBC recalled that when the series was telecast every Sunday morning, \\"streets would be deserted, shops would be closed and people would bathe and garland their TV sets before the serial began.\\" Writing for the Telegraph, William Dalrymple noted, \\"In villages across south Asia, hundreds of people would gather around a single set to watch the gods and demons play out their destinies. In the noisiest and most bustling cities, trains, buses and cars came to a sudden halt, and a strange hush fell over the bazaars. In Delhi, government meetings had to be rescheduled after the entire cabinet failed to turn up for an urgent briefing.\\" =Impact= The telecast of Ramayan was seen as a precursor to the Ayodhya dispute. Arvind Rajagopal in his book Politics After Television: Hindu Nationalism and the Reshaping of the Public in India (2000) wrote that with the series, the government \\"violated a decades-old taboo on religious partisanship, and Hindu nationalists made the most of the opportunity.\\" He added that it \\"confirm[ed] to the idea of Hindu awakening\\" and the rise of the Bharatiya Janata Party capitalizing on this. Manik Sharma of Hindustan Times voiced similar views in that the series \\"played in the backdrop of a Hindutva shift in Indian politics, under the aegis of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and its political outfit, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). While the media and cultural commentators struggled to consider Sagar's epic one way or the other, there were some who saw it as a catalyst, even if unintended, to the turmoil that the movement resulted in.\\" Regarding initial apprehensions about the series being aired by a government-owned broadcaster, its hitherto producer Sharad Dutt said that \\"a lot of people within the channel's office weren't supportive of the idea to begin with. But it had no motivation with what was going on politically. The Congress was in power and it had no agenda of the sort.\\" He however felt the execution was poor and remembered questioning Sagar upon watching \\"the tape\\" if he had \\"made Ramayana or Ram- Leela\\". Sharma noted that the political clout the series held could be adjudged by the fact that Sagar and Arun Govil (who played Rama) \\"were repeatedly courted by both the Congress and the BJP to campaign for them\\", and that Deepika Chikhalia (Sita) and Arvind Trivedi (Ravana) went on to become members of parliament. The series was re-telecast from 28 March 2020 with one hour episode during the morning and one hour episode during the night during the lockdown of 21 days due to coronavirus on DD National. =Ratings= Ramayan notably broke viewership for any Indian television series during that time. It was telecast in 55 countries and at a total viewership of 650 million and re-telecast (March 24 - April 18, 2020) nearly 2500 million viewership alone in 25 days, it became the highest watched Indian television series by a distance, and one of top watched television series in world.

Ramayan garnered a total of 170 million viewers in first 4 shows during which DD National became the most watched Indian television channel after many years.

Its manufacturer designation was Mercedes-Benz L4500R. Development The Sd.Kfz. 4 was developed after the 1941 invasion of the USSR to deal with the ice and mud, which bogged down the wheels-only road- bound commercial vehicles that were used to supply German forces. It was modified Standard Mercedes-Benz L4500S (4x2) with Horstmann suspension instead of a back axle. Another manufacturer of 4.5-t truck, B√ºssing, planned a similar conversion of its B√ºssing-NAG L4500S, but did not proceed. A total of 22,500 Maultier halftracks were produced by 1944, among which 1480 were 4.5-t. Sd.Kfz. 4, others 2-t. Sd.Kfz. 3. In 1943 Opel was ordered to build armored vehicles outfitted with 15 cm Panzerwerfer 42 rocket launchers. These vehicles were designated Sd.Kfz. 4/1, with around 300 produced. Given the extra weight of the Panzerwerfer, the top speed was only 24 mph (40 km/h). Another multiple rocket launching system, the 8 cm Raketen-Vielfachwerfer, was also fitted to the Sd.Kfz. 4 chassis. The vast majority of Maultiers operated using British- pattern Carden-Loyd running gear, with the exception of the Type L4500R, which used PzKpfw. II running gear. The 6-cylinder engines were mated to a transmission with 5 forward / 1 reverse gears and could attain a maximum forward speed of 40 km/h. Each halftrack was equipped with the FuG Spr G f radio. Aside from the Sd.Kfz. 4/1, the Sd.Kfz. 4 was armed only with a light 7.92 mm MG 34 or MG 42 machine gun with a traverse of 270¬∞ and elevation limits of -12¬∞ to +80¬∞.

Founded as the city of Concepci√≥n del Nuevo Extremo ('beginning of the new extreme') on February 12, 1550 by Pedro de Valdivia, it is the third oldest city in Chile, after capital Santiago founded first in 1541 and La Serena second in 1544. As there may be confusion between the demonyms of the inhabitants of Concepci√≥n and Penco. Due to the previous location of Concepci√≥n, inhabitants of that city are called penquistas while inhabitants of Penco are known as pencones.  History  In previous centuries, in the current location of Penco, was the first location where the city of Concepci√≥n was established, which is now the capital of the B√≠ob√≠o Region. It was destroyed by Lautaro in 1554, and rebuilt and destroyed again by Lautaro in 1555. * It was reestablished in 1557 during the governorship of marquess Garc√≠a Hurtado de Mendoza when he landed there and built a fort on the Alto de Pinto. The city was reestablished January 6, 1558, by capit√°n Jer√≥nimo de Villegas. * It became the headquarters of the military forces engaged against the native Mapuche in Araucan√≠a over the next two centuries, growing to a population of 10,000 despite suffering a siege in 1564 and other attacks by Mapuche tribals. * In 1603 the last bishop of the suppressed Diocese of La Imperial was transferred there as first bishop of the successor see Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Concepci√≥n. * Due to earthquakes and tsunamis, which razed the city in 1570, 1657, 1687, 1730 and another on May 25, 1751, the colonial authorities ultimately decided to move the city to its current location to the Valle de la Mocha, alongside the B√≠o B√≠o River and prohibited the occupation of the old location, which remained unpopulated until March 29, 1842, when the present city of Penco was founded.  Statistics  According to the 2002 census of the National Statistics Institute, Penco spans an area of and has 46,016 inhabitants (22,366 men and 23,650 women). Of these, 45,361 (98.6%) lived in urban areas and 655 (1.4%) in rural areas. The population grew by 14% (5,657 persons) between the 1992 and 2002 censuses.  Administration  As a commune, Penco is a third-level administrative division of Chile administered by a municipal council, headed by an alcalde who is directly elected every four years. The 2012-2016 alcalde is V√≠ctor Hugo Figueroa (ILE). Within the electoral divisions of Chile, Penco is represented in the Chamber of Deputies by Sergio Bobadilla (UDI) and Clemira Pacheco (PS) as part of the 45th electoral district, (together with Tom√©, Florida, Hualqui, Coronel and Santa Juana). The commune is represented in the Senate by Alejandro Navarro Brain (MAS) and Hosain Sabag Castillo (PDC) as part of the 12th senatorial constituency (Biob√≠o-Cordillera). =Places= In addition to the main town of Penco, the commune administers the following villages: * Cerro Verde, * Cosmito, * El Rosal, * Lirqu√©n, * Tucapel, .

The film stars Sean Faris, Gary Cole, Neal McDonough, Sean Astin, Penn Badgley and Arielle Kebbel. The film is about a troubled rugby union player who must play against the team his father coaches at the national championships. Forever Strong is based on a compilation of individual true stories. Plot Rick Penning (Sean Faris) is captain of his high school rugby team whose coach Richard Penning (Neal McDonough) is his father, and whose players indulge in drugs and alcohol. After losing the championship to their rivals the Highland Rugby Team, Rick drinks and drives, resulting in a crash that seriously injures his girlfriend. He is sentenced to a boys' Juvenile Detention Center in Salt Lake City. The manager of the center, Marcus (Sean Astin) puts him on the Highland rugby team much to his chagrin, coached by Larry Gelwix (Gary Cole). He struggles to adapt to this new team's ways. A friend sends him a rugby ball with drugs hidden in the stitching. He uses the drugs until, influenced by something one of his new teammates tells him, he throws the drugs away. He works hard and finds the strength to become a member of the widely admired Highland team. Each day when he arrives at team practice he criticizes the coach for sitting around chatting with different team members and not doing any real coaching. Then it is his turn to sit with the coach and finds himself confessing to the drugs hidden in the rugby ball. The coach deals with it and tells him that his teammates want him to be a coach. He is influenced by brotherhood and can cope with his homesickness. Driving home after a celebration meal, the team are helping a mother and two children with a flat tire when a passing car clips one of the boys. Rick now must deal with the death of his first true friend Kurt (Michael J. Pagan). Rick is released and returns to live with his parents. His father wants him to tell about the Highland team's moves and plays but Rick resists and they argue. His father makes it up by lending Rick the keys to his sports car, and Rick drives to meet up with Tammy (Tyler Kain) and his old friends. They too become angry that Rick won't reveal the Highland team's secrets and a fight breaks out. They plant drugs and alcohol in the sports car and Rick is arrested when the police show up. Tammy tells the police what really happened and Rick is released. Rick finds himself again in the national championship, this time against the former friends on his old team coached by his estranged father. The game is hard fought. Players from his old team try to hurt Rick through cheap shots to collect the bounty on his head. Coach Penning tells Rick if he stays down Rick will end up like him. Rick gets back up and, in the final seconds, scores the winning try for Highland. As the film ends it is shown that in real life, under Coach Gelwix, Highland has been winning almost every year. Cast * Gary Cole as Coach Larry Gelwix * Sean Astin as Marcus Tate * Neal McDonough as Coach Richard Penning * Sean Faris as Richard 'Rick' Seymour Penning, Jr. * Penn Badgley as Lars * Michael J. Pagan as Kurt Addison * Nathan West as Quentin 'Q' Owens * Max Kasch as Griggs * Julie Warner as Natalie Penning * Arielle Kebbel as Emily Owens * Tyler Kain as Tammy * Larry Bagby as Coach Cal * Ryan Roundy as Himself Production The movie was filmed in Salt Lake City beginning in July 2006 at three local high schools. Sean Faris ran six miles twice a day to get in shape for the film. During filming, Faris sprained his ankle, but had the ankle taped, and continued filming. Several All-American rugby players, predominantly from the University of Utah and Brigham Young University, played in the film. Some Highland Rugby alumni and current players also played roles in the film. The name of the film is based on a phrase that Gelwix often shares with his team members, \\"kia kaha\\" which in the Maori language means Stay strong. The longer version: \\"Be forever strong on the field, so that you will be forever strong off the field.\\" The players call them \\"Gelwixism\\". Forever Strong is based on an amalgam of true stories about the Highland Rugby high school team. The character Rick Penning is based on a real member of the rugby team who played in Flagstaff, Arizona and was sent to a group home in Salt Lake City. The story attracted the production company Go Films. \\"Forever Strong\\" was the first sports themed film Go Films had made. Producer Adam Abel and Director Ryan Little were attracted to the story because of Highland Rugby's tradition of winning both on and off the field. The film name \\"Forever Strong\\" is taken from the team motto of the Highland High School rugby team. \\"Forever Strong\\" was released in fall 2008 and distributed by Crane Movie Co.

The iwi (tribal grouping) Ngati Toa chief Te Rauparaha is credited with composing this particular haka. The film contains a scene in which one player translates the lyrics of \\"Ka Mate\\" for his teammate.

Comedy career Elliott Kalan began his career at The Daily Show as a production assistant in 2003 before moving up to producer, staff writer, and ultimately head writer. Kalan was co-founder of comedy group The Hypocrites with fellow television writer Brock Mahan. He also hosted a live talk and variety stage show, The Primetime Kalan (originally The Midnight Kalan and later The New Kalan Show). The show was created by Kalan, producer Erik Marcisak, and director Joe Guercio, and written and performed by Kalan, Marcisak, and Dan McCoy. Many of Kalan's Daily Show co-workers appeared on the show, including Stephen Colbert, Samantha Bee, and Rob Corddry. Kalan occasionally appears in bit parts on The Daily Show and has provided voice-over narration for \\"The Decider\\" comic-book segments.

Many blog postings about the incident imply that the Metro violated basic principles of journalism and freedom of expression in firing Kalan.

He moved to London with his mother and family in the mid-1950s, partly motivated by his desire to explore improved sound reproduction technology, and studied at the Paddington Technical College in London. It was during this time that he taught himself to play a number of musical instruments, including guitar, piano, violin, bass guitar and drums. Using an abbreviated form of his name, as Emile Ford, he first entered show business at the age of 20, and made his first public performance at the Buttery, Kensington. His first appearance with a backing group was at the Athenaeum Ballroom in Muswell Hill. His TV appearances in 1958 included outings on The Music Shop, the Pearl Carr & Teddy Johnson Show, Oh, Boy!, and Six-Five Special. He teamed up in January 1959 with his half- brother, bassist George Sweetnam-Ford (born 1 January 1940), electric lead guitarist Ken Street (born 1942), sax player Dave Sweetnam-Ford (b. 1939) and drummer John Cuffley (born 1939) to form Emile Ford & the Checkmates. The band appeared on the TV programme Sunday Serenade, which ran for six weeks. They won the Soho Fair talent contest in July 1959, but turned down a recording contract with EMI because the company would not allow Ford to produce their records, and instead agreed to a deal with Pye Records. Their first self- produced recording, \\"What Do You Want to Make Those Eyes at Me For?\\", a song originally recorded by Ada Jones and Billy Murray in 1917, went to number one in the UK Singles Chart at the end of 1959 and stayed there for six weeks. Ford was the first Black British artist to sell one million copies of a single. In January 1960, Ford signed a two-year employment management contract with Leslie Grade. He had several more hits in the UK, and also scored a number one EP in 1960. The readers of the British music magazine New Musical Express voted Emile Ford & the Checkmates as the \\"Best New Act\\" in 1960. Ford's debut album was made up of covers. He made several albums, but his last studio recordings were in 1963.Biography by Bruce Eder at Allmusic.com. Retrieved 30 January 2013 His half-brothers George and Dave Sweetnam-Ford were later members of the Ferris Wheel. Counting Teardrops, an anthology including all of Ford's recordings with Pye Records, was released in 2001. =Interpretation of sound= Ford, like Jimi Hendrix, had synaesthesia, a condition where the person who can associate certain colours, or even see certain colours in relation to the sound they are hearing. An article about Emile Ford appears in the November 2004 issue of the UK Synaesthesia Association Newsletter.Web-Fi Sound - UK Synaesthesia Association Newsletter, Volume 1, Issue 2 ‚Äì November 2004 He once said that he was gifted with the ability to see and hear sound differently from others and that gift allowed him to make first-class recordings. Backing The female singers that backed him were originally called The Fordettes. They consisted of Margot Quantrell, Eleanor Russell, Vicki Haseman and Betty Prescott. They spent a year on the road with Ford in 1960, playing one-nighters. Back in London they left Ford to sing backup for Joe Brown who Vicki Haseman was engaged to. They were then known as The Breakaways. Audio engineering As a sound engineer, Ford was responsible for creating a backing track system for stage shows, first used in 1960, which provided a basis for what became known as karaoke. In 1969, he set up a recording studio in Barbados with the help of his father, before moving to Sweden. While there, he further developed a new open-air playback system for stage shows, patented as the Liveoteque Sound Frequency Feedback Injection System.

It connects Verona Island to Prospect, in the U.S. state of Maine. It replaced the Waldo‚ÄìHancock Bridge, built in 1931.  Technical information  The Penobscot Narrows Bridge is one of three bridges in the US (the others being Zakim Bridge in Boston, Massachusetts, and Veterans' Glass City Skyway in Toledo, Ohio) constructed recently using a cradle system that carries the strands within the stays from bridge deck to bridge deck, as a continuous element, eliminating anchorages in the pylons. Each epoxy-coated steel strand is carried inside the cradle in a one-inch steel tube. Each strand acts independently, allowing for removal, inspection and replacement of individual strands. The cable-stay system was designed with a system that uses pressurized nitrogen gas to defend against corrosion. In June 2007, six reference strands within three stays were replaced with carbon fiber strands ‚Äì a first in the US. Monitoring on the strands will evaluate this material for future use in bridge designs. These engineering innovations helped the bridge appear in the December 2006 edition of Popular Science as one of the 100 best innovations of the year. The total project cost was $85 million. The bridge was designed as an emergency replacement for the Waldo‚ÄìHancock Bridge. From conception to completion, just 42 months elapsed. A unique project delivery method, referred to as \\"owner facilitated design/build\\" partnered Maine DOT with FIGG as the designer and Cianbro/Reed & Reed LLC as the contractor. The elevator system in the tower, which is claimed to be the fastest and tallest elevator in Maine,http://www.maine.gov/mdot/pnbo/faq.htm was installed by Stanley Elevator Company, Inc.  Observation tower  The Penobscot Bridge site also is home to the Penobscot Narrows Observatory, the first bridge observation tower in the United States and the tallest public bridge observatory in the world.http://www.maine.gov/mdot/pnbo/ The tower reaches into the air and allows visitors to view the bridge, the nearby Fort Knox State Historic Site, the Penobscot River, and Bay. The Penobscot Narrows Observatory opened to the general public on Saturday, May 19, 2007. It is open at the same times of the year as Fort Knox (May 1 to October 31). The elevator has had a series of technical problems, including one on July 1, 2014 when 13 people were temporarily stuck in the Observatory due to the elevator doors not opening.http://bangordailynews.com/2014/07/01/news/midcoast/stuck-elevator- doors-strand-13-people-at-top-of-penobscot-narrows-observatory/  Suicides  The bridge has been the site of at least eight suicides since its opening. This included the Rev. Robert Carlson, a well-known figure in the Bangor area, who was found in the Penobscot River beneath the bridge on November 13, 2011. Before the bridge opened, MaineDOT was aware of many suicide attempts from the Waldo-Hancock Bridge and discussed possible pedestrian safety measures for the new bridge, but no special fencing or other action was taken. On February 26, 2014, in the wake of another suicide from the bridge, independent Rep. Joe Brooks of Winterport proposed emergency legislation to the Maine Legislature to require the installation of a suicide barrier on the bridge. This proposal was rejected due to cost, as a barrier was estimated to cost between $500,000 and $1 million, plus additional costs for regular inspections. As an alternative, two solar-powered phones were installed on each end of the bridge in May 2015 which connect users to a suicide hotline. The phones cost $30,000. State officials were aware of instances the phones were not functional, and increased inspections of them to weekly from the previous monthly. They could not determine if the phones were functional when a March 5, 2017 suicide, the first since the phones were installed, occurred. The phones were found to be out of order on June 23, 2017, when an abandoned car on the bridge resulted in a search of the Penobscot River by authorities looking for its driver.  Closures  The bridge was closed for the first time on December 29, 2013 after ice chunks began falling from the support cables onto the bridge deck. The ice was present from a storm on December 22, but did not fall off until the 29th due to cold weather. Hancock County Sheriff's Deputies began receiving reports of damaged cars that morning and upon inspection recommended to MaineDOT that the bridge be closed. At least five vehicles were damaged and two destroyed by the ice. While MaineDOT estimated that 70% of the ice had fallen by that afternoon, it was feared that reopening the bridge would shake more ice onto the bridge deck. MaineDOT also ruled out sending crews onto the bridge cables to remove the ice as too dangerous but by the following day they were considering bringing in heavy equipment to knock ice off the cables. The bridge reopened on December 30, 2013 after being closed just one day but closed again January 5, 2014 for at least another day, \\"in anticipation that the ice would melt as temperatures moderated for the first time in days.\\" The bridge was briefly closed on December 7, 2017 when a woman armed with a shotgun was seen walking across the bridge from the Prospect side to the Verona Island side and then sat on the deck. After closing the bridge, Maine State Police officers negotiated with the woman by loudspeaker, and she surrendered after approximately 20 minutes.

It is the first in the Strands of Starlight tetralogy. The other novels are Maze of Moonlight, Shroud of Shadow, and Strands of Sunlight. Plot introduction The protagonist of Strands of Starlight is Miriam, a young woman living a fugitive life in the fictional land of Adria, which is set in medieval Western Europe circa 1350. She has a mysterious gift of healing and suffers persecution because of it. Plot summary Miriam's parents expel her at a young age because of her powers of healing, and she wanders for years. At the age of eighteen Miriam falls into the hands of Catholic authorities, denounced as a witch. Grievously injured by her tormentors, Miriam escapes, and Mika, a traveling midwife, takes her in and nurses her back to health. After curing one of Mika's patients of eclampsia, Miriam goes on the run again. As she travels through the forest, she comes upon Baron Roger of Aurverelle, a nobleman out hunting who has been mauled by a bear. After she heals him, he rapes her and leaves her for dead. Inhabitants of Saint Brigid, one of the Free Towns, find her and summon Varden, an elf, to help heal her injuries. While recovering in Saint Brigid, she realizes that the Elves have the power to change people. Formulating a plan for revenge on Baron Roger, she convinces Varden to perform a metamorphosis upon her to make her larger and stronger, able to engage in armed combat. Another Elf, Terrill, agrees to train her in the Elven way of armed combat. The change goes as planned, but she comes to realize that it has made her not completely human, and she is gradually becoming an elf. Aloysius Cranby, the bishop who had imprisoned Miriam, tracks her by imprisoning and interrogating Mika the midwife and comes to Saint Brigid. After days of fruitless searching for Miriam the human, Cranby realizes that Miriam the elf is just one of several elves welcome in the village when she kills one of his companions, though he never realizes the two Miriams are one and the same. Deeming this information more important than completing his original task, he flees the village, and Varden kills him to keep this secret safe. Miriam persuades Terrill to go with her to free Mika from the Inquisition's prison. In a final full-contact sparring match with Terrill, Miriam concludes her transformation into an Elf. As a symbol of acceptance of her completed change, she formally takes the Elvish form of her name, Mirya. She and Terrill go on to infiltrate the prison. Using their Elven senses and agility to find humanly-impossible ways of piercing the tight security, they make their way to the dungeon, free Mika, slaughter the inquisitors, and flee. After leaving the city, Mirya, Mika, and Terrill return to Saint Brigid. Still unable to abandon her quest for vengeance, Mirya uses her Elven powers to search through all of the potential futures, and she forces into reality what had been only a dimly possible future, wherein Baron Roger and she can duel. As a result, Baron Roger conceives the idea of arranging a sham hawking trip in nearby Beldon forest, where Mirya will be waiting for him, so that he will have the privacy to violate a young woman in his care. When Roger arrives, Mirya initiates a sword battle with him. Finally, Mirya prevails over him, wounding him mortally. Realizing only then that keeping him alive is better than killing him, she heals him then uses her powers to remake his mind so that he is less aggressive, less ambitious, and committed to keeping the Free Towns safe.

He was a contemporary of \\"Buffalo\\" Bill Cody, Bat Masterson, John Wesley Hardin, and \\"Wild Bill\\" Hickock, some of whom considered him a friend, others an enemy. Thompson fought for the Confederacy during the Civil War, and later for Emperor Maximilian in Mexico. When hired in 1881 as marshal in Austin, Texas, the crime rate reportedly dropped sharply. Thompson was murdered at the age of 40 in San Antonio, Texas, in the \\"Vaudeville Theater Ambush.\\" Early life Thompson was born in Knottingley, West Yorkshire, England to William and Mary Ann [nee Baker] Thompson, in November 1843.The 1851 Knottingley census records; Records notes that both Ben and Billy were enrolled in school. The family settled in Austin in late 1852. Ben was 8 years old, William 6, and Mary Jane 4 years old at the time. Thompson worked for the Austin Rambler as a news printer's assistant while in his teens. Once he discovered gambling, however, Thompson began traveling and earning a living as a professional gambler. Military service On June 12, 1861, Thompson enlisted in the Confederate States Army at San Antonio, and became a private in the 2nd Regiment, Texas Mounted Rifles, Company H.Note: The company was organized on April 17, 1861, and was known as Captain Hamner's Company. In April 1862, the company became the 2nd Texas Cavalry, Company F, under the command of Captain Tobin. Subsequently, the regiment became Company I, Morgan's Regiment, Texas Cavalry. His brother, Billy Thompson, joined the same regiment. On January 1‚Äì2, 1863, Thompson participated in the Battle of Galveston, where the U.S.S. Harriet Lane was captured. Thompson was wounded during the battle, and was treated for six weeks in a military hospital at Niblett's Bluff (located west of Vinton, Louisiana).Note: Its corresponding address today is 3409 Nibletts Bluff Road. Later that same year, Thompson took part in the Battle of LaFourche Crossing (June 20, 1863), near Thibodaux, Louisiana. The two Thompson brothers \\"found themselves at night separated from the living and standing among the dead.\\" After this battle, Thompson returned home to Austin. He re-enlisted in Company F in September 1863, and served out the remainder of the war stationed along the banks of the Rio Grande. Post war life =Mexico= After the conclusion of the Civil War, Thompson fought in the armed forces of Emperor Maximilian against the Mexican revolutionaries. =Imprisonment= In 1868 Thompson received word that his wife was being physically abused by her brother, Jim Moore. Soon after his return to Texas, he confronted Moore, and severely injured him. Charged with attempted murder, the 25-year-old Thompson was convicted and sentenced to two years in prison. He served time at Huntsville Prison, but eventually received a full pardon. =Abilene, Wild Bill, and John Wesley Hardin= In 1870, Thompson left Texas for Abilene, Kansas, which had become a boomtown due to the expanding cattle trade. In 1871, Thompson opened the \\"Bulls Head Saloon\\" in Abilene, with friend and partner, Phil Coe. Their saloon prospered due to the many cattle drives that gave Abilene a steady stream of cowboys' passing through who were anxious to drink and gamble. It was at the Bulls Head Saloon that Thompson and Coe made the acquaintance of John Wesley Hardin, and actively recruited him in an attempt to rid the town of its marshal, \\"Wild\\" Bill Hickok. The two entrepreneurs had painted a picture of a bull with a large erect penis on the side of their establishment as a form of advertisement. Citizens of the town had complained to Hickok. When Thompson and Coe refused his request to remove the bull, Hickok had altered it himself. Infuriated, Thompson tried to incite Hardin by exclaiming to him: \\"He's a damn Yankee. Picks on rebels, especially Texans, to kill.\\" Hardin, then living under the assumed name of \\"Wesley Clemmons\\" (but better known to the townspeople by the alias, \\"Little Arkansas\\"), replied, \\"If Wild Bill needs killin', why don't you kill him yourself?\\"[sic] Later that night, Hardin was confronted by Hickok, who told him to hand over his guns, which he did. Hickok had no knowledge at the time of Hardin being a wanted man, and he advised \\"Clemmons\\" to avoid problems while remaining in Abilene. Soon afterward, Thompson was injured in a fall from a horse. While he was recuperating, Coe was involved in a fatal shootout with Hickok. Thompson never confronted Hickok over the shooting of Coe, and both men left Abilene soon afterward. =Altercation in Ellsworth = Thompson moved to Ellsworth, Kansas, which was also prospering as a cattle boomtown. On August 15, 1873, Thompson's younger brother, Billy, shot and killed Sheriff Chauncey Whitney. Whitney was standing near the two Thompson brothers, who were facing off against a local police officer, John \\"Happy Jack\\" Morco, and a gambler, John Sterling. The confrontation had developed over a gambling dispute. Whitney was a friend to both brothers, and numerous witnesses confirmed that Whitney stated before he died that the shooting was accidental.\\"Billy Thompson\\" , Images of Yorkshire online; accessed August 2015 Wyatt Earp claimed in an interview with his future biographer, Stuart Lake, that he had arrested Thompson after the altercation although contemporary news accounts and Thompson's own biography describing the episode don't mention his presence at all. But Lake's story Wyatt Earp: Frontier Marshal, published two years after Earp's death, has been found by modern researchers to be a largely fictionalized biography, and the story he described of Earp's role in arresting Thompson was likely an \\"exaggerated account\\". Morco filed charges of assault against Ben Thompson the following day, due to Thompson's having fired in his direction prior to Whitney being shot. Officer Ed Hogue arrested Ben Thompson. That same week, police officer Ed Crawford killed Thompson's friend, Cad Pierce, in an incident that Crawford reportedly provoked. Morco and Hogue soon ran another Thompson friend, Neil Cain, out of town. The town council dismissed Morco, Hogue, and Crawford, for inappropriate behavior. Soon after, newly appointed police officer, J.C. \\"Charlie\\" Brown, killed Morco when he pulled a gun during a disturbance. Friends of Cad Pierce soon killed Crawford. Ed Hogue left town. Billy Thompson fled Kansas, too, but eventually was returned to be unsuccessfully tried for the death of Sheriff Whitney. Later life =Return to Texas= In 1875, Ben Thompson returned to Texas, staying at Fort Elliott, in the Panhandle. There he met and befriended Bat Masterson. When Masterson shot and killed a cavalry Corporal Melvin King in a dispute over a woman, Thompson stepped in to prevent other soldiers from attacking Masterson. After that incident, the Santa Fe Railroad hired both gunmen to intercede in a right-of-way dispute between that railroad and the Rio Grande Railroad. After the railway dispute ended, Thompson returned to Austin, where he opened the Iron Front Saloon. One of his competitors was the Capital Theater, owned and operated by Mark Wilson. On Christmas Eve 1876, Thompson and friends were at the Capital Theater drinking when a fight erupted involving other patrons. When Thompson tried to intervene, Wilson produced a shotgun and fired at Thompson but missed. Thompson then killed Wilson. A bartender, Charley Matthews, fired a Winchester rifle and grazed Thompson's hip. Thompson returned fire, hitting Matthews. Though seriously wounded, Matthews survived. Thompson was not arrested, as the shooting was ruled self defense. In June 1880, Ben Thompson asked Masterson to go to Ogallala, Nebraska (then \\"the end of the Texas Trail\\"), to rescue his younger brother Billy, who was in trouble again as a result of being involved in a shootout. Masterson, Ben, and Billy Thompson escaped from Ogallala, and headed to Dodge City.Reminiscences of a Ranchman; by Edgar Beecher Bronson =In Austin, Texas= In 1881, Thompson was hired by the city of Austin to serve as a city marshal. The following year, Thompson was involved in a dispute with Vaudeville Variety Theater owner, Jack Harris, in San Antonio. Thompson shot and killed Harris. Thompson was indicted for murder, and resigned his position as marshal. He was tried and acquitted, after which he returned to Austin. He was welcomed by the citizens, but he did not return to his law enforcement job.Note: One of the defense lawyers for Thompson was William M. Walton, who later wrote a biography, The Life and Adventures of Ben Thompson  Murdered in San Antonio While on business in San Antonio, on March 11, 1884, Thompson ran into rancher, King Fisher. The two men, who had known one another for several years, decided to attend shows at the Turner Hall Opera House, and later at the Vaudeville Variety Theater. A local lawman, Jacob Coy, sat with them. Thompson wanted to see Joe Foster, a theater owner who had been a friend of Harris's. Thompson had already spoken to Billy Simms, another theater owner, and Foster's new partner.John King Fisher ‚Äì Gunfighter, Lawman ; Texas; Fisher and Thompson were directed upstairs to meet with Foster. Coy and Simms also joined them in the theater box. Foster refused to speak with Thompson. Fisher allegedly noticed that something was not right, when suddenly Simms and Coy stepped aside. As they did, a hail of bullets from an adjoining box hit Thompson and Fisher. Thompson fell, and either Coy or Foster ran up to him and shot him in the head with a pistol. Thompson died almost immediately. Fisher was shot thirteen times, but fired one round in retaliation, possibly wounding Coy, who was crippled for life.Note: the fatal shot may have actually been friendly fire. While trying to draw his pistol, Foster had shot himself in the leg, which was later amputated. He died soon after the surgery. Burial Thompson's body was returned to Austin. He is buried in Oakwood Cemetery in Austin. Fate of Thompson's property Thompson's will deeded all his property to his business partner. Among Thompson's gun collection was a custom made and engraved Stevens-Lord No. 36 target pistol, given to him as a gift from Buffalo Bill. On January 13, 2007, Ben Thompson's roulette table was sold at auction in Waco, Texas.\\"Western-themed items set for auction today\\"; C. Culp; January 17, 2007; Waco Tribune-Herald; retrieved . It was reported that the table was used by Thompson in a gambling house he opened above the Iron Front Saloon, which had been located on Congress Avenue in Austin.\\"Rare auction items linked to San Antonio\\"; J. Zarazua; January 12, 2007; San Antonio Express-News; retrieved . Television portrayal Thompson's character is played by Denver Pyle in seven episodes of the ABC television series, The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp, with Hugh O'Brian in the title role. In one episode \\"The Time for All Good Men\\" (June 4, 1957), the actor Mike Ragan played Clay Allison, who joins Thompson and John Wesley Hardin (Phillip Pine) in coming to Earp's aid in a shootout with the owner and foreman, respectively, of the Big T Ranch, Rance Purcell (Richard Devon) and Gus Andrews (Grant Withers). Walter Coy played Thompson in a single 1959 episode of the same series.

Born in Northfield, Birmingham, Byrne made his debut for Warwickshire against Middlesex in late July 1912, returning figures of 3-9 (which were to remain his career best) in the first innings; two of these wickets came in his first over, his first victim being future Test batsman Frank Mann. With the bat he was rather less successful, making 8 and 4. He played a further seven games for Warwickshire that season, and though managed only another three wickets he ended with a bowling average of just 14.00. He did not contribute much with the bat: in all of 1912 he scored only 36 runs in 12 innings for a batting average of a 3.00. He also took the only catch of his entire career, to dismiss Sussex opener Robert Relf off the bowling of Willie Quaife. Byrne played four more first-class matches in his career, two apiece in 1914 and 1921, but these appearances were for Worcestershire. His figures for the county are less than impressive (28 runs at 3.50; one wicket at 155.00), but nevertheless he might have played more for them had he not been constrained by his career as an officer in the Army.Obituaries in 1973. Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, 1974. His only wicket for Worcestershire came on his debut for the county, against Leicestershire in July 1914, when he dismissed Arthur Mounteney. He died in Torteval, Guernsey at the age of 81. His uncle, James Byrne, had a more substantial first-class career, captaining Warwickshire between 1903 and 1907.

Her books have won international recognition and have been published in many countries.  Life  L√≠dia Jorge was born in the village of Boliqueime in the Algarve region of southern Portugal in 1946. After finishing secondary school she moved to Lisbon to attend the Universidade de Lisboa (University of Lisbon) where she obtained an Honours degree in Romanic Philology.

It is also located next to a cluster of mid-rise office buildings, Cumberland Mall, Truist Park, The Battery Atlanta and the Cobb Energy Performing Arts Centre. It has hosted over 20,000 events and 10 million of guests. The venue operates under the direction of the Cobb-Marietta Coliseum and Exhibit Hall Authority and is located at the intersection of three major highways: Interstate 75, Interstate 285, and Cobb Parkway (U.S. 41) just northwest of the city. The Galleria Specialty Mall, which pre-dates the convention center, is located downstairs, with meeting halls upstairs. History Cobb Galleria Centre was constructed in 1994 by the Cobb-Marietta Coliseum and Exhibit Hall Authority to serve the need for a facility to accommodate small and mid-sized tradeshows, conventions, meetings and social events. With more than 320,000 total square feet, the facility features of exhibit space, a ballroom, 20 meeting rooms and four executive boardrooms. Located within the Galleria complex, an upscale office/retail/hotel area, the Centre is connected to the Galleria Specialty Mall and the 522-room Renaissance Waverly Hotel. Accessible by a pedestrian sky bridge are the Sheraton Suites Galleria Hotel, Cumberland Mall, Truist Park and The Battery Atlanta.

The immorality and ruthlessness of the drug trade gradually wears on D'Angelo's conscience, bringing him into conflict with the Barksdale leadership, most notably Stringer Bell. Biography =Season 1= D'Angelo Barksdale is a high-ranking lieutenant in the criminal organization of his uncle Avon Barksdale; his mother Brianna is also a high-ranking advisor. Prior to the series, D'Angelo controlled the high-rise tower of 221 West Fremont, a major drug market. He was confronted by dealer \\"Pooh\\" Blanchard in the lobby and, in a panic, shot him in front of civilian witnesses. He was quickly arrested and served 8 months in county jail before, in the series premiere, standing trial for this murder, represented by the organization's lawyer Maurice Levy. Though one witness, William Gant, willingly testifies, the organization has scared and/or bribed the other witness, Nakeesha Lyles, to recant her testimony. D'Angelo is thus acquitted. As punishment for his carelessness, Avon demotes D'Angelo to the low rise projects known as \\"The Pit\\", where his crew consists of Bodie Broadus, Poot, Wallace, Cass and Sterling. Over the course of the season, D'Angelo grows more and more ambivalent about the drug trade. When William Gant turns up dead, D'Angelo is shaken, assuming Avon had it done as revenge for testifying. He is brought in for questioning by detectives Jimmy McNulty and Bunk Moreland, who trick him into writing a letter of apology to Gant's fictitious family (in actuality a photo of Bunk's family). Levy arrives and stops him before he can write anything incriminating, and he is released. He questions his uncle, who evades his accusations and persuades him to remain loyal to the family. D'Angelo is very hesitant about discipline (such as the brutal beating of Johnny Weeks, or punishing dealers Cass and Sterling for stealing small amounts). D'Angelo is also unwittingly involved in a second murder, that of Avon's girlfriend Deirdre Kresson. When cooperating with the police after his arrest they question him about this murder. D'Angelo claims he had delivered drugs to Kresson, serving as a distraction when Wee-Bey Brice killed her. Wee-Bey gladly takes the blame for this and other murders that were unsolved at the time of his arrest, since he was facing life without parole either way. Earlier in the season, D'Angelo had falsely claimed responsibility for killing Kresson himself, apparently in an attempt to impress his subordinates Bodie, Poot, and Wallace. D'Angelo has a son, Tyrell, by his girlfriend Donette. She wants D'Angelo to move in with her, but he does not want, or is unable to handle the responsibility of being a regular citizen and family man. D'Angelo begins dating a dancer from his uncle's strip club, Shardene Innes, and lives with her for a short time, until Shardene finds out from the police that her colleague Keesha had overdosed, died, and been left in a dumpster after attending a Barksdale crew party. She accuses D'Angelo of seeing her as trash that could easily be discarded, and moves out. She goes on to cooperate with the police unit investigating the Barksdale clan and later begins a relationship with Lester Freamon. Under D'Angelo's firm leadership, The Pit begins to turn a good profit. It nevertheless becomes a cause for concern when its stash is stolen by Omar Little, and, the next day, the police raid. (Their information is slightly outdated, and they raid a now abandoned stash house, but Lester finds D'Angelo's uncoded pager number on a wall.) Stringer chastises D'Angelo for his sloppiness, and Avon places a bounty on Omar's crew. Wallace and Poot identify Omar's boyfriend, Brandon, in an arcade; D'Angelo relays the message to Stringer, who has Brandon captured, tortured, and killed, and his corpse displayed in the courtyard of Wallace's home. Wallace becomes haunted by his role in Brandon's death. Relating to Wallace's aversion to the violence of their trade, D'Angelo develops a friendship with Wallace. When Wallace wants to leave the business after seeing Brandon's mutilated remains, D'Angelo is supportive and gives him money. Stringer begins asking after Wallace; D'Angelo senses that Wallace is in trouble and asks Avon to leave him alone, reassuring him that Wallace is no danger to the organization. When Wallace returns and asks for his old job back, D'Angelo tries to get him to leave, but is unable to save him. Wallace is killed on Stringer's orders, though D'Angelo remains unaware that Bodie and Poot killed him. Based indirectly on information Shardene provided to the police (the microphone inside the club which listens to Avon), D'Angelo is arrested while running drugs from New York, and again interrogated. McNulty tells him Wallace is dead. D'Angelo remembers the trick from before that got him writing a letter to Gant's fictitious family and doesn't believe him at first. Stringer comes to talk to him and refuses to answer when D'Angelo demands to know where Wallace is. Stringer warns D'Angelo to shut his mouth which confirms in D'Angelo's mind what had happened. He grows angry and tells Stringer he doesn't want to use Levy, permanently driving a wedge in their already fractured relationship. D'Angelo is furious at Wallace's death, and briefly turns state's witness against the Organization. He tells them where Wee-Bey has fled to after shooting Kima Greggs, and offers numerous details of his uncle's organization. However, a visit from his mother convinces him of his duty to his family, and he reneges on the deal. Due to his refusal to cooperate, he is sentenced to a maximum of 20 years in prison. While serving his sentence, he says the best he can hope for is 10 years before a possibility for parole. =Season 2= While in prison with Avon and Wee-Bey, D'Angelo turns to snorting heroin. Although he is distant from his uncle, Avon still protects him and gets him a cushy job in the prison library. Wee-Bey is being harassed by a guard named Dwight Tilghman, who is involved in the prison drug trade. Avon arranges to have Tilghman's heroin supply laced with rat poison and advises D'Angelo to stay off the drug for a few days to prove he's not an addict, but does not tell D'Angelo of the plan. At least one of the inmates D'Angelo was friendly with accepted doses of the tainted drugs. After five prisoners die and eight more land in the infirmary, Avon informs on Tilghman in exchange for an earlier parole board hearing and a recommendation for early release. D'Angelo refuses to take part in the plan and, disgusted by his uncle's immorality, declares that he wants nothing more to do with his family or with Stringer. Stringer Bell grows afraid that D'Angelo may inform on the organization and hires a contract killer from Washington D.C., who in turn arranges for a prisoner to strangle D'Angelo with a belt in the back room of the library, staging his scene to look like a suicide. No investigation is launched, although McNulty becomes convinced that it was a murder when he is belatedly informed and investigates it, on his own. D'Angelo's family members continue to believe it was a suicide until McNulty confronts Donette and Brianna with his suspicions, and Stringer finally tells Avon of his involvement in season 3. Critical response A San Francisco Chronicle review picked the scene of D'Angelo instructing Bodie and Wallace on the rules of chess as one of the first season's finest moments. They praised the character of D'Angelo and the show's portrayal of his difficulties as \\"middle management\\" in the drug organization: having to deal with unreliable subordinates, demanding superiors, and his own conscience. Other The character's name is a tribute to Donald Angelo Barksdale, the first African- American player of the ABA/NBA team Baltimore Bullets. The character's favorite beverage appears to be ginger ale, as he is seen asking for and drinking it numerous times throughout the course of season 1.

From 1984-87, she lived in Paris, where she studied painting at √âcole Nationale Sup√©rieure des Beaux-Arts. She returned to New York in 1987 and worked at Watanabe Studio, Ltd.Watanabe Studio, Ltd. in Brooklyn, NY, producing limited edition prints for Sol LeWitt, Sue Coe and others.

In 1999, Debs & Co. gallery, NY, gave Garnett her first solo exhibition, \\"Buster-Jangle\\", which consisted of paintings based on photos and film stills of atomic bomb tests from the 1950s released in 1990-91 by the US government under the Freedom of Information Act. The exhibition was noted for its exploration of a ‚Äúparadoxical realm of terrible beauty‚Ä¶ tying together the histories of the bomb and American landscape painting.\\"Griffin, Tim. ‚ÄúJoy Garnett, Buster- Jangle.‚Äù TimeOut NY, Issue No. 193 June 3‚Äì10, 1999.

This generated an online compilation of material that she launched as a website, \\"The Bomb Project\\".The Bomb Project \\"The Bomb Project\\" addressed the role of the digital image as a cultural artifact. Garnett attempted to reveal the information and hegemonic coding within these images to ‚Äúestablish a context where art, science and government are presented as interlocking and overlapping areas.‚Äù\\"The Bomb Project\\", (about page) After its launch in 2000, \\"The Bomb Project\\" was expanded to include still and moving declassified imagery, primary source documents, links to current events and news articles. The original documentation produced by the nuclear industry was offered side by side with artist and activist views, providing a platform for comparative study and a resource for artists. Use of found images Garnett explored the problem of the found object by re-mediating and transforming the image of a documentary/technical photograph by painting it (ca.1997-2018), shifting its context and opening it up for multiple interpretations by the viewer, consistent with the conventions of visual art.Butler, Sharon: \\"Blast Radius,\\" The Huffington Post, October 25, 2010 Garnett's paintings were sometimes framed as responding to, engaging and extending contemporary media theory.Lippard, Lucy: \\"Strange Weather\\", solo exhibition catalogue essay, \\"Strange Weather\\", The National Academy of Sciences, 2005 \\"Molotov\\" and surrounding controversy Garnett's 2004 exhibition \\"Riot\\" featured a series of paintings based on images pulled from mass media sources, depicting figures in \\"extreme emotional states.\\"\\"Riot\\", Debs & Co., New York, January 15-February 21, 2004 The painting entitled \\"Molotov\\" was sourced from a jpeg found on the Internet that was later discovered to be a fragment of a larger photographSusan Meiselas, \\"Sandinistas at the walls of the Esteli National Guard headquarters, Esteli, Nicaragua, 1979\\" taken by Susan Meiselas during the Sandinista Revolution (1979).

Popular support for Garnett and her artwork, marshalled through a list-serv at Rhizome.org, inspired a solidarity campaign called \\"Joywar\\", in which images of Garnett's painting were reposted widely on the Internet, or remixed and circulated in new forms.

It lies near the bank of the Sutlej river. The village is on the border with Pakistan, opposite the Pakistani village of Ganda Singh Wala.  The National Martyrs Memorial  Hussainniwala is the site of the National Martyrs Memorial, which marks the location where Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru were cremated on 23 March 1931. It is also the cremation place of Batukeshwar Dutt, who was also involved in bombing the Central Legislative Assembly with Singh, as well as that of Singh's mother, Vidyawati. After the Partition of India, the cremation spot became a part of Pakistan but on 17 January 1961 it was returned to India in exchange for 12 villages near the Sulemanki Headworks (Fazilka). An annual fair takes place at the memorial on 23 March, which is the anniversary of Singh's death. The day is also observed across the state of Punjab.  India‚ÄìPakistan border  The border crossing is now closed for travelers, although a flag retreat ceremony is still held daily. Until 1970, it was the principal road crossing between India and Pakistan,Paul Mason (2006) Via Rishikesh: an account of hitchhiking to India in 1970 and was a trade route for truckers, mostly for the import of Kandahari Angoor (dehydrated grapes) and other fruits and food products from Pakistan and Afghanistan. The border crossing was replaced by the border crossing at Wagah, a little further north. In 2005 there were proposals to reopen the border,Daily Times, 8 September 2005 but it remained closed. Hussainiwala Headworks is located at this village across the Sutlej river which supplies irrigation water to Bikaner canal and Eastern canal = Retreat Ceremony = Since 1970 there has been a Retreat Ceremony at the border crossing every day at 6 pm, similar to the Mahavir/Sadaki near Fazilka and Wagah/Atari border ceremony.District Firozpur website: Retreat Ceremony at Husainiwala Attendees are seated in close proximity here, as compared to Wagah where crowds are kept far apart. And unlike the jingoistic display at Wagah which draws nationalistic tourists from all over India and Pakistan, the Hussainiwala ceremony is a more intimate ceremony attended mostly by local Punjabis from either side of the border. As a result, the atmosphere is not as tense, and Indian and Pakistani attendees often smile and wave to one another, and even cheer for each other's guards as they perform the border spectacle.  Indo-Pakistan War of 1965  Hussainiwala Battle was a battle fought and won after the partition of India. It is the first post Independence battle honour and the 22nd won by the 2 Maratha Light Infantry since its inception in 1768. At the outbreak of the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965, the 2nd Maratha Light Infantry (Kali Panchwin) was based in Mathura when it deployed a small unit to Hussainiwala in the Firozpur sector of Punjab. During 1965 war, the Kali Panchwin successfully repulsed Pak attack on Hussainiwala headworks in Ferozepur sector. The valour displayed by the Maratha soldiers resulted in thwarting the nefarious designs of enemy infantry brigades and tank companies on the night of September 19/20, 1965. The determined retaliation to attack by the mighty 24 soldiers resulted in the enemy fleeing from the scene, leaving behind heavy arms, tanks, ammunition and four prisoners of war. Romeo Battery of 82 Light Regiment was in direct sport of (Kali Panchwin). In its illustrious history spanning more than two hundred and fifty years, the unit has carved a niche for itself in the annals of military history. The battalion has won one Ashok Chakra, two Kirti Chakra, one Vir Chakra, six Shaurya Chakra, two Yudh Seva Medals, twelve Sena Medals, one Bar to Sena Medal, two Vishishtha Seva Medals, ten Mention-in-Despatches, one Bar to Mention-in Despatches and ninety commendation cards. The Colours of the battalion emblazoned with 22 Battle Honours is a proud testimony of that battlefield where these handful of Marathas filled the air with the war cries of Har Har Mahadev and Bol Shri Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Ki Jai. The enemy baffled and panic struck thinking the information they received of just a handful of soldiers posted there was wrong, they mistook it for an entire battalion. Hussainiwala Day is always a rejuvenating occasion wherein serving persons get a chance to meet veterans and revive the glorious days of the Kali Panchwin. Kali Panchwin, as the battalion is affectionately called, always recalls the memories of Hussainiwala amongst some of its heroes like Lt Col TTA Nolan, 2/Lt PS Rana, Sub Ramdas Somwanshi, Nk Vishnu Kadam, Nk Laxman Shinde, Nk Shamrao Chavan, L/Nk Narayan More, Sep Daga Nikam,Sep Baban Falke, Sep Vasu Naik, Sep Raghunath Chalke, Sep Shankar Bhosale and Sep Mahadeo Paste. The battalion lives true to its motto, Kartavya Maan Sahas meaning 'Duty, Honour and Courage'. It defended the Hussainiwala headworks against an attack by a full infantry brigade supported by armoured columns of the Pakistan Army. The tower on the other side of the river was captured and razed to ground. Lt KM. Palande, Lt. Feroz Doctor, Lt. S Deshpande showed great courage and ingenuity by targeting aggressive patrols and targeting the enemy. The adversary launched a determined attack on the forward two companies supported by tanks, using heavy artillery fire and air support in this engagement. The enemy attack was stalled by accurate artillery fire, the murderous fire of the Vickers machine guns and 106 mm RCL guns. The enemy attack broke up in the face of stiff resistance and enemy retreated, leaving behind two destroyed tanks and two working tanks, with several dead in the fields. The commanding officer Lt. Col TTA Nolan along with Battery Commander Captain SKS Wallia were killed by an enemy artillery shelling the next morning while supervising operations. It was a major loss. Kali Panchwin was awarded the battle honour \\"Hussainiwala\\" for its role in the 1965 War.  Indo- Pakistan War of 1971  In the Indo-Pakistan War of 1971 many memorials of Bhagat Singh and others were destroyed by Pakistani artillery. Two companies of the 15th Punjab (formerly First Patiala) were attacked by four brigades of the Pakistan Army on 3 December 1971 at 18:35 hours. Nearly 4,000 Pakistani men attacked the Indian side with 15 tanks and heavy artillery support. The Indian commanders included Major Waraich, Major Singh's and Major Kanwaljit Sandhu, who was badly injured. Major SPS Waraich was reported captured, as were many JCOs and men as the squadrons were taken by surprise and had little time to get to their bunkers. A Pakistani radio news telecast reported (in Urdu) that Maj Waraich hamari hiraasat mein hain (Maj Waraich is in our custody). There was a subsequent report that Maj Waraich was in a North West Frontier jail. Their current status is unknown. They are listed as missing by the Indian Government along with 52 others including a Maj Ashok Suri who wrote a letter to his father in 1975 from Karachi stating that he was alive and well.

The film's December release was as a double feature with Day the World Ended, American Releasing Corporation's first dual venture. ARC thereafter changed its name, becoming American International Pictures. Plot A mysterious, man-sized monster kills a fisherman at sea. Biologist Ted Baxter (Kent Taylor) and Federal Agent William Grant (Rodney Bell) discover the man's body, washed up on the beach and covered with radiation burns. They decide to investigate the strange death. After two young divers are killed by the monster, Ted and Grant decide to go dive in the same location and investigate the area. They discover a glowing radioactive rock being guarded by the monster. Grant shoots it with a harpoon gun, allowing them to escape, but the creature survives. Ted eventually discovers that Dr. King (Michael Whalen), another marine biologist, created the monster and the radioactive rock with a mutating device in his laboratory. Meanwhile, foreign agents try to discover Dr. King's secrets, while Ted and King's daughter Lois (Cathy Downs) develop a relationship. Agent Grant captures the foreign agents after one of them kills King's secretary with a spear gun. Ted finally tells Dr. King that the monster is killing people and that it must be stopped. When King witnesses a ship explode as it passes over the rock, he realizes Ted is right. He destroys his lab and goes out to the ocean to kill his creation using dynamite. Shortly before a timed detonation, the monster grabs Dr. King while he is planting the underwater explosives. Ted, Grant, and Lois arrive just in time to witness the large explosion, which destroys the rock, the monster, and Dr. King.

ARC's cofounder James H. Nicholson came up with the film's Phantom from 10,000 Leagues title. He was looking for a feature to support and team with Day the World Ended. ARC lacked money to make both, so they allocated Phantom to Dan and Jack Milner, film editors who wanted to get into feature-film production.

Both proved popular with audiences, due in part to savvy marketing by James H. Nicholson. In January 1956, the films were released simultaneously in 250 New England theaters grossing $45,000 from just 2 Boston theaters in its first week. Within two months of their release, both films had earned $400,000. =Theatrical= =Home media= The film has been released on home media numerous times by different distributors over the years, either as a single or double feature, due to the film's entry into the public domain.

The diaries feature a great deal of background information, far more than could reasonably be put into the novels. However, some of this occasionally finds its way into the series proper - the concept of female assassins, the introduction of Black Widow House, and the characters of Miss Alice Band and Mme les Deux-√âp√©es were notable ideas that first appeared in the Assassins' Guild Yearbook, and later in the Discworld short story \\"Minutes of the Meeting to Form the Proposed Ankh-Morpork Federation of Scouts\\" in A Blink of the Screen, to then becoming characters and a playable Assassins' Guild House in Discworld MUD.

During the Spanish Civil War it was adapted for both civilian and military purposes. The Italian air force briefly used the airport as one of their bases to launch bomber raids over the mainland. During 1946, Son Bonet was equipped as a customs airport and opened to domestic and international traffic in July. Over the following decade, the airport traffic increased, which facilitated modernisation and improvements to be made. However, the airport could neither accommodate larger aircraft nor could the runway be extended, so these services were transferred to the island's main airport in July 1959. Today it is primarily used for general and leisure aviation, with approximately 75,000 flights per year.

Economic Geyser is a small, usually inactive geyser located between the Giant Geyser group and the Grand Geyser group. Economic Geyser was once a popular, frequently-erupting geyser until it became essentially dormant in the 1920s. Economic Geyser is believed to be named for its behavior during its active days. It is reported that most of the water ejected drained back into the vent after the eruption, thus making the geyser appear to conserve its water. It was most likely named by Frank Jay Haynes, the park photographer from 1883-1916. The temperature of the water in geyser pools and other geothermal features can be judged by the color of the bacteria living in the water. Changes in the size and color of bacteria mats at Economic Geyser imply that the geyser is heating up. Photographs of the geyser vent taken in the 1990s show a quiet pool very dark with algae. Photographs of the vent taken in 2006 show a pool of clear water with traces of the bacterial colors associated with higher temperatures.

History The First National Bank was established In 1863, and was the first bank in Washtenaw County. The bank hired the Ann Arbor firm of Fry and Kasurin to design this building, and construction began in 1927. The building was completed in 1930, and was at the time the tallest building in Ann Arbor. The building housed both the bank and a number of prominent local professional firms. In 1936, First National merged with two other financial institutions and vacated the building; the former banking offices were converted into retail space. The building was purchased by First Martin Corporation in 1981, and the company completely renovated the entire structure in 1982. As of 2018, First Martin owns and operates the building. Description The First National Bank Building stands at ten floors in height, with rear wings of two and five stories. The building is designed with an interesting blend of Art Deco and Art moderne architectural styles.

History Courage & Co Ltd was started by John Courage at the Anchor Brewhouse in Horsleydown, Bermondsey in 1787. He was a Scottish shipping agent of French Huguenot descent. It became Courage & Donaldson in 1797. By 1888, it had been registered simply as Courage. In 1955, the company merged with Barclay, Perkins & Co Ltd (who were located at the nearby Anchor Brewery) to become Courage, Barclay & Co Ltd. Only five years later another merger with the Reading based Simonds Brewery led to the name changing to Courage, Barclay, Simonds & Co Ltd. In the late 1960s, the group had assets of approximately ¬£100m, and operated five breweries in London, Reading, Bristol, Plymouth and Newark-on-Trent. It owned some 5,000 licensed premises spread over the whole of Southern England, a large part of South Wales and an extensive area of the East Midlands and South Yorkshire. It was employing some 15,000 people and producing something like of beer annually.Pudney, John. A Draught of Contentment. The Story of the Courage Group (1971) Its name was simplified to Courage Ltd in October 1970 and the company was taken over by the Imperial Tobacco Group Ltd two years later. Its vast Worton Grange (later the Berkshire) brewery was opened on the Reading/Shinfield border in 1978. The Anchor Brewery closed in 1981 and all brewing was transferred to Reading. Imperial Tobacco was acquired by the Hanson Trust in 1986 and it sold off Courage to Elders IXL who were renamed the Foster's Brewing Group in 1990. The following year the Courage section of Foster's merged with the breweries of Grand Metropolitan. Its public houses were owned by a joint-company called Inntrepreneur Estates. Scottish & Newcastle purchased Courage from Foster's in 1995, creating Scottish Courage as its brewing arm. In January 2007, the rights for the production, marketing and sales of the Courage brands were sold to Wells & Young's Brewing Company of Bedford which reverted to Charles Wells once Wells bought out Young's shares in the venture. This is managed by a venture called Courage Brands Ltd Heineken retained a 17 per cent stake in the venture until 2011, when Wells & Young's acquired complete control. The Berkshire Brewery closed in April 2010. Courage Best has undergone a significant decline in sales from almost 421,000 hectolitres (9.3 million gallons) in 2003 to under 142,000 hectolitres (3.1 million gallons) in 2012.Alcoholic Drinks: Euromonitor from trade sources/national statistics The decline of Courage Directors has levelled off at around 60,000 hectolitres (1.3 million gallons), which is down from 140,000 hectolitres (3.1 million gallons) in 2003.

This work is done in an ultra-high vacuum environment, because ambient gasses or liquids would otherwise modify the surface under study. This allows unambiguous identification of the reactive species and processes of interest. These surfaces can be templates for nanomechanical devices or catalysts for chemical reactions. The central theme to her work is understanding of the so-called \\"pressure-gap\\", the disparity observed between reactions that occur under high pressure and the corresponding lack of reaction observed under ultra-high vacuum conditions. Her contributions to surface science include discovery of collision induced processes at surfaces, in which an energetic, neutral, noble gas atom impinges on a surface pre-covered with an adsorbate, causing a reaction to occur between the surface and the adsorbate. The reactions observed include dissociation, desorption, and absorption into the bulk of the substrate. In addition, she discovered that electron energy loss spectroscopy can be used to detect species absorbed in the bulk of a substrate, and can be used to differentiate between bulk and surface species. This paved the way for her discovery that hydrogen atoms absorbed in the bulk of a nickel sample are the key reactant in the hydrogenation of unsaturated hydrocarbons. Another major discovery involved the reaction of fluorine molecules with a silicon surface (a reaction that is key to semiconductor device etching), in which the silicon surface abstracts a fluorine atom from the incident fluorine molecule, and the remaining fluorine atom scatters into the gas phase. This is the reverse of the Eley-Rideal mechanism, one of the fundamental mechanism of gas-surface chemical reactions. =Honors and awards= Prior to holding the John C.

The school is neighbored by the Far East Recreation Center and Big Walnut Creek. History The school colors are red, gray and white and the school's sports teams nickname is the Scots in honor of the school's sister school, The Harlaw Academy in Scotland. In recognition of this fact the school's color scheme has been officially recorded as a distinct tartan pattern. Walnut Ridge is a four-year high school with an enrollment of 860. It is accredited by the North Central Association of Secondary Schools and Colleges, and by the Department of Education of the State of Ohio. It has student representation from 27 countries. At its peak in the early 1970s, the school had an enrollment of over 1,800 in grades 10-12. Starting with the 1971-72 school year, Walnut Ridge went into split sessions. This lasted until enrollment declined due to other schools opening in the area. Declining enrollment for city schools started after many fled Columbus City Schools after a federal court mandated desegregation of the district in 1979. In 1987, a four-student team from the school won the National Academic Championship, a question-and-answer competition, beating the team from Walt Whitman High School of Bethesda, Maryland.http://www.qbwiki.com/wiki/view/1987_NAC The team consisted of Susan Wright, Garrett Schwartz, Mu Chun Yin and team captain Michael Dake.http://infoweb.newsbank.com/resources/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft;_dat=news/11B86F5B798E11E0&rft;_id=info:sid/infoweb.newsbank.com&rft;_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&svc;_dat=NewsBank&req;_dat=0FDCCF0B172AF019 Curriculum Academically, Walnut Ridge offers Advanced Placement courses in chemistry, English literature and composition, calculus (AB), government & politics and U.S. History. It also offers PSEO (Post Secondary Enrollment Option) through Hocking College. Students enrolled in the PSEO program can earn high school credit as well as college credit in English and Government. Concurrent enrollment is also available through local universities. Sports In sports, the school's traditional rival was Eastmoor High School. This was in part because when Walnut Ridge opened to students in 1961, more than half of its enrollment were former Eastmoor students. Walnut Ridge Students attended classes in the Eastmoor High School building in the afternoons while the Eastmoor students attended classes in the same building in the mornings. This continued for a few months until the new Walnut Ridge building received its certificate of occupancy. From the late 60‚Äôs on, winner of the annual football game between these two schools received the Victory Bell trophy to go along with their bragging rights. Since 2000 the biggest rival has been Independence High School. Walnut Ridge fields varsity teams in baseball, boys' & girls' basketball, cheer-leading, boys' & girls' cross-country, drill team, football, boys' & girls' golf, boys' soccer, softball, tennis, boys' & girls' track&field; and wrestling.

Neel to explain why certain populations and subpopulations in the modern day are prone to diabetes mellitus type 2. He proposed the hypothesis in 1962 to resolve a fundamental problem: diabetes is clearly a very harmful medical condition, yet it is quite common, and it was already evident to Neel that it likely had a strong genetic basis. The problem is to understand how disease with a likely genetic component and with such negative effects may have been favoured by the process of natural selection. Neel suggested the resolution to this problem is that genes which predispose to diabetes (called 'thrifty genes') were historically advantageous, but they became detrimental in the modern world. In his words they were \\"rendered detrimental by 'progress'\\". Neel's primary interest was in diabetes, but the idea was soon expanded to encompass obesity as well. Thrifty genes are genes which enable individuals to efficiently collect and process food to deposit fat during periods of food abundance in order to provide for periods of food shortage (feast and famine). According to the hypothesis, the 'thrifty' genotype would have been advantageous for hunter-gatherer populations, especially child-bearing women, because it would allow them to fatten more quickly during times of abundance. Fatter individuals carrying the thrifty genes would thus better survive times of food scarcity. However, in modern societies with a constant abundance of food, this genotype efficiently prepares individuals for a famine that never comes. The result of this mismatch between the environment in which the brain evolved and the environment of today is widespread chronic obesity and related health problems like diabetes. The hypothesis has received various criticisms and several modified or alternative hypotheses have been proposed. Hypothesis and research by Neel James Neel, a professor of Human Genetics at the University of Michigan Medical School, proposed the \\"thrifty genotype\\" hypothesis in 1962 in his paper \\"Diabetes Mellitus: A 'Thrifty' Genotype Rendered Detrimental by 'Progress'?\\" Neel intended the paper to provoke further contemplation and research on the possible evolutionary and genetic causes of diabetes among populations that had only recently come into regular contact with Westerners. The genetic paradox Neel sought to address was this: diabetes conferred a significant reproductive (and thus evolutionary) disadvantage to anyone who had it; yet the populations Neel studied had diabetes in such high frequencies that a genetic predisposition to develop diabetes seemed plausible. Neel sought to unravel the mystery of why genes that promote diabetes had not been naturally-selected out of the population's gene pool.Neel 1962, p. 359 Neel proposed that a genetic predisposition to develop diabetes was adaptive to the feast and famine cycles of paleolithic human existence, allowing humans to fatten rapidly and profoundly during times of feast in order that they might better survive during times of famine. This would have been advantageous then but not in the current environment.Neel 1962 The hypothesis was proposed before there was a clear distinction between the different types of diabetes. Neel later stated that the hypothesis applied to non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. In its original form the theory more specifically stated that diabetes may be due to a rapid insulin response which would prevent loss of glucose from the urine. Furthermore, it made use of a then popular theory which was later disproven. This argued that specific insulin antagonists were released in response to insulin with this causing diabetes. In the decades following the publications of his first paper on the \\"thrifty genotype\\" hypothesis, Neel researched the frequency of diabetes and (increasingly) obesity in a number of other populations and sought out observations that might disprove or discount his \\"thrifty gene\\" hypothesis. Neel's further investigations cast doubt on the \\"thrifty genotype\\" hypothesis. If a propensity to develop diabetes were an evolutionary adaptation, then diabetes would have been a disease of long standing in those populations currently experiencing a high frequency of diabetes. However, Neel found no evidence of diabetes among these populations earlier in the century.Neel, J.V. 1982. \\"The Thrifty Genotype Revisited.\\" In The Genetics of Diabetes Mellitus, ed. J. Kobberling and R. Tattersall. New York: Academic Press, 293-93. And when he tested younger members of these populations for glucose intolerance - which might have indicated a predisposition for diabetes - he found none. In 1989, Neel published a review of his further research based on the \\"thrifty genotype\\" hypothesis and in the Introduction noted the following: \\"The data on which that (rather soft) hypothesis was based has now largely collapsed.\\" However, Neel argued that \\"...the concept of a \\"thrifty genotype\\" remains as viable as when first advanced...\\". He went on to advance that the thrifty genotype concept be thought of in the context of a \\"compromised\\" genotype that affects several other metabolically-related diseases. Neel in a 1998 review described an expanded form of the original hypothesis, diabetes being caused by \\"thrifty genes\\" adapted specifically for intermittent starvation, to a more complex theory of several related diseases such as diabetes, obesity, and hypertension (see also metabolic syndrome) being caused by physiological systems adapted for an older environment being pushed beyond their limits by environmental changes. Thus, one possible remedy for these diseases is changing diet and exercise activity to more closely reflect that of the ancestral environment. Other research The thrifty genotype hypothesis has been used to explain high, and rapidly escalating, levels of obesity and diabetes among groups newly introduced to western diets and environments, from South Pacific Islanders, to Sub Saharan Africans, to Native Americans in the Southwestern United States, to Inuit. The original \\"thrifty gene\\" hypothesis argued that famines were common and severe enough to select for thrifty gene in the 2.5 million years of human paleolithic history. This assumption is contradicted by some anthropological evidence.Lee, R.B. 1968. \\"What Hunters Do for a Living, or, How to Make Out on Scarce Resources.\\" in Lee and Devore, eds. 1968. Many of the populations that later developed high rates of obesity and diabetes appeared to have no discernible history of famine or starvation (for example, Pacific Islanders whose \\"tropical-equatorial islands had luxuriant vegetation all year round and were surrounded by lukewarm waters full of fish.\\"). Moreover, one of the most significant problems for the 'thrifty gene' idea is that it predicts that modern hunter gatherers should get fat in the periods between famines. Yet data on the body mass index of hunter-gatherer and subsistence agriculturalists clearly show that between famines they do not deposit large fat stores As a response to such criticisms, a modified \\"thrifty\\" gene hypothesis is that the famines and seasonal shortages of food that occurred only during the agricultural period may have exerted enough pressure to select for \\"thrifty\\" genes. Thrifty phenotype hypothesis The thrifty phenotype hypothesis arose from challenges posed to the thrifty gene hypothesis. The thrifty phenotype hypothesis theorizes that instead of arising genetically, the \\"thrifty factors\\" developed as a direct result of the environment within the womb during development. The development of insulin resistance is theorized to be directly related to the body \\"predicting\\" a life of starvation for the developing fetus. Hence, one of the main causes of type 2 diabetes has been attributed to poor fetal and infant growth and the subsequent development of the metabolic syndrome. Since the hypothesis was proposed, many studies worldwide have confirmed the initial epidemiological evidence. Although the relationship with insulin resistance is clear at all ages studied, the relation of insulin secretion is less clear. The relative contribution of genes and environment to these relationships remains a matter of debate. Other relevant observations arose from metabolism researchers who note that for practically every other species on earth, fat metabolism is well regulated and that \\"most wild animals are in fact very lean\\" and that they remain lean \\"even when adequate food is supplied.\\" Other alternative hypotheses In response to the criticisms of the original thrifty genotype theory, several new ideas have been proposed for explaining the evolutionary bases of obesity and related diseases. The \\"thrifty epigenomic hypothesis\\" is a combination of the thrifty phenotype and thrifty genotype hypotheses. While it argues that there is an ancient, canalized (genetically coded) physiological system for being \\"thrifty\\", the hypothesis argues that an individual's disease risk is primarily determined by epigenetic events. Subtle, epigenetic modifications at many genomic loci (gene regulatory networks) alter the shape of the canal in response to environmental influences and thereby establish a predisposition for complex diseases such as metabolic syndrome. There may be epigenetic inheritance of disease risk. Watve and Yajnik suggested that changing insulin resistance mediates two phenotypic transitions: a transition in reproductive strategy from \\"r\\" (large number of offspring with smaller investment in each) to \\"K\\" (smaller number of offspring with greater investment in each) (see r/K selection theory); and a switch from a lifestyle dependent upon muscular strength to one dependent on brain power (\\"soldier to diplomat\\"). Because the environmental conditions that would facilitate each transition are heavily overlapping, the scientists surmise, a common switch could have evolved for the two transitions. The main problem with this idea is the timing at which the transition is presumed to have happened, and how this would then translate into the genetic predisposition to type 2 diabetes and obesity. For example, the decline in reproductive investment in human societies (the so-called r to K shift) has occurred far too recently to have been caused by a change in genetics. Sellayah and colleagues have postulated an 'Out of Africa' theory to explain the evolutionary origins of obesity. The theory cites diverse ethnic based differences in obesity susceptibility in western civilizations to contend that, neither the thrifty or drifty gene hypotheses can explain the demographics of the modern obesity crisis. Although the arguments against these patterns arising due to 'drift' are unclear. Sellayah et al. argue that ethnic groups whose ancestors were adapted to hot climates have low metabolic rates due to lack of thermogenic capacity, whereas those groups whose ancestors were cold-adapted were endowed with greater thermogenic capacity and higher metabolic rates. Sellayah and colleagues provide evidence of thermogenic capacity, metabolic rates and obesity prevalence in various indigenous populations in support of their argument. Contrasting this analysis however a study of the spatial distribution of obesity across the mainland USA showed that once the effects of poverty and race were accounted for there was no association between ambient temperature and obesity rates. The most highly cited alternative to the thrifty gene hypothesis is the drifty gene hypothesis proposed by the British biologist John Speakman. This idea differs fundamentally from all the other ideas in that it does not propose any selective advantage for the obese state, either now or in the past. The main feature of this hypothesis is that the current pattern of obesity does not suggest that obesity has been under strong positive selection for a protracted period of time. It is argued instead that the obesity comes about because of genetic drift in the genes controlling the upper limit on our body fatness. Such drift may have started because around 2 million years ago ancestral humans effectively removed the risk from predators, which was probably a key factor selecting against fatness. The drifty gene hypothesis was presented as part of a presidential debate at the 2007 Obesity Society meeting in New Orleans, with the counter-arguments favouring the thrifty gene presented by British nutritionist Andrew Prentice. The main thrust of Prentice's argument against the drifty gene idea is that Speakman's critique of the thrifty gene hypothesis ignores the huge impact that famines have on fertility. It is argued by Prentice that famine may actually have only been a force driving evolution of thrifty genes for the past 15,000 years or so (since the invention of agriculture), but because famines exert effects on both survival and fertility the selection pressure may have been sufficient even over such a short timescale to generate a pressure for \\"thrifty\\" genes. These alternative arguments were published in two back-to-back papers in the International Journal of Obesity in November 2008. Prentice et al. predicted that the emerging molecular genetics field would ultimately provide a way to test between the adaptive 'thrifty gene' idea and the non-adaptive 'drifty gene' idea because it would be possible to find signatures of positive selection in the human genome, at genes that are linked to both obesity and type 2 diabetes, if the 'thrifty gene' hypothesis is correct. Two comprehensive studies have been performed seeking such signatures of selection. Ayub et al. (2014) searched for signatures of positive selection at 65 genes linked to type 2 diabetes, and Wang and Speakman (2016) searched for signatures of selection at 115 genes linked to obesity. In both cases there was no evidence for such selection signatures at a higher rate than in random genes selected for matched GC content and recombination rate. These two papers provide strong evidence against the thrifty gene idea, and indeed against any adaptive explanation which relies on selection during our recent evolutionary history, but rather provide strong support the 'drifty gene' interpretation.  Search for thrifty genes  Many attempts have been made to search for one or more genes contributing to thrift. Modern tools of genome wide association studies have revealed many genes with small effects associated with obesity or type 2 diabetes but all of them together explain only between 1.4 and 10% of population variance. This leaves a large gap between the pregenomic and emerging genomic estimates of heritability of obesity and Type 2 diabetes: sometimes called the 'missing heritability'. The reasons for this discrepancy are not completely understood. A likely possibility is that the missing heritability is explained by rare variants of large effect that are found only in limited populations. These would be impossible to detect by standard whole genome sequencing approaches even with hundreds of thousands of participants. The extreme endpoint of this distribution are the so-called 'monogenic' obesities where most of the impact on body weight can be tied to a mutation in a single gene that runs in a single family. The classic example of such a genetic effect is the presence of mutations in the leptin gene. An important unanswered question is whether such rare variants exist because of chance mutations, population founder events and maintenance by processes such as drift, or whether there is any selective advantage involved in their maintenance and spread. An example of such a rare variant effect was recently discovered among Samoan islanders. Among the islanders the variant is extremely common, but in other populations it is extremely rare or absent. The variant predisposes to obesity but strangely is protective against type 2 diabetes. Based on cell studies it was suggested the variant may protect individuals against periods of 'famine' and there is also evidence that it has been under positive selection. The most likely scenario then is that this rare variant was established in the islanders by a founder effect among a small initial colonising population, and was able to spread because of a selective advantage it conferred within that small group. Hence, in small populations under particular environmental conditions it may be feasible that the 'thrifty gene' idea is correct. It remains to be seen if rare variants that fill the gap in the missing heritability estimates are also 'thrifty genes' or if they are rare chance events sustained by drift, as implicated for the common variants currently linked to obesity and type 2 diabetes.

Flowers of Mesembryanthemum protect their gametes from night-time dews or frosts but open in sunlight. There is an obvious evolutionary advantage to doing this; where sun, dew, frost, wind or predators are likely to damage exposed reproductive organs, closing may be advantageous during times when flowers are unlikely to attract pollinators. It is indigenous to southern Africa. Many Mesembryanthemum species are known as ice plants because of the glistening globular bladder cells covering their stems, fruit and leaves, \\"... they sparkle like ice crystals\\". In South Africa, Mesembryanthemums are known as \\"vygies\\" (from Afrikaans \\"vy\\"), although this term refers to many plants in the family Aizoaceae. Species formerly placed in Mesembryanthemum have been transferred to other genera, such as Cleretum, Carpobrotus and Sceletium, although sources differ. Etymology Jacob Breyne coined the name of the flower in 1684, using the spelling Mesembrianthemum (\\"midday flower\\"), from the Greek roots , meaning \\"noon\\", and , meaning \\"flower\\", because the species known at his time flowered at midday. In 1719, on the discovery that some species flowered at night, Johann Jacob Dillenius changed the spelling to Mesembryanthemum (\\"flower with the pistil in the center\\"), rederiving the first part of the word from Greek (\\"middle\\") and (\\"pistil\\" or \\"embryo\\"). Carl Linnaeus used the Dillenius spelling (with the \\"y\\") in his description of the Mesembryanthemum species and the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature requires the retention of the original, deliberate spelling.Oxford English Dictionary Online, s.v. ‚ÄúMesembryanthemum, n.‚Äù (accessed June 24, 2008). Uses Mesembryanthemums are often cultivated as ornamental plants for their showy flowers. Ornamental plants may escape into the wild and consequently has become widely naturalized outside their native range. They are considered an invasive weed in certain places. Culture and society Some Mesembryanthemum species are thought to be hallucinogenic plants, like related Aizoaceae,Watt, John Mitchell; Breyer-Brandwijk, Maria Gerdina: The Medicinal and Poisonous Plants of Southern and Eastern Africa 2nd ed Pub.

He is the former non-executive Chairman of Allied Domecq and the ex-Chairman/chief executive of Granada. Early life The ninth of 10 children born to Anthony and Elizabeth Robinson, an Irish father and a Scottish mother, Robinson moved with his family to England from County Donegal in his early teens. He briefly trained to become a Catholic priest at St. Mary's Seminary of the Holy Ghost Fathers at Castlehead, Grange-over-Sands, Lancashire. He began a career in accounting in 1965 as a clerk with the Matchbox Toys company. While with the firm, he progressed through various accounting roles to become Chief Management Accountant in 1974. He also, during that time, qualified as an Associate Chartered Management Accountant. Career In 1974, he left Matchbox to work for Lex Vehicle Leasing as a management accountant. He then rose through the company before being appointed finance director. In 1980, he joined the UK franchise of Coca-Cola, owned at that time by Grand Metropolitan. In 1983 he was appointed managing director of Grand Metropolitan's international services division. In 1987 he led the successful ¬£163m management buyout of the loss-making contract services and catering division of Compass Group, known as Compass Caterers. He joined Granada as CEO in 1991, and soon ousted Granada's chairman, David Plowright in 1992, which led John Cleese to call Robinson \\"an upstart caterer \\". Robinson steered the company through various mergers, and hostile takeovers including London Weekend Television (1993) and Forte Group (1996). In 1999 Robinson was the subject of a biography, Lord of the Dance, written by business journalist William Kay, and published by Orion Business Books . In 2005 he made an unsuccessful attempt to oust Doug Flynn as CEO of Rentokil Initial and install himself as Executive chairman for a 5% stake in the company, then valued at ¬£56M. Television Robinson's first foray into broadcasting was a revival of the BBC's Troubleshooter show, originally fronted by Sir John Harvey-Jones in the early 1990s. Titled I'll Show Them Who's Boss and co-produced by the Open University, in 2004 he went into struggling businesses to try to turn them round by advice and mentoring. In January 2007 following a similar format, he presented a three-part series, Can Gerry Robinson Fix the NHS? as he attempted to reduce waiting lists at Rotherham General Hospital. He returned a year later for a sequel, Can Gerry Robinson Fix the NHS? One Year On. In December 2009, Robinson presented a programme in a similar format entitled Can Gerry Robinson Fix Dementia Care Homes?. In June 2009 he presented a special edition of The Money Programme entitled Gerry Robinson's Car Crash investigating the history and future of the British motor industry. He regularly appears on British TV as a celebrity businessman.IMDb bio In July 2009 he started a TV series called Gerry's Big Decision, in which he reviews struggling companies and decides whether it is worth investing his own money to save them. From 14 January ‚Äì 18 February 2011 he presented BBC2 show Can't Take It with You, which helps people to write their wills. Other affiliations Robinson also served as chairman of the Arts Council England for six years from 1998, in which capacity he was one of the many victims of a spoof by British comedian Ali G.Gerry Robinson official website Personal life Robinson has divorced and remarried and has four children. He lives in Raphoe,Co Donegal http://www.oakfieldpark.com/ Oakfield Park ; he established a botanical garden with a narrow gauge railway ‚Äì the Difflin Lake Railway ‚Äì which is open to the public. Politics Although originally a Conservative Party supporter, he supported Tony Blair and starred in a Labour Party election broadcast, saying that \\"... frankly, there's only one party that can represent Britain best, getting business right, and that's New Labour\\". In June 2008, Robinson was one of four Labour donors who expressed their concerns with Gordon Brown's leadership and stated he would not be contributing any more money to the Labour Party until there was a change of leader. He had donated some ¬£70,000 to the party between 2001 and 2005. Honours He was knighted in the 2004 New Year Honours List.
