Biography Schofield was born and raised in Passaic County, New Jersey and began playing in several New York City hardcore bands at a young age, leading to the nickname, Youth. He debuted with Agnostic Front in 1983 but did not play on any recordings. Youth also played for New York City act Warzone until around 1986. He joined Murphy's Law (another New York City band) that year, recording on various works with them, including three full-length albums. Youth performed with Murphy's Law until 1995. After leaving Murphy's Law, he recorded a single with a band named The Homewreckers in 1996. Around this time Youth evolved his style from hardcore to implementing some of his 1970s punk influences, such as New York Dolls, Dead Boys and The Heartbreakers, thus he joined famous New York City glam punk band D Generation, replacing Richard Bacchus on guitar. He was with D Generation from 1996 to 1998 and recorded on their album Through The Darkness, and Youth co- wrote the track \\"Sunday Secret Saints\\" with Jesse Malin. Chrome Locust was formed by Youth, D Generation drummer Michael Wildwood, and V√°squez bassist Jim Heneghan in 1998. On May 25, 1999 Chrome Locust released a self-titled album on Tee Pee Records. The cover art was reminiscent of The Age Of Quarrel by Cro-Mags. In a late interview, Youth stated that The Age Of Quarrel by Cro- Mags was one of the best hardcore records ever released. Youth disbanded Chrome Locust in order to audition for Danzig, despite having a potential offer to tour with The Hellacopters. Youth was also contacted to audition for Foo Fighters during this period. He stated that his decision to audition for Danzig, instead of Foo Fighters, had to do with having more fun on tour and the chance to work with Joey Castillo, who was also from the hardcore punk rock scene, having played with Wasted Youth. =Playing with Danzig and Samhain= During the summer of 1999, he successfully auditioned for Danzig; he joined as the guitarist. Coincidentally, former D Generation bandmate, bassist Howie Pyro, joined Danzig soon after. The same year Glenn Danzig had reformed his horror punk band Samhain, guitarist Damien decided not to join the band for their reunion tour, thus Todd was asked to replace him. Youth only had three months to practice and learn the Samhain and Danzig sets. Although not an original member of Samhain, fans welcomed him to the lineup, some even mistaking him for Damien. The band AFI had toured with Samhain during 1999, and their frontman Davey Havok was a longtime fan, so in 2000 Youth, along with Samhain members London May and Steve Zing masterminded horror punk band Son of Sam,. This featured Davey Havok on vocals and on their album Songs from the Earth with guest appearances from Glenn Danzig. With Danzig, Youth recorded the studio album, I Luciferi, released in 2002, which featured Glenn Danzig, Howie Pyro and future Queens of the Stone Age drummer Joey Castillo. Todd's guitar work was also included on the live album, Live on the Black Hand Side, released in 2001 and the compilation record, The Lost Tracks of Danzig, released in 2007. Youth left the group in 2003 but kept in contact with Glenn Danzig through the years. He rejoined Danzig in 2007 for the Halloween Tour. He left Danzig again, to join Glen Campbell's band. Youth stated that his father, who also was a musician, was overjoyed to hear about his opportunity with Campbell, which he considered to be Todd's big break in the music business. =Recent times= Youth also played with Mot√∂rhead in May 2003, filling in for three dates on Mot√∂rhead's tour of the United States, as Phil Campbell's mother had died and he was unable to continue on tour. Youth led Los Angeles rockers The Chelsea Smiles, which in some ways marked a return to the style of music Youth played with D Generation, with the band implementing similar influences, such as The Stooges, New York Dolls, MC5 and Chuck Berry. They released their debut EP Nowhere Ride in 2005. The debut full-length Chelsea Smiles album Thirty Six Hours Later was released in November 2006, and its European release date was early December of the same year. The Chelsea Smiles were invited by Social Distortion to open for them in 2006. The Chelsea Smiles later toured Europe in 2007. In 2008, Youth reformed the band, Son of Sam, but Davey Havok did not return on vocals. As with the first Son of Sam release, all of the music was written by Youth. 2008 and 2009 also saw Youth joining singer Glen Campbell's band. Youth recorded three songs on Glen's comeback record Meet Glen Campbell. Youth did various TV show appearances (Jimmy Kimmel, The Tonight Show) and toured the UK in support of the release. In 2009, the Chelsea Smiles released a new, self-titled release. The band undertook a short UK tour with horror punk artist Wednesday 13, in support of the release. At the end of 2009, the Chelsea Smiles decided the end had come for the band and changed the name to the Royal Highness. Youth began writing with Wednesday 13 with plans to record an album under the band name Gunfire 76. The band had more of a rock sound than Wednesday 13. Youth joined Cheap Trick performing the \\"Sgt. Pepper Live\\" show at the Las Vegas Hilton in September 2009. He appeared on Cheap Trick's album, The Latest with the blessing of guitarist, Rick Nielsen. During an interview, Youth recalled Nielsen calling him a member of the New Jersey Dolls, as a reference to his former band, D Generation. In January 2010 Youth was announced as the second guitarist with Michael Monroe during a press conference held in Los Angeles. The band also featured Sam Yaffa on bass, guitarist, Ginger, from The Wildhearts, and Jimmy Clarke on drums. Youth's tenure with Michael Monroe was cut short due to issues with band management as well as an offer to audition and tour with his childhood hero, Ace Frehley. Youth did not confirm that he had left Monroe's band until the end of March, 2010. By the end of March of 2010, Youth was confirmed as the permanent touring guitarist with ex-Kiss guitarist Ace Frehley. Youth stated that Ace didn't require rehearsal before performing in concert, quoting Ace as saying, \\"Eh, you know the songs, right?\\" Youth fit in well with Ace's band and often took center stage to sing the classic Kiss song, \\"Flaming Youth.\\" He was also featured with the rest of the band in the photos section of Frehley's book, No Regrets. Youth worked with Frehley for roughly four years. At the end of 2010, Youth toured with Jesse Malin and the St. Mark's Social. In 2010, the first single \\"American Dream\\" was released on One Voice by Capricorn, a band formed by Youth, Phil Caivano (of Monster Magnet) and Karl Rosqvist (of The Chelsea Smiles and Michael Monroe). Youth played several shows as the lead guitarist for The Joneses in 2015 and by 2017 he returned to his hardcore roots when joining hardcore punk supergroup, Bloodclot. On July, 14 2017, Bloodclot released a record entitled Up in Arms. Along with Youth, the band also featured vocalist John Joseph (Cro-Mags), Nick Oliveri (Dwarves) and Joey Castillo (Danzig). The band toured with Negative Approach in the US and planned on touring the UK in 2018, but split up before doing so. Youth cited differences in opinion regarding band matters with Joseph. On August 18, 2017, Youth played his first show with his new band Fireburn. A hardcore punk band that features Israel Joseph I (formerly of Bad Brains), Nick Townsend (currently/formerly of Deadbeat, Knife Fight), and Todd Jones (currently/formerly of Nails, Terror). They released their first EP on Closed Casket Actvites titled Don't Stop the Youth. On October 1, 2017, Youth held a tribute to his former Warzone bandmate, Raymond Barbieri AKA Raybeez, on the 20th anniversary of his death, at Tompkins Square Park in NYC. Many hardcore contemporaries took part in this tribute alongside Youth. =Death= On October 27, 2018, Todd Youth died at the age of 47. A memorial was held for Youth in California on November 4, 2018 at the Velvet Margarita Cantina and another was held in New York at Niagra (formerly A7) on November 8, 2018. The memorials featured musicians and friends from the hardcore scene and bands he had worked with, playing and speaking in his honor. HR and Dr. Know from Youth's favorite band, Bad Brains, performed at the New York memorial. Some of Youth's ashes were placed by his daughters at the Hare Krishna Tree in Tompkins Square Park on the night of the New York memorial. The remaining ashes were spread, per his wishes, in the holy Yamuna River in India by his daughters on November 16, 2018. Youth, a follower of the Hare Krishna movement, also went by the spiritual name, Tarun Krishna Das.

It has smooth pale brown and greyish bark, narrow lance-shaped to elliptical adult leaves, flower buds arranged in groups of between seven and eleven with an elongated operculum, and cup-shaped to barrel-shaped fruit.flower budsfruit Description Eucalyptus eremophila is a mallet, sometimes a shrub or a tree, that typically grows to a height of and a width of but does not form a lignotuber. It has smooth, polished pale brown to greyish bark that is shed in late summer. Young plants and coppice regrowth have glossy green, lance-shaped to oblong leaves long, wide and arranged alternately. Adult leaves are narrow lance-shaped to elliptical, long, long on a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged in leaf axils in groups of seven, nine or eleven on a flattened, unbranched peduncle long, the individual buds on a pedicel long. Mature buds are long, wide, curved spindle-shaped with an elongated, horn-shaped operculum. Flowering occurs from August to December and the flowers are lemon yellow, sometimes pale pink. The fruit is a woody, cup- shaped to barrel-shaped capsule, long, wide on a downturned pedicel, with the valve tips at rim level. Taxonomy and naming The sand mallet was first formally described in 1904 by Ludwig Diels from material collected near Boorabbin in the Coolgardie district by Ernst Georg Pritzel. Diels gave it the name Eucalyptus occidentalis var. eremophila and published the description in the journal Botanische Jahrb√ºcher f√ºr Systematik, Pflanzengeschichte und Pflanzengeographie. In the same journal, Adolf Engler published the first formal description of E. occidentalis. In 1920, Joseph Maiden raised the variety to species status as E. eremophila. Two subspecies of E. eremophila are accepted by the Australian Plant Census: * Eucalyptus eremophila (Diels) Maiden subsp. eremophila; * Eucalyptus eremophila subsp. pterocarpa (Blakely & H.Steedman) L.A.S.Johnson & Blaxell. The specific epithet (eremophila) is derived from the Greek eremi- meaning \\"desert\\" and philos 'lover'. The eucalypt is associated with the western mallee subgroup which is characterised by several eucalypts, including E. oleosa, E. moderata, E. incrassata, E. foecunda, E. redunca and E. uncinata. The understorey is predominantly shrubby with species of Melaleuca and Acacia along with the occasional Triodia. Distribution and habitat Eucalyptus eremophila is found on undulating plains, hills and sand dunes in the Wheatbelt and Goldfields-Esperance region of Western Australia where it grows in skeletal sandy soils over granite. It is found as far north west as Quairading in the central Wheatbelt to the western edge of the Nullarbor Plain in the south east. Conservation status Sand mallet is classified as \\"not threatened\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife. Use in horticulture This plant is sold commercially in the form of seed or tube stock as an ornamental plant but is also used as an erosion control, windbreak or shade plant for wide verges, nature strips or parks and reserves. It prefers a full sun position and is regarded as quite hardy being drought tolerant and able to withstand a moderate frost. It grows in neutral to acid soils and can be grown in coastal areas. It is also a good habitat for birds and attracts them with its nectar. The seeds germinate readily. See also *List of Eucalyptus species References Further reading * Holliday, I.

The community was earlier known as Chandala or Chandal, a term usually considered as a slur. They were traditionally engaged in cultivation and as boatmen. They lived outside the four-tier ritual varna system and thus were outcastes.  Etymology  There is a dearth of discussion as to the etymology of the word namasudra in pre- nineteenth-century Bengali literature and its period of origin is also undetermined. Several theories have been suggested but there is no broad consensus supporting any of them. Sekhar Bandyopadhyay agrees with a namasudra commentator that namasudra probably means \\"best among the Sudras, who were paid obeisance to\\".  Origins  The Namasudra community was earlier known as Chandala or Chandal, a term usually considered as a slur. They lived outside the four-tier ritual varna system and thus were outcastes and untouchables in the eyes of the Hindu community. The community was traditionally engaged in fishing and as boatmen, in the marshy swamps of their native lands. Over the years, as the wetlands were reclaimed for agricultural purposes, they turned to peasant agriculture as a major occupation. Their economic condition was quite poor and rates of indebtedness quite high. = Colonial ethnography = Colonial ethnographers such as Herbert Hope Risley believed that the Chandals of their time were related to a tribe of the same name that existed in the Vedic Period. However, modern research disputes their opinion for a variety of reasons, including that the main habitat of the modern community in Eastern Bengal was largely outside the core region of Brahmanical civilisation, that regional texts did not refer to them as untouchables and indeed nor was untouchability rigidly practiced in Bengal. Furthermore, the modern community does not occupy the extreme lowest tier of the society, unlike the historical tribe, and their social status varied widely from region to region, especially with regard to their material wealth. The more modern community comprises around twelve endogamous sub-castes, most of whom were derived from the occupational traits of the members and was entitled to differential social- status. But the colonial ethnographers choose to coalesce several such low- ranking occupational sub-castes into one caste, without taking the regional variations into account and assigned a fixed social rank to of all Namasudra- Chandals, (something which Bernard Cohn later described as the \\"objectification\\" of colonial culture) and falsely stereotyped the entire community as universally despised. Overall, the term Chandal was a generic term that was initially used to refer to broad groups of people belonging to diverse endogamous communities of similarly despised social position but which later transformed into a caste name and was soon synomously used with the Namasudras. = Other views = Niharranjan Ray, a historian, believed that they have a closer relation with north Indian Brahmins, saying \\"they are of the same line as the Brahmans of north India; indeed there is a closer relation between the north Indian Brahmans and the Bengali Namah≈õ≈´dras than between the north Indian Brahmans and the Bengali Brahmans, Kayasthas and Vaidyas.\\"  Identity movement  = Transition to Namasudras = The creation of a single caste-cluster led to the beginning of the Namasudra Movement. It emphasised the commonality of low social status and that of being subject to oppression, among all the sub-castes and impressed upon them to stand up to the social authority of the high caste bhadraloks, a perceived common enemy, who were largely responsible for their poor conditions. Libertarian social influences that were prevalent in the region across the eighteenth and nineteenth century are believed to have imparted a major impetus to the Namasudras, against social oppression. Islam followed by Christianity (which was widely prevalent in the Namasudra-belts, courtesy the missionaries) was majorly responsible for granting them a newer dimension of self-respect. The non-orthodox variants of the Bhakti movement, that aligned with the Sahajiya tradition and sought to encompass the downtrodden sections into the society, also catalysed the Namasudras, as a guiding faith. Various local socio-religious figureheads (Kalachand Vidyalankar, Sahlal Pir, Keshab Pagal et al.), who sought to repudiate the caste system, further impressed upon large sections of the Namasudra population. The Namasudras, thus, successfully strived to carve out an autonomous niche in the social fabric of Bengal, where the distinction of caste was obliterated but that none from the Hindu bhadralok community did identify themselves with those sects, they were branded as exotic and subsequently came to be rejected by other sections of the society. In the 1870s, the Chandals of Bakarganj and Faridpur started a boycott of caste Hindus, (apart from Brahmins), as a form of social-protest, when their higher caste neighbors refused to accept an invitation to dine from a Chandal headman. They passed a resolution that also called for prohibition against default-employment of Chandals in menial duties in state-jails and together, the call for boycott was spread in the name of an order from the government. Further that, any Chandal who did not abide by it was threatened with intra-community ostracism, the movement gained huge support across a wide region. This first rebellion in the community in a bid to redefine the local power structure failed to garner much because the poorer Chandals had to return to their previous employers after a few months, often agreeing to more harrowing work conditions. The social discrimination continued. Joya Chatterjee says that henceforth they \\"battled continuously to improve their ritual position\\" in society and later claimed the \\"more respectable title of 'Namasudra' and Brahmin status\\". It was within this context, that they underwent a transition from the Chandala to Namasudra identity. In 1891, the term Namasudras was recorded in the official census as a synonym for the Chandala(s) and by 1900, it had assumed immense social recognition, as people of the community clung to the new identity and tried to distance themselves from the imagery of the Chandals. In the very-initial stages, the elimination of differences across various sub-castes and the creation of lateral solidarity was one of the primary goals of the movement. Gradually, by the late nineteenth century, they came to constitute an organised middle peasantry community, with definite leaders and goals. These movements helped them seek upward mobility by infusing a sense of self-respect. They gradually demanded elevated social status, including a right of entry to Kayastha-organised pujas and a two-thirds share of the crops grown. They began to refuse to work for lower-caste Hindu and Muslim landlords and also boycotted the upper caste Hindus. Overall, Sekhara Bandyopadhyay has noted a distinct theme of sanskritisation in the dynamics of the caste. Meanwhile, the Matua sect, which was established by Harichand Thakur in the late nineteenth century among the community in the eastern India (and later organised by his son) played a major role in bringing cohesion to the Namasudra community, in terms of faith. Born to a devout Vaishnava family, he gained initial reputation as a spiritual healer and later claimed to be a reincarnation of God, with a duty to ensure salvation of the downtrodden. A cult was gradually developed, which opposed the idea of social hierarchy along with several other Hindu religio-cultural aspects (Gurubad, mantras, idol-worship etc.) and the spiritual aspects of Vedanta philosophy. Instead, a theme of social equality denouncing untouchability and gender discrimination was put forward. The devotional songs, that were sung in form of Kirtans and namgaan, also helped to collectively reinforce a common congregational identity among themselves. Whilst the sect did play an important role in organising and propagating the social protests, the efforts to entirely subvert the Hindu society failed and the broader community soon returned to the theme of sanskritisation, whilst still ascribing to the other ideals of the sect.  Freedom movement  In colonial Bengal, the Namasudras constituted the second largest Hindu caste. Their interests differed from those pursuing nationalist politics against the British Raj from the time of the Swadeshi period (1905‚Äì11) and thus they did not participate much in that movement. That it was heralded by politicians from the high-caste bhadralok community, who cared little for the lower classes, further broadened the gaps. In July 1905, the British government validated a proposal for partitioning Bengal along religious lines. Whilst the Congress protested this and asked for a total boycott of foreign goods, the Namasudras thought differently. A series of resolutions by community leaders and multiple submissions to British authorities during 1906 affirmed their complete support for the partition scheme, through which they hoped to obtain equal rights in the proposed eastern state where they, along with Muslims, dominated the populace. It was on this issue that the bhadralok politicians of Bengal faced the first resistance from a community previously insignificant in the broader polity of the nation. Swadeshi leaders reacted by touring extensively in the Namasudra areas, trying to persuade them to join the agitation and, if that failed, bribing, intimidating and coercing them by such means as constructing schools. But the community leaders, including Guruchand, were steadfast against supporting a political movement that supposedly catered to the interests of the upper class and had no plan of social reform. The colonial government often provided extensive economic patronage and took steps in reforming their social condition by constructing educational hostels, exclusive-schools et al. which penetrated deep down the community. This was in contrary to the nationalists who were too apathetic to these causes and seldom helped them, in their times of distress. The Namasudras thus rejected the nationalist politics and instead, along with other untouchable castes continued their independent social movement that increasingly self-asserted their independence from the upper castes and threatened to distort the Hindu- societal-structure. Subsequently, the nationalists sought to align themselves, at-least orally, with the cause of depressed classes. Post-arrival of Gandhi in the political landscape, as nationalist politics choose to encompass the entire populace of the nation and gradually transcended into mass-movements, parties started extensive lobbying for the causes of the Namasudra. This was first visible in 1913, as to the setting up a hostel for the students from Namasudra community in Kolkata, who faced immense hardship in securing lodging facilities. Ironically, whilst it was the extensive nationalist lobbying throughout the years that persuaded the colonial government to implement the proposal in 1918, the colonial government took advantage of the ignorance of the general masses as to the proceedings that happened behind the door and usurped an image of benevolence. This further drifted the community away from nationalist causes. The same events happened in another case, when the Depressed Classes Mission, (which worked for nationalist causes) and ran about 60 schools in different parts of Bengal, for the Namasudra community and other backward classes was gradually inculcated as an agency of the colonial government, after it applied for a government grant to overcome fund shortage. The Namasudra community was unaware of these institutional developments and all the good work that was done by the Mission, was attributed to the colonial government. The Namsudras maintained a more aggressive anti-nationalist stance during the Home-rule Movement. They saw the movement as a plan, hatched among the upper-caste leaders, to snatch the minimal levels of power that has been assigned to them by the colonial government and claimed the Congress leaders to be a small band of vociferous people from organised castes, without any touch to reality. A meeting of Namasudra delegates, who were supposedly elected, in a democratic manner from different regions of Bengal, passed a resolution that the community would be loyal to the crown and that it supported Montague-Chelmsford reforms, in the sense that further distribution of powers would re-concentrate power in a few hands and would not lead to any progress for the backward castes. The nationalists promised the establishment of equality, democracy and reforms in the new home-ruled-state but failed to instill any confidence within the community. At the 1917 session of Congress, a resolution was passed that emphasised the necessity, justice and righteousness of removing all disabilities imposed by custom on the Depressed Classes. One Namasudra delegate was convinced to support the demand for Home- Rule but the community generally was not swayed by mere symbolic actions and the delegate was subsequently criticised as a Congress stooge. Even in the 1920s when mass-nationalism affected the entire country and Gandhi extensively campaigned to include the lower strata of society in the Congress fold, Namasudra-dominated districts were mostly unaffected. The leaders of the movement steadfastly rejected whiffs of nationalism, which they believed to be another tool designed for the interests of wealthy upper-caste Bhadraloks. Resolutions were again passed that supported the British confederacy and in some places the Namasudras actively helped the colonial government to foil Congress. The colonial government further satisfied the community, as it introduced reservation(s) for the lower-classes in provincial services, thus providing employment opportunities and vouched for a proper representation of them. The Government of India Act of 1919 provided for the inclusion of a depressed classes representative among the nominated non-official members of the Bengal Legislative Council. Meanwhile, Congress hardly invested any ground efforts, other than at verbal lobbying and behind-the-scenes work and much of their work were horribly ill-timed. In the Khulna famine of 1920, whilst the colonial government sought to mobilize relief, the Congress went on to continue the Non-cooperation at full zeal and was blamed for increasing the fatalities. The Bengal Namasudra Conference in 1922 and 1923 further heightened the anti-nationalist stance and planned a definite agenda that encompassed both social and political upliftment of the community. Whilst, Gandhi attracted some admirers due to his social stances, his views offered no political aspirations for the leaders, which were an easy way to status and wealth. There was a considerable majority in the first conference that supported the nationalist causes including widow-remarriage and boycott of foreign goods, managing to bring the proceedings to a halt but had trickled down to a negligible minority, in the second. But, as the elections took place in 1923, the Namasudra leadership was found to be much less efficient as to mobilizing the average voters to partake in modern-day-politics. Subsequently, they lost all the seats, even in the electorates where the Namasudras heavily dominated the numbers. This was also attributed to the developments of fissures in the movement, that was extremely united thus far, when two famed Namasudra leaders switched loyalties to the Swaraj Party and a division began to form along nationalist lines. The steadfast attitude towards nationalism, throughout the years, that owed more to the need of a voice of protest against the oppressive higher castes than to the benefits provided by the British government, was crumbling down gradually and fissures were beginning to develop. The Hindu solidarity soon followed in realizing that the alienation of lower-castes might hamper its plans of offering a united opposition against the British and the Muslims, as conversions became abundant and threatened to dwindle the numbers of Hindus. Subsequently, the All India Hindu Mahasabha, Bharat Sevasram Sangha et al. actively started to mobilise the lower-caste people. In the late 1930s, especially after the Poona Pact, the Namasudras of Bengal Presidency increasingly adhered to a loyalist stance to the British Government, which was supposedly its best chance to upgrade their socio- economic condition and all throughout and they consistently remained alienated from the nationalist politics. Overall, numerous measures were taken over the course of years to alleviate the concerns of the community and to ensure that they were gradually inculcated into the nationalist political-fabric of the nation. Un-touch-ability was propounded as a vice and there were campaigns for providing them with better social rights. The Congress also contributed to these causes via their political programs, largely for the same goals. The Dalit of Bengal, thus became intrinsically involved in the Partition movement, and the Namsudras along with Rajbanshis became the two groups that majorly dominated Dalit politics in the province. According to Bandyopadhyay, the aim of the Hindu campaign, throughout the years, was to merely induce the lower castes record themselves as Hindus, which would inflate their numbers and thus, assist them in the redistribution of provinces during partition of the nation rather than to harvest a social reform. The main aim was to agglomerate the lower castes in the fold of Hindus and unitedly fight against the Muslim and the British. It propagandised the local peasant-rebellions between Namasudras and Muslim community across Dacca et al. with religious colors thereby increasing communal tensions and prospects of partition. In some places, the Namasudras even sided with Muslims against the socio-economic oppression of Hindu zamindars but it was again branded as a communal riot. The Bengal Congress also contributed to the cause. Nonetheless, the organised efforts to articulate the Hindu identity somewhat worked and some of the riots did have a religious flavor. Gradually, whilst many leaders of the caste- movement increasingly associated with the Hindu narrative, and many Namasudras associated with the views of the Hindu solidarity, there was still a lack of consensus among the masses. In fact, there was a strong discontent among Namasudras that they have been supposedly cheated by the enumerators of the 1941 census where they were recorded as Hindus instead of mere Namasudras. But, by 1947, a majority of Namasudras actively associated them with the Hindus and that the partition was inevitable, their primary aim was to keep their habitat- the districts of Bakarganj, Faridpur, Jessore and Khulna within the Hindu majority province of West Bengal. But they managed to maintain a separate caste identity throughout. Ultimately, the efforts of the campaign failed to achieve much of its desired goal because districts that were mostly inhabited by Namasudras went to East Bengal despite vehement protestations by them. Overall, whilst these attempts at altering the social situation improved things to some extent, discrimination was still markedly abundant and the domination by upper castes continued even post-independence.  Post- independence  = Migration to India = Whilst an assemblage of relatively well-off Namasudras immediately migrated to India, using their resources of property, the poorer community members stayed. Sekhar Bandyopadhyay notes that despite Jinnah's promise of equality for all, they were soon subjected to \\"a process of 'Othering'\\" as the state sought for \\"greater Islamisation of the polity\\" and that the upper-caste-Hindus had almost all left East Bengal, the communal agitation was now solely directed against the lower-caste and untouchable Hindus. An acute economic crisis in some districts, coinciding with a labour-surplus market and the Muslim landlords preferring to employ coreligionists, was another mitigating factor. All these, coupled with numerous provocations ranging from unlawful occupation of land to public humiliation of women and direct instruction to leave the country, led to a build-up of insecurity among the Namasudras. From around January 1950, the Namasudra peasants decided to migrate to India in large numbers and this continued until 1956, with about 10,000 refugees entering every month. Retaliatory communal violence across both sides of the border also contributed to the cause. There was again a mass migration after the Hazratbal riot in 1964. A police intelligence report in June 1952 reported that \\"About 95 per cent of the refugees are Namasudras\\". = Condition in India = Whilst most of the Namasudra refugees who arrived after 1950, were automatically designated as cultivators without any means for survival and were thus dispatched to official refugee camps, some did independently settle across villages in Nadia, Basirhat et al. The latter were often involved in violent fracases with the local Muslims and cross-border communal rivalries, in search of land and livestock, were reported too. That they had to also contend with the local Hindu upper castes, made the situation worse. Those who were dispatched to the refugee camps spend months in imposed idleness whilst being rewarded with a meager cash dole and weekly ration. They were restricted from going out of the camps, look for jobs or interact with the local population, who were often deeply suspicious of the refugees. Thereafter, they started mobilizing themselves under the umbrage of Bastuhara Samitis (refugee associations) and other leaders like Ramendra Kishor Mullick, who claimed to be close to P. R. Thakur and Manohar Roy, who claimed himself to be a right- hand man of Jogen Mandal to protest against the camp administration in a variety of forms. Finally, the government, in early 1956 announced the Dandakaranya Scheme of rehabilitating them in a region consisting of 78,000 square miles of inhospitable unirrigated land in the tribal areas of Orissa and Madhya Pradesh. The scheme was compulsory, pending which the refugee camps were to be closed down. Some were also rehabilitated to neighboring provinces of Assam, Bihar, Orissa and the Andaman Islands. The schemes were heavily protested and in March‚ÄìApril 1958, umbrella-refugee-organisations (United Central Refugee Council (UCRC) and the Sara Bangla Bastuhara Samiti (SBBS)) organised satyagraha campaigns, with political patronage, that lasted for about a month and resulted in the arrests of 30,000 refugees. Most were camp- refugees and 70 percent of them were Namasudras. Gradually, the campaign, as to an acceptable solution of the refugee issues began to lose momentum as the organisations were more interested in exploiting the refugee-base, as an exercise in electoral constituency building for the political parties. By 1965, 7,500 refugee families were forcibly settled there and because of their dispersal, the Namasudras, who were till-then a closely knit community, as to local-geography, lost their capacity to organise powerful protest movements. The conditions across Dandakaranya camps were extremely poor and that the refugees not only failed to integrate with the native Adivasis but also had to deal with a corrupt government mechanism made survival more difficult. Bandyopadhyay has noted that throughout the times, the Namasudras whilst existing in the refugee camps, did not articulate their caste identity; they along with all others shared the common tag of refugees. And that this led a large section of the Dalit community to lose their distinctive and autonomous political voice. But, nevertheless some means (following different rituals et al.) were adopted by them to distinguish from other castes and maintain a conscious identity of their original identity.  Thakurnagar  A prominent Namasudra leader, Pramatha Ranjan Thakur, who was once elected to the Constituent Assembly with Congress support and opposed reservation for the Scheduled Castes whilst advocating drastic social reforms, emerged as a political and spiritual figure-head during the refugee crisis. He was the guru of the Matua Mahasangha (MM), which his great-grandfather had established, and thus had a huge following among the Namasudras. In December 1947, he purchased a piece of land in North 24-Parganas, about from Kolkata, between Chandpara and Gobordanga, and started a venture for purposes of refugee rehabilitation. This led to the establishment of Thakurnagar, the first Dalit-refugee colony in India started by Dalits themselves. The locality grew in size and within the next ten years, more than 50,000 Dalit refugees, mostly Namasudras, had settled in what became a major cultural centre for them.  Marichjhapi massacre  The Congress government of West Bengal during the refugee crisis was widely perceived as anti-refugee because of its position regarding rehabilitation. The Communist Party of India (Marxist) (CPI(M)), as the main opposition party, opposed the government's dispersal policy and demanded rehabilitation of refugees in the uninhabited islands of Sunderban, thus gaining a following among the Namasudra refugees. In 1977, as CPI(M) became the governing party, almost 150,000 refugees returned to West Bengal from Dandakaranya. By now, the economy was in a poor state and the CPIM arranged deportation of many of them back to Dandakaranya. However, a group of about 30,000 refugees managed to infiltrate the Sunderbans and establish a settlement at Marichjhapi, which included such things as schools, health centres, and fishing industries. The government declared the establishment to be illegal, as a contravention of the prohibitions on permanent settlement in the Forest Acts, and asked them to abandon the settlement to protect the ecological diversity of the region. As the persuasion failed to convince them, beginning 26 January 1979, the local police, on the behest of the government, undertook drastic measures which included razing the dwellings of the islanders, destroying fisheries, tube-wells et al. and complete-blockading of the island. despite considerable criticism from the press and a restraining order from the High Court. Boats of escaping refugees were sunk, and mass- firings were also reported, which led to numerous casualties over the course of next few days. Finally, as the efforts by the local-police-machinery failed to address the issue in its entirety, the Government ordered a forcible evacuation of the refugees in a 48-hour span from 14 May 1979 to 16 May 1979, in what was called the Marichjhapi Massacre by the scholarly community. Several hundred refugees died in numerous police-firings whilst many more perished as a result of starvation, exhaustion et al. Usage of mercenaries and mass-rapes were also reported. No criminal charges were laid against anyone and the Scheduled Castes and Tribes Commission, in its annual report denied the happening of any atrocity on the Untouchables in Bengal.  Modern day politics and status  MM has transformed itself into a major socio- religious organisation and has one of its major aims as to mobilization of the dispersed Namasudra community and to convert Thakurnagar into a new cultural and spiritual hub for a Namasudra renaissance. In 2010, it claimed to have nearly 50 million members, belonging to 100 to 120 thousand families. On the occasion of baruni mela ‚Äì the major festival of the sect ‚Äì lakhs of devotees from all over India were reported to visit Thakurnagar, in the sort of an annual pilgrimage. The members of the community have been reported to have fared quite well, post 1980 but despite their educational and social progress, the class remained politically marginal for a long span of time but have often actively negotiated with mainstream political parties for political empowerment. Beginning the utilization of the network of the MMS, by All India Trinamool Congress, (which included nominating family members of PR Thakur as MLAs), the group managed to establish an independent identity in politics. TMC did succeed in consolidating Matua votes in its favor in the 2011 state- elections and the consolidation has been attributed to be a cause behind its decisive victory in the South Bengal seats. The BJP is attempting to use the Namasudra community to increase their voter base in West Bengal.

Some instances became national and international news stories, where people have stolen a garden gnome from a garden, and then sent the owner photos of the gnome for a period of time as a practical joke, before returning it. The Garden Gnome Liberation Front in France is a community that considers gnoming to be stealing garden gnomes from other people's property, without the intention of returning them, as part of their purported mission to \\"free\\" gnomes and \\"return them to the wild\\", which has sometimes led to criminal charges, jail time, or fines. Origins The concept of the travelling gnome dates back to the 1970s when Henry Sunderland photographed his own garden gnomes, which he named Harry and Charlie, while he was travelling around Antarctica. The earliest record of a prank involving a traveling gnome is from Australia in 1986 when the Sydney Morning Herald reported an \\"Eastern Suburbs gnome-owner was distressed when she discovered her gnome had been stolen at the weekend. A note was found in its place: 'Dear mum, couldn't stand the solitude any longer. Gone off to see the world. Don't be worried, I'll be back soon. Love Bilbo xxx.'\\" Travelling gnome prank A running prank has developed, which has made national news at times, where people steal a garden gnome from an unknowing person's lawn and then send the owner photos of the gnome and sometimes cryptic messages that were supposedly written by the gnome for a time as a practical joke before returning it. The most well-known instance of the travelling gnome prank was arguably in 2005 when a group of college students took a garden gnome, dubbed \\"Gnome Severson\\" in news, from a property in Redmond, Washington, U.S. and brought it on a roadtrip to California and Nevada. Gnome Severson became a national news story after the group ran into socialite Paris Hilton at a gas station, who posed for a picture with the gnome that was printed in People magazine. At the end of the week-long trip, the friends anonymously returned the gnome to its owner's front porch with a photo album titled \\"Gnome‚Äôs Spring Break 2005\\", which included the issue of People and other pictures of the gnome around Hollywood, San Francisco, and Las Vegas. The owner, who had not even noticed the gnome was missing until she found it returned on her porch, was interviewed on Good Morning America. According to ABC News, the owner decided to auction the gnome on eBay, which sold with the photo album for in May 2005, because she became tired of all of the media attention. However, in February 2006, it was reported that the gnome had actually been secretly purchased on eBay by the owner's friends who continued to take photos of it around the world in locations such as Canada, Mexico, Italy, and Thailand. After it was returned for the second time, the original owner, referring to it as \\"the prodigal gnome\\", said she had decided to keep it and would not sell it on eBay again. In 2016, an ASDA Gnome named Gnorman hit was stolen from its owner in Luton, England. The perpetrator sent him a letter stating \\"Goodbyes are not forever, Goodbyes are not the end, They simply mean I‚Äòll miss you, Until we meet again.\\", and then continued to taunt him by making a Facebook profile in the Gnomes name then followed by posting pictures of it in many locations, such as the cinema, pubs, a trampoline park, a bowling alley, and an arcade. Gnoming as theft There have also been a number of criminal incidents in which individuals or groups steal large numbers of garden gnomes without the intention of returning, often with the purported mission of \\"freeing\\" gnomes and \\"returning them to the wild\\". These crimes can cause distress to the victims of the theft, particularly if the gnomes have sentimental value. France's Garden Gnome Liberation Front (), which in 2006 claimed 100 active members in France, Canada, Germany, Spain, and the United States, became known to the public in 1990s when they took credit for the theft of hundreds of garden gnomes around France. In 1997, their ringleader was sent to prison and fined for stealing over 150 garden gnomes over a period of several years. In 1998, the Garden Gnome Liberation Front made headlines again when they staged a \\"mass suicide\\" of gnomes by hanging 11 garden gnomes with nooses around their necks under a bridge at Briey in northeastern France with a note that stated, \\"When you read these few words we will no longer be part of your selfish world, where we serve merely as pretty decorations.\\" The Front was in the news again in 2000 when they stole 20 gnomes overnight from a garden exhibition in Paris, and they were suspected in 2006, when 80 gnomes were stolen in the central Limousin region of France under a banner that said \\"gnome mistreated, gnome liberated\\". In 2008, a 53-year-old man, who law enforcement officials believed acted alone, was arrested on suspicion of stealing as many as 170 garden gnomes in the Brittany region of France. In popular culture The travelling gnome prank was popularized by the film Am√©lie (2001) in which the main character persuaded her father to follow his dream of touring the world by stealing his garden gnome and having an air hostess friend send pictures of it from all over the world. The traveling gnome theme later became the basis for Travelocity's \\"Where is my Gnome?\\" advertising campaign. The short fantasy story \\"The Garden Gnome Freedom Front\\" (2005) by Laura Frankos, published in The Enchanter Completed: A Tribute Anthology for L. Sprague de Camp, deals with the supernatural aspect of this custom. The travelling gnome has appeared in several video games. For example, it has been used as a recurring Easter egg in The Sims computer game series, such as Sim City 3 (1999) where different varieties of garden gnomes appear and move or change position daily and in Sim City 4 (2004), in which gnomes reveal themselves in the game's buildable landmarks. In the video game, Half- Life 2: Episode Two (2007), players receive a special achievement award for launching a garden gnome into outer space in a rocket after carrying it throughout most of the game. Gnonstop Gnomes, a mobile app for Android and iOS devices, lets users attach clipart of virtual gnomes to their travel photographs that they can share with friends.

It is located on the southern shore of Melville Water, and forms its western end. Point Walter is located in the suburb of Bicton, approximately south of the Perth central business district, and north-east of Fremantle, and is on the opposite side of the river to the suburbs of Mosman Park, Peppermint Grove, and Dalkeith. Point Walter is a site of Aboriginal Australian heritage, both for its place in the Dreamtime and because of the local Whadjuk people's historical activities at the site. Named in 1827 by James Stirling, it was popular among the public for its variety of recreational activities and its facilities, such as tea rooms, a bathing house and a tavern. Through a series of events, the point suffered a drop in patronage from the late 19th century to World War II. At that time, it was rehabilitated from a state of disrepair, and an army camp was built on the premises, which was later transformed into a migrant settlement camp. Since the migrant camp's closure in 1972, the facilities have been used for multiple activities. Since 1912 Point Walter has been run by Melville City Council, and today is contained in the Point Walter Reserve. The reserve and the sandbar serve as important sites for flora and fauna, particularly bird-life. It is popularly used for a variety of recreational activities, and currently hosts the annual Point Walter concert.  History  = Indigenous history = Before European settlement, the Point Walter area was inhabited by Indigenous Australians of the Beeliar people, who were part of the Whadjuk Noongars. They knew the area as Dyoondalup, meaning in the Noongar language \\"place of long flowing white hair\\" or \\"place of white sand\\". It was traditionally an area for women and children, but also served as a meeting point when the clan wanted to move to another part of the river. Women at Point Walter would meet with men swimming across from Mosman Park to the sandbar. This function of the sandbar for river crossings was a key feature of the site; Mosman Park, also a place for women and children, contained a rock believed to impregnate a woman within a few weeks of her touching it. To cross the river as a group, they would cut down a tree, and children would float across the river on the log, with the adults swimming alongside them. Aboriginals would often practise controlled burning at the site, keeping the understory low, and flushing out game. During summer months, the site was a source of food and resources through its large variety of flora and fauna. Fishing was common, and fishing traps were used extensively. Usage of the local flora included making string from the native wisteria (Hardenbergia comptoniana) and gum from the marri (Corymbia calophylla). = Early history = During his survey along the Swan River of suitable spots for settlement, James Stirling named Point Walter after Walter Stirling. Walter's relationship to James is disputed, with some sources claiming Walter was James' uncle, with others claiming he was his brother. In 1830, the land was acquired by settlers Lionel Lukin and Alfred Waylen. Waylen developed the land by building a villa in 1830, which later burnt down. In 1831 his land was extended by to include part of his namesake suburb, Alfred Cove. The settlers were involved in skirmishes with the local Beeliar people; Waylen's house was burnt down in 1833, and one of Waylen's labourers was speared to death after another labourer killed an Aboriginal for stealing potatoes. This, coupled with infertile soils, saw these early settlers departing; Waylen left for a land grant on Preston River, before returning two years later to establish a more successful property. During his time at Point Walter, Waylen constructed an inn known as The Halfway House due to its location between Perth and Fremantle. In 1837 he cut a canal through the sandbar, reducing the distance of a boat trip between Perth and Fremantle by about , and charged a toll for its use. In 1843, Samuel Caporn and his family settled at Point Walter and took over running The Halfway House, having emigrated to Australia the previous year. The Caporns moved away from Point Walter in the mid-1850s, because the canal was silted up. The site became popular after the cutting of the canal, and was often used for crabbing, camping, swimming and picnicking. The only way to access the point was by boat, so a jetty was built. Point Walter's popularity led to the construction of two tea rooms and a timber bathing house to deal with ferries and yachting parties. Later, a limestone road was built, allowing access by horse-drawn carriages. The sources differ, but in either 1895 or 1907 the State Government purchased the land, declaring it a Class A reserve, and in 1912 the Melville Roads Board (now the Melville City Council) was appointed to manage it. The reserve officially opened on 30 November 1914.273x273px = Decline = The canal at Point Walter continuously silted up, and the difficulty of upkeep led to the Caporns departing the site. After the Caporns had left the area, the local authorities did not engage in upkeep, and the canal fell into further disrepair. Steamers on the Swan River stopped using the sandbar's narrow and shallow canal, instead travelling the full distance around it. By the 1860s the canal was unused. A campaign by businessman George Randell, then controller of river traffic due to his ownership of a steamboat service, attempted to reopen the canal, but due to the cost of ¬£2,000 it was not completed. The lack of steamer traffic caused a drop in popularity for the tea rooms, and with the drop in patronage from the introduction of the Fremantle-Perth railway on 1 March 1881, Point Walter became a \\"quiet backwater\\". In January 1923, to secure funding for the Point Walter memorial avenue, a three day carnival was held at Point Walter. By this time, the Melville Roads Board was receiving ¬£100 a year for grounds maintenance, which was proving inadequate to keep the grounds in order. A further decline in use was due to the increased use of ocean beaches by the public; as a result, control of the site was passed to the Parks and Gardens Board in 1929. In 1914, a tramway was constructed between Canning Road and Point Walter, which was not considered a success as it rarely ran at a profit outside the summer months. Despite this, the line was not closed down until 1939. Further troubles came from the Depression of the 1930s, during which another drop in recreational use was experienced. World War II further decreased patronage, and Point Walter fell into a state of disrepair. = World War II to modern day = In 1941, the Melville Army Camp was constructed on the land and was used for training soldiers for waterborne warfare. In 1947, the camp was converted to a migrant reception centre, which was operated until 1969 by the State Government and from 1969 until closure in mid-1971 by Commonwealth Hostels. During the time the migrant reception centre was open, public opinion was that the majority of the migrants were communists, a situation that culminated in a 1950 piece in The West Australian addressing the issue and refuting the perception. The state of disrepair continued until November 1952 when the reserve was again put in the hands of the Melville Roads Board, which made several alterations to the site, including the removal of all old buildings, and the addition of new changing rooms, toilet facilities and a kiosk. The Board also transported of clean sand to Point Walter Beach to rectify erosion problems, including the exposure of many limestone boulders in Point Walter's shallows. In 1972 there were hopes that a bridge would be constructed between Point Walter and Point Resolution, but prohibitive costs and other problems meant that these hopes did not come to anything. Post-1972, the facilities were used by the Department of Education to house the Graylands Teachers College. In 1980, control of of the land that had previously been used for army training purposes was handed over to the Department of Sport and Recreation (DSR). In 1986 the DSR removed all remaining hostel buildings and spent a considerable sum developing the sport and recreational facilities seen today. The official reopening occurring on 26 September 1986. The facilities' first patrons were the members of the Yacht Club Costa Smeraldathe Italian syndicate that participated in the Fremantle- hosted 1987 America's Cup. In 2005 the facilities were again refurbished with funding from the DSR Capital Works Program. Today, all that remains of the army camp is a watch-house from 1941. Point Walter is currently managed by Melville Council.  Geography  View of the sandbar from the shore Point Walter is contained within the Point Walter Reserve, which mainly consists of the Point Walter bushland. This consists primarily of three habitats: * A limestone ridge that outcrops on the lower slopes * Deep yellow sand over the ridge * Woodland higher up consisting of jarrah and marri = Flora and fauna = Within the Point Walter bushland, different habitats contain different populations of flora. The deep yellow sand supports the rare acorn banksia (Banksia prionotes) and tree smokebush (Conospermum triplinervium) species. In the higher areas are jarrah and marri woodland that is less disturbed, and there are several orchid species, including a group of rare albino fairy orchids Caladenia latifolia as well as several red spider orchid Caladenia areicola populations. The Point Walter area also supports a population of swamp sheoak (Casuarina obesa). At the base of the escarpment, out of the bushland, the most dominant features are the planted Morton Bay figs (Ficus macrophy) and the tall Norfolk pines (Arauccaria heterophylla). Poplars are also prominent, although these are considered a weed. In terms of botanical history, the Point Walter bushland is significant, as it was at this location early botanists first collected couch honeypot (Dryandra lindleyana) and cottonheads (Conostylis candicans). In 1839, the Cryptandra glabrata was collected at Point Walter, a species which has not been seen there since. = Birdlife = In the Point Walter bushland, hollows are used for nesting by galahs and Port Lincoln parrots. Carnaby's black cockatoos feed on parrot bush in the area. The area is also home to native species of frogs, small reptiles and various insects. There are also various pest animals present in the area, such as rabbits, cats, dogs and foxes. The sandbar is the nesting grounds of several bird species. They include the pied oystercatcher, the red-capped plover, the black swan and the fairy tern. The local government has made a conservation effort with the campaign \\"Don't buzz that bird\\", telling people not to get too close to them. = Erosion = In February 2012 the environmental consulting company Natural Area Management was contracted by the City of Melville to reverse the erosion that had occurred over the previous ten years due to the loss of beaches and grassed areas, factors aided by the undercutting of tree roots. Work began in March 2012, initial works were finished in 2013, and the project was completed in early 2014.  Sandbar  Birdlife, including seagulls and black swans, on and around the sandbar. Point Walter is notable for the sandbar or spit that extends over into the river; sections of the sandbar are often submerged at high water. The sandbar was formed through the collection of sediment along the aeolianite band that traverses the estuary. = Dreamtime relevance = The sandbar is prevalent in the Dreamtime of the local Aboriginals. They believe the sandbar was the hair of the Dreamtime figure Djunda (alternatively spelt Junda), the Charnok woman, and the nearby cliffs at Blackwall Reach were her footprints. Djunda is said to have carried spirit children in her hair, who, when they fell out, formed rocks. According to Dreamtime stories, when she reached Wave Rock in Hyden, she jumped off it into the sky, at which point her hair formed the Milky Way and the spirit children formed the stars. Due to this, Blackwall Reach is known to the Aboriginals as Jenalup, a word meaning \\"the place where feet make a track\\". Looking towards Point Walter from out on the sandbar.  Public use  Point Walter is the site of various cultural monuments, including a war memorial avenue. It also hosts the free annual Point Walter concert, which started in 1996 and features Perth bands, and on occasion notable individuals such as James Morrison. Previously this event was called \\"YAC it up\\" because it was organised by Melville's Youth Advisory Council and featured acts such as Birds of Tokyo and Bob Evans. Point Walter is used by the general public for a variety of activities, including kitesurfing, kayaking, canoeing, windsurfing, fishing, swimming, diving courses, prawning and picnicking. The area contains public facilities such as two shaded playgrounds, cycle and walking paths, a jetty, a boat ramp and barbecue areas. Point Walter also contains a cafe called Walters River Caf√©. Point Walter is contained in the Point Walter Reserve, which contains the Point Walter Golf Course, and Blackwall Reach.

The Government of Western Australia closed the settlement in 2003 by act of Parliament following allegations of widespread sexual abuse, rape and substance abuse, after a 15-year-old girl, Susan Taylor, committed suicide in 1999. The suicide was the subject of a coronial inquest, followed by the 2001 Gordon Inquiry into claims of family violence and child abuse in Western Australian Aboriginal communities. This led to the formation of a parliamentary select committee which reported on matters surrounding the Community and its closure. On 6 June 2008, Bella Bropho, on behalf of the Community, lost an appeal to the Federal Court on the grounds that their eviction and loss of property was in breach of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975. In March 2014, the Lockridge campsite was demolished to make way for a conservation reserve and meeting place. History Archaeological evidence suggests that the area has been inhabited for at least 38,000 years. From the 1830s until the 1940s the land was owned by the Hamersley family, which allowed Nyungah people to remain on their traditional campsite. In 1941 a group of Swan Valley Nyungah women from the Kickett, Nettles, Warrell and Parfitt families purchased of bushland bounded by Gallagher Street and Mary Crescent, Eden Hill. The local council refused their requests for water and applications to build housing so they camped in mia-mias, bush breaks and tin camps and relied on water dug from their own wells. In the 1950s the area was resumed by the State Housing Commission for the creation of the suburb of Eden Hill. In 1977 several groups decided to make a stand at the Lockridge Campsite and in 1981 the people incorporated themselves as Fringedwellers of the Swan Valley Inc. The Fringedwellers began a series of protests asking the government to assist them with housing. During the 1980s the improvised huts and tents were replaced with government-supplied mining cabins. On 19 July 1994 the Lockridge Campsite became the Swan Valley Nyungah Community when governor- general Michael Jeffery, \\"by virtue of the provisions of Section 33(2) of the Land Act 1933\\", vested Reserve 43131 (Swan Location 11942) in the Swan Valley Nyungah Community Aboriginal Corporation for the designated purpose of \\"use and benefit of Aboriginal Inhabitants\\".Department of Land Administration (DOLA) File 1728/994) With federal-government funding, community members designed their own culturally appropriate and environmentally sensitive housing. The community started its own school which taught Indigenous content and had a good attendance record. The camp also had a good relationship with local police.4 December 2001, Midland Reporter, p 5. Gordon Inquiry On 12 February 1999 Susan Taylor was found hanged in the toilet block at the Swan Valley Nyungah Community. The State Coroner Alastair Hope conducted an inquest which heard evidence from one girl who said that Robert Bropho had offered her money for sex. Another witness said girls, including Susan, had told her that Bropho gave them paint to sniff and money in exchange for sex. Coroner Hope returned an open finding into her death but said that \\"it was likely she took her own life after years of sexual abuse, and said it was apparent there was widespread sexual abuse against young Aborigines [in the community].\\" On 29 November 2001 the State Government called for Magistrate Sue Gordon to lead an inquiry into child abuse and domestic violence in Aboriginal Communities in Western Australia.

History Though the history of the place cannot be traced back earlier than the 17th century, it was of great importance long before the foundation of Murshidabad. The first European traders set up factories here, and after the ruin of Satgaon due to the silting up of the mouth of the Saraswati river, it gained a position as the great trading centre of Bengal, which was not challenged until after the foundation of Calcutta. Cossimbazar and Murshidabad in the mid-18th century The Dutch cemetery in Cossimbazar. The English, Dutch and French East India companies all maintained factories at Cossimbazar. In 1658 the first English agency of the East India Company (EIC) was established there, and in 1667 the chief of the factory there became an ex officio member of council. In English documents of this period, and till the early 19th century, the Hooghly River was described as the \\"Cossimbazar river\\", and the triangular piece of land between the Hooghly, Padma and Jalangi, on which the city stands, as the island of Cossimbazar. The proximity of the factory to Murshidabad, the capital of the Nawabs of Bengal, while it was the main source of its wealth and of its political importance, exposed it to a constant risk of attack. Thus in 1757 it was the first EIC factory to be taken by Siraj-ud-dowlah, the Nawab; and the resident with his assistant Warren Hastings were taken as prisoners to Murshidabad. The town was the seat of the Maharajas of Cossimbazar. The maharajas were descendants of Kanta Babu, the moneylender (banian) of Warren Hastings, who was governor-general of Bengal from 1773 to 1785. The majarajas built a fine palace in Cossimbazar, portions of which were made of carved stone taken from the palace of Chait Singh, Maharaja of Benares.\\"Cossimbazar\\" in Imperial Gazetteer of India, Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1908-1931 [v. 1, 1909] Maharaja Sir Manindra Chandra Nandy (1860 ‚Äì 1929) was a philanthropist and patron of education who figured in the Bengal Renaissance. At the beginning of the 19th century the city still flourished; as late as 1811 it was described as famous for its silks, hosiery, koras and beautiful ivory work. However, its once healthy climate gradually worsened, and, probably because of endemic malaria, the area of cultivated land round it shrank drastically. Jungle took its place, and in 1813 its ruin was completed by a sudden change in the course of the Hoogly. A new channel formed 3 miles from the old town, leaving an evil-smelling swamp around the ancient wharves. In 1829, a census recorded the population as 3,538.\\"Cossimbazar\\" in Imperial Gazetteer of India, Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1908-1931 [v. 1, 1909] Of its splendid buildings the fine palace of the Maharaja of Cossimbazar alone remained, the rest being in ruins or represented only by great mounds of earth. The first wife of Warren Hastings was buried at Cossimbazar, where her tomb with its inscription still remained till the early 20th century. In 1901 its population was just 1,262.

History The horse was foaled in 1741 and originally owned by Francis Godolphin, 2nd Earl of Godolphin, and later sold. His name has been recorded as \\"Squball\\", \\"Sku-ball\\", or \\"Stewball\\". He won many races in England and was sent to Ireland. The Irish turf calendar states that he won six races worth ¬£508 in 1752, when he was eleven years old, and was the top-earning runner of that year in Ireland. His most famous race took place on the plains of Kildare, Ireland, which is generally the subject of the song of the same name. The early ballad about the event has Skewball belonging to an Arthur Marvell or Mervin. Based on the horse's name, Skewball was likely a skewbald horse though he was listed in stud books as a bay. Songs There are two major different versions of the sporting ballad, generally titled either \\"Skewball\\" or \\"Stewball\\"; the latter is more popular in America. There are multiple variations within the two major divisions. Versions date at least as far back as the 18th century, appearing on numerous broadsides. In both songs the title horse is the underdog in the race, up against a favored grey mare (usually called either \\"Griselda\\" or \\"Molly\\"), and although in most versions of Stewball the winning horse triumphs due to the stumbling of the lead horse, Skewball wins simply by being the faster horse in the end. Probably the most significant lyrical difference in the songs is the conversation Skewball has with his jockey, while Stewball behaves more like a typical horse and does not speak. The oldest broadside identified with the ballad is dated 1784 and is held by the Harding Collection of the Bodleian Library of the University of Oxford. The song had spread to America by 1829 when it was published in a songbook in Hartford. American versions were sung and adapted by slaves in the Southern United States, and have Stewball racing in California, Texas, and Kentucky. British and Irish versions, when the setting is mentioned, usually place the race in Kildare, Ireland, leading some to believe that the song is actually Irish in origin.Old Dublin songs, ed. Hugh Shields (Dublin, 1988), The grey mare was owned by Sir Ralph Gore, whose family had gained a great deal of land in Ireland with the Protestant Cromwellian invasion (starting in 1650), which probably accounts for the delight in Skewball's win \\"breaking Sir Gore\\" in the final lines of this Irish-based broadside. The song is in the Roud Folk Song Index, #456. Recordings A notable recording is by American folk legend Woody Guthrie, who included an English and an American interpretation (both entitled Stewball) on tape, and recorded in Volume 4 of The Asch Recordings (1930‚Äì1940). The American interpretation is a chain-gang song sung by Lead Belly and Guthrie with an African American 'call and response' style, while the English interpretation is derived from the traditional British broadside ballad, and sung to a cowboy waltz tune. The American interpretation has Stewball as being born in California with the famed race against the grey mare taking place in Dallas, Texas. Lead Belly recorded several versions of this song, and the music and lyrics from his version appear in American Ballads and Folk Songs by Lomax and Lomax. John and Ruby Lomax also recorded a version by a \\"Group of Convicts\\" in their 1939 Southern States Recording Trip, available online at the American Memory site. Lead Belly's American chain-gang version of Stewball was covered in the 1950s by The Weavers, and then by British skiffle singer Lonnie Donegan. Guthrie's cowboy version of the British ballad, with the same lyrics but a different tune, was recorded in 1961 on the Vanguard album New Folks by John Herald and the Greenbriar Boys, and subsequently covered and popularized by Peter, Paul and Mary. Their version, however, has lyrics from a different perspective, where the singer wishes he had bet on Stewball, as opposed to Johnny Herald, who encourages others to do so, because he \\"never did lose.\\" Other versions of this version of Stewball include Mason Proffit on Wanted (1969), which differs in a number of lyrical changes (including the grey mare stumbling) from Peter, Paul, and Mary's version, Joan Baez's on Joan Baez/5 (1964), The Hollies on Would You Believe (1966), The Four Pennies on their Mixed Bag LP (1966), and the Chad Mitchell Trio on Reflecting (1964). Popular British versions include recordings by A. L. Lloyd, Martin Carthy, and Steeleye Span on the album Ten Man Mop, or Mr. Reservoir Butler Rides Again. An American version following the British tradition is recorded by Broadside Electric on Black-edged Visiting Card. The song has also been recorded by Irish musicians Andy Irvine and Paul Brady as \\"The Plains of Kildare\\" on their duo album Andy Irvine/Paul Brady, in 1976. A French song called \\"Stewball\\" (or also known as \\"Il s'appelait Stewball\\") was recorded by Hugues Aufray in 1966, becoming one of Aufray's biggest hits. However, this song (written by Hugues Aufray and Pierre Delano√´) is unlike the English-language songs of the same name, although the adaption was created after Aufray met Peter, Paul, and Mary, along with others such as Bob Dylan in a trip the United States. Aufray's version takes the perspective of a man recalling an experience as a ten-year-old boy. His father believes that Stewball will win a race, so he puts all his money and assets into this venture. Toward the end of the race, Stewball tragically falls. The veterinarian finishes him off with a single shot. This is the first time that the narrator witnesses his father cry. Aufray's song is very different in that it features Stewball not winning his race and dying due to an injury. This version was also later translated into Czech language by Milan Dvo≈ô√°k, becoming widely known by campfires. Also of interest are the renditions of the song by Doris Day that she had recorded in 1985/1986 for her TV series Doris Day's Best Friends: a solo version released on the American edition of her CD- album My Heart (2011) as well as a duet version with her late son Terry Melcher released in 2014 on the CD-album Music, Movies & Memories. The melody was also the basis for the song \\"Happy Xmas (War is Over)\\" by John Lennon, Yoko Ono and the Plastic Ono Band, which has become a Christmas standard since its release in 1971.

He was born in Martinsburg, New York.Advameg - Walter Hunt Biography Through the course of his work he became renowned for being a prolific inventor, notably of the lockstitch sewing machine (1833), safety pin (1849), a forerunner of the Winchester repeating rifle, a successful flax spinner, knife sharpener, streetcar bell, hard-coal-burning stove, artificial stone, street sweeping machinery, and the ice plough.Marshall Cavendish, p. 845. Walter Hunt did not realize the significance of many of these when he invented them; today, many are widely used products. He thought little of the safety pin, selling the patent for $400Discoveries to the company W R Grace and Company, to pay a man to whom he owed $15. He is said to have failed to patent his sewing machine at all because he feared it would create unemployment among seamstresses. (This led to an 1854 court case when the machine was re-invented by Elias Howe; Hunt's machine shown to have design flaws limiting its practical use). In seeking patents for his inventions, Hunt used the services of Charles Grafton Page, a patent solicitor who had previously worked at the US Patent Office. Like Howe, Hunt is buried in Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn, New York. Some of his important inventions are shown here with drawings from the patent.

D≈çjin are non- official self-published Japanese works which can be based on official products or completely original creations. Such products are sold online on specialized sites, on the authors' own sites, and in conventions such as the popular Comiket. Genres and production D≈çjin music isn't a musical genre in itself, but is indicative of a particular means of publication much in the same way as the term \\"indie\\" is used. Often, such music will consist of video game music fan arrangements. Much original d≈çjin music also exists, and has been created both for d≈çjin games and independently, spanning many musical genres such as pop, rock, techno, trance, hardcore and many more. By nature, d≈çjin music is self-produced at low cost by independent artists. Home-studio software is typically advantageous to d≈çjin music composers, as it is cheaper than studio-mastering live instruments. As such, most d≈çjin music has a distinct synthetic quality to it. It is common to have one live instrument (such as a guitar) backed up by synthetic orchestrations, though full instrumentation is becoming more and more common in d≈çjin music, such as orchestral works or d≈çjin jazz. Organization D≈çjin music artists can be solo or band projects. It is very common for members of different groups to collaborate on an album. Some projects, such as Woodsoft, are collaborations of several artists contributing to a given theme for each of their album releases. Each member of a group usually has their own individual site on which they release their personal works, free to download, and possibly give updates about their involvement in upcoming albums. Some artists actually never release albums and contain the scope of their artistic activity to free releases. The most productive groups usually release two albums a year, released in the summer and winter Comiket conventions and sold for an average of 1000 yen for full-length albums. The most involved and popular artists are usually featured on their own group albums but also make guest appearance on other groups' CDs. Aside from Comiket, events held in Japan for d≈çjin music include the bi-annual M3 music summit and the Hakurei Shrine Reitaisai, the latter of which includes music derived from Touhou Project.(Japanese) Notable artists and groups *Akiko Shikata, a soprano singer, composer, arranger, producer and multi-instrumentalist whose songs often tend towards experimentalism *Annabel, who has worked on several anime productions and is known for works in partnership with musicians like Nagi Yanagi and bermei.inazawa *Chata, a video game and anime vocalist *Haruka Shimotsuki, a vocalist known for her fantasy themes *IOSYS, a d≈çjin group most commonly recognized for their Touhou arrangements *Kishida Ky≈çdan & The Akeboshi Rockets, a rock band formed by Kishida and four other members * *Rekka Katakiri, a singer who manages her own Closed/Underground label *Sound Horizon, who describe themselves as a \\"fantasy band\\" *Team Shanghai Alice, the creator of and the composer for the Touhou Project D≈çjin lyrics Sometimes, people may rewrite the lyrics of an existing anime song to create a d≈çjin song, or insert lyrics into an originally instrumental anime track. These type of d≈çjin songs are called . Many d≈çjin lyrics are written in Japanese, Chinese, or Korean. Moreover, there are fan dubs of different languages of ACG songs, video game music, or Vocaloid songs, all in many different languages including English, Spanish, and others.

Released as a single but never charting,https://www.discogs.com/artist/267854-Bob-Seger?subtype=Singles- EPs&filter;_anv=0&type;=Releases&page;=2 Seger's live version of the song on the 1976 Live Bullet album became a mainstay of album-oriented rock radio stations, and still gets significant airplay on classic rock stations. Inspiration \\"Turn the Page\\" is about the emotional and social ups and downs of a rock musician's life on the road. Seger wrote it in 1972 while touring with Teegarden & Van Winkle. Drummer David Teegarden (of Teegarden & Van Winkle and later the Silver Bullet Band) recalls: > We had been playing somewhere in the Midwest, or the northern reaches, on > our way to North or South Dakota. [Guitarist] Mike Bruce was with us. We'd > been traveling all night from the Detroit area to make this gig, driving in > this blinding snowstorm. It was probably 3 in the morning. Mike decided it > was time to get gas. He was slowing down to exit the interstate and spied a > truck stop. We all had very long hair back then ‚Äì it was the hippie era ‚Äì > but Skip, Mike and Bob had all stuffed their hair up in their hats. You had > to be careful out on the road like that, because you'd get ostracized. When > I walked in, there was this gauntlet of truckers making comments ‚Äì \\"Is that > a girl or man?\\" I was seething; those guys were laughing their asses off, a > big funny joke. That next night, after we played our gig ‚Äì I think it was > Mitchell, S.D. ‚Äì Seger says, \\"Hey, I've been working on this song for a bit, > I've got this new line for it. He played it on acoustic guitar, and there > was that line: \\"Oh, the same old cliches / 'Is that a woman or a man?' \\" It > was \\"Turn the Page.\\" Tom Weschler, then road manager for Seger, remembers the same incident: > \\"Turn the Page,\\" Bob's great road song, came along in '72, while we were > driving home from a gig. I think we were in Dubuque, Iowa, in winter and > stopped at a restaurant. We stood out when we entered a store or a gas > station or a restaurant en masse. At this restaurant it was particularly > bright inside, so there weren't any dark corners to hide in. All these local > guys were looking at us like, \\"What are these guys? Is that a woman or a > man?\\" ‚Äì just like in the song. ... That was one incident, but there were so > many others on the road that led Seger to write that song.Weschler, Tom, and > Gary Graff. Travelin Man: on the road and behind the scenes with Bob Seger. > Detroit, Michigan: Wayne State University Press, 2009. While on tour in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, on November 16, 2006, promoting his 16th studio album Face the Promise, Seger said he wrote the song in a hotel room in Eau Claire, Wisconsin.https://www.nola.com/entertainment_life/music/article_73cbb724-b176-54db-9894-7e42d09a8b10.htmlhttps://onmilwaukee.com/articles/bob- seger-fiserv-forum-review Instrumentation Both Seger's studio and live versions of \\"Turn the Page\\" feature a Mellotron and a saxophone part played by founding Silver Bullet member Alto Reed. Tom Weschler allegedly helped inspire Reed to create the opening melody. During recording, Weschler told Reed: \\"Alto, think about it like this: You're in New York City, on the Bowery. It's 3 a.m. You're under a streetlamp. There's a light mist coming down. You're all by yourself. Show me what that sounds like.\\" With that, Reed played the opening melody to \\"Turn the Page\\". Jon English cover Australian singer Jon English released a version of the song in 1974 as the lead single from his second studio album, It's All a Game. The song peaked at number 20 on the Kent Music Report. Metallica cover Of the many cover versions that have been recorded, the most popular cover version is by Metallica who released it as the first single from their 1998 Garage Inc. album, reaching number 1 on the Billboard Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks chart for 11 consecutive weeks, the highest number of weeks Metallica has ever spent at the top; the song also reached #102 on the Billboard Pop charts.Joel Whitburn's Bubbling Under the Billboard Hot 100 1959-2004 Drummer Lars Ulrich had heard the original song while driving across the Golden Gate Bridge and later commented that he thought it \\"had James Hetfield all over it\\". Metallica's rendition is taken at much the same tempo as Seger's, but with a heavier feel; the saxophone part is replaced by a high slide guitar line from Kirk Hammett. The accompanying music video explores a day in the life not of musicians, but a single mother (played by Ginger Lynn) who is a sex worker; that is, she works as a stripper by day, and a prostitute by night. MTV refused to air the video due to nudity and a scene depicting sexual assault between the mother and a client. The video was directed by Jonas √Ökerlund. Other covers Waylon Jennings covered the song on his album of the same name in 1985. Influences Jon Bon Jovi has claimed that the song was a big influence on him and Richie Sambora when they were writing their 1986 song \\"Wanted Dead or Alive\\". Awards In 2014, Seger performed the song on CMT Crossroads with country singer Jason Aldean. The video of the performance won the CMT Music Award for Performance Video of the Year.

He was expelled from Hungary in 1031 or 1032, and spent many years in Bohemia, Poland and the Kievan Rus'. He returned to Hungary, where a pagan uprising was developing around that time, in 1046. Levente remained a devout pagan, but did not hinder the election of his Christian brother, Andrew I as king.  Childhood  Hungarian chronicles have preserved contradictory information of his parentage. According to one variant, Levente and his two brothersAndrew and B√©lawere \\"the sons of Ladislas the Bald\\"Simon of K√©za: The Deeds of the Hungarians (ch. 2.44), p. 107.The Hungarian Illuminated Chronicle: (ch. 60.87), p. 113. and his \\"wife from Ruthania\\", that is from the Kievan Rus'. On the other hand, a concurring tradition has preserved that the three brothers were sons of Ladislas the Bald's brother, \\"Vazul by some girl from the clan\\" of T√°tony. Modern historians agree that the latter report is more reliable and unanimously write that Levente was born to Vazul and his concubine from the T√°tony clan. However, historians still debate whether Levente was the eldest or a younger son of his father. Gyula Krist√≥, who says that Levente was Vazul's eldest son, writes that he was born between 1010 and 1015.  In exile and return  Levente, Andrew and B√©la left Hungary after their father was blinded in 1031 or 1032. They first settled in Bohemia. They left Bohemia, where \\"their condition of life was poor and mean\\",The Hungarian Illuminated Chronicle: (ch. 53.78), p. 110. according to the Illuminated Chronicle, and moved to the court of King Mieszko II of Poland in 1034 at the latest. The youngest among them, B√©la settled here, but Levente and Andrew moved to Kiev. Andrew was baptized in Kiev, but Levente remained a devout pagan. Dissatisfied with King Peter Orseolo, who succeeded Stephen I of Hungary, Hungarian lords persuaded Levente and Andrew to return to Hungary in 1046. Meanwhile, a great pagan uprising had broken out in Hungary. The rebels captured King Peter. The Hungarian lords and prelates preferred a Christian monarch and offered the crown to Andrew. The Illuminated Chronicle states that Levente \\"would beyond doubt have corrupted all Hungary with paganism and idolatry\\".The Hungarian Illuminated Chronicle: (ch. 60.86), p. 113. However, the same chronicle also writes that Levente gave the crown, in the \\"simplicity of spirit\\",The Hungarian Illuminated Chronicle: (ch. 65.92), p. 115. to Andrew, suggesting that Levente voluntarily renounced the crown in favor of his brother. Levente died in 1047 and was buried in a village on the Danube which was named after his great-grandfather, Taksony, who was \\"said to lie in a pagan grave\\" there, according to the Illuminated Chronicle.

In Europe, the species C. lunensis competed with the giant cheetah Acinonyx pardinensis, and may have preyed on the small bourbon gazelle (Gazella borbonica) and the chamois antelope (Procamptoceras brivatense).Kurt√©n, Bj√∂rn (1968) Pleistocene mammals of Europe, p. 68-69, Weidenfeld and Nicolson, 1968 The North American C. ossifragus was similar in build to C. lunensis, but had slightly more robust jaws and teeth. It may have preyed on the giant marmot Paenemarmota, and competed with the far more numerous Borophagus diversidens.Wang, Xiaoming & Tedford, Richard H.

Under the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature the term has no standing (it is not accepted). In other words, although form names are Latin, and are sometimes wrongly appended to a binomial name, in a zoological context, forms have no taxonomic significance at all. Usage of the term Some zoologists use the word \\"form\\" or \\"forma\\" to describe variation in animals, especially insects, as part of a series of terms and abbreviations that are appended to the binomen or trinomen. Many 'typical specimens' may be described, but none should be considered absolute, unconditional or categorical. Forms have no official status, though they are sometimes useful in describing altitudinal or geographical clines. As opposed to morphs (see below), a subpopulation usually consists of a single form only at any given point of time. forma geographica - f. geogr. : If used, nowadays usually denotes a part of a cline; for example for intergrades between subspecies in their area of contact. forma localis - f. loc. : As \\"f. geogr.\\" but only local, more restricted in occurrence. See also small population size. forma alta - f. alt. : Altitudinal features are not necessarily inherited, but may entirely be due to environment. The same applies to temperature or humidity-generated forms, such as: :: forma vernalis - f. vern. (spring form) :: forma aestivalis - f. aest. (summer form) :: forma autumnalis - f. autumn. (autumn form) aberratio - ab. : May be used for a single individual, for a small group such as an individual and its offspring, or for atypical individuals (for example, albinos). : Also used for commonly observed forms of a species, but in this case use of forma (f.) or morpha, accompanied by a descriptive name, is more conventional. Notes: * A morph is a similar concept with a less restricted occurrence (see also Polymorphism). As neither forms nor morphs are officially recognised terminology in zoology, application can vary but, generally, morphs occur without geographical or seasonal restriction, and may constitute a significant part of the population; usually, several morphs co-occur in a single subpopulation at a given time. The peppered moth is a famous example. * Botanical nomenclature is much more complex, with the use of varieties, subvarieties, and forms being formally regulated by the ICBN.

Distribution The common eastern froglet ranges from South eastern Australia, from Adelaide to Melbourne, up the eastern coast to Brisbane. It also inhabits a majority of Tasmania. It is one of the most commonly encountered frog species within its range, due to its ability to occupy several habitat types. Description The common eastern froglet is a small frog (3 centimetres), of brown or grey colour of various shades. The frog is of extremely variable markings, with great variety usually found within confined populations. A dark, triangular mark is found on the upper lip, with darker bands on the legs. A small white spot is on the base of each arm. The dorsal and ventral surfaces are very variable. The dorsal surface may be smooth, warty or have longitudinal skin folds. The colour varies from dark brown, fawn, light and dark grey. The colour of the ventral surface is similar to the dorsal surface, but mottled with white spots. Ecology and behaviour The common eastern froglet will call within a large chorus of males close to a still water source, or slow flowing creek. The call of the male is a crik-crik-crik, this is heard all year round, during wet and dry conditions. An average of about 200 eggs are laid in small clusters attached to submerged vegetation, the tadpoles and eggs survive in 14-15 ¬∞C water. Tadpoles are normally brown and reach about 36mm in length. Development is relatively short, however it is dependent on environmental conditions. At a temperature of 15 ¬∞C development can range from 6 weeks to more than 3 months. Metamorph frogs are very small, about 8 mm. The diet of the species consists of small insects, much smaller in comparison to their size than most frogs.

As with C's other floating-point types, it may not necessarily map to an IEEE format. \`long double\` in C =History= The \`long double\` type was present in the original 1989 C standard,ANSI/ISO 9899-1990 American National Standard for Programming Languages - C, section 6.1.2.5. but support was improved by the 1999 revision of the C standard, or C99, which extended the standard library to include functions operating on \`long double\` such as \`sinl()\` and \`strtold()\`. Long double constants are floating-point constants suffixed with \\"L\\" or \\"l\\" (lower-case L), e.g., 0.333333333333333333L. Without a suffix, the evaluation depends on FLT_EVAL_METHOD. =Implementations= On the x86 architecture, most C compilers implement \`long double\` as the 80-bit extended precision type supported by x86 hardware (generally stored as 12 or 16 bytes to maintain data structure alignment), as specified in the C99 / C11 standards (IEC 60559 floating-point arithmetic (Annex F)). An exception is Microsoft Visual C++ for x86, which makes \`long double\` a synonym for \`double\`.MSDN homepage, about Visual C++ compiler The Intel C++ compiler on Microsoft Windows supports extended precision, but requires the \`/Qlong‚Äëdouble\` switch for \`long double\` to correspond to the hardware's extended precision format.Intel Developer Site Compilers may also use \`long double\` for the IEEE 754 quadruple-precision binary floating-point format (binary128). This is the case on HP-UX, Solaris/SPARC,Sun Numerical Computation Guide, Chapter 2: IEEE Arithmetic MIPS with the 64-bit or n32 ABI,, 64-bit ARM (AArch64) (on operating systems using the standard AAPCS calling conventions, such as Linux), and z/OS with FLOAT(IEEE). Most implementations are in software, but some processors have hardware support. On some PowerPC and SPARCv9 machines, \`long double\` is implemented as a double- double arithmetic, where a \`long double\` value is regarded as the exact sum of two double-precision values, giving at least a 106-bit precision; with such a format, the \`long double\` type does not conform to the IEEE floating-point standard. Otherwise, \`long double\` is simply a synonym for \`double\` (double precision), e.g. on 32-bit ARM, 64-bit ARM (AArch64) (on Windows and macOS) and on 32-bit MIPS (old ABI, a.k.a. o32). With the GNU C Compiler, \`long double\` is 80-bit extended precision on x86 processors regardless of the physical storage used for the type (which can be either 96 or 128 bits),Using the GNU Compiler Collection, x86 Options. On some other architectures, \`long double\` can be double-double (e.g. on PowerPCUsing the GNU Compiler Collection, RS/6000 and PowerPC OptionsInside Macintosh - PowerPC Numerics 128-bit long double support routines for Darwin) or 128-bit quadruple precision (e.g. on SPARCSPARC Options). As of gcc 4.3, a quadruple precision is also supported on x86, but as the nonstandard type \`__float128\` rather than \`long double\`.GCC 4.3 Release Notes Although the x86 architecture, and specifically the x87 floating-point instructions on x86, supports 80-bit extended-precision operations, it is possible to configure the processor to automatically round operations to double (or even single) precision. Conversely, in extended-precision mode, extended precision may be used for intermediate compiler-generated calculations even when the final results are stored at a lower precision (i.e. FLT_EVAL_METHOD  2). With gcc on Linux, 80-bit extended precision is the default; on several BSD operating systems (FreeBSD and OpenBSD), double-precision mode is the default, and \`long double\` operations are effectively reduced to double precision.Brian J. Gough and Richard M. Stallman, An Introduction to GCC, section 8.6 Floating-point issues (Network Theory Ltd., 2004). (NetBSD 7.0 and later, however, defaults to 80-bit extended precision ). However, it is possible to override this within an individual program via the FLDCW \\"floating-point load control-word\\" instruction. On x86_64 the BSDs default to 80-bit extended precision. Microsoft Windows with Visual C++ also sets the processor in double-precision mode by default, but this can again be overridden within an individual program (e.g. by the \`_controlfp_s\` function in Visual C++_controlfp_s, Microsoft Developer Network (2/25/2011).). The Intel C++ Compiler for x86, on the other hand, enables extended-precision mode by default.Intel C++ Compiler Documentation, Using the -fp-model (/fp) Option. On IA-32 OS X, \`long double\` is 80-bit extended precision.https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/DeveloperTools/Conceptual/LowLevelABI/130-IA-32_Function_Calling_Conventions/IA32.html Other specifications In CORBA (from specification of 3.0, which uses \\"ANSI/IEEE Standard 754-1985\\" as its reference), \\"the long double data type represents an IEEE double-extended floating-point number, which has an exponent of at least 15 bits in length and a signed fraction of at least 64 bits\\", with GIOP/IIOP CDR, whose floating-point types \\"exactly follow the IEEE standard formats for floating point numbers\\", marshalling this as what seems to be IEEE 754-2008 binary128 a.k.a. quadruple precision without using that name.

Early life and education Both of Chapman's parents died whilst he was still a young child. His mother, Winifred Ormond, died shortly after his birth in London and his father, Frank Spencer Chapman, was killed at the Battle of the Somme; Freddie (or sometimes Freddy as he was to become known) and his older brother, Robert, were cared for by an elderly clergyman and his wife in the village of Cartmel, on the edge the Lake District. Chapman developed an early interest in nature and the outdoors. As a boy he was, by his own account, 'first a mad-keen butterfly collector, then a wild-flower enthusiast, and at last a bird-watcher'. These were continuing interests throughout his school years and into his adult life.Freeman, C.

He spent twenty hours in a storm at sea in his kayak and at one point fell into a deep crevasse, saving himself by holding onto the handles of his dog sled. He later led a three-man team across the desolate Greenland ice-cap. The first European to do this since Nansen, he was fluent in the Inuit language and was an able kayaker and dog sledger. Chapman, with the other expedition members, was awarded the Polar Medal, with the clasp Arctic 1930‚Äì1931, after the successful first expedition. In between the Greenland Expeditions he attempted what was to become the Bob Graham Round, and of climbing, his time of 25 hours was not however a record. Gino Watkins moulded an extraordinary esprit de corps in his expeditions, and the expedition members were a mixture of hard nuts, and rather fey Cambridge misfits. Many of the members would go on to do extraordinary things in the war. These members included Martin Lindsay, Augustine Courtauld and Chapman himself. Early in 1936, he joined a Himalayan climbing expedition. He was not only a keen mountaineer but studied the history of mountaineering, Dr Kellas being amongst his heroes. He enjoyed difficult climbs and met Basil Gould, the Political Officer for Sikkim, Bhutan and Tibet. Gould invited Spencer to be his private secretary on his political mission, from July 1936 to February 1937, to persuade the Panchen Lama to return from China and establish permanent British representation in Lhasa. Spencer struggled to learn Tibetan, learning it well enough to converse. He was involved in cypher work, kept a meteorological log, pressed six hundred plants, dried seeds, and made notes on bird life. He kept a diary of \\"events\\" in Lhasa and took many photographsThe Tibet Album that were sent to India on a weekly basis. He was allowed to wander and did so in an unshepherded way into the middle of Tibet and around the Holy City. After his return from Lhasa, Chapman obtained permission to lead a five-man expedition from Sikkim to the holy mountain Chomolhari, which the British group had passed on the way from Sikkim to Tibet in July 1936. Chapman and Sherpa Passang Dawa Lama succeeded to become the first mountaineers to climb the 7314 m high peak, which they finally reached from the Bhutanese side after finding the route from the Tibetan side impassable. The mountain would not be climbed again until 1970. In 1938 Spencer taught at Gordonstoun School where Prince Philip was one of his pupils. Malaya Commissioned into the Seaforth Highlanders as a lieutenant on 6 June 1939, Chapman was chosen for a mission in Australia to train Australian and New Zealand forces in guerrilla warfare and eventually to join what was then Special Training School 101 (STS 101) in Singapore. One of the main objects of this school was the organisation of parties to stay behind in areas the Japanese might overrun. In August 1941, a plan for stay-behind parties that would include local Indians, Chinese and Malays was proposed, but this was rejected by the British colonial governor, Sir Shenton Thomas, as extravagant and defeatist. Had permission been granted, Chapman speculated that the effect of the trained guerrilla forces would have delayed the Japanese invasion long enough for British reinforcements to arrive in Singapore, and Singapore might not have fallen. During the Japanese invasion the then Captain Chapman took part in an undercover raid across the Perak River in support of Rose Force. During the mission Chapman noticed how lightly equipped the Japanese soldiers were in contrast to the heavy kit of the British and Indian forces. He noted they had little standard issue equipment other than raincoats which had a hood and covered the bikes they were riding, allowing them to continue cycling in the rain. In early 1942, Chapman ran out of the supplies that had been hidden for stay-behind parties such as his team. Chapman and his team then tried to escape from Malaya, but had to hide from the Japanese in the Malayan jungle with the help of the Malayan Chinese Communists led by Chin Peng who lived in guerrilla camps in the jungle, waging war with the Japanese. However, due to the difficult jungle terrain and also due to Japanese attacks, or by leading search parties for lost members, he gradually lost all his team members through disease and gunfire and was completely cut off. For more than one and a half years, he had to live in jungle camps with Chinese Communist guerrillas, traveling long distances through dense and difficult jungles while often suffering high fevers caused by malaria. In late 1943, Chapman finally re-established contact with the British. Two other Britons joined him from Force 136. On a search mission in the jungle for another stay-behind-Briton, Chapman was captured by the Japanese but managed to escape back into the jungle during the night, despite being surrounded by Japanese soldiers, who were asleep as well as several on guard. The Japanese had confiscated a number of his possessions including many of his natural scientific observations in diaries, which he requested (via a letter to the Japanese Governor General) be sent to the Royal Geographical Society of London should they be found, although they were never returned . Due to continued Japanese attacks, Chapman and the two members of Force 136, John Davis and Richard Broome, were isolated again among the Communist guerrillas until early 1945. During that time, they had to fight against jungle diseases, namely, malaria, beriberi, dysentery and skin ulcers from leech bites. Finally, with the help of the Malayan Chinese Communists, they managed to repair first their radio receiver (using car batteries charged with a pedal dynamo) and secondly their radio transmitter equipment with spare parts collected by the Communist guerrillas (the military wing of this being the Malayan Peoples' Anti-Japanese Army). They were able to contact their headquarters in Colombo to organise reinforcements and supplies via parachute drops into the jungle. Subsequently, they could support British liaisons with the Malayan Chinese Communist guerrillas, and managed to escape from occupied Malaya in the submarine after a trek from the mainland jungle to the island Pulau Pangkor off the west coast disguised as Chinese labourers. Chapman was wounded twice during his time in Malaya, once in the leg by a steel nut from a homemade cartridge and once in the arm. He was captured both by Japanese troops and by Chinese bandits, escaping from both. Once he spent seventeen days in a semi coma, suffering from tick-typhus, blackwater fever, and pneumonia, with the effects of chronic malaria being the worst of it. However much he suffered in the Malayan jungle, Chapman attributed his survival to the basic rule that \\"the jungle is neutral\\", that one should view the surroundings as neither good or bad. The role of a survivalist is to expect nothing and accept the dangers and bounties of the jungle as of a natural course. Hence, one's steady state of mind was of the utmost importance to ensure that the physical health of body and the will to live were reinforced on a daily basis. In the foreword to Chapman's book on his experiences in Japanese occupied Malaya, The Jungle Is Neutral, Field Marshal Earl Wavell wrote \\"Colonel Chapman has never received the publicity and fame that were his predecessor's lot (referring to T.E.Lawrence); but for sheer courage and endurance, physical and mental, the two men stand together as examples of what toughness the body will find, if the spirit within it is tough; and as very worthy representatives of our national capacity for individual enterprise, which it is hoped that even the modern craze for regulating our lives in every detail will never stifle.\\" On 21 February 1946 Chapman was appointed to the Distinguished Service Order, backdated to 31 March 1944. A Bar followed on 7 November 1946. He retained a reserve commission until 4 December 1957, when he reached the age limit for service. He was belatedly awarded the Efficiency Decoration on 19 January 1970. Post-war After the war, Chapman was asked to form a school in Germany for the sons and daughters of British Forces and Control Commission Civilians resident in the British Zone of occupied Germany. This school, the King Alfred School, Pl√∂n, for children 11 to 18 years of age, used the German naval establishment at Pl√∂n in Schleswig-Holstein where Admiral D√∂nitz had resided during the last days of World War II. Chapman, as headmaster, set up the school, organised the teachers, arranged for the alterations to accept both boys and girls, and then in one day in 1948 accepted 400 young boys and girls into what was possibly the first successful comprehensive, co-educational boarding school in the world. His dynamism and understanding of the requirements of young people were the guiding influence in setting up the school to become a first class success story which lasted for 11 years. He was relieved after its successful commencement, at which time he continued in educational work as Headmaster of St Andrew's College, Grahamstown, South AfricaThe Tibet Album (1956‚Äì61) and Warden of Wantage Hall at the University of Reading (1966‚Äì71). He was the subject of This Is Your Life in January 1964 when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews at the BBC Television Theatre. Personal life In 1946, Chapman married Faith Townson and had three children: Nicholas, Stephen and Christopher. =Death= Chapman suffered from frequent and severe back pain, as well as recurring stomach pain and headaches.Barker, Ralph (1975).

It is listed in the Annuario Pontificio as a sui iuris church, an Eastern rite particular Church in full union with the Catholic Church. History The Christians who, through the Union of Brest (1595‚Äì96), entered full communion with the See of Rome while keeping their Byzantine liturgy in the Church Slavonic language, were at first mainly Belarusian (Litvin). Even after further Ukrainians joined the Union around 1700, Belarusians still formed about half of the group. According to the historian Anatol Taras, by 1795, around 80% of Christians in Belarus were Greek Catholics, with 14% being Latin Catholics and 8% being Orthodox. = Russian Empire = The partition of Poland-Lithuania and the incorporation of the whole of Belarus into Russia led, according to the Russian Orthodox Church,–í–æ—Å—Å–æ–µ–¥–∏–Ω–µ–Ω–∏–µ –£–Ω–∏–∞—Ç–æ–≤ –∏ –ò—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–µ –°—É–¥—å–±—ã –ë–µ–ª–æ—Ä—É—Å—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –ù–∞—Ä–æ–¥–∞ many Belarusians (1,553 priests, 2,603 parishes and 1,483,111 people) to unite, by March 1795, with the Russian Orthodox Church. Another sourceSiarhiej Hajek: The Belarusian Greek Catholic Church Yesterday and Today in ŒöŒ±Œ∏ŒøŒªŒπŒ∫ŒÆ of 25 July 2006 seems to contradict this, since it gives the number of parishes that came under Russian rule in 1772 only as \\"over 800\\", meaning that many priests and people remained in communion with Rome. After the unsuccessful 1830-1831 November Uprising against Russian rule and the subsequent removal of the predominantly Catholic local nobility from influence in Belarusian society, the three bishops of the Church, along with 21 priests,Oriente Cattolico (1974), page 176 convoked in February 1839 a synod that was held in Polatsk on 25 March 1839. This officially brought 1,600,000 Christians and either 1,305 or some 2,500 priests to join the Russian Orthodox Church. However, some priests and faithful still refused to join. The Russian state assigned most of the property to the Orthodox Church in the 1840s, and some priests emigrated to Austrian Galicia, while others chose to practise in secret the now- forbidden religion. = 20th century = When, in 1905, Tsar Nicholas II published a decree granting freedom of religion, as many as 230,000 Belarusians wanted union with Rome. However, since the government refused to allow them to form a Byzantine-Rite community, they adopted the Latin Rite, to which most Belarusian Catholics now belong. After the First World War, the western part of Belarus was included in the reconstituted Polish state, and some 30,000 descendants of those who, less than a century before, had joined the Russian Orthodox Church joined the Catholic Church, while keeping their Byzantine liturgy. In 1931, the Holy See sent them a bishop as Apostolic Visitator. After the Soviet Union annexed West Belarus in 1939, an exarch for the Belarusian Byzantine-Rite faithful was appointed in May 1940, but, a mere two years later, he was arrested and taken to a Soviet concentration camp, where he died.  Cold War  While from then on very little information about the Byzantine Catholics in Belarus could reach Rome, refugees from among them founded centres in western Europe (Paris, London and Louvain) and in parts of the United States of America, especially in Chicago. From 1947, Father Leo Haroshka initiated in Paris a pastoral and cultural periodical called Bozhym Shliakham (–ë–æ–∂—ã–º –®–ª—è—Ö–∞–º), which was published from 1960 to the end of 1980 in London. In London also, Father Alexander Nadson began translating the Byzantine liturgical texts into the Belarusian language in the 1970s. Thanks to this work, when in 1990 the first Greek-Catholic parishes could be organized in Belarus, they were able immediately to use these texts in their national language. In 1960, the Holy See appointed Cheslau Sipovich as Apostolic Visitator for the Belarusian faithful abroad. He was the first Belarusian Catholic bishop since the Synod of Polatsk. A successor, Father Uladzimir Tarasevich, was appointed in 1983. After his death in 1986, Father Alexander Nadson was appointed Apostolic Visitator, but not, at his own request, raised to episcopal rank.  Dissolution of the Soviet Union  The 1980s saw a gradual increase in interest among Minsk intellectuals in the Greek-Catholic Church. Articles by Anatol Sidarevich and Jury Khadyka about its history appeared in the 1987-1988 issues of Litaratura i Mastastva. And in the autumn of 1989 some young intellectuals of Minsk decided to publish the periodical Unija intended to promote the rebirth of the Greek-Catholic Church. In early 1990, Father Nadson brought humanitarian aid from Belarusians abroad to their compatriots at home still suffering as a result of the 1986 Chernobyl disaster. He was surprised to meet young Belarusians who said they were Greek Catholics. On 11 March, he celebrated Minsk's first Divine Liturgy in the national language, and, two days later, had a meeting with the editors of Unija, the first issue of which was then printed in Latvia.Siarhiej Hajek: The Belarusian Greek Catholic Church Yesterday and Today in ŒöŒ±Œ∏ŒøŒªŒπŒ∫ŒÆ of 22 August 2006 September 1990 saw the registration of the first Greek-Catholic parish since the Second World War, and in early 1991 Father Jan Matusevich began to celebrate the liturgy in his Minsk apartment. He was later put in charge of all the Greek-Catholic parishes in Belarus, and died in 1998.  Republic of Belarus  By 1992, three priests and two deacons in Belarus were celebrating the Byzantine liturgy in Belarusian. The same year, a survey by Belarus State University found that 10,000 people in Minsk identified themselves as Greek Catholics.Servizio Informazioni Chiese Orientali (2005), page 165 Extrapolated to the country as a whole, this was interpreted to mean that, especially among the intelligentsia and nationally conscious youth, some 120,000 Belarusians were in favour of a rebirth of the Greek-Catholic Church. Because of the lack of priests and churches this interest did not lead to membership. In 1994 Pope John Paul II has appointed Fr. Sergiusz Gajek Apostolic Visitor for Greek Catholics in Belarus. Present situation At the beginning of 2005, the Belarusian Greek Catholic Church had 20 parishes, of which 13 had obtained state recognition. As of 2003, there have been two Belarusian Greek Catholic parishes in each of the following cities - Minsk, Polatsk and Vitsebsk; and only one in Brest, Hrodna, Mahiliou, Maladziechna and Lida. The faithful permanently attached to these came to about 3,000, while some 4,000 others lived outside the pastoral range of the parishes. Today there are 16 priests, and 9 seminarians. There was a small Studite monastery at Polatsk. The parishes are organized into two deaneries, each headed by a protopresbyter or archpriest. Two of the parishes had small churches. Some of the others had pastoral centres with an oratory. Belarusian Greek Catholics abroad, numbering about 2,000, were under the care of Mitred Protopresbyter Alexander Nadson as Apostolic Visitator until his death in 2015. The chief centres are the Church of St Cyril of Turau and All the Patron Saints of the Belarusian People in London and parishes in Antwerp (constituted in 2003) and Kostomloty, Poland.http://unici.pl/content/view/67.html A parish in Chicago, that of Christ the Redeemer, existed from 1955 to 2003. It was founded by Father John Chrysostom Tarasevich and was later the home parish of Bishop Uladzimir (Vladimir) Tarasevich until his death, after which it was administered by the local Latin Catholic ordinary, who appointed first Father Joseph Cirou and then Father John Mcdonnell as administrators. On 7 September 1996, the parish had seen the ordination of Prince Michael Huskey, EOHS as the first Belarusian deacon in the United States. Father Deacon Michael served in the parish until it was closed by Cardinal Francis George, Archbishop of Chicago, on 20 July 2003. In March 2020, Archbishop Tadeusz Kondrusiewicz of Minsk-Mohilev, accused the government of using legal pretexts to bar foreign priests from the country, at a time of declining seminary admissions.

Swallows are somewhat similar in habits and appearance to other aerial insectivores, such as the martins (also a passerine) and the swifts (order Apodiformes). It breeds in the Afromontane (from South Africa to Tanzania), wintering north of Lake Victoria. This bird breeds in montane grassland, preferring high rainfall, undulating areas. In winter it prefers open grassland, with bushes and trees. The nest is usually attached to the roof or side of a hole in the ground.BirdLife Species Factsheet Description This species is a small swallow at . The adult birds have a highly lustrous dark metallic steel-blue appearance with long tail streamers, which are particularly noticeable in males. White feathers are visible on the rump and flanks when the birds are preening and especially during courtship. In poor light, blue swallows appear almost black and therefore can be mistaken for black saw-wing swallows (Psalidoprocne spp.) which occur throughout its breeding range. Young blue swallows start life a brownish-grey, acquiring their blue colour as they mature. This species has a musical \\"bee-bee-bee-bee\\" call when in flight.Blue Swallow, Hirundo atrocaerulea BirdLife International (May, 2005). Retrieved 2011-08-24.

In: Hockey, P.A.R. and Dean W.R.J. and Ryan, P.G. (Eds) Roberts Birds of Southern Africa. Seventh Edition. John Voelker Bird Fund, Cape Town. The blue swallow arrives on the breeding range at the end of September and constructs cup-shaped nests from mud and grass on the inside of sinkhole cavities, aardvark burrows and old mine shafts. The breeding system of the blue swallow is not well understood although co- operative breeding has been widely recorded in this species. The nests are lined with fine grass, animal hair and white feathers. Normally, three white eggs are laid. They are incubated by the female for 14 days, and the chicks are fed for approximately 22 days until they fledge. Once fledged, the young spend the next couple of days around the nest site before disappearing. Most blue swallows will rear a second brood before returning to the over-wintering grounds in April. Threats This species is classified as Vulnerable due to destruction of its habitat at both its breeding and wintering sites. The current population is estimated at 1,500-4,000 and decreasing.

In 2004, Hed Kandi made an offer to license and release a full length Late Night Alumni album. ‚ÄúAt that point,‚Äù Finn says, ‚ÄúI knew the band was not ready.

Empty Streets (2005-2008) Empty Streets was released in September, 2005. Around the same time, Hed Kandi was bought out by Ministry of Sound and the album got shelved. However, despite lack of support from the group's record label, it soon grew into an underground classic. The single of the same name received massive support in both clubs and on radio, getting Top Ten Radio Play in the UK and EU, and reaching #1 in Spain. ‚ÄúEmpty Streets‚Äù has also been licensed to commercials including a spot for the Toyota IQ.

It contains the original track, remixes by Max Vangeli and DJ Eco and a reprise of the song. A music video was released on March 16, 2010. A music video for a live rendition of \\"You Can Be The One\\" was recorded at Velour in Utah. It features four violinists along with the four members of Late Night Alumni. Fans are comparing the video to Kaskade's live version of \\"4AM,\\" which also features Becky Jean Williams on lead vocals and Finn Bjarnson on guitar. An acoustic version the song \\"Golden\\" and a live version of their track \\"What's In A Name\\" was also posted on their YouTube channel. Two of their songs, \\"Uncharted\\" and \\"You Can Be the One\\", were featured in the film Crazy, Stupid, Love which was released 29 June 2011. Haunted (2011) Haunted was released as a digital download on February 8, 2011. During the recording process, the group hoped to create a different dynamic by physically working together through most of the process rather than being isolated and using electronic communication methods to collaborate.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9PR1aZefAM&feature;=feedu 2 Days with Late Night Alumni The name of the album was inspired by ideas of being haunted by nostalgia and memories from the past while dealing with change in the present, although the old character of the undisclosed location in Salt Lake City where they recorded may have also influenced the title. Only one single has been released so far, \\"It's Not Happening\\". A music video for the song \\"Main Street\\" was uploaded to YouTube on October 17, 2011. The song \\"In The Ashes\\" was also well received, and is a fan favorite. The Beat Becomes A Sound (2012-2014) The group released their fourth studio album, The Beat Becomes A Sound, through iTunes on January 29, 2013. The first single, \\"Shine\\", was released earlier on September 18, 2012 and the remixes were released later on February 26, 2013. Ultra Records has uploaded the official music video to YouTube on October 3, 2012. Singles after the album's release include \\"Sapphire\\" (May 28, 2013) and the Myon & Shane 54 remix of \\"Every Breath Is Like a Heartbeat\\" (September 3, 2013). Eclipse (2015-Present) The group released their fifth studio album \\"Eclipse\\" on June 6, 2015. The album has elements of electro-house and trance.

Hoodbhoy is also a prominent activist in particular concerned with promotion of freedom of speech, secularism, scientific temper and education in Pakistan. Born and raised in Karachi, Hoodbhoy studied at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology for nine years, where he received degrees in electrical engineering, mathematics and solid- state physics, eventually leading to a PhD in nuclear physics. In 1981, Hoodbhoy went on to conduct post-doctoral research at the University of Washington, before leaving to serve as a visiting professor at the Carnegie Mellon University in 1985. While still a professor at the Quaid-e-Azam University, Hoodbhoy worked as a guest scientist at the International Centre for Theoretical Physics from 1986 to 1994. He remained with the Quaid-e-Azam University until 2010, throughout which he held visiting professorships at MIT, University of Maryland and Stanford Linear Collider. In 2011, Hoodbhoy joined LUMS while also working as a researcher with Princeton University and as copa columnist with the Express Tribune. His contract with LUMS was terminated in 2013 which resulted in a controversy. He is a sponsor of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, and a member of the monitoring panel on terrorism of the World Federation of Scientists. Hoodbhoy has won several awards including the Abdus Salam Prize for Mathematics (1984); the Kalinga Prize for the popularization of science (2003); the Burton Award (2010) from the American Physical Society. In 2011, he was included in the list of 100 most influential global thinkers by Foreign Policy. In 2013, he was made a member of the UN Secretary General's Advisory Board on Disarmament. Hoodbhoy remains one of Pakistan's most prominent academics. He is the author of Islam and Science: Religious Orthodoxy and the Battle for Rationality He is the head of Mashal Books in Lahore, which claims to make \\"a major translation effort to produce books in Urdu that promote modern thought, human rights, and emancipation of women\\". Hoodbhoy has written for Project Syndicate, DAWN, The New York Times and The Express Tribune. Hoodbhoy is generally considered one of the most vocal, progressive and liberal members of the Pakistani intelligentsia. His daughter, Alia Amirali, is also a well-known feminist and political activist. Early life and education Born and raised in Karachi, Sindh, Hoodbhoy passed the competitive O-Level and A-Level exams after attending the famed Karachi Grammar School. After earning a scholarship, Hoodbhoy went to the United States to attend the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). While attending the MIT in Massachusetts, Hoodbhoy worked for a local Pakistani restaurant based in Massachusetts to support his studies and showed a great interest in electronics and mathematics.http://www.newslinemagazine.com/2012/08/interview-dr-pervez- hoodbhoy/ At MIT, Hoodbhoy graduated with double BSc in Electrical Engineering and mathematics in 1971, followed by MS in physics with a concentration in solid-state physics in 1973. After graduation, Hoodbhoy joined the Quaid-e- Azam University (QAU) as a researcher and renewed his scholarship to resume his studies in the United States. Hoodbhoy continued his research in doctoral studies in physics at the MIT, and was awarded PhD in nuclear physics in 1978. In the United States, his collaboration took place with the scientists who participated in well known Manhattan Project in the 1940s, who subsequently influenced in his philosophy. Hoodbhoy remained a post-doctoral research fellow at the University of Washington, for a short time. In 1973, Hoodbhoy joined the Institute of Physics of the University of Engineering and Technology in Lahore. Career = Academia = Hoodbhoy focused his research career extensively on quantum field theory, particle phenomenology, and supersymmetry in the area of particle physics. After receiving PhD from MIT, Hoodbhoy met Riazuddin and Abdus Salam‚Äì the prominent Pakistani physicists who were visiting the MIT to give lectures on particle physics. Subsequently, he joined the group of Pakistani physicists at the International Centre for Theoretical Physics in Trieste, Italy. At ICTP, Hoodbhoy collaborated with Pakistan's leading theoretical physicists who worked under Abdus Salam in the 1970s. After ICTP work, Hoodbhoy returned to Pakistan to join Quaid-e-Azam University (QAU) where he began teaching and lecturing on physics. Eventually, he became chairman of Institute of Theoretical Physics (now department of physics). After spending more than 30 years at Qau, Hoodbhoy moved to Lahore where he joined the Lahore University of Management Sciences as a visiting professor, while remains a visiting scientist at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center. Controversy over his contract in LUMS sparked an academic debate when it was reported in the news media that Hoodbhoy's email to Vice-Chancellor of LUMS was made public. Eventually, Hoodbhoy moved to Forman Christian College University permanently and joined the senior staff to instructed courses on physics. Prior to his return to Pakistan in 1976, the secretive development program on nuclear deterrence was near completion and Hoodbhoy was aware of the program. Hoodbhoy maintains his close ties with Pakistan's vibrant nuclear society, and had collaborated with many of country's leading theoretical physicists throughout his career, mainly with Ishfaq Ahmad. On several occasions, Hoodbhoy staunchly countered Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan's \\"father-of\\" claims, and roundly criticized his academic research on nuclear physics. In the 1980s, he famously debated with Bashiruddin Mahmood on the topics of sunspots, life-after-death, and philosophy.Bergen, Peter L. (2011). \\"¬ßQuixotic Quest\\". The longest war : the enduring conflict between America and al-Qaeda (1st Free Press trade paperback edition) New York: Free Press. . In 1999, Hoodbhoy with Ishfaq Ahmad and Riazuddin, played a major and influential role in the establishment of National Center for Physics (NCP), becoming one of the earliest academic scientists who joined the NCP at its inception. Hoodbhoy has roundly criticized the development on nuclear weapons, especially its extension to South Asia, mainly by India and Pakistan. In 2011, Hoodbhoy held India responsible for Pakistan's symmetric nuclear weapons programme as part of Pakistan's self-credible deterrence. According to Hoodbhoy, India's nuclear tests forced Pakistan to jump into the nuclear arena in 1974, and again in 1998, after war-threatening statements were made by Indian government to Pakistan; Pakistan equalised this magnitude over the nuclear edge that same month. While believing that Pakistan's nuclear deterrence has protected the country from any foreign aggression and preventing from numerous war threatening situations with India, Hoodbhoy on the other hand has raised concerns about the security of nuclear arsenals on the possibility of radicals gaining control. = Activism = Hoodbhoy is a prominent sponsor of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, representing the Pakistan's delegation.CGPACS (2006) 15th Annual Margolis Lecture with Dr. Pervez Hoodbhoy. The Center for Global Peace and Conflict Studies. University of California, Irvine. 12 May. Retrieved on 22 May 2008 Apart from his specialist field of research, Hoodbhoy extensively writes and speaks on topics ranging from science in Islam to education and arms disarmament issues around the world.Hoodbhoy (1998) Talk by Dr. Pervez Hoodbhoy on nuclear tests in the Indian subcontinent. The Alliance, Pakistan Students Society at MIT, and the MIT Program in Science, Technology, and Society. 12 May. Retrieved on 22 May 2008 He is author of Islam and Science: Religious Orthodoxy and the Battle for Rationality, that has been translated into five languages. In this book, Hoodbhoy outlines the history of Pakistan, implications of theocracy and martial law in Pakistan, and the textbook revival in education system of Pakistan. His articles on various issues related to science and social issues are often published in international media. His publications are repeatedly published in both technical and non-technical papers. Pervez Hoodbhoy criticises Pakistani attitudes on \\"blasphemy\\". Hoodbhoy widely writes about the role and modernisation of Pakistan military, particularly the defence budget spending by the Pakistan government on the military. In an interview on secularism, he mentioned that obsession with scientific-religious apophenia may have caused lack of scientific advancement among Muslims in recent years.Pervez Amirali Hoodbhoy: \\"Islam and Science Have Parted Ways\\"; Interview in Middle East Quarterly; Winter 2010, pp. 69‚Äì74, Retrieved 2 March 2012 In 2003 he was one the signers of the Humanist Manifesto. Hoodbhoy criticized the partition of India, calling it an \\"unspeakable tragedy\\" that \\"separated people who at one time could live together in peace\\". Hoodbhoy has criticized the Pakistan Higher Education Commission (HEC) for pursuing \\"a drive to achieve numbers rather than quality\\". He believes that because of \\"policies that reward authors of research articles and PhD supervisors with cash and promotions\\", universities in Pakistan have \\"turned into factories producing junk papers and PhDs.\\" He has been a harsh critic on the performance of HEC since 2003 when it was led by Dr. Atta-ur-Rahman, and the issue has led to heated debates in Pakistan's news media. In 2009 Hoodbhoy came into conflict with Atta-ur-Rahman, an organic chemist, over the Higher Education Commission (HEC). In the United States, the journal Nature published an article on the successes and failures of the HEC. Hoodbhoy wrote to complain about, among other things, the article's failure to mention (what Hoodbhoy called) \\"the billions wasted on mindless prestige mega-projects\\". In the debate on HEC Adil Najam, Abdul Qadeer Khan, and Atta-ur-Rehman defended the HEC while agreeing with some of Hoodbhoy's criticism. Administrative competency of HEC was called into question by Hoodbhoy who describe the HEC's achievement \\"dismal\\". Hoodbhoy supported his arguments against HEC's productivity, that in the case of UESTP-France convention in Karachi, out of an expected faculty strength of between 450 and 600, no French faculty or administrative staff actually arrived. At the television debate, Hoodbhoy questioned the statistics used to support the positive appraisal of HEC's activities in a series of communications between Hoodbhoy and HEC chairman Atta-Ur-Rehman. It was claimed by the latter that in mathematics, Pakistani authors received 20% more citations than the worldwide average. Hoodbhoy questioned this on several grounds including the number of self-citations these publications received and said that this was a crucial aspect that the HEC left out of its interpretation. Criticism was leveled by Hoodbhoy at the practice of hiring those foreign academics in local universities who were said to have difficulty in communicating and teaching, although they contributed to boosting the number of research publications originating from Pakistani universities. = Research = Hoodbhoy has made important contributions in physics, particularly in particle physics. Many of Hoodbhoy's recorded lectures on physics are available online. At National Center for Physics, Hoodbhoy conducted research on different aspects of particle physics, and pioneered studies in modern physics and its extension to mathematical and nuclear physics. In 2006, Hoodbhoy published a brief mathematical description of Generalized Parton Distributions. In 2007, Hoodbhoy re-published the work of Jens Lyng Peterson the Maldacena conjecture (a conjectured equivalence between a string theory and gravity defined on one space, and a quantum field theory without gravity defined by one or less dimension) where he contributed mathematically to the theory. In the same year, he re-published the work of Edward Witten on Anti-de Sitter space and its extension to the field of Holography. While the paper was published experimentally in 1998 by Witten, Hoodbhoy provided the brief mathematical proofs and description to understand, logically, the subject of Sitter space‚Äî a scalar curvature in general theory of relativity. On 14 April 2001, it was announced that Dr. Hoodbhoy would be receiving Sitara-i-Imtiaz from the former President, General (retired) Pervez Musharraf which he refused to accept. His refusal prompted the Friday Times to interview him. = Filmography = He produced a 13-part documentary series in Urdu for Pakistan Television on critical issues in education, and two series aimed at popularising science. In 2004, he made a documentary film 'Crossing the Lines: Kashmir, Pakistan, India' along with Dr. Zia Mian.CGPACS (2006) Crossing the Lines: Kashmir, Pakistan, India These documentaries carry heavy emphasis on the issues of education, public health and scientific revolution in Pakistan. In his documentaries, Dr. Hoodbhoy has heavily criticised Pakistan and India's nuclear weapons program. He also pointed out the seriousness of the Talibanization in Pakistan and its immediate effects on South Asia. His documentaries also point out that American and NATO forces in Afghanistan didn't help the Afghan people's life and there was no reform in Afghanistan's social and public sector and, instead, the insurgency and corruption grew, which also destabilised Pakistan's western front. * Crossing the Lines: Kashmir, Pakistan, India (2004) * The Bell Tolls for Planet Earth (2003) * Pakistan and India Under the Nuclear Shadow (2001) Publications =Books= * Education and the State: Fifty Years Of Pakistan Oxford University Press, 1998. * Islam and Science: Religious Orthodoxy and the Battle for Rationality Zed Books, London, 1992. , (Translations in Arabic, Indonesian, Malaysian, Turkish, Japanese, and Urdu) * (Co-Edited with A.

The Comet crashed into the sea near Elba Island, off the Italian coast, killing all 35 people on board. The aircraft, registered had taken off shortly before from Ciampino Airport in Rome, en route to Heathrow Airport in London, on the final leg of its flight from Singapore. G-ALYP was the third Comet built. Its loss marked the second in a series of three fatal accidents involving the Comet in less than twelve months, all caused by structural failures; it followed the crash of BOAC Flight 783 near Calcutta, India, in May 1953, and was followed by the loss of South African Airways Flight 201 in April 1954, which crashed in circumstances similar to BOAC 781 after departing from Ciampino Airport. Crew and passengers The flight was commanded by Captain Alan Gibson DFC, age 31, one of BOAC's youngest pilots. He had joined BOAC in 1946, after flying in the Royal Air Force during World War II. He had considerable flying experience, having logged more than 6,500 flight hours. He had previously been involved in an accident in 1951, in which a Hermes aircraft was forced to make an emergency landing, and he was later praised for his flying conduct during this accident flight. The First Officer on Flight 781 was William John Bury, age 33. He had flown a total of approximately 4,900 hours. The Engineer Officer was Francis Charles Macdonald, age 27, and the Radio Officer was Luke Patrick McMahon, age 32. They had logged 720 flying hours and close to 3,600 flying hours, respectively. Ten of the 29 passengers were children. Among the casualties were Chester Wilmot, a prominent Australian journalist and military historian working for the BBC, and Dorothy Beecher Baker, a Hand of the Cause of God for the Bah√° º√≠ Faith. Flight and accident Gerry Bull, a former BOAC engineer, said that when he performed a preflight inspection of the aircraft in Rome he looked for \\"incidental damage\\", and as he did not find any, he believed the Comet was fit for flight. Bull and the same team of engineers later examined South African Airways Flight 201 before its final flight.\\"Comet Air Crash\\" (\\"Crash of the Comet\\"). Seconds From Disaster. Flight 781 departed from Rome at 10:31 CET (09:31 UTC) on 10 January 1954, bound for the final stage of its flight to London. At about 10:50 CEST, a BOAC Argonaut, registration G-ALHJ, piloted by Captain Johnson, which was flying the same route at a lower altitude, was in contact with Captain Gibson. During a radio communication about weather conditions, the conversation was abruptly cut off. The last words heard from Gibson were \\"George How Jig, from George Yoke Peter, did you get my‚Äî\\". Soon afterwards, witnesses saw wreckage falling into the sea. Heathrow Airport initially listed Flight 781 as being delayed, but it was removed from the arrivals board at around 1:30 pm. Search and recovery On 11 January 1954, The New York Times reported that \\"35 persons were almost certainly killed when a British Comet jet airliner crashed into the sea ... between the islands of Elba and Montecristo, off the Italian western coast.\\" Bodies had been recovered late into the night, and although the search had continued in the freezing water, there was little hope of finding any survivors. The official passenger list was yet to be released, but it was believed that there were no Americans on board the plane. The task of finding out what had happened to Flight 781 was difficult at first because the accident had occurred over water. In 1954, there were no cockpit voice recorders or flight data recorders (the so-called \\"black boxes\\") to assist crash investigators, and there existed no established protocol for aircraft accident investigation at the time. An extensive search for the aircraft was organised, which included the Royal Navy ships HMS Barhill and HMS Gambia as well as the Maltese civilian salvage vessel Sea Salvor. The search effort involved the pioneering use of underwater TV cameras, developed by a team at the UK Admiralty Research Laboratory led by George MacNeice, to help to locate and salvage the wreckage in deep water. Witnesses to the crash were a group of Italian fishermen who rushed to the scene to recover the bodies and to search for possible survivors, of which there were none. The aircraft wreckage was eventually found on the sea floor; it was subsequently raised and transported to the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE) for investigation. Initial findings and reaction To find more evidence concerning the cause of the crash, the bodies were brought to the coroner for post-mortem. During the examination, pathologist Antonio Fornari found broken and damaged limbs, which had apparently occurred after death. He also discovered in most of the victims a distinct pattern of injuries, consisting of fractured skulls and ruptured and otherwise damaged lungs, which he identified as the actual cause of death. Fornari was confused by the pattern of injuries because he could find no evidence of an explosion. The ruptured lungs were a sure indicator that the air cabin had depressurised, because the sudden decrease in pressure would have caused the lungs to expand until they ruptured. To support this theory, and also to confirm the cause of the skull fractures, the crash was simulated at the RAE in Farnborough by reproducing the conditions of the actual plane prior to the crash. To make this possible, a model fuselage was constructed that was similar to that of the Comet. Dummies were seated within the fuselage to replicate the possible movements of the passengers during the crash. In order to simulate the crash, the investigators deliberately ruptured the model fuselage by increasing the air pressure inside until it exploded. The movement of the dummies within the air cabin revealed the cause of the skull fractures: at the moment that the fuselage exploded, they were thrown out of their seats and slammed head-first into the ceiling. Upon examination of the aircraft wreckage by the RAE, it became evident that the aircraft had broken up in mid- air, and there was initially some speculation that the aircraft might have been brought down by a bomb. Suspicion then shifted to the possibility of an engine turbine explosion, and modifications were instigated in other Comets, where the turbine ring was encased with armour plate to contain a possible disintegration of the turbine disk. The possibility of failure of the pressure cabin was also considered, but this theory was discounted because the Comet's cabin had been designed to a considerably higher strength than was considered necessary at the time. In the meantime, all Comets were to be grounded until the turbine modifications had been carried out. The New York Times reported on 12 January that BOAC had temporarily withdrawn all of their de Havilland Comet jet airliners from service, as a result of the crash, and that the two French airlines that used the Comet‚ÄîAir France and Union Aero Maritime des Transports‚Äîhad also suspended their Comet services. BOAC had confirmed that their Comet routes would be flown with alternative aircraft to minimise the disruption to the service schedule. The airline emphasized that the planes had not been officially grounded by the British government, but that the action was being taken as \\"a measure of prudence to enable a minute and unhurried technical examination of every aircraft in the Comet fleet to be carried out at maintenance headquarters at London airport.\\" While the official investigation efforts began, BOAC were determined to return their Comets to passenger service as soon as possible, and succeeded in doing so on 23 March, just ten weeks after the crash. BOAC's chairman commented on television, \\"We obviously wouldn't be flying the Comet with passengers if we weren't satisfied conditions were suitable.\\" However, a second BOAC de Havilland Comet, registered G-ALYY, was lost on 8 April 1954: a charter flight, operating as South African Airways Flight 201, departed from Rome bound for Egypt with fourteen passengers and seven crew on board; thirty-three minutes into the flight the pilot reported on course flying at 10,000 metres, then all contact was lost. Sir Arnold Hall, a Cambridge University scholar and scientist and then-head of the RAE, was appointed as the head accident investigator. Original investigation The recovered (shaded) parts of the wreckage of G-ALYP and the site (arrowed) of the failure. Initial examination and reconstruction of the wreckage of G-ALYP revealed several signs of inflight break-up: *Shreds of cabin carpet were found trapped in the remains of the Comet's tail section *The imprint of a coin was found on a fuselage panel from the rear of the aircraft *Smears and scoring on the rear fuselage were tested and found to be consistent to the paint applied to the passenger seats of the Comet With most of the wreckage recovered, investigators found that fractures started in the roof of the cabin, a window then smashed into the elevators, the rear fuselage then tore away, the outer wing structure fell, then the outer wing tips and finally the cockpit broke away and fuel from the wings set the debris on fire. To find out what caused the first failure, BOAC donated G-ALYU (\\"Yoke Uncle\\") for testing. The airframe was put in a large water tank, the tank was filled, and water was pumped into the plane to simulate flight conditions. The experiment was run 24 hours per day, 7 days per week. It could possibly have taken as long as five months. Official findings concerning BOAC Flight 781 and South African Airways Flight 201 were released jointly on 1 February 1955, in Civil Aircraft Accident Report of the Court of Inquiry into the Accidents to Comet G-ALYP on 10 January 1954 and Comet G-ALYY on 8 April 1954. After the equivalent of 3,000 flights simulated with G-ALYU, investigators at the RAE were able to conclude that the crash of G-ALYP had been due to failure of the pressure cabin at the forward ADF window in the roof. This window was one of two apertures for the aerials of an electronic navigation system in which opaque fibreglass panels took the place of the window glass. The failure was a result of metal fatigue caused by the repeated pressurisation and de-pressurisation of the aircraft cabin. Another fact was that the supports around the windows were riveted, not glued, as the original specifications for the aircraft had called for. The problem was exacerbated by the punch rivet construction technique employed. Unlike drill riveting, the imperfect nature of the hole created by punch riveting caused manufacturing defect cracks, which may have caused fatigue cracks to start around the rivet. The investigators examined the final piece of wreckage with a microscope. The fuselage roof fragment of G-ALYP showing the two ADF 'windows', on display in the Science Museum in London. Effects of the disaster and findings The Comet's pressure cabin had been designed to a safety factor comfortably in excess of that required by British Civil Airworthiness Requirements (BCAR)‚Äîthe requirement was 1.33 times P with an ultimate load of 2 times P (where P is the cabin's \\"Proof\\" pressure), but the safety factor used in the Comet was 2.5 times P‚Äîhence the accident led to revised estimates for the safe loading strength requirements of airliner pressure cabins. In addition, it was discovered that the stresses around pressure cabin apertures were considerably higher than had been anticipated, particularly around sharp-cornered cut-outs, such as square windows. As a result, future jet airliners would feature windows with rounded corners, the purpose of the curve being to eliminate a stress concentration. This was a noticeable distinguishing feature of all later models of the Comet.

The station plays classic hits from the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s. WWBB's offices and studios are located on Oxford Street in Providence, Rhode Island, United States, on the 3rd and 4th floors of the Roland Building near Interstate 95. WWBB's transmitting antenna is located on the roof of One Financial Plaza, also in Providence. WWBB transmits a directional signal to reduce interference to Boston-based sister station 101.7/WBWL.http://www.fccinfo.com/CMDProEngine.php?sCurrentService=FM&tabSearchType;=Appl&sAppIDNumber;=75052 The station is owned by iHeartMedia, Inc..

History WWBB's history dates back to May 30, 1955 when it began broadcasting in Providence as WTMH. These call letters reflected the initials of its owner, T. Mitchell Hastings. In 1958, Hastings reorganized his General Broadcasting Corporation as Concert Network, Inc., and changed the call letters to WXCN. As a Concert Network affiliate, it broadcast classical music, as part of a chain, including stations in New York City, Boston, and Hartford, all including CN in their callsigns.Billboard Jun 30, 1958, p. 6 The station was sold in 1963, and after another change in ownership the following year, it became WCRQ. By the late 1960s, the station changed owners again, becoming WLKW-FM, a sister station of AM 990 WLKW. For two decades as WLKW-FM, it aired a Beautiful Music format, often the top FM station in Providence. In 1987, the station was sold. Two years later, the easy listening format was dropped and WLKW-FM became the WWBB. The station switched to Oldies at Noon on December 26, 1989, playing a mix of hits from the 1950s and 1960s. In the 1990s, some hits from the 1970s were added, and fewer '50s songs were heard. As the 21st century dawned, WWBB adjusted its playlist. Music from the 1950s was phased out. More music from the 1970s began to appear, and in March 2003, the slogan changed from \\"Good Times And Great Oldies\\" to \\"Big Hits Of The 60s And 70s\\". It was around this time, that former program director Bill Hess re-positioned the station as \\"Big Hits, B101.\\" Since 2005, hits from the 1980s were added to the playlist, with fewer ‚Äò60s songs included. Over the years, the number of songs in rotation has shrunk from approximately 1,500 to 650. In 2013, WWBB's slogan was changed to \\"Southern New England's '70s and '80s Hits.\\" In 2018, The slogan was once again changed to \\"The ‚Äò80s and More,\\" focusing on '80s music with a moderate amount of '70s hits and very few (if any) songs from the 1960s. The station has included some '90s songs recently. Signal reduction and coverage change On August 6, 2014, Clear Channel (now iHeartMedia) filed a \\"contingent application\\" with the U.S. Federal Communications Commission covering adjacent stations 101.7 WBWL in Lynn, Massachusetts and 101.9 WCIB in Falmouth, Massachusetts to improve WBWL's coverage in the Boston area. Boston is a much larger radio market than Providence, so boosting WBWL's signal would improve its advertising and revenue potential, despite the reduced coverage for WWBB and WCIB. The application called for downgrading WWBB's signal from a \\"Class B\\" (50,000-watt equivalent) to a \\"Class A\\" (6,000-watt equivalent) and using a directional signal away from Boston. The application also called for the relocation of WWBB antenna to the roof of a building in downtown Providence, a further step in reducing its coverage outside Providence and its suburbs. The application was granted October 6, 2014.https://licensing.fcc.gov/cgi- bin/ws.exe/prod/cdbs/forms/prod/cdbsmenu.hts?context=25&appn;=101643771&formid;=301&fac;_num=54568 WWBB completed the facility change in January 2015, and changed to the new facility on February 2, 2015.http://licensing.fcc.gov/cgi- bin/ws.exe/prod/cdbs/pubacc/prod/app_det.pl?Application_id=1662938 HD radio Upon the signal reduction, HD digital service continued but the iHeart-provided comedy programming service (known as \\"Joke Joke\\") on WWBB-HD2 was discontinued and WWBB instead only simulcast its main analog feed into HD digital via WWBB-HD1.

Ju Ming was trained as a woodcarver, apprenticed to Lee Chinchuan as a teenager. He developed his skill and applied it to a range of media, including bronze, styrofoam, ceramics, and stainless steel. In 1959, he moved back to Tunghsiao and opened his own studio with apprentices, creating a successful crafts business which left him dissatisfied. He became more artistic and tried innovative techniques. Ju married Chen Fu-mei, also from Tunghsiao, three years later. After winning several awards in the prestigious Taiwan Provincial Art Exhibition, Ju felt that he could only develop further as a sculptor if he re-apprenticed himself, this time to Yang Yuyu, who himself had only just returned from a three-year art scholarship in Rome. Yang agreed, impressed by \\"Ju's flowing lines through the natural grain of the wood, the form executed with such an assured gentleness and humility.\\" In 1976, Ju took up T'ai chi on Yang's advice to develop physical and mental discipline.\\"Ju Ming: Sculptor of Form and Spirit\\" in Taijiquan Journal Spring 2002, p. 12-17. He developed greatly from this practice and started thinking about sculpting works on the theme of T'ai chi, which had never been done before. Ju's solo exhibition occurred in March at the National Museum of History in Taipei due to Yang Yu- yu convincing the museum authorities to show his student's pieces. It was highly successful and he was named as one of the Ten Outstanding Youths of 1976. From 1980, Ju continued to gain international acclaim and exhibited abroad. He started The Living World \\"family\\" which he continues to expand. These bright figures are made of bronze, stainless steel, painted wood, foam rubber and cast bronze, giving him freedom to depict the human form in all its varieties. Another is his Living World series, depicting figures drawn from a modern, westernized society. Much of Ju Ming's work is housed at the Ju Ming Museum, just outside Taipei. The museum was built at the artist's expense, and is open to the public. He was awarded the 18th Fukuoka Asian Culture Prize in 2007.  Backgrounds and early life  Ju Ming was born in Tongxiao, Shinchiku Prefecture, Japanese-era Taiwan. His father is Ju Li Chi and his mother is Wang Ai. His original name is Ju Chuan Tai. As the youngest in his family, his childhood nickname is Jiu Er (‰πù‰∫å), which means ninety-two in English, to dedicate his parents‚Äô added up ages is 92 when he was born. Ju Ming was apprenticed to a local woodcarver, Lee Chin-chuan from the Temple of the Empress of Heaven when Ju was 15. He learned about woodcarving and painting during his apprenticeship, which set the foundation for his future career as a sculptor. Ju Ming mentioned that during that period, he did woodcarving during the days and practiced painting during the nights. He recalled that Lee Chin- chuan's saying, ‚ÄúIf a sculptor does not know how to paint, it is like an architect who can build houses but does not know how to do blueprint design drawings.‚Äù He believes if a sculptor wants to carve well, he or she has to know and do many sketches, and most importantly not just copying other people's style; otherwise, the person is just an artisan, not an artist. In 1959, Ju finished his apprenticeship and opened his own studio. He developed more carving experience and sharpened his carving skills through the crafts business. In 1961, Ju married Chem Fu-mei who is the model of one of Ju's famous sculptures, A Girl Playing Sand (Áé©Ê≤ôÁöÑÂ•≥Â≠©). He further started to develop his innovative techniques and to explore different artistic approaches. He also started to participate in art competitions and then won several awards in the prestigious Taiwan Provincial Art Exhibitions such as 1966's work Attractive to Each Other (Áõ∏ÊÇÖ) and next year's Long Separation (‰πÖÂà•).  Artworks  = Living World series ‚Äì Imprisonment = Imprisonment, the sculptural set created in 2009. The piece is made by stainless steel. Sculpted with Ju Ming's signature style, blocky and minimalist, the figures are reduced to the basic forms intentionally to embrace the inner spiritual qualities within the human bodies. The sculpture consists of steel cages and inside is two life-size figures carved in Styrofoam facing each other. The title of the series Living World suggests that the works are based on the artist's observation and reflection on people's contemporary life. The sculptures are the depiction of the world where people situated within. These are the examination of the human figures and even further reveal what are inside the human forms. Unlike the previous Living World series that the human figures are in different shades of colours, Imprisonments colour palette is narrowed down to balck and white monotone. Its minimalist quality evokes the fundamental part of human quality- good and evil- with its connotation of a self-contained realm. Black-and-white usually associates with opposite meanings. It also forms a pair in a number of contexts through cultural history. In Ju Ming's work, the White symbolizes the goodness as opposed to the Black associates with viciousness. The monochrome in Imprisonment can simply be viewed as the connection with the classic black-and-white striped on prisoner's uniform. However, it also connotes the Chinese yin-yang philosophy that good and evil within the human nature in fact are interrelated to one another. In Ju's concept, there is no existence of pure innate good and pure innate evil. Human kinds are combination of two qualities. One's value as a person is rooted in one's very self. Good and evil, black and white, could be interconnected or interdependent. The choices people make in their life define their qualities. Through the sculptural set which symbolizes the ideas of ‚Äúimprisoning others, being imprisoned by others, and self-imprisonment‚Äù, the artists demonstrates that the subtle distinction between freedom and limit are in fact controlled by one's thoughts of prisoning. The cage of the sculptures is locked from the inside with the key inside the lock. The figures inside the cage eventually could have freed themselves. The scenario shows that people are in fact self-imposed to be locked. Though life are more complicated and interconnected and cannot be simply defined to binary choices; the artist just tries to point out that lock or unlock, freedom or limit, good or evil are actually done by human's own choices. The Chinese character (Âõö), stands for imprison, is compound with the character for human (‰∫∫) in the middle of a cube surrounded by four walls (Âõó). Ju Ming used the literal and external form of a cage to represent the inner spiritual dimension of the idea of restraint of men. With the physical presentation of limit of freedom, Ju wants to point out that the invisible prison in our society. These prisons could be the norms of culture, the laws of institution, the confined architectural spaces of urban city, the curriculums of education, as well as the deep, rooted system thinking of humanity as whole. Ju Ming reproduced the humanity's cages and exploring our relationships with the cages we build. Awards and honors * 1966- Attractive to Each Other.

Planning and construction A water user's association was formed to promote the dam in 1916, and surveying began in 1921. In 1924 the states of Texas and New Mexico agreed to allow construction, and in 1926 President Calvin Coolidge approved the plan. In 1927 the Red Bluff Water Control District was formed to manage the project from seven existing water districts. In 1934 the loan for construction was approved by the Public Works Administration.

Its transmitter is located in Johnston, Rhode Island, while its studios are located in East Providence. It broadcasts a Hot AC-leaning adult contemporary format. History The Providence Journal Bulletin applied for a construction permit for new FM station in 1944. The station was originally to operate in the old FM band on 46.9 MHz. The construction permit was finally issued in 1947 with a frequency of 105.1 MHz in the new FM band.WWLI's FCC history card; retrieved January 9, 2019. The station began broadcasting July 11, 1948 as WPJB, owned by The Providence Journal. WPJB was initially one of the few FM stations to not be co-owned with an AM station, but in 1951 the Journal purchased WFCI (1420 AM) and changed its call letters to WPJB; this resulted in the FM station changing to WPJB-FM. The Journal would shut down WPJB on October 9, 1954 after purchasing WEAN (790 AM; now WPRV) from General Teleradio; as WEAN did not operate an FM station, WPJB-FM remained on the air with classical music, though both stations retained their existing call letters. The station subsequently incorporated beautiful music into its programming as well. WPJB-FM became a top 40 station, \\"JB 105\\", on August 1, 1975, a change promoted in The Providence Journal the week before; the station's classical music library was donated to the Providence College radio station, WDOM, a year later. The station initially used an early version of a format developed by Mike Joseph that eventually became known as Hot Hits (branded as \\"Big Hits\\" on WPJB), though it phased out most aspects of this format by 1977. WPJB saw some ratings success when rival WPRO-FM began taking a more adult-focused approach in 1980, boosting its teen listenership; however, by the end of the year, WPRO-FM's ratings began to recover, and WPJB began making changes to its format. Initially, at the start of 1981, the station moved to more of a rock-based direction, but after WHJY adopted an album rock format in September, WPJB abruptly backed away from this emphasis. The following year, the station began shifting to an adult contemporary format; that November, WPJB stopped including a top-35 chart in The Providence Journal, and in 1983 the \\"JB 105\\" branding was dropped. WPJB again shifted closer to top 40 in August 1984. The Providence Journal sold WPJB-FM and WEAN to Eastern Broadcasting Corporation in 1985. Eastern placed less emphasis on the WPJB call letters that April; on June 13, the station began to announce that \\"WPJB is dead!\\", and after a period of stunting, it adopted a soft adult contemporary format, \\"Lite 105\\", on June 14, with the call letters changing to WWLI. Eastern Broadcasting was bought by Tele-Media in 1989; four years later, Tele-Media bought former rival WPRO-FM and its AM sister station. Tele-Media, in turn, sold its stations to Citadel Broadcasting in 1997. WWLI soon moved to a mainstream adult contemporary format, and changed its branding to \\"Lite Rock 105\\" in 2001. In 2007, the format was freshened to include more 1980s, 1990s and current songs, while dropping some songs from the 1970s. By the end of 2008, longtime afternoon host Charlie Jefferds left the station and live weekend hosts were eliminated in a cost- cutting measure. In November 2010, mid-day host Tanya Cruise left the station in light of personal affairs. Citadel merged with Cumulus Media on September 16, 2011. On November 4, 2011, NiteLite host Art Spencer was released after 18 years as the station's evening host, per budget cuts ordered by new owner, Cumulus. Since 2012, the format has leaned more in the direction of Hot Adult Contemporary. In December 2013, the new \\"Heather and Steve\\" morning show debuted (former host David Jones exited in November 2013), and in February 2014, \\"Intelligence for Your Life with John Tesh\\" was added. In October 2014, Lite Rock's \\"2 Lite Chicks\\" (Heather Gersten and Amy Pontes) debuted the \\"Wicked Awesome 80's (sic) Show.\\" It airs on Saturday nights. Lite Rock 105 is also known as \\"The Christmas Station,\\" going all Christmas music November thru the end of the year.

Architecture St. Mary's Cathedral was designed by the renowned English architect Augustus Welby Pugin, who is said to have gained inspiration from the ruins of Ardfert Cathedral \\"which is particularly evident in the slender triple lancets in the east and west walls\\".Killarney Chamber of Tourism & Commerce, St. Mary's Cathedral, accessed 13 May 2019 Construction began in 1842 but was not continuous. The great famine and the lack of available funds meant the work was stopped several times; when work recommenced in 1853, the interior decorations were designed by James Joseph McCarthy. In 1855 the building was ready for regular worship. Separately the spire and nave were completed in 1907 by the Irish architects Ashlin and Coleman of Dublin, who had designed Cobh Cathedral.http://www.thepuginsociety.co.uk/killarney.html The width of the nave was based on the medieval models to be found throughout Ireland and England. The west end is very Irish in character, with three tall lancet windows and a very low entrance door beneath. The stonework used is an attractive mixture of brown and grey stone. The siting of the church is more like the siting of a priory than the siting of a cathedral, as the cathedral stands in a huge field instead of in the middle of the original settlement of Killarney. In 1973 the cathedral was \\"reordered' under the direction of Bishop Eamonn Casey. Many of the original interior features were removed or damaged and this renovation is regarded by some as controversial.https://www.irishtimes.com/news/social-affairs/religion-and- beliefs/obituary-eamonn-casey-1.3008779 A flavour of the scale of the change envisioned by the architect Ray Carroll is given in this assessment: \\"the greatest single change was the removal of all the internal Victorian plasterwork. The original reredos, altar and screens were removed, the floor of the crossing was raised to the level of the former sanctuary, and a new sanctuary was created at the crossing. A new altar, pulpit, throne and chairs, all made of Tasmanian oak, were installed.\\" http://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WMAFG8_St_Marys_Cathedral_Killarney_County_Kerry_Ireland File:Cathedral organ of killarney by paride.jpgOrgan File:Window of Killarney Cathedral by Paride.jpgWindow File:Left chapel of the cathedral of killerney by paride.jpgLeft chapel References Bibliography *Peter Galloway, The Cathedrals of Ireland, The Institute of Irish Studies, The Queen's University of Belfast, 1992 Category:Roman Catholic churches in County Kerry Category:Roman Catholic cathedrals in the Republic of Ireland Category:Roman Catholic Diocese of Kerry Category:Augustus Pugin buildings Category:19th- century Roman Catholic church buildings in Europe Category:Roman Catholic churches completed in 1855 ","title":"St Mary's Cathedral, Killarney"},{"id":"3686309","text":"Action Blast! was an American animated television children's television series program block shown on the American cable and satellite channel, G4 in the 8am ET hour.

As early as 1976, Vanderhoof was ardently networking with local musicians in his hometown of Aberdeen, Washington, and had formed a band called Tyr, which included Kirk Arrington on drums and Vanderhoof on rhythm guitar. In 1978 he joined Seattle hardcore punk band The Lewd, adopting the stage name \\"Blobbo\\" and playing bass guitar, switching to guitar the following year. The Lewd relocated from Seattle to San Francisco in 1980. After his departure from The Lewd, Vanderhoof formed Metal Church, whose name was inspired by a nickname given to his San Francisco apartment. He later moved back to Aberdeen, with a vinyl single of \\"Kill Yourself\\" as proof of his time with the Lewd. In the summer of 1982, he formed a heavy metal cover band named Shrapnel. It consisted of Tom Weber on drums, Duke Erickson on bass (both from Hoquiam), Mike Murphey (\\"muff\\", from Montesano) and a guitar player Vanderhoof had jammed with at high school in Aberdeen. Shrapnel played four events to warm up, including a party at Pacific Lutheran University, after which the other guitar player quit, having had a religious experience and being unwilling to cover The Number of The Beast by Iron Maiden. His place was taken by Craig Wells of Aberdeen, and Weber was eventually replaced by Kirk Arrington (also from Hoquiam) on drums. When Murphey left the band, they recruited David Wayne for vocal duties. By 1983, Shrapnel had renamed itself under Vanderhoof's original band name, Metal Church. After Metal Church's second album The Dark in 1986, Vanderhoof left the band but nevertheless remained heavily involved in the songwriting process.Metal Church at No Life 'Til Metal His first solo band was Hall Aflame, which only released one album before breaking up in 1994. Metal Church disbanded that same year. Vanderhoof formed another solo band, Vanderhoof. This band released the albums Vanderhoof and A Blur in Time in 1997 and 2002 respectively. In 2005, Vanderhoof and several members from his solo band formed Presto Ballet, a band dedicated to recreating the progressive rock sounds of the mid 1970s. They released their debut album Peace Among the Ruins that same year, with Vanderhoof commenting: \\"We recorded the whole album in a somewhat 'old-school' manner, which means analogue synthesizers, real Hammond organ and real mellotron sounds\\".

It is also the seat of the judicial district that covers the localities of Moral de Calatrava, Santa Cruz de Mudela, Viso del Marqu√©s, Torrenueva, Castellar de Santiago and Almuradiel.  Geography  Satellite view of Valdepe√±as Its name means \\"Valley of Rocks\\", because it is located in a wide hilly area surrounded by a meander of the , just bordering on the plain south of La Mancha, and the subsoil is rich in limestone rock. It is located in the Campo de Calatrava, an extensive plain north of the Sierra Morena, and lies on the left bank of Jabal√≥n River, a tributary of the Guadiana. The hamlet (pedan√≠a) of Consolaci√≥n is a dependency of Valdepe√±as and is located at the intersection between Autov√≠a A-4 (Autovia del Sur) and road CR-5214. It was built by the Instituto Nacional de Colonizaci√≥n in 1949.  History  = Prehistory = The municipal area houses numerous prehistoric remains, platforms and watchtowers located in the hills, compatible with settlers of the Bronze Age called Culture of the Motillas, dated between the 10th and 13th centuries BC. Vasco Merlo in his History of Valdepe√±as Fernando Vasco Merlo, Historia de Valdepe√±as. described these structures erroneously as Celtiberian settlements, despite their being much older than that and possibly belonging to the Culture of Argar. = Ancient history = Archaeological iberian ensemble of Cerro Cabezas in Valdepe√±as. Eight kilometres to the south of the city is located the Iberian city of \\"Cerro de las Cabezas\\" (Hill of the Heads), a great oppidum or town fortified with a true castle in the summit of the hill that it occupies, inhabited between the 7th and 2nd centuries BC. It is an important archaeological deposit of the Oretana Culture and shows signs of the first vestige of the grapevine in this region. In the 16th century and later artefacts such as graves, coins and other ancient Roman items, from a Roman villa of the 1st century BC, that still existed in the Visigothic period. = Middle Ages = During the Middle Ages period the area was part of the Moorish taifa of Toledo. The Arab inscriptions and a sun dial on the walls of the Church of the Assumption date from this period. According to oral tradition, the Caliphate gave permission to the inhabitants to cultivate vineyards and make wine, which is prohibited by the Quran. The Moors were expelled from Valdepenas at the end of the 15th century. Veracruz Hermitage By order of Queen Berenguela of Castile and after the battle of Las Navas de Tolosa in 1212, settlers of several villages (Aberturas, Corral Rubio de Jabal√≥n, Santa Mar√≠a de las Flores and Castilnuevo) moved to the area around the present Church of the Assumption, which had been an old castle. From that moment Valdepe√±as belonged to the military Order of Calatrava and the first text it is mentioned in is the record of The Order of Calatrava in 1243. The new settlers came from the Kingdoms of Castile, Le√≥n (Galicia mainly) and Arag√≥n. The Order demanded conditions of establishment and right of citizenship, the continued care of the grapevine. In medieval times the Jewish community became important and this is reflected in the existence at least two synagogues, one of which was eventually converted into the hermitage of Veracruz and the old building where the Parish of The Christ was located, behind its present location. =Early modern age= Trinitarians Convent (16th century). The Catholic Monarchs, Ferdinand and Isabella of Castille, lodged in Valdepe√±as on 18 February 1488 at the mother of Alfonso de Merlo's house, and left to the care of the widow the infants during part of the conquest of Granada. The same Alfonso de Merlo was named Captain and went with more than two hundred men to the Conquest of Granada, funding the campaign with his own money. The Catholic Monarchs recognized and granted him the title of Knight. Some of his descendants moved to the New World and took important positions in Peru and Chile.Fernando Vasco Merlo, Historia de Valdepe√±as, and also in \\"El Memorial de Don Alonso Merlo de la Fuente\\" (Noviembre, 1650) . Work of Arturo Gir√°ldez (print in ‚Äúe Humanista Volume 07, 2006‚Äù). University of the Pacific. About manuscript held in the British Library. Currently diverse religious and civil buildings from the 16th century such as the Trinitarians Covent can be found in the town. King Ferdinand the Catholic wanted to control the power of Military Orders, and Pope Adrian VI granted orders to the Kingdom of Castile, passing to Royal Jurisdiction an important patrimony: two cities, two hundred villas (Valdepe√±as among them) and a hundred of villages, distributed in an ample territory. King Philip II sold the villa on 22 April 1575 to D. Alvaro de Baz√°n first Marquess of Santa Cruz, who became Lord of Valdepe√±as. Valdepe√±as would happen to be a \\"Se√±or√≠o\\", secreting itself of the Order of Calatrava. The successive marquesses promoted the wines of Valdepe√±as in the Spanish Court of the Austrian and its fame consequently extended all over the country. Valdepe√±as' \\"clarete\\" became known as \\"aloque\\" at this time. = Contemporary history = La Galana. Valdepe√±as led a quiet existence until 6 June 1808, when Napoleon's occupation of Spain became an issue after the events of 2 May in Madrid of that year. Napoleon's troops went to Andalusia as reinforcements and attempted to cross the villa; the entire population (men, women and also some of the neighbouring villas) took up arms to prevent the passage of the troops. The result was a high number of lives lost and a major fire. Highlighted in the fight was a woman, Juana Gal√°n \\"La Galana\\". The outcome was that the troops had to retreat from the province of La Mancha, a delay which led, at least in part, to the Spanish victory at the Battle of Bailen. King Fernando VII would give the villa the Title of \\"Very Heroic\\". After these events some inhabitants from Valdepe√±as took part of the guerrilla fighting against the Napoleonic troops in the \\"Guerra de la Independencia\\", Francisco Abad, \\"Chaleco\\", became a famous guerrillero. Spain Square. Valdepe√±as festival, 2007. At the beginning of the 20th century, the appearance of Phylloxera led to the introduction of the resistant American vine but did not change the economy much. The Spanish Civil War broke this development, and the city's population decreased. From the 1940s to the 1970s the only economical activities were agriculture and the traditional family industry of wine, a common phenomenon of central Spain in these times. In the 1980s, Valdepe√±as saw a modernization of the wine sector, including new kinds of grapes, and the introduction of techniques in wine production.  Culture  Valdepe√±as has several museums of history, art and wine. There are two Fairs, in August \\"the summer fair\\" at the first week and in September known as \\"Fiesta de la Vendimia\\" (Grape Harvest Fair).

Reeves is remembered for his move of the Rams from Cleveland to Los Angeles in 1946, where it became the first American major league sports franchise on the Pacific Coast. He was also the first NFL owner to sign an African-American player in the post World War II era, inking deals with halfback Kenny Washington and end Woody Strode in 1946, as well as being the first to employ a full-time scouting staff. Reeves was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1967. Early years Born in New York City to Irish immigrants James Reeves and Rose Farrell, Reeves' father and an uncle, Daniel, had risen together from fruit peddlers to owners of a grocery-store chain, bringing wealth to the family.Wendy Kagan, Dan Reeves Biography: Brought First Major Team To West Coast, Hired Coach George Allen, Chronology, Awards And Accomplishments,\\" Famous Sports Stars encyclopedia, sports.jrank.org/ Reeves was a graduate of the Newman School in Lakewood, New Jersey, and attended Georgetown University in Washington, D.C., which he left before acquiring his degree. While attending Georgetown, Reeves met his future wife, Mary V. Corroon. The couple were married on October 25, 1935 and would together have six children. The Reeves family's grocery chain was sold to Safeway Stores in 1941, generating capital and freeing the youthful Dan Reeves, age 29, to pursue his dream of owning a professional football franchise. Purchase of Cleveland Rams Together with his friend and business partner Robert Levy, Reeves purchased the Cleveland Rams franchise in 1941 from a local ownership group for $135,000.Tom Reed, \\"How Moving a Franchise from Cleveland to L.A. Benefited the Browns and Fostered Social Change,\\" Cleveland Plain Dealer, www.cleveland.com, Feb. 3, 2014. The team was a comparatively young one, launched in 1936, and finances were tight, with as few as 200 season ticket holders and no television revenue, forcing some players to work for as little as $100 per game. The team did not operate in , and Reeves became the sole owner in December, while serving stateside in the U.S. Army Air Forces. Despite its financial woes, the previously unsuccessful franchise began to turn around in 1944; the Rams won Western division title in 1945 and the championship game behind rookie quarterback and league MVP Bob Waterfield, a future member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame.\\"Bob Waterfield: Biography,\\" Pro Football Hall of Fame, www.profootballhof.com/ Move to Los Angeles Immediately following the conclusion of the season, with its championship game played in icy Cleveland before 32,000 fans on December 15, Reeves announced his intention to move his team to sunny southern California, and the league approved the move on January 12, 1946. On January 15, Rams team representatives went before the Los Angeles Coliseum Commission with a plan to lease use of the facility for home games ‚Äî it was already the home venue for college football for both UCLA and USC of the Pacific Coast Conference.\\"Rams to Go After Coliseum Lease,\\" San Mateo Times, vol. 35, no. 13 (Jan. 15, 1946), pg. 7. On January 23, the Coliseum Commission approved use of the 103,000-seat stadium for Rams' Sunday home games during the 1946 season.\\"Los Angeles Pros to Use Coliseum,\\" Tucson Daily Citizen, vol. 75, no. 20 (Jan. 23, 1946), pg. 12. In moving to Los Angeles, Reeves became the owner of the first major American professional sports franchise to be located on the Pacific Coast, preceding the 1949 entrance of the San Francisco 49ers of the All-America Football Conference into the NFL and, by a decade, the 1957 relocation of the New York Giants and the Brooklyn Dodgers.A.S. \\"Doc\\" Young, \\"The Black Athlete in the Golden Age of Sports, Part VI: The Black Athlete Makes His Mark,\\" Ebony, May 1969, pg. 118. The move did not immediately cure the team's financial woes, however, and in 1947, Reeves found himself in need of co-owners to share the mounting losses while attempting a turnaround. Reeves brought Levy back in for a one-third stake in the team. Another third went to Harold Pauley and Hal Saley. Eventually, team proved to be extremely successful on the field, with quarterback Bob Waterfield helping the team to three straight league championship games from 1949 to 1951, culminating in another championship trophy. Boasting some of football's most glamorous stars, the Rams drew extremely well at the ticket office. Topped by a crowd of 102,368 for a San Francisco 49ers game in 1957, attendance for Rams games in the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum topped 80,000 on 22 occasions during the teams' first two decades in California. The previous closeness between Reeves and Levy fell away, though, and soon Levy was siding with Pauley against Reeves on most significant ownership decisions. Pauley eventually assumed Levy's stake, giving Pauley two-thirds ownership of the team but that did nothing to resolve the constant battles between Pauley and Reeves. Finally in 1962, the NFL stepped in to resolve the situation by holding a closed auction to result in one partner buying out the other. Reeves outbid Pauley for the team, valuing the Rams at $7.1 million against Pauley's bid of $6.1 million. Reeves once again assumed sole ownership. He then raised the funds to support his bid by immediately selling 49% of the team to a group of minority owners that included Gene Autry. By the time of Reeves' death in 1971, the team's worth was estimated at $20 million. Reeves also owned one of Los Angeles' first ice hockey teams, the Western Hockey League's Los Angeles Blades, which lasted from 1961 to 1967 and played nearby the Coliseum at the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena. Given the Blades' success, Reeves was an early favorite to get a National Hockey League franchise during the 1967 NHL expansion, but the league awarded the team to Los Angeles Lakers owner Jack Kent Cooke. Innovations The innovative Reeves made several other significant contributions to pro football. He instituted the famed \\"Free Football for Kids\\" program that enabled youngsters to enjoy the game in their formative years and then, hopefully, become ardent fans as adults. His signing of the ex-UCLA great, Kenny Washington, in the spring of 1946 marked the first time a black player had been hired in the NFL since 1933. Reeves' experimentation in the early days of television provided the groundwork for pro football's current successful TV policies. He was also the first to employ a full-time scouting staff. Relationship with George Allen In 1965, Reeves lured away head coach George Allen from the Chicago Bears. Allen made key trades and draft choices, which returned the team back to prominence within the next three seasons of his tenure. Allen allegedly had agreed on the deal with Reeves with two years remaining on his contract with the Bears, and a protracted legal battle followed.(Chicago) Bears take matter to court, AP article, The Miami News, Jan 12, 1966, accessed April 11, 2012. By 1968, Reeves had sought to go in a new direction as far as to find a new head coach for the team. On Christmas Day, Reeves attempted to fire Allen, but due to the wide public outcry of the Rams' fans over the dismissal, he finally relented and retained Allen as the head coach for the next two years, then fired him again after the 1970 season. Pro Football HOF enshrinement and death Reeves was enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1967. For his contribution to sports in Los Angeles, he was honored with a Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum \\"Court of Honor\\" plaque by the Coliseum commissioners. A longtime smoker, Reeves's health began to deteriorate by 1969. Reeves, who was also diagnosed with Hodgkin's disease, succumbed to cancer in his New York City apartment on April 15, 1971. After Reeves' death, Baltimore Colts owner Carroll Rosenbloom assumed control of the Rams in July 1972, spinning off the Colts to Robert Irsay in a swap of franchises between the owners and their investors.Los Angeles (Rams) Owner Dan Reeves dies of cancer, UPI Article for The Palm Beach Post, Apr 16, 1971, accessed April 11, 2012.

Early life and background Prabha was born to Abasaheb and Indirabai Atre in Pune. As children, Prabha and her sister, Usha, were interested in music, but neither of them planned to pursue music as a career. When Prabha was eight, Indirabai was not keeping good health, and at a friend's suggestion that classical music lessons would help her feel better, she took a few lessons. Listening to those lessons inspired Prabha to learn classical music. Her music training was in the Guru-shishya tradition. She learnt classical music from Sureshbabu Mane and Hirabai Badodekar from the Kirana gharana. She acknowledges the influence of two other greats, Amir Khan for khyal and Bade Ghulam Ali Khan for thumri, on her gayaki. While studying music, Prabha finished college courses in science and law to receive degrees in both of those disciplines. She later also earned a Ph.D. in music.

It was founded in 1943, and was officially recognized by the Holy See in 1948. Since the Second Vatican Council, it became part of a worldwide network of episcopal conferences, established in 1965. Until 1977, it was called the Canadian Catholic Conference, when the present name was adopted. According to its statutes, together the bishops exercise certain pastoral functions for Catholics in Canada, respecting the autonomy of each bishop in the service of his particular church. Through the work of its members, the conference is involved in matters of national and international scope in areas such as ecumenism and interfaith dialogue, social justice, aid to developing countries, the protection of human life, liturgy and Christian education. It also provides the bishops with a forum where they can share their experience and insight on the life of the church and the major events that shape society. The members of the conference include all diocesan bishops in Canada and those equivalent to them in law, all coadjutor bishops, and auxiliary bishops. Also included in the conference are titular bishops of any rite within the Catholic Church who exercise in the territory a special office assigned to them by the Apostolic See or by the conference. General secretariat To assist them in their pastoral work, the bishops have established a permanent bilingual secretariat in Ottawa, which includes various offices and services. In the Ottawa offices of the CCCB, a staff of about 40 people, laypersons, priests and religious, are at the service of the bishops. The National Liturgy Office of the CCCB is located in Montreal. The secretariat assists in coordinating activities and information, and in maintaining contacts with the Holy See and other Episcopal conferences, as well as with churches, ecclesial communities, faith groups and government authorities at the national and international levels. It also works in collaboration with the four regional Episcopal assemblies in Canada. Episcopal commissions and Aboriginal Council Twelve Episcopal commissions and one council are at the service of the Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops. Each commission specializes in one pastoral area, to guide and support the bishops in their ministry. Driven by the work and expertise of four bishops and one secretary (consultants and observers can also join the groups), each commission studies current events, analyses the needs for the Church in Canada, and organizes projects aimed at supporting Christian communities. Six of the commissions are national ‚Äì formed by bishops equally distributed between the French and English sectors ‚Äì while the five others are named \\"sectoral\\" because they are divided depending on the language of the member bishops. Three of those commissions are from the English sector, while two originate from the French sector. The Catholic Aboriginal Council encourages Aboriginal leadership in the Christian community.

Montsalvat is an artist colony in Eltham, Victoria, Australia, established by Justus Jorgensen in 1934. It is home to over a dozen buildings, houses and halls set amongst richly established gardens on 48,562 m2 (12 acres) of land. The colony of Montsalvat has a detailed history that reflects the life of Jorgensen and his friends and family; there is also a legend behind its name, while its buildings and gardens are steeped in the art and culture of Melbourne and its surroundings. Visitors can pay an admission fee to walk throughout the colony's historical gardens, artists' houses/workshops and explore the surrounding buildings. All of the buildings on the site were designed and built by residents with locally available materials, from various sources. The Great Hall offers an extensive network of spaces from extravagant halls and vast exhibition spaces, to small corridors and tiny balconies overlooking the gardens. Currently Montsalvat's grounds and buildings are mostly used for exhibitions, performances, conferences, seminars, weddings and receptions; however, many artists (such as luthiers, jewellers, painters, glass artists, ceramicists, textile artists, sculptors and a writer) continue to reside in Montsalvat. Several classes on various disciplines of art are offered year round by the resident artists.  Etymology  The name Montsalvat features in both German and English mythology. In the opera Parsifal by German composer Richard Wagner, Montsalvat is the castle, built by Titurel, where the Holy Grail is protected; and in Act III of his namesake opera, Lohengrin sings of it as home. In the English legend of \\"King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table\\", Montsalvat is mentioned as the home of the Holy Grail. Though established only in 1934, Montsalvat has created its own myths and legends.Montsalvat ‚Äì A Symphony of Mud and Stone, Sigmund Jorgensen (2001) Montsalvat means \\"Saved Mount\\" in Catalan.  History  =Justus Jorgensen= Montsalvat is the creation of Justus Jorgensen and the work of many hands. Born in 1894, Jorgensen trained as an architect with a Melbourne firm of architects, Schreiber & Co. Later, he turned his talents to painting, enrolling at the National Gallery School of Art in Melbourne, whose principal was a leading member of the Heidelberg School of Artists, Frederick McCubbin. In 1917, after hearing a lecture by the artist Max Meldrum, Jorgensen decided to join the Meldrum Studio. The Ornamental Pond in Montsalvat. In 1924 Jorgensen married a medical student from Brisbane, Lillian Smith. In the same year the couple travelled to Europe with a group of artist friends including John and Polly Farmer, Colin Colahan and Archie Colquhoun. The group painted at various places on their way across Italy, Spain, France and England. In their travels they visited many of the great European galleries to study the old and modern masters of European painting. Meldrum joined the group while they were painting in Cassis, a small French village near the Mediterranean coast. Later, some of them moved to Paris where Jorgensen established himself in a studio at 147 Rue Broca in the 13th Arrondissement. He returned to Australia in 1929. During this period, Jorgensen enjoyed considerable success both in Paris and London, with exhibitions at several major galleries including being hung at the prestigious Royal Academy Summer Exhibition in both 1926 and 1927, a rare honor for an Australian. The influences of this period in Europe are apparent both in his painting and in the architecture of Montsalvat. Jorgensen bought a home and studio in the Melbourne bayside suburb of Brighton and later leased an old warehouse in Queen Street, Melbourne as his city studio where he could work and teach. Artist houses in Montsalvat. In 1956 the studio had to be vacated when the building was demolished to make way for the Royal Automobile Club of Victoria (RACV). The Queen Street classes had attracted many students and the studio had become an important hub of intellectual and bohemian life in conservative Melbourne. Jorgensen had continued to accept architectural work and in 1934 while working on the design and construction of a studio in Eltham for the painter and cartoonist Percy Leason, he decided that it was here he wanted to live, and so the Montsalvat dream began. Jorgensen invited his students and friends to join him in Eltham where he harnessed their collective enthusiasm in the building of Montsalvat. Among those early students and friends were author and critic Mervyn Skipper, his wife Lena and their three children ‚Äì Helen, Sonia and Matcham. Arthor Munday, George Charlmers, Lesley Sinclair, Sue Vanderkelen, Ian Robertson, Helen Lempriere, John Smith, John Busst and Myra Skipper. Percy Leason and his family lived next door and then there were the many friends who came to join in the work and the camaraderie of the camp. Two notable Australian artists said to be associated with Montsalvat were Leonard French and Albert Tucker.Melbourne Architecture by Philip Goad p.140 =Early Montsalvat= The Chapel at Montsalvat. The Eltham district had been settled since the 1850s; some of these early pioneers had used mud bricks to build their farmhouses, but the method had long been abandoned. Jorgensen saw value in the building technique. The local soils appeared suitable for both adobe (mudbrick) and pis√© de terre (rammed earth) and it was cheap, so he set his students to work. He dispatched Arthur Munday, to the State Library in Melbourne to research the technique. There was little written material available, as the methods has been handed down from father to son. Arthur finally found in the writings of the ancient Roman historian Pliny some of the information they were looking for. Slate for the roofs came from a friend's recently demolished house, discarded fire bricks, tiles and other material came from other sites. The recently demolished Bijou Theatre (in Bourke Street) proved a rich resource which provided the beautiful cast iron circular staircase, architrave mouldings and some of the doors and windows. Helen Lempriere's family donated materials and money to build the ornamental pond. The many doors that open onto the pond area are from the cubicles that were the students' bedrooms, which have now been combined into one long studio. (The original inhabitants' initials can be seen on the front doorstep of each room). The small bluestone tower, limestone studio and Long Gallery were added later to form the closed courtyard. =The Great Hall= The Great Hall looking south-east. Work on the Great Hall began in 1938 with a local tradesman Len Jarrold as the leading hand. Jorgensen had originally designed a modest structure of mud brick, however during the excavation a reef of mudstone was uncovered. The unique ochre tones of the stone inspired Jorgensen to re-design and the resulting larger structure was the Great Hall. He was fortunate in that Whelan the Wreckers were demolishing the charming Royal Insurance Building which stood at 414, Collins Street, Melbourne,A City Lost and Found by Robyn Annear p.94 which contained the limestone windows and the stone balconies carved in the Gothic manner, that now adorn the Great Hall and give it its unique character. Students carved other windows and the gargoyles, which incorporated the traditional grotesque faces as seen in medieval architecture. Extra stone for the walls came from a nearby quarry and the bluestone, granite and limestone from demolition sites across Melbourne. Some of the flagstones and roofing slates had originally been shipped from Ireland and Wales as ballast aboard the sailing ships that serviced Australia in the 19th century. Wooden staircase in the Great Hall. Work on the Great Hall was interrupted by the outbreak World War II. Some of the students enlisted in the armed forces while others assisted on the home front. Montsalvat was turned into a farm and market garden. Jorgensen and his now smaller 'team' turned their creative abilities to these new projects, building the barns and sheds. Materials were scarce, but they managed to scrounge odd bits and pieces ‚Äì from discarded broken bricks and rusty galvanized iron to timber poles cut from the bush. Additional to the market garden was the dairy and poultry farm with the produce being sold through the local markets. The Department of the Army took an interest and allowed a skilled joiner and cabinetmaker, Phil Taffe to help with the project. Phil, although almost blind, worked on the new buildings and helped make some of the refectory tables, stools, carved chairs and other furniture that can be seen in the Great Hall today. South wall of the Great Hall. After the war, work on the Great Hall and other buildings resumed. The slate floor in the hall and the wooden floors above were finally put in place. Students were given the task of carving the corbels and other embellishments around the windows and doors as part of their training. Some of the stonework came from Wilson Hall at the University of Melbourne, which had been badly damaged by fire in 1952. Local tradesmen joined the team, as did some new students and aspiring artists fresh back from the horrors of the war, like Clifton Pugh, Gordon Ford and Joe Hannan and tradesmen Horry Judd, Bill Floyd, Wallt Stephens, Ken Howard, plus several refugees from Europe and Asia.  Recent history and today  Montsalvat today is a place where emerging and established artists can present and perform their work. Its visual features are enjoyed by tourists from around the world, and it can be found listed in many major Melbourne tourist guides. Public events (including exhibitions and performances), Film and Photography, Celebrations and Gatherings of many types are held on the property and amongst its buildings frequently. * In 1975 Montsalvat became a Charitable Trust with Jorgensen's youngest son Sigmund as the chairman of the Trust and its administrator. * In 1989 the work at Montsalvat was recognised by the Victorian Government when the property was placed on Heritage Victoria's Register, soon followed by a classification by the National Trust of Victoria. * In October 1998 the Australian Heritage Commission included Montsalvat on the Australian Register of National Estate. (No. 100160) * The Shire of Nillumbik council has also listed the property as a Heritage Place. * In 2006, an unpaid tax debt forced the current administration to sell land in nearby Christmas Hills after a bitter fight with a Victorian State Government appointed administrator. =Film and still photography= Montsalvat is a much sought after location for films and photography, and is used by many professionals and amateurs alike. Personal photography and art using the grounds and buildings as the subject matter is encouraged, however, commercial uses including wedding photography must first be negotiated as fees usually apply. It has been one of the filming locations for two vampire films, Thirst in 1979, and Queen of the Damned (2002). It was used for the opening scenes of John D. Lamond's \\"Ozploitation\\" film, Felicity (1979). Montsalvat was used as an abandoned monastery in episode 4 of Neighbours in 1985. In episode 5600 of Neighbours in 2008, it doubled as Portugal. It was also the location for Libby and Dans wedding. It was used for an episode of Miss Fisher's Murder Mysteries in 2013. The episode was titled \\"Murder under the Mistletoe\\" and was broadcast on ABC1 on 22 December 2013. It was used for the wedding scene in Season 6 of the Australian drama Offspring in 2016. Scenes for Judy and Punch set in 17th century Britain were filmed here. The film will be released in 2019. =Private and commercial gatherings= * The Great Hall, Long Gallery, Barn Gallery and Chapel are used for private functions including weddings and receptions. * Some Melbourne funeral directors use Montsalvat as a funeral venue. * Montsalvat houses facilities for commercial gatherings such as seminars and conferences. Its spaces can accommodate up to 200 people, while formal meals can be provided for up to 120 guests. =Arson and subsequent re-building = In 1996 the red brick barn/workshop/studio towards the entrance was subjected to arson and burnt down.The Age Metro 8 July 1996, p. B1 It was subsequently rebuilt and now forms the main entrance and exhibition space known as the Barn Gallery. This is now where the majority of exhibitions and performances are held today.

While the term 'visionary' suggests the idea of an idealistic, impractical or Utopian notion, it also depicts a mental picture produced by the imagination. These architectural drawings on paper allow insight of the unusual perception of the worlds that are impossible to visit everyday, except through the visual dramatization of the designed, imaginative environment.Walker, John. (1992) \\"Visionary Architecture\\". Glossary of Art, Architecture & Design since 1945, 3rd. ed. Retrieved 19 January 2012. There are also two meanings that are derived from both terms 'imagination' and 'imaginary,' meaning unrealistic and impossible, and the other the ability to deal creatively with an unseen reality. A significant precedent that adheres to the concept of visionary architecture is the 18th century architect Giovanni Piranesi, who also had to think twice about the difference in meaning of the two terms. The titles of his well-known prison etching works had two versions. The first was 'imaginary prisons,' and the final as 'prisons of the imagination.' Criticism of the 'Irrational' design There are two differing perceptions in relation to the work of the imagination, and visionary architecture. One position is that there are no unbuildable buildings, only unbuilt ones, and the other is the belief that some visionary architectural drawings are impossible to be inhabited by the human. In the absence of a clear grasp of a controlling idea, as an individual, each design is found to be highly arbitrary, and it is this aspect, which results in the designs to seem and look impossible. Conceptual architecture, or architecture based on the act of imagination and vision, dissociates the physical nature of architectural design. However, it is the idea and belief that these drawings and images are able to portray the true meaning of architecture and design that connotes the significance of the works of visionary architecture. The complete history of architecture must include both the built and the unbuilt environment. Tool of Scaling Architects are able to imagine, see and define a distant object that is in fact a building through the process of fabricating models, scaling them up and down, ascending from the abstract to the concrete. Instead of physically creating the design of a building into its complete scale and form, multiple up and down transitions in scale size of models allow the building design that is on paper to emerge, become visible, representing the material as being real, bringing the building into existence.Scaling Up and DownL Extraction Trials in Architectural Design; Albena Yavena; Social studies of Science Vol. 35, No.6, Dec. 2005 The visionary nature of the eighteenth-century movement did not reside so much in this radical formalism as in the bizarre conceptions in which the architects indulged, and their delight in projects of vast size.The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin; Metropolitan Museum of Art; New series, Vol. 26, No. 8, Apr., 1968 These scaled models were considered to be utopian and fantastic in design, where the sense of fantasy is enhanced by symbolic meanings that are achieved by making the whole form of the building speak.The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin; Metropolitan Museum of Art; New series, Vol. 26, No. 8, Apr., 1968 Precedents =Early designers and artists= During the Renaissance period, the differing representations of buildings evolved and grew rapidly through the introduction of perspective.The built, the unbuilt and the unbuildable: in pursuit of architectural meaning. Robert Harbison; Thames and Hudson, 1991 The discovery of this visualization tool, allowed for experimentation with imaginary architectural scenes, and while many architects wrote greatly on the subject, others articulated their concepts and ideas through drawings. During the sixteenth century, a Dutch painter and architect, Jan Vredeman de Vries,Visionary Architecture: Unbuilt works of the imagination; Burden, Ernest E 1934; New York: McGraw-Hill, c2000 produced numerous engravings, which portrayed new forms of architectural representation. His works were of pure fantasy and imagination, but were also regarded as avant-garde messages in the depiction of architectural space. Giovanni Battista Piranesi was considered one of the greatest printmakers of the eighteenth century. He is notably one of the greatest printmakers of his time, where it is through this medium in which he demonstrated his mastering of etchings of imagined spaces.Visionary architecture: Unbuilt works of the imagination. Burden, Ernest E 1934, New YorkL McGraw-Hill, c2000 It was suggested that the drawn spaces would lose their magic and meaning if they were to be physically built in real life, as they would lose their unique forms of detail and intricacy, which is only achieved through drawings. The particular series of etchings 'Prisons (Carceri d'invenzione) or 'Imaginary Prisons,' depict his famous fictitious and atmospheric etchings of Rome's ancient remains, and his dreams of antiquity that often surpassed reality. Etienne-Louis Boullee's Monument to Newton is considered to be more perfect due to its capability in successfully defying any attempt to physically use it, being the most magnificent unusable space images, a dome with its literal- minded fulfilment underfoot, in a second answering dome.Visionary Architecture: Unbuilt works of the imagination; Burden, Ernest E 1934; New York: McGraw-Hill, c2000 Claude Nicolas Ledoux, who studied under Jacques- Fran√ßois Blondel and Pierre Contant d'Ivry, built a number of projects ranging from private residences to the entire complex of the Royal Saltworks at Arc- et-Senans, but is also renowned for his utopian designs. He envisioned an entire town around the Royal Saltworks, which he called Chaux, and developed an entire master plan along with plans, elevations, and sections of various individual buildings in this town. The town of Chaux is a formalized exemplification of his ideas in urban planning, architecture, and society. Jean-Jacques Lequeu is considered to be one of the more eccentric and obscene of the early visionary architects. He worked as a civil servant as a cartographer, surveyor, and draftsman, but owing to the French Revolution his career as an actual architect never came to fruition. He spent most of his career preparing an unpublished treatise entitled Architecture Civile, which is primarily composed of the rudiments of architectural drawing and shadow casting, which is followed by a series of fragments of his own fanciful architectural designs. These designs are usually an elevation or section or plan, but rarely an entire design.Philippe Duboy. Lequeu: An Architectural Enigma. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press. 1986. The young motion picture industry also created an impact within the architectural scene, represented through the films 'Metropolis' and 'Just Imagine.' This differing form of media allowed for the elaborate and imaginative architectural sets depicting futuristic scenes to be observed. Through this, other significant artists and architects such as Hugh Ferriss were influenced.Visionary architecture: Unbuilt works of the imagination. Burden, Ernest E 1934, New YorkL McGraw-Hill, c2000 =Late 20th Century Designers and Architects= Peter Zumthor is another significant figure that adhered to the work of the unbuilt and paper architecture. The writing in his architectural manifesto of 'Thinking Architecture,' Zumthor grasps the significance of emotion and experience as measuring tools of the architecture, thus being the before-hand process of the design. His work was greatly unpublished because his philosophical belief of how architecture should be experienced first hand played a greater role in his designs. His perception that designing buildings should relate directly to our emotions. Rem Koolhaas moved to New York in 1972, where his years of being situated in Manhattan, expanded his fascination with the city, leading to a close examination of the dynamics, which constructed it. His writing Delirious New York Theories and Manifestos of Contemporary Architecture (2nd Ed.); Jenks, Charles; Kropf, Karl (Ed.S); Chichester, West SussexL Wiley Academy, 2006, 2nd Ed. and the theory of manhattanism are the results of this study depicts his perception on the manifesto of the city, dealing with the city as a subject, where the book itself is a spatial project, while the text explains the structure of the city, using the narrative sequence and typographic layout to effectively mimic the space.Paradigm Islands, Manhattan and Venice: Discourses on Architecture and the city; Teresa Stoppani; Abingdon, Oxon [England]; New YorkL Routledge 2011 Hermann Finsterlin is considered to be the one of the most radical of the Expressionists, and is notable known for having produced fascinating carbuncular studies of the most unbuildable and obscure buildings. Although he never built anything, his visionary drawings focused on perspectives, playing with the forms of unusual, organic shapes. Finsterlin's architectural drawings would require the most devious methods to physically build as they go against their form, beginning with careful dissection and separate moulding of each part, only emphasizing and confirming that they are among the purest paper buildings ever developed.Visionary Architecture: Unbuilt works of the imagination; Burden, Ernest E 1934; New York: McGraw- Hill, c2000 Lebbeus Woods, after working with Eero Saarinen in the 1960s, turned to visionary architecture around 1976, producing a body of drawings and models that reimagine cities like Berlin, Paris, Havana, and Vienna. He also worked extensively in Sarajevo in the 1990s. Until his death in 2012 he was a professor at Cooper Union and other institutions and maintained a personal blog for his ideas and reflections, which is now maintained as an online archive. Sheila Sri Prakash is the first woman to have started and operated her own architectural firm in India. She is known for her visionary architectural design methodologies where she draws from her ability to visualize and imagine spaces through the practice of classical Indian dance and music. She was regarded a child prodigy for her talents as a gifted dancer, musician, painter, sculptor and performing artist and is known for having given her first critically acclaimed Bharatanatyam Arangetram on stage, in Mumbai, at the age of 6. As a prolific designer she has had well over 1000 completed architectural projects to her credit over an ongoing career that spans 35 years. She is considered the greatest Architect from the Indian sub- continent and is known as a breakthrough thinker for her practice of Indo- centric Reciprocity or Holistic Sustainability through Architecture and Urban Design as a solution to global socio-economic issues. She serves on the World Economic Forum Global Agenda Council on Design Innovation and the Role of Arts in Society. In the 1980s a group of Russian architects emerged, united by ‚Äúpaper architecture‚Äù phenomenon. It accounts Yuri Avvakumov, Mikhail Belov, Alexander Brodsky, Mikhail Filippov, and Ilya Utkin. At a time when Soviet architecture, limited by ideological controls and unfavorable economic conditions, had fallen victim to standardized construction, paper architecture offered freedom of expression. Inspired by the works of Piranesi and the Russian avant-garde, these visionary projects were never intended for realization, and were conceived from the start as drawings. Douglas Darden, after taking a studio class with Stanley Tigerman at Harvard, began his career by teaching and publishing works of paper architecture. He was largely inspired by Giovanni Battista Piranesi, Jean-Jacques Lequeu, and Marcel Duchamp. His visionary designs demonstrated what he referred to as \\"narrative architecture\\", as the works were largely inspired by and formed based on various works of literature, such as Moby-Dick, As I Lay Dying, The Drunken Boat, and others. Since his work was often executed by working from anti- theses of architectural principles, as well as social and functional ideologies in design, he used the term underbelly to describe his work.

The most common form are those operated by hobbyists. These can range from inexpensive toys to complex projects involving sophisticated electronics. Oceanographers and the Military also operate radio- controlled submarines.  Radio Transmission through Water  As the conductivity of a medium increases, the more a radio signal passing through it is attenuated.Underwater Communication High frequencies are also attenuated more than low frequencies, and tend to reflect off the surface of the water more. As is well known communication with military submarines uses very low frequency electromagnetic radiation for this reason. Military frequencies are well below allocated hobby radio control bands, but the lowest hobby bands - typically around 27MHz/40MHz - can penetrate several feet of water at short distances - typically less than 45 meters. Penetration at these frequencies is better in fresh water - a lake or swimming pool, and difficult to impossible in sea water. Modern radio control sets using the 2.4GHz band penetrate water very poorly, and are of no use to a model submariner who wishes to dive. For underwater radio to work, even at these frequencies, the receiving aerial needs to be completely insulated from the surrounding water. Plastic covered wire provides adequate insulation - the aerial need not be held in an airtight container - but the cut end of such wire MUST be sealed against water ingress. Depending on water conditions, positive control can be maintained at perhaps 3 meters depth. Since control of model submarines may not be reliable at all times, such models usually carry a variety of apparatus intended to prevent model loss. Fail-safe systems which detect loss of signal and command the submarine to surface, or pressure sensors which limit the depth attained, may be used. Such specialist complexity usually makes a model submarine an expensive item compared to a model surface boat. Professional or military remote-controlled diving equipment may be controlled via a tether, or by using sound signals. Quite commonly, such equipment has onboard computers which allow autonomous operation following a set path, so continuous communication with the controlling base is not necessary. The advent of small cheap computers such as the Raspberry Pi or Arduino has allowed model submariners to emulate their professional brethren and provide autonomous control in situations where radio transmission or adequate visibility is lacking.  Hobby Submarines  = Dynamic diving = These models are positively buoyant, and will remain on the surface until sufficient thrust is generated over their control surfaces to force them down beneath the water. Dynamic diving models are both the cheapest and simplest designed models available, as complicated buoyancy control systems are replaced by diving planes or thrusters. Dynamic dive models also have the advantage of being able to return to the surface if radio contact is lost, due to their positive buoyancy. However, as they are positively buoyant, such models must maintain sufficient speed while underwater to remain there, and are unable to stop without rising to the surface. Some modelers may also argue that the speed required to submerge such models is not to scale and that they may dive too quickly. = Static diving = These models have the ability to alter their displacement by taking on or pumping out water. This can be accomplished through the use of a piston, inflatable bladder, or through a ballast tank. Boats that use a ballast tank generally fill the tank by opening a vent at the top, and force the water out by using compressed gas. There are variants that use water pumps for both processes. A liquid gas is dosed into the ballast tank to push water out. Gas-Snort Liquid gas is used to surface the boat in an emergency, otherwise the ballast tank is blown by the use of a snorkel tube at periscope depth and the boat is trimmed to surface to periscope depth with a full ballast tank. RCABS -Recirculated Compressed Air Ballast System. Originally developed by Darnell (UK) in the 1950s, this system uses a rubber bladder as the ballast tank and this is filled with compressed air supplied by a small compressor. The air is taken from the water-tight container (WTC) aft dry space to inflate the bladder. Another system gaining popularity is the 'Snort System'. A ballast tank allows water to enter by releasing a vent valve on the top of the cylinder, allowing the boat to submerge. To surface, a small pump 'Snorts' air from the snorkel tube in the conning tower (sail) into the ballast tank, expelling the water. This system is also equipped with a small tank of compressed gas, which in the event of a fail-safe system operating, usually due to loss of radio signal, the gas is released into the ballast tank, surfacing the boat. In Europe, the piston tank is the ballast system of choice. These models can become very expensive to build due to the complexity of their ballast systems. In the event of a loss of radio contact while submerged, the boat will most likely sink to the bottom and require manual retrieval, unless equipped with a fail safe system. However, the ability to dive while at a stand still has its advantages, as it can be more precise and scale like than dynamic systems.

He was a platelayer at the docks, a labourer, a miner, a van driver, building site labourer and a computer programmer. He performed in a local band, the Salford Jets, as a singer and songwriter in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The band had three top-100 UK hit singles, one of which reached No. 72 in the UK Singles Charts in 1980. Sweeney and his wife have lived in Uppermill since 1997.Barratt, Ro (2007-01-24) \\"Why homelife is about to go downhill for top DJ Mike\\"; Manchester Evening News, pp. 10 & 11. Radio career By the age of 31 an onward he was regularly being interviewed on Manchester's Piccadilly radio station and had begun to make promotion jingles for his band's gigs for the station. He was then offered a 12-show trial as one of the station's disc jockeys; it was thought that his Salford accent would go down well with local audiences. He worked prime time slots on the station from 1981 into the late 1990s while branching out into interviewing, sports reportage and documentaries. He plays football, has boxed for Salford Lads' Club and also swum for the city. He also had his own Friday night show Sweeney's '60s Classics. He not only played the well-known classics but more obscure singles that had never been heard since the '60s. He then became a DJ on Capital Gold in London in 1997 where he presented the morning show on Monday-Friday 10:00 am to 1:00 pm, the Capital Gold Rock Show on Friday nights, and Mike Sweeney's '60s Classics and at the Hop on Saturday nights until the station merged with Classic Gold. He presented the weekday drivetime slot until the summer of 2009. He then joined Rock Radio (later Real XS) to host the breakfast programme and The Million Sellers Show on Smooth '70s. Sweeney is currently working for Radio Manchester, hosting the morning show Monday to Friday from 9 am until 12 pm and also hosting Sweeney's Sixties Classics on the same station on Sunday from 12 pm to 3 pm. Sweeney still sings with the Salford Jets and with two other groups, the Mindbenders and the Swinging Blue Jeans. His acoustic duo, Mike Sweeney and Paddy O'Hare launched in 2012. They are working on an EP titled Walking Down the Line, which will be released in 2013. On TV, Sweeney's Elvis Has Just Left the Building is still showing on Sky's Men & Motors. He also presented the Manchester United Debate Show on Channel M from 2007 to 2009 and a classic car series for Sky in 2000. Sweeney has won two New York Radio awards, a Sony in 2002 and Guardian Media Group's Presenter of the Year in 2009. The Radio Academy gave him a Lifetime Achievement award in 2011.

Cahul County was part of the Bessarabia Governorate of the Russian Empire (1812‚Äì1856), of the Principality of Moldavia (1856‚Äì1859), then of the Kingdom of Romania (1859‚Äì1878). In 1878, it was again annexed by the Russians, who merged it with the Ismail County. After the Union of Bessarabia with Romania in 1918, the county became a first-order administrative division of Romania as Cahul County of Romania. The Romanian county was abolished in the 1938 Administrative and Constitutional Reform. In 1940, the area was occupied by the Soviet Union. It was briefly reconstituted as a Romanian county during the 1941-1944 Romanian reintegration of Bessarabia, after Operation M√ºnchen, but was returned to the Soviet Union after the Romanian armistice was signed.United States Department of State. Foreign relations of the United States, 1946. Paris Peace Conference: documents Volume IV (1946) After the independence, the Republic of Moldova established a Moldovan county of the same name in 1999, but disestablished it in 2003.

He studied art at the Royal Scottish Academy in Edinburgh, at the Royal Academy in London, and in Paris. His last studies were interrupted by the Franco-Prussian War. Career In 1871, Cruikshank settled in Canada, opened a studio in Toronto and for twenty-five years was an instructor in the Central Ontario School of Art, later the Ontario College of Art, teaching how to draw from the antique (casts) and from life. He claimed to have been responsible for bring the pen-and-ink technique of Europe to North America. As a major member of the Toronto Art Students' League, he encourage his students to follow the motto Nulla Dies Sine Linea (No Day without a Line). Eventual Group of Seven founder, J. E. H. MacDonald, would later say that the northern movement and search for a new Canadian art began with the work of Cruikshank and George Agnew Reid., quoted in . In 1894 he was elected a member of the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts and acquired a considerable reputation as a portrait and figure painter, and as a painter of Canadian scenes. Some of his paintings are in the National Gallery of Canada. =Tom Thomson= It has been suggested that around 1906 or 1907, Tom Thomson took private lessons from Cruikshank at the Ontario College of Art and Design. Only two sources corroborate this however. The first is a single undated note from Cruikshank to professor James Mavor, arranging to bring a \\"Tomson\\" to meet him., quoted in . Further complicating the matter is that the original class list no longer survives. The second is a letter from H. B. Jackson to Blodwen Davies, writing, \\"Tom studied from life & the antique in art school. If I remember right Cruikshank was the instructor.\\", quoted in .

Unemployment, lack of housing and crime are major challenges in the area.Atlantis en route to resurrection - Western Cape  IOL News  IOL.co.za History of Atlantis The suburb of Atlantis was established during the 1970s by the Apartheid government as an industrial centre and a community for the coloured population of Cape Town under the Group Areas Act. In order to attract industry and residents to Atlantis the government introduced various incentives to attract manufacturing firms via a system of relocation tax credit. In its heyday in the early to mid-1980s there were approximately 50 industrialists in Atlantis employing people drawn from nearly 8 000 households. These industries included large manufacturing concerns such as Tedelex and Atlantis Diesel Engines. Manufacturing activities in Atlantis declined with the termination of the incentive programmes and the defence manufacturing contracts from the mid-1980s. The withdrawal of incentives significantly reduced the attractiveness of the area and while Atlantis has since been through a series of mini economic booms and busts the trend declined in the economy of the area. Currently, only about 3% of the original companies still have business in Atlantis but numerous new factories and businesses have started to operate in Atlantis. Over the past three years over R1bn has been invested into Atlantis by large multinationals. Hisense opened a factory in the town in June 2013[2] injecting ZAR 350 million into the first phase of the Atlantis plant, creating 300 production positions and accompanied by a skills-transfer programme led by technicians and engineers from China. Over R600m has been invested by the green manufacturing industry, for the manufacture of wind towers, wind tower internals and solar panels and the like. The investment is the result of cooperation between the City of Cape Town, the Western Cape Provincial Government, the South African Department of Trade and Industry and GreenCape. In 2013, the City of Cape Town in cooperation with the Western Cape Provincial Government declared Atlantis as a priority area for economic development, establishing a Greentech hub for manufacturing of components for the renewable energy and other green industries. An application has also been submitted for the Atlantis Industrial Area to be declared a Special Economic Zone with the focus on green technology. The SEZ status will provide investors a range of incentives, including the benefits of co-location, and access to established markets. There have been a range of other interventions to revitalize the local economy: * Upgrading of infrastructure such as the electricity supply, improved public transport system (MyCiti Bus System), installation of a fiber optic network to improve the broad band utilization and load shedding curtailment agreements. * A special package of investment incentives for Atlantis, which comprises fast-tracking of building plan approval and land use applications, the waiver of building plan scrutiny fees, reduced electricity tariffs for large electricity users, partial waiver of development contributions, as well as the establishment of an Investment Facilitation Office in Atlantis. Through these initiatives, it is now easier to do business in Atlantis and the cost of doing has been driven down.

In geometric graph theory, a unit disk graph is the intersection graph of a family of unit disks in the Euclidean plane. That is, it is a graph with one vertex for each disk in the family, and with an edge between two vertices whenever the corresponding vertices lie within a unit distance of each other. They are commonly formed from a Poisson point process, making them a simple example of a random structure. Definitions There are several possible definitions of the unit disk graph, equivalent to each other up to a choice of scale factor: * A graph formed from a collection of points in the Euclidean plane, in which two points are connected if their distance is below a fixed threshold. * An intersection graph of equal-radius circles, or of equal-radius disks (see Fig. 1). * A graph formed from a collection of equal-radius circles, in which two circles are connected by an edge if one circle contains the centre of the other circle. Properties Every induced subgraph of a unit disk graph is also a unit disk graph. An example of a graph that is not a unit disk graph is the star K1,7 with one central node connected to seven leaves: if each of seven unit disks touches a common unit disk, some two of the seven disks must touch each other (as the kissing number in the plane is 6). Therefore, unit disk graphs cannot contain an induced K1,7 subgraph. Applications Beginning with the work of , unit disk graphs have been used in computer science to model the topology of ad hoc wireless communication networks. In this application, nodes are connected through a direct wireless connection without a base station. It is assumed that all nodes are homogeneous and equipped with omnidirectional antennas. Node locations are modelled as Euclidean points, and the area within which a signal from one node can be received by another node is modelled as a circle. If all nodes have transmitters of equal power, these circles are all equal. Random geometric graphs, formed as unit disk graphs with randomly generated disk centres, have also been used as a model of percolation and various other phenomena.See, e.g., . Computational complexity If one is given a collection of unit disks (or their centres) in a space of any fixed dimension, it is possible to construct the corresponding unit disk graph in linear time, by rounding the centres to nearby integer grid points, using a hash table to find all pairs of centres within constant distance of each other, and filtering the resulting list of pairs for the ones whose circles intersect. The ratio of the number of pairs considered by this algorithm to the number of edges in the eventual graph is a constant, giving the linear time bound. However, this constant grows exponentially as a function of the dimension . It is NP-hard (more specifically, complete for the existential theory of the reals) to determine whether a graph, given without geometry, can be represented as a unit disk graph.; . Additionally, it is probably impossible in polynomial time to output explicit coordinates of a unit disk graph representation: there exist unit disk graphs that require exponentially many bits of precision in any such representation.. However, many important and difficult graph optimization problems such as maximum independent set, graph coloring, and minimum dominating set can be approximated efficiently by using the geometric structure of these graphs,; . and the maximum clique problem can be solved exactly for these graphs in polynomial time, given a disk representation.. Even if a disk representation is not known, and an abstract graph is given as input, it is possible in polynomial time to produce either a maximum clique or a proof that the graph is not a unit disk graph, and to 3-approximate the optimum coloring by using a greedy coloring algorithm. When a given vertex set forms a subset of a triangular lattice, a necessary and sufficient condition for the perfectness of a unit graph is known.. For the perfect graphs, a number of NP-complete optimization problems (graph coloring problem, maximum clique problem, and maximum independent set problem) are polynomially solvable.

Formed in 1995 by singer and guitarist Tamala Poljak, the group had originally been a guitar and drums duo with Poljak and drummer, Kevin Hair. Tamala had previously been in the bands Oiler and Fleabag. The group released several singles, including a split single with Team Dresch on Sub Pop, before disbanded in 1997, just after the release of their debut album, Once Upon A Time Called Now. After the band had broken up, one of Longstocking's songs was featured on the soundtrack of the film Fuel and was included on the Fuel Soundtrack CD, released in 1998. After this, Tamala Poljak contributed to the collaborative project called KaraNEEDoke, a set of double 7\\" singles released on the Kill Rock Stars label with participants Nomy Lamm, Slim Moon, Audrey Marrs, Donna Dresch, Tracy Sawyer, formerly of Heavens to Betsy, and Tamala, with music by The Need. Tamala then formed her next band, The Automaticans, who released a split single with Team Dresch on Metal Monkey Records. In the early 2000s, Tamala joined with Jody Bleyle of Team Dresch and Whitney Skillcorn of The Little Deaths to form Infinite Xs. The band released one recording on Chainsaw Records. Tamala has collaborated with Los Angeles punk- rock legends, Exene Cervenka and Phranc.

In biology, a taxon with a disjunct distribution is one that has two or more groups that are related but considerably separated from each other geographically. The causes are varied and might demonstrate either the expansion or contraction of a species' range. Range fragmentation Also called range fragmentation, disjunct distributions may be caused by changes in the environment, such as mountain building and continental drift or rising sea levels; it may also be due to an organism expanding its range into new areas, by such means as rafting, or other animals transporting an organism to a new location (plant seeds consumed by birds and animals, can be moved to new locations during bird or animals migrations, and those seeds can be deposited in new locations in fecal matter). Other conditions that can produce disjunct distributions include: flooding, or changes in wind, stream, and current flows, plus others such as anthropogenic introduction of alien introduced species either accidentally or deliberately (agriculture and horticulture). Habitat fragmentation Disjunct distributions can occur when suitable habitat is fragmented, which produces fragmented populations, and when that fragmentation becomes so divergent that species movement between one suitable habitat to the next is disrupted, isolated population can be produced. Extinctions can cause disjunct distribution, especially in areas where only scattered areas are habitable by a species; for instance, island chains or specific elevations along a mountain range or areas along a coast or between bodies of water like streams, lakes and ponds. Examples There are many patterns of disjunct distributions at many scales: Irano-Turanian disjunction, Europe - East Asia, Europe-South Africa (e.g. genus Erica), Mediterranean- Hoggart disjunction (genus Olea), etc. =Lusitanian distribution= The range map of Geomalacus maculosus shows a 'Lusitanian' distribution. This kind of disjunct distribution of a species, such that it occurs in Iberia and in Ireland, without any intermediate localities, is usually called \\"Lusitanian\\" (named after the Roman Province Lusitania, corresponding roughly to modern day Portugal). Examples of animal species with a Lusitanian distribution are: the Kerry slug Geomalacus maculosus and the Pyrenean glass snail Semilimax pyrenaicus. Plant species with this kind of distribution include several heather species (Calluna spp.) and the strawberry tree (Arbutus unedo). The theory behind the name \\"Lusitanian\\" is now discredited; it posited that there was an ice-free land mass that served as a refugium off of the south-west of Ireland during the Quaternary (last) glaciation. In this refugium, relic fauna and flora from a previous ice-free period survived until the present warmer interstadial period. Although the theory is no longer accepted, the term Lusitanian is still used as a descriptive term for faunal elements such as the Kerry slug. Recently a better explanation of the occurrence of the Kerry slug and similar faunal elements in southwestern Ireland has been developed. This new theory is supported by two recent discoveries: the genetic similarity of much of Ireland‚Äôs fauna to that of northern Spain, and the genetic similarity of much of Ireland‚Äôs human population to that of northern Spain. Mascheretti et al. (2003)Masheretti S., Rogatcheva M. B., G√ºnd√ºz I., Fredga K. & Searle J. B. 2003. How did pygmy shrews colonize Ireland? Clues from a phylogenetic analysis of mitochondrial cytochrome b sequences. Proc. Roy. Soc. B 270: 1593-1599. examined the genotypes of Eurasian pygmy shrew, a small mammal, across its range in Europe. The Irish population showed close genetic affinity to a population from Andorra but not to that of Britain or other places in Europe. The genetic structure of the population further showed that the entire Irish population of the Eurasian pygmy shrew had originated from a single founder event. The authors concluded that it had been introduced in the early (Palaeolithic) or middle (Mesolithic) Stone Age, by boat, probably from south- west Europe. This coincides with work on human populations, which foundHill E. W., Jobling M. A. & Bradley D. G. 2000. Y chromosome variation and Irish origins. Nature 404: 351.McEvoy B., Richards M., Forster P. & Bradley D. G. 2004. The longue dur√©e of genetic ancestry: multiple genetic marker systems and Celtic origins on the Atlantic facade of Europe. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 75: 693-702. a strong genetic similarity in make-up between populations in western Ireland and in northern Spain. This would be explained by a human migration from Spain to Ireland in the late Paleolithic or early Mesolithic. It seems increasingly likely that much of Ireland‚Äôs Lusitanian fauna is in reality an artefact of this era of human expansion in the early part of the Postglacial era. In other words, it seems likely that these species were introduced accidentally with trade items or goods brought by boat from Iberia.

F√©lix Malloum emerged as the chairman of the new Supreme Military Council (Conseil Sup√©rieur Militaire or CSM) and the first days of the new regime were celebrated as many political prisoners were released. His government included more Muslims from northern and eastern Chad, but ethnic and regional dominance still remained very much in the hands of southerners. Economic policies The successor government soon overturned many of Tombalbaye's more odious policies. For example, the CSM attempted to distribute external drought relief assistance more equitably and efficiently, devised plans to develop numerous economic reforms, including reductions in taxes and government expenditures, and abandoned some of the more oppressive measures used to encourage cotton production. Political control and opposition Neither reformers nor skilled administrators, the new military leaders were unable to retain for long the modicum of authority, legitimacy, and popularity that they had gained through their overthrow of the unpopular Tombalbaye. The expectations of most urban Chadians far exceeded the capacity of the new government, or possibly any government, to satisfy them. Moreover, it soon became clear that the new leaders, who were mostly southern military officers, saw themselves as caretakers rather than innovators, and few of Tombalbaye's close associates were punished. Throughout its tenure, the CSM was unable to win the support of the capital's increasingly radicalized unions, students, and urban dwellers. The government suspended the National Union of Chadian Workers (Union Nationale de Travailleurs du Tchad or UNTT) and prohibited strikes, but labour and urban unrest continued from 1975 through 1978. On the first anniversary of the formation of the CSM, Malloum was the target of a grenade attack that injured several top officials and spectators. A year after that, in March 1977, the CSM executed summarily the leaders of a short-lived mutiny by several military units in N'Djamena. Foreign relations and growing dissension The fundamental failures of Malloum's government, however, were most evident in its interactions with France, Libya, and FROLINAT. In his first few months in office, Malloum persuaded a few eastern rebel elements to join the new government. In the north, the derde (Oueddei Kichidemi) returned from exile in Libya in August 1975. But his son, Goukouni Oueddei, refused to respond to his entreaties or those of the government and remained in opposition. When the Command Council of the Armed Forces of the North (Conseil de Commandement des Forces Arm√©es du Nord or CCFAN), a structure set up in 1972 by Hiss√®ne Habr√© and Goukouni to represent northern elements in FROLINAT, continued to refuse negotiations with the CSM over the release of the French archaeologist hostage, France began dealing directly with the rebels. Malloum's government reacted to this embarrassment by demanding the departure of 1,500 French troops, at a time in late 1975 when Chad's military situation was beginning to worsen. Throughout 1976 and 1977, the military balance of power shifted in favor of FROLINAT as Libya provided the rebels with substantially more weaponry and logistical support than ever before. Faya Largeau was placed under siege twice in 1976, and then in June 1977 Barda√Ø fell to the CCFAN. Goukouni and Habr√© The sharp increase in Libyan activity also brought to a head the power struggle within the CCFAN between Goukouni and Habr√©. In 1971 Habr√© had left his position as a deputy prefect in the Tombalbaye government to join Goukouni's rebels. Goukouni and Habr√©, ambitious Toubou leaders from two different and competing clans, became bitter rivals, first within the CCFAN and later within all of Chad. In the CCFAN, the key issues dividing the men were relations with Libya and the handling of the hostage affair. Habr√© opposed vigorously all Libyan designs on the Aozou Strip and favored retaining the French hostage even after most of the ransom demands had been met. Goukouni felt that priority should go to the conflict with the CSM, for which Libyan assistance could be decisive, and that the kidnapping had already achieved more than enough. Habr√© finally split with him in 1976, taking a few hundred followers to fight in Batha and Biltine prefectures and retaining for his group the name Armed Forces of the North (FAN). Goukouni and his followers prevailed (the CCFAN released the hostage to French authorities in January 1977). As the military position of the CSM continued to decline in 1977, Malloum's political overtures to the rebel groups and leaders became increasingly flexible. In September Malloum and Habr√© met in Khartoum to begin negotiations on a formal alliance. Their efforts culminated in a carefully drafted agreement, the Fundamental Charter, which formed the basis of the National Union Government of August 1978. Malloum was named president of the new government, while Habr√©, as prime minister, became the first significant insurgent figure to hold an executive position in a postcolonial government. Habr√©'s ascension to power in N'Djamena was intended to signal to Goukouni and other rebel leaders the government's willingness to negotiate seriously following its reversals on the battlefield in 1978. In February Faya Largeau fell to FROLINAT, and with it roughly half the country's territory. Shortly thereafter, Malloum flew to Sabha in southern Libya to negotiate a cease-fire, but even as it was being codified in March, FROLINAT's position was hardening. Goukouni claimed that all three liberation armies were now united under his leadership in the new People's Armed Forces (Forces Arm√©es Populaires or FAP) and that their objective remained the overthrow of the \\"dictatorial neocolonial regime imposed by France on Chad since August 11, 1960\\". FAP continued to advance toward the capital until it was halted near Ati in major battles with French military forces and units of the Chadian Armed Forces (Forces Arm√©es Tchadiennes or FAT). It was Malloum's hope that the FROLINAT leadership would soften its terms, or possibly undergo renewed fragmentation.

The Hymnus Eucharisticus is a traditional hymn sung by the choir of boy choristers and lay clerks of Magdalen College, Oxford in England. The choristers are boys from Magdalen College School and the lay clerks are male students from Magdalen College at the University. The hymn is best known for its role in the events of May Morning, a 500-year-old tradition where the choir sings the hymn from Magdalen Tower at 6 a.m. each year on 1 May. This initiates the annual May Morning celebrations in Oxford. Large crowds gather in the High Street and on Magdalen Bridge to listen. The sound is very faint, although more recently amplification has been used. The crowds then disperse for other celebratory activities such as Morris Dancing. The hymn is also sung from the gallery of the college's Great Hall (the dining room) during important college occasions. The music was composed by Benjamin Rogers, \\"Doctor of Musique of the University of Oxon, 1685\\", and is entered on a folio bearing the date 1673, indicating that it may have been written prior to that date. The lyrics were alleged to have been written by Dr. Nathaniel Ingelo, to be sung \\"at the civic feast at Guildhall on the 5th July, 1660, while the king and the other royal personages were at dinner\\"; however, the words of Ingelo's hymn differ significantly.The Maudeleyne Grace accessed 11 August 2006.

He has been creating music since the early 1980s. His recording career began in 1988 with a release on Gig Records (home of Falco). Later he joined forces with Patrick Pulsinger to release a string of popular 12-inches on the influential Cheap Records label. His reputation outside Vienna grew quickly and he began collaborating with like-minded artists. By the mid-1990s he'd become a producer and a member of arty techno-punks Chicks on Speed. In 1998 Potuznik founded the Angelika Koehlermann label (which has gone on to release over twenty albums of low-fi pop and wild-style electronic music). Potuznik collaborated with Electronicat, one of the label's first signings, and released a remix album featuring ADULT, The Hacker, Kid606, Dat politics, and Original Hamster. 1999 saw the release of album Submission on DMX Krew's Breakin' Records and Potuznik's artist alias GD Luxxe was born. Widely acclaimed releases followed on renowned indie electronic labels such as Suction, Interdimensional Transmissions, Mego and Detroit's Ersatz Audio. The album Make for Tigerbeat6 was released in 2006 (rereleased in 2007 on Monkey Music). KEY FIGURE Besides Pulsinger & Tunakan or Kruder & Dorfmeister, Gerhard Potuznik is one of Austria‚Äôs key figures, when it comes to the electro and alternative scenes. Active since the late 80ies, when Acid House changed his life as much as Postpunk did before, Potuznik does it all and works as a musician, remixer, DJ and head of his own label. To this day, he has released eight solo records as well as countless maxis on legendary labels like Cheap and Mego, Disko 8, Ersatz Audio, Relish orTigerbeat 6. Besides that, Potuznik is also producing acts like Chicks On Speed, Mediengruppe Telekommander, Minisex, Janosch Moldau, Black Palms Orchester or The Magic Ray. And, of course, not to forget, his band project M√ÑUSE, with Tex Rubinowitz, with whom he has released four records so far. GD LUXXE In the center of all this remains Gerhard Potuznik‚Äôs musical alter ego. As GD LUXXE, he began working on cool electronic tracks in the mid-nineties. Ed DMX, aka DMX Krew, brought GD LUXXE‚Äôs music to London-based label Breakin‚Äô Records, while Interdimensional Transmissions and Ersatz Audio from Detroit released records as much as Canadian record label Suction Records. In the midst of the noughties‚Äô electroclash hype, Gerhard re-discovered his guitar, which was the foundation of ‚ÄûBetween Zero and Eternity‚Äú, the record that was released in 2004 on US cult label Ersatz Audio. Its successor ‚ÄûMake‚Äú (2006) was released by Tigerbeat 6 in the US, continues the path. Minimalistic guitars are the starting pointers, that mutate into unrecognizable sounds on the computer, until templates like ‚ÄûRock‚Äôn‚ÄôRoll‚Äú, ‚ÄûRetro‚Äú or ‚ÄûElectro‚Äú don‚Äôt quite work anymore. In the end of 2008, the eight solo record called ‚ÄûCrave‚Äú was released. It showed a more accessible side of Gerhard Potuznik and the song ‚ÄûBelieve‚Äú made it to the second place of Austria‚Äôs FM4 Charts. THE HAPPY SUN aka Gerhard Potuznik After ‚ÄûCrave‚Äú, things started to get hectic in Gerhard‚Äôs studio. More and more bands and musicians knocked on his doors, looking for a spot to be produced or mixed by him. This led to the establishment of ‚ÄûPhlox‚Äú, a dubtechno label on which Gerhard started releasing tracks with Martin ‚ÄûDibek‚Äú Sovinz. Besides that he also recorded classic indie rock songs, in the beginning without much of a plan, more to just have a compensation to the ever-growing work load with M√§use, Minisex, Janosch Moldau, Christian Fuchs (Black Palms Orchester) and Christina ‚ÄûChra‚Äú Nemec. In late 2018, a dozen songs were left from the recorded material, songs that stood for the new style and didn‚Äôt have much in common with the electric sounds of the past. ‚ÄûThe Happy Sun‚Äú was born and Gerhard returned to his roots. Music he once recorded on with two cassette decks, cheap electric guitars and even cheaper drum computers ‚Äì a wild mix of The Cure, Wire, H√ºsker Du, Joy Division/New Order and similar bands. A few of these recordings were re-recorded for THE HAPPY SUN, but the majority of the part is made up of completely new songs.

She was named for Ensign Carl A. Weeden (1916‚Äì1941), who was killed during the attack on Pearl Harbor. Weeden was laid down on 18 August 1943 at Orange, Texas, by the Consolidated Steel Corporation; launched on 27 October 1943, sponsored by Mrs. Alice N. Weeden; and commissioned on 19 February 1944, with Lieutenant Commander C. F. Tillinghast, Jr., in command. Service history Named for Ensign Carl A. Weeden (1916‚Äì1941), who was killed during the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor while serving on USS Arizona, the ship was launched on 27 October 1943 at the port of Orange, Texas, on the Sabine River and was christened by Carl Weeden's grandmother. =World War II, 1944-45= After a fitting-out period complicated by the necessity for repairs to her power plant, the destroyer escort departed Galveston, Texas, on 30 March 1944 for her shakedown cruise. Arriving at Bermuda on 5 April, she spent the rest of the month in training exercises; she left Bermuda on 1 May, and arrived in Boston, Massachusetts, on the 6th. She completed voyage repairs on the 14th and moved to Provincetown, Massachusetts, where she served for a month as target ship for the Atlantic Fleet Torpedo Squadron Training School. Near the end of June, she reported for duty in Escort Division 56. On 4 July, she departed Boston in the screen of a convoy bound for Bizerte, Tunisia. The entire round-trip voyage, during which she escorted convoys in both directions, occupied her time until 18 August when she re-entered Boston. After training exercises at Casco Bay, Maine, she rendezvoused with another Bizerte-bound convoy near Norfolk, Virginia, in mid-September. About half way across the ocean, CortDiv 56 received orders to part company with the convoy and head for Plymouth, England, where they picked up a convoy of LSTs bound for the United States. Arriving home on 25 October, she again completed voyage repairs and conducted anti-submarine warfare (ASW) exercises at Casco Bay. On 17 November, she joined another trans-atlantic convoy at Norfolk. That voyage took her via Gibraltar to Oran, Algeria, thence back to the United States, at Boston where she arrived at the end of the last week in December. She completed repairs in the navy yard at Charlestown early in January 1945, and then moved to Norfolk where she served briefly as a school ship. On 28 January, the destroyer escort departed Norfolk for duty with the Pacific Fleet. She transited the Panama Canal on 7 February and laid in a course for Manus in the Admiralty Islands, where she arrived late in the month. After a week of repairs at Manus, the warship received orders assigning her to the Philippine Sea Frontier and got underway for Leyte. From March to September, she served under that command, escorting convoys both among the various islands of the Philippines and between the Philippines and American bases in other island groups. Her first escort assignment was a round-trip voyage to Ulithi and back to Leyte. In April, she saw a convoy safely to Hollandia, New Guinea, and returned to Leyte with a formation of tugs. Early in May, she made a high-speed mail delivery on the Philippine circuit, visiting Zamboanga, Mindoro, Iloilo, Manila, and Subic Bay. For the remainder of May and the entire month of June, she operated in the Philippines, either patrolling the entrance to San Pedro Bay, Leyte; escorting convoys from Leyte to Manila; or making the inter-island mail run. In July, Weeden made two round-trip voyages escorting convoys between Leyte and Ulithi. At the conclusion of the second run, she steamed to Subic Bay where she joined the escort of a convoy bound for Okinawa. She departed Subic Bay on 27 July with a large group of LSTs and LSMs, and after evading a typhoon, arrived at Okinawa on 4 August. Three days later, the destroyer escort started back to Leyte. During her return voyage, the atomic bomb fell on Japan; and soon after her arrival at Leyte, the Japanese capitulated. =Post-war activities, 1945-46= Over the next few weeks, Weeden completed escort missions in support of the developing occupation of former Japanese territory. Late in August, she made a voyage from Manila to Okinawa and back. Following that, the destroyer escort screened a British escort carrier to Nagasaki, where the latter ship picked up former Allied prisoners of war for repatriation. On the return voyage, Weeden herself carried 70 Dutch former prisoners as far as Okinawa and then continued on to Subic Bay for repairs. En route, she received orders to assume plane guard duty on a station located about 100 miles north of Luzon. She performed that duty for four days and then resumed her voyage to the Philippines. She arrived in Subic Bay on 26 September and remained there, undergoing repairs, until 10 November. After a stop at Manila from 10 to 26 November, Weeden got underway to return to the United States. En route she stopped at Eniwetok and Pearl Harbor before arriving in San Pedro, California, on 17 December. After five months of inactivity, she was finally placed out of commission on 9 May 1946, and was berthed with the San Diego Group, Pacific Reserve Fleet. =Naval Reserve training, 1946-57= In November 1946, Weeden resumed activity, though she remained out of commission. On 20 November, she reported for duty training naval reservists in the 11th Naval District. After almost four years of that duty, she changed status once more, when she was placed in commission, in reserve, on 26 May 1950. Almost three months later, Weeden reported for duty with the Pacific Fleet, though her mission ‚Äî Naval Reserve training in the 11th Naval District ‚Äî appears to have remained the same. Over the next seven years her training cruises took her north to British Columbia, south as far as Callao, Peru, and west to the Hawaiian Islands. Her center of operations, however, remained the coast of California. =Decommissioning and sale= On 26 November 1957, Weeden began inactivation overhaul at Portland, Oregon. She was decommissioned on 26 February 1958 and was berthed at Astoria, Oregon, with the Columbia River Group, Pacific Reserve Fleet. She remained there just over a decade until 30 June 1968, at which time her name was struck from the Navy List. She was sold for scrapping to Zidell Explorations, Inc., of Portland, Oregon, on 27 October 1969.

F., Leipzig He first observed it for his own country and then for other countries. The theory holds that for any country, that public expenditure rises constantly as income growth expands. The law predicts that the development of an industrial economy will be accompanied by an increased share of public expenditure in gross national product: Wagner's law suggests that a welfare state evolves from free market capitalism due to the population voting for ever-increasing social services as general income levels grow across broad spectrums of the economy. In spite of some ambiguity, Wagner's statement in formal terms has been interpreted by Richard Musgrave as follows: Graph showing kink in increasing public expenditure in the \\"Peacock‚ÄìWiseman hypothesis\\". As per the study on public expenditure for the period 1891‚Äì1955 in U.K. conducted by Peacock and Wiseman based on Wagner's Law, it was found to be still applicable. It was further stated that: * there has been considerable increase in revenue to the governments due to the economic developments over the years, thereby leading to a boost in public expenditure; * the government simply cannot ignore the demands that people make regarding various services, especially when there is an increase in revenue collection at a constant rate of taxation; * during times of war, tax rates are increased by the government to generate more funds to meet the increase in defense expenditure. This is known as the displacement effect. Such 'displacement effect' is created when the earlier lower tax and expenditure levels are displaced by new and higher budgetary levels. But it remains the same even after the war as people get used to them. Therefore, the increase in revenue results in rise in government expenditure.

The term internet was originally coined as a shorthand for internetwork in the first specification of the Transmission Control Program, , by Vint Cerf, Yogen Dalal, and Carl Sunshine in 1974.Vint Cerf, Yogen Dalal, Carl Sunshine, Specification of Internet Transmission Control Program, RFC 675, (December 1974) Due to the widespread deployment of the Internet protocol suite in the 1980s by educational and commercial networks beyond the ARPANET, the core network became increasingly known as the Internet, treated as a proper noun. Accordingly, its name has since been consistently spelled with an initial capital letter in the English language by technical organizations such as the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), the Internet Society, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), the W3C. Technical authors still also use the uncapitalized form in singular and plural (internets) forms to describe the interconnection of multiple individual networks. The Oxford English Dictionary notes that the global network is usually \\"the internet\\", but most of the American historical sources it cites use the capitalized form. The spelling \\"internet\\" has become commonly used, as the word almost always refers to the global network; the generic sense of the word has become rare in non-technical writings. As a result, The Chicago Manual of Style and the Associated Press (AP) both revised their formerly capitalized stylization of the word to lowercase \\"internet\\" in 2016. The New York Times, which followed suit in adopting the lowercase style, noted that such a change is common practice when \\"newly coined or unfamiliar terms\\" become part of the lexicon. The Internet versus generic internets The Internet standards community historically differentiated between an internet, as a short-form of an internetwork, and the Internet: treating the latter as a proper noun with a capital letter, and the former as a common noun with lower-case first letter. An internet is any set of inter-connected Internet Protocol (IP) networks. The distinction is evident in Request for Comments documents from the early 1980s, when the transition from the ARPANET, funded by the U.S. Department of Defense, to the Internet, with broad commercial support, was in progress, although it was not applied with complete uniformity.RFC 871 (1982) \\"The 'network' composed of the concatenation of such subnets is sometimes called 'a catenet,' though more often‚Äîand less picturesquely‚Äîmerely 'an internet.RFC 872 (1982) \\"[TCP's] next most significant property is that it is designed to operate in a 'catenet' (also known as the, or an, 'internet')\\" Another example from that period is IBM's TCP/IP Tutorial and Technical Overview () from 1989, which stated that: > The words internetwork and internet is simply a contraction of the phrase > interconnected network. However, when written with a capital \\"I,\\" the > Internet refers to the worldwide set of interconnected networks. Hence, the > Internet is an internet, but the reverse does not apply. The Internet is > sometimes called the connected internet. In the Request for Comments documents that define the evolving Internet Protocol standards, the term was introduced as a noun adjunct, apparently a shortening of \\"internetworking\\"The form first occurring in the RFC series is \\"internetworking protocol\\", RFC 604: \\"Four of the reserved link numbers are hereby assigned for experimental use in the testing of an internetworking protocol.\\" The first use of \\"internet\\" is in RFC 675, in the form \\"internet packet\\". and is mostly used in this way. As the impetus behind IP grew, it became more common to regard the results of internetworking as entities of their own, and internet became a noun, used both in a generic sense (any collection of computer networks connected through internetworking) and in a specific sense (the collection of computer networks that internetworked with ARPANET, and later NSFNET, using the IP standards, and that grew into the connectivity service we know today). In its generic sense, internet is a common noun, a synonym for internetwork; therefore, it has a plural form (first appearing in the RFC series RFC 870, RFC 871 and RFC 872) and is not capitalized. In a 1991 court case, Judge Jon O. Newman used it as a mass noun: \\"Morris released the worm into INTERNET, which is a group of national networks that connect university, governmental, and military computers around the country.\\" Argument for common noun usage In 2002, a New York Times column said that Internet has been changing from a proper noun to a generic term. Words for new technologies, such as phonograph in the 19th century, are sometimes capitalized at first, later becoming uncapitalized. In 1999, another column said that Internet might, like some other commonly used proper nouns, lose its capital letter. Capitalization of the word as an adjective also varies. Some guides specify that the word should be capitalized as a noun but not capitalized as an adjective, e.g., \\"internet resources.\\"E.g. Usage examples = Style guides = In 2016, The Chicago Manual of Style announced that its 17th edition would remove the capitalization of \\"internet.\\" The same year, the Associated Press announced that the 2016 AP Stylebook will no longer capitalize \\"internet\\". The Modern Language Association's MLA Handbook does not specifically mention capitalization of Internet, but its consistent practice is to capitalize it (the MLA website capitalizes its usage of both \\"Internet\\" and \\"Web\\"). = Media publications = Examples of media publications and news outlets that capitalize the term include the United States Government Printing Office, Time, and The Times of India. In addition, many peer-reviewed journals and professional publications such as Communications of the ACM capitalize \\"Internet\\", and this style guideline is also specified by the American Psychological Association in its electronic media spelling guide. A few of the publications that do not capitalize internet are The Economist, the Financial Times, The Times of London, The Guardian, The Observer, the BBC, and The Sydney Morning Herald. Wired News, an American news source, adopted the lower- case spelling in 2004. Media companies like BuzzFeed and Vox Media avoid capitalizing the \\"internet\\" similarly. Around April 2010, CNN shifted its house style to adopt the lowercase spelling. The New York Times announced their decision in May 2016 to decapitalize all instances of \\"internet\\" for reasons similar to AP's; The Times also cited its own overarching goal to use styles that will be least distracting to its readership. As Internet connectivity has expanded, it has started to be seen as a service similar to television, radio, and telephone, and the word has come to be used in this way (e.g. \\"I have the internet at home\\" and \\"I found it on the internet\\"). =Regional differences= According to Oxford Dictionaries Online, as of April 2016 the spelling Internet remains more usual in the US, while internet has become predominant in the UK.

It was believed by some that if a person could build a house on common land in one night, the land then belonged to them as a freehold. There are other variations on this tradition, for example that the test was to have a fire burning in the hearth by the following morning and the squatter could then extend the land around by the distance they could throw an axe from the four corners of the house. Origins From a period spanning the seventeenth to the beginning of the nineteenth centuries, the expansion of the Welsh population combined with poverty brought about a series of incidents of squatting on isolated patches of land in the most rural parts of Wales. The practice arose because of the pressure of the lack of land due to the land enclosures of the period, and the taxation laws established by landowners. Family units paid taxes based on the land they inhabited, so families with adult and married children faced paying additional taxes on a second home, even if it was on the same land. Legal status T≈∑ unnos has no status in English common law (the legal code which applied to England and Wales in this period), although there is some tradition of legal discussion about the point at which land occupied by squatters without title may be regarded as a legitimate possession. This legendary belief may bear some relation to genuine folk customs and actual practices by squatters encroaching on common or waste land. The tradition may have provided squatters with a sense that their actions enjoyed some legitimacy conferred by an older code of laws more in tune with values of social justice than the supposed \\"Norman yoke\\". Many modern day commentators and local historians accept the claim that the t≈∑ unnos is a tradition enshrined in law. Many localities in Wales and England have a house or houses which may be identified as a one night house in local folklore. These may in fact be properties that were originally built by squatters and may be constructed in a vernacular building tradition using locally available materials. The Ugly House (T≈∑ Hyll) is a celebrated example in Snowdonia. Many of these legends seem to be passed on in ignorance of the broader tradition of the one night house and may feature picturesque details based on variants of the traditions noted above. These legends generally take the form of a prominent member of local society proposing a wager with a landless family that members who could raise a house in a night and a day could keep the property. Some versions of these legends may emphasise that the family may cheat and win out over the complacent authority figure by building a very small hut or by simply building a hearth and chimney. A good general account of one night house traditions is provided in a recent book by the British anarchist and writer on housing issues, Colin Ward. Ward considers the one night house tradition in the context of squatting and other informal systems of occupying and using land and relates accounts from England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales (he observes that similar traditions exist in Turkey, France, North and South America), which demonstrate clear parallels in different folk traditions. Architectural development Very little is known in detail about the building of these structures, their numbers or inhabitants, and no accurate representations survive.WILIAM, Eurwyn: The Welsh Cottage. Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales. 2010 Most Tai Unnos (pl.) were originally made of turf and soil, with a roughly thatched roof. Once established, the walls were often replaced with local materials, including clay and stone. An experimental construction in Carmarthenshire in 2006 demonstrated that a rudimentary structure could be assembled quickly. The squatters may not have depended exclusively on agriculture and in some areas may have worked in quarries and mines. This development led to dispersed settlement patterns seen in the Welsh landscape today. Materials from early stages of construction may have been replaced by higher quality timber and slates, available via the new railways. Single storey T≈∑ Unnos cottages were modified by raising the roofs and enlarging the windows. Revival In 2009, the Welsh woodland charity Coed Cymru were invited to show a design in Washington, D.C.. Part of the Smithsonian Folklife Festival, it showcased Wales as the country of 2009.

She was a daughter of Duke Xi of Qi and sister of Duke Xiang and Duke Huan of Qi. She was the main wife of Duke Huan of Lu and mother of Duke Zhuang of Lu. She is best known for having an incestuous relationship with her brother Duke Xiang, who had her husband murdered. Her clan name was Jiang (Âßú) and Wen was her posthumous title. Marriage and childbirth In 709 BC, during the reign of her father Duke Xi of Qi, Wen Jiang married Duke Huan of Lu, who had ascended the throne of the neighbouring State of Lu in 712 BC. Three years later, Wen Jiang gave birth to a boy. The boy had the same birthday as his father, therefore he was given the name Tong, meaning \\"the same\\", and was made the Crown Prince of Lu. Murder of Duke Huan of Lu In 698 BC Wen Jiang's father Duke Xi of Qi died and was succeeded by his son Duke Xiang of Qi. Before her marriage to Duke Huan of Lu, Wen Jiang and her older half-brother Duke Xiang had had an incestuous affair. Chapter XII. In 694 BC, Wen Jiang and her husband Duke Huan visited her home state of Qi, and Wen Jiang and Duke Xiang renewed their sexual liaison. When Duke Huan found out about their relationship, Duke Xiang ordered his half brother Prince Pengsheng to murder Duke Huan when he was drunk. The people of Lu were incensed at Duke Xiang's crime, but could not do anything because Qi was a stronger state. To appease Lu, Duke Xiang had Pengsheng (:zh:ÂÖ¨Â≠êÂΩ≠Áîü) executed as a scapegoat. Crown Prince Tong, the son of Wen Jiang and Duke Huan, subsequently succeeded his father as ruler of Lu, to be known as Duke Zhuang of Lu. Later life After the death of her husband, Wen Jiang stayed in Qi and continued the incestuous relationship with her brother Duke Xiang. In 693 BC Duke Xiang married a daughter of the king of Zhou, the nominal ruler of all China, but the Zhou princess died only a year later. Chapter II. In 686 BC Duke Xiang was murdered by his cousin Wuzhi, who usurped the Qi throne but was killed the following year. Prince Xiaobai, another brother of Wen Jiang, ascended the Qi throne, known as Duke Huan of Qi. Wen Jiang died in the seventh month of 673 BC, during the 21st year of her son Duke Zhuang's reign. Other children Besides Duke Zhuang, Wen Jiang and Duke Huan had two other sons named Shu Ya and Ji You. Duke Huan also had an older son named Qingfu with a concubine. Qingfu, Shu Ya, and Ji You were founders of three powerful clans that later controlled the power of Lu. Together they are called the Three Huan for all being descendants of Duke Huan. Ji You's lineage, called Jisun or Ji, eventually formed the splinter state of Fei.

The remaining attribute indicates how many parts where shipped. ::* Referential constraints known as Foreign keys ensure that these attributes can only hold values that are also found in the corresponding attributes in the Supplier and Parts relations. ::* It is assumed that only one shipment exists for each supplier/part pairing, which isn't realistic for real world scenarios. This is intentionally oversimplified for pedagogical purposes, as is the entire database.  SQL  The following SQL schema is one possible expression of the Suppliers-and-Parts database. CREATE TABLE Supplier ( SID int primary key, SName varchar(10) NOT NULL, Status int NOT NULL, City varchar(10) NOT NULL ) CREATE TABLE Part ( PID int primary key, PName varchar(10) NOT NULL, Color int NOT NULL, Weight real NOT NULL, City varchar(10) NOT NULL ) CREATE TABLE Shipment ( SID int NOT NULL FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES Supplier(SID), PID int NOT NULL FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES Part(PID), Qty int NOT NULL, PRIMARY KEY (SID, PID) ) Notes: # The ID attributes are simple integers, but they could be (among other things) UUIDs or a system- defined identifier type that holds system-generated values. # The choice of VARCHAR(10) is arbitrary and would be too small for real-world use. # The application of the NOT NULL constraint to all attributes is a design decision based on the view that NULLs are to be avoided. It is not, strictly speaking, a requirement of the schema.

The GUNT replaced the fragile alliance led by F√©lix Malloum and Hiss√®ne Habr√©, which collapsed in February 1979. GUNT was characterized by intense rivalries that led to armed confrontations and the Libyan intervention in 1980. Libya intervened in support of the GUNT's President Goukouni Oueddei against the former GUNT Defence Minister Hiss√®ne Habr√©. Because of international pressures and uneasy relations between Goukouni and Libyan leader Muammar al-Gaddafi, Goukouni asked the Libyans to leave Chad in November 1981; they were replaced by an Inter-African Force (IAF). The IAF showed itself unwilling to confront Habr√©'s militia, and on June 7, 1982, the GUNT was ousted by Habr√©; Goukouni fled into exile. The GUNT, always under the leadership of Goukouni, became a coalition of the opposition groups aiming to overthrow Habr√©. Libya played once again a decisive role, providing massive support to Goukouni, and reducing the GUNT to the status of a Libyan proxy. A French intervention blocked GUNT from overthrowing Habr√© in 1983 and limited Libyan-GUNT control to Northern Chad. Internal dissensions and problems with Libyan patronage, including the arrest of Goukouni by the Libyans, caused the disintegration of the GUNT in 1986. Civil war and mediation attempts From 1979 to 1982, Chad experienced unprecedented change and spiraling violence. Southerners finally lost control of what remained of the Chadian government, while civil conflicts became significantly more internationalized. In early 1979, the fragile Malloum-Habr√© alliance collapsed after months of aggressive actions by Habr√©, including demands that more northerners be appointed to high government offices and that Arabic be used in place of French in broadcasting. Appealing for support among the large communities of Muslims and Arabs in N'Djamena, Habr√© unleashed his Armed Forces of the North (FAN) on February 12. With the French garrison remaining uninvolved, FAN sent F√©lix Malloum into retirement (under French protection) and drove the remnants of the Chadian Armed Forces (FAT, the regular army) toward the south. On February 22, Goukouni Oueddei and the People's Armed Forces (FAP) entered the capital. By this time, most of the city's Sara population had fled to the south, where attacks against Muslims and nonsoutherners erupted, particularly in Sarh, Moundou, and throughout Moyen-Chari Prefecture. By mid-March more than 10,000 were said to have died as a result of violence throughout the south. In early 1979, Chad became an open arena of unrestrained factional politics. Opportunistic power seekers sought to gather followers (often using sectarian appeals) and to win support from Chad's African neighbors. Between March 10 and August 21, four separate conferences took place in the Nigerian cities of Kano and Lagos, during which Chad's neighbors attempted to establish a political framework acceptable to the warring factions. Chad's neighbors, however, also used the meetings to pursue interests of their own, resulting in numerous externally generated complications and a growing number of factions brought into the process. For example, at one point, the Libyan leader Gaddafi became so angry with Habr√© that the Libyan sent arms to Colonel Wadel Abdelkader Kamougu√©'s anti-Habr√© faction in the south, even though Kamougu√© was also anti-Libyan. At the second conference in Kano, both Habr√© and Goukouni were placed under what amounted to house arrest so Nigeria could promote the chances of a Kanembu leader, Lol Mahamat Choua. In fact, Nigerian support made Choua the Chadian titular head of state for a few weeks, even though his Third Liberation Army was only a phantom force, and his domestic political support was insignificant. Within Chad the warring parties used the conferences and their associated truces to recover from one round of fighting and prepare for the next. Goukouni becomes head of the GUNT The final conference culminated in the Lagos Accord of August 21, 1979, which representatives of eleven Chadian factions signed and the foreign ministers of nine other African states witnessed. The Lagos Accord established the procedures for setting up the Transitional Government of National Unity, which was sworn into office in November. By mutual agreement, Goukouni was named president, Kamougu√© was appointed vice- president, and Habr√© was named minister of national defense, veterans, and war victims. The distribution of cabinet positions was balanced between south (eleven portfolios), north, center, and east (thirteen), and among prot√©g√©s of neighboring states. A peacekeeping mission of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU), to be drawn from troops from Republic of the Congo, Guinea, and Benin, was to replace the French. This force never materialized in any effective sense, but the OAU was committed to GUNT under the presidency of Goukouni. GUNT, however, failed. Its major participants deeply mistrusted each other, and they never achieved a sense of coherence. As a result, the various factional militias remained armed. By January 1980, a unit of Habr√©'s army was attacking the forces of one of the constituent groups of GUNT in Ouadda√Ø Prefecture. Shortly thereafter, N'Djamena plunged into another cycle of violence, and by the end of March 1980 Habr√© was openly defying the government, having taken control of a section of the capital. The 600 Congolese troops of the OAU peacekeeping force remained out of the fray, as did the French, while units of five separate Chadian armies prowled the streets of N'Djamena. The battles continued throughout the summer, punctuated by more OAU mediation efforts and five formal ceasefires. It became evident that the profound rivalry between Goukouni and Habr√© was at the core of the conflict. By mid-1980 the south - cut off from communication and trade with N'Djamena and defended by a regrouped, southern army - had become a state within a state. Colonel Kamougu√©, the strongman of the south, remained a prudent distance away from the capital and waited to negotiate with whichever northerner emerged as the winner. Libyan intervention In 1980 the beleaguered Goukouni turned to Libya, much as he had done four years earlier. With the French forces having departed in mid-May 1980, Goukouni signed a military cooperation treaty with Libya in June (without prior approval of the all-but-defunct GUNT). In October he requested direct military assistance from Gaddafi, and by December Libyan forces had firm control of the capital and most other urban centers outside the south. Habr√© fled to Sudan, vowing to resume the struggle. Although Libyan intervention enabled Goukouni to win militarily, the association with Qaddafi created diplomatic problems for GUNT. In January 1981, when Goukouni and Gaddafi issued a joint communiqu√© stating that Chad and Libya had agreed to \\"work for the realization of complete unity between the two countries\\", an international uproar ensued. Although both leaders later denied any intention to merge their states politically, the diplomatic damage had been done. Throughout 1981 most of the members of the OAU, along with France and the United States, encouraged Libyan troops to withdraw from Chad. One week after the \\"unity communiqu√©\\", the OAU's committee on Chad met in Togo to assess the situation. In a surprisingly blunt resolution, the twelve states on the committee denounced the union goal as a violation of the 1979 Lagos Accord, called for Libya to withdraw its troops, and promised to provide a peacekeeping unit, the Inter-African Force (IAF). Goukouni was skeptical of OAU promises, but in September he received a French pledge of support for his government and the IAF. But as Goukouni's relations with the OAU and France improved, his ties with Libya deteriorated. One reason for this deterioration was that the economic assistance that Libya had promised never materialized. Another, and perhaps more significant, factor was that Gaddafi was strongly suspected of helping Goukouni's rival within GUNT, Acyl Ahmat, leader of the Democratic Revolutionary Council (Conseil D√©mocratique R√©volutionnaire or CDR). Both Habr√© and Goukouni feared Acyl because he and many of the members of the CDR were Arabs of the Awlad Sulayman tribe. About 150 years earlier, this group had migrated from Libya to Chad and thus represented the historical and cultural basis of Libyan claims in Chad. Habr√© overthrows Goukouni As a consequence of the Libya-Chad rift, Goukouni asked the Libyan forces in late October 1981 to leave, and by mid- November they had complied. Their departure, however, allowed Habr√©'s FAN - reconstituted in eastern Chad with Egyptian, Sudanese, and, reportedly, significant United States assistance - to win key positions along the highway from Ab√©ch√© to N'Djamena. Habr√© was restrained only by the arrival and deployment in December 1981 of some 4,800 IAF troops from Nigeria, Senegal, and Zaire. In February 1982, a special OAU meeting in Nairobi resulted in a plan that called for a ceasefire, negotiations among all parties, elections, and the departure of the IAF; all terms were to be carried out within six months. Habr√© accepted the plan, but Goukouni rejected it, asserting that Habr√© had lost any claim to legitimacy when he broke with GUNT. When Habr√© renewed his military advance toward N'Djamena, the IAF remained essentially neutral, just as the French had done when the FROLINAT marched on Malloum three years earlier. FAN secured control of the capital on June 7. Goukouni and other members of GUNT fled to Cameroon and eventually reappeared in Libya. For the remainder of the year, Habr√© consolidated his power in much of war- weary Chad and worked to secure international recognition for his government.

There were two Bulgarian and one Greek school in the village in the beginning of 20th century.D.M.Brancoff. \\"La Macedoine et sa Population Chretienne\\". Paris, 1905, p.176-177. The population decrease can be attributed to many causes including World War I, the population exchange with Turkey following the Treaty of Lausanne, World War II, as well as the Greek Civil War which affected Sklithro and the surrounding region. Following the Civil War, the village saw an exodus of people migrating to North America, Australia, and other European countries, where opportunity and a better way of life existed. Today, the village is experiencing a bit of a rejuvenation. Many of the formerly abandoned homes have been or are in the process of being renovated. Agriculture continues to be the mainstay of the village and is celebrated with an annual potato festival in the month of August. During the summer months tourism also plays an important role, with visitors including former residents or their decedents. Also, nearby are the tourist attractions of Nymfaio and the Arcturos bear refuge.

Proposal In 1873, as now, Dublin University comprised a single college, Trinity College, which was founded in 1592. It was entirely restricted to members of the established Anglican Church of Ireland till the Catholic Relief Act 1793. The Irish Church Act 1869 disestablished the church, but scholars, fellows and professors of the college were still required to be Anglicans. The secular Queen's University of Ireland had been founded in 1845‚Äì50 with colleges in Belfast, Cork, and Galway. Lacking government recognition were the Catholic University of Ireland founded in Dublin in 1851 and the Presbyterian Magee College founded in Derry in 1865. The 1873 bill proposed to abolish the failing Galway college and make all the others colleges of an expanded Dublin University. All religious requirements for students and faculty in all colleges would be abolished. Trinity College's Theology faculty would be detached and removed to the control of the Church of Ireland. Opposition The proposal was strongly opposed by the Roman Catholic Church in Ireland, and partly opposed by the Presbyterians and the existing Trinity College faculty. It was defeated by three votes on its second reading in the House of Commons on 11 March 1873. This was one factor in the eventual fall of the government in 1874. Later The abolition of the Anglican test oath for Dublin University and Trinity College, except in the School of Divinity, was effected by the University of Dublin Tests Act, 1873 (An Act to abolish Tests in Trinity College and the University of Dublin; 36 & 37 Victoria, c. 22) introduced by Henry Fawcett and hence called \\"Fawcett's Act\\". Until 1970, the Irish Catholic hierarchy discouraged Catholics from attending the university. Under the Disraeli administration, the University Education (Ireland) Act 1879 altered the Queen's University of Ireland into the Royal University of Ireland and facilitated access to it for the Catholic and Presbyterian colleges. Trinity College and Dublin University were not affected.

E. van Vogt. It incorporates concepts from the General semantics of Alfred Korzybski and refers to non-Aristotelian logic. The novel is a continuation of the adventures of Gilbert Gosseyn from The World of Null-A (1945) and The Pawns of Null-A (1948). Plot Gilbert Gosseyn wakes to find he is Gosseyn Three, in telepathic contact with Gosseyn Two. One of the spare bodies used in his reincarnation machinery was found and forced to life by the approach of an immense space fleet from another galaxy, manned by the primordial ancestors of man, gripped in an eon-long war with mutants equally old. The space-fleet is ruled by an unstable youngster who seems to possess many of the same powers, including a double-brain, as Gosseyn. Gosseyn must school the youth in Null-A sanity, save the Earth from a cabal of gangsters and businessmen who oppose the return of the Games Machine, discover the secret reasons behind the endless horrifying war, and stop the intrigues of Enro the Red to return to power. Reception Dave Langford reviewed Null-A Three for White Dwarf #64, and stated that \\"The book can only be read as parody or in a spirit (several bottles' worth) of overwhelming nostalgia for the 'Golden Age'.\\" Many critics regard Null-A Three as the weakest of the Null-A books, and the estate- authorized Null-A sequel Null-A Continuum ignores its events.

An activist in the Civil Rights Movement and lawyer, he was also a Freedom Rider and the legal representative for Malcolm X. He was the highest-ranking African-American elected official in New York City when he was Manhattan borough president from 1966 to 1977, the longest tenure at that position. He later became an entrepreneur whose investments included the New York Amsterdam News and the Apollo Theater in Harlem.Salazar, Cristian (December 27, 2009). \\"Percy Sutton, Attorney for Malcolm X, Dies at 89 ‚Äî Percy Sutton, Attorney for Malcolm X and Pioneering Media Mogul, Dies at 89\\". The Associated Press (via ABC News). Accessed December 27, 2009. Early life, military service, education, and family Sutton was born in San Antonio, Texas, the youngest of fifteen children born to Samuel Johnson (\\"S.J.\\") Sutton and his wife, Lillian. His father, an early civil-rights activist, was one of the first black civil servants a teacher and school administrator in Bexar County, Texas, and used the initials \\"S.J.\\" for fear his first name, Samuel, would be shortened to Sambo. In addition to being a full-time educator, S.J. farmed, sold real estate and owned a mattress factory, funeral home and skating rink.Martin, Douglas. \\"Percy E. Sutton, Political Trailblazer, Dies at 89,\\" The New York Times, Monday, December 28, 2009. Sutton's siblings included G. J. Sutton, who became the first black elected official in San Antonio, Handbook of Texas Online and Oliver Sutton, a judge on the New York Supreme Court. At age twelve, Percy stowed away on a passenger train to New York City, where he slept under a sign on 155th Street in the Harlem neighborhood of the Manhattan borough of the city. Ironically, his oldest sister, Lillian Sutton Taylor who was 20 years his senior, was attending Columbia Teacher's College at the time. His oldest brother John Sutton, a food scientist who had studied under George Washington Carver, and also in Russia, was living in New York at the time Percy arrived there. His family clearly had resources, a sense of adventure and determination during a time when many African-Americans were extremely limited in options. His family was committed to civil rights, and he bristled at prejudice. At age thirteen, while passing out leaflets in an all-white neighborhood for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), he was beaten by a policeman. He joined the Boy Scouts of America and attained the rank of Eagle Scout in 1936 and was recognized with the Distinguished Eagle Scout Award as an adult. Sutton stated that scouting was a key factor in shaping his life. Percy and Leatrice Sutton married in 1943. He later took up stunt-flying on the barnstorming circuit, but gave it up after a friend crashed. During World War II, he served as an intelligence officer with the Tuskegee Airmen ‚Äì the popular name of a group of African American pilots who flew with distinction during World War II as the 332nd Fighter Group of the U.S. Army Air Forces. He won combat stars in the Italian and Mediterranean theaters. Sutton attended Prairie View A&M; University in Prairie View, Texas; the Tuskegee Institute in Tuskegee, Alabama; and the Hampton Institute in Hampton, Virginia without receiving a degree. He went on to attend Columbia Law School and then Brooklyn Law School. Legal, business, and political career During the 1950s and 1960s, Sutton became one of America's best-known lawyers. He represented many controversial figures, such as Malcolm X. After the murder of Malcolm X in 1965, Sutton and his brother Oliver helped to cover the expenses of his widow, Betty Shabazz. Sutton's civil-rights advocacy took him even further in the minds of many. Being jailed with Stokely Carmichael and other activists endeared him to the Harlem community and showed many that he was willing to place himself in harm's way for his client's sake. Sutton was a longtime leader in Harlem politics, and was a leader of the Harlem Clubhouse, also known as the \\"Gang of Four\\". The Clubhouse has dominated Democratic politics in Harlem since the 1960s. His allies in running the Clubhouse were New York City Mayor David Dinkins, U.S. Representative Charles Rangel, and New York Secretary of State Basil Paterson ‚Äì whose son, David Paterson, became New York Governor in 2008. He also was a life member of the Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity. He was a member of the New York State Assembly in 1965 and 1966. On September 13, 1966, he was elected Borough President of Manhattan, to fill the vacancy caused by the appointment of Constance Baker Motley to the federal bench.Sutton Elected Manhattan Borough President in the New York Times on September 14, 1966 (subscription required) He served in that post until 1977, when he ran for the Democratic nomination for New York City Mayor against Bella Abzug, a former U.S. Representative; U.S. Representative Herman Badillo; incumbent New York City Mayor Abraham Beame; New York Secretary of State Mario Cuomo; and U.S. Representative Ed Koch; Koch won the nomination and the general election. In his race for mayor, Sutton surprised his liberal political base when he turned temporarily to the right. He assailed the rising crime rate, as he termed the situation \\"a city turned sick with the fear of crime\\". He attacked criminals for \\"cheating, stealing, and driving away our families and our jobs.\\"Dominic Sandbroook, Mad as Hell: The Crisis of the 1970s and the Rise of the Populist Right (New York City: Alfred A.

Schmidt was appointed to conduct an inquiry into FBI reports that detainees at Guantanamo Bay were being subjected to inhumane interrogation. The unclassified summary of Schmidt's report acknowledges that one high-value detainee was subjected to almost continuous interrogation, for 18 to 20 hours per day, for almost two months. It describes the long-term effect of this interrogation as \\"degrading and abusive\\", but that it did not rise to the level of \\"inhumane\\".

The waterway was originally known as the North Mosquito River, but was renamed after George Montagu-Dunk, 2nd Earl of Halifax (for whom Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada is also named), during the British occupation of Florida (1763‚Äì1784).Hometown News: East Volusia has rich history Geography The Halifax River originates at Tomoka Bay, at the confluence of the Tomoka River, Bulow Creek, and Halifax Creek, adjoining Tomoka State Park. The Halifax River's drainage basin (or catchment) includes most of eastern Volusia County, which includes the flow from the Tomoka River and Halifax Creek. The total area covered is 1008.3 km¬≤. Water flows south for a distance of . The Halifax River merges with Spruce Creek and the Mosquito Lagoon just before it connects to the Atlantic Ocean via the Ponce de Leon Inlet. The Halifax River runs through the cities of Ormond Beach, and Daytona Beach. It also runs next to the Jackie Robinson Ballpark on City Island and the Ponce de Leon Inlet Lighthouse. The Halifax Harbor Marina is located on the waterway as well. =Cities along the river= The Halifax River runs through two cities, and past four cities and one town, and was used to define portions of these cities' borders. The middle of the riverbed at the time the borders were established was the line to define the borders between cities. The cities below have either historic significance or cultural lore connecting them to the Halifax River. They are ordered from the beginning of the river to its end. * Ormond Beach, Florida - Named after James Ormond, an early settler who arrived in 1807 and took a Spanish land grant. The area was chosen in 1873 by the Corbin Lock Company of New Britain, Connecticut, as a winter haven for their employees. Most of the early settlers were also from Connecticut. The Town of Ormond-By-The-Halifax was incorporated on April 22, 1880. * Holly Hill, Florida - Located entirely on the mainland north of Daytona Beach, the area was originally settled in 1876. Incorporated on July 1, 1901, the city was named by its founder, William Samuel Fleming Sr., because of its similarity to his Irish Holywood home. * Daytona Beach, Florida - Named after Mathias Day of Mansfield, Ohio, who bought land on the Halifax River in 1870, and developed the land into a settlement. Many of the early settlers were also from Ohio. The town of Daytona was incorporated in 1876. 50 years later, in 1926, the separate towns of Daytona, Daytona Beach, Kingston and Seabreeze merged into the present City of Daytona Beach. * South Daytona, Florida - Originally known as Blake, located entirely on the mainland south of Daytona Beach, this community was settled circa 1886 and was granted a Post Office in 1887. Blake remained unincorporated until 1926, when the new consolidated Daytona Beach annexed it. The residents decided to fight annexation in the courts, until they were able to form their own city in 1938. The small community incorporated as the City of South Daytona, thus becoming another namesake of Mathias Day.Ponce Inlet * Daytona Beach Shores, Florida - This relatively new, small community is located entirely on the beach peninsula, south of Daytona Beach. The community was formed in 1960 by a group of moteliers who called themselves 2,000 Cottages. The City incorporated in 1967 as Daytona Beach Shores, becoming another namesake of Mathias Day. Commonly called \\"The Shores\\" by local residents to avoid confusion. * Port Orange, Florida * Ponce Inlet, Florida =Bridges= There are currently six bridges along the river, including one bascule bridge. They are ordered from north to south. * Granada Bridge (SR 40) - The first bridge to cross the Halifax River opened here in 1887, connecting two parts of Ormond Beach, Florida, mainland to the beach peninsula. A later bridge, the Rockefeller Memorial Bridge, a bascule bridge, opened on March 2, 1954. This was replaced by the present high clearance bridge in 1983.Ormond Beach Historical Trail * Seabreeze Bridge (SR 430) - The first Seabreeze Bridge was built in 1902, connecting what was then known as Ocean Blvd. in Seabreeze (now Seabreeze Blvd) to Mason Ave. in Daytona on the mainland. The original bridge was funded and constructed by the Post family who settled the town of Seabreeze. In 1926, Seabreeze was incorporated into Daytona Beach, and the bridge was then sold to the bridge authority. In 1942, it was found to be in disrepair vehicular traffic was no longer permitted, only regulated pedestrian usage. It was determined that the water opening was the smallest on the Eastern seaboard as well, so plans came to replace it. A two-lane bascule bridge was opened in 1950 to replace the older bridge. A pair of high clearance bridges were built to replace the drawbridge in 1997. The westbound bridge connects with Seabreeze Blvd., and the eastbound span connects with Oakridge Blvd. * Main Street Bridge (CR 4040) - The first bridge at this location was opened in 1888. The bridge connected Fairview Avenue from mainland Daytona to Seabreeze Avenue (named Main Street today) in old Daytona Beach (two separate cities at the time). In 1959, a bascule bridge was constructed as a replacement. * Broadway Bridge (US 92) - The first span at this location was built in 1912. In 1947, the Broadway Bascule Bridge was built, connecting Volusia Avenue (now ISB) on the Mainland to Broadway Avenue on the beach peninsula.Fifth International Bridge Engineering Conference: Tampa, Florida April 3‚Äì5 - Page 31 by National Research Council (U.S.). Transportation Research Board - Bridges - 2000 In 2001, a new high-span Broadway Bridge was dedicated to replace the old drawbridge. The new bridge is more famous for its flair than its purpose; Mosaics of manatees, dolphins and other wildlife native to Florida give the bridge some tourist appeal. * Veterans Memorial Bridge (CR 4050) - The \\"South Bridge\\" from old Daytona near City Island to old Daytona Beach on the peninsula was built in 1899 with assistance from Henry M. Flagler. The bridge connected Orange Avenue from the Mainland to Silver Beach Avenue on the Peninsula. A replacement bascule bridge was constructed in 1954, and was renamed the Veterans Memorial Bridge in 1959. The bridge was closed in June, 2016 for destruction and replacement with a tall span bridge.http://www.veteransmemorialbridge.com * Port Orange Causeway (SR A1A) - Commonly called the Port Orange Bridge or the Dunlawton Avenue Bridge, this bridge connects the mainland city of Port Orange, Florida with the beach peninsula. The first one at this location was built in 1906, made of sable palm pilings and pine bridge timbers; The bridge was washed away by a hurricane in 1932. A wooden toll bascule bridge was built here in 1951. The drawbridge was replaced in 1990 by a new high bridge which presently spans the river. The Florida State Legislature designated the new bridge as the Congressman William V. Chappel Jr. Memorial Bridge. History =Native Americans= The area of the Halifax River was first settled about 7,000 years ago, by Native American tribes who were the ancestors of tribes such as the Timucua Indians. The natives lived on fish and oysters, leaving shell mounds on both sides of the Halifax River. Most of the shell mounds were used by later settlers to build roads, but a few remain in the area, preserved as historical sites, such as Green Mound, Nocoroco, Ormond Mound, and Spruce Creek Mound Complex. The natives were likely part of the St. Johns culture. =European exploration= First Spanish occupation 1513-1763 After Juan Ponce de Le√≥n claimed Florida in April 1513, and Pedro Men√©ndez de Avil√©s established St. Augustine in 1565, the Spanish continued to explore the region. In 1569 Captain Antonio de Prado first explored the area around Ponce de Leon Inlet (which he named los Mosquitos, due to the large number of gnats that inhabited the area), and mentioned Nocoroco in his report to the King of Spain, noting that the village was located between two rivers (now known as Tomoka and Halifax). In 1605, Spanish explorer Alvaro Mexia visited and mapped the Halifax River area (named North Mosquito River on his map), noting the native villages of Nocoroco, Cacaroy, Cicale, and Caparaca in his report.Haunted Daytona Beach: A Ghostly Tour of the World's Most Famous Beach by Dusty Smith (2007)An Environmental History of Northeast Florida By James J. Miller (1998) The Spanish brought in Franciscan friars and established Catholic Missions in Florida, in an attempt to convert the natives to Christianity. At their peak, there were 44 such Spanish missions in Florida, and some of them may have been in the Halifax River area. The Spanish also recruited the natives to grow food on primitive farms. However, epidemics of yellow fever in 1649, smallpox in 1650, and measles in 1659 decimated both the Indian and Spanish population in Florida. Several Indian revolts also decimated the population further. By the time Spain ceded Florida to the British in 1763, they had little progress to show for their efforts in the colony and Florida was left as a \\"hollow shell\\", practically devoid of population when the Spanish evacuated. British occupation 1763-1783 Spain ceded Florida to the British in 1763, in exchange for Cuba, at the end of the Seven Years' War/French and Indian War. Britain then divided the territory into East Florida and West Florida, and gave out many land grants to encourage settlers. During the survey of these land grants, the Halifax River received its name in honor of Lord Halifax, who was the British President of the Board of Trade. The British Council of East Florida made 576 grants on family right totaling more than , and 114 grants, totaling , by the approval of the King. After the American Revolution began, Florida became the destination for loyalists from the southern colonies, who were offered land free of taxes or levies for ten years. Colonists that settled in the Halifax River area named their colony Halifax City, which was located near present-day Allandale in Port Orange.Loyalists in East Florida 1774-1785, Wilbur H. Siebert, DeLand Florida (1929)Florida Place Names: Alachua to Zolfo Springs, Allen Morris, (1995) It was during the British occupation when Dr. Andrew Turnbull created the notorious New Smyrna colony, just to the south of the Halifax River, in 1768. The New Smyrna colonists complained about mistreatment during their indentured servitude, and the British Governor in St. Augustine eventually allowed them to leave. Second Spanish occupation 1783-1821 The Spanish joined with the French on the Colonial side, against the British during the American Revolution. After the British loss, they surrendered Florida to Spain in exchange for the Bahamas in the Treaty of Paris (1783). According to the terms of the treaty, the British were obligated to evacuate their colonial subjects; however, Spain allowed any colonists to stay, provided they agreed to swear allegiance to the Spanish Kingdom and convert to Catholicism. During this occupation period, the Spanish made three large land grants in the Halifax River area, one of which went to James Ormond, a Scottish sea captain. Ormond transported Franciscan friars to Florida for the Spanish, who gave him the grant in 1807 as compensation. Two other Spanish land grants (roughly encompassing Daytona Beach and Port Orange) went to absentee landlords, and the areas remained undeveloped. Recreation =Boating= Boating is a popular activity, and there are several marinas and yacht clubs located throughout the Halifax River. The Halifax River Yacht Club was founded in 1896.Gaby, Donald C. (2003): Heaven on the Halifax : a short history of the Halifax River Yacht Club, 1896-2003 (New Baskerville, Fla.: Halifax River Yacht Club, 2003) =Fishing= Fishing is another popular activity in the Halifax River. Fishing is allowed from boats, the banks of the river, or from any of the bridges crossing the waterway. Some of the species that can be found include: trout, catfish, flounder, sheepshead, tarpon, snook, black drum, mangrove snapper and red drum.Daytona Beach News Journal Online: Fishing Report =Wildlife Viewing= The Halifax river supports a diverse community of waterfowl, wading birds, fish, and other wildlife. The river and several of its tributaries (Tomoka River, Strickland, Thomson and Dodson Creek) are designated as a Manatee Sanctuary. Other rare species that inhabit the river basin include the wood stork, bald eagle, and Atlantic salt marsh snake. Numerous other birds can be viewed in the general area of the Halifax River Basin. The Halifax River Trail forms part of the East Coast Greenway, a system of trails connecting Maine to Florida. Navigation history =Intracoastal Waterway= Prior to 1913, navigation channels and canals in Florida were maintained chiefly by private enterprise. In 1882 the Florida East Coast Line Canal and Transportation Co. was organized to develop a waterway from Jacksonville to Biscayne Bay by connecting with canals the St Johns, Matanzas, and Halifax rivers, Mosquito Lagoon, Indian river, Lake Worth, Hillsboro river, New river, and Snake Creek; in 1908 this vast undertaking was completed. The Rivers and Harbors Act of 1927, passed by Congress, authorized the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway, using the route planned out by the Jacksonville District of the U.S. Army Corps Of Engineers. The Waterway was valuable during World War II, after German submarines sank numerous merchant ships off the East Coast. The Corps continues to maintain the navigation channel today, conducting dredgings as needed. Wildlife Gallery Image:HR_DB_Birds0811.jpgA Great Egret wades near the west bank of the Halifax River.

The Egyptian judicial system is based on European and primarily French legal concepts and methods. The legal code is derived largely from the Napoleonic Code. Marriage and personal status are primarily based on the religious law of the individual concerned. Thus, there are three forms of family law in Egypt: Islamic, Christian, and secular (based on the French family laws). The judicial branch plays an important role in the political process in Egypt, as the branch is given the responsibility to monitor and run the country's parliamentary and presidential elections.  History  Egypt was among the first countries in the world after France to establish a judicial institution. The beginning was in 1875 with the enactment of the modern codification under which the Mixed Courts were established. The Egyptian judicial institution that existed in the mid 19th century was characterized by the following: * Courts at that time were not entirely national, but rather there were courts for foreigners known as \\"consular courts\\". * The judicial authority at that time was not the only authority entrusted with giving rulings on disputes, but rather there was another system that had enabled members of the executive authority to issue rulings in certain cases. * Abandonment of the unified judicial system that had existed since the Ottoman rule of Egypt. During the Ottoman era, the judiciary power was undertaken by one person known as the Chief Justice, who was assisted by four deputies representing the four schools of Islamic jurisprudence; Hanafi, Shafie, Maleki and Hanbali. During Mohamed Ali's reign of Egypt and his endeavor to build a modern Egyptian state, two significant developments took place in Egypt, leading to the existence of various bodies of civil judiciary in the country.  Criminal code  Egypt based its criminal codes and court operations primarily on British, Italian, and Napoleonic models. Criminal court procedures had been substantially modified by the heritage of Islamic legal and social patterns and the legacy of numerous kinds of courts that formerly existed. The divergent sources and philosophical origins of these laws and the inapplicability of many borrowed Western legal concepts occasioned difficulties in administering Egyptian law. The criminal code listed three main categories of crime: contraventions (minor offenses), misdemeanors (offenses punishable by imprisonment or fines), and felonies (offenses punishable by penal servitude or death). Lower courts handled the majority of the cases that reached adjudication and levied fines in about nine out of ten cases. At their discretion, courts could suspend fines or imprisonment (when a sentence did not exceed one year). Capital crimes that carried a possible death sentence included murder, manslaughter occurring in the commission of a felony, arson or the use of explosives that caused death, rape, treason, and endangerment of state security. Few convictions for capital crimes, however, resulted in execution. Egypt's laws require that a detained person be brought before a magistrate and formally charged within forty-eight hours or released. An accused is entitled to post bail and had the right to be defended by legal counsel. The Emergency Law of 1958 outlined special judicial procedures for some cases. The law enabled authorities to circumvent the increasingly independent regular court system in cases where people were charged with endangering state security. The law applied primarily to Islamic radicals but also covered leftists suspected of political violence, drug smugglers, and illegal currency dealers. It also allowed detention of striking workers, pro- Palestinian student demonstrators, and relatives of fugitives. The Emergency Law of 1958 authorized the judicial system to detain people without charging them or guaranteeing them due process while an investigation was under way. After thirty days, a detainee could petition the State Security Court to review the case. If the court ordered the detainee's release, the minister of interior had fifteen days to object. If the minister overruled the court's decision, the detainee could petition another State Security Court for release after thirty more days. If the second court supported the detainee's petition, it released the detainee. The minister of interior could, however, simply rearrest the detainee. The government commonly engaged in this practice in cases involving Islamic extremists.  Civil code  The Egyptian Civil Code is the prime source of civil law, and has been the source of law and inspiration for numerous other Middle Eastern jurisdictions, including pre- dictatorship Libya and Iraq as well as Qatar.  Courts  * The Supreme Constitutional Court * Court of Cassation (Ma·∏•kamet El Naq·∏ç) The Court of Cassation, the only one in its category, was established in 1931 and based in Cairo. The Court of Cassation, the exclusive body atop the judicial hierarchy in Egypt, was designated with the purpose of creating a central tool to provide exclusive and uniform interpretation and application of law. The jurisdiction of Court of Cassation basically includes consideration of challenges brought to it by either adversary or by the public prosecution. It also includes examining lawsuits related to judges' actions. In such a case, the court undertakes its role as a court of merit, rather than a court of law. It also has the power to give rulings on requests of reparations for all violated verdicts. The court issues annual collections on approved judicial principles under the title ‚ÄúRulings and Principles of The Court of Cassation‚Äù. * Court of Appeal Courts of Appeal, some which are called Higher Courts of Appeal, have the competence to consider rulings by the courts of first instance falling under its jurisdiction should these rulings be liable for appeal. According to the Egyptian judiciary law, there are seven courts of appeal in Egypt; in Cairo, Alexandria, Tanta, Mansoura, Ismailia, Beni Swaif and Assuit. * Court of First Instance These courts of first instance have the competence to consider lawsuits filed before them as may fall under their jurisdictions. Their rulings are liable to appeal. * Courts of limited jurisdiction These courts have the competence to issue rulings on lawsuits of limited importance, falling under their geographical and term jurisdictions. These rulings are liable to appeal. * Family Court The Family Court (FC) was established in 2004, motivated by the need to differentiate between family litigations and other disputes. It is intended to provide a specialized judiciary tool that would take cognizance of such cases in an atmosphere totally different from that of other lawsuits. This aims to secure psychological peace for the children who may be involved, especially in such cases of tutelage, divorce, alimony, custody, etc. The ultimate objective of this court is to hammer out an amicable settlement for family problems through specialized guidance bureaus. * Egyptian State Lawsuits Authority * Public Prosecution The public prosecution acts as public attorney before criminal courts with the right to file criminal actions. It was given the right by the Egyptian legislation to initiate action even if plaintiff has relinquished his right to do so. * Administrative judiciary This judiciary has the jurisdiction to decide on administrative disputes to which any administrative body is involved. Egypt has adopted a dual system of judiciary, i.e. the ordinary and administrative judiciary.

The leaves are pinnate with two leaflets and a terminal tendril, which twines around supporting plants and structures, helping the sweet pea to climb. In the wild plant the flowers are purple, broad; they are larger and very variable in colour in the many cultivars. Flowers are usually strongly scented. The annual species, L. odoratus, may be confused with the everlasting pea, L. latifolius, a perennial.Brickell, C. (1996). Encyclopedia of Garden Plants. Royal Horticultural Society, London, . Horticultural development Scottish nurseryman Henry Eckford (1823‚Äì1905) cross-bred and developed the sweet pea, turning it from a rather insignificant if sweetly scented flower into a floral sensation of the late Victorian era. His initial success and recognition came while serving as head gardener for the Earl of Radnor, raising new cultivars of pelargoniums and dahlias. In 1870 he went to work for one Dr. Sankey of Sandywell near Gloucester. A member of the Royal Horticultural Society, he was awarded a First Class Certificate (the top award) in 1882 for introducing the sweet pea cultivar 'Bronze Prince', marking the start of association with the flower. In 1888 he set up his development and trial fields for sweet peas in Wem in Shropshire. By 1901, he had introduced a total of 115 of the 264 cultivars grown at the time.Graham Rice, The Sweet Pea Book, Batsford 2002, p.9 Eckford was presented with the RHS Victoria Medal of Honour for his work. He died in 1906, but his work was continued for a time by his son John Eckford. More recently, the association between the sweet pea, the Eckfords and Wem has been highlighted again. In the late 1980s, the Sweet Pea Society of Wem started an annual show. Many of the street signs now carry a sweet-pea motif, and an area of the town is known as Eckford Park. There is also a cultivar 'Dorothy Eckford', named after a family member. Cultivation Sweet pea at fencing Sweet peas have been cultivated since the 17th century and a vast number of cultivars are commercially available. They are grown for their flower colour (usually in pastel shades of blue, pink, purple and white, including bi-colours), and for their intense unique fragrance. They are grown by gardeners for private enjoyment or for exhibition, and in the floristry trade. The large, pea-shaped seeds are sown in cold frames in Spring or Autumn. The seeds benefit from pre-soaking or chipping with a sharp blade. The plants are also available later in the season, as young plants or plugs. They are grown up canes, with the new shoots being regularly pinched out to promote a bushy habit and higher flower yields. Plants typically reach heights of 1-2m, with the flowers appearing in midsummer and continuing for many weeks if regularly deadheaded. Over 50 cultivars have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. See List of AGM sweet peas Pests and diseases The sweet pea plant does suffer from some pests, the most common being aphids. These insects suck the sap out of the plants, reducing growth. Mosaic virus is spread by greenfly, causing yellowing of leaves, distortion of new shoots, and inhibited flowering. A pest called the pollen beetle which is small, shiny and black, eats the pollen and disfigures the flowers. Other pests include caterpillars, thrips, slugs and snails. Another problem is mildew; this is a white powdery coating that covers the leaves and slows down growth. The sweet pea is also susceptible to ethylene in quantities produced by senescing plants. Because of this, growers are encouraged to plant sweet peas away from fruit trees among other plants prone to early dieback or senescence. Toxicity Unlike the edible pea, there is evidence that seeds of members of the genus Lathyrus are toxic if ingested in quantity. A related species, Lathyrus sativus, is grown for human consumption but when it forms a major part of the diet it causes symptoms of toxicity called lathyrism.Dastur, D.K. and Iyer, C.G. (1959). Lathyrism versus odoratism. Nutr. Rev. 17:33-6. In studies of rats, animals fed a diet of 50% sweet pea seeds developed enlarged adrenals relative to control animals fed on edible peas.Dasler, W. (1954). Observations of odoratism (sweet pea lathyrism) in the rat. Journal of Nutrition 53: 105-13. The main effect is thought to be on the formation of collagen. Symptoms are similar to those of scurvy and copper deficiency, which share the common feature of inhibiting proper formation of collagen fibrils. Seeds of the sweet pea contain beta-aminopropionitrile that prevents the cross-linking of collagen by inhibiting lysyl oxidase and thus the formation of allysine, leading to loose skin. Recent experiments have attempted to develop this chemical as a treatment to avoid disfiguring skin contractions after skin grafting.Sweet peas make a second skin - Guardian, UK, July 2008 Genetics Gregor Mendel is today recognized as the \\"Father of Modern Genetics\\" for his work with the cross breeding of pea plants (Pisum sativum) with different characteristics, and sweet pea has been used in a similar way. The sweet pea is thus a model organism being used in early experimentations in genetics, particularly by the pioneer geneticist Reginald Punnett. It is highly suitable as a genetic subject because of its ability to self-pollinate and its easily observed Mendelian traits such as colour, height and petal form. Many genetic principles were discovered or confirmed in this species. It was used by Punnett in early studies of genetic linkage.Punnett, R.C. (1923). Linkage in the sweet pea (Lathyrus odoratus). Journal of Genetics 13: 101‚Äì123. Complementary factor inheritance was also elucidated in sweet peas, from the cross of two pure-breeding white strains which gave rise to a blue hybrid, the blue colour requiring two genes derived independently from the two white parents.Bateson, W., Saunders, E.R. and Punnett, R.C. (1906). Experimental studies in the physiology of heredity. Reports to the Evolution Committee, Royal Society of London 3. Hybridization with Lathyrus belinensis Like the blue rose, the yellow sweet pea remains elusive. Lathyrus belinensis is a related Lathyrus species which has red and yellow flowers. There are ongoing attempts to bring the yellow color into Lathyrus odoratus by crossing it with Lathyrus belinensis. Several new sweet pea cultivars have been created as a result, though not any with the yellow flower color so far.Dawn Edwards.

This organization stayed in place until 2008 when Rausch Intermediate closed, necessitating the return of students in grade five to their neighborhood elementary school and grade six to Brown Middle School. When Tappan Elementary closed in 2013, students were sent to one of the three remaining elementary schools with most being assigned to West Main.

The MiG-29K was developed in the late 1980s from the MiG-29M. Mikoyan describes it as a 4+ generation aircraft. Production standard MiG-29Ks differ from prototypes in features such as a multi-function radar and several new cockpit displays; the adoption of HOTAS (hands-on-throttle-and-stick) controls; the integration of RVV-AE (also known as R-77) air-to-air missiles, along with missiles for anti-ship and anti-radar operations; and several ground/strike precision-guided weapons. The MiG-29K was not ordered into production and only two prototypes were originally built because the Russian Navy preferred the Su-27K (later re-designated Su-33) in the early 1990s. Mikoyan did not stop its work on the MiG-29K aircraft despite the lack of financing since 1992. The programme got a boost in the late 1990s to meet an Indian requirement for a ship-borne fighter following the purchase of a former Soviet aircraft carrier, and the MiG-29K was first received by the Indian Naval Air Arm in 2009. The Russian Navy, with their Su-33s nearing the end of their service lives by 2010, has also ordered the MiG-29K as a replacement. Development =Origins= The MiG-29K project was initiated in the late 1970s when the Soviet Navy developed a requirement for a supersonic carrier-based fighter. As a first step to meet this requirement, the Mikoyan design bureau designed a \\"proof of concept\\" version of the MiG-29 fitted with a stronger undercarriage and a reinforced tail section with an arrestor hook, the MiG-29KVP (Korotkii Vzlet i Posadka, or \\"short take off and landing\\").Belyakov and Marmain 1994, pp. 446‚Äì449. The KVP first flew on 21 August 1982, and was subject to extensive trials which demonstrated it could safely operate from a ski-jump, but ideally a production aircraft needed more power and greater wing area.Belyakov and Marmain 1994, p. 449. It was decided to base the definitive naval version on the advanced MiG-29M (izdeliye \\"Product\\" 9.15) that was already under development, further modified with new undercarriage and folding wings of greater area, with the new model designated the MiG-29K (Korabelniy ‚Äì \\"ship based\\") or Project 9‚Äì31.Gordon and Davison 2005, p. 40.Belyakov and Marmain 1994, pp. 449‚Äì450. The MiG-29K differed considerably from the MiG-29 production model, featuring a new multi-function radar, dubbed Zhuk; a cockpit with monochrome display and use of the HOTAS (hands-on-throttle-and-stick) principle; the RVV-AE air-to-air active homing missiles; antiship and antiradar missiles; as well as air-to-ground precision- guided weapons. To protect the engine from foreign object damage (FOD), the engine inlets were fitted with retractable grills for air flow, rather than metal doors and leading-edge extension auxiliary intake louvres used by land- based MiG-29s. A MiG-29M on display. The MiG-29M was developed into a naval version, the MiG-29K. The MiG-29Ks first flight was performed on 23 July 1988 at Saky by test pilot Toktar Aubakirov.Belyakov and Marmain 1994, p. 452. On 1 November 1989, on the same day as the Sukhoi Su-27K, Aubakirov executed the first carrier landing of MiG-29K on the aircraft-carrying cruiser Tbilisi (now known as Admiral Kuznetsov), the first take-off from the carrier's deck was successfully performed the same day.Williams 2002, p. 129. During 1989‚Äì1991, the MiG-29K underwent further tests aboard Admiral Kuznetsov. The project was put on hold with the collapse of the Soviet Union, while the Russian Navy only pursued the rival Su-33.Donald and March 2001, pp. 152‚Äì153. Mikoyan continued work on the MiG-29K despite the lack of funding. During its tests aboard Admiral Kuznetsov, the aircraft had a springboard-assisted takeoff from strips and long. According to the results of the tests, the landing accuracy proved to be very high, which made it possible at a later stage to switch over to a three-cable arrester system on Admiral Gorshkov. The landing accuracy is additionally enhanced through the employment of an autothrottle system. The takeoff characteristics allow for most flights to be possible under tropical conditions at a ship speed of . =Revival= An Indian Navy MiG-29K performs a high speed climb The MiG-29K programme was revived in response to the decision of the Indian Navy to acquire the former Soviet Navy aircraft carrier Admiral Gorshkov in 2004. When Admiral Gorshkov was part of the Soviet fleet, it was a hybrid aircraft carrier/cruiser using vertical take-off (V/STOL) aircraft; thus the deck was refurbished with a take-off ramp and arrestor wires for operating MiG-29Ks. The aircraft has an enlarged and folding wing, an arrestor hook and a corrosion-protected reinforced fuselage.Rininger 2006, p. 124. One factor favouring the MiG-29K over the Su-33 in the Indian decision was the larger size of the Su-33, which further limited the number of aircraft on deck.Conley 2001, p. 69. Modifications were made to the MiG-29K for Indian requirements, including the Zhuk-ME radar, RD-33MK engine, a combat payload up to , 13 weapon stations, and updated 4-channel digital fly-by-wire flight control system. It is compatible with the full range of weapons carried by the MiG-29M and MiG-29SMT. The problem of lack of aircraft-carrier based AWACS platform may be tackled by further development of dual-seat MiG-29KUB. It is theoretically possible to outfit the MiG-29KUB with powerful radar, and encrypted data links, to permit networking of multiple MiG-29KUB aircraft for AEW coverage. The MiG-29KUB may also be enhanced in areas such as electronic warfare and long-range interdiction. The MiG-29KUB two-seat variant took its first flight on 20 January 2007, followed by the MiG-29K on 25 June 2007. Design Zhukovskiy LII air field =Overview= The MiG-29K is drastically modified from the Mikoyan MiG-29M for naval operations. The airframe and undercarriage are reinforced to withstand the stress experienced upon landing. Folding wings, an arrestor hook, and catapult attachments were added for carrier operations; the aircraft's undercarriage track was also widened. The MiG-29K, unlike the early MiG-29, can both conduct aerial refueling and \\"buddy\\" refuel other aircraft. MiG-29K as a buddy refuelling tanker The MiG-29K has two widely spaced RD-33MKs. The early prototypes were fitted with two RD-33K turbofan engines, each with afterburner thrust of 86.3 kN (19,800 lb) and a possible take-off thrust of 92.2 kN (20,723 lbf) for shipborne operations.Williams 2002, p. 128Gordon and Davison 2005, pp. 46, 92. The RD-33MK engine features 7% higher power over the base RD-33, enabled by the usage of improved materials for the turbine blades.RD-33MK . Klimov.ruPerspective Project Developments at the KLIMOV Aero Engine Design Company. Klimov, 2007. Internal fuel was increased from , to give a combat radius of 850 km (531 mi). The combat radius can be increased to with three underwing fuel drop tanks. The maximum weight of the aircraft grew from , to allow for increased payloads. The MiG-29KUB two-seat fighter, intended for pilot training, can also conduct combat missions identical to the single-seat fighter. = Cockpit and avionics = The aircraft is equipped with three multifunctional color liquid-crystal displays (seven LCDs on the MiG-29KUB), a four-channel digital fly-by-wire flight control system, passive homing system for anti-radar missiles, Sigma-95 GPS receiver, TopGun helmet-mounted targeting system and electronic countermeasures (ECM). Additionally, an onboard oxygen generating system eliminates the need for heavy oxygen canisters. The types of combat missions undertaken by the MiG-29K can be increased by adding optronic/infrared imaging reconnaissance pods. The Zhuk-ME is a development of the N010 Zhuk radar, introducing functions such as terrain mapping and following. The radar, weighing , features improved signal processing and a detection range of up to vs a 5 m2 RCS target for the export variant. In the air targeting mode, up to ten targets can be tracked and four targets engaged simultaneously. In air to surface mode the radar can detect a tank from up to away and a bridge from away, a naval destroyer could be detected up to away, while up to two surface targets can be tracked at once. The radar has a scanning area of ¬±85 degrees in azimuth and +56/-40 in elevation. The Zhuk-AE radar was developed with modular approach, enabling upgrade of existing Zhuk ME radars deployed in MiG-29 platforms into the active electronically scanned array (AESA) Zhuk-AE standard. India is already operating the Bars phased array radar on its Su-30MKI and has specified AESA as a critical element of the MRCA platform. The MiG-29K can be outfitted with an IRST system integrated with both optical and laser systems. It can provide targeting solutions for ground and air targets at up to , with all-round 360-degree coverage. The IRST can also provide detailed trajectories of missiles at closer ranges. =Weapons and defensive capabilities= A MiG-29K and its armaments at MAKS Airshow. The folded wings maximise the limited space available on an aircraft carrier. MiG-29K has a GSh-30-1 30 mm cannon in the port wing root. It has provisions for laser-guided and electro-optical bombs, as well as air-to-surface missiles like Kh-25ML/25MP, Kh-29T, Kh-31G/31A, Kh-35U, and rockets. Kh-31P passive radar seeker missiles are used as anti- radiation missiles. Kh-35, Kh-31A antiship missiles are for anti-ship roles; for aerial combat air-to-air missile like RVV-AE, R-27ER/ET and R-73E are fitted. The aircraft is also adaptable to various foreign weapons. The MiG-29K has a combination of low-observable technology, advanced electronic-warfare capabilities, reduced ballistic vulnerability, and standoff weapons to enhance the fighter's survivability. According to Mikoyan, extensive use of radar- absorbent materials reduce the MiG-29K's radar signature 4‚Äì5 times over the basic MiG-29. The RD-33MK turbofan engine was also engineered to reduce infrared signature and improve aircraft camouflage. Operational history =India= MiG-29K of INAS 303 executes a low approach to the aircraft carrier in 2014. In 2004 India ordered 12 MiG-29K single-seat and 4 MiG-29KUB two-seat fighters. The MiG-29K is to provide both airborne fleet air defence and surface attack capabilities. Deliveries began in December 2009.\\"Russia delivers 4 MiG-29 fighters to India\\". RIA Novosti, 12 February 2009 Prior to their delivery to India, the MiG-29Ks underwent testing on board . In January 2010, India and Russia signed a deal worth US$1.2 billion for the Indian Navy to receive an additional 29 MiG-29Ks. The MiG-29K entered operational service with India in February 2010.\\"Indian MiGs enter service\\" . AirForces Monthly, 19 February 2010. Further deliveries of five MiG-29Ks and a flight simulator took place in May 2011. Further deliveries are to continue through 2012. The fighters were based at in Goa on India's west coast until joined the navy under the name of in last quarter of 2013. Vikramaditya was expected to carry up to 24 MiG-29K/KUB fighters. The future indigenous aircraft carrier , being built by India, is also likely to carry these aircraft. MiG-29K of the Indian Navy Further MiG-29K orders by India were frozen after a MiG-29KUB crashed during testing in Russia prior to delivery to India; the Indian Defence Ministry commented that the crash cast a shadow on the credibility of the aircraft. Russia later announced that pilot error had caused the crash, and there was no need to ground the aircraft. In August 2011, MiG's General Director Sergei Korotkov announced that the final 5 out of the 16 aircraft contracted in 2004 would be delivered by the end of the year; and that deliveries of a second batch of 29 MiG-29Ks would begin in 2012. In November 2012, the MiG-29K/KUB completed sea trials for the Indian Navy.MiG-29K carrier trials for India completed. Flightglobal.com, 1 November 2012 One problem is that Western and Ukrainian sanctions on Russia have prevented Mikoyan importing components for assembly at the factory, instead they have had to be installed \\"on the flightline\\" in India. In a 2016 report, India's national auditor CAG criticized the aircraft due to defects in engines, airframes and fly-by-wire systems. The serviceability of MiG-29K was reported ranging from 15.93% to 37.63% and that of MiG-29KUB ranging from 21.30% to 47.14%; with 40 engines (62%) being rejected/withdrawn from service due to design defects. These defects are likely to reduce the service life of the aircraft from the stated 6000 hours. In 2017, the Indian government announced the planned replacement of the MiG-29 with 57 new aircraft, with a competition primarily between the French Dassault Rafale and the American Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet. In December 2018 when addressing the press on the eve of Navy Day CNS Admiral Lanba noted regarding the MiG-29K, \\"there is no issue on supplies of spare parts from Russia at the moment... The MiG-29K fleet has been performing well now.\\" The Indian Navy plans to deploy the MiG-29K onboard its first domestically built carrier, the INS Vikrant, and will acquire further combat jets with updated capabilities for this purpose. Indian Navy Chief Admiral Sunil Lanba announced that issues related to maintenance and availability of spare parts for the MiG-29K fleet, which had previously undermined their readiness, had been resolved. =Russia= Kubinka Airbase The 279th Shipborne Fighter Aviation Regiment of the Russian Navy has a fleet of 21 Su-33 fighters whose service lives were expected to be reached by 2015. Around 10 to 12 will receive an upgrade including the Gefest SVP-24 bombsight for free-fall bombs, giving them a limited ground attack capability, but more aircraft were needed. It was less cost-effective to open the Su-33 production line for a small run than to piggy-back on the Indian Navy's order of MiG-29K's. India paid $730 million for the development and delivery of 16 units, while 24 for the Russian Navy would cost approximately $1 billion. The Russian Navy ordered 24 MiG-29Ks in late 2009 for Admiral Kuznetsov. Deliveries of the MiG-29K for the Russian Navy started in 2010. MiG and Russia were in final negotiations for an order for more MiG-29K/KUB aircraft in August 2011. An order for 20 MiG-29KR fighter-bombers and four MiG-29KUBR operational trainers for operation from Admiral Kuznetsov, replacing the Sukhoi Su-33, was officially announced in February 2012. However, in 2015, Major-General Igor Kozhin, the Commander of the Navy's Air and Air Defence Forces, announced that a second fighter regiment would be formed to augment the current force, with the intention that the MiG-29s be used by this new unit, with some existing Su-33s refurbished for further use. In October 2016, four MiG-29KR/KUBR from the 100th Independent Shipborne Fighter Aviation Regiment formed part of the air group aboard Admiral Kuznetsov as the ship deployed with its battle group to the Mediterranean Sea as part of the Russian campaign in Syria. On 13 November 2016, a MiG-29KUBR on operations in the Mediterranean crashed en route back to Admiral Kuznetsov.http://www.popularmechanics.com/military/navy- ships/a24155/kuznetsov-second-crash-in-three-weeks/ Variants ;MiG-29K :Indian single seat variant. ;MiG-29KR :Russian single seat variant, replaces Ukrainian and Indian equipment with Russian. ;MiG-29KUB :Indian tandem two- seat operational trainer variant. ;MiG-29KUBR :Russian tandem two-seat operational trainer variant. ;MiG-29KVP :(KVP ‚Äì Korotkaya Vzlet Posadka ‚Äì Short take-off landing {STOL}) Several aircraft converted to article 9‚Äì12 standard, (or 9‚Äì18?), with high-lift systems strengthened undercarriage and arrestor hook, for research into deck landings and pilot training.

The main site of the Observatory is Monte Porzio Catone. Part of the Istituto Nazionale di Astrofisica since 2002. Monte Mario Monte Mario Observatory (IAU code 034), the \\"historical\\" Observatory of Rome, located at 84 via del Parco Mellini in the northwest part of the city, atop Monte Mario, since 2002 is only the administrative seat of the Istituto Nazionale di Astrofisica (INAF). Nevertheless, the Astronomical Observatory of Roma has the responsibility for the Astronomical Copernican Museum and the Solar Tower in Monte Mario. Monte Porzio Catone Monte Porzio Catone is located approximately 20 kilometres southeast of Rome proper. The Astronomical Observatory of Rome (OAR) was established in 1938, inside the 19th-century Villa Mellini on the hill of Monte Mario in Rome. In the same period, a new Observatory was built in Monteporzio Catone, in order to host a large telescope. With the Second World War, this project failed. In 1948, the building of Monteporzio was assigned to the Astronomical Observatory of Roma. In 1965, a new observing station was built in Campo Imperatore (2200 mt. above sea level), on the Gran Sasso mountain. In 2017, the management of this station was transferred to the newly-established Osservatorio D‚ÄôAbruzzo. Since 1988, the researchers of the Astronomical Observatory of Rome have been carrying out their research activity in Monteporzio Catone. The seat of Monteporzio includes the main building (three floors), the guesthouse, two small hoses for the janitors, AstroLAB, LightLAB, and the Monteporzio Telescope (MPT). These three latter structures are entirely devoted to public outreach. A few areas inside the main building are also occasionally used for visitors, i.e. historical rooms, ‚ÄúLivio Gratton‚Äù conference room, the modern library inside the main dome. The total area occupied by the structure within the compound sum up to about 8.750 square metres. Together with the garden, it adds up to about 75.000 square metres. OAR is responsible for the management of the ‚ÄúMuseo Astronomico e Copernicano‚Äù (Astronomical Copernican Museum ‚Äì MAC), in the ground floor of Villa Mellini. MAC was established in 1873 by Arthur Wolynski, upon the basis of a Copernican collection, put together on the occasion of the fourth centenary of the birth of Copernicus. This collection was implemented over the years with scientific instruments and historical books belonging to the older Observatories in the centre of Rome, following the evolution of astronomical instruments, private donations, and public institutes. The Museum's collection includes, among other obejcst, seventeenth century eyepieces, fourteenth century telescopes, sextants for measuring the angular distance between stars, astrolabes and night dials (the oldest astrolabe dates back to the twelfth century). Moreover, there is a rich collection of armillary spheres, as well as sky and earth globes, including Mercatore's and Cassini's. The old library contains about 4000 volumes, some of which are rare and precious. For instance, there is a fourteenth century manuscript code, which collects the main astronomical works of the time, 5 incunabula, over 270 ‚Äúcinquecentine‚Äù (sixteenth century books) and 450 ‚Äúsecentine‚Äù (seventeenth century books). In particular, among books of ancient Astronomy, one could mention the first editions of Copernicus‚Äô works, Ptolem's Almagestos, Sacrobosco's Sphaera, Hevel's Theatrum Cometarum, Scheiner's Rosa Ursina, and the first editions of Galilei's works. Scientific and Technological Activity OAR's scientific productivity is quite high among the 20 institutes belonging to INAF, as proved by ANVUR's National check and by Nature Index. For example, in the year between November 2016 and November 2017, OAR researchers have taken part in writing 160 articles in referees reviews, which have produced 1597 citations. From 2014 to 2017, the total number of articles is 430, with 7555 citations. The scientific activity covers all the research areas inside INAF. In the Eighties and Nioneties, the scientific area which involved most researchers, and was therefore the most productive was Stellar Astrophysics, with a remarkable number of researchers who were active in the areas of Extra- galactic Astrophysics and Solar Astrophysics. Starting from the mid-Nineties, a number of researchers were recruited in the areas of Relativistic Astrophysics, and Astrophysics of the Solar System.

Ochratoxin A is the most prevalent and relevant fungal toxin of this group, while ochratoxins B and C are of lesser importance. Ochratoxin A is known to occur in commodities such as cereals, coffee, dried fruit, and red wine. It is possibly a human carcinogen and is of special interest as it can be accumulated in the meat of animals. Thus, meat and meat products can be contaminated with this toxin. Exposure to ochratoxins through diet can cause acute toxicity in mammalian kidneys. It has been suggested that carriers of alleles associated with phenylketonuria may have been protected from spontaneous abortion caused by ochratoxin exposure, providing a heterozygous advantage for the alleles despite the possibility of severe mental retardation in the rarer instance of inheritance from both parents.Woolf, L.

The film censorship laws of the province of Nova Scotia were challenged on the basis that it constituted criminal law which could only be legislated by the federal government. The Court held that though the censorship laws had a moral dimension to it, the laws did not have any prohibition or penalty required in a criminal law. Background The Amusement Regulation Board of Nova Scotia, created under the Theatre and Amusement Act, banned the film Last Tango in Paris from being shown in the province. McNeil, a journalist, attempted to challenge the law on the basis that it was a constitutionally invalid law. The issue before the Supreme Court was whether the regulation of morality alone constitutes a criminal law. In a five to four decision the Court held that the law was concerning property and civil rights under section 92(13) of the B.N.A. Act and not criminal law. Reasons of the court Ritchie J., writing for the majority found that the pith and substance of the Act concerned the \\"regulation, supervision and control\\" of film, a form of private property, in the province. Consequently, the law was strictly a matter of Property and Civil Rights, a matter that was in the exclusive jurisdiction of the province. Further, Ritchie applied the definition of Criminal law from the Margarine Reference case which required that a criminal law must concern the public interest and must consist of a prohibition with a penalty. Ritchie found that there was no clear prohibition because the law did not provide details on what was prohibited, rather, it left it to the discretion of the board. Dissent Laskin CJ., in dissent, found that the law had no connection with Property and Civil Rights. Laskin identified the law as colourable. In form it concerned property but in substance it concerned the regulation of \\"taste\\". He noted how the province had already unsuccessfully attempted to prosecute the distributor of the film under the obscenity laws of the Criminal Code, and saw this as another attempt at the same goal.

It is located mid-way on the Wirral Peninsula, and is mostly incorporated into the town of Bebington and the most westerly point of Spital forms the most northern edge of Bromborough. Spital is primarily a residential suburb which has apartments, and close proximity to the motorway network. The area contains shops, two bars, a chip shop and a primary school. History Legend has it that Irish patron saint, St Patrick, blessed a well in the local Brotherton Park during a trip to England. Spital has a history spanning over 800 years. The first recorded dwelling in the area was a small chapel built sometime before AD 1183 with the name St. Thomas the Martyr. It is not known who built this chapel but was probably used by workers and owners of the Poulton Estate, founded in 1133 at nearby Poulton Lancelyn. In 1283, the brethren of Bebington were given licence to use the forested land where Spital stands today to be used as a hospital for lepers. This hospital was probably attached to the chapel already in the area, but there are no remains of this building today. The word \\"spital\\" was a term given to a place or building (or \\"spital house\\") that acted as a hospital or colony for lepers. Therefore, it seems obvious that the name Spital derives from this; however it could also be argued that Spital's name derived from the term \\"hospitality\\" - this was due to the large proportion of people who worked as servants at the Poulton estate in Poulton Lancelyn. However many villages with the name \\"Spital\\" in their title can be put down to hospitals being in the area many years previously. Poulton cum Spital and Spital Old Hall were the original names for the village until part of this was formally dropped at the end of the 19th century. The area became more popular during the 20th century after Spital Station on the Chester to Birkenhead railway was connected to the Mersey Railway line in 1891, and businessmen and workers could easily reach places of work, primarily in Liverpool. Spital was a particularly popular place to live with sea merchants and ships' captains due its proximity to the River Mersey and Irish Sea during the height of maritime activity in the area. Spital was originally part of Cheshire when on 1 April 1974 it was absorbed into the new administrative county of Merseyside created through the reforms of the Local Government Act 1972. Spital has since grown and is now part of the larger town of Bebington which borders Birkenhead. After the ending of the workhouse system in 1930, Wirral Workhouse was renamed Clatterbridge (County) General Hospital and under the National Health Service became Clatterbridge Hospital. In 1958, it became a centre specialising in Oncology. The centre was built in to enlarge cancer care services from a cramped site on Myrtle Street in Liverpool - since then the site has been expanded and the hospital has been awarded 3 out of 3 stars in the NHS scoring system. Geography Spital is in the eastern part of the Wirral Peninsula, approximately south-south-east of the Irish Sea at New Brighton, east-north-east of the Dee Estuary at Gayton and about west of the River Mersey at Bromborough. The area is situated at an elevation of around above sea level. Governance Spital is situated within the UK Parliamentary Constituency of Wirral South. Since the 2010 General Election the constituency Member of Parliament is Alison McGovern (Labour). At local government level, Spital and the neighbouring village of Poulton Lancelyn are part of the Clatterbridge Ward of the Metropolitan Borough of Wirral.

Traditionally, graduates of the Military Academy are commissioned as officers in the Egyptian Army. However, they may serve in other branches and commands of the Egyptian military establishment. The Military Academy contains branches, which provide additional training and skills. It also features a prolonged study system so as to graduate more elite officers to serve in the army, such as the Branch of Military Arts and Thunderbolt School. The Academy's current Director is Major General Ashraf Faris. History The founding of the Military Camp in Egypt dates back to the year 1811, when the first Military Camp was set up in the citadel area of Cairo, Egypt's capital. In 1820, the Military camp moved to Aswan, and in 1908, it was relocated to the Abbassia Military Barracks in the El-Koba Bridge area. Later the camp expanded and Military School was established in the camp in 1909. Originally admission in the school was reserved for members of the Egyptian upper class, the Academy changed its rules for admission in 1936 to allow the sons of lower and middle-class families to enter.Keegan, p.162.Cleveland, p.304. In March 1938, the Military School's name changed to become the Royal Egyptian Military Academy. After the Egyptian Revolution of 1952, the Military Academy's present site was established and inaugurated by the late Egyptian President Gamal Abd El-Nasser on March 3, 1955. Degrees and syllabus The Military Academy awards two types of degrees: * Bachelor's degree in Military Sciences * Military Studies Completion Certificate (for University graduates who choose a career in the Egyptian Armed Forces upon graduation) The institution also offers additional courses: * Language courses in English and Arabic (for officers of foreign countries like Sudan or Germany) Notable alumni * Abdel Fattah el-Sisi - current President of Egypt * Mohamed Kaid Saif - Deputy Commander-in-Chief of Yemen, Vice President and member of the Yemeni Revolutionary Command Council of 26 September 1962. * Gamal Abdel Nasser - second President of Egypt * Anwar Sadat - third president of Egypt * Abdul Munim Riad - Egyptian Army chief of staff and commander of the Jordanian front in the Six-Day War * Saad el-Shazly - Prominent commander of the Egyptian Army during Yom Kippur War * Ahmed Ismail Ali - Chief of Staff during Anwar Sadat's presidency * Abd-Al-Minaam Khaleel ‚Äì Commander of the Egyptian 2nd Army during the Yom Kippur War. * Abdel Ghani el-Gamasy ‚Äì Egyptian military leader and Director of Operations for all forces participating in the 1973 Yom Kippur War. * Abdullahi Ahmed Irro ‚Äì General in the Military of Somalia. * Hassan Abshir Farah ‚Äì former Mayor of Mogadishu, Interior Minister of Puntland, and Prime Minister of Somalia. * Hisham Hafiz ‚Äì Saudi Arabian newspaper publisher and author. * Hosni Mubarak ‚Äì Deposed 4th President of Egypt (1981-2011). * Hussein el-Shafei ‚Äì member of Egypt's July, 1952 revolutionary leadership council and former Vice-president of Egypt. * Khalid Islambouli ‚Äì assassinated Anwar Sadat. * Omar al-Bashir ‚Äì former President of Sudan. * Mohammed Aly Fahmy ‚Äì Commander of the Egyptian Air Defense Command (May 1969-January 1975) and Chief-of-Staff of the Egyptian Armed Forces (January 1975-October 1978). * Mustafa Fahmi Pasha ‚Äì politician, cabinet minister, and two-time Prime Minister of Egypt. * Rashad Mehanna ‚Äì Egyptian colonel who played a significant role in the Egyptian Revolution of 1952. *Emmerson Mnangagwa ‚Äì current President of Zimbabwe See also * Egyptian Army * Military of Egypt Notes External links *The Military Academy website References * * Category:Educational institutions established in 1811 Category:Military academies ","title":"Egyptian Military Academy"},{"id":"3687222","text":"John Rankin Rathbone (17 March 1933 ‚Äì 12 July 2002), known as Tim Rathbone, was the Conservative Member of Parliament (MP) for the seat of Lewes between 1974 and 1997. Rathbone was the son of a Conservative MP also called John Rankin Rathbone, who represented Bodmin from 1935 until his death in the Battle of Britain in 1940. Rathbone's mother, Beatrice Wright then succeeded him as MP at the by-election, serving until 1945. Tim Rathbone was a great- nephew of Eleanor Rathbone, who had been an independent MP for the Combined English Universities between 1929 and 1946, and a staunch women's rights campaigner. He was a great-grandson of William Rathbone, a Liberal MP for Liverpool and later Carnarvonshire. Rathbone was educated at Eton College and Christ Church, Oxford, where he read Philosophy, Politics and Economics. After a spell as merchant banker, he emigrated in 1958 to the United States where he worked for the advertising firm Ogilvy and Mather until 1966 when he returned to the UK. In 1960, he married Margarita Sanchez y Sanchez, a Cuban, with whom he had three children: John-Paul, Michael and Cristina. Upon his return to Britain, Rathbone was recruited by party chairman Edward du Cann to work for the Conservatives as Chief Publicity Officer. He was relatively ineffectual in this position, partly because his brief overlapped with other Conservative staffers. Rathbone moved to the Charles Barker Group, a leading advertising agency in 1968, where he remained for 18 years. He was appointed to a string of directorships within the group and was managing director of Ayer Barker until 1974. In 1973, he was selected to fight the safe Conservative seat of Lewes, which he duly won in the February 1974 election. Upon entering Parliament, it was clear that Rathbone had a reforming zeal about him, and pushed for declaration of Members' interests, electoral reform and devolution. In 1981, he divorced his first wife and the following year married Susan Stopford Sackville. Rathbone was also a staunch critic of apartheid: On a visit to Rhodesia, he proposed ousting Ian Smith and holding transitional elections for a majority black government. In 1986, he invited Oliver Tambo, a prominent member of the South African opposition to address Conservative MPs. When the Conservatives entered government in 1979, Rathbone was appointed as Parliamentary Private Secretary to Gerald Vaughan, the Minister for Health, a position he held until 1982. He later served as PPS to other Ministers. He did not achieve high ministerial office however because of his rebelling tendencies, which saw many label him as a \\"wet\\". He opposed the Bill that scrapped the Greater London Council and other metropolitan authorities in 1984, and also the poll tax. He also became Chairman of the Parliamentary Committee on Drug Misuse. Rathbone was a relation of, and godfather to, the future Conservative leader David Cameron. He employed Cameron as a researcher from January to March 1985. After losing his seat to the Liberal Democrats in the 1997 general election he became chairman of Sponsorship Consultancy Ltd. and in August 1998, was expelled from the Conservative Party by William Hague for his support of the breakaway Pro-Euro Conservative Party. He died from cancer in 2002, aged 69. He is buried in the churchyard of St Peter's Church, Lowick, Northamptonshire.

Trichothecenes are a class of sesquiterpenes. The most important structural features causing the biological activities of trichothecenes are the 12,13-epoxy ring, the presence of hydroxyl or acetyl groups at appropriate positions on the trichothecene nucleus, and the structure and position of the side-chain. They are produced on many different grains like wheat, oats or maize by various Fusarium species such as F. graminearum, F. sporotrichioides, F. poae and F. equiseti. Some molds that produce trichothecene mycotoxins, such as Stachybotrys chartarum, can grow in damp indoor environments. It has been found that macrocyclic trichothecenes produced by S. chartarum can become airborne and thus contribute to health problems among building occupants.Detection of Airborne Stachybotrys chartarum Macrocyclic Trichothecene Mycotoxins in the Indoor Environment A poisonous mushroom in Japan and China, Podostroma cornu-damae, contains six trichothecenes, including satratoxin H, roridin E, and verrucarin.  Classification  = General classification = The core structure of all major trichothecenes with major examples from each classification type. Identifying functional groups for the classification type are highlighted in red. Trichothecenes are a group of over 150 chemically related mycotoxins. Each trichothecene displays a core structure consisting of a single six- membered ring containing a single oxygen atom, flanked by two carbon rings. This core ring structure contains an epoxide, or tricyclic ether, at the 12,13 carbon positions, as well as a double bond at the 9, 10 carbon positions. These two functional groups are primarily responsible for trichothecene ability to inhibit protein synthesis and incur general cytotoxic effects. Notably, this core structure is amphipathic, containing both polar and non polar parts. All trichothecenes are related through this common structure, but each trichothecene also has a unique substitution pattern of oxygen containing functional groups at possible sites on carbons 3,4,7,8, and 15. These functional groups govern the properties of an individual tricothecene and also serve as the basis for the most commonly used classification system for this family of toxins. This classification system breaks up the trichothecene family into four groups: Type A, B, C, and D. Type A tricothecenes have hydroxyl, ester, or no functional group substitutions around the core ring structure. Common examples of these are Neosolaniol with a hydroxyl substitution at carbon 8, and T-2 toxin with an ester substitution at carbon 8. Type B tricothecenes are classified by the presence of carbonyl functional groups substituted around the core ring structure. Common examples of these include nivalenol and trichotecin, which both have a ketone functional group at carbon 8. Type C trichothecenes have an extra carbon 7, carbon 8 epoxide group. The common example of these is crotocin. which also has an ester functional group at carbon 4. Type D trichothecenes have an additional ring between carbon 4 and carbon 15. These rings can have diverse additional functional groups. Common examples of these are roridin A and satratoxin H. Although the distinct functional groups of these classification types give each trichothecene unique chemical properties, their classification type does not explicitly indicate their relative toxicity. While Type D trichothecenes are thought to be the most toxic, Types A and B have relatively mixed toxicity. = Alternative classifications = The classification system described above is the most commonly used to group molecules of the trichothecene family. However, a variety of alternative classification systems also exist for these complex molecules. Trichothecenes can also be generally described as simple or macrocyclic. Simple trichothecenes include Types A, B, and C, whereas macrocyclic tricothecenes include Type D and are characterized by the presence of a carbon 4 - carbon 15 bridge. Additionally, J. F. Grove proposed a classification of tricothecenes into three groups that was also based upon the functional substitution patterns of the ring skeleton. Group 1 tricothecenes only have functional groups substituted on the third, fully saturated carbon ring. Group 2 tricothecenes contain additional functional groups on the core ring containing the 9, 10 carbon double bond. Finally, Group 3 trichothecenes contain a ketone functional group at carbon 8; this is the same criteria for Type B trichothecenes. Advances in the field of evolutionary genetics have also led to the proposal of trichothecene classification systems based on the pathway of their biosynthesis. Genes responsible for the biosynthesis of a mycotoxin are typically located in clusters; in Fusariumi these are known as TRI genes. TRI genes are each responsible for producing an enzyme that carries out a specific step in the biosynthesis of trichothecenes. Mutations in these genes can lead to the production of variant trichothecenes and therefore these moleules could be grouped on the basis of shared biosynthesis steps. For example, a shared step in the biosynthesis of trichothecenes is controlled by the gene TRI4. This enzyme product controls the addition of either three or four oxygens to trichodiene to form either isotrichodiol or isotrichotriol respectively. A variety of trichothecenes can then be synthesized from either of these intermediates and they could therefore be classified as either t-type if synthesized from isotrichotriol or d-type if synthesized from isotrichodiol.  Mechanism of action  Trichothecenes accelerates reactive oxygen species production in cells which in turn mediates the induction of the programmed cell death pathway in cells. The toxicity of tricothecenes is primarily the result of their widely cited action as protein synthesis inhibitors. This inhibition occurs at ribosomes during all three stages of protein synthesis: initiation, elongation, and termination. During intitiation, trichothecenes can either inhibit the association of the two ribosomal subunits, or inhibit the function of the mature ribosome by preventing the association of the first tRNA with the start codon. Inhibition at elongation most likely occurs due to trichothecenes preventing the function peptidyl transferase, the enzyme which catalyzes the formation of new peptide bonds on the 60s ribosomal subunit. Inhibition during termination can also be the result of peptidyl transferase inhibition or the ability of trichothecenes to prevent the hydrolysis required at this final step. It is interesting to note that the substitution pattern of the ring core of trichothecenes influences the toxin's action as either an inhibitor of initiation or as an inhibitor of elongation/termination. Trichothecenes also have the ability to affect general cellular enzyme function due to the tendency of active site thiol groups to attack the 12,13 carbon epoxide ring. These inhibitory effects are seen most dramatically in actively proliferating cells such as in the gastrointestinal tract or the bone marrow. Protein synthesis occurs in both the cytoplasm of the cell as well as in the luminal space of mitochondria, the cytoplasmic organelle responsible for producing the cell's energy. This is done through an enzymatic pathway that generates highly oxidized molecules called reactive oxygen species, for example hydrogen peroxide. Reactive oxygen species can react with and cause damage to many critical parts of the cell including membranes, proteins, and DNA. Trichothecene inhibition of protein synthesis in the mitochondria allows reactive oxygen species to build up in the cell which inevitably leads to oxidative stress and induction of the programmed cell death pathway, apoptosis. The induction of apoptosis in cells with high levels of reactive oxygen species is due to a variety of cell signaling pathways. The first is the p53 pathway which is shown to be upregulated by the T-2 toxin. p53 is a protein responsible for controlling the cell cycle, but an increase in the activity of this protein also leads to increased activation of BAX proteins in the cell. These BAX proteins are primarily responsible for increasing the permeability of the mitochondrial membrane and leading to the release of cytochrome c and reactive oxygen species. Release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria induces apoptosis by initiating the assembly of caspases, or proteins responsible for degrading the cell from within. Additionally, trichothecenes such as T-2, have also been shown to increase the c-Jun N-Terminal Kinase signaling pathway in cells. Here, c-Jun N-Terminal Kinase is able to increase to phosphorylation of its target, c-Jun, into its active form. Activated c-jun acts as a transcription factor in the cell nucleus for proteins important for facilitating the downstream apoptotic pathway.  Symptomology  The trichothecene mycotoxins are toxic to humans, other mammals, birds, fish, a variety of invertebrates, plants, and eukaryotic cells. The specific toxicity varies depending on the particular toxin and animal species, however the route of administration plays a significantly higher role in determining lethality. The effects of poisoning will depend on the concentration of exposure, length of time and way the person is exposed. A highly concentrated solution or large amount of the gas is more likely to cause severe effects, including death. Upon consumption, the toxin inhibits ribosomal protein, DNA and RNA synthesis, mitochondrial functions cell division while simultaneously activating a cellular stress response named ribotoxic stress response The trichothecene mycotoxins can be absorbed though topical, oral and inhalational routes and are highly toxic at the sub- cellular, cellular, and organic system level. Trichothecenes differ from most other potential weapon toxins since they can act through the skin, which is attributed to their amphipathic and lipophilic characteristics. The small amphipathic nature of trichothecenes allows them to easily cross cell membranes and interact with different organelles such as the mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum (ER). and chloroplast The lipophilic nature of trichothecenes allow them to be easily absorbed through skin pulmonary mucosa, and gut. Direct dermal application or oral ingestion of trichothecene causes rapid irritation to the skin or intestinal mucosa. As a dermal irritant and blistering agent, it is alleged to be 400 times more intoxicating than sulfur mustard. alimentary toxic aleukia stages The response in the body to the mycotoxin, alimentary toxic aleukia, occurs several days after consumption, in four stages. The first stage includes inflammation of the gastric and intestinal mucosa. The second stage is characterized by leukopenia, granulopenia, and progressive lymphocytosis. The third stage is characterized by the appearance of a red rash on the skin of the body, as well as hemorrhage of the skin and mucosa. If severe, aphonia and death by strangulation can occur. By the fourth stage, cells in the lymphoid organs and erythropoiesis in the bone marrow and spleen are depleted and immune response is down. Infection can be triggered by an injury as minor as a cut, scratch or abrasion. The following symptoms are exhibited: * Severe itching and redness of the skin, sores, shedding of the skin * Distortion of any of the senses, loss of the ability to coordinate muscle movement * Nausea, vomiting and diarrhea * Nose and throat pain, discharge from the nose, itching and sneezing * Cough, difficulty breathing, wheezing, chest pain and spitting up blood * Temporary bleeding disorders * Elevated body temperature Regulatory issues When it comes to animal and human food, type A trichothecenes (e.g. T-2 toxin, HT-2 toxin, diacetoxyscirpenol) are of special interest because they are more toxic than the other foodborne trichothecenes i.e. type B group (e.g. deoxynivalenol, nivalenol, 3- and 15-acetyldeoxynivalenol). However, deoxynivalenol is of concern as it is the most prevalent trichothecene in Europe. The major effects of trichothecenes ‚Äì related to their concentration in the commodity ‚Äì are reduced feed uptake, vomiting and immuno-suppression. A relatively few countries, primarily in the European Union, have recommended maximum limits for these mycotoxins in food and animal feed. However, trichothecenes are often tested for elsewhere, in order to prevent them from entering the food chain and to prevent losses in animal production. History Trichothecenes are believed to have been discovered in 1932 in Orenburg, Russia, during World War II, by the Soviet Union. Around 100,000 people (60% mortality rate) began to suffer and die from alimentary toxic aleukia, a lethal disease with symptoms resembling radiation. It is believed that the Soviet civilians had become ill from ingesting contaminated bread, and inhaling mold through contaminated hay, dusts and ventilation systems. The culprit is believed to be the toxins Fusarium sporotrichioides and Fusarium poae which are high producers of T-2 toxin. Fusarium species are probably the most commonly cited and among the most abundant of the trichothecene-producing fungi. Trichothecenes make an ideal biologic warfare agent, being lethal and inexpensive to produce in large quantities, stable as an aerosol for dispersion, and without effective vaccination/treatment. Evidence suggests that mycotoxins have already been utilized as biological warfare. * 1964 there are unconfirmed reports that Egyptian or Russian forces used T-2 with mustard gas * 1974-1981 ‚Äúyellow rain‚Äù incidents in southeast Asia (Laos, Cambodia) and Afghanistan * 1975 and 1981 during the Vietnam War, the Soviet Union was alleged to have provided mycotoxins to the armies of Vietnam and Laos for use against resistance forces in Laos and Cambodia * 1985-1989 Iran-Iraq War, reports of mycotoxin shipments to Iraq (in form of powder and smoke) Since then trichothecenes have been reported throughout the world. They‚Äôve had a significant economic impact on the world due to causes such as: loss of human and animal life, increased health care and veterinary care costs, reduced livestock production, disposal of contaminated foods and feeds, and investment in research and applications to reduce severity of the mycotoxin problem. These mycotoxins account for millions of dollars annually in losses, due to factors that are often beyond human control (environmental, ecological, or storage method).  Food contamination  Hazardous concentrations of trichothecenes have been detected in corn, wheat, barley, oats, rice, rye, vegetables, and other crops. Diseases resulting from infection include seed rot, seedling blight, root rot, stalk rot, and ear rot. Trichothecenes are also common contaminants of poultry feeds and their adverse effects on poultry health and productivity have been studied extensively. Several studies have shown that optimal conditions for fungal growth are not necessarily optimum for toxin production. Toxin production is greatest with high humidity and temperatures of 6-24¬∞C. The fungal propagation and production is enhanced in tropical conditions with high temperatures and moisture levels; monsoons, flash floods and unseasoned rains during harvest. Trichothecenes have been detected in air samples suggesting that they can be aerosolized on spores or small particles Natural occurrence of TCT has been reported in Asia, Africa, South America, Europe, and North America * Akakabibyo, a disease of similar etiology, has also been associated with trichothecene contaminated grains in Japan. * In China, cereals or their products contaminated with trichothecenes including DON, T-2 toxin, and NIV, have also been associated with outbreaks of gastrointestinal disorders. * In Yugoslavia, studies on mycotoxigenic fungi in raw milk have indicated that 91% of the samples tested were contaminated * In the USA, a study was conducted in seven Midwestern states in 1988‚Äì1989 and found mycotoxins in 19.5%-24.7% of corn samples. Since the early 1900s, incidences of emesis in animals and humans after consumption of cereals infected with Fusarium species have been described. * In a study in the Bihar region from 1985 to 1987, 51% of the samples tested were contaminated with molds. * In another study In the Bihar region , high levels were reported in groundnut meal used for dairy cattle. * In Ludhiana and Punjab researchers found 75% of samples from dairy farms contaminated. * In India, estimated 10 million dollars were lost due to groundnut contamination with mycotoxins.  Safety  There are no known direct antidotes to trichothecene exposure. Therefore, risk management in contaminated areas is primarily defined by the treatment of exposure symptoms as well as prevention of future exposure. = Treatment = Typical routes of exposure to trichothecene toxins include topical absorption, ingestion, and inhalation. Severity of symptoms depends on the dose and type of exposure, but treatment is primarily focused on supporting bodily systems damaged by the mycotoxin. The first step in most exposure cases is to remove potentially contaminated clothing and to flush the sites of exposure thoroughly with water. This prevents the victim from repeated exposure. Fluids and electrolytes can be given to victims with high levels of gastrointestinal damage to mitigate the effects of reduced tract absorption. Fresh air and assisted respiration can also be administered upon the development of mild respiratory distress. Increasingly severe symptoms can require the application of advanced medical assistance. The onset of leukopenia, or reduction of white blood cell count, can be treated with a plasma or platelet transfusion. Hypotension can be treated with the administration of norepinephrine or dopamine. Development of severe cardiopulmonary distress may require intubation and additional drug treatments to stabilize heart and lung activity. Additionally, there are a variety of chemicals that can indirectly reduce the damaging effects of trichothecenes on cells and tissues. Activated charcoal solutions are frequently administered to ingestion cases as an adsorbent. Here, the charcoal acts as a porous substance for the toxin to bind, preventing its absorption through the gastrointestinal track and increasing its removal from the body through bowel excretion. Similar detoxifying adsorbents can also be added to animal feed upon contamination to reduce the bioavailability of the toxin upon consumption. Antioxidants are also useful in mitigating the damaging effects of trichothecenes in response to the increase of reactive oxygen species they produce in cells. Generally, a good diet rich in probiotics, vitamins and nutrients, proteins, and lipidis is thought to be effective in reducing the symptoms of trichothecene poisoning. For example, vitamin E was found to counteract the formation of lipid peroxides induced by T-2 toxin in chickens. Similarly, cosupplementation of modified glucomannas and selenium in the diets of chickens also consuming T-2 toxin, reduced the deleterious effects of toxin associated depletion of antioxidants in the liver. Despite not being a direct antidote, these antioxidants may be critical in reducing the severity of trichothecene exposures. = Prevention = Biological approach to trichothecene decontamination. De-epoxidases are capable of reducing epoxide rings (red) to double bond groups (green) which significantly reduces the toxicity of trichothecenes. Trichothecenes are mycotoxins produced by molds that frequently contaminate stores of grain products. This makes trichothecene contamination a significant public health problem, and many areas have strict limits on permitted trichothecene content. For example, in the European Union, only .025 ppm of T-2 toxin is permissible in bakery products intended for human consumption. The molds that can produce trichothecenes grow well in dark, temperate places with high moisture content. Therefore, one of the best ways to prevent trichothecene contamination in food products is to store the resources in the proper conditions to prevent the growth of molds. For example, it is generally advised to only store grains in areas with a moisture content of less than 15%. However, if an area has already been contaminated with trichothecene toxins, there are a variety of possible decontamination strategies to prevent further exposure. Treatment with 1% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) in 0.1M sodium hydroxide (NaOH) for 4-5 hours has been shown to inhibit the biological activity of T-2 toxin. Incubation with aqueous ozone at approximately 25 ppm has also been shown to degrade a variety of trichothecenes through a mechanism involving oxidation of the 9, 10 carbon double bond. UV exposure has also been shown to be effective under the right conditions. Outside of the strategies for physcial and chemical decontamination, advancing research in molecular genetics has also given rise to the potential of a biological decontamination approach. Many microbes, including bacteria, yeast, and fungi, have evolved enzymatic gene products which facilitate the specific and efficient degradation of trichothecene mycotoxins. Many of these enzymes specifically degrade the 12,13 carbon epoxide ring which is important for the toxicity of trichothecenes. For example, the Eubacteria strain BBSH 797 produces de-epoxidase enzymes which reduce the 12,13 carbon epoxide ring to a double bond group. These, along with other microbes expressing trichothecene detoxifying properties, can be used in feed stores to prevent to toxic effect of contaminated feed upon consumption. Furthermore, molecular cloning of the genes responsible for producing these detoxifying enzymes could be useful in producing strains of agricultural products that are resistant to trichothecene poisoning. Epoxitrichothecenes Epoxitrichothecenes are a variation of the above, and were once explored for military use in East Germany, and possibly the whole Soviet bloc.Die Chemie der Kampfstoffe, GDR Government publishing, 1988 There is no feasible treatment once symptoms of epoxithichothecene poisoning set in, though the effects can subside without leaving any permanent damage. The plans for use as a large-scale bioweapon were dropped, as the relevant epoxitrichothecenes degrade very quickly under UV light and heat, as well as chlorine exposure, making them useless for open attacks and the poisoning of water supplies.

It makes various ranges of diesel engines for the marine sector. There are three \\"Bergen\\" and two Crossley Pielstick ranges with power outputs in the range 1.2MW to 15MW. Formerly part of Rolls- Royce Marine Power Operations, it was merged into Tognum in July 2013, after Tognum had become a 50/50 joint venture between Rolls-Royce and Daimler AG. History The company started as a shipbuilding business called Bergen Mekaniske Verksted (BMV) in 1855 in Bergen, Norway. BMV built both ships and steam engines to propel them. In 1942, BMV established their diesel engine division, but due to World War II a design was not completed before 1946. Engines were delivered in 1946 and -47 to the vessels MS Draupne and MS Arcturus. In 1984 the diesel engine division was spun off into its own company, BMV Maskin AS. It was acquired by Ulstein the following year and renamed Bergen Diesel AS.Rolls-Royce UK - Jane's Marine Propulsion In 1999 Ulstein Group was bought out by Vickers plc - Vickers was subsequently acquired by Rolls-Royce the same year. Rolls-Royce proceeded to rename every Ulstein subdivision to Rolls-Royce Marine, with Bergen Diesel being named Rolls-Royce Marine Engines - Bergen.Historie om bedriften In March 2011 Rolls- Royce and Daimler launched a takeover for Tognum. The two companies announced on 24 June 2011 that their joint ‚Ç¨3.4 billion tender offer had been successful, with 94% of Tognum shareholders accepting. In March 2014 Rolls Royce announced a buyout of the Daimler share of Tognum, which would then be known as Rolls Royce Power Systems. Engine range The Bergen marine diesel ranges are denoted by the letters C, B and K and are broadly divided by the power output as follows: * Bergen K, * Bergen C and; * Bergen B32:40 for powers from 1200 ‚Äì 8,000 kW, * Bergen KG 4.2 and; * Bergen B35:40 for powers of 1190 kW ‚Äì 8750 kW. These engines can all burn Marine Diesel Oil (MDO) and heavy fuel oil (HFO). They achieve specific fuel consumptions of between 183 and 196g/kWh. Specific lubricant oil consumptions are of the order of 0.8g/kWh. Two of the Bergen marine engine variants may be fuelled by natural gas. Bergen K series The Bergen K marine diesel and gas engines are a range of marine internal combustion engines manufactured by Rolls-Royce plc. =Mechanical configuration= The Bergen K lean burn marine engines with 250mm bore and 300mm stroke is available as a diesel in 6, 8 and 9 cylinder in-line configurations for propulsion and auxiliary duties. Features: * Rigid crankcase minimises deformations and ensures good main bearing alignment * BMEP 20-22 bar (gas engine 18bar) =Power Outputs= The diesel power range is from 1215-2005 kW. Also available as a gas engine for powers from 1190 ‚Äì 3970 kW the Bergen K-G4 lean burn gas engine is the result of careful development based on the Bergen K. =Fuels and Consumption= * Lub oil consumption approx 0.8g/kWh * Specific fuel consumption 193-196 g/kWh (8060kJ/kWh gas) due to turbocharger design and modern fuel injection technology The lean burn principle of the K-G4 gas engines operation combines high power and high efficiency coupled with reduced exhaust emissions, and delivers a specific fuel consumption of 7990-8060kJ/kWh. Engines in service burn natural gas and also other fuels such as gas derived from landfill and from fermentation of effluents. =Development= Bergen lean burn spark ignition technology was first developed more than fifteen years ago and has proved very popular for power generation on land. =Dry Masses= Bergen K engines have dry masses between 22500 and 30500 kg =Longevity= These marine diesel and gas engines have design lives of more than 20 years and engines are installed in more than 150 power plants throughout the world. Bergen K-G4 Also available as a gas engine for powers from 1190 ‚Äì 3970 kW the Bergen K-G4 lean burn gas engine is the result of development based on the K type diesel and heavy fuel oil engine parent. Bergen B35:40 The Bergen B Series is a twenty-year-old (est. 1986) marque of reciprocating diesel engines. They serve a wide range of ocean-going vessels and; can be supplied as propulsion units or as generator sets for the provision of electrical power. The range includes in-line and Vee cylinder configurations. The Bergen B Series Marine Diesels have power outputs in the range 2,545 - 5,300 kilowatts These engines have a reputation for being \\"a Rolls Royce product\\" in terms of quality which is ironic because when they were designed, the company was not part of the Rolls Royce organization. The Bergen B35:40 gas engine has high power and efficiency in the 720-750 rpm class and, is designed for low emissions of NOx, CO, and UHC combined. It builds on the latest B diesel hardware, specifically redesigned and modified for this gas variant. Crossley Pielstick range.

Powers and abilities A gifted research scientist with expertise in laser technology and a Ph.D in physics, Arthur Parks began his criminal career using wrist-mounted laser projection units, and later implants miniature laser diodes into his skin which absorb energy. With the diode implants, Parks is capable of energy projection, light refraction for invisibility and illusion generation. Parks's material body is eventually replaced by photons due to an overloading of the diode implants. By increasing the density of the photons comprising his form, Parks can achieve \\"solidity\\", project photons as energy beams, and create three-dimensional holographic images. The character also possesses limited telepathic abilities and can travel at light speed. Other versions =What If?= The alternate universe title What If features a story which the character reforms and works at Stark Industries, with three different outcomes being presented.What If? #63 (July 1994). Marvel Comics. =Heroes Reborn= In the Heroes Reborn universe, created by Franklin Richards, Arthur Parks was a successful businessman of Parks Fiberoptics, until he lost his company to Tony Stark. Parks, now broken and desperate, having left his wife Amy, used his own technology to transform himself and attack Stark in his own home. Stark learned why Parks was attacking him, and tried to atone for what he had done and convince Parks to stop his attack. Parks refused to stop so Stark in his Iron Man suit was forced to destroy his containment armor causing his laser form to dissipate, killing him.Iron Man Vol. 2 #3. Marvel Comics.

He was suspended from the Liberal Democrats in 2011, and subsequently expelled, in connection to allegations of an electoral offence. He later pled guilty to perjury. Early career Bradley became a councillor in Liverpool in May 2000. Whilst a councillor, he continued to work as a firefighter. In 2001, he was the only member of the Merseyside Police Authority to vote against a pay rise for the Authority's members; when the rise was passed, he donated the extra money he received as a result to the Mersey Regional Kidney Patient Support Group.  Council leadership  Bradley was elected as leader of Liverpool City Council on 5 December 2005. He took over from Mike Storey, who resigned after an investigation from the Standards Board for England found he had broken the councillors' code of conduct. Bradley maintained his job as a firefighter whilst working as council leader. Following the 2010 United Kingdom local elections, he was replaced as council leader by Joe Anderson, after the Liberal Democrats were defeated by Labour in the election. Two Liverpool councillors called for his resignation as leader of the Liverpool Liberal Democrats, claiming he had \\"worked hard\\" but not \\"hard enough\\". A leadership challenge was mounted; however, Bradley won, and retained his position. Later in 2010, Warren criticised Nick Clegg, the former Deputy Prime Minister and leader of the Liberal Democrats, for failing to oppose the cancellation of the Building Schools for the Future programme. Resignation and perjury Bradley resigned as leader of the Liverpool Liberal Democrats, and was suspended by the party, in 2011 after reports of irregularities when nominating his son as a candidate for election. He initially denied the claims, but later pled guilty to a charge of perjury, and was fined ¬£1000. Bradley subsequently stood as an independent candidate for Wavertree ward in the 2012 Liverpool City Council election. This decision caused consternation within the Liberal Democrats, and he was subsequently permanently excluded from the party. He earned 28.8% of the vote, putting him in second place, just under 20% behind the Labour candidate, and just under 20% ahead of the Liberal Democrat candidate.

It is the oldest surviving general or \\"universal\\" martyrology, and the precursor of all later Western martyrologies. Pseudepigraphically attributed to Saint Jerome, the Martyrologium Hieronymianum contains a reference to him derived from the opening chapter of his Life of Malchus (392 AD) where Jerome states his intention to write a history of the saints and martyrs from the apostolic times: \\"I decided to write [a history, mentioned earlier] from the coming of the savior up to our age, that is, from the apostles, up to the dregs of our time\\".Vita Malchi, chapter 1: \\"Scribere enim disposui [...] ab adventu salvatoris usque ad nostram aetatem, id est, ab apostolis, usque ad nostri temporis faecem...\\" Date and textual history The Martyrologium Hieronymianum appears to have drawn for its material on the existing calendar of Rome, on one from Africa, and on a compilation made in Greek around the year 362 A.D. and which used as a major source the details found regarding the martyrs in works of Eusebius of Caesarea. The contents of the 362 AD compilation are known to us from an untidy Syriac translation, the Martyrology of AD 411. London, British Library, Ms. additional 12150, published by F. Nau, in Patrologia Orientalis, t. 10, 1955, pp. 7-26 (Syriac with French translation). It is the geographical spread of the sources which gave this pioneering martyrology its general or \\"universal\\" character. Nevertheless, on account precisely of this non-local character and because the date of final compilation considerable postdates the end of the main anti-Christian persecutions, the antiquity of much of the information gathered is undermined by the inevitable errors caused by multiple compilers and by scribes to whom the persons mentioned could not have been personally unknown.Jacques Dubois, O.S.B., Les martyrologes du Moyen √Çge latin 1978: 29-30. It appears that the initial Latin text was fabricated in Northern Italy, probably within the Patriarchate of Aquileia, in the 430s or 440s.Hippolyte Delehaye, Commentarius perpetuus in martyrologium hieronymianum, 1931, p. 55. but then later reworked in Gaul, probably at Auxerre, about the year 600. It is from this line of transmission that the surviving manuscripts descend. The three earliest manuscripts which do survive of the Latin Martyrologium Hieronymianum as such are all relatively late, from the 8th century, which means they have inevitably suffered interference in the course of transmission. The oldest of them Paris, Biblioth√®que nationale de France, ms. lat. 10837, folios 2 - 33. comes from the monastery of the Northumbrian missionary St Willibrord at Echternach and was written in England in the first years of the 8th century. Two other important manuscripts were written in the same century, one for the monastery of Saint Avoldus near Metz, Bern, Swiss National Library, ms. 289. and the other was copied by 772 AD for the monastery of Saint-Wandrille and then came to the monastery of St Peter in Wissembourg. Wolfenb√ºttel, Herzog August Library, ms. Weissenburg 23. In 1894 the text of the three manuscripts were juxtaposed in a publication contributed by Giovanni Battista de Rossi and Louis Duchesne to the monumental Acta Sanctorum, Volume November, II, pp. [1-156]. which prepared the way for a critical edition published by Henri Quentin in 1931 along with a historical commentary by the Bollandist Hippolyte Delehaye, again in connection with the Acta Sanctorum, Henri Quentin and Hippolyte Delehaye, Commentarius Perpetuus in Martyrologium Hieronymianum, Brussels, 1931. Scholars generally assume that in the lists of martyrs that head each day's entry, newer additions were added at the bottom of the lists, and thus the first names are most likely to be those from the lost earliest versions of the Martyrologium Hieronymianum. Contents The material preserved in the Martyrologium Hieronymianum is such that highly specialist training is needed to evaluate it. Derived as the material often is from calendars, it is no surprise that the greater part of the entries contain only summary lists of names and places, for example: \\"On the third day before the Ides of January, at Rome, in the [catacomb] cemetery of Callixtus, on the Appian Way, was buried Miltiades, the bishop\\". The first \\"historical\\" martyrologies, (containing narrative history of the life of a saint), would not flower until the Carolingian period, starting with the martyrology of Bede.

Boyd was Director of Malware Research for security company FaceTime, before becoming a Senior Threat Researcher at Sunbelt Software (later known as GFI Software). In December 2013 Malwarebytes announced Boyd had joined their Malware Intelligence team to research new threats. Computer security In July 2004, Boyd launched Vitalsecurity.org, a website bringing to the public attention issues of privacy and spyware. In November 2004, a modular hacking technique was employed to compromise Windows end-users by hacking Apache servers. When hacked, the servers would redirect a user on any of the server's websites, leading them to a set of ever-changing infection pages. These pages employed recoded viruses, trojans, malware and spyware. This technique is used heavily today by the groups behind the spyware CoolWebSearch (CWS). The idea that alternative browsers such as Opera and Firefox could somehow enhance end-user security was cut down in March 2005 with the discovery of a Java applet that, if agreed to, would install a large (and varied) adware bundle onto the end-user's PC. It was found that having the \\"rogue\\" site in the user's blocklists and security tools would do nothing, the install bypassing these tactics completely if the end-user clicked \\"Yes\\". An updated Firefox .XPI installer (which infected Internet Explorer) was also deployed in some of these installs. BitTorrent controversy In June 2005, it was discovered that more and more Adware makers were turning to alternative sources for their installs, as more end-users become aware of the more common install tactics. A reliance on crude social engineering and P2P systems that were previously clean was now on the rise. Boyd discovered that BitTorrent forums and file-sharing sites were used as a major source of distribution for Aurora (a program produced by Direct Revenue) and a number of other major adware programs, wrapped up in bundles produced by Metrix Marketing Group (MMG), a company who lost control of their own network. Potentially copyright infringing files, illegal pornography and incorrect / absent disclosure was exposed on such a scale as to cause the companies involved (Direct Revenue, 180solutions and others) to publicly declare their discontinuation of these methods. This story caused such an uproar that numerous media pundits weighed in, and (in some cases) made a delicate situation worse. An article by John C. Dvorak of PC Magazine alleged Boyd was part of some \\"Grand Microsoft Conspiracy\\" to bad-mouth BitTorrent to the benefit of their planned P2P tool, Avalanche. Furious P2P users (who were not familiar with the backstory of the investigation) even went as far to say Boyd was in league with the RIAA, out to create further problems for file-sharers by bringing these bundles to light. However - Dvorak's piece caused something approaching outrage on the other side of the fence, leading a fellow Ziff Davis Media publication to go head to head with Dvorak. Dave Methvin of PC Pitstop followed up the investigation with his findings. He alleges that some of the films distributed contained potentially illegal underage pornography, and not long after, MMG went offline and the Adware companies all pulled out of this particular distribution. Fake Google toolbar In October 2005, Boyd discovered a \\"fake\\" Google Toolbar which was being distributed via Instant Messaging. The toolbar allowed the user to store credit card details, and also opened up a fake Google search page. Boyd also tracked the toolbar back to 2003, through three different versions, each one exploiting vulnerabilities in the Windows operating system. Instant messaging rootkit In October / November 2005, Boyd discovered what is considered to be the first known instance of a rootkit being distributed via instant messaging, hidden inside a large payload of adware and spyware. Over a period of months, the group behind the attacks distributed numerous inventive payloads (such as a forced install of BitTorrent to spread movie files) and were eventually traced back to the Middle-East. Adware critic Boyd is a notoriously fierce critic of adware companies, famously causing 180solutions to label him a \\"fanatic\\" on their Weblog, with bad feeling in evidence on both sides to this day. He is regularly referenced on other leading antispyware sites such as Sunbelt Blog, Suzi Turner's ZDNet blog and Ben Edelman's home page.

Established in 1951, the Egyptian Air Academy is one of seven military academies administered by the various branches of the Egyptian Armed Forces.ACADEMIES (accessed 25 January 2012) The current director of the Egyptian Air Academy is Air Vice-Marshal Abd-El Moneam Hassan Shouman. In addition to Egyptian Air Force personnel, the academy has also trained cadets from a large number of other Arab countries, as well as cadets from Malaysia and parts of Sub-Saharan Africa.Condition of Joining the Air Academy (accessed 25 January 2012) History Formal air force training in Egypt dates to 1938 when a forerunner to the Egyptian Air Academy was established on the grounds of the Royal Air Force-administered Almaza station near present-day Cairo International Airport. Resources provided to this school included instructors, technicians, training aircraft and curriculum. The first cadets were non-commissioned officers from the Egyptian Army and various police forces who were deemed medically fit for flying. This first school was divided into five \\"wings\\": Flying, Science, Technical, Cadets and Administration. By 1951 the Almaza site had become inadequate for air force training purposes. That year a law was passed by the Kingdom of Egypt authorizing the creation of the Egyptian Air Academy near Bilbeis. Despite the Egyptian Revolution of 1952, the expulsion of British forces and the subsequent rise of the Republic of Egypt, plans for the academy remained unchanged, with construction and renovation continuing through 1961. Future Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak served as a lecturer and later as director of the Egyptian Air Academy at various times during the 1950s and 1960s Admission and curriculum Prospective Egyptian Air Academy cadets must be Egyptian \\"by heredity from forefathers,\\" unmarried, no older than 21 have \\"good manners\\" and be \\"clean living.\\" Once at the academy cadets are divided into \\"pilot\\" and \\"navigator\\" groups. Curriculum includes theoretical and practical flying, administration and humanities, computer science and foreign languages.

The specimen, consisting of very fragmentary elements of the skull and the axial and appendicular skeleton, was described by Rodolfo Coria and Leonardo Salgado in late 1998. Discovery and naming Ilokelesia is only known from very fragmentary elements of the skull and the axial and appendicular skeleton, discovered in 1991. It was discovered ten meters away from where the holotype of Huinculsaurus was discovered. The genus was named and described in 1998.  Etymology  The generic name's etymology is derived from the Mapuche language, ilo meaning \\"flesh\\" and kelesio, \\"lizard\\"; while the specific descriptor reflects the name of the locality where the fossil was found, Aguada Grande.  Description  Ilokelesia was a medium-sized theropod. In 2010 Gregory S. Paul gave a length of 4 meters (13 ft) and a weight of 200 kg (440 lbs). In 2016 it was estimated to be in length in a comprehensive analysis of abelisaur size. The same year another estimation listed it higher at 5.8 meters (19 ft) and 840 kg (1,850 lbs). It is characterized by features of the skull, namely of the quadrate and postorbital bones. The vertebral series also has distinctive characters setting it apart from other abelisaurs, such as reduced processes on the cervical vertebrae and dorsal vertebrae lacking pleurocoels. I. aguadagrandensis was considered the most basal abelisaur described at the time, sharing characters, such as an expansion of the postorbital bone above the orbit and a flange of the same bone inside the orbit, with Abelisauridae and Noasauridae; but it was considered to retain primitive features for Abelisauria, such as an opening in the quadrate bone and a T-shaped postorbital. A subsequent analysis has placed it within Abelisauridae, as a brachyrostran carnotaurine.

The third tropical cyclone of the 1956 Atlantic hurricane season, Betsy developed from a tropical wave on August 9 to the east of the Lesser Antilles. It rapidly developed into a 120 mph (195 km/h) major hurricane before striking Guadeloupe. There, Betsy heavily damaged 1000 houses and left severe crop destruction, and there were 18 deaths in the territory. As Betsy continued into the northeastern Caribbean, it capsized a ship, killing its crew of two. On August 12, Betsy struck southeastern Puerto Rico and quickly crossed the island. Damage was heaviest where it moved ashore and in the territory's central portion, and throughout Puerto Rico there were 15,023 houses that were destroyed by Betsy. Multiple locations reported heavy crop damage, including Camuy which reported a complete loss of the corn crop. Hurricane Betsy was the first hurricane to be observed from the San Juan radar, and also resulted in the first hurricane warning on the island to be released on television. The hurricane left $40 million in damage and 16 deaths, which prompted a federally declared disaster area. Locally the hurricane was known as the Santa Clara Hurricane. After exiting Puerto Rico, Betsy brushed the Bahamas before turning northeastward, becoming extratropical on August 18\\\\. The remnants dissipated two days later to the south of Newfoundland. Meteorological history Before Betsy's formation, the northeastward shift of the Azores High allowed for an increase in atmospheric instability across the tropical Atlantic, which made conditions for tropical cyclogenesis more favorable in early August. A tropical wave exited the west coast of Africa on August 4. On August 9, a ship reported rough seas and winds of force 10 on the Beaufort scale. On that basis, it is estimated that Tropical Storm Betsy developed that day about 835 mi (1345 km) east of Barbados. The next day, a Hurricane Hunters flight observed winds of , which indicated that Betsy had intensified significantly overnight. The flight reported how small the hurricane was, including a wide eye. After maintaining that intensity for about 24 hours, Betsy began weakening, moving directly over Marie-Galante and southern Guadeloupe. It entered the eastern Caribbean with winds of 90 mph (150 km/h) before it began a track to the west-northwest. On August 12, Hurricane Betsy passed about south of Saint Croix before striking southeastern Puerto Rico. This made Betsy the first hurricane to strike the island since the 1932 San Ciprian hurricane. It crossed the central portion of the island, and the structure deteriorated and the eye became difficult to locate as Betsy crossed the highest mountains. On two occasions the eye dropped slightly to the south because of the mountains. The eye became well-defined as it approached the coast, and Betsy emerged on the northwest coast near Camuy at a similar intensity as when it moved ashore. The hurricane re-intensified as it moved toward the Bahamas, reaching winds of on August 13\\\\. That day, the eye passed near Grand Turk Island and San Salvador Island. By that time, the storm had increased in size; the Hurricane Hunters reported that the gale-force winds extended to its north. The eye reformed on August 14, becoming well-organized and attaining a minimum barometric pressure of . The next day, Betsy turned to the northeast due to an approaching trough. Despite beginning a weakening trend, the pressure dropped further to on August 17\\\\. The eye became increasingly poorly defined, and Betsy weakened to a tropical storm on August 18 to the south of Nova Scotia. Turning to the east, it became extratropical later that day, eventually dissipating on August 20\\\\. Impact Rainfall summary of Hurricane Betsy in Puerto Rico When the first advisory was issued on Betsy, a hurricane watch was issued from Barbados to Antigua. Around that time, a hurricane watch was also issued for Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands, which was later upgraded to a hurricane warning. This was the first hurricane warning in Puerto Rico to be aired on television. The hurricane struck Guadeloupe with winds from 100‚Äì120 mph (160‚Äì195 km/h), which caused extensive damage to 1,000 houses. The communications throughout the territory were disrupted. The high winds destroyed upwards of 60% of the banana, breadfruit, coconut, and papaya crop, which severely impacted the economy. Across the French West Indies, the hurricane resulted in 18 deaths and caused $10 million in damage, $3.5 million of which from crop damage. In nearby Dominica, winds reached . In Saint Croix, the hurricane dropped , while winds reached . In the northeastern Caribbean, Betsy capsized a ship and killed its crew of two. Another ship in the region drifted for several days south of Saint Croix due to a damaged engine. When Betsy crossed Puerto Rico, it produced hurricane- force winds across the entire territory except in the southwest corner. Sustained winds reached in San Juan, and Ramey Air Force Base on the island's northwestern portion recorded wind gusts. The high winds downed a significant number of trees in the island's interior due to the funneling within valleys. In Aibonito, the winds destroyed 1000 houses and damaged another 500, and in nearby Comer√≠o the winds severely damaged or destroyed 1285 dwellings. In Jayuya in the central portion of the island, the hurricane left severe crop damage, including a complete loss to the banana crop. However, damage was heaviest in Yabucoa near where Betsy moved ashore, due to a slight oscillation of the eye. High winds caused severe damage in a 20 mi (32 km) radius. In Yabucoa, over 12,000 people were left homeless, and damage totaled $8 million. Damage was likewise severe where Betsy moved offshore in Camuy, with a complete loss to the corn crop, 95% of the avocado, 65% of breadfruit, and 50% of the coffee crop ruined. The hurricane dropped heavy rainfall in the central portion of the island, with a peak 24‚Äëhour total of in R√≠o Grande. The same station recorded a total of , which was the highest total related to Betsy's passage. Across Puerto Rico, Betsy destroyed 15,023 houses and left $40 million in damage. There were sixteen deaths on the island, which was less than expected due to well-heeded warnings. There were also 24 injuries in the territory related to the storm. Betsy was the first hurricane on record to be observed from the San Juan radar. On the island, it is known as the Santa Clara hurricane. Due to the damage, U.S. President Dwight Eisenhower declared Puerto Rico as a disaster area on August 18, which allocated millions of dollars in assistance. The Puerto Rican governor allocated $6.7 million of funding to aid in rebuilding. In San Salvador in the Bahamas, the hurricane produced wind gusts of , and sustained winds reached 100 mph (160 km/h). The strm dropped about of rainfall. Betsy destroyed several houses and wrecked the roofs of several churches. Hurricane Betsy left about $380,000 in damage in the Bahamas. While delivering relief supplies to San Salvador Air Force Base, a Douglas C-124A-DL Globemaster II operated by the U.S. Air Force crashed. The plane had a right landing gear fail and as the result the plane skidded down the runway and came to a stop. One person was killed. Due to uncertainty in the storm's movement, officials issued a hurricane warning for southern Florida. Although Betsy remained far away from the state, its eye was observed on radar in Miami at a potentially record distance of . In the Grand Banks offshore Canada, the hurricane sunk a ship, although the entire crew was rescued.

Known for their reliability, simplicity, ruggedness and their 80% (over 3,500) commonality of parts across the entire product line, these vehicles were originally targeted at African and Asian countries who could not afford more expensive vehicles. The ACMAT company built their vehicles based on standardisation, commonality of parts and components, and on interchangeability; parts are interchangeable with vehicles built 30 years ago. Parts commonality includes cabs, structural components, engines and drive trains. ACMAT uses many of the same parts for all of its line of vehicles. They even produce an armoured variant of both the 4x4 and 6x6 versions of the VLRA. ACMAT is a subsidiary of Arquus Defense, previously Renault Truck Defense,https://www.janes.com/article/80350/renault-trucks-defense-renamed- arquus which since 22 May 2006 has been a wholly owned subsidiary of Renault Trucks. Many French fire brigades also use ACMAT vehicles due to their lower cost and 4WD ability. Several thousand are in use by 42 countries including France and the Irish Defence Forces. ACMAT also designs, manufactures and builds trailers, shelters and generators. ACMAT has exported over 85 percent of the 12,000 plus vehicles it produced into 50 countries. History ACMAT was founded as The ALM SA (Ateliers Legueu Meaux) in 1954 by Ren√© Legueu as a Meaux-based manufacturer of wheeled military vehicles. Some of their heavy trucks and commercial vehicles are also available in civilian versions. For commercial use, there are also vehicles for protection of persons and the use of public-sector units of authorities such as the police and the fire brigade. Since the start of production, the company has produced over 12,000 vehicles that are marketed in over 50 countries.[3] In 1964, the company moved its headquarters to Saint-Nazaire . The company started as a developer and producer of vehicle parts, including transfer case and front axles for large- scale built trucks. The company holds patents for many of its in-house parts and technologies. This also gave rise to all-terrain trucks designed for agricultural uses. However, it remained only a concept and never made it to market but was then developed for the oil industry. So a four-wheel and all- terrain version was included in the geophysical industry for use in the oil developments in the Sahara. With a range of just over 1,000 km on a single tank and operational capabilities in desert terrain, the vehicle offered an increased viability in a hostile region, which appealed to the military. From August 1961, production of the (now) ALM VCOM (Vehicle of de Combat d'Outre- Mer) began, with improvements to the vehicle under the direction of the Foreign Legion under testing in the Fennec Mission (Desert Fox). These tests were conducted during various missions in Mauritania and during the Chadian liberation war. A total of 193 units had been made by the completion of testing by the 13 Demi-brigade of the Foreign Legion in Djibouti. To be close to his father, Paul Legueu, the company moved headquarters to Saint-Nazaire in 1964 and created a foundation, ACMAT SA (Ateliers de Constructions M√©caniques de l'Atlantique). The company began the development of components. These were the front and rear axles, transmission and transfer case . This led to the company being awarded a further 12 patents. During 1967, the company launched its latest model, the ACMAT VLRA (V√©hicule de Liaison de Reconnaissance et d'Appui > \\"Liaison, Reconnaissance, and Support Vehicle\\"). This was characterised by its robustness above all. It could transport 2.5 tonnes of payload, a maximum range of 1,600 km and a water tank with a capacity of 200lt. In May 2006, ACMAT was acquired by Renault Trucks Defense SA, the majority shareholder of the company. ACMAT has been a subsidiary brand of the Volvo Group to which Renault Trucks belongs. [4] Under the guidance of the new board Moun Bourjij created in collaboration with Renault Trucks the ACMAT VLRA 2 (V√©hicule de la Liaison de Reconnaissance et d'appui Blind√© > \\"Armored Liaison, Reconnaissance, and Support Vehicle\\"), which launched in 2009. Based on the Toyota Hi-lux, it is the seventh generation ACMAT ALTV (A√©rotransportable V√©hicule Tactique L√©ger > \\"Airtransportable Light Tactical Vehicle\\").

Born into slavery in Beaufort, South Carolina, he freed himself, his crew, and their families during the American Civil War by commandeering a Confederate transport ship, CSS Planter, in Charleston harbor, on May 13, 1862, and sailing it from Confederate-controlled waters of the harbor to the U.S. blockade that surrounded it. He then piloted the ship to the Union-controlled enclave in Beaufort-Port Royal-Hilton Head area, where it became a Union warship. His example and persuasion helped convince President Abraham Lincoln to accept African-American soldiers into the Union Army. After the American Civil War he returned to Beaufort and became a politician, winning election as a Republican to the South Carolina State legislature and the United States House of Representatives during the Reconstruction era. Smalls authored state legislation providing for South Carolina to have the first free and compulsory public school system in the United States. He founded the Republican Party of South Carolina. Smalls was the last Republican to represent South Carolina's 5th congressional district until 2011. Early life Robert Smalls was born in 1839 to Lydia Polite, a woman enslaved by Henry McKee, who was most likely Smalls's father. She gave birth to him in a cabin behind McKee's house, at 511 Prince Street in Beaufort, South Carolina. He grew up in the city under the influence of the Lowcountry Gullah culture of his mother. His mother lived as a servant in the house but grew up in the fields. Robert was favored over other slaves, so his mother worried that he might grow up not understanding the plight of field slaves, and asked for him to be made to work in the fields and to witness whipping. When he was 12, at the request of his mother, Smalls' master sent him to Charleston to hire out as a laborer for one dollar a week, with the rest of the wage being paid to his master. The youth first worked in a hotel, then became a lamplighter on Charleston's streets. In his teen years, his love of the sea led him to find work on Charleston's docks and wharves. Smalls worked as a longshoreman, a rigger, a sail maker, and eventually worked his way up to become a wheelman, more or less a helmsman, though slaves were not permitted that title. As a result, he was very knowledgeable about Charleston harbor. At age 17, Smalls married Hannah Jones, an enslaved hotel maid, in Charleston on December 24, 1856. She was five years his senior and already had two daughters. Their own first child, Elizabeth Lydia Smalls, was born in February 1858. Three years later they had a son, Robert Jr., who later died at age two. Robert aimed to pay for their freedom by purchasing them outright, but the price was steep, $800 (). He had managed to save up only $100. It could take decades for him to reach $800. Civil war The gunboat CSS Planter, run out of Charleston by Robert Smalls in May 1862 Map of early African-American involvement in the Civil War, including Robert Smalls's liberation of the Planter =Escape from slavery= In April 1861, the American Civil War began with the Battle of Fort Sumter in nearby Charleston Harbor. In the fall of 1861, Smalls was assigned to steer the CSS Planter, a lightly armed Confederate military transport under the command of Charleston's District Commander Brigadier General Roswell S. Ripley. Planters duties were to deliver dispatches, troops and supplies, to survey waterways, and to lay mines. Smalls piloted the Planter throughout Charleston harbor and beyond, on area rivers and along the South Carolina, Georgia and Florida coasts.Smalls piloted an expedition to survey all the sandbars \\"on the coast of South Carolina, Georgia and Florida\\". From Charleston harbor, Smalls and the Planters crew could see the line of federal blockade ships in the outer harbor, seven miles away. Smalls appeared content and had the confidence of the Planters crew and owners, and at some time in April 1862, Smalls began to plan an escape. He discussed the matter with all the other slaves in the crew except one, whom he did not trust. On May 12, 1862, the Planter traveled ten miles southwest of Charleston to stop at Coles Island, a Confederate post on the Stono River that was being dismantled. There the ship picked up four large guns to transport to a fort in Charleston harbor. Back in Charleston, the crew loaded of ammunition and of firewood onto the Planter. On the evening of May 12, the Planter was docked as usual at the wharf below General Ripley's headquarters. Its three white officers disembarked to spend the night ashore, leaving Smalls and the crew on board, \\"as was their custom.\\" (Afterward, the three Confederate officers were court-martialed and two convicted, but the verdicts were later overturned.) However, before the officers departed, Smalls asked Captain Relyea if the crews‚Äô families could visit, which was occasionally allowed, and he approved on condition that they depart before curfew. When the families arrived, the men revealed the plan to them. > This was the first the women and children had heard of it, although Smalls > recently had told [his wife] Hannah. She had known that Smalls longed to > escape but hadn‚Äôt realized that he was formulating a plan and intended to > execute it. She was taken aback but quickly regained her composure and told > him, ‚ÄúIt is a risk, dear, but you and I, and our little ones must be free. I > will go, for where you die, I will die....The other women were less > steadfast. They cried and screamed when they learned what they had stumbled > into, and the men struggled to quiet them. ...Later, once the shock had worn > off, those women admitted that they were glad for a chance at freedom... At some point, three crew members pretended to escort family members back home but circled around and hid aboard another steamer docked at the North Atlantic wharf. At about 3 a.m. May 13, Smalls and seven of the eight slave crewmen made their previously planned escape to the Union blockade ships. Smalls put on the captain's uniform and wore a straw hat similar to the captain's. He sailed the Planter past what was then called Southern Wharf and stopped at another wharf to pick up his wife and children and the families of other crewmen. Smalls guided the ship past the five Confederate harbor forts without incident, as he gave the correct signals at checkpoints. The Planter had been commanded by a Captain Charles C. J. Relyea and Smalls copied Relyea's manners and straw hat on deck to fool Confederate onlookers from shore and the forts. The Planter sailed past Fort Sumter at about 4:30 a.m. > As the nearly-free slaves approached Fort Sumter, their apprehension began > to grow. It was the most heavily armed of the forts and tended to be manned > by the most suspicious soldiers. One of the men aboard later said, ‚ÄúWhen we > drew near the fort every man but Robert Smalls felt his knees giving way and > the women began crying and praying again. ‚Ä¶As the Planter approached the > fort, several men urged Smalls to give it a wide berth. Smalls refused, > saying that such behavior would almost certainly arouse suspicion. He > steered the ship along its normal path, slowly, as though he were merely > enjoying the early morning air and in no particular hurry. When Fort Sumter > flashed the challenge signal, Smalls again gave the correct hand signs. > There was a long pause. The fort didn‚Äôt immediately respond, and Smalls now > expected cannon fire to shred the Planter at any moment. Finally, the fort > signaled that all was well, and Smalls sailed his ship out of the harbor. The alarm was only raised after the ship was beyond gun range. Rather than turn east towards Morris Island, Smalls had headed straight for the Union Navy fleet, replacing the rebel flags with a white bed sheet which was brought by his wife. The Planter had been seen by the , which was about to fire until a crewman spotted the white flag. In the dark, the sheet was difficult to see, but the sunrise arrived which allowed viewing. Witness account: > Just as No. 3 port gun was being elevated, someone cried out, \\"I see > something that looks like a white flag\\"; and true enough there was something > flying on the steamer that would have been white by application of soap and > water. As she neared us, we looked in vain for the face of a white man. When > they discovered that we would not fire on them, there was a rush of > contrabands out on her deck, some dancing, some singing, whistling, jumping; > and others stood looking towards Fort Sumter, and muttering all sorts of > maledictions against it, and \\"de heart of de Souf,\\" generally. As the > steamer came near, and under the stern of the Onward, one of the Colored men > stepped forward, and taking off his hat, shouted, \\"Good morning, sir!

Fort Sumter National Monument marker of the Map of Charleston Harbor defenses The Onwards captain, John Frederick Nickels, boarded the Planter, and Smalls asked for a United States flag to display. He surrendered the Planter and its cargo to the United States Navy. Smalls' escape plan had succeeded. The Planter and description of Smalls' actions were forwarded by Lt. Nickels to his commander, Capt. E.G. Parrott. In addition to its own light guns, Planter carried the four loose artillery pieces from Coles Island and the 200 pounds of ammunition. Most valuable, however, were the captain's code book containing the Confederate signals and a map of the mines and torpedoes that had been laid in Charleston's harbor. Smalls' own extensive knowledge of the Charleston region's waterways and military configurations proved highly valuable. Parrott again forwarded the Planter to flag officer Du Pont at Port Royal, describing Smalls as very intelligent. Smalls gave detailed information about Charleston's defenses to Du Pont, commander of the blockading fleet. Federal officers were surprised to learn from Smalls that contrary to their calculations, only a few thousand troops remained to protect the area, the rest having been sent to Tennessee and Virginia. They also learned that the Coles Island fortifications on Charleston's southern flank were being abandoned and were without protection. This intelligence allowed Union forces to capture Coles Island and its string of batteries without a fight on May 20, a week after Smalls' escape. The Union would hold the Stono inlet as a base for the remaining three years of the war. Du Pont was impressed, and wrote the following to the Navy secretary in Washington: \\"Robert, the intelligent slave and pilot of the boat, who performed this bold feat so skillfully, informed me of [the capture of the Sumter gun], presuming it would be a matter of interest.\\" He \\"is superior to any who have come into our lines ‚Äî intelligent as many of them have been.\\" =Service to the Union= Smalls, having just turned 23, quickly became known in the North as a hero for his daring exploit. Newspapers and magazines reported his actions. The U.S. Congress passed a bill awarding Smalls and his crewmen the prize money for the Planter (valuable not only for its guns but low draft in Charleston bay); Southern newspapers demanded harsh discipline for the Confederate officers whose joint shore leave had allowed the slaves to steal the boat.Philip Dray, Capitol Men (Houghton Mifflin Company 2008), p. 9. Smalls's share of the prize money came to . Immediately after the capture, Smalls was invited to travel to New York to help raise money for ex-slaves, but Admiral DuPont vetoed the proposal and Smalls began to serve the Union Navy, especially with his detailed knowledge of mines laid near Charleston. However, with the encouragement of Major General David Hunter, the Union commander at Port Royal, Smalls went to Washington, D.C., in August 1862 with Rev. Mansfield French, a Methodist minister who had helped found Wilberforce University in Ohio and had been sent by the American Missionary Association to help former slaves at Port Royal.Dray, p. 13. They wanted to persuade Lincoln and Secretary of War Edwin Stanton to permit black men to fight for the Union. Although Lincoln had previously rescinded orders by Hunter and Generals Fremont and Sherman to mobilize black troops, Stanton soon signed an order permitting up to 5,000 African Americans to enlist in the Union forces at Port Royal. Those who did were organized as the 1st and 2nd South Carolina Regiments (Colored). Smalls worked as a civilian with the Navy until March 1863, when he was transferred to the Army. By his own account, Smalls was present at 17 major battles and engagements in the Civil War. After capture, the Planter required some repairs, which were performed locally, and went into Union service near Fort Pulaski. The boat was valued for its shallow draft, compared to other boats in the fleet. Smalls was made pilot of the under Captain Alexander Rhind. In June of that year, Smalls was piloting the Crusader on Edisto in Wadmalaw Sound when the Planter returned to service, and an infantry regiment engaged in the Battle of Simmon's Bluff at the head of the Edisto River. He continued to pilot the Crusader and the Planter. As a slave, he had assisted in laying mines (then called \\"torpedoes\\") along the coast and river. Now, as a pilot, he helped find and remove them and serviced the blockade between Charleston and Beaufort. He was also present when the Planter was fired upon at several fights at Adam's Run on the Dawho River and at battles at Rockville, at John's Island, and at the Second Battle of Pocotaligo. He was made pilot of the ironclad , again under captain Rhind, and took part in the attack on Fort Sumter on April 7, 1863, which was a preamble to the Second Battle of Fort Sumter later that fall. The Keokuk took 96 hits and retired for the night, sinking the next morning. Smalls and much of the crew moved to the Ironside and the fleet returned to Hilton Head. Gillmore's approaches on Fort Wagner, Morris Island, July 1863 before the Second Battle of Fort Wagner. Lighthouse where Smalls served is marked on southern end of Morris Island In June 1863, David Hunter was replaced as commander of the Department of the South by Quincy Adams Gillmore. With Gillmore's arrival, Smalls was transferred to the quartermaster's department. Smalls was pilot of the , later recommissioned in the Confederate Navy the Stono in the expedition on Morris Island. When Union troops took the south end of the Island, Smalls was put in charge of the Light House Inlet as pilot. On December 1, 1863, Smalls was piloting the Planter under Captain James Nickerson on Folly Island Creek when Confederate batteries at Secessionville opened. Nickerson fled the pilot house for the coal-bunker. Smalls refused to surrender, fearing that the black crewmen would not be treated as prisoners of war and might be summarily killed. Smalls entered the pilothouse and took command of the boat and piloted it to safety. For this, he was reportedly promoted by Gillmore to the rank of captain and made acting captain of the Planter. In May 1864, he was voted an unofficial delegate to the Republican National Convention in Baltimore. Later that spring, Smalls piloted the Planter to Philadelphia for an overhaul. In Philadelphia, he supported what was known as the Port Royal Experiment, an effort to raise money to support the education and development of ex-slaves. At the outset of the Civil War, Smalls could not read or write, but he achieved literacy in Philadelphia. In 1864, Smalls was in a streetcar in Philadelphia and was ordered to give his seat to a white passenger. Rather than ride on the open overflow platform, Smalls left the car. This incident of humiliating a heroic veteran was cited in the debate that resulted in the legislature's passing a bill to integrate public transportation in Pennsylvania in 1867. In December 1864, Smalls and the Planter moved to support William T. Sherman's army in Savannah, Georgia, at the destination point of his March to the Sea. Smalls returned with the Planter to Charleston harbor in April 1865 for the ceremonial raising of the American flag again at Fort Sumter. Smalls was discharged on June 11, 1865. Other vessels Smalls piloted during the war include the and the .Turkel, Stanley. Heroes of the American Reconstruction: Profiles of Sixteen Educators, Politicians and Activists. McFarland, 2005. He continued to pilot the Planter, serving a humanitarian mission of taking food and supplies to freedmen who lost their homes and livelihoods during the war. On September 30, the Planter entered the service of the Freedmen's Bureau.Reef, Catherine. African Americans in the Military. Infobase Publishing, May 14, 2014, pp. 184‚Äì186. =Commission and prize money= Smalls's position in the Union Army and Navy has been disputed and Smalls's reward for the capture of the Planter has been criticized. During Smalls's life, articles about Smalls state that when he was assigned to pilot the Planter, the Navy did not allow him to hold the rank of pilot because he was not a graduate of a naval academy, a requirement at that time. To assure he received proper pay for a captain, he was commissioned second lieutenant of the 1st South Carolina Volunteers (later re-designated as the 33rd US Colored Infantry) and detailed to act as pilot. Many sources also state that General Gillmore promoted Smalls to captain in December 1863 when he saved the Planter when it was under attack near Secessionville. Later sources state that Smalls did receive a commission either in the Army or the Navy, but he was likely officially a civilian throughout the war. Later in his life, when Smalls sought a Navy pension, he learned that he had not been officially commissioned. He claimed he had received an official commission from Gillmore but had lost it. In 1883, a bill passed committee to put him on the Navy retired list, but in the end was halted, allegedly due to Smalls being black. In 1897, a special act of congress granted Smalls a pension of $30 per month, equal to the pension for a Navy captain. In 1883, during discussion of the bill to put Smalls on the Navy retired list, a report stated that the 1862 appraisal of the Planter was \\"absurdly low\\" and that a fair valuation would have been over $60,000. However, Smalls received no further payment until 1900. That year, Congress passed a statute paying Smalls $5,000 less the amount paid to him in 1862 ($1,500) for his capture of the steamship. Many still felt that this was less than his due. After the Civil War Immediately following the war, Smalls returned to his native Beaufort, where he purchased his former master's house at 511 Prince St, which Union tax authorities had seized in 1863 for refusal to pay taxes. Later, the former owner sued to regain the property, but Smalls retained ownership in the court case. The case became an important precedent in other, similar cases. His mother, Lydia, lived with him for the remainder of her life. He allowed his former master's wife, the elderly Jane Bond McKee, to move into her former home prior to her death. Smalls spent nine months learning to read and write. He purchased a two-story Beaumont building to use as a school for African- American children. =Business ventures= Richard Gleaves, Smalls' business partner after the war In 1866 Smalls went into business in Beaufort with Richard Howell Gleaves, a businessman from Philadelphia. They opened a store to serve the needs of freedmen. Smalls also hired a teacher to help him study. That April, the Radical Republicans who controlled Congress overrode President Andrew Johnson's vetoes and passed a Civil Rights Act. In 1868, they passed the 14th Amendment, which was ratified by the states to extend full citizenship to all Americans regardless of race. Smalls invested significantly in the economic development of the Charleston-Beaufort region. In 1870, in anticipation of a Reconstruction-based prosperity, Smalls, with fellow representatives Joseph Rainey, Alonzo Ransier and others, formed the Enterprise Railroad, an 18-mile horse-drawn railway line that carried cargo and passengers between the Charleston wharves and inland depots.; Except for one white director (\\"Carpetbagger\\" newspaper editor legislator and county treasurer Timothy Hurley), the railroad's board of directors was entirely African American.Powers, p. 169. Richard H. Cain was its first president. Author Bernard E. Powers describes it as \\"the most impressive commercial venture by members of Charleston's black elite.\\"By the mid-1870s, the railroad had passed into new, mostly white ownership. It survived into the 1890s. ; Radio presentation, \\"Enterprise Railroad.\\" mp3 format. Smalls owned and helped publish a black-owned newspaper, the Beaufort Southern Standard starting in 1872. Political career Small's wartime fame and his fluency with the Gullah dialect gave him an avenue for political advancement. =Political affiliation= Smalls was a loyal Republican, which, at the time, dominated the Northern States and passed laws that granted protections for African Americans, whereas the Democrats, who dominated the South, opposed these measures.Wolchover, Natalie (2012) Why Did the Democratic and Republican Parties Switch Platforms?. After the Civil War, Republicans passed laws that granted protections for African Americans and advanced social justice; again, Democrats largely opposed these expansions of power. On August 22, 1912, he wrote to U.S. Senator Knute Nelson, \\"I never lose sight of the fact that had it not been for the Republican Party, I never would have been an office-holder of any kind‚Äîfrom 1862 to the present.\\"Yellin, Eric Steven (2007). Racism in the Nation's Service: Government Workers and the Color Line in Woodrow Wilson's America. UNC Press Books. . p. 77. In words that became famous, he described his party as \\"the party of Lincoln...which unshackled the necks of four million human beings.\\" He wrote this line on September 12, 1912, in a letter expressing his anxiety over the looming presidential election.Yellin, pp. 76-77. He concluded that letter, \\"I ask that every colored man in the North who has a vote to cast would cast that vote for the regular Republican Party and thus bury the Democratic Party so deep that there will not be seen even a bubble coming from the spot where the burial took place.\\"Newkirk, Pamela (2009). Letters from Black America. Farrar, Straus and Giroux. . pp. 123‚Äì4. =State politics= Smalls was a delegate at the 1868 South Carolina Constitutional Convention where he was a part of the effort to make free, compulsory schooling available to all South Carolina children. He also served as a delegate at several Republican National Conventions; he also participated in the South Carolina Republican State conventions. In 1868, Smalls was elected to the South Carolina House of Representatives. He was very effective, and introduced the Homestead Act and introduced and worked to pass the Civil Rights bill. In 1870, Jonathan Jasper Wright was elected judge of the South Carolina Supreme Court and Smalls was elected to fill his unexpired time in the Senate. He continued in the Senate, winning the 1872 election against W. J. Whipper. In the senate he was considered a very good speaker and debater. He was on the Finance Committee and chairman of the Public Printing Committee.Simmons, William J., and Henry McNeal Turner. Men of Mark: Eminent, Progressive and Rising. GM Rewell & Company, 1887. pp 165‚Äì179. He was a delegate to the National Republican Conventions in 1872 in Philadelphia, which nominated Grant for president; in 1876 in Cincinnati, which nominated Hayes; and in 1884 in Chicago, which nominated Blaine‚Äîand then continuously to all conventions until 1896.Foner, Eric ed., Freedom's Lawmakers: A Directory of Black Officeholders During Reconstruction Revised Edition. (Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press, 1996). . p. 198. He was also elected vice- president of the South Carolina Republican Party at their 1872 state convention. In 1873, he was appointed lieutenant-colonel of the Third Regiment, South Carolina State Militia. He was later promoted to brigadier- general of the Second Brigade, South Carolina Militia, and the major-general of the Second Division, South Carolina State Militia. He held this position until 1877, when Democrats took control of the state government. =National politics= George D. Tillman, one of Smalls' chief rivals in Congressional races In 1874, Smalls was elected to the United States House of Representatives, where he served two terms from 1875 to 1879. From 1882 to 1883, he represented South Carolina's 5th congressional district in the House. The state legislature gerrymandered to change the district boundaries, including Beaufort and other heavily black, coastal areas in South Carolina's 7th congressional district, giving the others substantial white majorities. Smalls was elected from the 7th district and served from 1884 to 1887. He was a member of the 44th, 45th, 47th, 48th, and 49th U.S. Congresses. In 1875, he opposed the transfer of troops out of the South, fearing the effect of such a move on the safety of blacks in the South. During consideration of a bill to reduce and restructure the United States Army, Smalls introduced an amendment that \\"Hereafter in the enlistment of men in the Army...no distinction whatsoever shall be made on account of race or color.\\" However, the amendment was not considered by Congress. He was the last Republican elected from the 5th district until 2010 when Mick Mulvaney took office. He was the second- longest serving African-American member of Congress (behind his contemporary Joseph Rainey) until the mid-20th century. After the Compromise of 1877, the U.S. government withdrew its remaining forces from South Carolina and other Southern states. Conservative Southern Bourbon Democrats, who called themselves the Redeemers, had resorted to violence and election fraud to regain control of the state legislature. As part of wide-ranging white efforts to reduce African-American political power, Smalls was charged and convicted of taking a bribe five years earlier in connection with the awarding of a printing contract. He was pardoned as part of an agreement by which charges were also dropped against Democrats accused of election fraud. The scandal took a political toll, and he was defeated by Democrat George D. Tillman in 1878, and again, narrowly, in 1880. He successfully contested the 1880 result and regained the seat in 1882. In 1884, he was elected to fill a seat in a different district. He was nominated for Senate but defeated by Wade Hampton in 1886. During this period in Congress he supported racial integration legislation, supported a pension for the widow of his former Major General, David Hunter, and advised South Carolina blacks to refrain from emigrating to the North and Midwest or to Liberia. In 1890, he was appointed by President Benjamin Harrison as collector of the Port of Beaufort, which he held until 1913 except during Democrat Grover Cleveland's second term. Smalls was active into the twentieth century. He was a delegate to the 1895 South Carolina constitutional convention. Together with five other black politicians, he strongly opposed white Democratic efforts that year to disfranchise black citizens. They wrote an article for the New York World to publicize the issues, but the state constitution was ratified. It and similar constitutions across the South for some time passed challenges that reached the US Supreme Court, resulting in the exclusion of African Americans from politics across the South and crippling of the Republican Party in the region. In the late 1890s, he began to suffer from diabetes. He turned down an offer of a colonelcy of a black regiment in the Spanish-American War and to the post of minister to Liberia. =Local politics= Though Smalls was not officially involved with politics on the local level, he had some influence. In 1913, in one of his final actions as community leader, he played an important role in stopping a lynch mob from killing two black suspects in the murder of a white man. He pressured the mayor, saying that blacks he had sent throughout the city would burn the town down if the mob was not stopped. The mayor and sheriff stopped the mob. Family With his first wife Hannah Jones Smalls, whom he married on December 24, 1856, Robert Smalls had three children: Elizabeth Lydia (1858‚Äì1959; m. Samuel Jones Bampfield, nine living children); Robert Jr. (1861‚Äì1863), who died at the age of two; and Sarah Voorhies (1863‚Äì1920, m. Dr. Jay Williams, no children). Hannah Jones Smalls had two daughters before she met and married Robert Smalls: Charlotte Jones (m. Willie Williams) and Clara Jones (m. James Rider). Smalls and his family were affiliated with the Baptist Church and attended Berean Baptist Church when living in Washington, D.C. Smalls was a Prince Hall mason as a member of Sons of Beaufort Lodge #36. Hannah Smalls died on July 28, 1883. On April 9, 1890, Robert Smalls married Annie E. Wigg, a Charleston schoolteacher, who bore him one son, William Robert Smalls (1892‚Äì1970). Annie Smalls died on November 5, 1895.Billingsley, p. 213. Smalls died of malaria and diabetes in 1915 at the age of 75. He was buried in his family's plot in the churchyard of the Tabernacle Baptist Church in downtown Beaufort. The monument to Smalls in this churchyard is inscribed with a statement he made to the South Carolina legislature in 1895: \\"My race needs no special defense, for the past history of them in this country proves them to be the equal of any people anywhere. All they need is an equal chance in the battle of life.\\" Honors and legacy *Fort Robert Smalls was named in his honor; it was built by free blacks in 1863 on McGuire's Hill on the South Side of Pittsburgh during the American Civil War.

He was influenced by his uncle and eminent artist, Arthur Hughes who was associated with the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, and worked closely with one of the Brotherhood's founders, William Holman Hunt. Work Having settled on his career choice, Edward Robert Hughes attended Heatherley's in London to prepare himself for the chance of auditioning for the Royal Academy School. Hughes became a student at the Royal Academy School in 1868. While Pre-Raphaelitism played an influential part in shaping Hughes work, Aestheticism is also seen in his paintings. E.R.Hughes is widely known for his works Midsummer Eve and Night With Her Train of Stars yet he built a career as a portrait painter to the upper classes. In addition to being an accomplished artist himself, E.R.Hughes was also a studio assistant to the elder artist and Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood founding member William Holman Hunt. In later life Hunt suffered from glaucoma and Hughes made a substantial contribution to a number of Hunt's paintings. Two of the paintings that Hughes worked on with Hunt were The Light of the World, which is displayed in St Paul's Cathedral, and The Lady of Shalott, which is exhibited at the Wadsworth Atheneum. On his own he experimented with ambitious techniques and was a perfectionist; he did numerous studies for many of his paintings, some of which turned out to be good enough for exhibition. Holman Hunt's Lady of Shalott, 1889-1892, with the assistance of Hughes. Hughes held several important offices within the artistic community over his lifetime such as becoming a member of the Art Workers Guild in 1888, and was on their committee from 1895 to 1897. He was elected to Associate Membership of The Royal Water Colour Society (ARWS) on 18 February 1891, and he chose as his diploma work for election to full membership a mystical piece (Oh, What's That in the Hollow?) inspired by a verse by Christina Rossetti entitled Amor Mundi. His painting A Witch was given by the Royal Watercolour Society to King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra to mark the coronation in 1902. This work is based on his illustration entitled The Demon transporting Isabella to Ortodosia in W.G. Waters The Italian Novelists published in 1901. In later years Hughes served as the Vice-President of the RWS before leaving in 1903.Throughout his career, E.R.Hughes exhibited his works in several galleries around London: Dudley Gallery, Grosvenor Gallery, New Gallery, The Royal Academy, and toward the end of his career he exhibited with The Royal Society of Painters in Water Colours (RWS). His works can be seen in public collections including Cartwright Hall, Bradford, Cambridge & County Folk Museum, Maidstone Museum & Art Gallery, Bruce Castle Museum, Kensington Central Library, Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery, the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, the Harris Museum & Art Gallery, Preston, and the National Trust for Scotland. Birmingham Museums Trust staged a retrospective exhibition, Enchanted Dreams: The Pre-Raphaelite Art of E.R. Hughes, from 17 October 2015 to 21 February 2016 at Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery. His auction record is $866,500 for Dream Idyll (A Valkyrie), set at Sotheby's (New York) on 22 October 2009.19th Century European Art, Sotheby's, October 2009 Family Life E.R. Hughes (known to his family as \\"Ted\\") was born in Clerkenwell, London, in 1851 to Edward Hughes Snr. and Harriet Foord. He had one brother, William Arthur Hughes, who was two years younger than him, became a frame maker (gilder) and by 1891 a photographer. During the 1860s he lived for a time with his uncle Arthur Hughes and his family which included his son Arthur Foord Hughes, also an artist. In 1874 Hughes became engaged to Mary MacDonald, the daughter of the writer George MacDonald. Unfortunately Mary died four years later. In 1883 Hughes married Emily Eliza Davies. In 1913 they moved to St Albans, Hertfordshire, where he was later stricken with appendicitis. He died after surgery on 23 April 1914 in his home (no. 3 Romeland). The marriage did not produce any offspring.

Hunt has served on the Smithsonian Institution's National Board of Directors. Hunt‚Äôs abstract, contemporary sculpture work is notable for its presence in public displays as early as the 1960s, despite social pressures for the obstruction of African- American art at the time. Early life and education He was born in 1935 on Chicago's South Side. Hunt and his younger sister Marian grew up in South Side Chicago, but moved to Galesburg, Illinois at eleven years old where he spent majority of his time in the city of Chicago. From an early age he was interested in the arts, as his mother, an artist and librarian, would bring him to performances by local opera companies that sang classical repertoires of Mozart, Rossini, Verdi, and Handel. As a young boy, Hunt began to show enthusiasm and talent in artistic disciplines such as drawing and painting, and also sculpture, an interest that grew more and more as he got older. Hunt was inspired to pursue his career in the arts because his family appreciated art and he clearly said \\"My mom was supportive and dad was tolerant.\\" In the seventh grade, Hunt attended the Junior School of Art Institute of Chicago where he began his interest in art. Hunt also acquired business sense and awareness of social issues from working for his father in a barbershop. As a teenager, Hunt began his work in sculpture, working in clay and carvings. While his work started in a makeshift studio in his 1950 bedroom, he eventually built a basement studio in his father's barbershop. Hunt not only embraced the medium of metal and the techniques of sculpting, but studied non- art subjects at University of Chicago and University of Illinois before entering the Art Institute of Chicago. The non-art subjects that Hunt first work with were objects he found. He was once interested in Surrealism where he experiment with the assemblage of broken machine parts and metals from the junkyard such as car bumpers and reshaping them into organic forms. Hunt worked with materials of copper, iron and then to steel and aluminum which led to him to produce a series of \\"hybrid figures\\" which where reference to human, animal and plant forms. This where Hunt attains a combination of organic and industrial subject matter in his artwork. Hunt studied at the Art Institute of Chicago from 1953 to 1957, focusing on welding sculptures, but also studying lithography. His earliest works were more figural than his later ones, and usually represented classical themes. Hunt began exhibiting his sculptures nationwide while still a student at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. As a Junior, his piece ‚ÄúArachne,‚Äù was purchased by the Museum of Modern Art in New York. He received a B.A.E. from the Art Institute of Chicago in 1957. Upon graduating, Hunt was awarded the James Nelson Raymond Foreign Travel Fellowship and continued his studies in England, France, Italy, and Spain. His time abroad solidified his belief that metal was the definitive medium of the twentieth century. Upon returning from his studies abroad, Hunt served in the United States Army from 1958 to 1960. He became the youngest exhibiting artist at the 1962 Seattle World's Fair. Winged Man sculpture by Richard Hunt in Chicago, IL, 1987 Career \\"Symbiosis\\" by Richard Hunt was a gift to Howard University by former school trustee Hobart Taylor. Hunt began to experiment with materials and sculpting techniques, influenced heavily by progressive twentieth-century artists. Hunt was inspired to focus on sculpture because of the 1950s exhibition called the Sculpture of the Twentieth Century that was held at the Art Institute of Chicago in 1953. The Sculpture of the Twentieth Century include works of Pablo Picasso, Juilo Gonzalez, and David Smith. At the exhibition, this was the first time Hunt saw various artworks of welded metal. In fact, Hunt was also inspired and paid respect to European sculptor Duchamp -Villon whose 1914 bronze \\"Horse\\" was instructional. Seeing these artists' works led Hunt to created abstract shapes by welding metal. In the 1960s and 1970s, Hunt used car junkyards as his quarries and turned bumpers and fenders into abstract, welded sculptures. Hunt also focused on linear-spatial arrangement of his materials where he followed Julio Gonzalez's footsteps into three dimensional structures. This experimentation garnered critically positive response from the art community, such that Hunt was exhibited at the Artists of Chicago and Vicinity Show and the American Show, where the Museum of Modern Art purchased a piece for its collection. He was the youngest artist to exhibit at the 1962 Seattle World's Fair, a major international survey exhibition of modern art. In fact, Hunt received his first sculpture commission in 1967 known as Play, which was commissioned by the State of Illinois Public Art Program. The making of this sculpture led him to many other public commissions and was considered to be his second career as a public sculptor. Hunt has completed more public sculptures than any other artist in the country. As of January 20, 2015, Hunt has created over 125 sculptures for public display in the United States. His signature pieces include Jacob's Ladder at the Carter G. Woodson Library in Chicago and Flintlock Fantasy in Detroit. He was appointed by President Lyndon Johnson as one of the first artists to serve on the governing board of the National Endowment for the Arts and he also served on boards of the Smithsonian Institution. From 1980 to 1988, Hunt served as Commissioner of the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of American Art. From 1994 to 1997, Hunt served on the Smithsonian Institution's National Board of Directors. Hunt is the recipient of numerous awards and honorary degrees. In 1974, Hunt acquired a deactivated electrical substation near northern Chicago and repurposed it into a metal welding sculpture studio. The station came equipped with a crane, which was convenient for moving large sculpture pieces, and a spacious 40-foot ceiling. While handling the metal, Hunt works with two assistants. Hunt describes metalworks as \\"free play of forms evolving, developing and contrasting with one another.\\" Hunt has continued to experiment throughout his successful career, employing a wide range of sculptural techniques. Through his work, Hunt often makes comments on contemporary social and political issues.

The Latin word ambitus is the origin of the English word \\"ambition\\" which is another of its original meanings; ambitus was the process of \\"going around and commending oneself or one's prot√©g√©s to the people,\\" an activity liable to unethical excesses.Fergus Millar, The Crowd in Rome in the Late Republic (University of Michigan Press, 1998, reprinted 2005), p. 216 online. The Latin word derives from ambi-, \\"both, around,\\" and a substantive form of the verb ire, \\"to go.\\" In practice, bringing a charge of ambitus against a public figure became a favored tactic for undermining a political opponent. The Lex Baebia was the first law criminalizing electoral bribery, instituted by M. Baebius Tamphilus during his consulship in 181 BC. The passage of Rome's first sumptuary law the previous year suggests that the two forms of legislation are related; both were aimed at curbing wealth-based inequities of power and status within the governing classes.William Vernon Harris, War and Imperialism in Republican Rome, 327‚Äì70 B.C. (Oxford University Press, 1979, 1985), p. 89, note 3 online. The temptation to indulge in bribery indicates that the traditional patron-client relationship was insufficient to gather enough votes to win election.Fergus Millar, \\"The Political Character of the Classical Roman Republic, 200‚Äì151 B.C.,\\" Journal of Roman Studies 74 (1984), pp. 10 (especially note 36) and 11. The word ambitus for electoral corruption is a general term for the crime; defendants would have been charged under a specific statute (lex).Michael C. Alexander, Trials in the Late Roman Republic, 149 BC to 50 BC (University of Toronto Press, 1990), pp. xi‚Äìxii. The 2nd-century BC Greek historian Polybius, a major source on the workings of the Roman constitution, makes the extravagant assertion that while Carthaginians acquire public office by openly offering gifts, the penalty at Rome for doing so is death.Polybius 6.56.4. The point is perhaps that ambitus could be construed as treason under some circumstances.Richard Alexander Bauman, \\"The Leges iudiciorum publicorum and Their Interpretation in the Republic, Principate, and Later Empire,\\" Aufstieg und Niedergang der r√∂mischen Welt II (de Gruyter, 1980), p. 125 online. The rhetorical tactics of Cicero's speeches demonstrate how an initial charge of ambitus, under whatever statute, might devolve into an occasion for impugning or humiliating a public figure. Popularist politicians were particularly vulnerable to charges of currying favor with the masses, and ambitus might be alleged when a man of lower social rank defeated his superior in an election: \\"The defeat of a candidate boasting nobilitas by another not in possession of such standing appears to have been sufficient grounds for initiating a charge of ambitus.\\"James M. May, Trials of Character: The Eloquence of Ciceronian Ethos (University of North Carolina Press, 1988), n.p. online et passim, particularly commentary on the speech Pro Murena. See also Millar, The Crowd in Rome in the Late Republic, p. 99. During the Imperial era, the ambitious politician yielded of necessity to the bureaucrat in the holding of Roman magistracies. The Stoic philosopher Epictetus (1st‚Äì2nd centuries AD) recoiled from the rough-and-tumble of electoral politics and ambitus: Bribery of a person already holding office was covered by laws de repetundae; provincial governors were particularly susceptible to such charges.P.A. Brunt, \\"Charges of Provincial Maladministration undery the Early Principate,\\" Historia 10 (1961) 189‚Äì227. Terminology A candidate was called petitor, and his opponent with reference to him, competitor. A candidate (candidatus) was so called from his appearing in the public places, such as the fora and Campus Martius, before his fellow-citizens, in a whitened (candidus) toga. On such occasions, the candidate was attended by his friends (deductores), or followed by the poorer citizens (sectatores), who could in no other manner show their good will or give their assistance. The word assiduitas expressed both the continual presence of the candidate at Rome, and his continual solicitations. The candidate, in going his rounds or taking his walk, was accompanied by a nomenclator, who gave him the names of such persons as he might meet; the candidate was thus enabled to address them by their name, an indirect compliment which could not fail to be generally gratifying to the electors. The candidate accompanied his address with a shake of the hand (prensatio). The term benignitas comprehended generally any kind of treating, such as shows or feasts. Candidates sometimes left Rome and visited the coloniae and municipia, in which the citizens had the suffrage; thus Cicero proposed to visit the Cisalpine towns, when he was a candidate for the consulship. That ambitus, which was the object of several penal enactments, taken as a generic term, comprehended the two species ‚Äî ambitus and largitiones (bribery). Liberalitas and benignitas are opposed by Cicero, as things allowable, to ambitus and largitio, as things illegal. The word for ambitus in the Greek writers is Œ¥ŒµŒ∫Œ±œÉŒºœåœÇ (dekasmos). Money was paid for votes; and in order to ensure secrecy and secure the elector, persons called interpretes were employed to make the bargain, sequestres to hold the money until it was to be paid, and divisores to distribute it. The offence of ambitus was a matter which belonged to the judicia publica, and the enactments against it were numerous. The earliest enactment that is mentioned simply forbade persons \\"to add white to their dress\\", with a view to an election (432 BC). This seems to mean using some white sign or token on the dress, to signify that a man was a candidate. The object of the law was to check ambitio, the name for going about to canvass, in place of which ambitus was subsequently employed. Still the practice of using a white dress on occasion of canvassing was usual, and appears to have given origin to the application of the term candidatus to one who was a petitor. Laws and restrictions A Lex Poetelia (358 BC) forbade candidates canvassing on market days, and going about to the places in the country where people were collected. The law was passed mainly to check the pretensions of novi homines, of whom the nobiles were jealous. By the Lex Cornelia Baebia (181 BC), those who were convicted of ambitus were incapacitated from being candidates for ten years. The Lex Acilia Calpurnia (67 BC) was intended to suppress treating of the electors and other like matters: the penalties were fine, exclusion from the Roman Senate, and perpetual incapacity to hold office. The lex Tullia was passed in the consulship of Cicero (63 BC) for the purpose of adding to the penalties of the Acilia Calpurnia. The penalty under this lex was ten years' exile. This law forbade any person to exhibit public shows for two years before he was a candidate. It also forbade candidates hiring persons to attend them and be about their persons. In the second consulship of M. Licinius Crassus and Cn. Pompeius Magnus (55 BC) the Lex Licinia was passed. This lex, which is entitled De Sodalitiis, did not alter the previous laws against bribery; but it was specially directed against a particular mode of canvassing, which consisted in employing agents (sodales) to mark out the members of the several tribes into smaller portions, and to secure more effectually the votes by this division of labour. This distribution of the members of the tribes was called decuriatio. It was an obvious mode of better securing the votes. The mode of appointing the judices in trials under the Lex Licinia was also provided by that lex. They were called Judices Editicii, because the accuser or prosecutor nominated four tribes, and the accused was at liberty to reject one of them. The judices were taken out of the other three tribes; but the mode in which they were taken is not quite clear. The penalty under the Lex Licinia was exile, but for what period is uncertain. The Lex Pompeia (52 BC), passed when Pompeius was sole consul for part of that year, appears to have been rather a measure passed for the occasion of the trials then had and contemplated than any thing else. It provided for the mode of naming the judices, and shortened the proceedings. When C. Julius Caesar obtained the supreme power in Rome, he used to recommend some of the candidates to the people, who, of course, followed his recommendation. As to the consulship, he managed the appointments to that office just as he pleased. The Lex Julia de Ambitu was passed (18 BC) in the time of Augustus, and it excluded from office for five years those who were convicted of bribery. But as the penalty was milder than those under the former laws, we must conclude that they were repealed in whole or in part. Another Lex Julia de Ambitu was passed (8 BC) apparently to amend the law of 18 BC. Candidates were required to deposit a sum of money before canvassing, which was forfeited if they were convicted of bribery. If any violence was used by a candidate, he was liable to exile (aquae et ignis interdictio). The popular forms of election were observed during the time of Augustus. Under Tiberius they ceased. Tacitus observes, \\"The comitia were transferred from the campus to the patres,\\" the senate. While the choice of candidates was thus partly in the hands of the senate, bribery and corruption still influenced the elections, though the name of ambitus was, strictly speaking, no longer applicable. But in a short time, the appointment to public offices was entirely in the power of the emperors; and the magistrates of Rome, as well as the populus, were merely the shadow of that which had once a substantial form. A Roman jurist, of the imperial period (Modestinus), in speaking of the Julia Lex de Ambitu, observes, \\"This law is now obsolete in the city, because the creation of magistrates is the business of the princeps, and does not depend on the pleasure of the populus; but if any one in a municipium should offend against this law in canvassing for a sacerdotium or magistratus, he is punished, according to a senatus consultum, with infamy, and subjected to a penalty of 100 aurei\\". The laws that have been enumerated are probably all that were enacted, at least all of which any notice is preserved. Laws to repress bribery were made while the voting was open; and they continued to be made after the vote by ballot was introduced at the popular elections by the Lex Gabinia (139 BC). Rein observes that \\"by this change the control over the voters was scarcely any longer possible; and those who were bribed could not be distinguished from those who were not.\\" One argument in favour of ballot in modern times has been that it would prevent bribery; and probably it would diminish the practice, though not put an end to it. But the notion of Rein that the bare fact of the vote being secret would increase the difficulty of distinguishing the bribed from the unbribed is absurd; for the bare knowledge of a man's vote is no part of the evidence of bribery. It is worth remark that there is no indication of any penalty being attached to the receiving of a bribe for a vote. The utmost that can be proved is, that the divisores or one of the class of persons who assisted in bribery were punished. But this is quite consistent with the rest: the briber and his agents were punished, not the bribed. When, therefore, Rein, who refers to these two passages under the lex Tullia, says: \\"Even those who received money from the candidates, or at least those who distributed it in their names, were punished,\\" he couples two things together that are entirely of a different kind. The proposed Lex Aufidia went so far as to declare that if a candidate promised money to a tribe and did not pay it, he should be unpunished; but if he did pay the money, he should further pay to each tribe (annually?) 3000 sesterces as long as he lived. This absurd proposal was not carried; but it shows clearly enough that the principle was to punish the briber only. The trials for ambitus were numerous in the time of the republic.

Ellsworth was established in the late nineteenth century as a company town for the Spade Ranch and a shipping point for cattle on the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad. It was likely named after Ellsworth, Minnesota. A 1925 edition is available for download at University of Nebraska‚ÄîLincoln Digital Commons. Although unincorporated Ellsworth has one business, Morgan's Store and post office with the ZIP code of 69340. History In 1888 the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad chose the site as a location for a depot and water stop on their newly built line. Cattleman Bartlett Richards began assembling the expansive Spade Ranch in the same year, making Ellsworth a company town for the ranch. In 1898, the two-story Spade Ranch Store was built; it supplied freight wagons going north to the Spade Ranch Headquarters. At about the same time, a hotel was built across the street from the store, and a windmill placed in the middle of town. Bartlett Richards had a brick summer home with a courtyard built north of the store location in 1904. The Ellsworth School House, built in 1932, served Ellsworth until 2007. The Old Spade Ranch Store is the only business currently operating in the village. Geography Ellsworth is located at (42.060322, -102.280606). Demographics As of the census of 2000, there were 32 people, 11 households, and 9 families residing in the community. There are 14 housing units.

It typically expires when some authority begins a tax investigation of the past-due tax. In some cases, legislation extending amnesty also imposes harsher penalties on those who are eligible for amnesty but do not take it. Tax amnesty is one of voluntary compliance strategies to increase tax base and tax revenue. Tax amnesty is different from other voluntary compliance strategies in part where tax amnesty usually waives the taxpayers' tax liability. India had run one of the biggest Tax Amnesty scheme - IDS,2016 in the world in 2016 and managed to gather around $4 billion as taxes in 4 months. Introduction of amnesty in any fiscal year is to help a state treasury raise tax revenues, adding beneficiaries who have not declared their assets previously. The main purpose is to replicate the economy and encouraging individuals and corporations to declare their wealth as it may arises. Under this scheme the beneficiary just has to pay some tax on the total assets which are declared. States introduce this scheme when they believe that individuals are hiding their wealth from the tax authorities. https://www.dawn.com/news/1399769 https://profit.pakistantoday.com.pk/2018/04/12/benefits-of-tax-amnesty-scheme- wont-last-beyond-june-2018-moodys/ Tax revenues raised through these schemes are used for the well being of the state. Every individual and company has to report annually on their business activities in their tax return. Those who remain transparent in declaring their assets and liabilities to the tax authorities do not get inquiries or investigations. Tax amnesty is beneficial for those who have been hiding or not declaring their assets fair and transparently for years, and can make their assets legitimate by declaring them whether they exist within or outside the country.https://www.riaabarkergillette.com/pk/wp- content/uploads/2018/04/RIAABG-Insight-Pakistan-Tax-Amnesty- Ordinances-2018.pdf When such schemes are introduced, state revenue and tax departments give time to declare their wealth without any penalty. Once time elapses there will be penalty addition to original amnesty tax rate. Types of tax amnesties As mentioned above, tax amnesty schemes basically have two main features viz. financial as well as legal amnesty. Hence, it logically follows that these schemes be classified on the basis of the same criterion. This the reason why all over the world tax amnesty schemes are divided into two types. Firstly, there are schemes wherein the government provides financial relief to tax evaders. Under such schemes, the government decides to waive off all or part of the financial penalties which become due as a result of tax evasion. In some cases, the government only allows taxpayers to pay back the full sum in easy instalments over a longer time frame. Hence, investors gain because they can earn interest on the unpaid tax as well. However, in such cases, legal immunity is not provided. This would mean that if the taxable income was generated by undertaking some questionable activity like drug smuggling or other criminal endeavours, the government could still prosecute the taxpayer. On the other hand, there are some tax amnesty schemes which provide legal amnesty as well. This means that these schemes basically promise that the government will simply close their eyes to the source of the taxable income as well. The government promises to not conduct any investigation or disclose any information after they receive the tax revenue, which is due to them.  Reasons for Tax amnesty  There are several possible reasons for tax amnesty. = Economic/Financial reasons = During the crisis period financial difficulties of taxpayers as well as increased public expenditures may occur. Tax amnesties are considered necessary in order to collect at least some of the tax claims. It also helps relieve the taxpayers, who are unable to pay tax debts, and revive the market. = Political reasons = Possibility of tax amnesty may be used by political parties to gain more votes when the next election period is about to come. Determination of the extent of the amnesty is entirely political decision and is in the government‚Äôs power. = Technical and administrative reasons = For resolving existing confusions, defective points of the system and making radical changes on the tax system liquidation of past periods may be necessary. It is also hard and administratively exhaustive to collect tax debt from taxpayers in financial difficulties. Tax courts have heavy job workload and collecting of taxes takes a long time. Tax amnesty is easy and beneficial way to solve these administrative difficulties.  Negative effects  Several positive effects and reasons for tax amnesty have been mentioned, but most of them are effects only in the short run. Tax amnesty have also many opponents because of the long-therm effects on society. The main reason is that we must be all equal in terms of law and justice. Tax amnesty gives an advantage to those who break the law. People lose confidence in justice and punishments lose its effectiveness. It may lead to decreasing morality and increasing tax crimes. Some of these negative effects may be eliminated with strict regulation and careful choice of who will be tax amnesty applied on. Tax amnesty is a limited-time opportunity for a specified group of taxpayers to pay a defined amount, in exchange for forgiveness of a tax liability relating to a previous tax period or periods and without fear of criminal prosecution Instances =Australia = In 2014, in the first amnesty ever offered in Australia, thousands of rich Australian came forward to declare billions of dollars in untaxed assets and income stashed in bank accounts in Switzerland and in other countries.

The tax amnesty is referred to by the Canada Revenue Agency as the Voluntary Disclosure Program (VDP) and has its statutory authority under subsection 220(3.1) of the Income Tax Act and the sections 88 and 281.1 of the ETA which set out the rules for taxpayer relief applications. This relief is available for a 10-year period prior to the date of filing and covers unfiled tax returns and unfiled information returns such as offshore asset forms T1135 or T1134, as well as tax evasion in the form of unreported income or over claimed expenses or deductions. Eligible taxpayers will receive full penalty relief, will avoid any possible tax evasion prosecution and may obtain some interest reductions. =Germany= In 2004 Germany granted a tax amnesty in connection with tax evasion. =Greece= On September 30, 2010, the Hellenic Parliament ratified a legislation pushed through by the Greek government in an effort to raise revenue, granting tax amnesty to millions of Greek citizens by paying just 55 percent of the outstanding debts.http://newsletters.usdbriefs.com/2010/Tax/WTA/a101015_4.pdf In 2011, the European Commission requested Greece to modify its tax legislation as its tax amnesty was considered discriminatory and incompatible with European Union treaties. =India= Government of India allowed the people to declare their undisclosed incomes in Income Declaration Scheme, 2016 and pay a total of 45% tax for one time settlement. 64,275 disclosures were made amounting to ‚Çπ652.5 billion (US$9.4 billion). =Indonesia= After several tax amnesties program launched in 1964, 1984 and 2008, Indonesia has applied another tax amnesty in 2016.

The Bank of Italy estimated that Italian citizens held around ‚Ç¨500bn in undeclared funds outside the country. =Malaysia= It was introduced during Budget 2019 announcement on 2nd November 2018. =Pakistan= Pakistan introduced tax amnesty scheme in 2018 which yield $ 1 billion or Rs 121 billion tax revenues from individuals, Association of Persons & Corporations who declare their assets in this scheme. https://www.pkrevenue.com/taxation/amnesty-scheme-yields-around-1-billion-as- tax-revenue/ = Philippines = The Philippines introduced The Tax Amnesty Act of 2019 or the Republic Act No. 11213 which was signed into Law on February 14, 2019 with a Veto Message of President Rodrigo R. Duterte. The said Law was published on the Official Gazette on February 18, 2019 and took effect on March 5, 2019, that is, on the 15th day after the official publication. As a result, the Bureau of Internal Revenue which is the main collecting agency of the government, published the implementing rules and regulations on the availment of the tax amnesty, two of which are the Revenue Regulation No. 4-2019 : Amnesty on Tax Delinquencies which was issued on April 5, 2019 and Revenue Regulation No. 6-2019 : Estate Tax Amnestywhich was issued on May 29, 2019. =Portugal= Portugal introduced tax amnesties in 2005 and 2010.http://www.nordea.lu/Business+support/Wealth+Planning/Tax+News/1077802.html?newsid=8382b363-e8dd-4601-9463-a6f107c8e06b =Russia= In 2007, a Russian tax amnesty program collected $130 million in the first six months.

The City of Los Angeles collected $18.6 million in its 2009 tax amnesty program, claiming that the amount was $8.6 million more than was expected and that businesses saved $6.7 million in penalties.https://www.flickr.com/photos/37176081@N02/3878906053/ The state of Louisiana brought in $450 million from its 2009 tax amnesty program, three times more than what was expected, according to Republican Governor Bobby Jindal. The IRS Criminal Investigation Division has had a longstanding practice of granting tax amnesty to taxpayers who have committed tax crimes, usually tax evasion. Following World War II, it was the administrative policy of the Internal Revenue Service to provide amnesty from criminal prosecution to taxpayers who voluntarily disclosed their underpayment of taxes.http://georgemasonlawreview.org/wp- content/uploads/2014/03/14-3_Boise.pdf Although protected from criminal prosecution, such taxpayers still were subject to any civil penalties or interest that applied with respect to the delinquent taxes.https://www.kpateloffice.com/irs-tax-amnesty-voluntary-disclosure/ In a 2007 United States Senate bill that did not become law, a tax amnesty for illegal immigrants was proposed. The tax amnesty was supported by then- president George W. Bush and his Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff. On June 26, 2012, IRS Commissioner Doug Shulman said the IRS offshore voluntary disclosure programs has so far collected more than $5 billion in back taxes, interest and penalties from 33,000 voluntary disclosures made under the first two programs.

Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 818 (1982). It is a form of sovereign immunity less strict than absolute immunity that is intended to protect officials who \\"make reasonable but mistaken judgments about open legal questions\\",. extending to \\"all [officials] but the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law\\".. Qualified immunity applies only to government officials in civil litigation, and does not protect the government itself from suits arising from officials' actions. The U.S. Supreme Court first introduced the qualified immunity doctrine in Pierson v. Ray (1967), enacted during the height of the civil rights movement, it is stated to have been originally enacted with the rationale of protecting law enforcement officials from frivolous lawsuits and financial liability in cases where they acted in good faith in unclear legal situations. Starting around 2005, courts increasingly applied the doctrine to cases involving the use of excessive or deadly force by police, leading to widespread criticism that it \\"has become a nearly failsafe tool to let police brutality go unpunished and deny victims their constitutional rights\\" (as summarized in a 2020 Reuters report).  History and background  = Pierson v. Ray = In Pierson v. Ray (1967), the Supreme Court first justified the need for qualified immunity from civil rights violation lawsuits for law enforcement officers by arguing that \\"[a] policeman‚Äôs lot is not so unhappy that he must choose between being charged with dereliction of duty if he does not arrest when he had probable cause, and being punished with damages if he does.\\" = Bivens and 42 USC ¬ß 1983 lawsuits = Qualified immunity frequently arises in civil rights cases, particularly in lawsuits arising under 42 USC ¬ß 1983 and Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents (1971). Under 42 USC ¬ß 1983, a plaintiff can sue for damages when state officials violate his constitutional rights or other federal rights. The text of 42 USC Sec. 1983 reads as follows: > Every person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, > or usage, of any State or Territory or the District of Columbia, subjects, > or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United States or other person > within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights, > privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws, shall be > liable to the party injured .... Similarly, under Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents, plaintiffs may sue for damages if federal officials violate their constitutional rights. However, not all Constitutional violations give rise to a Bivens cause of action.Actions Against Federal Agencies and Officers, 14 Fed. Prac. & Proc. Juris. ¬ß 3655 (4th ed.) Thus far the Supreme Court has recognized Bivens claims for violations of the Fourth Amendment,. the Fifth Amendment's equal protection component of due process,. and the Eighth Amendment.. = Harlow v. Fitzgerald = The modern test for qualified immunity was established in Harlow v. Fitzgerald (1982).. Prior to Harlow v. Fitzgerald, the U.S. Supreme Court granted immunity to government officials only if: (1) the official believed in good faith that his conduct was lawful, and (2) the conduct was objectively reasonable. However, determining an official's subjective state of mind (i.e. did he have a good faith belief that his action was lawful) required a trial, often by jury. Concerns over allowing suits to go this far deterred officials from performing their duties, \\"[diverted] official energy from pressing public issues, and [deterred] able citizens from acceptance of public office\\",Harlow, 457 U.S. at 814. the Supreme Court handed down the current rule for qualified immunity: \\"[G]overnment officials performing discretionary functions generally are shielded from liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.\\"Harlow, 457 U.S. at 818. Therefore, the application of qualified immunity no longer depends upon an official's subjective state of mind, but on whether or not a reasonable person in the official's position would have known their actions were in line with clearly established legal principles.  Application of qualified immunity  = Discretionary function requirement = Qualified immunity only applies to acts that are \\"discretionary\\" rather than ministerial. Courts specifically distinguish discretionary acts from ministerial acts.See e.g. Bletz v. Gribble, 641 F.3d 743, 757 (6th Cir. 2011); Kennedy v. Mathis, 297 Ga. App. 295, 297, 676 S.E.2d 746, 748 (2009); Rodriguez v. State, 218 Md. App. 573, 615 (2014); Baptie v. Bruno, 195 Vt. 308, 314, 88 A.3d 1212 (2013). A discretionary act requires an official to determine \\"whether an act should be done or a course pursued\\" and to determine the best means of achieving the chosen objective. By contrast, a ministerial act is of a \\"clerical nature\\"the official is typically required to perform the action regardless of his own opinion. Even ministerial tasks will sometimes involve a small amount of discretion, but this discretion will not necessarily satisfy the requirements of qualified immunity. = Clearly established law requirement = Qualified immunity does not protect officials who violate \\"clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which reasonable person would have known\\". This is an objective standard, meaning that the standard does not depend on the subjective state of mind of the official but rather on whether a reasonable person would determine that the relevant conduct violated clearly-established law. Whether the law is \\"clearly established\\" depends on whether the case law has addressed the disputed issue or has established the \\"contours of the right\\" such that it is clear that official's conduct is illegal. It is undisputed that Supreme Court opinions can \\"clearly establish\\" the rule for the entire country. However, circuit court of appeals opinions may have a more limited effect. Circuit courts of appeals typically treat their opinions as clearly establishing the law within that circuit¬ß 8:22. Post-Harlow qualified immunity test in the circuits and the states: applicable principles (Part I)‚ÄîWhose decisions determine clearly settled law?, 2 Nahmod, Civil Rights & Civil Liberties Litigation: The Law of Section 1983 ¬ß 8:22‚Äîthough the Supreme Court has cast doubt on this theory.. In order to meet the requirement of \\"Clearly Established Law\\", the facts of the instant case must also fairly closely resemble the facts of the case relied on as precedent.Pearson, et al. v. Callahan, 555 U.S. 223 (2009). = Qualified immunity sequencing = The concept of testing whether the official action was covered by qualified immunity was first raised in the 1991 case Siegert v. Gilley (1991) in which the Supreme Court affirmed a dismissal of a lawsuit due to lack of clear demonstration that a constitutional right had been violated at the time of the action as a necessary precursor for any judicial relief. In 2001, the U.S. Supreme Court in Saucier v. Katz. formalized this rigid order, or sequencing, in which courts must decide the merits of a defendant's qualified immunity defense. First, the court determines whether the complaint states a constitutional violation. If so, the next sequential step is to determine whether the right at issue was clearly established at the time of the official's conduct. The Court subsequently modified this mandatory sequencing from Saucier in Pearson v. Callahan in 2009, holding that \\"the Saucier protocol should not be regarded as mandatory in all cases,\\". and that its decision \\"does not prevent the lower courts from following the Saucier procedure; it simply recognizes that those courts should have the discretion to decide whether that procedure is worthwhile in particular cases.\\"Pearson, 555 U.S. at 821. The Pearson opinion gave courts the discretion to evaluate either the constitutional violation or the rights issue first. This can have benefits of expediting some cases and reducing waste of resources in the court system, but has also led to cases that focus heavily on one side of the case and weigh in favor of government officials, particularly in the area of police brutality. Objections and criticisms =Difficulty of suing public officials= Critics have argued that qualified immunity makes it excessively difficult to sue public officials for misconduct. Criticism is aimed in particular at the \\"clearly established law\\" test. This test is typically read as requiring not only that an official's behavior likely violates written law but that there exists a clear judicial precedent that establishes the behavior as unlawful. Critics have noted that in practice this has meant that plaintiffs must prove that there exists a prior court determination made in actual litigation under facts extremely close to those of the case at hand exists, or else the case is dismissed. Critics argue that the difficulty plaintiffs face in finding an exact match in both law and precedent makes it excessively challenging to sue public officials, giving government officials undue latitude for lawless conduct in new or unusual situations. George Leef, for instance, argued in Forbes that: Critics have cited examples such as a November 2019 ruling by the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, which found that an earlier court case ruling it unconstitutional for police to sic dogs on suspects who have surrendered by lying on the ground did not apply under the \\"clearly established\\" rule to a case in which Tennessee police allowed their police dog to bite a surrendered suspect because the suspect had surrendered not by lying down but by sitting on the ground and raising his hands. Critics further argue that the \\"clearly established\\" standard discourages and/or delays the establishment of clear rules, even for common circumstances. The first litigant to bring a case against an official under a given set of facts is likely to lose because there is as yet no clearly established standard. Therefore, such a person may not choose to bring the case at all. Furthermore, even if a case is brought and carried to judgment, there is no certainty the decision will establish a clear and generally applicable legal standard. Until such a standard is articulated, qualified immunity will continue to apply in analogous cases. As the Institute for Justice puts it, \\"Qualified immunity means that government officials can get away with violating your rights as long as they violate them in a way nobody thought of before.\\" In August 2018, Circuit Judge Don Willett concurred dubitante when the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit found that the Texas Medical Board was entitled to qualified immunity for an unconstitutional warrantless search it made of a doctor's patient records.. Willett called for \\"thoughtful reappraisal\\" of the clearly established law' prong of qualified-immunity analysis\\", citing a tendency for many courts to grant immunity based on no clear precedent, while avoiding the question of whether a Constitutional violation has occurred. Hence, those courts do not establish new law, so \\"[w]rongs are not righted, and wrongdoers are not reproached.\\" He wrote: =Police brutality= A significant amount of criticism contends that qualified immunity allows police brutality to go unpunished. Legal researchers Amir H. Ali and Emily Clark, for instance, have argued that \\"qualified immunity permits law enforcement and other government officials to violate people's constitutional rights with virtual impunity\\". Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor has noted a \\"disturbing trend\\" of siding with police officers using excessive force with qualified immunity, describing it as \\"sanctioning a 'shoot first, think later' approach to policing\\". She stated that: A 2020 Reuters report concurred with Sotomayor, concluding that \\"the Supreme Court has built qualified immunity into an often insurmountable police defense by intervening in cases mostly to favor the police\\". The report reviewed over 200 cases involving excess force by police since 2007, and found since the 2009 Pearson change from mandatory sequencing to discretionary sequencing, plaintiffs have had a more difficult time moving their case past the qualified immunity stage. =Judicial activism= No federal statute explicitly grants qualified immunity‚Äîqualified immunity is a judicial precedent established by the Supreme Court. While qualified immunity has been repeatedly affirmed by courts and legislation has established similar immunity at the state level, critics have argued that the adoption of qualified immunity in federal law amounts to judicial activism. That is, they argue the Supreme Court invented a new legal doctrine that has little basis in written law. The late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia has argued as much, stating in his dissenting opinion in Crawford-El v. Britton: \\"[the Supreme Court] find[s] [itself] engaged...in the essentially legislative activity of crafting a sensible scheme of qualified immunities for the statute we have invented‚Äîrather than applying the common law embodied in the statute that Congress wrote\\". Clarence Thomas has likewise expressed \\"growing concern with our qualified immunity jurisprudence\\", stating that there is no apparent basis for it in the original intent of the law; in Ziglar v. Abbasi, Thomas urged the court to reconsider qualified immunity, which he considered a doctrine that \\"substitute[s] our own policy preferences for the mandates of Congress.\\" Some critics have argued that the Supreme Court's creation of qualified immunity amounts to \\"gutting\\" Section 1983 of the United States Code, which allows any citizen to sue a public official who deprives them \\"of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws\\". U.S. District Court Judge Lynn Adelman has argued that \\"qualified immunity is a limitation on Section 1983 that the Court created in 1982 without support in the statute‚Äôs text or legislative history\\". University of Pennsylvania professor of law David Rudovsky similarly argued that \\"the Court...has engaged in an aggressive reconstruction of the scope of ¬ß 1983...This reorientation of civil rights jurisprudence has blunted the impact of ¬ß 1983\\". The court has stated that it bases qualified immunity on three factors: a \\"good faith\\" defense at common law, making up for the supposedly mistaken broadening of ¬ß 1983, and serving as a \\"warning\\" to government officials. But William Baude, Professor of Law at the University of Chicago Law School, states that \\"there is no such defense, there was no such mistake, and lenity [warning] should not apply. And even if these things were otherwise, the doctrine of qualified immunity would not be the best response.\\" =Ineffectiveness= In a 2017 Yale Law Journal paper titled \\"How Qualified Immunity Fails\\", UCLA law professor Joanna C. Schwartz examined 1,183 Section 1983 cases and found that it was being invoked primarily when it should not have been, and therefore was being ignored or dismissed frequently. Her conclusion was that it is ineffective for its stated goals in such a way that it could not be strengthened, and should be replaced by other mechanisms for obtaining those ends.  Challenges to qualified immunity  =Through litigation= On March 1, 2018, the Cato Institute launched a strategic campaign to challenge the doctrine of qualified immunity, centered on \\"a series of targeted amicus briefs urging the Supreme Court to reverse its precedents and eliminate the doctrine outright\\". By January 2020, this campaign had garnered the support of a cross-ideological spectrum of public interest organizations, including the ACLU, the Alliance Defending Freedom, the Institute for Justice, the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, and the Second Amendment Foundation. In 2020, there were several cases awaiting a Supreme Court decision involving qualified immunity. However, on June 15, 2020, SCOTUS declined to hear cases involving revisiting qualified immunity. =Legislative attempts= On May 30, 2020, U.S. Representative Justin Amash (L-Michigan) proposed the Ending Qualified Immunity Act, stating: \\"The brutal killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis police is merely the latest in a long line of incidents of egregious police misconduct...police are legally, politically, and culturally insulated from consequences for violating the rights of the people whom they have sworn to serve\\". On May 29, 2020, Representative Ayanna Pressley (D-Massachusetts) announced that she would cosponsor the bill. The bill was introduced in the House of Representatives on June 4, 2020, with 16 additional cosponsors. As of September 12, 2020, it now has 66 cosponsors (65 Democrats and 1 Republican). On June 3, 2020, Senators Kamala Harris (D-California), Edward Markey (D-Massachusetts), and Cory Booker (D-New Jersey) introduced a Senate resolution calling for the elimination of qualified immunity for law enforcement. Senators Bernie Sanders (D-Vermont), Elizabeth Warren (D-Massachusetts), and Chris Van Hollen (D-Maryland) are cosponsors. On June 23, 2020 Senator Mike Braun (R-Indiana), introduced the Reforming Qualified Immunity Act stating, \\"To claim qualified immunity under the Reforming Qualified Immunity Act, a government employee such as a police officer would have to prove that there was a statute or court case in the relevant jurisdiction showing his or her conduct was authorized\\".

Early life Battle was brought up in Kilkenny, Ireland, having moved from Bromley, UK at an early age. Career =Music= In 1991 Battle, along with school friends Darragh Butler (drums), Colin Fennelly (bass) and Billy Dalton (guitar) came together to formed a band called Rollercoaster before changing the name permanently to Kerbdog. Following two demo cassettes recorded in Dublin and a short support slot to Therapy? in 1992, the band was signed to Vertigo Records in London. The group released their self-titled album, produced by legendary grunge icon Jack Endino, in 1994. A second album entitled On The Turn was recorded in 1996, produced by GGGarth, but the album's release was delayed for almost a year indicating troublesome times for the band with their record company. Kerbdog were soon dropped and eventually split up in 1998. Battle and Butler immediately formed another band, along with bassist Mick Murphy, called Wilt. Their music had a greater pop influence than Kerbdog. Following the release of two albums, Bastinado and My Medicine on Infectious Records, Wilt split up in 2003 following limited success. At this point, Battle began to seriously focus on his DJ career and abandoned his musical pursuits. However, in 2005 Kerbdog reformed for a series of one-off shows. The band is still currently active on a part-time basis and have no plans to write or record new material. His favourite Oxegen memory is playing the festival with Kerbdog in 2005. =Broadcasting= Battle began life at Phantom FM before moving, along with colleagues Jenny Huston and Dan Hegarty, in 2003 to RTE.

The Adjarians had their own territorial entity, the Autonomous Republic of Adjara, founded on July 16, 1921 as the Adjara ASSR. After years of post-Soviet stalemate, the region was brought closer within the framework of the Georgian state in 2004, retaining its autonomous status. Adjarian settlements are also found in the Georgian provinces of Guria, Kvemo Kartli, and Kakheti, as well as in several areas of neighbouring Turkey. History and Religion Adjarian men's clothing Many Adjarians converted to Islam in the 16th and 17th centuries when the Ottomans ruled over southwestern Georgian lands. The Georgian population of Adjara had been generally known as Muslim Georgians until the 1926 Soviet census listed them as Adjarians, separate from the rest of Georgians, counting 71,426 of them. In subsequent censuses (1939‚Äì1989) they were listed with other Georgians, as no official Soviet census asked about religion. In the 1920s, the suppression of religion and compulsory collectivization led to armed resistance against Communist authorities by Adjarians. The collapse of the Soviet Union and the re- establishment of Georgian independence accelerated the Christianization of Adjarians, especially among the young.George Sanikidze and Edward W. Walker (2004), Islam and Islamic Practices in Georgia. Berkeley Program in Soviet and Post-Soviet Studies. University of California, Berkeley Institute of Slavic, East European, and Eurasian Studies. However, a number of Adjarians, particularly in and around Khulo, remain Sunni Muslims. According to estimates recently published by the Department of Statistics of Adjara, 70% are Christians, and 30% Muslim. Autonomous Republic of Adjara, Department of Statistics. Selim Pa≈üa (1755 ‚Äì 3 June 1815) was a Muslim Georgian nobleman of the Khimshiashvili clan and a derebey of Upper Adjara under the Ottoman suzerainty, but with considerable autonomy. His seizure of power in the Pashalik of Akhaltsikh and attempts to bring all of \\"Ottoman Georgia\\" under his rule led to a fallout with the sultan's government and a war which ended in Selim's death. Selim Bey was a son and successor of Abdullah Bey, a derebey (\\"the lord of the valleys\\") of Upper Adjara, who was killed at Aketi during his raid against the neighboring Georgian principality of Guria in 1784. Selim Bey cherished an ambition to bring all of the Ottoman possessions in Georgia under his autonomous rule. In 1802, he capitalized on a crisis in Akhaltsikh and seized control of it, declaring himself a new pasha. His adversary, ≈ûerif Pa≈üa, was able to dispossess him in June 1809, but Selim staged a comeback in 1812. His staunch opposition to the central Ottoman government led him into clandestine negotiations with the Russians through Mamia V Gurieli, Prince of Guria, whose sister was married to Selim's son Abdi Bey. In 1815, the sultan ordered him be deposed and put to death for treason. As 15,000 Ottoman troops under Pehlivan ƒ∞br√¢him Pa≈üa, serasker of Erzurum, approached, Selim fled Akhaltsikhe to the mountains of Adjara and entrenched himself in the castle of Khikhani, which fell after a two-month-long siege on 31 May 1815. Selim Pa≈üa was beheaded on 3 June 1815. Selim's four sons‚ÄîAbdi (Abdullah; 1786‚Äì1859), Ahmed (1781‚Äì1836), H√ºseyin, and Dede (Dursun)‚Äîtook shelter in Guria until the Turkish punitive force left Adjara in 1818.[1][2][3] Subsequently, they came to rule several areas in \\"Ottoman Georgia\\": Abdi Bey in Shavsheti (≈ûav≈üat), Ahmed in Upper Adjara, H√ºseyin in the Andzavi valley, and Dede in Taoskari.[2] In today's Adjara, Selim is remembered as a hero. His native village Nigazeuli hosts his museum[4] and the day of his memory, Selimoba, is marked annually in June.[5] There is a street named after Selim Khimshiashvili in Adjara's main city, Batumi, where his statue was also unveiled in 2015.[6] Memed Abashidze (Georgian: ·Éõ·Éî·Éõ·Éî·Éì ·Éê·Éë·Éê·É®·Éò·É´·Éî; January 18, 1873 ‚Äì 1937) was a Georgian politician, writer and public benefactor. An eminent leader of Muslim Georgian community of Adjarians, he was a major proponent of pro-Georgian orientation in Adjara and one of the architects of the region's autonomy within Georgia. He became a victim of Joseph Stalin‚Äôs Great Purge. Abashidze was born into the powerful Muslim Georgian noble house of Abashidze, rulers of Adjara for the Ottoman Empire. After Adjara was absorbed into Imperial Russia in 1878, Georgian intellectuals launched a campaign aimed at reincorporation of local Muslim Georgian community into the Georgian society. Mehmed‚Äôs father, Prince Ibrahim Abashidze, sided with this movement and helped open a Georgian school in Batumi in 1883. Born in Turkish-dominated Batumi, Mehmed attended this school. At the same time, he received a traditional education at home. Fluent in several languages, he began translating Arabic, Persian, and Turkish works into Georgian and authored the first Georgian textbook on the Arabic language and the first Turkish translation of the well-known medieval Georgian epic The Knight in the Panther's Skin by Shota Rustaveli (the manuscript of this translation was lost in the 1930s). Besides, Abashidze‚Äôs plays were staged in the recently opened Batumi Drama Theatre. During the Russian Revolution of 1905, he became involved in the political life of Georgia. His brother, Aslan- Beg Abashidze, was a commander of one of the revolutionary detachments. From 1904 to 1908, he was a member of the Socialist Federalist Party of Georgia and advocated pro-Georgian orientation among the Adjarian Muslims. In 1908, the Russian persecutions forced him to flee to the Ottoman Empire where he was arrested. Back in Adjara in 1913, he was imprisoned by the Tsarist police and eventually exiled to Siberia. Prohibited from returning to Batumi, he stayed in Tbilisi after his release and led the Committee of Georgian Muslims for the Batumi District. Russia‚Äôs February Revolution of 1917 enabled to him to return to his native Adjara, where his Committee quickly turned into opposition to resurgent pan-Tukist movement and attempted to bring Christian and Muslim Georgians together. In November 1917, he was elected to the National Council of Georgia. During the Turkish occupation of Batumi in 1918, he stayed in the region and was arrested for his criticism of the Turkish authorities. He escaped from the Trebizond prison later that year and welcomed the declaration of the independent Democratic Republic of Georgia in May 1918. When the British took control of Batumi from the Ottomans in December 1918, Abashidze returned to the city and organized the Congress of the People of Adjara which campaigned against the British installed government headed by the Russian Cadet Maslov. The movement forced the British military administration to organize local parliamentary elections on August 31 1919. Abashidze became chairman of the newly elected Mejlis (National Assembly) which was soon to become a scene of heated struggle between pro-Georgian and Turkophile factions. Abashidze renewed his campaign calling for the incorporation of Adjara into Georgia with an autonomous status and criticizing the Allies‚Äô attempts to turn Batumi into a free port. Upon the evacuation of the British, Georgian army entered Batumi on July 8 1920, but the question of Adjara‚Äôs autonomy remained still open. When Soviet Russia‚Äôs Red Army occupied Georgia in February-March 1921, Abashizde resigned his position in the Mejlis and chose a policy of reconciliation with the newly established Bolshevik regime. He became a member of the Revolutionary Committee of the Batumi district and took part in drafting the first constitution of the Adjar ASSR. Although the Soviet authorities were suspicious of Abashidze, he was still well treated and received a pension thanks probably to his erstwhile ties with Joseph Stalin who worked in Batumi in the early 1900s. In 1935, he became the head of the Adjarian section of the Writers‚Äô Union of Georgia. During the Great Purges, however, he was arrested on trumped-up charges of treason and executed later that year. His family members were also repressed. Abashidze was rehabilitated only in 1957. His grandson, Aslan Abashidze, became an authoritarian ruler of Adjara in the 1990s and was ousted in 2004 shortly after the Rose Revolution in Georgia.  Language  The Adjarians speak Adjarian, a Georgian dialect related to the one spoken in the neighbouring northern province of Guria, but with a number of Turkish loanwords. Adjarian also possesses many features in common with the Zan languages (Mingrelian and Laz), which are sisters to Georgian and are included in the Kartvelian language group.

Such cards are known by a variety of names including bank cards, ATM cards, MAC (money access cards), client cards, key cards or cash cards. There are a number of types of payment cards, the most common being credit cards and debit cards. Most commonly, a payment card is electronically linked to an account or accounts belonging to the cardholder. These accounts may be deposit accounts or loan or credit accounts, and the card is a means of authenticating the cardholder. However, stored- value cards store money on the card itself and are not necessarily linked to an account at a financial institution. It can also be a smart card that contains a unique card number and some security information such as an expiration date or CVVC (CVV) or with a magnetic strip on the back enabling various machines to read and access information. Depending on the issuing bank and the preferences of the client, this may allow the card to be used as an ATM card, enabling transactions at automatic teller machines; or as a debit card, linked to the client's bank account and able to be used for making purchases at the point of sale; or as a credit card attached to a revolving credit line supplied by the bank. Most payment cards, such as debit and credit cards can also function as ATM cards, although ATM-only cards are also available. Charge and proprietary cards cannot be used as ATM cards. The use of a credit card to withdraw cash at an ATM is treated differently to a POS transaction, usually attracting interest charges from the date of the cash withdrawal. Interbank networks allow the use of ATM cards at ATMs of private operators and financial institutions other than those of the institution that issued the cards. All ATM machines, at a minimum, will permit cash withdrawals of customers of the machine's owner (if a bank-operated machine) and for cards that are affiliated with any ATM network the machine is also affiliated. They will report the amount of the withdrawal and any fees charged by the machine on the receipt. Most banks and credit unions will permit routine account- related banking transactions at the bank's own ATM, including deposits, checking the balance of an account, and transferring money between accounts. Some may provide additional services, such as selling postage stamps. For other types of transactions through telephone or online banking, this may be performed with an ATM card without in-person authentication. This includes account balance inquiries, electronic bill payments, or in some cases, online purchases (see Interac Online). ATM cards can also be used on improvised ATMs such as \\"mini ATMs\\", merchants' card terminals that deliver ATM features without any cash drawer. These terminals can also be used as cashless scrip ATMs by cashing the receipts they issue at the merchant's point of sale.  History  Historically, bank cards have also served the purpose of a cheque guarantee card, a now almost defunct system to guarantee cheques at point of sale. The first bank cards were automated teller machine (ATM) cards issued by Barclays in London in 1967,Jarunee Wonglimpiyara, Strategies of Competition in the Bank Card Business (2005), p. 1-3. and by Chemical Bank in Long Island, New York, in 1969. In 1972, Lloyds Bank issued the first bank card to feature an information-encoding magnetic strip, using a personal identification number (PIN) for security. Atalla Technovation (now Utimaco Atalla) was founded by Mohamed M. Atalla in 1972 and introduced the first hardware security module (HSM) for securing card payment transactions in 1973, utilizing microprocessor technology. Atalla HSM modules remain the payment card industry's de facto standard, protecting 250million card transactions daily (more than billion transactions annually) as of 2013. The smart card, which was introduced in the 1970s, was adapted for use as a payment card. Smart payment cards were introduced to the banking sector in 1979, and came into wider use in the mid-1980s.  Card networks  In some banking networks, the two functions of ATM cards and debit cards are combined into a single card, simply called a \\"debit card\\" or also commonly a \\"bank card\\". These are able to perform banking tasks at ATMs and also make point-of-sale transactions, with both features using a PIN. Canada's Interac and Europe's Maestro are examples of networks that link bank accounts with point-of-sale equipment. Some debit card networks also started their lives as ATM card networks before evolving into full- fledged debit card networks, example of these networks are: Development Bank of Singapore (DBS)'s Network for Electronic Transfers (NETS) and Bank Central Asia (BCA)'s Debit BCA, both of them were later on adopted by other banks (with Prima Debit being the Prima interbank network version of Debit BCA).  Technical features  Payment cards are usually plastic cards, and rounded corners with a radius of 2.88‚Äì3.48 mm, in accordance with ISO/IEC 7810#ID-1 standard. They usually also have a unique embossed card number conforming with the ISO/IEC 7812 numbering standard, the cardholder‚Äôs name and the card expiry date, in addition to other security features. Types Payment cards have features in common, as well as distinguish features. Types of payment cards can be distinguished on the basis of the features of each type of card, including: =Credit card= A credit card is linked to a line of credit (usually called a credit limit) created by the issuer of the credit card for the cardholder on which the cardholder can draw (i.e. borrow), either for payment to a merchant for a purchase or as a cash advance to the cardholder. Most credit cards are issued by or through local banks or credit unions, but some non-bank financial institutions also offer cards directly to the public. The cardholder can either repay the full outstanding balance or a lesser amount by the payment due date. The amount paid cannot be less than the ‚Äùminimum payment,‚Äù either a fixed dollar amount or a percentage of the outstanding balance. Interest is charged on the portion of the balance not paid off by the due date. The rate of interest and method of calculating the charge vary between credit cards, even for different types of card issued by the same company. Many credit cards can also be used to take cash advances through ATMs, which also attract interest charges, usually calculated from the date of cash withdrawal. Some merchants charge a fee for purchases by credit card, as they will be charged a fee by the card issuer. =Debit card= Purchasing by debit card With a debit card (also known as a bank card, check card or some other description) when a cardholder makes a purchase, funds are withdrawn directly either from the cardholder's bank account, or from the remaining balance on the card, instead of the holder repaying the money at a later date. In some cases, the \\"cards\\" are designed exclusively for use on the Internet, and so there is no physical card. The use of debit cards has become widespread in many countries and has overtaken use of cheques, and in some instances cash transactions, by volume. Like credit cards, debit cards are used widely for telephone and internet purchases. Debit cards can also allow instant withdrawal of cash, acting as the ATM card, and as a cheque guarantee card. Merchants can also offer \\"cashback\\"/\\"cashout\\" facilities to customers, where a customer can withdraw cash along with their purchase. Merchants usually do not charge a fee for purchases by debit card. =Charge card= With charge cards, the cardholder is required to pay the full balance shown on the statement, which is usually issued monthly, by the payment due date. It is a form of short-term loan to cover the cardholder's purchases, from the date of the purchase and the payment due date, which may typically be up to 55 days. Interest is usually not charged on charge cards and there is usually no limit on the total amount that may be charged. If payment is not made in full, this may result in a late payment fee, the possible restriction of future transactions, and perhaps the cancellation of the card. =ATM card= An ATM card (known under a number of names) is any card that can be used in automated teller machines (ATMs) for transactions such as deposits, cash withdrawals, obtaining account information, and other types of transactions, often through interbank networks. Cards may be issued solely to access ATMs, and most debit or credit cards may also be used at ATMs, but charge and proprietary cards cannot. The use of a credit card to withdraw cash at an ATM is treated differently to an POS transaction, usually attracting interest charges from the date of the cash withdrawal. The use of a debit card usually does not attract interest. Third party ATM owners may charge a fee for the use of their ATM. =Stored-value card= With a stored-value card, a monetary value is stored on the card, and not in an externally recorded account. This differs from prepaid cards where money is on deposit with the issuer similar to a debit card. One major difference between stored value cards and prepaid debit cards is that prepaid debit cards are usually issued in the name of individual account holders, while stored-value cards are usually anonymous. The term stored-value card means that the funds and or data are physically stored on the card. With prepaid cards the data is maintained on computers controlled by the card issuer. The value stored on the card can be accessed using a magnetic stripe embedded in the card, on which the card number is encoded; using radio- frequency identification (RFID); or by entering a code number, printed on the card, into a telephone or other numeric keypad. =Fleet card= A fleet card is used as a payment card, most commonly for gasoline, diesel and other fuels at gas stations. Fleet cards can also be used to pay for vehicle maintenance and expenses, at the discretion of the fleet owner or manager. The use of a fleet card reduces the need to carry cash, thus increasing the security for fleet drivers. The elimination of cash also helps to prevent fraudulent transactions at the fleet owner's or manager's expense. Fleet cards provide convenient and comprehensive reporting, enabling fleet owners/managers to receive real time reports and set purchase controls with their cards, helping to keep them informed of all business related expenses. They may also reduce administrative work or otherwise be essential in arranging fuel taxation refunds. =Other= Other types of payment cards include: * Gift card * Digital currency * Store card Technologies A number of International Organization for Standardization standards, ISO/IEC 7810, ISO/IEC 7811, ISO/IEC 7812, ISO/IEC 7813, ISO 8583, and ISO/IEC 4909, define the physical properties of payment cards, including size, flexibility, location of the magstripe, magnetic characteristics, and data formats. They also provide the standards for financial cards, including the allocation of card number ranges to different card issuing institutions. =Embossing= Israeli manual card imprinter Originally charge account identification was paper-based. In 1959 American Express was the first charge card operator to issue embossed plastic cards which enabled cards to be manually imprinted for processing, making processing faster and reducing transcription errors. Other credit card issuers followed suit. The information typically embossed are the bank card number, card expiry date and cardholder's name. Though the imprinting method has been predominantly superseded by the magnetic stripe and then by the integrated chip, cards continue to be embossed in case a transaction needs to be processed manually. Under manual processing, cardholder verification was by the cardholder signing the payment voucher after which the merchant would check the signature against the cardholder's signature on the back of the card. Cards conform to the ISO/IEC 7810 ID-1 standard, ISO/IEC 7811 on embossing, and the ISO/IEC 7812 card numbering standard. =Magnetic stripe= An example of the reverse side of a typical debit card: Magnetic stripes started to be rolled out on debit cards in the 1970s with the introduction of ATMs. The magnetic stripe stores card data which can be read by physical contact and swiping past a reading head. The magnetic stripe contains all the information appearing on the card face, but allows for faster processing at point-of-sale than the then manual alternative as well as subsequently by the transaction processing company. When the magnetic stripe is being used, the cardholder will have been issued with a PIN, which is used for cardholder identification at the point-of-sale, and a signature is no longer required. The magnetic stripe is in the process of being augmented by the integrated chip. =Smart card= A smart card, chip card, or integrated circuit card (ICC), is any pocket-sized card with embedded integrated circuits which can process data. This implies that it can receive input which is processed ‚Äî by way of the ICC applications ‚Äî and delivered as an output. There are two broad categories of ICCs. Memory cards contain only non-volatile memory storage components, and perhaps some specific security logic. Microprocessor cards contain volatile memory and microprocessor components. The card is made of plastic, generally PVC, but sometimes ABS. The card may embed a hologram to avoid counterfeiting. Using smart cards is also a form of strong security authentication for single sign-on within large companies and organizations. EMV is the standard adopted by all major issuers of smart payment cards. =Proximity card= A proximity card Proximity card (or prox card) is a generic name for contactless integrated circuit devices used for security access or payment systems. It can refer to the older 125 kHz devices or the newer 13.56 MHz contactless RFID cards, most commonly known as contactless smartcards. Modern proximity cards are covered by the ISO/IEC 14443 (proximity card) standard. There is also a related ISO/IEC 15693 (vicinity card) standard. Proximity cards are powered by resonant energy transfer and have a range of 0‚Äì3 inches in most instances. The user will usually be able to leave the card inside a wallet or purse. The price of the cards is also low, usually US$2‚Äì$5, allowing them to be used in applications such as identification cards, keycards, payment cards and public transit fare cards. =Re- programmable magnetic stripe card= Re-programmable/dynamic magnetic stripe cards are standard sized transaction cards that include a battery, a processor, and a means (inductive coupling or otherwise) of sending a variable signal to a magnetic stripe reader. Re-programmable stripe cards are often more secure than standard magnetic stripe cards and can transmit information for multiple cardholder accounts.  Misuse  Due to increased illegal copies of cards with a magnetic stripe, the European Payments Council established a Card Fraud Prevention Task Force in 2003 that spawned a commitment to migrate all ATMs and POS applications to use a chip-and-PIN solution until the end of 2010.\\"EPC Card Fraud Prevention Forum ‚Äì Agreement on new measures to fight card fraud\\" , 19. July 2010 by C√©dric Sarazin The \\"SEPA for Cards\\"\\"SEPA for Cards\\" , the SEPA Cards Framework and EPC Cards Standardisation Programme, accessed 06. August 2010 has completely removed the magnetic stripe requirement from the former Maestro debit cards.

In √ìengus‚Äôs dream, which lasted over a year, Caer Ibormeith stood beside his bed though when he reached out for her, she would disappear. Every alternate Samhain she would turn to human form for one day, which begins at sunset, and after that, she would revert into being a swan, in which form she would remain for a year before becoming human again the following Samhain. √ìengus went in search for this girl in his dreams at the lake of the Dragon's Mouth and found 150 girls chained in pairs, his girl Caer Ibormeith, among them. √ìengus was told he could marry Caer if he could identify her in her swan form. He chose correctly and with that √ìengus turned himself into a swan and they flew away together, to the Br√∫ na B√≥inne/palace on the River Boyne near Slane, which was his long standing place of residence. The pair sang beautiful music as they went, that put all listeners throughout Ireland asleep for three days and nights.The Dream of Oengus The Celtic Literature Collective Caer would marry with √ìengus of the Tuatha de Dannan, and, amongst other things, become foster-mother of Diarmuid. The story of Fionnuala and the other children of Lir shares the motif of transformation into swans, as swans and the associated cranes (\\"gr√∫s\\") share Irish mythological reverence due to, especially in the latter case, being equally at home in flight, on land, and in water, which made it an especially magical creature able to transition to other worlds. Moreover, as the tall Crane stands upright when on land, it was associated with shape-shifting, back into human form. References * Jeffrey Gantz. 1982. Early Irish Myths and Sagas. Penguin.

Trouser Press called them \\"England's finest, most exciting punk band of the 90s\\" and The Guardian has called them \\"the greatest British punk band of the modern era.\\" History and background Formed in August 1988 by Frankie Stubbs and Dickie Hammond (also of HDQ), Leatherface released four full-length albums before their initial split in 1993. Third album Mush was, according to Allmusic, \\"one of the most intense records of the 90s, with some of the fiercest playing and song dynamics.. considered one of the best albums of the decade.\\" The band split in late 1993, ‚Äì releasing a posthumous mini album (The Last) the following year ‚Äì but reformed in 1998, after the death of bass player Andy Crighton (also of Snuff). Four more albums followed between 1999 and 2012. Leatherface's music has been described as a cross between H√ºsker D√º and Mot√∂rhead, a notable element being Stubbs' rasping, \\"gravelly\\" vocals. The lyrics often feature far-fetched similes, metaphors, word play and obscure allusions. Though never attaining much more than a cult following outside their native country, the band have been cited as an influence by higher-profile punk acts such as Hot Water Music and Dillinger Four. Rubber Factory Records released a tribute album to Leatherface in 2008, featuring 41 tracks by over 35 artists from several different countries who were influenced by the band, including Hot Water Music and The Sainte Catherines. Their cover of \\"Can't Help Falling In Love With You\\" was played in the final episode of Sons of Anarchy. Post split =Frankie Stubbs= After Leatherface split in 1993, Stubbs moved on to two new bands, Jesse and Pope. Jesse released three singles and one self-titled album between 1995 and 1998. Stubbs also performed solo and released one single in 1995 and a 10‚Äô‚Äô EP in 2001. In addition Stubbs has produced records for almost 40 other (mostly) UK bands including China Drum, Four Letter Word, Drive, Hooton 3 Car, Midway Still, Monkhouse, Snuff and Wat Tyler. Stubbs was featured on Duncan Redmonds' 2009 collaboration album Bubble and Squeak on four tracks alongside Redmonds, Loz Wong (Snuff) and Wes Wasley (Consumed, Billy No Mates) calling themselves \\"The Pissmops\\". He was referenced in Franz Nicolay's song 'Frankie Stubbs Tears'. 'Heart is Home' was among the first four VinylVideos ever produced. Frankie Stubbs is a supporter of Sunderland A.F.C. =Other members= Graeme Philliskirk & Dickie Hammond went on to form Medictation with the remaining members consisting of members from Montreal, Quebec based band The Sainte Catherine's.

Thirlestane Castle is a castle set in extensive parklands near Lauder in the Borders of Scotland. The site is aptly named Castle Hill, as it stands upon raised ground. However, the raised land is within Lauderdale, the valley of the Leader Water. The land has been in the ownership of the Maitland family since 1587, and Thirlestane served as the seat of the Earls of Lauderdale. The castle was substantially extended in the 1670s by the first and only Duke of Lauderdale. Further additions were made in the 19th century. The castle is now cared for by a charitable trust, and is open to the public. History of the castle Before the 13th century, a large fort or castle was built on Castle Hill near the Leader Water. It was the site of the ancient church of Lauder, where in 1482, James III's favourites, including the architect Robert Cochrane, were dragged by envious nobles led by Archibald Douglas, 5th Earl of Angus and hanged from the (earlier) Lauder Bridge. The sites of the ancient kirk and the bridge from which Cochrane and his colleagues met their demise, are now within the immediate policies of Thirlestane Castle, the church some 60 yards from the west front, and the bridge some quarter-mile to the north-east.RCAHMS Canmore-accessed 29 July 2013 This castle passed to Robert Lauder of that Ilk, who gave it in dowry to his daughter Alison and her husband George Wedderhede in 1532.The Register of the Great Seal of Scotland (Edinburgh, 1883), p. 258 no. 1186, 1 July 1532, The King confirmed upon George Wedderhede and Alison Lauder his spouse the lands of Castle Hill near the parish church (prope ecclesiam) of Lauder in the Lordship of Lauderdale, Berwickshire, to be held of them and their legitimate heirs male procreated of their bodies: See The Grange of the St Giles for site of Castle Hill. This couple, and their son, were all murdered in feuds, Alison in 1547. Presumably the lands reverted to her parents, her mother being Alison Cranstoun. They both died in the second half of 1567 leaving only young grandchildren as heirs. During the war with England called the 'Rough Wooings' the site had been occupied by a large English artillery fort and garrison.Marcus Merriman in Howard Colvin ed., The History of The King's Works, vol. 4 (1982): Marcus Merriman, The Rough Wooings(Tuckwell, 2000), pp. 314-5. Following the design by Thomas Pettit, Surveyor of Calais, the fort was begun on 5 April 1548 by Sir Robert Bowes and was estimated to cost ¬£296 and take four weeks to complete.Joseph Bain, Calendar State Papers Scotland: 1547-1562, vol. 1 (London, 1898), pp. 77-8, 106, 108-9. Hugh Willoughby was its captain.G. R. Batho, ed., HMC Talbot Papers (London, 1971), pp. 27-8. The Cranstouns sold Castle Hill on 27 January 1587 to Sir John Maitland (d. 1595).The Register of the Great Seal of Scotland By the 22 March 1587, Maitland was \\"busily occupied with his masons at the building of his house in the Fort of Lauder.\\"HMC Salisbury Hatfield, vol. 3 (London, 1889), p. 237. =The Maitland family= Maitland's original peel tower (Old Thirlestane Castle The Maitlands came to Britain from Normandy with William the Conqueror in 1066, originally settling in Northumberland. They gained power and influence as a result of military service but largely due to their contributions to law and the arts in the 16th century. William Maitland of Lethington, was Secretary to Mary, Queen of Scots, his younger brother was Sir John Maitland, Secretary of Scotland, who acquired Thirlestane in 1587. In the same year he built a large square keep or tower house upon the foundations and walls of the original fort. In 1590, Sir John was appointed Lord Chancellor of Scotland, and was ennobled as Lord Maitland of Thirlestane. This new house near Lauder was to replace the Maitland's original but now decaying (Old) Thirlestane Castle, a peel tower situated a mile or so to the south-east, the ruins of which are still extant near the hamlet of Thirlestane. James VI of Scotland visited several times. He came in February 1591 to celebrate the wedding of John Maitland's niece to the Laird of Lugton.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 10 (Edinburgh, 1936), p. 467. He stayed again in October 1593.Annie I. Cameron, Calendar State Papers Scotland: 1593-1595, vol. 11 (Edinburgh, 1936), pp. 194, 201, 208-9. After John Maitland's death on 3 October 1595, his widow Jean Fleming married the Earl of Cassilis and on 22 February 1599 Fleming and Cassilis hosted James VI at the castle.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 13 part 2 (Edinburgh, 1969), p. 627. Lord Maitland's son John Maitland was created the 1st Earl of Lauderdale in 1624. His son was John Maitland, Duke of Lauderdale (1616‚Äì1682), one of the most important Scottish figures of the late 17th century, being appointed Secretary of State for Scotland in 1660, a position carrying unrivalled power and influence. He employed the architect Sir William Bruce to transform the castle into a residence suitable for conducting the affairs of state. Between 1670 and 1676 the substantial alterations included the addition of the two front towers and the grand staircase, in addition to extensive internal modifications creating lavish staterooms with magnificent plasterwork ceilings. Lauderdale had Bruce retain much of the castle's earlier fabric giving it an external aura of antiquity, while the interiors met the highest fashion in seventeenth century planning and furnishing. This allowed Lauderdale to revere the antiquity of his family residence at the same time as living in high contemporary fashion.C. Wemyss, \\"The Art of Retrospection and the Country Houses of Post-Restoration Scotland\\", Architectural Heritage XXVI (2015), p. 26. By the 19th century, in more peaceful times, the castle took on the role of a Scottish country mansion for the Earls of Lauderdale. In 1840 the Edinburgh architects David Bryce and William Burn were engaged to design extensions to the castle. Their additions consist of two large wings flanking the central keep and a south wing, constructed around a central courtyard, housing new kitchens, pantries, laundries and servants' quarters. During World Two the castle was home to St. Hilary's a girl's school evacuated from Edinburgh. The 15th Earl and Countess of Lauderdale lived in the north wing of the castle, while the school used the rest. The dorms were on the upper floors, while the main rooms were classrooms. The great dining room was used as the school dining room and assembly hall. St. Hilary's remained at Thirlestane until the end of 1944 when they returned to Edinburgh. The castle today Thirlestane Castle gardens. Captain Gerald Maitland-Carew inherited the castle in 1972 from his maternal grandmother, Ethel, Countess of Lauderdale, wife of the 15th Earl. At this time, the castle was in a serious state of disrepair, requiring extensive renovation. In 1984 the castle was given to a charitable trust established to ensure its preservation, and major repairs were carried out, assisted by financial grants awarded by the Historic Buildings Council and the National Heritage Memorial Fund. In addition to the grounds, the castle itself and its interiors, Thirlestane is noted for fine collections of paintings, furniture, porcelain and an historic toy collection. In 2016 the castle is open to visitors from 3 May until 2 October (Tuesday to Thursday and Sundays).

She escaped in May, shortly before her trial, but was recaptured by a group of Arabs. On 6 June 1946, she was sentenced to seven years imprisonment (nineteen years according to Encyclopaedia Judaica) after being charged with being in possession of a wireless transmitter, four pistols and revolvers and ammunition. During sentencing she sang \\"Hatikvah\\" and was accompanied by 30 members of her family.\\"Girl Zionist Sentenced,\\" page 11, The New York Times, 7 June 1946. She was imprisoned in Bethlehem, but escaped from jail in 1947. She was also editor of the Lehi newspaper Youth Front. After Israeli independence in 1948, she contributed to Sulam, a monthly magazine published by former Lehi leader Israel Eldad. Cohen married former Lehi comrade Emanuel Hanegbi. From 1961 to 1973, she wrote for the Israeli newspaper Maariv and served on its editorial board. While working as a journalist, she came to New York to visit the Lubavitcher Rebbe, Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson. Schneerson encouraged her to get involved with Israeli youth. Cohen died on 18 December 2019, one week before her 94th birthday. Political career In 1972, Cohen joined Menachem Begin's Herut party, then part of the Gahal alliance, and was elected to the Knesset the following year, by which time Gahal had become Likud. She was re- elected in 1977. As an opponent of the Camp David Accords and the return of Sinai to Egypt as a land-for-peace deal, even to the extent of being thrown out of the Knesset when Begin presented the deal to it, Cohen and Moshe Shamir left Likud in 1979 to found a new right-wing party Banai, later Tehiya-Bnai, and then Tehiya. The new party was a strong supporter of Gush Emunim and included prominent members of Israeli settlements in the West Bank and Gaza such as Hanan Porat and Elyakim Haetzni. Cohen retained her seat in the 1981 elections, and despite their previous differences, Tehiya joined Begin's coalition. She retained her seat during the elections in 1984 and 1988, and in June 1990, following a coalition crisis, was appointed to the cabinet as Deputy Minister of Science and Technology. Cohen lost her seat in the 1992 elections. That year, she rejoined Likud and remained active in right-wing politics. Her son, Tzachi Hanegbi, served as a Knesset member for Likud. Views and opinions Cohen opposed territorial concessions. She was a vocal critic of the Camp David Accords in 1978 and of Israel's unilateral disengagement plan from Gaza in 2005. She described herself as a \\"woman of violence\\" in the pursuit of political ends. Awards and recognition * In 2003, Cohen was awarded the Israel Prize for her lifetime achievements and special contribution to society and the State of Israel. * In 2007, she received the Yakir Yerushalayim (Worthy Citizen of Jerusalem) award from the city of Jerusalem.

Justitium (derived from the Latin term Juris statio) is a concept of Roman law, equivalent to the declaration of the state of emergency. Some scholars also refer to it as a state of exception, stemming from a state of necessity. It involved the suspension of civil business, typically including the courts, the treasury and the senate and was ordered by the Roman higher magistrates. It was usually declared following a sovereign's death, during the troubled period of interregnum, but also in case of invasions. However, in this last case, it was not as much the physical danger of invasion that justified the instauration of a state of exception, as the consequences that the news of the invasion had in Rome - for example, justitium was proclaimed at the news of Hannibal's attacks. The earliest recorded occasion of Justitium being invoked was for the same reason, when in 465 BC panic gripped the city due to a mistaken belief of imminent invasion by the Aequi. According to Giorgio Agamben, justitium progressively came to mean, after the Roman Republic, the public mourning of the sovereign: a sort of privatization or diversion of the danger threatening the polis, as the sovereign claimed for himself the auctoritas, or authority, necessary to the rule of law. In his conceptualization, it is a period where the law is indefinitely suspended without being abrogated for the purpose of generating an \\"anomic space in which what is at stake is a force of law without law\\".

In section it is sub-rectangular, with a minimum thickness of 2.4 metres, rising to a tapered top about 4.7 metres high. Excavation has shown that a further 1.2 metres is buried in the ground. It is 77.4 metres from the centre of Stonehenge circle. It leans towards the southwest nearly 27 degrees from the vertical. The stone has an overall girth of 7.6 metres and weighs about 35 tons. It is surrounded by the Heelstone Ditch. Myths and legends of the Devil striking a \\"Friar's Heel\\" with a stone resulted in its eccentric name, Heel Stone. Some claim \\"Friar's Heel\\" is a corruption of \\"Freyja's He-ol\\" or \\"Freyja Sul\\", from the Nordic goddess Freyja and (allegedly) the Welsh words for \\"way\\" and \\"Sunday\\" respectively. It is doubtful whether any prehistoric standing stone has experienced as many name changes and interpretations. Only in the past three decades have scientists used the name Heel Stone consistently.

He was also mayor of Tel Aviv from 1993 to 1998. Political career Milo started his political activity during his student days, when he was Chairman of the Israeli Student Union. After graduating from Tel Aviv University with a law degree, he moved into politics with the Herut faction of Likud, and was Chairman of the party's Information Department. Elected to the ninth Knesset in 1977 as a Likud MK, Milo was the country's first ever Minister of the Environment in Yitzhak Shamir's government in 1988, before becoming Minister of Labor and Social Welfare in 1990, though he switched to Minister of Police in a cabinet reshuffle later in the year.

The principal areas of concern are the provision, in a form conveniently readable to humans or machines, of information and statistics about: * individual legislators * particular legislative proposals * votes thereon * text of legislation Parliamentary informatics is carried on both by officials of legislatures and by private for-profit and non-profit actors, with motivations ranging from the administration of parliaments to lobbying and facilitating democratic discourse. The division of activities between official and unofficial activity differs widely between polities, even within a single country. There exists substantial overlap with disciplines such as psephology and, as far as the text of successfully enacted legislation is concerned, legal informatics in general. The use of parliamentary informatics is also a rapidly growing trend in parliamentary monitoring. In a September 2011, joint report from the National Democratic Institute and World Bank Institute, a survey of parliamentary monitoring organisations (PMOs) found that parliamentary informatics are used by approximately 40 percent of PMOs worldwide. The report states, \\"These tools can automatically aggregate and organize information from parliamentary websites and other information sources, generate visualizations (such as political finance maps), and create new platforms for citizens to interact with MPs or participate in parliamentary monitoring and policy analysis.\\" Strengthening Parliamentary Accountability, Citizen Engagement and Access to Information: A Global Survey of Parliamentary Monitoring Organizations, National Democratic Institute and World Bank Institute. Accessed 14 October 2011.  Issues  Access to parliamentary information is the most significant issue in parliamentary informatics; access may be inhibited technologically through the provision of parliamentary information in a form not amenable to processing by machines, or legally, by copyright or other protection of the parliamentary record. Ultimately, it may be possible to provide citizens with a comprehensive overview of all the legislation going through parliaments everywhere in the world, which would allow the tracking of the implementation of international treaties and of general legislative trends. In a September 2011 report from the National Democratic Institute and World Bank Institute on parliamentary monitoring organisations, open data is cited as a fundamental issue for further development. The report explains, \\"While they have proven effective in many instances, the most useful informatics tools require the availability of parliamentary data in machine- readable or \\"open data\\" formats, which remains a challenge in many contexts.\\"Ibid.

Note the portable VHF/UHF satellite and HF antennas in the background Rugged HF transceiver for voice communications In times of crisis and natural disasters, amateur radio is often used as a means of emergency communication when wireline, cell phones and other conventional means of communications fail. Unlike commercial systems, Amateur radio is usually independent of terrestrial facilities that can fail. It is dispersed throughout a community without \\"choke points\\" such as cellular telephone sites that can be overloaded. Amateur radio operators are experienced in improvising antennas and power sources and most equipment today can be powered by an automobile battery. Annual \\"Field Days\\" are held in many countries to practice these emergency improvisational skills. Amateur radio operators can use hundreds of frequencies and can quickly establish networks tying disparate agencies together to enhance interoperability. Recent examples include the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center in Manhattan in 2001, the 2003 North America blackout and Hurricane Katrina in September 2005, where amateur radio was used to coordinate disaster relief activities when other systems failed. In 2017, the Red Cross requested 50 amateur radio operators be dispatched to Puerto Rico to provide communications services in the wake of Hurricane Maria. On September 2, 2004, ham radio was used to inform weather forecasters with information on Hurricane Frances live from the Bahamas. On December 26, 2004, an earthquake and resulting tsunami across the Indian Ocean wiped out all communications with the Andaman Islands, except for a DX-pedition that provided a means to coordinate relief efforts. Recently, Amateur Radio operators in the People's Republic of China provided emergency communications after the 2008 Sichuan earthquake and U.S. hams did similar work following Hurricane Ike. Amateur radio operators provided communications in the aftermath of the Boston Marathon bombing when cellphone systems became overloaded. The largest disaster response by U.S. amateur radio operators was during Hurricane Katrina which first made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane went through Miami, Florida on August 25, 2005, eventually strengthening to Category 5. More than a thousand ham operators from all over the U.S. converged on the Gulf Coast in an effort to provide emergency communications assistance. Subsequent Congressional hearings highlighted the Amateur Radio response as one of the few examples of what went right in the disaster relief effort. Organization While all hams have some emergency communications capability, those who are particularly interested in the public service aspects of the hobby usually affiliate with an organized group for disaster specific training, quick mobilization and to practice emergency skills. These major organizations include: =International= The Global Amateur Radio Emergency Communications Conference (GAREC) is held in a new location yearly by the International Amateur Radio Union (IARU), hosting discussion and coordination of large-scale and cross-border amateur radio emergency response. =Australia= In Australia, the Wireless Institute Civil Emergency Network (WICEN) operates in each state & territory as an autonomous body under the relevant disaster plan. =Austria= In Austria, Amateur Radio Emergency Network Austria (ARENA) - The Amateur Radio Emergency Network Austria is a national voluntary service that is provided to the community by licensed radio amateurs.

Many of our members are volunteers in organizations such as the Austrian Red Cross, Civil Defense, fire brigades, military and related institutions. Unique EmComm support is provided by use of the HF, VHF and UHF frequency spectrums and many operating modes for voice and data communications. Besides usual point-to-point communications, we rely on repeaters, international networks such as Winlink, Echolink, APRS and HAMNET. For instance, one of the 5 mirror- redundant Winlink common message servers is located in Vienna.

Besides coordinating emergency communication, MARES also conducting classes and other common radio amateur activities such competition, fox hunting, flea market, eye-ball meet etc. = Netherlands = The Dutch Amateur Radio Emergency Service (DARES) was founded in 2003 as a result of the World Radio Conference 2003, where it was decided that licensed Dutch radio amateurs were allowed to offer their services to third parties when there is an emergency. DARES is recognized by the State Department of The Netherlands and supported by the two largest national radio amateur organisations: VERON and VRZA. DARES consists of a group of radio amateurs and shortwave listeners who offer their knowledge and radio equipment during a disaster or major incident. The organisation is built upon the 25 safety regions defined by Dutch authorities. DARES has been represented at the Global Amateur Radio Emergency Communications Conference (GAREC) since 2005. =New Zealand= In New Zealand the New Zealand Association of Radio Transmitters provides the AREC - Amateur Radio Emergency Communications (formerly Amateur Radio Emergency Corps) in the role. They won the New Zealand National Search and Rescue award in 2001 for their long commitment to Search and Rescue in NZ. =Spain= In Spain, REMER (Red Radio de Emergencia, Emergency Radio Network) is a national HF/VHF network formed by volunteer ham radio operators, and it is co-ordinated by the local Civil defense groups, which are dependent from the local government authority. It was founded on 1982. =Russia= The volunteer organization called RAS formed in 1988, and at the end of 2012, the Union of Russian Radio amateurs established a committee dedicated to emergency communications and even entered into an agreement with MChS, Emergency Situations Ministry. =Trinidad and Tobago= In Trinidad and Tobago, The Trinidad and Tobago Amateur Radio Society (T.T.A.R.S), the officially recognized body for amateur radio in Trinidad and Tobago, manages the emergency communications arm of the group often referred to as EmComms. EmComms have, in the past, not only been active in Trinidad and Tobago, but throughout the Caribbean. The Office of Disaster Preparedness Management (ODPM) is actively involved in amateur radio and maintains an active amateur radio station and five repeaters. =United Kingdom= In the United Kingdom Radio Amateurs Emergency Network (RAYNET) provides the organizational backbone of their amateur radio emergency communications groups along with the Radio Society of Great Britain (RSGB). It was formed in 1953 in the aftermath of the North Sea flood of that year. =United States of America= In the United States, there are two major methods of organizing amateur radio emergency communications: the Amateur Radio Emergency Service (ARES), an organization of amateur operators sponsored by the American Radio Relay League (ARRL); and the Radio Amateur Civil Emergency Service (RACES), a standby replacement radio service regulated by the Federal Communications Commission. Operations under the RACES rules requires preregistration with a local civil defense organization, to allow continued operation under Part 97.407¬ß97.407 Radio amateur civil emergency service of the FCC regulations in the event the Amateur Radio Service is ever shut down by presidential order. Thus ARES and RACES involvement within the same area are usually intertwined, with many governments requiring membership and service in that locale's ARES organization to allow operations within the Amateur Radio Service as well. Many government Emergency Operations Centers, Red Cross Chapters and National Weather Service facilities have permanent Amateur Radio stations installed for such operations. The ARRL provides extensive documentation on how to conduct emergency radio communications, including its Public Service Communications Manual. Radio clubs independent of the ARRL and ARES also participate in emergency communications activities in some areas, and some non-radio organizations have their own amateur arm. The Department of Defense sponsors the Military Auxiliary Radio System (MARS) program which utilizes Amateur Radio operators for emergency communication using military radio frequencies. The National Weather Service Skywarn weather-spotter program has a strong amateur radio contingent. And amateurs dedicated to the Salvation Army are organized under their Salvation Army Team Emergency Radio Network program. Emergency communications and disaster assistance is usually done in conjunction with volunteer disaster relief organizations such as the American Red Cross, the Salvation Army, local government emergency management agencies, as well as volunteer fire departments and ambulance corps. The ARRL has memoranda of understanding with numerous agencies expected to receive services,ARRL: Understanding our Memoranda of Understanding including the American Red Cross and Salvation Army and is a partner in the Citizen Corps program of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). The ARRL also is a member of the National Voluntary Organizations Active in Disaster (NVOAD) and conducts emergency communications certification courses for interested Amateur Radio operators.ARRL: Continuing Education Course Catalog See also * Emergency communication system References  External links  * ARRL Backgrounder: Amateur Radio Emergency Communication * Navy-Marine Corps MARS with links to Air Force and Army programs * IARU-R1 Emcom Category:Emergency communication ","title":"Amateur radio emergency communications"},{"id":"3687758","text":"An Urban settlement is a concentrated settlement that constitutes or is part of an urban area.

Nolon, The Law of Sustainable Development: Keeping Pace, 30 1246, 1298 n.93 (2010). In property law, it is a justification for assigning property rights to landowners over resources found on their own land.W.M. Rockel, Game ‚Äî Hunting Rights ‚Äî Poaching, 57 425, 426 (1908). Traditionally, the doctrine of ratione soli provides landowners \\"constructive possession of natural resources on, over, and under the surface: cujus est solum, ejus est usque ad coelum ad infernos.\\"John R. Nolon, The Law of Sustainable Development: Keeping Pace, 30 1246, 1298 (2010). Origins In ancient Roman law, landowners could only take legal possession of animals by capturing and maintaining physical control over them. 2.1.12 (North-Holland ed., J A C Thomas trans. (1975); see also J. M. Kelley, Implications of A Montana Voter Initiative That Reduces Chronic Wasting Disease Risk, Bans Canned Shooting, & Protects A Public Trust, 6 89, 109 n.21 (2001) (discussing the historical evolution of the doctrine of ratione soli). English common law originally restricted the right to hunt animals to those who had permission from the Crown, but later laws allowed landowners to hunt animals that entered upon their land through the principle of ratione soli.15 , Game 2d ed. 406-65 (1931); 1 , Animals 2d ed. 529-616 (1931). Over time, this developed into a system of laws where the right to hunt was restricted to nobles and the landowning elite.J. M. Kelley, Implications of A Montana Voter Initiative That Reduces Chronic Wasting Disease Risk, Bans Canned Shooting, & Protects A Public Trust, 6 89, 109 n.21 (2001). Modern usage The doctrine of ratione soli has survived in many jurisdictions to this day.See, e.g., Curran v. Jones, 163 La. 579, 581-82, 112 So. 492, 493 (1927) (recognizing the doctrine of \\"rationae soli\\"); State v. Long, 98 Wash. App. 669, 675, 991 P.2d 102, 106 (2000) (holding that a landowner \\"has a limited right in the wild game on his property to exclude all other persons from his . . . property for the purpose of hunting\\" (internal citations and quotations omitted)); cf. Pierson v. Post, 3 Cai. R. 175, 2 Am. Dec. 264[1] (N.Y. 1805). Likewise, many jurisdictions still recognize the correlative ad coelum doctrine. India, for example, \\"views groundwater as chattel connected to the land, and allows the landowner ownership rights based on the ad coleum principle.\\"Daniel Aguilar, Groundwater Reform in India: An Equity & Sustainability Dilemma, 46 623, 630 (2011) (italics added). However, some commentators note that some American jurisdictions have rejected the application of ratione soli to the ownership of wild animals because \\"it smacks of the hunting rights of the English landowning families who used it to make meatless meals for and poachers out of England's yeoman.\\"Burke, (2d ed.) at p. 27. For example, the Colorado Supreme Court stated in 1981 that \\"a landowner's property ration soli is subject to 'lawful regulation.'\\"Collopy v.

The Act provides that charges of capital murder at the time it was passed were to be treated as charges of simple murder and all sentences of death were to be commuted to sentences of life imprisonment.

It consists of a brief speed-up in heart rate, followed by a slow decrease back to the baseline rate. An important feature of HRT is that PVCs occur naturally in most adults, so measuring the characteristics of a given person's HRT offers a noninvasive way to evaluate his or her cardiac function without applying artificial external stimuli. The measured values of HRT parameters have been shown to be a statistically significant predictor of the probability of dying from cardiac disease after a patient suffers a myocardial infarction. HRT can also be used to predict death in patients with congestive heart failure from a lethal arrhythmia. HRT has nothing to do with turbulence in fluid dynamics.  History  The concept of HRT was introduced to the medical community by Georg Schmidt and colleagues from the Technical University of Munich in 1999 in the British medical journal the Lancet. While studying PVC characteristics, Schmidt and his colleagues had noticed that heart rate seemed to speed up after a PVC. To get a clearer picture, they listed the time from one heartbeat's R-wave to the next R-wave (called RR intervals) and synchronized these lists to the time of the PVC beat and averaged the values in the list. A plot of this averaged RR interval list (called a PVC tachogram) not only confirmed their observation that heart rate sped up for a few beats after a PVC, but highlighted another less obvious feature, that heart rate then slows down beyond what it was before the PVC, before returning to the original heart rate. Schmidt et al. reasoned that just as loss of variability in heart rate indicated patients more likely to be at high risk of dying after a heart attack, this phenomenon might also be an indicator of a healthy control of heart rate in such patients. They proceeded to test this hypothesis using 24-hour electrocardiogram (Holter monitor) recordings from one hundred survivors of heart attacks with frequent PVCs. Greater turbulence seemed correlated with better prognosis. They then used this data to determine the optimal discriminating threshold between normal and abnormal HRT values, and came up with the values TS=2.5, TO=0%. Now came the test. These thresholds were applied to Holter records from a total of 1191 patients who had experienced a heart attack. There were 162 deaths (13.6%) during the follow-up period of about two years. Patients with abnormal HRTs were approximately three-times more likely to die than those with normal HRTs, beating out some other commonly used predictors.  Mechanism of HRT  HRT is widely considered to be a baroreflex phenomenon. That is, a PVC interrupts the normal cardiac cycle, so the ventricles of the heart have not had time to fill up to their normal level, before contracting and pumping their contents out. This results in a pulse (blood pressure) weaker than expected and triggers normal homeostatic mechanisms that try to compensate by constricting arteries and increasing heart rate (the turbulence onset part of HRT). This is accomplished by the brain reflexively withdrawing the parasympathetic nerve signals and increasing the sympathetic nerve signals it sends to the heart. The compensatory constriction of the arteries and increased heart rate frequently cause blood pressure to overshoot normal values (overcompensates), and activate the baroreflex in reverse. This time, the brain reinstates parasympathetic nerve signals and decreases sympathetic nerve signals, which cause the heart rate to slow (the turbulence slope part of HRT). The exact quantitative contribution of the parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous flow to the heart to HRT is unknown. The simplistic view assumes that HRT is solely dependent upon parasympathetic activity because atropine, a parasympathetic activity blocker abolishes HRT while a beta-blocker (sympathetic blocker) has no effect on HRT. The contribution of the compensatory pause, the pause between the PVC and the next normal beat, to HRT is also unknown. Whether the single beat blood pressure increase after a compensatory pause occurs in both normal and compromised hearts as well is at present uncertain. To date, no physiological parameter has been linked in a quantitative manner to turbulence slope, whereas turbulence onset was shown by researchers in Calgary, Canada, to be linearly dependent upon duration of subnormal blood pressure in a well designed experiment. The reason the size of HRT after a PVC predicts cardiac death is suggested by its mechanism. Parasympathetic nervous activity to the heart is believed to be protective and sympathetic nervous activity, deleterious, to the heart. Especially after a heart attack, sympathetic nervous activity tends to be increased. A healthy HRT indicates the presence of a healthy amount of parasympathetic activity, countering sympathetic activity. To take a wider view, however, it may be that a healthy HRT is also an indication of a healthy brain, and is the reason small HRT also predicts a likelihood of death from non- cardiac causes as well as from cardiac causes.

It is situated 2.5 miles northeast of Coleshill (the nearest town), 7.5 miles southwest of Atherstone and 12.5 miles east-northeast of Birmingham.  History  Shustoke is an ancient village and it existed before Domesday. In 1086 Shustoke was recorded as 'Scotescote' meaning Scots Cottage, as cote means cottage, dwelling or house. The parish church is St Cuthbert's and was erected in 1307 on the site of an earlier church or chapel. Some remains of a Celtic-type churchyard cross and reused Norman masonry can be seen. The parish registers are some of the earliest in the country and date from the reign of Henry VIII. Some are in the handwriting of the scholar and antiquary Sir William Dugdale. Dugdale was born in the building now known as 'The Old Rectory' in Shawbury Lane on 12 September 1605, is widely regarded as the county's first and greatest antiquarian. He built and lived in Blyth Hall and was a strong royalist supporter of King Charles I during the Civil War, being appointed as his 'Garter Principal King of Arms'. On 10 May 1660 at Coleshill he read out the proclamation announcing that Charles' son Charles II was now the King of England. Dugdale's descendants later bought land near Atherstone (the site of the former Merevale Abbey) where they built Merevale Hall. Many of the artefacts of Sir William Dugdale can be seen here , including his ceremonial tabard as Garter Principal King of Arms clothes. During the English Civil War Shustoke is listed among the towns paying arrears to the garrison at Tamworth in an account drawn up by Captain Thomas Layfield for the period from 1 November 1645 to 1 May 1646. At a weekly rate of ¬£7.5 the total arrears amounted to ¬£108.10. (SP 28/136/31) There are many interesting buildings in the parish. Some around the church are typical Arden timber-framing with brick in-fill, dating from the 17th century. Others are the Alms Houses, the moated Shustoke Hall, and a Tithe Barn at the nearby hamlet of Church End. Joseph Harrison, the early seventeenth-century vicar of Shustoke, appears to have enjoyed some notoriety as a drunkard. The justices of the Warwick quarter sessions at Easter, 1635 record that the late vicar was \\"a man of very lewd condition, much subject to drunkenness\\" and ruled that William Bull, his father-in-law, was to be responsible for supporting his surviving wife and child. (Quarter Sessions Order Book, Vol. I, p. 210). Reservoir In the 1870s, the area around Shustoke, Nether Whitacre, and Whitacre Heath became important in the storage and distribution of drinking water. Shustoke Reservoir was constructed to store water from the River Bourne and at Whitacre a pumping station and further reservoir and treatment works were built. Total storage capacity is 460,000,000 gallons. These were originally the responsibility of the Birmingham Corporation Water Department, and were the city's main supply until the demands of the growing population led to the construction of newer larger reservoirs in mid-Wales. Since the completion of the Elan Valley scheme in 1904, the Shustoke reservoir has supplied demand from Coventry, Nuneaton and surrounding area. It is now operated by Severn Trent Water. The reservoir is a popular leisure site for sailing and walking. Village The Griffin, a pub in Shustoke, was featured in the 2010 BBC programme Oz and Hugh Raise the Bar. During the series, Oz Clarke and Hugh Dennis travelled around the UK collecting the best British drinks before selling the drinks at The Griffin.Oz and Hugh Raise the Bar at allgatesbrewery.co.uk It also lies on the Heart of England Way.

Similarly to the alto bassoon, also called octave bassoon, it is relatively rare. Nomenclature Many debates have been had on the nomenclature of the smaller bassoons. All small bassoons have at one time or another been called fagottino (pl. fagottini), but this term is historically usually only applied to the octave bassoon. The terms quart- bassoon (Quartfagott) and quint-bassoon (Quintfagott) are applied respectively to the instruments pitched a fourth above and a fifth above the normal bassoon. To add to the confusion, these terms can also be applied to instruments a fifth lower (quint-bassoon in F) and a fourth lower (quart- bassoon in G) known as semi-contrabassoons. Note that the keys of the lower and higher versions are reversed. Often the terms bass and tenor or high are added to clarify which instrument one is talking about, e.g. quart-bass bassoon or high quint-bassoon (Hochquintfagott). One of the most common terms used to describe these instruments is the term tenoroon which is a contraction of \\"tenor bassoon\\", which is the more correct title of the instrument although tenoroon is quite accepted nowadays. Altoon (the combination of the words alto and bassoon), as a moniker for the smaller octave bassoon has yet to catch on. A recently introduced alternative is the fagonello which is of similar size and weight to these smaller bassoons, but plays at the normal pitch, albeit with a slightly reduced range. History First Heckel-system tenoroon by Guntram Wolf, 1989 During the Renaissance, instruments were made in every size available, from sopranos, sopraninos, and garkleins down to bass, great bass, and contrabass. The bassoon (or more properly in this era, the dulcian or curtal) was to be found in at least six sizes. The larger sizes, the bass and the great bass, were more popular, but the smaller sizes were still used, being found in several of Heinrich Sch√ºtz's motets; they were also quite popular in Spain, where they were known as \\"bajoncillos\\". Smaller bassoons appeared throughout the later Baroque and Classical eras, although their exact use is somewhat clouded. It is true that virtually no literature exists for the smaller bassoons. A notable exception is a partita by Johann Kaspar Frost (not Trost, as sometimes listed) which is scored for two octave bassoons, two tenor bassoons, two bassoons, and two horns. It seems that this was exactly the situation during the nineteenth century. Such notable names as Carl Almenr√§der advocated the use of the smaller bassoons for teaching purposes and it is said that Jancourt would often perform solos on one during recitals. Hector Berlioz lamented its non-use in his Treatise on Instrumentation and even specified that his perfect orchestra would contain five tenor bassoons (though he never wrote for the instrument himself). In the late nineteenth century, several improved models of tenor bassoon were unveiled in Paris, but were not very well received, as the real need at the time was a working contrabassoon (and not the sarrusophone that was currently in use). But the tenor bassoon was eventually used, despite its obscurity. After an absence of about one hundred years, the tenor bassoon made its comeback in 1989 when Guntram Wolf of Kronach made the first modern, Heckel system tenor bassoon. Since that reintroduction the tenor bassoon has flourished, being used as a children's instrument in Germany (and in locales all over the world) and is being looked at by professionals as a serious instrument worthy of use. Manufacturers In many regards the smaller bassoons play much like the full-size bassoon. Currently there are three sizes available from four different makers. Moosmann makes an instrument in F (a fourth higher than the normal bassoon) with simplified fingerings that descends only to low C and is intended for young children. The company Bassetto in Switzerland produces instruments in G (a fifth higher) and has an added bonus of a model with an altissimo vent in the bocal, but no whisper key. Bruno Salenson in N√Æmes in France is producing a 'petit basson' in E flat with simplified French or German keywork, specifically for children. Howarth of London markets instruments designed and manufactured by Guntram Wolf both in F and in G (respectively called by the company \\"tenoroon\\" and \\"mini-bassoon\\"). Guntram Wolf makes and sells his own F and G models, plus an octave bassoon one full octave higher than the normal bassoon. He also offers all three instruments with extra keywork for professional players: the F and G instruments having a full whisper key mechanism and F‚ÄìF link; and the octave bassoon (called \\"Fagottino\\" by Wolf) can have up to nine keys, adding a wing speaker key, and C, B, F, and low E keys to the basic children's model. By far the most used of these would appear to be the Wolf instruments: the model in G or quint-bassoon is marketed more toward children as its slightly smaller size suits them better, while the F or quart-bassoon is more suited to older children or professionals due to its slightly bigger size as well as its feeling and sounding more like a full-sized bassoon, although in its basic children's model it has limited professional use due to the lack of full modern keywork and indeed some professional players using this instrument have opted to have alternative F and G keys added to Wolf's professional instrument (standard features on the regular bassoon) to facilitate the playing of more advanced music. Octave bassoon Instruments pitched an octave above the bassoon are, like all smaller bassoons, historically quite old instruments. Virtually no literature exists for this size of bassoon other than a partita by Frost (or Trost?) and a cantata by Zachau (which specifies \\"Bassonetti\\" which would appear to be small bassoons). The instrument has enjoyed something of a revival in the past decade. Once again both historically accurate copies and modern instruments are being constructed. The modern instruments are very simple in their fingering, needing only four keys (although as many of nine or more can be had), considerably fewer keys than the original bassoon. The instrument is not, however, fully chromatic. It lacks the bottom B and C, which is akin to Baroque and Classical instruments. This instrument is not a remedy for high notes on the bassoon nor can it extend the range considerably. The octave bassoon can generally only reach the written F above the bass clef (but sounding an octave higher) although professionals may be able to extend this range. The sound is thin and would not be out of place in a Renaissance or Baroque wind ensemble. Due to the somewhat smaller size and abundance of cross-fingerings, technique on the octave bassoon may be somewhat challenging for a non-professional. Tenor bassoons The tenor bassoon is a historically very old instrument evolved from the tenor dulcian or curtal. There is virtually no literature for the instrument aside from a few pieces written in the late Baroque by relatively obscure composers (namely a work by Frost). An old theory that the exposed English horn part in Rossini's overture to his opera William Tell as originally written for the tenor bassoon (due to its being written in old Italian notation in bass clef) has now been widely debunked. There are also many names by which the instrument is known: tenoroon (a contraction of tenor bassoon), quart- and quint-bassoon (the former for the instrument in F and the latter for the one in G), fagottino, and mini-bassoon. Tenor bassoons have been made in many various keys: D, E, F, and G. Only the E, F and G instruments are currently available. Many times these smaller instruments are used for young children to begin on, as the normal sized bassoon would be far too large for anyone under about the age of 10. Naturally due to the smaller size of the instrument the tone is much lighter and reedier than that of the bassoon. The instruments are remarkably quick in response and with some practice one could have faster technique on the tenor bassoon. Most tenor bassoons have a somewhat simplified fingering system with most of the alternate keys on the butt joint removed for space reasons. A light and narrow bassoon reed is preferred on the tenor bassoon so that a wholly different reed is not needed. However a shorter and narrower reed will tend to favor the higher notes. The upper-register fingerings are somewhat different from the bassoon and in scale it can only ascend to B (although their response is questionable, a B and C, and even C and D, are possible). In general professionals prefer the F instrument as it feels and responds more like a bassoon while the smaller G instrument is used more for children. The sound of the tenor bassoon can be compared to that of a dull English horn and has been described as somewhat saxophone-like. It can make an excellent tenor or alto voice in a wind ensemble or orchestra (the latter could benefit from having a true tenor instrument in the woodwind department). It could effectively bridge the octave (or octave and a half if bass oboe is omitted) gap between the bassoon family and the oboe family. Although it does not effectively extend the range of the bassoon, it can be used to give more flexibility in that range where the bassoon lacks in mobility. Its sounding range is from F to F.\\"Tenor Bassoon (Tenoroon)\\" by Bret Newton, bandestration.com, 16 September 2015 =Notable works= *Johann Kaspar Frost (Trost?) ‚Äì Parthia No. IV for 2 Horns in C, 2 Octave Bassoons, 2 Tenor Bassoons in F and 2 Bassoons *Victor Bruns ‚Äì Sonatina for Tenor Bassoon in F and Piano Op. 96 *Victor Bruns ‚Äì Trio for Tenor Bassoon in F, Bassoon and Contrabassoon Op. 97, dedicated to William Waterhouse *Timothy Raymond ‚Äì \\"Lost Music\\" for Tenor Bassoon in F and Piano (1992) *Bret Newton ‚Äì \\"Osiris: Lord of the Duat\\" Symphonic Poem for solo Tenor Bassoon in F and Orchestra (2005) *Bret Newton ‚Äì \\"Forest Scenes\\" for Tenor Bassoon in F and 3 Marimbas (2006) *Robert Harvey ‚Äì \\"Runes\\" for Tenor Bassoon in F and Piano (2009) *Graham Waterhouse ‚Äì \\"The Akond of Swat\\" for Tenor Bassoon in F, Bassoon and Piano (2009) *Elliott Schwartz ‚Äì \\"Tenor Variations\\" for Tenor Bassoon in F and Piano (2013) *Vincenzo Toscano ‚Äì \\"Prosopon\\" for Tenor Bassoon in G, 2 Bassoons and Contrabassoon (2018) *Carla Magnan ‚Äì \\"Il magnifico canocchiale\\" for 2 Tenor Bassoons in G, Bassoon and Contrabassoon (2018) References  External links  * , Victor Bruns: Trio for Tenor Bassoon, Bassoon and Contrabassoon, Op. 97 (1992) Category:Woodwind instruments Category:Single oboes with conical bore ","title":"Tenoroon"},{"id":"3687830","text":"Since 1998, Trey Anastasio, best known from Phish, has toured and recorded with several backup musicians, including several side-projects organized and led by the guitarist and composer. While active, his bands did not have a name. Fans commonly referred to them as Trey Anastasio Band, or TAB for short. This group should not be confused with the current Trey Anastasio Band, which was renamed in 2006 from its original name 70 Volt Parade. Through its brief history, Trey Anastasio's band continued to add members, starting as a trio and ending as a dectet. The beginning Trey's band had it roots in his brother-in-law's Vermont nightclub, Higher Ground. On April 17, 1998, for the second show in the club's existence, Anastasio put together a band of local Vermont musicians for a one time performance under the name Eight Foot Fluorescent Tubes. Among the five musicians onstage with Trey that evening were drummer Russ Lawton and bassist Tony Markellis. They debuted material that night that became part of the repertoire of both Phish and Anastasio's solo career. The trio Less than a year later, on February 15, 1999, Trey performed a benefit show at Higher Ground for a local arts charity with Lawton and Markellis. Later that spring, the trio (as they are referred to on Anastasio's website) went on a national tour of clubs and theatres. Most of the shows sold out, which featured a solo acoustic set by Anastasio and an electric set by The Trio. They debuted more new songs, many of them appearing on Phish‚Äôs 2000 album, Farmhouse. Absent from the tour were any songs from Trey's first solo album, One Man's Trash, which was released in late 1998. In Spring 2018, Trey toured again as a trio alongside Lawton and Markellis. The tour began on April 17, 2018‚Äîon the 20 year anniversary of Trey's first solo show, Eight Foot Fluorescent Tubes. The sextet After Phish went on hiatus in 2000, Anastasio took his project on the road and added a horn section. Saxophonist Dave Grippo, a Burlington music teacher with a long history with Phish, trombone player Andy Moroz, and trumpet player Jennifer Hartswick joined Trey's band for this and all future tours. These shows, and all to follow had two full sets with the band, and no solo acoustic set. The octet Later in 2001, with Phish still inactive, Anastasio booked a summer tour of large amphitheatres where Phish had regularly performed in recent years. This tour also included some venues that Phish hadn't played in years like Red Rocks in Colorado and Jones Beach in Long Island, New York. Two more members were added to Trey's band, tenor saxophonist/flautist Russell Remington and keyboardist Ray Paczkowski The dectet 2002 saw the release of Trey's self-titled second album, and a summer tour to support it. This tour of amphitheatres was significantly smaller than the 2001 tour. At this time, Anastasio added the final two members to the group, Brazilian percussionist Cyro Baptista and the multitalented Peter Apfelbaum. Late in the summer of 2002, Phish announced their reunion, with their first show slated for New Year's Eve. During the fall of 2002, with Anastasio still promoting his second solo album, he took his dectet for a tour of smaller venues. In 2003, with a Phish summer tour planned, Trey scaled back his touring. He played a brief tour that spring, before spending his first summer in three years with Phish. In 2004, Trey played some random dates. He performed at the Easter jam at Higher Ground, with the other members of Phish. He then played a surprise birthday party in Stowe, Vermont. In May, with Phish tour dates already booked, Anastasio made the announcement that Phish would be breaking up and the upcoming summer tour would be their last. In June, days before Phish would start its final tour, Trey performed at the Bonnaroo music festival. On September 18, 2004, about a month after Phish's final performance, Trey would play his final performance to date with his horn-based band at the Austin City Limits Music Festival. Subsequent solo bands In the spring of 2005, Anastasio introduced a new backing band, 70 Volt Parade, featuring Paczkowski, Skeeto Valdez on drums, Peter Chwazik on bass, and Les Hall on guitar and keyboards. After only a few months, Anastasio replaced Chwazik with Tony Hall of Ivan Neville's Dumpstaphunk, and added Hartswick and Christina Durfee on backing vocals. Anastasio then replaced Valdez with Raymond Weber. Russell Remington also rejoined Anastasio shortly thereafter. In 2006, Les Hall left the band, and it was renamed Trey Anastasio Band. Jeff Cressman and Jeff Sipe, who replaced Weber, toured with the project in 2006 and 2007.https://phish.net/shows/featuring/jeff-cressman Fall 2008 tour and onward In October 2008, Anastasio set out on a short tour billed as \\"Trey Anastasio & Classic TAB\\". This quartet featured Anastasio on guitar, Tony Markellis on bass, Russ Lawton on drums, and Ray Paczkowski on keyboards. In 2010, Jennifer Hartswick officially rejoined the project, renamed Trey Anastasio Band, and has remained with the group ever since.https://phish.net/people/jennifer-hartswick/appearances At the same, time Anastasio welcomed back Russ Remington https://phish.net/shows/featuring/russ-remington and introduced Natalie Cressman, ,https://phish.net/shows/featuring/natalie-cressman whose father Jeff was a member of TAB in 2006 and 2007.

The story details a geologist's mineral discovery, and the preparations for the attack: soldier recruitment, training, reconnaissance, and the logistics of the coup d'√©tat (buying weapons, transport, payment). Like most of Forsyth's work, the novel is more about the protagonists' occupational tradecraft than their characters. The source of the title, The Dogs of War, is Act III, scene 1, line 270 of Julius Caesar (1599), by William Shakespeare: Cry, 'Havoc!', and let slip the dogs of war. The mercenary protagonists, like the protagonist in the author's earlier novel The Day of the Jackal (1971), are ruthless, violent anti-heroes. Initially introduced as simple killers-for-hire, as the novel progresses they are gradually shown to adhere to a relatively moral mercenary code. Forsyth draws upon his journalistic experiences in reporting the 1970 Biafran War between Biafra and Nigeria; though fictional, the African 'Republic of Zangaro' is based upon Equatorial Guinea, a former Spanish colony. The novel's dedication to five men named Giorgio, Christian, Schlee, Big Marc and Black Johnny and \\"the others in the unmarked graves\\" concludes: \\"at least we tried\\"‚Äîand alludes to Forsyth's time in Biafra; the dark tone and cynical plot of the story stem from the same source. An eponymous film was released in 1980, based upon the novel and directed by John Irvin. The movie was filmed in Belize.  Plot summary  = Part 1: The Crystal Mountain = 1970: The prologue shows \\"Cat\\" Shannon and his fellow mercenaries leaving a West African war they have lost, saying their goodbyes to the General, who employed them for six months. A few weeks later, a prospector employed by British-based company Manson Consolidated sends mineral samples, acquired from the \\"Crystal Mountain\\" in the remote hinterland of the African republic of Zangaro, to headquarters. When they are analysed, ruthless British mining tycoon Sir James Manson realises that there is a huge platinum deposit in Zangaro. The president of Zangaro, Jean Kimba, is Marxist, homicidal, insane, and under Soviet influence, so any public announcement of the findings would benefit only the Russians. Confiding only in his top assistants, security chief Simon Endean and financial expert Martin Thorpe, Manson plans to depose Kimba and install a puppet leader who, for a pittance, will sign over Zangaro's mining rights to a shell company secretly owned by Manson. When Manson Consolidated eventually acquires the shell company for a fair market price, Sir James Manson and his aides will pocket ¬£60 million. On the recommendation of a freelance writer (a thinly veiled allusion to Forsyth himself), Endean hires Anglo-Irish mercenary \\"Cat\\" Shannon to reconnoitre Zangaro, and to investigate how Kimba might be deposed. After a visit to the country masquerading as a tourist, Shannon reports that the army has little fighting value and that Kimba has concentrated the national armoury, treasury and radio station within the presidential palace in Clarence, the Zangaran capital city and principal port. Should the palace be stormed and Kimba killed, there will be no opposition to any new regime. Because there is no organised dissident faction in Zangaro, the attacking force will have to be assembled outside the country and land near Clarence to launch the attack. Shannon prices the mission at ¬£100,000, with ¬£10,000 for himself. While Endean has used a fake identity, calling himself \\"Walter Harris\\", Shannon has had Endean tailed by a private investigator and has discovered his true identity and his involvement with Sir James Manson. Although Manson has taken steps to silence the few people aware of the Crystal Mountain platinum deposit, the chemist who analysed the samples has inadvertently revealed his findings to the Soviets, who assign a KGB bodyguard to Kimba while they prepare to send in their own geological survey team. Manson learns from a Foreign Office bureaucrat that the Soviets have got wind of the deposit. He commissions Shannon to organise and mount the coup, to take place on the eve of Zangaro's independence day, one hundred days hence, but does not tell Shannon of the Soviet involvement. = Part 2: The Hundred Days = Shannon reassembles his old team to execute the attack on Kimba's palace: German ex-smuggler Kurt Semmler, South African mortar expert Janni Dupree, Belgian bazooka specialist \\"Tiny\\" Marc Vlaminck, and Corsican knife-fighter Jean-Baptiste Langarotti. Semmler travels Europe looking for a suitable cargo ship to transport them and their equipment to Zangaro. Dupree remains in London to buy all their uniforms, boots, haversacks and sleeping bags. Langarotti travels to Marseilles to acquire inflatable boats for the amphibious assault. Vlaminck accompanies Shannon to Belgium to obtain one hundred \\"Schmeisser\\" submachine guns from a former member of the SS, then remains in Belgium to prepare them to be smuggled out in oil drums. Shannon then travels to Luxembourg to establish a holding company to handle the purchase of the ship, to Spain to buy walkie-talkies, foghorns, flares, and 400,000 rounds of 9mm ammunition for the Schmeissers with a forged end user certificate, and to Yugoslavia to buy bazookas, mortars, and ammunition for them. Shannon also finds time for a brief sexual liaison with Julie Manson, Sir James's daughter, from whom he learns the bare essentials of Manson's true plan. Simultaneously, Charles Roux, one of Shannon's rivals, tries to have Shannon killed since he was frustrated that Endean did not approach him for the contract despite the freelance writer recommending him. Hearing of this, Langarotti tips Shannon off and they lure the assassin hired by Roux into a trap, sending his severed head to Roux to permanently silence him. Martin Thorpe has meanwhile secretly purchased the controlling share in Bormac Trading, a mining and plantation- owning company which has long ceased trading, from Lady MacAllister, the ailing widow of the company's founder. His and Manson's involvement is concealed behind the names of several fictitious shareholders. Endean has simultaneously obtained the agreement of Colonel Antoine Bobi, a former commander of the Zangaran Army who fell out with Kimba and is now in exile, to participate in Manson's scheme. Once installed as president, the venal and illiterate Bobi will sign over the mineral rights to the Crystal Mountain to Bormac Trading for a nominal price but a large bribe for himself. The mercenaries get underway after Semmler acquires a nondescript tramp cargo ship, the Toscana, for the operation. Hidden in oil drums, the Schmeissers are smuggled across the Belgian border into France and loaded aboard the Toscana at Marseilles, along with the uniforms and inflatable boats, marked supposedly for watersports in Morocco. They then sail to Ploƒçe in Yugoslavia to load the mortars and rocket launchers purchased legitimately from an arms dealer, without telling the Yugoslav authorities that they already have arms aboard. These weapons are then concealed below deck and the ship sails to Castellon in Spain to collect the ammunition (seemingly sold to the Iraqi police force). The ship then travels to Freetown in Sierra Leone to pick up six African mercenaries, disguised as casual stevedores, who will also participate in the attack, and Dr Okoye, an African academic. = Part 3: The Killing Spree = The attack on President Kimba's palace takes place as planned. In the early hours of the morning, the mercenaries land on the shores of Zangaro and set up foghorns and flares to disorient the defenders and illuminate the darkness. Dupree and two of the African mercenaries begin the assault by using mortars to bombard both a nearby army camp and the interior of the palace compound, thereby eliminating the palace guard, while Vlaminck destroys the compound gates with anti-tank rockets. As the bombardment ceases, Semmler, Shannon, Langarotti and the other four African mercenaries storm the palace, with Semmler shooting Kimba as he tries to escape through his bedroom window. Kimba's KGB bodyguard escapes the firefight and shoots Vlaminck in the chest, but Vlaminck kills him with his last bazooka rocket as he dies. Following the bombardment, Dupree and his two African mercenaries attack the nearby army camp. A Zangaran soldier throws a grenade at them as he flees and one of the African mercenaries throws it back, but it falls short and Dupree, deafened by the gunfire and shelling, fails to hear the warnings and is accidentally killed in the blast. Around midday, Endean arrives in Clarence to install Colonel Bobi as the new Zangaran president. He has his own bodyguard, a former East End gang enforcer. When Endean and Bobi arrive at the palace, Shannon lures Bobi into the presidential office. A shot is heard and Endean realizes that Shannon has killed Bobi. Shannon shoots Endean's bodyguard as the enforcer tries to draw his gun. He then casually introduces Dr. Okoye as the new head of government. At Shannon's order, the Soviet geological survey team's request to land in Zangaro is permanently refused. = The aftermath = As Shannon drives Endean to the border, he explains that Endean's otherwise comprehensive research failed to note the 20,000 immigrant workers who did most of the work in Zangaro, but were politically disenfranchised by the Kimba government. A hundred of them, in new uniforms and armed with Schmeissers, have already been recruited as the nucleus of the new Zangaran Army. When Shannon tells Endean that the coup was really conducted on behalf of the General, Endean is furious but Shannon points out that this government will at least be fair, and if Manson wants the platinum, he will have to pay the proper market price. Endean threatens revenge if he ever sees the mercenary in London, but Shannon ignores the warning. In the novel's epilogue, it is revealed that Dupree and Vlaminck were buried in simple unmarked graves near the shore. Semmler later sold the Toscana to its captain, and died while on another mercenary operation in Africa. Langarotti's fate is ambiguous; the novel tells only that after he took his pay, he was last heard of going to train a new group of Hutu partisans in Burundi against Michel Micombero, telling Shannon \\"It's not really the money. It was never for the money.\\" The epilogue reveals that before embarking on the Zangaro operation, Shannon was diagnosed with terminal lung cancer (skin cancer in some American editions) with only a year to six months to live. Three months after the coup, he posts the remainder of his earnings to the surviving family members of his fallen teammates, and also sends a manuscript (presumably outlining the entire plan) to a journalist in London (presumably the aforementioned freelance writer). Lastly, Shannon walks into the African bush, whistling a favourite tune (\\"Spanish Harlem\\"), to end his life on his own terms with \\"a gun in his hand, blood in his mouth, and a bullet in his chest\\".

Five years after the 1973 attempted coup d'√©tat, Forsyth's research was subject of a feature story in The Times, which posited he had commissioned the operation in earnest; many people believed he was planning a real coup d'√©tat in Equatorial Guinea. Later, Forsyth said that arms dealers were the most frightening people he had ever met; the mercenaries Mike Hoare, Bob Denard, \\"Black Jack\\" Schramme and Rolf Steiner are all mentioned in the novel. According to UK National Archives documents released in 2005, in early 1973, several people in Gibraltar were planning a coup d'√©tat against Equatorial Guinea, in the manner described in The Dogs of War. Spain arrested several mercenaries in the Canary Islands on 23 January 1973, foiling the plot.Roberts, The Wonga Coup [2006]> There was a coup d'√©tat in Equatorial Guinea in 1979 ‚Äì Francisco Mac√≠as Nguema, the left-wing dictator, was overthrown and killed by his nephew, Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo the right-wing President. In 2004, in a copycat plan based on Forsyth's book, a coup d'√©tat intended to secure lucrative mining rights granted by a client puppet government was attempted. The plan involved Mark Thatcher, who was intending to trade on his mother's (former British prime minister Margaret Thatcher) connections and reputation to call favours, and the mercenary Simon Mann, who subsequently stood trial and was convicted. Thatcher received a suspended 4-year sentence; Mann was sentenced to 34 years in 2008 but was pardoned in 2009. In Ken Connor's book How to Stage a Military Coup, the author praises The Dogs of War as a textbook for mercenaries.

LeGault, released in January 2006. It was published under Threshold Editions, a conservative publishing imprint under Simon & Schuster run by Mary Matalin. Think claims to refute Blink, the best-selling 2005 book by Malcolm Gladwell. It argues that United States and the West are in decline because of an intellectual crisis. Think contends that blink-like snap judgments are the cause of major failures such as the Hurricane Katrina response. Michael LeGault maintains that relying on emotion and instinct instead of reason and facts is ultimately a threat to our freedom and way of life. Summary Think begins as a critique of the decline of critical thinking in America. LeGault briefly mentions Blink as the height of this irrationality, but moves on to other failures in government, schools, media, and industry. LeGault offers several examples of irrationality and mediocrity throughout the book: * Poor decision-making at General Motors and the decline of the American auto industry. * The politically correct reaction to remarks by Lawrence Summers, regarding gender differences. * The failures of affirmative action to close the achievement gap. * Sensationalist journalism, and the decline of newspaper readership. * Over-emphasis on stress relief in marketing and media. * The banning of DDT by the Environmental Protection Agency, in reaction to the book Silent Spring. * The rise of relativism, as described by Allan Bloom in his book, Closing of the American Mind. Much of the book deals with examples of failures or anomalies in American achievements. LeGault often attributes these shortcomings to a growing attitude or influential group. On page 93, he describes the problem of over-medicating children with Attention Deficit Disorder and Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder: In view of LeGault's description of the problem, he closes the book by offering solutions. Specifically, he calls for higher standards, especially among parents and schools. Reception The book received praise for its analysis and refutation of the points brought up by Gladwell.Douglas Johnston, Winnipeg Free Press, Feb. 5, 2006Greg Copley, editor-in-chief, Defense and Foreign Affairs Publishing Group, Jan., 2006 However, LeGault has been criticized as a dealer of conspiracy theories as the book occasionally attributes the problems in American society to specific groups,.Zachary Houle says \\"there are some real howlers sprinkled throughout Think, examples of pure lunacy that would be unintentionally funny on a Reefer Madness level if some of them weren't so patently offensive.\\" \\"Blink 180\\" - Review by Zachary Houle References * External links *Official webpage *Author's presentation at The Heritage Foundation on C-SPAN Category:2006 non- fiction books Category:Psychology books ","title":"Think (book)"},{"id":"3687903","text":"Sir John Henry Lefroy, ca. 1880 Sir John Henry Lefroy (28 January 1817 ‚Äì 11 April 1890) was an English military man and later colonial administrator who also distinguished himself with his scientific studies of the Earth's magnetism.  Biography  Lefroy entered the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich in London in 1831 and became a 2nd lieutenant of the Royal Artillery in 1834. When the British government launched a project under the direction of Edward Sabine to study terrestrial magnetism, he was chosen to set up and supervise the observatory on Saint Helena. He embarked on 25 September 1839, for Saint Helena, and carried out his task throughout the following year. In 1842, Lefroy was sent to Toronto as the superintendent of the new Toronto Magnetic and Meteorological Observatory built there as part of that project. He immediately began planning a field expedition to the Canadian northwest to measure magnetism there. With an assistant and a Hudson's Bay Company brigade, he travelled more than 5,000 miles in the Northwest from May 1843 to November 1844, taking measurements at over 300 stations in an attempt to map the geo- magnetic activity of British North America from Montreal to the Arctic Circle, and locate the North Magnetic Pole. They followed the Mackenzie River as far as Fort Good Hope and visited Fort Simpson in the west. On 9 June 1848, Lefroy was made a member of the Royal Society. Lefroy remained in Toronto until 1853, continuing his observations and managing the observatory. On 16 April 1846, he married his first wife Emily Mary, a daughter of Sir John Robinson, 1st Baronet, of Toronto; they would have two daughters and two sons. Lefroy also helped found the Royal Canadian Institute, where he was the first vice- president in 1851/52 and then president in 1852/53. Before his return to London, he managed the transfer of the Toronto Magnetic and Meteorological Observatory to the provincial government. Upon his return to London in April 1853, Lefroy held various office positions in the British Army. He became involved in the army reform, and in that function corresponded from 1855 to 1868 with Florence Nightingale. Later, he became Inspector General of army schools and finally in 1868 director of the Ordnance Office. In 1859 his wife died, and on 12 September the following year he married his second wife Charlotte Anna n√©e Dundas (widow of Col. Armine Mountain). When he retired from the army in 1870 with the honorary rank of Major General, he entered the Colonial Service (now the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and was appointed Governor of Bermuda from 1871 to 1877. He left this position due to illness and returned to England, but later served as Administrator of Tasmania from 21 October 1880 to 7 December 1881. John Henry Lefroy was made a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) in 1870, and knighted in 1877 (KCMG).  Legacy  A small town in Ontario, Lefroy, situated on the south end of Lake Simcoe was named after John Henry Lefroy. Mount Lefroy in the Rocky Mountains named after John Henry Lefroy, although it appears unclear if James Hector of the Palliser Expedition named it in 1858, or if the name is due to George Mercer Dawson, 1884. The Surveyor: Portrait of Captain John Henry Lefroy, ca. 1845, sold at a record price of more than C$5 million in 2002. The painting is sometimes also called Scene in the Northwest. The painting Scene in the Northwest: Portrait of John Henry Lefroy by Paul Kane showing John Henry Lefroy, which had been in possession of the Lefroy family in England, garnered a record price at an auction at Sotheby's in Toronto on 25 February 2002, when Canadian billionaire Kenneth Thomson won the bid at C$5,062,500 including fees (US$3,172,567.50 at the time). Thomson subsequently donated the painting as part of his Thomson Collection to the Art Gallery of Ontario. In 1960, the Ontario Heritage Foundation, Ministry of Citizenship and Culture erected a Provincial Military Plaque dedicated to Sir John Lefroy (1817‚Äì1890) on the University of Toronto campus.

Such a gallstone enters the bowel via a cholecysto-enteric fistula. The presence of large stones, >2.5 cm in diameter, within the gallbladder are thought to predispose to fistula formation by gradual erosion through the gallbladder fundus. Once a fistula has formed, a stone may travel from the gallbladder into the bowel and become lodged almost anywhere along the gastrointestinal tract. Obstruction occurs most commonly at the near the distal ileum, within 60 cm proximally to the ileocecal valve. Rarely, gallstone ileus may recur if the underlying fistula is not treated. First described by Thomas Bartholin in 1654, the name \\"gallstone ileus\\" is a misnomer because an ileus is, by definition, a non-mechanical bowel motility failure (as opposed to a mechanical obstruction by a stone). Diagnosis Diagnosis of gallstone ileus requires radiographic studies. Classic radiographic findings are known as Rigler's triad: * pneumobilia (air within the biliary tree) * evidence of small bowel obstruction * radiopaque gallstone on abdominal radiograph Treatment Initial management involves fluid resuscitation and potentially nasogastric suctioning. Since gallstone ileus constitutes a form of mechanical small bowel obstruction, it can be a surgical emergency and requires open or laparoscopic surgery to remove an impacted stone. The different strategies for surgical management are either enterolithotomy alone, allowing a delayed cholecystectomy after an inflammation-free period of 4‚Äì6 weeks (and therefore two-stage surgery) or enterolithotomy in combination with a cholecystectomy and fistula division (one-stage surgery). The different strategies for surgical management are controversial, and depend on factors such as patient fitness for surgery and comorbidities. Eponym Bouveret's syndrome refers to reverse gallstone ileus where the gallstone propagates proximally and causes gastric outlet obstruction by being impacted in first part of duodenum.

It is a method for correlating changes in the oscillation frequency of a piezoelectric crystal with the mass deposited on it. He simultaneously developed a method for measuring the characteristic frequency and its changes by using the crystal as the frequency determining component of an oscillator circuit. His method continues to be used as the primary tool in quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) experiments for conversion of frequency to mass and is valid in nearly all applications. The equation is derived by treating the deposited mass as though it were an extension of the thickness of the underlying quartz. Because of this, the mass to frequency correlation (as determined by Sauerbrey‚Äôs equation) is largely independent of electrode geometry. This has the benefit of allowing mass determination without calibration, making the set-up desirable from a cost and time investment standpoint. The Sauerbrey equation is defined as: :\\\\Delta f = -\\\\frac{2f_0^2}{A \\\\sqrt{ \\\\rho_q \\\\mu_q } }\\\\Delta m where: :f_0 ‚Äì Resonant frequency of the fundamental mode (Hz) : \\\\Delta f ‚Äì normalized frequency change (Hz) : \\\\Delta m ‚Äì Mass change (g) : A ‚Äì Piezoelectrically active crystal area (Area between electrodes, cm2) : \\\\rho_q ‚Äì Density of quartz ( \\\\rho_q = 2.648 g/cm3) : \\\\mu_q ‚Äì Shear modulus of quartz for AT-cut crystal ( \\\\mu_q = 2.947x1011 g¬∑cm‚àí1¬∑s‚àí2) The normalized frequency \\\\Delta f is the nominal frequency shift of that mode divided by its mode number (most software outputs normalized frequency shift by default). Because the film is treated as an extension of thickness, Sauerbrey‚Äôs equation only applies to systems in which the following three conditions are met: the deposited mass must be rigid, the deposited mass must be distributed evenly and the frequency change \\\\Delta f /f < 0.05. If the change in frequency is greater than 5%, that is, \\\\Delta f /f > 0.05, the Z-match method must be used to determine the change in mass. The formula for the Z-match method is: :\\\\frac{\\\\Delta m}{A}\\\\ = \\\\frac{N_q \\\\rho_q}{\\\\pi Z f_L}\\\\tan^{-1} \\\\left [ Z\\\\tan \\\\left ( \\\\pi \\\\frac{f_U-f_L}{f_U} \\\\right ) \\\\right ] Equation 2 ‚Äì Z-match method : f_L ‚Äì Frequency of loaded crystal (Hz) : f_U ‚Äì Frequency of unloaded crystal, i.e. Resonant frequency (Hz) : N_q ‚Äì Frequency constant for AT-cut quartz crystal (1.668x1013Hz¬∑√Ö) : \\\\Delta m ‚Äì Mass change (g) : A ‚Äì Piezoelectrically active crystal area (Area between electrodes, cm2) : \\\\rho_q ‚Äì Density of quartz ( \\\\rho_q = 2.648 g/cm3) : Z ‚Äì Z-Factor of film material = \\\\sqrt{ \\\\left ( \\\\frac{\\\\rho_q\\\\mu_q}{\\\\rho_f\\\\mu_f}\\\\ \\\\right ) } : \\\\rho_f ‚Äì Density of the film (Varies: units are g/cm3) : \\\\mu_q ‚Äì Shear modulus of quartz ( \\\\mu_q = 2.947x1011 g¬∑cm‚àí1¬∑s‚àí2) : \\\\mu_f ‚Äì Shear modulus of film (Varies: units are g¬∑cm‚àí1¬∑s‚àí2)  Limitations  The Sauerbrey equation was developed for oscillation in air and only applies to rigid masses attached to the crystal. It has been shown that quartz crystal microbalance measurements can be performed in liquid, in which case a viscosity related decrease in the resonant frequency will be observed: :\\\\Delta f = { -\\\\ f_0^{3/2} ( \\\\eta_l \\\\rho_l / \\\\pi \\\\rho_q \\\\mu_q n )^{1/2} } where \\\\rho_l is the density of the liquid, \\\\eta_l is the viscosity of the liquid, and n is the mode number.

She was the first American to win the title, and had previously been crowned Miss USA 1954. Prior to Miss USA, Stevenson was Miss South Carolina USA 1954, becoming the first woman from South Carolina to win Miss USA. She also represented South Carolina in Miss America 1954 after winning Miss South Carolina 1953, where she placed in the top ten. At Miss Universe, Stevenson received a tied final score with Martha Rocha of Brazil. In order to break the tie, the woman deemed to have the better physique was crowned the winner, due to a major sponsor of the pageant being Catalina Swimwear. This was determined to be Stevenson, due to having \\"fitter\\" hips than Rocha. She was crowned Miss Universe by outgoing titleholder Christiane Martel of France. After winning the title, Stevenson decided to award part of her prize to Rocha, granting her the new car that she was awarded. At the end of her reign, she crowned Hillevi Rombin of Sweden as Miss Universe 1955. After acting at Universal Studios in Hollywood for one year through a film contract she won as part of her Miss Universe package, Stevenson made headlines in Variety when she announced that she would be returning home to South Carolina to finish her education at Lander University instead of continuing her work in Hollywood. In South Carolina, Stevenson found work hosting television programs for WIS, the local NBC affiliate in Columbia, South Carolina. Here she met her husband Donald Upton; they have two children together, with their son Donald Jr. being a former telecom executive and founder of the global economic development and public affairs firm Fairfield Index, Inc. Until the 1970s, Stevenson was active in the media as a model, television presenter, and actress in national commercials, and also participated as a judge at several Miss Universe competitions.

She was crowned by Hillevi Rombin, Miss Universe 1955, of Sweden.  Early life Morris was born in Omaha, Nebraska, as the only child of a minister. The family first moved to Scott City, Kansas, where she attended elementary school. After moving to Ottumwa, Iowa, Miss Morris attended Ottumwa High School where she graduated 4th in her class of 300. Morris was a champion swimmer and worked as a lifeguard, sang in the church choir, and played the violin. She attended Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa, where she was a member of the Beta Kappa chapter of Kappa Alpha Theta and a decorated swim team member. Career Morris developed into a 5-foot 7-inch young woman weighing 131 pounds, with blue eyes and dark brown, almost black, hair, and a 36-25-36-inch figure. The first beauty pageant she entered and won was the Miss Ottumwa contest. Morris was in high school and was sponsored by the South Ottumwa Boosters club. While attending Drake University she entered and won the Miss Iowa 1954 beauty contest. Morris then represented Iowa in the Miss America 1955 contest. In the talent portion of that competition she played the song Stardust on her violin. Morris won the 1956 Miss USA contest that had 43 contestants and was held in Long Beach, California. She then competed and won against 29 contestants in the 1956 Miss Universe beauty pageant, also held in Long Beach. While reigning as Miss Universe Morris met Presidents Harry Truman and Herbert Hoover, and entertained U.S. troops with Bob Hope. She was also able to return home to the biggest celebration ever held in Ottumwa. A parade was organized in her honor, including Iowa's Governor Leo Hoegh and the four foot high Miss Universe trophy. In 1956 and 1957, she appeared as a mystery guest on What's My Line and To Tell the Truth, respectively. After completing her reign as Miss Universe she began an acting career. One of the awards for winning the Miss Universe title was a one-year movie contract. Her first film was Crazy Love with co-star Jeff Chandler. She acted in many films and TV shows. Morris's last role was in Paradise Alley produced in 1962, not to be confused with the more famous 1978 film with the same name Morris married in June 1959: At age 23 she wed 45-year-old Ed \\"Buzz\\" Burke a wealthy Texas oilman from Houston, Texas.

Displacing the old Russian-made Ladas, it is driven by government officials and police and also available to rental car fleets. The specification includes power windows and air conditioning. Still, they have a reputation for being unreliable and many drivers thus prefer the older, Russian-built vehicles. The CK is based on a South Korean design by Daewoo, Tower Metal, Wooshin Systems, and CES, which Geely licensed. Its 1.5 L engine is a Toyota Motor Corporation design, also licensed. It produces 94 hp (70 kW) at 6000 rpm. The 4 speed automatic transmission is built in China, the first to be manufactured there.

Enlarged twice and doubling in size each time, it became the largest wooden structure in the world, with 1,700 employees and accommodations for 2,000 guests. It closed and was razed during the Great Depression. History of the hotel The six-story, Georgian-style hotel was built as a winter retreat for the elite by Henry Flagler, an oil, real estate and railroad tycoon. When he began buying tracts of land here \\"at any price,\\" Palm Beach was a desolate barrier island on Florida's Atlantic coast. That began changing, however, when Flagler extended his Florida East Coast Railway to West Palm Beach. The Royal Poinciana Hotel, built beside the Lake Worth Lagoon, was intended to accommodate his railroad's passengers escaping cold northern winters. Ground was broken May 1, 1893, and the hotel opened on February 11, 1894‚Äîwelcoming 17 guests. Dining room in c. 1920 Flagler built a spur line across Lake Worth to Palm Beach, allowing the wealthy to arrive directly at the hotel's entrance in their own private railway cars. Palm Beach quickly developed into a popular tourist destination for parties, golf, tennis, boating, bathing and fishing. The social season originally ran between mid-December and February 23 (the day after Flagler's annual George Washington Ball held at Whitehall, his 1902 mansion). Enlarged to handle the crowds, the hotel stretched 1,800 feet (549 meters) along Lake Worth. Its hallways totaled more than three miles (5 kilometers) in length. Bellhops delivered messages and packages from the front desk to the guest rooms by bicycle. On the Atlantic Ocean beach side portion of the property, Flagler erected in 1896 The Palm Beach Inn, later renamed The Breakers Hotel in 1901 because guests often requested rooms \\"over by the breakers.\\" Patrons were shuttled between the two hotels along a pine trail in wheeled wicker chairs, often referred to as an Afromobile, powered by hotel employees, with a separate palm trail reserved for pedestrians. Pre-Negro Leagues, Winter League baseball team In the winter of 1915‚Äì1916, the Royal Poinciana Hotel hired the services of C.I. Taylor and many members of his Indianapolis ABCs pre-Negro League baseball team to take on another pre-Negro League baseball team hosted by the Breakers. The games hosted Negro League baseball stars of the day, including Ben Taylor, C.I.

In 1925, the Breakers burned and was rebuilt, reopening in 1926 with new luxuries which attracted guests away from the Royal Poinciana. The 1928 Okeechobee hurricane hit the old hotel hard, especially the north wing, which shifted off its foundation. It was repaired, but then the Stock Market Crash of 1929 and subsequent Great Depression dealt fatal blows. The sprawling structure closed in 1934, and was torn down by Labor Day of 1935. In 1960, a marker was placed at the redeveloped site of the grand hotel which had helped establish Palm Beach.

(Frank) Brannigan (October 13, 1918 ‚Äì January 10, 2006) was a writer and teacher in the field of fire protection engineering. He died in his sleep at his home in Calverton, Maryland, United States, and was interred in Arlington National Cemetery. In his youth, he first enlisted and then was commissioned in the US Navy. While in the Navy, he was assigned to the Panama Canal Army-Navy-Pancanal lock project as chief of fire protection, and created a fire school there to train Navy crews in mass fire fighting tactics . Later, he served as Public Safety Liaison Officer for the US Atomic Energy Commission. As Professor and Director of the Fire Science program at Montgomery College, Rockville, Maryland, he designed a model Fire Science program. He was also a faculty member at the National Fire Academy and at the University of Maryland's Maryland Fire and Rescue Institute. Brannigan was elected a Fellow of the Society of Fire Protection Engineers. Frank Brannigan was the author of Building Construction for the Fire Service which was in its third edition when he died. The fourth edition had been completed before his death and was published posthumously. Brannigan is primarily recognized for his efforts to increase firefighter safety through education on the dangers of building collapse. When he began his career in the 1930s there was no systematic treatment of the problem of building collapse in fire. Brannigan brought together the technical and fire communities to create an integrated approach to firefighter safety. He made a strong and conscious effort in all of his writing to use plain language to explain technical concepts, in order to make it more accessible. His efforts have been rewarded in being quoted by such figures as Battalion Chief Arthur Scheuerman, FDNY (Retired) in his analysis of the collapse of the World Trade Center towers. His column in FireRescue Magazine, also titled \\"Building Construction\\" ran for many years. In 1977 the Francis L. Brannigan Instructor of the Year Award was created in his honor. The Award recognizes contributions in Fire, EMS and Rescue training in the state of Maryland. The award is sponsored every year by the Chesapeake Society of Fire and Rescue Instructors and the Maryland Chapter of the International Society of Fire and Rescue Instructors and awarded by the Maryland State Firemen's Association. Frank Brannigan was also credited as being one of the originators of the concept of a database that tracks firefighter \\"near misses\\" and supplements the statistics kept for firefighters killed in the line of duty. His focus for more than 75 years was the reduction of firefighter injury and death. His son Vincent Brannigan is an attorney and a Professor in the University Of Maryland Department of Fire Protection Engineering. His granddaughter Ariana Kelly is a state delegate in Maryland. Francis L. Brannigan was inducted into the United States Navy Fire & Emergency Services Hall of Fame in August 2010.  External links * : Washington Post Obituary Brannigan, F. L. (2005).

She originated from and is often conflated with another Naamah, sister to Tubal-cain. In the Talmud In Talmudic-midrashic literature, Naamah is indistinguishable from the human Naamah, who earned her name by seducing men through her play of cymbals. She also enticed the angel Shamdon or Shomron and bore Ashmodai, the king of devils. It was later, in Kabbalistic literature like the Zohar, that she became an inhuman spirit.Raphael Patai (1990). The Hebrew Goddess. Wayne State University Press. In the Zohar According to the Zohar, after Cain kills Abel, Adam separates from Eve for 130 years. During this time, Lilith and Naamah seduce him and bear his demonic children, who became the Plagues of Mankind. She and Lilith cause epilepsy in children.Zohar 3:76b-77a In another story from the Zohar, Naamah and Lilith are said to have corrupted the angels Ouza and Azazel.Zohar: Genesis: Chapter XXXIIFrom Book Nine, Myths of Exile The text states she also attracts demon, as she is continuously chased by demon kings Afrira and Qastimon every night, but she leaps away every time and takes multiple forms to entice men. > She makes sport with the sons of man, and conceives from them through their > dreams, from the male desire, and she attaches herself to them.

It was directed by Ida Lupino. Lupino also co-wrote the script, along with the producers Malvin Wald and Lupino's then-husband Collier Young. Outrage, the first starring film role for Powers, was both controversial and remarkable for being only the second post-Code Hollywood film to deal with the issue of rape, after Johnny Belinda (1948), which had earned the actress who portrayed the victim, Jane Wyman, the Best Actress Academy Award. Plot Ann Walton (Mala Powers) is a young bookkeeper who has a steady boyfriend, Jim Owens. When Jim announces that he has received a raise the young couple decide to finally marry and inform Ann's parents about the engagement. Meanwhile, a man who works at the concession stand where Ann works takes an interest in her and tries to flirt with her, though she is uninterested. Staying late at work one night, Ann notices she is being stalked and tries to run away from the man who is following her. She is unable to hide and is eventually caught and raped by the man who works the concession stand. The memory of a scar on the man's neck is the only thing able to come through to Ann in her trauma. Returning home Ann's parents learn of what happened and contact the police. Though the police and her family, friends, and fianc√©, Jim, are supportive, Ann believes that the neighbors are gossiping about her and that Jim can no longer see her as she once was. After being forced to look at a lineup of men with scars, none of whom she can identify as her attacker, Ann runs away, taking the bus to Los Angeles on a whim. While the bus driver is on a break, Ann overhears on the radio that her parents are looking for her and have identified her as the victim of a rape. Ann runs away from the bus and sprains her ankle where she is found by a man named Rev. Bruce Ferguson. He brings Ann to the orange farm belonging to his friends the Harrisons. He does his best to help Ann out, eventually securing her a job as a bookkeeper for the Harrisons. Ann and Ferguson grow increasingly close. When Ferguson asks her to attend a local festival she agrees, but when another attendee pressures her for a kiss she is reminded of her rape, and attacks him with a wrench. Ann is forced to stand trial, but Ferguson investigates why she would do such a thing and learns of her rape. He is able to persuade the judge to commute her sentence, and instead she goes to therapy for a year. At the end of her time in therapy Ann wants to stay with Ferguson and pursue a relationship with him, but he tells her not to run from life's challenges and encourages her to return to her old life and to Jim.

Biography He was born in Sevenoaks, England, the son of the Rev. Alfred Ernest Balch and Sarah Hawkes. He was educated at Bedford School and Kingswood School. Balch received a University scholarship but waived it to be a farmer. In 1913 he left home in England to become a cowboy in Canada. He arrived in Canada in 1913, departing from Liverpool and disembarking ten days later at Saint John. He took a train to Ontario but found little work there. In 1914, he was hired by the Ontario Reformatory and later, with the outbreak of World War I, enlisted, serving three years in France with the Canadian Field Artillery. After World War I, his interest in forest biology led him to enroll in the Ontario Agricultural College. He graduated in 1923 with a BSA degree. Afterwards, he took a summer job as a fire ranger and assisted an American forest entomologist. This led to his receiving an MS degree at Syracuse University's New York State College of Forestry in 1928. In 1930 he was appointed Officer-in-Charge of the Dominion Entomological Laboratory, a federal government facility on the University of New Brunswick campus in Fredericton, New Brunswick. He settled in Fredericton with his wife, Martha. His five half-hour radio lectures for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's University of the Air series in the spring of 1965 were essential in introducing the word \\"ecology\\" to the public. He later served as the honorary president for the Conservation Council of New Brunswick, one of the first modern Canadian environmental groups (established in 1969). He travelled and photographed in Europe, especially Ireland. His photos illustrated a book of Alden Nowlan's poems, Early Poems.

The park encompasses of hilly terrain with freshwater lakes, wetlands, salt marshes, open plains, reed beds and islands. The park's significance for conservation is reflected in the large number of species with over 1,200 different animals and plants. Its mandate includes the protection of the lake and lagoon of Butrint, the natural channel of Vivari, the islands of Ksamil and as well the archaeological site, that provides valuable remains of ancient civilizations. Butrint is strategically located in the eastern part of the Strait of Corfu in the extreme south of the country. It sprawls across a peninsula that is surrounded by Lake Butrint and Vivari Channel. The channel connects the lake to the Ionian Sea through a narrow sandy bar. Located in the direct proximity to the sea, the park experiences mild mediterranean climate. This means that the winters are mild and the summers are hot and dry. The archaeological heritage of Butrint is one of the most important archaeological sites in the country, containing different artefacts and structures, dating from the Iron Age up until the Middle Ages. Numerous monuments are still extant including the city walls, a late-antique baptistery, a great basilica, Roman theatre and two castles. The ancient city is situated within a natural woodland with a complex ecosystems which depends on the nearby lake and channel. Nevertheless, it is this combination of cultural monuments and natural environment which makes Butrint such a unique place. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed the park as Category II. In 1992, the archaeological site joined the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites. The lagoon has been further recognized as a wetland of international importance by designation under the Ramsar Convention. Nevertheless, Lake Butrint is an Important Bird and Plant Area, because it abundant to significant bird and plant species of international importance.  Administration  The Butrint National Park was established with ordinance number 82 on 2 March 2000 in order to preserve the natural ecosystems and landscapes along with their plant and animal communities and habitats and the cultural heritage as well. The park's territory was expanded several times until it reached its current area, recently in 2005. It is managed by a directorate subordinated to the Ministry of Environment of Albania based in Sarand√´. The park became an important centre of cultural management and a great example how to manage this heritage. With the support of Albanian institutions, Butrint Foundation, World Bank and UNESCO, the situation was improved to the point, that UNESCO removed the site from the World Heritage Sites in Danger list in 2005. The park was founded by the Ministry of Culture in partnership with UNESCO, ICCROM and ICOMOS. The underlying intention was to create a sustainable cultural heritage resource involving local communities and national institutions to serve as a model for other parks around the country. Nowadays, it is now a major centre for archaeology and conservation training schools organised by the Butrint Foundation in partnership with the Albanian Institutes of Archaeology and Monuments, foreign universities and international specialists and consultants. There is an active program of events in the theatre, concerts and performances, and outreach programmes for local schools and colleges. In 2010, national authorities demolished over 200 illegal structures in Ksamil that violated the town's master plan and the integrity of Butrint National Park. The remains of the demolished buildings have yet to be removed by authorities.  Geography  The Lake of Butrint makes up the core area of the Butrint National Park. The Butrint National Park comprises in Vlor√´ County located in the southwestern corner of Albania alongside the Ionian Sea within the Mediterranean Basin. It lies mostly between latitudes 39¬∞ and 44¬∞ N and longitudes 20¬∞ and 1¬∞ E. By road, the remains of Butrint are some south of the city of Sarand√´ and few kilometres north of the terrestrial border between Albania and Greece. According to the K√∂ppen climate classification, the park experiences Mediterranean climate (Csa and Csb) with rainy winters and dry, warm to hot summers. Located in the south of the Albanian Ionian Sea Coast, the park receives of precipitation annually. Butrint is part of a diverse hydrographical network, composed by the courses of several rivers, lagoons and lakes. The rivers are short, steep and characterized by high water volume. The park comprises Lake Butrint in the northwest, Lake Bufi in the southeast, Bistrica River in the north, Mile Mountain in the west and Pavllo River in the south. Lake Butrint is the largest lake and its water regime is typical of a coastal lagoon. It has a length of and a width of , with a surface area of . Having mesotrophic waters with eutrophic tendencies, the limnology of the lake is divided into two distinct layers. The Vivari Channel connects the lake with the Ionian Sea. Lake Bufi lies about above the Adriatic in the southeast of Lake Butrint, with a total surface area of . Its excessives waters are then discharged into the southern Lake Butrint through a former channel.  Biodiversity  = Flora = The central part of Lake Bufi is free of reed beds and a good sheltering and feeding site for various bird species. Due to its diverse geological and hydrological conditions and the mosaic distribution of various types of habitats, the location of the park is also one of the main reasons for the great variety of animals and plants. The park falls phytogeographically within the Illyrian deciduous forests terrestrial ecoregion of the Palearctic Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrub. The availability of water in forms of rivers, lakes and wetlands, influenced by the configuration of the terrain, has a great impact on the biodiversity of this area. The vertebrate flora of the park consists of more than 800 up to 900 species, which constitute 27% of the total number of species in Albania. Typical habitat along Lake Butrint and Vivari Channel. The shallow coastal lagoons are rocky with extensive mussel beds and the water depth is higher than in other areas. They are covered with dense grasses of phragmites and typha latifolia. There are also underwater meadows dominated by zostera noltei and ruppia cirrhosa. Within the archaeological site and southern and eastern slopes of Sotira, Evergreen forests occupy's most of the area. Moreover, it is vertically divided into three distinct vegetation zones. The upper tree level is covered by holly oak and bay laurel, which prevail over the other plants including field elm, narrow-leafed ash and valonia oak. The scrubby level is represented with elmleaf blackberry, common hawthorn, evergreen rose, common ivy and italian leather flower. Moreover, the herbal level is dominated among other by wild asparagus, hedge bedstraw, lesser celandine and purple loosestrife. Posidonia oceanica is mostly distributed along the littoral sea bottom, from the Stillo Cap to Cuka Channel, while cymodocea nodosa and zostera noltei are widely found along the mouth of Pavllo River. Along the cliffs, the salinity and rocky terrain have caused the decreased or poor the floristic composition. They are composed of species such as crithmum, elymus pycnanthus and golden samphire. = Fauna = The common bottlenose dolphin is often seen in the waters of Butrint and one of the main attractions of the park. The park contains a diverse assemblage of fauna with over 400 species distributed across the park's habitats and ecosystems. At least 39 species of mammals, 246 species of birds, 25 species of reptiles, 10 species of amphibia and 105 species of fish are known to occur within the park's boundaries. The park's forests and shrublands provide an important refuge for 39 species of mammals of which 14 species are classified as globally endangered. The beech marten thrives in the edges of the woodlands, and open hillsides of the park. The golden jackal and red fox are typically to be found in the grasslands feeding primarily on small rodents, while the grey wolf occurs only during winter in the park. Outstanding is the presence of the otter, found in the streams and lakes, that is protected by international conventions. The coastal waters around the park are frequented by dolphins such as the common bottlenose dolphin, short-beaked common dolphin and occasionally by the striped dolphin. The park provides one of the last remaining nesting habitat for the endangered mediterranean monk seal that is present in the rocks and caverns of the park. Sea turtles are not really that uncommon in the shallow coastal waters of the park. There are two species of sea turtles, such as the loggerhead sea turtle and leatherback sea turtle, that are listed as endangered or threatened by state authorities. The european pond turtle is often found in the wet and dry areas of the park. The park is rich in bird life with over 246 species living in different habitats throughout the territory. Many of these birds are residents and others are travellers passing through the Adriatic flyway. Most important bird inhabiting the park include the golden eagle, peregrine falcon, rock partridge, golden oriole and common buzzard. The bays and estuaries along the Ionian Sea Coast are a wintering destination for important birds. The wetlands serve as feeding and resting- places for the common pochard, great cormorant, great crested grebe, eurasian coot and black-headed gull. The reed beds are used by common moorhen, water rail, hen harrier, western marsh harrier, moustached warbler and remiz pendulinus. The marshes offer feeding sites for the little egret, grey plover, european golden plover and dunlin. Most of the waterbirds are concentrated in the coastal marshes such as the eurasian curlew, common redshank and sandwich tern. 10 species of amphibians are documented, although those species exist in large numbers, mostly inhabiting the forests and bushes. The most common species of amphibians include the fire salamander, northern crested newt, common toad and greek stream frog. The reptile diversity at Butrint is also rich, higher than any other protected area in the region. A total of 25 species have been inventoried. They are represented by balkan green lizard, slowworm and aesculapian snake. In regard to the sea, the park's bodies of water are frequented by 105 species of fish. The most abundant species include the flathead grey mullet, thinlip mullet, thicklip grey mullet, european eel, european hake and crucian carp.  Attractions  The theatre of Butrint with its Proscenium The rich history of Butrint has left important vestiges across the territory of the park. The principal architectural monuments in the park includes a Roman theatre, Dionysus altar, Nymphaeum, Thermae, Gymnasium, Forum, Aqueduct, the temples of Minerva and Asclepius, the Lion Gate and a Baptistery situated in Southern Albania and declared a UNESCO's World Heritage Site in 1992. The Roman theatre of Butrint is among the best preserved buildings of the town. It is located just below the Acropolis and facing out over the Vivari Channel. The theatre was built in the 3rd century BC, possibly on the walls of an older and smaller theatre. During the Roman period, it underwent many renovations and extensions. They built boxes for the upper- class above the two entrances of the theatre. The auditorium was also enlarged to accommodate the growing population of the town at that time. Ksamil Islands in Ksamil are part of the national park coverage area The Castle of Ali Pasha Tepelena lies within a small island along the mouth of the Vivari Channel and is named after the Albanian ruler Ali Pasha of Ioannina, who ruled over the Pashalik of Yanina and even attempted to rival the Dey of Algiers in the seas. The castle is a small rectangular structure with battered walls. Along the corners, there are two battered round towers with cannons on its seaward side and two irregularly sized battered square towers equipped with firing loops or windows. Another major attraction is the Lion Gate and one of the six entrances to the city from the 4th century BC. The inscriptions shows a lion, that is about to eat a bull. The lion symbolizes the inhabitants of the city and the bull as their enemies. The gate has a very narrow passage to allow as few people as possible to enter at the same time. In the west of the park, there sprawls the rocky Islands of Ksamil that are remote and can only be accessed by boat. Although, two of the islands are connected by a narrow strip of sand. Dolphins such as the short-beaked common dolphin and common bottlenose dolphin are often seen in the waters.

Born and raised in Prague, the Second World War severely impacted Zuman and his family while he was a teenager. In 1939, when he was 13 years old, the Germans occupied Czechoslovakia and sent his father to a concentration camp. In 1943‚Äì1944, Zuman worked in a Prague laboratory for the Research Institute of the Sugar Industry. Enjoying the work he wrote three papers on the alkaline cleavage of sucrose. However, in June 1944 Zuman was himself sent to a concentration camp. He was liberated from the camp on May 6, 1945 and then returned to Prague.  Biography  Zuman enrolled at Charles University in Prague in 1945 and graduated in early 1948. After this he joined the research group of Jaroslav Heyrovsk√Ω (Nobel prize in chemistry 1959) and was awarded a RNDr (equivalent to a PhD) in 1950. He was one of the first researchers in the newly created Central Polarographic Institute in Prague and within a few years he was appointed Head of the Organic Polarography Division. In 1960, Petr was awarded the Doctor of Science degree by the Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences. Following the 1967 political upheaval in Czechoslovakia, Zuman obtained a three-and-one-half-year appointment as a research fellow at the University of Birmingham in England. In 1970 he accepted a position in the Chemistry Department at Clarkson University in Potsdam, New York, where he remained until his retirement. Post-retirement Zuman has been an Emeritus Professor at Clarkson University and continues to contribute to the chemistry department. Special Field: Organic electroanalytical chemistry, organic reaction mechanisms. Research Interests - Electrochemistry Mechanisms of some organic reactions are investigated using polarographic, voltammetric and kinetic measurements. Examples of recently studied reactions are: Acid-base, hydration-dehydration and tautomeric equilibria involving 1,3,5- and 1,2,4-triazines, selenous acid and mytomicin C, reactions of bile acids, cholesterol, and other sterols in strongly acidic media, additions of nucleophiles, such as glutathione, to nitrosobenzene, etc. Most of these studies involve biologically important compounds and their investigations are essential both for development of analytical methods and for their contribution to a better understanding of biological activity. Another active area are studies of electroreduction and electrooxidation of some organic compounds, such as aromatic nitrocompounds, various pesticides including maleic hydrazide, 1,3,5- and 1,2,4-triazines, selenous acid, mitomycin C, phenols, etc. Structure-reactivity relationships are investigated, for example the transfer of electronic effects through an N-N single bond, ring formation of some 2-amino-1,4-benzoquinones, or interactions between two reducible groups in a molecule. Polarographic reduction of pesticides has been used to study their adsorption on lignin, to determine their bioavailability in applications in forest nurseries. Studies of alkaline cleavage of lignin at room temperature will form a basis for the use of lignin (which is a renewable raw material) for future industrial applications. He has won numerous awards, including the prestigious 1975 Benedetti‚ÄìPichler award given annually by the American Microchemical Society, as well as numerous visiting professorships at institutions around the world. He has been a prolific author with well over 400+ papers and 15 books published, many considered classics in electrochemical analysis. Petr has been a member of the editorial board of the Microchemical Journal, has published on a regular basis, and has critically reviewed many manuscripts and books. He had many master and Ph.D. students including James Rusling, William James Bover, Melek Sirin Baymak, Hayati Celik, Nuha Salem and many more. He is fluent in five languages - Czech, German, English, Polish and Serbo-Croat.

Most modern scholars claim that in Classical Athens, the archon basileus was the last remnant of monarchy. Although much of his powers, they say, had been filtered away to other institutions such as the Areopagus and later the Boule and Ecclesia, he still nominally held a high position in Athenian society, alongside the archon eponymos and the polemarchos. The archon basileus was charged with overseeing the organisation of religious rites and with presiding over trials for homicide. There is a tradition that originally the archon basileus was elected from the Athenian aristocracy every ten years. After 683 BC, the office was only held for a year, and after Solon's reforms, he was elected from the wealthiest Athenians, the Pentakosiomedimnoi (Œ†ŒµŒΩœÑŒ±Œ∫ŒøœÉŒπŒøŒºŒ≠Œ¥ŒπŒºŒΩŒøŒπ), \\"500-bushel men\\", rather than the Eupatridae (the aristocratic families). After 487 BC, the archonships were assigned by lot. It is believed the archon basileus wife, the basilinna, had to marry and have intercourse with the god Dionysos during a festival at the Boukoleion in Athens, to ensure the city's safety. It is uncertain how this was enacted. However, this was an important role for a woman who, according to Plutarch and Solon, would otherwise be confined to the house and be of little importance. During antiquity, women in Greece served as priestesses and presented oracles such as those issued at Delphi.

Meyer traveled through Iran on her own and may have been the first Western woman to travel through Iran in this way. There was a total ban on photographing in Iran at the time and she was arrested several times, but released with a warning. In Turkey she visited Kemal Atat√ºrk in his private residence and his bedroom covered in pink silk. In Irak she interviewed king Faisal in his \\"palais just outside Baghdad\\". In India the young Indira Nehru helped Meyer visit the imprisoned Mahatma Gandhi, and she described the meeting like this: ¬´Any other man would appear ridiculous in that outfit, but with regard to Gandhi all criticism is silenced. I was never particularly enthusiastic about Gandhi, but now I am completely converted. He is one of the most sympathetic humans I have ever met, he is truly a great man.¬ª Meyer also visited Syria, Mexico and Alaska. Meyer was born in T√∏nsberg to an affluent family. Her father gave her a Kodak folding camera for her travels, which seems to have led to her professional choice later. She joined the Oslo Camera Club in 1932, and then traveled to Berlin in 1937 to study photography at the Reimann School, where she studied with Walter Peterhans and Otto Croy. She worked as an apprentice for Joszef P√©csi in Budapest before returning to Norway, where she spent the war years.

Thus people speaking different languages can share certain linguistic characteristics. This is a particularly useful concept for describing, for example, hip-hop music. Hip-hop has a number of defining characteristics including musical style, clothing, and association with minorities. It also has a number of defining linguistic characteristics like rapping, rhyme and human beatboxing. These are essentially linguistic features, but they can be used in any language ‚Äì even genetically unrelated languages. Their combined use in different languages allows a kind of universal \\"language of hip-hop\\".

Harold Edward Hughes Nelson (22 May 1871 ‚Äì 25 February 1948), usually known simply as , was an artist, illustrator, designer of bookplates, advertisements and postage stamps, copper etcher and engraver, and lecturer. He signed his works with the initials N. or H.N. Life Nelson was born in Dorchester a town where Nelsons had lived since the 18th century, one of four children. He studied at both the Lambeth School of Art and the Central School of Arts and Design--at the latter under Luke Taylor.Luke Taylor, RE , an excellent etcher, enlisted at the first opportunity during the First World War and was killed in action. He lived in London for most of his life - mainly in Lambeth and Clapham - then Brockenhurst (in Hampshire), and Carshalton (in SW London) between 1902-1906. Nelson was strongly influenced by Albrecht D√ºrer and William Morris, and was prolific as a \\"black and white artist\\" specialising in medieval illustrations in a Pre-Raphaelite, Arts and Crafts and Art Nouveau style, often with elaborate ornamental borders. Nelson's provided illustrations for a number of books (see below) and also magazines such as: The Studio,The Studio, a monthly art magazine in London from 1893 well into the 1900s. See Art Nouveau (graphic-design.com) The Graphic (1915), The Sphere, The Queen, Ladies Field, London Illustrated Weekly,In 1920 he wrote an article for the London Illustrated Weekly on the origin and aims of the Society of Graphic Art. Magazine of Art (designed a calendar for 1901), Royal Academy Pictures (illustrated the cover, 1908), Old Colleges of Oxford, Aymer Vallance (illustrated the frontispiece, 1912), The Booklovers Magazine, The Bookplate, Cassells Magazine etc. He is best known for his bookplates and heraldic designs, the first one appearing in 1897, inspired by D√ºrer. Commissioned by individuals and institutions, his designs were carefully matched to the name or character of the owner.Thus, on Joan Phillip's bookplate we see Joan of Arc, on Gerald Knight's a knight in armour and on his work for St Andrew's, his local church in Carshalton, a Celtic design incorporating the Scottish saint. The Studio (magazine), in a review of 1900, wrote of his work, \\"‚Ä¶bright and spirited, while in beauty of drawing it would be hard to find their equals among modern book-plates.\\" Although Nelson trained in the traditions of William Morris, as a commercial artist he adapted his style to each new movement as it came along. In the 1920s and 1930s he worked in an Art Deco style, his most notable designs being the Wembley Lion with a 'setting sun' motif on the British Empire postage stamps of 1924 and 1925. However, his drawing of St George and the Dragon for the ¬£1 stamp for the Postal Union Congress, 1929, harks back to his earlier style.Nelson also submitted a stamp design for the 1935 Silver Jubilee of King George V, but it was rejected. Nelson illustrated several books including one authored by the Queen of Romania - \\"A Real Queen's Fairy Tales\\" under the pseudonym 'Carmen Sylva' (published in 1901). The illustrations were described in The Studio as \\"clever, powerful and beautiful\\". His other commercial activities involved designing advertisements for Cadbury's, Pears Soap, Dewar's and Selfridges etc. He also produced artwork for numerous calendars. Nelson was the Secretary of the Art Workers GuildArt Workers Guild for a number of years and several examples of his work and a pencil portrait of Nelson by the artist Ester Borough Johnson (fl. 1896-1940) can still be seen at its headquarters in Queens Square, London. There, Nelson (and his wife Margaret) became friends with Charles Robert Ashbee, the designer, author and entrepreneur who was influential in the English Arts and Crafts movement. After Nelson's death, his wife Margaret took over the duties as secretary of the Guild.

The son of two physicians, his first job was as a jackaroo in the Australian outback, before becoming a horse breaker and rodeo rider. Travelling to England, he joined the camera department of Lew Grade's Associated TeleVision on his 20th birthday. He worked his way up to directing, firstly in television and then via the world of commercials, into television movies and feature films. He directed several episodes of Space Precinct, at the time the most expensive TV series ever made. One of his early films was Killer's Moon. Killer's Moon was described in the acclaimed Shepperton Babylon as the most tasteless movie in the history of the British Cinema. In spite of comments like this, Killer's Moon won a prize for best Screenplay at the Sitges Horror Film Festival, and has since become a cult film. In the mid 1970s, Birkinshaw's production of Alice in Wonderland ran into difficulties when the RSPCA banned him from using live flamingos in the croquet scene.NBC News ‚Äì Clip name: 5112785258_s01.

His career includes a gold medal in the Olympic road race at Munich in 1972, becoming world professional road race champion in 1975, as well as winning four of the five ‚ÄúMonument‚Äù classics. He rode the Tour de France 12 times, finishing second twice and winning the stage to Alpe d'Huez on two occasions. Kuiper, Ercole Baldini and Paolo Bettini are the only riders to have won both the Olympic road race and the world professional road race. Biography Kuiper was born in Denekamp, in Overijssel province. His serious introduction to the bicycle was to and from school in Enschede. He started participating in junior races from 14 and from 19 to 23 he won 39 times as an amateur. The climax of his amateur career was gold in the Olympic road race in Munich in 1972, riding the final 40 km alone. He also won the Tour of Britain (Milk Race) that year. Professional career Kuiper turned professional in 1973 with the small German team Haro-Rokado. His career took off in 1975 when he signed for the Dutch team, Frisol, where he got more chances to shine and formed a partnership with Jos√© De Cauwer (who worked for Kuiper in races) that lasted until 1980. The 1975 season saw Kuiper become world champion at Yvoir in Belgium, winning a tough race over 260 km, with 21 ascents of a climb. Kuiper signed for TI‚ÄìRaleigh in 1976 and finished second in the 1977 Tour de France 48 seconds behind Bernard Th√©venet, who later admitted using steroids. Kuiper won the mountain stage at Alpe d‚ÄôHuez, a feat he repeated in 1978. Kuiper finished fourth in the 1979 Tour and second in 1980 behind Joop Zoetemelk. That second place ended his best years as a stage race rider and in 1981 he moved to DAF Trucks and re-invented himself as a one-day classics rider. 1981 saw him win the Tour of Flanders and the Giro di Lombardia while in 1983 he won Paris‚ÄìRoubaix at the 11th attempt. In 1985, at 36, he won Milan‚ÄìSan Remo. His retirement came on 6 November 1988 at 39 at a small cyclo-cross at Oldenzaal in his home province. Team manager After retirement Kuiper managed the small German pro squad Team Stuttgart between 1989 and 1990. In 1991 he became head of the Telekom team. In 1992 he was approached by Jim Ochowicz, manager of the American Motorola team, to become assistant team manager. Kuiper stayed with Motorola for four years. Since 1997 he has worked for the Rabobank team in public relations, as well as coaching the Dutch national team on occasions. He has two sons from his first marriage with Ine Nolten: Patrick Kuiper and Bjorn Kuiper. He lives with his second wife, Marianne, in Lonneker.

It is a part of Omaha Public Schools. History The building for William Jennings Bryan Senior High School was completed in 1971. It was named after the Nebraska politician. Bryan's history, however, extends back to 1965 when the first students entered what is now the Bryan Middle School building. That building had been designed as a junior-senior high complex. It was from there that the first Bryan senior class graduated in 1968. Omaha Public School District built the Bryan Senior High as part of the school complex to meet increasing enrollments. Bryan High's current enrollment averages 1,700 students; there are approximately 90 faculty members. 25th anniversary and other changes In 1993, the school celebrated its 25th anniversary with a time capsule for future students. The capsule will be opened in 2018. From 2000 to about 2005, Bryan went through some new renovations and additions. In 2004, the school had a new section built which houses four new classrooms. Four cottages are outside the building. In 2001, six more were added to the right side. At that time a weight room was added to the gym. Currently the other side is used as a practice area by the wrestling team. In 2004 two additional cottages were added on the side of the building. As of about 2001, Bryan High became a member of the AOF (Academy of Finance). The school was on a normal class schedule before the fall of 1994, with classes being year-long. Block scheduling was then created, with a 13-minute \\"Advisement\\" at the start of the school day. There are now four blocks and Advisement, with four lunches during 3rd block. Each block is 90 minutes long. In August 2012, eight classes a day were added again with A & B classes. In 2007 Bryan High School added new trees along the front of the building and stones to sit on. The library also went through changes; a section was transformed into rooms for assistant principals, and its entryway was extended into double doors. Music programs Omaha Bryan High School offers a variety of musical education programs, including string orchestra, marching band, concert band, jazz band, percussion ensemble, computer music/iPad ensemble, vocal ensembles, and music theater ensemble.

Biography  Heym was born in Hirschberg, Lower Silesia in 1887 to Hermann and Jenny Heym. Throughout his short life, he was constantly in conflict with social conventions. His parents, members of the Wilhemine middle class, had trouble comprehending their son's rebellious behavior. Heym's own attitude towards his parents was paradoxical; on the one hand he held a deep affection for them, but on the other he strongly resisted any attempts to suppress his individuality and autonomy. In 1900 the Heyms moved to Berlin, and there Georg began unsuccessfully attending a series of different schools. Eventually, he arrived at the Friedrich-Wilhelms-Gymnasium at Neuruppin in Brandenburg. He was very unsatisfied, and as a way to achieve some release he began writing poetry. After he graduated and went to study law at W√ºrzburg, he started writing plays as well. However, publishers largely ignored his work. In 1910 Heym met the poet and writer Simon Guttmann, who invited Heym to join the recently founded Der Neue Club, a descendant of a student society at the University of Berlin. Other members of this Club included Kurt Hiller, Jakob van Hoddis, and Erwin Loewenson (also known as Golo Gangi); often visiting were Else Lasker-Sch√ºler, Gottfried Benn, and Karl Kraus. Although the Club had no actual stated objective, its members all shared a sense of rebellion against contemporary culture and possessed a desire for political and aesthetic upheaval. The Club held \\"Neopathetisches Cabaret\\" meetings in which members presented work, and it was here that Heym first gained notice. His poetry immediately attracted praise. In January 1911, Ernst Rowohlt published Heym's first book and the only one to appear in his lifetime: Der ewige Tag (The Eternal Day). Heym later went through several judicial jobs, none of which he held for long due to his lack of respect for authority. On 16 January 1912, Heym and his friend Ernst Balcke went on a skating trip to the frozen river Havel. They never returned. A few days later their bodies were found. Appearances indicated that Balcke had fallen through the ice and Heym had attempted to save him but fell in as well. Heym remained alive for half an hour, calling out for help. His cries were heard by some nearby forestry workers, but they were unable to reach him.

They are sometimes known as ground frogs. The genus is endemic to Patagonia (Chile and Argentina). Eupsophus is the second most species-rich frog genera of Patagonia. These frogs are restricted to forested areas at southern latitudes. Reproduction In most species, the tadpoles are endotrophic (developing without external food sources) and develop in water housed in small hollows in the forest floor or holes at the end of flooded tunnels.

Horses that amble are sometimes referred to as \\"gaited\\", particularly in the United States. Ambling gaits are smoother for a rider than either the two-beat trot or pace and most can be sustained for relatively long periods, making them particularly desirable for trail riding and other tasks where a rider must spend long periods in the saddle. Historically, horses able to amble were highly desired for riding long distances on poor roads. Once roads improved and carriage travel became popular, their use declined in Europe but continued in popularity in the Americas, particularly in areas where plantation agriculture was practiced and the inspection of fields and crops necessitated long daily rides. The ability to perform an ambling gait is usually an inherited trait. In 2012, a DNA study found that horses from several gaited and harness racing breeds carried a mutation on the gene DMRT3, which controls the spinal neurological circuits related to limb movement and motion. In 2014, that mutation was found to originate in a single ancestor to all gaited horses. Some gaited breeds naturally perform these gaits from birth, others need to be trained to do them. Some breeds have individuals who can both amble and perform a trot or pace. In the Standardbred breed, the DMRT3 gene was also found in trotting horses, suggesting that it inhibits the ability to transition into a canter or gallop. Though there are differences in footfall patterns and speed of the various gaits, historically they were collectively referred to as an \\"amble\\". The many different names for these gaits reflect the nuanced differences sought by aficionados of each particular breed, with traits considered desirable in one breed sometimes discouraged in another. Gaited breeds occur in many parts of the world, but are particularly prevalent in North and South America. History The ambling horse was prized in the Middle Ages Ambling was described as early as the Hittite writings of Kikkuli.Bennett, p. 34 The amble was particularly prized in horses in the Middle Ages due to the need for people to travel long distances on poor roads. The Old High German term for a gaited horse was celtari (Modern German Zelter), cognate to Icelandic t√∂lt. English amble is a 14th-century loan from Old French, ultimately from Latin ambulare \\"to walk\\". Horse types with ambling ability included the valuable jennet and palfrey.Bennett, pp. 113, 167 By the 18th century, the amble was a topic of discussion among horse trainers in Europe, and the 1728 Cyclopedia discussed the lateral form of the gait, which is derived from the pace, and some of the training methods used to create it in a horse that did not appear to be naturally gaited. As roads improved and carriage travel became more common, followed later by railroads, riding horses that trotted became more popular in Europe; the dominant uses of riding horses came to include light cavalry, fox hunting and other types of rapid travel across country, but of more limited duration, where the gallop could be used. The amble was still prized in the Americas, particularly in the southern United States and in Latin America where plantation agriculture required riders to cover long distances every day to view fields and crops.Bennett, need page Today, ambling or gaited horses are popular amongst casual riders who seek soft-gaited, comfortable horses for pleasure riding. As a general rule, while ambling horses are able to canter, they usually are not known for speed, nor is it particularly easy for them to transition from an ambling gait into the canter or gallop. Thus, in history, where comfort for long hours in the saddle was important, ambling horses were preferred for smoothness, sure-footedness and quiet disposition. However, when speed and quick action was of greater importance, horses that trotted were more suitable due to their speed and agility.Bennett, p. 39 When horses were used in warfare, particularly during the Middle Ages, it was not uncommon for a knight to ride an ambling horse to a battle site, then switch to a war horse for galloping into the actual battle. Types of ambling gaits Paso Fino performing the \\"classic fino', a slow, isochronous lateral gait All ambling gaits have four beats. Some ambling gaits are lateral gaits, meaning that the feet on the same side of the horse move forward, but one after the other, usually in a footfall pattern of right rear, right front, left rear, left front. Others are diagonal, meaning that the feet on opposite sides of the horse move forward in sequence, usually right rear, left front, left rear, right front. A common trait of the ambling gaits is that usually only one foot is completely off the ground at any one time.Lieberman, Bobbie. \\"Easy-Gaited Horses.\\" Equus, issue 359, August, 2007, pp. 47-51. Ambling gaits are further distinguished by the timing and cadence of the footfall pattern. One distinction is whether the footfall rhythm is isochronous, four equal beats in a 1-2-3-4 rhythm; or a non-isochronous 1-2, 3-4 rhythm created by a slight pause between the groundstrike of the forefoot of one side to the rear of the other. Many breeds of horses inherit the ability to perform these gaits, which may be observable naturally from birth or may present with a minimal amount of training. Some horses without apparent inborn gaited ability can be taught to \\"gait\\" or amble. However, training usually is not successful unless there is some inherited genetic ability in the horse. Ambling gaits can be taught by slightly restraining the horse at a trot or pace. The length of the stride is kept long, but the rider asks the horse to alter its balance to break up the two strides in such a manner to produce a four-beat gait. Sometimes, this effect is accidentally produced in an attempt to create the slow two-beat jog trot desired in western pleasure competition when the horse cannot sustain a slow jog and falls into a shuffling, four beat gait described as \\"trotting in front and walking behind,\\" which is penalized in the show ring. Some horses can both trot and amble, and some horses pace in addition to the amble instead of trotting. However, pacing in gaited horses is often, though not always, discouraged. Some horses neither trot nor pace easily, but prefer their ambling gait for their standard intermediate speed. Conformation also plays a role. Horses with a longer back at the lumbosacral joint or \\"coupling\\" will find it easier to perform a lateral ambling gait, though they may also have to work harder to have proper collection. An average length back still allows a horse to perform ambling gaits, though a very short-coupled horse usually can only perform the trot. A well-laid back shoulder and somewhat horizontal hip angle favor a longer length of stride and is helpful in horses that fox trot, while a steeper shoulder angle combined with more sloping croup produce a stride more desirable in some lateral gaits such as the running walk. A particular form of ambling gait considered desirable in one breed is often penalized in another. For example, the Missouri Foxtrotter is specifically bred to perform the fox trot, a diagonal ambling gait, while the Paso Fino is bred to perform lateral gaits and sometimes is penalized for a diagonal gait, which in that breed is called trocha. Heritability and breeding Gaitedness is generally inherited, as seen in this young, untrained Peruvian Paso foal In most \\"gaited\\" breeds, an ambling gait is a hereditary trait. However, some representatives of these breeds may not always gait, and some horses of other breeds not considered \\"gaited\\" may have ambling-gaited ability, particularly with training. A 2012 DNA study of movement in Icelandic horses, harness racing horse breeds, and mice determined that a mutation on the gene DMRT3, which controls the spinal neurological circuits related to limb movement and motion, causes a premature stop codon in horses with lateral ambling gaits. This mutation may be a dominant gene, in that even one copy of the mutated allele will produce gaitedness. Horses who are homozygous for the gene may have a stronger gaited ability than those who are heterozygous. Horses can now be tested for the presence or absence of this allele. In 2012, the mutated gene was found in the Icelandic horse, the Tennessee Walking Horse, the Peruvian Paso, and the Kentucky Mountain Saddle Horse. In 2014, a new study of the DMRT3 gene, now dubbed the \\"gait keeper\\" gene, examined over 4000 horses worldwide and DNA study found that gaitedness originated in a single ancient domestic ancestor as a spontaneous genetic mutation. In 2016, a study of DMRT3 SNP in paleographic DNA located the ambling horse mutation to medieval England with subsequent spread by Vikings first to Iceland in the 10th century. Breeds known for galloping ability, including the Thoroughbred and even the wild Przewalski‚Äôs horse, do not possess the mutated form of the gene. A number of horse breeds have observed natural gaited tendencies, including the American Saddlebred, Boerperd, Icelandic horse, Missouri Fox Trotter, Paso Fino, Peruvian Paso, Racking horse, Rocky Mountain Horse, Spotted Saddle horse, and Tennessee Walking Horse. The two-beat lateral pace is also sometimes classified with the ambling gaits as an \\"alternate\\" gait, and may be linked to the same genetic mechanism as the lateral ambling gaits. The pacing horses studied were all homozygous for the DMTR3 mutation. But not all horses with the homozygous mutation could pace, suggesting other factors had to come into play for that gait to occur. Although ambling gaits are seen in some Mustangs, and other Colonial Spanish Horses, DMRT3 mutations are rarely seen in feral or wild horses. Researchers theorize that this is due to the difficulty that horses with this mutation have in moving from an ambling gait to a gallop, leading them to be easy prey for predators. Humans, however, have selectively bred for ambling horses, leading to a much more frequent occurrence of DMRT3 mutations among the human-bred horse population. Of note is that the trotting bloodlines of the Standardbred, though distinct from the pacing bloodlines, also are homozygous for the DMRT3 mutation, suggesting that it not only affects lateral gaits, but inhibits the transition to a gallop. In the studies of Icelandic horses, those animals homozygous for the DMRT3 mutation scored poorly for their ability to both trot and gallop. Researchers concluded that breeders selected away from the mutation in horses bred for sports such as dressage, show jumping, and racing at a gallop. Lateral ambling gaits Tennessee Walking Horse at the running walk Lateral gaits fall in the sequence right hind, right front, left hind, left front. They can be distinguished by whether the footfall rhythm is \\"even\\" or isochronous, four equal beats in a 1-2-3-4 rhythm; or non-isochronous, a slightly uneven 1-2, 3-4 rhythm created because the horse picks up and sets down its feet on each individual side slightly faster, creating a slight pause when switching to the opposite lateral pair of footfalls. =Running walk= The running walk is most often performed by Tennessee Walking Horses. It is a four-beat gait with the same footfall pattern as a regular, or flat, walk, but significantly faster. While a horse performing a flat walk moves at , the running walk allows the same horse to travel at . In the running walk, the horse's rear feet overstep the prints of its front feet by , with a longer overstep being more prized in the Tennessee Walking Horse breed. While performing the running walk, the horse nods its head in rhythm with its gait. Some Tennessee Walking Horses perform other variations of lateral ambling gaits, including the rack, stepping pace, fox trot and single-foot, which are allowable for pleasure riding but penalized in the show ring. =\\"Slow gaits\\"= The slow gait is a general term for several slower forms of the classic amble that follow the same general footfall pattern as the walk, in that lateral pairs of legs move forward in sequence, but the rhythm and collection of the movements are different. The common thread is that all are smooth gaits, comfortable to the rider. Terms for various slow gaits include the stepping pace and singlefoot. Some slow gaits are natural to some horses, while others are developed from the pace. The stepping pace, sometimes itself called an \\"amble,\\" is a slightly uneven lateral gait, with a non-isochronous 1-2, 3-4 sequence, while the singlefoot has an isochronous, even 1-2-3-4 rhythm. The stepping pace is faster than a running walk and extremely smooth, but not as energy-efficient.Howe, p. 34 It is a smooth gait at slower speeds, but when sped up can turn into a 2-beat pace. The United States Equestrian Federation defines the slow gait as a restrained four-beat gait, \\"derived from the pace\\" and \\"not a medium rack\\". =Rack= American Saddlebred performing the rack The rack or racking is a gait that is also known as the singlefoot or single-foot. It is an even, lateral four-beat gait. Although many breeds of horses are capable of producing this gait, it is most commonly associated with the five-gaited American Saddlebred. In the rack, the speed of an even lateral slow gait is increased, while keeping the even intervals between each beat. In the American Saddlebred show ring, the gait is performed with speed and action, appearing unrestrained, while the slow gait is expected be performed with restraint and precision. The rack is also closely associated with the Racking Horse breed. The rack, like other intermediate gaits, is smoother than the trot because the hooves hitting the ground individually rather than in pairs minimizes the force and bounce the horse transmits to the rider. To achieve this gait the horse must be in a \\"hollow position\\". This means that, instead of a rounded back as seen in dressage horses and others that work off their hind quarters, the spine is curved somewhat downward. This puts the racking horse in the best position to rack without breaking into another gait. If the rider sits back or leans slightly back, this will encourage the hollow position. This allows the hind legs to trail and makes the rack easier for the horse. The downside of this is that this position weakens the back and makes the horse less able to carry the weight of the rider without strain. =T√∂lt= Icelandic horse at the t√∂lt The t√∂lt is a four-beat lateral ambling gait mainly found in Icelandic horses. Known for its explosive acceleration and speed, it is also comfortable and ground-covering.Bongianni, entry 133 There is considerable variation in style within the gait, and thus the t√∂lt is variously compared to similar lateral gaits such as the rack of the Saddlebred, the largo of the Paso Fino, or the running walk of the Tennessee Walking Horse. Like all lateral ambling gaits, the footfall pattern is the same as the walk (left hind, left front, right hind, right front), but differs from the walk in that it can be performed at a range of speeds, from the speed of a typical fast walk up to the speed of a normal canter. Some Icelandic horses prefer to t√∂lt, while others prefer to trot; correct training can improve weak gaits, but the t√∂lt is a natural gait present from birth. Two varieties of the t√∂lt are considered incorrect by breeders. The first is an uneven gait called a \\"Pig's Pace\\" or \\"Piggy-pace\\" that is closer to a two-beat pace than a four-beat amble. The second is called a Valhopp and is a t√∂lt and canter combination most often seen in untrained young horses or horses that mix their gaits. Both varieties are normally uncomfortable to ride. The Icelandic also performs a pace called a skei√∞, flugskei√∞ or \\"flying pace\\".Edwards, pp. 194-195 The horses with a strong natural ability to perform the t√∂lt appear to be those which are heterozygous for the DMRT3 mutation. The Faroese Horse and the Nordlandshest/Lyngshest of Norway share common ancestry with the Icelandic horse and some individuals of these breeds have the capacity to t√∂lt, although it is not as commonly used. =Paso gaits= Peruvian Pasos demonstrating the lateral movement of the shoulder known as termino The Peruvian Paso and Paso Fino are two horse breeds developed in Latin America that have smooth innate intermediate gaits. Both descended from jennets that came to the Americas with the Spanish.Bennett, pp. 217 239 The Paso Fino has several speed variations called (from slowest to fastest) the paso fino, paso corto, and paso largo. All have an even 1-2-3-4 rhythm. The paso fino gait is very slow, performed mainly for horse show competition. Horses are ridden over a \\"fino strip\\", which is usually plywood set into the ground, so the judges can listen for absolute regularity of footfall. The paso corto is an ambling gait of moderate speed, similar to the singlefoot. The paso largo is similar to the rack and is the fastest speed exhibited by the breed. The speed is attained by extending the stride while maintaining cadence. Some Paso Finos may perform a diagonal gait known as trocha akin to the fox trot.Bennett, p. 217 Many Paso Fino trainers in the USA discourage their horses from using diagonal gaits, emphasizing the lateral gaits exclusively, though in Colombia, the diagonal gait is more often considered acceptable. The Peruvian Paso has an even lateral gait known as the paso llano, which has the same footfall sequence as the running walk, and is characterized by an elongated and lateral motion of the shoulder known as termino. The faster ambling gait of the Peruvian Paso is called the sobreandando and is slightly uneven, similar to the stepping pace. The Peruvian Paso may also fall into a diagonal gait, the pasitrote, as well as a pace-like gait, the huachano, both discouraged in the breed. =Other lateral ambling gaits= The Marwari and Kathiawari breeds of India often exhibit a natural lateral ambling gait, called the revaal,Edwards, pp. 160-163 aphcal,Dutson, pp. 160-164 or rehwal. The Mangalarga Marchador performs the marcha picada, a four-beat lateral gait, similar to a stepping pace or singlefoot. The breed also performs a four-beat diagonal gait. The picada, which means \\"light touch\\" in Portuguese, is usually the smoother of the two ambling gaits performed by the breed, because the lateral movement creates little vertical momentum, and is similar to the paso llano of the Peruvian Paso. Diagonal ambling gaits This Mangalarga Marchador is exhibiting a diagonal ambling gait The only diagonal ambling gait is called the fox trot in English, though it is given other names in other countries.Ziegler, p. 134 The diagonal footfalls are usually slightly uneven, occurring in \\"couplets\\" of a 1-2, 3-4 rhythm that gives the rider a slight forward and back sensation when riding. They are considered physically easier on the horse than the lateral gaits as less hollowing of the back occurs when the horse is in the gait. Diagonal four beat gaits are classified as an alternative ambling gait, even though derived from the trot rather than the pace. The genetic mechanism that allows diagonal ambling gaits appears to be the same gene responsible for lateral ambling gaits. The fox trot is most often associated with the Missouri Fox Trotter breed, but is also seen in other breeds. The fox trot is a four- beat broken diagonal gait in which the front foot of the diagonal pair lands before the hind, eliminating the moment of suspension and giving a smooth ride said to also be sure-footed. The gait is sometimes described as having the horse walk with the front feet and trot with the back. In a fox trot, the horse must keep one front foot on the ground at all times and display a sliding motion with the hind legs. Other gaited breeds are able to perform the fox trot and it is one of the only ambling gaits that can be taught to horses that are not naturally gaited. The gait creates an optical illusion that a horse is walking in front and trotting behind. The Mangalarga Marchador performs the marcha batida, where the feet move diagonally, in a manner similar to a fox trot, but with a brief period of quadrupedal support where all four feet are planted. Batida means \\"to hit\\". The Carolina Marsh Tacky, another breed with Spanish heritage, exhibits a four-beat diagonal ambling gait comparable to the marcha batida. The trocha gait of the Paso Fino and the pasitrote of the Peruvian Paso are also diagonal ambling gaits. They too are similar to the fox trot, though the trocha has shorter steps than the fox trot and is about the same speed as the lateral paso corto. The trocha is more commonly seen in the Colombian strains of the Paso Fino.Ziegler, pp. 134, 135 References Sources   * Category:Horse gaits Category:wikipedia articles containing unlinked shortened footnotes ","title":"Ambling gait"},{"id":"3688329","text":"Carroll Wayne Dale (born April 24, 1938) is a former American football wide receiver.

The couple had two children, a daughter and an adopted orphan from Bolivia. Public life With the election of Walter Scheel to the office of the Federal President on 15 May 1974, a new life of public service began for Mildred Scheel, with new responsibilities and obligations. According to the tradition of former German First Ladies Elly Heuss-Knapp and Wilhelmine L√ºbke (wife of the late president Heinrich L√ºbke), Dr. Scheel chose a social and public health role: the fight against cancer. \\"This can be more successful, only if all the citizens show solidarity in this important fight‚Äù, said Scheel in an announcement. She was very active in mobilizing the German public to make donations for this ‚Äúhealth-project to benefit everybody‚Äù. Even while on state visits, she collected donations for the organization. In 1980, long time friend Andy Warhol immortalized her image with a limited edition screen-print published to raise funds for the German Cancer Aid. Her life's work With the establishment of the German Cancer Aid in 1974, the foundation stone was laid for the future non-profit life work of Mildred Scheel. From the very beginning, her organization was marked by the fact that no tax money was expected and no donations were ever accepted from the pharmaceutical industry. \\"We must be completely independent of political and economic interests. We only have to serve the people's health and remain committed\\", was her credo. Mildred Scheel broke the taboo in society and started an open and free public discussion about cancer in general, and especially about uterine cancer, breast cancer and prostate cancer in particular. Shortly after founding the German Cancer Aid, Mildred Scheel had succeeded in winning over the medical profession to cooperate in these efforts. She initiated the first scientific medical conferences of cancer experts from Europe, United States and Asia. In 1985 she died of complications from cancer. She kept the diagnosis secret from everybody except her family and very close friends. The Honorary grave of Mildred Scheel is located at the Old Cemetery in Bonn. Honors and awards The major honors awarded to Mildred Scheel include more than 20 state medals of honor. She received the 1976 German Media Prize Bambi. In the following years 1977, 1978 and 1979 she was elected the Woman of the Year in Germany. Several institutions, schools and streets have been named after her: for instance, in the cities of Dresden, Solingen, Neuss and Calw. In 2008, the city of Munich posthumously honored the founder of German Cancer Aid by naming a street in the famous Schwabing district ‚ÄûMildred-Scheel-Bogen‚Äù (by the decision of the City Council on 14 February 2008). It is also recalled that the doctor lived, studied and worked in the Bavarian capital Munich for many years.

The museum was established in 1909 by the Houston Museum and Scientific Society, an organization whose goals were to provide a free institution for the people of Houston focusing on education and science. Museum attendance totals over two million visitors each year. The museum complex consists of a central facility with four floors of natural science halls and exhibits, the Burke Baker Planetarium, the Cockrell Butterfly Center, and the Wortham Giant Screen Theatre (formerly known as the Wortham IMAX Theatre). The museum is one of the most popular in the United States and ranks just below New York City's American Museum of Natural History and Metropolitan Museum of Art and the M. H. de Young Memorial Museum in San Francisco in most attendance amongst non-Smithsonian museums.Berger, Eric. (2006, November 20). \\"Incredible growth at the Houston Museum of Natural Science\\". Houston Chronicle. Much of the museum's popularity is attributed to its large number of special or guest exhibits. History The initial museum organization was called the Houston Museum and Scientific Society, Inc., and was created in 1909. The museum's primary collection was acquired between 1914 and 1930. This included the purchase of a natural-history collection assembled by Henry Philemon Attwater and a donation from collector John Milsaps, the latter of which formed the core of the museum's gem and mineral collection.Wilson, Wendell E., Bartsch, Joel A., Mauthner, Mark. (2004). Masterpieces of the Mineral World: Treasures from the Houston Museum of Natural Science. The Mineralogical Record in association with Harry N. Abrams, Inc. p. 7. . First housed in Houston's city auditorium, the collection was subsequently housed in the Central Library for seven years, and then at a site in the Houston Zoo in 1929. The museum's now wide-ranging education programs began in 1947 and, in its second year, hosted 12,000 children.http://www.hmnspress.org/HMNS_History.aspx Morian Hall of Paleontology The museum was officially renamed the Houston Museum of Natural Science in 1960. Construction of the current facility in Hermann Park began in 1964 and was completed in 1969.Kleiner, Diana J., Holm, Patricia. \\"Houston Museum of Natural Science\\". (2010, February 11). Texas State Historical Association, Retrieved 1 June 2014. By the 1980s, the museum's permanent displays included a dinosaur exhibit, a space museum, and exhibits on geology, biology, petroleum science, technology, and geography. In 1988, the Challenger Learning Center was opened in memory of the Space Shuttle Challenger crewmembers that were lost during the shuttle's tenth mission. The center's aim is to teach visitors about space exploration. The Wortham IMAX Theatre and the offsite George Observatory were opened in 1989. Museum attendance was more than one million visitors in 1990. HMNS trustees determined that new state-of- the-art facilities, additional space, and renovations to current exhibits were needed because of the increased attendance. Between 1991 and 1994, a number of exhibit halls were renovated and the expansion of the Sterling Hall of Research was completed. The Cockrell Butterfly Center and the Brown Hall of Entomology opened in July 1994. Telfair, Sugar Land, Texas. In March 2007, the museum opened the HMNS Woodlands X-ploration Station, located in the Woodlands Mall. The facility was home to an interactive Dig Pit, where children could excavate a mock Triceretops, a variety of living exhibits, fossils, and minerals. The Woodlands location closed on September 7, 2009, less than a month before HMNS opened a satellite museum in Sugar Land, Texas. HMNS celebrated its 100th year in 2009. During that year, the museum offered a multitude of family programs, lectures, free events, and kids' classes as part of the \\"Fun Hundred\\" celebration.http://www.hmns.org/see_do/hmns_at_one_hundred/the_fun_100.asp?r=1 On October 3, 2009, HMNS opened its satellite museum in Telfair, Sugar Land. The building and surrounding land that became HMNS at Sugar Land was once part of the Central Unit, a Texas Department of Criminal Justice prison that had been unoccupied for several decades. In March 2012, the Wortham IMAX Theatre was converted from 70 mm film to 3D digital and renamed the Wortham Giant Screen Theatre.http://www.screentrademagazine.com/#/qube-release/4562013681 In June 2012, HMNS opened a new 230,000 square foot wing to house its paleontology hall, more than doubling the size of the original museum.

He was recognised as the spiritual leader of Flemish nationalism by the ideology's adherents.Ingo Haar, Michael Fahlbusch, German Scholars and Ethnic Cleansing, 1919‚Äì1945, Berghahn Books, 2006, p. 195 Early years Born in Ardooie in West Flanders, Belgium to a Catholic family, he began training to be a priest at the minor seminary in Roeselare in 1886, before moving on to Bruges in 1892 to complete his studies. He was ordained in 1897 and then continued his studies at the Friedrich Schiller University of Jena in Germany. Nationalist leader Verschaeve (by Jos De Swert, 1923) He returned to Belgium in 1911 to become a parish priest at Alveringem in West Flanders. Whilst here he became involved in the pacifist movement after the outbreak of the First World War. He also was involved in the development of the Frontbeweging, a Flemish autonomous group that eventually became the Frontpartij.Karen Dale Shelby, Conflicted Nationalism and World War I in Belgium: Memory and Museum Design, ProQuest, 2008, pp. 37‚Äì38 Along with August Borms, Verschaeve was the leading representative of the tendency within the Front Movement that felt Flemish aims might be aided by working with Germany, in contrast to the other wing that felt fighting for Belgium would make the Flemish case easier to advance.Shelby, Conflicted Nationalism and World War I in Belgium, p. 54 On 12 August 1917 Verschaeve penned a second so-called \\"Open Letter\\" calling for better rights for beleaguered Flemish servicemen. Following a letter from a month earlier, Verschaeve's missive was noted for its more militant language which included an attack on the king for his failure to respond to the first letter. It marked the beginning of a widening gulf between the monarchy and the far right of Flemish nationalism.Herman Van Goethem, Belgium and the Monarchy: From National Independence to National Disintegration, Asp/Vubpress/Upa, 2011, pp. 115‚Äì116 In 1916 he also became president of a committee that sought to build a memorial to Flemish servicemen.Shelby, Conflicted Nationalism and World War I in Belgium, p. 58 After the war this aim was realised with the building of the Yser Tower memorial, with Verschaeve ceremonially laying the first stone on 7 July 1928.Shelby, Conflicted Nationalism and World War I in Belgium, p. 75 Second World War Dismissed as chaplain in 1939,Shelby, Conflicted Nationalism and World War I in Belgium, p. 103 Verschaeve, who had long been sympathetic to Germany, wrote Het Uur van Vlaanderen in 1940 in which he articulated feelings of sympathy among the Flemish people for Nazi Germany, especially because of his Romantic admiration for German imperial culture as embodied in Richard Wagner.Shelby, Conflicted Nationalism and World War I in Belgium, p. 104 After the German occupation of Belgium, Verschaeve was appointed to a body set up by the Nazis to deal with Flemish culture. He also became involved with recruitment to the Flemish Legion in 1941. Verschaeve was convinced the Soviet Union was the greatest danger to peace and culture in Europe; he was strongly anti-communism and a convinced supporter of Nazism. In 1944 he held a meeting with SS-Reichsf√ºhrer Heinrich Himmler about the Flemish question, although it achieved little as the Allied advance into Belgium was not far away, and Flanders would soon be liberated from Nazi control. Verschaeve told Himmler at this meeting that, while he rejected Nazi paganism, he thought Nazism could become complementary to the salvific message of the Church, as long as it remained political and activist. Until the end of the successful Allied offensive against the Nazi Wehrmacht in western Belgium, Verschaeve continued calling upon young Flemish, Catholic, adolescent boys to volunteer in the Waffen-SS foreign legions against Stalin and \\"Satanic Bolshevism\\".Els Witte, Jan Craeybeckx, Alain Meynen, Political History of Belgium: From 1830 Onwards, Asp/Vubpress/Upa, 2010, p. 206 Death He fled to Austria in 1945. He was condemned to death in absentia by a Belgian court, but survived in Austria until 1949, when he died of a heart attack at the vicarage of the Tyrolean town Solbad Hall,Shelby, Conflicted Nationalism and World War I in Belgium, p. 105 and was buried there. In 1973 members of the neo-Nazi Vlaamse Militanten Orde dug up his remains and reburied them in Flanders. He remains a celebrated figure amongst the more extreme ends of Flemish nationalism, and a symbol of disgraceful Flemish nationalism to French-speaking Catholics.Shelby, Conflicted Nationalism and World War I in Belgium, p. 106 Streets in Kortrijk , Lanaken and Breendonk were named after him; in 2019-2020 the local councils decided to rename it. Writing Verschaeve wrote extensively on philosophy, adopting a dramatic, poetic writing style. He was also known as a poet and playwright. As an author he wrote a number of plays dealing with historical and Biblical characters with Judas (1919) and Maria-Magdalena (1930) now widely held to be the best works from a prolific but sketchy output.John Gassner, The Reader's Encyclopedia of World Drama, Courier Dover Publications,, 2002, p. 62 His major works include: * Jacob van Artevelde (1911) * Zeesymphonie√´n (1911) * Ferdinand Verbiest (1912) * De schoonheid van het evangelie (1913) * Passieverhaal (1913) * Philips van Artevelde (1913) * Nocturnen (1916‚Äì1924) * Judas (1917) * Het mysterie (1920) * Uren bewondering voor groote kunstwerken (1920‚Äì1922) * Maria Magdalena (1928) * De Kruisboom (1929) * Elijah (1936) * Nocturnen (1936) * Rubens, Vlaanderens Spectrum (1938) * Jezus (1939) * Eeuwige gestalten (1944) References Category:1874 births Category:1949 deaths Category:Anti‚ÄìWorld War I activists Category:Belgian collaborators with Nazi Germany Category:Flemish activists Category:Flemish priests Category:Flemish writers Category:Belgian Roman Catholic priests Category:Members of the clergy convicted of crimes Category:People from Alveringem Category:People from Ardooie Category:Belgian anti-communists Category:Flemish nationalists Category:Catholicism and far- right politics Category:People sentenced to death in absentia Category:Christian fascists ","title":"Cyriel Verschaeve"},{"id":"3688406","text":"Stirling County may refer to: * Stirling County RFC * Stirling County, Western Australia ","title":"Stirling County"},{"id":"3688412","text":"Archizoom for Poltronova, Sofa Superonda, 1967 Archizoom Associati was a design studio from Florence, Italy founded in 1966.

The casino caters to low rollers, and features low table minimums for roulette, craps, and blackjack. History =Nob Hill (1978-1992)= Before 1992, this property neighbored the Sands Hotel Casino and contained several motels, restaurants and casinos: Bill's Place, Bon Aire Motel, Motor Inn Motel, Louigi's Charcoal Broiler, and Frank Musso's Restaurant. In the 1960s, a Denny's restaurant was built here. What is now Casino Royale's hotel opened in the spring of 1964 as the Caravan Motor Hotel. The 164-room establishment was developed by local construction firm Heers Bros, Inc. By 1968, the hotel was affiliated with the Travelodge chain and was known as the Caravan Travelodge. In July 1978, the Nob Hill Casino opened between the Denny's and Travelodge. It was operated by a group of four partners who also owned the nearby Holiday Casino (now Harrah's), led by Claudine Williams. In 1983, Holiday Inns purchased the operating business of the Nob Hill, as part of a package deal in which it also acquired full ownership of the Holiday Casino. The Nob Hill closed on November 26, 1990, because the lease on the property expired. =Casino Royale (1992-present)= On January 1, 1992, the Nob Hill was reopened by Tommy Elardi as the Casino Royale, with of gaming space with 225 slot machines and 4 table games. Elardi was the general manager and co- owner of the Frontier casino hotel. Elardi purchased the casino and the hotel for $17 million. From 1993 to 1995, he renovated the property, expanding the casino to , adding a parking garage, and connecting the casino, hotel, and Denny's with a single facade. From its opening, the Casino Royale was subjected to picketing by members of the Culinary Workers Union because of its shared ownership with the Frontier hotel, where workers had been on strike since September 1991. Picketing continued until 1998, when the strike was resolved by the Elardi family's sale of the Frontier. In January 2013, the property was rebranded as part of the Best Western hotel chain. In 2014, the Denny's at the north side of the building, which had been the restaurant chain's highest-volume location, was demolished and replaced with a two-story, $9-million addition, with a Walgreens drug store on the ground floor, and a new Denny's on the second floor. The project also added a White Castle burger restaurant, which opened with great fanfare as the chain's first location in the Western United States. Gaming The casino until recently offered 100 times odds on craps at all times. Casino Royale now offers 100 times odds only when offering a $5 minimum bet (usually weekends), and offers 20 times odds when offering a $3 minimum bet \\"at selected dates and times\\" (usually weekdays). It is known for its promotional slot play. Timeshare promotions in Las Vegas often give out Casino Royale slot play, to be used at specific machines. In the late 1990s, Casino Royale had the highest odds allowed in craps. The game was a 50 cent minimum bet game, which allowed a player to place 100 times more in the odd bet. It was not uncommon to see 50 cent bets with $25 to $50 odds bets. This was when the rest of the Strip was allowed double to 10 times odds.

A relative latecomer to the sport, Cowan did not play football until he was 17 and was 22 by the time he turned professional. He made his league debut for Doncaster Rovers in 1923, and signed for First Division Manchester City the following season. Cowan played centre half for Manchester City for 11 seasons, captaining the team in the early to mid-1930s. He is the only player to have represented Manchester City in three FA Cup finals, as a runner-up in 1926 and 1933, and as a winner in 1934. Internationally, he gained three England caps between 1926 and 1931. In total he played 407 times for Manchester City, putting him 12th in terms of all-time appearances. In 1935, he transferred to Bradford City, and subsequently moved to Mossley as player- manager. In 1938, Cowan joined Brighton & Hove Albion as a coach, and set up a physiotherapy business. He returned to Manchester City as manager in 1946, winning the Second Division in his only season in charge. He continued to work in sports and physiotherapy until his death in 1964. Football career =Early career= Cowan was born on 10 May 1901 in Chesterfield, but moved further north in his early years and was raised in Adwick le Street near Doncaster.James, The Official Manchester City Hall of Fame, p. 152. He did not play football as a child, only gaining an interest in the sport when he took part in a game at a local park aged 17. He then started to play for local teams, including Adwick Juniors, Bullcroft Main Colliery and Denaby United and had an unsuccessful trial at Huddersfield Town. In 1923, Cowan gained his first professional contract following a successful trial at his local league club, Doncaster Rovers of the Third Division (North). Despite playing as a defender, during his time at Doncaster he scored regularly, including a hat- trick of headed goals against Halifax Town in March 1924. His performances gained the attention of bigger clubs, and in December 1924 he joined Manchester City, who sought a successor to the likes of Mick Hamill and Max Woosnam. =Manchester City= Cowan made his Manchester City debut in a 2‚Äì2 draw against Birmingham City on 20 December 1924, and scored his first goal for the club two weeks later, against Nottingham Forest. He played in all but one of the remaining league matches that season, 21 in total. Starting all but four of Manchester City's matches in the 1925‚Äì26 season, Cowan was a key part of the team which reached the 1926 FA Cup Final, winning several ties by wide margins en route. However, in the final City were beaten 1‚Äì0 by Bolton Wanderers. Further disappointment followed in the league, when after a campaign characterised by erratic form, City were relegated on the final day of the season. By this time Cowan's reputation as a competent centre-back had grown, and he received an international call-up. He made his England debut on 24 May 1926 playing an unfamiliar left-half role in a 5‚Äì3 win against Belgium. By 1931, he had earned three international caps, the others gained in matches against France and Austria. He also made appearances for the Football League team, including a trial match against England in 1931. In the 1926‚Äì27 season, Cowan made 27 appearances as his club sought an immediate return to the top division. The race for promotion went to the final match, with Manchester City and Portsmouth both in contention for the second of the two promotion places. Cowan played in a resounding City win, an 8‚Äì0 victory against Bradford City. The watching crowd believed the result to be sufficient for promotion, but Portsmouth's match had been delayed by 15 minutes and was still in progress. A late Portsmouth goal meant the final scoreline in their match was a 5‚Äì1 win, enough to give Portsmouth second place on goal average by a margin of one two- hundredth of a goal.James, Manchester City ‚Äì The Complete Record, p. 116. The club won the Second Division championship the following season, gaining promotion to the top flight. The Second Division championship was Cowan's first honour in professional football. In the early 1930s, Cowan became Manchester City captain, succeeding Jimmy McMullan. During his captaincy the club reached two further FA Cup Finals. The first of these was in 1933, against Everton. During the match Cowan was up against Everton captain Dixie Dean. Both players were renowned for their heading ability. Matt Busby claimed that Cowan could \\"head a ball as far as most of us could kick it\\",James, Manchester City ‚Äì The Complete Record, p. 170. but Dean prevailed in the aerial battle, scoring Everton's second goal with a header. The Daily Mail observed that Dean's presence gave Cowan a dilemma: \\"He was torn between a determination not to leave Dean and a desire to help his forwards. He broke down between the two.\\" p136 Everton were 3‚Äì0 victors, but when Cowan received his runner's up medal from the Duke of York, he remarked that he would come back next year to win.Some sources mistakenly state that the remark was made to King George V, who did not attend the 1933 final. True to Cowan's word, City returned to Wembley the following year. In the 1934 FA Cup Final, Cowan became the first and thus far only Manchester City player to represent the club in three FA Cup finals.James, The Official Manchester City Hall of Fame, p. 153. He captained City to a 2‚Äì1 victory over Portsmouth. As team captain Cowan held primary responsibility for motivating his fellow players and match tactics. This was typical for a captain of his era, as managers of the period were chiefly administrators who had little input into coaching and tactics. Cowan's final season at Maine Road was 1934‚Äì35, in which he was ever-present. His final match for the club was a 5‚Äì0 defeat of Wolverhampton Wanderers on 4 May 1935.James, Manchester City ‚Äì The Complete Record, p. 348. In total he made 407 appearances for Manchester City, scoring 24 goals. As of 2008 he ranks 12th all-time for Manchester City appearances. Bob Donnelly was signed to replace him in the 1935 close season, and Bradford City signed Cowan for a fee of ¬£2,000 in October 1935. At the time the transfer fee was the second highest ever paid by the club.James, The Official Manchester City Hall of Fame, p. 156. =Bradford City= Bradford City were struggling in the Second Division at the time of Cowan's signing, having won just one of their first ten games of the 1935‚Äì36 season. Cowan made his debut for them on 19 October 1935 in a 2‚Äì2 draw with Swindon Town, but it was not until Cowan's third game that Bradford won for the second time that season. Cowan missed just three of the club's remaining fixtures that season, playing 29 times in the league and three in the FA Cup as City finished 12th. The following season, City again struggled. Cowan missed just one of the first 23 games, but after Christmas, he was restricted to just six; and without Cowan, Bradford finished 21st and were relegated to the Third Division (North). =Managerial career= In 1937, Cowan was appointed player-manager at Mossley. He led the club to the seventh place in the Cheshire League and to the Manchester Challenge Shield title. On the pitch, he played 39 matches and scored one goal. At the end of the season Cowan resigned to join Brighton & Hove Albion coaching staff. In October 1945, a shortage of players resulted in Cowan taking to the field in a wartime match against Bournemouth. Aged 44 years and 156 days, he became the oldest ever Brighton player. While at Brighton, Cowan started a physiotherapy business based near the Goldstone Ground. In November 1946, Cowan became Manchester City manager, succeeding Wilf Wild, who moved to a purely administrative role. Cowan had been known for his motivational skills as a player, and was part of a new generation of managers who took responsibility for tactics and team selection, of which Cowan's contemporary and former teammate Matt Busby became the most well-known. Cowan was given a salary of ¬£2,000, and came to an agreement whereby he spent part of the week with the Manchester City team and part looking after his business interests in Brighton.James, Manchester City ‚Äì The Complete Record, p. 243. His first match as manager was a 3‚Äì0 win against Newport County, and the team then embarked upon a run of 19 matches without defeat. Despite achieving the Division Two title in his first season in charge, Cowan resigned in June 1947 as his commute from Brighton caused tension with club officials.James, Manchester City ‚Äì The Complete Record, p. 245. Post-football Cowan later worked as a physiotherapist for cricket club Sussex CCC and ice hockey team Brighton Tigers. As a trainer with the Tigers he was named in the British National League All Star team for three years running from 1956 to 1958. He died on 4 October 1964 aged 63, when he suffered a heart attack, while refereeing a football charity match in aid of Sussex wicket keeper Jim Parks. He left behind a widow and one son. In 2004, he was elected to Manchester City's Hall of Fame. A street near Manchester City's former ground Maine Road, Sam Cowan Close, is named in his honour.James, The Official Manchester City Hall of Fame, p. 158.

The film was written by Burt Kennedy and produced by John Wayne's Batjac Productions. Plot Ben Stride (Randolph Scott) walks into a desert cave encampment during a nighttime rainstorm. He encounters two men taking shelter next to a fire and asks to join them. Stride tells the men he is from the town of Silver Springs, which provokes a mysterious reaction from the two men. They discuss a robbery and murder that recently occurred there. The men become suspicious of Stride, and when they realize his intentions, he guns them down. The following day Stride tracks someone through the Arizona wilderness and comes upon a wagon stuck in the mud. Stride uses the two horses he confiscated from the men at the encampment to help pull the wagon clear, and the wagon's owners, John and Annie Greer, are grateful. Travelers from Kansas City, they admit they are inexperienced at frontier life and ask Stride to ride with them as they head south to the border town of Flora Vista on their way west to California. Greer says he hopes to find a sales job there, but has been taking odd jobs along the way. The mention of Flora Vista arouses Stride's curiosity and he agrees to take them to the border. As the trio travels, Annie shows a growing attraction to Stride. At one point they are stopped by a US Army detail, whose commanding officer (Stuart Whitman) tells them to go back, as Chiricahua Apache have been spotted in the area and he cannot guarantee their safety. Stride and the Greers travel on, finding a stagecoach relay station and encountering Bill Masters (Lee Marvin) and Clete (Don Barry), two former nemeses of Stride's. As they all spend the night at the station, Masters tells the Greers that Stride was once the sheriff of Silver Springs, and his wife was killed during the robbery of the Wells Fargo freight office. Stride has been tracking and killing the seven men who performed the robbery, and Masters intends to abscond with the $20,000 dollars in gold they stole once Stride has accomplished his task. Annie feels sympathy for Stride, who confesses that he feels guilty about his wife's death because at the time he was no longer sheriff and didn't have another job, so she took one at the freight office and was working the night of the incident. Before the wagon heads out of the station, with Masters and Clete tagging along opportunistically, they are met by Chiricahua warriors. The Apache leave when Stride gives up one of the horses to the hungry tribesmen. The group encounters one of the Wells Fargo robbers, who is being chased by Indians. Unaware of the man's part in the robbery, Stride saves him from the Apache. The man, however, recognizes Stride and nearly kills him, but Stride is saved when Masters shoots the man in the back. One night, Masters \\"reminisces\\" about a woman stolen away from her husband by a tall stranger, clearly suggesting that Stride is doing just that with Annie Greer. Furious at Masters's impropriety, Stride sends Masters and Clete away into the night. Masters and Clete reach Flora Vista ahead of the wagon, and they meet with the Wells Fargo bandits waiting for delivery of their gold. Masters tells their leader, Payte Bodeen (John Larch), that Stride is heading in their direction to kill all of them and avenge his wife's death. Bodeen dispatches two of the bandits to meet Stride before he can reach Flora Vista. Meanwhile, Stride leaves Greer and Annie, telling them to continue on without him. Stride rides ahead into a canyon alone and is ambushed by the two bank robbers but kills them both. Wounded in the leg, Stride is knocked unconscious while trying to ride away with one of the bandits' horses. Bodeen tells Masters that Greer is the man he paid to deliver the gold from the robbery to Flora Vista, and Masters berates himself for letting this escape him. Meantime, Greer and Annie's conversation gets overheard by Stride who sneaks up on them, having recovered consciousness despite a blow on his forehead leaving a wound. Greer has admitted to his wife and unwillingly to Stride that he was paid $500 to deliver the Wells Fargo box containing the gold hidden in the wagon. Stride takes the gold away from Greer to draw the rest of the bandits out from town, and Greer and Annie head into Flora Vista to notify the local sheriff. Greer arrives in town without the gold, telling Bodeen that Stride has it, and as he walks down the street toward the sheriff's office, Bodeen guns him down. The last two bandits, Bodeen and Clint, ride out to confront Stride.Stride shoots Clint but Bodeen is surpringsingly killed by Masters and Clete having shown up in the Canyon. Masters, blinded by greed, then kills his companion Clete and walks out into the clearing where Stride has placed the box of gold. They face off, and Stride kills Masters before he can pull his guns. Stride returns the gold to Wells Fargo and tells Annie that he is going to take a job as a deputy sheriff in Silver Springs. He puts her on a stagecoach bound for California, then rides away. Annie, however, tells the stage driver she is not going.

It was Kennedy's first film script. However, Wayne was locked into doing The Searchers for John Ford. According to Kennedy, Wayne wasn't particularly interested in the script until he became aware that Robert Mitchum's representatives were interested in it, at which point Wayne perked up and suggested going to Warners and casting Randolph Scott instead. Scott insisted on Budd Boetticher as the director. As with their previous collaboration, Bullfighter and the Lady, Wayne, in his role as producer, recut Seven Men From Now without Boetticher's approval, although it has since been restored to the director's original vision. Seven Men from Now was the first in a seven-film collaboration between Scott, Boetticher, and producer Harry Joe Brown, with five of the films written by Kennedy. The movie was shot in the Alabama Hills and other locations near Lone Pine, California in the last months of 1955. Gail Russell was cast as the female lead due to her previous work with Wayne in Angel and the Badman and Wake of the Red Witch, which had also included having an affair. She had not worked on a movie for nearly five years prior to Seven Men from Now, due to her struggles with stage-fright- induced alcoholism. Boetticher worked very hard to keep her from drinking during the filming.

Vermont Transit Lines (VTL) was a bus carrier company serving New England. Founded in 1929 by William Appleyard, it originally linked the communities of Barre and Burlington, Vermont, with stops along the route. VTL grew to add destinations throughout the state, and added routes to Montreal, Quebec; to Boston and Springfield, Massachusetts; and to Maine and New Hampshire.

Identity and livery For most of the company's history, Vermont Transit's identity has been closely tied to the state of Vermont. Drivers wore uniforms in Vermont's state colors of green and gold, with a cloisonne tie clasp of the Vermont coat of arms. The fleet of buses were painted in a combination of green, gold and black, and several displayed the running greyhound logo albeit in green outline. Until consolidation with Greyhound Lines, seats were upholstered in a custom woven twill of green, gold, and black. Equipment Like its parent company, Vermont Transit Lines operated similar equipment with most buses in its fleet supplied by Motor Coach Industries, and some by the Belgian coach builder Van Hool.

The original chapel, a wood building, was completed in 1195. It was replaced by a brick church in the 14th century, which was eventually destroyed by fire in 1842. The church was completely rebuilt by 1874, and was the tallest building in the world from 1874 to 1876. The bombing of Hamburg in World War II destroyed the bulk of the church. The removal of the rubble left only its crypt, its site and tall-spired tower, largely hollow save for a large set of bells. These ruins continue to serve as a memorial and an important architectural landmark. When Hamburg residents mention the Nikolaikirche, it is generally to this church that they are referring, and not the new Hauptkirche dedicated to Saint Nicholas in the Harvestehude district. The remains of the old church are the second-tallest structure in Hamburg. In 2005, an elevator was installed to a platform. History =Older structures= With the founding of the Nikolai settlement and a harbor on the Alster in the 12th century, a chapel dedicated to Saint Nicholas, patron saint of sailors, was erected. This wood building was the second church in Hamburg, after St. Mary's Cathedral. In 1335, some years before the onslaught of the Black Death, construction on a new brick building began. The structure was to be a three-naved hall church in the typical North German Brick Gothic style. This building stood until the middle of the 19th century, undergoing changes, expansions, and withstanding several partial destructions. The tower, which was erected in 1517, burned down in 1589. The tower built to replace it collapsed in 1644. The last tower of the old Church of St. Nicholas was designed by Peter Marquardt. The Marquardt tower had a height of , and with its characteristic dome was a landmark of the city and jewel of its skyline. As the center of one of the four Hamburg parishes, the Church of St. Nicholas was heavily involved in all of the theological debates that were fought out in the city, especially during the Reformation. After the minister Henning Kissenbr√ºgge resigned in 1524, the residents chose as minister Johannes Bugenhagen, a profiled Reformer and confidant to Martin Luther. The conservative city council was able to prevent his appointment by making Kissenbr√ºgge stay. However, they could not stop the general wave of elected Lutheran ministers in Hamburg; in the Church of St. Nicholas, Johann Zegenhagen was appointed after Kissenbr√ºgge's final departure. The Reformation was completed peacefully, and in 1528 Bugenhagen appeared in Hamburg and became the preacher at the Church of St. Nicholas. He is known for establishing a church order in Hamburg which regulated finances and other church affairs such as the school curriculum. This order continued for 200 years. The old Church of St. Nicholas was the first large public building to burn in the Great Fire of Hamburg of May 1842. The destruction of the Church of St. Nicholas is described by chroniclers as a particularly moving event for the citizens. It was the first large building to burn, and was an indication of how catastrophic the fire would become. On 5 May, the noon service held by preacher Wendt, who stood in for the minister Carl Moenckeberg, had to be cut short and ended with an intercessory prayer for the saving of the church. One obviously did not count on the loss of the church as most art treasures were not saved. The tower was engulfed by the fire at about four o'clock in the afternoon. Despite desperate efforts, it was not possible to contain the fire due to the equipment of the day, which did not allow water to be carried in sufficient quantity to the heights of the tower. It finally collapsed, setting the nave on fire and burning it completely. =Neo-Gothic construction= Right: The neo-Gothic church. Left: the tower that survived. Shortly after the fire, the church was rebuilt again. In 1843, a so-called \\"shilling collection\\" was started, and in 1844 there was an architectural competition, won by the architect Gottfried Semper (a native of nearby Altona) with the draft of a Romanesque domed structure. His design, however, was not realized, as it did not fit into Hamburg's townscape. Shortly before this time, the completion of the medieval Cologne cathedral in 1842 had led to a Gothic revival in Germany. Hamburg's own medieval cathedral had been demolished in 1805. The English architect George Gilbert Scott (father of George Gilbert Scott, Jr.), who was an expert in the restoration of medieval churches and an advocate of the Gothic architectural style, was commissioned to devise a new design. He designed an nave, with a vault. The architecture was strongly influenced by French and English Gothic styles, though the pointed spire is typically German. The amount of sculptures made from sandstone in the interior and on the tower was unusual. The new church was built to the southeast, a short distance from the old location, where the Neue Burg (New Castle) had once stood. Construction began in 1846, and on 27 September 1863 the church was consecrated. The tower was finished in 1874. At that time, the Church of St. Nicholas became the tallest building in the world, which it remained until the completion of the cathedral of Rouen in 1876. Second only to the TV tower, the tower of the church is still the second tallest building in Hamburg. =World War II= The clearly visible tower of the Church of St. Nicholas served as a goal and orientation marker for pilots of the Allied Air Forces during the extensive air raids on Hamburg. On 28 July 1943, the church was heavily damaged by aerial bombs. The roof collapsed and the interior of the nave suffered heavy damage. The walls began to show cracks, yet neither they nor the tower collapsed. After the war, the basic structure of the Gothic church remained intact to a large extent and reconstruction was a realistic option. Nevertheless, it was decided to demolish the nave while leaving the tower untouched. As the vicinity of the church was no longer a residential area, a new Church of St. Nicholas was built in the district of Harvestehude. In 1951, the nave was finally demolished and the rubble was partially used for the reinforcement of the banks of the River Elbe. The loss of a valuable Gothic revival architectural monument was regretted by many, but after the war there were other priorities as far as reconstruction was concerned. Compared to the Church of Michael the Archangel, the Church of St. Nicholas was not regarded as one of Hamburg's most important landmarks. The tower and some remains of the wall have since been preserved as a memorial against war. For several decades they were not cared for, and, consequently, they gradually decayed. In 1987, the Rettet die Nikolaikirche e.V. (Rescue St. Nicholas's Church) foundation began to restore the existing fabric of the building and erected a so-called \\"place of encounters\\" (a room for events and exhibitions) in the crypt. The organization attempts to salvage pieces of rubble that were removed in 1951, such as pieces from the destroyed nave pulled from the River Elbe in November 2000. A reconstruction of the church, as done with the Church of Our Lady in Dresden, is not intended. However, a 51-bell carillon was installed in 1993 as a memorial. =Present day= The current condition of the Church of St. Nicholas is the result of the bombing of Hamburg in World War II, the removal of its ruinous walls and rubble in 1951 and restoration work to the tower in the 1990s and 2012. The ' foundation works to restore the tower further and improve its memorial role, supported by the city of Hamburg, the congregation of the Hauptkirche and various corporate sponsors and private contributors. The organization is charged with maintaining the building's existing structure, restoration, arranging events and displays in the church, and operating an information center housed in the church's crypt. Since 1 September 2005, an elevator has taken visitors to a platform inside the tower to history panels and a panoramic view over Hamburg and in particular the nearby Speicherstadt ( \\"city of warehouses\\").

SSSA publishes textbooks, professional guides, and special topics books.Books Certifications The SSSA certification programs are voluntary and offer similar benefits to the public as soil science licensing programs. The certification programs set standards for knowledge, skills, and conduct that define the professions of soil science (Certified Professional Soil Scientist - CPSS) and soil classification (Certified Professional Soil Classifier - CPSC). These certifications provide clients, employers, and government agencies with a tool to help them choose professionals with the necessary skills to meet their needs. Policy SSSA completed an assessment of the grand challenges facing the soil science discipline in 2011, identifying the most critical future research needs in soil science: climate change; food and energy security; waste treatment and water quality; and human and ecosystem health. More information on the grand challenges in soil science, including a list of short-, medium-, and long-term research goals, is available online. =Climate Change= * Major Initiatives The UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) declared 2015 as the International Year of Soils. In celebration of IYS, SSSA developed 12 monthly themes to help communicate the importance of soil. Each month features activities that help participants learn more about soils, and a monthly thematic video to explain the topic. Discover Soils SSSA's public website has a wealth of information about soils, their preservation and conservation. News topics include: Food & Health, Climate, Environment, Culture & Technology, and Soil Basics. The Soils in the City tab helps urban residents connect more with soils in their environment. ‚ÄúDig it! The Secrets of Soil‚Äù SSSA is the founding sponsor of this 4000-square foot exhibition revealing the complex world of soil and how this underfoot ecosystem supports nearly every form of life.

He was born in Amesbury, Massachusetts but arrived as a sailor in San Diego in 1820, from Plainfield, Connecticut. Captain Ames was baptized into the Catholic faith as Jesse Julian Ames, which allowed him to own property and other rights. He married Perfecta Espi√±osa in 1838 at Mission San Diego de Alcala. She was born 1821 in La Paz, Baja California, Mexico, the daughter of Pusamino Espi√±osa, an officer in the Spanish Army and commander at La Paz who went to San Diego in 1820. They had daughters, Matilda (\\"Mary\\") and Nievas, and sons Francisco (\\"Frank\\"), Samuel, Daniel, and Jos√©. In 1846, when the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War broke out, he was on an otter hunting expedition on the Baja California coast, with Philip Crosthwaite, John Post, John C. Stewart, and William Curley. Learning of the war at the Misi√≥n Nuestra Se√±ora del Sant√≠simo Rosario de Vi√±acado near El Rosario, Baja California, they all returned to San Diego and served in the Battle of San Pasqual. They reached the town late at night, and were wakened by a loud knock on the door early in the morning. It was Captain Gillespie, who said: \\"There can be no neutrals in this country; you must either enlist for three months (as the war will probably be over by that time), or be imprisoned on the Congress.\\" Ames volunteered in the war. Ames was President of the Board of Trustees for San Diego during 1853‚Äì1855, when the city had no Mayoral form of government. Captain Ames bought Rancho Ca√±ada de los Coches in 1859 from the Catholic Church, which served as a stop for the San Antonio‚ÄìSan Diego mail, nicknamed the \\"Jackass Mail\\". The ranch was located about 25 miles east of San Diego. Ames planted a double cactus hedge around the ranch house and raised sheep and cattle. Later, he built one of the first grist (flour) mills in the county and built a dam to supply his ranch with reliable water. Ames also made the best soap south of Los Angeles, opened a blacksmith shop, and made lime for whitewash. At his ranch, Ames would throw lavish fiestas that drew guests as far away as Santa Barbara and Los Angeles. Ames adobe home was destroyed in the 1880s by vandals who thought valuables were hidden in it. The ruins were removed around 1925. Ames died in 1866 while getting his wagon out of the mud. He is buried in the Calvary Cemetery, now Calvary Memorial Pioneer Park in Mission Hills. His wife Perfecta died 1890 and also is buried there.

The High Street in Oxford, England, runs between Carfax, generally recognised as the centre of the city, and Magdalen Bridge to the east. Overview The street has been described by Nikolaus Pevsner as \\"one of the world's great streets\\". It forms a gentle curve and is the subject of many prints, paintings, photographs, etc. The looking west towards Carfax with University College on the left and The Queen's College on the right is an especially popular view. There are many historical buildings on the street, including the University of Oxford buildings and colleges.Stephanie Jenkins, History of the High. Locally the street is often known as \\"The High\\". Major buildings To the north are (west to east): Lincoln College (main entrance on Turl Street, including All Saints Church, now Lincoln College's library.), Brasenose College (main entrance in Radcliffe Square), St Mary's (the University Church), All Souls College, The Queen's College, St Edmund Hall (main entrance in Queen's Lane) and Magdalen College (including Magdalen Tower). To the south are (west to east): Oriel College, University College (including the Boyle-Hooke plaque outside the Shelley Memorial), the Examination Schools, the Ruskin School of Drawing and Fine Art, the Eastgate Hotel (at the original entrance to the city) and the Botanic Garden. Commerce Queen's Lane Coffee House (at the junction with Queen's Lane) was established in 1654 and was probably Oxford's first coffee house. This title is however disputed with 'The Grand Cafe' Coffee House, which claims that it was established in 1650 and stands opposite Queen's Lane coffee house. Despite an influx of chain stores in nearby Cornmarket Street, the High is home to a number of specialist independent retailers. These include Shepherd & Woodward (University outfitters), Payne & Son (goldsmiths), Sanders of Oxford (print sellers) and Waterfield's Books. To the north at the eastern end between Cornmarket and the Turl is the historic traditional Covered Market, established in 1774. William Henry Butler, later Mayor of Oxford, was a wine merchant with premises in the High Street during the early 19th century.William Henry Butler: Mayor of Oxford, January‚ÄìOctober 1836, Mayors of Oxford. Edward Bracher, a pioneering Victorian photographer, had a shop at 26 High Street. Henry Taunt, another photographer, joined him as a member of staff in 1856. Taunt later returned to 41 High Street after the lease for his own shop premises in Broad Street expired in 1894. 83 High Street bears a blue plaque (10 October 2001) commemorating Sarah Cooper (1848‚Äì1932) marmalade maker, wife of Frank Cooper whose shop at 83‚Äì84 High Street was the origin of the Frank Cooper jam business (a brand now owned by Premier Foods). The company made \\"Oxford Marmalade\\" famous. In June 1879, George Claridge Druce (also a noted botanist and later mayor of the city) moved to Oxford and set up a chemist's shop, Druce & Co., at 118 High Street. This continued until his death 1932. The Old Bank Hotel was the first new hotel for 135 years in the centre of Oxford. Quod Brasserie is also part of the hotel, located between the junctions with Oriel Street and Logic Lane.

The Guild of Thieves is an interactive fiction game by Magnetic Scrolls first published by Rainbird in 1987. The game takes place in Kerovnia like the previous game The Pawn. Start of the right  Gameplay  The player's character is \\"an aspiring member of the infamous Guild of Thieves\\" and is to steal all the valuables that can be found in and around an island castle. The game features \\"extremely atmospheric\\" Alt URL descriptions and 30 artistic renditions of key locations. Included in the game package are a faux newsletter of the Guild of Thieves titled What Burglar providing instructions and hints for the game, a Bank of Kerovnia Trading Account Card, a guild contract detailing the arrangement between the player's character and the Guild of Thieves and small dice. Reception The game was voted Best Adventure Game Of The Year at the Golden Joystick Awards. Dragon complimented the game, calling it an \\"exciting sequel\\" to The Pawn, citing its \\"witty dialogue, outstanding graphics, wry humor, and challenging puzzles\\". Computer Gaming World in 1988 approved of the game's sophisticated parser, British humor, and high-quality graphics. It concluded, \\"the game must be highly recommended and it is tough ... it compares well with the best of Infocom\\". The magazine's Charles Ardai in 1992 called its puzzles \\"pretty good, requiring a certain amount of ingenuity ... None are particularly memorable, though. The game is good, but lacks the sparks of innovation that would elevate it above the level of dozens of similar games\\". Antic stated \\"The outstanding graphics of The Pawn are matched by those in Guild of Thieves. High-resolution pictures transport you into a medieval world of thieves, castles and treasure. The only complaint I have about the Atari XE/XL version is that most of the detailed graphics had only shades of one or two colors.\\" Legacy The game was re-released in 1992 as part of the Magnetic Scrolls Collection. The new version had an updated UI and came with an art poster depicting the island. In June 2017 Magnetic Scrolls successfully recovered the source code of The Guild of Thieves (and other games) to remaster and re-release them.Dev rescues '80s text adventure source code by baking tapes in an oven on Gamasutra.com by Alex Wawro (June 28, 2017)Magnetic Scrolls Original Games Source Code Recovered! on strandgames.com (June 19, 2017) In December 2017 the remastered and enhanced edition of the game was published.

It also produces speakers, headphones, power strips, mobile accessories and audio devices for automobiles. The company was founded by an audiophile and engineer, Noel Lee, in 1979 by experimenting with different ways to build audio cables. It grew by doing demonstrations to convince the industry that audio cables made a difference in audio quality and by establishing relationships with retailers that were attracted to the cable's profit margins. Over the years it created new divisions like Monster Music, Monster Game, Monster Mobile, Monster Photo and Monster Power. In the 2000s, Monster had legal trademark disputes regarding other companies or products that have \\"Monster\\" in their name, such as Monster.com and the film Monsters, Inc. Monster said it needed to defend its premium brand, while critics said it was pursuing litigation against companies that did not have confusingly similar products. It began manufacturing headphones in a partnership with Dr. Dre in 2008, which ended in 2012, and it created other celebrity branded or Monster-branded headphone products. Tests done by audiophile publications, news reporters and academics reached conflicting conclusions on whether more expensive audio or video cables like those from Monster make a difference in audio or video quality when compared to generic cables. Instead of advertising, Monster offers incentives to retailers and their salespeople to sell the cables. Retailers bundle high profit-margin cables with larger purchases that have smaller margins in order to improve profitability. History =Origins= Monster was founded in 1979 by Noel Lee as Monster Cable Products. Lee, an audiophile and engineer, was experimenting with different copper qualities, wire constructs and winding methods of audio cables in his family's garage and comparing them while listening to Tchaikovsky's 1812 Overture. He became convinced that audio cables could be engineered to improve audio quality by conducting electricity more efficiently. Using a borrowed portion of somebody's booth at the 1978 Consumer Electronics Show, he did demonstrations of his cables in comparison to standard wires. After a positive reception at CES, he quit his job at Lawrence Berkeley Lab and started Monster Cable Products with $250,000 in bank financing. Monster's first cables were manufactured by Lee by hand and sold door-to-door. Initial sales were slow, because at the time electronics retailers provided low-cost lamp cords to consumers for free or at low prices and audiophiles didn't believe audio cables made a difference in the sound. Monster is credited with creating the market for high-end audio cables in the 1980s through Lee's \\"marketing prowess\\". He did demonstrations comparing the audio of standard cables to Monster cables for retailers and trained their salespeople to do the same for customers. =Diversification= In 1980, Monster Cable Products moved out of Lee's garage and into a San Francisco facility. It also introduced its second audio cable, Interlink. The company grew through word-of-mouth and an increasing number of retailers that carried Monster products. It attempted to enter the market for audio devices for automotive briefly, but withdrew to focus on home entertainment. Its first product intended for the mass-market was introduced in 1987. Monster re-entered the auto audio market in the early 1990s with a new line of speaker cables and its first speaker product, the Persona One. Its high-end M-series product line was introduced in 1992. It also expanded internationally, especially in Asia. Monster had a Taiwanese distributor file its trademark in the region, which led to the distributor continuing to sell products under the Monster brand after their agreement with Monster was terminated. This led to a lengthy legal battle and eventually a settlement. Monster acquired the Entec in-car audio brand in 1998. Monster's program for retailers was formalized in 1993 as the M4 Dealer Success Program. The \\"M4\\" stands for four \\"M\\"s: Mix (product mix), Merchandising (displays), Monsterization (training) and Management commitment. In the 1990s, the business grew from $20 million in annual revenues to $100 million. By 1998, Monster was producing 1,000 different products out of a distribution and manufacturing center in Brisbane, California, that was established that year. It had created a record label company, Monster Music, in 1989, which was followed by Monster Power for power products such as power cords and surge protectors, in 1998, Monster Game for video game accessories in 2000 and the Monster Mobile division, which markets cell phone and digital camera accessories, in 2001. A Monster Photo product line was created in 2003 that includes power cells, cables and bags for digital cameras, followed by Monster Signature Series Power. In 2004, it created a spin-off called M-Design, run by Lee's son, which sells furniture with electronics built in. =Recent history= In September 2004, Monster paid $6 million in an agreement with the San Francisco 49ers and the city of San Francisco to rename the football team's home stadium from Candlestick Park to Monster Park for four years. $3 million of it was given to the football team and the other $3 million to the San Francisco Recreation and Parks Department. Critics of local politician Matt Gonzales said it was inappropriate for the city to sell the name of a public facility to a corporation, and a ballot was passed ensuring that the name of the park reverted to Candlestick Park in 2008. Monster's first wireless products, a receiver and transmitter for connecting televisions and devices, were introduced in 2008. In 2012, the company changed its name from \\"Monster Cable Products\\" to \\"Monster Inc.\\". Following the collapse of the Beats deal with Apple, Monster has sought a new sales strategy, forgoing traditional retail chains in favor of experiential sales at non-traditional spaces. Company founder Lee said [We're looking at] ‚Äúalternative venues ‚Äì like Barclays‚Äô Center, stadiums where players can wear the headphone when they go in, and talk about how great the headphones sound. [We can] bring great- sounding music to a sports venue. We‚Äôre looking at cruise ships, stadiums, EDM concerts.\\" Trademark disputes As of 2004, Monster owned about 300 trademarks, 70 of which are related to the word \\"Monster\\". By 2009, the company had made 190 filings with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. Most filings were to delay potentially infringing trademark applications so Monster could study them. Some were formal oppositions and about 30 resulted in lawsuits. Most lawsuits were settled with non-disclosed terms. Critics and defendants say that Monster is too aggressive in pursuing trademark protections against companies that do not have confusingly similar products and that it is trying to own a common word, not protect a brand. Monster representatives say they are doing what most \\"premium\\" brands do to protect their marks and that their products include things like clothes, mints and music. In the 2000s, Monster had legal disputes over its trademarks with the Discovery Channel for its show Monster Garage. Monster also had trademark disputes with Bally Gaming International over its slot machines, Monster Slots, with Hansen Beverage Co. for its Monster Energy drink, and the Chicago Bears, who use the nickname \\"Monsters of the Midway\\". Other trademark disputes include a 2001 lawsuit against The Walt Disney Company for products related to the film Monsters, Inc., and a claim against an online used clothing retailer, MonsterVintage LLC. In 2004, Monster filed a complaint about the trademark application from Snow Monsters, a video website with skiing content for kids. The Snow Monsters owner initiated a lawsuit against Monster pre-emptively. It has also had a trademark dispute with the job site, Monster.com. In 2006 Monster brought a suit against Monster Mini Golf, a company selling franchise Mini Golf locations throughout the US. After an unsuccessful legal mediation, Monster Mini Golf launched a grassroots campaign against Monster Cable on the Internet. As a result, Monster received more than 200 complaints from the public. Monster Cable dropped the lawsuit and agreed to pay up to $200,000 of Monster Mini Golf's legal fees. In 2009 Monster Cable CEO Noel Lee said on Fox Business that the company has had to balance their trademark protection efforts with the public's point-of-view. Headphones 100px Monster established a partnership with rap mogul Dr. Dre and Interscope Records in 2007 to design and manufacture the Beats Electronics line of headphones called \\"Beats by Dr. Dre\\". This led to a trend among headphone manufacturers to create celebrity-endorsed products. Monster created similar partnerships with Lady Gaga for the Heartbeats brand of headphones in 2009, P. Diddy's Diddybeats in May 2010 and LeBron James later that year. In 2010, Monster began developing a series of products for the Chinese market that were co- branded with basketball player Yao Ming. According to analyst firm NPD Group, the Beats brand that Monster distributed exclusively grew to own 53 percent of a $1 billion headphones market. A 51 percent interest in Beats was sold to HTC in August 2011. At the end of the five-year agreement between Monster and Dr. Dre in 2012, Dre decided not to renew. According to Bloomberg, both parties said the separation was \\"amicable\\" but they had disagreements on who deserves credit and the share of revenues. The partnership was responsible for a substantial portion of Monster's revenues. After the split, Monster created its own headphones product line and other celebrity-branded headphones with music groups Earth, Wind & Fire and Miles Davis. Gambling In October 2017, plans by Lee and Monster to enter the online gambling space were revealed in an exclusive story by Digital Trends. Citing a new sales strategy for alternative retail venues such as concert stadiums and sports arenas, Lee said a casino would generate revenue while allowing the company a place to sell its electronics. The casino deal connects Monster to the Iowa Tribe of Oklahoma and was signed June 20, 2017, bringing controversial figure Fred Kahlilian to the company as the new COO. The gambling site PokerTribe.com will launch on or before December 15, 2017, Khalilian said. Products Monster manufactures 6,000 different products, including headphones, speakers, surge protectors, televisions, and accessories for cars and mobile devices. The company is best known for its speaker cable. It created the market for high- end audio cables in the 1980s. According to a reporter from SoundStage Network, it \\"has retained a huge lead\\" for high-end audio cables ever since. Monster also makes cables for TVs, DVD players, computers, printers, gaming consoles, and cameras, and for audio equipment in cars. As high-definition televisions grew in popularity, the company expanded into HDMI and high-def cables, including a lower-cost HDMI Basic and HDMI cables with five different speed ratings. It also produces cables intended for specific gaming consoles and Apple products. Monster began manufacturing and marketing USB and ethernet cables as well as power strips and power management products in 2009. It's been producing its own line of headphones since 2012 and also manufactures celebrity-branded headphones. Monster sells speakers under the Clarity and Katana brands and mobile accessories like an iPod dock and a line-up of Tron- branded products. In the 2000s, it entered into markets for \\"lifestyle products\\" like amplifiers, speakers and furniture with electronics built-in, as well as wireless products. Pricing and performance questions right Tests by Stereo Review Magazine in 1983 concluded that Monster cables did not make a difference in the sound and were \\"indistinguishable\\" from 16-gauge lamp cord. Whether someone claims they can hear the difference varies from person to person. Many reporters and audiophiles have done double-blind a/b listening tests and are unable to hear the difference. According to PC Magazine, Monster is \\"often accused of selling over-priced cables that you can buy elsewhere for a fraction of the price\\". Wired magazine said \\"with Monster, you pay a staggering premium for durability and good looks\\". Many reviewers stress that Monster HDMI cables are not needed for lower-resolution televisions or over short distances and that the difference in audio quality is not substantial enough. Relationship with retailers Monster Cable and similar \\"boutique\\" cables are a substantial source of revenue for retailers of electronics, such as DVD players and TVs. While the profit margins of DVD players and TVs may be low, the profit margins of Monster Cables and similar products provide supplemental revenue for these retailers. Employees of such retailers are trained to market and bundle Monster Cable and similar products in order to increase profitability. According to The New York Times, profit margins for retailers can be 40 percent or more and The Consumerist reported that one retailer was selling some cables at an 80 percent markup. This has led to criticisms that sales staff are motivated to sell high-end cable products to customers that don't need them and to be aggressive in order to obtain incentives. Monster has responded by saying that markups are determined by the retailer and are usually less than those found on clothing, jewelry and furniture. As of 1998, Monster spent $13 million a year in training and incentive programs for salespeople. The sales staff are provided data on their performance in selling the cables and top-performers are sent on all-expenses- paid vacations. Monster also hosts its Retailer Awards at CES each year, which the Las Vegas Sun called, \\"one of the biggest events on the CES party circuit\\".

The neo-Gothic church is the largest, though not the tallest church in Austria.Universum zu Linz09 from 7 April 2009 History Construction plans were started in 1855 by Bishop Franz-Josef Rudigier. The first stone was laid on 1 May 1862‚Äîan event solemnised by the performance of Anton Bruckner's Festive Cantata Preiset den Herrn. In 1924 Bishop Johannes Maria Gf√∂llner consecrated the finished building as the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception. The plans, drawn by the master builder of the Archdiocese of Cologne, Vincenz Statz, were made in the French high Gothic style. With 20,000 seats, the cathedral is the largest (130 meters long, and the ground 5,170 square meters), but not the highest, church in Austria. The originally-planned, higher spire was not approved, because in Austria-Hungary at the time, no building was allowed to be taller than the South Tower of the St. Stephen's Cathedral in Vienna. At 135 m, the New Cathedral is two meters shorter than the Viennese cathedral. Particularly noteworthy are the cathedral's stained-glass windows. The most famous is the Linz Window, which depicts the history of Linz. The windows also contain portraits of the various sponsors of the church's construction. During the Second World War some windows, particularly in the southern part of the cathedral, were damaged. Instead of restoring the original windows, they have been replaced with windows displaying modern art. Also noteworthy is the nativity scene in the church burial vault, with its figures made by S. Osterrieder, and the display of the regalia of Bishop Rudigier.  Politics  Commemorative cut with plaquet In October 2006 the Catholic Church added a plaquet to the commemorative wood cut for Engelbert Dollfu√ü at the New Cathedral, which caused excitement in the √ñVP. In the plaque the church, by resolution of the Austrian Conference of Catholic Bishops, distances itself from the original cut and proclaims the future abstention from party politics. Dollfu√ü as acting Chancellor of Austria in 1933 eliminated the parliament over formal irregularities. This caused the Austrian Civil War and led to a dictatorship.Ober√∂sterreichische Nachrichten (O√ñN) of 2006-11-09 Retrieved on 2009-08-07Daily paper \\"Heute\\" of 2008-11-11  Gallery  File:Linz Dom Fenster 09 img01.jpg File:Linzer Dom - Fenster - Immaculata.jpg File:Linz Dom Fenster 09 img02.jpg File:Linzer Dom - Fenster - Barbara.jpg File:Linz Dom Fenster 09 img03.jpg File:Linz Dom Fenster 09 img04.jpg References *The information in this article is based on that in its German equivalent.

It operates 105 elementary schools, 16 secondary schools, and other facilities, serving more than 64,000 students in the Region of Waterloo. It has approximately 6,800 staff and a budget of $675 million. It is the largest public sector employer in the Region and the second largest employer overall. In early 2018, the director of education is John Bryant. The board serves Waterloo Region, which consists of the cities of Kitchener, Cambridge, and Waterloo, and the townships of Wellesley, Woolwich, Wilmot, and North Dumfries. Within the townships, WRDSB operates schools in the communities of Ayr, Baden, Breslau, Conestogo, Elmira, Floradale, Linwood, New Dundee, New Hamburg, St. Jacobs, and Wellesley. Trustees are elected every four years by the public school ratepayers in their area. Four trustees are elected in Kitchener, three trustees are elected in each of Waterloo/Wilmot and Cambridge/North Dumfries and one trustee represents Elmira/Woolwich. Although trustees are elected in specific areas, once they are elected they must represent the entire region. Annually, two students are elected by their peers to represent the student voice on the school board. They have a voice at the table but no binding vote. Every year in December, the trustees elect a Chair and Vice Chair for the coming year. Board policy dictates that no one may serve in either role for more than two consecutive years. In 2016, the trustees published a new Strategic Plan consisting of three priorities to provide \\"first class public education to Waterloo Region\\". In January 2018, the Board announced that it was considering the building of up to 12 new schools and the expansion of 11 existing facilities over the subsequent years, due to an increasing population. An additional 7,100 new students were expected by 2027. At the same time, the Board was considering a study of the feasibility and benefits that might be provided by year-round schooling, but did not agree to proceed with a pilot programme. The Waterloo Catholic District School Board operates the Catholic schools which educate approximately one of every three students in the Region. Safe and secure schools policy The School Board was criticized for its role in maintaining a confidential file on Ronald Wayne Archer (Ron Archer), a teacher convicted in 2000 of four charges of sexual assault of his student. The file documented allegations that Archer sexually assaulted children beginning in the 1970s. In 2006, the Ontario College of Teachers revoked Archer's certificates of qualification and registration. Members of the public believed that had the file been disclosed, subsequent abuse would have been prevented. In 2001, the Board created new policies to prevent abuse in future. A Safe and Secure Schools policy was developed including a Code of Conduct that outlines expected behaviour standards of all members of the school community: students, parents, guardians, volunteers, staff and visitors. In 2017 It's OK to be white posters were taped to the doors of two collegiate institutes. A spokesman for the school board said \\"Our schools are safe spaces.

It was presented by Alexander III as an Easter gift to his wife, the Tsarina Maria Feodorovna. It is currently held in the Kremlin Armoury Museum in Moscow.  Design  Carved from a solid piece of heliotrope jasper, also known as bloodstone, the Memory of Azov Egg is decorated in the Louis XV style with a superimposed gold pattern of Rococo scrolls with brilliant diamonds and chased gold flowers. The broad flute gold bezel is set with a drop ruby and two diamonds that complete the clasp. The egg's interior is lined with green velvet.  Surprise  The surprise contained within is a miniature replica of the Imperial Russian Navy cruiser Pamiat Azova (Memory of Azov), executed in red and yellow gold and platinum with small diamonds for windows, set on a piece of aquamarine representing the water. The name \\"Azov\\" appears on the ship's stern. The plate has a golden frame with a loop enabling the model to be removed from the egg.  History  The egg commemorates the voyage made by Tsarevitch Nicholas and Grand Duke George of Russia aboard the Pamiat Azova to the Far East in 1890. The trip was made after a suggestion by their parents to broaden the outlook of the future Tsar and his brother. At the time, Grand Duke George was suffering from tuberculosis, and the voyage only exacerbated it. Tsarevitch Nicholas was also the victim of an attempted assassination (\\"≈åtsu incident\\") whilst in Japan and sustained a serious head wound.

Built by order of Pope Leo X, it has been a Protestant cathedral since the Reformation and its congregation forms part of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Northern Germany.  History  It is believed that the church is near the original Hammaburg area and that previous cathedral existed on the site. St. Peter's was probably built at the start of the 1189; it was first documented in 1195 as a market cathedral or ecclesia forensis. In about 1310, the cathedral was rebuilt in a Gothic style and was completed in approximately 1418. The bronze lion-head door handles, the oldest work of art of Hamburg, date from the foundation of the tower in 1342. A second tower, built in 1516, towered above even the Hamburg Cathedral. Decay caused it to be torn down between 1804 and 1807, after it had been used by Napoleonic soldiers as a horse stable. The building fell victim to the great fire that swept Hamburg in May 1842. Most works of art, such as the lion-head door handles, were saved. The St. Peter's portal gateway was heavily damaged in the fire but was saved and ended up being built into the Museum f√ºr Hamburgische Geschichte (established in 1922 and called Hamburg Museum since 2005), and the doorway itself was restored again in 1995. Only seven years after the great fire, the Gothic church was rebuilt by architects Alexis de Chateauneuf and Hermann Felsenfest in its previous location. In 1878, the 132 meter high cathedral tower‚Äîits copper spire designed by Johann Maack‚Äîwas finished. In the first half of the 20th century, the parish lost many members, as residential neighborhoods were torn down to develop banks and department stores in the city center. The church got through the Second World War relatively intact. In 1962, as a nearby community center was being built, the foundations of a medieval tower, the Bischofsturm (\\"Bishop's Tower\\") were discovered. In 1979, nuclear power protesters, including the late pastor Christoph Stoermer, occupied the cathedral. From 2005 to 2007, the west and south facades of the church were hung with giant posters advertising the H&M; chain of clothing stores, thus providing funding for maintenance of the cathedral. St. Petri Cathedral in Hamburg  Art  Door handles with lion headsThe best known artworks in St Peter's are the lion-head door handles, located in the left wing of the west portal. However, the cathedral contains many additional works of art. In the north portion of the cathedral, a Gothic mural from approximately 1460 shows the first bishop Ansgar of Bremen, with the words \\"Apostle of the North\\". A column in the choir area contains a statue by Bernt Notke, from around 1480‚Äì1483, showing Archbishop Ansgar and the Hamburg Marienkirche, which he founded. From the 17th century, there are two oil paintings by Gottfried Libalt: Jacob's Dream and Christ's Birth. They were damaged by an acid attack in 1977, but were restored in October, 2001, and returned to the cathedral. The painting Christmas 1813 in St. Peter's is on a column in the south part of the cathedral. It shows the Hamburg citizens who, when they did not provide food to Napoleon's occupying troops, were locked in the church by the soldiers. In the front of the cathedral are neo-Gothic representations of the evangelists. A modern bronze sculpture by Fritz Fleer shows Dietrich Bonhoeffer dressed as a convict with his hands bound.

The first remains were found in 1997, in the Late Cretaceous strata of the Ulansuhai Formation located at Alshanzuo Banner, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, Northern China. Discovery and naming Block containing eight specimens The first fossil remains of Sinornithomimus were uncovered by Dong Zhiming in the Ulansuhai Formation as part of the Mongol Highland International Dinosaur Project in 1997. They contained at least fourteen skeletons found in close association, nine of which are nearly complete and relatively uncrushed. The find consisted of three sub-adult to adult specimens and eleven juveniles. The unweathered state of the bones, preserved in siltstone interspersed with layers of clay and the absence of evidence for post-mortem movement, argue for a catastrophic event that killed all the individuals present in the find simultaneously and instantaneously.Kobayashi, Y., L√º, J.‚àíC., Azuma, Y., Dong, Z.‚àíM., and Barsbold, R. (2001) Bonebed of a new gastrolith‚àíbearing ornithomimid dinosaur from the Upper Cretaceous Ulansuhai Formation of Nei Mongol Autonomous Region, China. Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology 21 (Supplement to 3): 68‚Äì69. The type species Sinornithomimus dongi was named and described by Yoshitsugu Kobayashi and L√º Junchang in 2003. The generic name means ‚ÄúChinese bird mimic‚Äù while the specific descriptor honours Dong as the discoverer of the fossils. The holotype, IVPP-V11797-10, is one of the subadult skeletons. The other skeletons have been assigned as paratypes. A second expedition in 2001 at the same site led to the discovery of another fossilized herd of thirteen juveniles and subadults of Sinornithomimus. Their positioning suggest that they died together and over a short interval, likely after having become mired in the mud of a drying waterhole. The second discovery also largely consisted of nearly intact exemplars making Sinornithomimus the most completely known ornithomimid.Young Dinosaurs Roamed Together, Died Together Newswise, Retrieved on March 18, 2009. Description Life restoration Sinornithomimus was a small ornithomimid measuring in length and weighing about with a relatively short neck and head for a member of that group. Genus List for Holtz 2012 Weight Information Autapomorphies (unique derived traits) included the possession of a quadrate with a depression having within a smaller opening which is divided by a vertical sheet of bone; and a depression on the lateral side of the posterior process of the parietal bone. Classification Skull of adult specimen IVPP‚àíV11797‚àí10 Skull of juvenile specimen IVPP‚àíV11797‚àí11 Sinornithomimus was by the describers assigned to the Ornithomimidae. It was a basal ornithomimid that was considered by its describers a more derived form than Archaeornithomimus, though more recent analyses reverse the situation. The structure of the hand is similar to that of Archaeornithomimus representing thus an intermediate between the \\"primitive\\" condition of the ornithomimosaur Harpymimus and the one of the more derived ornithomimids. Sinornithomimus renders some synapomorphies of ornithomimids plesiomorphic, while also differentiating Asian ornithomimid rhamphothecae from North American ones, based on maxillary vascular foramina found in the latter. The following cladogram follows that of Xu and colleagues in 2011: Paleobiology Diagram of the Suhongtu site, which has yielded numerous specimens at different stages The herbivory of this genus is supported by the rare presence of gastroliths, as such stones were found forming conspicuous masses in the stomach areas of the fossil skeletons.Kobayashi, Y., L√º, J.‚àíC., Dong, Z.‚àíM., Barsbold, R., Azuma, Y., and Tomida, Y. (1999) Herbivorous diet in an ornithomimid dinosaur. Nature 402: 480‚Äì481. This species was gregarious, which is corroborated by the arrangement of the fossil remains in a small bonebed with the juvenile individuals being approximately of the same age. This is furthermore supported by the increase of running ability as the animal progressed in its ontogeny, thus shown in the more cursorial proportions of the adults which possess relatively longer lower legs. It was assumed by the describers that adults protected themselves and their juveniles from predators by forming familial groups; in 2008 however a study concluded that the all juvenile herds suggest that immature individuals were left to fend for themselves in juvenile groups while adults preoccupied themselves with nesting or brooding.

The church was built as a palatine church in the Ottonian era. The present building is a late Romanesque church with a late gothic quire. St. Reinold's was built from 1250 to 1270, and is located in the centre of the city, directly at the crossing of the Hellweg (a historic trade route) and the historic road from Cologne to Bremen. St. Reinoldi's congregation is a member of the Evangelical Church of Westphalia, an umbrella comprising Lutheran, Reformed and united Protestant congregations. Efforts to complete the tower of St. Reinold's were renewed in 1443. After its completion in 1454, it was tall and was referred to as the \\"Miracle of Westphalia\\". The polygonal spire was renovated the first time in 1519. On 24 June 1520, the copper roofing was completed, and on 27 July the spire was added. The apex of the church was now about seven metres higher. In 1562 the pastors and congregations of Dortmund confirmed their adoption of Lutheranism in St. Reinold's Church. In 1661, the tower collapsed after being damaged during an earthquake. The foundation for the new tower was laid 1662, and the building was completed 1701, with a baroque ornament on the top. The church was heavily damaged in World War II. Since the reconstruction the tower now bears a hood with baroque features similar to the original one, but increased in height (together with the tower as a whole) to correspond with the increased height of the surrounding modern buildings in the city centre. These features supply a visual and harmonious connection between the original style of the church and its appearance after reconstruction. The tower of St. Reinold's Church (today's height: ) can be visited, up to the first platform by the bell tower. On the inside there is a large set of bells, made by the \\"Bochumer Verein\\" foundry (total weight: 20 t), built in 1954 with altogether 6 steel bells.

Description A significant part of Dandeli's population consists of economic migrants from all over India, especially the north/south Indian states like Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Gujarat, Andhra, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and many districts of the Karnataka state. The official and predominant language of communication is Kannada. =Old Dandeli= As per the 1930 year, the population of Dandeli was only 515 and predominantly worked in the forestry department and government saw mill. Most residents belonged to the Konkanis, Devali, Marathas, Kuruba, Lambani, African, and Muslim communities. The settlement was located on the bank of the Kali river and developed into an industrial town with the establishment of a number of companies, including The Indian Plywood Manufacturing Company, Lalbhai Ferro-manganese Factory, West Coast Paper Mill, Indian Saw Mill, and a number of small industries around the Dandeli and Karnataka Power Corporation which were engaged in the construction of several power-generating dams at different places along the Kali river. The place was later called Old-Dandeli. There was no school in the small town until in 1936, when Shivaji Narvekar, Pundalik Pai, Sadanand Gopal Nadkarni, Balappa Chavan and Bapshet together contributed to build a one-room school in a hut on the nearby hill where now the government Urdu school is situated. Ramachandra Ganapat Nayak migrated from Sanikatta near Gokarn to run the school. The school started with merely 18 students, three of whom were older than their teacher, R.G. Nayak. In 1939 the school was recognised by the British government. = Name = A local legend states that the city is named after Dandelappa, a local deity, a servant of the Mirashi landlords, who lost his life because of his loyalty. An alternative legend states that a king named Dandakanayaka passed through the forests and named them after himself, and the city is believed to stand on the place where Dandakaranya stood when he named the area.The word \\"Aranya\\" in Kannada language means \\"forest\\". = Geography and Climate = Dandeli is located at 15.247719N, 74.629678W.google mapsFalling Rain Genomics, Inc ‚Äì Dandeli It has an average elevation of and has received heavy rainfall during August to November (see chart below). Because of good forest cover and moderate elevation, the location has a tropical highland climate, averaging about in summer and in winter. = Wildlife sanctuary = A deer spotted in the wildlife sanctuary Dandeli is a natural habitat for wildlife, including tigers, leopards, black panthers, elephants, gaur, deer, antelopes, and bears. It is the second largest wildlife sanctuary in Karnataka and was designated as a tiger reserve in 2007. The jungle is also home to several varieties of reptiles and almost 300 varieties of birds. The rapid expansion of industry has raised fears of ecological damage to the area, and local volunteer groups have formed to address the issue.  Demographics  As of the 2001 India census, Dandeli had a population of 53,287. Males constitute 51% of the population and females 49%. Dandeli has an average literacy rate of 74%, higher than the national average of 65%: male literacy is 81% and female literacy is 68%. In Dandeli, 11% of the population is under six years of age. Kannada is the widely spoken language in the region. Dandeli's population was higher in the past, but lack of employment has forced people to migrate elsewhere. Jobs pay poorly, and traditional businesses have been disappearing for lack of customers. The West Coast Paper Mills is one of the largest employers in the town and the primary landowner; the mill has its own quarters, shopping complex, theatre, restaurant, playground, and a clubhouse for the employees. The company was promoted by Shree Digvijay Cement Company Limited, Sikka, Gujarat State in 1955.

Publication history Killowat first appeared in Team Titans #1 and was created by Dan Jurgens. Fictional character biography Killowat's story began 10 years in the future; or, rather, the false future where Lord Chaos reigned and a force known as the Team Titans struggled to overthrow his tyranny. Lord Chaos sought to destroy the rebels known as the Team Titans. Charlie Watkins was an ambitious young man that yearned to join Lord Chaos' Force Elite. Believing Chaos a god, Charlie could think of no greater honor. He was accepted and after much training, he attained the rank of corporal. As he served the Force Elite, he became increasingly aware of Lord Chaos' true nature. Now disgusted at the master he served, he approached the Team Titans and offered to become a double agent. On a routine mission, things went awry. Charlie was exposed as a spy, and he fell into one of the energy converters. Instead of killing him, it transformed him into a being of electricity. He could now alter his body from normal human, Charlie Watkins, to an electrical avenger, Killowat. During that same mission, Team Titan Silver Shield died in battle. Now exposed as a traitor to Lord Chaos, Killowat offered to become a member of the Team Titans (in Silver Shield's honor) and was accepted. Shortly thereafter, the Team Titans leader gave the team a mission: travel 10 years into the past to stop Chaos from ever being born. To accomplish this, the Teamers were assigned to kill Donna Troy before she would give birth to the child who would become Lord Chaos. The team successfully traveled to the past and came into conflict with the New Titans. Donna gave birth to her son before the team could intervene. However, the Titans and the Team Titans were able to stop Chaos and spare Donna's life at the same time. After this, Killowat along with his colleagues found themselves stranded in the past, unable to return to their future. They bonded with the current Titans via a trip to Hollywood and a possible cartoon deal.\\"Teen Titans Sell Out\\" One-Shot (November 1992) Later, with nowhere else to go, they resided at Donna Troy's New Jersey farmhouse. The Teamers tried to find a place in this new world. At one time, the Teamers searched for their counterparts in this timeline. Killowat found the counterparts to the aunt and uncle that raised him ‚Äì but discovered they were African-American; it seemed unlikely he existed in this timeline at all. Charlie had an especially hard time adjusting to his new life. Complicating matters, he was very much in love with Mirage, who had no romantic feelings for him. Shortly after this, the Team Titans' lives were disrupted by the time crisis known as Zero Hour. It was then revealed that the Team Titans leader in the future was the villainous Monarch - who created a false future world so he could train metahumans (The Team Titans) to act as sleeper agent assassins. He knew of the impending time crisis, and wanted a super-powered army at his command. The time-villain Extant commanded all the Team Titans to attack the heroes who were trying to unravel this time crisis. His plan was thwarted; the heroes contained the Team Titans. Time continued to collapse, erasing the false timelines that had emerged. As a result, all the Team Titans were erased from existence. Strangely enough, three people remained unscathed from Monarch's false timeline: Tara Markov (Terra II), Miriam Delgado (Mirage) and Deathwing (who was believed to be a future Dick Grayson). The Time Trapper revealed that Mirage, Deathwing and Terra were from this timeline, not an alternate timeline, as they had thought. All three had been implanted with false memories by the Time Trapper and turned into \\"sleeper agents\\" who would fight the villainous Monarch in the coming Zero Hour event. The rest of the Team Titans, including Killowat, ceased to exist altogether. It is unknown whether some version of Killowat has or will exist in this timeline. Other versions =Elseworlds= * In an Elseworlds story, Killowat is the heroic protector of a refugee camp full of aliens.Team Titans Annual #2 (1994) In other media =Television= * Killowat appears in the Teen Titans episode \\"Calling All Titans\\". He fought off Control Freak and his TV minions, but was ambushed by Puppet King. He was then captured and flash-frozen. Apparently, he nullified the powers of Control Freak's remote and images. He also has the power to absorb electricity which was used in \\"Titans Together\\" against Overload. This left nothing but Overload's circuit board. =Miscellaneous= * Killowat also appeared in Teen Titans Go! #48, but through the episode his name was spelled Kilowatt. In this issue, Killowat's origin is revealed. He came from an alternate universe where he was part of the Team Titans. However, one day, he found himself in grave danger. Just as his opponent was going to finish him off, he called for help and from a different universe, Raven heard him. She pulled him into her universe and Killowat became a part of that team of titans. Raven then thought she found a way to bring Killowat back to his universe, but she sent him to another universe. There, he was ambushed by the Teen Tyrants and taken to their base. However, Raven, realizing her mistake, took the Teen Titans to that universe and tried to rescue him. However, the Tyrants defeated them and held them hostage. At that moment, the Brotherhood of Justice (good versions of the Brotherhood of Evil) came and defeated the Tyrants. Killowat, back at the Titans universe, was happy to be home, but Raven claimed that he wasn't yet. Raven brought the Herald and together, they opened multiple doors leading to different parallel universes. Killowat saw his friends fighting Slade's army, and urgently, he jumped into the portal, but not before thanking the Titans. Killowat was finally at home.

In 1529, it became a Lutheran church. It is located directly in the city centre, has a 125 m tall tower and features a famous organ by Arp Schnitger from 1693. It is dedicated to St James the Greater and often incorrectly referred to in English as St Jacob's. History The history of the church goes back to 1255 when St. James' was a small Roman Catholic chapel located outside the Hamburg city walls. After these were extended in 1260, it became part of the Hamburg city territory. It is now in the heart of the city, hidden behind one of the main shopping streets (M√∂nckebergstra√üe). Between 1350 and 1400, the chapel was replaced by a hall church with three naves, similar to St. Peter's. Around one hundred years later, a fourth nave was added to the south side of the structure. The sacristy in the northeast also comes from this time (1438) and is today Hamburg's only example of secular gothic architecture. From 1806 to 1813, when Hamburg was occupied by Napoleonic troops, the church was used mainly as stables. The second tower, erected in 1826/27 after the previous one had become dilapidated, was destroyed in 1944, along with the rest of the church building, by bombing during World War II. Only the historic interior furnishings were saved. It was not until 1963 that St. James' re-emerged, built to the medieval design, albeit with a modern spire. Notable features The Arp Schnitger Organ The building sits a few metres east of the 10th meridian east longitude, which runs through the city centre. The famous Arp Schnitger organ of 1693 in the west gallery, with 60 registers and around 4,000 pipes, is the largest baroque organ in Northern Europe. From 1989 to 1993, the organ was completely restored, and since its rededication at Easter 1993 it can be heard every Sunday during services. The 34 pictures in the organ gallery are the works of Otto Wagenfeldt and Joachim Lundt.http://www.jacobus.de/neu/deutsch/index_5_4.html They were created to portray the Bible in illustrations which everyone could appreciate and understand. St. James' has three medieval altars: the Holy Trinity Altar in the Main Choir (c. 1518, the St. Peter Altar in the first south nave (1508), and the St. Luke Altar in the second south nave (1500) that originally comes from the Hamburg Cathedral. The St. Luke Altar was built by the former Guild of St. Luke. All three were built originally to serve as Roman Catholic altars. Also worthy of notice is the Ministers' Room, which originally served as a library. Since 1543, it has been the collection room of the Cathedral ministers, and was remodelled in 1710. The ceiling murals, with their civic virtues, show the importance of maintaining parish to the city regiment. They were painted, like the landscape paintings on the wall, by Johann Moritz Riesenberger. Coats of arms on the walls name the pastors, vicars, and jurors who have served the parish since the sixteenth century. Windows The stained-glass windows are the work of Charles Crodel, who also created the windows of St. Matthew's Church in Winterhude and those of St. Mary's Church in Fuhlsb√ºttel. The windows depict in the main important events in the ecclesiastical year viz. Annunciation, Christmas, Passion, Good Friday, Easter, Pentecost.

Known for much of their length as Philadelphia Road, there are five disjoint mainline sections of the highway totaling that parallel U.S. Route 40 (US 40) in Baltimore, Harford, and Cecil counties in northeastern Maryland. The longest section of MD 7 begins at US 40 just east of the city of Baltimore in Rosedale and extends through eastern Baltimore County and southern Harford County to US 40 in Aberdeen. The next segment of the state highway is a C-shaped route through Havre de Grace on the west bank of the Susquehanna River. The third mainline section of MD 7 begins in Perryville on the opposite east bank of the Susquehanna River and ends at US 40 a short distance west of the start of the fourth section, which passes through Charlestown and North East before ending at US 40, just west of Elkton. The fifth segment of the highway begins at South Street and passes through the eastern part of Elkton before reconnecting with US 40 just west of the Delaware state line. MD 7 is the old alignment of US 40 in northeastern Maryland. The route was first laid out early in colonial times and later formed part of the post road between Baltimore and Philadelphia (going further north to New York City and into New England to Boston) and between the northern and southern of the original Thirteen Colonies on the East Coast. The highway in Baltimore and Harford counties became a turnpike, constructed and operated by a private stockholder company in the early 19th century. The Maryland State Roads Commission (established 1908 - now the Maryland State Highway Administration within the Maryland Department of Transportation since the early 1970s) marked portions of what became known as the Philadelphia Road, close to Baltimore and between Perryville and Elkton for improvement as state roads in 1909. Those sections and the highway between Aberdeen and Havre de Grace were constructed as modern roads in the early to mid-1910s. The remainder of the highway was constructed in the 1920s and designated as US 40 in 1927. The high volume of traffic and the required continuous expansion of the highway led the old Maryland State Roads Commission to construct the modern Pulaski Highway (mamed for the foreign military volunteer of a Polish cavalry officer Casimir Pulaski (1745-1779), who fought in the American Revolutionary War (1775-1783), which was constructed during the \\"Great Depression\\" years between 1935 and 1941. Old sections of US 40 became segments of MD 7 between 1938 and 1941 as portions of the new four-lane divided highway were opened from Baltimore to Elkton. Route description There are five mainline sections of MD 7: *MD 7 (without suffix) runs from US 40 in Rosedale to US 40 and MD 159 in Aberdeen. *MD 7A extends from US 40 west of Havre de Grace to US 40 and MD 155 in the city. *MD 7B has a length of from Perry Point VA Medical Center in Perryville to US 40 east of Perryville. *MD 7C runs from US 40 west of Charlestown east to US 40 and MD 279 west of Elkton. *MD 7D spans from South Street east to US 40 within Elkton. =Baltimore-Aberdeen= MD 7 begins at an intersection with US 40 (Pulaski Highway) in Rosedale just east of the Baltimore city line. The highway heads north then immediately turns east at a three-way intersection; the west leg of the intersection is Old Philadelphia Road, which is unsigned MD 7BA. MD 7 heads northeast as a two-lane undivided street through a residential neighborhood with scattered businesses and industrial properties as well as a crossing of Redhouse Creek. The route intersects MD 588 (Golden Ring Road) and expands to a five-lane road with a center left-turn lane before meeting Interstate 695 (I-695, Baltimore Beltway) at a partial cloverleaf interchange. MD 7 continues east past The Centre at Golden Ring shopping center, crossing Stemmers Run before its intersection with Rossville Boulevard in Rossville. The state highway reduces to two lanes and continues northeast through residential subdivisions on the westbound side and industrial facilities on the eastbound side of the highway. MD 7 expands to a five-lane highway with a center left-turn lane as it approaches Campbell Boulevard in White Marsh. The road passes between a pair of shopping centers before crossing White Marsh Run. MD 7 continues northeast between industrial parks, intersecting Industrial Park Road (unsigned MD 7J) before reducing to two lanes and crossing MD 43 (White Marsh Boulevard). Westbound MD 43 is accessed via a ramp east of the overpass. The state highway crosses Honeygo Run and passes through a mix of forest and residential subdivisions, intersecting Cowenton Avenue and Joppa Road before crossing Gunpowder Falls. MD 7 passes through farmland and intersects Bradshaw Road in the hamlet of Bradshaw before crossing Little Gunpowder Falls and entering Harford County. MD 7 eastbound in Rossville MD 7 heads east through forest and scattered residential subdivisions through the northern fringe of Joppatowne, where the highway intersects Old Mountain Road and MD 152 (Mountain Road). The route crosses Winters Run and intersects Edgewood Road and MD 24 (Vietnam Veterans Memorial Highway) in Edgewood. MD 7 crosses Haha Branch and meets Abingdon Road at Abingdon, which is home to the Nelson-Reardon-Kennard House. The highway intersects MD 136 (Calvary Road) in between crossings of Bynum Run and James Run, which flow into the Bush River. MD 7 temporarily expands to a four-lane divided highway as it passes through the commercial area of Riverside, where the highway meets MD 543 (Creswell Road) just south of that highway's interchange with I-95. The road passes through forest with isolated residential subdivisions, with roundabouts located at Seven Trails Drive and Holly Oak Circle. MD 7's name changes to Old Philadelphia Road as it crosses Grays Run. Beyond Stepney Road, the state highway curves to the southeast to cross over CSX's Philadelphia Subdivision, passing between industrial parks before reaching its eastern terminus at US 40 (Pulaski Highway) on the western edge of Aberdeen. Old Philadelphia Road continues east as MD 159 before becoming a county highway that serves an industrial area, intersects MD 715 (Short Lane), and passes the historic home Poplar Hill, after which the highway merges with US 40 just west of downtown Aberdeen. =Havre de Grace= View west along MD 7 in Havre de Grace MD 7 begins at an intersection with US 40 just west of Havre de Grace. The highway heads northeast as two-lane undivided Revolution Street, crossing over Amtrak's Northeast Corridor and passing through an industrial area before entering a residential area upon entering the city limits. MD 7 veers east to enter the street grid at Bloomsbury Avenue. The state highway turns north onto Union Street, which heads south as MD 490, adjacent to Harford Memorial Hospital. The route heads through the Havre de Grace Historic District, passing through a residential area about four blocks from the Susquehanna River waterfront through Congress Street, where the highway begins to approach the waterfront. Immediately after passing under the Amtrak Susquehanna River Bridge, MD 7 turns west onto Otsego Street. The road crosses Juniata Street, where a park and ride lot is located on the southwest corner of the intersection. The highway reaches its northern terminus at a five-way intersection with Otsego Street, MD 155 (Ohio Street), and US 40 (Pulaski Highway), which crosses the Susquehanna River a short distance to the east on the Thomas J. Hatem Memorial Bridge. =Perryville= MD 7 begins at the entrance to the Perry Point VA Medical Center just north and east of the Amtrak Susquehanna River Bridge adjacent to Rodgers Tavern in the town of Perryville. The highway heads east as two-lane undivided and municipally maintained Broad Street, passing under both railroad tracks of the wye of Norfolk Southern Railway's Columbia & Port Deposit line with Amtrak's Northeast Corridor, within which is the Perryville station that serves as the terminus of MARC's Penn Line. Maintenance responsibility transfers from the town of Perryville to the state at MD 222 (Aiken Avenue). MD 7 heads east over Mill Creek, past MD 327 (Ikea Way), and leaves the town limits after an intersection with Coudon Boulevard, which leads to US 40\\\\. The route continues east as Principio Furnace Road through farmland, passing the historic home Woodlands and Furnace Bay Golf Course. MD 7 passes the remains of Principio Furnace and crosses Principio Creek before reaching its eastern terminus at US 40. =Charlestown-Elkton= MD 7 begins at US 40 (Pulaski Highway) northwest of Charlestown, a short distance east of the terminus of MD 7B. The highway heads southeast as two-lane undivided Old Philadelphia Road in a forested area between a pair of quarries. As MD 7 approaches Amtrak's Northeast Corridor, MD 267 (Baltimore Street) splits to the southeast and crosses the tracks to pass through Charlestown, while MD 7 begins to closely parallel the tracks along the northern edge of the town. The state highway receives the other end of MD 267 (Bladen Street) as it curves away from the railroad. MD 7 crosses Broad Creek and Stony Run before passing under the Amtrak line. MD 7 crosses North East Creek and enters the town of North East, where the highway is known as Cecil Avenue. The highway intersects MD 272, which follows a one-way pair, Main Street southbound and Mauldin Avenue northbound. MD 7 leaves the town and passes through a forested area with scattered residences as Old Philadelphia Road. The route passes through an S-curve during which it crosses over a bridge to the north side of Amtrak's Northeast Corridor. On the north side of the bridge is a stub of old alignment, MD 7H. MD 7 continues east, passing Old Elk Neck Road before turning north and reaching its eastern terminus at US 40\\\\. The roadway continues beyond the intersection as MD 279 (Elkton Road). =Elkton= MD 7 begins at South Street east of downtown Elkton, heading east on two-lane undivided East Main Street. Main Street continues west into downtown Elkton as a municipally-maintained road. A short distance past MD 7's western terminus, Main Street continues east as MD 281 while MD 7 turns southeast onto Delaware Avenue. The state highway crosses Big Elk Creek and passes through a residential area before reaching its eastern terminus at US 40 (Pulaski Highway) about west of the Delaware state line. History =Predecessor roads and state road construction= MD 7 eastbound leaving North East The rough alignment of what is now MD 7 in Baltimore and Harford counties existed by 1695 as a rudimentary road; Baltimore County ordered that the road be widened to in width to allow easy passage for carts and for bridges to replace ferries at the numerous creeks along the route. In 1717, the route from Baltimore to Elkton became part of a new overland post road between Philadelphia and Williamsburg, Virginia. The highway between Baltimore and Havre de Grace was maintained as a turnpike, the Baltimore and Havre-de- Grace Turnpike, by 1825. This turnpike later became known as the Baltimore and Philadelphia Turnpike and, after collection of tolls had ceased on the highway, the Philadelphia Road or the Post Road. The final ferry along the route to be eliminated was the Susquehanna River crossing. The first vehicular bridge was a converted railroad bridge built by the Pennsylvania Railroad in 1873, replaced with the current Amtrak bridge immediately to the north in 1904, and converted into a tolled vehicular bridge owned by several citizens of Harford and Cecil counties in 1910. The Maryland State Roads Commission purchased the bridge in 1923 and removed the tolls in 1928. In 1926, the commission double-decked the bridge to increase the bridge's capacity. When the Maryland State Roads Commission laid out a proposed state road system in 1909, two sections of the Philadelphia Road were included: from the eastern city limit of Baltimore, then at Elwood Avenue, east to Rossville in Baltimore County, and from Perryville to Elkton. The highway was paved as an wide tarred macadam road from Elwood Avenue to Herring Run in 1910. The remainder of the road from Herring Run to Rossville was completed in concrete by 1921. In Cecil County, the Philadelphia Road was paved with a wide macadam surface from the eastern town limit of North East to the western town limit of Elkton in 1913. The highway was paved in concrete from Perryville to Principio Creek and in macadam from there through Charlestown in 1914. The state road was paved in macadam from Charlestown to North East, including Cecil Avenue within the latter, in 1915. The section of the state road through Charlestown, which is now MD 267, was bypassed with a concrete road that remained on the north side of the Pennsylvania Railroad by 1921. The section of the Post Road between Bel Air Avenue in Aberdeen and the former racetrack in Havre de Grace, much of which is now MD 132, was paved under the state aid system as a wide macadam road by 1911. The first section of the gap between Rossville and Aberdeen was filled with a concrete road from Bradshaw to Winters Run by 1921. The remainder of the highway in Baltimore County and the section from Winters Run to Bynum Run were paved in concrete by 1923. The final piece of Philadelphia Road in Harford County was completed as a concrete road from Bynum Run to Aberdeen in 1926. The highway was paved in concrete along Main Street and Delaware Avenue through Elkton, with the exception of a gap at the west end of town, by 1923. The gap between Elkton and the Delaware state line was filled in 1925. The gap at the west end of Elkton was left in inferior condition in anticipation of a grade separation of the Pennsylvania Railroad. This grade separation and its approaches was completed in 1929, completing US 40, which had been assigned to the length of the Philadelphia Road in 1927. =Improvements and construction of Pulaski Highway= Improvements to US 40 began shortly after its designation. The highway was widened to in width from Baltimore to Rosedale and from Aberdeen to Havre de Grace, and to between Rosedale and Aberdeen, by 1930. US 40 was also widened to from Perryville to the Delaware state line by 1934. The Cecil County section of the highway was widened again with a pair of shoulders in 1937 and 1938. The U.S. Highway was relocated to its present alignment through Aberdeen to eliminate a pair of crossings of the Pennsylvania Railroad between 1930 and 1933; the old highway south of the railroad tracks became an extension of MD 22. However, the very high levels of traffic due to being the main highway between Baltimore and Philadelphia led to calls for the highway to be expanded to in width along its entire length by 1934. Former MD 7 eastbound on Main Street in Elkton approaching MD 268 Rather than widen the existing road further, the Maryland State Roads Commission decided to build a new Philadelphia Road, later known as Pulaski Highway, as a divided highway on a new alignment between Baltimore and Aberdeen and to expand the newly relocated highway through Aberdeen to Havre de Grace to a four-lane divided highway. The new US 40 was started in 1935 and completed in 1938. The original Philadelphia Road between Baltimore and Aberdeen became the first section of MD 7. The next sections of the old highway to be bypassed were in Havre de Grace and Perryville when the Thomas J. Hatem Memorial Bridge and its approaches opened in August 1940, replacing the double-decked converted railroad bridge. The portions of the old highway on either side of the river became additional sections of MD 7. Construction on the new Philadelphia Road in Cecil County began in 1938 and was completed in 1941. Transfer of US 40 to its new alignment resulted in the addition of two more sections of MD 7 from west of Charlestown through North East to west of Elkton and through Elkton. Despite the bypassing of the original Philadelphia Road, improvements continued to be made to MD 7\\\\. The state highway was widened with dual shoulders from the Baltimore city limit to Rossville in 1938. MD 7 was widened through Havre de Grace in 1953 and through Elkton in 1954. The highway was relocated and became a divided highway on both sides of its intersection with MD 543 in Riverside concurrent with the construction of MD 543's interchange with I-95 in 1989. MD 7's roundabout at Holly Oak Circle in Riverside was installed in 2000. Several portions of the state highway have been transferred to local maintenance. The portion of MD 7 to the south of US 40 in the southern portion of Aberdeen was removed in 1950; MD 159 was extended north to MD 7's new eastern terminus and the remainder of Old Philadelphia Road became the responsibility of Harford County and Aberdeen. MD 7 between MD 213 and South Street in Elkton became one-way eastbound in 2001 and municipally maintained in 2003. The western terminus of that section of MD 7 was truncated at MD 213 in 2010, resulting in the portion of Main Street from a dead end at the Amtrak Northeast Corridor to MD 213 also becoming the responsibility of Elkton. In 2012, the MD 7 designation was removed from the portion of municipally-maintained roadway between MD 213 and South Street. In 2018, a roundabout was constructed at Seven Trails Drive.

They are common throughout Germany including its capital Berlin, where the first 100 columns were installed in 1855. Advertising columns were invented by the German printer Ernst Litfa√ü in 1854. Therefore, they are known as Litfa√üs√§ulen (Litfass columns). In France, the columns are called colonnes Morris after Gabriel Morris, a printer, who held the concession for advertising in 1868. They were originally built by La Soci√©t√© Fermi√®re des Colonnes Morris. Today, they are mostly built and maintained by the JCDecaux company, which purchased the original company in 1986. Development The idea of advertising pillars came about in order to combat rampant advertising and graffiti. Ernst Litfa√ü suggested that pillars should be built all over the city. People could then place their advertisements on these pillars. On 5 December 1854, after years of proceedings, Berlin's chief of police, Karl Ludwig von Hinkeldey authorized Litfa√ü' Annoncier-S√§ulen. Litfa√ü had exclusive rights to the building of these columns until 1865. Purposes Advertising columns are typically used to display advertisements in the form of posters, traditionally chiefly theater, cinema, nightclub, and concert announcements. Some are motorized and rotate very slowly. A few house Sanisettes or telephone booths. In 2017, anti-pollution Morris columns were tested in Paris: they contained materials which filter out particles from the air in order to ameliorate carbon dioxide pollution. At the beginning of 2006, there were 790 Morris columns in Paris; more than two hundred were to be removed. Cultural references * In the film The Third Man, Harry Lime (played by Orson Welles) uses one of these columns as an escape route to the sewer system under Vienna. * In the film Gremlins 2, Billy Peltzer (played by Zach Galligan) and Daniel Clamp (played by John Glover), use one of these columns as an escape route from the Gremlin-infested Clamp Building. * In the film Men in Black II, Agent K (played by Tommy Lee Jones) and Agent J (played by Will Smith), use a column as an escape route from an alien-infested MiB Headquarters. * On 1 July 2020, Google celebrated the advertising column \\"Litfa√üs√§ule\\" with a Doodle.

The city was built upon a complex of natural caves which were once used for the lagering of beer by early German immigrant brewers. Caves are naturally cool, which was especially attractive to brewers before the advent of refrigeration.Milestones of Missouri's HiddenHallows Breweries Uhrig's Cave beer garden, ca. 1870 Several breweries were built atop these natural caves, which were altered to suit their purposes. Stone arches and brick ceilings prevented water seepage and uneven cave floors were paved with brick. In addition to being used for the storage and lagering of beer, such naturally cool places were sometimes employed as beer gardens, places for entertainment. John Adam Lemp, coming to St. Louis from Germany in 1838, started a brewery using natural caves for refrigeration. His son William J. Lemp took over the business and built the Lemp Brewery industrial complex which still stands in St. Louis.Lemp Mansion The Lemp Mansion was constructed by the Lemp Family and included a tunnel through the natural cave system leading to the Lemp Brewery. The Lemp Family would use this tunnel to go to work. Underground Railroad An oral tradition in St. Louis links the cave system with the Underground Railroad. According to this tradition a tunnel behind the house at 3314 Lemp Avenue was used as a secret entrance to the caves. One entrance to the caves opens near the Mississippi River, where the slaves could make their way to freedom.Lemp Avenue Archeological Sites Cherokee Caves Commercial building for the Cherokee Caves.

Entrances Old caves were often filled with rubble from the buildings above them when they were demolished. Therefore, there may be many homes and houses currently built above entrances to the old system of caves which have since been filled in with rubble. The Lemp caves or Cherokee caves still exist. The original cave was around 24,000 feet walkable. After the construction of Interstate 55 there were about 22,000 feet of the cave remaining, but not open to the public.

He first took the stage in England, then immigrated to the United States in 1825. He received critical acclaim there, and eventually entered theatre management. During his tenure at New York City's Bowery Theatre he helped establish working-class theatre as a distinct form. His policies preferred American actors and playwrights to British ones, making him an important influence in the development of early American drama. Although he was known as a fair (if shrewd) businessman, Hamblin's reputation was marred by his well-known womanising and brawling. He had affairs with several up-and- coming actresses at his theatre, and he assaulted at least two newspaper editors who had published unflattering stories about him. His behaviour eventually cost him his first wife and resulted in one conviction for assault. Early life and stage career Hamblin was born in Pentonville, England. He apprenticed in a London business but changed course after a successful performance as Hamlet in a school production. By 1815, he had made his professional debut as a ballet dancer at London's Adelphi Theatre. He toured the British Isles over the next eight years, performing at venues such as the Drury Lane Theatre (for manager Stephen Kemble) and Sadler's Wells Theatre. He married Elizabeth Blanchard, a popular actress and daughter of actor William Blanchard and half-sister of actor/playwright E. L. Blanchard.Charles Kent, 'Blanchard, William (1769‚Äì1835)', rev. Nilanjana Banerji, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 Hamblin had two children by his first wife: William Henry Hamblin Jr. (stage name \\"Thomas Hamblin Jr\\") and Elizabeth \\"Betsey\\" Hamblin. Despite some success he had still not established himself with the London critics The Times, Monday, 24 October 1825; pg. 2; Issue 12792; col E: In the course of an unfavorable review of another actor The Times critic says \\"He must take his place, with Mr. Bennett, and Mr. Hamblin, and Mr. Booth, and a hundred aspirers to celebrity more; and \\"mature himself\\"...at the cost of some provincial theatre.\\" when, in 1825, Hamblin and his wife left England for the United States. Hamblin took the stage at New York's Park Theatre in early November,\\"Hamblin made his American debut in New York as Hamlet, Nov. 1 1825\\":'Booth at the Old Bowery', New York Times, 19 June 1887. where he tackled a number of roles: Hamlet, Macbeth, Othello, Petruchio, Pierre, Rolla, the Stranger, William Tell, and Virginius.Nichols 899. Later that month, he appeared opposite Edwin Forrest at the Albion Theatre. Hamblin as Red Riven Critics praised Hamblin; the Albion calling him \\"a very excellent actor\\".Quoted in Nichols 899. Theatre historian T. Allston Brown attributed his success to these factors: > As an actor, he possessed the valuable accessories of a fine person, a good > voice, and careful education. . . . In person he was tall and commanding, > but so admirably proportioned as in a measure to conceal his almost towering > height. Deep set eyes as black as jet were surmounted by a lofty brow, > crowned by clusters of curling dark hair in such rich profusion as is seldom > seen, except in some of the models which have been handed down to us from > remote antiquity. To see him dressed for Brutus, Coriolanus, or Virginius > was a study for a painter.Brown, vol. 1, p. 128-9. Francis Wemyss disagreed at least in part, saying that Hamblin's acting was \\"more than balanced by the husky, disagreeable tones of his voice, which always gave the appearance of hard labour to everything he undertook.\\"Wemyss, Francis (1847). Twenty-six Years of the Life of an Actor and Manager. Quoted in Nichols 899. The Bowery Theatre Hamblin began his tenure as manager of New York's Bowery Theatre with partner James H. Hackett in 1830. Hackett left a month later, and Hamblin obtained the lease and rebuilt when the theatre burnt down later that year. Hamblin catered to the tastes of the rowdy audiences of New York's Bowery district. These \\"Bowery B'hoys\\" were working class, primarily male, and socially conservative.,Wilmeth and Bigsby, The Cambridge History of American Theatre Vol. I, p. 156. and Hamblin accordingly staged blackface performances, circus acts, English farce, American melodrama, and Shakespeare to please them. Hamblin himself preferred upper-class entertainments like ballet and opera; nevertheless, he relegated these to infrequent bookings.Wilmeth and Miller 182. Under Hamblin, American working- class theatre, emphasising brilliant spectacle and plot-based narrative, emerged as a form in its own right. Perhaps Hamblin's greatest influence was in his incubation of American talent. He helped start the careers of many young unknowns, and he was not shy about exerting his influence over those who relied upon his patronage. His Bowery featured many big-name talents, including Junius Brutus Booth, Frank Chanfrau, George Washington Dixon, Louisa Lane Drew, Edwin Forrest, Josephine Clifton, Louisa Medina, James B. Phillips, Thomas D. Rice, and Charles W. Taylor. In 1831, he renamed the playhouse \\"the American Theatre, Bowery\\" after an anti-British riot at the Park Theater. The message was clear: The Bowery was the theatre of Native American drama. Hamblin was careful to cultivate good favour with his patrons outside of the theatre, as well. He regularly provided space to the fire department for their annual ball, for example. On another occasion, he loaned the Bowery's in-house orchestra to a local militia group for one of their functions. Hamblin's success can also be attributed to his hard-nosed business practices.Nichols 900. He advertised extensively, and he pioneered the concept of allowing productions to run for periods as long as a month. In the spring of 1834, he began purchasing shares of the theatre from its owners, the New York Association; within 18 months, he owned a majority. When the Bowery Theatre burnt down in 1836, it was the most popular playhouse in New York City.Bank 116. Hamblin bought out the remaining shares and rented the property to W. E. Dinneford and Thomas Flynn. They oversaw the theatre's reconstruction while Hamblin acted in various venues and took care of his debts. Hamblin rebuilt yet again after a fire in 1838 and returned to active management with a bigger Bowery in May 1839. In the 1840s, increased competition in New York City prompted Hamblin to stage even more spectacular melodramas and to book more variety entertainment such as minstrel shows and circus acts. After a fire in 1845, Hamblin tried to build a new theatre on Broadway, but local residents opposed the plan. Instead, he rebuilt the Bowery once more. Tastes were becoming more upscale, and Hamblin turned over active management to A. W. Jackson. He faced health problems, and his acting career stalled as his style became outmoded. The Albion reported that > The dignity, the finished and elaborated elocution, and the high artistical > execution of that school were occasionally brought most vividly to our > remembrance in Mr. HAMBLIN's delineation of Hamlet, weakened however at > times . . . by a dash of the melo-dramatic style and the laboured > pompousness he has acquired by long practice of his art at the Bowery.9 > September 1848. Albion. Quoted in Nichols 900. He attempted to extend his revenues by buying the lease to the Park Theatre in the summer of 1848. He renovated the building and reopened in September to mixed reviews. The building burnt down in December. Personal life The Flash, 31 October 1841. Hamblin's personal life was controversial. Although he was \\"noted for his correct business habits, promptitude, and open- heartedness\\",Brown 128. he was a well-known philanderer.Cockrell 115. Newspapers and rumours alleged that he had many sexual affairs. In 1831, his wife filed for divorce after returning from a tour in Europe; this was finalised in 1834 with the condition that Hamblin was not to remarry as long as his ex-wife lived.An article in the New York Times however consisting of theatrical reminiscences of Joseph H. Tooker claims that \\"He (Hamblin) actually paid his first wife for a divorce in order that he might marry another.\\" Tooker proceeds to quote from a legal document of release signed by Hamblin's wife Elizabeth, accepting payment of $2500 in return for making no further claims on her ex-husband's estate. The document is dated 2 August 1834: \\"Booth at the Old Bowery\\", New York Times, 19 June 1887. Hamblin continued his womanising undaunted; he saw a young actress named Naomi Vincent for a time, and she even came to be known as \\"Mrs. Hamblin\\". When she died in childbirth in July 1835, Hamblin entered a relationship with playwright Louisa Medina. He also pugnaciously brooked no opposition. He got into a barroom brawl in October 1834 and once assaulted the editor of the New York Herald, James Gordon Bennett Sr., in his offices.Brown 128-9. This latter fight led to a two-day trial and Hamblin's conviction in February 1837.Cockrell 192-3, note 102. In 1838, newspaper editor and blackface performer George Washington Dixon wrote in his Polyanthos that Hamblin was having an affair with a teen-aged starlet at the Bowery named Miss Louisa Missouri Miller. The girl was found dead within ten days of publication from \\"inflammation of the brain caused by the violent misconduct of Miss Missouri's mother and the publication of an abusive article in The Polyanthos.\\"20 June 1838 Boston Post. Quoted in Cockrell 115. The allegation was not out of character, and many people believed it. Hamblin reacted in his usual fashion: :George Washington Buffalo Dixon has this day [28 July 1838] . . . received a most tremendous quilting, at the hands of Thos. S. Hamblin. I have heard no particulars, except that Buff, as editor of The Polyanthos, was severely beaten by Arbaces. It is the only way in which his feelings can be reached.31 July 1838. New York Transcript, quoted in the Boston Post. Quoted in Cockrell 115. Arbaces, a character in The Last Days of Pompeii, was one of Hamblin's signature roles. Hamblin's ex-wife died in 1849,According to Joseph H. Tooker reminiscing in the New York Times, Elizabeth Hamblin died in New Orleans 8 May 1849, having re-married to an actor-manager \\"on the Southwestern circuit\\" named James Charles:\\"Booth at the Old Bowery\\", New York Times, 19 June 1887 and he married actress Elizabeth Mary Ann Trewar Shaw. She bore him four more children: Alla, Constance, Edith, and William Snowden Hamblin. Thomas Hamblin died of a \\"brain fever\\" (probably cerebral meningitis or cerebral syphilis) in his Broome Street home on 8 January 1853. He left eight heirs, each of whom received $10,000 from his estate.Brown 129. He was buried at Ocean Hill, Brooklyn. His family maintained ownership of the Bowery Theatre until 1867.

The Family Computer version of Field Combat was later released for the Wii's Virtual Console service exclusively in Japan on June 12, 2007. A sequel game, Field Combat DX, was released for Japanese mobile phones in 2004. Gameplay The object of the game is to make it all the way to the end of the battlefield using the Genesis; a warship that can fire off missiles. While the player controls the blue forces, the player must defeat the Red forces without dying in the process by either avoiding or shooting helicopters, infantrymen, and tanks. An interesting characteristic of the game is that it is possible to ask for reinforcements from an army, which the player possesses, by pressing both the A and B buttons at the same time. Whenever the player runs out of units to aid him in battle, he can use his special weapon to \\"absorb\\" the enemies and add them to his army. The game used Richard Wagner's Ride of the Valkyries as its background music. There is also an enemy UFO like spaceship that, when in battlefield, attempts to grab and escape with a player friendly unit (if there is any on the battlefield).It will also engage into air-to-air battle with a friendly helicopter (if there is any).  Reception  In Japan, Game Machine listed Field Combat on their April 15, 1985 issue as being the ninth most- successful table arcade unit of the year.

The other two are St. Mary's Church (Marienkirche) and St. Nicholas (Nikolaikirche). A fourth, St. Jakobi, was heavily damaged during the Second World War and subsequently demolished. St. Petri in 2006 Building St. Peter's Church was built in the middle of the 13th century. The first reference to a church on this site is in 1252, which is thought to be the predecessor of the current building. The triple-nave basilica is in Brick Gothic, a building style typical of the Hanseatic port cities of northern Germany. Damage The existing church had a tower 127m (413 feet) high, which was destroyed by a thunderbolt in 1543. In 1578 the tower was rebuilt as a polygonal spire after it had been, once again, damaged by storm. With a height of 117m (380 feet), the tower served as a landmark in the local area. After the Protestant Reformation, the church was used by a Lutheran congregation. In the following centuries the church decayed, and in 1902 the Basilica was renovated. Forty years later, however, heavy bombing during World War II again damaged the church and led to the collapse of the polygonal spire. View over the eastern part of Rostock's old town towards St. Petri Re-building Following the war, the building was gradually rebuilt. Today the church, roofed by a flat timber ceiling, reaches a height of 24m (78 feet). In 1994 a glass window in the choir was built to a height of 17m (55 feet). Public donations funded the building of a copper polygonal spire. With this, St. Peter's once again became a visible landmark in the surrounding area. Additionally, a 45m (146 feet) observation platform (accessed via steps and an elevator) provides fine views of the city of Rostock and the Baltic Sea. Description Interior The church is a three-nave Basilica with a high cross-vaulted ceiling in the west tower. On the north and south fa√ßade 4 times over are ever-alternating round arched arcades, each with a large rectangular window. In the central aisle of the tower, three high, round, arched arcades are on each side except the eastern side, where the tower joins the Basilica; at each of the four points there are three round-arched windows. The choir section is polygonal; at the north and south ends are small stair towers with pointed roofs. The design of the dividing inner-wall (zweizonige) exhibits the round-arched arcade design typical of Roman-Gothic style. Prior to World War II damage, the arched gallery was open. But it had been only roughly rebuilt when reconstruction began. The light coming in from the large rectangular windows, flows over the gallery. The cross-ribbed vaulted ceiling that covers the northern end of the nave is preserved. However, the southern nave was too badly damaged to reconstruct the original. Also, the central nave couldn‚Äôt be restored, so instead a flat-timbered ceiling was put in place. The baroque decoration in the interior of the church was destroyed by fire during the World War II bombing of Rostock on the night of 26 and 27 April 1942. The stained glass windows of the choir are decorated with scenes from the life of St. Peter. They were designed in the early 1960s by local artist Lothar Mannewitz (1930‚Äì2004).

Zoe Koplowitz at the finish line of the 2013 ING NYC Marathon, her 25th completed NYC Marathon Zoe Koplowitz (b. Lindsay Koplowitz September 12, 1948 in New York, New York) is a marathon runner who is afflicted with multiple sclerosis and diabetes, an inspirational speaker, and the author of The Winning Spirit‚ÄîLife Lessons Learned In Last Place. As of and including 2013, Koplowitz has completed a total of 25 New York City Marathons, all of them in last place. Her 33-hour-9-minute run in 2000 set a world record for the longest marathon time in the history of women's running. \\"The race belongs not only to the swift and strong but to those who keep on running\\", says Koplowitz.Biography, Zoe Koplowitz http://zoekoplowitz.com/About__Biography_.html At the conclusion of her 25th New York City Marathon on November 4, 2013 Zoe addressed the crowd which had gathered to see and cheer her finish. \\"It makes you understand that life is not happen stance or random all the time. That there is a plan, and it's a good plan. When we do things like the marathon, we get an opportunity to see how the pieces fit, and life no longer becomes this random series of crazy events. There was a lovely young woman with multiple sclerosis who waited hours in the street for me to come by. On one side of her sign she had my name in big bold letters. On the other side of her sign, she had something that reduced me to tears. It said 'Because you run every year, the rest of us continue to walk.' I thought that was really profound. I think the thing is that, the marathon is not just an adventure to me. It's a matter of living resources; it's not just stories to tell, it's what those stories teach you and how close you hold them to your heart through the year, and how strong and how brave and much a part of the running community they make you. It has been a truly amazing honor. I've done 25 of these, and it never grows old. There is life after disability. You can either go through life like this [arms closed], or you can go through life like that [arms open]. And for me, New York City is that. It's arms out reaching for possibility and hope every single year. I love this city. I love its strength, I love its diversity, I love its personality, and thank God it loves me back because I wouldn't know what to do if it was a one-sided love.\\" Koplowitz has appeared on many national TV and radio programs as a result of her long history of marathon completion. She has also been recognized for her related volunteer work by the National MS Society, the Achilles Track Club and other organizations. The U.S. Olympic Committee selected Koplowitz as a torch bearer in the torch relay leading up to the 2002 Winter Games.

The MSTP is currently training over 90 MD/PhD students. History The first official proposal to establish of a medical school at Mount Sinai was made to the hospital's trustees in January 1958. The school's philosophy was defined by Hans Popper, Horace Hodes, Alexander Gutman, Paul Klemperer, George Baehr, Gustave L. Levy, and Alfred Stern, among others.Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai ‚Äì History Retrieved July 15, 2008 Milton Steinbach was the school's first president. Classes at Mount Sinai School of Medicine began in 1968, and the school soon became known as one of the leading medical schools in the U.S., as the Hospital gained recognition for its laboratories, advances in patient care and the discovery of diseases. The City University of New York granted Mount Sinai's degrees. The buildings at ISMMS were designed by notable architect I. M. Pei. In 1999, Mount Sinai changed university affiliations from City University to New York University but did not merge its operations with the New York University School of Medicine. This affiliation change took place as part of the merger in 1998 of Mount Sinai and NYU medical centers to create the Mount Sinai-NYU Medical Center and Health System. In 2007, Mount Sinai Medical Center's Boards of Trustees approved the termination of the academic affiliation between Mount Sinai and NYU.MSSM Self-Assessment Retrieved September 11, 2009 In 2010, Mount Sinai was accredited by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education and became an independent degree-granting institution.MSSM Accreditation Retrieved January 11, 2011 On November 14, 2012, it was announced that Mount Sinai School of Medicine would be renamed Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, following a US $200 million gift from New York businessman and philanthropist Carl Icahn. In August 2016, Dennis S. Charney, the Dean of the medical school, was shot and wounded as he left a deli in his home town of Chappaqua, New York.

Chao was convicted of attempted second degree murder and two other charges in June 2017. Academics Icahn Medical Institute at ISMMS, built in 1997 and designed by Davis Brody Bond. ISMMS's medical curriculum is based on the standard program of medical education in the United States: the first two years of study are confined to the medical sciences, the latter to the study of clinical sciences. The first and second years are strictly pass/fail; the third and fourth years feature clinical rotations at Mount Sinai Hospital and affiliate hospitals, including Elmhurst Hospital Center, Mount Sinai Hospital of Queens, and James J. Peters VA Medical Center in the Bronx.Mount Sinai Hospital: Network Affiliates, Retrieved July 23, 2008 ISMMS's four-pronged missions (quality education, patient care, research, and community service) follow the \\"commitment of serving science,\\" and the majority of students take part in some aspect of community service. This participation includes The East Harlem Health Outreach Partnership, which was developed by the students of Mount Sinai to create a health partnership with the East Harlem community, providing quality health care, regardless of ability to pay, to uninsured residents of East Harlem. Since 1989, the ISMMS has also featured a unique early-admissions program, The Humanities and Medicine Program, which guaranteed students admitted to the program a place in the medical school. These students, known colloquially as \\"HuMeds,\\" applied during the fall of their sophomore year in college or university and did not take the Medical College Admission Test (MCAT). HuMeds made up about 25% of each year's ISMMS medical class.Rovner, Julie, \\"A Top Medical School Revamps Requirements To Lure English Majors\\", NPR, MAY 27, 2015; partner content from Kaiser Health News In 2013, the Humanities and Medicine program was expanded into the FlexMed program. Students admitted to the ISMMS via FlexMed will be able to pursue any major and will be required to take additional coursework in ethics, statistics, and health policy in lieu of or in addition to several of the traditional pre-med requirements. The school plans to recruit half of each incoming class through the FlexMed program. ISMMS's student body is diverse, consisting of 17.9% underrepresented minorities (URM) and 53.6% women. Individual educational programs are accredited through the appropriate bodies, including but not limited to LCME, CEPH, ACCME and ACGME. All degree-granting programs are registered with the New York State Department of Education. The tuition for 2020 was set at US $55,316.

It is the primary defensive and offensive piece of equipment used by and emblematic of Captain America. Over the years, Captain America has used several shields of varying composition and design. His original heater shield first appeared in Captain America Comics #1 (March 1941), published by Marvel's 1940s predecessor, Timely Comics. The circular shield best associated with the character debuted in the next issue, Captain America Comics #2. Abilities =Vibranium-steel alloy= Captain America's shield is virtually indestructible under normal conditions. While cosmic, magical or godly opponents have broken the shield, the shield has absorbed Hulk's blows, repelled Thor's mystical hammer Mj√∂lnir and deflected adamantium blades without visible damage. It is composed of proto-adamantium, a never- duplicated combination of vibranium, steel alloy, and an unknown catalyst. This material absorbs kinetic energy, transferring very little and thus preventing Captain America from feeling recoil or transferred impact forces when blocking attacks. The shield can bounce off of most smooth surfaces, ricocheting multiple times with minimal loss in aerodynamic stability or speed. =Ricochet ballistics= A common misconception is that the shield can \\"magically\\" return to Captain America. The \\"superhuman serum\\" that enhanced Captain America's physical attributes also improved his mental faculties‚Äîsuch as cognition, perception, balance, aim, and reflexes‚Äîto near genius-level. This allows him to instantly calculate ballistic-physics and predict the probable trajectory of objects in motion. This makes him a perfect shot. He can dodge or deflect bullets with his shield without collateral ricochet to civilians, to calculate where or how the shield will bounce and when it will return to his location, or trip a running person to cause them to fall into a specific position. Original shield New York Comic Art Convention program with Joe Simon's original 1940 sketch of Captain America. In his debut, Captain America (secretly U.S. Army Private Steve Rogers) is equipped with a heater-style shield made from steel. After complaints by rival comic-book publisher MLJ that the design was too similar to that of its own patriotic hero the Shield, Timely Comics replaced the triangular shield with a disc- shaped one. While the origin and fate of the original shield were not described in the original comics from the 1940s, the shield's fate was revealed decades later in 2001 through a retconned story. According to the tale, King T'Chaka of Wakanda met Captain America in early 1941 and gave him a sample of vibranium, an alien metal with unique vibration-absorption properties and found only in Wakanda and the Savage Land. The vibranium was used to make Captain America's circular shield, and his triangular one was retired. Captain America received a second triangular shield that he used until given his disc-shaped shield, presented to him by President Franklin Roosevelt. This second triangular shield was kept in storage with Rogers' other personal effects after the war. It was recovered at some point after Rogers joined the superhero team the Avengers in The Avengers #4, and was kept at Avengers Mansion. It was destroyed by the supervillain Mr. Hyde during a raid on the mansion by Baron Zemo's Masters of Evil, and later \\"plucked from time\\" and restored by Zemo in Thunderbolts #105 (October 2006). The shield (along with other sentimental items thought destroyed) was returned to Captain America. A third triangular shield is kept in the Smithsonian Institution. It was used by Captain America when he foiled a terrorist attack on the museum itself after the loss of his usual shield; it was then given to him in gratitude. This shield is destroyed several issues later by a Kree alien warrior. The shield destroyed by Hyde and restored by Zemo was eventually passed on to Elijah Bradley, the teenage hero known as the Patriot and leader of the Young Avengers. =Revised history= In 2010, the history of the original shield was revised. In the limited series Captain America/Black Panther: Flags of Our Fathers, Captain America, Sergeant Nick Fury and the Howling Commandos meet Azzari (grandfather of T'Challa)‚Äîthe Black Panther and king of Wakanda during World War II. Aided by Wakandan military forces, they repel a series of Nazi attacks led by the Red Skull and Baron Strucker. During the battle, the Red Skull (wearing a battle-suit) crushes the triangular shield, and Captain America uses a circular vibranium shield provided by T'Chaka to incapacitate the Skull. The weapon serves as the inspiration for the circular shield that the super-soldier begins using upon his return to America, and the encounter marks the beginning of friendly relations between the United States and Wakanda.Captain America/Black Panther: Flags of Our Fathers #1-4 (June ‚Äì September 2010), Marvel Comics Circular shield The round shield most associated with Captain America made its debut in Captain America Comics #2 (April 1941). An indestructible concavo-convex metal disc approximately in diameter, weighing , it has remained Captain America's most constant shield over the decades. In Captain America #255 (March 1981), it is established that the shield was presented to Rogers by President Franklin D. Roosevelt.Captain America #255 (March 1981) The shield is created by fictional American metallurgist Myron MacLain, who had been commissioned by the US government to create an indestructible armor material to aid the war effort. MacLain experiments with vibranium. Captain America vol. 5, #5 (May 2005). Cover art by Steve Epting. During one of his experiments to fuse vibranium with an experimental steel alloy,All-New OHOTMU Update: #2 (May. 2007), Marvel Comics MacLain falls asleep and awakens to find that the resulting alloy had set in a tank hatch mold. It was then painted to become Captain America's symbol. MacLain would later attempt to recreate the shield's metal to no avail, his experiments instead eventually yielding the super-metal adamantium.Captain America #303 (March 1985)Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe, Vol.1 #2: From Baron Mordo to The Collective Man (February 1983). Entry: \\"Captain America\\", pg. 22 Rogers' indestructible shield is more durable than regular adamantium and is arguably the most indestructible object in the Marvel Universe. The vibranium grants the shield unusual properties, allowing it to absorb all of the kinetic impact and vibrations from any blows that the shield receives without injuring Rogers in the process. The vibranium is also a factor in the way Rogers throws his shield: he often uses it to ricochet and strike multiple opponents or stationary objects with little loss of speed after each impact. After Rogers' death, Stark takes over custody of the shield, with one replica on display in a museum, and another replica buried with Rogers. The real one is kept by Stark to be used by the new Captain America, whenever they deem it appropriate to train a new one. After failing to find a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent capable of throwing it properly, Stark offers the shield to Clint Barton (known at that time as Ronin), who does manage to throw it. During his first outing as Captain America, Barton encounters the Young Avengers and scolds Kate Bishop for using the Hawkeye name. She tells him that the \\"Real Cap\\" gave her that name in honor of his at the time dead friend. This leads Barton to refuse to be Captain America.Fallen Son: The Death of Captain America #3 (July 2007) The shield is subsequently stolen by the Winter Soldier, who did not want anyone else to carry the shield. Inevitably, in an effort to honor Rogers' last wishes, Stark offers to let the Winter Soldier (Bucky Barnes) keep the shield, and to serve as the new Captain America. Bucky accepts. This offer is made \\"off the books\\", and only the two of them, the Black Widow, and the Falcon, are aware of the situation.Captain America #33 (Dec. 2007) Although Bucky attempted to return the shield to Rogers after his resurrection, Rogers let Bucky keep it as he felt that he could do more good in his new role as Commander Steve Rogers rather than Captain America, using a photonic shield in its place when circumstances called for him to go into combat. He reclaimed the shield for good after Bucky was apparently killed during the Fear Itself event‚ÄîBucky really going underground after his past as the Winter Soldier was exposed‚Äîthat also resulted in the shield being broken and reassembled by Asgardian blacksmiths, who add some of the mystical metal Uru to the reconstructed shield, making it even stronger than before, although it is left with a noticeable scar that Rogers decided to keep to give the shield character. This premise was not observed in subsequent storylines, or considered canon, as artists have not continued depicting the shield with the scar.Cronin, Brian (March 16, 2013). \\"Drawing Crazy Patterns ‚Äì Captain America‚Äôs Unbreakable Shield Breaking\\". Comic Book Resources. =JLA/Avengers= In the 2003-2004 Marvel Comics/DC Comics inter-company crossover limited series JLA/Avengers, Superman is given the shield by Captain America to wield in battle in the final confrontation with Krona, and is impressed with its might. When he asks where he could get one just like it while battling foes, Thor replies, \\"Enjoy it while thou canst, Superman. There is none other like it in all the worlds\\". Throughout the final battle, the shield changes forms between the pointed shield and the circular shield due to various temporal ripples caused by Krona's equipment, and Superman even loses the shield altogether at one point when he morphs into his energy form while Cap reacquires the photonic shield, although the metal shield reappears on Superman's arm after he morphs back into his regular form. =Destruction of the shield= Over time the shield has been damaged or destroyed several times within the confines of the Earth-616 continuity: In The Avengers #215‚Äì216, the Molecule Man used his total control over matter to disintegrate the shield, along with Thor's hammer, Iron Man's armor, and the Silver Surfer's board. After he does so, he comments that the board's molecules are \\"weird\\", and while there are \\"odd forces interweaving\\" among the hammer's molecules, the shield is \\"weirdest of all\\". He later reassembles these items, with the exception of the armor, as the electronic circuits are too complicated for him to understand at that time.The Avengers #215‚Äì216 (January ‚Äì February 1982), Marvel Comics During the 1984-1985 Secret Wars limited series, the shield is partially destroyed by Doctor Doom, who has stolen the power of the godlike being known as the Beyonder. Even broken, Rogers is able to wield what is left as an effective weapon, with the shield largely retaining its balance when thrown. When the Beyonder reclaims its power, the heroes are temporarily granted the ability to realize their wishes. Rogers uses this to reconstruct the shield.Secret Wars #11 (March 1985). Marvel Comics During the 1991 miniseries The Infinity Gauntlet, Thanos, who possesses near-omnipotence via the Infinity Gauntlet, shatters the shield with a blow of his fist while in combat with Captain America. The shield is soon restored by Thanos' alleged granddaughter, Nebula, when she obtains the Gauntlet and uses it to undo the events of Thanos's temporary godhood, resulting in her erasing the death and destruction that Thanos had caused over the previous 24 hours.Infinity Gauntlet #3 (September 1991), Marvel Comics Due to a stray molecule being out of place when Rogers reconstructed the shield using the Beyonder's residual power, a vibranium \\"cancer\\" was introduced to the shield, spreading with each subsequent impact until it finally shattered after it was retrieved from the bottom of the ocean. Learning that the vibranium cancer would require the destruction of the shield in order to cure it, Rogers took the shield to the main vibranium deposit in Wakanda so that he could use a device created by Tony Stark to halt the 'cancer' before it could contaminate the Wakandan vibranium and destroy the world, only to be intercepted by the villain Klaw, who sought to absorb the power and become stronger. Fortunately, the amount of energy Klaw had absorbed was released when he struck the shattered shield with full force after Rogers picked it up on reflex, resulting in Klaw unintentionally restoring the shield to its original state, realigning its molecules and destroying the cancer.Captain America (vol. 3) #22 In Avengers Vol. 3 #63 (March 2003), an enraged Thor, wielding the Odinforce, scrapes the shield. Thor later repairs it.Avengers Vol. 3 #64 (March 2003), Marvel Comics During the 2011 miniseries Fear Itself, the Serpent, the Asgardian god of fear and brother to Odin, breaks it in half with his bare hands. After the battle, the shield is repaired by Asgardian dwarves and Tony Stark with added Asgardian uru-infused enhancements and Stark's own technology to make it stronger, though a scar is left, and the dwarves are unable to repair it. Stark offers a solution to the scar, but Rogers declines, saying that it \\"gave the old girl a little bit of character\\". This premise was not observed in subsequent storylines, which did not depict the shield with the scar. Other shields * While Rogers was asleep in suspended animation, three other men used the identity of Captain America, all using steel replicas of the discus shield. The 1950s Captain America was placed in suspended animation after becoming mentally unstable. By the time he was revived years later, Rogers had returned. When the two clashed, the 1950s Captain America's shield was broken. * In the 1980s, in a story written by Mark Gruenwald, Rogers chose to resign his identity rather than submit to the orders of the United States government and took the alias of \\"The Captain\\" instead. During this period, the role of Captain America was assumed by John Walker, the former Super-Patriot, who used both the costume and the indestructible shield.Captain America #332‚Äì#351, 1987‚Äì1989, Marvel Comics In his new identity of \\"The Captain\\", Rogers initially used a pure adamantium shield provided by Tony Stark, but a falling out between the two as a result of the \\"Armor Wars\\" storyline led Rogers to return it. He then began to use a pure vibranium shield provided by the Black Panther. When Rogers returned to his Captain America identity, Walker became the U.S. Agent and returned the shield to him. Walker would go on to have his own array of different shields over the years, the first of which appeared to be the last vibranium shield Rogers was using as the Captain. The U.S. Agent used shields with an eagle motif and one in the shape of a star, as well as a photonic energy shield. * At one point, when Rogers was exiled from the United States and was briefly unable to use his shield, Sharon Carter provided him with a photonic energy shield designed to mimic a vibranium matrix. This shield was also able to turn into an energy staff that could be used as a weapon. * During the time when the shield was lost in the Atlantic, Rogers tried using a pure adamantium shield, but was unable to get used to the balance. He also tried fighting without a shield but also found it awkward. While up against HYDRA agents in the Smithsonian, he picked up the triangular shield that was being exhibited there and used it for a time before it was crushed by a Kree warrior. * Sharon Carter next provided him with another photonic shield, but one whose shape could be controlled to morph the energy field into a wider force field, a bo staff or even fire a projection of the shield. While he enjoyed the versatility, Rogers noticed a number of drawbacks, particularly its inability to ricochet. Rogers gave one of the energy shield gloves to a freedom fighter in an oppressive future he traveled to and received a replacement from S.H.I.E.L.D. when he got back to his own time. The photonic shield was eventually lost again in a confrontation with Ultron when Hank Pym's use of vibranium resulted in the destruction of the generator that created the shield,Avengers #19 - 22 (August - November 1999), Marvel Comics leading to Rogers finally reacquiring his original shield. * In Secret Avengers, he uses a new energy shield which could be generated on either arm, or both, and was able to be thrown and ricochet off surfaces to hit targets before it dissipates, preventing enemies from using it against him. A new shield would be generated moments later. Moon Knight, who had acquired a copy of the technology, had it described to him as a \\"zero point energy shield\\".Moon Knight #9 (2012), Marvel Comics * In Captain America: Steve Rogers, Steve wields a new version of the triangular shield that can deploy an energy blade on its pointy end and can be divided in two, allowing him to use both halves in combat.Captain America: Steve Rogers #1 Other versions *In the 1998-1999 time travel mini-series Avengers Forever, various future and alternate versions of Captain America are shown with many different variations of the shield.Busiek, Kurt (w), Pacheco, Carlos (p), Merino, Jesus (i), Avengers Forever #1-12 (December 1998 - November 1999), Marvel Comics *In the Marvel manga stories, Captain America uses a photonic shield before his death in Volumes 1 and 2, and his bodyguards use shields of metal. The shield also appears in the Rings of Fate mini-series, having been acquired by Carol Danvers after Elektra stole it from Avengers Mansion when she uses the costume of Captain America. * Captain Mexical is an alternate world version of Captain America from a dimension where the Aztec empire never fell. He is kept in the mainstream Marvel universe. His shield is used by Machine Man as a weapon during a zombie incursion; Mexical himself is slain.Marvel Zombies 3 #1-4 (October 2008 ‚Äì January 2009), Marvel Comics * Ultimate Captain America uses a shield of pure Vibranium, although that metal may not possess the same properties in the Ultimate Marvel universe as it does in the mainstream Marvel Universe.Millar, Mark (w), Hitch, Bryan (a), The Ultimates\\" #1 (March 2002), Marvel Comics The shield was destroyed when Gregory Stark smashed it with Thor's hammer, though Captain America would wield another later.Ultimate Comics: Avengers vs. New Ultimates#6 (September 2011), Marvel Comics ** In Ultimate Nightmare, Ultimate Captain America encounters his Russian counterpart, who has been driven mad due to being trapped in an underground complex for many years. He has created a \\"replica\\" of the shield, which turns out to be made out of scrap metal and human remains and grafted directly onto his forearm, and which proves far less powerful than Captain America's own shield.Ultimate Nightmare #3 (December 2004), Marvel Comics In other media Writer Brian Michael Bendis signing a fan's replica of the shield at Midtown Comics in Manhattan =Television= * In the 1970s Captain America TV movies, Steve Rogers is given a transparent plexiglass shield painted with concentric stripes (red and clear transparent) and a central star. The shield was designed to act as the windscreen for his motorcycle, but could be detached and used in its traditional offensive / defensive role when Rogers goes on foot. Furthermore, the shield can apparently return to Rogers in a smooth arc when thrown without needing to be ricocheted and with enough force to knock a man down in the return path. * In 2003, the company Factory X released a line of licensed prop replicas of items from the Marvel Universe. An aluminum replica of Captain America's shield was among their initial line up of props, and was limited to a production of 2,525 pieces. * In the closing of the March 12, 2007 episode of The Colbert Report, Stephen Colbert read a letter from Joe Quesada in response to Colbert's earlier comments toward Captain America. He was then presented with what was said to be Captain America's indestructible shield, reportedly willed to Colbert in the event of Cap's \\"death\\". The shield was originally credited to be one of the Factory X replicas, but this is not the case. The shield given to Colbert was originally acquired by the long-time writer and editor (and late) Mark Gruenwald, who either commissioned it or received it as a gift. It eventually found its way into the hands of Marvel Editor Tom Brevoort, and was kept in his office until being passed on to Colbert. In a pre-show conversation with a studio audience, Colbert, speaking out of character, said that when his wife saw the shield and the accompanying note, she started crying. He confessed he was a little bemused by her reaction to a fictional character sending a prop shield to a fictional version of himself. The shield was put on display hanging on the wall along with other trophies on The Colbert Report set for every episode afterwards. After The Colbert Report ended, the shield was moved to the set of Colbert's next talk show, The Late Show with Stephen Colbert where it was put on display since. * In the Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes episode \\"A Day Unlike Any Other\\", Loki uses his magic to shatter Captain America's shield while taunting him. In the episode \\"Behold... The Vision!\\", Captain America's shield is restored by the Black Panther and scientists in Wakanda using the vibranium machine that fused the pieces back together. * The adamantium-vibranium alloy version of the shield becomes the main plot device for the story in the Ultimate Spider- Man episode \\"Not a Toy\\". =Film= *Captain America's shield is a recurring image throughout the Marvel Cinematic Universe franchise: ** In the 2008 film Iron Man, a partially completed replica of Captain America's shield appears at the point where Pepper Potts comes in on Tony Stark trying to get out of his damaged armor; the shield is visible in the distance below Tony's right arm. According to a tie-in comic, Tony's father Howard Stark created the shield. Tony subsequently used the alloy of a prototype to create his armor. ** In the 2011 film Captain America: The First Avenger, the round shield (along with Rogers himself) is found by S.H.I.E.L.D. agents in the Arctic within a crashed aircraft in the present day. During World War II, Steve Rogers uses an ornamental version of the triangular shield during a musical tour promoting War Bonds, which he then uses in his first field mission and is rendered useless when Johann Schmidt punches a large dent in it. He later notices an unadorned vibranium shield among Howard Stark's proposed weapons, which Stark says is stronger than steel and weighs only one third as much. Although it is merely a prototype that Stark did not intend for one of Rogers' weapons, Rogers decides to use it after it is painted into the familiar red, white and blue pattern. The shield is later on board the Valkyrie when Rogers crashes the bomber, and becomes frozen along with him in the Arctic. ** In the 2015 film Avengers: Age of Ultron, the handles of the shield have been replaced with magnetic elements, allowing Captain America to control the shield and call it back to his gauntlets. Its status as a vibranium construct is referenced when the Avengers determine that Ultron is heading to Wakanda. During his later fight with Ultron, Rogers briefly loses his shield when it is thrown from the top of the truck where he was fighting Ultron, but Black Widow grabs it and returns it to its owner. When Wanda Maximoff triggers a vision of Tony Stark's greatest fear, he sees all of the other Avengers dead and the shield broken next to Rogers. ** In Captain America: Civil War, Rogers leaves his shield with Stark, following their violent confrontation and falling out. **In Avengers: Infinity War, T'Challa and Shuri present Rogers new dual- retractable vibranium shields in order to replace his traditional circular one he abandoned. ** In Avengers: Endgame, Tony Stark reunites Rogers with his circular shield when Stark joins the mission to undo the events of Infinity War, acting as a gesture of reconciliation between the two estranged friends. Tony reveals he kept the shield in his garage and jokes that his daughter might've soon tried to go sledding with it. While in 2012, Steve faces the past version of himself who mistakes him for Loki in disguise, leading to the two versions of Captain America using their shields in battle against each other. The shield suffers significant damage during Steve's battle with Thanos, whose sword proves to be a match for vibranium. At the end of the film, an elderly Rogers bequeaths his shield, now fully repaired, to Sam Wilson. * In the animated movie Ultimate Avengers, based loosely on The Ultimates, Captain America uses a shield made from vibranium and compound. Captain America received the vibranium shield while it was still a prototype. With this new shield, he fought against red skull. Before then, he used a triangular shield that he was fond of. The composition of the triangular shield remains unrevealed. It did prove to be effective against the bullets of German soldiers, but was not of practical use when he could use much more advance technology.

It is dedicated to the Virgin Mary and Saint John. Along with St. Mary's Church, L√ºbeck and St. Nicholas' Church, Stralsund, it is one of the earliest large examples of Brick Gothic architecture. It was built following the move here of the seat of the Bishopric of the Abodrites, established by Henry the Lion, from the old city of Mecklenburg in the late 12th century. The first cathedral was built of timber. The foundation stone of the stone cathedral of the Prince-Bishopric of Schwerin was laid in 1172. After a construction period of seventy-six years, it was consecrated in 1248. During the Reformation in 1524, it was confiscated from the Catholic Church and given to the Lutherans. It is now the seat of the Bishop of the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Mecklenburg. In 1222 Count Henry of Schwerin returned from a crusade with a reliquary of the Holy Blood, an alleged drop of Christ's blood contained in a jewel. This was placed in the cathedral, and caused it to become a place of pilgrimage. During the 14th century the nave and transept were completed, as well as the chapter buildings. At the end of the 15th century the cloister on the north side was finished. The tower, 117.5 metres high, was constructed between 1889 and 1893.

(1984), Larousse gastronomique (French edition), Paris: Librairie Larousse. Origins The origin of the dish and its name is disputed. One claim is that it was created from a mistake made by a fourteen-year-old assistant waiter Henri Charpentier in 1895 at the Maitre at Monte Carlo's Caf√© de Paris. He was preparing a dessert for the Prince of Wales, the future King Edward VII of the United Kingdom, whose guests included a beautiful French girl named Suzette.

Originally published by Simon & Schuster, Inc., 1934. although later contradicted by the Larousse Gastronomique. > It was quite by accident as I worked in front of a chafing dish that the > cordials caught fire.

Cr√™pes Suzette Different sources (like the Larousse Gastronomique) however doubt that Charpentier, rather than the head waiter, was serving the prince, because he would have been too young. A less fantastical version emerges from Elsie Lee's interview with him in the 1950s. There, Charpentier explained at length that \\"his complicated version began as the dish of pancakes with fruit sauce his foster mother made on very special occasions.\\" The addition of liqueur was au courant among chefs in Paris at the time. The other claim states that the dish was named in honour of French actress Suzanne Reichenberg (1853‚Äì1924),Claiborne, Craig (1994) Craig Claiborne's The New York Times Food Encyclopedia, Random House Value Publishing. who worked professionally under the name Suzette. In 1897, Reichenberg appeared in the Com√©die Fran√ßaise in the role of a maid, during which she served cr√™pes on stage. Monsieur Joseph, owner of Restaurant Marivaux, provided the cr√™pes. He decided to flamb√© the thin pancakes to attract the audience's attention and keep the food warm for the actors consuming them. Joseph was subsequently director of the Paillard Restaurant in Paris and was later with the Savoy Hotel in London. In 1896, Oscar Tschirky published the recipe as \\"Pancakes, Casino Style\\" with everything in place except the final flamb√©e.Oscar Tschirky, The Cook Book by \\"Oscar\\" of the Waldorf, p. 629 Escoffier described Cr√™pes Suzette in the English version of his Guide Culinaire in 1907 (French 1903) the same way, also without the final flamb√©e.

There are also amateur philologists who have used the quote, including journalist Suw Charman and journalist Vale White. \\"Nicoll events\\" Nicoll relates a number of life- and/or limb-threatening accidents that have happened to him, which he has told and retold on various science fiction fandom‚Äìrelated newsgroups. Over the years these stories have also been collected into Cally Soukup's List of Nicoll events. Inspired by Nicoll's collection of accidents, as well as his tendency to take in any stray cat that comes knocking, fantasy author Jo Walton wrote him a poem in 2002. \\"Brain eater\\" A post on soc.history.what-if credits Nicoll with coining the phrase \\"brain eater\\" which is supposed to \\"get\\" certain writers such as Poul Anderson and James P. Hogan. Nicoll claims the 'brain eater' affected Hogan, because of Hogan's expressions of belief in Immanuel Velikovsky's version of catastrophism, and his advocacy of the hypothesis that AIDS is caused by pharmaceutical use rather than HIV (see AIDS denialism). The term has been adopted by other Usenet posters, as well as elsewhere on the Internethttp://sadlyno.com/archives/4424.html#comment-100440 and use of the term within Usenet has been criticised. Nicoll-Dyson Laser Nicoll proposed the Nicoll-Dyson Laser concept where the satellites of a Dyson swarm act as a phased array laser emitter capable of delivering their energy to a planet- sized target at a range of millions of light years. E. E. Smith first used the general idea of concentrating the sun's energy in a weapon in the Lensman series when the Galactic Patrol developed the sunbeam (in Second Stage Lensmen); however, his concept did not extend to the details of the Nicoll- Dyson Laser. The 2012 novel The Rapture of the Nerds by Cory Doctorow and Charles Stross uses the Nicoll-Dyson Laser concept by name as the means by which the Galactic Federation threatens to destroy the Earth.  Science- fictional Lysenkoism  In a discussion on rec.arts.sf.written about why Golden Age science fiction so often uses aliens said to derive from short- lived but well-known stars such as Rigel whose lifespan is probably too brief to ever allow the rise of life due to the long-established mass-luminosity relationship for main-sequence stars, Nicoll identified what he termed the \\"SFnal Lysenkoist Tendency when actual, tested science contradicts some detail in an SF story, attack the science.\\" He expanded on this idea in an article for online science fiction and fantasy magazine Tor.com.Doing the Math: Aliens and Advanced Technology in Science Fiction Awards Nicoll was one of the finalists for the 2010, 2011, and 2019 Hugo Awards for Best Fan Writer. He has also been Fan Guest of Honor (GoH) at SF conventions including 2013's ConFusion in Detroit and 2014's Arisia in Boston. In 2020, he has been nominated for delegate for the Down Under Fan Fund, to visit science fiction fandom in Australasia as a representative of their North American counterparts.

They are quite common throughout their range, where they can be found in trees or on fences.  Description  Belly of male, showing blue color Adults are in total length, and are typically grey in color with black, white, or red-brown blotching down the back. Patterns vary greatly by locality, but the colors and pattern typically serve to be adequate camouflage against the bark of trees in its chosen habitat. The underside is usually uniformly light grey in color, but males typically have blue patches on either side of the belly. Their scales have a distinctly spiny texture to them. They have long toes, and sharp claws suited to climbing.  Behavior  Sceloporus olivaceous keeping a watchful eye A Texas spiny lizard using a red oak tree for camouflage The Texas spiny lizard is diurnal and arboreal. Their preferred habitat is mesquite trees, over areas with a significant amount of ground leaf litter, but they are often found in suburban areas basking on fences or climbing telephone poles. Typically shy and nervous, when approached they will usually retreat up a tree or flee noisily through leaf litter on the ground. They are insectivorous, and eat a variety of beetles and other insects. Breeding occurs throughout the spring and summer months, and clutches of eggs can be laid as often as four times a year. The male Texas spiny lizard also has a peculiar habit when challenged by another male for its territory. The two males will have a push up contest, or so it seems. Both males will begin doing push ups until one of them gives up and runs away.  In captivity  Though not normally found for sale outside of its native range, like most other Sceloporus species, the Texas spiny lizard makes an ideal choice for a small pet lizard. They are hardy, adapt easily to captivity, and readily consume commercially available crickets, though they do require specialized ultraviolet lighting.

The base of its spire, dating from the 13th century, is the second oldest building preserved in the city, after the lighthouse on Neuwerk island. It is situated on an island near what was formerly the southern boundary of the medieval city, opposite the historic harbour area on the Elbe river. It traditionally served as the church of the seamen. History The earliest attestation to the existence of the church dates back to 1256. The main body, consisting of a triple nave, was rebuilt during the mid-15th century in the north German Brick Gothic style. In 1657 a Baroque rooftop was added to the spire, which thus reached a height of 115 meters. The church was heavily damaged in an air-raid during World War II, on 30 July 1943. It left only the outer walls and the base of the spire standing. The building was restored between 1950 and 1957. Famous pastors have included Joachim Westphal and Philipp Nicolai. Organ St. Catherine's had an organ as early as the late 15th century, and by the 16th century it was considered the most important in Hamburg. This organ was replaced by a new organ built by Hans Stellwagen, rebuilt in 1670 and repaired by Johann Friederich Besser. In 1720, according to Johann Mattheson, this organ consisted of some 58 stops and approximately 88 ranks‚Äîdisposed over 4 manuals and pedals‚Äîwhich may have made it the largest organ in the world at that time. Among the organists who played here were Heinrich Scheidemann, Johann Adam Reinken (organist there for more than 40 years), and Johann Sebastian Bach. Bach first visited the church in the summer of 1701 and played here again in October/November 1720 when he auditioned for the post of organist at the nearby Jacobikirche; his Fantasy and Fugue in G minor, BWV 542 dates to this occasion. Bach greatly admired this organ, which featured two 32-foot ranks in the pedal, with four 16-foot ranks on the Hauptwerk (or Great) division and 16 diagonal shoe bellows to supply the wind to the instrument's windchests. Repairs were made in 1742, and a new lavishly carved decorated case was built; it was adorned with gilding and cherubs along with statues of angels playing trumpets. The organ and its case were destroyed during bombing of Hamburg during the Second World War, though 520 pipes from 20 different stops were preserved. Together with photographs of the case and a pre-1943 description, these pipes form the starting point for a scientific reconstruction of the instrument. The restoration, conducted by the Flentrop firm, was scheduled to be completed in June 2013. The R√ºckpositiv is already playable and was inaugurated on Easter Sunday 2009. The building of the three other manuals and the pedal towers started in September 2012. Two new registers will be added to the 58 described by Mattheson, bringing the total to 60.

The next two seasons saw them finish as runners-up to Dorking, before they won their fifth title in 1956‚Äì57.Surrey Senior League 1922-1978 Non-League Matters Although they finished as runners-up again for the next two seasons, the club went into decline at the start of the 1960s, and finished second-from-bottom in 1961‚Äì62. The 1964‚Äì65 season saw Banstead win their sixth Surrey Senior League title, claiming the championship on goal average from Chobham, and they moved up to the Spartan League. When the league merged with the Metropolitan‚ÄìLondon League in 1975, forming the London Spartan League, Banstead were placed in Division One. In 1979 the club switched to the Athenian League, where they remained until it disbanded in 1984, winning the League Cup in 1980‚Äì81. When the league folded most clubs (including Banstead) joining the Isthmian League, with Banstead placed in Division Two South. The league was reorganised in 1991, with the club placed in Division Two. They remained in the division until 2002 when further league reorganisation saw them moved to Division One South. Two years later another reorganisation saw them placed in Division One. At the end of the 2005‚Äì06 season Banstead resigned from the Isthmian League and dropped into the Combined Counties League Premier Division.

Radoslav then ruled over Syrmia as \\"Duke of Syrmia (Srem)\\", initially as an Ottoman vassal (1527‚Äì1530) and then as a Habsburg vassal (1530‚Äì1532), until the region was conquered by the Ottomans. His residence and capital was in Slankamen (sr). Life Radoslav hailed from Orahovica. =Service under Jovan Nenad= He was one of the generals of Jovan Nenad, the titular Serbian Emperor who occupied a province of the former Kingdom of Hungary which had been conquered by the Ottomans in 1526, in present-day Vojvodina. Jovan Nenad had defeated the Ottomans in Syrmia and the neighbouring regions, and had supported Ferdinand after John Zapolya refused to acknowledge his rule over Baƒçka, Banat and Syrmia. After defeating Zapolya's army he had himself proclaimed \\"Serbian Emperor\\". Jovan Nenad's army was then led by the chief general, Radoslav. In 1526, Radoslav held a province under Jovan Nenad, which included a town known as Belzond, near Sonta. By the beginning of 1527 the army had ca. 15,000 soldiers. In 1527, he is mentioned alongside Emperor Jovan in Subotica as his \\"personal and general captain\\". After the murder of Jovan Nenad (1527) and fall of the territory, Radoslav had an army of 2,000 in Upper Podunavlje. He had taken part of the destroyed and dispersed army from Baƒçka to Syrmia, and acceded into Ottoman service. =Rule of Syrmia= Radoslav then ruled over Syrmia as an Ottoman vassal and styled himself as the \\"Duke of Syrmia (Srem)\\", while his residence was in Slankamen (sr). At the same, he also secretly kept relations with the Habsburgs, which the Ottomans soon understood. Ferdinand had much hope in Radoslav. When the Ottoman army passed through Srem, Radoslav ƒåelnik crossed into Habsburg territory, and then returned when they had left. In 1530 he denounced the Ottoman vassalage and officially became a Habsburg nobleman, entitled the rule of Syrmia. In 1532, the Ottomans conquered Syrmia. =Retreat into Hungarian/Habsburg territory= With the Ottoman conquest of Syrmia in 1532, Radoslav retreated to Slavonia, and later lived in his town called Nebojc. It was located on the river Vuka, near Vukovar. Many Syrmian Serbs migrated into Hungary with the Ottoman conquest.

St. Johannis or Johanniskirche) is the oldest Lutheran church in L√ºneburg, Germany. It is located in the city centre. L√ºneburg is on the European Route of Brick Gothic and the church is an example of this style. History The church, dedicated to John the Baptist, is considered an important example of northern German Brick Gothic architecture. The five-naved hall church was erected between 1300 and 1370 and repaired in 1420. In the early 15th century Conrad of Soltau, as Conrad III Prince-Bishop of Verden, failed to make St. John's the new cathedral of his see, since the city council and the Prince of L√ºneburg resisted that fearing the political interference of another power. The outer structure was marked by rebuilding in 1765. Particularly striking is the lightly sloping steeple, which at a height of 108 meters is the highest church steeple in Lower Saxony. The stained-glass in the Elisabeth Chapel was made by Charles Crodel in 1969. The church is one of the attractions of the European Route of Brick Gothic. Organ The baroque organ in the Johanniskirche The church's organ was finished in 1553 by Hendrik Niehoff and Jasper Johansen and rebuilt in 1714 by Arp Schnitger student, Matthias Dropa and in the later 20th century by Rudolf von Beckerath. Among its noted organists were Christian Flor (1676‚Äì1697) and Georg B√∂hm (1698‚Äì1733). As a young man, Johann Sebastian Bach was resident (1700‚Äì1702) at a school attached to the nearby Michaeliskirche, where he appears to have been a kind of organ scholar. Documentary evidence suggests, in the opinion of Bach scholar Christoph Wolff, that B√∂hm gave Bach organ lessons at St. Johannis. The organ has been featured on BBC television in several programmes of \\"21st century Bach\\", a project in which John Scott Whiteley plays historic organs. Legend The 108-meter-high spire of the church looks as though it is sloping from each side: the truss on the upper part is twisted into a corkscrew shape. A legend states that when the master builder noticed the mistake, he fell from an upper window in the church tower; however, he landed on a passing haywagon, so he lived. Feeling that he had been vindicated by God, the master went into a local tavern to celebrate. After a few too many drinks he leaned back in his chair and fell over. As he fell he hit his head on the stone hearth of the fireplace and was killed.

It has ten titles, each containing numerous sections. Title IV: Protecting the Border aims to prevent terrorism in the USA through immigration regulations. The provisions of the title generally increase the difficulty of entering the country for those known to have, or suspected of having, terrorist intent. Title IV amends large parts of the Immigration and Nationality Act, giving more law enforcement and investigative power to the United States Attorney General and to the Immigration and Naturalization Service. Criticisms of the title include its lack of mention of judicial review for groups designated as terroristSee, e.g., \\"The Usa Patriot Act: One Year Later\\" , Michael Williams (14 November 2002), TruthOut. and its sections that mandate study of potential future legislative enhancements rather than enforcement action.Rosemary Jenks (December 2001), \\"The USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, A Summary of the Anti-Terrorism Law's Immigration-Related Provisions\\", Center for Immigration Studies. Subtitle A--Protecting the Northern Border Canada lies to the north of the United States. The Attorney General was authorized to waive any cap on the number of full-time employees (FTEs) assigned to the Immigration and Naturalization Service on the Northern border of the United States (the country to the north of the U.S. is Canada).Section 401 Enough funds were also set aside to triple the maximum number of Border Patrol personnel, Customs Service personnel and INS inspectors along with an additional US$50,000,000 funding for the INS and the U.S. Customs Service to improve technology for monitoring the Northern Border and acquiring additional equipment at the Northern Border.Section 402 The INS was also given the authority to authorise overtime payments of up to an extra US$30,000 a year to INS employees.The Department of Justice Appropriations Act, 2001 was amended by section 404 of the Patriot Act. Access was given to the Department of State and the INS to certain identifying information in the criminal history records of visa applicants and applicants for admission to the United States.Section 403 of the Patriot Act amends or Section 105 of the Immigration and Nationality Act The information that may be exchanged include the criminal history record information contained in the National Crime Information Center's Interstate Identification Index (NCIC-III), Wanted Persons File and any other files maintained by the National Crime Information Center. Such information is provided as an extract from an automated visa lookout system or other appropriate database, and is provided free of charge. However, for the Department of State to obtain the full criminal record, it must first submit the applicant's fingerprints to the Criminal Justice Information Services Division of the FBI. The Department of State was required to form final regulations that govern the procedures for taking fingerprints and the conditions with which the department was allowed to use such information. The final regulations are specified in 22 CFR 40.5. Additionally, a technology standard to become the technology basis for a cross-agency, cross-platform electronic system was mandated to be developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to be used to verify the identity of persons applying for a United States for the purposes of conducting background checks, confirming identity, and ensuring that a person has not received a visa under a different name. This report was released on November 13, 2002,National Institute of Standards and Technology, November 13, 2002. \\"Use of Technology Standards and Interoperable Databases With Machine-Readable, Tamper-Resistant Travel Documents\\" (Appendix A) however, according to NIST, this was later \\"determined that the fingerprint system used was not as accurate as current state-of-the-art fingerprint systems and is approximately equivalent to commercial fingerprint systems available in 1998\\"NIST Image Group's Fingerprint Research , see the section \\"NIST Patriot Act Work\\" (accessed June 28, 2006) This report was later superseded by section 303(a) of the Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry Reform Act of 2002. Subtitle B--Enhanced immigration provisions =Terrorism definitions= The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) was retroactively amended to disallow aliens who are part representatives of a foreign organization or any group who endorses acts of terrorism the ability to enter the United States.Section 411 of the USA PATRIOT Act This includes any alien who has used their prominence to persuade others to support terrorist activities. The child or spouse of such an alien is also inadmissible to the U.S. for a period of 5 years since the alien's last known terrorist action, though this does not apply in cases where the spouse or child was not aware such activities were being undertaken. An exception is also made in cases where a consulate official or the U.S. Attorney General is aware the alien has renounced their terrorist activities. Any alien who the Secretary of State, after consultation with the Attorney General, or the Attorney General, after consultation with the Secretary of State, determines has been associated with a terrorist organization and intends while in the United States to engage in activities that could endanger the welfare, safety, or security of the United States is also inadmissible. Several definitions were defined or amended in the INA. The definition of \\"terrorist activity\\" was strengthened to include actions involving the use of any dangerous device (and not just explosives and firearms). To \\"engage in terrorist activity\\" is defined as committing, inciting to commit or planning and preparing to undertake an act of terrorism. Included in this definition is the gathering of intelligence information on potential terrorist targets, the solicitation of funds for a terrorist organization or the solicitation of others to undertake acts of terrorism. Those who provide knowing assistance to a person who is planning to perform such activities are defined as undertaking terrorist activities. Such assistance includes affording material support, including a safe house, transportation, communications, funds, transfer of funds or other material financial benefit, false documentation or identification, weapons (including chemical, biological, or radiological weapons), explosives, or training to perform the terrorist act. The INA criteria for making a decision to designate an organization as a terrorist organization was amended to include the definition of a terrorist act as specified in section 140(d)(2) of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1988 and 1989. When an organization is to be designated a terrorist organization, seven days before making the designation under the Secretary of State must make a classified notification of this and the reasoning behind the decision in writing to the Speaker and Minority Leader of the House of Representatives, the President pro tempore of the U.S. Senate, the Majority and Minority Leaders of the United States Senate, and the members of the relevant committees of the House of Representatives and the Senate. The Secretary must also publish the designation in the Federal Register seven days after providing the notification. The Secretary of State can redesignate any such organization at the end of a two-year redesignation period for an additional two years if the situation that caused the original designation has not changed. Though the amendment is retroactive, this does not mean that it can be applied to members who joined an organization, but since left, before it was designated to be a terrorist organization under by the Secretary of State.USA PATRIOT Act ¬ß 411(c)(3)(A) =Mandatory detention provisions = The Act added a new section (section 236A) to the INA, which requires the Attorney General, or his deputy, to take into custody any alien who is engaged in terrorism, or who is engaged in an activity that endangers U.S. national security, or who is inadmissible or deportable because it is certified they: * are attempting to enter in order to undertake illegal espionage, are exporting goods, technology or sensitive information illegally or are attempting to control or overthrow the government; or * have, or will have, engaged in terrorist activities.Mandatory detention provisions are defined in section 412 of the USA PATRIOT Act The Attorney General or the Attorney General's deputy may maintain custody of the alien until they are removed from the U.S., unless it is no longer deemed they should be removed, in which case they are released. The alien can be detained for up to 90 days but can be held up to 6 months after it is deemed that they are a national security threat. However, removal proceedings or an arrest must be made no longer than 7 days after the alien's detention, otherwise the alien will be released. The certification of the alien must be reviewed every 6 months by the Attorney General, who can then decide to revoke it -- unless that is prohibited by law. Every 6 months the alien may apply, in writing, for the certification to be reconsidered. Judicial review of any action or decision relating to this section, including judicial review of the merits of a certification, can be held under habeas corpus proceedings. Such proceedings can be initiated by an application filed with the United States Supreme Court, by any justice of the Supreme Court, by any circuit judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, or by any district court otherwise having jurisdiction to entertain the application. The final order is subject to appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Provisions were also made for a report to be required of the U.S. Attorney General every six months which details: * the number of aliens certified under the INA, * the grounds for such certifications, * the nationalities of the aliens who were certified, * the length of the detention for each certified alien, and * the number of aliens who were certified who were granted any form of relief from removal, removed or who were determined by the Attorney General to be no longer aliens who may be certified or who were released from detention. =Multilateral cooperation against terrorists= The issuance or refusal of visas or permits to enter the United States are confidential except when such records are needed by a court in the interest of justice. Section 413 amended this to allow the Secretary of State to provide to a foreign government information about aliens in the Department of State‚Äôs computerized visa lookout database and other relevant records so they can prevent, investigate, or punish acts that would constitute a crime in the United States. =Visa integrity and security= Under section 414, the sense of Congress was given that the U.S. Secretary of State should expedite the full implementation of the integrated entry and exit data system for airports, seaports, and land border ports of entry specified in the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA).Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, Section 110 The sense of Congress was also that the U.S. Attorney General should immediately start the Integrated Entry and Exit Data System Task Force specified in section 3 of the Immigration and Naturalization Service Data Management Improvement Act of 2000. The task force is made up of 16 representatives of a variety of governmental agencies (section 415 of the Patriot Act specifies that the Office of Homeland Security must be involved with the Entry-Exit Task Force) and evaluates how the Attorney General can efficiently and effectively carry out the implementation of the integrated entry and exit data system. It also takes into consideration how the U.S. can improve the flow of traffic at such points of entry by enhancing systems for data collection and data sharing, increasing cooperation between the public and private sectors, increasing cooperation among Federal agencies and among Federal and State agencies; and modifying information technology systems while taking into account the different data systems, infrastructure, and processing procedures of airports, seaports, and land border ports of entry. The section also ensured that there was enough money for the implementation of the integrated entry and exit data system. The section specifies that the primary focus of development of the system was to be on the utilization of biometric technology and the development of tamper-resistant documents readable at ports of entry. The section also specified that the system was to be able to interface with law enforcement databases. At the end of 12 months, the Office of Homeland Security was to present a report to Congress on the information that is needed from any U.S. agency to effectively screen visa applicants and applicants for admission to the U.S. to identify those affiliated with terrorist organizations or those that pose any threat to the safety or security of the U.S.. =Foreign student monitoring program= Section 416 of the Patriot Act requires the U.S. Attorney General to implement and expand the foreign student monitoring program that was established under section 641(a) of the IIRIRA and record the date and port of entry of each foreign student. It also expanded the program to include other approved educational institutions. This includes air flight schools, language training schools or vocational schools that are approved by the Attorney General, in consultation with the Secretary of Education and the Secretary of State. The section appropriated US$36,800,000 for the Department of Justice to implement section 641(a) of the IIRIRA. =Machine readable passports= The INA authorizes the U.S. Attorney General and Secretary of State to waive the visa requirement for aliens under certain circumstancesThe circumstances where visas can be waived is documented in . Section 417 of the Patriot Act makes it a requirement of the Secretary of State to audit, and report to Congress on the results of the audit, the visa waiver program for each fiscal year until September 30, 2007, and also to check for the implementation of precautionary measures to prevent the counterfeiting and theft of passports as well as ascertain that countries designated under the visa waiver program have established a program to develop tamper-resistant passports. To qualify for the waiver, the INA specifies that the alien must have provided a valid machine-readable passport. However, from October 1, 2003 till September 30, 2007 this requirement is waived if the Secretary of State finds that the alien's home country is making progress toward ensuring that machine readable passports are generally available to its nationals, or is taking reasonable steps to protect against the misuse of non- machine readable passports. =Prevention of consulate shopping= The U.S. Secretary of State was required to determine whether consulate shopping was a problem, which is the practice of applying for visas at different consulate posts in the hope of finding one that will be more sympathetic to the applicant and thus approve the visa. Section 418 of the Patriot Act required the Secretary to report back to Congress if it was. No report was ever filed. Subtitle C--Preservation of immigration benefits for victims of terrorism Subtitle C was introduced by Senators John Conyers and Patrick Leahy as they recognised that some families, through no fault of their own, would either be ineligible for permanent residence in the United States due to being unable to make important deadlines because of the September 11 terrorist attacks, or had become ineligible to apply for special immigration status because their loved one died in the attacks.Office of Patrick Leahy, USA PATRIOT Act Section-by- section analysis The legislation defines an \\"age-out\\" protection for children who are part of a petition for citizenship in that it allows those whose 21st birthday occurs in September 2001 and whose parents had applied for citizenship before September 11, 2001 to be defined as a child for 90 days after their 21st birthday. Those whose 21st birthday occurs after September 2001 are considered to be a child for 45 days after their 21st birthday.Section 424 of the USA PATRIOT Act Provisions were also made to allow the U.S. Attorney General to provide temporary administrative relief for humanitarian purposes or to ensure family unity to those who were residing in the U.S. before September 11, 2001 and who were the spouse, parent, or child of the individual who died as a result of the terrorist attacks.Section 425 of the USA PATRIOT Act In order to carry out the Act, the U.S. Attorney General was given authority to establish appropriate standards for evidence demonstrating that death, disability or loss of employment due to physical damage or destruction of a business occurred because of the terrorist attacks. The Attorney General was not required to promulgate regulations prior to implementing the subtitle.Section 426 of the USA PATRIOT Act No benefits applied to those deemed to be terrorists or family members of terrorists.Section 427 of the USA PATRIOT Act =Special immigrant and non immigrant status= Section 421 allowed special immigrant status to be given to the spouses and children, or grandparents and children, of a petitioner for such status if they had been killed or maimed severely as a direct result of the attacks, and thus had their petition nullified. In order to gain the status, an immigrant must follow the procedure as outlined in section 204 of the INA. Under section 422, those who had entered the U.S. as a spouse or child of a principal nonimmigrant who was killed or disabled as a direct result of the terrorist attacks were given an extension of their nonimmigrant status for one year after the attacks took place. There were also given the right to be provided with an \\"employment authorization\\" endorsement no later than 30 days after they made the application for it. If the nonimmigrant was prevented from filing a timely application for a change or extension of non- immigrant status due to the terrorist attacks, they were given a 60-day extension. Alternatively, if the non-immigrant was lawfully present in the U.S. on September 10, 2001 and was unable to depart because of the attacks, they were not counted as being unlawfully present in the U.S for the period of September 11 to November 11, 2001. Conversely, if the non-immigrant was abroad and was unable to return to the U.S. in order to file an application for extension of their nonimmigrant status then they were given an extra 60 days to file for their extension, and their status continued to the date the status would ordinarily terminated, or 60 days after this date, whichever came later. The circumstances under which delays in filing were to be considered were: * office closures; * mail or courier service cessations or delays; and * other closures, cessations, or delays affecting case processing or travel necessary to satisfy legal requirements The circumstances under which departure and return delays were to be considered were: * office closures; * airline flight cessations or delays; and * other closures, cessations, or delays affecting case processing or travel necessary to satisfy legal requirements. =Diversity Immigrant Visa= If an immigrant was given a Diversity Immigrant Visa (better known as the Green Card Lottery), but was unable to use it due to the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, then they were able to use it in the period beginning on October 1, 2001, and ending on April 1, 2002. The circumstances under which an alien might claim they were prevented from using the visa were: * office closures; * mail or courier service cessations or delays; * airline flight cessations or delays; and * other closures, cessations, or delays affecting case processing or travel necessary to satisfy legal requirements. If the principal alien who received a Diversity Immigrant Visa died as a result of the attacks, then his or her spouse and children were entitled to the same status until June 30, 2002. =Other visas and paroles= If an alien was not able to enter the U.S. due to the attacks and their visa was due to expire before December 31, 2001, then the visa was extended to December 31, 2001. Similarly, any alien who was given parole by the U.S. Attorney General but was unable to enter into the U.S. due to the attacks had their parole extended by 60 days. In both cases, the circumstances that were to be considered were: * office closures; * airline flight cessations or delays; and * other closures, cessations, or delays affecting case processing or travel necessary to satisfy legal requirements. =Immediate relatives= The INA normally requires a U.S. citizen to have been married to a non-U.S. person for two years before they can be granted U.S. citizenship. However, section 423 of the Patriot Act waived the two year criteria for those who were spouses or children of a citizen who was killed in the 9/11 terrorist attacks. The spouse or children must have made a petition to the U.S. Attorney General within 2 years of the attacks -- therefore this provision has well and truly passed.

Development  Development in the United States has seen the system tested in 1981, when researchers had mounted the system to a KC-135 Stratotanker and successfully destroyed 5 AIM-9 Sidewinder missiles and a simulated cruise missile. The laser used in these tests was the \\"Chemical Oxygen Iodine Laser\\" (COIL) and was developed in 1977, and used $1,000 of chemicals each time the laser fired and emitted in the Infrared frequency.  Functionality  Airborne lasers have enough energy when fired to vaporize the metal of the missile that it is currently targeting. \\"It deposits enough heat to laze a hole through it. It's like taking a magnifying glass and burning a hole through a piece of paper, but we do it through metal,\\" said Dr. Keith Truesdell, Phillips Lab chief of the applied laser technology branch. To help with firing, newer ABL systems utilize tracking lasers which have been tested recently in 2007 when the US Missile Defense Agency tested the track illuminator laser (TILL) on the Boeing NC-135. The TILL is a solid state laser and is a key part of the fire control of the ABL system. Issues As stated before, operational costs of an airborne laser are quite high. And the projected cost of the program was listed as 5.1 million USD in 2009 according to the US Department of Defense. Along with the issues of price, there is also the issue of sensitivity of the laser itself. \\"Jitter\\" is a result of the chemicals in the laser burning off and creating turbulence under the plane, which will result in targeting issues.

He fought during the latter part of the Hundred Years War, and during the English dynastic Wars of the Roses. Early life Born circa 1405, he was the third son of Ralph Neville, 1st Earl of Westmorland, and his second wife, Joan Beaufort. His mother was the legitimised daughter of John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster and Katherine Swynford. John of Gaunt was the third surviving son of King Edward III of England and Philippa of Hainault. William was therefore a great-grandson of Edward III. However, the terms of the legitimisation of the Beaufort family specifically excluded them and their descendants from succession to the throne. William was one of a number of the Neville sons to make a good match, marrying the Fauconberg heiress, Joan de Fauconberg, 6th Baroness Fauconberg suo jure, daughter of Thomas de Fauconberg, 5th Baron Fauconberg by his second wife, Joan Brounflete (died 1409), and taking the title Lord Fauconberg; just as his nephew, Richard Neville, married the Warwick heiress and became Earl of Warwick. William's marriage took place at some point before 1422. His wife was four years older than he was and was described as an idiot from birth. The Fauconberg estates were in North Yorkshire, a centre of power for other members of the Neville family. Loyalty to the Crown He seemingly had a conventional military career during the earlier part of Henry VI's reign. Knighted in May 1426, he was serving on the Scottish Borders in 1435. In 1436, he was serving with Richard, Duke of York, in France -- his first contact with a man who was later to receive his allegiance. By 1439, he was a field commander in France, with Lords Talbot and Scales. At the siege of Harfleur in 1440, he was made a Knight of the Garter for his part in the campaigns of 1438-39, in particular the capture and garrisoning of Meaux. The town where Henry V had died was a crucial marches town for English Normandy. They had re- supplied the town, also retaking Montargis and Gerberoy. Fauconberg fought with the relief at Meaux when Richemont seized the stronghold by storm on 12 August 1439. The English lords forced a confrontation, but the French fled, leaving twenty barges laden with supplies.J Barker, \\"Conquest: the English kingdom of France\\", 275 As one of the three field commanders, Neville had been put on the royal council since 30 April, on Warwick's death, before a new regent could emerge.Barker, 282. In October, Fauconberg helped recapture Harfleur, expelling the French garrison; only Dieppe remained intransigent.Barker, 286. The field commander's pre-eminence was supplanted in March 1442 by the appointment of William, Lord Bourgchier, as governor-general of Normandy.Barker, 290-1. On 7 March 1443, while back in England, he took custody of Roxburgh Castle. He was granted ¬£1,000 per annum (around ¬£1,000,000 at 2005 prices) during peacetime, twice this if at war with Scotland, and until 1448, satisfactory payment was made. However, in 1449, he returned to France as part of a diplomatic mission, and in May 1449 he spent the night that the French chose to capture Pont de l'Arche in Normandy. One hundred and twenty men were taken in all. Neville was reluctant to surrender to a lowly archer, who almost killed him. While in captivity in France, he spent two years of his own income supporting the upkeep of the castle. In spite of a grant from Parliament in 1449, by 1451 he was owed ¬£4,109. He was forced to settle for less. The loss of such an experienced captain was a blow to English administration.Barker, 375-6. The English had already lost the Bretons for taking their salt fleet, and then in July 1449, Somerset refused Fauconberg's return in a deal for Fougeres.Barker, 379. In 1453, he was ransomed (for 8,000 French ecus) and freed from captivity. He still had the custody of Roxburgh Castle, but was impoverished by maintaining this and by his captivity in France. By now, he was owed ¬£1,000 by the government. He settled this by accepting a grant of 1,000 marks from the customs at Newcastle. Not only was this only worth about two-thirds of the original amount, there was no guarantee that he would ever get the money. As Griffths says, \\"What is so remarkable about his tale is that the Lancastrian crown could command [his] loyalty\\". Alliance with York Until this point, he can be seen as a loyal supporter of the House of Lancaster. However, at some time during the next two years, his allegiance began to shift. He was a member of the council of Richard, Duke of York, during Henry VI's second period of madness. Although he was with the Lancastrian nobility at the First Battle of St Albans (1455), he was appointed by York to be joint Constable of Windsor Castle after the battle. His alignment with York, who was his brother-in-law, was natural, as his brother, the Earl of Salisbury and his nephew the Earl of Warwick (the \\"Kingmaker\\") were Richard's principal allies. In 1457, he joined Warwick (appointed Captain of Calais) as his deputy. Warwick used Calais as a base for what was essentially piracy, and Fauconberg seems to have been happy to assist. He was in England in 1458, and in May he was briefly imprisoned in London -- but he was bailed by Warwick and returned to Calais. Awards and appointments The rewards of victory followed. He was made a member of the King's Council and appointed Lieutenant of the North. On 1 November, he was created Earl of Kent and appointed Steward of the Royal Household. In July 1462, he was appointed Lord Admiral, and in August that year he was granted 46 manors in the West Country. Edward IV relied on him for both land and naval warfare. Following the victory at Towton, he took part in the gradual establishment of royal control in Northumberland, heading a garrison of 120 men at Newcastle in the summer of 1461, and taking part in the siege of Alnwick in November 1462. Between these dates, he was back in Calais, raiding the Breton coast in August 1462, then burning Le Conquet near Brest, and raiding the Ile de Re. He died on 9 January 1463, and was buried at Gisborough Priory in the heart of his Fauconberg lands. As he had no surviving legitimate sons, the earldom became extinct. He was survived by his wife, who died in 1490 at the age of 84 (thus living through the reigns of all the English kings of the fifteenth century). He had three daughters and one son from his marriage, and one acknowledged illegitimate son, Thomas Neville. Known as the Bastard of Fauconberg, he was to align himself with Warwick and lead a revolt later in Edward IV's reign. William Neville is an underrated figure in the rise to power of the Yorkist regime. More successful as a military leader than the more famous Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick, his reputation is summed up in Goodman's words: \\"No other veteran of the Anglo-French Wars won such distinction in the Wars of the Roses\\".

Studying the sociology of art throughout history is the study of the social history of art, how various societies contributed to the appearance of certain artists. Key scholars in the sociology of art include Howard S. Becker, Arnold Hauser, and Harrison White.  Approaches  In her 1970 book Meaning and Expression: Toward a Sociology of Art, Hanna Deinhard gives one approach: > \\"The point of departure of the sociology of art is the question: How is it > possible that works of art, which always originate as products of human > activity within a particular time and society and for a particular time, > society, or function -- even though they are not necessarily produced as > 'works of art' -- can live beyond their time and seem expressive and > meaningful in completely different epochs and societies? On the other hand, > how can the age and society that produced them be recognized in the works\\"? Other approaches consider the social and economic background to the creation of works of art, which has been a great focus of art history in recent decades. The role of patrons and consumers of art, as well as those of the artist(s) themselves, are considered. There has also been a great interest in the history of art collecting, and the history of older objects between their creation and their current location, beyond a mere provenance.

It was started in 1173 by Henry the Lion as a cathedral for the Bishop of L√ºbeck. It was partly destroyed in a bombing raid in World War II (1942), when the Arp Schnitger organ was destroyed by fire, but was subsequently reconstructed. It is also famous for works of Bernt Notke and Thomas Quellinus, which survived the bombing raid in 1942. The famous altar by Hans Memling is now in L√ºbeck's St. Annen Museum. The current church was finished in 1982. In 1873 the Cathedral celebrated its 700th anniversary, when an offshoot of the Lutheran Memorial Beech Tree, in Steinbach near Bad Liebenstein in Thuringia, was planted in the churchyard. Construction  In 1173 Henry the Lion founded the cathedral to serve the Diocese of L√ºbeck, after the transfer in 1160 of the bishop's seat from Oldenburg in Holstein under bishop Gerold. The then Romanesque cathedral was completed around 1230, but between 1266 and 1335 it was converted into a Gothic-style building with side-aisles raised to the same height as the main aisle (around 20m). On the night of Palm Sunday (28‚Äì29 March) 1942 a Royal Air Force bombing raid destroyed a fifth of the town centre. Several bombs fell in the area around the church, causing the eastern vault of the quire to collapse and destroying the altar which dated from 1696. A fire from the neighbouring cathedral museum spread to the truss of the cathedral, and around noon on Palm Sunday the towers collapsed. An Arp Schnitger organ was lost in the flames. Nevertheless, a relatively large portion of the internal fittings was saved, including the cross and almost all of the medieval polyptychs. In 1946 a further collapse, of the gable of the north transept, destroyed the vestibule almost completely. Reconstruction Reconstruction of the cathedral took several decades, as greater priority was given to the rebuilding of the Marienkirche. Work was completed only in 1982. In 2002 a symposium took place in conjunction with the L√ºbeck Academy of Music to consider the reconstruction of the Arp Schnitger organ. It was concluded that such a reconstruction would be possible, but no decision has yet been taken. The discussion follows a research project at the university in G√∂teborg, Sweden where a reconstruction of the L√ºbeck organ has been going on since the mid-1990s. That reconstruction was concluded in 2001 with installation of the replica, including a replica of the organ front, in an earlier abandoned church from the late 1890s, √ñrgryte church. The church is now rebuilt as a concert hall. The cathedral is unique in that at 105 m, it is shorter than the tallest church in the city. This is the consequence of a power struggle between the church and the guilds. Fixtures The 17 m crucifix is the work of the L√ºbeck artist Bernt Notke. It was commissioned by the bishop of L√ºbeck, Albert II. Krummendiek, and erected in 1477. The carvings which decorate the rood screen are also by Notke. Since the war, the famous altar of Hans Memling has been in the medieval collection of the St. Annen Museum, but notable polyptychs remain in the cathedral. In the funeral chapels of the southern aisle are Baroque-era memorials by the Flemish sculptor Thomas Quellinus.

Anonymous  Legend  According to legend, in the 8th century Charlemagne was hunting in Saxony and chased a huge deer. After a long pursuit he succeeded in capturing the animal but neither killed nor kept it. Instead he took a gold chain and laid it on the deer's antlers. Four hundred years later the Wends and Saxons had converted to Christianity, and the man now out hunting was Henry the Lion, the founder of L√ºbeck. Henry had separated himself from his followers in order to be alone with his thoughts. He wanted to build a church, but lacked the necessary funds. At that moment a great deer appeared before him with a diamond-encrusted crucifix in its antlers. He took this as a sign from God, and shot the animal. He took the cross from its antlers; hardly had he done so when the deer rose up and disappeared into the bushes. The young duke now had enough money for the construction of the church.  Cathedral and congregation today  The cathedral is now one of the three Lutheran churches of the North Elbian Evangelical Church. Since 2001 the bishop has been B√§rbel Wartenberg-Potter. The congregation is closely connected with the musical life of the city. Thanks to the long-serving organist and cantor Uwe R√∂hl (1925‚Äì2005), the cathedral plays host to the Schleswig-Holstein Musik Festival.

She was launched on 18 May 1939 and commissioned 25 March 1941. On 16 June 1942, Hermione was torpedoed and sunk by the in the Mediterranean. Eighty-seven crewmembers perished. Construction and design The Dido-class were designed as small cruisers capable of being built quickly and in large numbers to allow a shortfall in numbers of cruisers against the numbers which were required to meet the Royal Navy's requirements. Rather than the mixed armament of single purpose 6-inch (152 mm) low-angle (anti -ship) and 4-inch (102 mm) high-angle (anti-aircraft) guns carried by previous light cruisers, it was decided to fit a dual purpose main armament, capable of both anti-ship and anti-aircraft fire. This used the new 5.25-inch (133 mm) gun as used in the King George V-class battleships. Hermione was one of two Dido-class cruisers ordered under the 1937 construction programme for the Royal Navy, following on from 5 ships ordered the previous year. Hermione was laid down at Alexander Stephen and Sons Linthouse, Glasgow shipyard as Yard number 560 on 6 October 1937, was launched on 18 May 1939 and completed on 25 March 1941. Hermione was long overall and between perpendiculars, with a beam of and a mean draught of (increasing to at full load. Displacement was standard and full load. The ship's machinery was arranged in a four-shaft layout, with four Admiralty 3-drum boilers supplying steam at to Parsons single-reduction geared steam turbines, rated at , giving a speed of . of fuel oil were carried, giving a range of at , reducing to at and at . The ship's main armament consisted of ten 5.25-inch guns in five twin turrets on the ship's centreline, with three forward and two aft. Two quadruple 2-pounder (40 mm) pom-pom mounts were mounted on the ship's beams to provide close-in anti-aircraft protection, backed up by two quadruple .50 in (12.7 mm) machine guns on the bridge wings. Two triple 21-inch (533 mm) torpedo tubes provided additional anti-ship capability. Fire control for this armament was provided by a single low angle director control tower (DCT) on the ship's bridge, together with two High Angle Control System (HACS) director towers, one on the ship's bridge and one aft. A armour belt protected the ship's machinery and magazines with protecting the ship's shell rooms. Deck armour was thick, with caps over the magazines. The 5.25 inch gun turrets had armour of thickness. =Modifications= 20 mm Oerlikon gun on board HMS Hermione, showing a naval gunner utilising the rubber shoulder rests for high-angle firing, with the Thornycroft depth charge thrower Mark II and depth charge launching rail in the background. While several of the Dido-class completed with reduced main armaments owing to production problems (the King George V-class battleships had priority for the new guns), Hermione completed with the full ten-gun outfit. In October‚ÄìNovember 1941, the ship's .50 in machine guns were replaced by five single Oerlikon 20 mm cannon. History Convoy, Hermiones ship's cat, sleeps in a hammock whilst members of the crew look on After commissioning and workup, Hermione joined the 15th Cruiser Squadron of the Home Fleet. Hermione took part in the pursuit of the and heavy cruiser when they sortied into the North Atlantic in May 1941. Hermione left Scapa Flow on 22 May as part of a force including the battleship and the aircraft carrier . On 24 May, Victorious, escorted by Hermione, and , was detached to launch an air attack against Bismarck. The attack by Victoriouss Swordfish torpedo bombers resulted in a single torpedo hit on Bismarck which did little damage to the German ship. On 25 May, Hermione, short of fuel, was detached from the chase in order to refuel at Iceland. Following the sinking of Bismarck, the British launched a major operation against German supply ships in the Atlantic which supported the operations of surface raiders, with Hermione taking part in searches for these supply ships and German blockade runners before joining Force H, based at Gibraltar on 22 June.

He was an early settler of San Diego, California. In San Diego, he was the first attorney, created the first survey of pueblo lands in the region, and served as mayor of the city from 1846-1847. Early life Henry Fitch was born in 1799 in Nantucket or New Bedford, Massachusetts. His parents were Beriah Fitch and Sarah Delano. Beriah Fitch was a sea captain. In 1815, Fitch made his first ship journey, visiting ports in South America, buying and selling cargoes for a Danish merchant. Career and family life in California Fitch first came to California while serving as a sea captain, from 1826 until 1830, of the Mar√≠a Ester, a Mexican brig that called ports throughout California. It was during his journey on the Mar√≠a Ester that he met Josefa Carrillo in San Diego. She was fifteen years old. Fitch expressed romantic interest in Carrillo, and during his return visits to San Diego he would court the girl. In 1827, Fitch asked Carrillo's parents for her hand in marriage. On April 14, 1829, he was baptized in San Diego, California under the name Enrique Domingo Fitch. The next day, Fitch was to marry Carrillo. Prior to the wedding, Domingo Carrillo, Carrillo's uncle, stopped the wedding on behalf of then governor Jose Maria Echeandia. Later in her life, Carrillo claimed that the Echeandia intended to stop the wedding because he was in love with her, however, historians believe Echeandia stopped the wedding because of his general dislike of Fitch. Josefa Carrillo Fitch That evening, Carrillo's cousin, Pio Pico brought her to a ship called the Vulture. The ship left for Valparaiso, Chile, where the two eloped on July 3, 1829. The newlyweds returned to San Diego in July 1830, with a newborn son, Enrique Eduardo. The family would sail up the coast to Santa Cruz on a trade mission. Upon stopping in San Pedro, they received a summons from padre Jose Sanchez claiming that the marriage certificate from Chile was invalid. Fitch ignored the summons and was arrested on August 29, 1830. He was held in San Pedro by General Mariano G. Vallejo, who would eventually marry Carrillo's sister, and therefore become Fitch's brother-in-law. On December 28, an ecclesiastical tribunal ruled that the marriage was legal. Return to San Diego For one year, 1830‚Äì31, Fitch was captain of the Leonor which transported Mexican convicts. He became a naturalized Mexican citizen in 1833. In Old Town, San Diego, Fitch operated a general store starting in 1833. At his store, he traded tallow, furs, and hides, outfitted hunters, and went on trading voyages on the coast. In 1835, Fitch became San Diego's first city attorney. Fitch was not fluent in Spanish, therefore he struggled to succeed at the job. He was released from the position in 1836 and in 1837 he was asked to serve as police commissioner. In January 1840, he served as justice of the peace. In 1846, he became alcade of San Diego. Within a year he quit. Historical records note that he did not enjoy public service and repeatedly requested to be relieved of his duties based on language barriers. During his time in public service, his general store and trade business continued to thrive. He struggled to get repaid by debtors, the most notable debtor being John Sutter. Ten years later, in 1845, he made the first land survey and map of the pueblo land surrounding San Diego. Land acquisitions and later career Fitch became disenfranchised with the trade business, including challenging business relations. He expressed interest in new land settlement opportunities north of San Francisco. In 1841, he was given a 48,000 acre land grant at Rancho Sotoyome in Healdsburg, California in Sonoma County. Fitch never actively settled or developed the land in Healdsburg, choosing to continue to work in the trade industry up and down the coast. After gold was found in Northern California, Fitch started planning to relocate the family to Rancho Sotoyome in March 1849. However, Fitch would die before he relocated. Later life Fitch died of pneumonia in San Diego in 1849. His body was buried at Presidio of San Diego. His body was the last buried at the site. After his death, his family relocated to Healdsburg. Legacy Fitch Mountain in Healdsburg is named after Fitch. See also * History of marriage in California Further reading * Miller, Ronald L.

Army of Jaswant Singh and combined army of both the princes met at Dharmatpur, fifteen miles from Ujjain. The battle was fought on 15 April 1658. Jaswant Singhs advisers suggested a night raid to destroy Aurangzebs artillery and gunpowder as the Rajput army was almost entirely made up of light cavalry, while Aurangzeb had a well equipped army of heavy cavalry, Artillery and Muskets.

Batman Total Justice is a line of toys produced by Kenner based on Batman and other, connected, DC Comics characters. History In 1996, Kenner started production on a new line of DC Comics character figures. This line, like Legends of Batman and Legends of the Dark Knight, featured all new sculpts of popular DC Comics characters. To appeal to buyers, Kenner produced the line under the high selling Batman title, calling the line Batman: Total Justice. This line featured Batman, Robin and The Huntress, but also included other DC Comics characters including Superman, Green Lantern, The Flash and others. This was the first line of DC Comics character figures released by Kenner since the Super Powers Collection line of figures ended ten years earlier. Kenner stopped production after only fourteen figures were released. A fourth wave of figures was planned to include Blue Beetle, Dr. Polaris, Fractal Armor Green Lantern and Fractal Armor The Flash.http://www.actionfigureinsider.com/archives/tj/tjw4.html Also, it has been speculated that the fifth assortment - which likely got no further than the earliest of planning stages - was to include Martian Manhunter, Supergirl, a Fractal Armor Robin, and Prometheus as its villain. Two years later, the Hasbro toy company produced the same figures included in the Total Justice line, but this time released them under the name JLA (a tie-in with the popular comic title).http://www.actionfigureinsider.com/archives/tj/jla.html Several of the unproduced Total Justice figures were produced under the JLA name, but no new Batman related characters were included. Each figure in the JLA line included a stand with the JLA logo and a mini comic. Starting with Series 3, the line started to include characters from the Young Justice comic book. Storyline from the packages On a distant planet, an evil being known as Darkseid prepares for his invasion and destruction of Earth. Batman learns of this diabolical plan and recruits the world's mightiest super heroes in an all-out assault on Darkseid's forces. Other media In 1996, DC Comics produced a three-issue tie-in mini-series featuring the heroes from the first wave (Batman, Robin, Aquaman, Flash and Green Lantern) plus Blue Beetle, Gypsy, Darkseid, and a Parademon (\\"Mike\\", who might be the same Parademon from Villains United). A two-book set of children's books was made based on the series.

Five of these candidates were elected to the House of Representatives and one was elected to the Senate. The term Fighting Dem can be applied to all non-incumbent military veterans running for Congress in 2006 as Democrats. Other generic names have been used. Mother Jones refers to the group as \\"The Capitol Brigade\\". The Draft Zinni campaign describes them as the \\"Security Dems\\" and part of the \\"Blue Force\\". Veterans for a Secure America On December 20, 2005, a group of Fighting Dems met in Washington, D.C. for a strategy session and voted on a name for their coalition: Veterans for a Secure America. On February 8, 2006, nearly 40 of them met again in Washington to gather outside of the U.S. Capitol. The event was led by former Senator Max Cleland of Georgia, a Vietnam veteran who with the rest of the veterans chartered the Veterans for a Secure America (VSA). To date the VSA is the only organized group of Fighting Dems though not all Fighting Dems are part of the VSA. Philosophy On October 1, 2006, retired Army Major and congressional candidate Tammy Duckworth made the weekly Democratic radio address blasting George W. Bush saying \\"Instead of a plan or a strategy, we get shallow slogans like 'mission accomplished' and 'stay the course,'\\" but \\"Those slogans are calculated to win an election. But they won't help us accomplish our mission in Iraq\\" She explained that the United States needs \\"a Congress that will ask the tough questions and work together for solutions rather than attacking the patriotism of those who disagree\\". Further she said, \\"It is time to encourage Iraqi leaders to take control of their own country and make the tough choices that will stop the civil war and stabilize the country.\\" List of Fighting Dems =House races= Candidates, followed by state abbreviation and district number * Woodrow Anderson III, AR-03.

It is a sequel to Irem's 1984 coin-operated video game Spartan X (released internationally by Data East under the title of Kung-Fu Master), which was later ported to the Family Computer by Nintendo in 1985. In turn, Spartan X was originally a tie-in to the 1984 Jackie Chan film Wheels on Meals (released as Spartan X in Japan). Spartan X 2 did not receive a North American release until 2016, when it was included as a built-in title for the Retro-Bit Generations retro video game console under the name Kung-Fu Master 2. Plot Translated from the game's manual The city has been corrupted by drugs for some time. Johnny Thomas, a man who lost his mother and sister as a result of his father being used as an experiment for a new kind of drug, is the only man who opposes the drug syndicates. After the incident, Thomas left the corrupted police department he was working for and became a private secret agent in order to investigate the illegal trafficking routes in his city. During his investigation, he learns that an international criminal organization known as \\"Hawk\\" is responsible for the majority of the drugs that has sneaked into the country. Gameplay The player takes control of Johnny Thomas, an undercover investigator tasked with fighting a drug syndicate. There are a total of six stages in the game, each with its own boss. Whereas the original game was set entirely in a five-story pagoda, the stages of Spartan X 2 consist of different locations which includes a train, a warehouse, a boat, an airplane, a mansion, and a drug plant. When the player clears a stage, only a certain portion of the player's vitality will be restored. However, the player can also restore their vitality during the course of each stage by picking up the Stamina X potions left behind by certain enemies. In addition to all of Thomas' moves from the original game, the player can also perform two new moves while crouching for an extended period: an uppercut and an over-the-shoulder throw.

Publication history Pantha first appeared in New Titans #73 (February 1991) and was created by Marv Wolfman and Tom Grummett. Fictional character biography Pantha was a cat-like member of one of the incarnations of the Teen Titans. During her time with the Titans, she had no knowledge as to her origins, whether she was a woman or a female panther before the Wildebeest Society mutated her. But tragically, her ultimately fruitless search led her to many dead-ends. The significance of her designation as \\"X-24\\" was also never revealed. While many of the other Titans were close friends, Pantha went out of her way to alienate herself from the team. Pantha was overtly hostile towards her teammates, often ridiculing and berating them. Despite her attitude, her feral abilities made her a valuable asset to the team. To her initial frustration, Pantha was \\"adopted\\" as a surrogate mother by Baby Wildebeest. She did not like this at first, often making references to grisly ways the child could perish. She does work with him when need be, such as when the Titans helped in a counter-attack on murderous aliens in the Bloodlines crossover.Bloodbath #1-2 (December 1993) She eventually takes responsibility for his care when she left the Titans with Red Star, forming a family.New Titans #114 (1994) Pantha and her teammates were almost stars of a children's cartoon series but the deal fell apart.Teen Titans Sell Out One-Shot (November 1992) She is part of a multi-hero effort to investigate and destroy alien parasites murdering people all across the planet. Later, she teams up with her old allies when Cyborg, now with an entirely new level of power, threatens the entire Earth. The Justice League of America showed up also and a series of mistakes led to the entire team fighting. Pantha took on Catwoman but neither side won as they were interrupted by blasts from Orion. Baby Wildebeest himself was subdued by Superman.JLA Vs. Titans #2 (1999) During the Infinite Crisis storyline, she joins with another team of Titans, along with a new Doom Patrol and Justice Society of America. Their mission is to stop the deranged Superboy-Prime who has attacked this reality's version of Superboy. The battle originates at the town of Smallville, Kansas and moves to the outskirts of Keystone City. There, Pantha is killed with a backhand blow by Superboy-Prime that is so powerful that it knocks Ambush Bug unconscious.Ambush Bug: Year None #3 of 6 (November 2008) Superboy-Prime instantly claims he didn't mean to do it, but in the next few moments, he kills Baby Wildebeest and attacks Red Star with freezing breath. Red Star survives his injuries.Teen Titans #32 (March 2006)Infinite Crisis #4 (March 2006) In Blackest Night: Titans crossover, Pantha was reanimated as a member of the Black Lanterns, ready to attack the Titans. However, her body is soon destroyed by a burst of white light emanating from Dawn Granger.Blackest Night: Titans #3 (December 2009) Powers and abilities Pantha's human/panther physiology gave her superhuman strength, speed, and agility, as well as heightened senses (such as hearing, smelling, and night-vision), enhanced reflexes, and retractable claws on her hands and feet. Other versions =Maxwell Lord's Domination= In an alternate timeline created by Booster Gold when he saved Blue Beetle from Maxwell Lord, Pantha, who is still alive in this timeline, is a member of Green Arrow and Hawkman's Freedom Fighters. In this timeline, Lord had used his resources to conquer most of Earth. While Superboy Prime does eventually visit, Pantha is not there to face him and thus die. It was revealed that Pantha was a vet student at New York University named Rosabelle Mendez who was captured by Maxwell Lord and made into Pantha, then sold to the Wildebeest Society. This timeline is neutralized when Blue Beetle willingly returns to the past to face his fate.Booster Gold vol. 2 #7-9 (2008) In other media =Television= * Pantha debuts in the Teen Titans episode \\"Calling All Titans\\" voiced by Diane Delano. This version is a professional wrestler, given the visage of a popular female luchador. It is mentioned that she was a friend of Wildebeest (a nod to their comic selves in which Pantha is Baby Wildebeest's \\"mother\\"). Cyborg met her at a wrestling ring and made her an Honorary Titan. She was then attacked by Adonis and Atlas whom were sent by the Brotherhood of Evil, but defeats them both. Pantha joined the team of Beast Boy, M√°s, Herald and Jericho to launch an assault on the Brotherhood of Evil's main headquarters, and then took part in the final battle against the various supervillains assembled by the Brotherhood of Evil; in said battle, she defeats a rival Mexican super-powered wrestler in league with the Brotherhood and claims his mask as per the code of Lucha Libre. This incarnation of Pantha has superhuman strength and can execute a one-handed face-grasping submission hold known as \\"The Pantha's Claw\\". =Miscellaneous= * Pantha appeared in issue #32 of Teen Titans Go!.

Lyrically, the song was inspired by a trip that lead vocalist Bono made to Nicaragua and El Salvador, where he saw firsthand how local peasants were affected by United States military intervention in the region. Angered by what he witnessed, Bono asked guitarist the Edge to \\"put El Salvador through an amplifier.\\" \\"Bullet the Blue Sky\\" is one of the band's most overtly political songs, with live performances often being heavily critical of political conflicts and violence. Writing and recording \\"Bullet the Blue Sky\\" first originated as a demo that U2 recorded during a jam session at STS Studios in Dublin with producer Paul Barrett, prior to the proper Joshua Tree recording sessions.McCormick (2006), p. 172 While listening to a song by English rock band the Fall, U2 guitarist the Edge tried to emulate its guitar riff, but instead came up with his own part that was \\"uptempo, like real hard-hitting\\". (It eventually became the chorus for \\"Bullet the Blue Sky\\".) Bassist Adam Clayton and drummer Larry Mullen Jr. then joined in playing at half-time. Lead vocalist Bono recalled that Clayton was also playing in a different key from the Edge. The guitarist became irritated, as the rhythm section was playing much differently than how he thought they should. He thought, \\"What the fuck are they doing?\\", and considered stopping the jam. After the take was completed, the band listened to playback in the control room and realised that the demo was \\"absolutely brilliant\\". Compared to the final version of the song, the Edge described the demo as a \\"much more bare-boned, like a heavy funk track\\".McCormick (2006), pp. 178‚Äì179 Still, the song was discarded for some time until producer Brian Eno, who described it as a \\"homeless riff\\", convinced the band it was worth working on. In July 1986,McGee (2008), p. 97 Bono and his wife Ali travelled to Nicaragua and El Salvador, where they saw firsthand the distress of peasants bullied by political conflicts and United States military intervention. The trip angered Bono and formed the basis of the song's lyrics. He said, \\"I remember the ground shaking, and I remember the smell, I suppose, of being near a war zone. I don't think we were in danger, but I knew there were lives in danger or being lost close to us, and I felt for them. It upset me as a person who read the Scriptures, to think that Christians in America were supporting this kind of thing, this kind of proxy war because of these Communists.\\" In August, after reconvening with his bandmates in Dublin to resume work on The Joshua Tree,McGee (2008), p. 98 Bono instructed the Edge to \\"put El Salvador through an amplifier\\", resulting in the song's feedback-based guitar part.Jobling (2014), pp. 158‚Äì159 The Edge said that his guitar playing was also informed by Bono's lyrics. Producer Daniel Lanois says that the most progress on \\"Bullet the Blue Sky\\" was made at Melbeach, the Edge's newly purchased home in seaside Monkstown. According to Lanois, the song's performance came from a 20-minute jam that he dedicated an extensive amount of time to editing into a final arrangement, \\"for a song that was never a song, that was only ever a jam.\\" He said, \\"It was one of those songs that was born partially by surgery ‚Äì the editing of the structure was a really big part of it.\\" Recording engineer Dave Meegan helped develop the song with a mix that he made at Melbeach. Wanting it to sound like Led Zeppelin, Meegan adjusted a monitor mix to make it \\"really heavy sounding.\\" Lanois was inspired by what he heard, as the song up to that point was being treated softly. He quickly summoned the band, who went with the primary engineer Flood to Windmill Lane Studios. There, in a warehouse next door, the crew used a public address system to play an acoustic recording of Mullen's drums, which was then re-recorded inside the warehouse.Lanois (2010) Lanois called it a \\"really elaborate kind of rock and roll chamber\\". The result, according to Meegan, \\"made [the drums] sound like John Bonham\\", while Lanois said they sounded \\"tankier\\". He added, \\"it introduced a mid-range that the high-hat seemed to like. This new sonic emphasis on the high-hat made every hit more relevant... The inherent low-frequency punch of the PA also added a level of excitement to the bass drum. The overall sensation was a chestier one.\\" The final mix of \\"Bullet the Blue Sky\\" was based on two different versions. Producer Steve Lillywhite, who in December 1986 was hired by U2 to help mix some of The Joshua Tree,McCormick (2006), pp. 184‚Äì185 was asked by the Edge \\"to fly over from one version to another version\\". Without access to modern day samplers at the time, Lillywhite had to match the tempos of the two tape recordings by hand and then, as they played, transfer the requested sections of each onto a half-inch tape recorder. He said it \\"was never all played at the same time; it was a real mish-mash of two things.\\" Lanois said Lillywhite's final mix was much different from his and Eno's version, leaning more heavily on effects and overdubs: \\"I wouldn't have had as many effects on it, because we had a bit of a purist attitude toward some of these recordings, essentially that there was a sound that was captured in performance in a room, and we wanted to remain loyal to that space, to convey that sound. And he was not as sentimental to that idea, so he pulled out all the stops.\\" During a spoken word passage of the song, Bono speaks of being approached by a man, \\"his face red like a rose on a thorn bush, like all the colors of a royal flush, and he's peeling off those dollar bills, slapping them down, 100, 200\\". Bono said the person he had in mind while writing the lyrics was then US President Ronald Reagan, whose administration backed the military regimes in Central and South America that Bono encountered on his earlier trip. The lyrics were partially inspired by Bono seeing a mural in El Salvador of Reagan in a chariot depicted as the Pharaoh, with Salvadorans as \\"the children of Israel running away\\". Live performances A performance of the song on the Vertigo Tour, when the band re-interpreted it as a commentary on religious violence. \\"Bullet the Blue Sky\\" was played at nearly every live concert from its first performance at the opening night of the Joshua Tree Tour on 2 April 1987 through the Vertigo Tour. Its live performances have traditionally been paired with \\"Running to Stand Still\\"; this took place on the Joshua Tree Tour, Lovetown Tour, Zoo TV Tour, and the first 46 concerts of the Vertigo Tour. On the PopMart Tour, \\"Bullet\\" instead led into \\"Please\\"; Elevation Tour performances were followed by \\"With or Without You\\" or a cover of \\"What's Going On\\" by Marvin Gaye, on the Vertigo Tour, \\"Miss Sarajevo\\" replaced \\"Running to Stand Still\\" for the last 85 concerts. and on the Innocence + Experience Tour, it segued into \\"Pride (In the Name of Love)\\" on the first leg and an abbreviated version of \\"Zooropa\\" starting on the second leg. During the Joshua Tree Tour, Bono would frequently grab a large spotlight and shine into peoples' faces in the audience, and would also make numerous political references to figures such as Ronald Reagan and Jerry Falwell. He also used the spotlight on the Elevation Tour. On the Innocence + Experience Tour, Bono would typically sing the majority of the song into a megaphone. U2's following album, Rattle and Hum, featured a live performance of this song, with a pre-recorded intro of Jimi Hendrix's version of \\"The Star- Spangled Banner\\". \\"Bullet\\" then took on new meanings throughout the subsequent years. On the Zoo TV Tour, it was about Nazism; on the PopMart Tour, it, at least on occasion, featured references to consumerism and rock iconography in keeping in with the tour's theme. On the Elevation Tour, it became an indictment against handgun violence, illustrated by references to John Lennon's assassination and an ironic intro video clip featuring Charlton Heston, who was at that time the president of the National Rifle Association, while on the Vertigo Tour, it was about religious violence and the final lyrics were replaced by a snippet of \\"The Hands That Built America\\". On the Innocence + Experience Tour, the song was about corruption of money, which was emphasized with images of Wall Street and Las Vegas on the video screen, as well as Bono discussing a scenario where he meets a teenage version of himself who criticizes the wealthy man he has become. The Edge uses his black Fender Stratocaster to play this song, except during the PopMart Tour, when he used a Gibson Les Paul. Live performances of the song appear on the concert films Zoo TV: Live from Sydney, PopMart: Live from Mexico City, Elevation 2001: Live from Boston, U2 Go Home: Live from Slane Castle, Ireland, Vertigo 2005: Live from Chicago, Live from Paris and Innocence + Experience: Live in Paris. Reception and cover versions In 2004, Mojo placed the song at number 17 on its list of the \\"100 Epic Rock Tracks\\". The September 2018 issue of Q included the song on a list of the \\"50 Greatest Revolutionary Songs\\"; writer Niall Doherty said, \\"It's no little irony that it became the most powerful song on the album that made U2 stars in America, Bono serving up this tale of the horrors of US foreign policy to packed stadiums, night after night.\\" The U2 Podcast Editions in iTunes mentions that this is Paul McGuinness' (former U2 manager) favorite song. The song is covered by Sepultura in their covers EP Revolusongs, by P.O.D. in their album The Fundamental Elements of Southtown and Queensr√øche in their album Take Cover.

He also worked with collage, illustration and textiles. Early life Nicolas de Sta√´l was born –ù–∏–∫–æ–ª–∞–π –í–ª–∞–¥–∏–º–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∏—á –®—Ç–∞–ª—å —Ñ–æ–Ω –ì–æ–ª—å—à—Ç–µ–π–Ω (Nikolai Vladimirovich Stael von Holstein) in Saint Petersburg, into the family of a Russian Lieutenant General, Baron Vladimir Stael von Holstein, (a member of the Sta√´l von Holstein family, and the last Commandant of the Peter and Paul Fortress) and his second wife, Lubov Vladimirovna Berednikova (his first wife was Olga Sakhanskaya). De Sta√´l's family was forced to emigrate to Poland in 1919 because of the Russian Revolution; both his father and stepmother died in Poland and the orphaned Nicolas de Sta√´l was sent with his older sister Marina to Brussels to live with a Russian family (1922). Career beginnings He eventually studied art at the Brussels Acad√©mie Royale des Beaux-Arts (1932). In the 1930s, he travelled throughout Europe, lived in Paris (1934) and in Morocco (1936) (where he first met his companion Jeannine Guillou, also a painter and who would appear in some of his paintings from 1941‚Äì1942) and Algeria. In 1936 he had his first exhibition of Byzantine style icons and watercolors at the Galerie Dietrich et Cie, Brussels.Chronology: Exhibition Catalogue, Nicolas de Sta√´l, paintings 1950‚Äì1955, Mitchell-Innes & Nash, NYC. 1997 p.96 He joined the French Foreign Legion in 1939 and was demobilized in 1941. Sometime in 1940 he met one of his future dealers Jeanne Bucher. During the War In 1941, he moved to Nice where he met Jean Arp, Sonia Delaunay and Robert Delaunay, and these artists would inspire his first abstract paintings, or \\"Compositions\\". In 1942, Jeannine and Nicolas de Sta√´l's daughter Anne was born. The growing family also included Jeannine's nine-year-old son Antoine. In 1943 (during the Nazi occupation), de Sta√´l returned to Paris with Jeannine, but the war years were extremely difficult. During the war his paintings were included in several group exhibitions and in 1944 he had his first one-man exhibition at the Galerie l'Esquisse. In April 1945, he had a one-man exhibition at the Galerie Jeanne Bucher and in May 1945 his paintings were included in the first Salon de Mai. De Sta√´l's work was also included in the Salon d'Automne that year.Douglas Cooper, Nicolas de Sta√´l, Masters and Movements, Weidenfeld and Nicolson Ltd. London, 1961, p. 21 In Paris in 1944, he met and befriended Georges Braque, and by 1945 his exhibitions brought him critical fame. However times were difficult, and successes came too late, since Jeannine died in February 1946 from illness brought on by malnutrition.Douglas Cooper, Nicolas de Sta√´l, Masters and Movements, Weidenfeld and Nicolson Ltd. London, 1961, pp. 23‚Äì24 Career success De Sta√´l met Fran√ßoise Chapouton in the spring of 1946, and they married in May. In October 1946 thanks to his friendship with artist Andr√© Lanskoy (whom he met in 1944) de Sta√´l made a contract with Louis Carr√© who agreed to buy all the paintings that he produced. By January 1947 the de Sta√´l family moved into larger quarters thanks to increased recognition and increased sales. In 1947 he befriended his neighbor American private art dealer Theodore Schempp. De Sta√´l's new studio in Paris was very close to Georges Braque's and the two painters became very close friends. In April 1947 his second daughter Laurence was born.Chronology: Exhibition Catalogue, Nicolas de Sta√´l, paintings 1950‚Äì1955, Mitchell-Innes & Nash, NYC. 1997 pp.96‚Äì97 In April 1948 his son Jerome was born,Chronology: Exhibition Catalogue, Nicolas de Sta√´l, paintings 1950‚Äì1955, Mitchell-Innes & Nash, NYC. 1997 p.98 also that same year in Paris he began a long friendship with German artist Johnny Friedlaender. His paintings began to attract attention worldwide. In 1950 he had a one-man exhibition at the Galerie Jacques Dubourg in ParisEliza Rathbone, Introduction: Nicolas de Sta√´l, 1914‚Äì1955, Exhibition Catalogue, Mitchell-Innes & Nash, NYC. 1997 p.6 and Schempp introduced de Sta√´l's paintings to New York, with a private exhibition at his Upper East Side apartment. He sold several paintings to important collectors including Duncan Phillips of the Phillips Collection. He had considerable success in the United States, and England in the early 1950s. In 1950 Leo Castelli organized a group exhibition at the Sidney Janis Gallery in New York City that included himChronology: Exhibition Catalogue, Nicolas de Sta√´l, paintings 1950‚Äì1955, Mitchell-Innes & Nash, NYC. 1997 pp.96‚Äì97 In April 1948 his son Jerome was born,Young U.S. and French Painters. In 1952, he had one-man exhibitions in London, Montevideo, and in Paris.Chronology: Exhibition Catalogue, Nicolas de Sta√´l, paintings 1950‚Äì1955, Mitchell-Innes & Nash, NYC. 1997 p.97‚Äì98 In March 1953, he had his first official one-man exhibition at M. Knoedler & Co. in New York City. The show was both a commercial and critical success. In 1953 he had an exhibition at the Phillips Gallery in Washington DC, (known today as The Phillips Collection in Washington DC) and they acquired two more of his canvasses. Visiting the United States in 1953 de Sta√´l and Francoise visited MoMA, the Barnes Foundation in Merion, Pennsylvania and various other important institutions. After returning to Paris, de Sta√´l met visiting New York art dealer Paul Rosenberg who offered de Sta√´l an exclusive contract. De Sta√´l signed with Paul Rosenberg partially because Rosenberg was French and because he was an important New York art dealer who showed many Cubist painters whom Nicolas de Sta√´l admired. By the end of 1953 the demand for de Sta√´l's paintings was so great that Paul Rosenberg raised his prices and continually requested more paintings. The demand was so high for his planned spring 1954 exhibition, that Rosenberg requested an additional fifteen paintings. Once again this exhibition was both commercially and critically successful. In April 1954 de Sta√´l's fourth child Gustave was born. In that spring he had a successful exhibition in Paris at Jacques Dubourg's gallery. His new paintings marked his departure from abstraction and a return to figuration, still-life and landscape. In the fall of 1954, he moved with his family to Antibes. Early death By 1953, de Sta√´l's state led him to seek isolation in the south of France (eventually in Antibes). He suffered from exhaustion, insomnia and depression. In the wake of a disappointing meeting with a disparaging art critic on March 16, 1955 he committed suicide. He leapt to his death from his eleventh story studio terrace, in Antibes. He was 41 years old.Douglas Cooper, Nicolas de Sta√´l, Masters and Movements, Weidenfeld and Nicolson Ltd. London, 1961, p.6Chronology: Exhibition Catalogue, Nicolas de Sta√´l, paintings 1950‚Äì1955, Mitchell-Innes & Nash, NYC. 1997 p.99 Nicolas de Sta√´l is buried at the Montrouge Cemetery. Legacy De Sta√´l's painting career spans roughly 15 years (from 1940) and produced more than a thousand paintings. His work shows the influence of Gustave Courbet, Paul C√©zanne, Henri Matisse, Pablo Picasso (especially Picasso in his Blue and Rose periods), Georges Braque, Fernand L√©ger and Chaim Soutine, as well as of the Dutch masters Rembrandt, Vermeer and Hercules Seghers. During the 1940s and beginning in representation (especially landscapes, but also still lifes, and portraits), de Sta√´l moved further and further toward abstraction. Evolving his own highly distinctive and abstract style, which bears comparison with the near-contemporary American Abstract Expressionist movement, and French Tachisme, but which he developed independently of them. Typically his paintings contained block-like slabs of colour, emerging as if struggling against one another across the surface of the image. Accordingly, when a Rothko painting was paired with one by Nicolas de Sta√´l in the show of young French and American painters, Rothko commented to William Seitz (in 1952): \\"Blobs vs. blocks. They both begin with ‚Äòb.‚Äò Comparisons are false!\\"\\".James E.B. Breslin, Mark Rothko. A Biography. Chicago, 1993: p. 621 In fact, according to de Sta√´l himself, he turned to his \\"abstracting\\" because he \\"found it awkward to paint an object as a likeness because of the awkwardness I felt when faced[!] with the infinite multitude of coexisting objects in any single object\\".Dario Gamboni, Potential Images. Ambiguity and Indeterminacy in Modern Art. 2002, New Haven, p.19 De Sta√´l's work was quickly recognized within the post-war art world, and he became one of the most influential artists of the 1950s. However, he moved away from abstraction in his later paintings, seeking a more \\"French\\" lyrical style, returning to representation (seascapes, footballers, jazz musicians, seagulls) at the end of his life. His return to imagery during the early 1950s can be seen as an influential precedent for the American Bay Area Figurative Movement, as many of those abstract painters made a similar move; returning to imagery during the mid-1950s. His painting style is characterized by a thick impasto showing traces of the brush and the palette knife, and by a division of the canvas into numerous zones of color (especially blues, reds and whites). His most well-known late paintings of beaches and landscapes are dominated by the sky and effects of light.Landscape Study, Tate Much of de Sta√´l's late work‚Äîin particular his thinned and diluted oil on canvas abstract landscapes of the mid-1950s‚Äîpredicts Color field painting and Lyrical Abstraction of the 1960s and 1970s. Nicolas de Sta√´l's bold and intensely vivid color in his last paintings predict the direction of much of contemporary painting that came after him including Pop Art of the 1960s. The French New Wave filmmaker Jean- Luc Godard has stated that de Sta√´l is his favorite painter, and the use of primary colors in his film Pierrot Le Fou was strongly influenced by de Sta√´l's work.

For passengers & cargo, or cargo only. A Japanese utility cart, known as Rearcar (:ja:„É™„É§„Ç´„Éº). It can be pulled by either human or bicycle. A bicycle trailer is a motorless wheeled frame with a hitch system for transporting cargo by bicycle. It can greatly increase a bike's cargo capacity, allowing point-to-point haulage of objects up to 4 cubic yards (3 cubic metres) in volume that weigh as much as half a ton. Types Different types of trailer are designed for various purposes, cargo requirements and riding conditions: =By number of wheels= * Single-wheel: a single rear-mounted wheel. Though of limited towing capacity, this design tends to be more stable (when moving) than trailers with two or more wheels. The single wheel can tilt from side to side when cornering (as the bicycle itself does,) allowing for coordinated turns at relatively high speed. The connection to the bicycle is simpler than a two-wheeled trailer since only two degrees of freedom are required- the trailer tilts with the towing bicycle. * Two-wheel: A two-wheel design makes possible much greater load carrying capacity and a wider cargo bed. Though not suitable for high speed, they are ideal for everyday cycling (very much like towing a trailer behind a car). Two-wheel trailers tend to be as wide or wider than the handlebars of the bicycle, therefore care needs to be taken when riding through narrow spaces. =By intended cargo= * General cargo: for transporting cargo of all kinds. The load capacity of commercially available cargo trailers ranges from 30 to 300 pounds (14 to 140 kg), but much larger loads have been transported by custom-built trailers or by multi-trailer \\"trains\\" attached to a single bicycle. * Human passenger (as cargo): constructed to enhance the comfort and safety of one or more human passengers. These usually have a low centre of gravity and widely spaced wheels to increase stability when cornering, and often have integrated rain-proof covers, seat padding, and safety belts. A lot of the trailers designed for transporting children can also be converted to strollers. Trailers have also been used as pedicabs. * Child passenger (as rider): trailer bikes and pedal trailer, one-wheel trailers (tandem trailers) with integrated seat, handle bars, and drive train, that normally attaches to the bike via the seat post (and operate very much like a tandem). These allow small children who can't yet ride a bicycle alone to accompany adult riders as participants and motive- power producers. These trailers are by far the most popular style. * Canoe and kayak: designed for towing long, thin, relatively light-weight loads such as canoes, kayaks, or wind surfing rigs. * Disabled passenger: made for safely towing wheelchairs with persons in them. * Pets: for carrying small domestic animals, especially dogs, that weigh less than 100 lb (45 kg). =Electric trailers= * Electric bike trailers are trailer with electric propulsion. Most are electric pusher trailers. They are made by various manufacturers. Examples are Aevon Trailers (Cycloboost), Ridekick International (Ridekick),Electric bike trailersRidekick Topeak (Journey Trailer), ... Components = Frame = * Metal: usually steel or aluminum alloy tubing, assembled by brazing, welding, or nuts and bolts. * Wood (or bamboo): seldom seen but sometimes used in makeshift and home-built trailers, fastened with glue, nails, screws, bolts, or a combination thereof. = Axle = Most trailers have a separate axle for each wheel, like those used on a bicycle. These separate axles usually mount directly on the frame using either threaded nuts, a quick-release mechanism, or some press fit arrangement. The use of separate axles for two-wheel trailers allows the load carrying area to be between the wheels with its base below the axles, so as to keep the centre of gravity relatively low. Some trailers support a normal axle on two sides, others mount the wheel off one side with a stub axle (a one sided axle). = Wheel = * Traditional spoked bicycle wheel in various sizes. Has the advantage of being light, strong, readily available. Pneumatic tires provide some suspension for the load, larger diameters ride smoothly and have much less drag than many other types of wheels. * Solid metal wheels with solid treads, such as dolly wheels. Extremely durable but rough riding and usually slow due to small diameter. = Fender/mud guard = If included, the fender (or just a mud flap) helps to protect the cargo and the towing bicycle from road spray and dirt. On heavy-duty trailers, the fender may be designed to be capable of bearing heavy loads. = Hitch = There are various types, from home made to those supplied by the trailer manufacturers. Hitch positions: * Seatpost: Temporary or permanent clamp assembly attaching the trailer hitch to the seat post. * Rear axle: Special attachment points, integral to the rear quick release skewer or bolted onto solid axles, hold dropouts cut into the trailer hitch. * Chainstay: Two-piece sandwiching clamp screws tight over left rear triangle, with protruding socket-and-pin receiver. * Rear cargo or pannier rack: Some improvised hitches attach to the rear cargo rack or pannier frame. Since rear racks are not structural parts of the bicycle they cannot handle much weight or torque loading. * Improvised: Ropes, bungee cord, chain, cable, etc. Usually not dependable, often dangerous to rider and cargo. Bike Trailer for Toddlers and Small Children Single-wheel trailers generally use a special frame hitch which attaches to both sides of the rear axle, and which incorporates a vertical hinge to allow cornering. Attaching the trailer at the seat-post can (dependent on the design) place the load at a lower point relative to the longitudinal pivot axis of the attached trailer. This can make it possible to wheel a loaded single-wheel trailer around while disconnected from the bike, as the seat-post hitch is a natural height for grasping while walking upright. Hitches for two-wheel trailers must incorporate some form of universal joint or flexible coupling. If the joint relies on a certain amount of play to give the required movement, then there is the possibility of resonance at certain pedaling speeds and trailer loads. The effect is that the trailer feels as if it is 'bumping' the bicycle. However, there are other methods such as spring with a nylon tube inserted through the middle to provide rigidity and flexibility, allowing the bicycle to lean while the trailer remains upright and isolates the bicycle from any resonance. Two-wheel trailers which attach to the rear axle or chainstay generally have an angled towbar to help keep the trailer central behind the bicycle. Standards A voluntary European standard (EN 15918) for two-wheel bicycle trailers was published in September 2011. This standard applies to trailers carrying cargo and/or up to 2 passengers, and enforces a maximum gross weight of 60 kg. There are many safety-related requirements, including restraints, structural integrity, stability, small parts, sharp edges, etc. See also * Outline of cycling * Trailer (vehicle) References External links * Angus adventures \\"Which trailer is right for you?\\" Category:Cycling equipment Category:Utility cycling ","title":"Bicycle trailer"},{"id":"3689213","text":"Ka'ba-ye Zartosht (Persian: ⁄©ÿπÿ®Ÿá ÿ≤ÿ±ÿ™ÿ¥ÿ™) is the name of a stone quadrangular and stepped structure in the Naqsh-e Rustam compound beside Zangiabad village in Marvdasht county in Fars, Iran. The Naqsh-e Rustam compound incorporates memorials of the Elamites, the Achaemenids and the Sassanians in itself in addition to the mentioned structure. The Ka'ba-ye Zartosht is from the mountain, situated exactly opposite Darius II's mausoleum. It is rectangular and has only one entrance door. The material of the structure is white limestone. It is about high, or if including the triple stairs, and each side of its base is about long. Its entrance door leads to the chamber inside via a thirty-stair stone stairway. The stone pieces are rectangular and are simply placed on top of each other, without the use of mortar; the sizes of the stones varies from to , and they are connected to each other by dovetail joints. The structure was built in the Achaemenid era and there is no information of the name of the structure in that era. It was called Bon-Khanak in the Sassanian era; the local name of the structure was Kornaykhaneh or Naggarekhaneh; and the phrase Ka'ba-ye Zartosht has been used for the structure since the fourteenth century, into the contemporary era. Various views and interpretations have been proposed about the application of the chamber, but none of them could be accepted with certainty: some consider the tower a fire temple and a fireplace, and believe that it was used for igniting and worshiping the holy fire, while another group rejects this view and considers it the mausoleum of one of the Achaemenid shahs or grandees, due to its similarity to the Tomb of Cyrus and some mausoleums of Lycia and Caria. Some other Iranian scholars believe the stone chamber to be a structure for the safekeeping of royal documents and holy or religious books; however, the chamber of Ka'ba-ye Zartosht is too small for this purpose. Other less noticed theories, such as its being a temple for the goddess Anahita or a solar calendar, have also been mentioned. Three inscriptions have been written in the three languages Sassanian Middle Persian, Arsacid Middle Persian and Greek on the Northern, Southern and Eastern walls of the tower, in the Sassanian era. One of them belongs to Shapur I the Sassanian, and the other to the priest Kartir. According to Walter Henning, \\"These inscriptions are the most important historical documents from the Sassanian era.\\" The Ka'ba-ye Zartosht is a beautiful structure: its proportions, lines and external beauty are based on well-executed architectural principles. Currently, the structure is part of the Naqsh-e Rustam compound and owned by the Cultural Heritage, Handicrafts and Tourism Organization of Iran.  Name  Ka'ba-ye Zartosht in front of Darius II's mausoleum Alireza Shapur Shahbazi believes that the phrase Ka'ba- ye Zartosht is relatively new and inaccurate, originating around the fourteenth century. When the structure was discovered by the Europeans, its local name was Karnaykhaneh or Naggarekhaneh; the Europeans considered it a special site for worshiping fire, since the inside of the structure was blackened by smoke, and because they mistook the Zoroastrians for fire- worshipers, they attributed the place to them and named it the Zoroastrians' fire temple. As the shape of the structure was cuboid and the black stones that were placed on the white background of its walls resembled the Black Stone, the Muslims' Kaaba, it became famous as Ka'ba-ye Zartosht, the Kaaba of Zoroaster. The Encyclopedia Iranica explains about the name of the structure: \\"Ka'ba-ye Zartosht has probably acquired its name in the fourteenth century, the time that the ruined ancient sites in the whole Iran were attributed to characters in the Quran or Shahnameh. This does not mean that the place has been Zoroaster's mausoleum and there is also no report of the pilgrims' travels there for pilgrimage.\\" Due to the discovery of Kartir's inscription on its walls, it is revealed that the name of the structure in the Sasanian era was Bon Khaanak, meaning the Foundation House, as the inscription reads: \\"This Foundation House will belong to you. Act as the best way you see suitable that will delight our gods and purpose (implying Shapur I).\\" There is no knowledge of the name of the structure in any earlier periods. Ibn al-Balkhi has mentioned the name of the area of Naqsh-e Rustam and its mountain as Kuhnebesht, and has considered that the reason behind its naming was that the book Avesta was held there. The word Dezhnebesht or Dezhkatibehs might have also been used for the Ka'ba-ye Zartosht. Attributes Inside the structure Ka'ba-ye Zartosht is cuboid in shape, and has only one entrance door, which leads inside its chamber by means of a stone stairway. There are four blind windows on each of its sides. The stone used is white marbly limestone, and there are dentate shelves of black stone on its walls. The limestone blocks were brought from Mount Sivand, where they were quarried in a place called Na'l Shekan (\\"horseshoe breaker\\"), to Naqsh-e Rustam in order to build the Ka'ba. These blocks were chiselled into large, mostly rectangular pieces and are put in place atop each other without using mortar; in some places, such as the rooftop, the stones are connected to each other by dovetail joints. The size of the stones varies from to ; however in the west wall, there is a flat stone that is long. Vertical and horizontal cross sections of the structure Four large rectangular pieces of stone form the ceiling/roof, placed along an east-west axis. Each of those stones are long, connected to each other by dovetail joints, and the chipping method used to form them has given the roof the shape of a short pyramid. The anathyrosis style is used here in placing the stones atop each other, but no accurate order is retained in the 'ranking' of the stones. In some places, 20 rows, and in others 22 rows of stones are placed, and this continues to the ceiling. Wherever the original builders discovered any flaw in the main stone, the flawed area was removed and filled in with delicate joints, some of which still remain. Rectangular pits on the outer walls of the structure In order to prevent the finished building from becoming too simple or monochrome, its creators added two architectural diversities: firstly, forming double-edged shelves from one or two flat plates of grey-black stone and placing them on the walls; secondly, carving small rectangular pits into the upper and middle sections of the outer walls that give a more delicate appearance to the tower's faces. The black stones were probably brought from Mount Mehr in Persepolis, and installed on the walls in three rows: * High on the walls just below the ceiling, a small rectangular shelf in the northern side, and two similar shelves on each of the other sides * below the ceiling, two large square shelves on three sides and one small rectangular shelf on the northern side * below the ceiling, two medium-sized rectangular shelves on three sides and one large rectangular on the northern side = Stairway = The stairway of the structure A thirty-stair stairway (each stair is long, wide and high) is placed in the middle of the northern wall, reaching the threshold of the entrance doorway. Thus, the intention was for the Ka'ba to look like a three-floor tower that has seven doors or hatches on each floor; but only one hatch has been made into a true door, while the others are left as holeless blind windows. The structure stands on a three- tiered platform. The first tier is above the ground, and the tower is high including the triple tiers or stairs of its platform. The base is square- shaped, with each side approximately long. The ceiling of the structure is smooth and flat on the inside, but its roof has a bilateral slope that begins from the line in the middle of the rooftop on the outside, creating the pyramid-like appearance previously mentioned. The doorway is high and wide and has at one point had a very heavy two-panel door which is now missing: there are carved-out notches for the upper and lower heels of each door panel in the stone frame which are entirely obvious to modern observers. Some have assumed that the door would have been made of wood, but a stone door of the same kind exists in Solomon's Prison in Pasargadae, very similar to the remains of the one found in Ka'ba-ye Zartosht, which indicates that both doors were made of stone. The doorway leads to a single interior room. This space is quadrangular, has an area of , and is high, with the thickness of its walls being between .  History  A picture of Naqsh-e Rustam painted by Jean Chardin in 1723 The Ka'ba-ye Zartosht is undoubtedly from the Achaemenid era. Much of the available evidence shows that it was built in the early Achaemenid era; the most important evidence for this dating is as follows: * Using black stone on a white background is one of the features of Pasargadian architecture. * The dovetail joints are found mostly in the periods of Darius I and Xerxes I, and the way the stones are aligned is similar to the primary structures of Persepolis. * The doorway and door of the structure is similar to those of the Achaemenid shahs' mausoleums, all of which have used the design of Darius I's mausoleum. * The masonry, which lacks mortar or ordering, resembles the first parts of the platform of Persepolis that were constructed in Darius I's period. Especially, the inscription on the lower part of the southern wall of Persepolis is almost the same size as the stones forming the ceiling of Ka'ba-ye Zartosht. Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago Carsten Niebuhr, who had visited the structure in 1765, writes: \\"Opposite the mountain that has the mausoleums and petroglyphs of Rostam's braveries, a small structure is built of white stone that is covered by only two pieces of large stones.\\" Jane Dieulafoy, who visited Iran in 1881, also reports in her travel journal: \\"...and then we saw a quadrilateral structure that was placed opposite the walls of the cliff. Each of its surfaces was like those of the ruined structure that we had seen in the Palvar desert...\\" The first illustrations of the structure were made in the seventeenth century by European tourists like Jean Chardin, Engelbert Kaempfer and Cornelis de Bruijn in their travel books; but the first scientific description and excavation reports of the structure were done by Erich Friedrich Schmidt that had pictures and illustrated blueprints. The Naqsh-e Rustam compound was first investigated and probed along with the Ka'ba-ye Zartosht structure by Ernst Herzfeld in 1923. Additionally, the compound was probed by the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago under the leadership of Erich Schmidt in several seasons between 1936 and 1939, finding important works like the Middle Persian version of the Great Inscription of Shapur I, which was written on the wall of the structure. Application Ka'ba-ye Zartosht from above the Mountain of Mercy The application of the Ka'ba-ye Zartosht structure has always been controversial between archaeologists and researchers and various views and interpretations have been stated about its application; but what makes its interpretation even more difficult, is the existence of a similar structure in Pasargadae, which makes one evaluate every probability with its circumstances too and consider a similar interpretation for both. Some archaeologists have believed the structure to be a mausoleum; and some others like Roman Ghirshman and Schmidt have said that Ka'ba-ye Zartosht was a fire temple in which the holy fire was placed and it was used during religious ceremonies. Another group including Henry Rawlinson and Walter Henning believe that the structure was the treasury and the place for keeping religious documents and Avesta. A small group believes the structure to be the temple of Anahita and believes that the goddess's statue was kept in Ka'ba-ye Zartosht. Heleen Sancisi Weerdenburg believes the building to be a structure constructed by Darius I for coronation; and Shapur Shahbazi believes that Ka'ba-ye Zartosht was an Achaemenid mausoleum that was used as a site for the treasury of religious documents in the Sasanian era. Erich Friedrich Schmidt says about the importance of the structure: > The outstanding effort that was necessary for creating this architectural > masterpiece, was only used for building a single and dark chamber. Besides, > the fact that they did or could close the only entrance door of a structure > with a heavy and two-panel door, makes it clear that its content should be > kept safe from robbery and pollution. = Fireplace = Engelbert Kaempfer first proposed the assumption of being a fire temple or fireplace; and following him, James Justinian Morier and Robert Ker Porter supported the view in the early nineteenth century. The southwestern corner of the chamber is blackened by smoke; and has caused the assumption that the holy fire was glowing in there. Coin of Vadfradad I (Autophradates I). The picture behind the coin is a structure similar to Ka'ba-ye Zartosht. In the following years, Ferdinand Justi, Ghirshman, Schmidt and some others supported the hypothesis of Ka'ba-ye Zartosht being a fireplace. One of the reasons of this group is that Darius I says in the Behistun Inscription (First column, 63): \\"...I rebuilt the temples that Gaumata had destructed. I returned the pastures, flocks, slaves and houses that Gaumata had taken to the people...\\" Thus, there were some \\"temples\\" in the periods of Cyrus II and Cambyses II that Gaumata destructed and Darius rebuilt them the same way; and since \\"Solomon's Prison\\" in Pasargadae is belonging to the first Achaemenid era and destructed, and its exact copy was built in Naqsh-e Rustam in Darius's period, it should be concluded that those two structures are the mentioned temples in the Behistun Inscription; and since any temple in Persia during Darius's period could not be anything other than the holy fire, those were all fireplaces; besides, Ka'ba-ye Zartosht has been conserved well even after the Achaemenid era and was not surrounded by soil and stones; and in the beginning of the Sasanian era, Shapur I composed the most important document of the Sasanian history on it and Kartir wrote a religious document on it. These show that the structure was religiously important. On the other hand, a structure is drawn on the coins of some Persian kings like those of Otophradates I that is a fireplace and the royal fire was kept above or inside it; and since the structure has a two-stair platform and its two doors are like Ka'ba-ye Zartosht and the center of the Persian kingdom was also in the city of Istakhr, it is the very Ka'ba-ye Zartosht that is drawn on their coins; and on the ceiling of this structure are put three fireboxes and the Persian king is standing in a praying posture in front of it. However, these reasons can not be true, for \\"Ayadana\\" only means \\"worshiping place\\" and a worshiping place is not necessarily a temple; and on the other hand, if you want to say that the people worshiped in this place, it is not true, for the Ka'ba is so small that the compound within can not fit more that two persons. Furthermore, according to Herodotus (section \\"On the Customs of the Persians\\"), the Persians, even in his time, had no temples or statues of gods. Jacques Duchesne-Guillemin in Iranica identifies the ayadana as podiums.http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/ayadana-place-of- cult Additionally, in Achaemenid seals and on their mausoleums, it is seen that the fireboxes containing the royal fire were placed in the free space; and the royal fire was taken before the king in a portable firebox. A remarkable point that Herzfeld, Sami and Mary Boyce have made is that it seems improbable to have spent all that price and effort in order to keep the fire in a dark and holeless room that needed the door open for the fire to ignite. Because fire requires oxygen and the inside of the Ka'ba is built in a way that even an oil lamp can not glow more than a few hours when the door and the large stone entrance are sealed. The chamber does not have an exit way for smoke while its entrance door has always been sealed. The structure on the coins of Persian kings can not be Ka'ba-ye Zartosht; for the mentioned picture on the coins was not higher than , had a two-stair platform and no stairway is seen below its doorway; its entrance door is much larger relative to the structure than that of Ka'ba-ye Zartosht; its ceiling has no steepness, enough to be put three fireboxes on; there is no distance between its doorway and the ceiling; it has no crowns or portals; and the dents showing the heads of its arrows are not more than six. These features generally contradict with those of Ka'ba-ye Zartosht. = Mausoleum = Ka'ba-ye Zartosht in the nineteenth century, by Jane Dieulafoy Most of the researchers assume the tower as the mausoleum of one of the Achaemenid shahs. Since it is very similar to the Tomb of Cyrus and some of the mausoleums of Lycia and Caria in shape, solidness of architecture and having a small room with a very heavy door, it is considered a mausoleum. Welfram Klyse and David Stronach believe that the Achaemenid structures in Pasargadae and Naqsh-e Rustam might have been influenced by Urartian art in the tower-like temples of Urartu. Aristobulus, one of the retainers of Alexander III of Macedon, mentions the structure known as \\"Solomon's Prison\\" as \\"the tower-like mausoleum\\" while describing Pasargadae; and if the mentioned structure is presumed the mausoleum of one of the Achaemenid shahs, due to its similarity to the structure Ka'ba-ye Zartosht, and as Franz Heinrich Wei√übach and Alexander Demandt have explained, the structure should inevitably be considered belonging to another one of the Achaemenid shahs. Besides that, Ka'ba-ye Zartosht is a near to the mausoleums that were built at the same time; and all of them were later separated from the other parts of Naqsh-e Rustam by a chain of fortifications, indicating that they were all originally the same type and had similar applications. In other words, all of them, including they very Ka'ba-ye Zartosht, were mausoleums of Achaemenid grandees. Some other reasons can be stated for Ka'ba- ye Zartosht being a mausoleum; one is the triad and heptad units that are seen in the Achaemenid mausoleums. For example, the three-tomb chambers of the mausoleums connect them to making Ka'ba-ye Zartosht three-floor and its platform having three stairs; and the seven hatches of each floor of the structure remarks the Seven Persian Noblemen on the mausoleums and the Tomb of Cyrus having seven floors. However the probations done do not confirm the idea and the writings carved on the walls of Ka'ba-ye Zartosht have no indication to the existence of a mausoleum or tomb either. = Treasury = The idea of the structure being a treasury was first stated by Rawlinson in 1871. Rawlinson's reasons were the accurate architecture and the proper size of the chamber, its sole door being heavy and solid and that it was difficult to reach inside the structure. Walter Henning presented the theory with newer reasons. One of his reasons is about the inscriptions carved on the rim of the chamber; there is a large inscription by Shapur I on the walls of Ka'ba-ye Zartosht; and below that inscription, there is a writing by Kartir that states in its second line: \\"This \\"bon khanak\\" will be yours; do with it as you believe is better for the gods and us.\\" Some historians conclude that it means the place was used for keeping religious bills, flags and documents. While describing landmarks in Istakhr, Ibn-al Balkhi mentioned the site with the title \\"Kuh-Nefesht\\" or \\"Kuh-Nebesht\\" and said that the Avesta was kept there. Henning believed that Ibn-al Balkhi meant the very Ka'ba-ye Zartosht. In order to disprove this view, it can be said that the chamber of Ka'ba-ye Zartosht is too small to keep the Avesta and other religious books and royal flags; a wider and larger site was necessary for such an intention. Also it can not be accepted that a place that far from the palaces would have been preferred to the large and various palaces of the Achaemenid shahanshahs and official and governmental buildings for keeping the Avesta and royal flags. Since there is another tower like Ka'ba-ye Zartosht in Pasargadae titled \\"Solomon's Prison\\", it can not be accepted that the Achaemenid shahs changed the site of the Avesta or the flags. By the way, if those who believe Ka'ba-ye Zartosht to be the place of the Avesta citing Ibn-al Balkhi's Fars-Nameh, look at the writing of the same book a little prior to the word \\"Kuh-Nefesht\\", it is written: \\"...afterwards, he accepted him; and he had brought the book of Zand for wisdom and had tanned twelve thousand pieces of cow skin and written on; he accepted it for gold and \\"shatasef\\"; and there is a mountain in Persian Istakhr called Kuh-Nefesht.\\" Thus, it is not possible that a book written on the skin of twelve thousand cows fit in the chamber of Ka'ba-ye Zartosht. = Side view = In the recent years, Reza Moradi Ghiasabadi has presented a new interpretation of the structure by doing field research and considers it an observatory and a solar calendar and believes that the blind windows, the stairs opposite the entrance door and the construct have been a timer or a solar index for measuring the rotation of the sun and subsequently keeping the record of the year and counting the years and extracting calendars and detecting the first days of each solar month and summer and winter solstices and spring and fall equinoxes. He concludes that the beginning of each solar month could be detected by observing the shadows formed on the blind windows. However, this theory can not be completely true; and one of the reasons that can be stated to refute the theory is that the direction of the geographic North of each region could be different from the direction of the magnetic North. The orbital inclination of the magnetic North from the geographic North is about 2.5 degrees in the Naqsh-e Rustam compound; and the magnetic orbital inclination of the structure is 18 degrees to the West relative to the magnetic North based on Schmidt's calculations. Therefore, the inclination of the structure relative to the geographic North will be about 15.5 degrees; meanwhile Ghiasabadi has considered the 18 degrees as the inclination of the structure from the geographic North. Inscriptions by Shapur I and Kartir Parthian-language version of Shapur I's inscription On June 1, 1936, following the probations by the digging department of The University of Chicago Oriental Institute, some inscriptions were found on the Ka'ba-ye Zartosht structure that belonged to Shapur I and the priest Kartir; Shapur's Inscription is written in the three languages Greek (70 lines), Arsacid Middle Persian (30 lines) and Sassanian Middle Persian (35 lines) on three sides of the structure; and Kartir's Inscription, which is in 19 lines in Sassanian Middle Persian language, is below Shapur's. In Shapur's Inscription, which should be considered the \\"Revolution Resolution\\" of the Sassanian dynasty, he first introduces himself and mentions the regions he ruled and then describes the Persian-Roman Wars and indicates the defeat and death of Marcus Antonius Gordianus, after whom the Roman forces proclaimed Marcus Julius Philippus the emperor; and the latter paid Shapur a compensation equal to half a million gold dinars for reprieve and returned to his homeland. Following that, Shapur has described his battle with the Romans along with an elaborate list of the Roman states from which he had gathered the forces. The battle, which was for Armenia, was the largest defeat that the Sassanians inflicted upon the Romans. Shapur then adds that \\"I apprehended Caesar Valerian myself, by my own hands.\\" and mentions the names of the lands that he conquered in that battle. He then appreciates the power of God for giving him the power for victory and launches a lot of fire temples for his satisfaction in order to remark the names of the people who were involved in establishing the Sassanian government in front of the fire and finally advises the successors to strive for divine work and charity affairs. The inscription is historically considered very interesting and one of first class proofs of the Sassanian era; and one of the most important documents of the period for the limits and spans of the Sassanian Persian borders. In addition, the inscription is the last time that the Greek alphabet and language is used in Persian inscriptions. The place of the inscriptions of Kartir and Shapur I (the Sassanian Middle Persian version) on the walls of Ka'ba-ye Zartosht Kartir's Inscription, which is situated below the Sassanian Middle Persian inscription of Shapur's, is written during Bahram II's reign and around 280 A.D. He first introduces himself and then mentions his ranks and titles during the periods of the previous kings and says that he had the Herbad title during Shapur I's period and was appointed as \\"the grand master of all priests by Shahanshah Shapur I\\" and had the honor of receiving a hat and a belt by the shahanshah in Hormizd I's period and has achieved an increasing power and acquired the nickname \\"The Priest of Ahura Mazda, the god of gods\\". Then, Kartir mentions his religious activities like fighting other religions like Christianity, Manichaeism, Judaism, Buddhism and Zoroastrian heresy and remarks founding fire temples and allocation of donations for them. He also talks about correcting the priests that were, in his opinion, perverted and mentions the list of the states that were conquered by Persia during Shapur I's period and eventually the inscription ends with a prayer.

Early years  The first Batman figures were lead figurines of Batman and Robin which were given away as carnival prizes at local fairs during the 1940s.  Marx  The Marx Toy Company produced the first ever poseable Batman action figure in the mid-1960s. It stood about 4\\" tall and came with a multitude of accessories among them bat - cuffs, batarangs, and a fire extinguisher. Very few remain in existence and it is one of the holy grails for any Batman toy collector.  Ideal's Captain Action  In 1966, the Ideal Toy Company launched a line of super hero action figures called Captain Action in response to Hasbro's popular G.I. Joe line which followed the standard scale of 12\\". The Captain Action figure came dressed with a cloth super hero costume, hat, ray gun, and sword, ready for kids to enjoy. But parents could also buy additional super hero costumes that were sold separately. Kids could take Captain Action's costume off and replace it with one of several super hero costumes based on famous comic book characters. Also in 1966, the ABC Television Network launched a live action Batman TV series . Because of Batman's growing success in the mid '60s, a Batman costume was included in Captain Action's arsenal. This Batman costume was detailed with a horizontally striped cape as well as a black and gold chest emblem (the costume set was available with both metal and decal chest emblems). Batman's accessories included a blue Batarang, flash light, and drill, which could attach to the utility belt. In 1967, Ideal released a partner figure for Captain Action, his youthful sidekick, Action Boy. Ideal Toy's released only three costumes for Action Boy to change into, one of them being Robin, Batman's sidekick.  Mego's World's Greatest Superheroes!  In 1972, the Mego Corporation, made a landmark deal and secured the licenses to create toys for both National Periodical Publications (later DC Comics) and Marvel Comics.Bonavita, John. Mego Action Figure Toys, Revised, & Expanded 3rd Edition. Schiffer Publishing, 2001, p. 19. Similar to Ideal Toy's Captain Action line, these figures featured cloth costumes that fans could remove. Unlike Captain Action, however, the costumes came with the figure, and were not sold separately. The bodies were a smaller 8\\" size and the heads and clothing were interchangeable.Bonavita, John. Mego Action Figure Toys, Revised, & Expanded 3rd Edition. Schiffer Publishing, 2001, p. 14-15. During this time period, Mego released the very first ever comprehensive line of DC and Marvel character action figures and coined the term \\"World's Greatest Super Heroes!\\" to umbrella the name for all the figures released in this line.Holcomb, Benjamin. Mego 8\\" Super-Heroes: World's Greatest Toys!. TwoMorrows Publishing, 2007, p. 16. The popularity of this line of 8\\" figures created the standard scale for the 1970s and featured many Batman characters, including Batman, Robin, Catwoman, The Penguin, The Riddler and The Joker. The earliest Batman and Robin figures had removable masks but they were easily lost and Mego noted that it was less expensive to create a new sculpt for Batman with a molded on mask and simply painted the mask onto Robin.Holcomb, Benjamin. Mego 8\\" Super-Heroes: World's Greatest Toys!. TwoMorrows Publishing, 2007, p. 27, 35, 37. Mego was a true pioneer in action figure development, responsible for creating the first carded action figure (for S. S. Kresge's),Bonavita, John. Mego Action Figure Toys, Revised, & Expanded 3rd Edition. Schiffer Publishing, 2001, p. 23. The first exclusive figures (Bruce Wayne and Dick Grayson for Montgomery Ward's) Holcomb, Benjamin. Mego 8\\" Super-Heroes: World's Greatest Toys!. TwoMorrows Publishing, 2007, p. 18, 27, 35, 139-143 . and expanded their line to include the 1966 Batman TV series- style Batmobile, the Batcycle. and the Batcopter, as well playsets for Batman characters such as the Batcave and the Wayne Foundation.Holcomb, Benjamin. Mego 8\\" Super-Heroes: World's Greatest Toys!. TwoMorrows Publishing, 2007, p. 34, 148, 218, 219. They were offered for an entire decade from 1972 until 1983.  Mego/Kenner transition  Realizing the success of the 8\\" line of figures, and always thinking of ways to reduce costs of production, Mego Corp. released a smaller plastic line of action toys called Comic Action Heroes! in 1975 that had the costumes molded onto the figure, thus eliminating the extra cost of creating the suits. The Comic Action Heroes were the first ever all plastic smaller scale action figure. The line featured Batman, Robin, The Joker, and The Penguin as well as other DC Comics characters. Later, in 1979, Mego re-released the line under the new name Pocket Super Heroes, a name that would return more than 20 years later as part of DC Direct's super hero line of figures (see below). After Mego made the fatal mistake of not securing licensing for Star Wars, Kenner Products scooped up the licensing and banked on success for the next 30 years. The figures they made were also smaller and all plastic, thus creating a new standard size and style for the action figure.  Super Powers Collection  In 1984, after Mego's demise, the Kenner toy company, who gained great success with their Star Wars plastic figure line, was granted the rights to produce DC Comics character all-plastic dolls in 5\\" scale, and soon after, the Super Powers Collection. Each figure, as the name implies, had a secret super power that would trigger when the figure's arms or legs were squeezed. Kenner produced 3 different Super Powers lines; ending production before such rumored Batman character figures as Catwoman and Man-Bat were produced. During its time on the market, however, the Super Powers Collection managed to release action figures of Batman, Robin, The Joker, The Penguin, and Mr. Freeze as well as several other DC Comics characters. Toy shelves also reserved space for a 1980s comic book styled Batmobile and a Batcopter that would later be reproduced in black & gold for The Dark Knight Collection of 1990 (see Kenner Film Figures).  Toy Biz DC Super Heroes & Pacipa's Super Amigos  Since Kenner had stopped production of DC Comics character figures in 1986 when the Super Powers line folded, DC Comics granted the license to the up-and-coming toy company, Toy Biz, in 1989. Toy Biz first produced figures for the Batman movie tie-in, then released other DC Comics character figures under the name DC Comics Super Heroes, a name that would later be used again by different toy companies (see below). The Flash TV series character received a tie-in figure from Toy Biz as well. Also in 1989, the South American toy company Pacipa bought old Super Powers molds to create a line of DC Comics character figures called Super Amigos. Exclusive to South America, all of the figures were reproductions of Super Powers figures, but made with a low quality plastic and poor paint jobs. This collection also gave way to a Riddler action figure in the form of a repainted Green Lantern base sculpt. A rare piece, this figure is highly sought after by collectors. Back in the US, the Toy Biz line brought some new figures to the shelves not previously featured in the Super Powers line including Two-Face and the Riddler. Like Pacipa's Super Amigos, the figures featured low quality plastic, and the majority was slightly retooled reproductions of the Super Powers line from Kenner. Although the Batman brand of figures seemed to be initially popular in sales the others were not as successful, DC Comics noticed the poor quality of the figures, and quickly cancelled the license, awarding it back to Kenner.  Kidz Biz / Bikin Foreign Releases  A foreign release based on the Batman (1989 film) was an 8\\" Batman figure in Australia by Kidz Biz and in Belgium by Bikin. These figures featured real clothing with removable plastic accessories, similar in style to the Mego figures that debuted nearly two decades earlier.  Kenner movie figures  = Batman = The same year that Toy Biz won and lost the rights to produce DC Comics figures, Kenner regained the rights and quickly produced a line of Batman movie figures. Released in 1990, these were the first DC Comics figures produced by Kenner in four years. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6N3iEj2oRA&list;=PLmkIrDS2Eew1cT_OJ8iwgpwtbxJi8hHyd Kenner's Dark Knight Collection consisted of several versions of Batman, set apart only by different paint jobs and unique accessories. A Quick-Change Bruce Wayne figure and two versions of The Joker made up the rest of the figures. The Dark Knight Collection also boasted several vehicles including a Batmobile and Turbo Batwing as well as role playing toys. Some items were inexplicitly reused from past Kenner lines such as RoboCop and the Ultra Police, SilverHawks, and Police Academy. Others, such as the Batcave Command Center and Jokermobile, were shown in the Kenner Action Toy Guide but postponed for future Batman lines.Action Figures - Movies - The Dark Knight Collection BatmanYTB.com. Retrieved February 6, 2008. = Batman Returns = When the feature film Batman Returns hit theaters in 1992, Kenner renamed their movie line Batman Returns. This new line included several versions of the same Batman figure sculpt as seen in the previous Dark Knight Collection line. The movie's two villains, Catwoman and Penguin, received their own figures. Catwoman received a new sculpt, but the Penguin figure was a repainted sculpt from Kenner's Super Power's line. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Zej0GzvMHQ&list;=PLmkIrDS2Eew0G_BeUnbNf-3KBAuS7nf8_ At the same time Batman Returns hit theaters, fictional teenager Tim Drake became the newest Robin in Batman comics. Because of Robin's rejuvenated popularity, a new Robin figure which featured a sculpt based on the newest comic book design was also introduced in the Batman Returns line even though the character was not featured in the movie. Rumors are that Robin was set to be included in Batman Returns in the form of an auto mechanic who wore the letter 'R' on his work coveralls, but was cut from the film before production. = Batman Forever = In 1995, Batman Forever was released featuring Val Kilmer as the Dark Knight. Breaking away from the repetitive base sculpt of the previous two movie collections, Kenner produced Batman Forever figures using a wider range of fresh sculpts. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QE0wVyWcwM&list;=PLmkIrDS2Eew3diAGC5Gs4QGHys4jd3HmJ Target eventually released their own series of exclusive Batman Forever action figures as well. These were simply repainted figures from the original line, and they came on a newly styled card. = Batman & Robin = For the 1997 release of Batman & Robin, the final Batman film of the '90s, Kenner released the Batman & Robin figure line. Unlike previous movie lines, the Batman & Robin line featured several versions of the movie's villains, not just heroes. Kenner also released several hero/villain 2-packs and 12\\" figures. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySoeZxpeO54&list;=PLmkIrDS2Eew34q1-g26UwJiozB3gP4l2E  Batman gets animated  = Batman: The Animated Series = Shortly after the 1992 premiere of Batman: The Animated Series, Kenner produced a line of figures based on the new cartoon. Like the previous two Batman movie lines, the first few lines of figures included several versions of Batman, and also included multiple versions of Robin and new villains including Clayface, Scarecrow, Poison Ivy, and others. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzLZ5QSxp-0&list;=PLmkIrDS2Eew330OJwkPdgDlpvvtdKHOV7 In 1993, another Batman movie was released, an animated feature film called Batman: Mask of the Phantasm. Kenner produced Mask of the Phantasm figures using old Batman: T.A.S. molds and only a few new sculpts such as Jet Pack Joker and Phantasm. As time went by, Kenner's Batman: T.A.S. line began losing steam, so Kenner retooled some of their figures, releasing Batman: T.A.S.: Crime Squad. This line had several Batman variations, but only included one Robin figure, and no villain figures. Later, Kenner renamed this line The Adventures of Batman & Robin, releasing several figures that were not released as part of the Batman: T.A.S. line, the most famous being a Harley Quinn figure, based on the popular animated series character. Like Batman: T.A.S., The Adventures of Batman & Robin line started to lose steam as well, so Kenner released The Adventures of Batman & Robin: D.U.O. Force. Despite its introduction of a Batgirl figure, the collection primarily featured repaints of old molds with new accessories and quickly folded. = The New Batman Adventures = As Hasbro bought out Kenner, a new line of action figures were produced by Hasbro based on the new animated series, The New Batman Adventures. This line featured new sculpts based on the updated animated series from the WB network. The first Creeper and Mad Hatter figures were included in this line. After the first line of figures was released, The New Batman Adventures line took on the sub title Mission Masters. This line featured new Riddler and Mr. Freeze sculpts. The second Mission Masters line featured repaints of old Batman: T.A.S. figures, including The Joker. To move away from The New Batman Adventures line, Kenner/Hasbro released the third and fourth Mission Masters lines under the basic Batman title. Included were figures from Batman: The Animated Series, The New Batman Adventures, Kenner's Superman Adventures line, and some Batman Beyond (see below) figures. Also included was a new comic style Bruce Wayne/Batman figure, rumble ready Riddler and an animated style insect body Mr. Freeze. Later, Hasbro released several Batman: T.A.S., The Adventures of Batman and Robin, and The New Batman Adventures repaints in the Spectrum of the Bat action figure line. = Batman Beyond = Hasbro released a new line of figures based on the new WB Batman cartoon Batman Beyond. This line, like all Batman lines in the past, featured many versions of Batman, but only a few versions of the cartoon's villains and no supporting characters. Later, Hasbro released Batman Beyond: Bat-Links. Unlike Hasbro's earlier Batman Beyond toy line, this line was not based on the popular cartoon series, but had an Elseworlds computer theme. A Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker movie tie-in line of figures were produced which included several The New Batman Adventures figures as well as Batman Beyond Figures.  Comic figures  = Legends of Batman = In 1994, Kenner released a whole new line of Batman action figures which included all new sculpts instead of reused molds of old figures. The Legends of Batman line of figures included several Elseworlds versions of Batman, but also included true to comic versions of several Batman characters including Knightquest Batman, KnightsEnd Batman, Nightwing, The Joker, Catwoman and The Riddler. This line never gained popularity, though, and was cancelled soon after its debut. Several years later, WB Stores were offered exclusive repainted sculpts of the Legends of Batman line of figures. = Legends of the Dark Knight = After the failed Legends of Batman line, Kenner gave the Elseworlds version of Batman figures one last shot by releasing Legends of the Dark Knight. Based on the popular comic of the same name, Legends of the Dark Knight featured all Elseworlds versions of Batman and other characters. The only character figures in this line to stay true to their comic images were Dark Knight Detective Batman, an online exclusive, and Man-Bat. Like Legends of Batman, this line never gained popularity, and was quickly cancelled. Later, a few unproduced figures from this line were offered as online exclusives. = Superman: Man of Steel = Also in 1994, Kenner moved away from their focus on DC's Batman, and released a Superman comic character line called Superman: The Man of Steel. This line featured several popular characters from the Superman comics, but also included several two-packs which featured Batman and Superman together. Two of the Superman/Batman figures later turned up as mail-away exclusives in the Batman: Total Justice line of figures. (see below) = Batman: Total Justice = In 1996, Kenner started production on a new line of DC Comics character figures. This line, like Legends of Batman and Legends of the Dark Knight, featured all new sculpts of popular DC Comics characters. To appeal to buyers, Kenner produced the line under the high selling Batman title, calling the line Batman: Total Justice. This line featured not only Batman, Robin, and The Huntress, but also included other DC Comics characters including Superman, Green Lantern, The Flash and others. Even though this was the first line of DC Comics character figures released by Kenner since the Super Powers line folded 10 years earlier, some fans were disappointed. Despite remarkably detailed sculpts, the figures' static poses and \\"Fractal Armor\\" accessories caused unhappiness. Wanting more articulation and less gimmick, some abandoned the Total Justice line, and Kenner stopped production after the release of 14 figures. = JLA = Two years after the Total Justice line faded, the Hasbro toy company produced the same figures included in the Total Justice line, this time releasing them under the name JLA (a tie-in with the popular comic title). Several of the unproduced Total Justice figures were produced in this line, but no new Batman related characters were included. A redesigned Joker figure was included in a JLA box set. = Hasbro's DC Super Heroes = Returning to the comic roots of Mego's Comic Action/Pocket Hero's lines, Hasbro released a new line of 7\\" plastic dolls called DC Super Heroes. Unlike the earlier Toy Biz line by the same name, this line featured new sculpts with great detail. Only one line of figures were released, though, and they were very hard to find. The reason for the short life of a great line that had many possibilities remains unclear. Hasbro also produced several 9\\" Mego like figures in the DC Super Hero line as well as Target Exclusives. This occurred between 1999 and 2002, just as Mattel was taking over the line, which halted the line before it was completed. Batman figures included were the MasterPiece Batman box set with a Year One 1939 Batman Figure, Golden Age Collection featuring Batman and Robin, Silver Edition Removable Cowl Batman and Guardian of Gotham featuring a molded cowl head and a Bruce Wayne quick change. Villains offered were the Joker and Penguin. = Batman: Knight Force Ninjas = In 1998, Kenner produced a new line of Batman figures called Batman: Knight Force Ninjas. This line, like Legends of Batman and Legends of the Dark Knight, featured all new sculpts of Batman in an Elseworld theme. Notable figures were the first ever Azrael figure, and a new Killer Croc figure. = DC Direct = To please fans and collectors who wanted better figures, not just repaints, DC Comics started production on their own line of action figures. These highly articulated figures, based on popular DC Comics characters, feature many Batman characters, and also feature storyline inspired character figures including Elseworld figures. DC Direct also released a new line of Pocket Super Heroes, mini action figures that kids could put in their pocket. The Pocket Super Heroes come in boxed sets, including a Batman boxed set featuring Batman, Bruce Wayne, Robin, Alfred Pennyworth, Catwoman and Two-Face. = Batman around the world = To please fans around the globe, DC Comics gave a license to Japanese toy company Yamato to produce a line of Batman action figures. These figures were only released in Japan in 2003, but DC Direct released the same figures in America in 2004. Later, another Japanese toy company, Takara, created a new line of Batman action figures under their long lived Microman Toyline, which was sold in the U.S. market in the 1970s under the name Micronauts. Featuring more articulation than the Yamato line, these figures also saw their American debut in 2004.  Kenner ends, Mattel begins  In 2003, Mattel won the rights to produce Batman and other DC Comics character figures from Hasbro. Before losing control, Hasbro released its final sets of Batman animated figures. Most figures were featured in two packs, and were store exclusives. K-Mart, Wal-Mart and Toys 'R' Us released these figures before Mattel took over production. After Hasbro's line faded, Mattel quickly produced its own line of retooled Batman animated figures to tide fans over until it could release new figure lines. Some figures were new sculpts, some were just repaints of old Kenner/Hasbro sculpts. = Teen Titans = Around the same time as Mattel took over production of Batman and DC Comics character figures, Bandai released its own line of figures based on the Cartoon Network's animated series Teen Titans. Teen Titans: Go! features several Robin figures of different sizes. Batman, however, has no place within the cartoon or action figure collection. = The Batman = After the quickly released animated line faded, Mattel released a new Batman animated line based on WB's new animated series, The Batman. The Batman line of figures featured all new sculpts and more articulation than past animated lines. After several waves of figures hit toy shelves, Mattel renamed the line The Batman: EXP. The EXP (EXtreme Power) hero figures come with a weapon that, when a power battery is connected and turned, reveals an \\"extreme power\\" feature. When The Batman: EXP line faded, a new line of animated figures were announced. ShadowTek, a line that features new animated Robin & Killer Moth figures based on their cartoon counterparts, hit shelves in late 2006. This line also includes re-released figures from earlier lines as well, a growing Mattel staple. Later ShadowTek figures include other DC Universe heroes which appear in The Batman cartoon, including Superman, Hawkman, Green Lantern, The Flash, and Martian Manhunter. In 2007, Mattel announced a large recall of toys, including toys from The Batman toy line, which featured lead paint and/or small magnets which could choke children. = Batman Begins = Mattel released a collection of figures based on the hit movie Batman Begins. The line featured all new sculpts, but it had its share of problems. Most of the costumes and characters featured in the line did not match their movie counterpart. Central characters such as Ninja Bruce Wayne, Ducard, and Ra's al Ghul all featured identical body sculpts simply with different heads. Many figures had poor distribution, which caused fans to miss out on their favorite characters. In 2006, Mattel would release figures for Superman Returns which featured a similar scale and style as Batman Begins. = Four Horsemen's Batman = Realizing that fans wanted better quality figures based on their favorite comic characters, like the Toy Biz figure line Marvel Legends, Mattel released a new line of action figures designed by Four Horsemen studios based on the comic styled Batman universe of characters. The new Batman figures were taller than previously released Batman figures, and featured more articulation. Collectors loved the line, but a higher price tag in stores caused poor sales, which caused the line to quickly fade before the release of new figures, including Bane and Scarecrow, made it to American toy shelves. These figures but were released overseas, though, and American collectors could buy the figures online. = DC Superheroes = After the Four Horsemen styled Batman line folded, Mattel announced it would release more Four Horsemen styled Batman figures, as well as new Superman figures, with the new DC Comics Super Heroes line of figures. Unlike Toy Biz's earlier line of poor quality figures by the same name, the new figures were just what DC Comic fans were waiting for. The first line of figures included Batman, Killer Croc, and the unreleased Bane and Scarecrow figures from the Four Horsemen's previous Batman line. Used and unused molds from Mattel's Batman line would be used in later DC Super Heroes waves of figures, including the previously released Robin and a new Azrael and Catwoman sculpt. = DC Universe = When the DC Super Heroes line started to lose steam, Mattel quickly gained the rights to produce more DC Comics characters outside the Superman/Batman universe. The retitled line, DC Universe, hit toy shelves in 2008, featuring fan favorite DC Comics characters like Red Tornado, Firestorm, Green Lantern and Aquaman. Batman characters such as The Penguin and Harley Quinn were also announced for the line as well as Electric Superman Blue and Red. = Justice League = Returning to the animated line, Cartoon Network's popular cartoon series, Justice League, also got its own line of figures produced by Mattel. The Justice League line features several Batman figures. Later, the line was renamed Justice League Unlimited, in order to keep up with changes made to the cartoon series. In 2006, Mattel released several of the Justice League Unlimited figures under the name DC Super Heroes: Justice League Unlimited. These animated DC Super Heroes were released at the same time as the comic styled DC Super Heroes line of figures. = Exclusives = In 2003, 2 Batman figures, scale to the JLU figures, were released with the Batman: Rise of Sin Tzu video game. The 2 figures were a Batman with his original colors, and exclusive Batgirl figure. It is the only way to obtain these two figures. = The Dark Knight = In 2008, Mattel released a toy collection for The Dark Knight. Like the Batman Begins line, The Dark Knight line also featured 5-inch figures. The film's main villain, The Joker, bore little facial resemblance to Heath Ledger, displaying a simple, cartoon-like face. This likeness would be used throughout most of the film's child-oriented marketing. A Two-Face figure was released in December 2008 along with a Deathstroke and Firefly not to be seen in any future films, but like the Joker figure, they also are more cartoon like than The 6-inch Movie Masters Line. In a first for Batman movie action figures, a 6-inch line of figures was also produced called The Dark Knight Movie Masters. Designed by The Four Horsemen and displaying a much closer level of detail and more articulation than the 5-inch figures, Wave 1 of The Dark Knight Movie Masters were quickly bought up, making finding them in stores extremely difficult for several months. The line's Joker action figure became much desired among collectors due to Heath Ledger's death. = Matty Collector = Mattel began selling exclusive Batman: The Dark Knight and DC Universe figures exclusively on mattycollector.com in 2009, giving fans a chance to order items that are not found in stores. = Batman: The Brave and the Bold = Mattel also released a line of figures and playsets based on the popular Cartoon Network animated series Batman: The Brave and the Bold. = Young Justice = Mattel released an action figure line based on Young Justice. The line included characters from the Batman universe, including Robin and Batman himself. = Arkham City and Arkham Asylum = An action figure line was released after the events and during the events of Arkham City and Arkham Asylum, which are still continuing now from 2009 to whenever the figures are ending. Places such as Toys \\"R\\" Us and the Big Bad Toy Store sell these action figures and many toy reviewers have used these action figures in their videos. = The Dark Knight Rises = An action figure line based on the film The Dark Knight Rises has recently released 7 figures: Batman, Bane, Catwoman, John Blake, Alfred, Ra's al Ghul, and Jim Gordon. = Batman v. Superman & Justice League = Mattel released kid friendly figures from \\"Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice\\" and \\"Justice League\\". Each figure came with movie inspired weapons and featured less articulation and detail than the more expensive DC Multiverse figures. = DC Multiverse = Following the end of DC Universe Classics, 6-inch Batman figures began showing up in the successor DC Multiverse line. In addition to various comic iterations of the character, the line was home to figures of Ben Affleck's portrayal of Batman from the Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice, Suicide Squad and Justice League live-action movies. For Batman's 80th Anniversary in 2019, several special figures were released, celebrating the history of Batman. = True Moves = Mattel released many 12\\" DC Comics figures in the True Moves line, including figures from comics, cartoons, and movies. For Batman's 80th Anniversary in 2019, a 12\\" True Moves 1st Appearance Batman figure was released with a comic reprint of Batman's 1st appearance in Detective Comics #27. = Batman Missions = Batman Missions was a kid friendly action figure line featuring several popular Batman characters in comic inspired designs. A 12\\" True Moves line of Batman Missions figures was also released. = Dollar General / Family Dollar = Mattel released cheaper versions of their basic figures from the Batman Missions line in several \\"dollar stores\\" across America, including Dollar General and Family Dollar. The figures came in a small box, did not include any accessories, and had limited articulation.  Mattel Ends, McFarlane & Spin Master Begins  In 2019, Mattel lost the license to produce DC Comics toys. The license was split between McFarlane Toys, which announced they would produce collector friendly action figures, and Spin Master, which announced they would produce the more kid friendly action figures. = McFarlane DC Universe = In January 2020, McFarlane released their first line of action figures based on DC Comics properties, including Batman and Superman. The figures stood taller than Mattel's DC Multiverse figures and features greater detail and more articulation, as well as more accessories. = Spin Master = In January 2020, Spin Master also released their 4\\" line of DC Comics and Batman action figures which came with mystery accessories.  Funko Pop!  Funko released many of their Pop! Vinyl collector bobbleheads and figures based on various Batman properties, including television, movie, cartoon and comic inspired versions of the Dark Knight.

Every step in the IC design (such as static timing analysis, placement, routing, and so on) is already complex and often forms its own field of study. This article, however, looks at the overall design closure process, which takes a chip from its initial design state to the final form in which all of its design constraints are met.  Introduction  Every chip starts off as someone‚Äôs idea of a good thing: \\"If we can make a part that performs function X, we will all be rich!\\" Once the concept is established, someone from marketing says \\"To make this chip profitably, it must cost $C and run at frequency F.\\" Someone from manufacturing says \\"To meet this chip‚Äôs targets, it must have a yield of Y%.\\" Someone from packaging says ‚ÄúIt must fit in the P package and dissipate no more than W watts.‚Äù Eventually, the team generates an extensive list of all the constraints and objectives they must meet to manufacture a product that can be sold profitably. The management then forms a design team, which consists of chip architects, logic designers, functional verification engineers, physical designers, and timing engineers, and assigns them to create a chip to the specifications. = Constraints vs Objectives = The distinction between constraints and objectives is straightforward: a constraint is a design target that must be met for the design to be successful.Ralph, P., and Wand, Y. A Proposal for a Formal Definition of the Design Concept. In, Lyytinen, K., Loucopoulos, P., Mylopoulos, J., and Robinson, W., (eds.), Design Requirements Engineering: A Ten-Year Perspective: Springer-Verlag, 2009, pp. 103-136 For example, a chip may be required to run at a specific frequency so it can interface with other components in a system. In contrast, an objective is a design target where more (or less) is better. For example, yield is generally an objective, which is maximized to lower manufacturing cost. For the purposes of design closure, the distinction between constraints and objectives is not important; this article uses the words interchangeably.  Evolution of the Design Closure Flow  Designing a chip used to be a much simpler task. In the early days of VLSI, a chip consisted of a few thousand logic circuits that performed a simple function at speeds of a few MHz. Design closure was simple: if all of the necessary circuits and wires \\"fit\\", the chip would perform the desired function. Modern design closure has grown orders of magnitude more complex. Modern logic chips can have tens to hundreds of millions of logic elements switching at speeds of several GHz. This improvement has been driven by Moore‚Äôs law of scaling of technology, and has introduced many new design considerations. As a result, a modern VLSI designer must consider the performance of a chip against a list of dozens of design constraints and objectives including performance, power, signal integrity, reliability, and yield. In response to this growing list of constraints, the design closure flow has evolved from a simple linear list of tasks to a very complex, highly iterative flow such as the following simplified ASIC design flow:  Reference ASIC Design Flow  *Concept phase: Functional objectives and architecture of a chip are developed. *Logic design: Architecture is implemented in a register transfer level (RTL) language, then simulated to verify that it performs the desired functions. This includes functional verification. *Floorplanning: The RTL of the chip is assigned to gross regions of the chip, input/output (I/O) pins are assigned and large objects (arrays, cores, etc.) are placed. *Logic synthesis: The RTL is mapped into a gate-level netlist in the target technology of the chip. *Design for Testability: The test structures like scan chains are inserted. *Placement: The gates in the netlist are assigned to nonoverlapping locations on the chip. *Logic/placement refinement: Iterative logical and placement transformations to close performance and power constraints. *Clock insertion: Balanced buffered clock trees are introduced into the design. *Routing: The wires that connect the gates in the netlist are added. *Postwiring optimization: Remaining performance, noise, and yield violations are removed. *Design for manufacturability: The design is modified, where possible, to make it as easy as possible to produce. *Signoff checks: Since errors are expensive, time consuming and hard to spot, extensive error checking is the rule, making sure the mapping to logic was done correctly, and checking that the manufacturing rules were followed faithfully. *Tapeout and mask generation: the design data is turned into photomasks in mask data preparation.  Evolution of design constraints  The purpose of the flow is to take a design from concept phase to working chip. The complexity of the flow is a direct result of the addition and evolution of the list of design closure constraints. To understand this evolution it is important to understand the life cycle of a design constraint. In general, design constraints influence the design flow via the following five-stage evolution: *Early warnings: Before chip issues begin occurring, academics and industry visionaries make dire predictions about the future impact of some new technology effect. *Hardware problems: Sporadic hardware failures start showing up in the field due to the new effect. Postmanufacturing redesign and hardware re-spins are required to get the chip to function. *Trial and error: Constraints on the effect are formulated and used to drive postdesign checking. Violations of the constraint are fixed manually. *Find and repair: Large number of violations of the constraint drives the creation of automatic postdesign analysis and repair flows. *Predict and prevent: Constraint checking moves earlier in the flow using predictive estimations of the effect. These drive optimizations to prevent violations of the constraint. A good example of this evolution can be found in the signal integrity constraint. In the mid-1990s (180 nm node), industry visionaries were describing the impending dangers of coupling noise long before chips were failing. By the mid-late 1990s, noise problems were cropping up in advanced microprocessor designs. By 2000, automated noise analysis tools were available and were used to guide manual fix-up. The total number of noise problems identified by the analysis tools identified by the flow quickly became too many to correct manually. In response, CAD companies developed the noise avoidance flows that are currently in use in the industry. At any point in time, the constraints in the design flow are at different stages of their life cycle. At the time of this writing, for example, performance optimization is the most mature and is well into the fifth phase with the widespread use of timing-driven design flows. Power- and defect-oriented yield optimization is well into the fourth phase; power supply integrity, a type of noise constraint, is in the third phase; circuit-limited yield optimization is in the second phase, etc. A list of the first-phase impending constraint crises can always be found in the International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors (ITRS) 15-year-outlook technology roadmaps. As a constraint matures in the design flow, it tends to work its way from the end of the flow to the beginning. As it does this, it also tends to increase in complexity and in the degree that it contends with other constraints. Constraints tend to move up in the flow due to one of the basic paradoxes of design: accuracy vs. influence. Specifically, the earlier in a design flow a constraint is addressed, the more flexibility there is to address the constraint. Ironically, the earlier one is in a design flow, the more difficult it is to predict compliance. For example, an architectural decision to pipeline a logic function can have a far greater impact on total chip performance than any amount of postrouting fix-up. At the same time, accurately predicting the performance impact of such a change before the chip logic is synthesized, let alone placed or routed, is very difficult. This paradox has shaped the evolution of the design closure flow in several ways. First, it requires that the design flow is no longer composed of a linear set of discrete steps. In the early stages of VLSI it was sufficient to break the design into discrete stages, i.e., first do logic synthesis, then do placement, then do routing. As the number and complexity of design closure constraints has increased, the linear design flow has broken down. In the past if there were too many timing constraint violations left after routing, it was necessary to loop back, modify the tool settings slightly, and reexecute the previous placement steps. If the constraints were still not met, it was necessary to reach further back in the flow and modify the chip logic and repeat the synthesis and placement steps. This type of looping is both time consuming and unable to guarantee convergence i.e., it is possible to loop back in the flow to correct one constraint violation only to find that the correction induced another unrelated violation.

Built between 1893 and 1904, the church was constructed in memory of the protest that took place at the Diet of Speyer by the Protestant rulers of the Holy Roman Empire in 1529. The tower is the tallest bell tower in the whole Palatinate at . Historical background Inside the church In the latter part of the nineteenth century during the time of the Kulturkampf, relations between Protestants and Catholics were strained. The Ged√§chtniskirche was intended as a mother church for Protestant Christianity, although debates among the Protestants led to a delay of about 35 years between the original idea and the laying of the foundations. The building of the memorial church was a reaction to Johann von Schraudolph's structural renewal and painting of Speyer Cathedral in the years 1846 to 1856. Originally the intention was to renovate the Baroque Trinity Church, situated near the cathedral, but it was decided that a new building should be built instead. In the decorative rose window, the protest is tied historically to events from the Old and New Testaments of the Christian Bible. Construction At first, the reformation church was planned to be built on the site of the \\"Retscher\\", a ruin of an old manor house belonging to the family Retschelin, near the Trinity church. It was believed that this was the site of the 1529 Diet. In order to build the so-called Retscher Church, a building union was founded. With the permission of the Bavarian King Maximilian II the union launched a public fundraising drive in 1857. Because the Protestants were also financing the Luther Monument in Worms, the donations were quite meagre. The Luther monument was unveiled in 1868, in the presence of the Prussian king and the crown prince, who would later become Emperor Wilhelm I. The parish in Speyer used this event to make contact with the Prussian royal house, which would later become very valuable. After it was revealed that the Diet of 1529 had not taken place in the so-called Retscher, the project broke ties to the Old Town. In 1883, the \\"Association for building the Memorial church of the 1529 Protestation\\" decided on the current location of the church. The announcement of the dogma of papal infallibility gave new life to the project in 1870, along with the foundation of the German Empire under a Lutheran emperor in 1871. The builders were determined that the Protestant church should not be eclipsed by the cathedral, which required that its design had to be completely different from that of the Romanesque Cathedral. Forty-five architects from throughout the German empire applied for the call to tender. The five finalist architects all favoured the neo-Gothic style of architecture. The decision was made in 1884 in favour of the architectural partnership of Julius Fl√ºgge and Carl Nordmann from Essen. Architecture Spire As the funds for the building were not yet ready in 1890, the building association turned to the Protestant Emperor Wilhelm II, who promised to ensure the completion of the church. Another main benefactor of the church was Henry Villard.Eger, Wolfgang: Geschichte der Stadt Speyer, Kohlhammer Verlag, Stuttgart, 1983 On 24 August 1893 the laying of the foundation stone took place. After eleven years of building, the memorial church was finally consecrated on 31 August 1904. The church represents the doctrinary neo-Gothic style, and uses relatively pure historical forms. It was mostly modelled on the churches of the Viennese neo- Gothic style, particularly the Vienna Votivkirche, built between 1856 and 1879. =Dimensions= *Overall length of church and tower: *Overall length of the church inside: *Width in the nave: *Width in the transverse house: *Inside surface area: *Height of the arch in the central nave: , in the intersection: , in the aisles: *Tower height: =Site= The church is located to the southwest of the city of Speyer, outside the old city walls, in front of the former Landau Gate, where in the 19th century a new suburb with houses in the Wilhelminian style developed. =Materials and Design= Construction materials The building stones were very carefully chosen. Several quarries were researched. The red sandstone from Weidenthal that was used for the foundations could not be used for further building as it was riddled with pebble stones and therefore not suitable for statuary work. It was also feared that the red sandstone would get darker through weathering, whereas the whitish-grey sandstone from Vogesen would retain its pale colour. The quarry in Lauterecken could not be used because the strata were too low and it was impossible to cut large slabs. A total of quarry stone and wallstones were delivered. The idea of a slated roof was abandoned, because this would have required frequent repairs. Instead, the roof was laid with glazed tiles, fixed with copper wire. The church consists of an arched vault with 3 naves over the outline of a Latin cross. Because of their lighter weight, the arches are built of artificial tuff stones. due to its lighter weight. The high bell tower stands in front of the short nave, with the Memorial Hall in its ground floor. The facades have no steady contours. In the spirit of the Gothic style, it is dominated by the split form, which doesn't leave any larger surfaces, but instead surrounds the whole structure with alternating with abutments and window hinges. The roofs are covered with different coloured glazed tiles that build small diamond patterns. =Memorial Hall= \\"Hier stehe ich...\\" The Memorial Hall is situated in the ground floor of the tower. Like the tower, this has a hexagonal layout. It was a deliberate choice to situate the Memorial Hall in front of the main entrance, as that was the only place where visitors to the church can see the witnesses of the Protest, as their statues were not allowed to be situated in the interior of the church. A bronze likeness of Martin Luther stands on a pedestal made of Swedish granite in the centre of the Memorial Hall. This was a donation from the German-American Lutherans. In his left hand Luther is holding an open Bible, and his right hand is formed into a fist. With his right foot he is stamping on the papal bull of excommunication. Sunk into the ground are the words to remind of Luther's appearance at the Diet of Worms in 1521 (\\"Hier stehe ich, ich kann nicht anders, Gott helfe mir. Amen!\\", which mean \\"Here I stand. I can do nothing else, God help me. Amen.\\") Statues of the six princes who protested at the Diet of Speyer on 19 April 1529 are situated on six further pedestals: #Elector of Saxony, John the Constant #Ernest I, Duke of Brunswick-L√ºneburg #Duke Franz of Braunschweig-L√ºneburg #Prince Wolfgang of Anhalt #George, Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach #Philip I, Landgrave of Hesse At the intersections of the archway ridges in the archway are the coats of arms of the subscribers. In the haunches of the neighbouring portals are the coats of arms of the 14 Imperial cities which affiliated themselves with the Speyer Protest (Strassburg, Augsburg, Ulm, Constance, Lindau, Memmingen, Kempten, N√∂rdlingen, Heilbronn, Reutlingen, Isny, St. Gallen, Wei√üenburg and Windsheim). =Main Portal= David The two parts of the main portal include on the middle column a sandstone figure of King David with his harp, who greets visitors to the church with a psalm on a scroll, and draws attention to the importance of music in the Protestant church: :\\"The Lord will guard your going out and coming in From this time forth and forevermore. \\" Psalm 121 verse 8 On the inside of the portal an angel stands with an open book, warning visitors as they leave to heed God's word: :\\"Blessed are they that hear the word of God and keep it\\" =The interior= The interior differs from a medieval cathedral in that there is no plastering or painting. Pillars and walls are similarly bare, and the only colour comes from the glass painting. Fittings The 36 Windows As with Gothic cathedrals, the colourfully designed window panes are an integral component of the construction. The windows originate from nine well-known studios across various cities of the then German empire. All 36 windows are created in the historism style. The main window in the apse was donated by the last German imperial couple, Wilhelm II and his wife Auguste Victoria. This is why the chancel is also known as the Emperor's Chorus. The seven angel's heads in the three middle windows are portraits of the Emperor's children. Wilhelm II had this to say on this representation of his children: \\"Before they were seven little rascals, today they are angels.\\" Spire from the south-east =Ground floor= :1 Death bed of a Christian woman, which is a symbol of the virtue of Hope :2 The sacrifice of Isaac by his father Abraham is a symbol of the virtue of Faith :3 The work of deaconesses is a symbol of the virtue of Love :4 The burial of Jesus :5 \`Protest at Speyer' (1529) with John of Saxony and Jakob Sturm in 1529, the main reason for the construction of the church. :6 \`Defiant Worms' (1521) with Georg von Frundsberg and Landgrave Philip of Hesse reminds of Luther's appearance before the Diet of Worms in 1521 :7 Whitsun :8 Twelve-year-old Jesus in the Temple links with the scholarliness of Melanchthon in the neighbouring window :9 \`Confessing Augsburg' (1530) with Philip Melanchthon and Chancellor Dr. Christian Baier reminds of the Confessio Augustana of 1530 :10 \`Sorrowing Magdeburg' (1631) with the Swedish king Gustav II Adolf and the Magdeburg Cathedral preacher Dr. Reinhardt Bake reminds of the destruction of Magedbury by Tilly in the Thirty Years War. :11 Jesus heals the sick man at the Pool of Bethesda, one of Jesus's healing miracles :12 Jesus with Mary and Martha :13 The Capernaum Centurion :14 The stoning of Stephen =Vestibule= :15 Duke Ludwig II of Pfalz-Zweibr√ºcken and Elector Ottheinrich of the Palatinate :16 Luther burning the bull of excommunication (1520) :17 Elector Friedrich the Wise of Saxony and Franz von Sickingen =Above the galleries= :18 The calling of the prophet Isaiah :19 The calling of the apostle Paul :20 Farel calling Calvin to Geneva (1536) :21 The crucifixion :22 Left-hand transept rosette: Martyr window :23 Easter morning (angel and women at the empty tomb) :24 Baptism window: Jesus blessing the children :25 The Reformers Philip Melanchthon and Martin Luther :26 The Apostle Paul :27 Christ resurrected and bestowing his blessing :28 The Apostle John :29 The Reformers Zwingli and Calvin :30 Communion window: Elector Joachim II. of Brandenburg and his wife receiving for the first time Communion in both kinds (Berlin 1539) :31 Christmas (The proclamation by the angel to the shepherds) :32 Right-hand transept rosette: Mission window :33 Jesus in Gethsemane :34 Luther posting the theses (Wittenberg 1517) :35 The Sermon on the Mount :36 Moses receiving the Ten Commandments on Sinai Pulpit The pulpit at the altar is a more recent addition. It was created by the Palatinate sculptor Gernot Rumpf, who, as in other areas, has shown his sense of humour here. It represents a net, and is a play on the words that Jesus said to Peter: \\"From now on, you will be a fisher of men.\\". For this reason, there is a net hanging from the pulpit, in which fish have been caught in the shape of those legendary Palatinate figures, the Elwetrischen. The fattest fish with an open book is Martin Luther, and this fish with plaits next to him is his wife, Katherina von Bora. Lectern The lectern is characterised by a grand structure with a variety of materials. Around the main part there are four bronze reliefs, representing the birth, baptism, crucifixion and resurrection of Christ. The top is made of oak in the style of a gothic sacristy. Already shortly after the opening of the church the lectern was seen as too flamboyant, but it was never removed or simplified. The base of the lectern consists of different coloured marble. The lectern was donated by the American railway magnate John Pierpont Morgan, and the columns were a gift from fellow New Yorker William Ziegler. Seating The oak pews have decorations on the ends, which echo those around the church building, along with the arms and names of their benefactors. In total there are 1,800 seats. Organ The original organ is no longer available. This was begun in 1900 by the Stuttgart Organ company C. F. Weigle, and was finished by the √ñttingen Firm Steinmeyer in 1902. It had 65 sounding registers, divided across four manuals and a pedal. This organ was sacrificed during refurbishments in 1938-39. The current organ came from the Organ workshop D. Kleuker in Bielefeld in 1979. Its 97 registers make it the largest organ in south-west Germany. The completely plain backdrop from 1939 is still intact, and was designed by the Munich sculptor Hans Miller. See the German wikipedia page for specifications : Orgel Bells The original bells were cast by Franz Schilling in Apolda in 1900-1903. The Main bell (donated by Emperor) was destroyed in the so-called Glockenfriedhof (\\"Bell cemetery\\") in Hamburg in 1942. The four remaining bells returned to the church after the end of the war, but after their ordeal they were of such a poor quality that a whole new peal was cast by the Karlsruhe foundery the Brothers Bachert in 1959. The eight bells, funded through donations, were named after well-known Reformation figures, along with the Swedish King Gustav II Adolf: 1\\\\. Martin Luther : - - f¬∞ 2\\\\. Johannes Calvin : - - a‚ô≠¬∞ 3\\\\. Huldrych Zwingli : - - c‚Äô 4\\\\. Gustav II Adolf : - - e‚ô≠‚Äô 5\\\\. Philipp Melanchthon : - - f‚Äô 6\\\\. Martin Butzer : - - a‚ô≠‚Äô 7\\\\. Zacharias Ursinus : - - b‚ô≠‚Äô 8\\\\. Johannes Bader : - - c‚Äô‚Äô =The Josephskirche= Josephskirche The Catholics, too, were not keen on the \\"Protestant Cathedral\\". When the Building Association of the Ged√§chtniskirche acquired its site at what was then the edge of the city, the Catholics endeavoured to find a site in the immediate proximity. Thus a Catholic church building association was founded in 1887, and the foundation stone was laid in 1912 near to the Ged√§chtniskirche. Already in 1914 the church could be consecrated in honour of the patron of the Electorate of the Palatinate and the patron saint of the workers, Joseph. In terms of the architectural style of St Joseph as opposed to the Ged√§chtniskirche it was said to be: \\"Catholic variety compared to Protestant austerity\\". The Mainz cathedral builder Ludwig Becker developed the plan, including influence from Art Nouveau, late Gothic, Baroque and the Renaissance. The Josephskirche was meant to be in stark contrast to the Speyer cathedral and the Ged√§chtniskirche. As a particular provocation against the Protestants, the bottom half of the right middle window above the high altar is a proclamation of the dogma of papal infallibility, as this was the motive for the building of the Ged√§chtniskirche. =Emperor William II= children of the imperial household One of the firm supporters of the building was the Prussian imperial family. The five large windows of the choir are also known as the \\"imperial choir\\", because they were donated by Emperor William II and his wife Auguste Viktoria. William II preferred the Romanesque style of building, because of the French origins of Gothic. =Karl Barth= In the 1950s there were plans to completely replace the church windows, which no longer fitted in with the prevailing taste. Critics included Swiss theologian Karl Barth who, after a visit to the church, stated that \\"in the war, there was one bomb too few that fell in Speyer\\". =Situation today= The Ged√§chtniskirche is now the main church of the Evangelical Church of the Palatinate, whose main administrative centre is situated very close to the Speyer cathedral. To celebrate its centenary in 2004, a huge investment was made to renovate the Ged√§chtniskirche. This led to some displeasure among the followers of the Evangelical Church of the Palatinate, as the remaining parishes had to restrict their building work due to budgetary problems.

Its name is derived from the fossilized coral that can be found around the waters of the community which is situated at the head of South Bay. The name of the settlement in Inuktitut is Salliq, sometimes used to refer to all of Southampton Island.Mourir et rena√Ætre: la r√©ception du christianisme par les Inuit de l'Arctique de l'Est canadien (1890-1940) The plural Salliit, means large flat island(s) in front of the mainland.Nunavut CommunitiesTusaalanga History The Sadlermiut (\\"inhabitants of Salliq\\") whose name is derived from Salliq previously occupied the area. The Sadlermiut are thought to be the last vestige of the Tuniit. The Tuniit, a pre-Inuit culture, officially went ethnically and culturally extinct in 1902-03 when a Western illness killed all of the Sallirmiut in a matter of weeks. However, others believe that the Sadlermiut were in fact descendants of the Thule, whose geographically isolated culture would have developed idiosyncratically from the mainland Thule culture. A third theory indicates that the Sadlermiut did not necessarily belong to either group, but because of intermarriage, their roots may have in fact been part of both Dorset and Thule cultures. At the beginning of the 20th century, the area was repopulated by Aivilingmiut, whose name was to be later adapted for the Aivilik electoral district, from the Repulse Bay and Chesterfield Inlet areas, influenced to do so by whaler Captain George Comer and others. Baffin Islanders arrived 25 years later. John Ell, who as a young child travelled with his mother Shoofly on Comer's schooners, eventually became the most famous of Southampton Island's re-settled population. Demographics At the 2016 census the population was 891, an increase of 6.8% from the 2011 census. Coral Harbour is the only Nunavut community that does not observe daylight saving time, remaining on Eastern Standard Time year-round.The entirety of Southampton Island is on DST. The weather station at Eureka, Nunavut is also on DST but is not a recognized community. Transportation The only way to reach this community is by aircraft at Coral Harbour Airport or by water (such as the resupply barges, which do not carry passengers, that come from Churchill, Manitoba and the East coast and St. Lawrence area, every summer) and the main transportation on the island itself (nearly the same size as Switzerland) is by snowmobile and dog sled in the winter and all-terrain vehicle in the summer. Despite the harsh climate there is plentiful wildlife around the island. Among some of the species found there are walruses, polar bears, barren-ground caribou, ringed seals, gyrfalcons, and (rarely) peregrine falcons.  Broadband communications  The community has been served by the Qiniq network since 2005. Qiniq is a fixed wireless service to homes and businesses, connecting to the outside world via a satellite backbone. The Qiniq network is designed and operated by SSI Micro. In 2017, the network was upgraded to 4G LTE technology, and 2G-GSM for mobile voice.

It is a borderline polar climate, which results in barren vegetation. Coral Harbour has never gone above freezing in January, February and March (although the latter has recorded . Due to the frozen nature of Hudson Bay, there is a severe seasonal lag until June despite much sunshine and perpetual twilight at night. Due to the drop of solar strength and the absence of warm water even in summer, temperatures still drop off very fast as September approaches, with only July and August having ever recorded temperatures above . Cold extremes are severe, but in line with many areas even farther south in Canada's interior. Unlike those areas, Coral Harbour remains beneath in terms of average high in the midst of winter. Throughout December 2010 and early January 2011, Nunavut, northern Quebec and western Greenland set many high temperature records. In Coral Harbour, a high of in mid-December broke the old record of set in 1963. The daily minimum temperature on 6 January 2011, was about warmer than normal. The unusual warmth was due largely to an unseasonal area of high pressure over Greenland, and very negative values of the Arctic oscillation and North Atlantic oscillation. Mostly in the 21st century, the conditions have combined to produce an Arctic dipole anomaly that brings warm air to the Arctic regions and cold air to the continents.

APT sits on of woods and meadow just off the Wisconsin River across Wisconsin Highway 23 from Frank Lloyd Wright's studio Taliesin. Founded in 1980, APT has grown rapidly in recent years, with more than 100,000 patrons attending performances each year. It currently claims to have the second largest audience in the United States for outdoor classical theater. APT typically produces 116 performances of nine plays running in repertory from June to November. In 2009, APT opened the new, indoor Touchstone Theatre. With 200 seats, the Touchstone provides an intimate, complementary space to the outdoor amphitheater, and allows for new genres to grace an APT stage. APT's repertoire consists primarily of plays by Shakespeare and other noted (usually Western) playwrights, such as George Bernard Shaw, Anton Chekhov, and Moli√®re. Three of the plays at \\"the hill theatre\\" are typically Shakespeares, with some 20th-century productions performed on both the Hill and the Touchstone. James Ridge & Tracy Michelle Arnold in Taming of the Shrew, 2011 A significant part of APT's mission is its education program. APT works with schools and educators to teach students both about Shakespeare and other classic dramatic works, and about the theater in general. Each season, APT offers student matinees during school hours in the fall. The actors of APT also conduct in- school workshops. APT offers picnic dinners and a picnic area for those who bring their own food to enjoy before the show. Thursday night shows are billed as \\"Skippeth-Out-Of-Work-Early Thursday Nights\\". APT was co-founded by Randall Duk Kim, Anne Occhiogrosso and Charles Bright. Kim was the artistic director and mainstay lead actor for 15 years before reviving a movie career after a dispute with the board of directors.

It was presented by Nicolas II as an Easter gift to his wife, the Czarina Alexandra Fyodorovna. It is currently held in the Kremlin Armoury Museum in Moscow, and it is one of the few imperial Faberg√© eggs that have never left Russia. Design The Moscow Kremlin egg is by far the largest of the Faberg√© eggs and was inspired by the architecture of the Dormition Cathedral, Moscow (Uspenski) in Moscow. This cathedral was where all the Tsars of Russia were crowned, including Nicholas II himself. The cathedral dome (in white opalescent vitreous enamel) is removable, and the remarkably crafted interior of the church can be seen. Its carpets, tiny enameled icons and high altar on an oval glass plate are made visible through four triple windows, surmounted by a gold cupola and flanked by two square, two circular stylized turrets, the former based on the Spassky Tower. The tower bears the coat of arms of the Russian Empire and the coat of arms of Moscow, inset with 'chiming clocks'. It stands on a crenellated gold base and octagonal white onyx plinth designed as a pyramid, and built of more smaller pyramids Surprise The surprise in this egg is music. The base of the egg contains a gold music box that plays two cherubim chants, traditional Easter hymns can be played when a clockwork mechanism is wound up by a gold key. One of the hymns is the \\"Izhe Khveruvimy\\" (Cherubic Hymn #7 by D. Bortnyansky), a favorite hymn of Nicholas II. History The egg commemorates the return to Moscow of the royal couple Nicholas II and Alexandra Fyodorovna in 1903. They had tended to avoid the historical capital due to its ill-omened association with a riot during Nicholas‚Äôs coronation, where hundreds of Moscovites were crushed to death. The egg itself was supposed to be presented in 1904 as engraved at the foot in white enamel on a round gold plate is the date. But the delivery was delayed because of the Russo-Japanese War (1904‚Äì1905). This was followed by the assassination in the Kremlin of Nicholas' favorite uncle and brother-in- law, Grand Duke Sergei Alexandrovich. So instead the egg was only presented for Easter, 1906.

He was the crucial link between the key informant known only as \\"Ulsterman\\" (who came up with the idea of robbing the money-laden night mail train and also provided the details of the schedule and contents of the trains) with the actual gang capable of planning and carrying out such a complex and large scale robbery. He was found guilty of Conspiracy to rob, but his conviction was later overturned on appeal. Field only served time in prison for Obstruction of Justice in relation to arranging the purchase of Leatherslade Farm, near Oakley, Buckinghamshire which was used as the gang's hideout. Early life Field was born on 15 December 1934 at Windsor and was immediately put up for adoption. Service in Korean War He served two years in the Royal Army Service Corps, seeing service in Korea. When discharged from the military it was with 'a very good character'.Crime Archive: The Great Train Robbery by Peter Gutteridge The Korean War lasted from 25 June 1950 until an Armistice was signed on 27 July 1953, with 63,000 British troops involved (part of over 1 million troops on the South Korean side). Field would have been 18 when the war was over. While the Service Corps were considered combat personnel, they were primarily associated with transport and logistics. Later in life, while working with the Children's Book Centre, he would tell Tony Saez about living through the chaotic experience of being shelled during the war. Early career and personal success Brian Field quickly became successful in both his personal and professional lives, he married a pretty German girl named Karin and rose to be a solicitor's managing clerk for John Wheater & Co. Despite the fact that he was only 28 at the time of the robbery, he was already much more successful than his boss, John Wheater. Field drove a new Jaguar and had a house he called \\"Kabri\\" (an amalgam of Karin and Brian) with his wife at the Bridle Path, Whitchurch Hill, Oxfordshire, near Pangbourne, while his boss owned a battered Ford and lived in a rundown neighbourhood. Part of the reason for this is that Field was not averse to giving some of his less savoury clients good information on what some of his wealthier clients had in their country houses, making them prime targets for the thieves. Another key reason, is that an honest solicitor was useless to a career criminal of that era. What was needed was a bent solicitor who could arrange for alibis and friendly witness statements and bribe police and witnesses. As the managing clerk at his law firm, Field was able to carry out these activities and encourage repeat business.Crossing The Line (1995) by Bruce Reynolds On one occasion he described the contents and layout of a house near Weybridge where his wife Karin had once been a nanny to a couple of criminals that he represented at various times in his career, Gordon Goody and Buster Edwards.The Train Robbers (1978) by Piers Paul Read, Pp27-29 He had arranged Buster's defence when he had been caught with a stolen car, and later met Goody at a nightclub in Soho. Field was then called upon to assist in the defence of Goody in the aftermath of the \\"Airport Job\\" which was a robbery carried out on 27 November 1962 at a branch of Barclays Bank at London Airport. This was the big practice robbery that the South West Gang had done prior to their grand scheme ‚Äì the Great Train Robbery. Field was successful in arranging bail for Goody and Charlie Wilson.  Great Train Robbery Field was a crucial member of the Great Train Robber gang. He was the key link between the gang's organizers and the informants who knew the details of the Royal Mail train and he was also crucial in arranging for the gang's escape with the loot and in purchasing the gang's hideout at Leatherslade Farm and was entrusted with its clean up (which ended badly). =Planning The Robbery= The robbery was planned by several parties with no overall mastermind, although the robbery operation itself was planned and executed by Bruce Reynolds, the target and the information on the timing of the train and the amount of cash being carried, came from the unknown individual dubbed the \\"Ulsterman\\". The key field organisers were Gordon Goody, Buster Edwards, and Charlie Wilson, with Brian Field being the key link between the robbers and the informant. According to one account by Piers Paul Read (1978), in January 1963, shortly after the furore of the Airport Job had died down, Brian Field called Gordon Goody to a meeting at the Old Bailey and asked him whether he was interested in a large sum of money that only a large gang could steal. The following day, Goody and Edwards met with Field at his office at James and Wheater (New Quebec Street near Marble Arch). There they met with Field and another man called \\"Mark\\" who was well dressed, aged around 50, with hair turned silvery grey and who spoke with a smooth accent. \\"Mark\\" then convinced them to meet the actual informant and drove Edwards and Goody to Finsbury Park where they met another man they nicknamed the \\"Ulsterman\\", who was a slightly balding middle aged man, who spoke with a Northern Irish lilt (where Goody had grown up). The \\"Ulsterman\\" told them about the night mail trains doing runs between London and Glasgow with large amounts of money. Edwards and Goody then went and discussed the matter with Reynolds and Wilson and it was agreed that they should make a serious attempt. In the meantime they would recruit others and do practice train robberies. On 31 July, Goody and Edwards met with the \\"Ulsterman\\" for one last strategy meeting in Hyde Park. They agreed that his share of the loot would be delivered at Brian Field's house. It is at this meeting that Gordon Goody claimed that when he was in the toilet, Goody checked the pockets of his suit jacket and saw the name and address of the owner, presumably the \\"Ulsterman\\".The Train Robbers (1978) by Piers Paul Read. The sources for this info was Gordon Goody and the late Buster Edwards, with Brian Field not interviewed for the book at all Despite the fact that he was crucial to the planning of the robbery, Field is perhaps best remembered for arranging the purchase of Leatherslade Farm, the robbers hideout. =Leatherslade Farm= Bruce Reynolds and John Daly spotted a potential hideout in Leatherslade Farm at Brill only 27 miles from the crime scene. The farm also happened to be the only major farm in the area not labelled on local maps ‚Äì the perfect hideout from the police. Field arranged for the farm to be purchased by one of his firm's clients, Leonard Dennis (Lennie) Field (no relation), who had come into some money as he was power of attorney over the affairs of his brother, Alexander Field who was serving time in prison. The two Fields went to see the farm, and in return for a promised sum from a robbery (though he was not told that it was a train robbery) Lennie Field agreed to act as the purchaser and pay the 10% deposit. John Denby Wheater, Field's employer, was the solicitor who carried out the conveyancing for the farm. In addition to arranging the purchase of the farm, it was agreed that Brian Field would also arrange for the farm to be cleaned up and get rid of any trace of the robbers after they had left. When Gordon Goody asked about the details he was told that \\"Mark\\" would carry out the role of \\"Dustman\\" and clean up the farm in return for a 'drink' (28,500 pounds). According to Buster Edwards, he nicked 10,000 pounds in ten shilling notes to help pay \\"Mark's\\" drink.The Train Robbers (1978) by Piers Paul Read (Pp80-81) =The Robbery= Field was not involved in the robbery itself, but was intimately involved in the lead up and arranging the escape from Leatherslade. Gordon Goody flew back into England under an assumed name and stayed the night and the following day with the Fields before getting Brian to drive him to Leatherslade at night and only a few hours before the robbery was to take place. The robbery itself was the largest cash robbery in British history and went off largely as planned, with the train stopping at the red lights at Sears Crossing in accordance with the plan. However a new addition to the gang coshed the train driver Jack Mills in the head and an injured Mills was forced to drive the hijacked train to the robbery site at Bridego Bridge. Still on time the robbery was done and the robbers gone to Leatherslade Farm, leaving only 7 of the 128 bags of cash left on the train. The share was around 150,000 pounds for the 17 full gang members (15 robbers, Brian Field and the \\"Ulsterman\\"). Field was then supposed to collect Goody, Edwards and two shares of the loot for himself and the \\"Ulsterman\\", but the police speculation that the robbers were still close by and the description of the vehicle given to police by one of the train staff and broadcast to the public meant that the plans had to be changed. It quickly became apparent that the police believed that they were still in the area rather than fled to London, so the plans changed from leaving on Sunday to leaving on Friday, and the vehicles they had at the farm could no longer be used because they had been seen by the train staff. Field came on Thursday and took Roy to London to pick up his share of the loot and to take Roy James to London to find an extra vehicle. Bruce Reynolds and John Daly picked up cars, one for Jimmy White and the other for Bruce, John, Ronnie Biggs and the replacement train driver. Brian, wife Karin and his associate \\"Mark\\" brought the vans and drove the rest of the gang that remained to 'Kabri' to recover. This was far from ideal as he had not planned to get this involved, but his pretty wife Karin coolly accepted the change in plans. The clean up of the farm had been arranged to be carried out after the robbers had left (although the robbers spent much time wiping the place down to be free of prints and burning some items of clothing). On Monday however, Charlie Wilson rang Brian Field to check whether the farm had been cleaned, and did not believe Field's assurances. He called a meeting with Edwards, Reynolds, Daly and James and they agreed that they needed to be sure. They called Brian Field to a meeting on Tuesday where he admitted he could not be sure that the farm had been cleaned. Wilson would have killed him there and then but was restrained by the others. By the time they had gotten ready to go back to the farm however, they heard some bad news ‚Äì it had been discovered. Trial at Aylesbury In early 1964, 10 of the robbers were in custody, and with three of the robbers on the run (and little prospect of an arrest anytime soon), two others interrogated and released (for lack of evidence) and two others completely overlooked by authorities (no evidence or known ties to the other gang members), it was decided that the trial of those in custody should go ahead. Brian Field retained the services of Lewis Hawser QC for his defence. There were ten charges against 13 men: Robbery (all except for John Wheater), Conspiracy to Rob (against all of them), Receiving (3 charges against Roger Cordrey and 3 other charges against Bill Boal and 1 against Brian Field) and for perverting the course of justice (John Wheater only) =Trial Location Crucial To Outcome= Since the crime was committed in Buckinghamshire, it was decided that the trial should occur there, despite the small size of the local court facilities (Aylesbury Assizes). The authorities were desperate to hold the trial in the countryside out of reach of London, as the Government was coming under heavy fire over the robbery and was insisting on a trial that could not be tampered with by robbers with a proven history of beating the system. This was because, it was known that while London had much more capable court facilities, London juries, particularly for cases involving large robberies were far more accessible to local London criminals and were often tampered with. So to hold the trial at Aylesbury, the local council building was converted into use as a trial court. It was for this reason that Field was desperate to get the trial shifted to London, and had his junior counsel open proceedings by objecting to the first juror claiming that Karin Field had been approached by a man who claimed that he could get at some of the jurors. Tommy Butler however was called upon to investigate the incident and make a report to Judge Davies, who promptly dismissed the claim. There was no way that Butler was going to let Field move the trial to London.The Train Robbers (1978) by Piers Paul Read =Trial Evidence= The prosecution had their work cut out for them as there was no evidence linking the gang to the crime at either the hijacking location at Sears Crossing or the robbery location at Bridego Bridge. This made it tough to establish their involvement in the actual robbery or even the conspiracy. The only evidence against the gang as a whole involved fingerprints of the gang at Leatherslade Farm, and most of these were on moveable objects as the gang had wiped down most surfaces. For Field there were no prints at the farm, but he had been involved in the purchase of the farm, although Lennie Field had acted as the purchaser (although he only paid the deposit) and Field's boss John Wheater, had done the conveyancing. It was obvious to the jury that one of the three men was deeply involved but it was not obvious which one. Lennie Field generally was the most helpful of the witnesses and generally blamed Brian Field for his part of the robbery. =Sentencing= Field was sentenced on 16 April 1964 with rest of the gang who had been caught, and he received 25 years for Conspiracy to Rob and 5 years for perverting the course of justice. He was found not guilty of the robbery itself (and in fact he was not present at the actual robbery). =Appeal= On 13 July 1964, the appeals by Brian Field against the charges of Conspiracy to Rob were allowed. This meant that his sentence was effectively reduced to 5 years only. He was only reluctantly acquitted of the robbery, with Justice Atkinson stating that he would not be surprised if he was not only part of the conspiracy, but also one of the robbers. But given there was no evidence linking him to either the conspiracy or the robbery, there was little choice to acquit him. The charges against the other men were all upheld, with the exception of Lennie Field, Roger Cordrey and Bill Boal. In the end Lennie Field and Bill Boal got some measure of justice, and Cordrey got lucky, although despite the reduction in sentence, Boal still died in prison in 1970 after a long illness. The Train Robbers by Piers Paul Read (1978) =Disparity in sentencing= The two members of the gang who benefitted the least from their share of the loot were also the two luckiest in sentencing, with Cordrey, who had most of his share recovered by police, and Field, who had two thirds of his share found in Dorking Wood by hikers (having been buried there by his father, who had found the money in a laundry bag under his bed) both avoiding 30 year sentences for robbery and conspiracy to rob. Later life Field served out his sentence and was released in 1967. While he was in prison, his wife Karin divorced him and married a German journalist.Signal Red by Robert Ryan (2010) In an article Karin wrote for the German magazine Stern, she confirmed that she took Roy James to Thame railway station so he could go to London, and that she led a convoy of two vans back to Kabri, where the gang were joined by wives and girlfriends for a celebratory party.The Great Train Robbery (Crime Archive series) (2008) by Peter Gutteridge (P 54) When Great Train Robbery gang mastermind, Bruce Reynolds returned to Great Britain in 1968 short on cash (having spent most of his share of the loot on the run), he tried to get in contact with Field, who was the only way he could get in touch with the Ulsterman. It seems that Field was ambushed upon his release from prison by recently released convict \\"Scotch Jack Buggy\\", who presumably roughed up or even tortured Field with an eye on getting some of the loot from the robbery. Field subsequently went to the ground, and \\"Buggy\\" was killed shortly after. Reynolds gave up trying to find him and was caught later that year.Crossing the Line by Bruce Reynolds (1995) (P 257) In an effort to disappear, Brian Arthur Field changed his name to Brian Mark Carlton. Sometime after his release from prison, he married Welsh-born Sian. In the mid/late 1970s they worked for the Children's Book Centre (since sold) located on Kensington High Street in London. Field and Sian were responsible for the company's operations in central and Southern Europe, to where they shipped English language books and held book fairs at international English schools. (The schools were given a certain percentage of the revenue in exchange for hosting the book fairs for several days.) Much of this time was spent in Spain, where Brian demonstrated his guile during a customs warehouse strike in Madrid that was holding up the release of a shipment of books, endangering a number of scheduled book fairs. Brian, along with Tony Saez, who ran the book fairs in Madrid, and under the glare of the burly warehouse workers, simply drove into the warehouse, loaded a van full of boxes, and drove away. During this time, Brian also got to know the Prince of Spain's English tutor, and convinced her to bring Prince Felipe (subsequently crowned King Felipe VI) and his two sisters, then in their early teenage years, to a book fair being held at King's College, an international English school in Madrid. During their extended stays in Madrid, Brian and Sian stayed in the penthouse of the Hotel Aristos (now known as 'La Posada de El Chafl√°non') on Avenida Pio XII in Chamart√≠n. Death Field, aged 44 years, and his wife Sian Louise Carlton, aged 26 years (n√©e Hope; born 20 October 1952, Cardiff), died in a car crash on the M4 motorway on 27 April 1979, a year after the last of the Train robbers had completed his sentence. The accident occurred as they returned from a visit with Sian's parents in Wales. A Mercedes driven by the pregnant 28-year-old daughter of well-known hairdresser Raymond Bessone (better known as \\"Mr. Teasy Weasy\\") crossed a damaged section of the dividing crash barrier and hit Field's oncoming Porsche. He, along with Amber Bessone, her husband and two children, were killed instantly; Sian was not declared dead until the following day, at West Middlesex Hospital. It was several weeks after the accident that Field's true identity was discovered. It is not clear whether his wife Sian ever knew of his past. Brian and Sian were laid to rest somewhere in Wales.

It contains 8 sections regarding the capture and prosecution of terrorists. Payment of rewards Section 501 of the Patriot Act allows the U.S. Attorney General to pay rewards pursuant of advertisements for assistance to the Department of Justice to combat terrorism and prevent terrorist acts. Rewards over $250,000 may not be made or offered without the personal approval of the Attorney General or President, and once the award is approved the Attorney General must give written notice to the Chairman and ranking minority members of the Committee on Appropriations and the Judiciary of the Senate and of the House of Representatives. These funds can be provided by any U.S. Executive agency, the U.S. Army, U.S. Navy or the U.S. Air Force. Section 502 amended the State Department Basic Authorities Act of 1956The State Department Basic Authorities Act of 1956 is also Public Law 885, August 1, 1956; to allow the Department of State to offer rewards, in consultation with the Attorney General, for the full or significant dismantling of any terrorist organization and to identify any key leaders of terrorist organizations. It also amended the Act to give the Secretary of State authority to pay greater than $5 million if the Secretary determines it would prevent terrorist actions against the United States. DNA identification The DNA Analysis Backlog Elimination Act of 2000 primarily allows U.S. States carry out DNA analyses for use in the FBI's Combined DNA Index System and to collect and analyse DNA samples of violent and sexual offenders. Section 3 of the Act mandates the collection of DNA samples of Federal prisoners who were convicted of murder, sexual abuse, child sexual abuse, involvement in sex trafficking, peonage and slavery, kidnapping, robbery or burglary; or for any military offense against the Uniform Code of Military Justice for which a sentence of confinement for more than one year may be imposed. Section 503 of the Patriot Act amended the DNA Analysis Backlog Elimination Act to include terrorismTerrorism as defined in or crimes of violenceCrimes of violence, as defined in in the list of qualifying Federal offenses. Coordination with law enforcement Section 106 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (FISA) specifies how foreign intelligence information acquired by Federal officers using electronic surveillance may be used. Section 305 of FISA specifies how foreign intelligence information acquired by Federal officers through physical searches may be used. Section 504 of the Patriot Act modified FISA to allow Federal officers who acquire information through electronic surveillance or physical searches to consult with Federal law enforcement officers to coordinate efforts to investigate or protect against potential or actual attacks, sabotage or international terrorism or clandestine intelligence activities by an intelligence service or network of a foreign power. National security authorities Three national security authorities were modified under title V of the Patriot Act. FISA granted counterintelligence access to telephone toll and transactional records through the use of National Security Letters (NSLs).Defined in It required electronic communication service providers to comply with a request for subscriber information and toll billing records information, or electronic communication transactional records when so asked by the FBI. The disclosure by any recipient of an NSL was prohibited as under ¬ß 2709(c) they were not able to tell anyone that the FBI had sought or obtained access to records of the person who was being targeted by the NSL. The Right to Financial Privacy Act of 1978 gives the FBI authority to require financial institutions to provide information about their customer‚Äôs or an entity‚Äôs financial records., also Section 1114(a)(5)(A) of the Right to Financial Privacy Act of 1978 The Fair Credit Reporting Act requires a consumer reporting agency to provide the FBI the names and addresses of all financial institutions at which a consumer maintains or has maintained an account., also Section 624 of the Fair Credit Reporting Act Section 505 of the Patriot Act allowed the use of NSLs to be made by a Special Agent in charge of a Bureau field office. Previously only the Director or the Deputy Assistant Director of the FBI were able to certify such requests. The requests for counterintelligence access to telephone toll and transactional records made under FISA can ask for the name, address, length of service, and local and long distance toll billing records of a subscriber, or the name, address, and length of service of an employee of the provider. The Patriot Act modified all the authorities mentioned above to allow for requests for information to be granted only if written certification is provided that the information is \\"relevant to an authorized investigation to protect against international terrorism or clandestine intelligence activities, provided that such an investigation of a United States person is not conducted solely on the basis of activities protected by the first amendment to the Constitution of the United States\\". In 2004, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) filed a lawsuit on behalf of an unknown Internet Service Provider against the U.S. government (American Civil Liberties Union v. Ashcroft (2004)), contending that the NSLs used under violated the First and Fourth Amendments of the US Constitution. The ACLU's reasoning was that: * Section 2709 failed to spell out any legal process whereby a telephone or Internet company could try to oppose an NSL subpoena in court, and * Section 2709 prohibited the recipient of an NSL from disclosing that he had received such a request from the FBI, and outweighs the FBI's need for secrecy in counter-terrorism investigations. The court granted the plaintiff's motion, agreeing that the NSLs violated the Fourth Amendment because their use \\"effectively bars or substantially deters any judicial challenge to the propriety of an NSL request\\". The court also found that the prohibitions of disclosure in , which it described as being \\"unable to sever from the remainder of the statute\\", was an \\"unconstitutional prior restraint on speech in violation of the First Amendment\\". Extension of Secret Service jurisdiction Section 1030 of Title 18 of the U.S. Code specifies punishments for various computer crimes.

He had also been a boxer, and owned a nightclub and a flower shop. Early and private life Edwards was born in Lambeth, the son of a barman. After leaving school, he worked in a sausage factory, where he began his criminal career by stealing meat to sell on the post-war black market. During his National Service in the RAF, he was detained for stealing cigarettes. When he returned to south London, he ran a drinking club and became a professional criminal.Richard Hobbs, 'Edwards, Ronald Christopher [Buster] (1931‚Äì1994)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, Sept 2004 accessed 21 Sept 2010 He married June Rothery in 1952. They had a daughter, Nicola. He was involved in the theft of ¬£62,000 (¬£ today) from Comet House, the headquarters of British Overseas Airways Corporation at Heathrow Airport, in 1962. Many of the gang were captured, but Edwards escaped arrest. Many from the same gang were involved in the Great Train Robbery in August 1963. Great Train Robbery The Great Train gang intercepted the Glasgow‚ÄìLondon mail train in Buckinghamshire in the early hours of 8 August 1963. After tampering with the track-side signal lights, they stopped the train at Sears Crossing and moved the engine and high-value carriage to Bridego Bridge, near Cheddington, and they escaped with ¬£2,600,000 of used banknotes (¬£ today). The driver, Jack Mills, was beaten over the head and suffered from related complications for the rest of his life‚Äîopinion is divided as to whether the injury was a factor in his death. The gang's temporary hideout at Leatherslade Farm was quickly found. Most of the gang were captured, tried, and imprisoned, but Edwards evaded arrest with his ¬£150,000 share of the stolen money. Edwards and another gang member, Bruce Reynolds, took their families to Mexico. The money ran out, and Edwards' family became homesick, so he negotiated his return to England in 1966. He was arrested and sentenced to 15 years in jail. Later life Edwards spent nine years in prison. After his early release in 1975, he ran a flower stall outside Waterloo station in London. He gave interviews to writer Piers Paul Read, persuading him to write in his 1978 book The Train Robbers that the robbery was led by German commando Otto Skorzeny, and that Edwards was the person responsible for hitting Jack Mills. Edwards later retracted these claims. Buster, a film about his role in the Great Train Robbery, was made in 1988, with Edwards played by Phil Collins. Buster Edwards can be seen making a cameo appearance in the film Buster alongside Phil Collins' wife Jill in the scene in which Buster and June land in Mexico, he and Jill walk out of the airport in front of Buster and June Edwards. Theft by Dexter Fletcher In 1991, Edwards was the victim of a theft, albeit of a more mundane nature. On 15 June, at about 3pm, British actor Dexter Fletcher ran along Mepham Street and scooped up two bunches of nasturtiums valued at ¬£5 from Edwards' stall. Edwards declined to chase Fletcher for fear of leaving his stall unattended. Fletcher was seen to run off on to York Road with the flowers. Edwards reported the theft to the police, identifying his assailant as being, \\"That lad out of The Rachel Papers\\". Fletcher was unlucky in the timing of his theft because Edwards had seen the film for the first time only days before. Fletcher was arrested and charged with theft. The following week Fletcher appeared at Horseferry Road Magistrates' Court and pleaded guilty. He was given a conditional discharge for twelve months and ordered to pay ¬£30 costs. In mitigation, Fletcher said that the flowers were for his girlfriend and Press Gang co-star Julia Sawalha, but that he had lost his cash card and was unable to obtain funds to pay for the flowers. Fletcher subsequently apologised to Edwards and compensated him for the flowers.Bruce Reynolds, The Autobiography of a Thief (Virgin Books, 2005), p.193. Death Edwards died in Lambeth, London, at the age of 63. He was found by his brother, hanging from a steel girder inside a lock-up garage in Leake Street, Lambeth.Train robber Edwards is found hanged, The Independent, 30 November 1994Ronald (Buster) Edwards, Great Train Robber, New York Times, 5 December 1994 At the Inquest following Edwards' death, a panel recorded an open verdict, based on testimony that the deceased was too intoxicated to form an intent to kill himself.Buster Edwards \`too drunk' to have committed suicide, The Independent, 10 February 1995 However, at the time of his death, he was being investigated by the police as part of an inquiry into a suspected large-scale fraud and it is speculated that fear of being re-imprisoned could have led to a suicide attempt. Edwards was survived by his wife and their daughter.

It is similar to the Women's Institute (WI) but its activities are conducted through the medium of Welsh. Its aims are to promote women's issues and to support culture, education and the arts in Wales. History was established in 1967 when the WI insisted on English as the official language of the movement. There had been an historic use of Welsh in the WI, and with over two hundred and fifty branches in Wales this decision was unpopular. The WI branch in the village of Parc, Llanycil broke away from the movement and began Merched y Wawr, which would operate solely in Welsh. The movement grew quickly and in the late 1980s the organisation had over 10,000 members and more than 275 branches.

Early life and education Green was born in Charleston, South Carolina on March 31, 1911. He was exposed to music from an early age, and learned the banjo before picking up the guitar in his early teenage years. A friend of his father by the name of Sam Walker taught a young Freddie to read music, and keenly encouraged him to keep up his guitar playing. Walker gave Freddie what was perhaps his first gig, playing with a local community group of which Walker was an organizer. Another member of the group was William \\"Cat\\" Anderson, who went on to become an established trumpeter, working with notable figures such as Duke Ellington. Career It was around this time that Green's parents died, and he moved to New York City to live with his aunt and continue his education. The move opened up a new musical world to Freddie. While still in his teens, he began to play around the clubs of the city, earning money and a reputation. In one of these gigs, he was noticed by the legendary talent scout John H. Hammond, who realized the potential of Green and introduced him to Basie. In 1937, Basie and his ensemble went to one of Green's gigs on the advice of an associate. Basie was an immediate fan, and approached Green with a job offer. Except for a brief interruption, Freddie Green would remain a pivotal fixture of the Count Basie Band for the next fifty years. Throughout his career, Green played rhythm guitar, accompanying other musicians, and he rarely played solos. \\"His superb timing and ... flowing sense of harmony ... helped to establish the role of the rhythm guitar as an important part of every rhythm section.\\" Green did play a solo on the January 16, 1938, Carnegie Hall concert that featured the Benny Goodman big band. In the jam session on Fats Waller's \\"Honeysuckle Rose,\\" Green was the rhythm guitarist for the ensemble, which featured Basie, Walter Page (Basie's bassist), and musicians from Duke Ellington's band. After Johnny Hodges' solo, Goodman signalled to Green to take his own solo, which the musician Turk Van Lake described in his commentary on the reissued 1938 Carnegie Hall concert as a \\"startling move.\\" He rapidly changed chords, often with every beat, rather than every measure. His chord fingering often involved him covering four strings with his fingers, while depressing only a subset of the notes. He dampened the unsounded notes from chords with his left hand. Green's playing on his signature Stromberg guitar was the model for Ralph Patt's big-band playing. Green was not a prolific composer, but he did make two major contributions to Count Basie's repertoire, \\"Down for Double\\" (recorded in 1941) and \\"Corner Pocket\\" (recorded for the album April in Paris in 1955). Green died of a heart attack in Las Vegas, Nevada at the age of 75.

Wacker and Waterview Tower) is a luxury rental apartment tower located in downtown Chicago, Illinois. The building is located between LaSalle Street and Clark Street, adjacent to River North and directly on the Chicago River. The building was developed by Related Midwest in a joint venture with Clark Wacker LLC and designed by architect Gary Handel of Handel Architects LLP. Kara Mann of Kara Mann Design was selected for interior design. OneEleven was completed in 2014. OneEleven stands tall, with 504 units throughout located on 60 stories. The building has 470 total parking spaces, approximately of amenity space, and of retail space. The tower was built on Wacker Drive, between LaSalle Street and Clark Street, where a parking lot had been. The building's official address is 111 W. Wacker Drive. Design and architecture OneEleven was designed as a retrofit for the abandoned Waterview Tower project, designed by Thomas Hoepf of Teng and Associates, Inc., and developed in association with Waterview LLC, of which only 26 floors were ever completed. The old building was salvaged and renovated. The original stone fa√ßade of the building was removed in favor of a glass exterior, and an additional 34 floors were added to its height. Where the old and new sections of building meet there is an amenities level with indoor pool, sun deck, fire pit and outdoor kitchens. History Construction began in 2005 and continued through May 2008, when construction ceased on the original Waterview Tower, after the parking garage portion and most of the hotel floors had been completed. The first 26 floors of OneEleven were originally part of Waterview Tower, which was intended to be a 92-story luxury hotel and condominium; financial setbacks caused construction to halt in 2008. It was initially planned to have parking for guests and residents on floors 2 to 11, and a setback at the 29th floor would have held a rooftop garden and the amenities level for guests and residents. The remaining 30th through 88th floors were to have comprised 233 condominium and penthouse residences. Originally designed to be a concrete building; an exterior wall made of glass, granite and aluminum was designed to resemble a prism. In 2011, developer Related Midwest took an interest in the abandoned tower and conducted an engineering study of the property to determine if any of the existing structure was salvageable. The results of the study were favorable and it was decided to renovate and add on to the old tower. In 2012, 111 West Wacker Partners LLC, the new joint venture, proposed a completely new design that re-purposed the existing structure into a luxury rental tower to better suit the current real estate market. As a result, the building would no longer contain a hotel and condominiums, but contain 506 rental units, an expansive first-floor retail space, and 439 parking spaces. The new building, designed by Handel Architects, is substantially smaller in height, at 59 stories and tall. In January 2015, about six months after its opening, developer Related sold the whole building for $328.225 million to Heitman. The average price of $651,000 per unit reportedly set a record for apartment buildings in Chicago.

It is the sixth track from their 1987 album, The Joshua Tree. A rough version of this song was worked on during the early Joshua Tree album writing sessions in 1985. The focus of the song is on the National Union of Mineworkers' 1984 strike in Great Britain that occurred in response to the National Coal Board's campaign to close uneconomic mines. A music video was produced in February 1987 for the song and was directed by Neil Jordan. The song was planned for release as the album's second single, but it was ultimately shelved in favour of \\"I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For\\". A new mix of the song by producer Steve Lillywhite was released as a single in April 2017. Background and recording In 1984, the National Union of Mineworkers, aggressively opposed by the government led by Margaret Thatcher, declared a strike in response to the British National Coal Board's decision to close down a large swathe of the United Kingdom's coal mines, which had become unprofitable. The civil discord created by the dispute, both politically, socially, and in violent confrontations between trade union pickets and the United Kingdom's police forces in the affected areas, was one of the most divisive and bitter civic conflicts in Britain in the 20th Century, and its societal and economic impact on the working class coal-mining based communities in Wales, across the English Midlands and the North was severe. In 1984, Bob Dylan played at Slane Castle in Ireland. U2 singer Bono interviewed him for Hot Press magazine and Dylan invited Bono to sing on stage with him. The meeting confirmed for Bono, whose \\"record collection started in 1976\\", how much he still had to learn about the traditions of singing, songwriting, and musicianship. A friendship developed between Bono and Dylan with Bono delving into Dylan's back catalogue and retracing the connections between Irish and American folk music. He was also listening to the blue-collar labour songs of Bruce Springsteen. U2's growing awareness of folk traditions was reflected in their performance at a 25th anniversary tribute on The Late Late Show to folk veterans the Dubliners. U2 performed Peggy Seeger's \\"Springhill Mining Disaster\\" which tells the story of a mining disaster in Nova Scotia. These strands came together in \\"Red Hill Mining Town\\", a rough version of which was worked up during the early Joshua Tree album writing sessions in late 1985.McCormick (2006), p. 172 Bono's lyrics focused on the stress the dispute had on families and their relationships, many of which broke down. In particular, inspiration was drawn from the Tony Parker book Red Hill: A Mining Community. Bono was criticised in some quarters for not being politically specific enough. However, Bono said he felt he was more interested in the relationships and that others were more qualified to comment on the strike itself. During recording, Bono was displeased with an early vocal take and wondered why his voice made him sound \\"like a rich man with pound notes stuffed in his pockets when it's a song about unemployment\\". The audio engineer determined that the stereo plate reverb effect that had been added to the vocals was contributing to this feeling, and as a result, it was removed. Ultimately, U2 were not completely satisfied with the final result; producer Steve Lillywhite, who mixed the track, said, \\"It never got finished the way they wanted it. They always thought it could be a little bit better.\\" One of the issues was that the brass accompaniment played by the Arklow Silver Band was considered out of tune. As a result, Lillywhite was told to raise the synthesiser track in the mix, as \\"in 1986, we were very impressed that you could get really good sounding brass instruments out of a keyboard.\\" =2017 mix= For the 30th anniversary reissue of The Joshua Tree in 2017, new mixes of several songs were created, including \\"Red Hill Mining Town\\". The 2017 mix of the song was worked on using stems from the original recording; the band and Lillywhite communicated over e-mail, as the producer was residing in Indonesia. Looking back on the original mix, Lillywhite believed it was a mistake to de-emphasize the brass, saying of the synthesiser, \\"yes it's a good sound, but sometimes the sound is not as important as the spirit.\\" Since the brass was recorded on just two tracks, Lillywhite could not Auto-Tune the recording. Instead, he turned up the horns based on a recommendation that Rolling Stones guitarist Keith Richards made 30 years earlier. Whenever Richards' guitar would get out of tune over the course of a take, instead of lowering the instrument in the mix and covering it with an overdub, he would turn it up so that, despite sounding out of tune, it would \\"own the sound\\". Describing the new mix of \\"Red Hill Mining Town\\", Lillywhite said, \\"the brass band is much more emotive than someone playing it on a keyboard\\". Other changes for the new mix were complicated by audio spill; U2 had recorded the song as a single studio performance, resulting in the drums leaking onto the track for the bass guitar amplifier. Guitarist the Edge asked Lillywhite to raise the guitar in the mix. Bono, believing he could sing the song better and with more sincerity, told Lillywhite, \\"I hate the singer\\", and subsequently re-recorded his vocals for the verses. Lillywhite said, \\"I actually had to match a 56-year-old Bono with a 26-year-old Bono and they mixed well. I was very happy. It's quite powerful sounding.\\" Aborted single release and live performances A music video for the song was produced in February 1987 in London and directed by Neil Jordan.McGee (2008), p. 100 It was filmed on a set representing an underground mine. The video was included on the bonus DVD of the 20th Anniversary Super Deluxe Box reissue of The Joshua Tree. The song was initially planned for release as The Joshua Trees second single, but U2 were unhappy with the video and Bono was unable to sing the high notes during pre-Joshua Tree Tour rehearsals. The song was dropped as a single and \\"I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For\\" became a late choice for the second single.McGee (2008), p. 103 U2 drummer Larry Mullen Jr. later described it as \\"one of the lost songs\\" and that while he thought it had had great potential, it was \\"over-produced and under-written\\". While Bono had clear ideas on how he wanted it to sound during The Joshua Tree sessions, Mullen recalls that the rest of the band and production crew were \\"[not] sure where he was going with it.\\"McCormick (2006), p. 184 For 30 years it was known as the only song from The Joshua Tree never to be played live, although it was soundchecked in November 1987.U2gigs.com, U2 live on 28 November 1987, Murfreesboro, Tennessee, USA. In 2017, the band embarked on the Joshua Tree Tour 2017, playing the album in its entirety, and as a result, the song was played live for the first time. Critical reception Bill Graham of Hot Press contrasted the song with two of the album's other ballads, \\"I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For\\" and \\"Running to Stand Still\\", describing it as the album's \\"most cluttered and literal, least mysterious and open-ended track\\". He said the blocked harmonies show the band \\"striving too ambitiously and conventionally for effect\\" and likened the song to a \\"scarf-waving variant of 'Sailing' written for the National Union of Mineworkers\\". He described the melody, however, as \\"undeniably potent and infectious\\", and he praised the band's good intentions in writing about the mining strikes. Niall Stokes said that the song \\"capture[ed] eloquently [...] the sense of doom that surrounded the death of the small close-knit mining communities\\".

He entered Jesus College, Oxford, in 1638, and remained there for a decade during the English Civil War. Vaughan took part in the Battle of Rowton Heath in 1645. Although still based in Oxford, he became Rector of Llansantffraed (St Bridget), Wales, in 1640 and took up medical studies, motivated by the lack of doctors there. In 1650, however, Vaughan was evicted from the parish for his Royalist sympathies and alleged drunkenness. Vaughan later became involved in a plan by Robert Child to form a chemical club, with a laboratory and library, the main aim being to translate and collect chemical works. He married his wife Rebecca in 1651 and spent the next period of his life in London. His wife died in 1658. After the Restoration, he found a patron in Sir Robert Moray, with whom he fled from London to Oxford during the plague of 1665. Vaughan died at the house of Samuel Kem, at Albury, Oxfordshire. Works Although he did not practice medicine, Vaughan sought to apply his chemical skills to preparing medicines in the manner recommended by Paracelsus. He corresponded with Samuel Hartlib, who by 1650 was paying attention to Vaughan as author, and established a reputation with his book Anthroposophia Theomagica, a magico-mystical work. Vaughan was the author of tracts published under the pseudonym Eugenius Philalethes, as is now generally agreed. Vaughan was unusual amongst alchemists of the timePeter Levenda The Tantric Alchemist: Thomas Vaughan and the Indian Tantric Tradition(2015) in that he worked closely with his wife Rebecca Vaughan. He was a self-described member of the \\"Society of Unknown Philosophers\\", and was responsible for translating into English in 1652 the Fama Fraternitatis Rosae Crucis, an anonymous Rosicrucian manifesto first published in 1614 in Kassel, Germany. Allen G. Debus has written that a simple explanation of Vaughan's natural philosophy, in its mature form, is as the De occulta of Cornelius Agrippa, in an exposition coming via the views of Michael Sendivogius. As a writer in the school of Sendivogius, Vaughan follows Jacques de Nuisement and Andreas Orthelius. He placed himself in the tradition of the Rosicrucian reformers of education, and of Johannes Trithemius, his teacher Libanius Gallus, and Pelagius of Majorca, teacher of Libanius (of whom the last two are not known to have been real people apart from what Trithemius relates of them). According to some writers of catalogues of hermetic and alchemical treatises (such as John Ferguson, Denis Ian Duveen, Vinci Verginelli et al.), Thomas Vaughan could be the anonymous author of the treatise Reconditorium ac Reclusorium Opulentiae Sapientiaeque Numinis Mundi Magni, cui deditur in titulum CHYMICA VANNUS...

Controversies Vaughan quarrelled in print with Henry More. Their pamphlet war petered out, but More returned to the subject of alchemists in Enthusiasmus Triumphatus (1656). Another critic of Vaughan was John Gaule. Vaughan fell out with an alchemical collaborator, Edward Bolnest, over money matters and alleged broken promises, and the matter came to litigation after Bolnest had threatened violence. Vaughan was accused as part of this affair of spending \\"most of his time in the study of Naturall Philosophy and Chimicall Phisick\\". He is reported as having confessed that he had \\"long sought and long missed... the philosopher's stone.\\" In 1896 Vaughan was the subject of an hoax making alleged revelations as to the practice of devil-worship by the initiates of freemasonry, and that Thomas had helped to found freemasonry as a Satanic society. The inventors of the hoax were some unscrupulous Paris journalists.

It was occupied by pastoralists during the early- to mid-Holocene. The site is where the Tashwinat Mummy was found, which was dated to around 5600 BP. It now resides in the Assaraya Alhamra Museum in Tripoli.  Location  Uan Muhuggiag is a rock shelter in southwestern Libya in what is now the Sahara Desert. It is located on the bank of the Wadi Teshuinat, sitting on a plateau in the Tadrart Acacus at almost 3000 feet above sea level. The site is about 1500 miles west of the Nile Valley.  History  Uan Muhuggiag was first excavated in 1950. The Tashwinat Mummy was discovered by University of Rome Professor Fabrizio Mori in 1958. More recently, in 1982, the site was also excavated by Barbara Barich.  Stratigraphy  Uan Muhuggiag appears to have been inhabited from at least the 6th millennium BC to about 2700 BC, although not necessarily continuously. The stratigraphic sequence comprises seven distinct occupation levels. Layer 1 is the very top layer, followed by layer 1a. The middle level is labeled from 2a to 2d, with 2d being the oldest. Finally, below that, there is also a layer 3, which is further subdivided into section A, at the top, and section B, at the bottom. Layer 1 has been dated as beginning around 3800 BP, and consists of loose aeolian sand at the very top, slightly cemented sand and dung below that, and hearths at the bottom. Further down, layer 2 has evidence of humified organic sand and lenses of fresh plant remains. These two layers represent the period of human occupation of the shelter. Layer 3 has even stronger humidified sand, as well as gypsum concretions. The stratigraphic sequence suggests that the shelter was inhabited during a much wetter period than today. The Tashwinat Mummy was found on the eastern side of a 160 by 80 cm. excavation, under the lowest layer of coals, where the sandstone floor showed a deliberate round excavation of about 25 cm. in diameter and 3 cm. deep. The mummy lay just beneath a layer of vegetable fibers.  Finds  = Tashwinat Mummy = The most noteworthy find at Uan Muhuggiag is the well- preserved mummy of a young boy of approximately 2 1/2 years old. The child was in a fetal position, then embalmed, then placed in a sack made of antelope skin, which was insulated by a layer of leaves. The boy's organs were removed, as evidenced by incisions in his stomach and thorax, and an organic preservative was inserted to stop his body from decomposing. An ostrich eggshell necklace was also found around his neck. Radiocarbon dating determined the age of the mummy to be approximately 5600 years old, which makes it about 1000 years older than the earliest previously recorded mummy in ancient Egypt. However of similar or older age Egyptian mummy is now the Turin mummy dated to 5,600 years In 1958-1959, an archaeological expedition led by Antonio Ascenzi conducted anthropological, radiological, histological and chemical analyses on the Uan Muhuggiag mummy. The specimen was determined to be that of a 30-month old child of uncertain sex, who possessed Negroid features. A long incision on the specimen's abdominal wall also indicated that the body had been initially mummified by evisceration and later underwent natural desiccation. One other individual, an adult, was found at Uan Muhuggiag, buried in a crouched position. However, the body showed no evidence of evisceration or any other method of preservation. The body was estimated to date from about 7500 BP. = Rock art = Among other significant finds at Uan Muhuggiag are elaborate rock paintings, mostly attributed to the later occupation period of around 5000 BP. There are more than 100 rock paintings on the shelter's walls and ceiling. The most notable of these are the Round Head paintings. They were named as such because the heads depicted were quite large, out of proportion to the rest of the body, and also very round with a distinct lack of features. Additionally, there was a painting depicting these figures inside a boat, which may have had a ritual or religious significance. One particular figure inside the boat was upside-down, whom Mori had interpreted as being dead. Some rock art depicted cattle with herders and running hunters. There was also a painting of two oxen that was found on a rock which had detached from the wall above. The stratigraphic layer confirmed the painting to date from about 4700 BP. This provided conclusive evidence that the inhabitants of Uan Muhuggiag at that time were pastoralists. = Animal and plant remains = Animal remains found at the site include domestic cattle, sheep or goat, wild cat, wild donkey, warthog, gazelle, hare, baboon, and turtle. Domestic cattle bones were also found in the lowest layers and perhaps date from the 8th millennium BP, providing some of the earliest known evidence of pastoralism in the Sahara. Sheep and goats appear more frequently among the faunal remains in the middle layers, dated to be roughly between 5300 and 6000 BP. It has been surmised that this was probably the time period when the shelter was most actively occupied. Fruits and plant seeds were also found. There were over 30 different species of plant seeds found during the 1982 excavations by Barich, including millet and wild melon. The seeds spanned a long period of time, with the most recent being 3 date seeds that were radiocarbon dated to 2130 BP, suggesting that the shelter continued to be intermittently inhabited even after the period of main occupation and subsequent drought. = Other finds = The pottery at Uan Muhuggiag was found mainly in the top layers. It is of the dotted wavy-line variety, as was common in the region during that period. There is evidence that a two-toothed tool was used in order to create equal spacing between the dots, known as the \\"return\\" technique. Other finds at Uan Muhuggiag include two hemispherical hollows dug out of the rock, measuring approximately 30 to 40 centimeters, called \\"kettles\\". These were found completely covered by deposits and are estimated to be from at least 7500 BP. Several pieces of charcoal were also found, the oldest of which were determined to be 7800 years old. They were probably used in large fireplace pits. The lower levels also uncovered backed and microlithic tools, while lithics such as flakes and arrowheads were found in the upper layers. A total of 406 stone tool fragments were found in level 2a, and 77 in the earliest occupation level of 2d.  Palaeoenvironment  Uan Muhuggiag was inhabited during the early- to mid-Holocene in what has been termed as the African Aqualithic culture complex, or \\"Green Sahara\\" period. Analysis of pollen found at the base levels of the site dating to between 7500 and 5000 BC indicate a wet savannah. Extensive samples from a number of sites indicate that tropical humid plants began to expand northward around 12,000 years ago after a lengthy dry period, eventually reaching deep into what is today the Sahara Desert. Recently, NASA satellites have been able to detect a vast network of ancient river beds and paleolakes underneath the sand dunes around Uan Muhuggiag. Rock art findings depicting elephants, giraffes, and crocodiles were discovered at sites surrounding Uan Muhuggiag. Furthermore, fish bones, fish hooks and harpoons were found at several sites in the Sahara region. It is speculated that the dry period that continues into the present day began around 5000 BP, which led to the abandonment of the site.  Significance  Antonio Ascenzi, a pathologist, believes that Uan Muhuggiag and the surrounding area became inhabited around 10,000 BP by Negroid peoples, who followed the monsoon north. Some time later, around 7000 BP, it has been suggested that people from Mesopotamia and the Middle East arrived, introducing pastoralism to the region. There is strong evidence that domestic livestock, principally cattle, played an important role in the lives of the inhabitants of Uan Muhuggiag. This is supported by the number of cattle bones found at the site itself, as well as evidence of a cattle cult and ritual sacrifice at a location in the Messak plateau, just 60 miles away. The Tashwinat Mummy found at Uan Muhuggiag was 1000 years older than the oldest known Egyptian mummy, and its sophisticated form of evisceration indicates a highly advanced society. Some scholars argue that the sub-Saharan African population living there could have had an influence on the later process of mummification of Ancient Egypt. There is also considerable debate about whether the rock art found at Uan Muhuggiag, along with the two dead bodies, signify that the shelter was a burial place or otherwise sacred. Mori himself had been a strong advocate of this theory and believed that the site was a place where a cult of the dead took place.

Biography Gowland was born in Spennymoor, County Durham. He started work as a sailor and later became the mate on a ship. For several years from the age of 25 he went to South Africa, where he hunted for big game, prospected for diamonds and also organised a theatrical company in Johannesburg, and acted in it. He prospected in Canada, where he made his debut on the legitimate stage. Gowland went to the United States from Britain by way of Canada in 1913 where he met Beatrice Bird, also from Great Britain, whom he married. They moved to Hollywood, working as bit players. In 1914 he acted in D.W. Griffith's Birth of a Nation, followed by Intolerance. In 1916, his son, actor and photographer Peter Gowland, was born. Often cast as a villain, his only starring role (out of 63 films) was in Greed (1924), directed by Erich von Stroheim, based on the Frank Norris novel McTeague, and costarring ZaSu Pitts. The film has become a classic despite its having been cut to one-fifth its original length for commercial release by MGM. Gowland portrayed the protagonist, dentist John McTeague. Von Stroheim also directed Gowland in his 1919 film Blind Husbands. Gowland was cast as Simon Buquet in the 1925 film version of The Phantom of the Opera. He had bit parts in dozens of films from 1938 to 1945, but was rarely credited on-screen. After two divorces, Gowland returned to England in 1944. He died in London at the age of 74 and is buried in Golders Green Crematorium.

He contributed to the creation and success of Hara-Kiri and Charlie Hebdo. He wrote in a variety of genres including reportage, satire, essays, novels, autobiography and humor. He also translated six books about famous cartoonists. Cavanna was born in Nogent-sur- Marne. Although raised in France, he grew up surrounded by Italian immigrants due to his father being from Bettola, Italy. He treated this life in his books Les Ritals and L'≈ìil du lapin. At the age of 16, he took up various part-time jobs. He delivered letters for the postal service, sold fruits and vegetables, and was a mason's apprentice. His journalistic d√©but came in 1945 when he began to work for the daily Lib√©ration. In November 1969, Hara-Kiri's sister weekly magazine was banned . Cavanna came up with the idea of renaming the magazine for the next week's issue, and thus, Charlie Hebdo was born.Fran√ßois Cavanna ‚Äì Evene.fr Later, he turned to autobiographical writing. Les Ritals, dealt with his childhood, while Les Russkoffs (and later Maria) treated his experience in World War II. Les Russkoffs was the novel for which he won the Prix Interalli√© in 1979. In B√™te et m√©chant and Les yeux plus grands que le ventre he tells his hilarious experiences in Hara-Kiri and Charlie Hebdo.

It is one of Munich's four principal orchestras, along with the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra, the Munich Radio Orchestra and the Bavarian State Orchestra. Since 1985, the orchestra has been housed in the Gasteig culture centre. History = Foundation = The orchestra was founded in Munich in 1893 by Franz Kaim, son of a piano manufacturer, as the Kaim Orchestra. In 1895, it took up residence in the city's Tonhalle (concert hall). It soon attracted distinguished conductors: Gustav Mahler first directed the group in 1897 and premiered his Symphony No. 4 and Symphony No. 8 with the orchestra, while Bruno Walter directed the orchestra for the posthumous premiere of Mahler's Das Lied von der Erde. Felix Weingartner was music director from 1898 to 1905, and the young Wilhelm Furtw√§ngler made his auspicious conducting debut there in 1906. Meanwhile, Anton Bruckner pupil Ferdinand L√∂we established an enduring tradition of Bruckner performance which continues to this day. = The World Wars = Up until this time the orchestra, which by 1910 was known as the Munich Konzertverein Orchestra, was privately funded, but during World War I finances became tight and players were called for military service, forcing the orchestra to cease operation. After the war, the orchestra was taken over by the City of Munich and restarted under the leadership of composer Hans Pfitzner, soon replaced by Bruckner pioneer Siegmund von Hausegger. In 1928, the orchestra acquired its current name. After the rise of the Nazi party in 1933, the orchestra stamped its scores with swastikas and the words \\"The Orchestra of the Fascist Movement\\". (The swastikas weren‚Äôt removed until the early 1990s.) In 1938, the pro-Nazi conductor Oswald Kabasta became chief conductor, raising its musical standards even as World War II began. During the war, the Tonhalle was destroyed and the orchestra, homeless, was again shut-down for a period. After the war, fortunes recovered under the music directors Hans Rosbaud and Rudolf Kempe and in 1979, Sergiu Celibidache took over, raising the orchestra to the highest world-class standards. Notoriously demanding of his players, Celibidache created a unique sound for the orchestra. = Munich vs. Conant = In a well-publicised case, Celibidache tried to remove principal trombonist Abbie Conant from her position because of her gender, and paid her less than her male colleagues without her knowledge. The City of Munich, the Philharmonic's owner, complained > The plaintiff does not possess the necessary physical strength to be a > leader of the trombone section; she is not in the position to clearly lead > the trombone group.

Levine was terminated in 2004, following sexual misconduct allegations, which he denied. Christian Thielemann became the orchestra's music director in September 2004, joined by Wouter Hoekstra as Intendant. However, in 2007, Hoekstra was dismissed from his post after reported disputes with Thielemann. In 2009, the orchestra announced the scheduled conclusion of Thielemann's tenure in 2011. Thielemann's demand to have a say over the choice of guest conductors was not approved. In March 2010, Lorin Maazel was named the orchestra's next chief conductor, effective with the 2012‚Äì2013 season. Early in 2014, Maazel cancelled concert engagements as a result of ill health. Subsequently, in June 2014, he announced his resignation as music director of the Munich Philharmonic, with immediate effect. In January 2013, the orchestra announced the appointment of Valery Gergiev as its next principal conductor as of 2015, with an initial contract through 2020. Over the course of its history, the Munich Philharmonic has performed premieres of G√ºnter Bialas, Anton Bruckner, Harald Genzmer, Luigi Nono, Gustav Mahler and others.

McCreesh was one of the ten Irish republicans who died in the 1981 Irish hunger strike in the Maze Prison.Two Lives and Two Deaths for Ireland Guardian Background Raymond Peter McCreesh, the seventh in a family of eight children, was born in St Malachy's Park, Camlough, on 25 February 1957.\\"Francis Hughes and Raymond McCreesh\\". Republican News. 26 October 2011. He was born into a strong Irish republican family, and was active in the republican movement from the age of 16. McCreesh attended the local primary school in Camlough, St Malachy's, and later attended St Colman's College in Newry. Raymond first joined Fianna √âireann, the IRA's youth wing, in 1973, and later that year he progressed to join the Provisional IRA South Armagh Brigade. McCreesh had worked for a short time as steelworker in a predominately Protestant factory in Lisburn. However, as sectarian threats and violence escalated, he switched professions to work as a milk roundsman in his local area of South Armagh: an occupation which greatly increased his knowledge of the surrounding countryside, as well as enabling him to observe the movements of British Army patrols in the area. Arrest On 25 June 1976, McCreesh (aged 19) and three other IRA volunteers attempted to ambush a British Army observation post (OP) in South Armagh. It lay opposite the Mountain House Inn, on the Newry‚ÄìNewtonhamilton Road. As the armed, masked and uniformed IRA volunteers approached the OP, they were spotted by British paratroopers on a hillside. The paratroopers opened fire on the volunteers, who scattered. Two of them, McCreesh and Paddy Quinn, took cover in a nearby farmhouse. The paratroopers surrounded the house and fired a number of shots into the building.McKittrick, David. Lost Lives: The Stories of the Men, Women, and Children who Died as a Result of the Northern Ireland Troubles. Mainstream, 1999. p.863 After some time, McCreesh and Quinn surrendered and were taken to Bessbrook British Army base. The third volunteer, Danny McGuinness, had taken cover in a disused quarry outhouse but was captured the next day. The fourth member of the unit managed to escape despite being shot in the leg, arm and chest. Local Catholic priests facilitated their surrender.McFate, Montgomery (2014).

The British Army in Northern Ireland. Guild Publishing. Imprisonment and hunger strike On 2 March 1977, McCreesh and Quinn were sentenced to fourteen years in prison for the attempted murder of British soldiers, possession of a rifle and ammunition, and a further five years for IRA membership. The rifle that McCreesh had in his possession when captured was one of those used in the Kingsmill massacre on 5 January 1976, when 10 Protestant civilians were shot dead.\\"Equality Commission to investigate play park IRA man naming\\". BBC News, 7 March 2013. McCreesh was sent to the Maze Prison. He joined the blanket protest and took part in the 1981 Irish hunger strike. He died on 21 May, after 61 days on hunger strike. McCreesh's gravestone One of the soldiers who captured McCreesh, Lance Corporal David Jones, was later killed by Francis Hughes, who died during the same hunger strike. Raymond McCreesh Park A Newry playground was named after McCreesh after a motion led by Sinn F√©in, SDLP and independent representatives on Newry and Mourne District Council was passed. Unionists were unhappy with this and appealed to the Equality Commission which called for an equality impact assessment in 2008. The council sub-committee responsible for the assessment decided that naming the park after McCreesh complies with their legal requirement to \\"promote equality of opportunity and good relations between persons of different religious belief and political opinion\\". In 2013, it was announced that the decision to name the park after McCreesh would be formally investigated by the Equality Commission for Northern Ireland. It said its investigation would consider whether the council had failed to have due regard to the need to promote equality and good relations between people of different religious beliefs and political opinion.

Life and career Leonard Rosenman was born in Brooklyn, New York, United States. His parents, Julius and Rose n√©e Kantor, were Jewish immigrants from Poland. He had a younger brother named Paul. After service in the Pacific with the United States Army Air Forces in World War II, Rosenman earned a bachelor's degree in music from the University of California, Berkeley. He also studied composition with Arnold Schoenberg, Roger Sessions and Luigi Dallapiccola.Fox, Margalit. \\"Leonard Roseman, 83, Composer for Films\\" The New York Times, Thursday, March 6, 2008 Amongst Rosenman's earliest film work was the scores for James Dean movies East of Eden (1955) and Rebel Without a Cause (1955). Rosenman had lived together with Dean, to whom he gave piano lessons, and it was Dean who introduced him to director Elia Kazan. Dean also lobbied George Stevens to let Rosenman score Giant, but Stevens preferred Dimitri Tiomkin. Rosenman remarked \\"The year I did my first film, I had five major performances in New York.\\" But \\"the minute I did my first film, I didn't have a performance there for 20 years. They would never say, 'I don't like them'. They wouldn't look at them.\\" He composed the score for Vincente Minnelli's The Cobweb (1955) regarded as the first major Hollywood score to be written in the Twelve-tone technique. His avant- garde music was used for Martin Ritt's Edge of the City (1956) and John Frankenheimer's The Young Stranger (1957). He composed scores for war films such as William Wellman's biographical Lafayette Escadrille (1958), Lewis Milestone's Pork Chop Hill (1959), Delbert Mann's The Outsider (1961), Don Siegel's Hell is for Heroes (1962), and the Combat! television series (1962). He wrote incidental music for such television series as Law of the Plainsman, The Defenders, The Twilight Zone, Gibbsville, and Marcus Welby, M.D.. He went on to compose George Cukor's The Chapman Report, then Fantastic Voyage (1966), where he rejected producer Saul David's instructions. Rosenman stated, \\"A producer asked me to write a jazz score, and I asked him why. He said he wanted the picture to be the first hip science fiction movie. I said that's a great idea for an advertising agency, but it doesn't fit the film.\\" He provided scores to science fiction films such as Beneath the Planet of the Apes (1970), the first animated adaptation of The Lord of the Rings (1978), and Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home (1986). In the 1970s, he composed Bass Concerto Chamber Music 4 for bassist Buell Neidlinger and four string quartets with a second bass. In 1983 he composed the score for Cross Creek, for which he received an Academy Award nomination. In 1995, Nonesuch Records issued an album of music from both East of Eden and Rebel Without A Cause, played by the London Sinfonietta conducted by John Adams. In his seventies, Rosenman was diagnosed with Frontotemporal dementia, a degenerative brain condition with symptoms similar to Alzheimer's disease. He died March 4, 2008, of a heart attack at the Motion Picture & Television Country House and Hospital in Woodland Hills, Los Angeles, California.

He is first introduced in the book Dragons of Autumn Twilight by Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman, in Chapter 1: \\"Old Friends Meet. A Rude Interruption.\\" They introduce him saying that he was half-elven, armed with a longbow and a sword and wearing leather armor. Character conception As with the other protagonists of this trilogy, Tanis's first appearance was during a role-playing game session in which Tracy and Laura Hickman, Margaret Weis and Terry Phillips between others, set up the basic storyline of Dragonlance. In the beginning, Margaret Weis had problems picturing the correct representation of Tanis. Tracy Hickman finally told her, \\"He's James T. Kirk of the Starship Enterprise.\\" After that explanation, Margaret had no more troubles while writing about Tanis. Dragons of Autumn Twilight concerns itself chiefly with Tanis's psychological conflicts. As Dragons of Winter Night opens, Tanis is intensely uncomfortable as a result of having spent too much time underground. The novel Tanis, the Shadow Years by Barbara and Scott Siegel takes place during the five-year period prior to the reunion of the Companions at Solace. At the request of an old, dying mage, Tanis travels into the mage's memory in search of the old man's long-lost love, to allow her to live on. Birth Two accounts of Tanthalas Quisif-Nan Pah's (Tanis' elven name) birth exist. Both agree that Tanis was born in Qualinost. The first account is the Chronicles Trilogy, which states that Tanis was a product of rape. It is also described in the first chapter of Kindred Spirits. The violent nature of his conception, the nature of his birth, and the choice of his mother to die from shock after her assault all influenced the way the elves regarded Tanis and shaped his developmental years. The second account of Tanis' origins is later presented in The Inheritance series. Here the story is elaborated on: his mother, Elansa Sungold, was originally kidnapped by Brand's brigands, however, she later fell in love with him, resulting in Tanis. At that time, Elansa was also married to the prince and so the prince tried to \\"rescue\\" her from Brand. When she refused to leave, he fought Brand and they both died. Pregnant with Brand's child, Elansa goes back to Qualinost pretending she was raped to protect her and Tanis. Early life The orphaned Tanis was taken in by his mother's husband's brother, the elf king, Solostaran. Solostaran raised Tanis alongside his own children, Porthios, Gilthanas and Laurana Kanan, Tanis felt isolated growing up as a half-human amongst the elves and was only really close to Gilthanas and Laurana, Tanis became romantically involved with Laurana who gave him a promise ring that pledged her to marry him, when Laurana's family discovered how serious Laurana's infatuation with Tanis had become they angrily confronted him as they did not consider a bastard half-elf a suitable match for an elven princess. This fight led to the end of the friendship between Tanis and Gilthanas, as Tanis decided to leave Qualinost. Tanis traveled to the nearby town of Solace where he began to work for the dwarven metalsmith Flint Fireforge. Tanis had met Flint years earlier when the dwarf had come to Qualinost to craft items for Solostaran and the two had developed a friendship. Tanis met Tasslehoff Burrfoot (Tas) when the light-fingered kender tried to steal one of Flint's bracelets. Tanis kept Flint from killing Tas and soon Tas was an inseparable companion. Tanis met Kitiara when he believed he was going to her rescue as she fought a band of hobgoblins, only to find she was toying with her assailants. There was an immediate attraction between the two and Tanis was soon involved in a romantic relationship with the fiery human woman.Cassada, Jackie (June 15, 2007). \\"Dragons of the Highlord Skies\\", Library Journal 132 (11): 54. Tanis did this despite the fact that Laurana still believed Tanis and her were engaged to be married. Through Kitiara, Tanis met her two half-brothers, Raistlin and Caramon Majere, and their friend, Sturm Brightblade. Together these seven (Tanis, Flint, Tas, Kitiara, Raistlin, Caramon and Sturm) formed a group known as the Innfellows and they adventured together for many years before finally separating for five years to go in search of evidence of the old gods of Krynn. Role in the War of the Lance In the first chapter of Dragons of Autumn Twilight, Tanis meets up with the companions five years after they had split to find proof of the true gods. He is their assumed leader. On his way into the Inn, Tanis meets up with Flint and Tas. They encounter Fewmaster Toede, who sets his goblins upon them. They fight them off, but are disturbed at their peaceful town of Solace being controlled by the Highseekers and the goblin patrols. When they get to the Inn of the Last Home, the companions discuss things. In short, none have found any proof of the true gods. In addition, Kitiara has left a letter saying she will not be there. However, upon assembling in the Inn, they encounter Sturm, who has with him two barbarian plainspeople, Goldmoon and Riverwind. The woman, Goldmoon, carries a Blue Crystal Staff, which Toede had mentioned to Tanis. An old man there also tells a story of Huma Dragonbane and the White Stag. Goldmoon sings an enchanting song, which just about starts a riot. The companions, now joined by Goldmoon and Riverwind, leave the Inn under Tanis's guidance to prevent capture. They travel to Darken Wood, from there to Que- Shu, and then to Xak Tsaroth where they encounter Khisanth (Onyx), who guards the Disks of Mishakal. Khisanth was the first dragon Tanis ever sees, as well as the first black dragon introduced in the Chronicles Trilogy. Upon returning to Solace, Tanis and the others are captured by Toede and sent in slave caravans to Pax Tharkas. They escape and flee with a party of elves to Qualinesti. Tanis is then reunited with his childhood sweetheart, the elven princess Laurana. Laurana is still in love with Tanis and wants to marry him. Tanis however rejects Laurana, telling her that he is in love with the human woman Kitiara. Later that evening, the Qualinesti Speaker of the Sun Solostaran tells Tanis and his companions how the Red Dragonarmy is about to invade Qualinesti and the only hope for the elves is for Tanis's group to sneak into the occupied fortress of Pax Tharkas, by way of the Sla-Mori, to free the slaves there. Such an uprising will delay the Dragonarmy long enough for the elves to evacuate Qualinesti. Tanis agrees to accept this mission. In the Sla-Mori, the companions encounter a great slug monster that melts Tanis's sword, when he was momentarily distracted by Laurana, who had followed them. Tanis was then given Wyrmslayer by Kith-Kanan, the ancient elven king who founded the kingdom of Qualinesti. Tanis then angrily rebukes Laurana for following them and endangering the mission. The companions enter Pax Tharkas and free the slaves. They do battle with Dragon Highlord Verminaard, who is slain by Tanis and Sturm with the help of Goldmoon. Afterward, the companions recover the Hammer of Kharas and give it to the refugees, who trade it to the dwarves in exchange for safe haven in Thorbardin. Tanis also begins to feel a renewed attraction to Laurana, who has become much more mature since leaving Qualinesti. However, Tanis again quarrels with Laurana due to his jealousy of her close friendship with the cleric of Paladine, Elistan, who Laurana is helping lead the refugees. Tanis leads the companions off to Tarsis, where the dragons attack. Tanis, Raistlin, Caramon, Tika, Goldmoon, and Riverwind split off with the others after being rescued from Tarsis by the Silvanesti elf princess Alhana Starbreeze, who forces them to go to Silvanesti with her to free her father, King Lorac, from the dream and the dragon orb. Tanis loses Wyrmslayer at this point. They enter the dream and most of them die (only in the dream, they live in real life). Tanis lives because of his love of Laurana, and Raistlin because of his ambition. From here they head to Port Balifor and then to Flotsam. Here, Tanis disguises himself as a Dragonarmy officer and is discovered by Kitiara, who has become the Dragon Highlord of blue dragons. He briefly had a relationship with her, then fled Flotsam on the Perechon with the others and sank in the Maelstrom with Berem, the Green Gemstone Man that is the target of Kitiara's secret mission. He finds himself in the sunken city of Istar, where he meets sea elves, particularly Apoletta, and Zebulah, who is a human whose magic allows him to breathe underwater and lives with the sea elves. The companions are sent to Kalaman afterwards. There Tanis meets up with Flint and Tasslehoff and learns that Laurana has been captured by Kitiara, who used the elfwoman's love for Tanis to lure her into a cunning trap. Tanis, Flint, Tas, Caramon, Tika, and Berem go to Neraka, to rescue Laurana. Flint dies on the way there, suffering a heart attack. At Neraka, the remaining group is captured and treated as deserters, but Tanis, seeing Kitiara enter into the city, takes a great risk and escapes from the guards, calling out for Kitiara's help. He falls into the charade of being her officer, and she accepts him up onto her dragon, however she does not see the others, so she believes Tanis is alone. He then makes an exchange for Laurana, offering himself. He tells Kitiara he will serve under her in Bakaris's stead. She accepts, and brings him to the meeting of the Dragon Highlord's to be presented to the Dark Queen though in fact Kitiara plans to betray Tanis as she has already promised Laurana's soul to the death knight, Lord Soth. At the meeting, it is revealed that Toede is dead, slain by the kender in their homeland. Laurana is then carried in by Lord Soth and roughly handled by Kitiara who presents the captured elf woman to the Dark Queen. Laurana remains defiant though and Tanis, seeing her courage and beauty, finally realizes it is Laurana he loves not Kitiara. Tanis realizes though that he must hide these feelings if he is to have any change of rescuing Laurana, so he treats her coldly, letting her think he is willingly serving Kitiara. Prior to the meeting, Kit told Tanis he would be presented before the Queen and could ask her for a favor in the form of escorting Laurana to the prison, after which he could sneak her out to the gates and free her. However, when Tanis kneels before the Dark Queen, he is so overwhelmed he cannot speak, and she commands him to present his sword before Ariakas, a part of the plan he did not know of. Kitiara insisted on him going, and on the way there Tanis convinces himself (barely) to kill Ariakas. However, he discovers a magical shield in the way; Raistlin, is present and breaks the shield, allowing Tanis to plunge the sword through Ariakas and kill him. Tanis then makes a grab for the Crown of Power which Ariakas wore; Soth attempts to take it as well. During the struggle, horns blare, creating silence all round the chamber. Kitiara calls to Tanis, telling him to bring her the crown and ordering Lord Soth to escort him to her. Tanis then tells Kit she will only get the crown in exchange for Laurana. Kit allows him to free Laurana, but Laurana refuses to go with him. Instead Laurana attacks Kitiara, stealing Kit's weapon and knocking the Highlord down. Laurana then pushes Tanis off the ledge when he tries to stop her from running off. This causes Tanis to drop the crown and a huge fight breaks out. Tanis chases after Laurana as she fights her way out of the temple. He finally catches up to her but then so does Kitiara who again offers to let Tanis rule alongside her and warns him that Lord Soth is coming to collect Laurana. Tanis refuses Kit's offer, telling Kitiara he will protect Laurana with his life. Kitiara then allows Tanis and Laurana to flee, and they escape Neraka. After the war In approximately the year 353 AC, Tanis takes Laurana as his bride and she bears a son, Gilthas. Laurana and Tanis have a castle near Solanthus. Tanis becomes a widely known and popular figure on Ansalon. So heroic was he in the War of the Lance he is proclaimed by the Knights of Solamnia an honorary Knight of the Rose, a rank normal knights must strive for years to obtain. He is presented with a breastplate by the Knights as well. The Medallion of Kharas and a green silk sash, from the mountain dwarves and Wildrunners, respectively, is also awarded to him. Tanis is summoned to Palanthas some three years after his marriage and is told of Raistlin Majere's plan to destroy Takhisis and take her place as head god of evil. In addition, he receives the news of Kitiara's planned attack on Palanthas. Tasslehoff Burrfoot travels to an alternate time line and sees Lord Soth killing Tanis in battle. Luckily, Tasslehoff intervenes and saved Tanis from Soth by convincing him not to fight. Tanis instead enters the Tower of High Sorcery along with Caramon and is able to save Dalamar from Kitiara, who is, at the time, mortally wounded. Kit pledges her love to Tanis here and asks him, in her words, to \\"keep him away\\". Lord Soth appears soon after. Tanis allows him to take Kitiara's body and finally breaks away from her, in heart and soul. Tanis and Laurana then become emissaries between Qualinesti, Silvanesti and the Knights of Solamnia. Their intent is to forge an alliance between them, a united front that would stand strong for years. At this time, Sturm's son, Steel, has gone to the side of evil and Caramon requests Tanis's help in bringing him back to their side. They manage to bring to Steel to the High Clerist's Tower, but he will not leave the Knights of Takhisis. Tanis then attempts to tell the people of this order of knights, but few believe him. Tanis later returns to Qualinesti in an effort to save his son from the elves, who have made his son the next Speaker of the Suns. He does not manage to achieve that, but he does manage the rescue of Alhana Starbreeze. Tanis is then forbidden to return to Qualinesti. The Chaos War Tanis is still continuing his struggle to unite the nations when the Chaos War descends upon Krynn. He journeys to the High Clerist's Tower and defends it from the Knights of Takhisis and the Tarmaks. He saves Steel Brightblade's life there, upholding the promise he made to the spirit of Sturm Brightblade. An unknown Tarmak kills Tanis by stabbing him in the back with a sword. The exact date is unknown, around summer, 383AC. Tanis is buried in the Tomb of the Last Heroes in Solace. Family Tanis is a half-elf. In his childhood (the first forty or fifty years of his life) he is raised in the court of the Speaker of the Sun, along with Gilthanas, Porthios, and Laurana. Gilthanas was once like a brother to him, but years of separation and several events have led to a separation between them. They are not openly hostile to each other, but they are far from brothers now. He leaves Qualinesti fifty years prior to the War of the Lance because he does not agree with the elves on various subjects. He is married to the princess of the Qualinesti Laurana Kanan (eventually disgusted with Kitiara after what she's done and deciding Laurana was the better choice) and father to Gilthas Pathfinder who takes over as elf king and led the elves to rebel in the fifth age against their human captors. Solostaran Kanan, Speaker of the Sun in the War of the Lance, is legally his uncle and, once marrying Laurana, a father-in-law. Gilthanas and Porthios are his brothers-in-law. Alhana Starbreeze, by marriage to Porthios, is his sister-in-law. Silvanoshei, son of Porthios and Alhana, is technically his nephew. Cael Ironstaff once claimed to be the son of Tanis, who Cael claimed had had relations with one of the sea elves. This is unconfirmed, though Caelthas once had a red beard similar to Tanis's. Appearance and traits He is about six feet in height, with a medium-large frame. He has tan skin, green eyes, and a red beard. His long hair is of the same color. He has deep, brooding eyes. Tanis is usually calm and honest. He seldom lies, only when imperative to his survival. Caramon Majere respects him greatly. Tanis has never completed the elven rite of adulthood. The languages he can speak are Camptalk, Qualinesti and Silvanesti elven, a little dwarven, and even goblin. Of course, he also speaks Common. His red beard is a cause, initially, of enmity between him and Gilthanas Kanan, who claims Tanis is \\"flaunting his human heritage\\". Tanis is a half-elf, a curse and a blessing. He can grow his beard and hide his ears in order to pass off as human, or shave and allow his ears to be seen to pass as an elf. However, those elves that know the truth about him call him \\"half-breed\\" and believe him to be less. A few elves don't care, among them Laurana. Humans who know of the half-elf heritage (few outside of the companions) seem to care much less than elves. Tanis states, \\"According to humans, half an elf is but part of a whole being. Half a man is a cripple.\\" Role amongst the companions Tanis is extremely skilled at fighting. However, he has taken on the elven state of mind that killing is wrong. He detests fighting, but whereas the elves believe that life should be preserved, Tanis believes that there are times when killing is needed, such as the battle with Verminaard. Also, Laurana, his bride, takes on a similar hardened stance even though she is a pure-blooded elf. This may have emerged from the sudden shock that she was given after she chased Tanis into the Sla- Mori. She went from elf-maiden to warrior in a matter of hours. Gilthanas, Tanis's cousin to some extent, seems also to have this state of mind, as does Porthios. Tanis is commonly mistaken for a ranger due to his lightly armored appearance and weapons of choice, though second edition Dragonlance game materials list him as a fighter (as his constitution score does not meet the ranger's minimum). He is an accomplished swordsman and a skilled archer. A notable weapon of his, the Wyrmslayer, was given to him by the dead Elven King Kith-Kanan. Tanis is a brilliant leader and tactician. His human companions often looked to him for advice, making him the reluctant leader of the group which became the Heroes of the Lance. Other media =Video games= Tanis appears as one of the player characters in Advanced Dungeons & Dragons: Heroes of the Lance. =Miniature figures= Tanis was included in Ral Partha's Dragonlance Heroes boxed figures set of lead miniatures. A reviewer for Dragon magazine felt that Ral Partha did a good job of matching their figures to the characters' descriptions in the books, and described his figure: \\"He reaches across his shoulder with his right hand to grab an arrow from his quiver. His cloak goes from shoulder to floor and is held by a simple clasp. Tanis is dressed as a typical ranger in leathers and fur-lined shirt and boots. The vest has a design worked into it, as does his dagger scabbard. The belt has a pouch attached. Tanis'¬ís face is finely chiseled with a neatly groomed beard, although he appears gaunt. His left hand clutches his bow.\\" =Dragonlance Movie= American television and film actor, Michael Rosenbaum is the voice of Tanis in the animated Dragonlance: Dragons of Autumn Twilight film. Reception Jason Heller, of The A.V. Club, notes that the group of adventurers are \\"led by a half-elf fighter named Tanis, a man torn between his human and elven heritages, because of course he would have to be‚Äîwho become enmeshed in a battle against the forces of evil striving to take over the dual-mooned, pseudo-medieval world of Krynn and rule it as only the forces of evil could.\\" Lauren Davis of io9 notes that while the heroes of the series \\"are searching for truth, each of these individuals is deeply flawed\\", and that Tanis \\"is consumed by his inability to fit completely into either the human or elven worlds\\".

The park is between Johnson Road and Donald Lee Hollowell Parkway and between the neighborhoods of Bankhead and West Midtown and immediately to the northeast of the neighborhood of Grove Park, of which a large portion of the park falls within the Grove Park boundaries. Westside Park at Bellwood Quarry will be a major green space project of the Atlanta BeltLine master plan. The park will have trail connectivity to the BeltLine, as well as the Proctor Creek Greenway Trail (Phase 1). On August 27, 2019, Westside Park at Bellwood Quarry received a major boost with the announcement that the Arthur M. Blank Family Foundation has awarded a $17.5 million grant for the project. The Blank grant will accelerate the development of parks and trails along the 22-mile circular corridor ‚Äì especially on the Westside. A portion of Phase 1 of Atlanta's Westside Park as seen in February, 2020. Facing North. May 2018, dense woods cover the area of what is slated to be developed during Phase 1 of Atlanta's Westside Park. Facing North. Bellwood Quarry, as seen in 2018 with construction of the reservoir and related infrastructure. Facing East. Status The land, which had been owned by Fulton County, was in a long-term lease to Vulcan Materials. On December 10, 2005, Atlanta Mayor Shirley Franklin announced a plan to acquire the lease and the land in order to create a park with a lake which would also serve as a drinking water reservoir. The plan is a portion of the extensive BeltLine project to construct a ring of parks, trails, and transit surrounding the core of Atlanta. The proposed Westside Reservoir Park is nearly twice the size of Atlanta's premiere greenspace, Piedmont Park. . Bellwood Quarry, as seen from the observation deck on the northwest side Looking west, the border to the Quarry itself is to the left of a field Another large field farther north of the Quarry On December 29, 2017, outgoing mayor Kasim Reed unveiled plans for phase one of the park's construction. The first phase will take about 24 months to complete. The cost of the first phase, which has already been approved and funded by the Atlanta City Council, will be approximately $26.5 million. Phase one includes a gateway to the park, a \\"grand overlook\\" of both the quarry and the Atlanta skyline, and pedestrian connections to the Proctor Creek Greenway. The following year, Mark Teixeira and a development team announced plans to build a mixed-use development, Quarry Yards, adjacent to the park. On September 6, 2018 the official groundbreaking took place for Westside Reservoir Park. Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms and others hailed the park as a new attraction for the city that will also become an economic engine for long-forgotten neighborhoods west of Georgia Tech. The promised 280-acre park has been a driver for new development on the city's Westside, a historically industrial area surrounded by generally lower income neighborhoods, that has seen a rush of real estate speculation since the Great Recession. The rise in development has stoked fears by residents of potential displacement from rising prices, particularly in the Grove Park neighborhood. The $26.5 million first phase of the park will include a new gateway entrance to the property along Johnson Road as well as new lighting, and pedestrian and bicycle improvements. Phase 1 of the new park is scheduled to open in the spring of 2020. Bellwood Quarry The former granite quarry, which closed in 2007, was a popular hang-out spot for local teens. The site was used as a location for the filming of the AMC's series The Walking Dead in summer 2010. It was also used as a filming location in season four episode 14 of The Vampire Diaries, a scene in Mockingjay Part 1, as well as the final scene of The Fundamentals of Caring. Most recently, (2016) it serves a significant role and is featured prominently in several episodes of the highly acclaimed Netflix series Stranger Things. During construction of the reservoir and the park, the area is closed to the public and trespassers will be arrested. A five mile tunnel was dug to access water and the reservoir began filling in April 2020.

Sometimes it can allow newer technologies that replaced the old to emulate them when running older operating systems. Examples * x86-64 processors can be run in one of two states: long mode provides larger physical address spaces and the ability to run 64-bit applications which can use larger virtual address spaces and more registers, and legacy mode. These processors' legacy mode allows these processors to act as if they were 16- or 32-bit x86 processors with all of the abilities and limitations of them in order to run legacy 16-bit and 32-bit operating systems, and to run programs requiring virtual 8086 mode to run in Windows. * 32-bit x86 processors themselves have two legacy modes: real mode and virtual 8086 mode.

She was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.  Career  Starting her career as a popular model in New York City in the 1910s, MacDonald moved to Los Angeles in 1917. She became one of the first women to produce films in Hollywood, and produced nine features for her company, Katherine MacDonald Pictures, from 1919 to 1921. MacDonald was among the top ranks of actresses financially in 1920, earning about $50,000 per picture from a contract with First National. She achieved the peak of her popularity between 1920 and 1923. From 1922 to 1925 produced by B. P. Schulberg.

In 1997 FEMA released its first edition of a commercial off-the-shelf loss and risk assessment software package built on GIS technology. This product was termed HAZUS97. The current version is Hazus-MH 4.0 (where MH stands for 'Multi-Hazard') and was released in 2017. Currently, Hazus can model multiple types of hazards: flooding, hurricanes, coastal surge, tsunamis, and earthquakes. The model estimates the risk in three steps. First, it calculates the exposure for a selected area. Second, it characterizes the level or intensity of the hazard affecting the exposed area. Lastly, it uses the exposed area and the hazard to calculate the potential losses in terms of economic losses, structural damage, etc. Although it was developed with the US continent in focus, the Hazus toolset has been adopted by emergency management organizations worldwide such as Singapore, Canada, Australia, and Pakistan. Description US nationally applicable standardized methodology that contains models for estimating potential losses from earthquakes, floods and hurricanes. Hazus uses Geographic Information Systems (GIS) technology to estimate physical, economic and social impacts of disasters. It graphically illustrates the limits of identified high-risk locations due to earthquake, hurricane and floods. Users can then visualize the spatial relationships between populations and other more permanently fixed geographic assets or resources for the specific hazard being modeled, a crucial function in the pre-disaster planning process. Hazus is used for mitigation and recovery, as well as preparedness and response. Government planners, GIS specialists and emergency managers use Hazus to determine losses and the most beneficial mitigation approaches to take to minimize them. Hazus can be used in the assessment step in the mitigation planning process, which is the foundation for a community's long-term strategy to reduce disaster losses and break the cycle of disaster damage, reconstruction and repeated damage. Being ready helps recovery after a natural disaster. As the number of Hazus users continues to increase, so do the types of uses. Increasingly, Hazus is being used by states and communities in support of risk assessments that perform economic loss scenarios for certain natural hazards and rapid needs assessments during hurricane response. Other communities are using Hazus to increase hazard awareness. Successful uses of Hazus are profiled under Mitigation and Recovery and Preparedness and Response. Emergency managers have also found these map templates helpful to support rapid impact assessment and disaster response. Requirements Although Hazus-MH itself is free, it requires the users to have ArcGIS with ArcView license level. In addition, ArcGIS Spatial Analyst extension is required for Flood Model. Furthermore, it currently is only available for use with ArcGIS version 10.4 (Current version is 10.6). As part of a major effort to modernize Hazus, a number of updates are in progress. In late 2014, an update was released to bring Hazus up to compatibility with ArcGIS 10.2.2 and Windows 8. Later in the Hazus Modernization process, new functional enhancements will be implemented in the flood module, and the underlying code of Hazus will be re-designed to align with current practices, enabling future development. Advanced analysis Mapping results from the Advanced Engineering Building Module (AEBM) for earthquake hazards Salt Lake Community. User community Hazus has a substantial user group community that includes a Hazus LinkedIn group and several Hazus User Groups across the nation \\"providing a network of HAZUS users, promoting and supporting the application of the FEMA HAZUS software for disaster mitigation, planning, response and recovery. This group is supported by HAZUS.org the independent on-line voice for the HAZUS user community and the ultimate resource for everything HAZUS\\".

The Junior School is at Sandyford Park and the Senior School is located in the neighbouring suburb of Jesmond. The school was formed in September 2014 by the merger of Central Newcastle High School, formerly Gateshead High School, and Newcastle upon Tyne Church High School. It is operated by the Girls' Day School Trust, an organisation which ran one of the predecessor schools, Central Newcastle High, pre-merger. History Newcastle High School for Girls was formed by the merger of the predecessor single-sex girls' schools, Church High School and Central Newcastle High School, which have had a strong reputation in the North East education sector for many years, with good reputations in terms of academic performance and ethos. Central Newcastle High School GDST dates back to 1876 when the Girls' Public Day School Trust founded Gateshead High School. The School moved to Newcastle in 1895, and it became known as Central Newcastle High School. In 1884, The Church Schools' Company decided to open a private girls' school in the North East which focused on a church-based learning environment. A high school for girls in Newcastle was established in 1885 and opened with 59 pupils. A new association was formed in 1925, and the school was renamed The Newcastle upon Tyne Church High School. In 2016, the school moved to new facilities on Tankerville Terrace which incorporated the former Church High building and a new purpose-built 3625-square-metre, three-storey block. The established Headmistress responsible for the move to the new facilities, Hilary French was dismissed from her post on the 16th of June 2018 following an investigation into her conduct where it was alleged that she had made dishonest expenses claims. She was arrested by Northumbria Police on the 20th of June 2018, interviewed and released pending further enquiries. In February 2019 a Northumbria Police spokesperson said that there was no update on the investigation into Hilary French. The new facilities on Tankerville Terrace opened in September 2016 Curriculum Newcastle High School for Girls has a strong academic record and regularly ranks in the top 5 independent schools in North East England and top 100 nationally. The Prime Minister's Global Fellowship Central Newcastle High School had a record of students attaining places on the Prime Minister's Global Fellowship programme.

It stars Robert DiPatri and Eion Bailey. It was produced in association with View Askew, Kevin Smith's production company, and released to DVD by Synapse Films. It was nominated for the Golden Starfish Award for Best American Independent Film at the 1997 Hamptons International Film Festival. In 2016, the film screened out of jury competition, in the director-curated block, but was chosen as the Audience Favorite Feature Film of the first annual Oil Valley Film Festival. Plot Barret Michaelson is an unwelcome newcomer in a public high school, often bullied by his new classmates. He has no friends until another misfit with a bad reputation, Ryan, saves him from a beating in the men's locker room. Ryan is a misanthropic existentialist with violent tendencies and a dark past. It is revealed that Ryan's father murdered his mother and then committed suicide in front of Ryan when he was only ten years old. The two become fast friends who spend much of their time together engaged in philosophical conversation, but their friendship comes to an abrupt halt when the two are involved in an incident with a local landowner who claims they are trespassing on his land. Ryan throws a rock at the man, causing him to fall and break his neck on a rock. The two manage to successfully make it look like an accident, but the incident forces Barret to pull away from his friendship with Ryan. This causes Ryan to become very emotional, and to purchase a black market gun. Barret soon agrees that they should put the incident behind them and continue to be friends, but Ryan becomes increasingly morose and attached to Barret. When Ryan suffers a brutal beating at the hands of the bully against whom Ryan had originally defended Barret, he is consumed by a will for revenge, and makes it clear to Barret that he intends to shoot the bully to death. Barret tries as hard as he can to dissuade Ryan, but Ryan says it's his \\"destiny\\" and insists that there is nothing Barret can do to stop him. As the moment of truth approaches, Ryan forces Barret at gun point to accompany him to the would-be crime scene. Ryan finds his enemy in a secluded area, smoking what is probably a joint (marijuana cigarette). Barret tries to warn him, but it is to no avail, and Ryan kills him. After the killing, Barret tries to incapacitate Ryan by hitting on the head with a rock, but it doesn't work. In a struggle, the gun goes off, claiming Ryan's life. Barret then shoots him once again, and tries to turn the gun on himself, but by that time the gun is out of bullets.

In 1954, he became the first Deaf African American to earn a bachelor's degree from Gallaudet University and the first to earn a master's degree from Eastern Michigan University. He soon earned a second master's degree from Seattle Pacific Christian College (now called Seattle Pacific University) also in education. He founded Christian Mission for the Deaf African in 1956 and eventually set out for Accra, Ghana, where he established the first school for the deaf on the entire continent of Africa.  Early Life and Education  Andrew Foster was born on June 27, 1925 in the small mining town of Ensley, Alabama. In 1936, when Andrew was about 11 years old, both he and his brother contracted spinal meningitis and subsequently became deaf. Following this, Foster was sent to the Alabama School for Colored Deaf in Talladega, where he received up to a sixth grade education. This was largely due racial segregation still being in effect in Alabama, with laws established that did not allow African Americans to receive more than a sixth grade education. In order to continue his education, Foster moved to Flint, Michigan in 1942, where he attended the Michigan School for the Deaf and was able to receive up to an eighth grade education. During World War II, Foster spent his days working in auto factories and restaurants, as well as attending night school, throughout Chicago and Detroit. It was only after WWII ended that Foster was encouraged by Eric Malzkuhn, a professor at Gallaudet University, to continue his education by applying there. However, he was rejected several times on account of his race. In 1950, he received a diploma in accountancy and business administration from the Detroit Institute of Commerce, followed by a high school diploma from the American School in Chicago in 1951. It was only after this that Foster was accepted to Gallaudet University with a full scholarship. He was the first African American to attend Gallaudet, graduating in 1954 at the age of 29 with a degree in education. He later went on to receive two masters degrees: one in education from Eastern Michigan University in 1955, and one in Christian Mission from Seattle Pacific Christian College in 1956.  Contributions to Deaf Education in Africa  Foster had felt a calling to be a missionary since his time at Gallaudet. He often visited Washington D.C.'s inner-city neighborhoods, where he would seek out young deaf African American children to serve as a prominent role model in their lives. Through this work, Foster realized his passion for giving black deafs access to communication, education, and the Gospel. In 1956, upon learning that there were only 12 deaf schools in the whole continent of Africa, Foster established the Christian Mission for Deaf Africans (now called the Christian Mission for the Deaf), a missionary organization whose goal was to bring education to every deaf African. He began his work in 1956 by convincing school officials to let him use their classrooms after hours to teach the deaf. After going on a series of speaking tours around America to raise funds for his cause, Foster landed in Accra, Ghana in 1957. Prior to Foster's mission, there were no records of any programs, schools or teachers for deaf Ghanaians -- there was not even a record of a formal signed language in existence in the region before Foster arrived. The cultures Foster encountered in his initial missionary trip were so oppressive to deaf people that parents often hid their children at home or abandoned them altogether if they were deaf. In Ghana he found a public school willing to allow him to use their facility after hours to teach the deaf, and after some months 53 deaf people joined Foster's makeshift program in Accra. This became the Ghana Mission School for the Deaf, the first school for the deaf in West Africa. Foster acted as the school's director until 1965, and during his time there he focused on expanding the size of the school and training individuals to educate his students. By the end of Foster's time directing this school, there were 113 students in attendance, with a waiting list of over 300. As the deaf began to become literate, Foster would supplement their education with trade skills and the Gospel. Foster also convinced existing churches and missions to expand their ministry to include the deaf. The Ghana Mission School for the Deaf was not the only school Foster established. In 1960, the Ibadan Mission School for the Deaf, or the first Deaf school in Nigeria, was established, followed by two other schools in Enugu and Kaduna. Overall, Foster established 32 churches and mission schools for the Deaf in thirteen nations across Africa. Specifically, he was able to establish schools in Ghana, Nigeria, C√¥te d'Ivoire, Togo, Chad, Senegal, Benin Republic, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Congo Democratic Republic, Burkina Faso, Burundi, and Gabon. He established churches for the Deaf in Kenya, Sierra Leone, Congo and Guinea. He also established a training center in Ghana, which eliminated the need to train teachers overseas and instead promoted local staffing of schools for the Deaf. In total, Foster ended up establishing 32 schools for the Deaf throughout 13 African nations.  Personal Life and Death  In 1961, Foster married Berta Zuther, who was also deaf. Together, they raised five children -- Andrew, John, Tim, Dan, and Faith in Ibadan, Nigeria. Foster continued doing fundraising and speaking tours, as well as missionary work, around the world in the latter half of his life. In addition, he established and taught teacher-training courses in both English and French in several countries worldwide. Andrew Foster died on December 3, 1987, after accepting an empty seat in a chartered Cessna airplane going to Kenya that lost altitude and crashed near Gisenyi, Rwanda, killing all those aboard. On January 26, 1988, old friends and coworkers gathered at Gallaudet's Chapel Hall to celebrate and pay tribute to Foster's life. It was at this service that the National Black Deaf Advocates established an annual memorial award in Foster's name. There were also representatives of the \\"second generation\\" of Foster's students at Gallaudet in attendance.  Legacy  Foster's work establishing 32 schools in 13 African countries led to the governments in Ghana and Nigeria adopting and replicating his school systems on a nationwide scale. Additionally, Foster trained a group of deaf Nigerians to run his mission schools in the country. These group of people were coined the Deaf Nigerian Pioneers, and were recorded to have worked to sustain and enhance the Deaf education system throughout Africa. It must also be noted that Foster's dedication to teaching a signed language encouraged previously- running deaf schools in Africa, such as the Wesley School for the Deaf, to adopt similar methods. Ultimately, Foster's work allowed for the use of sign language to grow throughout Africa, increasing opportunities for children throughout the continent. Foster also changed the lives of many students, who have gone on to do great things today. It was due to Foster's efforts that Gallaudet began welcoming students from Foster's schools in Africa. One student of many who's life was changed by Foster is Seth Tetteh-Ocloo, a student at the Ghana Mission School for the Deaf who followed Foster to Gallaudet after completing his high school education. He went on to earn a master's degree in education from Gallaudet in 1965, as well as doctorates in educational psychology and rehabilitation from Southern Illinois University. He returned to Ghana to work as a rehabilitation officer for the country, and also founded Ghana's second school for the Deaf. As a result of Foster's efforts, Gallaudet University began accepting students from his schools in Africa, all of which have gone to graduate from University. Because of Andrew Foster's work bringing language and education to Africa, he is considered the \\"Father of Deaf Education in Africa\\" amongst members of the Deaf community.

Origin from Kailash Kund glacier Tawi River, Jammu Tawi river originates from the lap of Kailash Kund glacier and adjoining area southwest of Bhadarwah in Doda district. Its catchment is delineated by latitude 32¬∞35'-33¬∞5'N and longitude 74¬∞35'-75¬∞45'E. The catchment area of the river up to Indian border (Jammu) is 2168 km¬≤ and falls in the districts of Jammu, Udhampur and a small part of Doda. Elevation in the catchment varies between 400 and 4000 m. The flow of water in the river has been decreasing in recent years as the source glacier (Kailash Kund glacier) has been retreating.  Religious Importance It is a belief of the Hindus of Jammu city that the river was brought to Jammu by 'Raja Pehar Devta' to cure his father and was given the throne of Jammu City and was declared as 'Raja', i.e. King of Jammu with the blessings of 'Bawe wali Shri MATA KALI JI'.

In the PCA, the proteins of interest (\\"bait\\" and \\"prey\\") are each covalently linked to fragments of a third protein (e.g. DHFR, which acts as a \\"reporter\\"). Interaction between the bait and the prey proteins brings the fragments of the reporter protein in close proximity to allow them to form a functional reporter protein whose activity can be measured. This principle can be applied to many different reporter proteins and is also the basis for the yeast two-hybrid system, an archetypical PCA assay. Split protein assays General principle of the protein complementation assay: a protein is split into two (N- and C-terminal) halves and reconstituted by two interacting proteins that are fused to the N and C halves (here called \\"bait\\" and \\"prey\\" because a bait protein can be used to find an interacting prey protein). The activity of the reconstituted protein should be easily detectable, e.g. as in the green fluorescent protein (GFP). Any protein that can be split into two parts and reconstituted non-covalently to form a functional protein may be used in a PCA. The two fragments however have low affinity for each other and must be brought together by other interacting proteins fused to them (often called \\"bait\\" and \\"prey\\" since the bait protein can be used to identify a prey protein, see figure). The protein that produces a detectable readout is called \\"reporter\\". Usually enzymes which confer resistance to nutrient deprivation or antibiotics, such as dihydrofolate reductase or beta-lactamase respectively, or proteins that give colorimetric or fluorescent signals are used as reporters. When fluorescent proteins are reconstituted the PCA is called Bimolecular fluorescence complementation assay. The following proteins have been used in split protein PCAs: *Beta-lactamase *Dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) *Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) *Gal4, a yeast transcription factor (as in the classical yeast two- hybrid system) *GFP (split-GFP), e.g. EGFP (enhanced green fluorescent protein) *Horseradish peroxidase *Infrared fluorescent protein IFP1.4, an engineered chromophore-binding domain (CBD) of a bacteriophytochrome from Deinococcus radiodurans *LacZ (beta-galactosidase) *Luciferase,Fujikawa, Y. et al.

He was born in Nar√Æn√ß or Narinc (present-day village of Narince, K√¢hta) in what was then the eastern provinces of the Ottoman Empire (present-day Adƒ±yaman Province of Turkey). He and his family were involved in the failed Sheik Said Rebellion led by Sheikh Said. The ones apprehended were tried. Two uncles of him were hung in Diyarbakƒ±r while he was imprisoned. After his release he took refuge in Syria in 1929, where he got in contact of the leaders of Xoyb√ªn. While in Syria, he got to know many Kurdish intellectuals such as: Celadet Bedir Khan, Cegerxw√Æn, T√Ær√™j and Qedr√Æcan. After the establishment of Republic of Ararat during the Ararat rebellion, he tried to join the revolt, but he was again imprisoned by the British authorities in Mosul and Baghdad. Although he was freed in 1935, the British forced him into exile to Madagascar one year later in 1936. He went to Lebanon in 1937, and again became involved in the Xoyb√ªn and in the Kurdish publications in Beirut. He was employed by the French Mandate administration between 1944 and 1949, the year he was dismissed by the Ministry of the Interior. He also took part in founding the Kurdistan Democratic Party of Syria in 1957 and was elected as the secretary general of that party. Within the party, he was an adherent of the ideology of Mustafa Barzani. Due to his nationalist activities, he was arrested and imprisoned several times until 1972. Works He published many articles in different Kurdish journals, such as Hawar (1932), Ronah√Æ (1943), Roja N√ª (1943), H√™viya Wel√™t (in Europe, 1963), √áiya (in Europe, 1966), H√™v√Æ (Paris, 1983), Berbang (Sweden, 1983), Roja N√ª (Sweden, 1979).

Contemporaries often referred to the province as simply \\"Minho\\". It was one of six provinces Portugal was commonly divided into from the early modern period until 1936, although these provinces were not recognized as official units of government.  Geography  The coastline of Entre Minho e Douro is level and unbroken except by the estuaries of the main rivers; inland, the elevation gradually increases towards the north and east, where several mountain ranges mark the frontier. Of these, the most important are the Serra da Peneda (), between the rivers Minho and Lima; the Serra do Gerez (), on the Galician border; the Serra da Cabreira (), immediately to the south; and the Serra do Mar√£o (), in the extreme south-east. As its name implies, the province is bounded by two rivers, the Douro on the south, and the Minho, or Mi√±o, on the north. We can see some old maps showing areas south of the Douro River belonging to the old Entre-Douro-e-Minho territory, while other old maps make the province exactly match the current Viana do Castelo District, Braga District and Porto District. Nevertheless, if the name Entre-Douro-e-Minho (\\"Between-Douro-and-Minho\\") was strictly taken in account, the latter definition would make sense. There are three other large rivers which, like the Minho, flow west-south-west into the Atlantic. The Lima or Antela (Spanish Limia) rises in Galicia, and reaches the sea at Viana do Castelo; the C√°vado springs from the southern foothills of La Raya Seca, on the northern frontier of Tr√°s-os-Montes, and forms, at its mouth, the small harbour of Esposende; and the Ave descends from its sources in the Serra da Cabreira to Vila do Conde, where it enters the Atlantic. A large right-hand tributary of the Douro, the T√¢mega, rises in Galicia, and skirts the western slopes of the Serra de Mar√£o.  History  The separated municipalities of Gaia and Vila Nova were integrated in the administration of Porto city between 1383 and 1518. In 1936, when Portugal was divided into 13 official provinces, Entre Douro e Minho was split into Minho Province and Douro Litoral Province. This reform would make Minho Province corresponding exactly to modern Viana do Castelo District and Braga District. Minho's provincial chieftaincy was attributed to the city of Braga. On the other hand, Douro Litoral corresponded to modern Porto District plus four municipalities of Aveiro District, and two of Viseu District to the then new Douro Litoral Province. Douro Litoral chieftaincy was attributed to the city of Porto. Being seen as a trace of Estado Novo policies, the territorial definitions of 1936, though having innocuous and non-political characters, were erased in 1976 soon after the Carnation Revolution. Nevertheless, people still use the designations of 1936 on a daily basis because they more or less accurately correspond to the historical identity of the locals e.g.: \\"Minhotos\\", \\"Durienses\\", \\"Beir√µes\\", \\"Ribatejanos\\", etc., and many books and maps still show them.

It is situated to the east of Nottingham's city boundary in the borough of Gedling, approximately between Colwick and Carlton in the NG4 postcode area, and near the River Trent. The appropriate Gedling ward is called 'Netherfield and Colwick'. At the time of the 2011 census, the population of this ward was 7,398. History Anciently, it was the Nether, or Lower Field of Carlton in the Willows within the Parish of Gedling covering some , two roods and 19 perches. The ancient Nether Field was formed by the parochial boundaries and the effects of the eighteenth century enclosure of Gedling. The south-western boundary today is the Nottingham‚ÄìGrantham line, a branch line that follows the ancient course of the River Trent separating the Nether Field from Colwick Parish. The south eastern boundary is also an old water course of the Trent forming the boundary of the Hesgang pasture which, until recent times belonged to Radcliffe on Trent which is now on the other side of the present course of the River Trent. The north-eastern boundary is formed by the Ouse Dyke, separating Netherfield from the parish of Stoke Bardolph and lastly the northwestern boundary is now the Nottingham to Lincoln railway line. When in 1846 the Midland Railway Company opened their Nottingham to Lincoln line it formed the northwestern boundary of Netherfield as it was later known when it became a separate ecclesiastical parish in 1885. This line was joined by the Ambergate, Nottingham, Boston and Eastern Junction Railway line from Grantham and the Colwick Motive Power Depot (1869 - 13 April 1970). Covering an area, as today from the north end of Victoria Road just passing the crossings of the former Nottingham - Gedling - Daybrook line, the eastern end of Gedling up to Rectory Junction Viaduct covering an area, end to end of one and a half to two miles (3 km). During this time the population of Netherfield greatly increased from 60 in 1801 to 2,648 in 1891, with a further increase to 4,646 by 1901. Rows of terraced Victorian houses were built to accommodate them. These terraces are characteristic of Netherfield. After the closure of Colwick Depot the population did drop slightly due to unemployment and businesses closing, but began to increase during the early 1980s. Despite its small size, Netherfield still has its own Netherfield railway station. Carlton station is less than a mile away on the Nottingham - Lincoln line. The local schools are the Carlton Netherfield Junior and Infants schools. The nearest secondary school is the Carlton le Willows Academy. There is a large Morrisons store on Victoria Parkway near the A612 road. Netherfield was the target of Zeppelin bombing in 1916 during the First World War. On 25 September 1916, a zeppelin raid led by Kapit√§nleutnant Kraushaar dropped bombs in a line from Newark to the city centre. A single bomb was dropped on the corner of Cross Street and Dunstan Street obliterating six houses. The houses were never rebuilt and the site was used as a children's play park. In 2018 six new properties were built on the site and this is now known as Dunstan Court. Shopping Netherfield has a retail park called Victoria Retail Park which has a Boots, B&Q;, Argos, Costa, Frankie & Benny's, Halfords, TK Maxx, B&M;, Oak Furnitureland, Pets at Home, JD Sports, Next among others.

The west end of the village is magnificently sited around the scenic Falls of Dochart, the main street leading down towards the Loch at the confluence of the rivers Dochart and Lochay. The falls are crossed by a narrow, multi-arched stone bridge carrying the main A827 road into Killin. Killin railway station was on the Killin Railway. The railway station was officially closed on 1 November 1965. Killin has a small primary school with 56 pupils. For secondary education pupils travel to Callander to the south. The nearest Gaelic medium primary is in Stirling, to the south. History The MacNab Clan were once dominant here, and have long been associated with Killin. Their ancient burial ground is on Inchbuie in the River Dochart, just below the falls, and is visible from the bridge. Kinnell House was the seat of the MacNabs. A well-preserved prehistoric stone circle (possibly 'restored' to improve its appearance) known as Killin Stone Circle can be seen in the grounds of the house. To the north of the village lie the ruins of the Campbells of Breadalbane stronghold of Finlarig Castle, with its associated chapel. The growing power of the Campbells eventually ousted the MacNabs, who lost Kinnell House to their rivals. In 1694 Sir John Campbell of Glenorchy, 1st Earl of Breadalbane established Killin as a Burgh of barony. In 1949 Kinnell House and its estate returned to the ownership of the Chief of Clan Macnab, but in 1978 death duties forced the then Chief, James Charles Macnab of Macnab, to sell most of the estate.Know Your Chief at macnabclanuk.org, accessed 25 February 2012 The Killin incident of 1749 took place in August 1749 in the tumultuous aftermath of the Jacobite rising of 1745. Two men who had been plundering at will in full Highland dress after the Dress Act 1746 had made it illegal wear it, had been captured by soldiers of the British Army, but a large mob secured their release. In 1767 the minister of Killin, James Stuart, published the first New Testament in Scottish Gaelic. By the end of the 18th century there was a local linen industry. Flax was grown locally, spun in small mills and woven into linen by home based weavers. Today, Killin services the local rural community and the growing tourism and leisure industries. In addition to walking on Ben Lawers National Nature Reserve, fishing for trout and salmon there are various watersports available on Loch Tay. Many local vernacular buildings have been preserved or converted, allowing the village to retain much of its historic character. The 19th century Moirlanich Longhouse in nearby Glen Lochay is a rare surviving example of the cruck frame Scottish longhouse, and is now in the care of the National Trust for Scotland. The former Breadalbane Folklore Centre in the Victorian mill by the falls displays the 'healing stones' of Saint Fillan. Tomnadashan Mine, an abandoned copper mine overlooking the village is sometimes identified as the haunt of the Rabbit of Caerbannog of Monty Python and the Holy Grail fame. Nearby Glen Lochay is the location to which Richard Hannay, played by Robert Donat, heads in the 1935 Alfred Hitchcock's film The 39 Steps. Events The village hosts the annual Killin Music Festival in June of each year. The festival was relaunched in 2016 by a local voluntary team.

There are 291 properties and districts listed on the National Register in the county, including 9 National Historic Landmarks. Of these, 55 are located in the city of Bridgeport and covered separately in National Register of Historic Places listings in Bridgeport, Connecticut. Thirty-four are covered in National Register of Historic Places listings in Greenwich, Connecticut and another 34 are covered in National Register of Historic Places listings in Stamford, Connecticut. There are 169 properties and districts which are entirely outside those three cities or which span outside, and which are covered here in this list (Merritt Parkway is listed here as well as in the Greenwich and Stamford lists). All of the National Historic Landmarks are listed here or in the Greenwich and Stamford subareas. Forty-six of these here or in Greenwich or Stamford are historic districts.Forty-six are historic districts that explicitly include \\"Historic District\\" in their NRHP listing name. In addition there are other listings which are technically listed as historic districts because they include additional related buildings or other elements, in addition to a primary element that is the focus of the NRHP listing. Architecture addressed in the NRHP listings is quite varied. Of special interest is an unusual concentration of modern or International Style houses in New Canaan, Connecticut, designed by the \\"Harvard Five\\" architects, including: Landis Gores House, the Richard and Geraldine Hodgson House, the Philip Johnson Glass House, and the Noyes House. There are numerous bridges included in the listings. Seven are moveable bridges, including the Saugatuck River Bridge from 1884, the oldest moveable bridge in the state, and the Washington Bridge which carries U.S. 1 into New Haven County. Five are moveable railway bridges: the Mianus River Railroad Bridge, the Norwalk River Railroad Bridge, the Saugatuck River Railroad Bridge, the Pequonnock River Railroad Bridge (in Bridgeport), and the Housatonic River Railroad Bridge. One bridge is part of a dam and hydroelectric plant complex, the Stevenson Dam Hydroelectric Plant. Five bridges bring roads across shorter crossings: the Perry Avenue Bridge in Norwalk; the Main Street Bridge and the Turn-of-River Bridge in Stamford; the Riverside Avenue Bridge in Greenwich; and the picturesque Pine Creek Park Bridge in Fairfield. Also there are numerous bridges that are included in the Merritt Parkway listing, out of 69 original bridges of the parkway.

The theater is owned by the borough of Phillipsburg.  History  The site of the Rowland Theatre building was previously occupied by the Pierce Opera House. Owned by Philipsburg business man J.H. Pierce and built sometime before 1889, this three story building was destroyed by fire, along with several other downtown buildings, on December 30, 1910. Then the Rowland family purchased the Opera House property on December 31, 1915, and immediately began making plans for the construction of a building which could house live theatrical performances as well as conventions and public meetings. The theatre is currently owned by Philipsburg Borough and leased to Rowland Theatre, Inc. a 501(c)3 non-profit. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. It is located in the Philipsburg Historic District. = Charles Hedding Rowland = U.S. Congressman Charles Hedding Rowland, born December 20, 1860, was one of several enterprising businessmen who engaged in coal mining operations in the Philipsburg Area. He was president of both the Moshannon Coal Mining Company and the Pittsburg and Susquehanna Railroad Companies during the late 19th century. He was later elected as a representative of the Republican Party to the 64th and 65th Congress. His terms of office as a U.S. Congressman began in March, 1915, and ended in March, 1919. He declined a re-nomination in 1918, serving out his remaining term before retiring. = Construction = Construction then was carried out under the direction of architect Julian Millard, designer, with W. A. Hoyt, serving as the construction engineer. Planning began in 1915, with construction starting in 1916, and completed in mid 1917 After completion of the construction of the theater, Rowland released this statement in a brochure distributed to the public on opening night in June, 1917: ‚ÄúThe people of Philipsburg have long indulged the hope of a comfortable and commodious place of amusement and entertainment. For years we have had no suitable place for public meetings, entertaining conventions, or any auditorium large enough for the varied necessities of a community as large as ours. Such a building is a public necessity. The town needs it in order to keep pace with sister communities. Community growth would be retarded without such a public convenience. \\"I have felt that we should have a theatre building in Philipsburg of size, safety and perfection of appointment that would anticipate the future, maintain our best past traditions, reflect a progressive spirit, while affording us a place to spend a delightful evening at home. It is proposed to stage only plays and moving pictures of class and quality. I trust the people of Philipsburg, together with those who come from surrounding towns, may enjoy the playhouse now dedicated to their use and pleasure. I wish to take this occasion to say to the theatre going public that it has been a source of some gratification to have been the one permitted to open to the general public a place for its comfort and entertainment.‚Äù = Restoration Efforts = This section is being researched and will be available soon.  Architecture  The building itself is a brick and ferro-concrete structure measuring sixty-six by two-hundred-twenty-two feet in plan. The first story of the front part of the building contains the theatre's entrance way, outer lobby, and two commercial stores. A suite of offices is found on the second floor and a meeting/rehearsal hall and miscellaneous rooms are on the third floor. The second and third floors are not currently used, as they do not comply with modern fire codes in providing adequate fire exits. = Fa√ßade = As a whole, the fa√ßade is a symmetrical composition with classically inspired detailing. Despite the volumetric effects of the projecting marquee, recessed theatre and shop entrances, and bracketed cornice, the image is predominantly two-dimensional. However, the use of decorative patterns in the brickwork, contrasting color and texture of materials, and architecture ornamentation contribute to a masterful composition. Horizontal emphasis is provided by simple, bold lintels about the store fronts, a belt course at the base of the third story windows, a projecting cornice, and caps which line the top of the parapet wall. Vertical emphasis is given by the effect of pilasters defining the three bays of the first and second stories. A rectangular concrete plaque inscribed with the word ‚ÄúTHEATRE‚Äù and the marquee/theatre entrance defines a central axis. = Lobby and Foyer = The lobby of the Rowland theater houses the current box office and concessions, as well as the original box office, now used for minor storage. It features plate marble on the lower half of the walls, and murals depicting both Native American and local historical scenes on the upper halves. Lighting is provided by two large hanging fixtures. The foyer is large, expansive, and lavishly decorated. It features a stained glass skylight, crimson red carpet, marble plate lower walls and ornate cloth hangings on the upper walls. Two staircases, one on each side wall, lead upstairs, converging at the entrances of the main office and board room, and ending in a ramp up to the balcony. The restrooms are also located here, as well as storage for some concession supplies. = Main Hall = The main hall of the Rowland theater houses the majority of seating available. Approximately 1000 seats, as well as handicap-accessible areas, adorn the main floor up to the edge of the orchestra pit. The ceiling is vaulted where it meets with the steel support structure (a successful attempt to blend form and function, adding to the appealing look of the building), and once contained various ornate murals, which have since been mostly covered by white paint during restoration. Some original parts of the mural, as well as examples of restoration efforts conducted in 1930, have been left exposed. The frame of the stage is ornately decorated, and once featured similar murals to the ceiling (some examples are left exposed here as well). Still visible are original, hand-carved wood accents over the doors leading up to the stage's side areas. = Balcony = Only 18 and older unless with an adult. Decent love cushion seats. = Stage and Screen = The stage in the theater is fifty feet in width, thirty-four feet deep, and has approximately 50 feet of vertical space, with eleven dressing rooms in the basement below. The front curtains are motor driven, and three additional layers of curtains run to the back wall of the stage, giving it multiple depth options for stage productions. The screen is the largest movie screen in central Pennsylvania, measuring 29 feet wide and 15 feet tall. It can be converted to handle both Flat and Scope aspect films. It is suspended from the stage ceiling, and can be raised and lowered via a pulley system located offstage to allow for quick transition between motion picture and stage events. = Projection and Sound Systems = The Rowland Theater uses a three-tier platter system coupled with a 35mm projector. The projector itself supports both Flat and Scope aspect films via interchangeable lenses. Sound is provided by a Dolby SR Processor. Speakers are located on stage behind the screen (center, left and right channels), in the Orchestra Pit (subwoofer), and along the sides of the theater walls (surround channels) on both the ground floor and balcony.  Operation  The Rowland Theater is currently owned by Philipsburg Borough and run by the non-profit Rowland Theater, Inc. Its governing body consists of a volunteer Board of Directors, and it employs approximately eight full-time employees (management. projection, and cleaning staffs). Concessions and other jobs are staffed by volunteers from the local community, and volunteer hours can be used as credit towards a variety of local programs which have community service requirements. = Seating = The theater can accommodate approximately 1150 people total, and approximately 950 during normal operation. This is due to the seats in the back portion of the balcony being originals, and therefore off-limits to the general public. They can be opened when needed, but this hasn't happened during modern operation. = Ticket Prices = Prices for movies shown at the Rowland remain among the lowest in the United States. Ticket prices are as follows: *$6 - Adult 12+ *$5 - Children 4-11, Seniors 55+ *Free - Children 3 and younger = Stage Productions = The theater's stage can be used for a variety of events, including plays, choirs, and smaller orchestras. In front of the stage is an orchestra pit which can hold approximately 30 musicians and instruments. Minimal on-stage lighting and several spotlights, located throughout the theater's main hall, are available. A house sound system, separate from the system used for motion pictures, is also available.

In the stories where it appears, the defining quality of adamantium is its practical indestructibility. Etymology The word is a pseudo-Latin neologism (real Latin: adamans, from original Greek ·ºÄŒ¥Œ¨ŒºŒ±œÇ [=indomitable]; adamantem [Latin accusative]) based on the English noun and adjective adamant (and the derived adjective adamantine) added to the neo- Latin suffix \\"-ium.\\" The adjective adamant has long been used to refer to the property of impregnable, diamondlike hardness, or to describe a very firm/resolute position (e.g. He adamantly refused to leave). The noun adamant describes any impenetrably or unyieldingly hard substance and, formerly, a legendary stone/rock or mineral of impenetrable hardness and with many other properties, often identified with diamond or lodestone.\\"adamant - definition of adamant\\". Oxforddictionaries.com. Adamant and the literary form adamantine occur in works such as The Faerie Queene, Paradise Lost, Gulliver's Travels, The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, The Lord of the Rings, and the film Forbidden Planet (as \\"adamantine steel\\"), all of which predate the use of adamantium in Marvel's comics. History and properties According to the comic books, the components of the alloy are kept in separate batches‚Äîtypically in blocks of resin‚Äîbefore molding. Adamantium is prepared by melting the blocks together, mixing the components while the resin evaporates. The alloy must then be cast within eight minutes. Marvel Comics' adamantium has an extremely stable molecular structure that prevents it from being further molded even if the temperature is high enough to keep it in its liquefied form. In its solid form, it is described as a dark, shiny gray, like high-grade steel or titanium.Avengers (vol. 1) #201‚Äì202 (November‚ÄìDecember 1980) It is almost impossible to destroy or fracture in this state, and when molded to a sharp edge, it can penetrate most lesser materials with minimal force.X-Men (vol. 1) #139 (November 1980) The Marvel Comics character Wolverine discovers an adamantium-laced skull in the character Apocalypse's laboratory and says it seems to have been there for eons.Wolverine: The Jungle Adventure (1990) =As a key component= Adamantium appears in various Marvel Comics publications and licensed products, where it is found in: * Ultron's outer shell * Wolverine's skeleton and clawsX-Men #98 (April 1976) (w)Chris Claremont * Sabretooth's skeleton and clawsWolverine vol. 2 #126 * Captain America's second shield, alloyed with vibranium and steelCaptain America #303 (March 1985)Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe, Vol.1 #2: From Baron Mordo to The Collective Man (February 1983).

There are dozens of species and the delimitation of the genus has shifted much over time. These are mostly inconspicuous legumes; few have bright or large flowers. Though some can become sizeable plants, most are herbs or small shrubs. Their fruit are loments, meaning each seed is dispersed individually enclosed in its segment. This makes them tenacious plants and some species are considered weeds in places. They have a variety of uses, as well. Uses Desmodium intortum Desmodium triflorum Several Desmodium species contain potent secondary metabolites that are released into the soil and aerially. Allelopathic compounds are used aggressively in agriculture in push-pull technology: Desmodium heterocarpon, Desmodium intortum, and Desmodium uncinatum are inter-cropped in maize and sorghum fields to repel Chilo partellus, a stem-boring grass moth, and suppress witchweeds, including Asiatic witchweed (Striga asiatica) and purple witchweed (S. hermonthica). High amounts of antixenotic allomones produced by Desmodium also repel insect pests. Different Desmodium species produce different profiles of organic compounds through their root systems. The reasons for the production of these compounds that have benefited cereal crop production are however unknown, as they don't seem to serve any apparent function to the plant itself. Tick- trefoils are also useful as living mulch and as green manure, as they are able to improve soil fertility via nitrogen fixation. Most also make good fodder for animals including bobwhite, turkey, grouse, deer, cattle and goats. Some Desmodium species have been shown to contain high amounts of tryptamine alkaloids, though many tryptamine-containing Desmodium species have been transferred to other genera. The caterpillars of the lesser grass blue (Zizina otis) and the two-barred flasher (Astraptes fulgerator) feed on tick-trefoils. Deer also appear to rely on some species in certain areas, particularly during the more stressful summer months. Taxonomy and systematics Beggar lice seeds readily stick to many objects, such as this shoe The taxonomy and systematics of the many dozens of Desmodium species are confusing and unresolved. Related genera such as Codariocalyx, Hylodesmum, Lespedeza, Ohwia, and Phyllodium were and sometimes still are included in Desmodium.ILDIS (2005) Taxonomic authorities commonly disagree about the naming and placement of species. For example, Desmodium spirale as described by August Grisebach might refer to a distinct species, but its validity is doubtful. The \\"Desmodium spirale\\" of other authorities may refer to D. neomexicanum, D. ospriostreblum, or D. procumbens. Similarly, the plant originally described as D. podocarpum by A. P. de Candolle is Hylodesmum podocarpum today, but \\"Desmodium podocarpum\\" might also refer to D. hookerianum or Hylodesmum laxum, depending on the taxonomic authority. =Selected species= Species include: Desmodium oojeinense, Dietrich Brandis (1874): Illustrations of the Forest Flora of North-West and Central India. * Desmodium acanthocladum F.Muell. * Desmodium canadense (L.)

While the term \\"American primitivism\\" has been used as a name for the genre, American primitive guitar is distinct from the primitivism art movement.  Development  John Fahey used the term \\"American primitive guitar\\" to describe the style of composition he developed in his releases from the 1950s onwards. Fahey employed traditional country blues fingerpicking techniques, which had previously been used primarily to accompany vocals, on solo guitar, in combination with nontraditional harmonic and melodic material, similar that of 20th-century classical music, and later, the classical music of India. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, other musicians would become associated with the genre, including Leo Kottke, Robbie Basho, Bob Hadley and Peter Lang, who released recordings on Fahey's Takoma Records label. In recent years, some of the musicians of the genre have integrated new-age guitar techniques and have come to be broadly categorized into the New Acoustic genre. Potentially because the new age guitarist William Ackerman cited Fahey, Basho, and Kottke as influences, critics began to associate Fahey with new-age music. Fahey himself rejected any influence upon or responsibility for the genre, referring to it derisively as \\"hot tub music\\" and feeling that any association with New Age meant that he had failed as an artist.Lowenthal, Steve (2014-06-01). Dance of Death: The Life of John Fahey, American Guitarist (Kindle Location 1866). Chicago Review Press. Kindle Edition Peter Lang, a guitarist associated with the genre, described American primitive guitar, writing: \\". . . The New Age people call it Folk; the Folk people call it New Age, but it is really neither. It's transitional. The style is derived from the country blues and string band music of the '20s and '30s, however much of the music is contemporary. Fahey referred to it as 'American Primitive' after the 'French Primitive' painters, meaning untutored.\\"  Artists within the genre See also *New Acoustic Music *Folk baroque  References   External links  *John Fahey and American Primitivism: Nick Schillace's Master's Thesis *The Cosmos Club.

The dwarf Flint Fireforge is one of the six Heroes of the Lance. He is the second of thirteen children. He was born and lived in (for a time) the village of Hillhome. His ancient ancestor was Reghar Fireforge, a renowned dwarf. His parents' names are not known, but they are referred to as Mama and Father by Flint. Publication history Flint dies in the third book of the Chronicles series. Paladine, in the guise of Fizban, takes him to Reorx's forge, where he waits for Tasslehoff's passing. The novel Flint the King was the first collaborative work between Mary Kirchoff and Doug Niles, in which Flint uncovers a murder mystery in his hometown of Hillhome. Kirchoff imagined Flint's voice as a combination of Wilford Brimley and Yosemite Sam, and referred to Tasslehoff Burrfoot and Flint as \\"the Abbott and Costello of Dragonlance\\". The novel Kindred Spirits details the meeting between Flint and Tanis Half-Elven. According to author Mark Anthony, \\"¬ìFlint believes that there is something more to be had in life, though he follows many different paths in his search for that elusive something.¬î\\" Early life One day a Qualinesti elf messenger appears to Flint in his home in Solace. The Speaker of the Suns has recently purchased some of Flint's metalwork and is so impressed by it he wants more. He has asked Flint to come to Qualinesti in order to make some for him. Flint agrees to travel there. Tanis Half-Elven is residing in Qualinost when Flint arrives. He and Flint become friends almost instantly. Flint teaches Tanis some metalworking, and in addition he builds up a bond with Solastaran. Flint regularly returns to Qualinost every summer for twenty years. He owns a mule by the name of Fleetfoot. In 308 AC, on his trip to Qualinost, he is waylaid by a Tylor, and in their rush to escape Flint and Fleetfoot accidentally enter into a Sla-Mori (Secret Way) directly to the Tower of the Sun. He reports the attack to the Speaker and a hunt is organized to find and kill the Tylor. Flint and Tanis go on the trip to kill the Tylor, which they do eventually find, losing one member of their party to it and another of their members killing it. Upon further inspection, one of Tanis's arrows is found in the fallen elf's body, and Tanis is arrested. He was later freed in Qualinost. Blame is thrown on Tanis when Eld Ailea is killed. Flint is given the task of finding the killer because Flint doesn't believe Tanis has done it. Flint, after searching for days, discovers an elf named Miral, the slayer of the Tylor, is secretly Arelas Kanan, who has a plot to rule Qualinesti. Flint and Tanis stop the plot, and Tanis is free again. When Flint leaves for Solace again, Tanis travels with him, joining into the blacksmithing business. Flint takes Tika into his house for a time, after she is no longer with her parents. Tika is young at this time, and Flint often makes her toys. Otik eventually adopts her. Flint's fear of water and boats stem from an accident on Crystalmir Lake when Caramon tried to catch a fish with nothing but his hands. Caramon leaned over too far causing the boat to capsize. With the help of Sturm, Flint was pulled from the water. The accident disturbed Flint, causing him to shun travel across bodies of water in any boat of any kind. Flint travels along with the Companions to Karthay later to help stop the Minotaur in their efforts to conquer Ansalon. A half-ogre named Kirsig takes a liking to Flint, and Flint grows fond of her. When she is later killed by a Minotaur, Flint is very upset. During the five year separation between the companions, Flint goes to Hillhome to investigate the death of his brother Aylmar. During this time, he discovers the identity of his brother's killer and in addition, about a sinister plot by the Derro Dwarves of Thorbardin to destroy Hillhome. After heading to Thorbardin, he is caught and held captive by the Derro. After surviving a near death experience, he and a half-derro mountain dwarf Perian, are rescued by a colony of Gully Dwarves and are proclaimed their king and queen. Flint falls in love with Perian, who is later killed by the Derro and their leader Pitrick in the defence of Flint's home village Hillhome. War of the Lance Flint meets up with Tas and Tanis outside of Solace after the five year separation. They are attacked by Fewmaster Toede and the goblins, but they fight them off easily. They go on into the Inn, where they meet up with the others. The drunken Theocrat, Hederick, falls into the fire but is promptly healed by Goldmoon's Blue Crystal Staff. The companions are forced to escape with Goldmoon and Riverwind in tow, and set off on a journey that eventually leads them to Xak Tsaroth, where Riverwind nearly dies but is healed. Flint loses his battleaxe en route, along with his helm, but he steals a new weapon from draconians and Tas discovers in the ruins of Xak Tsaroth a helm that only fits a dwarf. He claims it has the hair from the mane of a griffon on it, but actually has horse mane attached to it (Flint being allergic to horse hair still claims it to be of griffon). Upon return to Solace, the companions, now with Tika and Gilthanas Kanan in tow, are captured and sent to Pax Tharkas as slaves. En route, Porthios leads an attack on the caravan and frees the companions, with some help from Fizban and his fireball spell, as well as Sestun, who breaks the lock. They go to Qualinesti and then traveled through the Sla-Mori to Pax Tharkas. There, they free the slaves and kill Verminaard, decapitating the leadership of the red dragons. He had to comfort Tasslehoff over the death of Fizban who saved him from an imminent fall. Afterwards, Flint, with the assistance of the dwarven prince Pike (also known as Arman Kharas) enters King Duncan's tomb and retrieves the Hammer of Kharas from its guardian Evenstar, a gold dragon. Following this, the Companions are staying in Thorbardin for a time before they depart to the city of Tarsis. Flint is a bit uncomfortable here, him being a hill dwarf amongst mountain dwarves, who, after the Dwarfgate Wars, have an instinctive dislike of each other. After this they journey to Tarsis to find a place for all the ex-slaves to live. The city is attacked when they are there, and Flint is separated from the others and wound up in Laurana and Sturm's group, which includes Laurana, Sturm, Tas, Gilthanas, Derek Crownguard, Brian Donner, Aran Tallbow, and Flint himself. While not physically present at Silvanesti, Flint is still involved in the dream that takes place there. In his section of the dream, he finds his legs growing weaker and weaker, finally he cannot move and is cut down by Tika, who kills him with her sword-swinging. The death is not real, but it shakes Flint up a bit. After recovering the dragon orb and defeating Feal-Thas, the group goes upon a ship bound for Sancrist. Flint gets extremely seasick on board, believing his death is imminent and he even gives his helm to Tas, which he wants him to have when he (Flint) dies. He is wrong, of course, his fear of boats getting the better of him. In the Tomb of Huma, Flint faints when he sees Fizban resurrected, then awakes later to find that Tas and Fizban are gone. He briefly reveals his concern for Tas when he shows genuine worry for him, but quickly covers it up with anger. Flint then travels to Sancrist with Laurana and Theros Ironfeld. After the Council of Whitestone, Flint goes with Laurana and Tas to the High Clerist's Tower. Flint fights bravely, helping to hold off the Dragonarmies, and eventually Laurana uses the dragon orb to lure the dragons into a deadly trap and scatter the corrupted draconians. Sturm, sadly, dies at the hands of Kitiara uth Matar. Afterwards, Flint, Laurana, and Tas go back to Sancrist. Laurana receives a promotion to General of the Whitestone Army, and Flint and Tas are \\"given\\" a dragon to ride into battle. Flint is horribly scared, but eventually Khirsah (Human name was Fireflash), the dragon, gets him on. In the following Vingaard Campaign, Bakaris, an officer of Kitiara, is captured. They liberate Kalaman later, being welcomed as heroes again on their return. Flint goes with Laurana to trade Bakaris for Tanis. However, Laurana is captured. Flint and Tas return to Kalaman. They meet the rest of the group there and travel to Neraka with Berem in tow. They have agreed to escort him there. Death and afterlife En route to Neraka, Berem runs away. Flint runs after him. On his way through Godshome, Flint's heart gave out and he has a heart attack. He meets Fizban, revealed to Flint as he truly is, and asks him to help him leave Ansalon. Fizban takes Flint to the black pool in Godshome and they disappear. Flint rests under a tree in the afterlife, somewhere near Reorx's forge. He awaits his friends there, for he is the second among them to die, after Sturm. Reorx mentioned him in the short story \\"Wanna Bet?\\" in the Book 2 of Tales I anthology: Kender, Gully Dwarves, and Gnomes as someone sitting at the tree near his forge to be annoying. After the Chaos War, his waiting is over; he is reunited with all his friends. He waited especially for Tas, his best friend, despite how it may have seemed in life. Role among companions Flint is proficient in battle axe combat. His trusty battle axe is his favorite weapon. He wears a helm with hair that he claims to have come from the mane of a griffon, although it is actually from a horse even though Flint has a \\"severe allergy\\" to horses. He wears medium armor. He is friendly with everyone in the group, with the exception of Raistlin (whom he doesn't trust), and Tasslehoff. Aside from being close in height, these two are nothing alike. Flint is old, ornery, cranky, and gruff. Tas is happy-go-lucky, for the most part, curious, and youthful in spirit. However, despite Flint's apparent hate for Tas, always calling him \\"you doorknob\\", deep down they are very close, almost as close as the bond between Flint and Tanis, perhaps even equal to that bond. He is a father figure to the group along with Tanis, and refers to everyone in the group as his \\"children\\". Appearance and traits Flint is roughly half the size of an elf. His arms, however, are nearly twice the size of an elf's. He has steel blue eyes and a black beard, which later turns white. He doesn't like heights and is deathly afraid of water and boats, following an accident in which Caramon nearly drowned him. He is also \\"allergic to\\" (scared to death of) horses and will sneeze incessantly in their nearness. He loves woodworking and metalsmithing. He speaks Common, Dwarf, and some Elvish, picked up from Tanis and understand goblinspeak. Reception Lauren Davis of io9 called Flint \\"the group's father figure whose crankiness serves as a bromantic foil to Tasslehoff's good cheer\\". The character of Flint Fireforge was listed in UGO Entertainment's list of \\"The Best Dwarves Ever\\". Other media =Video games= Flint appears as one of the player characters in Advanced Dungeons & Dragons: Heroes of the Lance. =Miniature figures= Flint was included in Ral Partha's Dragonlance Heroes boxed figures set of lead miniatures. A reviewer for Dragon magazine felt that Ral Partha did a good job of matching their figures to the characters' descriptions in the books, and described his figure: \\"Flint is clothed in a set of brigandine armor that covers him from his shoulders to just below the waist. The rivets and individual pieces are clearly visible as is the weapons harness that crosses the back and front. The helmet is horned and split slightly to allow for his hair. Flint has a detailed beard but is somewhat thinner in the body than I¬í'd expected. He looks like he is growling, and he is shaking his left fist. His right hand holds a battle axe. Simple boots, a shirt, and forearm bucklers finish his wardrobe.\\" =Dragonlance movie= Fred Tatasciore voiced Flint in the animated movie Dragonlance: Dragons of Autumn Twilight.

They are formed either by the long term presence and growth of tree roots or when a large tree is blown over or has its stump pulled out which tears out a quantity of soil along with the roots. The resultant hole will often slowly fill with organic material and can be identified during archaeological fieldwork.Darvill, T (ed.) (2003). Oxford Concise Dictionary of Archaeology, Oxford: Oxford University Press. . Fresh tree throws also provide a degree of shelter amongst the roots for animals.

Over time the hole will fill with rain water, fallen leaves, animal excrement and other organic matter which over time becomes a habitat for decomposers which soon form a community on the thick organic layer and so are able to nurture certain types of organisms.Clinton, Barton D.; Baker, Corey R. 2000.

The film was based on a screenplay by John Dos Passos, and stars Marlene Dietrich, with Lionel Atwill, Cesar Romero, Edward Everett Horton, and Luisa Espinel. The movie is the last of the six Sternberg-Dietrich collaborations for Paramount Pictures. Plot Summary The story unfolds amidst the festivities of Seville's Carnival set in the fin de si√®cle Spain. The events revolve around four characters ‚Äì there are no subplots. Concha \\"Conchita\\" Perez: a beautiful, piquant and heartless factory girl who seduces and discards her lovers without remorse ‚Äì an irresistible femme fatale. Antonio Garvan: a young bourgeois revolutionary, one step ahead of Seville's police. He is narcissistic, yet good-natured, and lucky with women. Captain Don Pasqual Costelar: a middle-aged aristocrat and Captain of the Civil Guard. His conservative exterior conceals powerful salacious impulses. Governor Don Paquito: A minor character. The despotic commander of Seville's police force, who is responsible for maintaining order during the festivities. Don Paquito is susceptible to the charms of attractive women.The Film Sufi, 2015. The film's narrative is presented in four scenes, the second of which contains a series of flashbacks. Scene 1 ‚Äì The boulevards of Seville are jammed with revelers wearing grotesque costumes, masks and parade sculptures. A detachment of Civil Guards stagger among the masqueraded merrymakers, bewildered by the ‚Äúriotous disorder‚Äù. A frenzied merriment prevails. Antonio Galvan mixes with the crowds, evading the authorities who pursue him. He makes eye contact with the dazzling Concha, who is perched on an garish street float. The coquette flees into throng with Antonio in pursuit: he is rewarded with a secret note inviting him to meet with her in person that evening. Scene 2 ‚Äì Antonio has a chance encounter with a friend of years past, Don Pasqual. The younger man, consumed with the image of the lovely Concha, asks the older gentleman what he knows of the mysterious girl. Don Pasqual solemnly relates the details of his fateful relationship with the young temptress in a series of vignettes. His tale is the confession of a man in thrall to the devastating girl. She subjects him to ridicule and humiliation, manipulating Don Pasqual in the manner of a puppet master ‚Äì to which he submits. His public prestige and authority is shattered and he resigns his commission in disgrace. Satisfied with her conquest, she flings him aside.Malcolm, 2000. Don Pasqual assures Antonio that any desire he has felt for Concha is utterly extinguished. He further exhorts the young man to avoid any contact with the temptress, and Antonio vows to heed his warning. Scene 3 ‚Äì Don Pasqual's cautionary tale has produced the opposite effect on Antonio and he keeps his rendezvous with enigmatic Concha. Alone together in a room at a club nocturne, Antonio confronts her with Don Pasqual's tale of betrayal. A handwritten note arrives during the interview ‚Äì a note from Don Pasqual declaring his undying love for Concha. She reads the confidential confession to Antonio, who responses by passionately kissing her. Moments later, Don Pasqual enters their private quarters, where his motivations for lecturing his young rival on the dangers of the devilish Concha are fully exposed. He compounds his duplicity by accusing Antonio of breaking his oath. Concha leaps to Antonio's defense and insultingly dismisses her erstwhile lover. Don Pasqual slaps Antonio ‚Äì a formal insult ‚Äì and a duel is arranged. Don Pasqual departs, after demonstrating his expert marksmanship with a pistol. Concha pledges to accompany Antonio to Paris after the duel. The suitors meet at a secluded location the following morning. Concha accuses Don Pasqual of threatening to kill ‚Äúthe only man I ever cared for‚Äù. When the duelists step to their positions, Don Pasqual declines to discharge his pistol, and is gravely wounded by Antonio's bullet. The police, notified of the illegal combat, arrive and arrest the fugitive Garvan. Don Pasqual is taken to the hospital. Scene 4 ‚Äì Concha, desperate to rescue Antonio, turns her charms on Governor Paquito to secure her lover's release from prison. Paquito grudgingly issues her two passports that will allow them to escape to Paris. Concha visits the hospital where the seriously wounded Don Pasqual is recuperating. She acknowledges her debt to her former flame for sparing Antonio's life; Pasqual spurns her, but she detects that he still adores her. Concha and Antonio make their way to the border crossing with France and pass customs without incident. The train will depart momentarily, and Antonio eagerly enters their carriage. Concha hesitates, then informs the station master that she is not boarding. When the shocked Antonio calls to her from the window of the moving train, she announces that she intends to rejoin Don Pasqual and she reenters Spain.

Don Paquito * Alison Skipworth as Se√±ora P√©rez * Cesar Romero as Antonio Galvan Production Notes When Sternberg embarked upon filming The Devil is a Woman, Paramount was experiencing falling profits and his latest and lavishly produced The Scarlet Empress proved unpopular with the public. The film was completed on February 6, 1935, and premiered without fanfare in March. Incoming production manager and director Lubitsch (replacing Ben Schulberg) announced that Sternberg's Paramount contract would not be renewed. In May 1935, The Devil is a Woman was released to general audiences.Baxter, 1971. p. 121, 128Swanbeck, 2013. The original title proposed by Sternberg for the film was Caprice Espagnol, a reference to Russian composer Rimsky-Korsakov's orchestral suite Capriccio Espagnol, of which several selections accompany the film. Ernst Lubitsch, studio manager at the time, subsequently changed to The Devil is a Woman.Baxter, 1971. p. 123 Sternberg later remarked, \\"Though Mr. Lubitsch‚Äôs poetic intention to suggest altering the sex of the devil was meant to aid in the selling the picture, it did not do so.\\"Sarris, 1966. p. 41 Approximately seventeen minutes of footage, including a musical number by Dietrich, \\"If It Isn't Pain (It Isn't Love)\\", was cut from the film, reducing the total running time to 76 minutes.Stafford, 2018 \\"If It Isn't Pain (It Isn't Love)\\" - YouTube, retrieved 18 April 2018: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAUdRXn7rGY Presumed to be a Lost film, a personal copy of the work was provided by Sternberg for a screening at the 1959 Venice Film Festival. The Devil is a Woman received limited circulation in 1961.Sarris, 1966. p. 41 Stafford, 2018. Reception On May 5, 1935, The New York Times surprised the studio with a remarkably positive review describing the film \\"as the best product of the Dietrich-Sternberg alliance since The Blue Angel.\\"Baxter, 1971. p. 128 The Devil is a Woman is the last of von Sternberg's seven quasi- autobiographical films featuring his star and muse, Marlene Dietrich.Silver, 2010. \\"a semi-autobiographical films with his star and lover, Marlene Dietrich‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Devil is a Woman is something of a translation of the Sternberg/Dietrich relationship into visual poetry and metaphor.‚Äù A box-office failure, panned by contemporary critics for its perceived \\"caviar aestheticism and loose morals\\", the film's highly sophisticated rendering of a conventional romantic conceit, left most audiences confused or bored.Lopate, XXXX, p.85: It was \\"...roundly attacked at the time‚Äù of its release. Sennwald, 1935. p. 85: ‚Äú...Hollywood expressed...violent distaste for Josef von Sternberg‚Äôs new film‚Äù and was ‚Äúdisliked by nine-tenths‚Äù of moviegoers. =Censorship: Spain and US Department of State= Upon its release, the Spanish embassy issued protests to the US government that led to Paramount's withdrawal of the film from circulation and destruction of available prints. The US State Department in a show of sympathy - and with Spanish and American trade agreements in mind - pressured Paramount Pictures to stage a private burning of a \\"Master Print\\" of the film for the Spanish Ambassador in Washington D.C. The diplomatic action was widely reported in Europe, but distribution of The Devil is a Woman continued at domestic and overseas theatres.Baxter, 1971. p. 128-129 In October 1935, Spain formerly requested that Paramount cease international circulation of the film. A portion of the complaint cited a scene that showed \\"a Civil Guard drinking [alcohol] in a public cafe\\" and depicting the national police, as buffoons, who appeared \\"ineffectual in curbing the riotous carnival\\" With US-Spain trade agreements in the balance, studio head Adolph Zukor \\"agreed to suppress the film\\" and prints were recalled in November 1935. Sternberg's feature was marked as a film maudit (a cursed film) for many years. The movie was subsequently outlawed in Francoist Spain.Baxter, 1971. p. 129Sarris, 1966. p. 42 Critical Response The Devil is a Woman, in its \\"worldly attitude toward the follies of romantic infatuation\\" makes a mockery of Hollywood's standard plot devices that prevailed up to that time.Sennwald, 1935. p. 85: Sternberg‚Äôs film ‚Äúmakes a cruel and mocking assault upon the romantic sex motif which Hollywood has been gravely celebrating all these years.‚Äù Lopate, 2006, p. 85 Sternberg acknowledged that it was \\"my last and most unpopular of this series\\", but Dietrich herself cherished The Devil is a Woman as her favorite collaboration with Sternberg.Sarris, 1966. p. 41 Silver, 2010. ‚ÄúDietrich steadfastly maintained it was her favorite of the films they made together...‚Äù Ostensibly a light romance, the story examines that fate of a self-respecting and urbane older gentleman who foolishly falls in love with a beautiful woman indifferent to his adoration - and suffers for his passion. Sternberg's \\"grisly\\" tale is also a precise, unadorned and \\"heartless parable of man‚Äôs eternal humiliation in the sex struggle.\\"Sennwald, 1935. p. 86 Dietrich, as a \\"devilish\\" and \\"devastating\\" Spanish joie de vivre, brandishes her cruelty with the rejoinder \\"If you really loved me, you would have killed yourself\\".Sarris, 1966. p. 41; Sennwald, 1935. p. 84 The horror and pathos of his figure is that of a man in thrall to a woman who has no intention of satisfying his desires, and who perversely ‚Äúderives amusement from his own suffering.‚ÄùSarris, 1966. p. 42 Andre Sennwald, daily reviewer at The New York Times in 1935, defended Sternberg, calling the movie \\"one of the most sophisticated ever produced in America\\" and praising its \\"sly urbanity\\" and \\"the striking beauty of its settings and photography.\\"Sennwald, 1935. p. 85 Museum of Modern Art film curator Charles Silver regards The Devil is a Woman as a veiled confessional of Sternberg's complex relationship with Dietrich. The leading male protagonists bear a striking physical resemblance to the director.Silver, 2010: The film is ‚Äúsomething of a translation of the Sternberg/Dietrich relationship‚Äù and ‚Äúmany observers have commented on the obvious physical similarity between Sternberg and his two male protagonists.‚Äù Sarris, 1966. p. 40 ‚Äú[N]ever before has Sternberg seemed as visible in the [character of Don Pasqual], the morose figure of failure and folly.‚Äù Sternberg leaves the interpretation of Deitrich's Concha a mystery: \\"One of the most beautifully realized enigmas in the history of cinema.\\"Silver, 2010: \\"If Sternberg is any closer to understanding Dietrich [in The Devil is a Woman], he is unwilling to solve the puzzle for the audience.\\" Sternberg's attitude towards his male protagonists is less ambiguous. Both the pathetic old Don Pasqual, and the virile young Antonio, are regarded more with irony and less with sympathy: each are \\"symbols of the endless futility of passion...[t]hey are the last lovers Sternberg postulated for Dietrich‚Äôs screen incarnation and their absurdity only marks the death of desire.\\"Sennwald, 1935. p. 86 Sarris, 1966. p. 41 ‚Äú...Atwill (Don Pasqual) and Romero (Antonio) are far from being inadequate for Sternberg‚Äôs ironies. They play fools, but not foolishly. Film critic Andrew Sarris described The Devil is a Woman as the \\"coldest\\" of Sternberg's films in its uncompromising, yet humorously cynical, appraisal of romantic self-deception. This, despite the film's \\"sumptuous surface\\".Sarris, 1966. p. 41 Silver remarks upon the film's \\"diamond-like hardness\\", where romanticism is trumped by \\"cynical introspection and fatalism\\".Silver, 2010Sennwald, 1935. p. 85 On Dietrich's character, Concha Perez, Cecelia Ager, film critic for Variety was \\"particularly lucid on the subject\\": Sarris summed up the film this way: \\"Sternberg did not know it at the time, but his sun was setting, and it has never really risen again...Still, as a goodbye to Dietrich, The Devil is Woman is a more gallant gesture to one's once beloved than Orson Welles‚Äô murderous adieu to Rita Hayworth in The Lady From Shanghai.\\"Sarris, 1966. P. 42 Awards and honors The film won the Award for Best Cinematography at the Venice Film Festival in 1935.  References   Sources  *Malcolm, Derek. 2000.

Groody, 361 F.3d 232 (3d Cir. 2004) lawsuit concerned a strip- search of a 10-year-old girl and her mother despite the fact that neither were criminal suspects nor named in any search warrant. In applying for a search warrant, officers requested the right to search whoever was in the house and were refused that request. Background The Schuylkill County Drug Task Force suspected the husband and father of the plaintiffs of selling methamphetamines so they procured a search warrant for him, the house, his car and anyone customers that were present. The wife and daughter were not listed as suspects. When the police were executing the warrant, they had a female parking enforcement officer take the wife and daughter to the bathroom and perform a strip search but no drugs were found on them. When the pair sued, the police officers claimed qualified immunity. Majority opinion The majority opinion for the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit found the search unconstitutional. The majority opinion states in its second paragraph: \\"[U]nder any reasonable reading, the warrant in this case did not authorize the search of the mother and daughter, and that the search was not otherwise justified. Accordingly, we will affirm the District Court's determination that the officers are not entitled to qualified immunity.\\" Alito's dissenting opinion Judge Samuel Alito wrote a dissenting opinion saying that police officers did not violate the Constitution when they strip- searched the mother and her ten-year-old daughter. Alito stated in section I of his dissent that the affidavit accompanying the warrant \\"...seeks permission to search all occupants of the residence...\\" and argues, again in section I, that \\"The warrant indisputably incorporated the affidavit...\\" Judge Michael Chertoff‚Äôs majority opinion asserted that Alito‚Äôs position would effectively nullify the Fourth Amendment‚Äôs warrant requirement and ‚Äútransform the judicial officer into little more than the clich√© rubber stamp.‚Äù Media attention on the case and Alito's opinion grew when he was nominated by President George W.

Ostensibly the Congress was called to consider a proposal to establish a University at the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem as a center of Islamic scholarship, an idea which the leaders of the prestigious Al-Azhar University in Cairo opposed and which never came to fruition. Attended by 130 delegates from 22 Muslim countries, the Congress called on Muslim states to avoid trade with the Jewish community in Palestine. However, the Congress was viewed widely as an attempt by the mufti to enhance his prestige in advance of a bid for the office of caliph. This position had remained vacant since a Pan-Islamic Congress in Mecca in 1926 had failed to agree on a suitable candidate to replace King Hussein of Hejaz. A rival clan of the Husaynis, the Nashashibis, helped to ensure that the mufti was unsuccessful in his bid for the caliphate. Following the election of Husayni as president of the Congress the agenda was arranged as follows: # Holy Places and the Buraq wall # the University of Al Masjid el Aksa # the Hejaz Railway # the furtherance of Muslim teaching and culture # Publications # Constitution of the Muslim Congress # Resolutions The Congress resolved that \\"Zionism is ipso facto an aggression detrimental to Muslim well- being, and that it is directly or indirectly ousting Moslems from the control of Muslim land and Muslem Holy Places\\". It was also resolved that the Congress should meet at intervals of two or three years and that resolutions should be enacted by an Executive Committee chaired by Husayni.

A side-scrolling beat 'em up based loosely on the legend of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table, the game features an action role-playing video game-like level advancement system, with fighters automatically being upgraded to new weapons and armor as they advance through the game. In September 13, 2018, Capcom announced Capcom Beat 'Em Up Bundle with Knights of the Round being one of seven titles and being released digitally for PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch, Xbox One and Microsoft Windows on September 18, 2018. Plot Arthur, who had been training himself to be a great knight, pulled out the sacred sword Excalibur from the rock. After pulling it out, Arthur realized his destiny was to become the first King of the Britons. Merlin then sends Arthur and his two closest companions, Lancelot and Perceval, to overthrow the evil king Garibaldi and to unite Britain. Retrieved April 9, 2013. Gameplay Gameplay of Knights of the Round The gameplay is very similar to other Capcom beat 'em ups, such as Final Fight and Capcom's previous hack-and-slash fantasy title The King of Dragons. There are seven stages, each with its own boss and a variety of generic enemies that try to stop the players' progress. The fights rely strongly on the blocking ability, which is triggered by pressing the attack button, then pressing the joystick away as the opponent strikes. If successful, the player gains a few seconds of invincibility with which to counter-attack. However, if no one strikes the player's character while holding the block, they will tire and drop their guard, making them vulnerable to attack. Blocking is vital in certain cases, since some bosses will be vulnerable only after their attack has been blocked by the player. As in most beat 'em ups, a desperation attack is performed by pressing both the attack and jump buttons simultaneously. This knocks out most enemies on the screen, but the player loses a little bit of health every time he uses it. At various points in the game, the players get to ride a horse, where they can attack enemies on horseback. The horses can stomp on enemies by pressing the joystick two times forward. On occasion, bosses and certain enemy characters can ride horses as well.  Characters  There are three playable characters: *Arthur, the main protagonist, is a well-balanced character in speed and power. His weapon is the sword Excalibur. He can perform a special attack, a powerful slashing blow, by pressing attack then holding the joystick toward the enemy's direction. Initially, Arthur wears chain mail and leather armor. Upon gaining levels, Excalibur becomes stronger, and he eventually gets more body armor (later in silver and gold colors). Arthur is also the most devastating character, when mounted on horseback. *Lancelot is a talented swordsman and has been traveling all over the world to find a worthy king he should serve. Lancelot is the fastest character but lacks in strength. Since the game favors maneuverability, he is very good for beginners. His special attack is the jumping kick, done by pressing attack then holding the joystick up. Lancelot's weapon of choice is a sabre. Lancelot starts out wearing a blue tabard with a yellow cross. In eventual level-ups, Lancelot gains plate armor and a broader sabre. *Perceval, a son of a blacksmith, is a strong warrior with a gentle heart. Unlike his sword-wielding friends Arthur and Lancelot, Perceval prefers to use a battle-axe. He has never been defeated thanks to his well-built body. Perceval is the strongest character but lacks in agility, making him good for intermediate to advanced players. He is the only character who can dash by tapping the joystick forward twice, cancelled into a \\"Giant Swing\\" by pressing the attack button while dashing. At first, Perceval has blond hair and light armor with green pants. In eventual level-ups, Perceval becomes bald with a beard, and gains heavier armor, though most of his chest is bare. Ports The game was ported to the Super NES in 1994, in Capcom Classics Collection: Reloaded for the PSP in 2006, as well as Capcom Classics Collection Vol. 2 for PlayStation 2 and Xbox and in 2018, in Capcom Beat 'Em Up Bundle for the PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch, Xbox One and Microsoft Windows. Reception In Japan, Game Machine listed Knights of the Round on their March 1, 1992 issue as being the most-successful table arcade unit of the year, outperforming titles such as Street Fighter II: The World Warrior. Sinclair User scored the arcade version a 78/100, writing that players who enjoyed Golden Axe would enjoy Knights of the Round. Anthony Baize, writing for Allgame, called it a \\"solid quarter muncher with some cool mythological characters.\\" Reviewing the SNES version, GamePro praised the quality of the sprites but remarked that \\"Slow, repetitive gameplay dulls the edge of this otherwise average game,\\" citing the gameplay's overwhelming focus on crude \\"hack 'n' slash\\" combat.

In October 2008 Maguito Vilela was elected mayor, who took office in January 2009. History The history of Aparecida, like that of Goi√¢nia, is recent. In 1922 followers of Our Lady of Aparecida donated land so that their neighbors could build a church for the Virgin. In 1958 it was elevated to the condition of Vila, as a district of Goi√¢nia with the name Aparecida de Goi√°s. In 1958 the name was changed to Goial√¢ndia which remained until 1963 when it emancipated itself and assumed the name of Aparecida de Goi√¢nia. Economy Its proximity to the capital has attracted important industries like Mabel (cookies), Vepeza and others, concentrated in the four different industrial zones on the edge of BR-153. In recent years the number of companies has doubled. In 2007 there were 964 industries. The industrial centers in the city are Distrito Agroindustrial de Aparecida de Goi√¢nia (Daiag), Distrito Industrial (Dimag), P√≥lo Empresarial Goi√°s and Cidade Empresarial. In 2007 there were 13 financial institutions in the city. Despite the heavy industrialization Aparecida still produces agricultural products. The cattle herd was 11,700 in 2003.

It was designed as a home and hobbyist counterpart for Borland C++. As the developer focused more on professional programming tools, later Turbo C++ products were made as scaled down versions of its professional compilers. History =Borland Turbo C++= The first release of Turbo C++ was made available during the MS-DOS era on personal computers. Version 1.0, running on MS-DOS, was released in May 1990. An OS/2 version was produced as well. Version 1.01 was released on February 28, 1991, running on MS-DOS. The latter was able to generate both COM and EXE programs and was shipped with Borland's Turbo Assembler compiler for Intel x86 processors. The initial version of the Turbo C++ compiler was based on a front end developed by TauMetric (TauMetric was later acquired by Sun Microsystems and their front end was incorporated in Sun C++ 4.0, which shipped in 1994). This compiler supported the AT&T; 2.0 release of C++. Turbo C++ 3.0 was released in 1991 (shipping on November 20), and came in amidst expectations of the coming release of Turbo C++ for Microsoft Windows. Initially released as an MS-DOS compiler, 3.0 supported C++ templates, Borland's inline assembler, and generation of MS-DOS mode executables for both 8086 real mode and 286 protected mode (as well as the Intel 80186.) 3.0 implemented AT&T; C++ 2.1, the most recent at the time. The separate Turbo Assembler product was no longer included, but the inline-assembler could stand in as a reduced functionality version. Soon after the release of Windows 3.0, Borland updated Turbo C++ to support Windows application development. The Turbo C++ 3.0 for Windows product was quickly followed by Turbo C++ 3.1 (and then Turbo C++ 4.5). It's possible that the jump from version 1.x to version 3.x was in part an attempt to link Turbo C++ release numbers with Microsoft Windows versions; however, it seems more likely that this jump was simply to synchronize Turbo C and Turbo C++, since Turbo C 2.0 (1989) and Turbo C++ 1.0 (1990) had come out roughly at the same time, and the next generation 3.0 was a merger of both the C and C++ compiler. Starting with version 3.0, Borland segmented their C++ compiler into two distinct product-lines: \\"Turbo C++\\" and \\"Borland C++\\". Turbo C++ was marketed toward the hobbyist and entry-level compiler market, while Borland C++ targeted the professional application development market. Borland C++ included additional tools, compiler code-optimization, and documentation to address the needs of commercial developers. Turbo C++ 3.0 could be upgraded with separate add-ons, such as Turbo Assembler and Turbo Vision 1.0. Version 4.0 was released in November 1993 and was notable (among other things) for its robust support of templates. In particular, Borland C++ 4 was instrumental in the development of the Standard Template Library, expression templates, and the first advanced applications of template metaprogramming. With the success of the Pascal-evolved product Delphi, Borland ceased work on their Borland C++ suite and concentrated on C++Builder for Windows. C++Builder shared Delphi's front-end application framework but retained the Borland C++ back-end compiler. Active development on Borland C++/Turbo C++ was suspended until 2006 (see below.) Version 4.5 was announced on March 20, 1995.BORLAND SHIPS TURBO C++ 4.5 - Upgrade Combines Learning Tools with Latest C++ Technologies New features include multimedia QuickTour, five new games (Turbo Meteors (an Asteroids-like game), Turbo Blocks, Turbo Cribbage, Turbo 21, Turbo Mah Jongg) with corresponding source codes.

The pedal has a characteristic mid-boosted tone popular with blues, rock and metal players. The \\"legendary\\" Tube Screamer has been used by countless guitarists to create their signature sound, and is one of the most successful, widely copied, and \\"modded\\" overdrive pedals in the history of the electric guitar. Description The Tube Screamer has a drive knob, a tone knob, and a level knob. The drive knob adjusts gain, the tone knob adjusts treble and the level knob adjusts the output volume of the pedal. The pedal is used to try to mimic the sound of a vintage tube amplifier. The classic Tube Screamer sound includes a \\"mid-hump\\", which means that the circuit accentuates frequencies between the bass and treble ranges (mid-frequencies). Some guitarists prefer this sort of equalization, as it helps to keep their sound from getting lost in the overall mix of the band. Variations The pedal was produced with many variants: The Tube Screamer pedal was preceded by the orange \\"Overdrive\\" (OD) and green \\"Overdrive-II\\" (OD-II). These came in narrower boxes without battery covers. There was also a reddish \\"Overdrive-II\\" which had a housing very similar to the TS-808/TS808. The green OD-II had a circuit similar to the TS808; however, the OD and OD-II had a more distorted circuit. * TS-808/TS808: The first Tube Screamer, the TS808, was released in the late 1970s. It was equipped with the Japanese JRC-4558 chip. Some units however had the Malaysian Texas Instruments RC4558P chip. * TS9: From 1981 to 1985, Ibanez produced the \\"9-series\\" of overdrive pedals. The TS9 Tube Screamer is almost the same internally as the TS808 but the TS9 had a different output, which caused the pedal to sound brighter and less smooth. In later years, TS9s were assembled with a wide variety of op- amps, instead of the sought-after JRC-4558. Once Ibanez discontinued the 9 series pedals, they introduced the \\"Master\\" or \\"L\\" series. These were only made in 1985, and did not have the Tube Screamer in the line-up. A rare and valuable version of the Tube Screamer was the ST9 Super Tube Screamer, which was sold only in Europe and Australia. * TS10: In 1986, Ibanez began production of the \\"Power Series\\", which included the TS10 Tube Screamer. The TS10 had three times as many changes to the circuit than the TS9 had had. Some TS10 pedals were made in Taiwan, using a MC4558 chip. All TS10s (as well as other L and 10-series pedals) used floating jacks and pots, which were mounted to the boards instead of the cases. This is weak point in the design sometimes causing the jacks to break off. * TS5: The plastic TS5 \\"Soundtank\\" followed the TS10 and was available until 1999. The TS5 circuit is very similar to the TS9; however, it was made for Ibanez in Taiwan by Daphon. Although designed by Maxon as referenced by Maxons history website. The first year of production had a metal casing, afterwards the casing was made out of plastic (which resulted in more noise than a typical TS808/TS9 box made out of metal). However, these plastic versions still have a shielded and grounded metal bottom plate for a slight interference reduction plus the needed weight to keep the pedal from sliding because of its light weight. * TS7: The TS7 \\"Tone- Lok\\" pedal was released in 1999. It was made in Taiwan like the TS5, but in an aluminum case that was more durable. The circuit inside had a \\"hot\\" mode switch for extra distortion and volume. Most TS7 pedals came with the JRC4558D chip, like the TS808 and TS9. *TS808HW: In early 2016, Ibanez revealed the TS808HW. Marketed as a premium, limited edition pedal, TS808HW is hand-wired with select JRC4558D chips and uses high-end OFC cables from Japan. HW is encased in a dark green, heavy duty metal box. It also comes standard with True Bypass, a feature many had to mod into the circuits of previous Tube Screamers. * TS-808DX: A combined TS808 equipped with the Japanese JRC-4558 chip with a 20db booster to be used separately or in conjunction with the overdrive. Maxon OD808 overdrive pedal into a clean guitar amp, with a Fender Telecaster The TS9 and TS808 pedals have been reissued, and according to the company, feature the same circuitry, electronics and design components that helped shape the famous Tube Screamer sound. Some musicians have a technician perform modifications to the unit to change the sound to their liking. Also, Maxon, which produced the original Tube Screamer pedals for the Ibanez brand in the 1970s‚Äì1980s, produce their own version of the Tube Screamer (called Overdrives: the OD-808 and OD-9 as opposed to Tube Screamer, TS). * TS9B: Released around 2011, it was designed for bass player, in a dark green stompbox with 5 knobs : Drive, Mix, Bass, Treble and Level controls. The Mix and 2-band Eq. controls allow bassists to produce the sound they want while still maintaining the feel of the original Tubescreamer and keep their low-end original signal. Design 200pxAccording to of Maxon, the designer of the Tube Screamer, the initial design concept was to create something to compete with BOSS OD-1 and MXR Distortion+. In doing so, he used an innovative circuit, using the monolithic operational amplifier device, introduced in early 70s, to create a pedal sound different from the \\"discrete\\" transistorized 60's fuzzes. The overdrive is produced using two silicon diodes in anti-parallel arrangement into the negative feedback circuit of an operational amplifier (\\"op-amp\\") circuit, to produce soft, symmetrical distortion of the input waveform. When the output exceeds the forward volt drop of the diodes the amplifier gain is much lower, effectively limiting the output to + and - one diode volt-drop, although due to the exponential I-V curve of the diodes this is not a hard limit. A \\"drive\\" potentiomenter in the feedback path provides variable gain. The original 4558 based circuit uses transistor buffers at both the input and the output, to improve impedance matching.http://www.geofex.com/Article_Folders/TStech/tsxtech.htm This is mathematically equivalent to mixing the input signal with a clipped version of itself, however. Thought of this way, it is said that this \\"preserves the original dynamics of the input signal which otherwise would get lost at the threshold of clipping\\" and \\"avoids muddiness and vastly improves clarity and responsiveness.\\" Characteristic of the distortion is the symmetrical nature, which produces mainly odd-order harmonics for a sine wave input. All this justifies the \\"vacuum tube\\" sound, and the \\"screaming\\" tone. As well, Tamura added a simple but effective post-distortion equalization circuit with a first-order high-pass shelving filter that \\"is linearly dependent on its gain\\", an approach called \\"progressivity\\". The overdrive stage is followed by a simple low-pass filter and active tone control circuit and volume control, using the second op-amp available on-chip. The circuit uses transistor buffers at both the input and the output, and a modern electronic field-effect transistor (FET) \\"noiseless\\" bypass switching to turn the effect on and off. The TS7 allows switching between a \\"TS9\\" mode, in which the circuit and all relevant component values are identical to the vintage model, and a \\"Hot\\" mode, which introduces an additional gain stage. Yet another variant is the Ibanez ST9 Super Tube that features a fourth knob (\\"Mid Boost\\"), which provides a harder attack. =JRC4558D op-amp = 200px Much has been made of the operational amplifier chips used in the various versions of the Tube Screamer pedal, and several \\"fairy tales\\" about the merits of these devices have been written on the subject. The JRC4558D chip is well-regarded by some. The (RC)4558 is a low priced, general purpose dual operational amplifier, introduced mid 70s by Texas Instruments as an \\"improved\\" version of the early 741, and used in thousands of consumer and industrial designs.http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/rc4558.pdf In fact, JRC4558D is nothing else than the licensed product manufactured by , and identical to any other 4558 chip. Other popular chips used included the TL072 (a JFET input type, highly popular in 80s), \\"original\\" TI RC4558P, and OPA2134. The TA75558 (yet another version, made by Toshiba), standard in the TS10 alongside the 4558, is strangely regarded as the \\"ugly duckling of TS opamps\\". In reality, the type of op-amp has little to do with the sound of the pedal, which is dominated by the diodes in the op-amp's feedback path. (See Op-amp swapping.) Notable users The pedal was popularized by Stevie Ray Vaughan. Phish guitarist Trey Anastasio implements two TS9 Tube Screamers in his rig. It is widely used in genres as diverse as country, blues and metal. The Tube Screamer has since spawned many clones and modified versions. Possible modifications include use of mismatched, or different diodes (for example, a silicon and a germanium device), or more than two diodes in various arrangements, or modified tone circuits. It is also used by many metal guitarists before the lead channel of the high gain amps to make distortion more focused and to cut the low end. Notable modifiers of the pedal include Robert Keeley of Keeley Electronics.

Two are discussed here: both members of the Four Horsemen of Apocalypse. The first War (real name unknown) and Abraham Kieros. The title was also held by the mutant Gazer and, briefly, by Bruce Banner, the Hulk. War (Abraham Kieros) =Publication history= War first appeared in X-Factor #11 (December 1986), and was created by Louise Simonson and Walter Simonson. The character subsequently appears in X-Factor #15 (April 1987), #17 (June 1987), #19 (August 1987), #22-25 (November 1987-February 1988), Daredevil #252 (March 1988), X-Factor #26-27 (March‚ÄìApril 1988), X-Factor #84 (November 1992), Uncanny X-Men #294‚Äì295 (November‚ÄìDecember 1992), and Wolverine #147 (February 2000). War appeared as part of the \\"Apocalypse's Horsemen\\" entry in the Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Update '89 #1. =Fictional character biography= Kieros was a young Vietnam War veteran who was paralyzed in combat. He was kept in a hospital and placed in an iron lung, but felt as though he was betrayed and forgotten by his country. Apocalypse appeared to him one day and offered him the ability to move and to get revenge on those who had tossed him aside.X-Factor #11 He accepted the offer and was indeed given the ability to move again, which allowed him to use his mutant power‚Äîthe ability to create explosions through kinetic contact, usually by clapping his hands together‚Äîin Apocalypse's service as his Horseman of War. He often bickered with one of the other Horsemen, Famine, and disliked her total lack of obedience. War liked to take control of situations and during their first confrontation with X-Factor, attempted to lead the other Horsemen. Famine and Pestilence refused to obey his orders and flew off to do their own business. Soon after, Death took over leadership and the Four Horsemen learned to ride as one. During the attack on Manhattan, War immediately attacked Cyclops and was later teleported back to the ship by Apocalypse, where he fought several more X-Factor members. He was eventually defeated by Iceman. Apocalypse then grabbed War and fled. Later, during the X-Cutioner's Song story arc, War attacked Colossus and Iceman, but soon fled after Caliban grabbed Jean Grey and Cyclops, handing them over to Apocalypse, who was really Mr. Sinister in disguise. The X-Men sought out the Horsemen and War was presumably defeated in combat. Much later, War appeared in an hospital, once again paralyzed from the neck down, apparently abandoned by Apocalypse who stripped him of his powers. Archangel, who had gained newfound powers and had been searching for Kieros, healed him of his wounds, giving him hope to start over with a new life.Wolverine #147 (February 2000) =Powers and abilities= Kieros is a mutant with the superhuman power to create explosions in his immediate area by clapping his hands. He does so by harnessing the minor kinetic force created when his hands strike each other, amplifying it to a significant degree, and redirecting it spatially so that it strikes and affects some other object in his line-of-sight, causing an explosive release of force. The limits of the range in which his power is effective have not yet been determined. While a servant of Apocalypse, he used his sentient ship to construct for War a robot mount that resembles a demonic quadruped beast and that can travel on land or fly through the air and also was capable of teleportation. War (Apocalypse vs. Dracula) The earliest depiction of Apocalypse's Horseman, War. Not much is known about this incarnation of War. He was chosen by Apocalypse in the fifteenth century to become his horseman and lead his army, the Riders of the Dark. This army was so fierce and powerful that most people presumed it was just a myth used to scare soldiers before their first battle. It was no myth at all, and it precisely was what people thought it was, fierce and strong. In most of their battles, the only soldier who had to fight was War, who would single-handedly defeat hordes of men just by himself. In 1459, the Riders of the Dark appeared in Romania where Vlad ≈¢epe≈ü' army was fighting against the Ottomans and emerged victorious. Unfortunately for Vlad (whom would become Dracula), War defeated Dracula's army. The survivors fled for their life, abandoning Dracula on the field who stood his ground and faced War but ultimately fell. War (Gazer) Gazer was a mutant astronaut, who after being depowered on M-Day, went out into space to die. Instead he was transported onto Apocalypse's ship and made to battle for the title of War, one of the Horsemen of Apocalypse. With Ozymandias' intervention, he was victorious, and through a torturous process became the newest incarnation of War.X-Men vol. 2 #183 Gazer was an astronaut permanently stationed alone on a NASA observation space station, due to the unusual metabolism he possessed as his mutant power, whereby he could absorb harmful radiation and process it to gain sustenance. He first encountered the X-Men when they used his station as a staging post for an attack on a group of non-sentient aliens which induced harmful emotions in humans. Gazer, before (left) and after his depowerment on M-Day Shortly afterwards, he lost his powers on M-Day, along with 90% of mutants. Succumbing to radiation sickness, he began to imagine that an experiment on the effects of radiation sickness was sentient (calling it \\"Phantom Torso\\"), and it constantly advised him to call NASA to ask for a return home. However, he remained until an alien resembling Doop, which he had built up to himself as his last hope, passed by his station on its way to crash-landing on Earth near Polaris, who'd seen it in space and had a similar reaction. Thereafter, \\"Phantom Torso\\" stopped \\"talking\\" to him, and he put on a spacesuit and went out into space to die. However, he was teleported to Apocalypse's sphinx-like ship, and forced to battle Dr. Foster, a human archeologist who had stumbled upon Apocalypse's tomb, for the \\"right\\" to become War, Horseman of Apocalypse. Gazer would have lost the battle if it were not for Ozymandias, Apocalypse's servant. Ozymandias told Gazer that he would owe him and one day the scribe would become the master. Gazer went through a terribly painful process where his skeleton was stretched, the former X-Man Sunfire, who was also chosen by Apocalypse to be a Horseman, tried to save him but Gazer had already been under Apocalypse's mind-control by then and helped recapture Shiro. As War, Gazer was sent to battle the X-Men and Sentinel Squad O*N*E. Upon returning to Apocalypse's sphinx, he was approached by Ozymandias who wanted his debt repaid. War, no longer Gazer, did not fulfill his oath and instead revealed the truth to Apocalypse about Ozymandias' treachery. During a heated battle against the X-Men, Ozymandias finally took his vengeance, stabbing Gazer from behind with a sword. =Powers and abilities= Before M-Day, Gazer, in addition to his unusual appearance, could absorb radiation at frequencies and levels which induce radiation sickness in normal humans and photosynthesize it as food. After his depowerment on M-Day, he was taken by Apocalypse and transformed to possess super-strength and enhanced durability, and the ability to absorb and rechannel solar energy as blasts of fire through his eyes. He also carries a spiked mace which flashes with electricity-like bursts, and rides a robotic horse-like flying machine. Other versions =Age of Apocalypse= The original War (Kieros) appeared in the Age of Apocalypse as a member of Apocalypse's first wave of Horsemen. War was killed by Mikhail Rasputin when Apocalypse invaded Russia. Impressed by Mikhail's victory, Apocalypse captured and brainwashed Mikhail so he could join the Horsemen of Apocalypse. =Mutant X= War also is seen in the Mutant X reality, where he constantly bickered with Death, but they had a mutual respect for each other. In other media =Television= * The original War appeared in three episodes of the X-Men animated series voiced by James Millington. In \\"Come the Apocalypse,\\" where War was selected by Apocalypse and transformed into his Horseman; the second and third, \\"Beyond Good and Evil,\\" Parts 3 and 4, where he fought alongside the other Horsemen when the X-Men sought out Apocalypse's Lazarus chamber. Instead of using his mutant abilities in the latter two episodes, he used an energy-projected sword. In his first appearance, he is shown not getting along with the woman who would become Pestilence, a nod to their disagreeable natures in the comics. =Film= In X-Men: Apocalypse, Magneto is the horseman War.

It is the third largest town in Hajd√∫-Bihar county. Etymology The name comes from a Slavic personal name Sobƒõslav (see e.g. Sobƒõslav, Sobƒõslavice). Location The town is located in the northeastern part of the Great Hungarian Plain. Three regions meet near the town: the Hajd√∫h√°t ridge to the north-north-east, the Hortob√°gy National Park (Puszta) to the north-north-west, and the Great S√°rr√©t and Beretty√≥ region to the south. Szoboszl√≥ lies at an altitude of scarcely above sea level and slopes slightly towards Hortob√°gy. This is a landscape \\"where earth and sky meet\\", but not a monotonous plain, even for travellers accustomed to romantic mountains, since here and there the landscape is enlivened by the backwaters of the Tisza River with patches of reed, thousands of wild fowl, and inviting groves. The surroundings are the renowned puszta, the \\"glorious plain\\". History From historical data and archaeological finds, this part of the Great Plain was inhabited as far back as the Great Migrations. Because of the natural resources and the convergence of trade routes, Huns, Vandals, Gepids, Goths, and Avars frequently alternated with one another in this area. Early in the reign of the √Årp√°d Dynasty, the area was inhabited by populous communities. The first written mention of Szoboszl√≥ dates back to 1075, when King G√©za I donated half of Szoboszl√≥'s royal duty taxes to the new abbacy to be established at Garamszentbenedek. With an ornate deed of gift dated 2 September 1606, Istv√°n Bocskai, Prince of Transylvania, provided smallholdings for 700 Hajd√∫ (Heyduck) cavalrymen at the site of Szoboszl√≥, which had been destroyed by the Crimean Tartars. Henceforth the prefix Hajd√∫ was attached to the settlement's previous Slavonic name, though the compound form - Hajd√∫szoboszl√≥ - only became widespread in the 19th century. The town led the customary, toilsome life of the small agricultural, stock-breeding towns of Hajd√∫ County until well into the 20th century. An upswing began on 26 October 1925 with the discovery of the thermal spring in the course of drilling for oil and gas. The medicinal water, tinged with natural iodine, led to the town's development into a resort spa, while agriculture retained its significant role even after the discovery of the gas field.

Among his works are History of the Prophet Elias for the church of the Carmelites; Martyrdom of St. Andrew for the church of San Francesco in C√≥rdoba; and Triumph of the Cross for la Caridad in Seville. He became friends with Bartolom√© Esteban Murillo, who had a very different style; Leal tended to paint somber and dramatic subjects, while Murillo's style was peaceful and serene. After Leal returned to Seville in 1656, he and Murillo founded the Seville Academy of Art. Several of his paintings treat the subjects of vanitas, transience and mortality. Two examples are In ictu oculi (\\"in the blink of an eye\\") and Finis gloriae mundi (\\"end of the world's glory\\"), painted for the Charity Hospital in Seville. Life He married Isabella Carasquilla, daughter of Antonio Palomino, in 1647. She was also a painter.

Count Rodryg Dunin's estate. Formerly the seat of the Nie≈ºychowski family, since 1898 in the hands of the current owner. The mansion, comfortable and spacious, was built in the first half of the previous century by Nepomucen Nie≈ºychowski, the estate's owner at the time. Rodryg Dunin was born in Marszewo, Kreis Pleschen, Province of Posen, to Stanis≈Çaw Tadeusz Dunin (a participant in the 19th century January Uprising), and Maria-Antonina Baranowska (daughter of the Pozna≈Ñ playwright Agnieszka Baranowska). He was a student at Maria Magdalena Gymnasium (high school) in Pozna≈Ñ, where he participated actively in a secret Polish educational-social youth movement, and later studied at academies in Tetschen (Dƒõƒç√≠n), Bohemia, and Leipzig, Saxony. He married Lucia (≈Åucja) Taczanowska (1862-1917), the widow of Stanis≈Çaw Nie≈ºychowski (1851-1897), and became the stepfather of her six children. Among his own children by the marriage was Stanis≈Çaw Antoni Piotr Dunin, an army officer who received the Virtuti Militari award.  Estate  Rodryg Dunin's estate was in Gran√≥wko, Kreis Kosten.

The island is 18 miles (29 km) long, stretching from Corpus Christi to Port Aransas. The island is oriented generally northeast‚Äìsouthwest, with the Gulf of Mexico on the east and south, and Corpus Christi Bay on the north and west. The island's southern end connects by roadway to Padre Island. At the northern end of the island is Port Aransas, beyond which is San Jos√© Island. The Aransas Channel, also known as the \\"Aransas Pass,\\" which separates Mustang Island from San Jos√© Island, is protected by jetties extending into the Gulf from each island. The town of Port Aransas is located at the northern end of the island. Mustang Island State Park encompasses the entire southern third of the island, including 3,955 acres (1,600 ha) and 5 miles (8 km) of beach. The city of Corpus Christi includes the northernmost portion of Padre Island and part of Mustang Island between Port Aransas and the state park. The island is a popular Spring Break destination for its beaches and is also popular with snowbirds Northerns and Canadians, who spend their winters in warm climates.  History  Mustang Island was first inhabited by Paleo-Indians. In 1519, when Spanish explorer Alonso √Ålvarez de Pineda sailed through the pass to what he later named Corpus Christi Bay, the island was inhabited by the Karankawa people. By the 18th century, as a result of grazing herds of horses introduced by Spanish settlers, the island was first called \\"Wild Horse\\", then \\"Mustang Island\\". Up to the 1840s, the island and pass (now the ship channel) were used by buccaneers, Mexican smugglers, merchants and immigrants seeking their fortune or someone else's fortune. The pirate Jean Lafitte purported frequented Mustang and neighboring islands during the 1820s. During the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, a small fort was built on the island to defend the entrance to Aransas Bay. Captain Robert Mercer was the first settler to set up residence on the island with his family. His wife is said to have been the first white woman in the area. He built a house there in 1853 and named it El Mar Rancho. Wildlife *In September 2007, Corpus Christi, Texas wildlife officials found a record of 128 Kemp's ridley sea turtle nests on Texas beaches, including 81 on North Padre Island (Padre Island National Seashore) and 4 on Mustang Island. Wildlife officials released 10,594 Kemp's ridleys hatchlings along the Texas coast that year. The turtles are endangered due to shrimpers' nets and they are popular in Mexico as boot material and food. *On June 10, 2008, a sperm whale beached itself on one of the island's beaches. It had to be euthanized because the city did not have the equipment needed to move the large whale.

It had a seating capacity of 2800 for hockey games. The building was first opened in 1939 but it was quickly called upon for other purposes. Throughout World War II, the Ice Stadium acted as a store for guns, bullets and other ammunition produced at the nearby Royal Ordnance Factory, ROF Nottingham. When the war ended, the building soon returned to being a recreational and ice sports building. A year after the end of the war, the Ice Stadium became the home of the Nottingham Panthers ice hockey team, who would use the facility until it closed, albeit with a twenty- year break. When the Panthers disbanded in 1960, the Ice Stadium continued to be used for ice skating and some other ice sports. It was to be the rink where ice dancers Torvill and Dean would practise in their early years. The Panthers were re-established in 1980 and the Ice Stadium became renowned as one of the most intimidating venues for opposition ice hockey teams to visit. It was affectionately known amongst the ice hockey fraternity as 'The Barn'.Memories of The Barn In 1996, plans were announced to replace the ageing building with a modern arena and a new skating pad. The Nottingham Ice Stadium was closed after 61 years in 2000. The Panthers played their final game at the Ice Stadium against the Newcastle Riverkings, which was lost 2-1 in overtime. The building was demolished soon afterwards to allow for the completion of the National Ice Centre.

A sample is imaged in a TEM as it is tilted to different angles, resulting in a \\"tilt-series\\" of 2D images (top). This tilt-series is then computationally reconstructed into a 3D \\"tomogram\\" (bottom). Electron cryotomography (CryoET) is an imaging technique used to produce high-resolution (~1‚Äì4 nm) three-dimensional views of samples, typically biological macromolecules and cells. CryoET is a specialized application of transmission electron cryomicroscopy (CryoTEM) in which samples are imaged as they are tilted, resulting in a series of 2D images that can be combined to produce a 3D reconstruction, similar to a CT scan of the human body. In contrast to other electron tomography techniques, samples are immobilized in non-crystalline (\\"vitreous\\") ice and imaged under cryogenic conditions (< ‚àí150 ¬∞C), allowing them to be imaged without dehydration or chemical fixation, which could otherwise disrupt or distort biological structures.  Description of technique  Example of electron cryotomography. The image shows a central slice through a tomographic reconstruction of an intact Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus cell. Scale bar 200 nm. In electron microscopy (EM), samples are imaged in an ultra-high vacuum. Such a vacuum is incompatible with biological samples such as cells; the water would boil off, and the difference in pressure would explode the cell. In room-temperature EM techniques, samples are therefore prepared by fixation and dehydration. Another approach to stabilize biological samples, however, is to freeze them (electron cryomicroscopy). As in other electron cryomicroscopy techniques, samples for CryoET (typically small cells (e.g. Bacteria, Archaea, or viruses) are prepared in standard aqueous media and applied to an EM grid. The grid is then plunged into a cryogen (typically ethane) so efficient that water molecules do not have time to rearrange into a crystalline lattice. The resulting water state is called \\"vitreous ice\\" and preserves native cellular structures, such as lipid membranes, that would normally be destroyed by freezing. Plunge-frozen samples are subsequently stored and imaged at liquid- nitrogen temperatures so that the water never warms enough to crystallize. Samples are imaged in a transmission electron microscope (TEM). As in other electron tomography techniques, the sample is tilted to different angles relative to the electron beam (typically every 1 or 2 degrees from about ‚àí60¬∞ to +60¬∞), and an image is acquired at each angle. This tilt-series of images can then be computationally reconstructed into a three-dimensional view of the object of interest. This is called a tomogram, or tomographic reconstruction.  Applications  In transmission electron microscopy (TEM), because electrons interact strongly with matter, resolution is limited by the thickness of the sample. Also, the thickness of the sample increases as the sample is tilted, and thicker samples can then completely block the electron beam, making the image dark or completely black. Therefore, for CryoET, samples should be less than ~500 nm thick to achieve \\"macromolecular\\" resolution (~4 nm). For this reason, most ECT studies have focused on purified macromolecular complexes, viruses, or small cells such as those of many species of Bacteria and Archaea. Larger cells, and even tissues, can be prepared for CryoET by thinning, either by cryo-sectioning or by focused ion beam (FIB) milling. In cryo-sectioning, frozen blocks of cells or tissue are sectioned into thin samples with a cryo-microtome. In FIB-milling, plunge- frozen samples are exposed to a focused beam of ions, typically gallium, that precisely whittle away material from the top and bottom of a sample, leaving a thin lamella suitable for ECT imaging. The strong interaction of electrons with matter also results in an anisotropic resolution effect. As the sample is tilted during imaging, the electron beam interacts with a relatively greater cross-sectional area at higher tilt angles. In practice, tilt angles greater than approximately 60‚Äì70¬∞ do not yield much information and are therefore not used. This results in a \\"missing wedge\\" of information in the final tomogram that decreases resolution parallel to the electron beam. For structures that are present in multiple copies in one or multiple tomograms, higher resolution (even ‚â§1 nm) can be obtained by subtomogram averaging. Similar to single particle analysis, subtomogram averaging computationally combines images of identical objects to increase the signal-to-noise ratio. A major obstacle in CryoET is identifying structures of interest within complicated cellular environments. One solution is to apply correlated cryo-fluorescence light microscopy, and even super-resolution light microscopy (e.g. cryo-PALM), and CryoET. In these techniques, a sample containing a fluorescently-tagged protein of interest is plunge-frozen and first imaged in a light microscope equipped with a special stage to allow the sample to be kept at sub- crystallization temperatures (< ‚àí150 ¬∞C). The location of the fluorescent signal is identified and the sample is transferred to the CryoTEM, where the same location is then imaged at high resolution by CryoET.

Its Latin name means, literally, \\"pillar of intestines\\", referring to the fact that its body is a soft, translucent column-like structure, resembling a mass of intestines sprouting from a rock. It is a globally distributed cosmopolitan species. Since Linnaeus described the species, Ciona intestinalis has been used as a model invertebrate chordate in developmental biology and genomics. Studies conducted between 2005 and 2010 have shown that there are at least two, possibly four, sister species. More recently it has been shown that one of these species has already been described as Ciona robusta. By anthropogenic means, the species has invaded various parts of the world and is known as an invasive species. Although Linnaeus first categorised this species as a kind of mollusk, Alexander Kovalevsky found a tadpole-like larval stage during development that shows similarity to vertebrates. Recent molecular phylogenetic studies as well as phylogenomic studies support that sea squirts are the closest invertebrate relatives of vertebrates. Its full genome has been sequenced using a specimen from Half Moon Bay in California, USA, showing a very small genome size, less than 1/20 of the human genome, but having a gene corresponding to almost every family of genes in vertebrates. Appearance Ciona intestinalis is a solitary tunicate with a cylindrical, soft, gelatinous body, up to 20 cm long. The body colour and colour at the distal end of siphons are major external characters distinguishing sister species within the species complex. The body of Ciona is bag-like and covered by a tunic, which is a secretion of the epidermal cells. The body is attached by a permanent base located at the posterior end, while the opposite extremity has two openings, the buccal and atrial siphons. Water is drawn into the ascidian through the buccal (oral) siphon and leaves the atrium through the atrial siphon (cloacal). Ecology Ciona intestinalis is a hermaphroditic broadcast spawner but cannot self-fertilize. Eggs and sperm, when released, can stay in the water column for 1 to 2 days while the larvae are free- swimming for 2 to 10 days. Ciona intestinalis is considered to be an invasive species and grows in dense aggregations on any floating or submerged substrate, particularly artificial structures like pilings, aquaculture gear, floats and boat hulls, in the lower intertidal to sub-tidal zones. It often grows with or on other fouling organisms. It is thought to spread to new areas mainly through hull fouling. Since its larvae can live for up to 10 days, this species may also be transferred through the release of bilge or ballast water. Because of the potential impact of C. intestinalis introduction to new habitats, fish and shellfish harvesters are advised to avoid transfer of harvested shellfish and fishing gear to other areas, to dry gear thoroughly before transfer, to inspect boat hulls and, if necessary, to clean them thoroughly, disinfect with bleach or vinegar and dry before moving to other areas. It is also recommended to dispose of any organisms removed from boat hulls or gear on land and to release bilge water on land or disinfect it. Sexual reproduction C. intestinalis is an hermaphrodite that releases sperm and eggs into the surrounding seawater almost simultaneously. C. intestinalis is self-sterile, and thus has been used for studies on the mechanism of self-incompatibility. Self/non-self-recognition molecules are considered to play a key role in the process of interaction between sperm and the vitelline coat of the egg. It appears that self/non-self recognition in ascidians such as C. intestinalis is mechanistically similar to self- incompatibility systems in flowering plants. Self-incompatibility promotes out-crossing which provides the adaptive advantage at each generation of masking deleterious recessive mutations (i.e. genetic complementation).  Cell signalling  In the sea squirt C. intestinalis a CB1 and CB2-type cannabinoid receptors is found to be targeted to axons, indicative of an ancient role for cannabinoid receptors as axonal regulators of neuronal signalling.  Genetics  C. intestinalis was one of the first animals to have its full genome sequenced, in 2002. It has a relatively small genome (about 160 Mbp) consisting of 14 pairs of chromosomes with about 16,000 genes. = Hox genes = The draft genome analysis identified nine Hox genes, which are Ci-Hox1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, and 13. Ciona savignyi, the closest relative of Ciona intestinalis, also have the same set of Hox genes. The organization of Hox genes is only known for C. intestinalis among ascidians. The nine Hox genes are located on two chromosomes; Ci-Hox1 to 10 on one chromosome and Ci-Hox12 and 13 on another. The intergenic distances within the Ciona Hox genes are extraordinarily long. Seven Hox genes, Ci-Hox1 to 10, are distributed along approximately half the length of the chromosome. Comparisons to Hox gene expression and location in other species suggests that the Hox genes in ascidian genomes are under a dispersing condition.Ikuta, Tetsuro, and Hidetoshi Saiga. \\"Organization of Hox genes in ascidians: Present, past, and future.\\" Developmental Dynamics 233.2 (2005): 382-89. = GEVIs = A majority of genetically encoded voltage indicator are based on the C. intestinalis voltage-sensitive domain (Ci-VSD).

A successor to the Caldera Network Desktop put together by Caldera since 1995, OpenLinux was an early \\"business-oriented distribution\\" and foreshadowed the direction of developments that came to most other distributions and the Linux community generally. Novell Corsair Corsair, a user interface for NetWare, was a project run by Novell corporation's Advanced Technology Group (ATG) between 1993 and 1995. Novell wanted a desktop environment with internet connectivity and conducted research on how to better and more easily integrate and manage network access for users. Windows' own support for connecting to Novell networks would not be improved until later releases and the Internet was dominated by Unix-based operating systems. Relative to their needs, Novell deemed the Unixes of the day were too hardware intensive, too large, and charged too much in license fees. This group became convinced that Linux offered the best possible answer for the OS component. There were many other components as well, and these were of particular interest: * Willows, a Microsoft Windows-compatible API for Unix systems to allow recompilation of Windows programs for Linux. * Wine, a compatibility layer for running Windows and DOS software * Ferret, a meeting browser * WordPerfect, a then cross-platform word processing application bought by Novell in June 1994 On 5 April 1994, the Board of Novell hired Robert Frankenberg, the general manager of Hewlett-Packard Personal Information Products Group to replace Raymond John Noorda as CEO of Novell. Novell's stock price had performed poorly recently due to flagging growth. At Novell, the Network division (NSG) was growing at a pace of 19% per year, the Unix business division (USG) was flat, and the Desktop Applications division (DSG) was shrinking at a rate of $400 million per year. Frankenberg's initiative was to refocus the company on networking and networking services. In terms of Corsair, that meant shedding most of the pieces. The Advanced Technology Group was disbanded, which shut down Willows and the OS project. Negotiations started which would eventually lead to WordPerfect being sold off to Corel in January 1996. Ferret was in line with the new direction and this component was kept within Novell. Through his Noorda Family Trust (NFT), Ray Noorda had founded a venture capital investment group called the Canopy Group two years earlier in 1992. He thought there was substantial promise in both the OS project and the Willows project. He created two companies, to continue the work started at Novell. The \\"API company\\" was called Willows Software, Inc. (founded 1993) and the \\"OS company\\" became Caldera, Inc. (founded in October 1994 and incorporated in January 1995). Noorda's early vision for Caldera was to create an IPX-based version of Linux which would license the key components, and resell this technology back to Novell to continue the Internet Desktop. In effect, in 1994 Caldera started life as kind of an outsourcing project for Novell, based on a technology demo named Expos√©. Caldera started with ten employees and most were from Novell: Bryan Wayne Sparks, founder/president (Novell); Bryce J. Burns, chief operations officer (Novell); Ransom H. Love, VP marketing (Novell); Greg Page, VP engineering (Bell Labs, AT&T;); and Craig Bradley, VP Sales (Lotus, Word Perfect). Caldera Network Desktop right At this point in 1995 Ransom Love and Ray Noorda took note of the technologies that Caldera put together, specifically: * Caldera built on the Linux kernel which ran on x86, PowerPC and Alpha architectures. Caldera Network Desktop was based on Red Hat Commercial Linux. * Its wide area networking was far more advanced than the Microsoft networked OSes at the time (Windows for Workgroups 3.11 and Windows NT 3.51), due to its being Unix-like. * Caldera included a version of Novell's IPX network protocol and a client for NetWare. * The Willows Application Programming Interface for Windows (APIW) code written for Caldera's operating system would run on Unix, Microsoft Windows, and Apple Macintosh, as well as Caldera's system itself. * Caldera also incorporated LISA (Linux Installation and System Administration), which had been developed by the German Linux Support Team (LST) for their own Linux distribution. More than just a component for Novell, Caldera had assembled the components needed to create a VAR platform. However, Caldera faced a bootstrapping problem. OEM VAR applications often depended crucially on other companies' commercial applications. Since these other applications hadn't been ported to Linux yet, they couldn't meaningfully port their own applications. Caldera responded by creating a binary applications package, which allowed Linux to run UnixWare and OpenServer applications, the Linux Application Binary Interface (ABI) project, and by assisting Santa Cruz Operation (SCO) in creating the Linux Kernel Personalities. Linux Kernel Personalities was worked on to bring Linux application compatibility to SCO Unix (formerly UnixWare) and OpenServer. \\"The idea was to enable developers to write for both, Unix and Linux, with a common Application Programming Interface (API) and common Application Binary Interface (ABI). That way, developers didn't have to work so hard, and Unix users, the client base we inherited from SCO, could run Linux applications.\\" Caldera also supported Alan Cox in his work on SMP. If Linux displaced Unix on the Intel x86 platform, then Sun Microsystems wouldn't have a low-end Unix path. This point becomes more interesting in light of SCO's litigation eight years later against IBM in 2003. That is, IBM was not the company involved in the SMP work, and moreover, the company most directly involved is the company that later became the SCO Group, essentially SCO suing IBM for work it itself did. In 1995, when XFree86 was still very hard to configure and unreliable on most chipsets, Caldera had shipped with MetroLink's Motif and XI Graphic's Accelerated-X. Known releases: * Caldera Network Desktop 1.0 Preview I (1995-05) * Caldera Network Desktop 1.0 Preview II (1995-09) with Linux kernel 1.2.13 * Caldera Network Desktop 1.0 (scheduled for 1995-11, released 1996-02-05) * Caldera Network Desktop Bundle (scheduled for 1995-12, released 1996-02-05) Caldera Network Desktop was produced and sold until March 1997. Caldera OpenLinux During 1996, Caldera continued to be a valuable player, for example, on 23 May 1996, at the Linux Kongress in Berlin, Germany, Caldera announced its plans to obtain POSIX and FIPS certifications and the X/Open brand for UNIX 95 and XPG4 BASE 95 for the Linux operating system kernel and \\"Open Linux\\". In contrast to CND OpenLinux was based on LST Power Linux, a Slackware-derived distribution that had been maintained by Linux Support Team since 1993 and the first to come with a Linux 2.0 kernel. In 1996 Linux Support Team grew into Stefan Probst's and Ralf Flaxa's company LST Software GmbH (with LST now standing for Linux System Technology) in Erlangen, Germany. The OpenLinux development led them to become Caldera's German development center Caldera Deutschland GmbH since May 1997. On 23 July 1996, Caldera purchased Novell DOS and the remaining Digital Research assets from Novell in order to bundle a DOS with their version of Linux, which led to creating the OpenDOS distribution to help port DOS applications. Caldera supported the Linux-port of StarOffice 3.1 with ca. 800.000 DM in order to offer the product with their forthcoming OpenLinux distribution in 1997. By 1997, when the OpenLinux distribution was first released, Caldera had taken on the form that it would be most remembered for. Caldera had switched over to the high end Linux product. The \\"business\\" Linux distribution became more rich with features with bundled proprietary software. However, it became less community oriented and was released less frequently than other Linuxes did. Other differences included automated configuration for administration tools, paid technical support staff, built-in consistent default GUI, and a range of supported applications. Over the next five years, Caldera Systems offered additional commercial extensions to Linux. They licensed Sun's Wabi to allow people to run Windows applications under Linux. Additionally, they shipped with Linux versions of WordPerfect (from Novell and later Corel) and CorelDRAW. Since many of their customers used a dual boot setup and FIPS was unreliable, they shipped with PowerQuest's PartitionMagic to allow their customers to non-destructively repartition their hard disks. In partnership with IBM they produced the first Linux distribution which was DB2 compatible. With the Oracle Corporation they became the target platform for the Linux port of the Oracle database. Other ventures included starting the Blackdown Java project, and creating professional certification. They also formed strong partnerships with SCO's value-added reseller market and started laying the groundwork for OEM sales of Unix-based vertical applications. Caldera Systems offered three versions of OpenLinux: * OpenLinux Lite was a freely downloadable version. * OpenLinux Base was a USD 99 version with a few extensions. * OpenLinux Standard was USD 299 and was their fully featured product. In addition to other people's applications, they created many Linux extensions to fill voids where no other commercial company was. Caldera Systems began working on a Linux equivalent of replacing the Microsoft Exchange Server and Microsoft Outlook that would eventually become Volution Messaging Server, which offered calendaring/scheduling options with shared busy/free information, SSL support for e-mail and easy configuration. Additionally, Caldera Deutschland created the first fully graphical installer for Linux, called Lizard, starting in November 1998. They invented browser- based Unix system administration, created the webmin project, and employed its developer Jamie Cameron between 1999 and 2001. right Caldera Systems created a full featured GUI system administration tool called Caldera Open Administration System (COAS). The tool was a unified, easy to use administration tool with a modular design. With its scalability and broad scope abilities, it featured: * Portability (specifics encapsulated in a platform repository) * Open development model * Flexible module licensing * Multiple user interfaces (batch processing, ncurses, QT, Java) * Scripting interface (Python) for rapid prototyping * Backward compatibility (works on native files, \\"vi admin\\" friendly) OpenLinux showed the Linux community what would be required to create a mainstream desktop OS out of the Linux kernel. In many ways the last ten years of desktop progress has been to successfully implement what Caldera was attempting to do with the tools they had available using open source software in place of the closed applications. Their technique for this was to utilize commercial software to fill in the largest gaps making their product a \\"value add\\" and thus they could charge for it. It made them the most commercial and at the same time it made them the most advanced distribution available. The desktop company became Caldera International under the direction of Ransom Love. The focus for the desktop company became mainly marketing and business relationships. There were several reasons for this. The first was that Caldera had won a $280 million lawsuit against Microsoft for DR-DOS and was flush with cash. Secondly, while the Caldera distribution was good, its primary advantages were the use of technologies not owned by Caldera and thus if Caldera were successful its success could (from a technical standpoint) be imitated, by Red Hat, SUSE, TurboLinux, etc. Third, for years Caldera had been competing directly with SCO Unix, but by 1997 Linux outperformed SCO in almost every respect. Making the choice to switch from SCO to Caldera was not a \\"no-brainer\\" for companies because that also meant a switch of vendors and support organizations. Caldera's SCO acquisition was aimed at eliminating this problem. That is Caldera International's corporate direction became to combine SCO's distribution, marketing and VAR arm with LAMP, and use Project Monterey to develop a 64-bit strategy. What SCO offered was: * A strong list of business clients. * Higher compatibility between SCO and Linux than any other Unix/Linux combination, mainly as a result of Caldera's long standing SCO focus that created products like ABI and thus resulted in ports of SCO code to Linux * A good back-office and database solution while Linux specialized in networking (LAMP) and client desktop, a very appealing combination in challenging Sun and Microsoft * A global infrastructure (presence in about 80 countries), Caldera was domestic * Thousands of business applications targeted to vertical markets * Some of the 3rd party components needed to get HP-UX, AIX, Solaris 3rd party Java applications ported to Linux From a technical standpoint however Caldera OpenLinux really shone during the Ransom Love years. Their commercial bundling solution continued to work. They had a powerful low bug (by Linux standards) distribution that worked well on a wide range of hardware. They charged a great deal relative to other distributions and were able to generate a very strong profit. Red Hat pulled way ahead of them in terms of US sales and on the global sales front they trailed SUSE and TurboLinux as well, but financially due to the DR-DOS settlement they were the strongest of all the Linux distributions.

Santa Cruz Operation (SCO) was a much larger company than Caldera Systems had been, and in fact of the $71 million of revenue 90% was from the SCO side of the business. Moreover, Caldera Systems costs $4 in marketing to generate a $1 in sales, SCO was mature and sold itself (mainly to repeat customers). The VAR relationship was even more problematic. Caldera Systems had always sold the \\"Linux is SCO but better\\" model and had done everything possible to make the transition from SCO to Caldera Systems relatively seamless. Each of the 14,000 SCO resellers made much more from each SCO sale than from sales of Caldera Systems, so they were not anxious to move existing customers from SCO to Linux; and even those, that were supportive of Linux, saw no strong value add for Caldera Systems and often sold Red Hat Enterprise Linux. Caldera Systems had two businesses in direct competition, one, which was a shrinking, but still profitable Unix business, the other a rapidly growing business, that was still hemorrhaging money. The most logical solution was to establish Caldera Systems as the premier Linux brand. Without the threat from Red Hat, transitioning resellers from SCO to Caldera Systems would be much easier. With this in mind Ransom Love formed an alliance of large business oriented Linux distributions which utilized the KDE desktop, called United Linux. The alliance comprised Caldera International, SUSE Linux, Turbolinux, and Conectiva. Filings from Novell in the SCO Group SCO v. Novell lawsuit showed that this was more than simply a marketing gimmick, and was a real alliance. Business responded favorably to the movement as IBM and AMD quickly formed partnerships. The Linux Professional Institute adopted United Linux as their standard distribution for training. For the first time there was a Linux distribution with: * Global scope * Global support at the VAR, OEM and distribution level * A full training organization * Some governmental buy- in * Support from major corporations * Enterprise applications like Oracle supported out of the box * An actual production GUI that ran well on a variety of hardware SUSE Linux had the engineering, as it had continued to maintain a large technical staff, Caldera International had the global support organization, and Turbo Linux as well as Conectiva brought with growth potential into less flooded markets. This merger was so successful, that Love and Sparks could claim vindication that year when Novell reversed the Frankenberg decision and brought United Linux engineering talent back into the fold with the acquisition of SUSE. United Linux was rejected by the broader Linux community; the use of per-seat licensing was their most highly controversial decision. More importantly, by the time United Linux was released, Darl McBride had become CEO of Caldera International and the focus had shifted away from Linux. Caldera International at this point released a Caldera \\"Linux distribution\\" with the OpenUNIX 8 kernel instead of the Linux kernel. Unix has TLI and STREAMS support, which made writing drivers easier. Caldera International proved this by replacing the kernel and yet not having to change much else on a full featured desktop and server \\"Linux\\". Copyright infringement allegations In 2002, the Caldera International board of directors, including Ralph Yarro, named Darl McBride, formerly with Franklin- Covey, as CEO. Almost immediately he saw the value of Caldera International as being primarily the value of SCO. The company was renamed The SCO Group. Ransom Love was reassigned to work exclusively on United Linux. After he completed this, he left the company to join Progeny Linux Systems which was aiming to create a professional Debian. He remained there in the capacity of a board member and advisor until 30 April 2007 when Progeny ceased operations. McBride began to focus on SCO's copyrights. One of McBride's first acts as CEO was to collect $600,000 in back licensing fees that were owed to Caldera International. He cleaned up various Linux-related licensing issues allowing for a new round of financing. Soon thereafter he made strong accusations that Linux had infringed copyrights SCO held on Unix; they claimed to have purchased these copyrights from Novell. Novell denied selling them the Unix copyright, prompting them to sue for slander of title. SCO also initiated lawsuits against IBM and AutoZone, alleging copyright infringements through the use or distribution of Linux; none of these lawsuits have been resolved. SCO has created a division, SCOsource, that owns and licenses their intellectual property; a desktop license is $699.

Cecil John L'Estrange Malone (7 September 1890 ‚Äì 25 February 1965) was a British politician and pioneer naval aviator who served as the United Kingdom's first Communist member of parliament. Early years and military service Malone was born in Dalton Holme, a parish in the East Riding of Yorkshire, on 7 September 1890. He was the son of the Reverend Savile L'Estrange Malone and Frances Mary Faljomb. He was related to the sisters Constance Markievicz and Eva Gore-Booth. Malone was educated at Cordwalles School in Maidenhead before joining the Royal Navy in 1905 and went through officer training at Royal Naval College, Dartmouth. On 15 March 1910, he was confirmed as a sub-lieutenant having previously been acting in that rank. In 1911, he was part of the second course approved by the Admiralty to attend Naval Flying School, Eastchurch. He was promoted to lieutenant from sub-lieutenant on 15 December 1911. Malone earned his Royal Aero Club certificate (No. 195) on 12 March 1912.Flight, flightglobal.com, 16 March 1912. In the Army Manoeuvres of 1912, Malone flew a twin-engined triple- screwed Short biplane. He is also noted for flying off the forecastle of steaming . During World War I, Malone commanded Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS) planes in the Cuxhaven Raid on 25 December 1914. From August 1914 to March 1915, he captained , a cross-channel steamer converted to a seaplane carrier. From March 1915 to April 1916, he captained , another steamer converted to a seaplane carrier. Under Malone's command, seaplanes from Ben-my-Chree were the first on record to carry torpedoes and they torpedoed three enemy vessels in 1916. Malone then took over command of the East Indies and Egypt Seaplane Squadron, for which he was awarded the Fourth Class of the Order of the Nile. Malone was appointed to the Plans Division of the Admiralty in 1918 before becoming the First British Air Attache at the Embassy of the United Kingdom, Paris. In this capacity, he was the Air Representative of the Supreme War Council in Versailles in 1918. He was awarded Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) for his war efforts. Early political career Malone was elected as the Coalition Liberal Member of Parliament (MP) for East Leyton at the 1918 general election. He was a member of the anti-communist Reconstruction Society and wrote a number of articles strongly criticising left-wing activists. As Adams and Wilson wrote, \\"his early career contained no hint of his subsequent espousal of the communist cause.\\" On 13 September 1919, with a passport endorsed by the British Foreign Office in hand, Cecil Malone embarked on the S.S. Arcturus for Helsinki. There Malone, who intended to visit Soviet Russia despite the blockade of the country, unexpectedly met up with another individual planning on crossing over to Petrograd.Colonel Malone, The Russian Republic. London: British Socialist Party, 1920, p. 17. After travelling by sea and land to the border, the pair managed to cross the frontier through deserted forests and marshland by foot, arriving at the Soviet border on Sunday, 28 September.Malone, The Russian Republic, p. 18. The two arrived in Petrograd by train at 6 pm the following day. Malone met and spoke with key leaders of the trade union movement in Petrograd before proceeding by train to Moscow.Malone, The Russian Republic, pp. 29, 32 In Moscow, Malone met with Maxim Litvinov, then a top official in the People's Commissariat of Foreign Affairs, with whom he had a long discussion.Malone, The Russian Republic, p. 34. He later met for an hour with foreign minister Georgii Chicherin.Malone, The Russian Republic, p. 46. Malone's new friends arranged for him to accompany Red Army leader Leon Trotsky on an inspection of troops at Tula aboard Trotsky's special train.Malone, The Russian Republic, pp. 47-48. Accompanying Malone on the trip were the head of the Supreme Council of National Economy (VSNKh), Alexei Rykov; chief of food supply for the Russian Republic, Alexander Tsiurupa; and People's Commissar of Education Anatoly Lunacharsky.Malone, The Russian Republic, p. 49. During his visit, detailed in his memoir, Malone toured factories and theatres, power stations and government offices. He found the mission of the Bolshevik government in attempting economic reconstruction to be compelling and emerged from his trip a committed communist. \\"The history of Allied negotiations and transactions with Russia appears to have been a chain of catastrophes and mistakes\\" he wrote: > \\"...[I]t seems there was a culpable lack of foresight in visualizing the > forces behind the Revolution. Every effort was made by Lenin and Trotsky to > bring about peace with the Allies. They were prepared to refuse to sign the > Treaty of Brest-Litovsk with Germany, and instead to continue the fight on > the side of the Allies, but the Allies refused to recognize them ...

Malone was soon being elected to the party's leadership through the patronage of Theodore Rothstein. In the summer of 1920, the BSP became the main constituent of the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB), and as a result, Malone became the first CPGB MP. He attended the London Communist Unity Convention held 31 July and 1 August 1921, at which he was elected to the new party's governing Central Committee.Klugmann, History of the Communist Party of Great Britain. In Two Volumes. London: Lawrence and Wishart, 1968; vol. 1, pg. 180 Malone's sudden conversion to revolutionary politics brought more questions than answers, and its genuineness was questioned. John Maclean claimed that Malone was a counter-revolutionary sent to disrupt the workers' movement, and he refused to speak alongside Malone.Brian John Ripley and J. McHugh, John Maclean, p. 127 Official CPGB historian James Klugmann saw Malone as a leading figure in the party's first year of existence: > \\"In the first months of the Party's existence Col. Malone was very active > not only in Parliament, but addressing mass meetings and rallies all over > the country. Whatever his theoretical weaknesses, he was a man of passion, > moved by the revolutionary tremors that were shaking the world, full of > wrath and indignation against the powers that be, and after a fiery speech > in the Albert Hall on November 7, 1920, he was charged with sedition under > Regulation 42 of the Defense of the Realm Act ... [h]e was sentenced to six > months in the Second Division.\\"Klugmann, History of the Communist Party of > Great Britain, vol. 1, pg. 182 The line which landed Malone in jail related to his argument that during a revolutionary crisis, excesses might occur resulting in the killing of some prominent members of the bourgeoisie. \\"What are a few Churchills or a few Curzons on lampposts compared to the massacre of thousands of human beings?\\", Malone asked his audience. Despite Malone's prosecution, the Communist Party did not disavow Malone's rhetorical flourish, going so far as to publish an official party pamphlet, entitled What are a Few Churchills? in January 1921.Klugmann, History of the Communist Party of Great Britain, vol. 1, p. 182, fn. 2 He was stripped of his OBE on 24 June 1921.Malone political biography, including the stripping of his OBE , leighrayment.com; accessed 11 December 2016. Malone came to the attention of Special Branch, whose role it was to combat \\"Bolshevik subversion\\". He was frequently mentioned in reports to the cabinet on Revolutionary Organisations in the United Kingdom. Malone worked to promote the affiliation of the CPGB to the Labour Party, which was under consideration as a tactical matter, urged by Lenin. Malone was particularly keen and stated \\"There are still a few differences between the Communist Party and the Labour Party. I am glad to realise, however, that this will soon be settled by affiliation\\".Raymond Challinor, The Origins of British Bolshevism Later political and military career Malone dissociated himself from the Communist Party of Great Britain and joined the Independent Labour Party, which was affiliated to the Labour Party, in 1922. He was the Labour candidate for Ashton-under-Lyne in the 1924 general election, but was unsuccessful. However, following the death of Arthur Holland in 1927, Malone was elected as MP for Northampton in the ensuing 1928 by-election. He was re- elected at the 1929 general election, and served in Ramsay MacDonald's government as the Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Minister of Pensions, Frederick Roberts, in 1931. He was not re-elected in the 1931 general election. Malone returned to military service in the Second World War. In 1942 he was the staff officer to the chief warden of the City of Westminster Civil Defence. From 1943 to 1945 he served in the Admiralty Small Vessels Pool. Following the end of the war in 1945, he became the Vice President of the Royal Television Society, the founder and chairman of the Radio Association, and a fellow of the Royal Aeronautical Society. By the time of his death his publications included The Russian Republic, New China, and Manchukuo: Jewel of Asia. Later life Malone married Leah Kay in 1921. After her death, he remarried in 1956. He died on 25 February 1965, aged 74.

Hennessy's history began when \\"Copper King\\" Marcus Daly, a powerful businessman from Butte, Montana, had a falling out with his business associate in Missoula, Montana, A.B. Hammond. Daly decided that Butte needed a store that would compete with Hammond's Missoula Mercantile to sell goods to miners in Butte and lumbermen in Missoula. He found fellow businessman, Daniel Hennessy. Hennessy owned and operated a successful store in Butte. With the clout of financial backing from Daly, Hennessy hired Frederick Kees, an architect from Minneapolis, to design one of Butte's most elegant buildings. Hennessy's department store opened for business in 1898. Inside, shoppers encountered marble staircases, oak counters, and solid bronze balustrades. Customers found every type of merchandise in 17 different departments from the basement level, up through the first three floors. At its opening, the Butte Hennessy's store employed 200 people. Hennessy's stores expanded from Butte into locations in Missoula, Billings, and Helena. The chain was acquired by Mercantile Stores in the 1970s and headquarters moved to Billings in 1980. The Hennessy's chain closed the Butte store in February 1980 after years of difficult business. In 1998 Dillard's acquired Mercantile Stores and the Hennessy's brand was dropped in favor of Dillard's. At this time Hennessy's operated three stores in Helena, Billings, and Missoula. The Hennessy Building in Butte was acquired from a company named Touch America in 2003 by Lawrence and Cynthia Farrar of Butte, Montana. It now is home to such businesses as Resodyn Corporation, Inc., a R&D; and manufacturing company; Knot Square Design, LLC, a residential and commercial building design company; as well as Montana Structure Design & Build, LLC, a construction company; as well as a few others.

He had the misfortune to be shot down over North Vietnam on both cruises, but survived to return to the Oriskany both times. Personal life Verich was born in Laona, Wisconsin in 1932, of ethnic Serb ancestry. His parents Peter and Annette had six children, of which Demetrio was the youngest. He graduated from the Laona High School in 1950. He was married to Mary (n√©e Rathborne) with whom he had six children. Military service In 1967, Lieutenant Commander Butch Verich, along with two other VF-162 F-8s attacked enemy flak sites ahead of an A-4 strike. Verich's F-8 was hit by a surface-to-air missile, and he ejected over hostile North Vietnamese territory. He landed near the wreck of his burning fighter and evading enemy troops for 15 hours, waiting for rescue and avoiding capture. The SAR effort had been suspended as night came, but soon after dawn F-8s, A-1s, and A-4s arrived as the largest ever naval rescue operation of the Vietnam War.

The helicopter pilot and his crew braved intense enemy fire to finally drag Verich up into the aircraft. It took 20 minutes and three tries to grab the helicopter's rescue sling, but Verich finally grabbed hold. The helicopter pilot, Lieutenant Neil Sparks, received the Navy Cross for his exploit.

Although they have fallen out of favor, diaphones were also used at some fire stations and in other situations where a loud, audible signal was required. Sound of the diaphone at East Brother Island Light, a lighthouse located at Richmond, California. History The diaphone horn was based directly on the organ stop of the same name invented by Robert Hope-Jones, creator of the Wurlitzer organ.Michael Lamm (Winter 2003) \\"Feel the Noise: The art and science of making sound alarming,\\" Invention & Technology, 18 (3) : 22‚Äì27.Seeing the Light: \\"The diaphone fog signal\\" by Jeff Laser Hope-Jones' design was based on a piston that was closed only at its bottom end and had slots, perpendicular to its axis, cut through its sides; the slotted piston moved within a similarly slotted cylinder. Outside of the cylinder was a reservoir of high- pressure air. Initially, high-pressure air would be admitted behind the piston, pushing it forward. When the slots of the piston aligned with those of the cylinder, air passed into the piston, making a sound and pushing the piston back to its starting position, whence the cycle would repeat.For the patents of Hope-Jones' diaphones that were used as foghorns, see: * Hope- Jones, R., \\"Sound-producing apparatus suitable for sirens, organs, etc.,\\" British patent 26,738 (31 Dec. 1901).

A modification of Hope-Jones' design was patented by John Pell Northey, head of the Northey Co. Ltd. of Toronto, Ontario, Canada, which manufactured pumps and small gasoline engines.For further information about John Pell Northey and the Northey Company of Toronto, see: * SmokStak: The Northey Co., Ltd. * Buzzcoil.Brinkster.net/Northey. Northey added a secondary compressed air supply to the piston in order to power it during both its forward and reverse strokes and thus create an even more powerful sound.Northey's patents for diaphones: * John Pell Northey, \\"Sound-producing device suitable for sirens or like instruments,\\" U.S. Patent 736,428 (filed: 22 Nov. 1902; issued: 18 Aug. 1903).

Northey, \\"Sound-producing device,\\" U.S. patent 1,799,387 (filed: 1 March 1929; issued: 7 April 1931). The entire horn apparatus was driven by a compressor. To manufacture the new equipment, Northey set up the Diaphone Signal Co. at Toronto in 1903.Laser, J. Seeing the Light accessed 2008-03-09 It manufactured a range of diaphone models: the large \\"Type F\\", which created a tone of about 250 Hz, found worldwide use as a fog signal, especially in lighthouses. The mechanism of the diaphone created a noticeable low-frequency \\"grunt\\" at the end of each note produced, caused by the piston decelerating as the air supply was cut. As this low-frequency sound could carry further, Northey's son Rodney redesigned the \\"Type F\\" model to sustain the second low tone,Rodney V. Northey, \\"Sound-producing device,\\" U.S. patent 1,844,226 (filed: 27 March 1931; issued 9 February 1932). creating the familiar two-tone fog signal, commonly used in lighthouses and lightvessels in the United States and Canada (as well as in a famous series of radio commercials for Lifebuoy soap). This version, known as the \\"Improved Type F\\" or later as the \\"F2T\\", was particularly common in installations on the West Coast of the United States and in lightvessels. Installations in Europe generally used single-tone diaphones.Fox, F. Diaphone at Douglas Head Lighthouse accessed 2008-03-09 Building housing the two diaphones of Split Rock Lighthouse. Rodney Northey sold the Diaphone Signal Co. in 1932, when it was bought by a Buffalo, New York company, Deck Brothers, working under contract for the United States Lighthouse Service.Laser, J. Seeing the Light accessed 03-09-08. Northey sold the company as he required money to marry his fianc√©e. This company still exists, although it no longer manufactures diaphones. The European manufacturing rights were obtained by Chance Brothers of Birmingham in the United Kingdom, already a major supplier of Fresnel lenses and other equipment to lighthouse authorities. In use, the diaphone was generally found to be reliable and suffered little from wear, as the lightweight piston floated on a cushion of air during oscillation.Renton, A. Lost Sounds: the story of coast fog signals, 2003, p.163 Such wear as did occur tended to happen as a result of the piston becoming loose: as the pistons were custom-madeBringing Back the Sound of San Francisco, Christian Science Monitor, Jul 1983 and the design to some degree affected the individual sound characteristics of the signal, the manufacturers supplied two spare pistons with each diaphone. The majority of diaphone installations were removed or became disused during the 1960s and 1970s. This was partly a result of automation of lighthouses, but it was also found that modern diaphragm horns would produce similar levels of volume to a diaphone while requiring much smaller and less powerful compressors.American Society of Mechanical Engineers, Annual Proceedings of the Diesel and Gas Engine Power Division, V. 33‚Äì34 (1961), p.18 By 1983, the last two-tone \\"F2T\\" type in full-time operation in the United States was at Edgartown, Martha's Vineyard. A few survive in working condition in lighthouses around the world.

Megabazus (), son of Megabates, was a highly regarded Persian general under Darius, of whom he was a first-degree cousin. Most information about him comes from The Histories by Herodotus. Scythian campaign (513 BC) Megabazus led the army of the Great King Darius I in 513 BC on the European Scythian campaign of Darius I. After this had to be discontinued without result, Megabazos was left as commander- in-chief of an 80,000-man army in Europe, with the mission to subjugate the Greek cities on the Hellespont. The Persian troops subjugated gold-rich Thrace after capturing Perinthos, the coastal Greek cities, and defeated the powerful Paeonians, whom he deported to Phrygia. Subjugation of Macedonia Finally, Megabazus sent envoys to Amyntas I, king of Macedon, demanding acceptation of Persian domination, which the Macedonian accepted. Megabazus received the present of \\"Earth and Water\\" from Amyntas, which symbolized submission to the Achaemenid Emperor. Amyntas then acted as hyparch to Darius I. Disagreements came when the members of the Persian delegation insulting the Macedonians by meddling with their wives. Prince Alexander I reacted this by murdering several Persian diplomats and their followers. The conflict was later settled by the marriage of Megabazos' son, Bubares, with the Macedonian princess Gygaia, daughters of Amyntas, possibly as a way of reinforcing the alliance. Bubares was one of the sons of Megabazus. After his return to Asia Minor, Megabazus received the governorship of the province (satrapy) of Hellespontine Phrygia in its capital Daskyleion. Rivality with Histiaeus Megabazus was suspicious of Histiaeus, Tyrant of Miletus, and advised Darius to bring him to Susa to keep a closer eye on him. His suspicions turned out to be true as Histiaeus provoked a revolt in the town he was formally in charge of and later sided with the Greeks against Persia. The successor to Megabazus's command was Otanes (son of Sisamnes). According to Herodotus (Herodotus 6.33) Oebares was a son of Megabazus, and became satrap of Daskyleion (Hellespontine Phrygia) in 493 BC. Megabates was another son of Megabazus. He was a commander of the Achaemenid fleet that sailed against Naxos in 500/499 BC.

Skelton died in Westminster and was buried in St. Margaret's Church, although no trace of the tomb remains. Education Skelton is said to have been educated at Oxford, though it is documented that he studied at Cambridge. He could be the \\"one Scheklton\\" mentioned by William Cole as taking his M.A. degree at Cambridge in 1484, but this is unconfirmed. In 1490, William Caxton, in the preface to The Boke of Eneydos compyled by Vyrgyle, refers to him as though Skelton already had a scholarly reputation when the book was published. \\"But I pray mayster John Skelton,\\" he says, \\"late created poete laureate in the unyversite of Oxenforde, to oversee and correct this sayd booke ... for him I know for suffycyent to expowne and englysshe every dyffyculte that is therin. For he hath late translated the epystlys of Tulle, and the boke of dyodorus siculus, and diverse other works... in polysshed and ornate termes craftely... suppose he hath drunken of Elycons well.\\" The laureateship referred to was a degree in rhetoric. As well as Oxford, in 1493 Skelton received the same honour at Cambridge, and also at Leuven. He found a patron in the pious and learned Countess of Richmond, Henry VII's mother, for whom he wrote Of Mannes Lyfe the Peregrynacioun, a lost translation of Guillaume de Diguileville's \\"P√®lerinage de la vie humaine.\\" An elegy \\"Of the death of the noble prince Kynge Edwarde the forth,\\" included in some of the editions of the Mirror for Magistrates, and another (1489) on the death of Henry Percy, fourth earl of Northumberland, are among his earliest poems. Poet laureate In the last decade of the 15th century he was appointed tutor to Prince Henry (afterwards King Henry VIII of England). He wrote for his pupil a lost Speculum principis, and Erasmus, in 1500, dedicated an ode to the prince speaking of Skelton as \\"unum Britannicarum literarum lumen ac decus.\\" This Latin phrase roughly translates as \\"the one light and glory of British letters.\\" In 1498 he was successively ordained sub-deacon, deacon and priest. He seems to have been imprisoned in 1502, but no reason is known for his disgrace. Two years later he retired from regular court attendance to become rector of Diss, a benefice he retained nominally until his death. Skelton frequently signed himself \\"regius orator\\" and poet-laureate, but there is no record of any emoluments paid in connection with these dignities, although the Abb√© du Resnel, author of \\"Recherches sur les po√®tes couronnez,\\" asserts that he had seen a patent (1513‚Äì1514) in which Skelton was appointed poet-laureate to Henry VIII. As rector of Diss he caused great scandal among his parishioners, who thought him, says Anthony Wood,A. √† Wood (ed. P. Bliss), Athenae Oxonienses, with the Fasti, 3 Vols (F.C. & J. Rivington, etc, London 1813-), I, pp. 49-54, at p. 50 (Google). more fit for the stage than the pew or the pulpit. He was secretly married to a woman who lived in his house, and earned the hatred of the Dominican friars by his fierce satire. He consequently came under the formal censure of Richard Nix, the bishop of the diocese, and appears to have been temporarily suspended. After his death a collection of farcical tales, no doubt chiefly, if not entirely, apocryphal, gathered round his name‚ÄîThe Merie Tales of Skelton. During the rest of the century he figured in the popular imagination as an incorrigible practical joker. His sarcastic wit made him enemies, among them: Sir Christopher Garnesche or Garneys, Alexander Barclay, William Lilly and the French scholar, Robert Gaguin (c. 1425‚Äì1502). With Garneys he engaged in a regular \\"flyting,\\" undertaken, he says, at the king's command, but Skelton's four poems read as if the abuse in them were dictated by genuine anger. Earlier in his career he found a friend and patron in Cardinal Wolsey, and the dedication to the cardinal of his Replycacion is couched in the most flattering terms. But in 1522, when Wolsey in his capacity of Papal legate dissolved convocation at St Paul's, Skelton put in circulation the couplet: > Gentle Paul, laie doune thy sweard > For Peter of Westminster hath shaven thy beard. In Colyn Cloute he incidentally attacked Wolsey in a general satire on the clergy. Speke, Parrot and Why Come Ye nat to Courte? are direct and fierce invectives against the cardinal. To avoid another arrest Skelton took sanctuary in Westminster Abbey. He was kindly received by the abbot, John Islip, who continued to protect him until his death. According to his biographer, Edward Braynewood, Skelton was buried before the high altar of Saint Margaret's Church with this inscription on alabaster: Joannes Skeltonus vates pierius hic situs est (Here lies John Skelton, Pierian bard). His works In his Garlande of Laurell Skelton gives a long list of his works, only a few of which are extant. The garland in question was worked for him in silks, gold and pearls by the ladies of the Countess of Surrey at Sheriff Hutton Castle, where he was the guest of the duke of Norfolk. The composition includes complimentary verses to the various ladies, and a good deal of information about himself. But it is as a satirist that Skelton merits attention. The Bowge of Court is directed against the vices and dangers of court life. He had already in his Boke of the Thre Foles drawn on Alexander Barclay's version of the Narrenschijf of Sebastian Brant, and this more elaborate, imaginative poem belongs to the same class. Skelton, falling into a dream at Harwich, sees a stately ship in the harbour called the Bowge of Court, the owner of which is the \\"Dame Saunce Pere.\\" Her merchandise is Favour; the helmsman Fortune; and the poet, who figures as Drede (modesty), finds on board F'avell (the flatterer), Suspect, Harvy Hafter (the clever thief), Dysdayne, Ryotte, Dyssymuler and Subtylte. These figures explain themselves in turn, until at last Drede, who finds they are secretly his enemies, is about to save his life by jumping overboard, when he wakes with a start. Both poems are written in the seven-lined Rhyme Royal, a Continental verse-form first used in English by Chaucer, but it is in an irregular metre of his own‚Äîknown as \\"Skeltonics\\" ‚Äîthat his most characteristic work was accomplished. The Boke of Phyllyp Sparowe, the lament of Jane Scroop, a schoolgirl in the Benedictine convent of Carrow near Norwich, for her dead bird, was no doubt inspired by Catullus. It is a poem of some 1,400 lines and takes many liberties with the formularies of the church. The digressions are considerable. It depicts Jane as having a wide reading in the romances of Charlemagne, of the Round Table, The Four Sons of Aymon and the \\"Trojan cycle.\\" Skelton finds space to give an opinion of Geoffrey Chaucer, John Gower and John Lydgate. Whether we can equate this opinion, voiced by the character of Jane, with Skelton's own is contentious. It would appear that he seems to have realised Chaucer's value as a master of the English language. Gower's matter was, Jane tells us, \\"worth gold,\\" but his English she regards as antiquated. The verse in which the poem is written, called from its inventor \\"Skeltonical,\\" is here turned entirely to whimsical use. The lines are usually six-syllabled but vary in length, and rhyme in groups of two, three, four and even more. It is not far removed from the old alliterative English verse, and well fitted to be chanted by the minstrels who had sung the old ballads. For its comic admixture of Latin Skelton had abundant example in French and Low Latin macaronic verse. He makes frequent use of Latin and French words to carry out his exacting system of frequently recurring rhymes. This breathless, voluble measure was in Skelton's energetic hands an admirable vehicle for invective, but it easily degenerated into doggerel. By the end of the 16th century he was a \\"rude rayling rimer\\" (Puttenham, Arte of English Poesie), and at the hands of Pope and Warton he fared even worse. His own criticism is a just one: > For though my ryme be ragged, > Tattered and jagged, > Rudely rayne beaten, > Rusty and moughte eaten, > It hath in it some pyth. Colyn Cloute represents the average country man who gives his opinions on the state of the church. It is an indictment of the sins of the clergy before the Reformation. He exposes their greed and ignorance, the ostentation of the bishops and the common practice of simony, taking care to explain the accusations do not include all and that he writes in defence of the church. He repeatedly, indirectly hits at Wolsey in this satire. Speke, Parrot has only been preserved in a fragmentary form, and is very obscure. It was apparently composed at different times, but in the latter part of the composition he openly attacks Wolsey. In Why Come Ye nat to Courte? there is no attempt at disguise. The wonder is not that Skelton had to seek sanctuary, but that he had any opportunity of doing so. He rails at Wolsey's ostentation, at his almost royal authority, his overbearing manner to suitors high and low, and taunts him with his mean extraction. This scathing invective was not allowed to be printed in the cardinal's lifetime, but no doubt widely circulated in manuscript and by repetition. The charge of coarseness regularly brought against Skelton is based chiefly on The Tunnynge of Elynoare Rummynge, a realistic description in the same metre of the drunken women who gathered at a well-known ale-house kept by Elynour Rummynge at Leatherhead, not far from the royal palace of Nonsuch. \\"Skelton Laureate against the Scottes\\" is a fierce song of triumph celebrating the victory of Flodden. \\"Jemmy is ded And closed in led, That was theyr owne Kynge,\\" says the poem; but there was an earlier version written before the news of James IV's death had reached London. This, the earliest singly printed ballad in the language, was entitled A Ballade of the Scottysshe Kynge, and was rescued in 1878 from the wooden covers of a copy of Huon de Bordeaux. \\"Howe the douty Duke of Albany, lyke a cowarde knight\\" deals with the Campaign of 1523, and contains a panegyric of Henry VIII. To this is attached an envoi to Wolsey, but it surely was misplaced, for both satires on the cardinal are of earlier date. Skelton also wrote three plays, only one of which survives. Magnificence is one of the best examples of the morality play. It deals with the same topic as his satires - the evils of ambition. The play's moral, namely \\"how suddenly worldly wealth doth decay,\\" was a favourite with him. Thomas Warton in his History of English Poetry described another piece titled Nigramansir, printed by Wynkyn de Worde in 1504. It deals with simony and the love of money in the church; but no copy is known to exist, and suspicion has been cast on Warton's statement. Illustration of Skelton's hold on public imagination is supplied from the stage. A play (1600) called Scogan and Shelton, by Richard Hathwaye and William Rankins, is mentioned by Henslowe. In Anthony Munday's Downfall of Robert, Earl of Huntingdon, Skelton acts the part of Friar Tuck, and Ben Jonson in his masque, The Fortunate Isles, introduced Skogan and Skelton in like habits as they lived. Very few of Skelton productions are dated; their titles are here necessarily abbreviated. De Worde printed the Bowge of Court twice. Divers Batettys and dyties salacious devysed by Master Shelton Laureat, and Shelton Laureate agaynste a comely Coystroune have no date or printer's name, but are evidently from the press of Richard Pynson, who also printed Replycacion against certain yang scalers, dedicated to Wolsey. The Garlande or Chapelet of Laurell was printed by Richard Faukes (1523); Magnificence, A goodly interlude, probably by John Rastell about 1533, reprinted (1821) for the Roxburghe Club. Hereafter foloweth the Boke of Phyllyp Sparowe was printed by Richard Kele (1550?), Robert Toy, Antony Kitson (1560?), Abraham Veale (1570?), John Walley, John Wyght (1560?). Hereafter foloweth certaine bokes compyled by mayster Shelton ... including \\"Speke, Parrot\\", \\"Ware the Hawke\\", \\"Elynoure Rumpiynge and others\\", was printed by Richard Lant (1550?), John King and Thomas March (1565?), and by John Day (1560). Hereafter foloweth a title boke called Colyn Cloute and Hereafter ... Why Come Ye nat to Courte? were printed by Richard Kele (1550?) and in numerous subsequent editions. Pithy, plesaunt and profitable workes of maister Shelton, Poete Laureate. Nowe collected and newly published was printed in 1568, and reprinted in 1736. A scarce reprint of Filnour Rummin by Samuel Rand appeared in 1624. Five of Skelton's \\"Tudor Portraits\\", including The Tunnying of Elynour Rummyng were set to music by Ralph Vaughan Williams in or around 1935. Although he changed the text to suit his music, the sentiments are well expressed. The four others are \\"My pretty Bess\\", \\"Epitaph of John Jayberd of Diss\\", \\"Jane Scroop (her lament for Philip Sparrow)\\", and \\"Jolly Rutterkin.\\" The music is rarely performed, although it is considered funny, and captures the coarseness of Skelton in an inspired way. See The Poetical Works of John Shelton; with Notes and some account of the author and his writings, by the Rev. Alexander Dyce (2 vols., 1843). A selection of his works was edited by WH Williams (London, 1902).

Prosody (vol. i, 1906); and A Kolbing in the Cambridge History of English Literature (vol. iii, 1909). Family John Skelton's lineage is difficult to prove. Some scholars have thought he may have been related to Sir John Shelton and his children, who also came from Norfolk. Sir John's daughter, Mary Shelton, was a mistress of Henry VIII's during the reign of her cousin, Anne Boleyn. Mary Shelton was the main editor and contributor to the Devonshire MS, a collection of poems written by various members of the court. It is said that several of Skelton's works were inspired by women who were to become mothers to two of Henry VIII's six wives. Elizabeth Boleyn (Howard), Countess of Wiltshire and Ormonde, was said to be so beautiful that Skelton compared her to Cressida. This comparison may have been a double entendre, because Cressida, as depicted by Chaucer in his work Troilus and Criseyde, was notable as a symbol of female inconstancy. A popular but unverifiable legend suggests several poems were inspired by Margery Wentworth; she is noted as one of the women portrayed in Skelton's Garland of Laurels. She also is reported as having an eponymous poem written in her honour by Skelton. Elizabeth was the mother of Anne Boleyn, Henry's second wife; Margery was the mother of his third, Jane Seymour.

The town was known as Inbhir √ôigidh, \\"mouth of the Ugie\\" or Inverugie, in the eastern Gaelic speaking areas.\\" ) is a town in Aberdeenshire, Scotland. It is Aberdeenshire's biggest settlement (the city of Aberdeen itself not being a part of the district), with a population of 18,537 at the 2011 Census. Peterhead has some of the highest levels of deprivation in Aberdeenshire. According to the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation, the town centre is in the bottom 10% of all datazones in Scotland and ranks in the bottom 1% in Scotland for crime and in the bottom 2% for education and achievement. Young people growing up in Peterhead are ten times more likely to end up in prison than those from Ellon. Peterhead sits at the easternmost point in mainland Scotland. It is often referred to as The Blue Toun (locally spelled \\"The Bloo Toon\\") and its natives are known as Blue Touners. They are also referred to as blue mogginers (locally spelled \\"bloomogganners\\"), supposedly from the blue worsted moggins or stockings that the fishermen originally wore. History Peterhead's South Harbour in 2002. This view is looking north to Bridge Street. The Queenie Bridge is also in view Peterhead was founded in 1587 by George Keith, 5th Earl Marischal, and was developed as a planned settlement, then known as \\"Harbour and Barony of Keith Insche commonly called Peterhead\\". The twelve original feuars occupied land along Seagate between the pier of Port Henry, to the north, and the Quinzie (Queenie) to the south. The Queenie was a causeway of boulders, covered only by spring tides, which linked the islands of Keith Inch and Greenhill to the mainland. (Today, the Queenie Bridge, which opened in 1954, connects Bridge Street and Greenhill Road. It replaced a swing bridge which had stood on the site since 1850.)\\"Historic north-east bridge reopens as part of ¬£50million redevelopment\\" - Press & Journal, 20 October 2018 The construction of Port Henry in 1593 encouraged the growth of Peterhead as a fishing port and established a base for trade. (Port Henry Road, running east-west, can be found just north of the harbour, off East North Street.)34-4 Port Henry Road, Peterhead AB42 1LA, UK - Google Maps Port Henry, the oldest of Peterhead's three harbours, was constructed along the Seagate shore by Henry Middleton, under the supervision of Keith. It was protected to the north by the Old Pier, which was erected probably before 1593. The town developed uphill between the shore and Longate, which ‚Äî until the development of Broad Street in the late 18th century ‚Äî was the main historic district of the town. Port Henry was improved in 1631 and repaired before the end of the century and again early in the 18th century. The south pier was increased in height and the west pier was constructed. The southern part was reconstructed between 1775 and 1781 by John Smeaton, with improvements carried out by John Rennie between 1806 and 1810. He also oversaw an addition to the west pier in 1813. By 1680, Charles McKean notes that Peterhead \\"had become one of the best fishings on the north coast\\". On 22 December 1715, James Francis Edward Stuart, Prince of Wales, arrived in Peterhead from Dunkirk and stayed \\"in an ancient house in Longate,\\" where he was visited by the Earl Marischal. The Marischal's last Baron Baillie, Thomas Arbuthnot, put the town on alert for war by summoning able-bodied men and their weapons. The prince left for Newburgh, and the town, by forfeiture of the Keiths, suffered for its loyalty. The Earls Marischal estate was forfeited in 1716, sold to York Buildings Company. In 1775, the \\"feu superior\\", the Merchant Maiden Company of Edinburgh, transferred to the Committee of Feuars of Peterhead the Tollbooth, Tollbooth Green and other sundry land. A new Town Hall building replaced the tollbooth. Meanwhile, the enclosed lands of South Bay were being developed into \\"the beautifully homogeneous district of elegant houses for the accommodation of strangers and sea captains, much of which still survives\\". Fishermen began to move to Roanheads on the north-east shoulder of the peninsula. Roanheads was laid out in today's form by 1771, and some of the few surviving pantiled houses may be original. From 1788, the port developed a speciality in whaling. It eventually became Britain's largest whaling port. In 1815, before the increase in herring popularity, there were 72 vessels registered to Peterhead operating from the port; by 1850 there were over 400. Value of Fish Landed in Peterhead 1893-1914 North Harbour and the dry dock were built by Rennie and Thomas Telford between 1818 and 1822. They were improved fifteen years later. The junction canal was built in 1849, while the south and west piers of North Harbour were built by David Stevenson in 1855. The southern part of North Harbour (Middle Harbour) dates from 1872. It was constructed by David and Thomas Stevenson, with improvements made between 1893 and 1897 by William Shield, a local worker. A lifeboat station was first established in 1865.Brief History of Peterhead Lifeboat Station www.peterheadlifeboat.co.uk, accessed 15 July 2008 Peterhead convict prison was opened in 1888, gaining a reputation as one of Scotland's toughest prisons. South Harbour was deepened between 1906 and 1908. The Harbour of Refuge (Admiralty Backwaters) was begun in 1886 by Sir John Coode. It was built by convict labour. The present harbour, now a Category B listed structure,PETERHEAD HARBOUR LB39733 - Historic Environment Scotland has two massive breakwaters, enclosing an area of approximately in Peterhead Bay. The south breakwater, about long, was constructed in 1892‚Äì1912 using convict labour from the prison.

Sample Chapter Peterhead was a Jacobite-supporting town in the Jacobite risings of 1715 and 1745. In particular, it was one of the Episcopalian north-eastern ports where reinforcements, plus money and equipment, were periodically landed from France during the Forty-Five.C. Duffy, The 45 (2003), p. 352 A new phase of growth was initiated in the 1970s with Peterhead becoming a major oil industry service centre, and the completion of the nearby St Fergus gas terminal. At this time, considerable land holdings were allocated for industrial development. From the 1990s onward, the town has suffered from several high-profile company closures and is facing a number of pressures, including Common Fisheries Policy reforms. However, it retains a relatively diverse economy, including food processing, textiles, service industries and, still importantly, fishing. (Over 163,000 tonnes of fish and shellfish, with a value of around ¬£179m, were landed at Peterhead in 2017, employing around 700 fishermen.)\\"Official labour market statistics - Nomis.co.uk The Peterhead Port Authority plans to extend the northern breakwater as a stimulus to the town's economic development.

A heliport has been set up at the eastern end of the former RAF Buchan air base. Recreational aviation also takes place from a part of a former runway. Between 1952 and 2004 the Royal Air Force station RAF Buchan was located near the town. The radar unit ceased to be a RAF station on 1 September 2004 and was downgraded to a Remote Radar Head named RRH Buchan. =Rail= Peterhead is further from a railway station (at from Aberdeen) than any other town of its size in Great Britain. The town once had two stations, namely Peterhead railway station and Peterhead Docks railway station. Passenger trains on the Formartine and Buchan Railway stopped in 1965 under the Beeching Axe, and freight in 1970. The start of reconstruction of the Borders Railway to Galashiels (early 2013) has begun a local political debate into the possibility of reopening the line from Aberdeen to Fraserburgh and Peterhead.

Their name derives from the eighth stanza of Wallace Stevens' poem Thirteen Ways of Looking at a Blackbird. History Eighth Blackbird was originally formed at the Oberlin Conservatory of Music, while the members were participating in the school's Contemporary Music Ensemble conducted by Tim Weiss. Weiss is consistently credited by ensemble members as helping to form the ensemble and with encouraging them to memorize and choreograph their shows. In 1996, the ensemble won the Fischoff National Chamber Music Competition, a prestigious award given every year to the United States' best chamber ensembles. Two years later, while the members were studying together at the University of Cincinnati College-Conservatory of Music, success at the Concert Artists Guild competition led to the ensemble's first management contract. Since then, the ensemble has gone on to win many prizes and has routinely been hailed by leading critics as forging a pathway for classical music in the twenty-first century. The members of Eighth Blackbird hold degrees in music performance from the United States' leading music schools, including Oberlin Conservatory, the University of Cincinnati College-Conservatory of Music, the Juilliard School, Northwestern University, and the Curtis Institute of Music. Current players in the group include Yvonne Lam, violin/viola; Nicholas Photinos, cello; Nathalie Joachim, flutes; Michael Maccaferri, clarinets; Lisa Kaplan, piano; and Matthew Duvall, percussion. Four of the group's six members are founding members; Joachim replaced flautist Tim Munro in 2015, who replaced the ensemble's original flautist, Molly Barth, in 2006, and Lam replaced violinist and violist Matt Albert in 2011. Collaborations From 2012 to 2015, the group served as ensemble-in- residence at the prestigious Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia. Additionally, the group has led short-term residencies at the UMKC Conservatory of Music and Dance (where it was the Barr Institute Ensemble Laureate), Colburn School, University of Michigan, Oberlin College, Southern Methodist University, Rice University, and the Interlochen Arts Academy. In 2015 the group engaged as Artist-in-Residence at the Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago, rehearsing and conducting daily business on the third floor galleries. An ongoing relationship with Chicago's Cedille Records has produced six recordings, all of which have garnered critical acclaim. Three of these recordings have won Grammy awards: 2006's strange imaginary animals won two 2008 Grammy Awards, including the award for Best Chamber Music Performance. Lonely Motel: Music from Slide won in 2009 and features excerpts from the music and theater work Slide, a collaboration between Eighth Blackbird, composer Steve Mackey, and singer, actor, and librettist Rinde Eckert. Meanwhile, an album featuring Stephen Hartke's piece of the same name, won a Grammy in 2011. Since its founding in 1996, Eighth Blackbird has been active in commissioning new works from composers such as Steve Reich, David Lang, George Perle, Frederic Rzewski, Joseph Schwantner, Paul Moravec, and Stephen Hartke, as well as works from Jennifer Higdon, Derek Bermel, Nico Muhly, Bryce Dessner, David Little, Daniel Kellogg, Carlos Sanchez-Gutierrez, and the Minimum Security Composers Collective. The group received the first BMI/Boudleaux-Bryant Fund Commission and the 2007 American Music Center Trailblazer Award and has received grants from BMI, Meet the Composer, the Greenwall Foundation, and Chamber Music America. In June 2009, Eighth Blackbird served as Music Director of the Ojai Music Festival in Southern California. In February 2011, Eighth Blackbird curated the Tune-In Music Festival at the Park Avenue Armory in New York City. The group devised a program which centered around Igor Stravinsky's controversial statement that music was, \\"essentially powerless to express anything at all,\\" and culminated in the indoor premier of John Luther Adams' monumental percussion work Inuksuit. In 2012, the group also developed the Metropolis New Music Festival in Melbourne, Australia, which featured Steve Reich as its composer-in- residence. Demonstrating its flair for combining musical and theatrical elements in its performances, Eighth Blackbird has also created an original cabaret-opera style staging of Arnold Schoenberg's seminal work Pierrot Lunaire, which the group performs entirely from memory and a fully staged, evening-length work by Amy Beth Kirsten entitled Colombine‚Äôs Paradise Theatre.

San Jose IslandUnited States Board on Geographic Names, 1973 decision, cited in USGS Geographic Names Information System or San Jos√© Island (also known as Saint Joseph Island) is a barrier island on the Gulf Coast of Texas in the United States. The island is about 21 miles (34 km) long and 5 miles (8 km) wide. The island is oriented generally northeast- southwest, with the Gulf of Mexico on the east and south, Aransas Bay on the west, and Mesquite Bay on the north. At the southern end of the island is Aransas Pass (not to be confused with the City of Aransas Pass which is on the mainland), beyond which is Mustang Island and the town of Port Aransas. Aransas Pass is protected by jetties extending into the Gulf from both Mustang Island and San Jos√© Island. The island's northern end used to be separated from Matagorda Island by Cedar Bayou. Cedar Bayou does not run freely through the two islands any longer. History On July 26, 1845, Lt. Chandler of the USS Alabama waded ashore and planted the first American flag to fly over Texas territory on a sand dune on San Jose Island. Units of the Third Infantry established a small military town known as Aransas. A stagecoach service brought passengers, goods and mail to the town, and a ferry connected the island with the mainland. During the American Civil War, the Union Army removed livestock from the island and assaulted the town of Aransas, of which no obvious trace today remains. After the war, the island's sole town ceased to exist, and it became an exclusive hunting and fishing resort. It was purchased by Texas oilman Sid W. Richardson and used as his private island. On it he built a lavish hunting lodge at great expense, to which prominent businessmen and politicians, including then Senator Lyndon B. Johnson and President Franklin D. Roosevelt, were invited.Caro, Robert A. (1982). The Years of Lyndon Johnson: Master of the Senate. New York: Knopf. p. 304-5. .

Merrie Melodies animated short directed by Chuck Jones. The short was released on November 30, 1963, and stars Bugs Bunny. It was the last original Bugs Bunny short Jones made for Warner Bros. Cartoons before Jones left for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer to found his own studio, Sib Tower 12 Productions. It was his second-to-last cartoon at Warner Bros. before moving to MGM, and the second-to-last Warner cartoon in 1963. Bugs demonstrates how to handle a pesky vampire with six simple magic incantations. The title is a pun on \\"Pennsylvania 6-5000\\", a song associated with Glenn Miller and referring to the now-archaic system of telephone exchange names where the first two characters of a telephone number were expressed as letters: \\"Transylvania 6-5000\\" stands for \\"TR 6-5000\\" which devolves to . Plot Bugs is traveling by tunneling underground‚Äîand runs straight into a tree. He heads for Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, as he observes \\"these Pennsylvania hardwoods ain't too soft!\\", but he does not immediately notice that a sign nailed to the tree reads \\"Pittsburghe, Transylvania\\". He asks a two-headed female vulture (Agatha and Emily) for directions to \\"Pittsboig\\" when he realizes that he has not reached the Steel City, but Agatha and Emily are too busy talking about eating him. Bugs leaves them to it, sees an old castle nearby, mistakes it for a motel and calmly approaches it. Upon ringing a skull/chime doorbell (playing \\"The Hearse Song\\") Bugs meets a vampire, who introduces himself as Count Blood Count and invites him in. Although Bugs is only looking for a telephone to call his travel agency, the Count leads him to a guest room beckoning him to rest, informing him that \\"Rest is good for the blood.\\". Unable to sleep, Bugs picks up a book titled Magic Words and Phrases, and despite his initial skepticism about their effect, he reads it. The Count sneaks up behind him and is just about to strike when Bugs says \\"abracadabra\\", turning the Count into a bat. Bugs mistakes the bat/Count for a big mosquito and clobbers him with a fly swatter. As the bat dizzily flies out of the window, Bugs says \\"hocus pocus\\", which turns the Count back into a vampire and causes him to fall into the moat surrounding his castle. Agatha and Emily wonder what a splendid-looking specimen the Count is as they watch him take the plunge. Shortly afterward, while Bugs is searching for the house restaurant, the Count sneaks up from behind again, but Bugs is humming to the tune of \\"It's Magic\\", substituting \\"abracadabra\\" for some of the lyrics, and inadvertently turns the Count back into a bat. Once again mistaking the bat for a mosquito, Bugs sprays the bat with a fumigator. As the bat/Count is hanging his head down from an archway, coughing insecticide out of his lungs, Bugs sings \\"hocus pocus\\" during a continuation of his song, and the Count crashes to the floor on his head. Fed up with the situation, the Count confronts Bugs and reveals his true identity as a vampire, resulting in a duel of \\"magic phrases\\" in which Bugs transforms into a baseball umpire. He then turns himself into a baseball bat when the count turns himself into a bat (with \\"hocus pocus\\" strangely enough) to hit the bat-vampire on the head (despite the Count putting on glasses in a futile attempt to keep Bugs from doing so). Bugs gets the best of the Count for the rest of the duel by saying \\"abracadabra\\" every time the vampire says \\"hocus pocus\\", causing him to be crushed repeatedly by a stone slab from the floor that the Count intended to crush Bugs with. By mixing the magic words to \\"abraca-pocus\\" and \\"hocus-cadabra\\", Bugs causes the Count to become a mixture of human and bat body parts. Afterward he uses \\"Newport News\\" and turns him into Witch Hazel. Unimpressed (\\"Wow, I can do better than that\\"), he uses the incantation \\"Walla Walla, Washington\\", and the Count is turned into a two- headed male vulture. Bugs calls out to Agatha and Emily, and the Count soon finds himself the object of their romantic intentions. The Count flees the castle with the female vulture in amorous pursuit as Bugs watches in amusement. Bugs finally finds a working pay phone (in a coffin), but while waiting for the operator to reach his travel agency in Perth Amboy, he mumbles \\"abraca-pocus\\", and his ears turn into bat wings. Bugs tells the operator to cancel the call, hangs up, and decides to fly home with his new wings.

Count Blood Count also appeared in the Tiny Toon Adventures episode \\"Stuff that Goes Bump in the Night\\" in the segment \\"Fang You Very Much,\\" where he is adopted by Elmyra Duff while disguised as a bat. In this, the Count repeatedly tries to bite Elmyra in his vampire form, but any time the Count is exposed to light, he turns back into a bat. The Tiny Toons version of the Count also appears as a boss character in the video game Tiny Toon Adventures: Buster Busts Loose!. The song \\"Dracula\\" by Gorillaz, a bonus track on their eponymous debut album, samples portions of the short where the Count states \\"I am a vampire!\\" and \\"rest is good for the blood\\". Portions of the cartoon were used in the compilation film Bugs Bunny's Howl- Oween Special. Before the footage of the cartoon began, Witch Hazel is transformed into Count Blood Count by some Hyde formula that Bugs brought with him, so when Bugs uses the phrase \\"Newport News,\\" she remains as Witch Hazel. Most of the cartoon was used in Daffy Duck's Quackbusters, but some dialogue was redubbed to connect it to the film's main story. Also, the end was changed so that instead of Bugs sprouting bat wings and flying away, he reports his findings to Daffy Duck (although he still sings \\"abraca-pocus\\" to himself while in the coffin phone-booth, but the film cuts away before his ears transform), who is displeased to hear from him (saying \\"What do you think we're running here, a matrimonial agency?!\\"). Later, Bugs is seen leaving the castle from the cartoon before he answers a nearby payphone as part of the link to the cartoon The Abominable Snow Rabbit. Count Blood Count appeared in The Sylvester and Tweety Mysteries episode \\"Fangs for the Memories\\". He was voiced by Corey Burton. Count Blood Count also appears in Looney Tunes Collector: Alert! as a boss character. After the player defeats him, he decides to become an NPC ally of Bugs to find some opportunities in blood.

It sits at the Franco-Swiss frontier, and is administratively divided into Saint-Gingolph, Switzerland and Saint-Gingolph, Haute-Savoie (France). Its name is derived from the eighth-century saint Gangulphus, who is said to have lived as a hermit in this region.San Gengolfo Its division at the Morge dates from 1569: as the municipal Web site Communes De Saint-Gingolph Au Bord Du Lac Leman (Suisse Et France) explains, it is one town consisting of a single parish (the church and cemetery are on the French side) with two municipal administrations and two distinct legal systems. Saint-Gingolph is located a short distance from √âvian-les-Bains, Monthey and Montreux. It is accessible by road, rail or boat. Built on an alluvial cone of the Morge, a frontier mountain stream, St. Gingolph is surrounded by mountains and has approximately 8 km of shore-line alongside the lake. History The town played an important role during the World War II when Haute Savoie was occupied first by the Italian and then by the Nazi German Armed Forces. The fact of large-scale intermarriage and business and family connections across the frontier made it possible for the Resistance to smuggle goods, arms and refugees (including many French Jews) across the border, often using a secret tunnel (no longer in existence; it was actually a drainage pipe) located near the lake. These stories are documented in a book privately published in 1994 by the late Andr√© Z√©noni, \\"Saint-Gingolph et sa r√©gion fronti√®re dans la R√©sistance 1940-1945\\". (Intermarriage across the frontier is less frequent in the modern age because there are separate primary schools (\\"L'Ecole Andr√© Z√©noni\\" on the French side) and French lyc√©ens are bussed to Evian, while Swiss students take the train to Monthey. Thereafter, each tend to seek employment in their own country. In any case, the town is so small that there are only two or three weddings recorded in a year.) Transport The Swiss railway line from St Maurice and Martigny terminates at Saint-Gingolph (Switzerland), the French line from Evian to Saint-Gingolph having been abandoned in the late 1980s. There is now discussion of resuscitating the line by 2012;Association Sauvons le Tonkin  Ligne ferroviaire Evian - St-Gingolph this has been mentioned in the Swiss and French press but the outlook, according to Swiss railway workers, is dubious.

Along the way, they encounter other horror film staples ‚Äî a mummy, a werewolf, a vampire ‚Äî each with a twist. Written and directed by Rudy De Luca, the film stars Jeff Goldblum, Ed Begley Jr., Joseph Bologna, and Geena Davis. Notable other cast include Michael Richards, Carol Kane, Teresa Ganzel, John Byner, and Jeffrey Jones. The title is a pun on \\"Pennsylvania 6-5000\\", a song made famous by Glenn Miller. Plot Jack Harrison (Jeff Goldblum) and Gil Turner (Ed Begley Jr.) are writers for The Sensation, a supermarket-grade tabloid run by Turner's father, Mac Turner (Norman Fell). Jack is a more serious journalist, using The Sensation as a stepping stone to a better career and aspires to work for Time Magazine, while Gil is a gangling yes-man, ever ready to win his father's approval. When Mac receives a homemade videotape of two panicked men running from a creature they believe to be Frankenstein's monster, along with a waist-down shot of the suspected monster, he dispatches his son and Jack to Transylvania to follow the lead. Jack tries unsuccessfully to beg off, but is told by Mac that if they both again come back with nothing, they are both fired. They have to bring a story that will bring a banner headline \\"Frankenstein Lives!\\" Planes, trains and buses later, Jack and Gil arrive at their destination. Once off the bus, Jack immediately spots Elizabeth Ellison, a pretty female tourist (Teresa Ganzel) from New York City, whom he propositions. Gil immediately sets out on their assignment, just as quickly drawing hysterical ridicule when he tries to question a hotel desk clerk about the whereabouts of Frankenstein, who shares Gil's inquiries with the staff and patrons, including the mayor Lepescu (Jeffrey Jones). Jack rescues Gil and pulls him out of the hotel to avoid further embarrassment. Both then take off for their hotel. Seeing them leave, a gypsy woman named Madame Morovia (Inge Appelt) orders her male companion to bring them to her. Jack and Gil arrive at their hotel, which resembles a 17th- century castle, complete with a gated entrance, but adorned with an \\"Opening Soon!\\" banner and signs denoting the acceptance of credit cards. They are met at the gate by Fejos (Michael Richards), a butler with an odd sense of humor. They meet for brunch with Lepescu, where they also meet Radu (John Byner), his hunched-over manservant who addresses everyone as \\"master\\" and his wife Lupi (Carol Kane). Both Gil and Jack learn that something is amiss about Transylvania, despite being laughed off by the locals, including Inspector Percek (Bo≈æidar Smiljaniƒá), head of the local police. After meeting Morovia, who tells them they must continue their pursuit, they encounter a series of real-life horror creatures, including a Wolfman Larry (Donald Gibb), a nymphomaniac vampire Odette (Geena Davis), and a swamp monster Twisto that grabs Gil by the crotch as he tries to escape a frightening face-to-face confrontation with the object of their mission himself. They eventually learn of a Sicilian doctor, Victorio Malavaqua (Joseph Bologna), who lost his license to practice medicine. Finding out that Malavaqua has been giving care in a sanitorium, Gil tries to go there to make an appointment but is rebuffed by the guard. Gil eventually sneaks in and finds Percek and Malavaqua talking about the latter's \\"experiments\\", including one involving a patient, Kurt Hunyadi, that fits the description of the Frankenstein monster, which Malavaqua claimed had died. An exhumation of the body later proves otherwise. Gil learns that Radu is in cahoots with Malavaqua, serving as his lab assistant. Malavaqua also displays a tendency towards madness when within the confines of his laboratory, but returns to normal when he leaves it. It is later revealed, as Gil and Jack go on a search for Elizabeth's missing daughter Laura, that not only has Malavaqua faked Hunyadi's death, but is also his creator, along with that of Odette, Larry, and Twisto. It is also revealed that Malavaqua has engaged in this type of bizarre work to clear his family's name. The story ties together after Jack is attacked by the Wolfman. In an attempt to rescue Jack, Gil pulls him off Jack, only to be carted off by the Wolfman. The police arrive, but refuse to listen to Jack's story and order him put in the local police lockup. Elizabeth rescues him and learns that the entire police force is at the wine festival instead of searching for her missing daughter. Jack heads off to Malavaqua's lab and Elizabeth goes to the festival. As she is being hauled away by police after confronting Percek, the town is horrified as the monster returns in the flesh, carrying Laura in his arms. Perceived to be dead, it is later learned she was just sleeping. Jack and Gil arrive, having confronted Malavaqua, and explain Malavaqua's actions to the townspeople, that Malavaqua was legitimately trying to create normal lives for those seen as outcasts or freaks by the townspeople, who now welcome them with open arms. Finding out that the story is even bigger than what they bargained for, Gil takes enough pictures and both gather enough material to last weeks for the tabloid. They more than make up for their failures and Mac gets his banner headline.

Percek Production According to the DVD commentary from director Rudy De Luca, most of the movie was filmed on location in Yugoslavia, using local actors. De Luca also mentioned in the commentary that it was the tallest cast he had ever worked with, with Goldblum, Begley, Jones, Davis, Gibb, and Richards all standing over six feet tall. The movie was financed by Dow Chemical Company, a company rarely associated with film making. Yugoslav law at the time prevented the company from repatriating funds that it had accumulated in the Yugoslav dinar. To free these frozen funds, Dow decided to use them to pay for a film production inside the country. Release The film was released theatrically in the United States by New World Pictures on November 8, 1985. It grossed $2,507,542 for the weekend, finishing in fifth place. Overall, it grossed $7,196,872 at the United States and Canada box office against a $3 million budget. It received mainly negative reviews from critics. The film scores an 18% with 11 ratings at Rotten Tomatoes. Entertainment Tonight critic Leonard Maltin gave a notable one-word review of the film.

The most common causes of this damage are stroke, brain tumor, and trauma.Hemianopia (Hemianopsia) , helpforvisionloss.com This article deals only with permanent hemianopsia, and not with transitory or temporary hemianopsia, as identified by William Wollaston PRS in 1824. Temporary hemianopsia can occur in the aura phase of migraine.  Etymology  Paris as seen with full visual fields. The word hemianopsia is from Greek origins, where: * hemi means \\"half\\", * an means \\"without\\", and * opsia means \\"seeing\\".  Types  When the pathology involves both eyes, it is either homonymous or heteronymous. = Homonymous hemianopsia = Paris as seen with left homonymous hemianopsia. A homonymous hemianopsia is the loss of half of the visual field on the same side in both eyes. The visual images that we see to the right side travel from both eyes to the left side of the brain, while the visual images we see to the left side in each eye travel to the right side of the brain. Therefore, damage to the right side of the posterior portion of the brain or right optic tract can cause a loss of the left field of view in both eyes. Likewise, damage to the left posterior brain or left optic radiation can cause a loss of the right field of vision.\\"eye, human.\\" Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Ultimate Reference Suite. Chicago: Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, 2010.Paris as seen with binasal hemianopsia. = Heteronymous hemianopsia = Paris as seen with bitemporal hemianopsia. A heteronymous hemianopsia is the loss of half of the visual field on different sides in both eyes. It is separated into two categories: * Binasal hemianopsia ‚Äì the loss of the fields surrounding the nose; * Bitemporal hemianopsia ‚Äì the loss of the fields closest to the temples. = Other forms = *Superior hemianopsia ‚Äì the upper half of the field of vision is affected, possibly because of a tumor beginning to compress the lower part of the chiasma, typically one from the hypophysis. *Inferior hemianopsia ‚Äì the lower half of the field of vision is affected, possibly because of a tumor beginning to compress the upper part of the chiasma, typically a craniopharyngioma. = Quadrantanopia = Superior right quadrantanopia. Quadrantanopia (quadrantanopsia or quadrantic hemianopsia) is decreased vision or blindness in one quarter of the visual field. The particular quarter of vision missing depends on whether the location of the brain damage is temporal or parietal, and the side of the lesion. For example, a lesion to the right temporal lobe with damage specifically to Meyer's loop will give rise to a left upper (superior) quadrantanopsia, while a lesion to the right parietal radiation with damage specifically to Baum's loop will result in a left lower (inferior) quadrantanopsia.Toronto Notes 2011, pg. N21  Visual neglect  Visual neglect (also called hemispatial neglect or unilateral spatial neglect) differs from hemianopsia in that it is an attentional deficit rather than a visual one. Unlike patients with hemianopsia who actually don't see, those with visual neglect have no trouble seeing but are impaired in attending to and processing the visual information they receive. Whereas hemianopsia can be assuaged by allowing patients to move their eyes around a visual scene (ensuring that the entire scene makes it into their intact visual field), neglect cannot. Neglect can also apply to auditory or tactile stimuli and can even leave a patient unaware of one side of his or her own body. Ellis and Young (1998) showed that neglect can also affect patients' mental maps such that if they are asked to picture themselves standing in a familiar location and name the buildings around them, they will neglect to name the buildings on their impaired side but will be able to name them when asked to mentally face the opposite direction.Ellis, A. W. & Young, A. W. (1988). Human cognitive neuropsychology. Hove, UK: Erlbaum. Visual Extinction and Unilateral Neglect & Denial (pp. 76-79). Some patients with neglect also have hemianopsia, however the two often occur independent of one another.  Management  Some forms of hemianopia can be treated through repeated presentations of multisensory stimuli due to the process of multisensory integration occurring in the superior colliculus. Surgical interventions have also been shown to ameliorate certain forms of hemianopia due to counterbalancing brain lesions due to a process known as the Sprague effect.

History The first Horsham Football Club was founded in 1871, though its existence largely depended upon enough players being available to form a side. In 1881 the club was firmly re- established, playing its first game against Dorking, and, in September 1882, helped found the Sussex County Football Association, with club official A. R. Bostock becoming one of three original Vice Presidents. Horsham became founder members of the West Sussex Football League in 1896. They went on to win the West Sussex League championship in 1899-00, 1900‚Äì01 and 1901‚Äì02, and claimed the Royal Irish Rifles Cup in 1900 by defeating the champions of the East Sussex Senior League, Hastings. After having played at both Hurst Park and Springfield Park, the club secured Queen Street as its permanent home in 1904, but some lean form over the ensuing years saw Horsham overlooked when the Sussex County League was created in 1920. The club eventually became members of that competition after winning the West Sussex Senior League for the fourth time in 1925‚Äì26. This was a golden age for the club and the County League was won in 1932, 1933, 1935, 1936, 1937 and 1938, with the team regularly scoring over one hundred goals a season. The Sussex RUR Cup was taken in 1931, 1932, 1934, 1935, 1936, 1937 and 1938, and the Sussex Senior Cup in 1934 and 1939. After the break brought on by hostilities, Horsham won the first post-war title in 1947, the RUR Cup in 1946, 1949 and 1951, and the Sussex Senior Cup in 1950. In 1947‚Äì48 Horsham reached the First Round Proper of the FA Cup for the first time, taking a first-minute lead against Tommy Lawton's Notts County, before losing 9‚Äì1. For many years Horsham had been looking to test themselves at a higher level but had seentheir annual applications to join the Athenian League come to nothing. In 1951 the club changed tack and successfully applied to become members of the Metropolitan League where they were champions at the first attempt. In 1957, however, after finishing bottom of the table, they stepped down to the Corinthian League. In 1963 this league was disbanded, and Horsham were finally able to join the Athenian League. In 1966 they reached the First Round proper of the FA Cup for a second time after defeating Hastings United 2‚Äì1 in the 4th Qualifying Round. Horsham played Swindon Town in front of a crowd of 7,134 at Queen Street. Although they lost 0‚Äì3, the day was a 'red letter day' for the club. A special temporary stand was erected at the Queen St end of the ground for the match.Horsham .v. Swindon Town Souvenir Programme 1 shilling 26 November 1966 In 1973, Horsham joined the Isthmian League when it expanded to two divisions. They enjoyed little success during the 1980s and early 1990s, finishing bottom of the entire league in 1993‚Äì94, but began to turn their fortunes around with a Division Three championship win in 1995‚Äì96. In 2001‚Äì02 they finished second in Division Two and were promoted to Division One South and in 2005‚Äì06 a second- place finish in that division, finishing 2nd behind champions Ramsgate on goal difference, saw them promoted to the Premier Division for the first time. That same season, Horsham reached the final of the Sussex Senior Cup for the first time since 1979, but were beaten by Lewes 3‚Äì1 after extra-time. Their first ever season in the Premier Division, in 2006‚Äì07, saw the Hornets finish in eighth and a promotion challenge in 2007‚Äì08 again fell away to see the club end up eleventh. However, the team beat Maidenhead United 4‚Äì1 to reach the Second Round Proper of the FA Cup for the first time where two matches were played against eventual League One champions, Swansea City. Having sold their ground for redevelopment at the end of the season, Horsham played at Worthing during 2008‚Äì09 and reached the 4th Qualifying Round of the FA Cup where they took Conference side Stevenage Borough to a replay before ending an injury- ravaged year in thirteenth place. Season 2009‚Äì10 found the club back in Horsham, having entered into a groundshare agreement with their old neighbours Horsham YMCA as their quest for a new ground continued. Financial cutbacks at the end of the 2010‚Äì11 campaign, during which they finished only 6 points clear of possible relegation back to Division One, saw Horsham part company with long serving manager John Maggs after 11 years in charge. Former Faversham Town manager, Justin Luchford, was appointed as his replacement in June 2011 but left the role in late October 2011 and was replaced by assistant, Hugo Langton. A lack of improvement in results, during which the club failed to win any of their 19 league games, saw Langton replaced by former Worthing boss Simon Colbran in March 2012 but he was unable to prevent the side from returning to Division One South. A season of stability followed, with the Hornets ending the campaign in fifteenth and claiming the Brighton Charity Cup for a second successive season2nd Yellow but Colbran resigned his post in November 2013 with the club in 18th position. His departure led to the popular appointment of Horsham born Gary Charman, some fifteen years after making the first of more than 550 appearances for his hometown club. Charman steered the club to 16th place but a poor run of results the following season led to him being replaced by two more former players, Anthony Storey and Cliff Cant, in January 2015. Despite some impressive initial results, the pair were unable to save the club from relegation so former East Preston manager Dominic di Paola was appointed towards the end of the campaign with a view to rebuilding a side capable of competing in the Sussex County League for the first time since 1951. After a season-long battle with Eastbourne Town, Horsham took the title by eleven points to secure a record-equalling eighth County League title, thus securing an immediate return to the Isthmian League. During that 2015/16 campaign, the club recorded a club record ninety-seven points whilst conceding the fewest goals in their history (twenty-two). After a slow start to the 2016/17 campaign, in which just three of the first thirteen matches were won, the Hornets recovered to finish in a not unsatisfactory sixteenth place in Division One South. Off the pitch the club finally got the news it longed for when, on 21 March 2017, a revised ground application was submitted and overwhelmingly approved by HDC, meaning work could finally begin on constructing a new community stadium off the Worthing Road. With the arrangement at YMCA having come to an end, Horsham moved into the Sussex FA Headquarters at Lancing's Culver Road in the summer of 2017 but a crippling injury list put paid to any pre-season expectations of improving the club's position, with the low point of the season coming in an 8-0 reverse at Cray Wanderers in what is the club's heaviest ever FA Trophy defeat. Yet that result proved the catalyst for the side to kick on and only six of the next nineteen matches ended in defeat, a run that lifted Horsham to eleventh in the table, only to fall away again in the closing months of the season before ending in fifteenth spot, one better than the previous year. Hopes that the club might start the 2018-19 campaign in the new ground went unfulfilled but the disappointment did not seem to affect the players who turned Culver Road into something of a fortress, losing just four matches in all competitions - two of them to higher-league opponents Bath City and Eastbourne Borough. Overdue runs to the latter stages of the qualifying rounds in both the FA Cup and FA Trophy bred confidence that was transferred into their league form and, from early December, the Hornets never dropped below fourth place, finally finishing as runners-up to Cray Wanderers. With automatic promotion the right of only the champions, Horsham faced a play-off semi-final clash with Haywards Heath Town - the only side to have recorded a league double over them during the campaign - and duly won 3-0 to set up a home final with Ashford United. After a tense tie, played in front of over eight hundred spectators, Horsham won through 2-1 after extra-time to return to the Premier Division after an absence of seven years. The death of President Frank King in May 2019 meant that he tragically missed seeing his beloved Hornets finally take ownership of its new ground, just a few weeks after his death. His name, however, will live on through the decision to dedicate the club's new boardroom in his memory. =2007-08 FA Cup run= Horsham's FA Cup run started with a 7‚Äì1 defeat of Arundel in the 1st qualifying round and in the 2nd they came from 2‚Äì0 down to beat Bury Town 3‚Äì2. After a goalless draw at Kingsmeadow Horsham then saw off AFC Wimbledon 5‚Äì4 on penalties in a 3rd qualifying round replay before booking their place in the First Round Proper for only the third time in their history with a 3‚Äì2 win at Chippenham Town. Horsham drew Maidenhead United of the Conference South at home and, in front of a crowd of 3,379, Horsham won 4‚Äì1 with goals from Nigel Brake, Lee Carney (2) and Lee Farrell, with Brake's long-range goal nominated in Match of the Day's goal of the month competition. Horsham then drew Swansea City in the 2nd Round, holding the then League One leaders to a 1‚Äì1 draw at Queen Street on 30 November 2007 when an 85th-minute penalty from Lewis Taylor cancelled out Guillem Bauz√†'s 41st-minute opener.Match details Their replay at Swansea was played on 10 December 2007, the first ever FA Cup tie to be held at the Liberty Stadium, and a shock result was on the cards when Lee Farrell scored twice to put Horsham 2‚Äì1 ahead but Swansea recovered to win the tie 6‚Äì2. Both matches against Swansea were shown live on Sky Sports, the first time in the club's history that a match had been televised live. Ground The club sold their ground at Queen Street, which had been their home since 1904, to property developers and moved out in 2008. A two-season groundshare with Worthing was terminated after one season. The club hoped to return to Horsham and build a new ground in Holbrook, North Horsham, but despite the club having bought the site, planning permission was refused at a council meeting held on 1 July 2008.West Sussex County Times The club withdrew their appeal against the decision on 15 April 2009, and turned their focus instead to building a new ground at the \\"Hop Oast\\" area to the south of Horsham. The initial proposal, which would have seen the installation of two 3G pitches and a two- storey clubhouse, returned a majority verdict of 13-9 in favour of rejecting the application at a council hearing on 20 Jan 2015, citing issues such as safety concerns and the perceived construction of a 'business in the countryside', despite the site already hosting a golf club and fitness centre. On 21 March 2017 the submission of a revised plan for a reduced capacity of 1,300 spectators and a single-storey clubhouse was overwhelmingly accepted by 19 votes to 1. A separate application to sell off part of The Holbrook Club site for housing to help finance the building of the new ground, as well as securing the long term future of the Sports Club, was also passed. With Horsham YMCA announcing their intention to end the groundshare arrangement at the end of the 2016-17 season, Horsham FC signed a contract to play their home matches at the headquarters of the Sussex FA at Culver Road, Lancing, an arrangement that lasted for two seasons while the new ground was built. Following its completion in June 2019, a minimum three-year sponsorship deal was agreed with Camping World for naming rights. The first match at The Camping World Community Stadium was played on 13 July 2019, a friendly fixture versus Hartley Wintney, with the official opening of the stadium taking place a week later when Crawley Town were the visitors.

Davis and Moore synthesize Durkheim and Parsons to argue for the \\"functional necessity\\" of some positions over others: those that are highest paid go to the most deserving individuals; at the same time, the differential rewards motivates individuals to work to fill positions they might otherwise not. Thus, from this perspective, illness is a deviant state because it means that the individual may not be able to fill their role.

For a process in a discrete state space a population continuous time Markov chain or Markov population model is a process which counts the number of objects in a given state (without rescaling). In mean field theory, limit theorems (as the number of objects becomes large) are considered and generalise the central limit theorem for empirical measures. Applications of the theory of empirical processes arise in non-parametric statistics. Definition For X1, X2, ... Xn independent and identically-distributed random variables in R with common cumulative distribution function F(x), the empirical distribution function is defined by :F_n(x)=\\\\frac{1}{n}\\\\sum_{i=1}^n I_{(-\\\\infty,x]}(X_i), where IC is the indicator function of the set C. For every (fixed) x, Fn(x) is a sequence of random variables which converge to F(x) almost surely by the strong law of large numbers. That is, Fn converges to F pointwise. Glivenko and Cantelli strengthened this result by proving uniform convergence of Fn to F by the Glivenko‚ÄìCantelli theorem. A centered and scaled version of the empirical measure is the signed measure :G_n(A)=\\\\sqrt{n}(P_n(A)-P(A)) It induces a map on measurable functions f given by :f\\\\mapsto G_n f=\\\\sqrt{n}(P_n-P)f=\\\\sqrt{n}\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{n}\\\\sum_{i=1}^n f(X_i)-\\\\mathbb{E}f\\\\right) By the central limit theorem, G_n(A) converges in distribution to a normal random variable N(0, P(A)(1 ‚àí P(A))) for fixed measurable set A. Similarly, for a fixed function f, G_nf converges in distribution to a normal random variable N(0,\\\\mathbb{E}(f-\\\\mathbb{E}f)^2), provided that \\\\mathbb{E}f and \\\\mathbb{E}f^2 exist. Definition :\\\\bigl(G_n(c)\\\\bigr)_{c\\\\in\\\\mathcal{C}} is called an empirical process indexed by \\\\mathcal{C}, a collection of measurable subsets of S. :\\\\bigl(G_nf\\\\bigr)_{f\\\\in\\\\mathcal{F}} is called an empirical process indexed by \\\\mathcal{F}, a collection of measurable functions from S to \\\\mathbb{R}. A significant result in the area of empirical processes is Donsker's theorem. It has led to a study of Donsker classes: sets of functions with the useful property that empirical processes indexed by these classes converge weakly to a certain Gaussian process. While it can be shown that Donsker classes are Glivenko‚ÄìCantelli classes, the converse is not true in general. Example As an example, consider empirical distribution functions. For real-valued iid random variables X1, X2, ..., Xn they are given by :F_n(x)=P_n((-\\\\infty,x])=P_nI_{(-\\\\infty,x]}. In this case, empirical processes are indexed by a class \\\\mathcal{C}=\\\\\\\\{(-\\\\infty,x]:x\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}\\\\\\\\}. It has been shown that \\\\mathcal{C} is a Donsker class, in particular, :\\\\sqrt{n}(F_n(x)-F(x)) converges weakly in \\\\ell^\\\\infty(\\\\mathbb{R}) to a Brownian bridge B(F(x)) .

He was also used as a running back and wide receiver. He played college football at UCLA, then 18 seasons as a professional. In 1964, while playing running back for the 49ers, Kilmer played a supporting role in one of the most infamous incidents in gridiron history: Vikings defensive lineman Jim Marshall ran Kilmer's fumble back 66 yards into the wrong end zone. Early life Born in Topeka, Kansas, Kilmer was raised in southern California and played baseball, football, and basketball at Citrus Union High School in Azusa, scoring more than 1,500 points in the latter sport while earning All-American honors. His baseball exploits saw him win all-conference accolades, while the poor fortunes of his football squad saw him relegated to third team all-conference recognition. College career After graduation for high school in 1957, Kilmer competed in football for one year at Citrus Junior College, where he scored six touchdowns and threw for 15 more, with a broken foot limiting his playing time for the Citrus basketball team. He transferred to UCLA in 1958 and played three seasons. Kilmer also played on the Bruins basketball team in 1959‚Äì60 under head coach John Wooden. He capped off his college career with an outstanding senior season in 1960: he threw for over 1,000 yards, ran for over 800, scored eight touchdowns and served as the team's punter. Kilmer was also awarded the 1960 W.J. Voit Memorial Trophy as the outstanding football player on the Pacific Coast, and finished fifth in voting for the Heisman Trophy. After the conclusion of a UCLA career that saw him finish among the top five in school history for passing and rushing yards, as well as total offense, Kilmer played in the 1961 College All-Star Game, where he earned Most Valuable Player honors. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1999. There is some lingering controversy over exactly which position he played. His Hall of Fame plaque lists him as a halfback and says he \\"played tailback in UCLA's single-wing formation.\\" Other sources list him as a quarterback.https://footballfoundation.org/hof_search.aspx?hof=1831 Professional career =San Francisco 49ers= Kilmer was the 11th overall selection of the 1961 NFL draft, taken by the 49ers. He was also selected in the fifth round of the 1961 AFL Draft by the San Diego Chargers, but signed with San Francisco on December 30, 1960. During that rookie season in 1961, he saw action as a primarily running quarterback in Red Hickey's shotgun formation, rushing for 509 yards and ten touchdowns, with his top performance coming against the expansion Minnesota Vikings on October 15 when he rushed for four touchdowns. The following year Kilmer was primarily used as a running back but his season came to an early end following a December 5 auto accident in which he fell asleep in his 1957 Chevrolet convertible and drove off the Bayshore Freeway into the San Francisco Bay. Suffering a fractured leg, Kilmer's injury was bad enough to also force him to sit out the entire 1963 NFL season. He was able to return the following year, but his production was limited. His most memorable play as a 49er came in 1964 during a game against the Vikings at Kezar Stadium. On October 25, 1964 Kilmer fumbled after catching a pass from George Mira. The fumble was recovered by Vikings defensive end Jim Marshall, who infamously ran 66 yards in the wrong direction. In spite of Marshall's gaffe, the Vikings still beat the 49ers, 27-22. After he saw no action in 1965 and was involved in a training camp contract dispute the next season, Kilmer was placed in the 1967 NFL Expansion Draft. =New Orleans Saints= On February 10, 1967, Kilmer was selected in the expansion draft by the New Orleans Saints and, despite originally being thought of as the team's third-best signal caller, became the team's starting quarterback for much of the next four seasons. He was the starter for the team's first game, a 27-13 loss at home to the Los Angeles Rams. Kilmer lost his starting job in 1967 after the first three games (all losses), and was replaced by former Baltimore Colt quarterback Gary Cuozzo. However, Kilmer regained that job in 1968. His most prolific performance during his four-year stint with the team came in 1969, when he threw for 345 yards and six touchdowns in a 51‚Äì42 win over the St. Louis Cardinals on November 2. Kilmer's last win as the Saints' starting quarterback came on week 8 of the 1970 season. Coach Tom Fears had benched Kilmer after three season-opening losses in favor of backup Ed Hargett. However, Fears was fired after week 7 and replaced by J.D. Roberts. The new coach brought Kilmer back as the starting quarterback. On November 8, 1970, in a home game versus the Detroit Lions, Kilmer led what proved to be a game-winning drive, although he could only bring the Saints as far as their own 37 yard line. With just one play left in the game, and his team down by a 17-16 margin, coach Roberts opted against asking Kilmer to go for a \\"Hail Mary\\" pass. Instead, kicker Tom Dempsey was asked to attempt a 63-yard field goal. (The goal posts were still placed on the goal line in 1970, and not on the end line as they are today.) Dempsey made the kick, which broke the existing record by 7 yards. Only one longer field goal has been kicked since. In a 2016 TV interview, recorded during a celebration of the Saints' 50th anniversary, Kilmer denied lingering rumors that he had been Dempsey's holder. \\"I got out of the holding business a while ago,\\" Kilmer recalled, \\"but it was Joe Scarpati and it was a perfect hold.\\" (Scarpati was a reserve defensive back.) Kilmer added, \\"when [Dempsey] kicked that ball, I knew he had made it. It was like Babe Ruth hitting a 500-foot home run. He really nailed it. And that was at sea level.\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpAKuS04MP4 This dramatic victory is still the stuff of legend today. Dempsey was a big man who had been a lineman in junior college and semi-pro ball, even though he was born with no toes on his right foot, which was his kicking foot. He used a special flat-fronted kicking shoe. This win proved to be the only highlight of an otherwise dismal 2-11-1 season: Kilmer closed out the season by leading the Saints to six consecutive losses. Frustrated after four years of the Saints' futility and sensing New Orleans would draft Ole Miss star Archie Manning with the second overall pick of the 1971 NFL Draft, Kilmer asked to be traded and was granted his wish on January 23, 1971, when he was dealt to the Washington Redskins for linebacker Tom Roussel and two draft selections. =Washington Redskins= The trade which brought Kilmer to the Redskins was the first trade the team made after George Allen replaced Vince Lombardi as the head coach. Kilmer seemed destined for a reserve role behind future Hall of Famer Sonny Jurgensen. However, this changed when Jurgensen suffered a severe shoulder injury in a pre-season game against the Miami Dolphins. Kilmer got the starting job and kept it for most of the next four seasons, but Jurgensen stayed on as his backup. The two players were friendly rivals during those years. Fans in Washington tended to be loyal to one quarterback or the other, sporting buttons at games that read \\"I like Billy\\" or \\"I like Sonny.\\" Kilmer did not throw the tight spiral that Jurgensen did, but his wobbly passes often got the job done. Kilmer then led the resurgent Redskins to a 5-0 start in 1971, but then the team ran into a midseason slump. Kilmer briefly lost his starting job as a result of the slide, but regained it after Jurgensen again injured his shoulder. The next season, Kilmer led the 1972 'Skins to an NFC-best 11‚Äì3 record, while also leading the NFL in touchdown passes (19) and passer rating (84.8). After the season, Washington advanced to their first Super Bowl, against the hitherto unbeaten Miami Dolphins. Washington's tough defense held the vaunted Dolphins to just two touchdowns, but Miami's defense was even tougher. The Redskins didn't get on the board late until the 4th quarter, after a bizarre special-teams blunder by the otherwise impeccable Dolphins. Miami kicker Garo Yepremian's field goal attempt with a little over 2 minutes to go in the game was blocked, and Yepremian himself recovered the ball, which would have been OK if he had not then inexplicably tried to pass the ball, with no success whatsoever. Redskins' defensive back Mike Bass recovered Yepremian's fumble and ran the ball back 49 yards for a touchdown. Kilmer got the ball with 1:14 to go in the 4th quarter, on his own 30, with his team down 14-7. Kilmer had the chance to send the game into overtime, or even win it outright, but he was unable to move the ball. The game ended with a 9-yard sack. Miami lineman Vern Den Herder grabbed Kilmer's face mask on that final play and ripped his helmet off, but no penalty was called. The Dolphins became the first and still only unbeaten NFL team of the Super Bowl era. The loss didn't dampen Kilmer's individual recognition as he was named to the Pro Bowl and the All-NFC Team. In 1974, the Redskins acquired a third quarterback, a Notre Dame alumnus named Joe Theismann who had been a star in the Canadian Football League for three seasons. Kilmer beat out both Jurgensen and Theismann for the starting job. Jurgensen retired at the end of the 1974 season. Kilmer remained with the Redskins until he retired after the 1978 season. 1978 was also the season when Theismann finally took over Kilmer's starting quarterback position, although Kilmer did start two games that season, going 1-1-0. During his time with the Redskins, Kilmer became one of the few remaining users of a single-bar face mask on the helmet, as multi-bar face masks became the norm in the NFL. Theismann also wore the single-bar throughout his career. Kilmer finished his 18-year NFL career with 1,585 completions in 2,984 attempts for 20,495 yards and 154 touchdowns, with 146 interceptions. He also rushed for 1,509 yards and 21 touchdowns, caught 27 passes for 288 yards and one touchdown, and punted the ball 16 times for 598 yards. Problems with alcohol It was during the 1970 season, his last in New Orleans, that rumors stirred that Kilmer missed curfew before a game against the Denver Broncos and that his Saints teammates had nicknamed him \\"Ole Whiskey.\\" That reputation had been noted by Saints owner John Mecom, Jr., who mentioned Kilmer's many late-hour visits to New Orleans bars while playing for the team. Kilmer's most memorable night on the town came early Monday morning December 6, 1971 after beating the Giants 23‚Äì7. He got arrested at the Toddle House, a coffee shop in Arlington, Virginia. Apparently, Kilmer and unidentified female friend attempted to pay a $4 tab with a $100 bill and an argument ensued with their waitress. A local police officer named Edmund D. Sheroshick showed up, and Kilmer, told the policeman, ‚ÄúIf you think I‚Äôm wrong, put me in jail!‚Äù Officer Sheroshick did exactly that, but Kilmer was released in plenty of time for his next team practice. In the next few days, Kilmer won the hearts of fans by leading the Redskins to a 38-24 victory over the Los Angeles Rams on Monday Night Football which clinched a playoff berth, and also by telling the waitress she could keep the $100 as a tip. Ironically, Officer Sheroshick was disciplined after getting into an altercation of his own on early Christmas Eve morning at the exact same Toddle House. Even though he was off-duty and was not drunk, the officer had violated his department's rules by driving his cruiser while drinking. On December 11, 1976, Kilmer was arrested for drunk driving less than two days before a game against the Dallas Cowboys. He was released in time to lead the Redskins to a 27-13 victory on Sunday, December 12, on the road at Texas Stadium.https://www.pro-football- reference.com/boxscores/197612120dal.htm#all_team_stats Post-playing career Following his retirement, Kilmer stayed on the fringes while working for a gambling service that made selections on NFL games, but has since stayed out of the spotlight. Kilmer served as coach of the Shreveport Steamers of the American Football Association (a summer professional league) in 1979 and commissioner of the same league in 1981, but left as a result of numerous problems under his tenure as well as a lack of payment. He occasionally makes appearances in Mobile, Alabama, in support of the GMAC Bowl.

The report given by the pathologist is usually limited to a \\"benign\\" or \\"malignant\\" diagnosis, and communicated to the surgeon operating via intercom. When operating on a previously confirmed malignancy, the main purpose of the pathologist is to inform the surgeon if the resection margin is clear of residual cancer, or if residual cancer is present at the resection margin. The method of processing is usually done with the bread loafing technique. But margin controlled surgery (CCPDMA) can be performed using a variety of tissue cutting and mounting methods, including Mohs surgery. History The frozen section procedure as practiced today in medical laboratories is based on the description by Dr Louis B. Wilson in 1905. Wilson developed the technique from earlier reports at the request of Dr William Mayo, surgeon and one of the founders of the Mayo Clinic Earlier reports by Dr Thomas S. Cullen at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore also involved frozen section, but only after formalin fixation, and pathologist Dr William Welch, also at Hopkins, experimented with Cullen's procedure but without clinical consequences. Hence, Wilson is generally credited with truly pioneering the procedure (Gal & Cagle, 2005). Procedure The key instrument for cryosection is the cryostat, which is essentially a microtome inside a freezer. The microtome can be compared to a very accurate \\"deli\\" slicer, capable of slicing sections as thin as 1 micrometre. The usual histology slice is cut at 5 to 10 micrometres. The surgical specimen is placed on a metal tissue disc which is then secured in a chuck and frozen rapidly to about ‚Äì20 to ‚Äì30 ¬∞C. The specimen is embedded in a gel like medium called OCT and consisting of poly ethylene glycol and polyvinyl alcohol; this compound is known by many names and when frozen has the same density as frozen tissue. At this temperature, most tissues become rock-hard. Usually a lower temperature is required for fat or lipid rich tissue. Each tissue has a preferred temperature for processing. Subsequently it is cut frozen with the microtome portion of the cryostat, the section is picked up on a glass slide and stained (usually with hematoxylin and eosin, the H&E; stain). The preparation of the sample is much more rapid than with traditional histology technique (around 10 minutes vs 16 hours). However, the technical quality of the sections is much lower. The entire laboratory can occupy a space less than , and minimal ventilation is required compared to a standard wax embedded specimen laboratory. Uses The principal use of the frozen section procedure is the examination of tissue while surgery is taking place. This may be for various reasons. In the performance of Mohs surgery, it is a simple method for real-time margin control of a surgical specimen. If a tumor appears to have metastasized, a sample of the suspected metastasis is sent for cryosection to confirm its identity. This will help the surgeon decide whether there is any point in continuing the operation. Usually, aggressive surgery is performed only if there is a chance to cure the patient. If the tumor has metastasized, surgery is usually not curative, and the surgeon will choose a more conservative surgery, or no resection at all. If a tumor has been resected but it is unclear whether the resection margin is free of tumor, an intraoperative consultation is requested to assess the need to make a further resection for clear margins. In a sentinel node procedure, a sentinel node containing tumor tissue prompts a further lymph node dissection, while a benign node will avoid such a procedure. If surgery is explorative, rapid examination of a lesion might help identify the possible cause of a patient's symptoms. It is important to note, however, that the pathologist is very limited by the poor technical quality of the frozen sections. A final diagnosis is rarely offered intraoperatively. Rarely, cryosections are used to detect the presence of substances lost in the traditional histology technique, for example lipids. They can also be used to detect some antigens masked by formalin. The cryostat is available in a small portable device weighing less than , to a large stationary device or more. The entire histologic laboratory can be carried in one portable box, making frozen section histology a possible tool in primitive medicine. Accuracy of diagnosis A Cochrane systematic review published in 2016 analysed all studies that reported diagnostic accuracy of frozen sections in women undergoing surgery for suspicious tumor in ovary. The review concluded that for tumors that were clearly either benign or malignant on frozen section, the accuracy of the diagnosis was good, as confirmed later by regular biopsy. On the contrary, where the frozen section diagnosis was a borderline tumor, neither confirming not ruling out cancer, the diagnosis was less accurate. The review suggests that in such situations of uncertainty, surgeons may choose to perform additional surgery in this group of women at the time of their initial surgery in order to reduce the need for a second operation, as on an average one out of five of these women were subsequently found to have cancer.

A rerelease of the game, entitled , was released worldwide for Xbox 360 on April 29, 2009.  Reception  The Dreamcast version received favorable reviews, while Ver.5.66 received \\"average\\" reviews, according to the review aggregation websites GameRankings and Metacritic. Stephen Frost of NextGen called the Japanese import of the former console version \\"an impressive game, and practically a perfect conversion, marred by difficult controls and a lack of 'compatibility' with the standard Dreamcast controller. However, if you're willing to invest the necessary time, you'll eventually discover that the game provides one of the most addictive and deep gaming experiences currently available on Dreamcast.\\" In Japan, Famitsu gave the same Dreamcast version a score of two tens, one nine, and one ten for a total of 39 out of 40. Also in Japan, Game Machine listed the arcade version on their May 15, 1998 issue as being the second most-successful dedicated arcade game of the year. GameSpot gave the same arcade version seven out of ten and said, \\"Provided you can get the twin sticks, Virtual On: Oratorio Tangram is a must-buy. Without the controller, or an edit-controller function, it's a must-avoid.\\"  References   External links  * Category:1998 video games Category:Activision games Category:Arcade games Category:Dreamcast games Category:Sega arcade games Category:Sega video games Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Virtual On Category:Xbox 360 Live Arcade games ","title":"Cyber Troopers Virtual-On Oratorio Tangram"},{"id":"3690507","text":"Drest (Scottish Gaelic: Drest mac Talorgan), was king of the Picts from 782 until 783, succeeding his father Talorgan.
