It is distinguished by the use of consent, rather than majority voting, in decision-making, and of discussion by people who know each other. The Sociocratic Circle-Organization Method (SCM) was developed in the Netherlands by electrical engineer and entrepreneur Gerard Endenburg and is based on the work of peace activists and educators Betty Cadbury and Kees Boeke and is a recent instantiation of the approach.  Origins  The word 'sociocracy' is derived from the Latin socius meaning companions, colleagues, or associates; and cratia which refers to the ruling class, as in aristocracy, plutocracy, democracy, and meritocracy. It was coined in 1851 by French philosopher Auguste Comte, as a parallel to sociology, the science that studies how people organize themselves into social systems. Comte believed that a government led by sociologists would use scientific methods to meet the needs of all the people, not just the ruling class. American sociologist Lester Frank Ward in an 1881 paper for the Penn Monthly was an active advocate of a sociocracy to replace the political competition created by majority vote. Ward expanded his concept of sociocracy in Dynamic Sociology (1883) and The Psychic Factors of Civilization (1892). Ward believed that a well educated public was essential for effective government, and foresaw a time when the emotional and partisan nature of contemporary politics would yield to a more effective, dispassionate, and scientific discussion of issues and problems. Democracy would thus eventually evolve into a more advanced form of government, sociocracy.  20th century  The Dutch pacifist, educator, and peace worker Kees Boeke and his wife, English peace activist Beatrice Cadbury, updated and expanded Ward's ideas in the mid-20th century by implementing the first sociocratic organizational structure in a school in Bilthoven, Netherlands. The school still exists: the Children's Community Workshop (Werkplaats Kindergemeenschap). Boeke saw sociocracy (in Dutch: Sociocratie) as a form of governance or management that presumes equality of individuals and is based on consensus. This equality is not expressed with the 'one man, one vote' law of democracy but rather by a group of individuals reasoning together until a decision is reached that is satisfactory to each one of them. To make sociocratic ideals operational, Boeke used consensus decision-making based on the practices of the Quakers, which he described as one of the first sociocratic organizations. Another is his school of approximately 400 students and teachers in which decisions were made by everyone working together in weekly \\"talkovers\\" to find a mutually acceptable solution. The individuals in each group would then agree to abide by the decision. \\"Only when common agreement is reached can any action be taken, quite a different atmosphere is created from that arising from majority rule.\\" Boeke defined three \\"fundamental rules\\": (1) That the interests of all members must be considered and the individual must respect the interests of the whole. (2) No action could be taken without a solution that everyone could accept, and (3) all members must accept these decisions when unanimously made. If a group could not make a decision, the decision would be made by a \\"higher level\\" of representatives chosen by each group. The size of a decision-making group should be limited to 40 with smaller committees of 5-6 making \\"detailed decisions\\". For larger groups, a structure of representatives is chosen by these groups to make decisions. This model placed a high importance on the role of trust. For the process to be effective, members of each group must trust each other, and it is claimed that this trust will be built over time as long as this method of decision-making is used. When applied to civic governance, people \\"would be forced to take an interest in those who live close by\\". Only when people had learned to apply this method in their neighborhoods could the next higher level of sociocratic governance be established. Eventually representatives would be elected from the highest local levels to establish a \\"World Meeting to govern and order the world.\\" \\"Everything depends on a new spirit breaking through among men. May it be that, after the many centuries of fear, suspicion and hate, more and more a spirit of reconciliation and mutual trust will spread abroad. The constant practice of the art of sociocracy and of the education necessary for it seem to be the best way in which to further this spirit, upon which the real solution of all world problems depends.\\"  In contemporary practice  In the late 1960s and early 1970s Gerard Endenburg, an electrical engineer and former student of Boeke's, further developed and applied Boeke's principles in the electrical engineering company he first managed for his parents and then owned. Endenburg wanted to replicate in a business environment the atmosphere of cooperation and harmony he had experienced in the Boekes school. He also recognized that in industrial production with a diverse and changing workforce, he could not wait for workers to trust each other before they could make decisions. To solve this problem, Endenburg worked by analogy to integrate his understanding of physics, cybernetics, and systems thinking to further develop the social, political, and educational theories of Comte, Ward, and Boeke. After years of experimentation and application, Endenburg developed a formal organizational method called the Sociocratic Circle Organizing Method (Sociocratische Kringorganisatie Methode). It was based on a \\"circular causal feedback process\\", now commonly called the circular process and feedback loops. The method uses a hierarchy of circles corresponding to units or departments of an organization, but it is a circular hierarchy‚Äîthe links between each circle combine to form feedback loops up and down the organization. All policy decisions, those about allocation of resources and that constrain operational decisions, require the consent of all members of a circle. Day-to-day operational decisions are made by the operations leader within the policies established in circle meetings. Policy decisions affecting more than one circle's domain are made by a higher circle formed by representatives from each circle. This structure of linked circles that make decisions by consent maintains the efficiency of a hierarchy while preserving the equivalence of the circles and their members. Endenburg began testing and modifying his application of Boeke's principles in the mid-1960s. By the mid-1970s, he began consulting with other businesses to apply his methods, and eventually began working with all kinds of organizations. In the 1980s, Endenburg and his colleague Annewiek Reijmer founded the Sociocratisch Centrum (Sociocratic Center) in Rotterdam, and began helping other organizations in the Netherlands to adopt the approach. = Essential principles = Endenburg's policy decision-making method was originally published as being based on four essential principles, all in order to emphasize that the process of selecting people for roles and responsibilities was likewise subject to the consent process. As explained below, however, it is now taught through the method of three principles, as Endenburg had originally developed:  Consent governs policy decision making (principle 1)  Decisions are made when there are no remaining \\"paramount objections\\", that is, when there is informed consent from all participants. Objections must be reasoned and argued and based on the ability of the objector to work productively toward the goals of the organization. All policy decisions are made by consent, although the group may consent to use another decision-making method. Within these policies, day-to-day operational decisions are normally made in the traditional way. Generally, objections are highly valued to hear every stakeholder's concern. This process is sometimes called \\"objection harvesting\\". It is emphasized that focusing on objections first leads to more efficient decision making.  Organizing in circles (principle 2)  The sociocratic organization is composed of a hierarchy of semi-autonomous circles. This hierarchy, however, does not constitute a power structure as autocratic hierarchies do, instead resembling a horizontal association, since the domain of each circle is strictly bounded by a group decision. Each circle has the responsibility to execute, measure, and control its own processes in achieving its goals. It governs a specific domain of responsibility within the policies of the larger organization. Circles are also responsible for their own development and for each member's development. Often called \\"integral education,\\" the circle and its members are expected to determine what they need to know to remain competitive in their field and to reach the goals of their circle.  Double-linking (principle 3)  Individuals acting as links function as full members in the decision-making of both their own circles and the next higher circle. A circle's operational leader is by definition a member of the next higher circle and represents the larger organization in the decision-making of the circle they lead. Each circle also elects a representative to represent the circles' interests in the next higher circle. These links form a feedback loop between circles. At the highest level of the organization, there is a ‚Äútop circle‚Äù, analogous to a board of directors, except that it works within the policies of the circle structure rather than ruling over it. The members of the top circle include external experts that connect the organization to its environment. Typically these members have expertise in law, government, finance, community, and the organization's mission. In a corporation, it might also include a representative selected by the shareholders. The top circle also includes the CEO and at least one representative of the general management circle. Each of these circle members participates fully in decision-making in the top circle.  Elections by consent (principle 4)  This fourth principle extends principle 1. Individuals are elected to roles and responsibilities in open discussion using the same consent criteria used for other policy decisions. Members of the circle nominate themselves or other members of the circle and present reasons for their choice. After discussion, people can (and often do) change their nominations, and the discussion leader will suggest the election of the person for whom there are the strongest arguments. Circle members may object and there is further discussion. For a role that many people might fill, this discussion may continue for several rounds. When fewer people are qualified for the task, this process will quickly converge. The circle may also decide to choose someone who is not a current member of the circle.  The \\"three principles\\"  In the first formulations of the Sociocratic Circle-Organizing Method, Endenburg had three principles and regarded the fourth, elections by consent, not as a separate principle but as a method for making decisions by consent when there are several choices. He considered it part of the first principle, consent governs policy decisions, but many people misunderstood that elections of people to roles and responsibilities are allocations of resources and thus policy decisions. To emphasize the importance of making these decisions by consent in the circle meetings, Endenburg separated it into a fourth principle. Consent vs. consensus Sociocracy makes a distinction between \\"consent\\" and \\"consensus\\" in order to emphasize that circle decisions are not expected to produce \\"a consensus\\". It does not mean agreement or solidarity. In sociocracy consent is defined as \\"no objections\\", and objections are based on one's ability to work toward the aims of the organization. Members discussing an idea in consent based-governance commonly ask themselves if it is \\"good enough for now, safe enough to try\\". If not, then there is an objection, which leads to a search for an acceptable adaptation of the original proposal to gain consent. Sociocratisch Centrum co- founder Reijmer has summarized the difference as follows: \\"By consensus, I must convince you that I am in the right; by consent, you ask whether you can live with the decision\\". =Interdependence and transparency= The principles are interdependent and the application of all of them is required for an organization to function sociocratically. Each one supports the successful application of the others. The principles also require transparency in the organization. Since decision-making is distributed throughout the organization, all members of the organization must have access to information. The only exception to this is proprietary knowledge and any information that would jeopardize the security of the organization or its clients. All financial transactions and policy decisions are transparent to members of the organization and to the organization's clients. In addition to the principles, sociocratic organizations apply the circular feedback process of directing- doing-measuring to the design of work processes, and in business organizations, compensation is based on a market rate salary plus long-term and short-term payments based on the success of the circle. The operational practices of sociocratic organizations are compatible with the best practices of contemporary management theory.

The earliest created color organs were manual instruments based on the harpsichord design. By the 1900s they were electromechanical. In the early 20th century, a silent color organ tradition (Lumia) developed. In the 1960s and '70s, the term \\"color organ\\" became popularly associated with electronic devices that responded to their music inputs with light shows. The term \\"light organ\\" is increasingly being used for these devices; allowing \\"color organ\\" to reassume its original meaning.  History of the concept  In 1590, Gregorio Comanini described an invention by the Mannerist painter Arcimboldo of a system for creating color- music, based on apparent luminosity (light-dark contrast) instead of hue. In 1725, French Jesuit monk Louis Bertrand Castel proposed the idea of Clavecin pour les yeux (Ocular Harpsichord). In the 1740s, German composer Telemann went to France to see it, composed some pieces for it and wrote a book about it. It had 60 small colored glass panes, each with a curtain that opened when a key was struck. In about 1742, Castel proposed the clavecin oculaire (a light organ) as an instrument to produce both sound and the 'proper' light colors. A caricature of Louis-Bertrand Castel's \\"ocular organ\\" by Charles Germain de Saint Aubin In 1743, Johann Gottlob Kr√ºger, a professor at the University of Hall, proposed his own version of the ocular harpsichord. In 1816, Sir David Brewster proposed the Kaleidoscope as a form of visual-music that became immediately popular. In 1877, US artist, inventor Bainbridge Bishop gets a patent for his first Color Organ.US patent #186298 The instruments were lighted attachments designed for pipe organs that could project colored lights onto a screen in synchronization with musical performance. Bishop built three of the instruments; each was destroyed in a fire, including one in the home of P. T. Barnum.Bainbridge Bishop, A Souvenir of the Color Organ, with Some Suggestions in Regard to the Soul of the Rainbow and the Harmony of Light. 1893 pamphlet In 1893, British painter Alexander Wallace Rimington invented the Clavier √† lumi√®res.Rimington, Alexander Wallace, Colour-Music The Art Of Mobile Colour. Hutchinson, London, 1912 Rimington's Colour Organ attracted much attention, including that of Richard Wagner and Sir George Grove. It has been incorrectly claimed that his device formed the basis of the moving lights that accompanied the New York City premiere of Alexander Scriabin's synaesthetic symphony Prometheus: The Poem of Fire in 1915. The instrument that accompanied that premiere was lighting engineer Preston S. Millar's chromola, which was similar to Rimington's instrument. In a 1916 art manifesto, the Italian Futurists Arnaldo Ginna and Bruno Corra described their experiments with \\"color organ\\" projection in 1909. They also painted nine abstract films, now lost. In 1916, the Russian Futurist Painter Vladimir Baranoff Rossin√© premiered the Optophonic Piano at his one- man exhibition in Kristiana (Oslo, Norway). In 1918, American concert pianist Mary Hallock-Greenewalt created an instrument she called the Sarabet. Also an inventor, she patented nine inventions related to her instrument, including the rheostat. In 1921, Arthur C. Vinageras proposed the Chromopiano, an instrument resembling and played like a grand piano, but designed to project \\"chords\\" composed from colored lights. In the 1920s, Danish-born Thomas Wilfred created the Clavilux, a color organ, ultimately patenting seven versions. By 1930, he had produced 16 \\"Home Clavilux\\" units. Glass disks bearing art were sold with these \\"Clavilux Juniors.\\" Wilfred coined the word lumia to describe the art. Significantly, Wilfred's instruments were designed to project colored imagery, not just fields of colored light as with earlier instruments. In 1925, Hungarian composer Alexander Laszlo wrote a text called Color-Light-Music ; Laszlo toured Europe with a color organ. In Hamburg, Germany from the late 1920s‚Äìearly 1930s, several color organs were demonstrated at a series of Colour-Sound Congresses (German:Kongre√ü f√ºr Farbe- Ton-Forschung).Farbe-Ton-Forschungen. III. Band. Bericht √ºber den II. Kongre√ü f√ºr Farbe-Ton-Forschung (Hamburg 1. - 5. Oktober 1930). Published 1931. Ludwig Hirschfeld Mack performed his Farbenlichtspiel colour organ at these congresses and at several other festivals and events in Germany. He had developed this color organ at the Bauhaus school in Weimar, with Kurt Schwerdtfeger. The 1939 London Daily Mail Ideal Home Exhibition featured a \\"72-way Light Console and Compton Organ for Colour Music\\", as well as a 70 feet, 230 kW \\"Kaleidakon\\" tower. From 1935‚Äì77, Charles Dockum built a series of Mobilcolor Projectors, his versions of silent color organs. In the late 1940s, Oskar Fischinger created the Lumigraph that produced imagery by pressing objects/hands into a rubberized screen that would protrude into colored light. The imagery of this device was manually generated, and was performed with various accompanying music. It required two people to operate: one to make changes to colors, the other to manipulate the screen. Fischinger performed the Lumigraph in Los Angeles and San Francisco in the late 1940s through early 1950s. The Lumigraph was licensed by the producers of the 1964 sci-fi film, The Time Travelers. The Lumigraph does not have a keyboard, and does not generate music. In 2000, Jack Ox and David Britton created \\"The Virtual Color Organ.\\" The 21st Century Virtual Reality Color Organ is a computational system for translating musical compositions into visual performance. It uses supercomputing power to produce 3D visual images and sound from Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) files and can play a variety of compositions. Performances take place in interactive, immersive, virtual reality environments such as the Cave Automatic Virtual Environment (CAVE), VisionDome, or Immersadesk. Because it's a 3D immersive world, the Color Organ is also a place‚Äîthat is, a performance space.Ox, Jack, & Britton, Dave. (2000). The 21st Century Virtual Reality Color Organ.

It has hosted concerts and events since its construction in 1914 and can hold approximately 2,200 people in its recently restored auditorium, which is well loved by performers due to its acoustics. The Hall is flanked by The Royal Lyceum Theatre on the right and The Traverse Theatre on the left. Historic Scotland has registered the Hall with Category A listed building status. History The construction of the hall was funded by Andrew Usher, a whisky distiller and blender, who donated ¬£100,000 to the city specifically to fund a new concert hall. The choice of site caused early delays but in 1910 an architectural competition was announced with the requirement that the hall be simple but dignified. The winning bid (one of 130 entries) came from Stockdale Harrison & Howard H Thomson of Leicester. The design was partly a backlash against Victorian Gothic, with a return to classical features owing much to the Beaux-Arts style. On 19 July 1911, George V and Queen Mary laid two memorial stones, an event attended by over a thousand people. 'Municipal Benificence'- one of the sculpted figures on the facade of the Hall Its curved walls, unusual for the time, were made possible by developments in reinforced concrete. The dome was designed to reflect the curvature of the walls, not to give a domed interior (which would have been acoustically disastrous). The interior of the hall is adorned with decorative plaster panels by the Edinburgh sculptor Harry Gamley. The figures depicted in these panels show figures from the world of music, as well as famous Scots. These include: Sir Walter Scott, Robert Burns, Allan Ramsay, R L Stevenson, Johann Sebastian Bach, George Frideric Handel, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Johannes Brahms, Edvard Grieg and Anton Rubinstein. Harry Gamley's work also features on the outside of the building with two large figures representing Inspiration and Achievement, as well as another three figures by Crossland McClure depicting the Soul of Music, Music of the Sea and Music of the Woods. The finished building was officially opened on 16 March 1914 with a concert featuring music by Handel, Bach, Wagner, Beethoven and the Scottish composer Hamish MacCunn. The final cost of building the Usher Hall was ¬£134,000. Andrew Usher died before building work was started. =Social history= The Usher Hall has been used for a variety of events, including politics, religion, charity fundraisers and sport, as well as music. In 1914 Prime Minister H. H. Asquith gave a speech entitled the War, using the occasion to recruit from the all-male audience. At various times the musical and the political overlapped, on occasions such as fundraising concerts for the Republican movement in Spain in the 1930s and sexcentenary celebrations of the foundation of the City of Edinburgh in 1929. The end to political rallies in the Usher Hall came after a serious incident in 1934, when Sir Oswald Mosley came to speak. Between five and six thousand people protested outside, and several people were injured. In 1986 the Commonwealth Games came to Edinburgh with the Usher Hall providing the venue for the boxing tournament. The extensive basement rooms of the Usher Hall made the building ideal for use as an air-raid shelter and the venue was equipped for use during the Second World War. However, there are no records of it being used as such, but painted signs on internal doors, such as \\"No Dogs\\" indicate that preparations were made. =Musical history= As a platform for international classical musicians, the hall hosted the Vienna Philharmonic, under Bruno Walter, at the first festival in 1947. It is also the Edinburgh home of the Royal Scottish National Orchestra, who play regularly during their season. The Scottish Chamber Orchestra, Scottish Fiddle Orchestra, National Youth Orchestra of Scotland and local organisations, such as the Edinburgh Royal Choral Union and the Kevock Choir, also regularly appear. In March 1972, the Eurovision Song Contest was held at the Hall and comp√®red by Moira Shearer. The United Kingdom entry was sung by The New Seekers. =Organ= A major feature of the Usher Hall is the organ. It was built in 1913 by Norman & Beard of Norwich at a cost of around ¬£4000, and was designed to be the focal point of the Hall, both visually and musically. The significance of the organ to the Usher Hall is demonstrated by the existence of the Usher Hall Organ Trust, who helped raise funds to restore the organ. It had fallen into disuse due to poor reliability caused by a lack of adequate moisture and temperature control, leading to it not being played for several years. The restoration work was carried out by Harrison and Harrison of Durham, and took three years to complete, with the organ being reinstalled in 2002. The organ was re- inaugurated on 7 June 2003 in a celebratory concert recital by Gillian Weir. Present day The auditorium Still owned and managed by the City of Edinburgh Council, the Usher Hall is still in constant use. As well as being one of the main venues for the Edinburgh International Festival, other events have been held, such as the Holocaust Memorial Ceremony and the Colin O'Riordan Memorial Concert. Freedom of the City ceremonies have taken place at the hall over the years, with the most recent being for film star and Scottish icon Sean Connery in 1991. On 13 April 1996 hours after a concert, a large piece of plaster fell 130 feet from the roof into the auditorium.https://www.usherhall.co.uk/screenloader.aspx?page=style/UsherHall/history.html&type;=include Only three chairs were damaged, but this event was just one example of the state of disrepair into which the Hall was falling. Vital repairs were necessary to make the building wind-proof, watertight and safe. Relying heavily on Lottery and Arts Council funding, the City of Edinburgh embarked on a ¬£25 million scheme to both make the hall safe and improve its function - including making the auditorium suitable for Promenade-type events and building new catering and ticketing facilities . Unfortunately, late into the design phase, the Lottery Fund application failed and the Arts Council withdrew its support. Mired in controversy the project collapsed. In 1998 the City of Edinburgh announced it had put aside ¬£9 million to start the refurbishment again. In 2002 plans for a second phase of refurbishment were announced with plans to raise the further ¬£11 million required.

Publication history Created by John Broome and Gil Kane, the first Doctor Polaris, Neal Emerson, made his first appearance in Green Lantern #21 (Agosto 1963). The second Dr. Polaris, John Nichol, first appeared off-panel in Justice League of America No. 11 (September 2007), before receiving a full introduction in Justice League of America vol. 2 No. 17 (March 2008). Nichol's origins in this issue were developed by Matthew Sturges and Andre Coelho. Fictional character biography =Neal Emerson= Neal Emerson and his brother John were raised by an abusive father (although a later flashback shows him raised by an abusive aunt). This apparently drove Neal Emerson within himself and led to the creation of the personification of his own dark side. Emerson left the United States for a year and returned to find he was an uncle. His brother John and sister-in-law Katherine had adopted a baby and named him Grant. Emerson was not around much for his nephew over the years, but he was quite fond of the boy. As a medical student, Neal Emerson develops a fanatical interest in magnets, despite the teasing of his classmates. Emerson is convinced exposure to magnetic fields will give him more energy. He later holds crowd-drawing lectures on \\"Health via Magnetism\\". Due to his medical background and belief in magnetism, Emerson adopts the name \\"Doctor Polaris.\\" He even designs a special costume and mask to wear for his public appearances. After time Emerson came to believe he had absorbed too much magnetic energy, and unsuccessfully tries to drain off the excess energy. In desperation, Emerson tries to make a public appeal at a charity event to Green Lantern, believing Green Lantern's power ring can help him. On his unfortune, putting on the costume causes the evil persona of Doctor Polaris to take over Emerson, and he robs the box office of the proceeds instead. Polaris tries to draw a magnetic gun on Green Lantern, but is knocked unconscious by the Lantern instead. At the hospital, Green Lantern probes Polaris' mind, and learns of Emerson's evil side. Shortly thereafter, Polaris recovers and attacks Green Lantern from hiding with girders and other metal objects. The Green Lantern manages to draw Polaris out into the open and defeat him. Doctor Polaris is remanded to police custody; during that time, his \\"good self\\" resurfaces. Doctor Polaris apparently returns to battle Green Lantern and the Justice League alongside Killer Moth, Dagon, the Mask and the Pied Piper, but it is later revealed the Demons Three, Abnegazar, Rath and Ghast, had created magical duplicates of the villains. The League even has to battle the villains' costumes before ultimately defeating the Demons Three. Doctor Polaris was later released from imprisonment during one of his \\"good\\" periods. He attempted to discover the source of Green Lantern's power by kidnapping his friend, Tom Kalmaku. Polaris learned Green Lantern's power battery was hidden at Ferris Aircraft and was able to put a magnetic barrier around it, which prevented Green Lantern from fully charging his ring. The hero tracked Kalmaku to Polaris' lair as his power ring ran out of energy. Polaris turned his weapon on the Green Lantern, apparently killing him. The emerald gladiator's body disappeared. What Doctor Polaris did not know was that Green Lantern was taken to Oa, home of the Guardians of the Universe, the masters of the Green Lantern Corps. Due to the magnetic effect of Polaris' weapon, they believed Jordan was dead. To complicate matters further, Jordan was taken into the 58th Century where he battled a threat to the Earth in the fictional identity of Pol Manning. Returning to the 20th Century, Green Lantern defeated Polaris. After reviving him, Jordan revealed to Kalmaku the \\"good\\" nature of Neal Emerson had lessened the effect of Doctor Polaris' weapon, thereby saving the ring wielder. A reformed Emerson traveled to the Earth's magnetic North Pole to study it. Emerson was at the point where the lines of magnetic force converge when an earthquake plunged him into a deep crevice. At the bottom of the crevice lay a glowing blue blob. The radiation from the blob altered Emerson's perceptions, allowing him to understand the blob's intentions to dehydrate the entire Earth. Emerson was able to subconsciously influence Hal Jordan into becoming Green Lantern, but was unable to bring the Lantern to the North Pole. In desperation, Emerson created a mental duplicate of his evil alter ego. Doctor Polaris took advantage of the situation and attacked Green Lantern by blocking his power battery with a magnetic barrier. Doctor Polaris flew into Earth's orbit to increase the solar radiation reaching the planet. As he left the Earth's magnetic field, the barrier around the power ring faded, allowing Green Lantern to recover. Green Lantern managed to use micrometeorites to form an iron mask around Polaris' head, blocking off his vision. Back on Earth, Emerson was able to use telepathy to warn Green Lantern of the alien threat. Once Green Lantern disintegrated the blob, the mental image of the evil Doctor Polaris faded away. Years later, Emerson's dark side returns. Returning to his old costume, Polaris takes the name of Baxter Timmons and moves to Metropolis' Suicide Slum, where he steals advanced technology from warehouses throughout the city. Polaris integrates the new magnetic circuits into his costume, as part of an attempt to gain revenge on Green Lantern. Polaris' plans are stopped through the efforts of the superhero Black Lightning. Over the years, the Polaris and Emerson personalities fought for dominance, until Polaris was approached by the demon Neron. Polaris sold Neron Emerson's soul in exchange for greater power and being rid of the other, restraining side of his personality. Polaris was one of Neron's lieutenants before being betrayed by Lex Luthor and the Joker. Polaris later attacks Steel in Washington D.C., seeking a weapon called the Annihilator that Steel had built. During the battle, Steel's grandmother attacks Polaris and is killed. Polaris is driven away after the Parasite attacks him. Afraid of absorbing Polaris's mind and not just his power, Parasite lets him go before killing him. Polaris flees to Keystone City.Steel Vol. 2 #29. DC Comics. Some time after that, Polaris shows up at Poseidonis in an attempt to seize control of the city, prompting a battle against Aquaman and his allies. At that same time, Maxima is in the city trying to force Aquaman to marry her. Using her powerful mental abilities, Maxima compels Polaris into believing that his alternate personality has reemerged, forcing him into a nearly catatonic state. Under unknown circumstances, the catatonic Polaris ends up being held in Iraq, but he is rescued by Hatchet, Heat Wave and Sonar. The trio planned to carry him to the Aurora Borealis in the magnetic North Pole for recharge, thinking that he would be thankful to them and would lead them. They fought The Flash, Green Arrow and Green Lantern. When Polaris recovers, the Flash gives him a bit of his speed, which has the same effect as applying kinetic energy to a magnet; Doctor Polaris' body attracts the remains of the sunken Aurora Borealis, containing him. (Green Lantern #96, Green Arrow #130 and Flash #135) In 2001, Polaris emerges during the Joker's \\"Last Laugh\\" crisis attempting to take control of the magnetic south pole itself, forcing a battle against the Justice League where the League only just manage to defeat him thanks to the actions of Plastic Man (the only League member with no metal on him whatsoever). At the end of Last Laugh, the Slab metahuman prison is moved to Antarctica, as Polaris now is the magnetic pole and cannot be moved. Shortly thereafter, Polaris appears in San Francisco, allied with the villainous Cadre. Here, he is utilizing the power of one of the unimaginably powerful alien Controllers, as well as Cadre member Black Mass, the latter keeping Polaris' magnetic powers in check so that he can move from the Slab. This time, Doctor Polaris has an \\"altruistic\\" goal in sight; convinced that civilization and humanity's free will are obstacles for creating a better Earth, he plans to use the Controller's power and some stolen S.T.A.R. Labs equipment to focus his powers and \\"cleanse the world\\". The heroes known as the Power Company defeat Polaris by turning the brain-damaged Black Mass against his master and use his gravitational powers to drain Polaris on power. Shortly before the \\"Infinite Crisis\\" storyline, Dr. Polaris appears in Metropolis, seeking Superman's help in battling a more powerful and ruthless magnetism manipulator who calls herself Repulse. It eventually transpires that this is a new manifestation of his personality disorder; Polaris is hallucinating Repulse (who looks like the aunt who hated him), and performs her actions himself. Eventually, Superman forces him to accept she is not real. After recovering from this breakdown, Polaris is recruited by Lex Luthor's Secret Society of Super Villains in \\"Villains United.\\" Dr. Polaris is one of the villains waiting to ambush the Freedom Fighters in a warehouse south of Metropolis in the beginning of Infinite Crisis. When Phantom Lady is impaled by Deathstroke, the Human Bomb becomes enraged. After Dr. Polaris taunts the Human Bomb, he is blown into pieces by the Human Bomb's explosive rage. During the \\"Blackest Night\\" storyline, Emerson has been identified as one of the deceased entombed below the Hall of Justice. Neal Emerson appears in the \\"DC Rebirth\\" reboot. He first appears as part of Max Lord's supervillain team trying to kill Amanda Waller. He is revealed to have been part of Waller's original Suicide Squad. =John Nichol= A new Doctor Polaris is mentioned, having fought League members Red Arrow and Vixen.Justice League of America #11. DC Comics. The battle occurs off-panel, but he appears in a panel.Justice League of America #17. DC Comics. During the \\"Final Crisis\\" storyline, the new Doctor Polaris can be seen among the recruits of Libra's new Secret Society.Justice League of America #21. DC Comics. It is revealed that businessman and Intergang associate John Nichol, a follower of Neal Emerson's exploits, became the second Doctor Polaris after the death of Neal Emerson. He battles Blue Beetle, holding a definitive advantage, until he is shot in the shoulder by his own daughter.Blue Beetle Vol. 2. #32 (December 2008). DC Comics. This Doctor Polaris was also among the villains in the ambush of the JSA led by Tapeworm. During the \\"Blackest Night\\" storyline, Nichol is reported to have been killed by the Black Lantern version of Emerson during a conversation between Calculator and Lex Luthor. The kill is said to be verified by Cheetah, Calculator noting that Nichol was the only real source of information he had on the new Blue Beetle.Blackest Night #4. DC Comics. Powers and abilities Both users of Doctor Polaris possessed the power of manipulating and channeling magnetic fields. They can manipulate iron and iron-based alloys to their whim. They can explode most metal constructs, manipulate ferrous materials and also fly using their powers. The Neal Emerson Doctor Polaris was shown to have lost his powers when exposed to extreme heat. Another one of Emerson's weaknesses was telepathy, due to his fragile psyche. The John Nichol Polaris has all of Emerson's abilities and more, such as the power to create a localized magnetic storm in a person's brain, killing them instantly. Having no mental defects, Nichol is able to utilize his powers much more effectively than Emerson did. In other media In Justice League Unlimited, Dr. Polaris (wearing his original costume and voiced by an uncredited Michael Rosenbaum) is seen as a member of the new Secret Society of Super Villains (which evokes the traits of the Legion of Doom) led by Gorilla Grodd; here, he is portrayed as one of the Legion's most powerful members. Polaris and the Key rescue Lex Luthor from the pursuing cops and brought him to Grodd. He, Lex Luthor, and Key raid the Blackhawks old base and battle Hawkgirl, Flash, Fire and a retired Blackhawk and are able to get away by putting the base on self-destruct which is aborted. In this episode Fire is able to weaken him by heating up the area. Dr. Polaris returns in the episode \\"The Great Brain Robbery\\", in which he attempts to wrest control of the organization from Lex Luthor. Luthor reveals that when he augmented Polaris' powers, he installed fail-safes that allow him to override Doctor Polaris' powers. Polaris is then presumably killed by Luthor. He was not seen in the season 3 finale. Dr. Polaris (wearing a version of John Nichols/Dr. Polaris suit) appears in Batman: The Brave and the Bold episode \\"Fall of the Blue Beetle!\\", voiced by Lex Lang. Dr. Polaris attempts to rob a gold reserve, but is foiled by Batman, even though a talkative and unconcerned Blue Beetle distracts him. Dr. Polaris has a good counterpart in an alternate universe in \\"Deep Cover for Batman!\\", who resembles Red Tornado and Magneto. The original Polaris appears in a gang of villains recruited by Owlman in \\"Game Over for Owlman!\\". The second Doctor Polaris appears in the \\"Thunder and Lightning\\" segments of DC Nation Shorts.

Once he saved up some money, he decided he wanted to go back to college, and play basketball.PRO BASKETBALL; N.B.A. Dream Is Alive For Jenkins, Almost 28 - New York Times While at William Paterson University, Jenkins was a three-time Division III Player of the Year (1999, 2000, and 2001). He was also a three- time Division III All-American. He holds numerous school records, and also was named 2001 Basketball Times Division III Player of the Year. Jenkins was also the winner of the 2001 ESPN NCAA dunk contest, beating former Division I standout Jeff Trepagnier.

Professional career Jenkins attended all three NBA pre-draft camps, but he was undrafted in the 2001 NBA Draft. In the summer of 2001, Jenkins attended rookie camp with the Orlando Magic, and also received an invitation to training camp with Orlando. However, he declined the invitation, and signed with Cimberio Borgomanero, a team in the Italian second league. He received a guaranteed one-year contract. He spent the 2002 NBA Summer League with the New York Knicks, and the 2003 Summer League with the Seattle SuperSonics. Horace Jenkins got his break in the summer of 2004, playing in the NBA Summer League with the Detroit Pistons. He was previously playing with AEK Athens of the Greek Basket League, with Pistons draft pick Andreas Glyniadakis. Pistons President Joe Dumars was watching film of Glyniadakis, and spotted Jenkins. Jenkins averaged 20.1 points, 3.3 assists, and 1.8 steals in 12 EuroLeague games with AEK Athens. Impressed, Dumars invited Jenkins to summer camp in 2004. In summer camp, he averaged 8.2 points and 2.8 assists per game in 5 games. That was enough to garner a guaranteed contract from the Pistons, which he signed on August 4, 2004. His contract was a one-year deal worth $385,277.http://www.nba.com/pistons/news/transactions_jenkins_040804.html Jenkins started the 2004‚Äì05 NBA season on the injured list, but he did see NBA game action 15 times. He was on the bench for the raising of the Pistons' 2004 championship banner, as well as the Pacers‚ÄìPistons brawl. Rumors circulated that he was being traded to the Chicago Bulls, and also that he was going to leave the Pistons, and return to Italy. His NBA debut was a two-minute stint against the San Antonio Spurs. He scored 9 points the next night against the New Orleans Hornets. Jenkins scored a career-high 10 points on December 10, 2004, against the Atlanta Hawks. He was one of only three Pistons to score in double figures in that game. He scored 2 points in his hometown of New Jersey on February 5, 2005. Five nights later, in a rematch of the 2004 NBA Finals, Jenkins scored 8 points, in only 6 minutes against the Los Angeles Lakers. He scored 6 points in 20 minutes in his final NBA game, which was against the Charlotte Bobcats.http://www.nba.com/pistons/stats/2004/index.html Although he was left off the playoff roster, the Pistons made the NBA Finals for the second straight year. Jenkins was notable for being one of the oldest rookies in the NBA, and his life story was the subject of a short presentation narrated by Jamie Foxx, on ABC, during the 2005 NBA Finals. Jenkins took the long route to the NBA, working to support his family, and then playing in Europe, before signing his first NBA contract, at the age of 29. In 2005, Jenkins signed a contract with the Israeli team Hapoel Jerusalem, who had gotten sponsored by billionaire Arkadi Gaydamak shortly before. He quickly became the star of the team (rivaling the former star from 2 years prior, Will Solomon, who played for their arch rivals Maccabi Tel Aviv that season), and led it to the EuroCup semifinals, and to the Israeli League Finals In the summer of 2006, he signed with the Turkish League giants Efes Pilsen. In the middle of the 2006-07 season, he returned to Hapoel Jerusalem, after personal problems with his Turkish head coach arose (after the accusation from the previous year had been dropped), and he helped the team reach the Israeli league Final Four, in which the team lost to arch rivals Maccabi Tel Aviv.

Early life John Wheelock was born in Lebanon, Connecticut on January 28, 1754, the son of Eleazar Wheelock, the director Moor's Indian Charity School (founded 1754), and Mary Brinsmead Wheelock. He is a decedent of Ralph Wheelock, the first teacher in the British Colonies. Though he began his higher education at Yale, Wheelock followed his father to Hanover, New Hampshire when his father founded Dartmouth, and completed his studies there, where he was a member of the College‚Äôs inaugural graduating class in 1771. In 1776, Wheelock became a leader of the United Committees, a group of disgruntled New Hampshire citizens angry at their lack of representation in the state legislature and the distance of the state capital; in retaliation for these slights, Wheelock and others led twelve New Hampshire towns to secede from the state and attempt to join Vermont. The next year, 1777, as the Revolutionary War raged, Wheelock briefly served in New York and Vermont as a lieutenant colonel in Colonel Bedel's Regiment. He carried on correspondence with, among others, George Washington. Presidency of Dartmouth College Upon his father's death in 1779, John Wheelock assumed the presidency of the College, despite the fact that he was neither an academic nor a minister. During his almost forty years as Dartmouth's president (1779‚Äì1815), Wheelock oversaw the construction of Dartmouth Hall and the founding of Dartmouth Medical School, the fourth-oldest medical school in the country; he also maintained the College‚Äôs fiscal solvency throughout the Revolutionary War, mainly through the Vermont legislature‚Äôs grant of 23,000 acres (93 km¬≤) in Wheelock, Vermont. During the latter half of Wheelock's tenure, he became embroiled in a dispute with Dartmouth‚Äôs Board of Trustees. Wheelock proceeded to convince the governor of New Hampshire to fill the Board with supporters and turn Dartmouth College into a state-controlled Dartmouth University. The original, private Board resisted and eventually sued. The case, Dartmouth College v. Woodward, went through various judicial courts, before the United States Supreme Court decided in the Board's favor in 1819, the result of a brilliant peroration by Dartmouth alumnus Daniel Webster, class of 1801, who had, ironically, graduated under Wheelock's tenure. However, by this time, Wheelock, who had been forced out of the presidency in 1815 by failing health and poor relations with the Board, had died. He was succeeded by Francis Brown. Wheelock died on April 4, 1817, and is buried near his father in the cemetery in Hanover, NH.

It traditionally offered a range of mortgages (including subprime mortgages), savings, investment, pension and life assurance products, but from 2007 onwards, also offered credit cards, ATM accounts and current accounts as well as online banking and Laser/Maestro debit cards. History First Active was founded in 1861 as the Workingman's Benefit Building Society. It was incorporated in Ireland in 1875 under the Building Societies Act, 1874. In 1960 the name of the Society was changed to First National Building Society. Over a period of years First National grew both organically, through expansion of its branch network, and by the acquisition of the business of five small building societies: * Grafton Savings and Building Society, acquired in 1974 * The Guinness Permanent Building Society, acquired in 1984 * Ireland Benefit Building Society, acquired in 1984 * Irish Life Building Society, acquired in 1993, and * Postal Service Permanent Building Society, acquired in 1985.Irish Banking Federation, List of Building Society Changes In 1994 First National acquired Mortgage Trust Limited, a UK centralised mortgage lending business. In 1995 a deposit taking subsidiary commenced business in Guernsey, Channel Islands. The Group's UK operations were expanded in 1996 through the acquisition of The Mortgage Corporation. A retail deposit taking operation was established in England in 1996 to obtain sterling deposits to fund the Group's growing mortgage business in the UK. At the 1998 Annual General Meeting the members voted to convert to a public limited company and to list the Company shares on the Irish and London Stock Exchange. Conversion occurred on 7 September 1998, the shares were listed on 6 October 1998 and simultaneously the company raised IR¬£132 million in new capital from existing members and from the institutional markets. Between September 2000 and December 2002 First Active sold its investments in First Active Financial in the UK to Britannic Assurance plc. From the 1990s, it used an advertising campaign which involved contradicting received knowledge about finance. Examples included the First Active representative telling \\"Most people\\" that there's no need to keep switching mortgage companies, finding \\"whoever said that you need to keep switching mortgages in order to get the best deal\\", and finding where it is written that it takes ages to get a decision on your mortgage. On 5 January 2004, First Active became a wholly owned subsidiary of Ulster Bank. The same year, Tesco Bank also began offering products provided by First Active. On 26 January 2009, it was announced that First Active would cease to operate as a separate entity and its operations would be merged with those of Ulster Bank, with the loss of 750 jobs (550 in the Republic of Ireland and 200 in Northern Ireland). From September 2009, it ceased offering any new products to customers in preparation for the merger.

It lies off the foreshore at Cramond. It is long and covers .Wilson, Rev. John The Gazetteer of Scotland (Edinburgh, 1882) Published by W. & A.K. Johnstone The island is part of the Dalmeny Estate, owned by the Rosebery Estates Partnership, and is let to Cramond Boat Club. Geography Cramond Island is a tidal island about one mile (1.6 km) out to sea, which is connected to the mainland at low tide across the Drum Sands. A paved path, exposed at low water, allows easy access. This causeway runs at the foot of a row of concrete pylons on one side of the causeway, which were constructed as an anti-boat boom during the Second World War and are one of the most striking sights in the area. At high tide the path is covered by several feet of seawater which cuts the island off from the mainland. It is safe to walk along the raised causeway to the island at low tide, but only if visitors ensure that they leave enough time to return to the mainland before the water rises. The speed at which the tide comes in can easily trap the unwary. A large signpost (located at the start of the causeway) warns visitors of the danger. If this warning is ignored, there can be serious accidents p. 4 or people may be stranded on the island until the next low tide. In 2011, a Daniel Defoe of Livingston, West Lothian and an unidentified female found themselves trapped on the island due to miscalculating the times of the tide. This story gained attention due to the ironic parallels with Robinson Crusoe; a novel written by Daniel Defoe published in 1719. Coastguards recommend that the crossing is only attempted during the two hours either side of low water. On the RNLI (Royal National Lifeboat Institute) Queensferry website there is a list of ‚Äúsafe crossing times‚Äù and it states that the ‚Äútimes are given as a guide and may change due to weather and conditions. Times listed in WHITE are the first safe crossing time and those listed in RED are when to be back on the mainland‚Äù.http://www.queensferrylifeboat.co.uk/safe-crossing-times The island is in the estuary of the River Almond whose mouth is near the landward end of the crossing. It is a popular recreation area. Cramond Island is one of 43 tidal islands that can be walked to from the mainland of Great Britain and one of 17 that can be walked to from the Scottish mainland.Caton, Peter (2011) No Boat Required - Exploring Tidal Islands. Matador.  History  The ruined farmstead on Cramond Island There is evidence to suggest that the island may have had special significance to the prehistoric peoples who lived along the coast of the Firth of Forth, as at least one stone burial cist was found. ‚ÄúThe oldest evidence of human activity on the island is an early Christian long cist that was discovered by the army during WWII. Its position was not recorded.‚Äù ‚ÄúGeological history of cramond Edinburgh ‚Ä¶ copyright 2014 lothian and borders geoconservation, a committee of the edinburgh geological society, a charity registered in scotland.

Charity no: sc000754‚Äù. = Urbs Iudeu = As nearby Cramond was a Roman outpost, it is likely that it may have been used by them. The Roman presence in Scotland was not particularly strong, but Cramond is one of the most archaeologically rich sites, along with Trimontium near Melrose. The island has been identified as a likely candidate for the site of Urbs Iudeu, an early mediaeval stronghold mentioned by the Venerable Bede in his Ecclesiastical History of the English People. If so, King Osweo of Northumbria was besieged here in 655 AD by Penda of Mercia and his Welsh ally Cadafael of Gwynedd. Osweo bought off the besiegers, by ‚Äúdelivering all the treasures which were in the city into the hands of Penda, and Penda distributed them to the Kings of the British, this is called the Restitution of Iudeu‚Äù. As Iodeo, the island once gave its name to the Firth of Forth, in an early Welsh form merin Iodeo, recorded in Nennius' Historia Britonnum. = Modern era = In September 1596 James VI allowed Adam Bruntfield and James Carmichael to fight in single combat on Cramond because Bruntfield accused Carmichael of killing his brother in treasonous circumstances. The Duke of Lennox went to the island to be the judge. Bruntfield killed Carmichael.John Mackenzie, A chronicle of the Kings of Scotland from Fergus the First, to James the Sixth (Edinburgh, 1830), pp. 156-7. ‚ÄúThe British Wool Society grazed sheep on the island in the 1790s and the land was farmed for many years until the last farmer, Peter Hogg, died in 1904.‚Äùibid. Throughout most of its history, Cramond Island was used for farming, especially sheep-farming, and perhaps served as a fishing outpost as well. The island was once famous for its oyster beds, but these were destroyed due to overfishing. In the north west corner of the island there are remains of a jetty built with local stone which could be medieval in origin, while towards the centre of the island, half-hidden by a small wood there is the ruin of a stone-built farmstead. It appears on an Ordnance Survey map of 1853, but may be considerably older. It was occupied until the 1930s and sheep were still kept on the island as late as the 1960s. = World War I = In 1914 a 'Middle Line' of defences was established across the Firth of Forth, to protect an anchorage for warships between the line and the Forth Bridge. An anti-submarine net ran from Cramond Island to Inchmickery, to Inchcolm and to the Fife coast. The three islands were armed with 14 x 12-pdr guns, two of which were mounted on Cramond. = World War II = WW2-era fortifications on Cramond Island At the outbreak of World War II, Cramond Island, along with other islands in the Forth, was refortified and armed with two 12-pdr guns, and a modern 6-pdr twin equipment, designed specifically to tackle fast-moving torpedo boats. An anti-submarine net and anti-boat boom was laid across the estuary from Cramond Island directly to Inchcolm, and then to the Charles Hill battery on the Fife coast. The barrier was to protect ships in the anchorage from attack by torpedo boats, and to stop submarines entering the anchorage to attack shipping or to damage the dock gate of Rosyth Dockyard. The line of concrete pylons was built from Cramond Island to the shore to complete the anti-boat barrier (which is often misidentified as an anti-submarine barrier - the water is far too shallow). After crossing the causeway, the first structures are the emplacements for a 75 mm gun and its associated searchlight. Several WW2 buildings survive, including the housings for Coast Artillery Search Lights, stores, shelters and gun emplacements, as well as two engine rooms that once contained all the equipment necessary to supply power to the military installations on the island. The anchor points for the anti- submarine net and anti-boat boom are visible at the north end of the island at low tide. Further along the northern coast, low concrete stumps protrude from the undergrowth, all that remain of the barracks that housed the garrison on the island. On the western side is a small brick building of unknown purpose. Nearby, perched precariously on the rocky shore is the ruin of a small square building which was used as an ammunition store during the war, though its stone construction suggests it is much older than either World War, possibly contemporary with the farmstead in the middle of the island.

Its function, under the Karnataka Town and Country Planning Act of 1961, is as a regulatory body required \\"to prepare in the prescribed manner a Comprehensive Development Plan\\" for the Bangalore metropolitan region. It also oversees planning and development of infrastructure, provision of development-related sites and services, the housing needs of underprivileged citizens in Bangalore and is currently the city's largest land developer. No other authority or person may undertake development within the Bangalore Metropolitan Region without the permission of the BDA.  Background  BDA was created on 6 January 1976 under the Bangalore Development Authority Act 1976 superseding the earlier civic authority known as the City Improvement Trust Board (CITB), but remaining nearly identical in function. The BDA is a largely unelected local authority (2 out of 23 members are elected BBMP corporators) with most of its members accountable to, and directly appointed by the state government. This creates issues with local representation, particularly since the passage of the Constitution (74th) Amendment Act, 1992 mandating the devolution of planning powers to local, elected authorities. Despite being the principle planning authority, up to 90% of new residential layouts on the Bangalore periphery do not have formal approval from the BDA. Over time, these layouts tend to be regularized by successive state governments, however they exhibit all of the issues associated with ad hoc residential development including irregular road layouts, boundary encroachments and lack of provision for essential services and infrastructure. Corruption has always been an issue within the BDA, with one particularly notorious scandal being the illegal sale of up to 200 sites in 1995 by corrupt BDA officials. In the 1990s the BDA came under sustained criticism including the Public Affairs Center's 1993 report cards on BDA performance; the CUMB Report of 1997 which examined the role and function of the BDA and concluded that the organization had outlived its mandate, was failing as a development authority and should be disbanded; and a 1999 report by the World Bank which labelled it one of the most corrupt and inefficient institutions in the city. The same report also reported on the findings of a citizen survey which found 65% of Bangaloreans dissatisfied with their experience dealing with the BDA, and just 1% satisfied‚Äîthe lowest of any civic agency in the city. It was also receiving the highest share of bribes (33%) in exchange for expediting service outcomes. The BDA is credited with responding to these findings with some reforms in operational management and asset monitoring and accounting practices leading to a substantial increase in residential layout development and allocation. In 2008 the Kasturirangan Report reaffirmed that as both developer and land regulator, the BDA has neglected its regulatory role, but gained some additional credibility through the successful delivery of major infrastructure projects including the Outer Ring Road, and various flyovers and underpasses throughout the city. The report recommended land regulation responsibilities be handed over to other municipal bodies such as the BBMP with the BDA focusing on its function as a development body.

Overview A major renovation was completed in December 2006. The US$17 million project financed by loans from the St Kitts-Nevis-Anguilla National Bank and Taiwan, includes expansion of the parking apron to accommodate six- wide-bodied aircraft at the same time, complete resurfacing of the runway and construction of a new taxi-way. Construction started late 2004. Up to 6 wide bodied jets can now be accommodated on the tarmac. The airport can accommodate commercial jumbo jets and handles scheduled non-stop jet flights to Canada and the United States, as well as numerous regional commuter flights from within the Caribbean area. The airport also provides facilities for cargo and private jets. The largest aircraft ever to land here was a Boeing 747-400.

This resulted in the aircraft having 695m less available for takeoff, compared to the correct taxiway entry. The takeoff was however completed normally with no injuries or other damages. The AAIB concluded in its report that the following factors contributed to the incident: \\"The airport authority had not installed any taxiway or holding point signs on the airfield. The crew did not brief the taxi routing. The crew misidentified Taxiway Bravo for Taxiway Alpha and departed from Intersection Bravo. The trainee ATCO did not inform the flight crew that they were at Intersection Bravo.\\" References External links * Bradshaw International Airport Bradshaw International Airport Bradshaw International Airport ","title":"Robert L.

Though the book is classified as non-fiction, the Boston Globe alleges that the book contains significant fictional elements, that many of the key events propelling the drama did not occur in real life, and that others were exaggerated greatly. The book was adapted into the movies 21 and The Last Casino. Synopsis The book's main character is Kevin Lewis, an MIT graduate who was invited to join the MIT Blackjack Team in 1993. Lewis was recruited by two of the team's top players, Jason Fisher and Andre Martinez. The team was financed by a colorful character named Micky Rosa, who had organized at least one other team to play the Vegas strip. This new team was the most profitable yet. Personality conflicts and card counting deterrent efforts at the casinos eventually ended this incarnation of the MIT Blackjack Team. Characters =Kevin Lewis= Although not revealed in the book, Kevin Lewis's real name is Jeff Ma, an MIT student who graduated with a degree in Mechanical Engineering in 1994. Ma has since gone on to found a fantasy sports company called Citizen Sports (a stock market simulation game). Mezrich acknowledges that Lewis is the sole major character based on a single, real-life individual; other characters are composites. Nonetheless, Lewis does things in the book that Ma himself says did not occur. =Jason Fisher= One of the leaders of the team, Jason Fisher, is modeled in part after Mike Aponte. After his professional card counting career, Aponte went on to win the 2004 World Series of Blackjack, and started a company called the Blackjack Institute. Mike also has his own blog. =Micky Rosa= The team's principal leader, Micky Rosa is a composite character based primarily on Bill Kaplan, JP Massar, and John Chang. Bill Kaplan founded and led the MIT Blackjack Team in the 1980s and co-managed the team with Massar and Chang from 1992 to 1993, during which time Jeff Ma joined the then nearly 80 person team. The Allston-Brighton Tab: Kaplan Inspires Hollywood Film '21.' Retrieved April 12, 2008. MickeyRosa.com 'House of Cards' Retrieved July 31, 2008. Chang has questioned the book's veracity, telling The Boston Globe, \\"I don't even know if you want to call the things in there exaggerations, because they're so exaggerated they're basically untrue.\\" Whether the MIT Blackjack Team was \\"founded ... in the 1980s\\" is in dispute. An article in The Tech, January 16, 1980, suggests that Roger Demaree and JP Massar were already running the team and teaching a hundred MIT students to play blackjack by the third week of the 1980s, implying that the team had been founded in the late 1970s, before Kaplan joined, although Demaree and Massar have mostly avoided publicity.http://tech.mit.edu/archives/VOL_099/TECH_V099_S0589_P002.pdf Controversy =Boston Magazine and Boston Globe articles= In its March 2008 edition, Boston magazine ran an article investigating long-lingering claims that the book was substantially fictional. The Boston Globe followed up with a more detailed story on April 6, 2008. Though published as a factual account and originally categorized under \\"Current Events\\" in the hardcover Free Press edition, Bringing Down the House \\"is not a work of 'nonfiction' in any meaningful sense of the word,\\" according to Globe reporter Drake Bennett. Mezrich not only exaggerated freely, according to sources for both articles, but invented whole parts of the story, including some pivotal events in the book that never happened to anyone. =Disclaimer and leeway= The book contains the following disclaimer: > The names of many of the characters and locations in this book have been > changed, as have certain physical characteristics and other descriptive > details. Some of the events and characters are also composites of several > individual events or persons.Mezrich, Ben, Bringing Down the House: The > Inside Story of Six M.I.T. Students Who Took Vegas for Millions (New York: > Free Press, 2002), p. iv. This disclaimer allows broad leeway to take real events and real people and alter them in any way the author sees fit. But Mezrich went further, both articles say. =Historical inaccuracies= The following events described in Bringing Down the House did not occur: * Underground Chinatown Casino. The underground casino used for Kevin's final test (pp. 55‚Äì59) is entirely imaginary, according to Mike Aponte and Dave Irvine. * Use of Strippers to Cash Out Chips. Also according to Aponte and Irvine, strippers were never recruited to cash out the team's chips, as described on pp. 149‚Äì153. * Shadowy Investors. The \\"shadowy investors\\" first referenced on p. 3 are a major source of intrigue for Mezrich's story, but did not exist, according to Aponte and Irvine. The investors in the team included the players, one of Kaplan's college roommates, a few of Kaplan's Harvard Business School section mates, and Kaplan's friends and family members. * Physical Assault. The scene in which Fisher is beaten up (pp. 221‚Äì225) is imaginary. \\"No one was ever beaten up,\\" according to Aponte and Irvine. Moreover, Jeff Ma claims they have never been roughed up by the casinos they played in. Still there were times when casino employees had tried to intimidate the members of the team. *Player Forced to Swallow Chip. In a scene on pp. 215‚Äì218, Micky Rosa recounts a story in which Vincent Cole‚Äîa private investigator for Plymouth Investigations‚Äîforces a member of a count team to swallow a purple casino chip while detaining the player in a back room. Sources in the Globe described the story as \\"implausible,\\" and none recalled having heard it. *Theft of $75,000. One MIT player, Kyle Schaffer, did lose $20,000 when it was stolen from a desk drawer. Mezrich inflates the amount of the theft by 275% and turns the desk drawer into a safe pried dramatically from a wall. Moreover, the robbery scene (pp. 240‚Äì244) creates the impression that a team member or Vincent Cole was the likely culprit. Schaffer says the theft was likely unrelated to blackjack, noting that $100,000 or more in casino chips also inside the drawer was left untouched (\\"strongly suggesting that the thieves had no idea of their worth\\"). *Forcible Entry to Kevin Lewis's Apartment. Kevin hurries from the scene of the robbery to his own apartment (pp. 244‚Äì245) to make sure all is well. Nothing has been stolen, but Kevin finds \\"a single purple casino chip sitting on his kitchen table.\\" The implication is that the chip is a calling card left by Vincent Cole as a warning to Kevin. This scene again asks readers to accept that the chip-swallowing story is factual (or at least was actually in circulation among MIT counters as a myth). Sequel Though not originally intended to have a sequel, Mezrich followed this book with Busting Vegas (). Busting Vegas is about another splinter group from the MIT Blackjack Team. The events depicted in Busting Vegas actually took place before Bringing Down the House. Despite heavy marketing, Busting Vegas did not do as well as Bringing Down the House. It did, however, briefly appear on The New York Times Best Seller list. Despite again being listed as non-fiction Busting Vegas showed similar inaccuracies in recounting the facts with the main character Semyon Dukach contesting several of the events depicted in the book. Film adaptation A film adaptation of the book, titled 21 (so as not to cause confusion with the unrelated 2003 Queen Latifah vehicle Bringing Down the House), was released in theaters on March 28, 2008.Production Weekly: Luketic Hacking Las Vegas. Retrieved March 6, 2007. The film is from Columbia Pictures and was directed by Robert Luketic. Kevin Spacey produced the film, and also portrays the character of Micky Rosa. Other cast members include Laurence Fishburne, Kate Bosworth, Jim Sturgess, Jacob Pitts, Liza Lapira, Aaron Yoo, and Sam Golzari.benmezrich.com. Retrieved March 6, 2007 Jeff Ma, Bill Kaplan, and Henry Houh, another team player from the 1990s, have brief cameo roles in the movie. 21 was filmed outside the buildings of MIT, in Boston University classrooms and dorms, throughout Cambridge and Boston, and in Las Vegas.

The drawing is in charcoal and black and white chalk, on eight sheets of paper glued together. Because of its large size and format the drawing is presumed to be a cartoon for a painting. No painting by Leonardo exists that is based directly on this cartoon. The drawing depicts the Virgin Mary seated on the knees of her mother, Saint Anne, while holding the Christ Child as Christ's young cousin, John the Baptist, stands to the right. It currently hangs in the National Gallery in London. It was either executed in around 1499‚Äì1500, at the end of the artist's first Milanese period, or around 1506‚Äì1508, when he was travelling back and forth between Florence and Milan. The majority of scholars favour the latter date, although the National Gallery and others prefer the former. Subject Preparatory drawing in the British Museum The subject of the cartoon is a combination of two themes popular in Florentine painting of the 15th century: The Virgin and Child with John the Baptist and Virgin and Child with Saint Anne. The drawing is notable for its complex composition, demonstrating the alternation in the positioning of figures that is first apparent in Leonardo's paintings in the Benois Madonna. The knees of the two women point different directions, with Mary's knees turning out of the painting to the left, while her body turns sharply to the right, creating a sinuous movement. The knees and the feet of the figures establish a strong up- and-down rhythm at a point in the composition where a firm foundation comprising firmly planted feet, widely spread knees and broad spread of enclosing garment would normally be found. While the lower halves of their bodies turn away, the faces of the two women turn towards each other, mirroring each other's features. The delineation between the upper bodies has lost clarity, suggesting that the heads are part of the same body. The twisting movement of the Virgin is echoed in the Christ Child, whose body, held almost horizontal by his mother, rotates axially, with the lower body turned upward and the upper body turned downward. This turning posture is first indicated in Leonardo's painting in the Adoration of the Magi and is explored in a number of drawings, in particular the various studies of the Virgin and Child with a cat which are in the British Museum. The juxtaposition of two sets of heads is an important compositional element. The angle, lighting and gaze of the Christ Child reproduces that of his mother, while John the Baptist reproduces these same elements in the face of Saint Anne. The lighting indicates that there are two protagonists, and two supporting cast in the scene that the viewer is witnessing. There is a subtle interplay between the gazes of the four figures. Saint Anne smiles adoringly at her daughter Mary, perhaps indicating not only maternal pride but also the veneration due to the one who \\"all generations will call...blessed\\".from the Magnificat Mary's eyes are fixed on the Christ Child who raises his hand in a gesture of benediction over the cousin who thirty years later would carry out his appointed task of baptising Christ. Although the older of the two children, John the Baptist humbly accepts the blessing, as one who would later say of his cousin \\"I am not worthy even to unloose his sandals.\\" John's Gospel, Chapter 1, verse 27. Saint Anne's hand, her index finger pointing towards the Heaven, is positioned near the heads of the children, perhaps to indicate the original source of the blessing. This enigmatic gesture is regarded as quintessentially Leonardesque, occurring in The Last Supper and Saint John the Baptist. Bernardino Luini, Holy Family with Saint Anne and the infant John the Baptist Cartoons of this sort were usually transferred to a board for painting by pricking or incising the outline. In the Virgin and Child with Saint Anne and Saint John the Baptist this has not been done, suggesting that the drawing has been kept as a work of art in its own right.National Gallery Website Leonardo's cartoon of the Virgin and Child with St Anne and John the Baptist Leonardo does not appear to have based a painting directly on this drawing. The composition differs from Leonardo's only other surviving treatment of the subject, The Virgin and Child with Saint Anne in the Louvre, in which the figure of the Baptist is not present. A painting based on the cartoon was made by a pupil of Leonardo, Bernardino Luini, and is now in the Biblioteca Ambrosiana, Milan. The figure of Pomona in Francesco Melzi's painting Vertumnus and Pomona in the Gem√§ldegalerie, Berlin, is based on that of the Virgin in the cartoon. Francesco Melzi, Vertumnus and Pomona History The date and place of execution of the cartoon is disputed. The earliest reference to it is by the biographer Giorgio Vasari who, writing in the mid 16th century, says that the work was created while Leonardo was in Florence, as a guest of the Servite Monastery. Vasari says that for two days people young and old flocked to see the drawing as if they were attending a festival.Giorgio Vasari, Lives of the Artists, Penguin Classics, translated: George Bull, (1965) pp. 255‚Äì271, This would date the cartoon to about 1500. A date of 1498‚Äì99 is put on the work by Padre Sebastiano Resta who wrote to Giovanni Pietro Bellori saying that Leonardo had drawn the cartoon in Milan at the request of Louis XII of France. While this date has gained wide acceptance, the association with Louis XII has not. More recent historians have dated the work as early as the mid 1490s and, in the case of Carlo Pedretti and Kenneth Clark, as late as 1508‚Äì1510.Jack Wasserman, \\"The Dating and Patronage of Leonardo's Burlington House Cartoon\\", The Art Bulletin (1971) Martin Kemp notes that the hydraulic engineering in the preparatory drawing in the British Museum dates the composition to around 1507‚Äì1508, when Leonardo was making similar studies in the Codex Atlanticus. In the 17th century the drawing belonged to the Counts Arconati of Milan. In 1721 it passed to the Casnedis, then to the Sagredo in Venice. In 1763 it was acquired by Robert Udny. By 1791 it was inventoried as belonging to the Royal Academy, London.Angela Ottino della Chiesa, The Complete Paintings of Leonardo da Vinci, Penguin, (1967), It is sometimes still known as \\"The Burlington House Cartoon\\", in reference to the building housing the Royal Academy. In 1962 the cartoon was put on sale for ¬£800,000., p. 194 Amid fears that it would find an overseas buyer, it was exhibited in the National Gallery where it was seen by over a quarter of a million people in a little over four months, many of whom made donations in order to keep it in the United Kingdom. The price was eventually met, thanks in part to contributions from the National Art Collections Fund. Ten years after its acquisition, John Berger wrote derisively that \\"It has acquired a new kind of impressiveness. Not because of what it shows ‚Äì not because of the meaning of its image. It has become impressive, mysterious because of its market value\\".John Berger, Ways of Seeing, Penguin (1972) In 1987, the cartoon was attacked in an act of vandalism with a sawn-off shotgun from a distance of approximately seven feet. The shooter was identified as a mentally ill man by the name of Robert Cambridge who claimed he committed this act in order to bring attention to \\"political, social and economic conditions in Britain.\\" The blast shattered the glass covering, causing significant damage to the artwork which has since been restored.

He is best known for his work on mental causation, the mind-body problem and the metaphysics of supervenience and events. Key themes in his work include: a rejection of Cartesian metaphysics, the limitations of strict psychophysical identity, supervenience, and the individuation of events. Kim's work on these and other contemporary metaphysical and epistemological issues is well represented by the papers collected in Supervenience and Mind: Selected Philosophical Essays (1993). Biography Kim took two years of college in Seoul, South Korea as a French literature major, before transferring to Dartmouth College in 1955. Soon after, at Dartmouth, he changed to a combined major in French, mathematics, and philosophy and received a B.A. degree. After Dartmouth, he went to Princeton University, where he earned his Ph.D. in philosophy. Kim was the Emeritus William Herbert Perry Faunce Professor of Philosophy at Brown University (since 1987). He also taught at Swarthmore College, Cornell University, the University of Notre Dame, Johns Hopkins University, and, for many years, at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. From 1988‚Äì1989, he was president of the American Philosophical Association, Central Division. Since 1991, he has been a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Along with Ernest Sosa, he was a joint editor of the quarterly philosophical journal No√ªs. According to Kim, two of his major philosophical influences are Carl Hempel and Roderick Chisholm. Hempel, who sent him a letter encouraging him to go to Princeton, was a \\"formative influence\\". More specifically, Kim claims that he hopes he learned \\"a certain style of philosophy, one that emphasizes clarity, responsible argument, and aversion to studied obscurities and feigned profundities.\\" From Chisholm he learned \\"not to fear metaphysics.\\" This allowed him to go beyond the logical positivist approaches, that he had learned from Hempel, in his investigations in metaphysics and the philosophy of mind. Although not a logical positivist, Kim's work always respected the limitations on philosophical speculation imposed by the sciences. Work Kim's philosophical work focuses on the areas of philosophy of mind, metaphysics, action theory, epistemology, and philosophy of science. =Philosophy of mind= Kim has defended various mind-body theories during his career. He began defending a version of the identity theory in the early 1970s, and then moved to a non-reductive version of physicalism, which relied heavily on the supervenience relation.Kim, 1984. Kim eventually rejected strict physicalism on the grounds that provided an insufficient basis for resolving the mind-body problem. In particular, he concluded that the hard problem of consciousness‚Äîaccording to which a detailed and comprehensive neurophysical description of the brain would still not account for the fact of consciousness‚Äîis insurmountable in the context of a thoroughgoing physicalism. His arguments against physicalism can be found in his two latest monographs: Mind in a Physical World (1998) and Physicalism, or Something Near Enough (2005). Kim claims \\"that physicalism will not be able to survive intact and in its entirety.\\"Kim, 2005, p. 31. This, according to Kim, is because qualia (the phenomenal or qualitative aspect of mental states) cannot be reduced to physical states or processes. Kim claims that \\"phenomenal mental properties are not functionally definable and hence functionally irreducible\\"Kim, 2005, p. 29. and \\"if functional reduction doesn't work for qualia, nothing will\\" Thus, there is an aspect of the mind that physicalism cannot capture. In his later years, Kim defended the thesis that intentional mental states (e.g., beliefs and desires) can be functionally reduced to their neurological realizers, but that the qualitative or phenomenal mental states (e.g., sensations) are irreducibly non-physical and epiphenomenal. He, thus defended a version of dualism, although Kim argues that it is physicalism near enough. As of March, 2008, Kim still saw physicalism to be the most comprehensive worldview that is irreplaceable with any other world view.Kim, Kihyeon, \\"ÏÑ∏Í≥ÑÏ†Å Ï≤†ÌïôÏûê 7Î™Ö Î¶¥Î†àÏù¥ Ïù∏ÌÑ∞Î∑∞ ‚ëß¬∑ÎÅù ÍπÄÏû¨Í∂å ÎØ∏ Î∏åÎùºÏö¥ÎåÄ ÏÑùÏ¢åÍµêÏàò (Relay Interview with 7 World Renown Philosophers ‚ëß End: Jaegwon Kim, William Herbert Perry Faunce Professor of Philosophy at Brown University)\\", Joongang Ilbo Newspaper article, March 8, 2008. In a 2008 interview with Korean daily newspaper Joongang Ilbo, Kim stated that we must seek a naturalistic explanation for mind because mind is a natural phenomenon, and supernatural explanation only provides \\"one riddle over another\\". He believed that any correct explanation for the nature of mind would come from natural science rather than philosophy or psychology. = Argument against non-reductive physicalism= Figure demonstration how M1 and M2 are not reduced to P1 and P2. Kim has raised an objection based on causal closure and overdetermination to non-reductive physicalism.(2003) \\"Blocking Causal Drainage and Other Maintenance Chores with Mental Causation\\", Philosophy and Phenomenological Research 67.1: 151-76. The non-reductive physicalist is committed to following three principles: the irreducibility of the mental to the physical, some version of mental-physical supervenience, and the causal efficaciousness of mental states. The problem, according to Kim, is that when these three commitments are combined with a few other well-accepted principles, an inconsistency is generated that entails the causal impotence of mental properties. The first principle, which most ontological physicalists would accept, is the causal closure of the physical domain, according to which, every physical effect has a sufficient physical cause. The second principle Kim notes is that of causal exclusion, which holds that no normal event can have more than one sufficient cause. The problem is that a behavior cannot have as its cause, both a physical event and a (supervening) mental event, without resulting in a case of overdetermination (thus violating the principle of causal exclusion). The result is that physical causes exclude mental states from causally contributing to the behavior. In detail: he proposes (using the chart on the right) that M1 causes M2 (these are mental events) and P1 causes P2 (these are physical events). M1 has P1 as its supervenience base, and M2 has P2 as its supervenience base. The only way for M1 to cause M2, is by causing its supervenience base P2 (a case of mental-to- physical causation). If P1 causes P2, and M1 causes P2, then we have a case of causal overdetermination. Applying the principle of causal-exclusion, either P1 or M1 must be eliminated as a cause of P2. Given the principle of the causal closure of the physical domain, M1 is excluded. The non-reductive physicalist is forced to choose between two unappealing options: one could reject the causal-exclusion principle and claim that in this scenario we are dealing with a genuine case of overdetermination, or one could embrace epiphenomenalism. Kim argues that mental causation can only be preserved by rejecting the premise of irreducibility in favor of reduction; in order for mental properties to be considered causally efficacious, they must be reducible to physical properties. =Metaphysics= Kim's work in metaphysics focuses primarily on events and properties. Kim developed an event identity theory, but has not defended it recently. This theory holds that events are identical if and only if they occur in the same time and place and instantiate the same property. Thus if one waves ten fingers, several events occur, including the waving of an even number of fingers, the event of waving fingers that are evenly divisible by five, and evenly divisible by ten. Some have criticized his theory as producing too many events. Kim also theorized that events are structured. He is known for a property-exemplification account of events. They are composed of three things: Object(s), a property and time or a temporal interval. Events are defined using the operation [x, P, t]. A unique event is defined by two principles: the existence condition and the identity condition. The existence condition states \\"[x, P, t] exists if and only if object x exemplifies the n-adic P at time t\\". This means a unique event exists if the above is met. The identity condition states \\"[x, P, t] is [y, Q, t\`] if and only if x=y, P=Q and t=t\`\\". =Epistemology= Kim is a critic of the naturalized epistemology popularized by Willard Van Orman Quine in the latter half of the twentieth century. Kim's influential article \\"What is 'Naturalized Epistemology'?\\" (1988) argues that \\"naturalized\\" epistemologies like Quine's are not proper epistemologies as they are merely descriptive in scope, while one generally expects an \\"epistemology\\" to make normative claims about knowledge. Kim argues that mere description of belief-forming practices cannot account for justified belief. (He also argues that to even individuate beliefs, the naturalized epistemologist must presuppose normative criteria of justification.) Naturalized epistemology cannot address the issue of justification, and therefore it does not share the same aspiration as the traditional approach to epistemology.

Fuchs was the second wheeled armoured vehicle to enter service with the Bundeswehr (West German Military) and it can be used for tasks including troop transport, engineer transport, bomb disposal, Nuclear, Biological and Chemical reconnaissance and electronic warfare. RMMV and its predecessors manufactured 1,236 Fuchs 1, mostly for the German Army. Further development of the design resulted in the Fuchs 2, first shown in 2001. The enhanced Fuchs 2 is currently in production, known customers include Algerian Army, Kuwait Army and the United Arab Emirates Army (UAE). Development In 1977, Rheinstahl Wehrtechnik (which in 1996 became Henschel Wehrtechnik (subsequently Rheinmetall Landsysteme and now Rheinmetall MAN Military Vehicles (RMMV), under licence from Daimler-Benz, was awarded a contract by the German Army for 996 Transportpanzer Fuchs 1. The first production vehicle was handed over in December 1979 with deliveries running at 160 per year and concluding in late 1986. German Army designations for Fuchs 1 as delivered were: *TPz 1/Standard, 504 delivered (TPz 1 Standard could be fitted with various installation kits for different battlefield missions) *TPz 1A1/EloKa, 87 delivered (not amphibious) *TPz 1A2/Funk, 265 delivered (fitted with a Mission Kit(installation kit) for various roles) *TPz 1A3/ABC or Sp√ºrpanzer Fuchs, 140 delivered (NBC reconnaissance vehicle). For use in the former Yugoslavia, by early 1998 the German Army had upgraded 55 Fuchs 1 with additional protection. As a further development of the Fuchs 1, two pre- production Fuchs KRK (Krisenreaktionskr√§fte - German: \\"Crisis Reaction Forces\\") were built in 1997, with production vehicle options for 50 units expected in 1999. The type never entered quantity production. In 2002, the German BWB announced that it had awarded a ‚Ç¨45 million contract to upgrade 123 Fuchs 1 APCs. The work was carried out between 2004-2007 at Kassel, where the vehicles were originally built. Vehicles upgraded under this contract were given the TPz A7 designation. The latest upgraded Fuchs 1 are given the TPz A8 designation, deliveries of these first made to the German Army in March 2008. It introduced improved protection against mines and IEDs, specially for German units stationed in Afghanistan.Prezentacja Fuchsa 1A8 in: \\"Raport - Wojsko Technika Obronno≈õƒá\\" Nr. 12/2008, p. 73 The most recent TPz A8 upgrade award brought totals to 168 vehicles. Late in 2013, it was stated that, in the long term, the German Army planned to retain a fleet of up to 728 Fuchs 1 upgraded to TPz A8 standard. Continued development of the Fuchs 1 resulted in the Fuchs 2, the first example of which was shown in public for the first time at the 2001 MSPO in Poland. The first order for Fuchs 2 was for Nuclear, Biological and Chemical (NBC) reconnaissance variants for the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The order was placed in 2005. In 2014, the German Ministry of Economic Affairs and Energy confirmed that it had approved the transfer of production equipment to Algeria to enable this country to undertake production of the Fuchs 2. Kuwait ordered a batch of Fuchs 2 in 2015. These will be manufactured in Germany. Description The hull of the Fuchs is constructed of all-welded armoured steel. The driver sits at the front on the left, with the vehicle commander to his right. There are doors for both driver and commander. The door windows and windscreen have metal shutters that can be closed up. When closed up, the periscopes fitted in the roof of the vehicle to the front of the driver's hatch allow visibility out of the cabin. The commander has a circular roof hatch. The troop/cargo compartment, which is at the rear of the vehicle, is long, high and wide at its widest point. On the Fuchs 2, the roof height has been raised by for greater internal volume. Two assisted doors are fitted at the rear, although on Fuchs 2 a ramp is an option. There are three or four hatches in the roof of the troop compartment. In APC configuration, the ten infantrymen carried by Fuchs 1 are seated on individual bucket-type seats, five on each side. These seats can be folded up when not required. Fuchs 2 seats up to nine on much-improved blast-resistant seating. Normal amphibious payload for Fuchs 1 is but, depending on configuration and protection options, up to 5,000 kg of cargo can be carried on land. Fuchs 2 has a maximum payload of 6000 kg. Motive power for the Fuchs 1 is provided by a Mercedes-Benz Model OM 402A V8 12.8-litre water-cooled diesel engine developing , this coupled in a powerpack set-up to a six-speed planetary gear torque converter transmission. For the Fuchs 2 the powerpack is upgraded to a MTU 6V 199 TE20 V6 11.9-litre water-cooled EURO 3 emissions compliant diesel developing , this coupled to a ZF 6HP 602 fully automatic six-speed transmission with integrated retarder. For test purposes the power pack of the Fuchs can be run outside the vehicle. The rigid Mercedes-Benz drive axles are of the hub-reduction type, fitted with differential locks and are sprung by progressively acting coil springs and shock-absorbers. Power-steering is on the front four wheels, the Fuchs 2 offering the option of a central tyre inflation system (CTIS). The 1400 R20 tyres are of the run-flat type. On land maximum speed is and operational range is 800 km. The Fuchs was designed as an amphibious vehicle, water propulsion provided by two four-bladed propellers mounted one either side of the hull at the rear. Maximum water speed is approx. 8 km/hr. For steering, the propellers can be swivelled through 360¬∞. Before entering the water, a trim vane, which is stowed on the glacis plate when travelling, is hydraulically erected. Bilge pumps are fitted. As part of the TPz A8 upgrade, the amphibious capability is removed, but the vehicles can wade up to 1.3 m. The welded steel hull of the Fuchs was designed to protect the crew from armour-piercing small arms fire and shell splinters. For service with the United Nations Implementation Force (IFOR) operating in Bosnia, a higher level of protection was required and a batch of Fuchs 1 were upgraded with passive fibre compound add-on armour package developed by IBD-Deisenroth. This armour package includes an add-on armour mounted externally on the sides of the hull; internal spall liners fitted to the hull sides, rear and roof to reduce the secondary effects of particles having penetrated the main armour; additional elements in the floor area of the front and rear compartments to provide increased protection against mines; new windows with increased protection and modification of the window protective shields. The TPz A7 upgrade included protection enhancements, as does the current TPz A8 upgrade. For the TPz A7 and A8 upgrades, additional elements protect the underside and lower part of the hull against blast and IED threats. The baseline Fuchs 2 provides protection against small arms armour-piercing attack through a full 360¬∞. To meet different threat levels the Fuchs 2 has been designed to be fitted with enhanced passive armour packages developed by IBD. To enhance survivability while conducting Military Operations in Urban Terrain (MOUT), Rheinmetall has developed a modular upgrade package for installation on tracked and wheeled armoured vehicles. A MOUT demonstrator vehicle was completed in 2008, this based on the Fuchs 1. Armament varies according to mission requirements but for Fuchs 1 can consist of a 7.62 mm Rheinmetall MG3 general purpose machine gun mounted over the commander's position. Vehicles of the Armoured Reconnaissance Battalion, Panzergrenadiers mechanized infantry, the Franco-German Brigade, the mountain infantry and the J√§gers of the German Army have previously been fitted with the MILAN anti-tank guided missile, but these are no longer in service. All vehicles have six 76 mm grenade dischargers mounted to fire forwards. Vehicles deployed to Afghanistan were equipped with a GMG grenade launcher or an M2 Browning heavy machine gun instead of an MG3. The Fuchs 2 can be fitted with a wide range of weapon systems up to and including a 30 mm cannon and 7.62 mm MG as well as various missile installations, such as anti-tank missiles. Standard equipment for the Fuchs 2 includes an NBC system and an air conditioning system. Numerous options available include an automatic fire detection and suppression system, winch, global positioning system and an auxiliary power unit (APU). Operators and export sales * 980 Fuchs 2 required. In 2014 the German Ministry of Economic Affairs and Energy confirmed that it had approved the transfer of production equipment to Algeria for production of the Fuchs 2 (6 √ó 6) family of vehicles. The first export licence for the Fuchs 2 for Algeria was approved in 2011 followed by approval for production sets to Algeria in August 2013. In June 2014 Rheinmetall confirmed that the contract was worth EUR2.7 billion (USD3.7 billion) and covered the supply of 980 units. The first batch of 54 Fuchs 2 for Algeria have come from the German production line and will be followed by progressive transfer of production to Algeria, but with major subsystems such as power packs and drive lines continuing to come from Germany. * 996 Fuchs 1 delivered from 1979. 45 additional Fuchs 1 ordered in 1991. Various upgrades undertaken including 124 to TPz A7 standard and 168 to latest TPz A8 standard (728 required). * 8 Fuchs NBC were loaned from German Army stocks during the first Gulf War. These are thought to remain in use. * 11 Fuchs 1. 12 Fuchs 2 ordered in mid-2015. These will be in NBC reconnaissance configuration, and deliveries will start in 2017. The contract also covers training, service and spare parts. * 24 electronic warfare Fuchs 1 variants delivered. In 2006 12 of these were converted to an NBC role. * 8 Fuchs 1 NBC. * 36 Fuchs 1 were delivered some time ago (exact date unknown). 14 APC, 8 ambulance, 4 command post, 10 NBC. * Two Fuchs 1 were loaned during the first Gulf War and later returned. * 32 Fuchs 2 NBC reconnaissance vehicles ordered in February 2005 under a contract valued at EUR160 million (USD205 million). The order comprises 16 NBC reconnaissance vehicles, eight bio vehicles and eight command post vehicles, which will provide the UAE with a complete NBC detection capability linked to a command-and-control system. * 11 Fuchs 1 NBC variants (ex-German Army) delivered in 1990. These vehicles were put into storage in 2011 but a regeneration project was launched in February 2014. Eight vehicles are used by Falcon Squadron, Royal Tank Regiment, 22 Engineer Regiment with one attrition reserve and two training vehicles. The Fuchs Regeneration and Availability Service contract secured the vehicle‚Äôs service life until 2019.. The UK also used a small number of electronic warfare versions during the 1991 Gulf War https://scontent- lhr8-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/84357144_10157162265074716_6514089228970754048_n.jpg?_nc_cat=109&_nc_ohc=spi-8RqPWJAAX92J1x7&_nc_ht=scontent- lhr8-1.xx&oh;=0c12290b7bce61cba2ae6114ff4a0db5&oe;=5EB8DCBA In October 2020, RBSL (Reheinmetall BAE Systems Land) announced a ¬£16 million sustainment contract award for the UK MoD's Fuchs fleet and training simulator. The award will address equipment-related obsolescence issues and upgrade the system with the latest generation of sensing capabilities. The new support contract includes technical support, provision of spares and repairs, maintenance, training, and design services. * 123 (current estimate) Fuchs 1 designated M93 Fox. The General Dynamics Land Systems (GDLS) M93 Fox NBCRS (Nuclear Biological Chemical Reconnaissance System) vehicle is the US variant of the Fuchs 1 NBC reconnaissance vehicle. The requirement for an NBC reconnaissance vehicle, for use by US Forces in the European theatre, was first recognised and a three-phase programme initiated in the late 1980s. The first phase of the project involved the evaluation of three vehicles types; the Fuchs (M93) being selected in July 1989. Phase II of the programme, the Interim System Production (ISP) phase, resulted in the purchase of 48 vehicles. The Phase II vehicles were provided in two batches, one of eight vehicles and the other of 40. Phase II was completed in 1993. Phases III and IV would have included the US-licensed production of an additional 210 vehicles, supplementing the 48 already produced. In mid-1995, it was announced that the US Army had already received a previously unannounced batch of 60 ex-German Army vehicles for Operation Desert Storm. When in use by the US Army in the first Gulf War these were known by the XM93 designation. Due to downsizing of the US Army, the 210 vehicles to be purchased in Phases III and IV were not ordered. Under a number of contract awards from 1991 until around 2002, and through an interim XM931 designation, at least 128 vehicles were upgraded to M93A1 standard. From 2005, 31 vehicles were further upgraded in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom to M93A1P1 standard. To support operations in the Southwest Asia (SWA) region, an Urgent Material Requirement (UMR) was issued covering various upgrades to P2 standard for the M93A1P1. The exact number of M93 Fox NBCRS in service with the US Armed Forces is not clear. It is thought that the fleet comprised 122 vehicles, though the exact mix of M93A1, M93A1P1 and M93A1P2 variants is unknown. The previous mix, , was 86 M93A1, 22 of the M93A1P1 and 14 M93A1P2, with upgrades from the earlier variants to the M93A1P2 standard ongoing. The M93 is expected to be replaced in US service by the Stryker NBCRV. * 10 Fuchs 1 were ordered and delivered in 1983. These vehicles did not have the standard NBC system installed but had 76 mm smoke grenade dischargers, an 8000 kg capacity winch, an air conditioning system and two roof-mounted weapon systems. To the rear of the engine compartment is a Rheinmetall Landsysteme one-person turret with an externally mounted 12.7 mm heavy machine gun while behind this and facing the rear is a 7.62 mm light machine gun. These vehicles have full amphibious capability. Venezuela has fitted the US 106 mm M40A1 recoilless rifle to the roof of several vehicles.  Gallery  File:TPz1.Fuchs.Pionier.jpgTPz1 Fuchs Pionier.

Three fossil species have been recovered from the Crato Formation ‚Äì late Aptian (Lower Cretaceous) strata located in the Araripe Basin in northeastern Brazil. Taxonomy German naturalist Friedrich Markgraf coined the name Welwitschiaceae in 1926, which appeared in Die Nat√ºrlichen Pflanzenfamilien. Most recent systems place the Welwitschiaceae in the gymnosperm order Gnetales.Stevens, P. F. (2001 onwards). Angiosperm Phylogeny Website. Version 9, June 2008 http://www.mobot.org/MOBOT/research/APWeb/ This order is most closely related to the order Pinales, which includes pines, spruces, larches and firs. Genetic analyses indicate that the Gnetales arose from within the conifer group, and any morphological similarities between angiosperms and Gnetales have evolved separately.Chaw S-M., C.L. Parkinson, Y. Cheng, T.M. Vincent and J. D. Palmer (2000) Seed plant phylogeny inferred from all three plant genomes: Monophyly of extant gymnosperms and origin of Gnetales from conifers Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America 97:4086‚Äì4091 The ancestors of the extant gymnosperm orders‚ÄîGnetales, Coniferales, Cycadales and Ginkgoales‚Äîarose during the Late Paleozoic, and became the dominant component of the Late Permian and Mesozoic flora. Living species The family contains a single genus and single extant species, Welwitschia mirabilis, which lives in the Kaokoveld Desert of Angola and Namibia in southwestern Africa. Fossil species Fossil evidence indicates that members of the Welwitschiaceae were present in South America during the Early Cretaceous (Mesozoic era). Priscowelwitschia austroamericana (initially named Welwitschiella but illegitimate due to the daisy genus Welwitschiella) is a fossil taxon referring to some seedlings with cotyledon leaves. These have many features in common with Welwitschia seedlings. Welwitschiophyllum brasiliense is a taxon known from thick triangular to linear leaves that range from 8.9 to 70 cm long and 2.8‚Äì5 cm wide. Welwitschiostrobus murili is a fossil taxon known from some cones that resemble the living Welwitschia, but are longer and thinner. Jacobson and Lester suggest that these early habitats were more mesic than the current desert conditions, and that the present fragmented and isolated population distribution could be attributed to aridification during the Paleogene, Neogene, and Quaternary, which restricted the plants to locales providing sufficient water for their needs.

Every American (national of the United States) is manifestly and automatically qualified for waiver of inadmissibility. Similarly, every person who has been firmly resettled in the United States as a refugee is statutorily entitled to waiver of inadmissibility. All other people must request this relief by filing Form I-601 (\\"Application for Waiver of Grounds of Inadmissibility\\").(a)(1); see also Background permanent resident card (green card), which lawfully permits its holder to live and work in the United States similar to that of all other Americans. Before any legal immigrant is naturalized as a U.S. citizen, he or she must be a green card holder for at least 5 years and satisfy all other U.S. citizenship requirements. Many green card holders are actually Americans without them knowing, and are thus not inadmissible to the United States.

Intranasal corticosteroids are the most effective medication for controlling symptoms. The principal mechanism of action of flunisolide is to activate glucocorticoid receptors, meaning it has an anti-inflammatory action. The effects of topical corticosteroids is not immediate and requires regular use and at least a few days to start experiencing noticeable symptom relief. As-needed use has been shown to be not as effective as regular recommended use. Flunisolide should not be used in the presence of nasal infection. It should not be continued if there is no relief of symptoms after regular use over two to three weeks. It was patented in 1958 and approved for medical use in 1978. Side effects Temporary nose and throat dryness, irritation, bleeding or unpleasant taste or smell may occur. Nasal septum perforation is rarely reported. Rare, but localized infections of the nose and pharynx with Candida albicans have been reported and long-term use may raise the chance of cataracts or glaucoma. Flunisolide nasal spray is absorbed into the circulatory system (blood). Corticosteroid nasal sprays may affect the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis function in humans. After the desired clinical effect is obtained, the maintenance dose should be reduced to the smallest amount necessary to control symptoms, which can be as low as 1 spray in each nostril a day. Utilizing the minimum effective dose will reduce possibility of side effects. Recommended amounts of intranasal corticosteroids are generally not associated with systemic side effects. Corticosteroids inhibit wound healing. Therefore, use of corticosteroid nasal sprays in patients who have experienced recent nasal septal ulcers, recurrent epistaxis, nasal surgery or trauma, a nasal corticosteroid should be used with caution until healing has occurred. In pregnancy, recommended doses of intranasal corticosteroids are safe and effective.

An accountant by profession, he was convicted in 1984 for the murder of 15-year-old Adelaide teenager Richard Kelvin, the son of local television and radio personality Rob Kelvin. von Einem is currently serving life imprisonment. He was in G Block of Yatala Prison for decades but was transferred to Port Augusta Prison in the north of the state in 2007.  The Good Samaritan  Von Einem first came to attention on the night of 10 May 1972 when two gay men were thrown into the River Torrens by a group of men believed to be police officers. The river bank was a popular beat where gay men would meet covertly, as homosexual acts were illegal in South Australia at that time. One of the men, Dr. George Duncan, a British lecturer in law who had arrived in Australia only seven weeks before, was drowned. The other, Roger James, suffered a broken leg and after crawling to the road was rescued by von Einem, who was driving past. von Einem then took James to Royal Adelaide Hospital, where he recovered from his injuries.A look back at the Duncan murder The 7.30 Report ABC 9 May 2002Duncan drowning witness talks Stateline ABC 6 May 2005  Criminal history  = Murder of Richard Kelvin = Richard Dallas Kelvin (1 December 1967 ‚Äì c. 10 July 1983), was the son of Rob Kelvin, a popular and long-time television news presenter for Adelaide station NWS 9. Kelvin was murdered by von Einem on or around 10 July 1983 in Adelaide, South Australia after having been abducted, held captive, sexually abused, drugged and tortured for five weeks. Kelvin was 15 years old at the time of his death. At approximately 6:15pm on 5 June 1983, von Einem (likely along with other unknown persons) abducted Kelvin near the intersection of Margaret Street & Peppertree Lane, North Adelaide, and was just 60 metres from Kelvin's home around the corner in Ward Street. Kelvin had just seen off a friend at a nearby bus stop on the corner of O'Connell and Marian Streets, North Adelaide after they had earlier that afternoon played football in a nearby park and was expected to return home immediately for dinner. A witness, a security guard living in Margaret Street, had heard cries for help, car doors slamming, and a car with a noisy exhaust speeding away. Kelvin also had a dog collar in his possession which may have attracted von Einem's attention. Despite a wide-ranging search by police, extensive media coverage that included a full page missing person poster in The Advertiser on 28 June (that unfortunately had contained a false lead given by the public to police), a $5,000 reward offered by the State Government two days after his disappearance (quickly raised to $15,000 a week later) and numerous tips and possible sightings provided by the public in the weeks after, Kelvin's whereabouts were unknown until his clothed body was found seven weeks later by a geologist searching for moss rocks with his family on 24 July 1983 alongside a dirt airstrip near One Tree Hill in the Adelaide Hills area (to the north- east of the city and close to where relatives of von Einem lived). Little effort was put into concealing Kelvin's body; he was found wearing the same Channel 9 shirt, blue jeans and white Adidas sneakers which he wore on the day of his abduction, together with the dog collar fitted around his neck. His body had been washed prior to being re-dressed and was found placed in the fetal position, with his legs bent towards his chest and his head forwards and his arms wrapped around his legs. This made police suspect that Kelvin had been dumped by a single person, most likely after nightfall in order to avoid detection. Richard Kelvin's headstone at Centennial Park Cemetery The autopsy revealed that Kelvin had most likely died from massive blood loss from an anal injury, probably caused by the insertion of a blunt object with a tapered neck, such as a beer bottle, and that he had suffered bruising and injuries from blows to his head, to the left side of his back and also to his right buttock as well as a fractured front tooth which occurred either just before or just after death. Analysis of Kelvin's bloodstream revealed traces of alcohol and five hypnotic drugs, Mandrax, Noctec, Amytal, Valium and Rohypnol. With Mandrax being regulated by the Central Board of Health in 1978 stocks for it in Australia had declined somewhat by 1983 and police began sifting through prescriptions for that drug in particular. During their search they found a prescription for Mandrax issued to a 'B. von Einem', a name familiar to police as he had been questioned previously over the deaths of three young men and the alleged sexual assault of another. Four days after Richard Kelvin's body was discovered, von Einem was questioned by the police about the murder. He initially claimed that he had not seen Kelvin and had no knowledge of his whereabouts and stated that on the night of abduction he had been in bed with the flu and was off work for the next week. Police also searched his home in the northern Adelaide suburb of Paradise, and seized a bottle of Mandrax. Von Einem admitted that the drugs were his and said that he used them to help him sleep. He denied having any other drugs in his possession, but police also seized a bottle of Noctec, concealed on a ledge behind his wardrobe. von Einem also allowed police to take hair and blood samples, as well as carpets and other materials for testing. There were three major factors in von Einem's initial questioning that led police to become increasingly suspicious that they had found their prime suspect: * When police knocked on von Einem's door and enquired about whether they could ask him a few questions, his immediate reaction was to say that he would not answer anything without speaking to his lawyer first. This made police suspect that he had something to hide. * When questioned about the Kelvin murder, rather than profusely denying any involvement, von Einem simply said that he would not do such a thing because it would be \\"unethical\\". This came across as a strange thing for an innocent person to say. * When asked about drugs, von Einem did admit he had Mandrax. He was asked if he kept any other drugs in his possession, and he said no. However, the police then found the bottle of Noctec and von Einem immediately became nervous and told police that he \\"rarely used those drugs\\". As von Einem went on holiday to the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom during August and September 1983, the case against him began to mount up. Forensic investigators were able to match the many fibres found on Kelvin's clothing to those taken from von Einem's home, along with hairs found which matched those belonging to him. Forensics also determined that Kelvin was murdered between 8 July and 11 July 1983 and was dumped at the airstrip no later than the 11th. However, police raids on various locations around Adelaide linked to von Einem and his associates yielded few clues. Police also searched for a man who had previously claimed to police during the investigation of the unsolved murder of Alan Barnes in 1979 that von Einem had been involved in his death and also that he was a former associate of von Einem. Barnes's fatal injuries mirrored those of Kelvin closely. The man, known as \\"Mr. B\\", was located and informed police in great detail how he and von Einem had picked up young male hitchhikers, had given them alcoholic drinks laced with hypnotic drugs, and had taken them to von Einem's previous home in the Adelaide suburb of Campbelltown, where the young men had been abused overnight and released the next day. \\"Mr B\\" also provided further information about other associates of Einem, but claimed he took no part whatsoever in any murders. Police also questioned other people whom von Einem had associated with, but they volunteered little information. With enough evidence, along with the information given by \\"Mr B\\", to indicate that Kelvin was at von Einem's home around the time of his death, police arrested and charged von Einem with murder on 3 November 1983. von Einem still denied ever coming into contact with Kelvin. The committal hearing to determine if there was sufficient evidence for von Einem to stand trial for murder began on 20 February 1984. Faced with irrefutable evidence from prosecutors that Kelvin had been in his company, von Einem suddenly changed his story to answer that evidence and admitted that he had been in contact with Kelvin on the night of 5 June 1983. von Einem said that he was driving along O'Connell Street in North Adelaide looking for a parking spot in order to buy some fish and chips for dinner. While looking for a parking spot in a side street, von Einem said that he had nearly run over Kelvin as he jogged in from his side. von Einem stated he thought Kelvin had bisexual tendencies and said that the two of them then had a conversation about problems Kelvin had been having at school, and Kelvin willingly got into the car and they drove to von Einem's home. This answered the question of how fibres from von Einem's carpet had got onto Kelvin's clothes. To answer evidence about how fibres from von Einem's bed had come to be on Kelvin's clothes, von Einem stated that the two of them had sat on his bed and played with the large gold harp which he kept in his bedroom. Police previously did see this harp in his room when they seized the drugs. Finally, to answer evidence about how fibres from von Einem's cardigan had got onto Kelvin, von Einem stated that he had put his arm around Kelvin and hugged him because Kelvin was upset about how his peers had been bullying him at school. With all the fibres being accounted for with his new story, von Einem concluded his statement by saying that Kelvin had stayed for two hours before von Einem dropped him off in the Adelaide CBD near the Royal Adelaide Hospital and gave Kelvin $20 to pay for a taxi home. Despite the intricate details of Einem's alibi and his version of events, his story had two huge problems. It completely contradicted his initial statement of his whereabouts on 5 June 1983, when he said he had been in bed with the flu. Furthermore, the quantity of fibres on Kelvin's clothes was far too large to suggest that Kelvin was in his company for only two hours. Given these facts, on 25 May 1984, Magistrate Nick Manos ordered Einem to stand trial for the murder of Kelvin. = The trial = The trial against Einem for the murder of Kelvin opened at the Supreme Court Building of South Australia on 15 October 1984 before Mr. Justice White. A jury of 12 people (seven women and five men) were selected and were agreed upon by the prosecution and defence. Einem pleaded not guilty, and his defence was led by barrister Barry Jennings, who was assisted by Helena Jasinski, who had been Einem's solicitor from the start of the police investigation of him in the murder during the previous year. The prosecution was led by Brian Martin QC (later the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory), with assistance from Paul Rofe QC (who went on to be Director of the Department of Public Prosecutions). For the prosecution, it was a matter of proving Einem's guilt (along with that of unknown persons) by presenting the strong scientific evidence that had been gathered during the investigation, and disproving Einem's story of being in contact with Kelvin on the night of 5 June 1983. For the defence, it was a case of trying to make Einem's story hold up in court, and raising doubts about his ability to keep Kelvin captive for five weeks and committing the murder. The prosecution opened their case with the jury being taken to the various sites around Adelaide that were important in the trial, and over the first week they called various witnesses to the stand. Kelvin's parents, girlfriend and best friend were called to testify that Kelvin was an average 15-year-old who would not willingly get into a car with a stranger, was heterosexual with no homosexual or bisexual tendencies, and that he had been wearing the dog collar as a joke. People living close to the Kelvins then testified that they had heard noises and commotion corresponding to the abduction taking place on the night of 5 June at around 6pm. Forensic pathologists were called to testify about the injuries to Kelvin's head and anus, and the likely cause of his death, and pharmacists gave evidence of the excessive amount of different hypnotic drugs which Einem had been prescribed (5872 tablets and capsules of six different brands of drugs between 15 December 1978 and 10 August 1983), and showed that Einem had often had prescriptions for drugs issued from three different chemists on the same day or during the same weeks. Various police who worked on the case testified to their investigation of Einem since they had first questioned him about the murder, as well as their visit to Einem's home where a police officer claimed that Einem's bedroom appeared to have been cleaned \\"extensively\\". Forensic scientists were called next to give evidence first on when Kelvin had died and when his body had been dumped in the Adelaide Hills area, and a leading entomologist claimed, from the larvae cycle of flies that were on the body, and comparing these to the larvae cycle of flies on a dead dog that was nearby, that Kelvin's body must have been dumped beside the airstrip near Kersbrook on 10 July 1983. Other forensic scientists were called to testify about the hair and fibre samples collected that were linked to Einem himself and his home. Hairs from Einem were found on and inside Kelvin's clothing and of 925 fibre samples found on Kelvin's clothing, 250 came from Einem's home environment, with just seven from Kelvin's home. The scientists stated that if Einem's story was true, then there should be a very small amount or even none of the fibres and hair samples from that night still on Kelvin's clothing some 36 hours later, let alone five weeks later. Faced with such damning scientific evidence, the defence tried to counter this during cross-examination by floating a possible theory that after Einem's last contact with Kelvin, he had been abducted by other people, who had stored his clothing for five weeks before murdering him and re-dressing him. While the forensic scientists conceded that this was a possible scenario, under renewed cross-examination by the prosecution, they conceded that it would be still unlikely given the whole science of how fibres and hair are transferred from surface to surface over time. The prosecution then rested their case. The defence opted for Einem to give an unsworn statement from the dock, rather than given sworn evidence from the witness box. In his unsworn statement, Einem detailed his alibi with what he claimed happened between 5 June and 11 July 1983. He again claimed that on 5 June he had picked up Kelvin in North Adelaide, had driven him to his home, and later had dropped him off in the Adelaide CBD. He also claimed that he was sick with the flu for the next week after that and did not return to work until 14 June. Einem was quite sketchy on his activities after that, however he did remember what he did on 10 July, the day the body was dumped on the airstrip. He said that he was at a relative's birthday party with his mother for most of that evening, and after dropping off a friend on the way home, had gone straight to bed and then to work the next day. He also addressed the issue of the noisy exhaust on the car heard during the abduction of Kelvin, by stating that the exhaust on his Ford Falcon (which Einem had sold on 16 July 1983, purportedly to raise money for his overseas trip) was less than two years old and in good condition. He closed his unsworn statement by again claiming his innocence. The defence then called various witnesses in an attempt to corroborate Einem's story. The witnesses included colleagues and friends who testified to him being unwell and at home during the first week of Kelvin's captivity. Also testifying for the defence was the bushwalker, who while walking his dogs through the airstrip had discovered Kelvin's body on 24 July. The purchaser of Einem's Ford Falcon detailed the condition of the car, and the relative who hosted the birthday party on 10 July stated that Einem and his mother had arrived there at 5:30pm and left at 10:30pm. Photographs of Einem at the party were also tendered to the court. Finally, the defence called Einem's mother to testify about her son's activities over the weekend upon which Kelvin was kidnapped. Under cross-examination, the prosecution were able to show inconsistencies in her current testimony compared to her earlier statements to police about Einem's whereabouts on the weekend of 4‚Äì5 June, which weakened the defence case considerably as this highlighted Einem's change the previous February of his account of what happened on the night of 5 June 1983. In their summation, the prosecution stated that the evidence they presented proved that Einem's story was full of lies and inconsistencies, and that he did murder (with the help of others) Kelvin. They also stated that his admission that he had picked up Kelvin showed that he was in contact with him on 5 June; that the fibres and hairs proved that Einem was with him at the time of just before and/or at the time of death; and that the drugs proved Einem was with Kelvin in between those times. The prosecution also answered the doubts raised by the defence about when on 10 July the body was dumped at the airstrip by suggesting that Einem could have dumped the body sometime very late on 10 July or in the early morning of 11 July before going to work for the day. The defence stated in their summary that the prosecution had failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt that Einem was guilty of murder and also were not able to establish the exact cause of Kelvin's death, so therefore the jury must give Einem the benefit of the doubt. Mr. Justice White then gave his summation of the trial, and in the early afternoon of 5 November 1984, the jury retired to consider their verdict. = Verdict = After 7.5 hours of deliberation, the jury returned to give their verdict. Einem was found guilty of the murder and was automatically sentenced to life at Yatala Labour Prison. Mr. Justice White imposed a non- parole period of 24 years. Under South Australian law, a third of the non- parole period could be taken off for good behaviour in prison. Based on this reckoning, Einem could conceivably have been eligible for parole in late 1999. The Attorney-General of South Australia immediately appealed the leniency of the non-parole period, and on 29 March 1985 the Court of Criminal Appeal in South Australia increased the non-parole period to 36 years, a record at the time in that state. The earliest Einem could be released on parole was therefore on 31 October 2007 (after allowing for the fact that a third of the non-parole period could be taken off for good behaviour in prison). Einem's defence team (now consisting of barrister David Peek with assistance from Helena Jasinski) appealed the conviction to the Court of Criminal Appeal in South Australia and requested that a new trial be set. The basis for this appeal was the evidence given about Kelvin's heterosexuality, the references to Einem's own homosexuality through the trial and the negative impact that might have had on the jury, and also how Mr. Justice White in his summation did not include reference to the testimony given by Einem's relative about his attendance at the birthday party on the day Kelvin's body was dumped. The Court of Criminal of Appeal rejected the appeal, saying that the trial was conducted fairly and just throughout, however they did concede that Mr. Justice White should have included the evidence relating to the birthday party. = Additional murder charges = Einem was the leading suspect in the unsolved murders of four other young men between 1979 and 1982, and police continued to pursue leads on those cases in the years after his murder conviction. The four murdered were Alan Barnes in June 1979, Neil Muir in August 1979, Peter Stogneff in August 1981 and Mark Langley in February 1982. In February 1988, the State Coroner at the time in South Australia, Kevin Ahern, ordered an inquest into the deaths of these four young men, and on 24 March 1988, the State Coroner in his findings stated that manner and circumstances in which the four were murdered were very similar to that in the case of Kelvin, particularly the murders of Barnes and Langley. The reward for any information leading to an arrest for the murders was increased to $250,000, and this was later increased to $500,000 in September 1989 and then to $1,000,000 in March 2008. Following the inquest, police pushed on with their investigations and attempted to locate Einem's former associates to question them about the murders. During 1989 media interest in the four unsolved murders increased, with extensive news coverage in Adelaide about who was involved in the murders. The media dubbed those involved \\"The Family\\", an alleged group of homosexual child sexual abusers possibly involving high- profile Adelaide establishment figures (doctors, lawyers, judges and politicians), a theory that still persists to this day. Although the suspects do include several well-known members of the legal community, the brother of a well-known Olympian and other well-known members of the business community, police believe that the group does not include any high-profile people in Adelaide.$5m reward bid to solve Family murders The Advertiser 26 October 2008Shadowy clique preyed on the young AdelaideNow 1 April 2008Focus on three key suspects AdelaideNow 5 December 2010 However, fuel was added to the rumours of a conspiracy, when on 28 August 1989, Einem gave his one and only interview from prison, given to The Advertiser journalist Dick Wordley. In the interview, Einem again pleaded his innocence in the murder of Kelvin and of the four other young men, and regretted taking his lawyer's advice to keep silent during the early stages of the Kelvin investigation. He also hinted that he could name people that could help police with their investigation, but feared for his life if he did and also claimed that his life was already threatened once by two police officers who ordered him not to give evidence in the inquest into the death of Dr. George Duncan in 1972. Shortly after Einem's interview, police interviewed \\"Mr. B\\" again who was now living in Sydney. \\"B\\" gave a statement about the Barnes murder that convinced prosecutors to grant him immunity if Einem was brought to trial. Police, now with \\"B\\"'s statement and the similar fact evidence from the Kelvin case, then arrested Einem at Yatala Labour Prison on 15 September 1989 for the murder of Barnes. On 10 November 1989, Einem was also arrested for the murder of Langley. Police were never able to obtain enough evidence for charges in the murders of Muir and Stogneff. In the case of Muir an Adelaide doctor had been tried for his murder in 1980 but was found not guilty. The committal hearing to determine if Einem should stand trial for the murders of Barnes and Langley began on 5 March 1990 before magistrate David Gurry. Einem pleaded not guilty to both murders, and his defence counsel (now consisting of barrister Mark Griffin with assistance from Marie Shaw) immediately claimed that it would be an abuse of justice for their client if he was ordered to stand trial given the mass coverage of the murders in the media in the past year. The prosecution was led again by Brian Martin QC, who was assisted this time by Tom Birchall, and their case against Einem relied on evidence of the Kelvin murder, with the details of the crime being so strikingly similar to the murders of Barnes and Langley. The prosecution's case also relied on evidence given by former associates testifying to Einem picking up boys hitchhiking and sexually abusing them, as well as \\"Mr B\\"'s sensational evidence being in the company of Barnes and Einem at the time just before Barnes's murder. \\"B\\" also gave startling allegations of Einem being involved in the unexplained Beaumont children disappearance in 1966, as well as the disappearance of two girls at the Adelaide Oval in 1973. However, it turned out to be impossible to corroborate these allegations. Another witness also came forward to claim he had seen Einem and Barnes together drinking in the weeks before Barnes's death. Also entered as evidence were samples taken from Barnes's body which showed that sedative drugs had been present. Little evidence was presented for the murder of Langley, as prosecutors felt if they could prove that Einem had murdered Barnes, then it would naturally follow that he had murdered Langley as well. On 11 May 1990, Magistrate Gurry ordered Einem to stand trial for the two murders of Barnes and Langley. Einem's defence counsel appealed the decision, launching an abuse of process action in the Supreme Court of South Australia to achieve a permanent stay of proceedings, as well as stating that the huge media interest in the charges would result in their client not getting a fair trial. Proceedings began on 19 June 1990 before Justice Kevin Duggan, and six months later on 17 December 1990, Justice Duggan released his findings. He ordered Einem to stand trial, however he expressed concerns with most of the prosecution's evidence. The pre-trial hearing began on 19 December 1990 in the Supreme Court of South Australia, with Justice Duggan as the presiding judge. The prosecution decided after Justice Duggan's findings two days earlier to have Einem tried separately for the murders of Barnes and Langley. Justice Duggan ruled that the evidence relating to the Kelvin murder and from the various associates of Einem and hitchhikers was inadmissible, although he did rule that \\"B\\"'s evidence could be heard, but with the defence allowed to question the evidence as it was being given. This was a shattering blow for the prosecution's case, and on 21 December 1990, on advice from the Attorney- General of South Australia, prosecutors withdrew the charge for the murder of Langley. The prosecution tried to continue with the charge for the murder of Barnes, however with the problems of getting enough evidence admitted into court from associates about Einem picking up hitchhikers to convict Einem still too great, the final charge was withdrawn on 1 February 1991. The prosecution, on the advice of the Attorney-General, then entered a nolle prosequi for the Barnes murder charge.  Later events  = 2006 = On 29 January 2006, the Sunday Mail reported that Einem was currently being investigated for allegedly raping an inmate several times at Yatala Labour Prison. On 29 October 2006, The Australian reported that Einem had been selling hand-painted greeting cards to prison officers for $20 each. On 12 November 2006, the Sunday Mail reported that Einem was receiving preferential treatment from some prison officials at Yatala Labour Prison which included home cooked meals for him and the use of a mobile telephone. On 26 November 2006 it was revealed that Einem had been prescribed Cialis by a prison doctor in 2003. = 2007 = On 4 February 2007, the ABC reported that Einem had been charged over commercial dealings during his incarceration, including selling hand-painted greeting cards. On 14 June 2007, the ABC reported that Einem had been charged with producing and possessing child pornography, with police alleging that he had handwritten three fictitious stories describing sexual acts between a child and a man. His lawyer believed a handwriting analysis would clear Einem. On 27 July 2007 it was announced that Einem had been transferred from the maximum security B-Division of Yatala Labour Prison to Port Augusta Prison. On 11 August 2007, The Australian reported that detectives were calling for information to establish the identity of a young man seen in the Seven Network's news archive, showing police searching a storm water drain in the days after the Beaumont Children's disappearance. The man bore a striking resemblance to a youthful Einem. On 13 August 2007, the Seven Network followed this with a story that the man standing next to the Einem lookalike in their archived film matched the police sketch of the suspect seen with the Beaumonts at the beach on the day of their disappearance. On 1 November 2007, the ABC reported that after 24 years behind bars, Einem was now eligible to apply for parole. However, South Australian Premier Mike Rann had vowed to enforce new legislation to ensure Einem would never leave prison alive. On 7 December 2007, the ABC reported that Einem had been granted a further adjournment before answering charges of possessing child pornography. = 2008 = On 25 January 2008, The Advertiser reported that Einem would not answer charges of possessing child pornography for at least another two months. On 28 March 2008, the ABC reported that the child pornography found in Einem's cell had been determined not to have been written by him and that fingerprints did not match. Defence lawyer Sam Abbott said he expected the Director of Public Prosecutions to drop the most serious charge of producing the material and, if not, he would argue there was no case to answer. It was also announced that Einem had been excused from attending his court hearings so that he could avoid an \\"unpleasant\\" three-hour drive with other inmates. On 30 March 2008, it was announced that key suspects in Adelaide's notorious 'The Family' murders were being DNA tested as part of a new inquiry into the sex killings. Although Einem was the only member of 'The Family' who was convicted, police were now reviewing the cold case. On 13 April 2008, it was announced that police conducting fresh investigations into the unsolved Family murders would quiz transvestites who had information that could assist the inquiry. Some were former associates of Einem and were likely to provide valuable information into the inquiries. On 27 April 2008, it was announced that police were set to travel overseas to interview several key witnesses as part of their new investigations into the Family murders. On 4 May 2008, it was announced that an Adelaide chiropractor who fled Australia while being investigated for involvement in the Family Murders was now being sought in Europe by Police. He was a former associate of Einem. On 6 June 2008, it was announced that prosecutors had dropped one charge of producing child pornography; however Einem was still facing charges of possession. On 18 September 2008, it was announced that prosecutors have dropped allegations that Einem wrote stories of child pornography in his jail cell. On 28 October 2008, it was announced police hoped one of four suspects in the notorious Family sex murders would come forward to help solve the case after the State Government had doubled a reward to $1 million. This announcement came just days after Major Crime detectives interviewed Einem from his prison cell. = 2009 = On 27 May 2009, Einem pleaded guilty to possessing child pornography ‚Äì the first time he had ever confessed to a crime. On 24 June 2009, Einem was sentenced to a further 3 months for the possession of child pornography.

This semi-autobiographical work follows the life of Ferdinand Bardamu. Journey to the End of the Night is a semi-autobiographical novel. It tells the story of Bardamu and his doppelg√§nger Robinson in a grotesque journey through life, through the world and through death. Bardamu survives the First World War, wanders through the jungles of colonial Africa, lives in the unnatural world of industrial America, and heals the poor in a Parisian suburb, all the while constantly encountering Robinson.  Literary style  C√©line's first novel is remarkable for its style, making extensive use of ellipsis and hyperbole. His writing has the flow of natural speech patterns and uses the vernacular, while also employing more erudite elements. This has influenced French literature considerably. The novel enjoyed popular success and a fair amount of critical acclaim when it was published in October 1932. The critic Albert Thibaudet said in January 1933 that it was still a common topic of conversation at dinner parties in Paris.Henri Godard, \\"Notice\\", in C√©line, Romans, vol. 1 [Paris: Biblioth√®que de la Pl√©iade, 1981], p. 1262.  Influence and legacy  Among writers in English indebted to the novel was Will Self, who claimed that it, more than any other, inspired him to write fiction.

The tunnel The Townline Tunnel is a two- cell reinforced concrete tunnel with a rectangular cross-section. The roof is a post-tensioned concrete slab. The tunnel was built as a part of the Welland By-Pass project. Its construction was relatively easy since, like the Main Street Tunnel, it was being built at the same time as the channel above it and a simple cut and cover method could be used. The tunnel provides a sidewalk for pedestrians, two lanes for vehicular traffic, as well as room for three sets of tracks for rail vehicles. It was opened for automobiles on July 13, 1972, and the first train crossed the tunnel on January 31, 1973. The tunnel is 330 metres (1083 ft) long and 35 metres (115 ft) wide. The low grade required for trains makes necessary that each approach to the tunnel stretch be 4 km (2.5 miles). There was removed about 13,750,000 cubic meters (18,000,000 cubic yards) of material and construction of three viaducts on each side of the canal. As well, a solid earth plug had to be put into the Welland Recreational Waterway (the old alignment of the canal), cutting it in two (satellite photo). The construction cost was $40 million. The middle rail line was removed in the 1990s and the two remaining tracks now serve as the CPR Hamilton Subdivision and the CPR Brookfield Siding. Townline Tunnel is known locally as the \\"Stinky Tunnel\\" due to the strong odor of rotten eggs as one passes through it. The distinct smell of hydrogen sulfide that is sometimes present in the tunnel is created by dissolving layers of gypsum which are present in the bedrock of the area.  Issues with Flooding Control  Rain and snow falling on the approaches to the tunnel, as well as ground water flow, necessitate the operation of a pumping system to prevent flooding. Water is pumped via pipes located under the road and discharged into the canal. In February 1985, excessive runoff during a winter thaw caused flooding in the tunnel which closed the route to both rail and vehicular traffic. In late March, 2010, a routine inspection of the concrete pipes through which the water is pumped revealed erosion which threatened to cause a sinkhole within the road. The tunnel was closed to vehicular traffic to allow for repair. It re-opened April 22.

He was born at Ferrara, where he early distinguished himself by his talents and acquirements. On the completion of his literary course, he removed to Naples, where he lived on familiar terms with Jovianus Pontanus and Sannazaro; and subsequently to Lombardy, where he enjoyed the favour of the Mirandola family. At Milan in 1507 he studied Greek under Chalcondylas; and shortly afterwards, at Modena, he became tutor to Ercole (afterwards Cardinal) Rangone. About the year 1514, he removed to Rome, where, under Clement VII, he held the office of apostolic protonotary; but having in the sack of that city (1527), which almost coincided with the death of his patron Cardinal Rangone, lost all his property, he returned in poverty once more to Mirandola, whence again he was driven by the troubles consequent on the assassination of the reigning prince in 1533. The rest of his life was one long struggle with ill-health, poverty and neglect; and he is alluded to with sorrowful regret by Montaigne in one of his Essais (i.35), as having, like Sebastian Castalio, ended his days in utter destitution. He died at Ferrara in February 1552, and his epitaph makes touching and graceful allusion to the sadness of his end. Giraldi was a man of very extensive erudition; and numerous testimonies to his profundity and accuracy have been given both by contemporary and by later scholars. His Historia de deis gentium (1548) marked a distinctly forward step in the systematic study of classical mythology; and by his treatises De annis et mensibus, and on the Calendarium Romanum et Graecum, he contributed to bring about the reform of the calendar, which was ultimately effected by Pope Gregory XIII. His Progymnasma adversus literas et literatos deserves mention at least among the curiosities of literature; and among his other works to which reference is still occasionally made are Historiae po√´tarum Graecorum ac Latinorum; De po√´tis suorum temporum; and De sepultura ac vario sepeliendi ritu. Giraldi was also an elegant Latin poet. His Opera omnia was published at Leiden in 1696.

The author was assisted by Giovanni Vailati, Mario Pieri, Alessandro Padoa, Giovanni Vacca, Vincenzo Vivanti, Gino Fano and Cesare Burali-Forti. The Formulario was first published in 1895.

Kennedy (1980) Peano, Life and Works of Giuseppe Peano, Chapter 6: The Formulario Project, pages 44-50, Chapter 17: Completion of the Formulario, page 118-24, D. Reidel wrote \\"the development and use of mathematical logic is the guiding motif of the project\\". He also explains the variety of Peano's publication under the title: :the five editions of the Formulario [are not] editions in the usual sense of the word. Each is essentially a new elaboration, although much material is repeated. Moreover, the title and language varied: the first three, titled Formulaire de Math√©matiques, and the fourth, titled, Formulaire Math√©matique, were written in French, while Latino sine flexione, Peano's own invention, was used for the fifth edition, titled Formulario Mathematico. ... Ugo Cassina lists no less than twenty separately published items as being parts of the 'complete' Formulario! Peano believed that students needed only precise statement of their lessons. He wrote: :Each professor will be able to adopt this Formulario as a textbook, for it ought to contain all theorems and all methods. His teaching will be reduced to showing how to read the formulas, and to indicating to the students the theorems that he wishes to explain in his course. Such a dismissal of the oral tradition in lectures at universities was the undoing of Peano's own teaching career.

WOSU was licensed by the Federal Communications Commission as a daytime and nighttime radio station, operating with a non-directional power of 5 kW during the day, and dropping to 790 watts at night, to protect clear channel WBAP in Fort Worth, Texas. The license holder was The Ohio State University until the license changed hands over to St. Gabriel Radio Inc. It is now WVSG. History WOSU was the oldest radio station in Columbus. WOSU's origins trace back to 1920 when Ohio State University was granted an experimental license on April 20, 1920. On June 3, 1922, the station received the call letters WEAO (Willing Energetic Athletic Ohio). In 1933, the call letters were changed to WOSU. For much of the 1960s and '70s, WOSU's programming was mostly locally originating featuring diverse music programs from classical and jazz...and later to the seasonal Metropolitan Opera radio broadcasts on Saturday afternoons moderated by its long-time announcer Milton Cross and later by Peter Allen after Cross' passing leading to the gradual evolution of National Public Radio and its WOSU affiliation. WOSU also broadcast live remotes from the Ohio State Fair. By the turn of the millennium, WOSU primarily aired NPR news and talk programming, supplemented by programs from American Public Media and Public Radio International. It was also home to the Ohio State ice hockey and women's basketball broadcasts. On weekend evenings the station featured 12 hours of bluegrass music on a program called The Bluegrass Ramble hosted by a group of three rotating announcers. In addition to its sports and news coverage, the station also produced an award-winning talk show, Open Line with host Fred Andrle who retired in May 2009 after 25 years in radio. In September 2009 Andrle's program was replaced by \\"All Sides With Ann Fisher,\\" hosted by former Columbus Dispatch reporter and columnist Ann Fisher who came to WOSU with 20 years of journalism experience. The station broadcast from a single tower during the day, offering secondary coverage to almost half of Ohio‚Äìas far west as Dayton and the outer suburbs of Cincinnati and as far north as the outer suburbs of Toledo. At night, six towers were used in a directional pattern to protect WBAP AM, the clear air station, concentrating the signal around the Columbus area.  2010 FM format change  On July 1, 2010, Ohio State announced it was buying commercial station WWCD and moving WOSU-FM's longtime non-commercial classical music format from 89.7 FM to WWCD's frequency of 101.1 FM. As part of the transition, WOSU-FM dropped the remaining classical music from its schedule and began simulcasting its AM sister's NPR news/talk format. However, the FM station was now branded as the main station, under the moniker \\"89.7 FM NPR News.\\" WWCD's existing format moved to 102.5 FM, and WOSU converted its four FM repeaters into repeaters of the new classical outlet to serve areas outside of Columbus not well served by the new 101.1 frequency, which took the call letters WOSA. WOSU sold to St. Gabriel Radio According to its website, WOSU was purchased by St. Gabriel Radio Inc on September 21, 2011. Since 2007, St. Gabriel Radio has been airing Catholic programming on WVKO (1580 AM) via a lease agreement with owner Bernard, Ohio L.L.C. The transfer of the license and sale of the current WOSU to St. Gabriel Radio Inc. was approved by the FCC on November 7, 2011. WOSU's final broadcast day was on Friday December 9, 2011. At 5pm local time, NPR and local news broadcasts ended on WOSU, after which a continuous loop of announcements by WOSU and NPR staffers were aired asking listeners to switch over to WOSU-FM where its news and talk format would continue. The announcement loop continued to air until Wednesday December 14, 2011. At 9:00 am local time the last voice heard on WOSU was that of Mandie Trimble's repeated announcement asking listeners to switch to WOSU-FM. The beginning of the announcement \\"I'm Mandie Trimble W...\\" which at that point the carrier was shut down while she was repeating the WOSU callsign one last time. No formal announcement of farewell nor final goodbye to listeners was made prior to the final shutdown on WOSU. AM 820 was returned to the air on December 17, 2011 by its new owner, St. Gabriel Radio, Inc. 820 AM then changed its call letters to WVSG, which made its official debut on Tuesday, December 20 at 6pm. At that time, St. Gabriel ceased its broadcasts on WVKO. See also * WOSU-FM * WOSU-TV * WOSA * WVSG References 2\\\\.

Created by writer Robert Kanigher and artist Joe Kubert, the character first appeared in Flash Comics #88 (October 1947). Fictional character biography James Craddock is the son of an English gentleman who abandoned both Jim and his mother, forcing them into poverty. Craddock grew up to become a notorious highwayman and robber who terrorized England in the 19th century under the name \\"Gentleman Jim,\\" after a prophecy from a gypsy said he would be a highwayman. He encountered the ghosts of other highwaymen and Dick Turpin left him a horse. He journeyed to the United States and encounters the gunslingers Nighthawk and Cinnamon. The hot- headed Nighthawk lynched Craddock after wrongly assuming that he sexually assaulted Cinnamon, but Craddock somehow eludes death to rise again as a ghost. The Gentleman Ghost learns he must wander the earth until the spirit of his killer moves on to the next plane of existence. Unfortunately, Nighthawk and Cinnamon turn out to be the reincarnations of Ancient Egyptian royalty Prince Khufu and Chay-Ara: their souls (due to their exposure to the Thanagarian Nth metal) can never truly pass on. Both are eventually resurrected as Hawkman and Hawkgirl, and the Gentleman Ghost becomes their recurring nemesis during the 1940s. Craddock has over the decades menaced other heroes, including Batman, The Atom, The Flash, The New Teen Titans, Max Mercury and Stargirl, but the vengeful ghost always returns to his main foes, the Hawks, sometimes as a foe and sometimes as a friend. Gentleman Ghost has clashed with Batman and Superman on different occasions. In JSA Classified, issues 5-7, the Gentleman Ghost is a member of the Injustice Society. In Villains United #1, he joins the Secret Society of Super Villains. His origin is explored and altered in the pages of JSA #82-87 (2006). The natural son of an abusive father and a poor mother, young Jim Craddock soon slips into a life of crime, making contacts with the supernatural. After a gypsy prophesizes that he will be able to transcend death and return to life fighting and killing his enemies on English soil, his villainous career is put to an end when he is captured and sentenced to death by hanging after he is tricked by a woman he is trying to seduce who summons Redcoats. Returning as a ghost, he battles those on JSA, hoping for the prophecy to come true. The Ghost is briefly seen in the \\"Infinite Crisis\\" storyline, during the Secret Society of Supervillains' attack on Metropolis and its dozens of superpowered and human defenders. Afterwards, the Ghost becomes involved in a fight with Alan Scott, which leaves Scott in a coma. When the rightful time arrives, the Ghost gains the additional power of summoning vengeful ghosts from his enemies' (the JSA) past, like someone Scott killed with an electrical accident, although this is a fake, and other highwaymen. His plan is foiled by Stargirl, who, as a virgin girl, is impervious to ghostly attacks, an army of ghostly nobles who attack his army, and Wildcat, surprisingly a descendant of the Royal House of England, who decapitates him. Vanquished, he disappears. Gentleman Ghost is seen as one of the villains sent to retrieve the Get Out of Hell Free card from the Secret Six. =The New 52= In The New 52 (a 2011 reboot of the DC Comics universe), Gentleman Ghost is still a thief but no longer a ghost.Gotham By Midnight Annual #1 In his first appearance, he steals the Mortis Orb, which has the power to resurrect the dead.Savage Hawkman #5 Hawkman deduces that Gentleman Ghost is Jim Craddock and Gentleman Ghost confirms it. Gentleman Ghost tells Hawkman he invited him here because the Nth metal drew him to the Mortis Orb. Then, he tells Hawkman he will take him to the orb, but Hawkman refuses, so Gentleman Ghost sends more apparitions after him, Hawkman escapes the building. Then, Gentleman Ghost appears again, saying that the warlock's spell rendered the orb inert years ago, but the Nth Metal broke the spell causing the orb to regain its power. Gentleman Ghost takes the orb, saying that he will use it to transcend death and resurrect himself through the life-force of every man, woman, and child nearby. Then, he disappears and the Zombies attacking Hawkman fall apart.Savage Hawkman #6 Gentleman Ghost begins fully harnessing the orb‚Äôs power, creating a portal from which Julius Gates comes out. Gates (demanding the orb) grabs Craddock, while Hawkman takes the orb from him. The portal vanishes with Craddock and Gates inside causing them both to disappear along with the apparitions and zombies. Hawkman drops the Mortis Orb somewhere in Antarctica to keep it from falling into the wrong hands again.Savage Hawkman #7 Sometime later, Craddock took up residence in a New Hampshire called Duskhaven which he operated out of while he robbed wealthy socialites of Gotham. When the Midnight Shift apprehended him, he revealed his new origins. Some time in the past, Craddock had been a philanderer and drew the ire of a witch, who cursed him, granting his abilities but forcing him to commit criminal acts. He believed the curse would be lifted once the witch died, but it was not, and he found himself to be immortal. Powers and abilities Gentleman Ghost in the Injustice Society. Art by Joe Bennett. Originally, the Gentleman Ghost seemed to rely on devices to simulate a ghostly existence; the original 1940s stories left the question of his nature open to speculation. Later, however, he is retconned into a true ghost and his abilities altered to follow suit. As a ghost, Craddock has several abilities. He can become intangible and pass effortlessly through solid material. He can become completely invisible. In fact, the appearance of his head as a floating hat and monocle is actually him rendering his decayed face invisible. He has been shown as being able to teleport as short a distance as a few rooms or as far as across states. Gentleman Ghost can also summon spectral weapons including a cane that shoots spectral fire, and flintlock pistols. When passing through Craddock's ghostly form, people will sometimes experience an intense feeling of cold. Since this does not happen every time, it would seem that he can control this effect. Craddock can apparently track psionic energy and travel across dimensions as he did when he followed an astral tether from the Wizard to Johnny Sorrow. On certain occasions most of the manifestations of his abilities like teleportation and phasing are accompanied by a purple glow of spectral energy or transparent mist (possibly courtesy of different pencilers). Around the time of his prophesied return to life, he gains the power to summon and control the spirits of the dead due to his mother's spirit spending centuries recruiting them to help her son. It is unknown if he can still call upon them. The Gentleman Ghost is apparently unable to touch or be touched by virgins. This is confirmed by his inability to do harm to both Stargirl and Jakeem Thunder. However, he can pick up a real weapon and be able to hurt them, as when he brandished the Cosmic Rod. As a supernatural being, Gentleman Ghost cannot be killed and is very hard to hurt. However, those with royal blood can physically harm him and, when unaware, energy hitting him causes pain. In other media =Television= * Gentleman Ghost appears in The All-New Super Friends Hour, voiced by an uncredited Alan Oppenheimer. This version is referred to only as \\"Gentleman Jim Craddock\\" instead of \\"Gentleman Ghost\\". In the episode \\"Ghost\\", a man casts a spell to bring Gentleman Ghost to the living so that he can take revenge on Superman and Wonder Woman for imprisoning his spirit. He uses his powers to turn U.N. representatives into ghosts and later turns Superman and Wonder Woman into ghosts. The curse is eventually broken, after which the Super Friends used the mystical Rods of Merlin to send Gentleman Ghost back to his grave, never to return again. * Gentleman Ghost was briefly considered to be featured in The New Batman Adventures. When asked about his potential use in the show, producer and writer Paul Dini stated Gentleman Ghost's appearance would be \\"likely, if we do more contemporary Batman stories\\". Ultimately, Gentleman Ghost never appeared in the series. * Gentleman Ghost appears in Justice League Unlimited, voiced by Robin Atkin Downes. In \\"I Am Legion\\", he is seen as a member of Gorilla Grodd's Secret Society. In the episode \\"Ancient History\\", he is shown trying to outrun the Green Lantern until Hawkman catches him with a net made from Nth metal. * Gentleman Ghost appears in several episodes of the animated series Batman: The Brave and the Bold, voiced by Greg Ellis. In this version, \\"Gentleman\\" Jim Craddock was an infamous highwayman in 19th-century London who tried to obtain immortality by offering 10 souls to the demon Asteroth in exchange, but he was stopped by the combined efforts of Sherlock Holmes, the demon Etrigan and a time-displaced Batman. After being hung for his crimes, Craddock rose as Gentleman Ghost, swearing revenge on Batman (the demon stated that only \\"his soul\\" would not leave the earthly plane). Centuries later, he sought revenge by trying to kill Batman in several ways, although Batman could defend himself with Nth metal. =Film= * Gentleman Ghost appears in The Lego Batman Movie. He is among the villains that assist the Joker in his attacks on Gotham City. * Gentleman Ghost appears in the direct-to-video film Teen Titans Go! vs. Teen Titans, voiced by \\"Weird Al\\" Yankovic. =Video games= * Gentleman Ghost also appears as a villain in Batman: The Brave and the Bold ‚Äì The Videogame, voiced again by Greg Ellis. Gentleman Ghost hires the Clock King to lure Batman to London, England, and later lures him and Hawkman into the underworld, in order to offer them to Astaroth as a sacrifice in exchange for his life back. When that fails, a vengeful Craddock attempts to bury them under, and later fights them in a graveyard. After being humiliated, Hawkman teaches Batman to have respect even for his enemies, and picks up the villain respectfully to take him to jail. * Gentleman Ghost also appears in DC Universe Online, voiced by Jason Brenizer. * Gentleman Ghost appears as a playable character in Lego DC Super-Villains.

It aired on CBeebies (both the separate channel and CBeebies on BBC One and BBC Two). The show first aired on 27 September 2004, and won the Best Pre School Live Action award, at the BAFTA Children's Awards in 2005. Every programme is 15 minutes long, and teaches children a dance (to a short original soundtrack), a different one every week. It was originally presented by Nataylia \\"Nat\\" Roni and Pete Hillier. Nataylia had previously played the role of 'Nala' in the West End with Disney in The Lion King. However, from November 2006, it was presented by Pete alone along with a new group of children called 'The Boogie Bunch' who could be the co presenters since Nat was absent. In the same series, Pete was given a nickname, 'Boogie Pete'. It also features clips of children (at home, in schools or in front of bluescreen). In earlier series, the same programme was shown throughout the week. In the later series, a slightly different programme was shown daily. The only variant being, the verses of the soundtrack are taught, and the chorus is only run through once. The dance is taught segment by segment by the presenters. In earlier programmes, the two presenters took turns with every segment. The moves to every day's dance, as well as the theme of the soundtrack, are drawn from either nature or the world around us (such as \\"The Ocean Motion\\", featuring dance moves inspired by various sea creatures). Every time, the program culminates with a full performance of the soundtrack and dance, known as \\"The Big Video\\", in which the presenters call \\"Big Video Time\\". In Series 1, one presenter would be on a green screen set of yellow and green polka dots, and the other presenter would go somewhere wherever fits the song, for example, Pete might go to a construction site for the Dig It song. Or Nat could go to a flower garden for the Gardening song. However, in Series 2, Pete would usually stand in front of a green screen to the place, rather than going there. And the Boogie Bunch will too for a short dance tutorial. And he would also stand in front of the typical green and yellow polka dot set, but in this season, they move into the opposite colours and that repeats. In Series 1, Nat would wear a pink sleeveless jacket, and Pete would wear a green t-shirt with yellow stripes and neck. In Series 2, Pete's outfit varies, between a red t-shirt with a yellow fire symbol, and a green t-shirt with a yellow firework symbol. The name of the programme comes from the informal verb to dance (boogie) and the Beebies suffix of CBeebies. The program was advertised using a child dancing \\"Travolta style\\" to A Fifth of Beethoven by Walter Murphy. In 2020, it was revealed that the series would be making a comeback to CBeebies, with Oti Mabuse hosting. Episodes  Series 1 Presented by Nataylia \\"Nat\\" Roni and Pete Hillier * 1. Dig It * 2.

Traditionally, it is considered to cover roughly four hundred years, spanning the ministry of Malachi (c. 420 BC) to the appearance of John the Baptist in the early 1st century AD, almost the same period as the Second Temple period (530 BC to 70 AD). It is known by some members of the Protestant community as the \\"400 Silent Years\\" because some maintain that it was a span where God revealed nothing new to his people.

Life and work Mueller was born in Liebau (now Lubawka, Kamienna G√≥ra County), Kreis Landeshut, Silesia. Between 1890 and 1892 he was trained in lithography in G√∂rlitz and Breslau. From 1894 to 1896 he studied at the Academy of Fine Arts in Dresden and continued his study in Munich during 1898. He left Munich's academy after Franz von Stuck classified him as untalented. His early works are influenced by impressionism, Jugendstil and Symbolism. When he settled to Berlin in 1908, his style became more expressionist. During this time there were meetings with Wilhelm Lehmbruck, Rainer Maria Rilke and Erich Heckel. In 1910, he joined 'Die Br√ºcke', a Dresden-based group of Expressionist artists. He was member of the group until it disbanded in 1913 due to artistic differences. At the same time Mueller also had contact with the artists group 'Der Blaue Reiter'. During World War I he fought as a German soldier in France and Russia. After the war he became a professor at the academy of arts (Akademie der Bildenden Kunste) in Breslau where he taught until his death on 24 September 1930. Johnny Friedlaender and Isidor Ascheim were among his pupils there. In 1937 the Nazis seized 357 of his works from German museums, since the pictures were considered to be degenerate art.Wolf 2006, p. 76 Mueller was one of the most lyrical of German expressionist painters. The main topic of Mueller's works is the unity of humans and nature; his paintings emphasize a harmonious simplification of form, colour and contours. He is known especially for his characteristic paintings of nudes and Romani women; his nickname was \\"Gypsy Mueller\\" and his mother was perhaps Romani. The medium he preferred for his paintings was distemper on coarse canvas, which produced a mat surface.Wolf 2006, p. 76; Moeller 2001, p. 77 Altogether his printmaking amounted to 172 prints, nearly all of them lithographs, but including a few woodcuts and etchings.

This is a common species with a wide distribution which faces no obvious threats, so the International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated its conservation status as being of \\"least concern\\". Description The Balochistan gerbil is a medium-sized, slender species that somewhat resembles Wagner's gerbil (Dipodillus dasyurus). Its head-and-body length is between and its tail is between . The upper parts are yellowish- brown, tinged with grey; this is because the individual hairs have grey bases. The flanks are less grey. The underparts and inside of the limbs are white, and there is a sharp line delineating the boundary between upper and lower parts. There are separate white patches above the eye and behind the ear, and a large white patch on the rump. The upper side of the tail is yellowish-brown near the base becoming greyer near the tip. The underside is white and the tip of the tail bears a boss of longer hairs, which are variable in colour, but usually grey. Distribution and habitat The Balochistan gerbil has a very wide distribution across northern Africa, the Arabian peninsula and western Asia. Its range includes the northwestern region of Africa to the north of the Sahara, from Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia, and the Sahel to the south of the desert, from Mauritania to Mali, Niger and Chad. A separate population is present in the Arabian Peninsula, the Middle East, Afghanistan, Pakistan and northwestern India. The typical habitat of this gerbil is desert and semi- desert where it mostly occupies better vegetated locations such as wadi's, oases and sand-clay basins and plains with relatively deep soils.

Biography He was born in Concord, Massachusetts, the son of Hersey Bradford Goodwin and Lucrettia Watson. He graduated at Harvard in 1851, studied at Bonn, Berlin, and G√∂ttingen, receiving a Ph.D. from the latter institution in 1855. He was tutor in Greek at Harvard from 1856 to 1860, and Eliot professor of Greek there from 1860 until his resignation in 1901. He became an overseer of Harvard in 1903. In 1882‚Äì1883 Goodwin was the first director of the American School of Classical Studies at Athens. He was president of the American Philological Association in 1872 and again in 1885. He was also a member of the Imperial Archaeological Institute of Germany, of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and of the Massachusetts Historical Society, and was a knight of the Greek Order of the Saviour. He was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1893.American Antiquarian Society Members Directory Goodwin edited the Panegyricus of Isocrates (1864) and Demosthenes' On The Crown (1901); and assisted in preparing the seventh edition of Liddell and Scott's Greek-English Lexicon. He revised an English version by several writers of Plutarch's Morals (5 vols, 1871; 6th ed., 1889), and published the Greek text with literal English version of Aeschylus' Agamemnon (1906) for the Harvard production of that play in June 1906. As a teacher he did much to raise the tone of classical reading from that of a mechanical exercise to literary study. But his most important work was his Syntax of the Moods and Tenses of the Greek Verb (1860), of which the seventh revised edition appeared in 1877 and another (enlarged) in 1890. This was \\"based in part on Madvig and Kr√ºger,\\" but, besides making accessible to American students the works of these continental grammarians, it presented original matter, including a \\"radical innovation in the classification of conditional sentences,\\" notably the \\"distinction between particular and general suppositions.\\" Goodwin's Greek Grammar (elementary edition, 1870;.enlarged 1879; revised and enlarged 1892) gradually superseded in most American schools the Grammar of Hadley and Allen. Both the Moods and Tenses and the Grammar in later editions are largely dependent on the theories of Gildersleeve for additions and changes. Goodwin also wrote a few elaborate syntactical studies, to be found in Harvard Studies in Classical Philology, the twelfth volume of which was dedicated to him upon the completion of fifty years as an alumnus of Harvard and forty-one years as Eliot professor.

Moreover, Walter Butler was Villepin's schoolmate and friend from l'ENA, the elite public servants school. Following hard negotiations and a strike by the CGT trade- union and the Corsican Workers' Trade Union (STC), a new project was presented. In May 2006, the company was privatized. Connex (which has since become Veolia Transport, a subsidiary of Veolia Environment group) took 28% of the SNCM (against 38% for Butler in the previous arrangement); the state kept 25% of the shares, and 9% sold to the employees. 400 layoffs were planned; in addition to the 113 million euros reinjected by the state before the privatization, 35 million euros were to be given to finance the layoffs. In 2008, Butler sold its shares to Veolia, who became the main shareholder with 66% of shares.SNCM: Veolia r√©cup√®re de nouvelles parts , Retrieved 11 September 2014 In 2011, the shares were passed on to Veolia Transdev (now simply Transdev), after Veolia merged with Transdev (historic). The company filed for bankruptcy protection in 2014 and was subsequently placed in receivership of the court of Marseilles.

In petrology, limburgite is a dark-colored volcanic rock resembling basalt in appearance, but containing normally no feldspar. The name derives from the type locality the Limberg or the Limburg, close to Sasbach am Kaiserstuhl in Baden-W√ºrttemberg, where they occur in the well-known rock of the Kaiserstuhl. They consist essentially of olivine and augite with a brownish glassy groundmass. The augite may be green, but more commonly is brown or violet; the olivine is usually pale green or colourless, but is sometimes yellow. Within the groundmass a second generation of small euhedral augites frequently occurs; more rarely olivine is present also as an ingredient of the matrix. The principal accessory minerals are ilmenite and apatite. Feldspar though sometimes present, is never abundant, and nepheline also is unusual. In some limburgites large phenocrysts of dark brown hornblende and biotite are found, mostly with irregular borders blackened by resorption; in others there are large crystals of anorthoclase. Hauyne is an ingredient of some of the limburgites of the Cape Verde Islands.- Rocks of this group occur in considerable numbers in Germany (Rhine district) and in Bohemia, also in Scotland, Auvergne, Spain, Africa (Kilimanjaro) and Brazil. They are associated principally with basalts, nepheline and leucite basalts and monchiquites. From the last-named rocks the limburgites are not easily separated as the two classes bear a very close resemblance in structure and in mineral composition, though many authorities believe that the ground mass of the monchiquites is not a glass but crystalline analcite. Limburgites may occur as flows, as sills or dykes, and are sometimes highly vesicular. Closely allied to them are the augitites, which are distinguished only by the absence of olivine; examples are known from Bohemia, Auvergne, the Canary Islands and Ireland.

A lestovka; the lapostki are decorated with little beads Sketch of a lestovka made by a Russian ethnographer. Form and symbolism Lestovka with the image of the cross of Calvary The Lestovka is traditionally constructed of leather, with \\"steps\\" made by looping leather around small twigs sections on which paper scrolls with Jesus prayer are wound. It has a total of 109 \\"steps\\" ‚Äì small loops or knots, unevenly grouped: 3/12/38/33/17/3 steps. Traditionally, Lestovki are made from genuine leather, but poorer people make Lestovki from fabric or other materials. At the bottom of the lestovka hang four lapostki, which are flaps, usually triangular, but such variations as bell or oak-leaf shapes are not uncommon. These represent the four Gospels, and sometimes have icons, crosses, religious symbols or scripture verses printed or stitched on them, the stitching around these leaves symbolising the teaching of the Gospels. Simpler lestovkas will have the lapostki covered with silk brocade or velvet, and this is a traditional way of reusing church fabrics, either of vestments that have become too worn out for clergy to wear, or of altar- coverings and similar fabrics. Near these lapostki are seven small movable pieces. They are called peredvizki. Some masters make them in the form of 7 crosses or beads. These seven pieces represent the seven Mysteries (Sacraments) of the Church, their location near the leaves of the lapostki indicating their origin in and central relation to the Gospels. In the Old Believer tradition, seven small moving parts are made invisible. But especially skilled craftsmen make them with an elevator system - they can be extended and then put back in place. Next, the main loop will have three large steps on either side where it joins the lapostki (in lestovkas that are joined together), and on the Lestovka itself are three more large steps, giving a total of nine, representing the nine months in which Christ was in the womb of the Theotokos (Blessed Virgin Mary), and also for the nine choirs of angels. After the three large steps on either side is a space, representing the heavens and the earth. Coming to the main set of counters, one finds twelve small babochki (rungs, steps), signifying the Twelve Apostles. Then are thirty-eight small counters, representing the thirty-six weeks and two days during which the Theotokos carried Christ in her womb. Next, thirty-three small counters for the number of years Christ lived on earth, followed by seventeen small counters for the seventeen Old Testament prophets plus St John the Baptist who prophesied about the coming of Christ. Usage If one is unable to attend services in church for whatever reasons, it is considered commendable to pray on the lestovka, using a number of repetitions of the Jesus prayer combined with specific bows and prostrations. When using the lestovka as part of a rule of prayer, the three counters at either end are used for the following prayers (accompanied by bows) at the end and beginning of the prayer session: :–ë–æ–∂–µ, –º–∏–ª–æ—Å—Ç–∏–≤—ä –±—π–¥–∏ –º–Ω–µ –≥—Ä—£—à–Ω–æ–º—π. (–≥—Ä—£—à–Ω—£–π if one is female) :–°–æ–∑–¥–∞–≤–∏ –º—ß, –ì–æ—Å–ø–æ–¥–∏, –ø–æ–º–∏–ª—π–π –º—ß. :–ë–µ–∑—ä —á–∏—Å–ª–∞ —Å–æ–≥—Ä—£—à–∏—Ö—ä, –ì–æ—Å–ø–æ–¥–∏, –ø—Ä–æ—Å—Ç–∏ –º—ß. ::God be merciful to me a sinner. (bow) ::Thou hast created me; Lord, have mercy on me. (bow) ::I have sinned immeasurably; Lord, forgive me. (bow) :Some say, at the last line, \\"–ø–æ–º–∏–ª—π–π –∏ –ø—Ä–æ—Å—Ç–∏ –º—ß –≥—Ä—£—à–Ω–∞–≥–æ/–≥—Ä—£—à–Ω—π—é\\" (have mercy and forgive me a sinner) instead of \\"–ø—Ä–æ—Å—Ç–∏ –º—ß\\" (forgive me). The remaining one hundred small counters are used for the repetition of the Jesus prayer, with bows and prostrations. Other uses of the lestovka include counting the twelve or forty repetitions of Lord have mercy used as responses at the Divine Liturgy and Canonical hours. The seventeen counters are also used to count the number of bows during the Prayer of Saint Ephrem. Lestovka with 150 steps is used to read prayers to the Virgin Mary. Outside of Old Belief Prayers that write on scrolls inside Lestovka Lestovka is often found outside communities that adhere to the liturgical practices of the Old Believers. Eastern Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Christians who are knowledgeable about Slavic traditions of the Byzantine rite love to own and use them. Members of the Russian Orthodox Church today are increasingly using Lestovka. Examples of Russian Orthodox saints depicted with a staircase are St Seraphim of Sarov, , , Sergius of Radonezh, Kiev Pechersk Saints and many other saints of the Russian Orthodox Church.

Detroit labor activist Martin Glaberman estimated at the time that the Hamtramck plant was 70 per cent black while the union local (UAW Local 3), the plant management and lower supervision, and the Hamtramck city administration was dominated by older Polish-American workers. DRUM sought to organize black workers to obtain concessions not only from the Chrysler management, but also from the United Auto Workers. Walter Reuther and the senior leadership had been early supporters of the American Civil Rights Movement; yet in spite of their growing presence in the auto-industry African- Americans rarely rose to positions of leadership within the union. On July 8, 1968 DRUM led a wildcat strike against conditions in the Hamtramck plant. The strike was observed by some 4,000 workers, lasted 2.5 days and prevented the production of 3,000 cars. In the subsequent Local 3 election, DRUM ran as an alternative slate. Although it did not win, the new organization drew notice for its militancy and willingness to challenge the UAW hierarchy. The \\"Revolutionary Union Movement\\" form of organization spread to other Detroit plants: including FRUM (Ford Revolutionary Union Movement) at the Ford River Rouge Plant, and ELRUM (Eldon Avenue Revolutionary Union Movement) at the Chrysler Eldon Avenue plant. These organizations were brought together in the League of Revolutionary Black Workers which formed in June 1969. As it grew, DRUM faced a crisis of expectations. Auto workers had created an independent organization, but opinions differed about DRUM's future mission. Debates concerned whether DRUM should continue as a reform movement within the UAW or a dual-union which would seek to replace the UAW. The League of Revolutionary Black Workers eventually split between those who wanted to remain focused on the auto industry and those who wished to expand the League into a national political organization. The nationally oriented movement, led by General Baker, retained the organizational name the League and DRUM and was associated with the New Communist Movement. By 1975, however, the plant-level organization was largely defunct. Many members had been fired, and those who stayed often joined other currents in the union reform movement, such as the United National Caucus.

He directed the construction of the Fr√©jus Rail Tunnel between France and Italy, also known as the Mont Cenis Tunnel. This was the first of a series of major tunnels built in the late 19th century to connect northern and southern Europe through the Alps. Sommeiller pioneered the use of pneumatic drilling and dynamite to achieve record-breaking excavation speeds. This 12.8-km tunnel was completed on December 26, 1870, 11 years ahead of schedule. It remained the longest tunnel in the world until the opening of the Gotthard Rail Tunnel in 1882. Life Germain Sommeiller was born in Saint-Jeoire (now part of Haute-Savoie, France) on February 15, 1815. He graduated in civil engineering at the University of Turin in 1841. He became a Royal Civil Engineer in the Public Transport Department of Savoy in 1845. From 1846 to 1850 he worked for the Cockerill steel company in Li√®ge, which helped build the Belgian rail network. He met his future partner Sebastiano Grandis there. He then returned to Savoy as assistant to the Belgian engineer Henri Maus, who directed construction of the Turin-Genoa railway. He was noticed for outstanding technical skills, so when king Vittorio Emanuele II decided to build the Mont Cenis Tunnel between Bardonecchia and Modane in 1857, Sommeiller was appointed head of design and construction. His collaborators were the Italian engineers Sebastiano Grandis and Severino Grattoni. He patented the pneumatic rock-drilling machine, used in the tunnelling works, based on the invention of Giovanni Battista Piatti. Politics In 1860, when Savoy was annexed to France, he chose to become an Italian citizen and was subsequently elected as deputy in the first Italian Parliament. Death Germain Sommeiller died in his native town of Saint-Jeoire on July 11, 1871. Pointe Sommeiller, a 3332-meter-high peak in the Cottian Alps, and Col Sommeiller, the nearby mountain pass linking Bramans, France to Bardonecchia, Italy, were named in his honour. Several streets in Savoy cities such as Annecy also bear Sommeiller's name.

Christophe Antoine Gerle (1736 c. 1801), French revolutionist and mystic, was born at Riom in Auvergne. Entering the Carthusian order early in life, he became prior of Laval-Dieu in Perche, and afterwards of Pont-Sainte- Marie at Moulins. Elected deputy to the states-general in 1789, Gerle became very popular, and though he had no seat in the assembly until after the Tennis Court Oath, being only deputy suppl√©ant, he is represented in Jacques-Louis David's classic painting as taking part in it. In 1792 he was chosen elector of Paris. In the revolutionary turmoil Gerle developed a strong vein of mysticism, mingled with ideas of reform, and in June 1790 the prophetic powers of Suzanne Labrousse (1747‚Äì1821), a visionary who had predicted the Revolution ten years before, were brought by him to the notice of the Convention. In Paris, where he lived first with a spiritualistic doctor and afterwards, like Robespierre, at the house of a cabinet-maker, his mystical tendencies were strengthened. The insane ideas of Catherine Th√©ot--a convent servant turned prophetess--who proclaimed herself the Virgin, the \\"Mother of God\\" and the \\"new Eve,\\" were eminently attractive to Gerle; in the person of Robespierre he recognized the Messiah, and at the meetings of the Th√©otists he officiated with the aged prophetess as co-president. But the activities of Catherine and her adepts were short-lived. The Th√©otists' cult of Robespierre was a weapon in the hands of his opponents; and shortly after the festival of the Supreme Being, Vadier made a report to the Convention calling for the prosecution of Catherine, Gerle and others as fanatics and conspirators. They were arrested, thrown into prison and, in the confusion of Robespierre's fall, apparently forgotten. Catherine died in prison, but Gerle, released by the Directory, became one of the editors of the Messager du soir, and was afterwards in the office of Pierre B√©n√©zech (1775‚Äì1802), minister of the interior. Having renounced his monastic vows in Paris, he is thought to have married, towards the close of his life, Christine Raffet, aunt of the artist Denis Raffet. The date of his death is uncertain.

Her case became notable because it was one of the first trials to be followed by the public through daily newspaper reports, and because she was the first person convicted largely on direct forensic toxicological evidence. However, questions about her guilt had divided French society to the extent that it is often compared to the better-known Dreyfus affair. Early life Marie Lafarge was born in Paris in 1816, the daughter of an artillery officer. She is said to be a descendant of Louis XIII of France through her grandmother, Hermine, Baroness Collard, from a liaison between St√©phanie F√©licit√©, comtesse de Genlis and Louis Philippe II, Duke of Orl√©ans. Marie lost her father to a hunting accident at the age of twelve; her mother, who remarried soon after, died seven years later. At eighteen, Marie was adopted by her maternal aunt, who was married to the secretary-general of the Bank of France. The two women did not get along. Despite the fact that her foster parents treated her well and sent her to the best schools, Marie was kept aware of her status as a poor relative. Because she attended an elite school, Marie interacted with daughters of the moneyed aristocracy. She used every means to persuade them that she too came from a wealthy family, and she became envious when she saw her friends marrying rich noblemen. However, Marie had little say in the matter of matrimony. Her marriage dowry of 90,000 francs, while considerable, was not that impressive considering her family's status, and Marie was left with feelings of inadequacy, which fueled her pride and ambition. As Marie remained unmarried when she turned 23, one of her uncles took responsibility for finding her a husband. Unbeknownst to Marie, he engaged the services of a marriage broker. This produced just one candidate who fit the advice of her father that \\"no marriage contract should be made with a man whose only income is his salary as a subprefect.\\" Charles Lafarge Charles Pouch-Lafarge was a big, coarse man of twenty-eight, a son of Jean-Baptiste Lafarge, justice of the peace in Vigeois. In 1817, his father bought the former charterhouse, or Carthusian monastery, in the hamlet of Le Glandier in Corr√®ze, run by Carthusian monks since the 13th century, but fallen into disrepair after its suppression in the French Revolution. In an effort to make it profitable, Charles turned part of the estate into a foundry, a venture that plunged him into debt. In 1839, bankrupt, he saw a good marriage as the only way to pay his creditors. He engaged the same marriage broker who was hired to find a husband for Marie. Charles advertised himself as a wealthy iron master with property worth more than 200,000 francs with an annual income of 30,000 from the foundry alone. He also carried letters of recommendation from his priest and local deputy. To hide the fact that a marriage broker was involved in this, Marie's uncle passed off Charles as a friend and arranged a fortuitous meeting with Marie at the opera. Marie found Charles common and repulsive, but since he advertised himself as the owner of a palatial estate, she agreed to marry him. Thus, four days after the meeting, her aunt announced their engagement, and they were married on 10 August 1839. The couple then left Paris for Le Glandier to live at the estate. Disillusionment As it could be expected, when they arrived on 13 August, Marie was disillusioned. The house, contained within the ruins of a former monastery, was in disrepair, damp and rat-infested. Her in-laws were peasants who disgusted her and regarded her with deep distrust. Instead of the wealth she expected, she was faced with considerable debt. In her despondency, she locked herself in her room the first night and wrote a letter to her husband, imploring him to release her from their marriage, while threatening to take her life with arsenic. Lafarge, whose affairs were desperate, agreed to make concessions except to release her from the marriage. He promised not to assert his marital privileges until he restored the estate to its original condition. She appeared to calm down, and their relationship appeared to have improved in the ensuing weeks. Despite her situation, Marie wrote letters to her school friends pretending that she was having a happy domestic life. She also tried to help her husband by writing letters of recommendation for Charles to Paris, where he hoped to raise money. Before he left on a business trip, in December 1839, she made a will bequeathing to her husband her entire inheritance, with the proviso that he would do the same for her. This he did, but without her knowledge, he made another will soon after, leaving the Le Glandier property to his mother instead. Parisian illness While Charles was in Paris, Marie wrote to him passionate love letters and sent him her picture, as well as a Christmas cake in the spirit of the season. He ate a piece of it and suddenly became violently ill soon after. As cholera-like symptoms were common in those days, he did not think about consulting with a physician, but threw the cake away, thinking that it became spoiled in transit. When he returned to Le Glandier, having raised some money, he still felt ill. Marie put him to bed and fed him venison and truffles. Almost immediately, Charles was again afflicted with la maladie parisienne. The family physician, Dr. Bardon, agreed with its cholera-like symptoms and was not suspicious when Marie asked him for a prescription for arsenic, in order to kill the rats that disturbed her husband during the evening. The next day, Charles experienced leg cramps, dehydration and nausea. He was so ill that his relatives kept watch on him at all times, including a young cousin named Emma Pontier and a young woman who stayed with them by the name of Anna Brun. Marie treated him with various medicaments, especially gum arabic, which, according to her, always did her good, and which she always kept a ready supply of in her small malachite box, but to no avail. Charles deteriorated so rapidly that another physician, Dr. Mass√©nat, was called in for consultation. He also diagnosed cholera and prescribed eggnog to strengthen him. Anna Brun noticed Marie taking white powder from her malachite box and stirring it into the eggnog. When asked, Marie said it was \\"orange-blossom sugar\\". But Anna's suspicions were aroused when she noticed a few white flakes floating on the surface of the eggnog after the patient took a few sips. She showed the glass to Dr. Mass√©nat; he tasted the eggnog and experienced a burning sensation, but attributed the flakes to some ceiling plaster that may have fallen in the glass. Anna was not convinced; she put the rest of the eggnog in a cupboard and kept a close eye on Marie. She saw Marie stir more white powder into some soup for Charles. Again, Charles felt violently ill after a few sips. Anna took the cup of soup away and mustered enough courage to tell Charles's relatives of her suspicions. Suspicions of murder On 12 January 1840, while the family gathered in the sickroom fearing the worst, Emma Pontier, who had such high regard for Marie, told her of Anna Brun's suspicions. Charles's mother implored him not to take another morsel of food from his wife. Further panic ensued when it was learned that Lafarge's servant and gardener had bought arsenic for Marie, \\"for the rats\\". Marie admitted this, but she made the gardener confirm that she gave him the arsenic to make rat-poison paste out of it. Their fears were momentarily allayed, but the next day, white residue was found at the bottom of a glass of sugar water that Marie had administered to Charles. A third doctor, Ren√© de Lespinasse, was called on 13 January. He suspected poison, but by then it was too late: Charles died a few hours afterwards. Already, suspicions ran high that Marie had indeed poisoned her husband, but Marie seemed unfazed. While word went about regarding this, Marie went to her notary with the will, not knowing that it was invalid. Only Emma Pontier would go near her and, already torn by doubts, told Marie that Lafarge's brother-in-law was going to the police at Brive. Then the young girl took possession of Marie's malachite box. The justice of the peace from Brive, Moran, arrived at Le Glandier on 15 January. Impressed by Marie, he listened with uncertainty to the family's accusations but took possession of the soup, the sugar water and the eggnog that Anna Brun had put aside. Then the gardener revealed that Marie had given him arsenic with which to make rat-poison paste in December as well as January. Strangely, the paste could be found all over the house, untouched by the rats. Moran had the paste collected, his suspicions aroused. He questioned the apothecary who sold the arsenic to Marie. She had bought arsenic \\"for the rats\\" just before she sent the cake to Paris and again the day after Lafarge's return. Moran asked Lafarge's doctors to perform a post-mortem examination on Lafarge. He had also learned of a new test for the presence of arsenic that pathologists in Paris were using and asked Lafarge's doctors if they could apply the same test in this case. Dr. Lespinasse hastily replied that they could, hiding their ignorance of the test and the intricacies of its procedure. =The Marsh test= The test that Moran was referring to was actually invented in 1836 by a Scottish chemist named James Marsh, who worked at the Royal Arsenal in Woolwich. Called upon to help solve a murder nearby, he tried to detect arsenic using the old methods. While he was successful, the sample had decomposed and did not convince the jury of the defendant's guilt. Frustrated at this turn of events, Marsh developed a glass apparatus not only to detect minute traces of arsenic, but also to measure its quantity. The sample is mixed with arsenic-free zinc and sulphuric acid, any arsenic present causing the production of arsine gas and hydrogen. The gas is then led through a tube where it is heated strongly, decomposing into hydrogen and arsenic vapor. When the arsenic vapor impinges on a cold surface, a mirror-like deposit of arsenic forms. Arrest and trial Despite this discovery, word on the Marsh test had not reached Brive. The doctors doing the autopsy on Lafarge only took the stomach before burial, and this they subjected using the old methods, which, unknown to them, proved to be unreliable; but they finally asserted that arsenic was found in quantity in the body of Charles Lafarge. More surprising was the analysis of the rat- poison paste; it turned out to be nothing more than a mixture of flour, water and soda. This led to the possibility that Marie used the real arsenic to murder her husband. Any remaining doubts that may have lingered vanished when Emma Pontier turned over the small malachite box, and Dr. Lespinasse found it to contain arsenic. Marie was arrested and held in jail in Brive. A young French lawyer, Charles Lachaud, was appointed to her defense and was assisted by three others, Ma√Ætres Th√©odore Bac (who later became mayor of Limoges during the 1848 Revolution), Paillet, and Desmont. Before they began their work, there was another surprise in store. The newspaper stories regarding Marie Lafarge turned up something from her past. =Theft= Before she met Charles Lafarge, Marie had gone to one of her schoolmates, the Viscountess de L√©autaud, at her ch√¢teau. While she was there, her friend's jewels disappeared, and the S√ªret√© was called upon to investigate the matter. When it was suspected that Marie was the culprit, the Viscount thought that too improbable, and the matter was not pursued any further. However, in the wake of the newspaper stories regarding the murder, the Viscount was reminded of the theft and demanded a search for the jewels in Marie's room in Le Glandier. When the jewels turned up during the search, some newspapers believed her and put all the blame on the Viscountess. However, when she was put on trial for theft, the court was not so persuaded. Marie was found guilty and sentenced to two years' imprisonment in the nearby town of Tulle. =Trial= By this time, the Lafarge affair had generated so much interest that the curious arrived from all over Europe to watch her murder trial, elevating it to a cause c√©l√®bre. Thus, when Marie entered the assize court of Tulle for the first time on 3 September 1840, dressed in mourning and carrying a bottle of smelling salts in her hand, projecting the image of a woman unjustly accused, the spectators were immediately divided into pro- and anti-Marie factions. Coincidentally, one of Marie's defense lawyers, Ma√Ætre Paillet, was also the lawyer of the renowned toxicologist Mathieu Orfila, who was the acknowledged expert of the Marsh test in France. He realized that as the case hinged largely on the tests made by the Brive doctors, Paillet wrote to Orfila and showed him the test results. Orfila then submitted an affidavit stating that the tests were conducted so ignorantly that they meant nothing. As soon as the Brive doctors testified that arsenic was present in Lafarge's body, Paillet read the affidavit aloud, told the court about the Marsh test, and demanded that Orfila be called. The prosecutor replied that he would consent to the test since he was confident of Marie's guilt, but he felt there was no need to call on Orfila to do it. The president of the court ruled in favor of the prosecutor's suggestion. Therefore, in lieu of Orfila, two well-known apothecaries from Tulle, M. Dubois and his son, and a chemist from Limoges named Dupuytren, were assigned to conduct the tests. While they were performed, the trial proceeded at a snail's pace. When they finally entered the courtroom, everyone waited to see what they would say. The elder Dubois testified that despite using the Marsh test carefully, they failed to find any arsenic. Almost immediately, the courtroom was in an uproar as Marie felt vindicated. By then, the prosecutor had read Orfila's book and knew that in some cases, the arsenic left the stomach but had spread to other parts of the body. He arranged for the body of Lafarge to be exhumed. Again, the three chemists performed the test on the samples taken‚Äîand again, no arsenic was found. The prosecutor had one card left to play. He had not forgotten the food items that Marie gave to Charles and were set aside. He requested that the test be performed on those as well. The defence, by then in a magnanimous mood, agreed. This time, when the chemists arrived, they declared that they tested positive for arsenic, with the eggnog containing enough \\"to poison ten persons\\". The prosecutor took this as a chance to recoup his earlier setbacks. He declared that in view of the contradictory results, it was apparent that the court should call upon Orfila to settle the issue once and for all. Since it was the defence who originally asked for Orfila, they could not object to this request. The defence agreed, already confident of Marie's acquittal. =Mathieu Orfila= When Orfila arrived, he insisted that the local chemists witness his experiments that night. He used the same test materials and chemical reagents that they used in the earliest tests and performed the Marsh test in an anteroom of the courthouse, behind locked and guarded doors. At last, on the afternoon of the next day, Orfila entered the courtroom, followed by the three chemists with bowed heads. He declared that he had indeed found arsenic on the samples taken from the body of Lafarge, to the exclusion of all other extraneous sources, such as arsenic naturally occurring in the body, or from the reagents, or from the arsenic from the earth surrounding the coffin. The courtroom was stunned, especially Ma√Ætre Paillet, as he listened to Orfila, his client and defense witness, explain the misleading results obtained by the local experts with the Marsh test. It was not the test that gave the erroneous results, but rather, the test was performed incorrectly. Knowing that Orfila's testimony had tipped the balance against them, the defense team sought to call a known opponent of Orfila, Fran√ßois Vincent Raspail, to refute his testimony. While Raspail had agreed, as he had done in previous courtroom clashes with Orfila, he arrived four hours too late: the jury had decided on Marie's case, guilty. Conviction and controversy In the end, despite the passionate pleadings of Charles Lachaud, Marie, no longer as composed as she was previously throughout the trial, heard herself sentenced by the president of the court to life imprisonment with hard labor on 19 September and was brought to Montpellier to serve out her sentence. King Louis-Philippe, however, commuted her sentence to life without hard labor. By then, the affair had polarized French society. George Sand wrote to her friend Eug√®ne Delacroix criticizing the perceived railroading of the case (it was worth noting that Marie, in turn, was an admirer of Sand and was said to read her works \\"greedily\\"). Raspail, as if to make up for his failure to make a difference in the trial, wrote and published incendiary leaflets against Orfila while demanding for Marie's release. In effect, many have felt that Marie was a victim of injustice, convicted by scientific evidence of uncertain validity. As if to defend himself from these criticisms, in the following months after the trial, Orfila conducted well-attended public lectures, often in the presence of members of the Academy of Medicine of Paris, to explain his views on the Marsh test. Soon, public awareness of the test was such that it was duplicated in salons and even in some plays recreating the Lafarge case. Aftermath While imprisoned, Marie wrote her M√©moires, which was published in 1841. At last, in June 1852, stricken with tuberculosis, she was released by Napoleon III. She settled in Ussat in the d√©partement of Ari√®ge and died on 7 November the same year, protesting her innocence to the last. She was buried in the cemetery of Ornolac. For Charles Lachaud, the Lafarge case was his baptism of fire. He later achieved greater fame defending Fran√ßois Achille Bazaine against charges of treason and was able to defend successfully another woman named Marie‚Äîlast name Bi√®re‚Äîin 1880. However, Jeanne Br√©court, whom he defended in 1877, was found guilty. As for the monastery, it was bought again by the Carthusian monks in 1860 and flourished as before until it was sold again in 1904. It served as a shelter for children in World War I, then as a sanitarium for women and children run by the d√©partement of the Seine until 5 January 1965, when it became a shelter for semi-handicapped children. Finally, in January 2005, it was purchased by the d√©partement of Corr√®ze. The site of the former foundry (also that of the watermill powering it) is now privately owned. In popular culture In 1937, the Lafarge case was fictionalized in the novel The Lady and the Arsenic by Joseph Shearing (a pseudonym of Marjorie Bowen). The story of Marie Lafarge got the cinematic treatment in 1938 with the release of the film L'Affaire Lafarge, directed by Pierre Chenal, with Marcelle Chantal as Marie and Pierre Renoir as Charles. The film itself is notable for being the first French film to use flashbacks as a narrative device. Of course, as with the real-life case, the film was not free from controversy, as the grand-niece of Charles Lafarge sued the film's producers for defaming the memory of her great-uncle. The CBS radio series Crime Classics broadcast a version of the story of Marie Lafarge in its October 14, 1953 episode, entitled \\"The Seven Layered Arsenic Cake of Madame Lafarge\\". Marie Lafarge was portrayed by Eve McVeagh, while William Conrad played the part of Charles Lafarge.

Engaged against the Royal Navy after 1794, she was damaged in the Battle of Trafalgar and wrecked near the Spanish city of Cadiz on 24 October 1805.  Early service  Indomptable was designed by naval engineer Jacques-No√´l San√© and laid down in Brest in September 1788. She was launched on 20 December 1790, and completed in February 1791. Between 1793 and 1794, she was under Bruix. Her first engagement was on 29 May 1794 against and during the Glorious First of June campaign. Following the battle the dismasted Indomptable was towed back to Brest by Brutus. In 1795, she served in the Mediterranean under Admiral Fran√ßois Joseph Bouvet and took part in the landing attempt in Ireland planned by General Louis Lazare Hoche. In 1801, she was engaged in the campaign in Egypt, but was unable to break the English blockade and stayed in Toulon. Other elements of the fleet managed to reach Elba. Indomptable fought in the battle of Algeciras in 1801 when she was again badly damaged. In 1802 and 1803, she served in Toulon under Admiral Latouche Tr√©ville.  Trafalgar campaign  On 17 January 1805, she went to sea under Admiral Villeneuve, together with ten other ships of the line and eight frigates, and on 20 January the fleet sailed for the French Caribbean. Off Cadiz, the fleet was joined by the 74-gun Aigle, and six Spanish ships of the line under Vice- Admiral Federico Gravina. When the fleet reached the West Indies, Villeneuve sent Commodore Cosmao-Kerjulien with the and the to attack the British position on Diamond Rock, which surrendered on 2 June. Villeneuve returned to Europe on hearing that Horatio Nelson had arrived in the West Indies. = Cape Finisterre and Trafalgar = On 22 July 1805, in the battle of Cape Finisterre the quartermasters of Indomptable spotted the British fleet under Sir Robert Calder. After a violent artillery exchange, the fleets became separated in the fog. Exhausted after six months at sea, the fleet anchored in Ferrol before sailing to C√°diz to rest and refit. With his command under question and planning to meet the British fleet to gain a decisive victory, Villeneuve left C√°diz and met the British fleet near Cape Trafalgar. Indomptable was in the Spanish line between San Justo and Santa Ana at the opening of the Battle of Trafalgar on 21 October 1805. She engaged Vice-Admiral Cuthbert Collingwood's flagship off her lee beam as she approached, then raked William Hargood's as that ship passed Indomptables stern. Later, she engaged , and , losing her place in the line but regrouping behind the Spanish flagship . Downwind of the British and effectively out of range, Indomptable turned towards the bay of Cadiz. At about two in the morning of 22 October, her crew heard distress calls from the French ship which had struck a reef off Santa Catalina fort. The ship's boat was run out and brought alongside Bucentaure, whose crew requested an anchor and hawsers to secure their vessel. This became impractical as Bucentaure settled deeper onto the rocks and began to sink: instead, Indomptables boats began ferrying sailors off the vessel and back to their own. Rescue efforts continued until mid-afternoon on 23 October, by which time Bucentaure was completely submerged.  Wreck  On the following night, a storm broke Indomptables anchor chains and she was carried onto rocks offshore from Cadiz. Contemporary accounts estimate between 1,000 and 1,400 people were on board, including around 500 rescued from Bucentaure the previous night, and two men from who had been aboard Bucentaure as prize crew. Around 150 men survived the wreck, including just two of the twenty-four officers on board.

In this condition, the embryological structure known as the truncus arteriosus fails to properly divide into the pulmonary trunk and aorta. This results in one arterial trunk arising from the heart and providing mixed blood to the coronary arteries, pulmonary arteries, and systemic circulation. Causes Most of the time, this defect occurs spontaneously. Genetic disorders, and teratogens (viruses, metabolic imbalance, and industrial or pharmacological agents) have been associated as possible causes. Up to 50% (varies in studies) of cases are associated with chromosome 22q11 deletions (DiGeorge Syndrome). The neural crest, specifically a population known as the cardiac neural crest, directly contributes to the aorticopulmonary septum. Microablation of the cardiac neural crest in developing chick embryos and genetic anomalies affecting this population of cells in rodents results in persistent truncus arteriosus. Numerous perturbations affecting the cardiac neural crest have been associated with persistent truncus arteriosus, some of which include growth factors (fibroblast growth factor 8 and bone morphogenetic protein), transcription factors (T-box, Pax, Nkx2-5, GATA-6, and Forkhead), and gap junction proteins (Connexin). The cardiac neural crest also contributes the smooth muscle of the great arteries. Pathophysiology 190px Anatomical changes associated with this disorder includes: * single artery arising from the two ventricles which gives rise to both the aortic and pulmonary vessels * abnormal truncal valve * right sided aortic arch in about 30% of cases (not shown) * large ventricular septal defect * pulmonary hypertension * complete mixing occurring at level of the great vessel * right-to-left shunting of blood Diagnosis * Cyanosis presents at birth * Heart failure may occur within weeks * Systolic ejection murmur is heard at the left sternal border * Widened pulse pressure * Bounding arterial pulses * Loud second heart sound * Biventricular hypertrophy * Cardiomegaly * Increased pulmonary vascularity * Hypocalcemia (if associated with DiGeorge syndrome) =Classification= The most well-known classification was the fourfold system developed by Collett and Edwards in 1949.Collett RW, Edwards JE: Persistent truncus arteriosus: a classification according to anatomic types. Surg Clin North Am 1949; 29: 1245-70. Collett/Edwards Types I, II, and III are distinguished by the branching pattern of the pulmonary arteries: * Type I: truncus -> one pulmonary artery -> two lateral pulmonary arteries * Type II: truncus -> two posterior/posterolateral pulmonary arteries * Type III: truncus -> two lateral pulmonary arteries The \\"Type IV\\" proposed in 1949 is no longer considered a form of PTA by most modern sources. Another well-known classification was defined by Van Praaghs in 1965. Treatment Treatment is with neonatal surgical repair, with the objective of restoring a normal pattern of blood flow. The surgery is open heart, and the patient will be placed on cardiopulmonary bypass to allow the surgeon to work on a still heart. The heart is opened and the ventricular septal defect is closed with a patch. The pulmonary arteries are then detached from the common artery (truncus arteriosus) and connected to the right ventricle using a tube (a conduit or tunnel). The common artery, now separated from the pulmonary circulation, functions as the aorta with the truncal valve operating as the aortic valve. Most babies survive this surgical repair, but may require further surgery as they grow up. For example, the conduit does not grow with the child and may need to be replaced as the child grows. Furthermore, the truncal valve is often abnormal and may require future surgery to improve its function. There have been cases where the condition has been diagnosed at birth and surgical intervention is an option. A number of these cases have survived well into adulthood. Epidemiology Persistent truncus arteriosus is a rare cardiac abnormality that has a prevalence of less than 1%.

It has a boarding department with an international intake and is similar to the former English public schools of the Direct grant grammar school type. It is a member of the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference. History One of a number of free schools created by King James I of England & Ireland, James VI of Scotland in 1608, the school was to educate the sons of local Protestant merchants and farmers during the plantation of Ulster. It has four \\"sister\\" schools: Royal School Dungannon, in Dungannon, County Tyrone, Portora Royal School in Enniskillen, County Fermanagh, the Royal School Cavan in Cavan, County Cavan, and the Royal and Prior School in Raphoe, County Donegal. In November 2013 the school was placed 78th in 'The Sunday Times Top 200 UK Schools Guide' for results at A level and GCSE combined. In May 2014, an inspection by the Education and Training Inspectorate found the leadership and management of the school to be 'outstanding'. Originally intended to be sited at Mountnorris, South Armagh, the turbulent situation in Ulster at the time led to a move to the relative safety of Armagh city. Despite this, an early headmaster of the school, John Starkey, and his family, were drowned by insurgents during the 1641 Rebellion. The school arrived at its current site on College Hill in the 1770s. A boys' school from its inception, the Royal School was amalgamated with Armagh Girls' High School in 1986 to become co- educational. Each pupil is assigned to a house ‚Äì Darcy, Rokeby, Beresford or Armstrong ‚Äì which are named after former Church of Ireland Archbishops. Successive Archbishops have chaired the Board of Governors for over four centuries. In 2008, the Royal School celebrated its quatercentenary along with the four other 1608 Royal Schools. To mark the occasion, the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh visited the school. A history of the 1608 Royal Schools was produced in the same year by former Headmaster, Mr Thomas Duncan. Royal sport A more productive outlet for the pupils' exuberance was found in rugby union and the school was the inaugural winner of the Ulster Schools Cup, beating Royal Belfast Academical Institution after three replays. They won it again the next year and continued to dominate the early years of the competition, winning it seven times in the first ten years. Fortunes waned after this, with only three finals contested between the victories in 1885 and 1977, none of which was won by the Royal. However, this lack of success is mitigated by the fact that the school did not compete in the competition for around fifty years following the death of a pupil during a match in 1928. The Royal last won the Schools Cup in 2004, beating Campbell College in the final. John McCall, the captain of that team, died 10 days after the final while playing for the Ireland U19 rugby team in the IRB U19 World Championship in South Africa. John had been told of his selection for this team on the day of the Schools Cup final. A few months later, a second member of the squad, Todd Graham, was killed in a road accident while visiting his parents at their home in Zambia.

There are also Angelmouse books and plush toys. Characters *Angelmouse - A mouse who is an angel. He lives on earth with his friend Quilly, and receives missions to do good deeds from \\"You-know-who\\" (God). He has wings and a \\"thingamajig\\" (halo), which is loose and can slip, shrink, wobble or even disappear when he misbehaves or neglects his mission. His Thingamajig can also mend things and solve problems. *Quilly - A bird, who gives Angelmouse advice and prompts him to start or continue his missions. He is also the narrator of each episode. *Elliemum - A sensible, kind and cheerful elephant and the mother of Baby Ellie who highly regards Angelmouse as a 'real angel'. *Baby Ellie - Elliemum's baby elephant, who likes to play and join in the fun. *Oswald - A duck, who loves to speed especially on roller-skates.

(They made their first appearance in the episode \\"My Friend Angelmouse\\") *Angel Teacher - The teacher of all of the angels, he firstly appeared in the episode \\"My Friend Angelmouse\\", revealing that he sometimes gets annoyed when Angelmouse makes a mistake. *You-know-who - He is actually God, whom he is referred throughout the series as You-know- who by both Angelmouse and Quilly (and possibly the other characters). He is never shown or has said anything by word (despite that He sends Angelmouse missions by a piece of paper that flies with wings above it) due to that since He is God from the religion Christianity, it is believed that He is not a man, and has no shape or form, and He is a supreme male divine spirit. (Whenever Angelmouse's Thingamajig disappears when he makes a mistake, it is possible that You-know-who is responsible for taking the Thingamajig away as Angelmouse's punishment for some sort.) *The Weather Angels - 3 angels that often deal with the weather. *-The Sun Angel - He has the sun power of sunlight/daylight. *-The Wind Angel - He has the ability to provide wind by taking a deep breath and blowing the wind out of his mouth. *-The Rain Angel - He has the power to provide rain to Earth.

The town is encircled by massive Venetian Defensive Systems that are a UNESCO World Heritage Site. , Spain, an example of bastion fort Bourtange fortification, restored to its 1742 condition, Groningen, the Netherlands Plan of Tvrƒëa from 1861, in Osijek, Croatia. Naarden, the Netherlands right A bastion fort or trace italienne (a phrase derived from non-standard French, literally meaning Italian outline), is a fortification in a style that evolved during the early modern period of gunpowder when the cannon came to dominate the battlefield. It was first seen in the mid- fifteenth century in Italy. Some types, especially when combined with ravelins and other outworks, resembled the related star fort of the same era. The design of the fort is normally a polygon with bastions at the corners of the walls. These outcroppings eliminated protected blind spots, called \\"dead zones\\", and allowed fire along the curtain from positions protected from direct fire. Many bastion forts also feature cavaliers, which are raised secondary structures based entirely inside the primary structure.  Origins  Fortification plan of Coevorden, laid out in a radial pattern within polygonal fortifications and extensive outer earthworks as reconstructed in the early seventeenth century by Maurice, Prince of Orange Their predecessors, medieval fortresses, were usually placed on high hills. From there, arrows were shot at the enemies. The enemies' hope was to either ram the gate or climb over the wall with ladders and overcome the defenders. For the invading force, these fortifications proved quite difficult to overcome, and accordingly, fortresses occupied a key position in warfare. Passive ring- shaped (enceinte) fortifications of the Medieval era proved vulnerable to damage or destruction by cannon fire, when it could be directed from outside against a perpendicular masonry wall. In addition, an attacking force that could get close to the wall was able to conduct undermining operations in relative safety, as the defenders could not shoot at them from nearby walls, until the development of Machicolation. In contrast, the bastion fortress was a very flat structure composed of many triangular bastions, specifically designed to cover each other, and a ditch. In order to counteract the cannonballs, defensive walls were made lower and thicker. To counteract the fact that lower walls were easier to climb, the ditch was widened so that attacking infantry were still exposed to fire from a higher elevation, including enfilading fire from the bastions. The outer side of the ditch was usually provided with a glacis to deflect cannonballs aimed at the lower part of the main wall. Further structures, such as ravelins, tenailles, hornworks or crownworks, and even detached forts could be added to create complex outer works to further protect the main wall from artillery, and sometimes provide additional defensive positions. They were built of many materials, usually earth and brick, as brick does not shatter on impact from a cannonball as stone does. Bastion fortifications were further developed in the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries primarily in response to the French invasion of the Italian peninsula. The French army was equipped with new cannon and bombards that were easily able to destroy traditional fortifications built in the Middle Ages. Star forts were employed by Michelangelo in the defensive earthworks of Florence, and refined in the sixteenth century by Baldassare Peruzzi and Vincenzo Scamozzi. The design spread out of Italy in the 1530s and 1540s. It was employed heavily throughout Europe for the following three centuries. Italian engineers were heavily in demand throughout Europe to help build the new fortifications. The late- seventeenth-century architects Menno van Coehoorn and especially Vauban, Louis XIV's military engineer, are considered to have taken the form to its logical extreme. \\"Fortresses... acquired ravelins and redoubts, bonnettes and lunettes, tenailles and tenaillons, counterguards and crownworks and hornworks and curvettes and fausse brayes and scarps and cordons and banquettes and counterscarps...\\" The star-shaped fortification had a formative influence on the patterning of the Renaissance ideal city: \\"The Renaissance was hypnotized by one city type which for a century and a half‚Äîfrom Filarete to Scamozzi‚Äîwas impressed upon all utopian schemes: this is the star-shaped city.\\"Siegfried Giedion, Space, Time and Architecture (1941) 1962 p 43. In the 19th century, the development of the explosive shell changed the nature of defensive fortifications. Elvas, in Portugal is considered by some to be the best surviving example of the Dutch school of fortifications. =Slopes= When the newly-effective maneuverable siege cannon came into military strategy in the fifteenth century, the response from military engineers was to arrange for the walls to be embedded into ditches fronted by earthen slopes (glacis) so that they could not be attacked by destructive direct fire and to have the walls topped by earthen banks that absorbed and largely dissipated the energy of plunging fire. Where conditions allowed, as in Fort Manoel in Malta, the ditches were cut into the native rock, and the wall at the inside of the ditch was simply unquarried native rock. As the walls became lower, they also became more vulnerable to assault. =Dead zone= The rounded shape that had previously been dominant for the design of turrets created \\"dead space\\", or \\"dead\\" zones, which were relatively sheltered from defending fire, because direct fire from other parts of the walls could not be directed around the curved wall. To prevent this, what had previously been round or square turrets were extended into diamond-shaped points to give storming infantry no shelter. The ditches and walls channeled attacking infantry into carefully constructed zwinger, bailey, or similar \\"kill zone\\" grounds where defensive cannon could decimate infantry attempting to storm the walls, with emplacements set so that the attacking infantry had no place to shelter from the defensive fire. =Enfilade= A further and more subtle change was to move from a passive model of defence to an active one. The lower walls were more vulnerable to being stormed, and the protection that the earthen banking provided against direct fire failed if the attackers could occupy the slope on the outside of the ditch and mount an attacking cannon there. Therefore, the shape was designed to make maximum use of enfilade (or flanking) fire against any attackers who should reach the base of any of the walls. The indentations in the base of each point on the star sheltered cannons. Those cannons would have a clear line of fire directly down the edge of the neighboring points, while their point of the star was protected by fire from the base of those points. The evolution of these ideas can be seen in transitional fortifications such as Sarzana in northwest Italy.Harris, J., \\"Sarzana and Sarzanello ‚Äì Transitional Design and Renaissance Designers\\" , Fort (Fortress Study Group), No. 37, 2009, pp. 50‚Äì78 =Other changes= Ideal fortified city: a plan of Nov√© Z√°mky (Neuh√§usel) in Slovakia, built in 1663, drawn c. 1680 Thus forts evolved complex shapes that allowed defensive batteries of cannon to command interlocking fields of fire. Forward batteries commanded the slopes which defended walls deeper in the complex from direct fire. The defending cannon were not simply intended to deal with attempts to storm the walls, but to actively challenge attacking cannon and deny them approach close enough to the fort to engage in direct fire against the vulnerable walls. The key to the fort's defence moved to the outer edge of the ditch surrounding the fort, known as the covered way, or covert way. Defenders could move relatively safely in the cover of the ditch and could engage in active countermeasures to keep control of the glacis, the open slope that lay outside the ditch, by creating defensive earthworks to deny the enemy access to the glacis and thus to firing points that could bear directly onto the walls and by digging counter mines to intercept and disrupt attempts to mine the fort walls. Compared to medieval fortifications, forts became both lower and larger in area, providing defence in depth, with tiers of defences that an attacker needed to overcome in order to bring cannon to bear on the inner layers of defences. Firing emplacements for defending cannon were heavily defended from bombardment by external fire, but open towards the inside of the fort, not only to diminish their usefulness to the attacker should they be overcome, but also to allow the large volumes of smoke that the defending cannon would generate to dissipate. Fortifications of this type continued to be effective while the attackers were armed only with cannon, where the majority of the damage inflicted was caused by momentum from the impact of solid shot. Because only low explosives such as black powder were available, explosive shells were largely ineffective against such fortifications. The development of mortars, high explosives, and the consequent large increase in the destructive power of explosive shells and thus plunging fire rendered the intricate geometry of such fortifications irrelevant. Warfare was to become more mobile. It took, however, many years to abandon the old fortress thinking. Cyclopaedia  Construction  Bastion forts were very expensive. Amsterdam's 22 bastions cost 11 million florins, and Siena in 1544 bankrupted itself to pay for its defences. For this reason, bastion forts were often improvised from earlier defences. Medieval curtain walls were torn down, and a ditch was dug in front of them. The earth used from the excavation was piled behind the walls to create a solid structure. While purpose-built fortifications would often have a brick fascia because of the material's ability to absorb the shock of artillery fire, many improvised defences cut costs by leaving this stage out and instead opting for more earth. Improvisation could also consist of lowering medieval round towers and infilling them with earth to strengthen the structures. It was also often necessary to widen and deepen the ditch outside the walls to create a more effective barrier to frontal assault and mining. Engineers from the 1520s were also building massive, gently sloping banks of earth called glacis in front of ditches so that the walls were almost totally hidden from horizontal artillery fire. The main benefit of the glaces was to deny enemy artillery the ability to fire point blank. The lower the angle of elevation, the higher the stopping power. Plan of bastion fortress Plan of Geneva in 1841. The colossal fortifications, among the most important in Europe, were demolished ten years later. Olomouc (c.1757) bastion fortress in Moravia (today's Czech Republic) The first key instance of a trace Italianate was at the Papal port of Civitavecchia, where the original walls were lowered and thickened because the stone tended to shatter under bombardment.  Effectiveness  The first major battle which truly showed the effectiveness of trace Italienne was the defence of Pisa in 1500 against a combined Florentine and French army. With the original medieval fortifications beginning to crumble to French cannon fire, the Pisans constructed an earthen rampart behind the threatened sector. It was discovered that the sloping earthen rampart could be defended against escalade and was also much more resistant to cannon fire than the curtain wall it had replaced. The second siege was that of Padua in 1509. A monk engineer named Fra Giocondo, trusted with the defence of the Venetian city, cut down the city's medieval wall and surrounded the city with a broad ditch that could be swept by flanking fire from gun ports set low in projections extending into the ditch. Finding that their cannon fire made little impression on these low ramparts, the French and allied besiegers made several bloody and fruitless assaults and then withdrew. The new type of fortification also played a role in the numerous Mediterranean wars, slowing down the Ottoman expansion. Although Rhodes had been partially upgraded to the new type of fortifications after the 1480 siege, it was still conquered in 1522; nevertheless it was a long and bloody siege, and the besieged had no hope of outside relief because the island was close to the Ottoman power base and far from any allies. On the other hand, the Ottomans failed to take Corfu in 1537 in no small part because of the new fortifications, and several attempts spanning almost two centuries (another major one was in 1716) also failed. The Siege of Malta ‚Äì Capture of Fort Saint Elmo by Matteo Perez d'Aleccio Two star forts were built by the Order of Saint John on the island of Malta in 1552, Fort Saint Elmo and Fort Saint Michael. Fort Saint Elmo played a critical role in the Ottoman siege of 1565 when it managed to hold out heavy bombardment for over a month. Eventually it fell, but the Ottoman casualties were very high, and it bought time for the relief force which arrived from Sicily to relieve the rest of the besieged island. The star fort therefore played a crucial and decisive role in the siege. After the fall of Venice to Napoleon, Corfu was occupied in 1797 by the French republican armies. The now ancient fortifications were still of some value at this point. A Russian‚ÄìOttoman‚ÄìEnglish alliance led at sea by Admiral Ushakov and with troops sent by Ali Pasha retook Corfu in 1799 after a four- month siege, when the garrison led by general Louis Fran√ßois Jean Chabot, being short of provisions and having lost the key island of Vido at the entrance of the port, surrendered and was allowed passage back to France.  Role in the Military Revolution  Venetian walls of Nicosia, Cyprus (1597) are a typical example of Italian Renaissance military architecture that survives to this day. According to Geoffrey Parker in his article, The Military Revolution 1560‚Äì1660: A Myth?, the appearance of the trace Italienne in early modern Europe, and the difficulty of taking such fortifications, resulted in a profound change in military strategy, most importantly, Parker argued, an increase in army sizes necessary to attack these forts. \\"Wars became a series of protracted sieges,\\" Parker suggests, and open-pitch battles became \\"irrelevant\\" in regions where the trace Italienne existed. Ultimately, Parker argues, \\"military geography\\", in other words, the existence or absence of the trace Italienne in a given area, shaped military strategy in the early modern period. This is a profound alteration of the Military Revolution thesis originally proposed by Michael Roberts in 1955. Parker's emphasis on the fortification as the key element has attracted substantial criticism from some academics, such as John A. Lynn and M. S. Kingra, particularly with respect to the claimed causal link between the new fortress design and increases in army sizes during this period.Kingra, Mahinder S. 'The Trace Italienne and the Military Revolution During the Eighty Years' War, 1567‚Äì1648.' The Journal of Military History 57, No. 3 (July, 1993): 431‚Äì446  Obsolescence  The structure of Fort Wood on Liberty Island in New York City, United States, was used for the foundation of the Statue of Liberty In the nineteenth century, with the development of more powerful artillery and explosive shells, star forts were replaced by simpler but more robust polygonal forts. In the twentieth century, with the development of tanks and aerial warfare during and after the First World War, fixed fortifications became and have remained less important than in previous centuries.

The Kemi Oba culture is contemporaneous and partly overlapping with the Catacomb culture. Origins According to Mallory, this was a component of the larger Yamnaya horizon, while Anthony regards it to be a separate culture, which was replaced by a late Yamnaya variant after 2800 BCE. Characteristics The economy was based on both stockbreeding and agriculture. It had its own distinctive pottery, which is suggested to be more refined than that of its neighbors. The inhumation practice was to lay the remains on its side, with the knees flexed, in pits, stone lined cists or timber-framed graves topped with a kurgan. Of particular interest are carved stone stelae or menhirs that also show up in secondary use in Yamnaya culture burials. Metal objects were imported from the Maykop culture.

The current building is the sixth to serve as the capitol building since Illinois was admitted to the United States in 1818. Built in the architectural styles of the French Renaissance and Italianate, it was designed by Cochrane and Garnsey, an architecture and design firm based in Chicago. Ground was broken for the new capitol on March 11, 1868, and the building was completed twenty years later for a total cost of $4.5 million. The building contains the chambers for the Illinois General Assembly, which is made up of the Illinois House of Representatives and the Illinois Senate. An office for the Governor of Illinois, additional offices, and committee rooms are also in the building. The capitol's footprint is in the shape of a Greek cross with four equal wings. Its tall central dome, and tower roofs, are covered in zinc to provide a silvery facade which does not weather. Architecture scholar Jean A. Follett describes it as a building that \\"is monumental in scale and rich in detail.\\" The interior of the dome features a plaster frieze painted to resemble bronze, which illustrates scenes from Illinois history, and stained glass windows, including a stained glass replica of the state seal in the oculus of the dome. Description With a total height of , the Illinois capitol is the tallest non-skyscraper capitol, even exceeding the height of the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C. In contrast, the shortest skyscraper capitol stands a mere tall. The only state capitols taller than it are the non-classical designs of Louisiana and Nebraska, whose governments opted for more modern structures. The dome itself is wide, and is supported by solid bedrock, below the surface. It is the highest (though not the tallest) building in Sangamon County. The Wyndham Springfield City Centre is taller than the capitol, however it is on lower ground, making the capitol building higher. A city statute does not allow buildings taller than the capitol. The building itself is shaped like a Latin cross aligned to the major compass directions, and measures from the north end to the south end, and from the east end to the west end. The capitol occupies a nine acre plot of land which forms the capitol grounds. William Douglas Richardson served as one of the principal contractors for the construction of the capitol building, and Jacob Bunn, an in-law of W. D. Richardson, served as chairman of the capitol construction steering committee. Detail of the dome interior When the capitol was constructed, several empty shafts were included for the future installation of elevators. The original water-operated elevators were installed in 1887 and were sometimes the subject of ridicule by local newspapers as they were deemed inadequate for a building with the prestige of the State Capitol. Electric elevators were later installed sometime before 1939 when the legislature appropriated $30,000 for their repair. Renovation In 2011, the facility underwent a $50 million renovation, primarily focused on the west wing, to upgrade life safety, ADA accessibility and mechanical, electrical and plumbing infrastructure as well as architectural improvements to bring the capitol closer to its original 1870s appearance, the \\"period of significance\\" for the building. Improvements included refinishing of interiors and exposed brick arches in the basement; installation of maiden lamp posts for the grand staircase, new chandeliers, and copper-clad exterior doors; and removal of a second floor mezzanine. One of the pair of female statues added to the west wing staircase in the State Capitol as part of the $50 million renovation from 2011‚Äì13. The addition of the maiden statues is particularly notable, since they had been intended for the building since the 1870s when architect Alfred Piquenard designed them as part of the original plan. Piquenard was also the architect for the Iowa State Capitol, which is of a similar style, albeit 3/4 the size. Illinois legislators of the 1870s thought that the scantily clad women were too risqu√© but the Iowans had no objection. Illinois therefore had plain lamps installed at the base of its grand staircase, whereas the maiden lamps intended for Illinois were instead delivered to and installed at the Iowa State Capitol in Des Moines, where they remain to this day. The lamps now installed at Illinois as part of this renovation are replicas of those at Iowa's capitol. Andrew O'Connor (1918) at East Front of Capitol In 2014, the renovation achieved LEED Gold certification under the US Green Building Councils New Construction and Major Renovation program. Former capitols The current Capitol of Illinois is the sixth such building in the history of the state. The first was located in Kaskaskia, Illinois, a city on the Mississippi River founded by the French in 1709. Kaskaskia had been the territorial capital of Illinois since 1809, so it was deemed an appropriate location for the capital of the new state. The state leased the first capitol building, a two-story building, for the sum of $4.00 per day. Wishing to site the capital in the state's interior, the first General Assembly petitioned Congress for a grant of suitable land. Congress offered, and the state accepted, a land parcel up the Kaskaskia River about eighty miles northeast of Kaskaskia. This location, which would be named Vandalia, Illinois, was selected partly with the hopes of encouraging settlers to relocate to other parts of the state which were still uninhabited. The state allowed its lease on the first capital in Kaskaskia expire and relocated to Vandalia. =Fourth Statehouse= *Located in Vandalia, Vandalia was the location of the second, third, and fourth capitol buildings, where the legislature met between 1820 and 1837. In 1820, with the completion of the new, or \\"second\\", capitol, Vandalia became the capital of the state. The structure burned soon thereafter and a third capitol quickly rose in 1824 at a cost of $15,000. After its construction, many citizens began to advocate relocating the capitol to a location nearer the center of the state. A bill was introduced in 1833 for a statewide vote to determine a new location from a list of several choices including Alton, Jacksonville, Peoria, Springfield, Vandalia, and the state's actual geographic center. While Alton was the victor, the legislature determined the margin too small to be conclusive, and ignored the vote. In 1836, a young lawyer named Abraham Lincoln, along with colleagues of his of the legal profession, advocated moving the capital to Springfield. That summer the Vandalia capitol building was demolished by local citizens and replaced with the fourth capitol (built at a cost of $16,000) in an effort to keep the capital in Vandalia. Although the new brick structure was extravagant, the General Assembly ignored the gesture and voted to relocate the capital to Springfield on February 25, 1837. =Fifth Statehouse= *Located in Springfield, The sixth and current Illinois Capitol looking northwest On July 4, 1837, the first brick was laid for Illinois' fifth capitol designed by John F. Rague, who also designed the nearly identical Iowa Territorial Capitol. In 1853, the capitol was completed for a total sum of $260,000, almost twenty times the cost of any such previous structure. The building was designed in the Greek Revival style from stone quarried 6 miles from the site. For many years, it was the largest and most extravagant capitol of the western frontier of the United States. The fifth capitol is closely associated with Abraham Lincoln as it was here that he argued cases before the Illinois Supreme Court, served in the State Legislature, first debated Stephen Douglas, delivered his famous \\"House Divided\\" speech, and lay in state after his assassination on May 4, 1865. As Illinois prospered and experienced several booms in population, the fifth capitol became crowded, especially as a result of relocations after the Civil War. On February 24, 1867, the state voted to construct a new larger capitol. After breaking the ground for the sixth and current Capitol in 1868, the state recouped the costs of the fifth capitol by selling it to Sangamon County for $200,000. It served as the county court house until 1961 when the state again purchased the building and restored it as a historic landmark, the Old State Capitol State Historic Site.

Other names for this sauce include poor man's gravy, bird-eye gravy, bottom sop, cedar gravy, and red ham gravy. The gravy is made from the drippings of pan-fried country ham mixed with black coffee. Red-eye gravy is often served over ham, grits or biscuits. A common practice is to dip the inner sides of a split biscuit into the gravy in order to add flavor and keep the biscuit from being too dry when a piece of country ham is added between the two halves, sometimes called the Southern \\"ham biscuit\\". (The Appalachian ham biscuit is simply a biscuit with country ham.) Another popular way to serve red-eye gravy, especially in parts of Alabama, is with mustard or ketchup mixed in with the gravy. Biscuits are then dipped (\\"sopped\\" in Southern English) in the gravy. In Louisiana, Cajun cuisine-style gravy is made with a roast beef instead of ham. Black coffee is always used, and it is frequently a strongly brewed coffee substitute made from chicory. The gravy is ladled over the meat on a bed of rice, staining the rice a dark brown color. Often, French bread and some kind of beans are also served as a side, like butter beans, lima beans, or peas. Origin Red-eye gravy's name comes from its distinct appearance. Prepared traditionally, with coffee and grease combined in the final step (see Preparation below), a heterogeneous mixture forms with the water-based coffee sinking to the bottom and the oil-based grease forming the top layer. In a round bowl the mixture looks much like a red human eye.About.com Red Eye Gravy Recipe Use of red pepper enhances the redness of the appearance. Less traditional preparation techniques do not always result in the \\"red eye\\" appearance, leading to folk legends surrounding the origin of the name. For instance, one story is that former United States President Andrew Jackson requested ham with gravy as red as his cook's eyes, which were bloodshot from drinking the night before,Stradley, Linda. \\"History of Country Ham and Red-Eye Gravy\\". What's Cooking America. or that the black coffee in the gravy will keep people awake.Barrett, Elle. \\"Good gravy\\". Southern Living, February 1999. Preparation After a ham has been cooked, the grease is removed from the pan. Black coffee is then used to deglaze the pan. The coffee and grease are then poured into the same container in a one-to-one ratio. Other recipes exist, using water instead of coffee, or adding coffee with grease still present in the pan. When the coffee is added to the grease in this manner, a heterogeneous mixture may result that lacks the \\"red eye\\" appearance. Florida Crackers referred to tomato gravy as red-eye gravy, and prepare it in much the same way by adding flour and tomatoes to bacon grease. This is served with fried catfish or other fish.

It is named after the German chemist Siegfried H√ºnig. It is used in organic chemistry as a base. It is commonly abbreviated as DIPEA, DIEA, or i-Pr2NEt.  Structure  DIPEA consists of a central nitrogen that is bonded to an ethyl group and two isopropyl groups. A lone pair of electrons resides on the nitrogen atom, which can react with electrophiles. However, as the two isopropyl groups and the ethyl group occupy much of the space surrounding the nitrogen, only small electrophiles such as protons can react with the nitrogen lone pair.  Occurrence and preparation  DIPEA is synthetically produced and commercially available. It is traditionally prepared by the alkylation of diisopropylamine with diethyl sulfate. Pure DIPEA exists as a colorless liquid, although commercial samples can be slightly yellow. If necessary, the compound can be purified by distillation from potassium hydroxide or calcium hydride. Uses and reactions DIPEA is a hindered base that is commonly employed as an acid or proton scavenger. Thus, like 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine and triethylamine, DIPEA is a good base but a poor nucleophile, a combination of properties that makes it a useful organic reagent. = Amide coupling = It is commonly used as the hindered base in amide coupling reactions between a carboxylic acid (typically activated, for example, as an acid chloride, as illustrated below) and a nucleophilic amine. As DIPEA is hindered and poorly nucleophilic, it does not compete with the nucleophilic amine in the coupling reaction. 700x700px = Alkylations = DIPEA has been investigated for its use as a selective reagent in the alkylation of secondary amines to tertiary amines by alkyl halides. This is often hampered by an unwanted Menshutkin reaction forming a quaternary ammonium salt, but is absent when DIPEA is present. :The use of H√ºnig's base for alkylating secondary amines = Transition metal catalyzed cross-coupling reactions = DIPEA can be used as a base in a number of transition metal catalyzed cross-coupling reactions, such as the Heck coupling and the Sonogashira coupling (as illustrated below). 450x450px = Swern oxidation = Although triethylamine is traditionally employed as the hindered base in Swern oxidations, the structurally similar DIPEA can be used instead, as exemplified below. 450x450px = Examples of DIPEA used as a substrate = DIPEA forms a complex heterocyclic compound called scorpionine (bis([1,2]dithiolo)-[1,4]thiazine) upon reaction with disulfur dichloride that is catalyzed by DABCO in a one-pot synthesis. :H√ºnig's base in the synthesis of sscorpionine = Comparison with triethylamine = DIPEA and triethylamine are structurally very similar, with both compounds considered hindered organic bases. Due to their structural similarity, DIPEA and triethylamine can be used interchangeably in most applications. The nitrogen atom in DIPEA is more shielded than the nitrogen atom in triethylamine. However, triethylamine is a slightly stronger base than DIPEA; the pKas of the respective conjugate acids in dimethyl sulfoxide are 9.0 and 8.5, respectively.

Autophradates (Greek: A·ΩêœÑoœÜœÅŒ±Œ¥Œ¨œÑŒ∑œÇ, Persian: Vadfradad, lived 4th century BC) was a Persian Satrap of Lydia, who also distinguished himself as a general in the reign of Artaxerxes III and Darius III. Rule as a satrap of Lydia During the reign of the Artaxerxes II, Autophradates captured Artabazus, the satrap of Lydia and Ionia who had revolted against the Persian king, and made him his prisoner, but afterwards was forced to set him free. Autophradates was also directed by Artaxerxes to put down the rebellion of the satrap of Cappadocia Datames. He went with a large army, but was obliged to retreat with heavy loss. Autophradates later joined the Revolt of the Satraps. =Resistance to Alexander the Great= Autophradates participated to the Achaemenid resistance against the campaigns of Alexander the Great in Asia Minor. Together with Pharnabazus III he supported militarily and financial the king of Sparta Agis III who was organizing resistance against the Macedians. After the death of the Persian admiral, Memnon, in 333 BC, Autophradates and Pharnabazus III, satrap of neighbouring Hellespontine Phrygia, undertook the command of the fleet, and reduced Mytilene, the siege of which had been begun by Memnon. Pharnabazus now sailed with his prisoners to Lycia, and Autophradates attacked the other islands in the Aegean sea which supported Alexander the Great. But Pharnabazus soon after joined Autophradates again, and both sailed against Tenedos, which was induced by fear to surrender to the Persians. During these expeditions Autophradates also laid siege to the town of Atarneus in Mysia, but without success.

At the start of the battle she joined , and , in engaging the second ship in the British lee column, . Belleisle was soon completely dismasted, unable to manoeuvre and largely unable to fight, as her sails blinded her batteries, but kept flying her flag for 45 minutes until the other British ships behind her in the column came to her rescue. As surrendered to , Deni√©port took advantage of a light wind to attempt to fill the gap in the line. She then found herself trapped between and , losing all of her rigging save for her lower masts. At 1:00 p.m, Ensign Arley was killed, followed around 1:30 by the first officer, Commander Montalembert. Captain Deni√©port had his leg partly shot off at 2:30, and was killed shortly after refusing to leave his station. With most officers incapacitated, command went to Ensign Jouan, who was killed after 15 minutes. He was replaced by Ensign Cauchard. By this time Achille was slowly sinking, but still managed to cut off Dreadnoughts main-mast and fore-mast. At 4:00, joined in. After 15 minutes, a fire broke out in Achilles mizzen top. The next broadside against her brought her blazing main mast down, engulfing the ship in flames. Knowing that her opponent's fate was sealed, Richard Grindall, the Princes captain, ceased firing and wore round to clear Achille before placing boats in the water to rescue the French seamen, as Achilles crew attempted to abandon ship. This proved hazardous as Achilles abandoned but loaded guns were set off by the intense heat now raging below decks. 158 French sailors were saved. The fires eventually reached her magazine and she blew up spectacularly at 5:45 p.m., taking 480 with her, and foundered quickly, her colours high, marking the end of the battle.

According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature, it was listed as Least Concern in 1996 until it was listed as Data Deficient in 2004. According to a 2013 book, it is known from a few specimens taken from four or five localities in a small area between the rivers White Nile and Blue Nile; its habitat is fields of vegetables and cereals. Aside from this information, nothing else is known about the species including its population and threats. Taxonomy Botta's gerbil was first described by the French zoologist and herpetologist Fernand Lataste in 1882, he named it Gerbillus bottai. It is known from a small number of locations in Sudan, between the Blue Nile and the White Nile to the south of Khartoum, with some possible sightings in northern Kenya. It may form part of a species complex alongside the Khartoum gerbil (Dipodillus stigmonyx), Harwood's gerbil (Dipodillus harwoodi), and Waters's gerbil (Gerbillus watersi) . However, D. harwoodi has a separate range in Kenya about to the south of the other three species and further investigation may elevate it to full species status. Description Botta's gerbil is a small species with sandy-brown upper parts with a blackish sheen, especially at the mid-line, and pure white underparts and limbs. The long tail is slightly bi-coloured, with dark hairs above and pale hairs below, the hairs at the tip forming a small tuft or pencil. References *Musser, G. G. and M. D. Carleton. 2005.

Early life Carl McCunn was born in Munich, Germany, where his father Donovan was stationed by the United States Army. He was raised in San Antonio, Texas, graduated from high school in 1964, and enlisted in the United States Navy shortly after dropping out of community college. McCunn served in the Navy for four years and was discharged in 1969. He briefly lived in Seattle, Washington before settling in Anchorage, Alaska in 1970. Alaskan excursion McCunn had lived five months on the Brooks Range in 1976. In March 1981, he hired a bush pilot to drop him off at a remote, unnamed lake approximately northeast of Fairbanks, near the confluence of the Coleen and Porcupine Rivers, on the southern margin of the Brooks Range. McCunn intended to photograph wildlife for about five months. On this trip, he flew in with 500 rolls of film, of provisions, two rifles, and a shotgun. Believing he would not need them, he prematurely disposed of five boxes of shotgun shells in the river near his camp. Although McCunn thought he had arranged for the pilot to return for him in August, he had apparently never confirmed this. In early August, when the expected plane had not arrived, he wrote in his diary, \\"I think I should have used more foresight about arranging my departure. I'll soon find out.\\" Apparently the pilot had told McCunn that he might be working in Anchorage at the end of the summer and that McCunn should not count on his help; according to the pilot, McCunn had given him money to repair his plane and to fly him into (but not out of) the remote site. By mid-August, it became obvious to McCunn that the bush pilot was not going to return for him. At this point he attempted to make his provisions last longer by shooting local game. He shot ducks and muskrats and tried drying the meat of a caribou he observed die in the lake. At this point, McCunn's diary indicated his hope that his family or friends would send someone to look for him after he failed to return. He had sent three maps with his campsite marked to some friends and his father, but was not clear about his exact itinerary. Although his father knew he would be in the area, he did not know when McCunn planned on returning. McCunn had also told his father not to be concerned if he did not return at the end of the summer, as he might stay later in the season if things went well. After McCunn was late to return from a prior trip, his concerned father had contacted the police; McCunn had asked his father not to do that again. McCunn's friends testified at the inquest they were not concerned as they believed he had already come out and was working in Paxson. Sighting An Alaska State Trooper flew over the lake in late August and observed McCunn's campsite. The pilot did not sense McCunn was in distress, since he waved his orange sleeping bag very casually and, on his third pass of the campsite, he saw McCunn casually walking back to his tent. The State Trooper later testified he saw no reason to surmise McCunn needed any assistance. McCunn later wrote in his diary: \\"I recall raising my right hand, shoulder high and shaking my fist on the plane's second pass. It was a little cheer like when your team scored a touchdown or something. Turns out that's the signal for 'ALL O.K. ‚Äî DO NOT WAIT!' It's certainly my fault I'm here now! ... Man, I can't believe it. ... I really feel like a klutz! Now I know why nobody's shown up from that incident.\\" Afterward, McCunn discovered a small cache of supplies, including rabbit snares and a few bits of candles, while digging a shallow trench to prepare for winter. A State Trooper who had spoken with McCunn before his trip and helped him mark his campsite on a map stated that he was aware of a hunting cabin located from his campsite. It is unclear why McCunn did not use it when the weather began getting colder. Eventually snow began falling and the lake froze. Game became increasingly scarce, and McCunn set snares for rabbits, but the traps were frequently raided by wolves and foxes. By November, McCunn had run out of food. He considered trying to walk to Fort Yukon, approximately away, but was unable to make the trek due to snow and his weakened condition. By Thanksgiving (November 26) he wrote of having dizzy spells and almost constant chills. Death Sometime soon afterward, McCunn decided to end his own life. He used all his remaining fuel supplies to create a warm fire. He wrote, \\"Dear God in Heaven, please forgive me my weakness and my sins. Please look over my family.\\" He wrote a letter to his father instructing him how to develop his film. He also requested that all his personal belongings be given to his father by whoever found him. McCunn even suggested that the person who found him take his rifle and shotgun for their trouble. He then pinned his Alaska driver's license to the note and shot himself with his rifle. Just before his suicide he wrote in his diary: \\"They say it doesn't hurt.\\" By January, McCunn's friends became concerned enough to request the authorities begin a search for him. On February 2, 1982, a ski-equipped plane carrying several State Troopers landed at the lake to check McCunn's campsite. They found his tent zipped shut and, upon cutting it open, discovered his corpse, emaciated and frozen, along with his 100-page diary. Excerpts from McCunn's diary were published in December 1982 by The San Antonio Light.

Airing a News/Talk radio format, WBAL broadcasts on a Class A clear-channel frequency, with 50,000 watts from a transmitter facility in Randallstown, Maryland. Listeners in and around Baltimore can also hear the station on FM translator station W268BA at 101.5 MHz. The station shares its studios and offices with sister stations WBAL-TV (channel 11) and WIYY (97.9 FM) on Television Hill in Baltimore's Woodberry neighborhood. WBAL and WIYY are the only two radio stations owned by Hearst, which is primarily a publishing and television company, also co-owned with the television station; they are also part of a triopoly. WBAL is non-directional by day but uses a directional antenna at night to protect the other Class A stations on 1090 AM, KAAY in Little Rock and XEPRS in Rosarito, Mexico. With a good radio, WBAL's nighttime signal can be heard in much of Eastern North America, reaching as far as Finland, Sweden, Nova Scotia and Bermuda. Its daytime signal easily covers most of Maryland as well as the Washington metropolitan area, and parts of Delaware, Virginia and Pennsylvania. Programming On weekdays, WBAL airs 9 hours of all-news blocks, some of them simulcast from co-owned WBAL-TV. During middays, two local talk shows are heard, Clarence M. Mitchell, IV (known as \\"C4\\") and Brent Hollander. Evenings often feature sports programming. And overnights, the nationally syndicated Lars Larson Show is heard. Weekends include local shows and syndicated programs, including Dana Loesch, Brian Kilmeade, Meet The Press, This Week from ABC and Bill Cunningham. Some weekend hours are paid brokered programming. WBAL carries national news from ABC News. =Sports= WBAL is the co-flagship station with WIYY for Baltimore Ravens football and United States Naval Academy college football. Since the Baltimore Orioles began their inaugural season in 1954, WBAL was their flagship station for most of that team's history, though not continuously. For example, it carried Orioles games every season from 1987 to 2006, after which the team's games were broadcast on crosstown rival WJZ-FM. Orioles games returned to WBAL from 2011 to 2014 before the team switched back to WJZ-FM in 2015. Ravens games have been broadcast on WBAL and WIYY since the 2006 season. Other teams whose games have been broadcast on WBAL include the Baltimore Colts, the University of Maryland Terrapins and the Towson Tigers. History The WBAL Building, on Television Hill in Baltimore, has housed WBAL Radio since 1962. WBAL began broadcasting after being dedicated on November 2, 1925, as a subsidiary of the Consolidated Gas Electric Light and Power Company, a predecessor of Constellation Energy. WBAL's initial broadcasting studio was located at the utility's offices on Lexington Street. It was an affiliate of the NBC Blue Network. On January 12, 1935, with radio becoming more commercialized, there was little justification for a public service company to own a radio station. WBAL was sold to the Hearst-controlled American Radio News Corporation, which operated it along with two daily newspapers, The Baltimore News-Post and The Baltimore American (later merged as the Baltimore News-American). In the 1930s, WBAL became the flagship station for the international broadcast of radio evangelist G. E. Lowman, whose shows originated in Baltimore until 1959.O'Connor, Thomas H. Baltimore Broadcasting from A to Z (1985), p. 23. During the 1960s, WBAL had a full service Middle Of The Road music format stressing personality and news. The station played a mix of standards with some softer songs from the Top 40. Former logo of the radio station By the early 1970s, the station had a full-service adult contemporary music format with the exception of weekday evenings, where the station aired talk programming. Among its personalities during that period were program host Jay Grayson, Harley Brinsfield, who had a long-running Saturday night jazz music program, The Harley Show, and White House-accredited newsman Galen Fromme. In the early 1980s, WBAL began running talk shows evenings and overnights, and continued to play some music during the day. Music gradually decreased and in the fall of 1985, with WBAL transitioning to its current news-talk format, winning 19 national Edward R. Murrow Awards since then, the most of any local U.S. radio station. Since the mid-1990s, the station has become increasingly conservative, both in its on-air personalities and its editorial disposition. In 2010, WBAL switched its morning and afternoon drive time shows to an all-news format, titled Maryland's Morning News and Afternoon News Journal respectively. (The shows has since been renamed to Maryland's News Now and later to \\"WBAL News Now.\\") The all-news blocks include national newscasts from ABC News every 30 minutes. Previously, the national feed had been provided by CBS at the top of each hour until 2014. Also in 2014, the station was re-branded as WBAL News Radio 1090, to better reflect its status as Maryland's radio news leader. In addition to its analog 1090 kHz signal, WBAL is repeated on WIYY-HD2, a digital subchannel of WIYY's HD Radio signal.

The VR warehouses () were a group of redbrick railway warehouses designed by Bruno Granholm in the centre of Helsinki, Finland. They were used by the Finnish State Railways from their construction in 1899 until the 1980s. Their official address was Mannerheimintie 13. The warehouses were badly damaged in a fire on and were subsequently demolished. The Helsinki Music Centre was built on the site of the warehouses.  History  Due to the way Helsinki had developed with the placement of the Helsinki Central railway station in 1860, a large area of land in the centre of the city was bought for use as a railyard by the state railways in 1870. The oldest parts of the warehouses were designed by Bruno Granholm and built in 1898‚Äì1899, when they served as the cargo terminal for the Helsinki Central railway station. The warehouses were extended in 1908 and 1917, with the most recent additions being from the 1950s. They were used by the state railways as cargo warehouses until the 1980s, when they were abandoned and gradually fell into disrepair. The warehouses were without a permanent specific purpose but could be rented by anyone wishing to organize some sort of public event. During the 1900s, there had been numerous plans to integrate the area within the city plan, including master plans by architects Eliel Saarinen and Alvar Aalto, none of which were realised. A number of key public buildings ended up being built around the edge of the yards, including the Parliament House, the Finlandia Hall concert hall and the Kiasma Museum of Contemporary Art. As the state railways had decreasing need of the railway yard, it came to be regarded as a waste ground, and the City of Helsinki began to promote new uses for the site, and in 1985 held an architecture-city planning competition for the area. The results again proved inconclusive and the area was since developed piecemeal. In a stage II plan for an extension to Kiasma, American architect Steven Holl proposed a park-feature spreading directly north from his own building and cutting directly through the warehouses. The idea plan was never taken any further. The warehouses included a couple of ecological shops and band rehearsal studios. They were also a popular location for regular flea markets. Various music concerts, including the Tuska heavy metal festival in 1999 and 2000 and the Jyrki Video Awards in 2001‚Äì2003 were often held at the warehouses. In 2004 and 2005 they hosted Perv Park, Helsinki's biggest BDSM convention. By the mid-2000s, the warehouses had been under a threat of demolition for almost a decade to make way for a new Helsinki Music Centre concert hall. In early 2006, a decision was finally made to construct the Music Hall on the site, preserving only a small section of the warehouses for use as a pavilion-type cafe within the park surrounding the concert hall. = May 2006 fires = In the aftermath of the riots on , a group of young people decided to set up bonfires between the warehouses. The fire almost got to the warehouses, and when the fire department tried to put it out, they were attacked by a group of people. Riot police were dispatched to protect the firemen, and they also had stones thrown at them. On Friday , the older southern warehouse was badly damaged by a blazing fire. The building was totally gutted as the fire left just the brick walls standing. The fire drew in large crowds during a pleasant sunny evening. It was widely believed at first that the fire was a case of arson. However, police concluded in July 2006 that it had been accidental, caused either by a firework or a discarded cigarette that smouldered for several hours before suddenly breaking out across a large part of the building. Demolition The demolition work began as planned on with forensic examination still going on at the site. A small section at the end of the southern warehouse damaged by the fire was planned to be preserved and used as a pavilion-like cafe extension to the concert hall. This viewpoint was contrary, however, to many people's wishes to preserve the warehouses in their entirety due to their perceived historical and communal value. However, in August 2006, the Finnish police mistakenly ordered the demolition of the protected section.

It runs north from junction 24 of the M4 motorway at Newport in South Wales to Stafford in Staffordshire. The A449 on the outskirts of Newport. The southern section of the road, between Ross on Wye and Newport forms part of the trunk route from the English Midlands to South Wales, avoiding the Severn Bridge Route =Newport - Ross-on-Wye= The A449 starts on the M4 at the Coldra Interchange (J24) in Newport and is dual carriageway all the way to Raglan. The section from the A40 junction at Raglan to the A472 junction at Usk, known as the New Midlands Road, was one of the first sections to be dualled, opening on 16 October 1970. Between Raglan and Ross-on-Wye the A449 is concurrent with the A40. =Ross- on-Wye - Worcester= The road becomes quite twisty on departing Ross-on-Wye, but straightens out a little before arriving at Ledbury. The road turns northwards upon crossing into Worcestershire at Little Malvern and skirts the eastern slopes of the Malvern Hills through the town of Great Malvern. It then crosses Worcester's ring road, the A4440, at a roundabout near Powick. =Worcester - Wolverhampton= North of Worcester, a spur road of the same number heads towards the M5 Junction 6, while the main route continues towards Kidderminster, concurrent with the A442. Between Claines and Hartlebury the A449 is once again dual carriageway, but much tinkering has left the road with a single lane each way and speed restriction. The road becomes urban again while passing through Kidderminster. It then heads north into Staffordshire, passing between Kinver and Stourbridge and crossing the A458 at Stourton. The A491 meets it just north of Kingswinford. Continuing northwards, it passes Wombourne (becoming dual carriageway once more) before turning sharply north- east into the outskirts of Wolverhampton and meeting the Ring Road. =Wolverhampton - Stafford= The road resumes its journey northwards, passing Molineux Stadium (home of Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.) and leaving the city just south of Junction 2 of the M54. It originally ran through the centre of Wolverhampton until the 1970s, when all roads within the new ring road were declassified. Around the same time, the section of Waterloo Road on which Molineux Stadium stands was declassified and the A459 Upper Stafford Street and Lower Stafford Street became part of the A449. From there it forms part of the link between the M54 and the M6 North. It crosses the A5 at the Gailey Roundabout near the village of Gailey, a short distance west of M6 Junction 12, at which point it reverts to a single carriageway. It passes through Penkridge before crossing the M6 at Junction 13, reaching its terminus at its junction with the A34 in Stafford. Originally turnpiked under an Act of 1760, the Wolverhampton-Stafford road was part of the historic London- Liverpool coach route. Notoriously narrow in the 19th century, much of it was turned into dual carriageway between the world wars. The Gailey Roundabout was improved in 1929 and again in 1937, removing parts of the churchyard and the historic Spread Eagle Inn (although the latter was replaced by a new building). Widening at Penkridge between 1932 and 1934 reshaped the western part of the town, resulting in the demolition of many ancient buildings.Victoria County History: Staffordshire: Volume 5, chapter 16: Penkridge, s.1.

It is native to North Africa and the Sinai Peninsula, where it lives in sandy habitats. It is a common species, and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated its conservation status as being of \\"least concern\\". Description This is a small gerbil growing to a head-and-body length of about with a tail of about . The dorsal fur is soft and sleek and a sandy colour, each hair having a grey base and orangish shaft, and a dark tip in some individuals. The ears are large and densely furred and there are white rings around the large eyes and small white patches behind the ears. The flanks are paler than the back, with a white central part to the individual hairs. There is a white patch on the rump just above the tail, and the underparts are white and sharply delineated from the flanks. The feet are long and covered with white hairs of variable length. The tail is sandy above and white below, usually with a terminal white or grey tuft of hairs. 2n = 42. Distribution and habitat The lesser Egyptian gerbil is native to most of North Africa, its range extending from Morocco and Mauritania to Egypt, the Sinai Peninsula and southern Israel, and southward to northern Mali, northern Niger, northern Chad and Sudan. It prefers sandy locations and is found among dunes, in dune slacks with sparse vegetation, and in areas of wind-blown sand in wadis, palm groves and oases. They are seldom found in coastal habitats or in the middle of large dune fields, but are attracted to transient settlements and camel dung. Ecology This gerbil digs a complex burrow which can be in length and up to deep; this has branching passages and chambers for storing food and nesting materials. The humidity inside the burrow is high even when it is very low outside. This species is gregarious, and a number of individuals may share a burrow. These gerbils often live in close vicinity to the Anderson's gerbil, the Sundevall's jird, the greater Egyptian gerbil and the lesser Egyptian jerboa. The lesser Egyptian gerbil is nocturnal. Its diet includes seeds and fruits, sometimes supplemented by buds and leaves, and by insects in the spring. It consumes fallen dates and investigates camel dung in order to feed on any seeds it may find. It sometimes enters homes to search for food. It is active throughout the year, with breeding activity being related to the temperature and day length, and fecundity to food availability. Litters vary in size, with three to six young being normal, and population sizes vary considerably. Predators include the pale fox, the barn owl, and the sand viper. This gerbil shows a homing ability, with 50% of individuals displaced from their burrow by being able to find their way home, and 20% displaced by . Status This gerbil has a very wide range across North Africa. It is a common species with the population size varying from year to year but in the long term appearing to be stable. No particular threats have been identified, and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated its conservation status as being of \\"least concern\\".

Publication history Heimdall first appeared in a comic in Journey into Mystery #85 (October 1962) and was created by Stan Lee, Larry Lieber and Jack Kirby. Fictional character biography Heimdall is the brother of the warrior Sif.Thor: Son of Asgard #3 (June 2004) He is the all-seeing and all- hearing guardian sentry of Asgard who stands on the rainbow bridge Bifr√∂st to watch for any attacks to Asgard. He partly won the role through using his eyesight to see an army of giants several days' march from Asgard, allowing them to be defeated before they reached Asgard, and making their king a prisoner. For ages, he stood as the guardian of Asgard, defending the city's gates from any intruders, and was one of the most trusted servants of Odin. In his first appearance, Loki had been imprisoned in a tree until his plight caused someone to shed a tear. Heimdall accidentally freed him when Loki caused one of the leaves of the tree to poke him in the eye. Later Heimdall warned Odin of a threat he had perceived though he did not know exactly what manner of danger it was. Odin wove his own magic and found a Vanna, a wind sprite that was one of the few entities able to physically elude Heimdall. Odin praised Heimdall's courage for warning the others, even though he knew not what he was warning about and thus risking ridicule.Journey into Mystery #105 (June 1964) When next seen, he battled Thor to prevent him from entering Asgard;Journey into Mystery #110 (Nov. 1964) He then battled Thor to prevent him from leaving Asgard as Odin did not want him to see Jane Foster again.Journey into Mystery #125 (Feb. 1966) Heimdall was then immobilized by Seidring in a cuboid of ethereal force when Seidring stole the Odinforce.Thor #127 (Apr. 1966) Some time later, he encountered the Recorder during the attack of the superstrong monster Mangog.Thor #156 (Sept. 1968) Later still, Heimdall battled Thor at Loki's command.Thor #193 (Nov. 1971) In the prophecy of Ragnarok, he severed the Rainbow Bridge, and sounded Gjallarhorn.Thor #200 (June 1972) He traveled to Earth with Kamorr the dwarf to search for human candidates for godhood.Thor #201 (July 1972) He gathered three such human beings, and arranged for them to be exposed to Ego-Prime's energies and become the first three Young Gods.Thor #203 (Sept. 1972) Heimdall then accompanied the Asgardians into the Dark Nebula.Thor #214 (Aug. 1973) Heimdall later became afflicted by lethargy in one of Odin's absences from Asgard.Thor #240 (Oct. 1975) He then blew Gjallarhorn to summon Odin's elite guard.Thor #248 (June 1976) Some time later, he summoned Asgardian troops to restrain Thor.Thor #289 (Nov. 1979) Later, he battled Thor again to prevent him from bringing mortals into Asgard.Thor #322 (Aug. 1982) When Asgard was invaded by the fire demon Surtur, Heimdall attempted to defend the gates, but was overcome, and the Rainbow Bridge was shattered.Thor #351 (Jan. 1985) No longer needing to be stationary, Heimdall spent more time in Asgard. Heimdall is given the Great Scepter of Odin to guard by Loki.Thor #357 (July 1985) Heimdall discovered Malekith's escape.Thor #358 (Aug. 1985) He fetched Amora the Enchantress to help free Thor from ensorcelment.Thor #359 (Sept. 1985) Heimdall later learned of Loki's possession of Surtur's sword.Thor #364 (Feb. 1986) Heimdall became close to Amora, who was soon infatuated with him. He comforted Amora about the Executioner's death.Thor #376 (Feb. 1987) Heimdall rescued Balder from Seth's assassins.Thor #387 (Jan. 1988) Heimdall was gravely injured during the war with Seth, the Egyptian god of death, when he was struck down in battle with the legions of Seth.Thor #398 (Dec. 1988) Heimdall later battled Sif, Leir and Caber.Thor #418 (June 1990) Heimdall confronted Surtur disguised as Odin about the imprisoned Grand Vizier.Thor #420 (Aug. 1990) Heimdall led the legions of Asgard into battle against Ymir.Thor #423 (Sept. 1990) When Odin returned to Asgard after Surtur's defeat, he gave a portion of his power to Heimdall to restore the Rainbow Bridge, and Heimdall resumed his duties.Thor #426 (Nov. 1990) =Seemingly betrayed= Shortly afterwards, when Odin was about to enter his Odinsleep, he passed the Odinpower on to Heimdall to rule Asgard until he awoke. Heimdall had to deal with a major crisis in the life of Thor, as Thor had been banished into the subconscious of the mortal Eric Masterson, who had assumed Thor's responsibilities. Sif was determined to find the real Thor, and her determination drove a wedge between her and Heimdall. When Karnilla conspired with Loki to rule Asgard by having Odin awaken with Loki's soul possessing him, Heimdall was branded a traitor and banished to the Dream Dimension, ruled by the demon Nightmare. During this incident, his mind had been altered, leaving him little more than being able to follow directions. The Enchantress battles Nightmare in order to save him, ultimately rescuing them both. Eric Masterson helped restore Odin whose body had been taken over by Loki with Mephisto's help and later Thor as well from the soul shroud.Thor Vol. 1 430-440 (1991) =Loss and death= Heimdall and Amora drifted apart when Amora realized that his duty to Asgard was greater than his love for her. When Odin cast the Asgardians into the guises of mortals to protect them from a false Ragnarok, Heimdall became Donald Velez.Journey Into Mystery #506 (Feb. 1 1997) He joined the other \\"Lost Gods\\" in attempting to rediscover who they were and battling the Egyptian death-god Seth. Heimdall and the others regained their true forms and defeated Seth just as Asgard was attacked by the Dark Gods, and they were all taken prisoner. They were finally rescued by Thor. Around this time, Jason, a powerful member of the earth-based team the Pantheon, claims to have eluded Heimdall's senses during a trip through Asgard and over the Rainbow Bridge. Not many people trust Jason. An alternate reality version of Asgard featured the realm itself floating over the East Coast of America. This raises worship of Thor, who was the ruler and he utilizes Heimdall's senses to hear the prayers directed to him. This realm is eliminated from time when the future Thor realizes he has become a tyrant and merges with his past self. Asgard is struck by another Ragnarok, caused by Loki making weapons like Mjolnir for his army and enlisting the aid of Surtur, one from which there was no seeming reversal. Heimdall perishes in battle defending his people. Many Asgardians, Heimdall included, reform as Earthly beings. =Rebirth= After Thor ends the cycle of Ragnarok, Thor restores Asgard in Broxton, Oklahoma. Heimdall, along with the other Asgardians, are reborn on Earth in bodies of mortal beings, and he is the first Asgardian to be found. Thor locates Heimdall in New Orleans in the body of a man on a bridge and restores him to his Asgardian form. Upon his return to Asgard, Heimdall uses his near-omniscient power to locate the scattered souls of the other Asgardians with the notable exception of his sister Sif, due to Loki's interference.Thor vol. 3, #3-6 (Nov. 2007 - Feb. 2008) Heimdall is overcome by guilt when his supervision of all known worlds, including Earth, fails to spot the Fenris wolf savaging a small town in the state of Washington. Thor assures him that no Asgardian is perfect, and that furthermore he should assuage his guilt by performing his job better in the future.Warriors Three #2 (Jan. 2011) During the events of Siege, Heimdall is one of the first targets to be taken out by Norman Osborn and his forces. Loki transports his bedchamber beneath Asgard so he cannot warn them of the attack.Thor #607 (Apr. 2010) However Heimdall partially recovers, joins his comrades in battle and assists in defeating the invaders.Siege #2 (Apr. 2010) Heimdall's duties and status are touched upon in the 'Avengers Prime' miniseries which takes place in the days following 'Siege'. At the conclusion, he is entrusted with the 'Twilight Sword', a weapon that could destroy the known worlds.Avenger Prime #1-3 (2010-2011) =All-Mother= The rebuilding of Asgard comes with a new ruler, the All-Mother. She asks Heimdall to look into the future, where he sees unknown assassins attempting to kill her. He also manages to note something is wrong with the God of Thunder, Tanarus. This Thunder God severely injures Heimdall, leaving him unable to protect the All-Mother and warn others of the mystery of his attacker.The Mighty Thor Vol. 1 #10 (Jan. 25 2012) Odin returns, and yet another carries Mjolnir, Jane Foster. When Odin sends Cul to bring down Jane on Bifrost itself, Heimdall fights back, knowing this would end with him imprisoned, as the former All-Mother is now imprisoned under Odin's orders.The Mighty Thor #2 (2016) Powers and abilities Heimdall possesses the powers of a typical Asgardian, including superhuman strength, stamina, speed, agility and durability. However, he is generally stronger and more durable than all but a few Asgardians, such as Odin and Thor. Like all Asgardians his body is three times more dense and heavy than a human's, contributing partly to his superhuman strength and weight. Heimdall possesses extraordinarily acute superhuman senses, most notably his vision and hearing. His senses are said to be so acute that he could hear sap running through trees, and \\"the tiniest plant growing in the heart of the hidden hills\\", and see and hear anything occurring in Asgard or on Earth. Heimdall can also \\"look across time, as well as space\\", in one instance seeing the far-off approach of an invading party and correctly predicting that they were still a full two days away from Asgard; this ability to see what has yet to come is retained even after the establishment of the new Asgard on Earth. Heimdall has been said to be capable of detecting the fluttering of a butterfly's wings \\"a thousand worlds away\\". Heimdall is able to sense the life essences of Asgardian gods throughout the Nine Worlds of Asgard, and has the ability to focus on certain sensory information or block it out of his consciousness as he chooses, being so alert that he requires no sleep at all.Thor and Hercules: Encyclopedia Mythologica #1 According to Ares in his War Plan for the Siege of Asgard, Heimdall can \\"see and hear as far as creation\\", even capable of seeing the Dark Avengers at Avengers Tower from Broxton.Siege #1 (Mar. 2010) Certain magical spells can block his sensory powers. Additionally, his powers of sight are limited if even one of his eyes cannot see; apparently his eyes are capable of sustaining physical injury and require a long time to naturally heal, if ever. At least once, Heimdall has shown the ability to project an avatar (as an enlarged image of his face) to others from just outside Broxton to Manhattan, as he did with Thor, though he claims that he cannot maintain it for long, as his power has diminished with the fall of Asgard.Astonishing Thor #1 Heimdall also briefly possessed the Odinpower which granted him the ability to channel vast magical energies, for various purposes, such as repairing the shattered dimension-linking Rainbow Bridge. Heimdall is an experienced warrior and a fierce hand-to-hand combatant. He has proficiency and great experience with edged weapons and wields a variety of swords, shields and spears and he wears a suit of armor. Heimdall bore the Gjallerhorn (\\"Yelling Horn\\"), which he would sound to alert all of Asgard to dangers threatening the city's gates, functioning even on Midgard and capable of being heard by any and all Asgardians on the planet when sounded. While in the mortal form of Donald Velez he wore enchanted glasses which granted him super-enhanced vision. He possesses the golden-maned steed named Golltoppr (\\"Golden Top\\"). Heimdall is armed with an enchanted uru sword that has, on at least one occasion, allowed him to mystically disguise himself as a normal human while on Earth. It is said by Heimdall to contain \\"all the cosmic force of the universe\\"Journey into Mystery #101 (Feb. 1964) has also been shown capable of projecting \\"the blue flame from countless cosmic suns\\", used both times to battle Thor, and enabled Heimdall to directly best the Thunder God the first time when the latter's strength was halved. Heimdall has also at least once wielded the powerful Sabre of Sorcery, which projected blasts of mystic energy and/or fire, against the Hulk when the latter was invading Asgard, but was unable to prevent him from entering the Realm Eternal.Tales to Astonish #101 (Mar. 1968) Other versions =Earth X= In the alternate Earth X reality, the Asgardians were actually aliens that were manipulated by the Celestials into believing they were the Gods of Norse myth. When the lie was revealed, \\"Heimdall\\" and the other Asgardians briefly resumed their alien form, but later returned to their Asgardian forms.Earth X #12 (Apr. 2000) =Guardians of the Galaxy= In the Guardians of the Galaxy timeline, Heimdall is still alive and well in the 31st Century. He battled Starhawk and Aleta on the Bifrost Bridge.Guardians of the Galaxy #42 (Nov. 1993) =Thor: The Mighty Avenger= In Thor: The Mighty Avenger #6, Heimdall, much like his Marvel Universe incarnation, appears as the guard of the Bifrost bridge, sports a goatee and wears a horned helmet that casts his eyes in shadows. Heimdall is ordered by Odin to keep Thor from returning to Asgard. He is also revealed as the one who separated Thor from his hammer. When Heimdall threatens to send Jane Foster to some distant planet where Thor could never find her if he continues trying to force his way into Asgard, Thor ends his attempt.Thor: The Mighty Avenger #6 (Jan. 2011) =Ultimate Marvel= Heimdall first appeared in the Ultimate Marvel universe when he is confronted by Loki (disguised as Baron Zemo), who shot and killed him.

It is distributed mainly in Arabian Peninsula to southwestern Iran. It has orange-brown fur, white underparts, large eyes and a very long tail. Taxonomy Cheesman's gerbil was first described by the British zoologist Oldfield Thomas in 1919. It was named in honour of its discoverer, the British military officer, explorer and ornithologist Robert Ernest Cheesman who collected it while on an exploratory expedition in Saudi Arabia. Description This gerbil is similar in appearance to the lesser Egyptian gerbil (Gerbillus gerbillus) and Anderson's gerbil (Gerbillus andersoni). It has a head-and-body length of between and a tail of between , and like them, the soles of the feet are hairy. The dorsal pelage is orange-brown and the underparts are white. Distribution and habitat Cheesman's gerbil is native to the Arabian Peninsula and the Middle East. Its range includes Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Oman, Yemen, Kuwait, Iraq, Iran, Syria and Jordan. Its natural habitat is arid plains with sandy soils, deserts and sabkha, flat coastal salt pans. it is often found in areas in which Haloxylon, Calligonum, Ephedra alata and Artemisia grow. Ecology This is a nocturnal species, spending the heat of the day in a burrow and emerging at night to forage for seeds and grasses, although it may become omnivorous in some circumstances. The hair on the soles of the feet is one adaptation it has for running across sand, and it can also make long leaps. By feeding at night it is able to make use of the dew on plants and it can conserve moisture by producing dry faeces and very little urine. It carries damp vegetation to its burrow which raises the humidity level inside. The burrow entrance is often at the base of a shrubby plant, and the gerbil closes the entrance when it enters by flicking sand across with its tail. It is preyed on by predators such as owls, the Arabian red fox and R√ºppell's fox. Status G. cheesmani is a common species, has a wide range and is presumed to have a large total population. The population trend seems to be stable and no particular threats to the animal have been identified. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed its conservation status as being of \\"least concern\\".

The mosque is also important in Islam because of its historical and eschatological reports and events associated with the mosque. After the Muslim conquest of Damascus in 634, the mosque was built on the site of a Christian basilica dedicated to John the Baptist, honored as a prophet by Christians and Muslims. A legend dating to the sixth century holds that the building contains the head of John the Baptist.Burns, 2005, p .88. Two shrines commemorating Husayn ibn Ali (), whose martyrdom is frequently compared to that of John the Baptist and Jesus Christ, exist within the building premises. The mosque is also believed by Muslims to be the place where Jesus will return at the End of Days. The mausoleum containing the tomb of Saladin stands in a small garden adjoining the north wall of the mosque. History =Pre-Islamic period= The site is attested for as a place of worship since the Iron Age. Damascus was the capital of the Aramaean state Aram-Damascus and a large temple dedicated to the cult of Hadad-Ramman, the god of thunderstorms and rain, was erected at the site of the present-day Umayyad Mosque. One stone remains from the Aramaean temple, dated to the rule of King Hazael, and is currently on display in the National Museum of Damascus.Burns, 2005, p. 16. The Temple of Hadad-Ramman continued to serve a central role in the city, and when the Roman Empire conquered Damascus in 64 BCE, they assimilated Hadad with their own god of thunder, Jupiter.Burns, 2005, p. 40. Thus, they engaged in a project to reconfigure and expand the temple under the direction of Damascus-born architect Apollodorus, who created and executed the new design.Calcani and Abdulkarim, 2003, p. 28. This new Temple of Jupiter, Damascus became the center of the Imperial cult of Jupiter and was served as a response to the Second Temple in Jerusalem.Burns, 2005, p. 65. The Temple of Jupiter would attain further additions during the early period of Roman rule of the city, mostly initiated by high priests who collected contributions from the wealthy citizens of Damascus.Burns, 2005, p. 62. The eastern gateway of the courtyard was expanded during the reign of Septimius Severus (r. 193‚Äì211 CE).Burns, 2005, p. 72. By the fourth century CE, the temple was especially renowned for its size and beauty. It was separated from the city by two sets of walls. The first, wider wall spanned a wide area that included a market, and the second wall surrounded the actual sanctuary of Jupiter. It was the largest temple in Roman Syria.Bowersock and Brown, 2001, pp. 47-48. Towards the end of the 4th century, in 391, the Temple of Jupiter was converted into a cathedral by the Christian emperor Theodosius I (r. 379‚Äì395). During its transformation into a Christian cathedral, it was not immediately dedicated to John the Baptist; this was a later association, which came about in the sixth century. Legend had it that Saint John's head was buried there. It served as the seat of the Bishop of Damascus, who ranked second within the Patriarchate of Antioch after the patriarch himself.Darke, 2010, p. 72. =Establishment and Construction= The Umayyad Mosque at night Damascus was captured by Muslim Arab forces led by Khalid ibn al-Walid in 634. In 661, the Islamic Caliphate came under the rule of the Umayyad dynasty, which chose Damascus to be the administrative capital of the Muslim world. The sixth Umayyad caliph, al-Walid I (r. 705‚Äì715), commissioned the construction of a mosque on the site of the Byzantine cathedral in 706.Grafman and Rosen-Ayalon, 1999, p. 7. Prior to this, the cathedral was still in use by the local Christians, but a prayer room (musalla) for Muslims had been constructed on the southeastern part of the building. Al-Walid, who personally supervised the project, had most of the cathedral, including the musalla, demolished. The construction of the mosque completely altered the layout of the building. While the church (and the temples before it) had the main building located at the centre of the rectangular enclosure, the mosque's prayer hall is placed against its south wall. The architect recycled the columns and arcades of the church, dismantling and repositioning them in the new structure. The new house of worship was meant to serve as a large congregational mosque for the citizens of Damascus and as a tribute to the city. In response to Christian protest at the move, al-Walid ordered all the other confiscated churches in the city to be returned to the Christians as compensation. The mosque was completed in 715, shortly after al-Walid's death, by his successor, Sulayman ibn Abd al- Malik (r. 715‚Äì717).Rudolff, 2006, p. 177. According to 10th-century Persian historian Ibn al-Faqih, somewhere between 600,000 and 1,000,000 dinars were spent on the project. Coptic craftsmen as well as Persian, Indian, Greek and Moroccan laborers provided the bulk of the labor force which consisted of 12,000 people.Flood, 2001, p. 2.Wolff, 2007, p. 57. Byzantine artisans were employed to create the mosaics, still visible, which depict landscapes and buildings in a characteristic late Roman style.Rosenwein, Barbara H. A short history of the Middle Ages. University of Toronto Press, 2014. p. 56Kleiner, Fred. Gardner's Art through the Ages, Vol. I Cengage Learning, 2013. p. 264 Ibn al-Faqih relays the story that during the construction of the mosque, workers found a cave-chapel which had a box containing the head of St. John the Baptist, or Ya·∏•yƒÅ ibn Zakarƒ´yƒÅ in Islam. Upon learning of that and examining it, al-Walid I ordered the head buried under a specific pillar in the mosque that was later inlaid with marble.le Strange, 1890, pp. p. 233‚Äìp. 234 The Dome of the Clock was built in 780 =Abbasid and Fatimid era= Following the uprising that ended Umayyad rule in 750, the Abbasid dynasty came to power and moved the capital of the Caliphate to Baghdad. Apart from the attention given for strategic and commercial purposes, the Abbasids had no interest in Damascus. Thus, the Umayyad Mosque reportedly suffered under their rule, with little recorded building activity between the 8th and 10th centuries. However, the Abbasids did consider the mosque to be a major symbol of Islam's triumph, and thus it was spared the systematic eradication of the Umayyad legacy in the city. The Abbasid governor of Damascus, al-Fadl ibn Salih ibn Ali, built the so-called Dome of the Clock in the eastern section of the mosque in 780.Rudolff, 2006, p.178. Nine years later, he initiated the construction of the Dome of the Treasury with the purpose of housing the mosque's funds.Burns, 2005, pp.131‚Äì132. The 9th-century Arab geographer, al- Muqaddasi, credited the Abbasids for building the northern minaret (Madhanat al-'Arous; \\"Minaret of the Bride\\") of the mosque in 831 during the reign of the caliph al-Ma'mun (r. 813‚Äì833). This was accompanied by al-Ma'mun's removal and replacement of Umayyad inscriptions in the mosque.Flood, 2001, pp.124‚Äì126. Some information used in the article is provided by the footnotes of this source. The Dome of the Treasury was built in 789 By the early 10th century, a monumental clock had been installed by the entrance in the western part of the southern wall of the mosque (BƒÅb al-ZiyƒÅda.) This clock seems to have stopped functioning by the middle of the 12th century.Flood, 2001, p. 121. Abbasid rule over Syria began crumbling during the early 10th century, and in the decades that followed, it came under the control of autonomous realms who were only nominally under Abbasid authority. The Fatimids of Egypt, who adhered to Shia Islam, conquered Damascus in 970, but few recorded improvements of the mosque were undertaken by the new rulers. The Umayyad Mosque's prestige allowed the residents of Damascus to establish the city as a center for Sunni intellectualism, enabling them to maintain relative independence from Fatimid religious authority.Burns, 2005, p. 139. In 1069, large sections of the mosque, particularly the northern wall, were destroyed in a fire as a result of an uprising by the city's residents against the Fatimid's Berber army who were garrisoned there.Burns, 2005, p. 140. =Seljuk and Ayyubid era= The Sunni Muslim Seljuk Turks gained control of the city in 1078 and restored the nominal rule of the Abbasid Caliphate. The Seljuk king Tutush (r. 1079‚Äì1095) initiated the repair of damage caused by the 1069 fire. In 1082, his vizier, Abu Nasr Ahmad ibn Fadl, had the central dome restored in a more spectacular form;Flood, 1997, p. 73. the two piers supporting it were reinforced and the original Umayyad mosaics of the northern inner fa√ßade were renewed. The northern riwaq (\\"portico\\") was rebuilt in 1089.Burns, 2005, pp. 141‚Äì142. The Seljuk atabeg of Damascus, Toghtekin (r. 1104‚Äì1128), repaired the northern wall in 1110 and two inscribed panels located above its doorways were dedicated to him.Burns, 2005, pp. 148‚Äì149 In 1113, the Seljuk atabeg of Mosul, Sharaf al-Din Mawdud (r. 1109‚Äì1113), was assassinated in the Umayyad Mosque.Burns, 2005, p.147. As the conflict between Damascus and the Crusaders intensified in the mid-12th century, the mosque was used as a principal rallying point calling on Muslims to defend the city and return Jerusalem to Muslim hands. Prominent imams, including Ibn 'Asakir, preached a spiritual struggle jihad (\\" in Arabic the word means struggle/Strive\\") and when the Crusaders advanced towards Damascus in 1148, the city's residents heeded their calls; the Crusader army withdrew as a result of their resistance.Burns, 2005, p. 157. During the reign of Nur ad-Din Zangi, which began in 1154, a second monumental clock, the Jayrun Water Clock, was built on his personal orders.Flood, 2001, p. 114. It was constructed outside the eastern entrance to the mosque (Bab Jayrun) by architect Muhammad al-Sa'ƒÅti, was rebuilt by al- Sa'ati following a fire in 1167 and was eventually repaired by his son, Ridwan, in the early 13th century. It may have survived into the 14th century.Flood, 2001, pp. 117‚Äì118. The Arab geographer al-Idrisi visited the mosque in 1154. Damascus witnessed the establishment of several religious institutions under the Ayyubids, but the Umayyad Mosque retained its place as the center of religious life in the city. Muslim traveler Ibn Jubayr described the mosque as containing many different zawaya for religious and Quranic studies. In 1173, the northern wall of the mosque was damaged again by fire and was rebuilt by the Ayyubid sultan, Saladin (r. 1174‚Äì1193), along with the Minaret of the Bride,Burns, 2005, pp. 176‚Äì177 which had been destroyed in the 1069 fire. During the internal feuds between later Ayyubid princes, the city was dealt a great deal of damage, and the mosque's eastern minaret‚Äîknown as the \\"Minaret of Jesus\\"‚Äîwas destroyed at the hands of as-Salih Ayyub while besieging as-Salih Ismail in 1245.Burns, 2005, p. 187 The minaret was later rebuilt with little decoration.Burns, 2005, p. 189 Saladin, along with many of his successors, were buried around the Umayyad Mosque.Burns, 2005, p. 190 =Mamluk rule= The Minaret of Qaitbay was constructed in 1488 on the orders of Mamluk sultan Qaitbay The Mongols, under the leadership of Kitbuqa, in alliance with Crusader forces, captured Damascus from the Ayyubids in 1260. Bohemond VI of Antioch, a leading general in the invasion, ordered Catholic Mass to be performed in the Umayyad Mosque.Zaimeche, 2005, p. 22. However, the Mamluks, led by Qutuz and Baibars, wrested control of the city later in the same year. In 1270, Baibars, by now the Mamluk sultan, ordered extensive restorations to the mosque, particularly its marble, mosaics and gildings. According to Baibars' biographer, Ibn Shaddad, the restorations cost the sultan a sum of 20,000 dinars. Among the largest mosaic fragments restored was a segment in the western portico called the \\"Barada panel\\".Walker, 2004, p. 36-37. The mosaics that decorated the mosque were a specific target of the restoration project and they had a major influence on Mamluk architecture in Syria and Egypt.Flood, 1997, p. 67. In 1285, the Muslim scholar Ibn Taymiyya started teaching Qur'an exegesis in the mosque. When the Il-Khan Mongols under Ghazan invaded the city in 1300, Ibn Taymiyya preached jihad, urging the citizens of Damascus to resist their occupation. The Mamluks under Qalawun drove out the Mongols later that year.Zaimeche, 2005, p. 17. When Qalawun's forces entered the city, the Mongols attempted to station several catapults in the Umayyad Mosque because the Mamluks had started fires around the citadel to prevent Mongol access to it. The attempt failed as the Mamluks proceeded to burn the catapults before they were placed in the mosque.Winter and Levanoni, 2004, p. 33. The Mamluk Viceroy of Syria, Tankiz, carried out restoration work in the mosque in 1326‚Äì28. He reassembled the mosaics on the qibla wall and replaced all the marble tiles in the prayer hall. Mamluk sultan al-Nasir Muhammad also undertook major restoration work for the mosque in 1328. He demolished and completely rebuilt the unstable qibla wall and moved the Bab al-Ziyadah gate to the east. Much of that work was damaged during a fire that burned the mosque in 1339. Islamic art expert, Finbarr B. Flood, describes the Bahri Mamluks' attitude towards the mosque as an \\"obsessive interest\\" and their efforts at maintaining, repairing and restoring the mosque were unparalleled in any other period of Muslim rule.Flood, 1997, p. 72. Arab astronomer Ibn al-Shatir worked as the chief muwaqqit (\\"religious timekeeper\\") and the chief muezzin at the Umayyad Mosque from 1332 until his death in 1376.Charette, 2003, p. 16. He erected a large sundial on the mosque's northern minaret in 1371, now lost, more recently a replica was installed in its place.Selin, 1997, p. 413. The Minaret of Jesus was burnt down in a fire in 1392.Brinner, 1963, p. 155. Timur besieged Damascus in 1400. He ordered the burning of the city on March 17, 1401, and the fire ravaged the Umayyad Mosque. The eastern minaret was reduced to rubble, and the central dome collapsed.Ibn Khaldun; Fischel, 1952, p. 97. A southwestern minaret was added to the mosque in 1488 during the reign of Mamluk sultan Qaitbay.Ring, Salkin, La Boda, p. 208. =Ottoman era= 1842 daguerreotype by Joseph-Philibert Girault de Prangey (the earliest photography of the site) Umayyad Mosque as depicted in the Book of Wonders, a late 14th century Arabic manuscript The Ottomans under Selim I conquered Damascus from the Mamluks in 1516. The first Friday prayer performed in Selim's name in the Umayyad Mosque was attended by the sultan himself.Van Leeuwen, p. 95.Finkel, p. 109. The Ottomans used an endowment system (waqf) for religious sites as a means to link the local population with the central authority. The waqf of the Umayyad Mosque was the largest in the city, employing 596 people. Supervisory and clerical positions were reserved for Ottoman officials while religious offices were held mostly by members of the local 'ulema.Kafescio«ßlu, 1999, p. 78. Although the awqaf (plural form of \\"waqf\\") were taxed, the waqf of the Umayyad Mosque was not.Van Leeuwen, p. 112. In 1518, the Ottoman governor of Damascus and supervisor of the mosque's waqf, Janbirdi al-Ghazali, had the mosque repaired and redecorated as part of his architectural reconstruction program for the city.Van Leeuwen, p. 141. Prominent Sufi scholar Abd al-Ghani al-Nabulsi taught regularly at the Umayyad Mosque starting in 1661.Dumper and Stanley, p. 123. The mosque's extensive mosaics and its marble panelling were once again ravaged by fire in 1893, and had to be restored. The fire also destroyed the inner fabric of the prayer hall and caused the collapse of the mosque's central dome. A laborer engaging in repair work accidentally started the fire when he was smoking his nargila (water pipe). The Ottomans fully restored the mosque, but largely maintained the original structure.Darke, 2010, p. 90. Until 1899 the mosque's library included the \\"very old\\" Qubbat al-Khazna collection; \\"most of its holdings were given to the German emperor William II and only a few pieces kept for the National Archives in Damascus.\\" It is the burial place of first three martyrs of the Ottoman Aviation Squadrons, who were Navy Lieutenant (Ottoman Turkish: Bahriye Y√ºzba≈üƒ±sƒ±) Fethi Bey and his navigator, Artillery First Lieutenant (Ottoman Turkish: Top√ßu M√ºlazƒ±m-ƒ± Ula) Sadƒ±k Bey and The second team's member Artillery Second Lieutenant (Ottoman Turkish: Top√ßu M√ºlazƒ±m-ƒ± Saniye) Nuri Bey. These officers were on a mission of the Istanbul-Cairo expedition of 1914. =Modern era= 1862 photograph of the main prayer hall facade, from the courtyard looking south-east, with the Minaret of prophet Isa in the background The Umayyad Mosque underwent major restorations in 1929 during the French Mandate over Syria and in 1954 and 1963 under the Syrian Republic.Darke, 2010, p. 91. In the 1980s and in the early 1990s, Syrian president Hafez al-Assad ordered a wide-scale renovation of the mosque.Cooke, p. 12. The methods and concepts of al-Assad's restoration project were heavily criticized by UNESCO, but the general approach in Syria was that the mosque was more of a symbolic monument rather than a historical one and thus, its renovation could only enhance the mosque's symbolism.Rudolff, 2006, p. 194. In 2001 Pope John Paul II visited the mosque, primarily to visit the relics of John the Baptist. It was the first time a pope paid a visit to a mosque. On March 15, 2011, the first significant protests related to the Syrian civil war began at the Umayyad Mosque when 40‚Äì50 worshipers gathered outside the complex and chanted pro-democracy slogans. Syrian security forces swiftly quelled the protests and have since cordoned off the area during Friday prayers to prevent large-scale demonstrations.Protesters stage rare demo in Syria.

Architecture =Courtyard and sanctuary= Umayyad Mosque's Courtyard at night, view towards north-west with the Minaret of the Bride to the right. arabesques of tendrils, palmettes and half-palmettes in the Umayyad Mosque The ground plan of the Umayyad Mosque is rectangular in shape and measures by . A large courtyard occupies the northern part of the mosque complex, while the haram (\\"sanctuary\\") covers the southern part. The courtyard is enclosed by four exterior walls. The level of the stone pavement had become uneven over time due to several repairs throughout the mosque's history, but recent work on the courtyard has restored it to its consistent Umayyad-era levels. Arcades (riwaq) surround the courtyard supported by alternating stone columns and piers. There is one pier in between every two columns. Because the northern part of the courtyard had been destroyed in an earthquake in 1759, the arcade is not consistent; when the northern wall was rebuilt the columns that were supporting it were not.Umayyad Mosque Profile . Archnet Digital Library. Three arcades make up the interior space of the sanctuary. They are parallel to the direction of prayer which is towards Mecca in modern-day Saudi Arabia. The arcades are supported by two rows of stone Corinthian columns. Each of the arcades contain two levels. The first level consists of large semi-circular arches, while the second level is made up of double arches. This pattern is the same repeated by the arcades of the courtyard. The three interior arcades intersect in the center of the sanctuary with a larger, higher arcade that is perpendicular to the qibla (\\"direction of prayer\\") wall and faces the mihrab (niche in the wall which indicates the qibla) and the minbar (\\"pulpit\\"). The central transept divides the arcades into two halves each with eleven arches. The entire sanctuary measures by and takes up the southern half of the mosque complex.Grafman and Ayalon, 1999, p. 8. Four mihrabs line the sanctuary's rear wall, the main one being the Great Mihrab which is located roughly at the center of the wall. The Mihrab of the Companions of the Prophet (named after the Sahaba) is situated in the eastern half. According to ancient Muslim engineer Musa ibn Shakir, the latter mihrab was built during the mosque's initial construction and it became the third niche-formed mihrab in Islam's history. =Domes= There are three known domes inside the Umayyad Mosque complex. The largest dome of the mosque is known as the \\"Dome of the Eagle\\" (Qubbat an-Nisr) and located atop the center of the prayer hall. The original wooden dome was replaced by one built of stone following the 1893 fire. It receives its name because it is thought to resemble an eagle, with the dome itself being the eagle's head while the eastern and western flanks of the prayer hall represent the wings.Darke, 2010, p. 94. With a height of , the dome rests on an octagonal substructure with two arched windows on each of its sides. It is supported by the central interior arcade and has openings along its parameter. =Minarets= Within the Umayyad Mosque complex are three minarets. The Minaret of Jesus (Madhanat Isa) on south-east corner, second on the south-western corner is the \\"Minaret of Qaitbay\\" (Madhanat al-Gharbiyya) and the third, the Minaret of the Bride (Madhanat al-Arus), is located along the northern wall.  Minaret of the Bride  The Minaret of the Bride was the first minaret built for the mosque The Minaret of the Bride (Madhanat al-Arus) was the first one built and is located on the mosque's northern wall. The exact year of the minaret's original construction is unknown. The bottom part of the minaret most likely dates back to the Abbasid era in the 9th century.Darke, 2010, p. 92. While it is possible that the Umayyads built it, there is no indication that a minaret on the northern wall was a part of Caliph al-Walid's initial concept. Geographer al-Muqaddasi visited the minaret in 985 when Damascus was under Abbasid control and described it as \\"recently built.\\" The upper segment was constructed in 1174. This minaret is used by the muezzin for the call to prayer (adhan) and there is a spiral staircase of 160 stone steps that lead to the muezzin's calling position.American architect and architecture, 1894, p. 58. The Minaret of the Bride is divided into two sections; the main tower and the spire which are separated by a lead roof. The oldest part of the minaret, or the main tower, is square in shape, has four galleries, and consists of two different forms of masonry; the base consists of large blocks, while the upper section is built of dressed stone. There are two light openings near the top of the main tower, before the roof, with horseshoe arches and cubical capitals enclosed in a single arch. A smaller arched corbel is located below these openings.Rivoira, 1918, p. 92. According to local legend, the minaret is named after the daughter of the merchant who provided the lead for the minaret's roof who was married to Syria's ruler at the time. Attached to the Minaret of the Bride is the 18th-century replica of the 14th-century sundial built by Ibn al-Shatir.Darke, 2010, p. 92.  Minaret of Isa  The Minaret of Jesus ('Isa) is the mosque's tallest minaret The Minaret of Jesus (Arabic: ŸÖÿ¶ÿ∞ŸÜÿ© ÿπŸäÿ≥Ÿâ, Mi'dhanah ‚Ä≤Isa), located on the southeast corner of the mosque complex, is around in height and the tallest of the three minarets.Palestine Exploration Fund, p. 292. Some sources claim it was originally built by the Abbasids in the 9th century,Darke, 2010, p. 92. while other sources attribute the original structure to the Umayyads. The main body of the current minaret was built by the Ayyubids in 1247, but the upper section was constructed by the Ottomans. The main body of the minaret is square-shaped and the spire is octagonal. It tapers to a point and is surmounted by a crescent (as are the other two minarets.) Two covered galleries are situated in the main body and two open galleries are located on the spire. Islamic belief holds that Jesus will descend from heaven before the Day of Judgement to confront the Antichrist. According to local Damascene tradition, relating from Hadith of Muhammad about the Qiyamah, he will reach earth via the Minaret of Jesus, hence its name. Ibn Kathir, a prominent 14th-century Muslim scholar, backed this notion.Kamal al-Din, 2002, p. 102.  Minaret of Qaitbay  The Western Minaret (Arabic: ŸÖÿ¶ÿ∞ŸÜÿ© ÿßŸÑÿ∫ÿ±ÿ®ŸäŸëÿ©, Mi'dhanatu 'l-Gharbiyyah) is also known as the \\"Minaret of Qaitbay\\" as it was built by Mamluk sultan Qaitbay in 1488.Darke, 2010, p. 92. The Western Minaret displays strong Islamic-era Egyptian architectural influence typical of the Mamluk period.Mannheim, 2001, p. 91. The minaret is octagonal in shape and is built in receding sections with three galleries. It is generally believed that both the Minaret of Jesus and the Western Minaret were built on the foundation of Ancient Roman towers (temenos), but some scholars find this to be questionable because of the absence of corner towers in other former Roman temples. =Influence on mosque architecture= The Umayyad Mosque is one of the few early mosques in the world to have maintained the same general structure and architectural features since its initial construction in the early 8th century and its Umayyad character has not been significantly altered. Since its establishment, the mosque has served as a model for congregational mosque architecture in Syria as well as globally. According to art historian, Finnbar Barry Flood, \\"the construction of the Damascus mosque not only irrevocably altered the urban landscape of the city, inscribing upon it a permanent affirmation of Muslim hegemony, but by giving the Syrian congregational mosque its definitive form it also transformed the subsequent history of the mosque in general.\\"Rudolff, 2006, p. 214. Examples of the Umayyad Mosque's ground plan being used as a prototype for other mosques in the region include the al-Azhar Mosque and Baybars Mosque in Cairo, the Great Mosque of Cordoba in Spain, and the Bursa Grand Mosque and Selimiye Mosque in Turkey.Rudolff, 2006, pp. 214-215. Religious significance The Umayyad Mosque holds great significance to Shia and Sunni Muslims, as this was the destination of the ladies and children of the family of Muhammad, made to walk here from Iraq, following the Battle of Karbala. Furthermore, it was the place where they were imprisoned for 60 days. The following are structures found within the Mosque that bear great importance: West Side: * The entrance gate (known as \\"BƒÅb as-SƒÅ'at\\") -- The door marks the location where the prisoners of KarbalƒÅ were made to stand for 72 hours before being brought inside. During this time, Yazƒ´d I had the town and his palace decorated for their arrival., Shrine purportedly housing the head of Prophet Yahya (John the Baptist). South Wing (main hall): * Shrine of John the Baptist () -- According to Al-Suyuti, Ibrahim stated that since the creation of the worldTafseer Durre Manthur Vol.6, p. 30-31. the Heavens and the Earth wept only for two people: Yahya and Husayn ibn Ali, the grandson of MuhammadTafseer Ibn Katheer, vol.9, p. 163, published in Egypt. Tafseer Durre Manthur Vol.6, p. 30-31. * A white pulpit -- Marks the place where Ali ibn Husayn Zayn al-Abidin addressed the court of Yazƒ´d after being brought from KarbalƒÅ * Raised floor (in front of the pulpit) -- Marks the location where all the ladies and children (the household of Muhammad) were made to stand in the presence of Yazƒ´d * Wooden balcony (directly opposite the raised floor) ‚Äì Marks the location where Yazƒ´d sat in the court. East Wing: * A prayer rug and MihrƒÅb encased in a glass cubicle -- Marks the place where Ali ibn Husayn Zayn al-Abidin used to pray while imprisoned in the castle after the Battle of Karbala * A metallic, cuboidal indentation in the wall -- Marks the place where the head of Husayn ibn Ali was kept for display by Yazƒ´d * A Zarih -- Marks the place where all the other heads of those who fell in KarbalƒÅ were kept within the Mosque.

National bulletins are presented from Seven's high definition studios in Martin Place, Sydney, while flagship 6 pm bulletins are produced in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide, and Perth city based studios. The network also produces local news bulletins for regional Queensland and the Gold Coast. The news service is retransmitted via a number of regional affiliates, including Prime7, GWN7, Southern Cross Seven and WIN Television. It draws upon the resources of ITN, NBC, MediaWorks New Zealand, CBC, CNN, APTN and Reuters for select international coverage. The network's Director of News and Current Affairs is Craig McPherson.  History  Seven News Sydney have been presented from studios in Martin Place Seven News, previously known as ATVN News and Seven National News, is one of Australia's longest-running television news services, founded in 1958, along with Nine News on the rival Nine Network. In 2003, former Nine Network news and current affairs chief Peter Meakin was appointed to Seven News, tasked with lifting ratings in the struggling east coast markets by including more local content in those bulletins. Seven News has been the top rating news service nationally for all but three years since 2005, partly attributed to the success of television game show Deal or No Deal (and later The Chase Australia), which provided the flagship 6pm bulletin with a significant lead-in audience. In recent years, under the guidance of former longtime National Nine News chief Peter Meakin, Seven's news and current affairs division has produced more locally focused content, which has been lifting ratings for key markets such as Sydney and Melbourne. Since February 2005, the ratings of Deal or No Deal, Seven News and Today Tonight have gradually increased. Seven News was the highest-rating news service nationally in both the 2005 and 2006 ratings seasons. A key aspect of Seven's recent ratings dominance in news and current affairs has been attributed to Deal or No Deal's (and, since late 2015, The Chase Australia) top rating audience, which provides Seven News with a large lead-in audience. Between 2007 and 2010 inclusive, Seven News completed a clean sweep across the five capital cities in terms of being the most watched 6 pm news bulletin. On 5 July 2008, Channel Seven introduced a watermark on news and current affairs programmes. In 2007, Seven News beat National Nine News and 10 News First in ratings for the first time in the Melbourne market. During the year, they ranked highest twenty weeks compared to Nine's nineteen weeks, while one week was tied. Previously, in 2006, Seven had ranked on top 16 weeks in while Nine had 24 weeks on top in Melbourne. During 2008, from weeknight to weeknight, Seven and Nine had similar ratings, often changing the most popular show from night to night. As of 2013, Nine News retains a national lead, although Seven still has a tight grip on the Adelaide and Perth bulletins. In November 2012, Peter Meakin resigned as director of news and current affairs of the Seven Network after nine years in the role, with Rob Raschke named as his successor. In October 2013, it was announced that the Saturday 6pm bulletins would be extended to one hour, likely as a reaction to Nine News regaining its national lead in 2013.Seven, Nine extend Saturday News bulletins, TV Tonight, 13 October 2013 On Monday 20 January 2014, the news theme was overhauled with the traditional The Mission piece removed after two decades,New theme for Seven News, TV Tonight, 21 January 2014 however, due to viewer backlash, The Mission was reinstated on Friday 24 January 2014.Seven News backflip as new theme is dumped, TV Tonight, 25 January 2014 In February 2014, Today Tonight was axed in the Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane markets and the news bulletins were extended to one hour.

However, Seven News soon reclaimed the lead nationally the following year, aided by the new game show lead-in The Chase Australia, which helped to increase numbers in Sydney and Melbourne, as well as a narrow 3,000 viewer loss to Nine in Brisbane. In July 2016, a new locally focused bulletin for the Gold Coast was introduced, airing at 5.30pm every evening from the network's Surfers Paradise studios.Seven News launches daily Gold Coast bulletins, Mediaweek, 20 June 2016 The debut bulletin won its timeslot with 49,000, compared to the rival Nine Gold Coast News which drew 34,000 viewers. However, Nine still remained ahead of Seven overall in the Gold Coast market until 2019, when that newscast finally emerged as the top newscast there.

On 2 April 2012, a 30-minute Perth edition was launched, airing as a cutaway half-hour bulletin at 4:30pm, following the first half-hour of the national bulletin at 4pm. Regional and Remote Western Australia did not receive the 4.30 afternoon news on GWN7; rather, the network substituted it with its own local news service at 5:30pm. In December 2012, the bulletin was renamed as Seven Afternoon News. In January 2013, the bulletin returned to an hour due to the axing of The Price Is Right and returned to the Melbourne studio with Rebecca Maddern replacing Samantha Armytage. However, in August 2013 Maddern was replaced by Melissa Doyle and Matt White and the bulletin expanded to start at 4 pm. In April 2014, Matt White resigned from the Seven Network to join Network Ten. The bulletin was presented solo by Melissa Doyle up until July 2015. In June 2015, the Seven Network announced senior presenter Chris Bath's resignation and that Melissa Doyle would take over as Seven News Sydney weekend presenter from July. The last incarnation of the national bulletin was broadcast from the network's Martin Place studios and was presented by Ann Sanders (Monday - Thursday) and Chris Reason (Friday). Sport was presented by Mel McLaughlin (Monday) and Jim Wilson (Tuesday - Friday) and weather was presented by David Brown (Monday - Thursday) and Amelia Mulcahy or Angie Asimus (Friday). The national edition simulcasted across New South Wales and Australian Capital Territory through Prime7, in Griffith through WIN Television's Seven Griffith, Tasmania through Seven Tasmania and South Australia through WIN Television SA and Seven GTS/BKN. Local bulletins Hour-long local afternoon bulletins were launched periodically in the capital cities, replacing the National bulletin in full. Melbourne and Brisbane launched local afternoon bulletins in August 2015. In July 2017, Adelaide launched their own local edition, while the half- hour Perth bulletin was extended to replace the national bulletin in full. Presently, Seven Afternoon News is aired at 4:00 pm on weekdays in four separate local editions: * The Sydney edition is broadcast from the network's Martin Place studios and is presented by Ann Sanders (Monday - Thursday) and Sally Bowrey (Friday). Sport is presented by Mel McLaughlin (Monday-Thursday) and Matt Shirvington (Friday) and weather is presented by David Brown (Monday - Thursday) and Angie Asimus (Friday). The local edition simulcasted across New South Wales and Australian Capital Territory through Prime7, and in Griffith through WIN Television's Seven Griffith. * The Melbourne edition is broadcast from the network's Docklands studios in Melbourne and is presented by Jacqueline Felgate (Monday and Friday) and Mike Amor (Tuesday - Thursday), with sport presented by Sean Sowerby (Monday-Thursday) and Andrew McCormack (Friday), and weather presented by meteorologist Jane Bunn (Monday-Thursday) and Melina Sarris (Fri). The local edition simulcasts across Victoria and New South Wales/South Australian border areas through Prime7 Victoria and Prime7 Mildura, as well as Tasmania through 7 Tasmania. * The state-based Queensland edition is broadcast from the network's Mount Coot-tha studios in Brisbane and is presented by Kendall Gilding. Shane Webcke presents sport (Monday - Wednesday) and Pat Welsh (Thursday - Friday) and Tony Auden presenting the weather (Monday to Thursday) and Paul Burt (Friday). Initially launched as a separate 90-minute bulletin in the South East Queensland region (Brisbane and surrounding areas received by BTQ transmitters), it is now simulcast across the state via Seven Queensland and across central and remote areas of eastern Australia on Southern Cross Central. It is also being aired in Darwin, Northern Territory through affiliate Southern Cross Television (TND-34), where it broadcasts live into all relevant time zones, thus ending the bulletin at 4:30pm in Darwin. On the Gold Coast, the bulletin ends at 4:30 pm, due to the launch of the Gold Coast service on 4 July. On 10 August 2017, two years to the day since the bulletin launched, the local service claimed victory in the 4:00 pm timeslot, winning 21 weeks to the rival Nine Live Queensland's two weeks. * The Perth edition is broadcast from the network's Osborne Park studios in Perth and is presented by Samantha Jolly from Monday to Thursday and Amelia Broun on Friday, who also present weather and sport is presented by Basil Zempilas. Unlike the former breakaway, the bulletin runs for a full hour. Regional WA affiliate GWN7, however, will end the bulletin at 4:30 pm to accommodate its local weeknight news service at 5:30 pm. On 26 June 2020, the local Adelaide afternoon news formerly presented by Rosanna Mangiarelli was axed due to budget cuts, with that market now receiving the Melbourne edition. Adelaide receive a local insert in the last segment of the bulletin, presented by a state based anchor, and a localised weather update with Amelia Mulcahy. =Nightly news= Sydney Seven News Sydney reporter Jessica Ridley reporting outside the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's Ultimo studios in Sydney, New South Wales. Seven News Sydney is presented by Mark Ferguson from Sunday to Thursday and Michael Usher on Friday and Saturday from the Martin Place studios. Sport is presented by Mel McLaughlin from Sunday to Thursday and Matt Shirvington on Friday and Saturday. Weather is presented by David Brown from Sunday to Thursday and Angie Asimus on Friday and Saturday. The Sydney bulletin is simulcast to the regional areas of New South Wales and Australian Capital Territory through Prime7 and to Griffith via WIN Television's Seven Griffith. After decades of trailing Nine News Sydney and 10 News First Sydney in the ratings, which led to the sackings of Ross Symonds and Ann Sanders as the weeknight presenters in 2003, Seven News Sydney's attempts to boost ratings began in December with the appointment of Ian Ross as main weeknight anchor and the relocation of the bulletin, and other national bulletins, to new street-level studios in Martin Place in August 2004, thus allowing bystanders to watch bulletins being broadcast live. After two years of presenting the national morning news, Chris Bath returned to her former role as weekend news presenter in 2006, swapping roles with Ann Sanders. Ross presented his final bulletin for Seven News Sydney on Friday 27 November 2009. Bath took over as main weeknight presenter from Monday 30 November 2009 while former Nine News presenter Mark Ferguson took over as weekend presenter on Saturday 28 November 2009.Chris Bath to replace Ian Ross at Seven News , ebroadcast.com.au, 9 November 2009 The bulletin retained its ratings lead until 2011, when it lost to the rival Nine News bulletin for the first time in seven years.Nine News Sydney takes ratings crown from Seven, Media Spy, 22 October 2011 In January 2014, Mark Ferguson was appointed weeknight presenter, replacing Chris Bath due to poor ratings. Bath became weekend presenter and continued to host Sunday Night until her resignation in July 2015,Mark Ferguson replaces Chris Bath at Seven News, TV Tonight, 27 January 2014 after which Melissa Doyle took over. More changes to Sydney's news presenting team in subsequent months saw former Melbourne weather presenter David Brown replace Sarah Cumming as the Sunday-Thursday weather presenter, Mel McLaughlin replace Jim Wilson as the Sunday-Thursday sports presenter and Wilson replace Ryan Phelan as the Friday-Saturday sports presenter. In August 2016, it was announced that Michael Usher would replace Melissa Doyle as Friday and Saturday presenter. Doyle moved into a new expanded role as senior correspondent and host of Sunday Night. In June 2020, Jim Wilson left Seven after 28 years with the network, to become a new host of 2GB‚Äôs Drive program. His last sports bulletin was 27 June 2020. It was later announced that Matt Shirvington will replace him. Fill-in presenters include Chris Reason, Angela Cox, Angie Asimus, Ann Sanders and Natalie Barr (News), Matt Carmichael (Sport), and Sally Bowrey (Weather). Late night news updates are usually presented by either Samantha Brett or Susannah Carr from Perth. Melbourne wrap livery outside Melbourne Town Hall. Seven News Melbourne is directed by Shaun Menegola and presented by Peter Mitchell from Sunday to Thursday and Mike Amor on Friday and Saturday from Broadcast Centre Melbourne. Sport is presented by Tim Watson from Sunday to Thursday and Jacqueline Felgate on Friday and Saturday. Weather is presented by Jane Bunn from Sunday to Thursday and Melina Sarris on Friday and Saturday. Peter Mitchell previously held the role of weekend presenter for Seven Nightly News between 1987 and 2000 when he replaced the short-lived presenting duo of David Johnston and Anne Fulwood. Jennifer Keyte was appointed as weeknight presenter in 1990, becoming Australia's first solo female primetime commercial news presenter. In a network reshuffle in 1996, Keyte terminated her employment after the Seven Network attempted to pair her with David Johnston, who went to present solo for three years. She returned in 2003, assuming the role as weekend presenter, succeeding Jennifer Adams. In May 2018, Network Ten announced that Jennifer Keyte would join the network to present Ten Eyewitness News Melbourne replacing Stephen Quartermain. In August 2018, it was announced that Mike Amor will move back to Australia after 17 years as United States Bureau Chief to replace Keyte. Following decades of coming third in television ratings to Nine News Melbourne and 10 News First Melbourne (previously Ten Eyewitness News, Ten News at Five, Ten Evening News and Ten News: First at Five), Seven News Melbourne went into a tight contest to win the ratings battle in 2005. Seven News overtook the rival Nine bulletin in the ratings in 2007. This was subsequently followed by a series of advertisements and promos which have touted Seven News Melbourne as Melbourne's New #1 and Nine altering their promotions to simply say Melbourne's Best News - a throwback to the 1980s when National Nine News Melbourne was being beaten in the ratings by ATV-10's Ten Eyewitness News. As of 2011, Seven has lost its ratings lead at 6 pm to 9 pm. During the AFL season, Peter Mitchell and the weeknight team present from Sunday to Thursday and Mike Amor and the weekend team present on Friday and Saturday. The bulletin is simulcast throughout regional Victoria and New South Wales/South Australia border areas that receive television services from Victoria through Prime7 (with the NSW Border receiving a trimmed down 30-minute version of the full-hour news on weeknights), and to viewers in Darwin, Northern Territory through Southern Cross Television (TND-34). During the AFL season, the Saturday edition of Seven News Melbourne airs for only 30 minutes to fit in with the Seven Network's Saturday night AFL coverage. Fill- in presenters include Jacqueline Felgate and Blake Johnson (News), Sean Sowerby, Tom Browne and Nathan Templeton (Sport) and Melina Sarris and Estelle Griepink (Weather). Brisbane Seven News Brisbane is directed by Ross Dagan and presented by Max Futcher and Sharyn Ghidella on weeknights and Katrina Blowers on weekends from Seven's Brisbane studios, located at Mount Coot-tha. Sport is presented by Shane Webcke from Sunday to Wednesday and Pat Welsh from Thursday to Saturday. Weather is presented by Tony Auden from Sunday to Thursday and Paul Burt on Friday and Saturday. The bulletin is also simulcast in Brisbane on local radio station 96.5 Family FM, and across central and remote areas of eastern Australia, on Southern Cross Central. Regional Queensland viewers in the Sunshine Coast, Wide Bay-Burnett, Toowoomba, Rockhampton, Mackay, Townsville and Cairns television markets receive a trimmed down 30-minute version of the newshour on weeknights via Seven Queensland, with a live simulcast on weekends. Previously, Tracey Challenor presented the weekend news for sixteen years until her resignation in February 2007. Cummins was first appointed to the weekday weather in 2005 after more than a year of the Brisbane bulletin not having a weather presenter; former kids show presenter Tony Johnston had this role in 2003. Cummins was replaced by former Nine weatherman John Schluter in early 2007 and she was moved to weekends. Ghidella joined Seven News in 2007 and replaced Challenor. In October 2002, Rod Young moved from ABC News in Brisbane to co- anchor with Kay McGrath. She had presented Seven News Brisbane solo for the previous nine months following the retirement of Frank Warrick. Following a couple of lean years coming third to Nine News Brisbane and Ten Eyewitness News Brisbane, Seven News Brisbane regained its ratings lead by 2007, helped by the recruitment of ex-Nine weatherman John Schluter, former Today news presenter Sharyn Ghidella and director of news Rob Raschke. In 2008, Seven News Brisbane was officially the #1 bulletin in Brisbane, winning all 40 ratings weeks. As of 2013, Seven has lost its ratings lead at 6 pm to 9 pm. In January 2013, Sharyn Ghidella and Bill McDonald were appointed Sunday to Thursday (later changed to weeknights) presenters with Kay McGrath and Rod Young moving to present on Friday and Saturday (later changed to weekends). It was also announced that Ghidella will present a local edition of Today Tonight, which was axed in January 2014 in favour of the bulletin's one hour extension. In June 2016, it was announced that Rod Young would leave Seven News Brisbane to present a new local bulletin for the Gold Coast. In March 2018, McDonald was removed as co-anchor of the bulletin, and was replaced by Max Futcher following poor ratings. In December 2019, Kay McGrath announced her retirement after 40 years in television and will present her final bulletin on 26 January. Katrina Blowers has been announced as her replacement. News updates for Brisbane are presented by Max Futcher or Sharyn Ghidella throughout the afternoon and the early evening. Kay McGrath, Katrina Blowers and Jillian Whiting are fill-in news presenters for the bulletin. Ben Davis and Rohan Welsh are fill-in sports presenters and Liz Cantor and Laura Dymock are the fill-in weather presenters. Adelaide Seven News Adelaide is directed by Chris Salter and presented by Jane Doyle on weeknights and Rosanna Mangiarelli on weekends from Seven's studios located at Hindmarsh. Sport is presented by Mark Soderstrom on weeknights and Bruce Abernethy on weekends. Weather is presented by Amelia Mulcahy on weeknights. The Adelaide bulletin is simulcast to the regional areas of South Australia on Southern Cross Television GTS/BKN in the Spencer Gulf region and Broken Hill in New South Wales, and through WIN South Australia in the Riverland and Mount Gambier/South East regions of the state. From 1989 to 2004 Graeme Goodings presented Seven News Adelaide on weeknights with Doyle until he was diagnosed with bowel cancer. Goodings and Riddell, the then weekend news presenter, agreed to swap roles, allowing for Goodings' rehabilitation. Goodings left Seven News Adelaide in December 2014, after 34 years reading Adelaide's news. Prior to 27 December 1987, the presenters and production crew of Seven News Adelaide produced Ten News Adelaide (then known as Ten Eyewitness News). However, as the television industry was consolidating in Australia, these news services had each become associated by ownership with inter-state news services being broadcast on opposite frequencies; therefore, to simplify network interaction, their respective networks agreed to swap channel assignments and network affiliations in Adelaide. In December 2007, production of Seven News moved from studios located at Gilberton to a new purpose-built space at Hindmarsh. During the AFL season, Seven News Adelaide does not air at the regular time on Saturday or Sunday if there is a twilight match involving Adelaide and/or Port Adelaide, in which case, a shortened edition is broadcast at half time, replacing analysis of the AFL matches broadcast, or a full bulletin is broadcast immediately after the game. In 2014, Seven News Adelaide won every single ratings weeknight against the rival Nine News Adelaide, but in 2015 started to lose some nights to Nine as Seven News as a whole suffered its worst ratings figures for over a decade. It clocked up 500 consecutive weekly ratings wins in March 2019, extending a streak which started in August 2006. In August 2019, Jane Doyle celebrated 30 years of reading the news on Seven. In November 2019, John Riddell announced his retirement and presented his last bulletin on 6 December. Doyle became solo presenter after Ridell's retirement. In June 2020, it was announced that Jessica Adamson and Tim Noonan were made redundant. The weekday 4pm bulletin was also retired with Melbourne‚Äôs bulletin broadcast to the Adelaide market. Rosanna Mangiarelli replaced Adamson on weekends. Fill-in presenters include Mike Smithson, Andrea Nicolas, Elspeth Hussey, and Mark Mooney (News), Theo Doropoulos and Andrew Hayes (Sport) and Gertie Spurling and Alana Smith-Fagan (Weather). News updates are presented by presenters or fill-in presenters. Seven remains South Australia‚Äôs No.1 Adelaide news service for more than a decade. Perth Seven News Perth is presented by Rick Ardon and Susannah Carr on weeknights and Angela Tsun and Tim McMillan on weekends from Seven and West Australian Newspaper studios located at Osborne Park. Sport is presented by Basil Zempilas from Monday to Friday and Adrian Barich or Ryan Daniels from Saturday to Sunday. Weather is presented by Samantha Jolly from Monday to Thursday and Amelia Broun on Friday. Seven News Perth is also simulcast on the GWN network to regional and remote areas of Western Australia and Curtin FM 100.1 in the Perth CBD area, but as of 2016, the simulcast on radio had a broadcasting break. Long standing Seven News Perth presenter Jeff Newman announced his retirement from television on 1 July 2009, and retired from his role on Monday 10 August 2009. He was replaced by former Nine News Perth weather presenter Natalia Cooper, who began her new role during September 2009. Cooper resigned from Seven Perth at the end of 2012 with ex-Nine weather presenter Angela Tsun taking over as her replacement for the 4:30 pm news and 6 pm weather forecasts. In 2015, Rick Ardon and Susannah Carr celebrated a thirty-year anniversary as a news reading duo. They are one of the longest serving dual news presenter teams in the world and the dual-presenter format used by Seven News Perth has been highly successful. In contrast to previous struggles seen in Sydney and Melbourne in the late 1990s, Seven News Perth has led in the ratings for decades, well ahead of 10 News First Perth and Nine News Perth by as many as 100,000 viewers. In February 2020, the Seven Network announced that Tim McMillan would join Angela Tsun to present on weekends. News updates for Perth are presented by Angela Tsun, Susannah Carr or Rick Ardon throughout the afternoon and by Susannah Carr or Rick Ardon in the early evening. Yvette Mooney was the weekend news presenter until she was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2007 and subsequently left the network in June 2008. Before the move to the Osborne Park Studios in Feb 2015, Blake Johnson and Samantha Jolly alternated fortnightly presenting for both Weekend bulletins. Fill-in presenters include Paula Voce, Samantha Jolly (News) and Chris Young (Sport). Regional bulletins =Regional Queensland= Local news bulletins for Regional Queensland are broadcast each weeknight at 6 pm, in all seven regional areas: Cairns, Townsville, Mackay, Wide Bay, Toowoomba, the Sunshine Coast, and Rockhampton. They are followed by a shortened 30-minute version of Seven News Brisbane. The bulletins are repeated on a half-hour delay on 7Two at 6.30 pm. The bulletins are presented by Rob Brough, with Joanne Desmond co- anchoring the Cairns, Townsville, Rockhampton and Toowoomba editions. Sport is presented by Nathan Spurling and weather is presented by Livio Regano. Fill-in presenters include Steve Titmus and Katie Toney (news), Luke McGarry (sport) and Rosanna Natoli (weather). Reporters and camera crews are based at newsrooms in each of the seven regions with studio presentation for the Cairns, Townsville, Mackay, Darling Downs, Rockhampton and Wide Bay bulletins pre-recorded at studios in Maroochydore. The Sunshine Coast edition of Seven News is broadcast live, but may also exchange it to any of the six pre- recorded regions at certain circumstances (e.g., cyclone coverage in the nearest region of immediate concern). News editing is undertaken by the local newsrooms, and sent to the main Maroochydore studios for transmission. The most successful edition of Seven Local News is broadcast on the Sunshine Coast. In early 1998, WIN Television launched a competing service publicly stating that it would beat Seven in the ratings within six months. At the end of the 1998 ratings season, after a new station head (Laurie Patton) had overseen a comprehensive re-vamping of the program and its external promotions, Seven Local News had actually increased its audience share by six ratings points. In early 2004, Seven Local News was re-introduced in the Townsville and Cairns sub-markets as a result of regulations regarding local content on regional television introduced by the Australian Broadcasting Authority (now the Australian Communications and Media Authority). On 5 March 2007, Seven Local News bulletins commenced production and broadcasts in a widescreen standard-definition digital format. Seven Local News was the first regional news service in regional Queensland to convert to widescreen. On 22 November 2010, Seven Local News launched a sixth edition for the Rockhampton/Gladstone and Central Queensland region. On 2 November 2015, Seven Local News launched a seventh edition for the Toowoomba and the Darling Downs region. With the said launch, Seven News became the only news service to cover all regional centres of Queensland since the axing of WIN News in the Mackay region in May 2015. This lasted until July 2017, when rival Nine News began to roll out local composite bulletins for their statewide affiliate Southern Cross Television (which has carried Nine programming since July 2016). From 11 July 2016, these editions are consolidated with the Seven News branding, though the openers of these editions remained to address as Seven Local News. The Local News branding was completely phased out on 5 September 2016 in favour of the Seven News brand. =Gold Coast= Seven News Gold Coast is presented by Rod Young and Amanda Abate, who also presents sport. Weather is presented by meteorologist Tony Auden (Monday - Thursday) and Paul Burt (Friday), and coastal, beaches and fishing reports from Paul Burt on a Thursday and Friday. The bulletin airs on weeknights at 5.30pm on BTQ-7's Gold Coast relay transmitters, ahead of the main 6pm news from Brisbane, placing it in direct competition with rival Nine Gold Coast News. The bulletin does not air when Australian Test cricket matches are scheduled. On 4 July 2016, a new local bulletin for the Gold Coast was introduced, produced and broadcast live from Seven's Surfers Paradise studio. From its launch, weekend bulletins were also produced, which made Seven the only network to produce local Gold Coast bulletins seven days a week. However, weekend bulletins were axed in November 2017, citing cost-cutting measures. In February 2018, Amanda (who formerly presented the axed weekend edition) joined Rod in presenting the weeknight local bulletin as well as reading sport. In July 2019, after three years on air, Seven News Gold Coast officially became the number one news bulletin on the Gold Coast, winning twenty-one weeks to the rival Nine Gold Coast News' one week. Fill in presenters include Bianca Stone (news), Tom Hartley (sport) and Tamra Bow (weather). Current affairs =Sunrise= Sunrise is the network's breakfast program, aired weekdays from 5:30 am to 9:00am. The show is broadcast live from Seven's Martin Place studios, and is based on a mix of human interest, showbiz and entertainment alongside half-hourly national news and sport bulletins and weather updates (WA viewers regularly receive a locally produced bulletin in place of the national bulletin). The program is hosted by David Koch and Samantha Armytage with news presenter Natalie Barr, sport presenter Mark Beretta, entertainment presenter Edwina Bartholomew and weather presenter Sam Mac. =Weekend Sunrise= Weekend Sunrise is the weekend edition of Sunrise, aired Saturday and Sunday mornings from 7:00 am to 10:00 am.

Former shows =Seven News at 7= Seven News at 7 aired at 7:00 pm on weeknights and was presented by Melissa Doyle from Seven's Martin Place studios, with weather presented by David Brown from the Melbourne studio.

On 28 April 2014, the bulletin was removed from the schedule. =Today Tonight= Today Tonight was the network's tabloid current affairs program, which aired weeknights at 6:30pm following their 6:00pm news bulletins. The program previously ran local editions in Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne before being cancelled in 2014 with their respective news bulletins expanded from thirty minutes to a full hour. In November 2019, the Adelaide and Perth editions were cancelled finally bringing their nightly news shows to an hour edition in line with the east coast. =Sunday Night= Sunday Night was the network's current affairs and investigative journalism program, which aired on Sunday nights at 8:30pm and presented by Melissa Doyle. Controversy =Outing of David Campbell= The news service, and in particular its news director Peter Meakin and reporter Adam Walters, came under heavy criticism in 2010 for the decision to air a story on then-New South Wales Transport Minister David Campbell as homosexual. Campbell, a Member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly for over two decades, was forced to resign after Meakin chose to air a story by Walters showing Campbell leaving a gay bathhouse. Amidst criticism of the story former NSW Labor Premier Barrie Unsworth condemned Campbell's actions. \\"Campbell has been the police minister and he's been on the state crime commission, and he's frequented places where he's easily recognised,\\" Mr Unsworth told The Australian newspaper. \\"The threat is not from Channel 7 lurking outside but by the people inside. We've got a criminal milieu in this city and he laid himself open to all sorts of threats and blackmail.\\" Seven's decision to run the story was derided by other politicians and several rival media outlets as \\"not a good moment for the media coverage of Macquarie Street\\", \\"old- fashioned\\" and an act of \\"pathetic snooping\\". Seven's justification for airing the story was initially that Campbell had misused his Ministerial vehicle, however this allegation was quickly shown to be untrue by other media outlets, as New South Wales Ministers have full private use of their Ministerial vehicles. The justification later put forward by Seven to defend its actions was that it was in the public interest to make the allegations public because of the risk of blackmail. The Australian Communications and Media Authority instigated an investigation into Seven's conduct in this matter, under the industry's self-regulated code of conduct. It accepted the public interest justification put forward by Seven, that Campbell's actions left him \\"vulnerable to compromise or blackmail\\". =Tony Abbott \\"Shit happens\\"= In 2011, under the freedom of information laws, Seven News obtained footage showing Opposition leader Tony Abbott speaking about the recent death of an Australian soldier in Afghanistan. Seven News edited the clips, then broadcast them that evening. After the incident, many media websites labeled the story a \\"ratings grab\\" for the network. The following morning, rival networks, obtained the same footage as Seven News and broadcast another part of the interview not seen on the original report showing military leaders agreeing with Tony saying \\"It certainly does\\", backing his claims that his words had been taken out of context. Mr Abbott maintains that he was discussing whether the unit had had sufficient firepower support during the incident. Seven News reporter Mark Riley appeared on Sunrise and many other radio shows defending the claims and the report that aired.

At war's end he was brevetted Brigadier General. He was a member of the infamous Tweed Ring, which he aided by naturalising new citizens to boost his election rolls. On one day alone, he naturalised over 2,000 new voters. However, when the scandal was uncovered, he was impeached and removed from office.

The station is owned by iHeartMedia and carries a news/talk radio format. WHO broadcasts with 50,000 watts, the maximum power permitted for commercial AM stations, around the clock. It uses a non-directional antenna. WHO dates back to the early days of broadcasting and is a Class A clear-channel station. During daytime hours, its transmitter power and Iowa's flat land (with near-perfect soil conductivity) gives it at least secondary coverage of most of Iowa, as well as parts of Illinois, Missouri, Nebraska, Kansas, Wisconsin, Minnesota and South Dakota. At night, the station adjusts its coverage to protect fellow clear-channel station WBZ in Boston at nearby 1030 AM. Even with this restriction, it can be heard across much of North America at night with a good radio, but is strongest in the Central United States. It is Iowa's primary entry point station in the Emergency Alert System. History =Early Years= WHO first began broadcasting on April 10, 1924.Broadcasting Yearbook 1977 page C-76 While most radio stations in Iowa today begin their call signs with a K, WHO begins with a W, because the original dividing line was the western border of Iowa. WHO dates back to the early years of radio, when call signs were often only three letters long. The call letters were not chosen because they spell out the question \\"Who?\\" The government handed out call signs sequentially. The studios were on the top floor of the Liberty Building in downtown Des Moines.http://www.skyscraperpage.com/cities/?buildingID=18905 The station was originally owned by Bankers Life, which is now the Principal Financial Group. After the FRC's General Order 40 reallocated frequencies in 1928, WHO ended up sharing time on the same frequency with WOC in Davenport. In 1930, B. J. Palmer, owner of WOC, bought WHO, and the two stations operated together as WOC-WHO until a new 50,000-watt transmitter near Mitchellville began operating on November 11, 1933. (WOC ceased broadcasting that day but returned on another frequency a year later.) Through most of its early years, WHO was a network affiliate of the NBC Red Network, broadcasting comedies, dramas, game shows, soap operas, sports and big bands. WHO moved from 1000 AM to the current 1040 on March 29, 1941, as a result of the North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement. Today WHO is one of only two 50,000-watt AM radio stations in Iowa. The other is KXEL in Waterloo. However, WHO was originally a Class I-A, while KXEL was given Class I-B status, requiring a directional antenna at night, to avoid interfering with the other Class I-B station on 1540, ZNS-1 in Nassau,Bahamas. For many years, WHO has used an owl as its mascot, an apparent play on its call letters, pronounced like an owl's call. =Ronald Reagan, WHO Sportscaster= Ronald Reagan working for WHO in the mid-1930s Future United States President Ronald Reagan worked as a sportscaster with WHO from 1932 to 1937. Among his duties were re-creations of Chicago Cubs baseball games. Reagan received details over a teleprinter for each play and would act as if he were in the stadium, reporting on the game while seeing it from the press box. Many radio stations used this re-creation system until sports networks became more common. =WHO-FM and WHO-TV= In 1948, WHO-FM 100.3 signed on the air. Originally WHO-FM simulcast most of the programming heard on 1040 AM. But in 1967, WHO-FM switched to classical music and beautiful music. 100.3 has changed formats and call letters several times since then and now broadcasts as KDRB, \\"100.3 The Bus.\\" In 1954, WHO-TV began broadcasting on channel 13. Because WHO 1040 was a long-time affiliate of NBC, the TV station also affiliated with NBC. WHO was continuously owned by the Palmer family for more than 70 years, until Jacor Broadcasting purchased the station in 1997. Jacor merged with Clear Channel Communications (now iHeartMedia) a year later. WHO and the other Clear Channel radio stations in Des Moines (KDRB, KKDM, KLYF, and KXNO) continued to share a building with WHO-TV until moving into a new facility in 2005. Personalities and Programming Most of WHO's daytime schedule is made up of local shows on weekdays, while nights carry nationally syndicated programming. Mornings begin with Van Harden and Bonnie Lucas, co-hosts of the Van & Bonniehttp://www.whoradio.com/pages/vbpersonality.html followed by Jeff Angelo in late mornings, Bob Quinn and Doug Cooper in mid-days and Simon Conway, originally from London, taking the afternoon drive time. Syndicated shows include Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, plus Lee Habeeb hosts Our American Stories, George Noory hosts Coast to Coast AM and America in The Morning. Weekends include a mix of live and syndicated shows. The live Saturday shows include Maxwell Schaeffer hosting \\"Maxwell & Friends\\", Brian Gongol, and Justin Brady. Sundays live shows include WHO's Gardening Today and Bill Cunningham. Other Syndicated weekend shows include Ric Edelman, Kim Komando, and Joe Pags. Talk-show host Steve Deace started his broadcast career at WHO. Sports Programming WHO has been the longtime flagship station of University of Iowa sports. Jim Zabel, who joined WHO in 1944,http://www.whoradio.com/pages/about/staff/index.html?feed=121651&article;=371669 was the play-by-play voice for Hawkeyes football and basketball games from 1949 to 1996. That is when the University of Iowa licensed exclusive rights to do radio play-by-play to Learfield Sports, which picked Gary Dolphin as the play-by-play announcer for Hawkeyes men's and women's basketball. Until his death in 2013, Zabel remained with WHO as co-host (with Jon Miller of HawkeyeNation) of the Sound Off sports talk show that airs on Saturdays during Hawkeyes seasons, and as co-host of Two Guys Named Jim on Sunday nights with former Iowa State University football coach Jim Walden. State Fair Programming WHO (AM) broadcasts programming from the Iowa State Fair for the duration of that event. References :Stein, Jeff, Making Waves: The People and Places of Iowa Broadcasting ().

Commemoration balls are held by different colleges each year, following a cycle by which each college holds a ball every three years.Balsdon, J.P.V.D.: Oxford Life, page 240. Eyre & Spottiswoode, 1957 Commemoration Week is so known because of the ceremonies in commemoration of the benefactors of the university that are held then, namely the Commemoration Day sermon formerly held (until 2006) on the Sunday, and the Encaenia ceremony (where the annual Creweian Oration in honour of benefactors is given) and garden party on the Wednesday of that week. Commemoration Week was formerly one of two occasions when balls were traditionally held, the other being Eights Week, the 5th week of Trinity term when the Summer Eights rowing races occur. Eights balls are nowadays comparatively rare. Definition There is no formal definition of a Commemoration ball, but the usual Oxford convention is to refer only to the larger, triennial balls as Commemoration balls. The dress code is usually white tie. Many other colleges hold smaller events during Commemoration Week that they call summer balls or parties rather than Commemoration balls. These are usually held on an annual or irregular basis, and are usually black tie. Merton College holds a triennial winter ball. Recent and upcoming balls In the past, Commemoration balls were held \\"night after night\\"Balsdon, J.P.V.D (supra) by different colleges during Commemoration Week. With many colleges now holding smaller annual summer balls, Commemoration balls are now held by only some of the larger colleges, who still follow the traditional triennial cycle. Oriel College hosts a ball in the first year of the three-year cycle, and until recently Magdalen College also did. However Magdalen College cancelled their ball in 2015 at the last minute downgrading to a smaller affair. Currently, in the second year, there are Commemoration balls held by New College and The Queen's College. In the third year, there are now four colleges with this honour (Worcester College, Christ Church, Trinity College, St. John's College). The 2005 Christ Church Commemoration ball was the first to be held by that college for fifteen years because of an incident at the 1990 ball that led to the Governing Body suspending the ball and replacing it with an annual summer party until 2005. Until 1990 the three great Oxford choral foundations of Magdalen College (first year), New College (second year) and Christ Church (third year) held their \\"white tie\\" Commemoration Balls in consecutive years on a triennial basis, each being widely regarded as the most prestigious ball being held in Oxford in that year, but the 1990 incident at Christ Church upset the tradition as various other colleges claimed Christ Church's (third year) slot, and continue to do so after the Christ Church Ball was reinstated in 2005. The cancellation of Magdalen College's (first year) Commemoration Ball in 2015, and its reinstatement in the \\"New College\\" (second) year of 2016, completed the break with tradition. In 2013, Balliol College held a Commemoration ball to mark the 750th Anniversary of the College's foundation, the first Commemoration Ball at Balliol since 1969. Similarly, the commemoration ball hosted by Worcester College on 27 June 2014 was the highlight of celebrations to mark the college's tercentenary. * 2003 ‚Äî Magdalen College * 2004 ‚Äî New College * 2005 ‚Äî Trinity College, Worcester College, Christ Church, St. John's College * 2006 ‚Äî Magdalen College * 2007 ‚Äî New College * 2008 ‚Äî Trinity College, Worcester College, Christ Church, St. John's College * 2009 ‚Äî Magdalen College, Oriel College * 2010 ‚Äî New College, Wadham College * 2011 ‚Äî Trinity College, Worcester College, Christ Church, St. John's College * 2012 ‚Äî Magdalen College, Oriel College * 2013 ‚Äî New College,http://newcollegeball.co.uk/ Balliol College * 2014 ‚Äî Trinity College,Trinity College Ball http://www.thetrinityball.com/ Worcester College, Christ Church,Christ Church Commemoration Ball 2014 http://christchurchball.co.uk St. John's College,St John's College Ball http://ball.sjc.ox.ac.uk/ Merton College,http://www.merton.ox.ac.uk/event/summer-ball Exeter College Hertford College * 2015 ‚Äî Oriel College, ~~Magdalen College~~ (Cancelled) * 2016 ‚Äî New College,New College Ball Magdalen College,Magdalen College Ball http://www.magdalenball.com The Queen's CollegeThe Queen's College Ball https://ousu.org/organisation/9590/ * 2017 ‚Äî Trinity College,http://www.trinity-ball.com St John's College, Worcester College, Christ Church, Corpus Christi College * 2018 ‚Äî Oriel Collegehttp://www.orielball.co.uk/ * 2019 ‚Äî New College, The Queen's College, ~~Magdalen College~~ (Cancelled again) Performances Commemoration ball organising committees generally seek to secure private performances from leading entertainers; some notable performances are listed below. ;2018 *Sigma, (Oriel College) ;2017 *Scouting for Girls, Redlight (Christ Church) *Example (St. John's) * Izzy Bizu, Tiggs da Author, Clokkemaker (Trinity College) ;2016 *Chase and Status, VITAMIN, The Electric Swing Circus, (Magdalen College) *Circa Waves, Gentleman's Dub Club, Afriquoi, (New College) ;2014 * Laura Mvula, A Skillz, The Oxford Imps, (Christ Church) * The Hoosiers, Pendulum, Jigsaw & Dynamite MC, Eliza And The Bear (St John's College) * Max√Ømo Park, Stornoway with Oxford University Sinfonietta, The Correspondents, DJ EZ, Jaymo & Andy George, (Worcester College)http://thetercentenaryball.co.uk/images/PDF/Programme.pdf * Clean Bandit, AlunaGeorge, The Correspondents, DJ Heidi, Friend Within (Trinity College)Trinity Commemoration Ball 27 June 2014 Programme ;2013 * Mark Ronson (Balliol College) * The Fratellis (New College) ;2012 * Athlete, Labrinth, Loick Essien, Natty, Roll Deep (Magdalen College)Athlete at Magdalen College Ball 2012 on YouTube * The Feeling (Oriel College)Oriel College Ball 2012 ;2011 * The Feeling (St John's College) * Mystery Jets (Worcester College)Worcester College Commemoration Ball 2011 :: The Grand Tour * The Streets, Sophie Ellis-Bextor (Trinity College)Trinity Commemoration Ball 2011 :: The Night * Tinchy Stryder (Christ Church) ;2010 * Scouting for Girls (New College) * Electric Six (Merton College) ;2009 * Feeder, The Pipettes (Magdalen College) * Ladyhawke, Scratch Perverts (Oriel College) ;2008 * The Wombats (Christ Church) * Sugababes, Stornoway (Trinity College) * One Night Only, Logistics (Worcester College) ;2007 * Ash (New College) ;2006 * Pharrell, Bodyrockers (Magdalen College) ;2005 * Supergrass (Trinity College) ;2004 * Dizzee Rascal (New College) ;1999 * Coldplay, Jools Holland (Trinity College) ;1964 *The Rolling Stones (Magdalen College) See also * Colleges of the University of Oxford * May Ball - similar events at the University of Cambridge References External links =2018 Balls= *Oriel College Commemoration Ball 22 June 2018 =2016 Balls= *New College Commemoration Ball 25 June 2015 *Magdalen College Commemoration Ball 25 June 2016 =2015 Balls= *Balliol College Ball - Monte Carlo 9 May 2015 *Oriel College Commemoration Ball - 26 June 2015 *St Hilda's College Ball - Carnevale di Venezia - 9 May 2015 =2014 Balls= *Worcester College Tercentenary Ball - 27 June 2014 *St John's Ball - 27 June 2014 *Hertford Bridge of Sighs Ball - 4 October 2014 =2013 Balls= *Wadham College Ball - 21 June 2013 *Balliol College Ball - 21 June 2013 *Queen's College Ball - 21 June 2013 *New College Ball - 22 June 2013 *Merton College Winter Ball - 30 November 2013 =2012 Balls= *Oriel College Ball - 22 June 2012 *Magdalen College Ball - 22 June 2012 =2011 Balls= *Christ Church Ball - 25 June 2011 *Trinity College Ball - 1 July 2011 *Worcester College Ball - 1 July 2011 *St John's Ball - 1 July 2011 Category:Terminology of the University of Oxford Category:Culture in Oxford Category:Balls in the United Kingdom ","title":"Commemoration ball"},{"id":"2446137","text":"Between 1966 and 1968 Korab worked with Astra Zarina on a photoessay project documenting Roman roofscapes. Balthazar Korab (; 1926‚Äì2013) was a Hungarian- American photographer based in Detroit, Michigan specializing in architectural, art and landscape photography. Biography Korab was born in Budapest, Hungary, and migrated to France after fleeing from Hungary's communist government in 1949. At the √âcole des beaux-arts in Paris, he completed a diploma of architecture in 1954. For a time, he was a journeyman under the direction of leading European architects, including Le Corbusier. In 1955, Korab arrived in the United States, and Eero Saarinen employed him to photograph the architectural design process. The architectural community in Detroit has embraced Korab's career, and many firms have retained him to document their building and private home projects. In 1956 he was awarded fourth place in the international design competition for the Sydney Opera House. Korab documented the 1966 flood of the Arno in Florence, Italy. In 1994, American President Bill Clinton presented a portfolio of Balthazar Korab's photography to √Årp√°d G√∂ncz, the president of Hungary.

It is called the gateway to North Bengal. Bogra is an industrial city where many small and mid-sized industries are sited. Bogra district was a part of the ancient Pundravardhana territory and the ruins of Mahasthangarh, the ancient capital of Pundravardhana, are located north of Bogra. History =Ancient history= Bogra District occupies an important place in the legendary and the earlier historical annals of Bengal. In the ancient period, it was a part of the territory of the Pundras or Paundras, which was known by the name of Pundravardhana. Pundravardhana was one of the kingdoms of Eastern India and was separated by the stream of Karatoya from the more easterly kingdom of Prag-Jyotisha or Kamrupa. The name, Pundravardhana, occurs frequently in the Mahabharata, Ramayana and the various Puranas. According to the Mahabharata and the Puranas, Vasudeva, a powerful prince of the Pundra family, is said to have ruled over Pundravardhana as far back as 1280 BC. The claims of the district to antiquity, however, rests chiefly on association which centre round the old fortified town, now known as Mahasthangarh.Bangladesh District Gazetteers:Bogra. Government of Bangladesh. 1979, pp. 27 This district was under the following rules: The Mauryas (4th century to 3rd century B.C.) This district was under the rule of the Mauryas in the 4th century BC. This is evident from the existence of some Pillars of Ashoka in many parts of Pundravardhana and from the discovery of an old Brahmi Inscription at Mahasthangarh in this district. Bhadra Bahu, a high monk of the Jain religion and a son of a Brahmin of Kotivarsha in Pundravardhana, was the Jain-Guru of Chandra Gupta Maurya. As Ashoka was a firm believer in Buddhism, he put to death many naked Sectarians (presumably the Jains in Pundravardhana. The Guptas (3rd century AD to the 5th century AD) The Gupta authority over this district is revealed from the discovery of a number of inscriptions of that period from Pundravardhana. Pundravardhana was a Bhukti under the rule of Guptas till the end of the 5th century. Sasanka (the first quarter of the 7th century AD) By the beginning of the 6th century this region might have passed under the rule of the Gaudas of Bengal. But the history of a century of this district lies in obscurity. However, at the beginning of the 7th century. Sasanka came upon the throne of Gauda and he definitely exercised his authority over Pundravardhana (including this district).Bangladesh District Gazetteers:Bogra. Government of Bangladesh. 1979, pp. 27‚Äì28 Harshavardhana (the second quarter of the 7th century) This region must have passed after death of Sasanka under the rule of Harshavardhana (606‚Äì647). This evident from the account of the Chinese pilgrim Xuanzang who visited Pundravardhana probably in 640 AD. The Palas (c. 750‚Äì1150) By the middle of the 8th century (c. 750) one Gopal assumed control of the affairs over North Bengal, established a royal dynasty known as the Pala Dynasty. After Gopal was elected king, he took his seat in Pundravardhana. He ruled over the region up to c. 780 and was succeeded by his son Dharmapala (c. 781‚Äì821). The Pala Kings had peaceful possession of this district up to the end of their rule over Bengal which ended in the 12th century. Dharmapala was the son and the successor of Gopala, extended his power beyond Pundravardhana. Like his father he was a Buddhist and founded the famous Buddhist Vihara at Somapuri in Varendra, the ruins of which have been discovered in the Naogaon District. The Senas (c. 1150‚Äì1204) The Senas originally came from the Deccan and settled in West Bengal. Vijayasena was the first great ruler of the dynasty. He defeated the last Pala king Madanapala, and established his authority over this district. He was succeeded by his son, Vallalsena (1160‚Äì1178) who was in definite possession of the district. He built his capital at Bhabanipur (a shakti- peeth) in this district. Lakshmanasena (1178‚Äì1204), the son and successor of Vallal Sena, exercised authority over this district till he was driven out by Ikhtiyaruddin Muhammad-bin-Bakhtiyar Khalji in 1204. Even after this date, a dynasty of Sena Rajas ruled for nearly a century over the north-eastern tract of this district as feudatory chiefs under the suzerainty of the Muslim rulers of Bengal. Their capital was at Kamalpur, a few miles to the north of Bhabanipur (a site of pilgrimage for the Hindu devotees) and a little to the south of Sherpur. Achyuta Sena was the last Prince of the line.Bangladesh District Gazetteers:Bogra. Government of Bangladesh. 1979, p. 28 =British Era= The present Bogra District was first formed in 1821 during British rule. In the 1901 census, the population of the district (on a reduced area) was around 854,533, an increase of 11% in the decade, the census revealed there was no town with as many as 10,000 inhabitants.Bogra ‚Äì Encyclop√¶dia Britannica article The famous Prafulla Chaki(1888‚Äì1908) was born in this district. =Battle of Bogra and recent history= The area was enveloped in thick fighting in the Battle of Bogra between the allied troops of Mukti Bahini and Indian Army (combined) which defeated the Pakistan Army during the Bangladesh Liberation War of 1971. In 2018, the Government of Bangladesh changed its spelling of the name of the district from Bogra to Bogura.  Geography and climate  =Formation of land= The area consisting whole of Upazila Sariakandi, Gabtali, Sonatala and major part Dhunat is called the eastern alluvial tract. Fertilized by the silt of flood waters, the eastern alluvion is one of the most fertile and prosperous areas in Bogra, Jute, aus, aman paddy, sugarcane and pulses are grown. Sometimes as many as three or more crops are grown on one field in a year without any apparent diminution of its productivity.Bangladesh District Gazetteers:Bogra. Government of Bangladesh. 1979, p. 81 The western portion of the district is a marked contrast to the eastern one. In most parts it is well-wooded. Dense shrub jungle is to be found is Upazilas of Sherpur and in parts of Sibganj, which has a comparatively large proportion of cultivable waste land. This part of the district is slightly higher than the eastern parts and is generally above flood level. The soil of this part is generally suited to the growth paddy. Adamdighi is well known for the fine qualities of rice. This rice is grown some extent in the Shibganj Upazila. The tract to the east of the Karatoya is a part of the valley of the Brahmaputra and is generally low-lying and intersected by numerous khals (Canals) and shallow swamps and marshes. It is subject to yearly inundation from the overflow of the Brahmaputra and, therefore, gets a rich deposit of silt. There is very little jungle and almost the entire area is under cultivation. =Rivers= There are quite a few rivers in the Bogra District. The Karatoya is the central divider of water- channel of the district, the other rivers may be classified into the eastern and western systems.Bangladesh District Gazetteers:Bogra. Government of Bangladesh. 1979, pp. 2‚Äì8 The names of the some important rivers of this district are as follows: # The Bangali # The Karatoya # The Jamuna # The Nagar # The Tulshiganga # The Isamoti = Climate = The district has a humid subtropical climate. Industry Bogra was once the industrial capital of Bangladesh. There were several heavy industries. Most of them were owned by the local elite families \\"Jamil\\", \\"Bhandari\\", \\"Tajima\\", and \\"Khalifa\\". Various industries of \\"Tajma\\" were also a name among the rich and famous. Bhandari's had several establishments. Among them, Bogra Cotton Spinning Mills, North Bengal Tannery, Habib Match Factory, Golam Kibria Soap Works, Bhandari Glass works, Bhandari Biri were the prime ones. In the other hand, Jamils are keeping their business like Jamil Housing, Jamil shopping complex, Jan-e-saba community centre and others. Tajma still leads their position, Mr. Amjad Hossain Tajma, managing director of the Tajma group of Industry heading their business named Tajma Creamic Industry, Tajma Enamel Industry, Transfer Paper Limited, Agrofresh Limited, Snowbe Ice Cream Industry and so on. Local language (dialect of Bogra) The mother tongue of this district is Bengali. In this district of Bogra \\"the dialect spoken is what is known as Northern dialect of Bengali of the Eastern Branch,\\" says Dr. Grierson, may be taken to be the form of the language, which is spoken in the Dinajpur District, but the form of the dialect spoke in Bogra differs very little from that of Dinajpur. The northern dialect is spoken in the district of Rajshahi, Dinajpur, Rangpur, Bogra and Pabna. The whole of the tract has within historic times been subject to Koch tribes and members of this tribe still exist in each district.

Their habitats and diets are similar to other gerbils. The gestation period is 20‚Äì22 days and the average litter size is four or five. The IUCN formerly listed the junior synonym Gerbillus allenbyi as vulnerable.  Physical description  Anderson's gerbil is a medium-sized rodent with a tail that is long compared to the rest of its body. This rodent has dense fur with a tan color along with some reddish tint on the upper part of the body with a white underbelly. The ears of the gerbil are very large with a dark fur color. The ears of this animal is distinctive in that it does not have the white patch behind the ear as others of the genus Gerbillus. Typical of the species in Gerbillus, Anderson's gerbil has large eyes with a black ring around them. There is a distinct white patch that appears above each of the eyes. The gerbil has long hind limbs while the front limbs are shorter. The length Anderson's gerbil is estimated between 19‚Äì27 cm. The tail length can vary from 11‚Äì15 cm. The mammal can weigh from 15.9-38.4 grams.  Habitat and distribution  Anderson's gerbil usually occupies sandy dunes of deserts and is primarily found in sandy, often solidified, dunes along the coastal regions of its distribution range. This animal can also be found inland and tends to live in sandy areas of valleys or very dry areas, along with mountainsides. Anderson's gerbil inhabits coastal plains of North Africa and the Middle East, from Tunisia and northern Libya to Egypt, Israel, and southwestern Jordan.  Biology and reproduction  Like all other species in the genus Gerbillus, Anderson's gerbil is a burrowing rodent. The evidence for this mammal tends to suggest that it has a nomadic lifestyle considering that the warrens that it builds are not as complex as other genera of gerbils. However, the species sometimes live in groups when they are in a favorable habitat. They occupy a small home range of typically from 32 to 34 square meters, and are nocturnal. They are seed-eating gerbils and feed on the seeds of the common evergreen Thymelaea hirsuta. The breeding season occurs during late winter and early spring, coinciding with the seed shedding of Thymelaea hirsuta. Both genders of the species are active for reproductive purposes only once per year. The gestation period is from 20 to 22 days, and litters consist of three to seven offspring. They are sexually mature in their first year after birth.  Threats  This species of gerbil is not technically a threatened species. Under the IUCN redlist, the animal is listed as of least concern and the only threat to this animal mentioned is that overgrazing could be a problem in some parts of the home range of the gerbil.

It is one of The Saints. The civil parish is called St Mary, South Elmham otherwise Homersfield. The village is the home of Homersfield Bridge, a 50-foot span built in 1870 by the Adair estate and the oldest surviving concrete bridge in Britain. It was restored during the 1990s by a partnership between the parish council and various local authorities and heritage bodies. The village is centred on a small green, around which lie houses from various periods, including a number of traditional thatched houses. Although the village once had a post office and village shop, only the Black Swan pub now remains, a free house serving Adnams ale and food. There also was once a water mill sited just outside the village on the road towards St Cross. This was demolished in the 1930s after the Waveney became too silted up to run the mill. A modern house, built in the approximate style of the previous mill, was built around 1999. Homersfield railway station was located just across the river in Norfolk but ceased operating following the closure of the Waveney Valley Line in the mid-1960s. Homersfield is bordered by a strip of woodland in which sits the flint-built village church. Behind the woodland is a large lake, the site of a former gravel pit. Although once open as an amenity to the village, it is now a private fishing lake. Sands and gravels have been quarried at Homersfield since the 1940s. They have yielded bones, teeth and tusks of woolly mammoth, woolly rhinoceros, wild horse, bison and reindeer, dating from colder phases of the Ice Age. A mammoth tusk is on display at the Black Swan inn. A panel explaining the Ice Age wildlife interest is located on the village green.

In the higher education sector it was mainly concentrated in the Post 16 sector. In 2004 NATFHE celebrated 100 years since the London-based Association of Teachers in Technical Institutions (ATTI) was formed. ATTI grew and became NATFHE on 1 January 1976 following amalgamation with the Association of Teachers in Colleges and Departments of Education (ATCDE). As of 2005 it had 67,000 members. On 2 December 2005 the results of a membership ballot on a merger of AUT and NATFHE were announced. The merger was supported by 79.2% of AUT and 95.7% of NATFHE members who voted. The two unions amalgamated on 1 June 2006, and then entered a transitional year until full operational unity was achieved in June 2007. The new union is called the University and College Union (UCU). Until the merger, AUT and NATFHE members in higher education were involved in ongoing 'action short of a strike' - including boycotting setting and marking exams and other coursework in universities and this action continued under the UCU banner. AUT and NATFHE rejected an offer of 12.6% over three years which was made on 8 May, and a further offer of 13.12% over three years made on 30 May. Concerns grew that students might not be able to graduate in 2006 until the industrial action was suspended at midnight on 7 June while members were balloted on a new offer. On the last day of its final conference NATFHE passed motion 198C, a call to boycott Israeli academics who did not vocally speak out against their government.

Route It branches from the A456 west of Bewdley, at a place called Fingerpost. Only the first of the route is in Worcestershire,Google maps as immediately after passing through the small village of Far Forest it passes over the Lem Brook and into Shropshire. Heading in a roughly westerly direction, it passes through Cleobury Mortimer, Hopton Wafers and Clee Hill Village. The road's destination is the town of Ludlow,Ordnance Survey mapping where (since 1979) it ends at the Rocks Green roundabout on the A49 bypass. The route is long. Notable bridges are where the road crosses the River Rea on the eastern edge of Cleobury Mortimer, the Hopton Brook at Hopton Wafers, and also the Ledwyche Brook at Henley near Ludlow. =B road junctions= The A4117 has no 'A road' junctions other than at its two ends. It has five junctions with 'B roads' however, all of which are at a terminus of the B road in question. To the east of Cleobury Mortimer there are junctions with the B4202 road (which heads southwards into north Worcestershire), and the B4201 and B4363 roads (which head northwards into east Shropshire). Further along, the B4214 road runs from a junction with the A4117 at Cleehill, down a considerable decline to Tenbury Wells. At Henley, near the Ludlow bypass, the B4364 road from Bridgnorth joins the A4117. =Terrain= The A4117 just east of Cleehill, where the road passes through a common with grazing sheep. The pass over the southern slopes of Titterstone Clee Hill reaches an altitude of , making the A4117 Shropshire's highest A-road (the highest classified road is the B4368 at Anchor). Because of its situation and altitude, the A4117 is often affected by snow in winter. This upland part of the route is within the Shropshire Hills AONB. Two notable inclines are named ‚Äî the stretch from Hopton Wafers to Doddington is Hopton Bank; whilst the road from Clee Hill Village down to Henley is named Angel Bank. Hopton Bank had Shropshire's last remaining emergency escape lane (a sand trap for vehicles unable to brake) towards its lower end in Hopton Wafers; this was however removed in 2014 having become obsolete.Shropshire Star Shropshire motorists put faith in brakes as escape lane reaches end of road (21 May 2014) The road passes through common land between Doddington and Clee Hill Village, and as such has cattle grids across the road to keep the openly grazing sheep within the common. There is a public car park by the A4117 in Clee Hill Village, which affords a considerable view over the Teme valley below and further into the counties of Herefordshire and Worcestershire. At the car park is a toposcope and close by are public conveniences. The road also passes right through the centre of the small market town of Cleobury Mortimer, which is a linear settlement along the road. This stretch is often congested. Due to the hilly terrain and passing through the constrained streets through Cleobury Mortimer and Clee Hill Village, it is sometimes quicker (and more fuel efficient, especially for heavy goods vehicles) to take the A456 and A49 (i.e. via Woofferton) instead, if travelling between Bewdley and Ludlow; these two A roads are designated primary routes, whilst the A4117 is not. =Bus service= The 292 (previously 2L) bus service (Ludlow-Bewdley-Kidderminster runs along the entire length of the road, providing regular public buses Monday to Saturday. =Garages= The modern route as of 2018 has three filling stations, at Mawley Oak (the B4202 junction), in Cleobury Mortimer, and at Foxwood near Doddington. Another opened in 2017 at the original junction with the former route of the A49 in Ludlow. History The Cornbrook Corner, between Doddington and Clee Hill Village; above can be seen quarrying operations, which use the A4117 for transporting extracted stone. The A4117 was created in 1927. Previously the majority of the route (from Henley to Fingerpost) was the B4200, and the remainder (between the A49 in Ludlow and Henley) was part of the B4364. (These B roads having been classified only five years earlier in 1922.) The route number 'B4200' has since been re-used for a short road in Wednesbury. Prior to the opening of the A49 Ludlow bypass in 1979, the A4117 continued into the town along Henley Road and New Road to the old A49 route (passing under the Welsh Marches railway line at the foot of New Road). The junction with the A49 was at the Bridge Inn on Corve Street until the construction of Burway Bridge in the 1950s diverted the A49, after which the A4117 ran a little further (along part of the former A49 route), crossing the historic Corve Bridge. This section from the pre-bypass A49 route (which has been re-classified as the B4361) along New Road and Henley Road to the Rocks Green roundabout is no longer a classified (A or B) route, however remains a busy local route (and the 2L bus route runs its length). =Railway closures= The A4117 passed under the Tenbury and Bewdley Railway, which closed in 1962 to passengers and 1964 for freight, and the Cleobury Mortimer and Ditton Priors Light Railway, which finally closed in 1960, near to the former Cleobury Mortimer railway station, which was situated some distance from the town in the Wyre Forest and which was the junction of these two lines. The town, since these closures, has no railway links. 1962 saw the final closure of the railway link from Clee Hill Junction in Ludlow to the stone aggregate quarries on Clee Hill, meaning the quarrying operations there (which continue to the present-day) now rely on the A4117 road. =Milestones= A number of historic milestones and mileposts (dated to the 18th and 19th centuries) continue to exist along the route; the remaining ones are in place between Far Forest and Cleobury Mortimer (marking distances to Cleobury and Bewdley) and again from Doddington to Henley (marking distances to Ludlow and Cleobury).Milestone Society Repository References External links *Milestone Society Repository \\"Bewdley 4\\" milepost.

It is native to northern Africa where it inhabits sandy deserts, semi-arid areas and oases. It is a common species, and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated its conservation status as being of \\"least concern\\". Description The greater Egyptian gerbil has a head-and-body length of about and a tail of about . The dorsal fur is some shade of orange or light brown, the individual hairs having grey bases and orange or brown shafts. There is often a mid- dorsal dark streak. The underparts are white, as are some facial markings around the eyes and ears, and a variably-sized patch on the rump. The feet are white, with the soles of the hind feet being clad with hair. The tail is often tipped with a dark tuft of hairs. 2n = 38. Distribution and habitat The greater Egyptian gerbil is native to much of North Africa. Its range extends from Mauritania and Mali eastwards through Niger and Chad to Sudan, Egypt and the Sinai Peninsula. It typically inhabits sandy deserts and other arid or semi-arid areas, palm groves, cultivated areas, dunes, and sandy and gravelly plains, often digging its burrow near tussocks of Panicum turgidum or under Tamarix or umbrella thorn acacia trees. It is common in the Nile Delta area, in the Nile Valley and around oases. Ecology The greater Egyptian gerbil is nocturnal and terrestrial, excavating a burrow in which it lives during the day; this is similar to the burrow dug by the lesser Egyptian gerbil, which descends to a depth of . This gerbil often lives in colonies. It feeds on seeds and grasses, storing some in its burrow. In Sudan, breeding takes place between June and February, with litters averaging three young being born after a 22-day gestation period. The longevity of this gerbil in captivity is two years. Status The International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated the conservation status of this gerbil as being of \\"least concern\\". This is on the basis that it has a wide range and is presumed to have a large total population, and any decrease in its numbers is unlikely to be significant.

They are both in the Shropshire Hills Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. Geography The hills stretch over 15 miles and run north - south, and for about this distance the lowest point along the hills is just under . Titterstone Clee Hill is around five miles south of Brown Clee Hill. The B4364 road from Ludlow to Bridgnorth runs between the two hills, offering good views of both. The hills have been said to form a \\"gateway\\" from the built up areas of the West Midlands to the hills and rural landscape of Wales and are at the heart of the Welsh Marches. Much quarrying has taken place on the hills over the years, and there are large air traffic control domes and radar towers on the summits of both hills which can be seen for many miles around. =Views= Views from the west of the hills spread as far as Snowdonia and Cadair Idris, the Brecon Beacons, the Black Mountains, The Long Mynd, Stiperstones Shropshire's third highest peak, Corndon Hill and Radnor Forest. To the south are the Malvern Hills and the Cotswolds, and to the east are the Clent Hills, Turner's Hill, Barr Beacon and the spread of the West Midlands. To the north is Cannock Chase, and on a very clear day the hills of the Peak District including The Roaches and Winter Hill. It is possible to see the urban centres of Dudley and Wolverhampton, with Wolverhampton Wanderers FC's Molineux stadium visible. The hills mark a clear eastern boundary to the Shropshire Hills, and are just west of the Severn Valley between Bridgnorth and Bewdley. The hills stand out over the surrounding countryside and can be seen from well into Staffordshire, Worcestershire, Herefordshire and the Black Country. They can also be seen, on a clear day, from the M5 Motorway on the northbound approach to Bromsgrove. The hills were created by glacial activity in the last Ice Age. In the summer the hills are green and are easy walking, attracting many visitors from the Black Country and other parts of the West Midlands as well as much further afield, but care must be taken during winter, as though most of the time there is no snow and ice on the hills, when it comes it can be sudden and severe with very strong gales and blizzards often closing roads on the hill. The village of Cleehill, lies on the slopes of Titterstone Clee Hill, about half way between Ludlow and Cleobury Mortimer. The area is important for wildlife, with peregrine, kestrel, Northern wheatear, European stonechat, skylark, Eurasian curlew and barn owl often seen, as well as adders, rabbits, and other birds, including ravens. In late July and early August 2007, Catherton Common near Titterstone Clee was home to a very rare woodchat shrike. The hills in popular culture * There is a long-standing rumour in the local area - that is that they are the highest land eastwards until the Ural Mountains in Russia. According to OpenCycleMap this appears to be true, with no land above 500m until the Urals. It has even been known for radios in the area to pick up Radio Moscow signals, hence the name of the former pub near Clee Hill village, The Kremlin Inn, which closed in 2015. Abdon Burf, the summit of the Brown Clee in freezing conditions. The radar masts are clearly visible. * The Clee hills are mentioned in A. E. Housman's poem \\"From Clee to heaven the beacon burns\\", which is a section of A Shropshire Lad. * Titterstone Clee and Brown Clee also figure in Ellis Peters' Brother Cadfael mystery, The Virgin in the Ice. * The Clee Hills have given rise to many place names in the area, including the villages of Cleehill, Cleeton St Mary, Cleestanton and Cleedownton. * Clee Hill features prominently on the Hereford Mappa Mundi.

Local news briefs are heard on weekdays, with Mike Opelka hosting his show Saturday morning. Regular host Ken Matthews was named one of the 100 most important talk radio show hosts (the \\"Heavy Hundred\\") in America by TALKERS Magazine. =Sports= WPHT was the flagship station for Philadelphia Phillies baseball for 32 years, until the 2016 season, when co-owned 94.1 WIP-FM took over as flagship. However, WPHT will still air any Phillies games that WIP-FM is unable to air due to programming conflicts. WPHT airs Temple University football and men's basketball. History The station first began broadcasting in May 1922 as WCAU, a 250-watt station operating out of electrician William Durham's home at 19th and Market Streets. It is Philadelphia's third-oldest radio station, having signed on two months after WIP (now WTEL) and WFIL. In 1924, WCAU was sold to law partners Ike Levy and Daniel Murphy. Murphy later bowed out in favor of Ike's brother, Leon, a local dentist. The station began its long association with CBS in 1927, when it was one of 16 charter affiliates of the Columbia Phonographic Broadcasting System, a network airing the CBS' first program on September 18, 1927. Radio Digest, September 1927, quoted in: McLeod, Elizabeth (September 20, 2002). CBS‚ÄîIn the Beginning, History of American Broadcasting. Retrieved on 2007-01-01. The other stations were WOR, Newark; WADC, Akron; WAIU, Columbus; WCAO, Baltimore;WEAN, Providence; WFBL, Syracuse; WGHP, Detroit; WJAS, Pittsburgh; WKRC, Cincinnati; WMAK, Buffalo- Lockport; WMAQ, Chicago; WNAC, Boston; WOWO, Fort Wayne; KMOX, St. Louis; and KOIL, Council Bluffs, Iowa. The network struggled to find advertisers, however, and William S. Paley, who had previously purchased time on the station for an entertainment program promoting his family's La Palina cigars, bought the network with $500,000 of his family's money and renamed it the Columbia Broadcasting System. Actor Paul Douglas began his career at WCAU, where he worked as an announcer and sportscaster from 1928 to 1934. In 1930, WCAU initiated a shortwave radio service, operating under the call sign W3XAU. It is believed that this was the first license issued by the FCC for a commercial international shortwave broadcast station. Initially W3XAU simulcast WCAU programming, but eventually original programming was created specifically for international listeners. W3XAU, later WCAI, then WCAB, was closed down in 1941 as CBS consolidated various shortwave operations. The 10 kW shortwave transmitter was disassembled, and WCAU staff were told that it was sent to England to aid the BBC war propaganda efforts. However, the transmitter was actually sent to Camp X, a secret World War II paramilitary and commando training facility located near Toronto, Ontario, Canada, becoming part of the Hydra signals intelligence and communications program. A series of power increases brought the station to 50,000 watts, with a new 50,000-watt transmitter dedicated October 2, 1932. The Levy brothers eventually became major stockholders in CBS, and were members of the network's board for many years. On December 26, 1932, WCAU moved to a new facility at 1622 Chestnut Street. Broadcasting (magazine) called it \\"a thoroughly modern 9-story building ... erected especially for the WCAU Broadcasting Co.\\" The building included eight studios and \\"a special office for Leopold Stokowski, director of the Philadelphia Orchestra.\\" The Levys agreed to sell WCAU-AM-FM to The Philadelphia Record in 1946. However, the Record folded shortly thereafter, and its \\"goodwill\\"‚Äîincluding the rights to buy WCAU-AM-FM‚Äîpassed to the Philadelphia Bulletin, which already owned WPEN-AM-FM, and had secured a construction permit for WPEN-TV (channel 10). In a complex deal, the Bulletin sold off WPEN and WCAU-FM, while changing WPEN-FM's calls to WCAU-FM and WPEN- TV's calls to WCAU-TV. The Levys continued to run the stations while serving as consultants to the Bulletin, and it was largely due to their influence that WCAU-TV took to the air on May 23, 1948 as a CBS affiliate. The stations moved to a new studio in Bala Cynwyd in 1952. In 1957, the Bulletin sold WCAU-AM-FM- TV to CBS. This came because the Bulletin had recently bought WGBI-TV in Scranton, Pennsylvania and changed its call letters to WDAU-TV to complement WCAU. However, the two television stations' signals overlapped so much that it constituted a duopoly under Federal Communications Commission (FCC) rules of the time. CBS had to get a waiver to keep its new Philadelphia cluster. In addition to significant overlap of the television stations' grade B signals, the FCC normally did not allow common ownership of clear channel stations with overlapping nighttime signals. In the 1960s, WCAU gradually began moving away from music programming; by 1967 it had become a talk station with considerable strengths in news and sports (all of Philadelphia's major professional sports teams had WCAU as their flagship radio station at one time or another). Although the station's ratings were good, in the mid-1970s, CBS made a corporate decision to move WCAU to an all-news format. The station never caught up to established all-news outlet KYW, and by 1980, WCAU was making moves to reclaim its heritage as a talk and sports leader. However, FM talk station WWDB had established itself as a strong competitor, and WCAU struggled for years to attract listeners and establish a consistent image. On August 15, 1990, CBS abruptly changed the WCAU call letters to WOGL after 68 years and dropped the talk format in favor of oldies, partially simulcast with its FM sister station, by then WOGL-FM. In 1993, the AM station began running sports talk after 7 p.m.. The station went all-sports as WGMP (The Game) on March 18, 1994. However, once again, the station was taking on an entrenched competitor‚Äîthis time WIP‚Äîand WGMP's largely syndicated program lineup won few listeners away from WIP's heavily local schedule. WPHT's logo as \\"The Big Talker 1210\\", used until January 2011. A year later, CBS merged with Westinghouse Electric Corporation, thus making 1210 AM a sister station to its ancient rival, KYW. With this move, the higher-rated KYW became the flagship station of CBS Radio's Philadelphia cluster. Realizing that WGMP would never be able to compete against WIP, CBS began phasing out the sports talk shows in the summer of 1996. Finally, on August 23, 1210 AM went all-talk once again as WPTS (We're Philadelphia's Talk Station). The call letters changed again less than a month later to the current WPHT to avoid confusion with nearby Trenton, New Jersey's WPST. Ironically, only a year later, WIP became a sister station to WPHT when CBS merged with its owner, Infinity Broadcasting Corporation (at the time part of Viacom). On February 2, 2017, CBS Radio announced it would merge with Entercom. CBS Radio to Merge with Entercom The merger was approved on November 9, 2017, and was consummated on the 17th.

He played for the Chicago Cubs, New York Highlanders, Detroit Tigers, and Chicago White Sox from 1903 to 1916. Life Moriarty was born in Chicago, where he grew up near the Union Stock Yards. He made his major league debut on September 7, at the age of 19 with the Cubs. He was an average hitter but an outstanding baserunner, with 20 or more stolen bases in eight consecutive seasons and 248 career stolen bases, including eleven steals of home. He played his last major league game on May 4, with the White Sox. Afterward, he became an American League umpire from 1917 to 1940, interrupted only by a 2-year stint as manager of the Tigers in 1927-28. He was one of the AL's most highly regarded umpires in his era, working in the 1921, 1925, 1930, 1933 & 1935 World Series (as crew chief in 1930 & 1935), as well as the second All- Star Game in 1934. A baseball card of Moriarty as a member of the Detroit Tigers in 1911. On Memorial Day in 1932, Moriarty worked behind the plate for a Cleveland Indians home game against the White Sox. When several Chicago players took exception to his calls, he challenged them to settle the dispute under the stands of League Park after the game. Pitcher Milt Gaston took him on first but Moriarty knocked him flat, breaking his hand. Several White Sox, including manager Lew Fonseca and catcher and future AL umpire Charlie Berry, took him on in turn. The next day, AL president Will Harridge issued numerous fines and a 10-day suspension for Gaston. It is reported that once while Moriarty was umpiring, none other than Babe Ruth stepped out of the batter's box and asked Moriarty to spell his last name. When he did so, Ruth reportedly replied, \\"Just as I thought; only one I.\\" The baseball card shown to the left of this text, however, misspells Moriarty's name with two I's. Moriarty also was noted for coming to the defense of Tiger slugger Hank Greenberg in the 1935 World Series (eventually won by Detroit), when he warned several Chicago Cubs to stop yelling antisemitic slurs at Greenberg. When they defied him and kept up the abuse, he took the unusual step of clearing the entire Chicago bench‚Äîa move that got him fined by longtime Commissioner/Judge Kenesaw Mountain Landis (known primarily to posterity for keeping blacks out of the major leagues throughout his quarter-century in office). Three years later, when Greenberg was pursuing Babe Ruth's single-season home run record, Moriarty kept the final game of the season going until darkness made it impossible to continue, Greenberg finishing with 58 homers, two shy of Ruth's record. In his biography, Greenberg recalled: Despite his combative field persona Moriarty was quite congenial off the field, maintaining close friendships with Jesuit priests at the College of the Holy Cross in central Massachusetts. He also fancied himself a lyricist, supplying the words for Richard A. Whiting's tune \\"Love Me Like the Ivy Loves the Old Oak Tree.\\" and J. R. Shannon on \\"Maybe I'll Forget You Then\\" and \\"Ragtime 'Rastus Brown\\" in 1912. On the other hand, during 1944 divorce proceedings his wife testified, \\"His attitude toward the next-door neighbors was of intense hatred for no reason whatever. One time he heard the neighbor's radio. He was so angry he carried our radio to the open window next to the neighbor and turned it on full blast for about three hours.\\" Moriarty joined the AL public relations staff after retiring from field work, and later became a scout for the Tigers, helping to discover such players as hard-hitting Harvey Kuenn and southpaw Billy Hoeft before retiring in December 1958. He died in Miami at 79. Family Moriarty was the grandfather of actor and former Law & Order star Michael Moriarty, who also played pitcher Henry Wiggen in the 1973 baseball movie Bang the Drum Slowly.

Where the Mind can't be subdued into Virtue, by Reason and Philosophy; nothing can influence it more, than to present to it the Success and Felicity, which Crowns the Pursuit of what's Great and Honourable. The beginning of romances is to be searched for in a far distant past and of interest to ‚Äúthe Curious in Antiquity‚Äù :Upon this Account, They are very much indebted to the Labour and Penetration of Huetius; who has, with great Judgement, traced the Subject he undertook to Illustrate, till he found it in its Infancy, involved in the Umbrage of Fable, and perplexed in the Folds of Mystery and Riddle. [p.iv-v] The treatise has found a wide audience in Latin and French translations. The new English translation is designed to attract a growing audience: :Especially since Romance has of late convey'd it self very far into the Esteem of this Nation, and is become the Principal Diversion of the Retirement of People of all Conditions. [p.v] =Huet's Text: The Original of Romances. [p.1-149]=  What is a Romance?  :The Name of Romance was formerly extended not only to Prose but Verse; Giradi and Pigra, in their Treatises de Romanzi, scarce mention any other, and lay down the Bayrdos and Arioste for Instances of their Opinion. But the Custom of this Age prevails to the contrary; so that we esteem nothing to be properly Romance but Fictions of Love Adventures, disposed into an Elegant Style in Prose, for the Delight and Instruction of the Reader. :I call them Fictions, to discriminate them from True Histories; and I add, of Love Adventures, because Love ought to<4> be the Principal Subject of Romance. It is required to be in Prose by the Humour of the Times. It must be compos'd with Art and Elegance, lest it should appear to be a rude undigested Mass, without Order or Beauty. [p.3-4] \\"Instruction\\" is the next argument, yet Huet does not go into tedious details here. \\"Virtue\\" is placed against \\"Vice\\", \\"Disgrace\\" is to be avoided. The next step is the definition of \\"Romance\\" versus \\"Epic Poem\\". Both have one thing in common if one follows Aristotle's definition of Poesy: they are fictional: :[...] in several Respects there is a great Relation between them; and according to Aristotle (who informs us, That 'tis Fiction rather than Verse which makes a Poet) a Writer of Romance may be reckon'd among the Poets. Petronius tells us, That Poems are to move in great Circumference by the Ministry of the Gods, and Expressions vast and audacious; so that First, They may be looked upon as Oracles throughout, from a Spirit full of<7> Fury, and then for a faithful and exact Narration. :Romances preserve a much greater Simplicity, and are not so exalted, nor have the same Figures in Invention and Expression. :Poems have more of the sublime, though they are not always confined to Probability. Romances have more of Probability, though they don't advance so far toward the Sublime. :Poems are more regular and correct in the Frame of their Contrivance, and receive less Addition from Events and Episodes than Romances, which are capable of these Accessions, because their Style is not so elevated, and they don't so far di<8>sten'd the Intellect, so that they give it leave to admit a greater Number of different Ideas. :In short, Poems make some Military Act, or Politick Conduct, their Theme, and only descant upon Love at Pleasure; whereas Romances, on the contrary, have Love for their Principal Subject, and don't concern themselves in War or Politicks, but by Accident. I speak of Regular Romances, for those in Old French, Spanish, and Italian, have generally more of the Soldier than Gallant. [p.7-8] The differences between histories and romances are connected with the fictional status--a problem is here caused by histories full of erroneous notions: :These Works are true in the Main, and false in some Parts. Romances, on the contrary, are false in the Gross, and true in some Particulars. [...<10>] I mean, that Falsehood is so predominant in Romance, that it may be altogether False in Whole and every Particular. [p.10] Huet excludes Histories if the authors wanted to give rue accounts and just failed and he excludes \\"fables\\": :[...] for Romance is a Fiction of Things which may, but never have happen'd; whereas the Matter of Fables is what never has, nor ever will be perform'd. [p.13]  An Ancient Practice: Religions Use Fictions to Create Secret Knowledge  The following part of the treatise touches the origin of \\"romances\\". The peoples of Asia, especially those of Egypt had, so Huet claims, proven a tendency to decipher all kinds of information. The hieroglyphs prove that. Their whole religion and all their histories were deciphered, mostly to exclude the population from further knowledge. Initiations were afforded before one would gain access to the secret cultural knowledge Egypt stored. The Greeks  had been extremely eager to learn from Egypt: :'Twas without doubt from these Priests, that Pythagoras and Plato, in their Voyage to √Ügypt, learned to Transform their Philosophy, and hide it under the Shadow of Mystery and Disguise. [p.17] The Arabs exploited the same cultural knowledge--their Koran is, so Huet says filled with knowledge one cannot understand without interpretation. The Arabs translated Greek fables into their language and via Arabia [p. 20] these materials finally reached Europe. This is proven by the fact that only after the occupation of Spain first romances appeared in southern France. Huet discusses Persias culture--as particularly obscure and full of secret knowledge, he mentions the Indians [p. 27] as particularly fond of poesy, before he speaks of the influence the Bible had on the western civilization and its love of fictions: :The Holy Scripture is altogether Mysterious, Allegorical, and √Ünigmatical. The Talmudists are of Opinion that the Book of Job is no other than a Parable of the Hebrews<32> Invention; this Book, that of David, the Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, the Canticles, and all other Holy Songs, are Poetical Works abounding with Figures, which would seem bold and violent in our Writings, and which are frequent in those of that Nation. The Book of Proverbs is otherwise call'd the Paraboles, because Proverbs of this sort, according to the Definition of Quintilian, are only short Figures or Parables express'd in little. :The Book of Canticles is a kind of Dramatic Poem, where the passionate Sentiments of the Bridegroom and Spouse are expressed after a Manner so tender and touching, that we<33> should be charmed and affected with it, if the Expression and Figures had a little more Conformity to our Genius; or if we could Divest our selves of Prejudice, which disposes us to dislike every Thing which is the least different from what we are used to; tho' by this Practice we condemn our selves without perceiving it, since our Lightness never permits us to continue long in the Approbation of any Thing. :Our Saviour himself scarce ever gave any Precepts to the Jews but under the Veil of Parables. [...] [p.33] Huet is extremely interested in changing tastes and in the relativity of judgments--he is far from any simple theory of cultural progress or decline. His concept is rather one of different functions knowledge and fictions can gain. Fables stood in the centre of his discussion so far. The next passages gain a wider perspective: :But it is not enough to have discovered The Original of Romances; we must see by what Streams they have spread and convey'd themselves into Greece, and Italy, and whether they have passed from thence to us; or we have received them from any other Nation. [p.35]  Novels of Luxury: Persia, Greece and Rome  The ancient world developed a high cultural standard. Luxury commodities became important. Persia was the country of highest refinement, producing perfumes and dances before the Milesians imported much of that culture: :But the Milesians, above all the rest, discover'd the indulging Temper, surpassed them all in the Accuracy of their Pleasures, and shew'd the most singular Taste for Delicacies. They were the first who introduced the Art of Romancing among the Persians, when they had had such Success in it themselves, that the Milesian fables, the same with Romances, full of Love Adventures, and Licentious Relations, advanced into the Highest Reputation: 'Tis probable Romances were Innocent 'till they fell into their hands, and before recounted only singular and memorable Adventures. :But these were the first who corrupted them [...] One does not have any material artefacts to prove this, yet the ancient historians help us here with their accounts. The Ionians influenced the Greeks. Alexander the Great did much to widen their cultural concepts. The Milesian Fables by Aristides of Miletus were finally translated into Latin. The book was criticized in Rome's Senate as hardly serving the purposes of a Rome involved in wars. Huet mentions names and develops a canon of texts and reaches Heliodorus who has to be compared with Jamblicus, the author of the Babylonics, which have only survived in fragments: :Heliodorus excell'd him in the Desposition of his Subject, and indeed in every other Particular. Hitherto the World had not seen any thing better designed, and more compleat in Romance, than the Adventures of Theagenes and Chariclia: Nothing can be more chaste than their Loves. By this it appears, (beside the Honour of the Christian Reli<50>gion which he professed) that he had in his own Nature such an Air of Virtue, as shines throughout the Work; in which not only Jambicus, but almost all the rest, are much his Inferiors. His Merit advanc'd him to the Dignity of an Episcopal See: He was Bishop of Tricca, a City of Thessaly. Socrates reports, that he introduced into that Diocese, the Custom of Deposing such of the Clergy, as did not abstain from the Women they had contracted before their Admission into Orders. This makes me very much suspect what Nicephorus, a credulous Writer, of little Judgement or Sincerity relates; That a Provincial Synod, understanding<51> the Danger which the Reading this Romance (so highly Authorised by the Dignity of its Author) might expose Young People to; proposed, that he should either consent to the Burning of his Book, or the Resignation of his Bishoprick; and that he accepted the latter of the Conditions.[p.51] Achilles Tatius' Leucippe and Clitophon enters the canon, and Huet is uncertain about the chronology of events: :However, he is not to be compared to Heliodorus, either for the Regularity of his Manners, the Variety of Events, or the Artifice of Unraveling his Plots. Indeed his Style is to be preferr'd to that of Heliodorus, because 'tis more Simple and natural; whereas the other's is more forced. Some say, that he was a Christian, and a Bishop too. 'Tis strange, that the Obscenity of his Book should be so easily forgot; and more so, that the Emperor Leo VI, sirnamed the Philosopher, should commend the Modesty of it, in an Epigram which is yet extant; and not only permit but recommend the Reading of it with the clo<54>sest Application, to all those who profess the Love of Chastity. [p.54] Then, referring to Longos and his Daphnis and Chloe: :My Judgement upon the Pastorals of Longus the Sophist, is the same with that I gave of the Two former Romances. For<78> tho' the Learned of Late Times have commended them for their Elegance and Agreement, joined to a Simplicity proper to the Nature of the Subjects; yet I can observe nothing in it, but that Simplicity, which sometimes declines to Childishness and Impertinence. There is nothing in it of Invention, or Conduct. He begins grosly in the Birth of his Shepherds, and ends with their Marriage. He never clears up his Adventures, but by Machines improper, and ill contrived. His Expressions are so obscene, that one must be somewhat a Cynic, to read them without Blushing. His Style does not deserve the Commen<79>dations it receives. 'Tis the Style of a Sophist, such as he was [...] which partakes of the Orator and Historian, tho' it be proper for neither of them. 'Tis full of Metaphors, Antitheses, Figures, which dazzle and surprise the Simple, and tickle the Ear, without satisfying the Mind; instead of Engaging the Reader, by the Novelty of Events, the Arrangement of Variety of Matter, a clear and close Narration, attended by a smooth and regular Cadence, which always advances within the Subject. :He endeavours (as all Sophists do) to entertain his Reader with Accidental Descripti<81>ons: He leads him out of the way; and while he admits him so far into a Country he did not look for, he spends and exhausts the Attention and Impatience he had to arrive at the End he proposed. [p.80] Rome does not play more than a marginal role. Huet mentions \\"Sybaritian Fables\\" and the love fiction of Ovid, yet only Petronius wrote something like a \\"romance\\" in Latin. Ovid mentions a Roman esteem of romances, Huet's comment: :Hence appears the Esteem Romances had in Rome; which is more evident, by the Romance which Petronius (one of their Consuls, and the most polished Man of his Time) composed. He disposed it into the<93> Form of a Satyr, of the same Kind which Varro invented, intermixing Prose with Verse, the Serious with the Jocose, and stiled it Menippean; because Menippus had before treated of Serious Matters in a Pleasant Style. :This Satyr of Petronius fails not to be a True Romance: It contains nothing but diverting and ingenious Fictions, tho' they are sometimes too licentious and immodest. He hides under a Disguise a fine and poignant Raillery, against the Vices of Nero's Court. What remains of it, are some incoherent Fragments, or rather Collections of some industrious Person; so that one can't exactly discern<94> the Form and Connexion of the whole Piece; tho' it appears to be conducted with Order. And 'tis probable those incoherent Parts, would compose a very Compleat Body, with the Addition of those which are lost. Tho' Petronius seems to be a very great Critic, and of an exquisite Taste in Learning; his Style does not always advance to the Delicacy of his Judgement: Something of Affectation may be observed. In some Places he's too Florid and Adorned; and degenerates from that Natural and Majestic Simplicity, which shined in the Agustan Age. [p.94]  The Northern Tradition: Fictions of a Dark Age of Ignorance  The ancient authors excelled with satires and texts which are no longer extant--a history which ended in darkness with the invasion of Germanic tribes causing the fall of the Roman empire: :Hitherto the Art of Romancing was maintained with some Splendor, but it soon decayed with Learning and the Empire; when the Furious nations of the North disseminated, with their Bodies, the Ignorance and barbarity of their Minds. Romances were hitherto composed for<101> Delight. Fabulous Histories were now introduced, because none were acquainted with the Truth. Taliessin, who lived about the Middle of the Sixth Age, under that King Arthur so famous in Romances; and Melkin, who was somewhat younger, writ the History of England, his Country, of King Arthur, and the Round Table. Bal√¶us, who has put them in his Catalogue, speaks of them, as of Authors filled with Fables. The same may be said of Hunibaldus Francus, who (as some relate) was Contemporary with Clovis, and whose History is no other but a Mass of Lies grossly conceived. [p.101] The present age--the late 17th century--has learned to live with a differentiation between fiction and fact. The Middle Ages were marked by a completely different frame of mind. Huet reaches the stories written about king Arthur and Merlin: :[...] those which contained the Atchievements of King Arthur, and the Life of Merlin.<104> :These Diverting Histories pleased the Readers, who were more ignorant than those who composed them. They did not, in those Days, trouble themselves with Researches into Antiquity, and after being informed of the Truth of what they wrote. They had the Stuff in their own Head, and went no farther than their own Invention. Thus Historians degenerated into True Romancers. :In this Age of Ignorance, the Latin Tongue, as well as Truth, was neglected and despised. The Versifiers, Composers, Inventers of tales, Jesters, and in short, all of this Country who studied what they called the Gay Science, began about the Time of Hugh<105> Capet, to set upon Romancing with great Fury; and soon over-ran France, by dispersing them. These Fables were composed in the Roman Tongue [...] The term romance was now invented--to denote the Spanish and French Language these texts were written in: :The Spaniards use the Word Romance in the same Signification with us, and call their ordinary Language by that Name. The Romain being then most universally understood, those of Provence who apply'd themselves to Fictions, made use of it in their Writings, which from thence were called Romances. [p.106] The idea of a tradition coming via Spain to Europe is thus balanced by a second option: [p. 108-09] Taliessin and Melkin were English heroes, Huet notes. The romances touching them must have been composed originally around 550.  Where Traditions Met: Europe and Another Theory of the Anthropology of Fiction  The development into the 17th century gives the Amadis of Gaul a central position [p. 114-16] and leads to Cervantes Don Quixote--which is rather a critic of \\"romances\\" than a romance itself. The following long passage gives Huet's picture of the intellectual network behind the rise of the modern novel--and of the traditions which now met: :All Europe was then overwhelmed with Darkness and Ignorance, but France, England, and Germany much less than Italy, which then produced but a small Number of Writers, and scarce any Authors of Romances. Those of that Country, who had a Mind to distinguish themselves by Learning and Knowledge, came for it to the University of Paris, which was the Mother of Sciences, and Nurse of the Learning of Europe. St. Thomas Aquinas, St. Bonaventure, the Poets Dante, and Boccace, came thither to study; and the President Fauchet produces, that the last of them took a great Part of his Novels from French Ro<121>mances; and that Petrarch, and the other Italian Poets, have rifled for their Richest Fancies, the Songs of Thiband King of Navarre, Gace's Brussez, Chastelain de Corcy, and the Old French Romances. 'Twas then, in my Opinion, that the Italians learned from us the Science of Romance; which, by their own Confession, is to be ascribed to us, as well as that of Rhyming. :Thus Spain and Italy received from us an Art, which was the Effect of our Ignorance and Barbarity, and which the Politeness of the Persians, Ionians, and Greeks had produced. As Necessity engages us, to sustain our Bodies<122> with Herbs an Roots; so when the Knowledge of Truth, which is the Proper and Natural Aliment of the Mind, begins to fail, we have Recourse to Falsehood, which is the Imitation of Truth. As in Plenty we refuse Bread, and our ordinary Viands, for Ragousts; so our Minds, when acquainted with the Truth, forsake the Study and Speculation of it, to be entertained with its Image, which is Fiction. This Imitation according to Aristotle, is often more agreeable than the Original it self; so that two oppositely different Paths, which are Ignorance and Learning, Rudeness and Politeness, do often conduct us to the same End; which is<123> an Application to Fictions, Fables, and Romances. Hence it is, that the most Barbarous Nations are taken with Romantic Inventions, as well as the most Refined. The Originals of all the Savages of America, and particularly those of Peru, are nothing but Fables; no more are those of the Goths, which they wrote in their Ancient Runic Characters, upon great Stones; the Remains of which I my self have seen in Denmark. And if any Thing were left us of the Works, which the Bards among the Ancient Gauls composed, to eternize the Memory of their Nation, I don't question but we should find them enriched with Abundance of Fictions. :This Inclination to Fables, which is common to all Men, is not the Result of Reason; Imitation, or Custom. 'Tis Natural to them, and has its Seat in the very Frame and Disposition of their Soul. For the Desire of Knowledge is particular to man, and distinguishes him from Beasts no less than his Reason. nay we may observe in other Creatures some Rude Impressions of this; whereas the Desire of Understanding is Peculiar to Us only. :The Reason of this, according to my Opinion, is; because the Faculties of the Soul are too Vast an Extent, to be supplied by the Present Objects, so that 'tis obliged to<125> have recourse to what's past, and to come, in Truth and in Fictions, in Imaginary Spaces and Impossibilities, for Objects to exert it self upon. The Objects of Sense fill the Desires of the Soul of Brutes, who have no farther Concern; so that we can't discover in them these restless Emotions, which continually actuate the Mind of Man, and carry it into the Pursuit of a recent Information, to proportion (if possible the Object to the Faculty; and enjoy a Pleasure resembling that which we perceive in the Appeasing a Violent Hunger, and Extinguishing a Corroding Thirst. This is that which Plato intends, in the Marriage of Do-<126>rus and Penia, (in which Terms he would express Riches and Poverty,) which produces exquisite Pleasure. The Object is signified by Riches, which are not so but in Use and Intention; otherwise they are unfruitful and afford no Delight. The Faculty is intended by Inquietude, while 'tis separated from Riches; whereas its Union with them, supplies the Highest Satisfaction. The Case is the same with our Souls: Poverty, the same with Ignorance, is Natural to it; it sighs continually after Science; which is its Riches; and when 'tis possess'd of this Enjoyment, it feels the greatest Pleasure. But<127> this Pleasure is not always equal; it often is the Purchase of much labour and Difficulty: As when the Soul applies it self to intricate Speculations, and Occult Sciences, the Matter whereof is not present to our Senses; where the Imagination, which acts with Faculity, has a Less Part in the Pursuit than the Understanding, whose Operations are more Vehement and Intense: And because Labour is naturally tedious, the Soul is not carried to Hard and Spinous Learning, unless in Prospect of some Advantage, or Hope of some remote Amusement, or else by Necessity. But the Knowledge which attracts and delights it most, is that which is acquired without<128> Pain and where the Imagination alone acts on Subjects which fall under our Sense, ravish our Passions, and are great Movers in all the Affairs of Life. Such are Romances, which require no great Intention or Dispense of Mind, to understand them. No long Reasonings are exacted; the Memory is not overburthened: Nothing is demanded, but Fancy and Imagination. They move our Passions; but 'tis on purpose to sooth and calm them again: They excite neither Fear nor Compassion; [u]nless it be to display to us the Pleasure of seeing those we are afraid, or concern'd for, out of Reach of Danger or Distress. In short, all our Emo<129>tions there find themselves agreeably provoked and appeased. :'Tis hence, that those who act more by [Passion than Reason], and labour more with their Imagination than Understanding, are affected by them; tho' these other are touched by them too, but after another manner. These are touched by the Beauties of Art, which amuse the Understanding; but the former, Ignorant and Simple, are sensible of no more than what strikes upon the Imagination, and stirs their Passions. They love the Fiction, and enquire no farther. Now Fictions being nothing but Narrations, True in Appearance, and False in Reality; the Minds of the Simple, who discern on<130>ly the Disguise, are pleased and highly satisfied with this Shew of Truth. But those who penetrate farther, and see into the Solid, are easily disgusted with the Falsity: So that the first love Falsehood, because it is concealed under an Appearance of Truth; the Latter are distasted with the Image of Truth, because of the Real Forgery which is couched under it; unless it be varnished with Ingenuity, Subtility, and Instruction, and recommends it self by the Excellency of Invention and Art. St Augustin makes this Observation somewhere; 'That these Falsities which carry a Signification, and suggest an Hidden Meaning, are not Lies,<131> but the Figures of Truth; which the most Wise and Holy Persons, and even our Saviour himself, have used upon Honourable and Pious Occasions.' :Since then 'tis true, that Lies commonly flow from Ignorance, and the Grossness of our Intellect; and that this Inundation of the Barbarians, who issued from the North, spread over all Europe, and plunged it into such profound Ignorance, as it could not clear it self from, within the Space of Two Ages; is it not then probable, that this Ignorance caused the same Effect in Europe, which it had produced every where besides? And is it not vain to enquire for that in<132> Chance, which we find in Nature? There is then no Reason to contend, but that the French, German, and English Romances, and all the Fables of the North, are Fruits of those Countries, and not imported from Abroad: That they never had other Originals than the Histories stuffed with Falsities, and made in Obscure Ignorant Times, when there was neither Industry nor Curiosity to discover the Truth of Things, nor Art to describe it, if 'twas found: That these Histories have been well received by the Unpolished and Half-barbarous People; and that the Historians thereupon took upon them the Liberty to pre<133>sent them with what was purely forged, which were the Romances. The whole development of fiction is thus not one of continuities-- but one of different traditions and complex reasons why fictions develop. Huet reaches the present age and passes through numerous titles:  Fictions and the Modern Period  :I shall not undertake to [...] examine whether Amadis de Gaul were originally from Spain, Flanders, or France; and whether the Romance of Tiel Ulespiegel be a Translation from the German; or in what Language the Romance of the Seven Wise Men of Greece was first written; or that of Dolopathos, which some say was extracted from the Parables of Sandaber the Indian. Some say 'tis to be found in Greek in some Libraries; which has furnished the Matter of an Italian Book call'd Erastus, (and of many of Boccace his Novels, as the same Fauchet has remarked) which was written in La-<137>tin by John Morck, or the Abby de Hauteselne, whereof Ancient Copies are to be seen; and translated into French by the Clerk Hubert, about the End of the Twelfth Age, and into High Dutch about Three Hundred Years afterwards; and an Hundred Years after that, from High Dutch into Latin again, by a Learned hand, who changed the Names of it, and was ignorant that the Dutch had come from the Latin. :It shall suffice if I tell you, that all these Works which Ignorance has given Birth to, carried along with them the Marks of their Original, and were no other than a Complication of<138> Fictions, grossly cast together in the greatest Confusion, and infinitely short of the Excellent Degree of Art and Elegance, to which the French Nation is now arrived in Romances. 'Tis truly a Subject of Admiration, that we, who have yielded to others the Bays for Epic Poetry, and History, have nevertheless advanced these to so high a Perfection, that the Best of theirs are not Equal to the Meanest of ours. :We owe (I believe) this Advantage to the Refinement and Politeness of our Gallantry; which proceeds, in my Opinion, from the great Liberty which the Men of France allow to the<139> Ladies. They are in a manner Recluses in Italy and Spain; and separated from Men by so many Obstacles, that they are scarce to be seen, and not to be spoken with at all. Hence the Men have neglected the Art of Engaging the Tender Sex, because the Occasions of it are so rare. All the Study and Business there, is to surmount the Difficulties of Access; when this is effected, they make Use of the Time, without amusing themselves with Forms. But in France, the Ladies go at large upon their Parole; and being under no Custody but that of their own Heart, erect it into a Fort, more strong and secure than<140> all the Keys, Grates, and Vigilance of the Douegnas. The Men are obliged to make a Regular and Formal Assault against this Fort, to employ so much Industry and Address to reduce it, that they have formed it into an Art scarce known to other Nations. :'Tis this Art which distinguishes the French from other Romances, and renders the Reading of them so Delicious, that they cause more Profitable Studies to be neglected. :The Ladies were first taken with this Lure: They made Romances their Study; and have despised the Ancient Fa<141>ble and History so far, that they now no longer understand those Works, from which they received their greatest Embellishments: And lest they should blush at this Ignorance, which they find themselves so often guilty of; they perceive they had better disapprove what they don't know, than take the Pains to learn it. :The Men, in Complaisance, have imitated them; condemned what they disliked, and call that Pedantry, which made an Essential Part of Politeness, even in Malherbe's Time. The Poets, and other French Writers who succeeded, have been constrained to submit to this Arbi<142>tration; and many of them, observing that the Knowledge of Antiquity would be of no Advantage to them, have ceased to study what they durst not practise: Thus a very Good Cause has produced an Ill Effect; and the Beauty of our Romances has drawn upon them the Contempt of Good Letters, and consequently Ignorance. :I don't, for all this, pretend to condemn the Reading of them. The Best Things in the World are attended with their Inconveniencies; Romances too may have much worse than Ignorance. I know what they are accused for: They exhaust our Devotion, and in<143>spire us with Irregular Passions, and corrupt our Manner. All this may be, and sometimes does happen. But what can't Evil and Degenerated Minds make an Ill Use of? Weak Souls are contagious to themselves, and make Poyson of every Thing. Histories must be forbidden, which relate so many Pernicious Examples; and the Fable must undergo the same Fate; for there Crimes are authorised by the Practice of the Gods. [...<144>] :Little Regard was had to Sobriety of manners, in most Part of the Greek and Old French Romances, by Reason of the Vice of the Times in which they were composed. [...] But the Modern Romances (I speak of the Good ones) are so far from this Fault, that you'll scarce find an Expression, or Word, which may shock Chaste Ears, or one single Action which may give Offence to Modesty. :If any one object; That Love is treated of in a Manner so Soft and Insinuating, that the Bait of this Dangerous Passion invades too easily the Tender Hearts; I answer, That it is so far from being Dangerous, that it is in some Respects Necessary, that the Young People of the World should be acquainted with it; that they may stop their Ears to that which is Criminal, and be better fortified against its Artifices; and know their Conduct, in that which has an Honest and Sacred End. This is so true, that Experience lays before us, that such as are least acquainted with Love, are the most unguarded to its As<145>saults, that the most Ignorant are soonest decoyed. Add to this that Nothing so much refines and polishes Wit; Nothing conduces so much to the Forming and Advancing it to the Approbation of the World, as the Reading of Romances. These are the Dumb Tutors, which succeed those of the College, and teach us how to Live and Speak by a more Persuasive and Instructive method than theirs [...]. [p.145] Huet has with this survey reached the end of his treatise. D'Urfee and Mademoiselle de Scudery become important here: :Monsieur D'Urfee was the first who retrieved them from Barbarity, and reduced them to Rules, in his Incomparable Astrea, The most Ingenious and Polite Work which has appeared in this Kind, and which Eclipsed the Glory which Greece, Italy and Spain, had acquired. [...<146>] :None can, without Amazement, read those which a Maid as Illustrious in her Modesty, as her Merit, has published under a Borrowed Name; depriving her self so Generously of that Glory which was her Due, and not seeking for Reward, but in her Virtue; as if while She took so much Trouble for the Honour of our Nation, She would spare that Shame to Our Sex. But Time has done her that Justice, which she had denied her self; and has informed us, that the Illustrious Bassa, Grand Cyrus, and Cl√¶lia, are the Performances of Madam de Scudery [...]. The last lines refer to the following \\"history\\" Zayde--which will, so Huet, deserve all praise: :The Virtues which conduct his Reign are so Noble, and the Fortune which attend them so Surprizing, that Posterity would doubt whether it were a History, or a Romance.

The Mortlock Library, part of the State Library of South Australia, forms the west side of the courtyard at the front of the South Australian Museum South Australian Museum The South Australian Museum is a natural history museum and research institution in Adelaide, South Australia, founded in 1856 and owned by the Government of South Australia. It occupies a complex of buildings on North Terrace in the cultural precinct of the Adelaide Parklands. Plans are under way to split its Australian Aboriginal cultural collection (the largest in the world), some of which will be housed in a new building housing these along with other works of art, in a new National Gallery for Aboriginal Art and Cultures. History =19th century= The South Australian Institute, incorporating a public library and a museum, was established in 1861 in the rented premises of the Library and Mechanics' Institute in King William Street while awaiting construction of the Institute building on the corner of North Terrace and Kintore Avenue.The Institute building was officially opened on 29 January 1861 and is still in use as part of the State Library of South Australia. In June 1856 the South Australian Legislative Council passed Act No. 16 of 1855‚Äì6, the South Australian Institute Act (An Act to establish and incorporate an Institution to be called the South Australian Institute), which incorporated the South Australian Institute under the control of a Board of Governors, to whose ownership all materials belonging to the old Library and Mechanics' Institute was immediately transferred. The Act provided for a library and a museum as part of the new organisation. Frederick George Waterhouse offered his services as curator of the South Australian Institute Museum in June 1859 in an honorary capacity. When the Institute building was completed, the Board appointed him as the first curator, a position he held until his retirement in February 1882. He was succeeded by Wilhelm Haacke, who in January 1883 recommended the South Australian Institute Museum be renamed the South Australian Museum (which did not happen then), and the position of Curator be changed to Director. Haacke was appointed the first Director, but only held the position until he resigned in October 1884 after a series of disputes with the Museum's management =20th century= The Museum Act (1939) gave the South Australian Museum autonomy from the Art Gallery and Library, and the South Australian Institute Museum was officially renamed the South Australian Museum. This legislation was superseded by the South Australian Museum Act (1976). At some point between 1996 and 2002, the Museum became part of Arts SA. In 1997, championed by state Arts Minister Diana Laidlaw, the SA Museum was funded to develop its ground floor Australian Aboriginal Cultures Gallery. =21st century= The following decade, Mike Rann, Premier and Arts Minister from 2002 to 2011, funded the redevelopment of the Pacific Cultures Gallery and the development of the South Australian Biodiversity Gallery.Annual Report of the South Australian Museum Board, 2008-2009 Accessed 10 September 2014. In 2011 Mr Rann appointed former Adelaide Lord Mayor and Education Minister Jane Lomax-Smith AM as chair of the Museum Board.Former Rann Cabinet minister Jane Lomax-Smith to chair South Australian Museum The Advertiser, 19 August 2011. Accessed 10 September 2014. Management and governance The official role of the museum, as per the 2017/8 annual report, is: Its vision is to \\"...use [its] world-class collections to create and share new knowledge, focusing on Australian Aboriginal and Pacific cultures, Earth and Life Sciences\\". The Director is Brian Oldman (appointed December 2013). As a statutory corporation, management of the museum is prescribed under the South Australian Museum Act 1976 and State and Federal Government regulations. The museum was a division of Arts South Australia (previously Arts SA) within the Department of State Development until 2018. After the election of the Marshall government in March 2018, the Arts Ministry was removed, Arts SA was dismantled and its functions were transferred to direct oversight by the Department of the Premier and Cabinet. The Board of eight people appointed by the Minister, still chaired by Lomax-Smith, oversees the management of the Museum. =New Aboriginal cultural centre= The South Australian government is committed to splitting the Museum, retaining a natural history museum on its existing site and creating a new gallery for Aboriginal art and culture on the site of the old Royal Adelaide Hospital, now known as Lot Fourteen. In early 2019 a consultation process was begun, involving the state government, the Museum, the Art Gallery of South Australia, the State Library, Tandanya National Aboriginal Cultural Institute and South Australia's Aboriginal communities, in particular the Kaurna. An update on the Lot Fourteen gallery was announced by Premier Steven Marshall in February 2020, with a scheduled completion date of 2023. Collections The museum houses over four million objects and specimens. Permanent galleries include: * Ancient Egypt * Australian Aboriginal Cultures * Australian Polar Collection * Ediacaran Fossils * Megafauna * Minerals and Meteorites * Opal Fossils, including gembones * Pacific Cultures * South Australian Biodiversity * Whales and Dolphins * World Mammals =Indigenous artefacts collection= The museum contains the most significant collection of Australian Aboriginal cultural artefacts in the world, housing about 30,000 objects. This collection, along with several others in the museum, is being digitised, with many images and a great deal of data about each item now available for online browsing. In 2016, a private benefactor, Margaret Davy AM, provided funding for a new position for an Indigenous curator for five years, which she requested be named in honour of her late husband, William Geary. This position is known as The William and Margaret Geary Curator of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Art and Material Culture, with the first appointee being Glenn Iseger- Pilkington, a Wadjarri, Nhanda and Nyoongar man from Western Australia with a background in art curating. This was the first time in the history of the museum that a lead curatorial role had been designated for an Indigenous person, and it is hoped that the collection will be developed in a way informed by Indigenous voices and worldview, and also help to make it, in the words of Iseger-Pilkington, \\"more relevant and accessible to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities\\". The museum holds the biggest collection of carvings by Arrernte artist and anthropological interpreter Erlikilyika, also known as Jim Kite, who lived at the tiny and remote European settlement at Charlotte Waters telegraph station. It also holds a bound sketchbook of 24 pencil drawings of native trees, created during the Spencer and Gillen expedition and bought by Herbert Basedow before being acquired by the Museum, as well as photographs of \\"Jimmy Kite\\" and other related materials. Repatriation of human remains A new museum policy has committed to the repatriation of returning the ancestral remains of about 4600 Old People, currently held in storage at the museum, to Country. Some of the remains now being returned from overseas institutions were \\"collected\\" by men like former Museum Director Edward C. Stirling, University of Adelaide Professor Archibald Watson and physician and city coroner William Ramsay Smith (who also bought remains stolen from burial grounds at Hindmarsh Island). However these numbers are small when compared with the vast majority of the remains, which were disturbed by land clearing, construction projects or members of the public. An Aboriginal heritage and repatriation manager, Anna Russo, was appointed in 2018 as part of a wider restructure to make repatriation and Aboriginal agency a priority for the museum. Kaurna elder Jeffrey Newchurch had been lobbying the museum for years, and SAM Head of Humanities John Carty said the Museum was one of the last cultural institutions in Australia to return ownership and management of ancestral remains to Aboriginal people. On 1 August 2019, the remains of 11 Kaurna people were laid to rest at a ceremony led by Newchurch at Kingston Park Coastal Reserve. Carty said the museum was \\"passionate\\" about working with the Kaurna people to repatriate their ancestors, and would also be helping to educate the community about what it means to Aboriginal people. The Museum continues to receive further remains, and together with the community would need to find a good solution to accommodate the many remains of Old People, such as a memorial park.

Before this exhibition, there were fewer than 20 known Nukunu objects held by the Museum, mostly made by Nukunu man Paddy Thompson and acquired by anthropologist Norman Tindale in the 1920s. The specially commissioned piti (coolamon), thiparra (shields), wadna (boomerangs), yakadi (walking sticks) and wirri (clubs) have added to the historic items to illustrate the continuation of the tradition. Roy Coulthard is a third-generation carver in his family, who visits schools to share his knowledge. With this exhibition, SAM is adopting the practice of naming artists and identifying works for their individual artistry rather than their ethnic identity.

Cultural references The island is the fictional setting of Nigel Tranter's 1952 novel Bridal Path, which was made into the film of the same name in 1959. As the comic novel takes the perils of island inbreeding as its theme, it is assumed that Tranter deliberately chose an unpopulated island to avoid giving offence.

Locals on Mull joke that the island is \\"heaving with adders\\" although this may not be entirely true. Red deer are good swimmers and could easily make the crossing if they wanted.

Since 1920 she was under the Polish banner. Named Lw√≥w, after the third biggest city of the Second Polish Republic, she cruised the whole world in the 1920s, being the first ship under Polish banner to have crossed the Equator, during a cruise to Brazil in 1923. She was also the first Polish training ship. Her notable captains included Mamert Stankiewicz. She was eventually replaced as the Polish training ship by the newer Dar Pomorza. She was briefly used as a hulk by Polish Navy; retired in 1938, and was scrapped soon afterwards in the Baltic Sea port of Gdynia. Captain and marine writer Karol Olgierd Borchardt named Lw√≥w \\"The cradle of navigators of the Polish Navy\\". Under British, Italian and Dutch flags Lw√≥w In Rio de Janeiro. Little is known about the fate of the British frigate Chinsura. Made of steel, she was launched in 1869 in Birkenhead, by the British charterer G. R. Cloover and Co., and belonged to Thomas & Brocklenbank, a company from Liverpool. Her total length was 85.1 meters, with a beam of 11.4 meters and a draught of 6.9 meters. Speed was 12.5 knots, propulsion being provided by sails together with two Kromhout engines (added in early 1920s). She sailed on routes from Great Britain to India and Australia, carrying goods and passengers. In 1893 the Chinsura was bought by the Italian company Fratelli Olvarii from Camogli, the name being changed to Lucco. Under that name, she served for only five years, as in 1898 she was caught by a huge storm near the Cape of Good Hope, in which it lost masts and almost sank. Nevertheless, the Lucco reached Durban, where she was refitted and soon afterwards purchased by P. Landberg & Zoon, a Dutch charterer from Batavia, which gave her yet another name, Nest. In 1915, after serving for several years in southeastern Asia, the Nest came to the Netherlands, where she was anchored in Vlaardingen near Rotterdam and remained inactive. Under Polish colours Some time in mid-1920, the Nest was noticed by a Polish commission under Captain Gustaw Kanski, who was the inspector of State Marine School in Tczew. Kanski liked the well-preserved, 51-year-old ship and arranged the purchase. After repairs, made by a private company of brothers Van der Windt from Vlaardingen, in July 1921, she came to Tczew (the seaport of Gdynia did not exist yet) and was renamed Lw√≥w, becoming Poland's first training ship. Her first captain was Tadeusz Bonifacy Ziolkowski, an experienced sailor, who had served in the German Navy during World War I. On 4 September 1921, after a special ceremony, the Lw√≥w officially became part of the freshly created Polish Navy. Her banner was funded by women living in the city of Lw√≥w, and she was handed to Captain Ziolkowski by President of the city of Lw√≥w, dr. Stahl. Among other captains were Mamert Stankiewicz (1924‚Äì1926) and Konstanty Maciejewicz (1926‚Äì1930). =First years= Between 1921 and 1929, Lw√≥w did not only serve as a training ship, but also carried goods, to provide funds for her existence. Lw√≥w served on several lines, cruising the Baltic Sea, the North Sea, Black Sea, Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean. On 13 August 1923, she was the first ship under Polish banner to cross the Equator, during a cruise to Brazil. Until 1927, she was intensely exploited, as only then the Poles purchased additional ships from France, including the Wilno and the Wilia (the latter one transported remains of Juliusz S≈Çowacki to Gdynia and was escorted by the Lw√≥w). =Late years= In 1929 Lw√≥w went on her last cruise, to Hanko in Finland and then returned to Gdynia, to be replaced with Dar Pomorza.zegluj.net The banner was moved during a special ceremony on 13 July 1930, together with whole crew and some parts of equipment. The ship was transferred to the Polish Navy, which used her as a hulk for crews of submarines. Several navy enthusiasts suggested that Lw√≥w, regarded as a legendary ship, should be preserved as a monument or a museum. However, these wishes were not fulfilled. On 25 September 1937, she was erased from the Lloyd's Register. In early 1938 the ship was retired and scrapped in May of that year in Gdynia. According to other sources, she survived until the beginning of World War II, and only then was scrapped by the Germans. It has been estimated that the ship altogether crossed almost .

Early life and career  Dan Mitrione was born in Italy, the second son of Joseph and Maria Mitrione. The family immigrated to America soon after Dan's birth, settling in Richmond, Indiana, where Mitrione grew up. Mitrione married Henrietta Lind while serving on a Michigan naval base during World War II, and the couple eventually had nine children. After the war ended, Mitrione became a police officer in Richmond. He started as a patrolman in 1945, rising through the ranks until he was hired as the Richmond chief of police in 1956, a position which he held until 1960.  Career in the Office of Public Safety  In 1960, Mitrione joined the Public Safety program of the International Cooperation Administration (ICA). The program, begun in 1954, provided U.S. aid and training to civilian police in third world countries around the world. Mitrione's first post was in Belo Horizonte, a large city about 250 miles northwest of Rio de Janeiro. During the two years Mitrione was posted in Belo Horizonte, ICA was replaced by the United States Agency for International Development, and the police aid program was reorganized into the Office of Public Safety (OPS). After two years in Belo Horizonte, Mitrione was transferred to Rio de Janeiro in 1962, where he served as a training adviser for another five years. In 1967, he was rotated back to the United States and taught for two years at the OPS International Police Academy in Washington, D.C. = Uruguay, 1969-1970 = In 1969, Mitrione was appointed the OPS Chief Public Safety Adviser in Montevideo, Uruguay. In this period the Uruguayan government, led by the Colorado Party, had its hands full with a collapsing economy, labor and student strikes, and the Tupamaros, a left-wing urban terrorism guerrilla group. On the other hand, Washington feared a possible victory during the elections of the Frente Amplio, a left-wing coalition, on the model of the also-Cuban-supported victory of the Unidad Popular government in Chile, led by Salvador Allende, in 1970.Nixon: \\"Brazil Helped Rig the Uruguayan Elections\\", 1971, National Security Archive Electronic Briefing Book No. 71, June 20, 2002 The OPS had been helping the local police since 1965, providing them with weapons and training. Former Uruguayan police officials and CIA operatives stated Mitrione had taught torture techniques to Uruguayan police in the cellar of his Montevideo home, including the use of electrical shocks delivered to his victims' mouths and genitals. New Times (Broward-Palm Beach, FL, August 11, 2005) He also helped train foreign police agents in the United States in the context of the Cold War. It has been alleged that he used homeless people for training purposes, who were executed once they had served their purpose.\\"Dan Mitrione, un maestro de la tortura\\", Clar√≠n, September 2, 2001 Mitrione was kidnapped by the Tupamaros on July 31, 1970 demanding the release of 150 political prisoners.Langguth, p. 22 The Uruguayan government, with U.S. backing, refused and Mitrione was later found dead in a car, shot twice in the head and with no other visible signs of maltreatment (beyond the fact that during the kidnapping, Mitrione had been shot in one shoulder, a wound that had evidently been treated while in captivity). In his autobiography (Ambassador Ortiz, Lessons from a Life of Service, Albuquerque, University of New Mexico Press, 2005, p. 106), Frank V. Ortiz whose appointment as Deputy Chief of Mission at the United States Embassy in Montevideo coincided with the kidnapping and killing of Mitrione, wrote: \\"My first duty, on my first day in Montevideo, was to attend a memorial service for Dan Mitrione, a former state chief of police from New Mexico who headed a U.S. mission to train the Uruguayan police to combat terrorism. Just four days before we [Ortiz and his family] arrived, the Tupamaros had kidnapped Mitrione during a carefully organized operation against American Embassy officials. They also captured the head of the commercial section of the embassy by hitting him on the head, wrapping him in a rug, and tying him down in the back of a pickup. Fortunately, he worked his ties loose and jumped out of the pickup while it was speeding down the road. The terrorists also tried to take the cultural attach√©. They jumped him in the garage of his apartment building, but he honked his car horn, attracting attention and scaring off his would-be captors. But poor Mitrione--they tied him up, tortured him and finally killed him.\\" In 1987, two years after being released from prison, the leader of the Tupamaros, Ra√∫l Sendic, said in an interview that Mitrione had been selected for kidnapping because he had trained police in riot control, and as retaliation for the deaths of student protestors. He did not mention the accusations of torture. In addition, Sendic also revealed that Mitrione's death was unintended; the Tupamaro leaders had decided to keep Mitrione alive and hold him indefinitely instead of killing him if the government continued to refuse their demands. On August 7, 1970, just a week after the kidnapping, the Uruguayan police raided the house where the Tupamaro leadership was staying and captured Sendic and the others. A short time later, he said, the replacement leadership, which also knew of the plan to keep Mitrione alive, was also captured. \\"Those captured lost all contact with the others,\\" he said, \\"and when the deadline came the group that was left with Mitrione did not know what to do.

A convicted child molester and sexual predator, she sexually molested a 13-year- old boy who was one of her students in Centertown Elementary School. As of October 2020, she is still in jail having already spent more than 12 years in prison (since 2006 with a brief period of probation between 2012/2015). Background Born on 1st July 1977, Turner attended Tennessee Technological University and Cumberland University, playing basketball for both. Tenn. community's image of teacher shattered by charges of sex with 13-year-old student  News  wcfcourier.com Crime According to court documentation, Rogers had sex with the student on at least 12 occasions, including oral, vaginal, and manual sex, as well as having the student engage in oral sex and digital penetration on her.Another Teacher Nabbed For Student Sex  The Smoking Gun Criminal prosecution Rogers faced 15 counts of sexual battery by an authority figure and 13 counts of statutory rape on February 4, 2005. The charges stemmed from her three-month relationship with a teenage boy. She was 27 years old at the time of the relationship. Following her arrest, she posted bail of $50,000. When originally charged, she pleaded not guilty. On August 12 2005, Rogers pleaded no contest to four charges of sexual battery by an authority figure as part of a deal with the prosecution. Her sentence was 270 days (about nine months) in the Warren County jail in Tennessee. During an eight-year suspended sentence, she also had to serve a term of seven years and three months of probation, surrender her teaching certificate, and register as a sex offender for life because sexual battery by an authority figure is a \\"violent sexual offense\\" under the law of the state of Tennessee.http://law.justia.com/codes/tennessee/2010/title-40/chapter-39/part-2/40-39-202 The sentence not only prohibits her from profiting from the case (including books and movies), but also bars her from granting interviews for eight years. It also effectively ended her teaching career, as most states will not issue a teaching license to a convicted felon. Rogers was arrested again on April 24, 2006 on charges that she had sent text messages, nude photos, and sex videos of herself to the same boy while using her father's cellphone. She was also charged for communicating with the boy via blogs and a website. The judge ordered Rogers to remain in jail until her next court hearing. On July 14, 2006, she was sentenced to seven years in prison for violating her probation by sending explicit videos to her former victim and maintaining contact with him via online blogs. Rogers asked for mercy and apologized to her family and the teen's family, saying tearfully to the judge, \\"I have humiliated myself. What I did was wrong, I am willing to do anything to rehabilitate myself.\\" She asked for local incarceration with therapy. Circuit Judge Bart Stanley denied her request saying, \\"You have done everything except show this court that you wanted to rehabilitate yourself.\\" He revoked Rogers' probation and ordered her to serve the rest of a seven-year prison sentence at the Tennessee Prison for Women.Ex-Teacher Ignores Probation Order About.com Rogers received two additional years of prison time in January 2007, after she pleaded guilty to sending nude photos of herself to the boy.Ex-Teacher Gets 2 More Years for Photos January 10, 2007. After her release from prison, Rogers was arrested again in June 2015, in a separate case where she allegedly conspired with two current inmates to smuggle cell phones into the state prison where she had been incarcerated. She is still in prison held on $50,000 bond; her arrest brought national attention to the problem of cellphones as illegal contraband in prisons. This, and a television documentary (Twisted: Teachers Who Prey) about her sexual abuse, made her a famous example of teachers sexual abuse, but the price was the possibility of many more years in jail (6 to 30 years if convicted). Personal life  In 1997, Turner was Ms. Monday Nitro in World Championship Wrestling at Spring Break festivities. She married Christopher Turner, a high school basketball coach, in 2003. He filed for divorce in January 2005, around the time of her indictment. Separated since 2004, the couple was already experiencing marital difficulties when her legal troubles came to light. In July 2017 her brother Alvin Rogers was arrested. Charges included rape involving a minor.INVESTIGATION CONTINUES REGARDING MAN CHARGED WITH RAPE, HIS SISTER PREVIOUSLY CONVICTED OF SEX CRIMES ‚Äì 105.7 News Crossville Rockwood Knoxville TN See also * Female-male statutory rape * Mary Kay Letourneau * Debra Lafave Notes References *Felony Offender Information TOMIS ID: 00396311 *Jail For Teacher In Sex Case Aug. 12, 2005 Category:1977 births Category:Living people Category:American people convicted of child sexual abuse Category:Schoolteachers from Tennessee Category:American sex offenders Category:People from McMinnville, Tennessee Category:Prisoners and detainees of Tennessee Category:School sexual abuse scandals Category:21st-century American criminals Category:American female criminals Category:Tennessee Technological University alumni Category:Cumberland University alumni ","title":"Pamela Rogers Turner"},{"id":"2446313","text":"Line breaking, also known as word wrapping, is breaking a section of text into lines so that it will fit into the available width of a page, window or other display area. In text display, line wrap is continuing on a new line when a line is full, so that each line fits into the viewable window, allowing text to be read from top to bottom without any horizontal scrolling. Word wrap is the additional feature of most text editors, word processors, and web browsers, of breaking lines between words rather than within words, where possible. Word wrap makes it unnecessary to hard-code newline delimiters within paragraphs, and allows the display of text to adapt flexibly and dynamically to displays of varying sizes. Soft and hard returns A soft return or soft wrap is the break resulting from line wrap or word wrap (whether automatic or manual), whereas a hard return or hard wrap is an intentional break, creating a new paragraph. With a hard return, paragraph- break formatting can (and should) be applied (either indenting or vertical whitespace). Soft wrapping allows line lengths to adjust automatically with adjustments to the width of the user's window or margin settings, and is a standard feature of all modern text editors, word processors, and email clients. Manual soft breaks are unnecessary when word wrap is done automatically, so hitting the \\"Enter\\" key usually produces a hard return. Alternatively, \\"soft return\\" can mean an intentional, stored line break that is not a paragraph break. For example, it is common to print postal addresses in a multiple-line format, but the several lines are understood to be a single paragraph. Line breaks are needed to divide the words of the address into lines of the appropriate length. In the contemporary graphical word processors Microsoft Word and OpenOffice.org, users are expected to type a carriage return () between each paragraph. Formatting settings, such as first-line indentation or spacing between paragraphs, take effect where the carriage return marks the break. A non-paragraph line break, which is a soft return, is inserted using or via the menus, and is provided for cases when the text should start on a new line but none of the other side effects of starting a new paragraph are desired. In text-oriented markup languages, a soft return is typically offered as a markup tag. For example, in HTML there is a <br> tag that has the same purpose as the soft return in word processors described above. =Unicode= The Unicode Line Breaking Algorithm determines a set of positions, known as break opportunities, that are appropriate places in which to begin a new line. The actual line break positions are picked from among the break opportunities by the higher level software that calls the algorithm, not by the algorithm itself, because only the higher level software knows about the width of the display the text is displayed on and the width of the glyphs that make up the displayed text. The Unicode character set provides a line separator character as well as a paragraph separator to represent the semantics of the soft return and hard return. :0x2028 LINE SEPARATOR : * may be used to represent this semantic unambiguously :0x2029 PARAGRAPH SEPARATOR : * may be used to represent this semantic unambiguously Word boundaries, hyphenation, and hard spaces The soft returns are usually placed after the ends of complete words, or after the punctuation that follows complete words. However, word wrap may also occur following a hyphen inside of a word. This is sometimes not desired, and can be blocked by using a non-breaking hyphen, or hard hyphen, instead of a regular hyphen. A word without hyphens can be made wrappable by having soft hyphens in it. When the word isn't wrapped (i.e., isn't broken across lines), the soft hyphen isn't visible. But if the word is wrapped across lines, this is done at the soft hyphen, at which point it is shown as a visible hyphen on the top line where the word is broken. (In the rare case of a word that is meant to be wrappable by breaking it across lines but without making a hyphen ever appear, a zero-width space is put at the permitted breaking point(s) in the word.) Sometimes word wrap is undesirable between adjacent words. In such cases, word wrap can usually be blocked by using a hard space or non-breaking space between the words, instead of regular spaces. Word wrapping in text containing Chinese, Japanese, and Korean In Chinese, Japanese, and Korean, word wrapping can usually occur before and after any Han character, but certain punctuation characters are not allowed to begin a new line.. Japanese kana, letters of the Japanese alphabet, are treated the same way as Han Characters (Kanji) by extension, meaning words can, and tend to be broken without any hyphen or other indication that this has happened. Under certain circumstances, however, word wrapping is not desired. For instance, * word wrapping might not be desired within personal names, and * word wrapping might not be desired within any compound words (when the text is flush left but only in some styles). Most existing word processors and typesetting software cannot handle either of the above scenarios. CJK punctuation may or may not follow rules similar to the above- mentioned special circumstances. It is up to line breaking rules in CJK. A special case of line breaking rules in CJK, however, always applies: line wrap must never occur inside the CJK dash and ellipsis. Even though each of these punctuation marks must be represented by two characters due to a limitation of all existing character encodings, each of these are intrinsically a single punctuation mark that is two ems wide, not two one-em-wide punctuation marks. Algorithm Word wrapping is an optimization problem. Depending on what needs to be optimized for, different algorithms are used. = Minimum number of lines = A simple way to do word wrapping is to use a greedy algorithm that puts as many words on a line as possible, then moving on to the next line to do the same until there are no more words left to place. This method is used by many modern word processors, such as OpenOffice.org Writer and Microsoft Word. This algorithm always uses the minimum possible number of lines but may lead to lines of widely varying lengths. The following pseudocode implements this algorithm: SpaceLeft := LineWidth for each Word in Text if (Width(Word) + SpaceWidth) > SpaceLeft insert line break before Word in Text SpaceLeft := LineWidth - Width(Word) else SpaceLeft := SpaceLeft - (Width(Word) + SpaceWidth) Where \`LineWidth\` is the width of a line, \`SpaceLeft\` is the remaining width of space on the line to fill, \`SpaceWidth\` is the width of a single space character, \`Text\` is the input text to iterate over and \`Word\` is a word in this text. = Minimum raggedness = A different algorithm, used in TeX, minimizes the sum of the squares of the lengths of the spaces at the end of lines to produce a more aesthetically pleasing result. The following example compares this method with the greedy algorithm, which does not always minimize squared space. For the input text AAA BB CC DDDDD with line width 6, the greedy algorithm would produce: \\\\------ Line width: 6 AAA BB Remaining space: 0 CC Remaining space: 4 DDDDD Remaining space: 1 The sum of squared space left over by this method is 0^2 + 4^2 + 1^2 = 17. However, the optimal solution achieves the smaller sum 3^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 = 11: \\\\------ Line width: 6 AAA Remaining space: 3 BB CC Remaining space: 1 DDDDD Remaining space: 1 The difference here is that the first line is broken before \`BB\` instead of after it, yielding a better right margin and a lower cost 11. By using a dynamic programming algorithm to choose the positions at which to break the line, instead of choosing breaks greedily, the solution with minimum raggedness may be found in time O(n^2), where n is the number of words in the input text. Typically, the cost function for this technique should be modified so that it does not count the space left on the final line of a paragraph; this modification allows a paragraph to end in the middle of a line without penalty. It is also possible to apply the same dynamic programming technique to minimize more complex cost functions that combine other factors such as the number of lines or costs for hyphenating long words.. Faster but more complicated linear time algorithms based on the SMAWK algorithm are also known for the minimum raggedness problem, and for some other cost functions that have similar properties... =History= A primitive line-breaking feature was used in 1955 in a \\"page printer control unit\\" developed by Western Union. This system used relays rather than programmable digital computers, and therefore needed a simple algorithm that could be implemented without data buffers. In the Western Union system, each line was broken at the first space character to appear after the 58th character, or at the 70th character if no space character was found.. The greedy algorithm for line-breaking predates the dynamic programming method outlined by Donald Knuth in an unpublished 1977 memo describing his TeX typesetting system.

He is best known for pioneering and popularising a fusion of traditional Japanese percussive music with Western progressive rock music in the 1960s and 1970s. In the latter part of the 1970s, he led the supergroup \\"Go\\" with Steve Winwood, Al Di Meola, Klaus Schulze, and Michael Shrieve. Biography Yamash'ta was born in Kyoto, Japan on March 15, 1947. He entered to study at the Kyoto Academy of Music in 1960. His father was the director of the Kyoto Philharmonic, and he became a percussionist in the orchestra when he was 13. He studied music at Kyoto University, Juilliard School of Music, and Berklee College of Music, and has also lectured in music. His innovation and acrobatic drumming style earned him many accolades. In the 1960s he performed with Thor Johnson, Toru Takemitsu, and Hans Werner Henze amongst others. He changed his name from Tsutomu Yamashita to the phonetic Stomu Yamash'ta and in 1969 gained worldwide recognition during a concert with Seiji Ozawa and the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. Time reviewed the concert declaring 'the star of the evening was Stomu Yamash'ta who stole the show with his virtuoso performance', and when it was over the audience gave him a five-minute standing ovation. At the turn of the 1970s he worked with Peter Maxwell Davies and brought the Red Buddha Theatre company from Japan to Europe, acting as their director, producer and composer, writing and performing in the multi- media event The Man From The East, with Morris Pert's Come To The Edge providing the musical backing. He has composed for the British Royal Ballet; contributed pieces from his albums to the Nicolas Roeg film The Man Who Fell to Earth (starring David Bowie); performed in Peter Maxwell Davies's score for Ken Russell's The Devils and in John Williams' score for Robert Altman's Images (1972). He has also composed film scores. His Space Theme was used by the BBC on The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.

History In 1968, a causeway (Estrada do Istmo) connecting Taipa and Coloane was inaugurated. Throughout the 90s, a series of landfill works expanded this isthmus, and after the 1999 transfer of sovereignty over Macau from Portugal to China, further landfills began to expand this small isthmus more.

Price also stood as an umpire from 1950 to 1967. He played in one Test match and officiated as an umpire in eight. Price was a wicket-keeper who took 648 catches and 316 stumpings in his first-class career. He was named as one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year in 1940. Price was unfortunate to be around in the same era as Les Ames, which limited Price's opportunities for an international career. He toured abroad twice, once with the Honourable Freddie Calthorpe's side in 1929/30, when he went as a replacement for Rony Stanyforth, and then on a non-Test tour to South America in 1937/8. Price's reputation as an umpire was as someone who would stand up strongly for what he felt was right. He once no-balled Tony Lock, the Surrey and England spin bowler for throwing against India. He also lay down at square-leg, refusing to get up, to stop barracking at a Surrey-Yorkshire game.

When you see and hear Jada with her band it's apparent that she has nothing but love and respect for this genre of music.\\" In May 2005 organizers announced Wicked Wisdom would perform on the second stage of 2005's Ozzfest. Fans of the festival were outraged, claiming the band did not have the credibility to perform at the music festival. Aware of the questions about the band's addition to Ozzfest, Pinkett Smith said, \\"I'm not here asking for any favors. You've got to show and prove. And not every audience is going to go for it.\\" Wicked Wisdom's guitarist Pocket Honore said while early dates of the tour were rocky, \\"once word got out that we weren't a joke, people started coming out and by the sixth or seventh gig we were on fire.\\" Pinkett Smith agreed, saying, \\"After seven dates within the Ozzfest tour, the whole attitude of it started to turn around once the word of mouth started getting out.\\" The band's self-titled second album was released on February 21, 2006, through Pinkett Smith's production company 100% Women and Suburban Noize Records.

The bird's throat snare is visible via the constriction in the bird's neck. Cormorant fishing is a traditional fishing method in which fishermen use trained cormorants to fish in rivers. Historically, cormorant fishing has taken place in Japan and China, as well as Greece, North Macedonia, and, briefly, England and France. It is first attested as a method used by the ancient Japanese in the Book of Sui, the official history of the Sui Dynasty of China, completed in 636 CE. This technique has also been used in other countries but is currently under threat in China. To control the birds, the fishermen tie a snare near the base of the bird's throat. This prevents the birds from swallowing larger fish, which are held in their throat, but the birds can swallow smaller fish. When a cormorant has caught a fish in its throat, the fisherman brings the bird back to the boat and has the bird spit the fish up. Though cormorant fishing once was a successful industry, its primary use today is to serve the tourism industry. The types of cormorants used differ based on the location. In Gifu, Japan, the Japanese cormorant (Phalacrocorax capillatus) is used; Chinese fishermen often employ great cormorants (P. carbo). Darters (birds in the genus Anhinga), which are close relatives of cormorants, are also used for this fishing technique on occasion. Locations left =Japan= Cormorant fishing, called (ÈµúÈ£º) in Japanese, takes place in 13 cities in Japan. The most famous location is Gifu, Gifu Prefecture, home to cormorant fishing on the Nagara River, which has continued uninterrupted for the past 1,300 years. Cormorant fishing in Seki also takes place on the Nagara River, but it is called 'Oze cormorant fishing' ( ). Only the cormorant fishing masters in Gifu and Seki are employed by the emperor and called Imperial Fishermen of the Royal Household Agency.

Elsewhere in southern China, the Bai people have utilized cormorant fishing since the 9th century on the banks of Erhai Lake. Traditionally practised for sustenance, cormorant fishing is now primarily performed for tourists. =Europe= Cormorant fishing is an old tradition in Greece and North Macedonia, especially on Doiran Lake which lies in the border of the two countries, and it is still practiced today by some traditional fishermen. In Western Europe, cormorant fishing took place briefly from the 16th to 17th centuries, primarily in England and France. =Peru= There are claims of cormorant fishing in Peru during the 5th century, 100 years earlier than Japan.

Before it became a restaurant chain, it was a single restaurant, opened in 1926 by Fred Angell. By the end of the 1920s, four franchises were granted; these four restaurants are still in operation. Maid-Rite Corporation's CEO and president is Bradley L. Burt. The corporate headquarters are located in Des Moines, Iowa. As of August 2019, Maid-Rite had 32 locations in Ohio, Iowa, Nebraska, Illinois, Minnesota, and Missouri. The Quincy, Illinois, location was featured in the Food Network show Feasting on Asphalt. History Fred Angell was a butcher in Muscatine, Iowa, who combined a special cut and grind of meat with a selected set of spices and created the Maid-Rite sandwich, which is not a traditional hamburger. Rather, it is called a \\"loose meat\\" sandwich. While the component meat is similar, the Maid-Rite sandwich's meat is not formed into a patty, making it similar to a sloppy joe without the tomato-based sauce. =Restaurants= Shuttered store in Macomb, Illinois Angell opened his first restaurant in Muscatine, which was strictly walk-up. Later, a new eat-in building was opened. He and his son, Francis Angell, opened a second restaurant, featuring a \\"car hop\\" or drive-in service. This was the first such service of this kind in the United States; A&W; Restaurants and White Castle Restaurants replicated this service shortly thereafter. The first franchise was opened in Durant, Iowa, which still maintains a Maid-Rite restaurant. Maid-Rite began to grow in the number of franchises throughout the United States under the direction of William Angell, the grandson of the founder. Sale The Angell family had controlling interest in the franchise until 1984, when it was sold to a partnership of Clayton Blue, a farmer from Russell, Iowa, and John Gillotti, a contractor from Des Moines. (The original Maid-Rite restaurants in Muscatine were sold to Gary Kopf, a local businessman who also operated vending companies, family restaurants and bakeries.) Blue had plans to expand the chain into a worldwide operation and sell stock to the public; however, after Blue defaulted on the contract to buy Maid-Rite, Gillotti purchased the chain outright in 1988. Gillotti died in 1991, prompting a legal battle between Blue's family and Gillotti's heirs over the chain's ownership. After the Polk County District Court issued an injunction in 1992 that prohibited any new Maid-Rite franchises, the court awarded the Gillotti family ownership of the 138-store chain in 1995. Issues with franchise fees and product quality led to a number of restaurants closing, however, and by 2002 the number of Maid-Rite stores had dropped to 83. In 2002, an investor group led by former Des Moines banker Bradley Burt purchased a majority interest in the Maid-Rite chain, with the Gillotti family retaining an interest. While up to 20 longtime franchisees left Maid-Rite during the first two years of its new ownership, Maid-Rite began to use computerized systems to control expenses, started offering ten-day courses on Maid-Rite food preparation to new franchise owners, and created a new uniform decor for its restaurants that retains the Maid-Rite brand's nostalgia. According to the Des Moines Register, Maid-Rite has a ten-year plan to open more than 1,000 restaurants throughout the United States. In November 2007, Maid-Rite announced an agreement with Hy-Vee Food Stores, a Midwest-based grocer, to operate restaurants in their stores.

This achievement was destroyed by the Act of Union 1800, which Yelverton supported. By doing so, he gravely harmed his reputation for integrity, which had already been damaged by his leading role in the conviction and execution for treason of the United Irishman William Orr, which is now seen as a major miscarriage of justice. Early life He was the eldest son of Francis Yelverton of Kanturk, County Cork, and Elizabeth Barry, daughter of Jonas Barry of Kilbrin (now Ballyclogh, County Cork)Ball, F. Elrington The Judges in Ireland 1221‚Äì1921 John Murray London 1926 Vol.1 p.219 His father died when Barry was only ten; his mother reached a great age, dying only a year before her son. He went to school in CharlevilleBall p.219 and Midleton College, and attended Trinity College Dublin, where he took a degree of Bachelor of Arts in 1757 and of Bachelor of Laws in 1761. His family lacked wealth and social positionBall p.166 and he was for some years an assistant master under Andrew Buck in the Hibernian Academy. This menial occupation was later a source of great embarrassment to him, as his enemies loved to ridicule him as \\"Buck's usher\\". In 1761, he married Mary Nugent (died 1802), daughter of William Nugent of Clonlost, County Westmeath, and his wife Ursula Aglionby, a lady of some fortune, and was thus enabled to read for the Irish Bar, entering the Middle Temple. He was called to the Bar in 1764: despite his lack of family connections his success in his profession was rapid, due to his legal ability, charm and remarkable eloquence, and he took silk eight years afterwards. M.P. He was elected to the Irish House of Commons as member for Donegal Borough from 1774 to 1776. In the latter year, Yelverton was elected for both Belfast and Carrickfergus. He chose to sit for the latter constituency and represented Carrickfergus until 1784. Although few examples of his oratory survive, all contemporaries agree on his eloquence, which gave him a dominant position in the Commons. Judicial career He became Attorney-General for Ireland in 1782, and was elevated to the bench as Lord Chief Baron of the Exchequer in 1783. He was created Baron Yelverton in 1795, and in 1800 Viscount Avonmore in the Peerage of Ireland. As Chief Baron he led the opposition to the proposal to increase the number of judges in each of the courts of common lawBall p.167 from three to four, on the practical ground that four-judge courts often divide evenly and thus cannot reach an effective decision. Despite this common-sense view, the new judges were eventually appointed. =William Orr= In 1797 he attained a degree of infamy for presiding over what was widely regarded as a \\"show trial\\" which led to the execution of the United Irishman, William Orr (although Yelverton is said to have shed tears when passing the death sentence on Orr). Orr was charged with administering the United Irish oath to a soldier called Hugh Wheatly; this had recently become a capital offence. In fact it was generally believed that another man, William McKeever, administered the oath. Wheatly, who was the principal witness for the prosecution, later confessed that he had perjured himself, but despite a superb defence by John Philpott Curran, Orr was found guilty and hanged. Yelverton may have formed an early impression of Orr's guilt and acted on it - even his admirers admitted that as a judge he lacked impartiality. Peter Finnerty, a journalist, was later convicted of seditious libel for publishing an attack on Yelverton over his conduct of Orr's trial: this did nothing to enhance the judge's reputation. Death He died in 1805 at his mansion, Fortfield House, Terenure, County Dublin, which he had built at great expense around 1785. Personality To his colleagues at the Irish bar, Yelverton was a popular and charming companion: even John Philpot Curran, despite their frequent courtroom clashes, seems to have liked Yelverton personally. Curran and Yelverton were co-founders of the popular drinking club called The Monks of the Screw. Being a man of insignificant physical appearance, he owed his early successes to his remarkable eloquence, which made a great impression on his contemporaries; as a judge, he was inclined to take the view of the advocate rather than that of the impartial lawyer. Ball considered him one of the most learned judges of his time.Ball p.166 While Edward Cooke called him \\"a brute\\", this simply reflects Cooke's low opinion of all the Irish judges. of his timeBall p.169 Sir Jonah Barrington wrote that for all Yelverton's faults, and his lack of any real moral code, it was impossible not to like and respect him. Politician He gave his support to Henry Grattan and the Whigs during the greater part of his parliamentary career. He was a strong supporter of the demand for an independent Irish Parliament, but later changed his stance. =Yelverton's Act= He played a crucial role in the reforms which are collectively called the Irish Constitution of 1782.Ball p.220 In particular he sponsored the Act 21 and 22 of George III, An Act to regulate the manner of passing bills and to prevent delays in summoning of Parliaments- which was popularly known as \\"Yelverton's Act\\". This radically modified Poynings' Law of 1495 by which all legislation to be passed by the Irish Parliament had to be drafted by the Privy Council of Ireland, then sent to the English Privy Council for approval. Under Yelverton's Act, the role of the Irish Privy Council was abolished and legislation was commenced in the normal way in the Irish Parliament, which for the last 17 years of its existence enjoyed a wide measure of independence. =Act of Union= In his latter days he became identified with the court party and voted for the Act of Union 1800, for which his viscounty was a reward. For this he was never forgiven by his former friends. Sir Jonah Barrington, who continued to regard Yelverton with affection and respect, regretted that this action should have destroyed his reputation forever; but he argued that such a mistake of judgment was understandable in a man who lacked worldly wisdom, and despite his many good qualities, did not have a strong moral sense. He became a member of the Royal Irish Academy in 1787. Family He had three sons and one daughter, and the title descended in the family.

She served as de facto regent during the interrim period between the deposition of Marquis of Haihun until the succession of Emperor Xuan of Han in 74 BC. Her father was Shangguan An (‰∏äÂÆòÂÆâ), the son of Shangguan Jie (‰∏äÂÆòÊ°Ä). Her mother was the daughter of Huo Guang. She was a key figure in a number of political incidents during the middle Han Dynasty, and she spent her entire adult life as a Grand Empress Dowager and a widow without family. Both sides of her family were wiped out in two separate mass executions as punishment for being relatives of individuals accused of seeking to usurp the throne. She remains the youngest person in Chinese history to assume the titles of both Empress Dowager and Grand Empress Dowager.  Background and marriage to Emperor Zhao  Lady Shangguan's grandfathers, Huo Guang and Shangguan Jie (along with ethnic Xiongnu official Jin Midi), were co-regents for the young Emperor Zhao, who ascended the throne in 87 BC at age seven. Huo was the primary regent. At that time, Lady Shangguan herself was a toddler. It is not known when Lady Shangguan's parents were married, but what is clear was that her grandfathers were colleagues in Emperor Wu's administration and great friends. However, after Jin, a moderating influence in the co-regency, died in 86 BC, they began to have conflicts, because Shangguan Jie was unhappy with his lesser role in the co-regency. In 84 BC, Shangguan Jie wanted to marry the five-year-old Lady Shangguan to the emperor. Huo initially refused, believing her to be too young. Shangguan Jie turned elsewhere for support of his plan. Lady Shangguan's father Shangguan An was a friend of Emperor Zhao's sister, Princess Eyi's and her lover, Ding Wairen (‰∏ÅÂ§ñ‰∫∫). He encouraged Ding to persuade the princess on the soundness of the marriage. He argued that the Shangguans' power would be firmer with the marriage, and that they could then help Ding legitimize his relationship with Princess Eyi. Princess Eyi agreed, and later in 84 BC the young Lady Shangguan was created an imperial consort (with the rank of jieyu). In 83 BC, she was created empress.  As Empress  Because of her young age (and her husband's young age as well), it was unlikely that Empress Shangguan had significant power at court after they were married. In 80 BC, however, she would suffer the first major tragedy in her life, the destruction of her paternal clan, the Shangguans. The Shangguans, to show their appreciation to Ding for his role in facilitating the marriage between Empress Shangguan and Emperor Zhao, wanted to have him created a marquess, but this request was rebuffed by Huo, as were their subsequent efforts to have Ding made an important official. This caused Princess Eyi to resent Huos' power and influence. The Shangguans, Princess Eyi, Prince Dan of Yan, and Vice Prime Minister Sang Hongyang (Ê°ëÂºòÁæä) (who was resentful that his monopoly system, which he felt to be the key to sound finances for the state, was being dismantled), formed an anti-Huo conspiracy. In 80 BC, Prince Dan sent a report to Emperor Zhao, accusing Huo of improperly exercising imperial authority. The conspirators' plan was that as soon as Emperor Zhao authorised an investigation, Shangguan Jie and Sang would arrest and immediately execute Huo. However, after the report was given to Emperor Zhao, the 14-year-old Emperor Zhao took no action on it. The next day, he summoned Huo to the palace and exonerated him, reasoning that the actions that Huo was accused of had happened so recently that Prince Dan, a long distance away, could not have possibly known them, and therefore the report must have been false. At this point, the anti-Huo conspiracy was not discovered, but everyone was impressed with the wisdom shown by the young emperor. Later that year, the conspirators tried again. Their plan was for Princess Eyi to invite Huo to a feast, and then to ambush Huo and kill him. They would then depose Emperor Zhao and make Prince Dan emperor. (However, allegedly, the Shangguans conspired to have Prince Dan killed once he arrived in the capital and for Shangguan Jie to declare himself emperor.) The conspiracy was revealed by a servant of Princess Eyi, and the conspirators were arrested and executed along with their entire clans. Princess Eyi and Prince Dan committed suicide. Empress Shangguan was spared, however, because of her young age and her status as Huo's granddaughter. In 74 BC, Emperor Zhao died at age 20. Empress Shangguan, then 15, became a widow and would be for the rest of her life. The young couple was childless, and Emperor Zhao did not have any other concubines who had children either. (It is not clear whether the marriage was ever consummated, although it was likely given the tendency for early marriage and childbirth in those days, even for imperial couples.) = Role in the subsequent succession crisis = Empress Shangguan's grandfather Huo rejected Liu Xu (ÂäâËÉ•), the Prince of Guangling and the only surviving son of Emperor Wu, from the succession, because Emperor Wu himself had not favoured Prince Xu, who was known for being compulsive in his actions. He therefore turned to Prince He of Changyi, one of Emperor Wu's grandsons. Empress Shangguan was probably not consulted about the selection process. When Prince He ascended the throne, Empress Shangguan became empress dowager.  Brief reign of Prince He of Changyi  Once he became emperor, Prince He immediately began to give unlimited promotions to his subordinates from Changyi. He also failed to observe the period of mourning properly, but rather feasted day and night and went out on tours. Prince He's behaviour as emperor surprised and disappointed Huo, who pondered his options. At the suggestion of the Agriculture Minister, Tian Yannian (Áî∞Âª∂Âπ¥), he began to consider deposing the new emperor. After consulting with other officials, Huo took action. Huo and the other officials summoned a meeting of high level officials and announced the plan to depose the emperor, forcing the other officials to go along with the plan on pain of death. As a group, they went to Empress Dowager Shangguan's palace to report to her Prince He's offences. She agreed with their plan, and immediately ordered that Prince He's Changyi subordinates be barred from the palace, and those subordinates (some 200) were then arrested by Zhang. She then summoned Prince He, who still did not know what was going to happen. He only knew something was wrong when he saw Empress Dowager Shangguan seated on her throne and wearing a formal dress made of jewels, and the officials lined up next to her. Huo and the top officials then offered their articles of impeachment against Prince He, and these articles were read out aloud to the Empress Dowager who verbally rebuked Prince He. The articles of impeachment listed as the main offences that Prince He committed as emperor: *Refusal to abstain from meat and sex during the period of mourning *Failure to keep the imperial seal secure *Improperly promoting and rewarding his Changyi subordinates during the period of mourning *Engaging in feasts and games during the period of mourning *Offering sacrifices to his father during the period of mourning for his uncle Empress Dowager Shangguan approved the articles of impeachment and ordered Prince He deposed. = Regency and ascension of Emperor Xuan = For nearly a month (although initially it appeared that the period might last even longer) Empress Dowager Shangguan heard reports and ruled on all important matters of state. It was during this time that she began to learn the Confucian classics from Xiahou Sheng (Â§è‰æØÂãù). After Prince He was removed as emperor, Huo Guang made a second search for a suitable successor to the throne. At some point, on the recommendation of Bing Ji (‰∏ôÂêâ), Huo reached out to a commoner, the grandson of former Crown Prince Liu Ju. He was the son of Emperor Wu and Empress Wei Zifu who committed suicide in 91 BC after being forced into an unsuccessful rebellion against his father. Liu Ju was Empress Shangguan's grand nephew. Huo then formally submitted the proposal to Empress Dowager Shangguan, who approved it. To avoid having a mere commoner ascend the throne, she first created him the Marquess of Yangwu, and on the same day, he ascended the throne as Emperor Xuan. Empress Dowager Shangguan was given the title of Grand Empress Dowager, the title she would hold the rest of her life.  As Grand Empress Dowager  Tomb of Empress Shangguan in Pingling (Âπ≥Èôµ), Xianyang, Shaanxi After Emperor Xuan became emperor, Grand Empress Dowager Shangguan, still a teenager, faded from the public eye. Nevertheless, she would often receive her Huo relations as guests, and Emperor Xuan's empress, Xu Pingjun, often had meals with her. She and Empress Xu appeared to have had a cordial relationship, and she was in all likelihood not involved in the plot of her grandmother Xian (È°Ø), who murdered Empress Xu in 71 BC by poisoning her to allow her daughter (and Grand Empress Dowager Shangguan's aunt) Huo Chengjun to become empress. Grand Empress Dowager Shangguan's relationship with her aunt and empress appeared to be cooler than her relationship with Empress Xu. Huo Guang died in 68 BC. After Huo's death, his sons, sons-in-law and grandnephews remained in important posts and were made marquesses. The Huo family lived luxurious lives and acted as if it were the imperial household. Emperor Xuan, unhappy about the Huos' arrogance, began to gradually strip their actual powers while formally letting them keep their titles. In 67 BC, Emperor Xuan made his son Liu Shi (ÂäâÂ•≠, later Emperor Yuan), by the deceased Empress Xu, crown prince, an act that greatly angered Lady Xian, who instructed her daughter to murder the crown prince. Allegedly, Empress Huo did make multiple attempts to do so, but failed each time. Around this time, the emperor also heard rumours that the Huos had murdered Empress Xu, which led him to strip the Huos of actual power. In 66 BC, Lady Xian revealed to her son and grandnephews that she had, indeed, murdered Empress Xu. In fear of what the emperor might do if he had actual proof, Lady Xian, her son, her grandnephews, and her sons-in-law formed a conspiracy to depose the emperor. Their plan was to ask Grand Empress Dowager Shangguan to invite Emperor Xuan's grandmother, Lady Wang, Prime Minister Wei Xiang (È≠èÁõ∏) and Empress Xu's father- in-law and the deceased Empress Xu's father Xu Guanghan (Ë®±Âª£Êº¢), planning to ambush them and kill them (whom the Huos considered political rivals), and then depose Emperor Xuan and make Huo's son Huo Yu (ÈúçÁ¶π) emperor. The plot was discovered and the entire Huo clan was executed, leaving Grand Empress Dowager Shangguan, who apparently was not involved in the plot, entirely without family. The only reference to Grand Empress Dowager Shangguan after that was that she greatly honoured her teacher Xiahou by wearing mourning clothes for him when he died. She died in 37 BC, during the reign of Emperor Xuan's son Emperor Yuan, and she was buried with her husband Emperor Zhao.

It was founded in the early 1990s and charged with the mission to develop MIT's entrepreneurial activities and interests in education and research, alliances, and the community. The E-Center focuses on commercializing technologies that are invented by MIT students. To this end, the E-Center supports 1) the annual MIT $100K Entrepreneurship Competition, and 2) student groups called Innovation Teams. Both groups are designed to support internal MIT students by organizing resources relevant to entrepreneurship. The Martin Trust Center is responsible for driving entrepreneurial education throughout MIT courses, as well as providing assistance to student entrepreneurs in the form of office resources, space, expert mentorship, and grants and awards. The acting managing director of the center is Bill Aulet. The center was founded by entrepreneur and Sloan School faculty member Florence Sender and MIT Professor, entrepreneur, and venture capitalist Edward B. Roberts, a co-founder of Meditech, Zero Stage Capital, and Sohu.com among other companies. The Martin Trust Center oversees the Patrick J. McGovern, Jr Award that recognizes excellence in entrepreneurship. Degree offerings Among other degrees, the Center offers a Master of Business Administration (MBA). In 2006, MIT Sloan launched a new program for entrepreneurs within the MBA degree called Entrepreneurship & Innovation (E&I;). In addition to the MBA awarded by the Sloan School, participants are awarded a Certificate in Entrepreneurship and Innovation from MIT. The E&I; option centers on starting and developing enterprises by bringing together students and faculty from across MIT's disciplines to build businesses around ideas and technologies. The program seeks to formalize MIT's long-standing and leading entrepreneurship offerings. E&I; students benefit from a specialized weekly seminar for entrepreneurs which features a speaker series and a networking dinner. In addition, a one-week trip to Silicon Valley is coordinated in conjunction with the MIT Sloan MediaTech club. Program participants apply to the E&I; program as part of the MIT Sloan application process. Upon admission to the MBA program, they are then evaluated for admission to the E&I; option. In addition to the core curriculum required for all MBA students, E&I; students must take additional entrepreneurship-oriented courses each semester following the first semester core.

Audemus jura nostra defendere ‚Äî Latin for \\"We Dare Defend Our Rights\\" or \\"We Dare Maintain Our Rights\\" ‚Äî is the state motto of Alabama and is depicted on the official Coat of arms of Alabama. The current coat of arms was created in 1923 at the request of state historian and director of the Alabama Department of Archives and History, Marie Bankhead Owen. It was not officially adopted until March 14, 1939. The motto itself is emblazoned on a golden band across the bottom of the coat of arms. The escutcheon of the coat of arms is quartered into the flags of the Kingdom of France, the Crown of Castile, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, and the Confederate States of America, with a central overlay of the shield of the United States. Bald eagles serve as supporters to either side of the escutcheon. All is surmounted by a crimson and white torse and the Baldine, the sailing ship that Iberville and Bienville arrived in prior to the settlement of the colony of Mobile. History The Seal of Alabama from 1868 until 1939. \\"Here We Rest\\" served as the official state motto during that time. The state's first seal of 1819, replaced by this one, was readopted as the official seal in 1939. It does not contain a motto. The modern Alabama motto was added to the current coat of arms when it was created in 1923. It was officially adopted for use in 1939. It is the second state motto. The first motto was adopted by the Reconstruction Era state legislature on December 29, 1868 for use on the second Seal of Alabama. It depicted a bald eagle atop an American shield, holding a banner inscribed with the motto \\"Here We Rest\\" in its beak. The source of the current motto is drawn from the lines of \\"An Ode in Imitation of Alcaeus,\\" also known by its first line, \\"What constitutes a State?\\" It was published in 1781 by the eighteenth-century liberal English philologist Sir William Jones. This poem advanced his ideas on government and morality and was considered by scholars as his greatest political poem.

Description Tarabul's gerbil is a small mouse like rodent with a long tail which ends in a tuft. It has tawny fur on the dorsal surface and white fur on its ventral surface which is clearly demarcated. The ears are plain with no black tips a white spot just behind them and the soles of its feet bear hair. The sympatric occidental gerbil Gerbillus occiduus has ears with black tips and no spot behind them. The head and body length averages 102.9mm and the tail length averages 148.4mm. Distribution Tarabul's gerbil is found from northern Senegal, Mauritania, Western Sahara and Morocco east to Tibesti Mountains of Chad in the south and to Cyrenaica in eastern Libya in the north. The recently noted extension of its range into northern Senegal may be an indicator of increased desertification. Habitat Tarabul's gerbil occurs in sandy desert and semi- desert areas, as well as coastal steppe. Habits Tarabul's gerbil is a nocturnal species that digs complex, shallow burrows (15‚Äì25 cm in length) in the sand and which plugs the entrance to its burrow during the day. It breeds during throughout the rainy season, July to September, beginning breeding at the end of the coll dry season in April and ending at the start of the cool dry season in November. Barn owls Tyto alba have been recorded as preying on this species.

He combined the Rinzai use of k≈çans and the S≈çt≈ç emphasis on shikantaza in his teachings, influenced by his years studying under Hakuun Yasutani in Sanbo Kyodan. He founded or co-founded several institutions and practice centers, including the Zen Center of Los Angeles, White Plum Asanga, Yokoji Zen Mountain Center and the Zen Mountain Monastery. Taizan Maezumi left behind twelve dharma successors, appointed sixty-eight priests and gave Buddhist precepts to more than five hundred practitioners. Along with Zen teachers like Shunry≈´ Suzuki, Seungsahn, Joshu Sasaki and Hsuan Hua, Maezumi greatly influenced the American Zen landscape. Several Dharma Successors of his‚Äîincluding Tetsugen Bernard Glassman, Dennis Merzel, John Daido Loori, Jan Chozen Bays, Gerry Shishin Wick, Joko Beck, and William Nyogen Yeo‚Äîhave gone on to found Zen communities of their own. Maezumi died unexpectedly while visiting Japan in 1995. Biography Maezumi's father, Baian Hakujun Kuroda Maezumi was born in Japan on February 24, 1931 to Yoshiko Kuroda-Maezumi and Baian Hakujun Kuroda, a prominent S≈çt≈ç priest, in his father's temple in ≈åtawara, Tochigi. In later years, he took the name Maezumi, his mother's maiden name. He was ordained as a novice monk in the S≈çt≈ç lineage at age eleven, and in high school began studying Zen under a lay Rinzai instructor, Kory≈´ Osaka. While studying under Koryu he attended Komazawa University‚Äîreceiving degrees in oriental literature and philosophy. After college he trained at S≈çji-ji, and then received shih≈ç from his father in 1955. In 1956 he was sent to the United States to serve as a priest at the Zenshuji in Little Tokyo, Los Angeles, a Japanese-American neighborhood. He worked part-time at a factory. The Zenshuji Soto Mission consisted of a Japanese-American congregation that placed little emphasis on zazen. Maezumi began sitting zazen occasionally with Nyogen Senzaki, in nearby Boyle Heights, Los Angeles for the next two years. In 1959 Maezumi took classes in English at San Francisco State University.The same year he met Shunry≈´ Suzuki for the first time and occasionally visited Suzuki's temple, Sokoji, for ceremonies. Early in the 1960s, Maezumi began holding zazen at Zenshuji for Western students, which eventually led to the opening of the Zen Center of Los Angeles in 1967. That same year he married his first wife, Charlene (they divorced in 1971.)Profiles of Zen/Ch'an Buddhists Also in 1967, Maezumi began studying with Hakuun Yasutani, completing k≈çan study under him and receiving inka (dharma transmission)White Plum Asanga website in 1970. He also received inka from Kory≈´ Osaka in 1973, making him a lineage-holder in the S≈çt≈ç, Rinzai and Sanbo Kyodan schools. Koryu Osaka In 1975 Maezumi married his second wife, Martha Ekyo Maezumi, and later the couple had three children (his daughter Kyrie Maezumi is an actress). In 1976, Maezumi founded the non-profit Kuroda Institute for the Study of Buddhism and Human Values, promoting academic scholarship on Buddhist topics. The White Plum Asanga was also established during this period. His senior student Tetsugen Bernard Glassman opened the Zen Community of New York in 1979 with Maezumi's blessing and encouragement. Another student, John Daido Loori, acquired land in the Catskill Mountains of New York and in 1980 established Zen Mountain Monastery (ZMM) with Maezumi; Loori was installed as Abbot at ZMM in 1989. That following year Maezumi founded a summer retreat for the ZCLA called the Yokoji Zen Mountain Center, which today serves as a year-round residential and non-residential Zen training center. In 1984 another student, Dennis Merzel, left ZCLA to establish the Kanzeon Sangha, an international network practicing in the Sanbo Kyodan lineage. Maezumi died on May 15, 1995 while visiting his family in Japan. He had been out drinking; returning home, he took a bath, where he fell asleep and drowned. Not long before dying, he had given inka (dharma transmission) to Tetsugen Bernard Glassman. He did this to emphasize the Sanbo Kyodan connection of his past into the Dharma transmission of White Plum Asanga, naming Glassman President of the organization in his will. Teaching style On the way to Poland 1992 Due to his training in three Japanese lineages, Maezumi employed both Rinzai k≈çan study and S≈çt≈ç shikantaza in his teaching curriculum‚Äîan approach developed by his teacher Hakuun Yasutani. He was known to be especially strict about the posture of his students while sitting zazen. Maezumi used a range of k≈çans from different Zen traditions, including the Blue Cliff Record, The Gateless Gate, Transmission of the Lamp, and the Book of Equanimity. According to author and Dharma Successor Gerry Shishin Wick, Maezumi was also fond of a particular saying‚Äî\\"appreciate your life.\\" This also is the title of a compiled book of teachings by Maezumi, published by Shambhala Publications. In it Maezumi says, \\"I encourage you. Please enjoy this wonderful life together. Appreciate the world just this! There is nothing extra. Genuinely appreciate your life as the most precious treasure and take good care of it.\\" Criticism Maezumi publicly admitted he was an alcoholic in 1983, and sought treatment at the Betty Ford Center. This coincided with revelations that he had been having sexual relationships with some of his female followers at the Zen Center of Los Angeles despite being married to his wife, Martha Ekyo Maezumi, \\"including one of the recipients of his dharma transmission\\". According to Kirsten Mitsuyo Maezumi, this \\"caused the separation of my parents and was the reason my mother left the Zen Center of Los Angeles with my brother and [me] in 1983\\". Maezumi was forthcoming in admitting his mistakes and did not justify his behaviors. These events caused much turmoil in his school, and many students left as a result. Some members who stayed described themselves as forced to see Maezumi on a more human level, even seeing this period as a breakthrough for them, no longer deluded into thinking a teacher could be beyond imperfection. Both Bays and Tetsugen Bernard Glassman founded their own sanghas at this time. When remembering Maezumi, author David Chadwick had this to say: \\"I'd say he had an interesting mix of humility and arrogance. Mainly to me he'd seem arrogant at a distance, but close up he'd be right there with me not putting on any airs.\\" Influence Maezumi's ashes Maezumi named twelve Dharma Successors, ordained sixty-eight priests, and administered the Buddhist precepts to over five hundred individuals. Author James Ishmael Ford says, Jan Chozen Bays says, His daughter Kirsten Mitsuyo Maezumi writes: Dharma heirs Maezumi Roshi gave Dharma transmission to the following individuals: * Tetsugen Bernard Glassman * Dennis Merzel * Joko Beck * Jan Chozen Bays * John Daido Loori * Gerry Shishin Wick * John Tesshin Sanderson * Alfred Jitsudo Ancheta * Charles Tenshin Fletcher * Susan Myoyu Andersen * Nicolee Jikyo McMahon * William Nyogen Yeo Bibliography *1976 On Zen Practice: Body, Breath, Mind by Maezumi and Tetsugen Bernard Glassman *1978 On Zen Practice II: Body, Breath, Mind (a.k.a.

The spacecraft was equipped with instrumentation to test Pulse-code modulation (PCM) transmitting on S-band frequencies and transponders operating in the C-band. The spacecraft was unable to complete its mission after a launch failure left it in a lower than planned orbit and propulsion issues prevented the satellite from correcting this via its own maneuvering system. Overview GSAT-1 failed to achieve its target orbit, which prevented it from fulfilling its primary communications mission. The 1.54-tonne satellite was orbiting with a period of 23 hours two minutes, instead of the planned 24-hour geosynchronous orbit, only permitting a limited series of experiments to be conducted, including digital audio broadcasting and compressed digital TV signal transmission. The GSLV (Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle) suffered a performance shortfall during its first flight resulting in the injection of the experimental satellite into a geosynchronous transfer orbit (GTO) of 181 x 32.051 km, inclined at 19.2 degrees, having an apogee about 4,000 km below the targeted orbit of 185 x 35.975 km. The satellite used its onboard propulsion system to raise both its apogee and its perigee to geostationary orbit as well as to decrease the orbital inclination to zero, however its propellant was depleted prior to successfully raising its orbit. The satellite used two different propellant tanks, built in Germany and India, which resulted in an unequal flow of fuel, causing the spacecraft to tilt. (The two different fuel tanks were used because they were readily available). Recovery required the use of more propellant than planned which resulted in the satellite having no propellant left to complete its final circularization maneuver. The satellite was possibly used for a few communications experiments but the original purpose of demonstrating digital TV and audio broadcasts, as well as Internet services could not be fulfilled. The Russian 12KRB cryogenic upper stage was planned to perform for 710 seconds, but its burn apparently lasted only 698 seconds.

Created by the acclaimed children's literature writer and graphic artist Veronika Mar√©k and animator Zsolt Richly, its protagonist, the rabbit with checkered ears quickly became one of the most prolific mascots of Hungarian animation.  Format  At its debut the series ran every Saturday in the children's programming section of the then only Hungarian television channel, Magyar Telev√≠zi√≥. The few-minute long episodes consisted of simple stories in which the rabbit with checkered ears helped one or more of the series' other main characters, four children called Kriszta (dark-haired girl), Menyus (red- haired boy), Kist√∂fi (blond toddler boy) and Mozdony (big bully) in various situations.  Episodes  # Kriszta sz√ºlet√©snapja (Krisztina's birthday) # Menyus √©s a h√≥ember (Menyus and the snowman) # Kist√∂fi az √°llatkertben (Kist√∂fi at the zoo) # Kriszta a maj√°lison (Krisztina at the picnic) # Menyus √©s a sportsverseny (Menyus and the sports competition) # Kriszta, az indi√°n (Krisztina, the Indian) # Kriszta √©s a jelmezb√°l (Krisztina and the costume) # Kist√∂fi a t√≥parton (Kist√∂fi at the lake) # Menyus √©s a rajzverseny (Menyus and the drawing competition) # Kist√∂fi a hegyekben (Kist√∂fi in the mountains) # Kriszta a j√°tsz√≥t√©ren (Krisztina on the playground) # Kriszta elt√©ved (Krisztina gets lost) This is an error; it's actually Kist√∂fi who gets lost # Menyus meg a foxi (Menyus and the Fox [terrier]) # Tulip√°nok a t√©ren (Tulips [in the] field) # A f√©nyk√©pez≈ëg√©p (The camera) # Az er≈ëm≈±v√©sz (The artist's power) # A k√∂lcs√∂nk√©rt babakocsi (The borrowed stroller) # Kutyas√©t√°ltat√°s (Dog walking) # A cirkusz (The circus) # A rep√ºl≈ë t√©rk√©p (The airport map) # S√ºt a nap (The sun is shining) # A csodakocsi (The wonder car) # Az elveszett papag√°j (The lost parrot) # Ki√© a h√°z? (Whose house is this?) # Zened√©lut√°n (Afternoon music) # A nagy b√∫j√≥cska (A great hide and seek)  Legacy  The series was first syndicated in the countries around Hungary, and then in nearly ninety other countries around the world. Having no spoken dialogue, the episodes needed no dubbing (except for text), and the universal storylines were easily comprehensible, making the series adaptable in various countries. The checkered-eared rabbit's fame rocketed in and around Hungary with the rise in popularity of retro not only in fashion and design but with the rediscovery of the qualities of Central Eastern Europe's pre-1980s culture. It also became somewhat sought after in the U.S., where it is often described as the \\"bunny in a suitcase\\" and recalled from its frequent broadcasts on the Pinwheel cable program on Nickelodeon. At the time of the original series, merchandising was an unknown term in Hungary, but with the return of the series (as well as other popular children's programmes of the seventies and eighties from the region) the rabbit can now be found on school accessories, pillows as well as in the form of plush toys. In Hungary, 2002 and 2003 saw the release of two DVD sets of the series, each holding 13 of the 26 episodes.

It debuted on July 28, 2005 on MTV. The series has been renewed through Season 16, with 90 new episodes to be produced. On June 19, 2019, it was announced that Wild 'N Out would expand to sister network VH1, with a special Summer season premiering on July 7, 2019. On July 14, 2020, ViacomCBS fired Cannon by terminating their contract with him after he was claimed to have \\"promoted hate speech and anti-Semitism\\" in an episode of his podcast Cannon's Class. The actions taken by ViacomCBS against Cannon led to the immediate removal of the show from VH1's schedule, however the show has not been cancelled officially by the network. Cannon has retailated by demanding full ownership of the program and an apology from ViacomCBS for his termination, although the network has yet to respond to either demand. Premise Similar in premise to shows such as Whose Line Is It Anyway?, the series puts two teams of comedians against each other in a series of Wild 'N Out games which are all basically \\"improvisational\\" comedy games. The Teams are the \\"Red Squad\\", which was the team name until Season 5 where they became the \\"Platinum Squad\\" and were permanently captained by Cannon; and the \\"Black Squad\\", led by a celebrity guest until Season 7 where the situation was reversed with Cannon becoming the Black Squad team captain and the celebrity guest leading the Platinum Squad. For Season 8, the colors were revamped once again with the Gold Squad replacing the Black Squad. The Gold Squad was led by Cannon while the celebrity guest remained captain of the Platinum Squad. For Seasons 9-14, Cannon lead his original Red Squad team color while the Black Squad team color returned also. For Season 15, The teams were revamped as Cannon leads the Old School team, comprising older cast members and a legendary special guest and cast member DC Young Fly and another celebrity guest lead the New School Team, comprising some newer cast members. After three such games, the two teams square off against each other in the final round of the game called 'WildStyle', in which they must deliver a punchline directed at their opponent's team member(s) within a freestyle rap. The comedians \\"beef\\" with each other; however, some are impersonal jokes. Although similar to Whose Line, the \\"points don't matter\\", the teams score one point per round victory during the normal rounds, plus one point per favorably judged punchline during 'Wild Style', which makes it similar in format to the improv show ComedySportz. Each episode also includes a musical performance, occasionally by the guest captain for the Black/Platinum Squad (Nick Cannon performed with Migos in Season 6 in the episode featuring Chanel Iman). At times, the musical guest comes out just before 'Wild Style' as the judge for the beefs. Starting with season 2, the teams now compete for a \\"Wild 'N Out\\" Championship belt which if the Black Squad wins, the team captain gets to take home the belt but if Cannon's team win he gets to keep the belt. Production In November 2012, it was announced that the series would be returning in 2013 after a six- year hiatus. The revival features celebrities, along with the show's current cast. The fifth season premiered on MTV2 to 1.1 million total viewers, making it the highest-rated telecast in the network's history. The show would continue on MTV2 for three seasons. On June 9, 2016, Wild 'N Out was renewed for an eighth season, which would mark the series' return to MTV. The season premiered on August 4, 2016.

Greene retired after the 1999 NFL season and ranks third amongst all-time sack leaders, leading the NFL twice in that category. He was a three- time All-Pro, was voted to the National Football League 1990s All-Decade Team, and was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2016. Early years Greene was a two-year starter and honorable mention All-conference selection as a senior at Granite City South High (Illinois). He also played basketball and was a high jumper for the track team. He is in the Granite City Sports Hall of Fame in Granite City, Illinois. College career Greene played college football as a walk-on at Auburn University, and in 1984 won the Zeke Smith Award as Defensive Player of the Year. He had 69 career tackles as an outside linebacker and 11 sacks his senior year where he led the Southeastern Conference and won the Defensive Player of the Year Award in 1984. He was selected by the Birmingham Stallions in the 1985 United States Football League Territorial Draft and later selected by the Los Angeles Rams of the National Football League in the fifth round (113th overall) of the NFL Draft the same year. He earned a degree in Criminal Justice at Auburn. He completed ROTC while at Auburn and was commissioned a second lieutenant in the Alabama Army National Guard. After playing his first year in the NFL, during the off season, he graduated from the RC-1-86 Armor Officer Basic Course, Fort Knox, Kentucky. During his military career, he earned the rank of Captain and completed airborne training at Fort Benning, Georgia to become a paratrooper. NFL career =Los Angeles Rams= He played for the Rams from 1985 through 1992. From 1985 through 1987 Greene played on left defensive end in the Rams nickel defense and was second on the team in sacks in both 1986 and 1987. His first sack came in 1985, in a playoff game against the Dallas Cowboys and it was in the defensive end role that the sack came. In 1988 Greene became the starting left outside linebacker in the Rams base defense that was enhanced by defensive coordinator Fritz Shurmur's Eagle 5-Linebacker defense which he used extensively from 1988 to 1990. In 1988, Greene led the Rams with 16 sacks which was 2nd overall in the NFL behind Reggie White. That total included 4 sacks against the San Francisco 49ers' Joe Montana in a key late-season game that the Rams had to win order to make the playoffs which they did. The following year, Greene made All-Pro in 1989 and was named to the Pro Bowl for the first time with his second consecutive season of 16 sacks (4th in the NFL). In 1988 and 1989 Greene earned $225,000 each season and in 1990 wanted a multi-year contract worth $1 million per season.\\"GREENE RETURNS TO RAM DEFENSIVE FOLD\\" Long Beach Press-Telegram. September 2, 1990. Retrieved April 11, 2012. After a 39-day holdout, Greene signed a 3-year $2.5 million contract with the Ramshttps://articles.latimes.com/1990-09-03/sports/sp-1620_1_kevin- greene His 13 sacks (tied for 6th in the NFL) in 1990 gave him 46 sacks for that three-year period, the most of any player on the NFL for that span. Also from 1988 to 1990, Greene's first three as a starter, the Rams allowed an average of only 101.6 yards and 3.9 yards per rush against them while compiling 128 sacks.NFL Record & Fact Book. 1991 In 1991 the Rams changed defenses and defensive coordinators. Jeff Fisher became the new defensive coordinator and switched the Rams to a 4-3 defense, a system he was familiar with, after being a 3-4 team since 1983. Although Greene had compiled 46 sacks during the previous 3 seasons, Greene was moved from left outside linebacker in a 3‚Äì4 to right defensive end in a 4-3. Although he was a pure outside linebacker in a 3-4 scheme, he attempted the transition. After five games Greene was moved to left linebacker for a month and a half and then due to injuries he was moved to left defensive end for the remainder of the seasons. In all, he started five games at right defensive end, five games at left linebacker and six games at left defensive end and even though he had a career-high in tackles for loss (8) he ended the year with only 3 sacks. His lowest total, by far, since his rookie season. The entire Rams coaching staff was released after the 1991 season. In 1992 the Rams hired Chuck Knox as head coach. The Rams remained a 4-3 defensive team under defensive coordinator George Dyer and Greene continued to play left outside linebacker. His production returned as he led his team in both tackles and sacks. Greene accepted his new role saying, \\"On third downs I am still rushing the passer, but I would like to rush the passer more often, from more downs and distances, but I can't because of the role I am now asked to play\\".Orange County Herald- Examinor, November 7, 1992 He finished the 1992 season with 10 sacks and Sports Illustrated's Paul Zimmerman picked Greene for his annual All-Pro team, citing Greene's coverage ability, \\"The OLB spot opposite Cox came down to the Eagles' Seth Joyner, my Player of the Year in last year, versus the Rams' Kevin Greene. I picked Greene. He had more coverage responsibility than ever before, and he did just fine. He was a consistent pass rusher.(Zimmerman, Paul) Dr. Z's All-pro Team, Sports Illustrated vault, January 11, 1993. Retrieved April 11, 2009. Dick Selcer, his linebacker coach added, \\"Kevin's a more complete player than he is given credit for, people only seem to notice the home run, but not seem to see the singles. =Pittsburgh Steelers= In 1993, the first year of free agency, Greene sought out teams that employed a 3-4 system. He visited the Green Bay Packers where his former defensive coordinator Fritz Shurmur was employed as the defensive coordinator but they were a 4-3 team. He then visited the Pittsburgh Steelers, a 3-4 team. Dom Capers was the defensive coordinator. He signed a 3-year $5.35 million free- agent contract with the Pittsburgh Steelers.TRANSACTIONS, New York Times April 4, 1993. Returning to his left outside linebacker position, he had a solid season with 12 sacks which tied him for 7th in the league. The following season, Greene was a consensus All-Pro choice in 1994 as he led the NFL in sacks (14) and made another appearance in the Pro Bowl. Additionally, Greene was voted the NFLPA AFC Linebacker of the Year (tied with Junior Seau) for the first time in his career. In 1995, he went to his third Pro Bowl, where he finished with 9 sacks and also played in Super Bowl XXX, a loss to the Dallas Cowboys. During Greene's three years with the Steelers, the defense allowed only 3.48 yards per rush, best in the NFL. As part of that defense, which also led the NFL in sacks with 139 over the same three-year period, Dick LeBeau said, \\"Kevin Greene is a great player against the run and of the best pass rushers in NFL history. He is almost unblockable.\\" Greene has since stated that he had the \\"time of his life\\" playing for the Steelers and decided to receive his Hall of Fame ring from the team despite only playing three of his 15 years in Pittsburgh.http://www.post- gazette.com/sports/steelers/2016/07/14/Kevin-Greene-asked-Steelers-Rooneys-to- have-Hall-of-Fame-ring-ceremony-at-Heinz-Field/stories/201607140179 =Later career= On May 21, 1996, Greene signed with the Carolina Panthers (a two- year $2 million deal) \\"THE INSIDE TRACK; Watch It, World, a Greene Machine Is on the Way\\", Los Angeles Times, May 21, 1996. following their 1995 inaugural season and helped them reach the NFC Championship Game where the team lost to the eventual Super Bowl XXXI champion Green Bay Packers. In 1996, he was named the NFC Linebacker of the Year and received the NEA Defensive Player of the Year Award. In addition the NFL Alumni voted Greene the NFL Linebacker of the Year Award. He was also voted the NFC Player of the Year by the Washington D.C. Touchdown Club. Additionally, he set an NFL record with five consecutive multi-sack games and finished leading the NFL in sacks for the second time in three years with 14. Along the way he was a consensus All-Pro in 1996 for the second time in three years. He was selected to his fourth Pro Bowl. Said by Panther teammate Dwight Stone to be, along with Sam Mills, the most \\"professional guy\\" on the 1996 Panther team. In 1996 the Panthers defense allowed only 96 yards rushing a game and 6 rushing touchdowns against them while sacking opposing quarterbacks 60 times, which led the NFL. The Panthers advanced to the NFC Championship game, where they lost to the Green Bay Packers. After one season with the Panthers and a dispute with the organization, he played one season for the San Francisco 49ers. Greene signed what the 49ers called a six-year, $13 million contract, that included a $750,000 signing bonus on September 25, 1997.\\"GREENE RETURNS AS PANTHERS' ENEMY\\" Greenboro News & Record, September 25, 1997. Greene had been released by the Panthers on August 25, 1997. With the 49ers, Greene had 10.5 sacks. Greene was called on to play the famed \\"Elephant\\" role with the 49ers, the player to rush the passer and come in the games on likely passing downs. While doing so, he chipped in the run game as the 49ers allowed 3.5 yards a rush and Greene had 10.5 of the 49ers 54 sacks. Once again in back-to-back years his season would end in an NFC Championship Game loss to the Packers. After the 1997 holdout and a year with the 49ers Greene re-signed with the Panthers on February 28, 1998.\\"GREENE SIGNS TO RETURN TO PANTHERS\\", Buffalo News, February 28, 1998. In 1998, he repeated his honor of being named NFC Linebacker of the year by the National Football League Players Association (NFLPA). Greene was also named to the Pro Bowl after the 1998 season bringing his Pro Bowl total to five. Greene was tied for third in the NFL for sacks, after Michael Sinclair (16 sacks), Reggie White (16 sacks), and tied with Michael Strahan who also totaled 15 sacks. , Greene's 15.0 sacks in 1998 remains tied with Greg Hardy's 2013 season for the Panthers' franchise record. Greene retired after registering 12 sacks (good for 7th in the NFL) playing as a 4-3 outside linebacker in 1999; he finished his career as a five-time Pro Bowler and the NFL's third all-time sack leader with 160, behind only Bruce Smith and Reggie White. He also finished as the NFL's all-time leader in sacks by a linebacker, ahead of players like Lawrence Taylor, Derrick Thomas, Rickey Jackson, and Andre Tippett; Greene is also one of only four players to lead the NFL in sacks in multiple seasons ('94 with the Steelers and '96 with the Panthers). He is also tied for second in career safeties with three and third all-time in fumble recoveries with 26 (which he returned for 136 yards and 2 touchdowns); he described his aggressive style of going after fumbles as \\"a hog going after a sweet tater in the mud\\". During his career, Greene recorded five interceptions, returning them for 53 yards and a touchdown, and he is one of three players to record 10 or more sacks in at least 10 different seasons; he averaged over 10 sacks a year for 15 seasons. Greene ended his career with 160 sacks, 62.5 tackles of running backs behind the line of scrimmage, 23 forced fumbles, 26 recovered fumbles, and 3 defensive touchdowns and 3 safeties. Greene played in 228 games in his 15-year career. Eight times he was among the NFL's Top 10 sackers, leading the NFL twice. Eleven times in his 15 years he led his club in sacks. Played in six conference championships in his 15 seasons. He is considered to be one of the greatest pass rushers of all- time.\\"I was an outside linebacker in a 3-4, so I actually had coverage responsibilities. So my rush was more limited. But, still, I think my numbers match up pretty good, even with those that rushed the passer every passing down.\\" Wrestling career Greene had a couple of short stints in World Championship Wrestling. He debuted in WCW as a tag team partner for fellow NFL alum Steve McMichael, but McMichael turned on him in favor of joining the Four Horsemen. Greene disappeared from WCW for several months before returning to get revenge on McMichael in a singles match, where he defeated McMichael when the latter's ally Jeff Jarrett accidentally nailed McMichael with a briefcase. In May 1997 he teamed with Roddy Piper and Ric Flair to take on the nWo team of Kevin Nash, Scott Hall and Syxx in a winning effort at Slamboree. He then made a final return in mid-1998, teaming with former football player Bill Goldberg against the nWo Black and White. Greene left wrestling when NFL teams began requiring a \\"no wrestling\\" clause in his contract. Greene utilized the powerslam as a finishing manoeuvre and also included the diving forearm smash, figure four leglock and scoop slam into his arsenal. Coaching career During the 2008 season Greene, along with former Steeler Jason Gildon, served an internship for the Pittsburgh Steelers as an assistant linebackers coach during training camp. On January 26, 2009, Greene was hired as an Outside Linebackers Coach for the Green Bay Packers by Dom Capers. The Packers were transitioning into a 3-4 base defense from their traditional 4-3 base. Greene played for Capers for two years as a Steeler, and then followed Capers to Carolina when Capers was named first head coach of the Panthers. On February 6, 2011, the Packers won Super Bowl XLV, the first time Greene had ever been part of an NFL championship team. On January 17, 2014, it was announced that he would be stepping away from coaching \\"in order to spend more time with (his) wife, Tara, and (his) children, Gavin and Gabrielle\\". He hopes to return to coaching after his children are in college. In January 2017, the New York Jets hired Greene as their outside linebackers coach. Greene replaced Mark Collins, who was one of five assistants not brought back by head coach Todd Bowles for the 2017 season.http://pro32.ap.org/article/jets-hire-kevin-greene- outside-linebackers-coach Career notes * Inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame August 6, 2016. * Third all-time in career sacks with 160 (Bruce Smith - 200, and Reggie White - 198) * Was a semi-finalist for the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015. * Was a finalist for the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016. * Is a member of the Alabama Sports Hall of Fame, class of 2002. * Wore #90 at Auburn and #91 throughout his NFL career. * Served as a captain during a 16-year Army Reserve career, drilling at Fort Knox after his professional football season had ended.

Notable works Some of his major public projects have included BRIGHT CANYON, which was presented by the Times Square Alliance and used Times Square's electronic billboards to create the illusion of a beautiful canyon with waterfalls and animals (2014); \\"The Fluid\\", an animation installation on dozens of screens inside the Fulton Street Subway Station (2017); LEAP, a video projection in New York City's Columbus Circle, presented by Creative Time (2000); and Commutable, where he gilded the commuter and bike path on the Williamsburg Bridge in 22k gold, presented by the Public Art Fund on the Lower East Side (1996). Notable concepts =Cycles= In an interview with Patricia Maloney, Doyle refers to a painting series called The Course of an Empire, by Thomas Cole. From this painting series, which delves into how our understanding of our relationship with the environment has created a sense of menace. Doyle was intrigued by the cyclicality of civilization and created a series of animations, beginning with the \\"fulcrum moment of disaster,\\" in his piece Apocalypse Management. In the original painting series, Cole depicts a brief rise to glory and followed by a sudden and dramatic collapse and overtaking by nature. This could be interpreted as an allusion to a situation quickly and without warning getting out of control.Guy Jordan (2012) Thomas Cole's Intemperate Empire, Visual Resources, 28:4, 340-354, DOI: 10.1080/01973762.2012.732095 Likewise, Doyle also focused on how quickly something can get out of control, but also how it rebuilds. In his interview with Patricia Maloney, he discussed his interest in how our relationship with nature is constantly changing in a cyclical form, and he wanted to focus on the cultural interpretation of nature rather than nature itself. =Man and nature= In an interview with 21c Museum, Doyle goes into further detail about his view on the interaction of man and nature.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oc5jP5jnEwg Doyle says that he does not believe in \\"the duality between man and nature,\\" and that everything we make, including all of our trash and pollution are just an extension of nature. He believes that we have been taught to think of ourselves as separate from animals and nature, and his pieces such as Bright Canyon are meant to connect people and make them feel whole with nature. These pieces psychologically could have a very positive effect on the viewer. According to the Journal of Environmental Psychology, even small exposure to \\"nature-related stimuli\\" can decrease anxiety, and even help one stop dwelling on persistent thoughts.Mariya Davydenko, Johanna Peetz, Time grows on trees: The effect of nature settings on time perception, Journal of Environmental Psychology, Volume 54, 2017, Pages 20-26, ISSN 0272-4944, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvp.2017.09.003. Doyle's piece reconnected Times Square to the natural environment it had been before the city had been built, exposing any passer-by to the positive effects of being connected to nature. =Place at a specific time= In 1996, Doyle created the piece Commutable with the Public Art Fund in New York. The piece was $7,500 of 22k gold gilded on the stairway and bike path on the Manhattan side of the Williamsburg Bridge. As people used this path, they in turn tracked gold flakes throughout the surrounding areas. This piece was different from his usual work because instead of creating a piece that was for people to look at or walk around, he \\"wanted to do something people could use.\\" He wanted this piece to bring attention to an area that was seemingly abandoned by the city after construction was halted on the bridge. Even though he knew the bridge would one day be demolished, he explained that it is not about making a monument, but about transforming a place at a specific time. Like other art exhibits that make use of a community or area, this piece was greatly appreciated by pedestrians walking and riding along the bridge. According to Joshua Guetzkow in his article \\"How the Arts Impact Communities\\", art pieces such as this help communities \\"build social capital by boosting individuals‚Äô ability and motivation to be civically engaged, as well as building organizational capacity for effective action.\\"Guetzkow, Joshua. \\"How the arts impact communities.\\" Centre for Arts and Cultural Policy Studies (2002): 7-8. By creating a venue that brought people together and brought attention to this \\"benighted\\" area, as Doyle calls it, he was able to make a positive impact on residents and quite possibly a sight that will persist in their memories.

They have made over 350 flavours during their -year history, the most popular being Poor Bear, a mix of Vanilla ice cream and Honeycomb. They are the largest producer of dairy ice cream in Northern Ireland. In 2004 they were the first ice cream producer in the island of Ireland to be crowned 'Champion of Champions' by the Ice Cream Alliance. History Mauds Ice Creams was founded by John Wilson and was originally part of his grocery business in Carnmoney, Co. Antrim, Northern Ireland. The ice cream business quickly became the major part of John's grocery store and on Mothers' Day 1982 John renamed his store, Mauds Ice Creams, as a Mother's Day gift to his mother, Maud. Today, Mauds Ice Creams is made in a modern production facility in Carrickfergus . Two of its most popular flavours are Poor Bear (honeycomb and vanilla, which was originally called Pooh Bear's Delight, until Disney opened a store in Belfast and Wilson decided to be cautious) and Belgian Chocolate (fine milk chocolate slivers in vanilla). Their products can be found at over 300 stockists across the whole island of Ireland, including hotels and restaurants. There are \\"flagship\\" stores branded as Caf√© Mauds, in Newcastle, Co.

It is the fifth of the six subdivisions (in ascending order) of the Ordovician System, comprising all those rocks deposited worldwide during the Caradocian Age (458 to 448 million years ago). The limits of Murchison's Caradoc series have since been somewhat modified, and through the labours of Charles Lapworth the several members of the series have been precisely defined by means of graptolitic zones. These zones are identical with those found in the rocks of the same age in North Wales, the Bala Series, and the terms Bala or Caradoc series are used interchangeably by geologists when referring to the uppermost substage of the Ordovician System. The Ordovician rocks of the Caradoc district have been subdivided into the following beds, in descending order: the Trinucleus shales, Acton Scott beds, Longville flags, Chatwell and Soudley sandstones, Harnage shales and Hoar Edge grits and limestone. In the Corndon district in the same county the Caradoc series is represented by the Marrington group of ashes and shales and the Spy Wood group beneath them; these two groups of strata are sometimes spoken of as the Chirbury series. In the Breidden district are the barren Criggeon shales with ashes and flows of andesite. In the Lake district the Coniston limestone series represents the Upper Caradocian, the lower portion being taken up by part of the great Borrowdale volcanic series of rocks. The Coniston limestone series contains the following subdivisions Ashgill group (Ashgill shales and Staurocephalus limestone) - *Kiesley limestone. *Sleddale group (Applethwaite beds Upper Coniston limestone conglomerate; Yarlside rhyolite; stye end beds=Lower Coniston limestone. *Roman Fell group (Corona beds). *The Dufton shales and Drygill shales are equivalents of the Sleddale group. Rocks of Caradoc age are well developed in southern Scotland; in the Girvan district they have been described as the Ardmillan series with the Drummock group and Barren Flagstone group in the upper portion, and the Whitehouse, Ardwell and Balclatchie groups in the lower part. Similarly, two divisions, known as the Upper and Lower Hartfell series, are recognized in the southern and central area, in Peeblesshire, Ayrshire and Dumfriesshire. In Ireland the Caradoc or Bala series is represented by the limestones of Portraine near Dublin and of the Chair of Kildare; by the Ballymoney series of Wexford and Carnalea shales of County Down. In the Lough Mask district beds of this age are found, as in Wales, interstratified with volcanic lavas and tuffs. Other localities are known in counties Tyrone, Meath and Louth, also in Lambay Island. Early descriptions of the Bala series The Bala Series was described as a group of dark slates and sandstones with beds of limestone which occurs in the neighborhood of Bala, Gwynedd, in north Wales. It was first described by Adam Sedgwick, who considered it to be the upper part of his Cambrian System. The Bala limestone is from 20 to thick, and is recognizable over most of North Wales. The series in the type area consists of the Hirnant limestone, a thin inconstant bed, which is separated by . of slates from the Bala limestone, below this are more slates and volcanic rocks. The latter are represented by large contemporaneous deposits of tuff and felsitic lava which in the Snowdon District are several thousand feet thick. In South Wales the Bala Series contains the following beds in descending order: the Trinucleus seticornis beds (Slade beds, Redhill shales and Sholeshook limestone), the Robeston Wathen beds, and the Dicranograplus shales. The typical graptolites are, in the upper part, Dicellograptus anceps and D. complanatus; in the lower part, Pleurograptus linearis and Dicranograptus clingani. References Bibliography *Nat.

He was drafted by the Cleveland Browns in the fourth round of the 2001 NFL Draft and also played for the Dallas Cowboys and Detroit Lions. He played college football at South Florida. High school Henry Attended Estero High School in Estero, Florida. He was named the District MVP in track, after setting school records in the triple jump (44‚Äù1‚Äô) and high jump (6‚Äù6‚Äô). In football, he was named Lee County Athlete of the Year and District Player of the Year. He also lettered in basketball. College career Henry accepted a scholarship from the University of South Florida. He didn't play in his first year because of failing to meet the requirements of Proposition 48, but his work in the classroom eventually allowed the NCAA to grant him an additional year of eligibility in 2000. As freshman he received second-team All-Independent honors at free safety after registering 73 tackles, 2 interceptions and 2 fumble recoveries. The next year, he ranked third on the team with 79 tackles and played quarterback for one series against Valparaiso University. As a junior, he started eight-of-nine games at free safety and registered 62 tackles (fourth on the team), 3 interceptions and 2 fumble recoveries. In his last year he was moved to cornerback, but also saw snaps at free safety and wide receiver, while finishing with 40 tackles, 5 interceptions (led the team), 8 passes defensed (led the team). He was in the first batch of 4-yr letter winners ever in the USF's football program. He ended his collegiate career with 256 tackles (9 for loss), 6 fumble recoveries, 22 passes defensed and led the team in interceptions two years in a row (1999, 2000). Professional career =Cleveland Browns= Henry was selected by the Cleveland Browns in the fourth round of the 2001 NFL Draft. As a rookie, he played in 16 games (2 starts) and tied for the NFL lead in interceptions with 10. Also set a franchise record with a 97-yard interception return for a touchdown. He saw less action his second year. In 2003, he was named the starter at right cornerback. In 2004, he tallied 76 tackles, 4 interceptions and 12 passes defensed. During his four years with the team from 2001 to 2004, he started 39 of 61 games, recording 247 tackles, 17 interceptions, 49 passes defensed and a touchdown. =Dallas Cowboys= Henry signed a five-year, $25 million deal with the Dallas Cowboys as an unrestricted free agent in 2005.http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/columns/story?id=2003511 With a $10 million signing bonus, a $1 million roster bonus in 2005 and a $1 million roster bonus in 2006. He got paid $18 million over the first three years of his contract. He missed four games with a severe groin injury, that also limited him during the last 8 games of the year. In 2006, he was limited with a knee injury but still recorded 90 tackles (third on the team), 23 passes defensed (led the team) and 2 interceptions. In 2007, he was limited with a high ankle sprain and still managed to lead the team with six interceptions (tied for fifth in the NFL). In 2008, he played 16 games (15 starts), registering 55 tackles (35 solo), 7 passes defensed, one interception and 2 sacks. On February 28, 2009, he was traded to the Detroit Lions in exchange for quarterback Jon Kitna.http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=3942507 He played four seasons for the Cowboys from 2005 to 2008, starting 51 of 56 games, recording 215 tackles, 12 interceptions, two sacks, and two touchdowns. =Detroit Lions= Henry was benched in week 5 of the 2009 season because of his play and replaced with Phillip Buchanon.http://www.mlive.com/lions/index.ssf/2009/10/lions_defensive_coordinator_gu_2.html He was not re-signed at the end of the year.

She was classified as a steam sloop and was built in 1816 at Deptford Dockyard specifically for an exploration of the Congo River. Trials with her engine proved disappointing, and it was removed before she embarked on her first voyage. Design and construction Congo was ordered on 13 April 1815 to a design by Sir Robert Seppings. She was laid down in October 1815 and launched on 11 January 1816. The steam engine is recorded as weighing 30 tons and was capable of developing 20 Horse Power. Trials proved that this power, when transmitted to the paddle wheels, could only propel the vessel at about three knots. Such a rate of progress, coupled with unsatisfactory handling characteristics (she was described as very crank) resulted in the engine and paddle wheels being removed. Examination of the situation by James Watt Junior, son of James Watt, could only come up with a recommendation to use the engine for pumping out docks at Plymouth. Thus, Congo sailed to her destination without the steam engine, rigged as a schooner. A sectional profile, deck plan and body plan of Congo are reproduced from draughts held by the National Maritime Museum (Greenwich) in Marquardt's book The Global Schooner. The Congo expedition The expedition, under James Hingston Tuckey, was the first attempt to map the Congo River, and did little beyond prove that the lower river was not navigable beyond from the sea. The other thing it proved was that such expeditions were little more than suicide until medical science had improved - 38 of the 56 expedition members perished, including all of the officers and scientists and the crew that accompanied them inland. The cause of death was a \\"tropical fever\\", probably yellow fever. Most of the survivors were seamen who had stayed with the support vessel Dorothy at the rapids that blocked further progress. It was to be another fifty years before Henry Morton Stanley mapped the river. A full account of the fitting out of the ship and the circumstances of the disastrous expedition are chronicled in Leydon's Historical account of discoveries and travels in Africa (1817). Later career Congo was fitted out as a hulk in 1819 and laid up in the Swale. She was sold at Rye to a J. Harvey on 15 March 1826 for the sum of ¬£146.

Extra-low voltage (ELV) is an electricity supply voltage in a range which carries a low risk of dangerous electrical shock.BS 7671DIN/VDE 0100-410IEC 60364-4-41: Low-voltage electrical installations ‚Äì Part 4-41: Protection for safety ‚Äì Protection against electric shock.IEC 61140: Protection against electric shock ‚Äì Common aspects for installation and equipment. There are various standards that define extra-low voltage. The International Electrotechnical Commission member organizations and the UK IET (BS 7671:2008) define an ELV device or circuit as one in which the electrical potential between conductor or electrical conductor and earth (ground) does not exceed 50 V a.c. or 120 V d.c. (ripple free). The IEC and IET go on to define actual types of extra-low voltage systems, for example SELV, PELV, FELV. These can be supplied using sources including motor / fossil fuel generator sets, transformers, switched PSU's or rechargeable battery. SELV, PELV, FELV, are distinguished by various safety properties, supply characteristics and design voltages. Some types of landscape lighting use SELV / PELV (extra-low voltage) systems. Modern battery operated hand tools fall in the SELV category. In more arduous conditions 25 volts RMS alternating current / 60 volts (ripple-free) direct current can be specified to further reduce hazard. Lower voltage can apply in wet or conductive conditions where there is even greater potential for electric shock. These systems should still fall under the SELV / PELV (ELV) safety specifications. Types =Separated or safety extra-low voltage (SELV)= IEC defines a SELV system as \\"an electrical system in which the voltage cannot exceed ELV under normal conditions, and under single-fault conditions, including earth faults in other circuits\\". It is generally accepted that the acronym: SELV stands for separated extra-low voltage (separated from earth) as defined in installation standards (e.g. BS 7671), though BS EN 60335 refers to it as safety extra-low voltage. A SELV circuit must have: * Electrical protective-separation (i.e. double insulation, reinforced insulation or protective screening) from all circuits other than SELV and PELV (i.e. all circuits that might carry higher voltages) * Simple separation from other SELV systems, from PELV systems and from earth (ground) The safety of a SELV circuit is provided by * The extra-low voltage * The low risk of accidental contact with a higher voltage * The lack of a return path through earth (ground) that electric current could take in case of contact with a human body The design of a SELV circuit typically involves an isolating transformer, guaranteed minimum distances between conductors and electrical insulation barriers. The electrical connectors of SELV circuits should be designed such that they do not mate with connectors commonly used for non-SELV circuits. Typical examples for a SELV circuit: decorative out-door lighting, Class III battery charger, fed from a Class II power supply. Modern cordless hand tools are considered SELV equipment. =Protected extra-low voltage (PELV)= IEC 61140 defines a PELV system as \\"an electrical system in which the voltage cannot exceed ELV under normal conditions, and under single-fault conditions, except earth faults in other circuits\\". A PELV circuit only requires protective-separation from all circuits other than SELV and PELV (i.e., all circuits that might carry higher voltages), but it may have connections to other PELV systems and earth (ground). In contrast to a SELV circuit, a PELV circuit can have a protective earth (ground) connection. A PELV circuit, just as with SELV, requires a design that guarantees a low risk of accidental contact with a higher voltage. For a transformer, this can mean that the primary and secondary windings must be separated by reinforced insulation, or by a conductive shield with a protective earth connection, or that the secondary winding itself has an earthed terminal, so that any primary to secondary fault will cause automatic disconnection. (The principle of double fault to danger requires either basic and additional insulation to fail or basic insulation and the connection to the protective earth to fail simultaneously before danger arises.) A typical example for a PELV circuit is a metal cased computer with a Class I power supply. =Functional extra-low voltage (FELV)= The term functional extra-low voltage (FELV) describes any other extra-low-voltage circuit that does not fulfill the requirements for an SELV or PELV circuit. Although the FELV part of a circuit uses an extra-low voltage, it is not adequately protected from accidental contact with higher voltages in other parts of the circuit. Therefore the protection requirements for the higher voltage have to be applied to the entire circuit. Examples for FELV circuits include those that generate an extra low voltage through a semiconductor device or a potentiometer or an autotransformer. A typical example is an electronically controlled toaster where the electronic timer circuit runs off an extra low voltage derived from a tap on the heating element. Another might be ELV signalling between mains powered smoke alarms, with the signalling voltage referred to supply neutral. In such cases the extra low voltage parts must be enclosed or insulated as to the standard of the mains voltage. =UK Reduced low voltage (RLV)= The IET / BSI (BS 7671) also define Reduced low voltage (RLV) which can be either single phase or three phase A.C. This system has been used for many years on construction sites. Both single and three phase. The single phase voltage is 110 V a.c. though having a \\"centre tapped Earth\\" reducing the voltage to Earth to 55 V a.c. The three phase is 110 V phase to phase, 63 V to Neutral / Earth. This system voltage is slightly above the ELV limit but still very commonly used for cord powered hand tools and temporary lighting in hazardous areas. As it is transformer derived, the exposed voltage during an earth fault is depressed below the ELV level. Stand-alone power systems Cabling for extra-low voltage systems, such as in remote-area power systems (RAPS), is designed to minimise energy losses while maximising safety. Lower voltages require a higher current for the same power. The higher current results in greater resistive losses in the cabling. Cable sizing must therefore consider maximum demand, voltage drop over the cable, and current-carrying capacity. Voltage drop is usually the main factor considered, but current-carrying capacity is as important when considering short, high-current runs such as between a battery bank and inverter. Arcing is a risk in DC ELV systems, and some fuse types which can cause undesired arcing include semi-enclosed, rewireable and automotive fuse types. Instead high rupturing capacity fuses and appropriately rated circuit breakers are the recommended type for RAPS. Cable termination and connections must be done properly to avoid arcing also, and soldering is not recommended. Regulations Precise definitions of \\"extra low voltage\\" are given in applicable wiring regulations in a region. =EU= European Union directives and standards do not define extra-low voltage. The nearest they get to this concept is in the Low Voltage Directive, which applies to the range between 50 V AC / 75 V DC and 1,000 V AC / 1,500 V DC. The directive only covers electrical equipment and not voltages appearing inside equipment or voltages in electrical components. =IEC= IEC 60364 defines ELV as 50 V AC and 120 V DC. =Australia and New Zealand= AS/NZS 3000 Wiring Rules define \\"extra low voltage\\" as \\"Not exceeding 50 V a.c or 120 V ripple-free d.c.\\" However, AS/ACIF S009 Clause 3.1.78.1 Extra-Low Voltage (ELV)states: \\"a voltage not exceeding 42.4 V peak or 60 V d.c.[AS/NZS 60950.1:2003]\\" and adds a note: \\"This definition differs from the ELV definition contained in AS/NZS 3000:2000\\" which is more closely aligned to the Telecommunications Network Voltage (TNV) limits ... i.e. 120 V d.c. or 70.7 V a.c. peak (50 V a.c. r.m.s.)\\" which accommodates telephone ringing voltage on the nominally ‚àí48 Vdc battery supply which could be encountered on a telephone line and was not considered hazardous, whereas 120 Vac without current limiting at its source can inject 115mA into individuals leading to fibrillation of the heart. =Brazil= In Brazil, ELV (Extra-baixa tens√£o or EBT in Portuguese) is officially defined in Regulatory Standard no. 10 from the Brazilian Ministry of Labor and Employment as any voltage \\"not exceeding 50 volts a.c. or 120 volts d.c.\\". Although that standard defines safety rules for electricity, the Regulatory Standard no. 12 requires an even lower voltage for start and stop devices on machines and equipment made from March 2012 and on, stating it shall not exceed 25 volts a.c. or 60 volts d.c.

Baines (pp. 77-79) gives Hungary as one of the countries possessing the duda, which has this construction, also a Hungarian bagpipe with a diple (i.e., twin-bore) chanter, one bore of which gives a variable drone, the bag pipe having a bass drone in addition. Robert Bright in Travels through Lower Hungary(1818), quoted by Flood (p. 79), describes the Hungarian bagpipe as having two drones and a chanter of square section (in other worlds the Dudelsack). Fraser (p. 243) has a picture of a Hungarian bagpipe with one chanter and one drone of medium length, probably a bass drone. It seems possible that all these forms of the instrument may be in use. Features The chanter of a magyar duda. Note the double chanter and the carved animal head stock. The single finger hole of the kontra pipe is hidden behind the cow-horn chanter bell The most characteristic feature of the magyar duda is the double-bored chanter. One chanter bore, the dallams√≠p (\\"melody pipe\\"), plays the melody within an octave range. The second chanter, the kontras√≠p or kontra (\\"contra pipe\\") has a single finger hole and sounds either the lowest note on the melody pipe or drops to the dominant (i.e., on a pipe in A it sounds either A or E). Hungarian piping is characterized by use of the kontra to provide rhythmic accompaniment and to vary the drone sound. The melody pipe has a \\"flea hole\\", a common feature in Eastern bagpipes: the top hole on the chanter is very small and uncovering it raises the pitch of any other note by approximately a semitone, making the Hungarian pipe largely chromatic over its range (it lacks a major seventh). In some historic examples, the magyar duda was tuned with a neutral (i.e., between the major and the minor in pitch) third and sixth and the flea hole was filled in with wax. There is considerable variation in physical appearance of the duda in Hungary, but the most common form has a chanter stock in the form of an animal‚Äôs head (usually that of a goat-like animal) and a cow horn bell on both the kontra and the drone. Historically the bag was often made from dog skin (leading to a popular song that stated that prospective bagpipers needed to ‚Äúgo to hell because that‚Äôs where the big dogs are from which good bagpipes can be made‚Äù), but today goat skin is a much more common material. Other variations Other variations of the duda, especially those played along the Slovakian and Croatian borders, have as many as four chanter pipes. In these examples one hand plays the dominant through the octave on one pipe while the other hand plays the tonic through the subdominant on another (in this case the tonic through the subdominant have no chromatic possibilities except through half-holing since the flea hole is on a separate pipe). If a fourth pipe is added it is a stopped pipe with a thumb hole that sounds the octave when uncovered. (These pipes show the influence of Croatian and Slovakian pipes, both of which commonly have up to four separate chanter bores.) Hungarian bagpiping Hungarian bagpiping is characterized in its styling by hiccupping, use of high notes to articulate lower notes, creating a characteristic rhythmic squeaking while the instrument is played. This playing style greatly influenced certain genres of fiddle music in Hungary, and also characterized early church organ music in Hungary: prior to the introduction of organs, the duda had been used to accompany hymnody in churches. History Up until the 1920s the duda was the preferred instrument at celebrations in much of Hungary. As the Hungarian economy improved and the pastoral lifestyle declined in importance, the lone piper at a country ball or wedding was increasingly replaced by professional Gypsy bands (cig√°nyzenekar) that played an urban repertoire on more complex and capable instruments. The Hungarian bagpipe was essentially extinct except in small pockets by the 1950s but was ‚Äúrescued‚Äù as part of the Hungarian folk revival, and is today a very popular instrument among Hungarian folk bands and their fans. B√©la Bart√≥k's composition \\"Bagpipe,\\" from Volume 5 of Mikrokosmos, is a piano piece that imitates the sound of the duda. =Duda folklore= As was the case in much of Europe, bagpipes in Hungary were associated with shepherds and a pastoral lifestyle, and were often used in Christmas scenes to evoke the shepherds of the nativity. At the same time the duda was associated with the pagan lifestyle of the countryside. Aside from the above-mentioned song about bagpipers needing to go to hell, according to J√°nos Manga‚Äôs article ‚ÄòHungarian Bagpipers‚Äô (Acta ethnographica Academi√¶ Scientiarum Hungaric√¶ xiv(1‚Äì2):1‚Äì97) there were many legends about bagpipes that could play themselves when hung from the wall on a nail or about pipers summoned to Witches' Sabbaths to perform for satanic hosts. Despite these stories, the duda never received the same sort of official censure in Catholic Hungary that bagpipes did in many Protestant nations. =Recordings= There are a number of excellent recordings of the magyar duda, including CDs from the groups T√©ka and Muzsik√°s, the soloist Bal√°zs Istv√°nfi, and the Magyar Dudazenekar See also *Bock (bagpipe) (dudy) References External links * Category:Bagpipes Category:Hungarian musical instruments ","title":"Duda"},{"id":"2446580","text":"Government Camp is an unincorporated community and census-designated place located in Clackamas County, Oregon, United States, on the base of Mount Hood and north of Tom Dick and Harry Mountain.

When Alabama became a state in 1819, the state legislature adopted the design as the official state seal. The seal prominently features a map showing one of the state's most valuable resources--its major rivers. The map was shown affixed to a living tree, with no motto.

The aircraft was a Fokker F28-1000 Fellowship twin jet. It crashed after only 49 seconds because it was not able to attain sufficient altitude to clear the trees beyond the end of the runway, due to ice and snow on the wings.http://epe.lac-bac.gc.ca/100/200/301/pco- bcp/commissions- ef/moshansky1992-eng/moshansky1992vol1-eng/moshansky1992vol1-part2-eng.pdf A similar accident happened in 1992 when USAir Flight 405 crashed into Flushing Bay on takeoff at LaGuardia Airport, after ice had accumulated on the wings during the taxi.  Aircraft and crew The aircraft, a Fokker F28-1000, had been manufactured in 1972 and had been in service since 1973. The aircraft had been used by Air Ontario since November 1987. It was one of two F28-1000s operated by the airline.Disclaimer ‚Äì Electronic Collection. Epe.lac-bac.gc.ca. The flight was under the command of veteran pilot Captain George John Morwood (52). He was an experienced airman who had been flying for approximately 34 years. He had roughly 24,100 flying hours. His first officer was Keith Mills (35). Mills was also a highly experienced pilot, having accrued more than 10,000 hours of flying time.95.1. Crm-devel.org. Both pilots were new to the F28-1000, having fewer than 150 hours between them on the aircraft type.  Accident  The flight had departed from Thunder Bay bound for Winnipeg with an intermediate stop in Dryden where the aircraft struck trees shortly after takeoff and then disintegrated on impact, causing the deaths of 21 of the 65 passengers and 3 of the 4 crew members on board, including both pilots. Investigation The fierce post-crash fire resulted in severe damage to both the Cockpit Voice Recorder and the Flight Data Recorder; neither of these units could be read as a result. Because of this, the investigative effort relied almost entirely on witness statements regarding the crash and the events leading up to it. The investigation revealed that an unserviceable auxiliary power unit (APU), and no available external power unit at Dryden Regional Airport, led to questionable decision-making which was a critical factor leading to the crash of Flight 1363. If the engines had been turned off, they could not have been restarted again due to the unserviceability of the APU and lack of external power. Therefore, the port engine was left running during the stopover in Dryden. Snow was falling gently that afternoon and a layer of 0.6 to 1.3 centimetres of snow had accumulated on the wings. The wings needed to be de-iced before takeoff, but the Fokker F28 aircraft is never supposed to be de-iced while the engines are running because of a risk of toxic fumes entering the cabin of the aircraft. The pilot therefore did not request to have the wings de-iced; at the time, airline instructions were unclear on this point but the subsequent report was very critical of this decision. Fuel needed to be loaded and was done with the engine running while passengers were on board (known as a hot refuel). Off-loading and reloading passengers would have taken considerable time and the longer the aircraft stayed on the ground the greater was the need for the wings to be sprayed with de-icing fluid. To prevent further delay and a greater possibility of a buildup on the wings, Captain Morwood decided to have the aircraft fuelled while the engine was running and with passengers on board. This procedure was not then, and is not now, prohibited by Transport Canada. Airline instructions were also inconsistent. Result The accident investigation was subsumed into a judicial inquiry under the Honourable Virgil P. Moshansky. His report showed that competitive pressures caused by commercial deregulation cut into safety standards and that many of the industry's sloppy practices and questionable procedures placed the pilot in a very difficult situation. The report also stated that the aircraft should not have been scheduled to refuel at an airport which did not have proper equipment and that neither training nor manuals had sufficiently warned the pilot of the dangers of ice on the wings. Moshansky blamed Transport Canada for letting Air Ontario expand into the operation of bigger, more complicated aircraft without detecting the deficiencies of their existing aircraft. After the crash of Air Ontario Flight 1363, many significant changes were made to the Canadian Aviation Regulations. These included new procedures regarding re-fuelling and de-icing as well as many new regulations intended to improve the general safety of all future flights in Canada. Specifically these referred to the effectiveness of certain deicing fluids over time and the increased use of Type II fluid. This mixture includes polymerising agents, which make the deicing effect last longer. Air Ontario 1363 Memorial Site  Memorial  A memorial is located on MacArthur Road.

McNally pursued further education in physics and astronomy at the University of California-Los Angeles, and then obtained a Ph.D. in astronomy at Fordham University in New York City in 1926. He was a faculty member in the departments of astronomy and physics at Fordham and Boston College thereafter. He was elected to fellowship in the Royal Astronomical Society in 1929. Director of Georgetown Observatory In 1928, he had been asked to become the director of the Georgetown Observatory, succeeding Rev. Edward C.

He participated in solar eclipse expeditions that were sponsored by the National Geographic Society in Siberia in 1936; in Canton Island in 1937; and in Patos, Brazil in 1940. Administrator After the outbreak of World War II, McNally was charged with coordinating all liaison efforts between the science departments at Georgetown University and the U.S. government, regarding the war effort. His success in that role resulted in his subsequent appointment as chief fund-raiser for a new university hospital at Georgetown in 1945 and he later became a Vice President at the institution. In 1946 McNally was appointed as the Georgetown University School of Medicine's Dean and Regent. Illness and death Father McNally developed symptomatic coronary artery disease in 1952, and had the first of several myocardial infarcts (heart attacks). Consequently, he had to resign his deanship and was succeeded by Francis M. Forster.

Headrick, The Legal Profession: Is it for you? (Cincinnati: Thomson Executive Press, 1996), 83. Rather than simply laying out the legal doctrine in a particular area of study, a casebook contains excerpts from legal cases in which the law of that area was applied. It is then up to the student to analyze the language of the case in order to determine what rule was applied and how the court applied it. Casebooks sometimes also contain excerpts from law review articles and legal treatises, historical notes, editorial commentary, and other related materials to provide background for the cases. The teaching style based on casebooks is known as the casebook method and is supposed to instill in law students how to \\"think like a lawyer.\\" The casebook method is most often used in law schools in countries with common law legal systems, where case law is a major source of law. Most casebooks are authored by law professors, usually with two, three, or four authors, at least one of whom will be a professor at the top of his or her field in the area under discussion. New editions of casebooks often retain the names of famous professors on their covers decades after those professors have died. Updating of the books, then, falls on the shoulders of a younger generation of their colleagues. Such casebooks are often known by the names of the leading professor authors, such as Prosser, Wade, & Schwartz's, Torts: Cases & Materials (now in a 13th edition). The leading publishers of casebooks in the United States are Thomson West (publisher of the Foundation Press and American Casebook Series imprints), Aspen Publishing, and LexisNexis. Each of these publishers uses a quickly identifiable color and pattern for their book covers across all subjects. Traditionally, the covers of casebooks came in the colors red, blue, or brown, although West's American Casebook Series has since switched to faded black cloth as an environmentally-friendly move. The prevalence of the casebook method in American law schools has given rise to a market for commercial study aids \\"keyed\\" to a particular casebook edition.Anderson, 84. These study aids are generally summaries (\\"briefs\\") of the cases from the casebook to which it is \\"keyed,\\" presenting them in the same order as the casebook. Often written by the same author who wrote the associated casebook, and published by the same company, \\"keyed\\" study aids are useful in distilling cases down to black-letter law. Popular study aid product lines include Legalines, High Court Case Summaries, and Gilbert Law Summaries published by West Thomson Reuters, Casenotes Legal Briefs by Aspen, and the Understanding series and Q&A; series by LexisNexis.

The band was on both the 2005 and 2006 Warped Tours. Biography A Change of Pace formed in 2001 when singer Torry Jasper and drummer Jonathan Kelly began playing together in freshmen year of high school (while attending Centennial High School). In 2003, after a few years of jamming and playing small local shows, bassist Johnny Abdullah and guitarist Adam Rodgers joined the band. From there they were discovered by manager Jorge Hernandez, and within a few months they had a deal with Immortal Records and released their EP Change Is The Only Constant. In 2005 the band released their first full-length album, An Offer You Can't Refuse, and landed a spot on the Vans Warped Tour. Just a year after their first album, on August 15 A Change of Pace released their second record, Prepare The Masses. The band also added a fifth member to the band, Dan Parker (previously in Don't Let Go). On June 1, 2008 the band announced that they had parted ways with former vocalist Torry Jasper, and announced a new lead singer, Micah Bentley. They also announced the release of their EP, Just No Better Way. With new singer Micah Bentley they have adopted a lighter tone to their music, contrasting drastically with their previous singer Torry Jasper who screamed vocals in the older material. The band released their third and final album, entitled It Could Be Worse on February 22, 2011. Breakup and departure of Micah Bentley On March 13, 2011, drummer Jon Kelley announced via Facebook that after 10 years, A Change of Pace was calling it quits. Their last show, \\"A Change of Pace Farewell Show\\", took place on April 22, at The Clubhouse in Tempe. Opening bands included Greeley Estates, Desole, It's Like Love, and In It for Storms. In April 2011, A Change Of Pace played their final show with singer Micah Bentley as he began to prepare for his solo career. Reunion, new album and return of Torry Jasper On Christmas Day 2011, A Change Of Pace was asked to reunite with Torry Jasper and play the ‚ÄòSouth By So What‚Äô festival in Dallas, Texas on March 17 of 2012. After several discussions, the band agreed to perform at the festival with other acts such as The Early November, Motion City Soundtrack, HelloGoodbye and Cartel. After several meetings, the band decided to work on an album with Torry Jasper. However, this album was never released. Prepare The Masses 10th anniversary shows and second breakup In May 2016, the band announced two concerts to celebrate the 10 year anniversary of Prepare The Masses, the first show which took place on July 30, 2016 at The Pressroom in Phoenix, AZ and the second show took place at the Chain Reaction in Anaheim, CA on August 6, 2016. On August 5, the band announced that the show at the Chain Reaction would be their last.  Second reunion  In February 2019, the band posted a cryptic date June 22 to their social media pages. The band later revealed they would be headlining the first \\"Pop Punk Nite\\" at The Van Buren in Phoenix, AZ on June 22.  Post-breakup  In 2011, Micah Bentley married Ashley Bentley. Bentley currently lives with his wife in Peoria, Arizona where he continues to write music for his new project. This new project is called \\"Micah and His Friend\\". Jonathan Kelley graduated from medical school at Midwestern University in Glendale, Arizona and is currently completing an emergency medicine residency at Maricopa Medical Center.

The PKN is the continuation of the Dutch Reformed Church, the Reformed Churches in the Netherlands and the Evangelical-Lutheran Church in the Kingdom of the Netherlands. History The Reformed Churches in the Netherlands was founded in 1892 in a merger of two groups that had split off from the Dutch Reformed Church (Nederlandse Hervormde Kerk): * a part of the Christian Reformed Church in the Netherlands (Christelijke Gereformeerde Kerk in Nederland, CGKN), which originated in the Afscheiding (\\"Secession\\") of 1834, and * the group around Abraham Kuyper, which was formed in the Doleantie of 1886. The other part of the CGKN that stayed out of this union remains independent; it was renamed to \\"Christian Reformed Churches\\" in 1947. Abraham Kuyper was the most important leader of the movement, and under his leadership the gereformeerden became a separate so-called \\"pillar\\" in Dutch society, next to the hervormden and the Roman Catholics. Part of the gereformeerde pillar were for example the VU University Amsterdam and the Anti Revolutionary Party, a political party now part of the Christian Democratic Appeal. Since its founding in 1892, two groups have separated from the GKN (Gereformeerde Kerk Nederland). The first split was in 1926, over a conflict about biblical interpretation: the orthodox majority maintained the historicity of the account of Adam and Eve, while the more liberal wing deemed it merely allegorical and left to form the Gereformeerde Kerken in Hersteld Verband. In 1971/1972, the GKN renounced the historic position. The second schism, called the Vrijmaking (\\"Liberation\\", that is: from synodal authority), occurred in 1944, when the Reformed Churches in the Netherlands (Liberated) (Gereformeerde Kerken vrijgemaakt) split off from the Reformed Churches in the Netherlands. The long process of reuniting with the Dutch Reformed Church began in 1962 and ended on May 1, 2004, when the GKN, the NHK and the Evangelical Lutheran Church merged to form the Protestant Church in the Netherlands. At that time, the Reformed Churches in the Netherlands had around 675,000 members, 400,000 of whom were churchgoers. There were 857 congregations, with some 1,000 church buildings. Seven congregations did not agree with the merger and founded the Continued Reformed Churches in the Netherlands (voortgezette Gereformeerde Kerken in Nederland) on May 8, 2004. Theology Until World War II, the Gereformeerde Kerk was characterized by a classical neo-Calvinist belief. The church thought of itself as the most true church of Christ. The main influence on the theological views was from Abraham Kuyper and Herman Bavinck. After World War II, the character of the church changed. After 1962, the church became an open church, with space and freedom for various beliefs. Modern theologians in the gereformeerde church are Gerrit Cornelis Berkouwer (1903‚Äì96) and Harry M. Kuitert (1924‚Äì2017).

Education Although born in Port Elizabeth, Dunell was educated in England at Eton College and at Trinity College, Oxford, where he graduated BA in 1878 and Master of Arts in 1883. Cricket career He played only three first-class games, two of them Test matches, although he was captain only in the first, being replaced by William Milton for the second game. His only other first-class match was for Port Elizabeth against Natal the following year. Football career He also played football in his youth, in position of full back, for Oxford University as well as two matches as a football 'Blue' with Cambridge University in 1877 and 1878. C.W. Alcock described him as \\"a very safe and neat kick; a thoroughly reliable back, though a little wanting, perhaps, in pace\\". He appeared in the 1877 FA Cup Final against Wanderers at Kennington Oval, which his team lost. He was a member of the Football Association committee in 1878. Later life Dunell spent some time in business in Natal, but settled in England, living at New Alresford, Hampshire, ultimately in South Kensington, London.

Znamenny Chant is unison, melismatic liturgical singing that has its own specific notation, called the stolp notation. The symbols used in the stolp notation are called ' (, 'hooks') or ' (, 'signs'). Often the names of the signs are used to refer to the stolp notation. Znamenny melodies are part of a system, consisting of Eight Tones (intonation structures; called glasy); the melodies are characterized by fluency and well-balancedness . There exist several types of Znamenny Chant: the so-called Stolpovoy, Malyj (Little) and Bolshoy (Great) Znamenny Chant. Ruthenian Chant (Prostopinije) is sometimes considered a sub-division of the Znamenny Chant tradition, with the Muscovite Chant (Znamenny Chant proper) being the second branch of the same musical continuum. Notation Znamenny Chants are not written with notes (the so- called linear notation), but with special signs, called Znam√´na (Russian for \\"marks\\", \\"banners\\") or Kryuki (\\"hooks\\"), as some shapes of these signs resemble hooks. Each sign may include the following components: a large black hook or a black stroke, several smaller black 'points' and 'commas' and lines near the hook or crossing the hook. Some signs may mean only one note, some 2 to 4 notes, and some a whole melody of more than 10 notes with a complicated rhythmic structure. A hand-drawn lubok featuring 'hook and banner notation'. The stolp notation was developed in Kievan Rus' as an East Slavic refinement of the Byzantine neumatic musical notation. The most notable feature of this notation system is that it records transitions of the melody, rather than notes. The signs also represent a mood and a gradation of how this part of melody is to be sung (tempo, strength, devotion, meekness, etc.) Every sign has its own name and also features as a spiritual symbol. For example, there is a specific sign, called \\"little dove\\" (Russian: –≥–æ–ª—É–±—á–∏–∫ (golubchik)), which represents two rising sounds, but which is also a symbol of the Holy Ghost. After the fall of Kievan Rus' to the Mongols, the Znamenny Chant and stolp notation continued to develop to the North (particularly in Novgorod), where it flourished and was adopted throughout the Grand Duchy of Moscow. Gradually the system became more and more complicated. This system was also ambiguous, so that almost no one, except the most trained and educated singers, could sing an unknown melody at sight. The signs only helped to reproduce the melody, not coding it in an unambiguous way. Because of the complexity of the system, a simplification was developed by Ivan Shaidurov around 1600,Velimirovic, Milos. \\"The Present status of Research in Slavic Chant\\". Acta Musicologica. Vol. 44, Fasc. 2 (Jul. ‚Äì Dec., 1972), pp. 251 called \\"red marks\\" (Russian: –∫–∏–Ω–æ–≤–∞—Ä–Ω—ã–µ –∑–Ω–∞–∫–∏ (kinovarnye znaki)), which consisted of small letters in red and which were placed before each Znamenny sign. These indicate the highest note of the sign it stands before. This is generally regarded as the first step towards a certain simplification of the system. The use and evolution of the system stopped in the middle of the 17th century, after the church reforms by Patriarch Nikon. From that time Western music started to penetrate into Russian culture, and the Russian-Orthodox Church introduced a \\"Latin\\", polyphonic way of singing, based on Polish, German and Italian harmonies. The term \\"Latin\\" however was considered derogatory, since it also referred to \\"heretical Latin faith\\". Znamenny Chant, however, has been preserved to a certain degree in the chanting traditions that are directly descended from it. Currently, stolp notation (Znamenny signs) continues to be used by Russian Old Believers, mostly in combination with the above-mentioned \\"red marks\\", as shown in the first illustration. In the 19th century Edinovertsy, particularly outside Russia, have tried to move to the modern neumatic form of notation that tries to capture exact relations between pitches; and they currently use a standard linear notation. Chanting traditions that preserve and/or are descended from the Znammeny chant include the following: * Chanting traditions of the Russian Old Believers ** Znamenny chant proper (–ó–Ω–∞–º—è, –ë–æ–ª—å—à–æ–µ –ó–Ω–∞–º—è) ** Stolpovoy chant ** Demesvenny chant or Demestvo (–î–µ–º–µ—Å—Ç–≤–æ) ** Pomorsky chant ** Kievan chant * 'Ukrainian Chants' ** The chanting tradition of Galicia (known as Samoilka chant) ** Prostopinije (or Plain Chant) of the Carpatho-Rusyns * Valaam chant * Doukhobor Psalm chant may also be derivative or at least related cf. F. Mark Mealing/Our People's Way/A Study in Doukhobor Hymnody & Folklife. U. Penna, 1972. The Strochnoy chant (early Russian polyphony) was also based on Znamenny chant, and although it is not widely used in the church practice now, it can be occasionally performed by some choirs. Many Russian composers (Sergei Rachmaninov, Alexander Grechaninov, Maximilian Steinberg, and Vladimir Martynov) studied Znamenny chants and used them in their compositions. There are also many adaptations of Znamenny melodies for four-part choir, popular in both Russia and abroad. Performing practice Because Znamenny Chant requires a specific manner of performance, the chant books contain several instructions as to dynamics and tempo. For the Old Believers church chant also has an educational function: one has to sing in such a way that the sound astonishes the ear and the truth, enclosed in the chants, penetrates the heart. Znamenny performance practice excludes classical vocal training. Singers perform with their own, natural voices, sometimes in a style reminiscent of folk music. Znamenny Chant does not have any pauses or rests, and all chants are performed fluently. Ideally, singers will sing in such a way that their voices become united in one single voice. Originally Znamenny Chant was performed only by male voices. Today, on account of the small number of people able to sing at church services and the evolution of the tradition, it is usually performed by both male and female voices.

As its name suggests, the school's enrollment is all female. Established in 1848, it was one of the first public schools for women. It is a magnet school in the School District of Philadelphia with a competitive admissions process. Vincit qui se vincit (she conquers who conquers herself) is the school‚Äôs motto. The school is located at Broad Street and Olney Avenue in the Logan section of Philadelphia. History Girls Normal School, Sergeant St. above 9th, 1853 Girls High School, 17th and Spring Garden Sts., 1876 New Girls Normal School, 13th and Spring Garden Sts., 1893 The previous Girls' High campus, now Julia R. Masterman School, which housed the school from 1933 to 1958 In 1848, the Girls' Normal School was established as the first secondary public school for women in Pennsylvania. It was also the first municipally supported teachers' school in the U.S. The first instructional session was held on February 1, 1848. By June 1848, there were 149 enrolled students, an incredibly large enrollment for a school at that time. The school continued to grow, forcing a move in 1854 to Sergeant Street between Ninth and Tenth Streets. In April 1854, the name of the school was changed to the Girls' High School of Philadelphia. By June 1860, 65 graduates had received diplomas bearing the Girls' High School name. In 1860, the name of the school was again changed to The Girls' High and Normal School to better define the \\"design of the institution\\" as a school for an education confined to academic subjects and for future teachers. In October 1876, a new school which \\"for convenience and comfort will probably have no superior\\" was constructed at Seventeenth and Spring Garden Streets. At the time it was surpassed in size only by Girard College and the University of Pennsylvania. In 1893, the High School and Normal School were separated into two distinct institutions. It was at this time that the institution became known as the Philadelphia High School for Girls. The school offered three parallel courses: a general course of three years with a possible postgraduate year, a classical course of four years, and a business course of three years. In 1898, a Latin- Scientific course \\"was designed to prepare students for the Women's Medical College, Cornell, Vassar, Wellesley, Smith, Barnard, or such courses in the University of Pennsylvania as were open to women.\\" In the early 1930s, the school survived attempts to merge it with William Penn High School. Alumnae, faculty and friends of the school dedicated themselves to its preservation. The school emerged from this crisis with its current identity as a place for the education of academically talented young women. In 1933, a new school was erected at Seventeenth and Spring Garden Streets to replace the one which had stood on the site since 1876. This historic building, now the site of Julia R. Masterman School, was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1976. In May 1976, Vice Principal Dr. Florence Snite sued Katherine Day for libel because she had organized a demonstration protesting the administration's policy which barred lesbian alumnae from attending the prom.HQ75.

In 1958, the school again outgrew its location and moved to its current site at Broad Street and Olney Avenue. Located down the street at Ogontz and Olney Avenue is Central High School, which, until 1983, was an all-male school. Prior to Central turning co-educational, the two schools enjoyed a strong partnership. Graduating classes at Girls' are known not by class year (e.g., \\"the class of 2008\\") but rather by class number (e.g., \\"the 252nd graduating class\\"). This is because of the former practice of semiannual graduation. As annual graduations were instituted, the practice of referring to class numbers remained. Many fine traditions have survived Girls' long history. Annual celebrations include Contest and County Fair. Graduation traditions also continue. Girls' High graduations were formerly held at the Academy of Music. Currently, they are held at the Kimmel Center for the Performing Arts. Students wear white dresses no higher than knee length and carry red flowers. The students purchase their own dresses in any style but the rules of color and length are enforced. Due to budget cuts, Girls' High will now be losing staff including counselors in the 2013-14 school year. Also, some clubs may be eliminated from the school. As of 1984, Girls' High had the unique distinction of being the only high school in the U.S. to have had three graduates selected as White House Fellows since the program was started by President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964. In 2000, the school had its first Million Dollar Scholar. She received a perfect grade- point average and was offered $1 million in college scholarships. Traditions * Big Sister, Little Sister ‚Äì Seniors are paired with incoming freshmen and act as their \\"big sisters\\". The \\"big sisters\\" provide transitional support to their \\"little sisters\\". * Freshman Day, Sophomore Day, Junior Day ‚Äì Each class is given a day to honor it. Students of the honored class generally sport flowers in their class color, host an auditorium show, and have a tea or other social gathering. * Senior Day ‚Äì Graduating seniors are given awards for their academic and extracurricular achievements. After the awards ceremony they have lunch, often on the Spirit of Philadelphia or at the Chart House. * Contest ‚Äì started in 1913 and has evolved over the years. The seniors and freshmen team up to compete against the sophomores and juniors in a variety of competitions that span a few weeks. * County Fair ‚Äì A schoolwide all-afternoon fair in which each advisory class contributes food, games, and entertainment. All the money earned during county fair is given to a charity of choice by the winning advisory. * Songs of the Season ‚Äì The school's holiday show. The program begins with the procession of members of the school's Treble Clef Choir through a completely dark auditorium. Each choir member carries a single lit candle and chants \\"Hodie Christus Natus Est\\" by Benjamin Britten. The show continues with holiday performances by the school's various extracurricular groups and ethnic clubs. Jill Scott (a Girls' High alumna) made an appearance at Songs of the Season in 2006. * Career Day ‚Äì Alumnae return for a day to give presentations about their careers. * Holiday Open House ‚Äì Every year, alumnae return to the school for a Holiday Open House.

It was presumably composed by the balladeer Marx Augustin in 1679, though written documents only date back to about 1800. Background In 1679, Vienna was struck by the Great Plague and Augustin was a ballad singer and bagpiper, who toured the city's inns entertaining people. The Viennese loved Augustin because of his charming humour in bitter times, and they called him (Dear Augustin). According to legend, once he was drunk and on his way home he fell in the gutter and went to sleep. He was mistaken for a dead man by the gravediggers patrolling the city for dead bodies. They picked him up and threw him, along with his bagpipes which they presumed were infected, into a pit filled with bodies of plague victims outside the city walls. Next day when Augustin woke up, he was unable to get out of the deep mass grave. He was shocked and after a while he started to play his bagpipes, because he wanted to die the same way he lived. Finally people heard him and he was rescued from this dreadful place. Luckily he remained healthy despite having slept with the infected dead bodies and Augustin became a symbol of hope for Viennese people. The story, already rendered by the preacher Abraham a Sancta Clara (1644‚Äì1709), lives on in the song, which is still popular in Austria. The tune is nearly identical to that of \\"Did You Ever See a Lassie?\\", although \\"\\" is longer and more melancholic than that song. Text { O du lieber Augustin, Augustin, Augustin, O du lieber Augustin, alles ist hin. Geld ist weg, M√§d'l ist weg, Alles hin, Augustin. O du lieber Augustin, Alles ist hin. Rock ist weg, Stock ist weg, Augustin liegt im Dreck, O du lieber Augustin, Alles ist hin. Und selbst das reiche Wien, Hin ist's wie Augustin; Weint mit mir im gleichen Sinn, Alles ist hin! Jeder Tag war ein Fest, Und was jetzt? Pest, die Pest! Nur ein gro√ü' Leichenfest, Das ist der Rest. Augustin, Augustin, Leg' nur ins Grab dich hin! O du lieber Augustin, Alles ist hin! style=\\"padding- left:2em;\\"O, you dear Augustin, Augustin, Augustin, O, you dear Augustin, all is lost! Money's gone, girlfriend's gone, All is lost, Augustin! O, you dear Augustin, All is lost! Coat is gone, staff is gone, Augustin lies in the dirt. O, you dear Augustin, All is lost! Even that rich town Vienna, Broke is it like Augustin; Shed tears with thoughts akin, All is lost! Every day was a feast, Now we just have the plague! Just a great corpse's feast, That is the rest. Augustin, Augustin, Lie down in your grave! O, you dear Augustin, All is lost! } Use in other musical works During the classical era the song was a popular theme for variations. E.g. the composer Paul Wranitzky featured it in orchestral variations, in variations for xylophone, strings, trumpet and drums, and as the trio to the menuetto of his Symphony Op. 33, No 3. Johann Nepomuk Hummel wrote S 47, WoO 2 ‚Äì Variations for orchestra on \\"O du lieber Augustin\\" in C major. The clarinettist and composer Anton Stadler used it in his first Caprice for solo clarinet. The tune appears quoted (recognisably, but in a dissonant context) in the midst of the second movement of Arnold Schoenberg's second quartet, written a month before the height of Schoenberg's marital crisis. An additional significance attaches to the quotation in view of the quartet being the work in which Schoenberg decisively abandons the traditional key-system and embraces consistent atonality. A Scots song, \\"Did You Ever See a Lassie?\\" is set to the same tune: Did ye ever see a lassie, a lassie, a lassie Did ye ever see a lassie gae this way and that? Gae this way and that way, gae this way and that way, Did ye ever see a lassie gae this way and that?\\" The melody is also the base for: \\"The More We Get Together\\" a traditional American folk song and popular children's song dating to the 18th or 19th century. The melody is also used in \\"Fat Turkeys\\", a children's song sung during the Thanksgiving season in Canada and the United States. Lyrics are: Oh, gobble, gobble, gobble, fat turkeys, fat turkeys; Oh, gobble, gobble, gobble, fat turkeys are we. We walk very proudly and gobble so loudly, Oh, gobble, gobble, gobble, fat turkeys are we. Bing Crosby included the song in a medley on his 1961 album 101 Gang Songs. It appears at the end of the song Spinning Wheel, written by David Clayton-Thomas and performed by Blood, Sweat & Tears. The melody is also used in \\"Daar wordt aan de deur geklopt\\", a Dutch children's song for the celebration of Saint Nicholas Day.

Carman is at the junction of Highways 3 and 13, 40 minutes southwest of Winnipeg. It is surrounded by the Rural Municipality of Dufferin, in the heart of a rich prairie agricultural belt, 60 kilometres north of the American state of North Dakota. Culture The Golden Prairie Arts Council fosters participation in many disciplines. The organization facilitates music lessons with various instruments. GPAC supports local artists by providing a venue for exhibitions. GPAC is in a historic railway station building, where many local arts activities are sponsored. An eclectic variety of performance artists provides a wide cultural experience for the community. The Carman Active Living Centre (ALC) was established in 2002. The organization is dedicated to enhancing the physical, emotional, and social well-being of senior citizens in Carman and surrounding area. ALC is governed by volunteers who form a Board of Directors. As of 2018, the ALC offers shuffleboard, fitness classes, carpet bowling , choir, and pickleball. Members also enjoy different levels of bridge, as well as cards, table tennis, movie nights, and field trips. The ALC also hosts special dinners and entertainment evenings. Carman has several arts events. Every April the Canadian Wall of Fame for exceptional violin talent is held. In February (vocal/choral/speech arts and band/instrumental) and April (piano/strings and dance), Carman hosts the Tempo Festival of the Arts. This includes speech arts, strings, vocal, choral, piano and band classes in association with the Association of Manitoba Music Festivals. One of Manitoba's longest existing choral groups is the Sonatrice Singers. The group has been meeting and performing since 1972. This choir has earned bronze and silver at choralfest Canada as well as Manitoba Provincial honours. Their spring concert takes place in early May every year. In addition to this, the Sontrice Singers sing to support the Carman/area Christmas cheer board, Canadian Cancer Society's Relay for Life, seniors homes, hospitals, schools and other places. Carman has long been recognized as a sports town. Facilities include a modern ice arena and a challenging 18-hole golf course. An active curling club shares clubroom space with golfers.

The beach has been the permanent home of the Another Place sculptures by Antony Gormley since 2007. History The beach was stabilised from the mid 19th century, as prior to this, high sea tides could come in as far as the first row of houses. In the older dunes north of the coastguard station, between the sea and the West Lancashire Golf Club, there are still some remains of the old wartime defenses. The navigable shipping channel in Liverpool Bay, connecting the River Mersey to the Irish Sea, runs parallel to the beach to around the coastguard station where it swings out to sea. The beach was featured in the 2012 BBC drama Good Cop, filmed at and around the beach region. Sefton Council hoped the drama would promote the coastline as a location ideal for filming. Recreation =Another Place= Some of the iron men from the Antony Gormley sculptures The Another Place sculptures by Antony Gormley are found here and, after a Sefton Council meeting on 7 March 2007, it has been allowed to stay permanently. Gormley's reason for choosing Crosby Beach as the location was that he thought of the beach as being \\"the opposite of pretty. It is terrific and brutal and is a working beach\\". The sculptures were painted in June 2017 in what was described as vandalism, although several residents reacted favourably to the graffiti. =Waterloo Marina= View of Waterloo Marina A million pound scheme was proposed to redevelop the nearby Marina as part of a visitor's centre for the beach and Another Place. The new centre was opening in late 2009 under the name of the Crosby Lakeside Adventure Centre, and is also home to the Crosby Scout and Guide Marina Club. Coastal defences Part of the Sea Wall barrier Dune management, including the planting of old Christmas trees and the building of a sea wall, is ongoing and have reduced the problems of high tides. Land erosion was a problem during the early 1900s, with dunes and house gardens being washed away resulting in the demolition of houses up to 1929 and measures to control the erosion introduced during the 1930s. A scheme was undertaken during the late 1960s to reclaim land in association with the Liverpool Docks, which also involved creating a Marina at Waterloo; land was extended from excavated material through the control of the Mersey Tunnel. Throughout 2011-2012, around of sand was moved from Crosby Beach further north towards the village of Hightown, in an effort to bolster coastal defences for the village; the sand dunes are expected to last for 30 years, which also includes a rubble wall at the southern end. In 2012, Asbestos was discovered spread out over a 2-mile stretch of the beach, likely originating from the remains of bombed out buildings during The Blitz, which used the bombed materials to bolster the sea wall but over time eroded and exposed the fibres. Safety The beach has a red flag rating, typically indicating danger and for visitors to not enter the water. There have been numerous incidents over the years of visitors getting trapped in quicksand. Some incidents have been attributed to the iron men sculptures, with visitors venturing beyond the safety point to see the sculptures. Transport Crosby Beach can be reached by foot from Hall Road railway station, Waterloo railway station or Blundellsands and Crosby railway station. The number 53 bus runs through South Road, Waterloo, which stops near Waterloo Station. Many people take the 10-minute walk from here to the end of South Road where the Marina begins and Crosby Beach is located over the sand dunes. There is also car parking at Crosby Swimming Baths. Sport *A parkrun takes place at the beach every Saturday morning at 9am. The course begins on the beach then proceeds along the promenade before returning, the total distance is 5Km.Crosby Parkrun Course *Crosby Leisure Centre is located at the beach and has an indoor swimming pool.

With a target 1,280 miles (2,060 km) from the operation's starting point, this was the most distant publicly known action undertaken by the Israel Defense Forces since Operation \\"Entebbe\\" in 1976. It has been condemned by the United Nations Security Council.  Background  After being driven out of Lebanon in the 1982 Lebanon War, the PLO moved its headquarters to Tunisia. On September 25, 1985, during the Jewish holy day of Yom Kippur, three Palestinian gunmen hijacked an Israeli yacht off the coast of Larnaca, Cyprus, and killed three Israeli tourists on board, one of them a paraplegic who was thrown overboard. In Jerusalem, an anonymous caller told the western agency that the attack was carried out by the PLO's elite Force 17 unit. However, PLO officials denied that. The Israelis were allowed to write down their final thoughts before being shot. The nature of the killings provoked widespread shock in Israel. The PLO claimed that the victims were Mossad agents monitoring Palestinian naval traffic out of Cyprus. The attack was a response for the capture and imprisonment of senior Force 17 commander Faisal Abu Sharah by the Israeli Navy two weeks earlier. Sharah had been sailing on the Opportunity, a small ship that regularly shuttled between Beirut and Larnaca, when it was stopped by an Israeli naval patrol boat with Mossad agents on board. Sharah was arrested, taken to Israel and interrogated. He was then tried and given a heavy prison sentence. Since then, the Israeli Navy and the Mossad had intercepted several other vessels and arrested passengers suspected of terrorist activity.Seale, 1993. p237 The Israeli cabinet and the Israeli Air Force desired immediate retaliation, and chose the Tunis headquarters of the PLO as their target. Intelligence supplied to Israel by Jonathan Pollard on the Tunisian and Libyan air defense systems greatly facilitated the raid. Gordon Thomas claimed in his controversial book Gideon's Spies that many of the subsequent stories in the Arab press warning of Israeli retaliation were planted by , the Mossad's department of psychological warfare. On the eve of the attack, Tunisia expressed concern to the United States that it may be attacked by Israel. However, the United States, according to a high-ranking Tunisian official, assured Tunisia there was no reason to worry.  Operation  The strike was carried out by ten F-15 Eagles, six from 106 \\"Edge of Spear\\" Squadron and four from 133 \\"Knights of the Twin Tail\\" Squadron. Eight of the jets would attack the target with two remaining as backup.https://www.iaf.org.il/5642-46126-en/IAF.aspx The attack was led by Lieutenant Colonel Avner Naveh. At 07:00 on October 1, the aircraft took off from Tel Nof Airbase. A Boeing 707 heavily modified for refueling operations refueled the F-15s in mid-flight over the Mediterranean Sea in order to allow the operation to be executed over such a distance. The Israeli Navy stationed a helicopter-carrying vessel near Malta to recover downed pilots, but these were never needed. The route was designed to avoid detection by Egyptian and Libyan radars, and United States Navy vessels patrolling the Mediterranean. IAF commander Amos Lapidot saw little chance of resistance from the Tunisian Air Force or from Tunisian air defenses, but believed that on such a long flight, technical problems could arise.Black, Ian: Israel's Secret Wars: A History of Israel's Intelligence Services The F-15s flew low over the shore, and fired precision-guided munitions on the PLO headquarters, a cluster of sand-colored buildings along the seaside. The planes attacked the southern location first, so that the northern wind would not pull smoke over the northern targets.http://www.iaf.org.il/46940-33087-en/IAF.aspx The attack lasted for six minutes, after which the F-15s flew back to Israel, refueled again by the Boeing 707. The PLO headquarters were completely destroyed, although Yasser Arafat, the head of the organization, was not there at the time and escaped unharmed. Israel claimed that some 60 PLO members were killed, including several leaders of Force 17, and several of Arafat's bodyguards. In addition, the operation resulted in casualties among civilian bystanders. According to other sources, 56 Palestinians and 15 Tunisians were killed and about 100 wounded.Seale, 1993. p.238 Hospital sources put the final count at 47 dead and 65 wounded.https://www.nytimes.com/1985/10/03/world/tunisia-s-leader-bitter-at- the-us.html Because the attack was conducted so far from Israel, Tunisian sources believed that attack must have been known by the United States, if not actually involving American collaboration.  Aftermath  The attack provoked a strong outcry, even in the United States, Israel's strongest ally. Though initially labeling the strike a \\"legitimate response to terror\\", the Reagan administration later said the attack \\"cannot be condoned\\". The attack also harmed relations between the US administration and the Tunisian president, Habib Bourguiba. Believing the US knew about the attack, and was possibly involved, Tunisia considered breaking diplomatic ties with the US. Egypt suspended negotiations with Israel over the disputed border town of Taba. Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres was quoted as saying \\"It was an act of self-defense. Period.\\" In the United Nations Security Council Resolution 573 (1985), the Security Council voted (with the United States abstaining) to condemn the attack on Tunisian territory as a flagrant violation of the United Nations Charter and considered that Tunisia had the right to appropriate reparations. Within Tunisia, there was public outrage. For a week after the attack, the country's small Jewish community found itself the target of individual acts of antisemitism, such as insults and stone-throwing against Jewish shops. On October 8, 1985, on the island of Djerba, a Tunisian police officer who had lost a brother in the attack fired into a synagogue during Simchat Torah services, killing three people.https://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4614387,00.html  See also  * Operation Entebbe * Operation Opera  References   Sources  * Seale, Patrick.

Rules The amount is calculated using actuarial science to ensure that municipal pension plans are sufficiently funded. The municipality, regardless of the amount contributed by it, is also required to keep the pension plan solvent. If the pension funds become insufficient to meet obligations then the municipality must augment the pension funds using money from other sources. The general funds of the municipality are thus in effect a guarantor and insurance policy against undercontributions by employees or poor performance of pension fund investments. However, the municipality is responsible for making up any shortfall between the MMO and the sum of contributions the municipality makes for each employee as a percentage of that employee's wages, plus realized earnings on the pension fund investments. This may be done on a schedule. The minimum municipal obligation is based on the latest actuarial valuation report prepared under the requirements of Chapter 2 of the act (53 P.

Born in Little Marlow, Buckinghamshire, and educated at Marlborough College, Milton played rugby for England in 1874 and 1875. He emigrated to South Africa, arriving in Cape Town in 1878. By the late 1870s, rugby football was very much battling to survive against Winchester College football. Milton joined Villagers club and preached the cause of rugby, and by the end of that year the football fraternity of Cape Town had all but abandoned the Winchester game in favour of rugby. He made his Test cricket debut in South Africa's first Test of all, at Port Elizabeth in 1888-89. He was made captain for the Second Test at Cape Town, replacing Owen Dunell, and made his third and final appearance (again at Cape Town) in 1891-92. He played three other first-class games: two for Western Province and one for Cape Town Clubs. Milton then moved to Mashonaland and under the influence of his friend Cecil John Rhodes was Mashonaland's third Administrator from 24 July 1897 to 24 January 1901. In 1901 it was decided to combine the administration of Mashonaland and Matabeleland that had been separated three years before, and Milton then became the Administrator of the whole of Southern Rhodesia. He retired in 1914 at the age of 60. In 1922, the biggest school in Bulawayo at the time was renamed Milton High School in his honour. He had three sons, Cecil and John, both of whom would play rugby for England, and Noel, who played for Oxford University. He died in Cannes, France, at the age of 75.

Under a sub concession approved by the Macau government, the project is owned and operated as a 50‚Äì50 joint venture between MGM Resorts International and Pansy Ho, daughter of Macau casino magnate Stanley Ho. The sub-concession is one of several examples of new casino construction following the end of the government-granted monopoly held for decades by Stanley Ho.  History  The MGM Grand Macau was opened on 18 December 2007 at a cost of US$1.25 billion. The property was renamed to MGM Macau, as part of MGM Mirage's 2010 rebranding to MGM Resorts International. On 18 April 2011, an initial public offering was announced. Under the agreement, Pansy Ho would receive a 29 percent stake in the company, MGM China Holdings Ltd, which was created as a listing vehicle for the IPO. MGM Resorts would hold 51 percent and the public would receive 20 percent. The company raised US$1.5 billion from its IPO on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange at the top price of the range.  Layout  Phase One of the casino floor accounts for square metres over two levels and wrapping around the Grande Pra√ßa; with table games and slot machines. The property includes a convention space of , including The Grand Ballroom of 807 square metre for business meetings, social events and weddings; and partner with Six Senses Spa to have a space of 2,720 square metre that includes 12 treatment areas. MGM Macau also features a number of restaurant outlets, bars, and lounges. There are 12 food and beverage outlets in total. Soon after Wynn Macau expansion plans became public, the MGM Macau announced its own plans for expansion, only weeks after the project was publicly launched. The expansion will add to the casino floor's 2nd level. The additional space allows 70 more game tables and 240 slot machines added.

Located in the basement of the Clermont Motor Hotel at 789 Ponce De Leon Avenue, in the Poncey-Highland neighborhood, the Clermont has survived multiple attempts at being closed by the Atlanta city government, and has established a nationwide reputation for its kitschy atmosphere and unusual dancers. The Clermont has been featured on an episode of Insomniac with Dave Attell, and celebrities including Anthony Bourdain, Marilyn Manson, Ashton Kutcher, Kid Rock, Steven Yeun, Skinny Lister, Lady Gaga, Eric Roberts, Ming Chen, Jason Zimmerman and the Guys Weekend as well as David Cross and Bombay Bicycle Club have been known to visit the Clermont when in Atlanta. Visitors to the Clermont usually alternate between a few handfuls of regulars and large numbers of college students, newcomers to town, and tourists lured in by tales of the Clermont's myriad charms. The Clermont does not serve food or draft beer. The single stripper's stage is located in the middle of a circular bar, and the dancers choose (and pay for) their own songs on the in-house jukebox, as the club normally does not have an actual DJ. The Clermont is perhaps best known for featuring some dancers who do not meet the traditional physical standards for strippers, the most famous of whom is Blondie, noted for her ability to crush empty beer cans between her breasts as well as for her poetry. History Hotel Clermont in 2020 The Clermont Motor Hotel was built in 1924 and was originally an apartment building after its construction, but was later renovated to a hotel format. An early advertisement for a nightclub in the basement space is dated 1947 and the club was the \\"Anchorage Club\\". Later tenants included the \\"Gypsy Club\\" (c. 1951-1954), and \\"The Continental Room\\" (1954) before returning to the Anchorage name from about 1956 until 1963, when it was briefly known as the \\"Atlanta Playboy Club\\", an unofficial attempt to capitalize on the popularity of Hugh Hefner's magazine. A lawsuit closed the Atlanta Playboy Club. By 1965, the \\"Jungle Club\\" opened its doors within the Clermont Hotel. In 1968, the \\"Clermont Lounge\\" opened for business and has remained in place ever since. The entire building was sold to new owners in 2003. In December 2009, the health department ordered the hotel to close for numerous health-code violations, including dirty linen, old bedding, bed bug stains, mold growing on the walls, black water spilling from faucets, and broken toilet fixtures. Fairway Capital put the property on the market for sale in 2010. Clermont Hotel Partners LLC eventually bought it in January 2013 with the intent to redevelop the property as a boutique hotel. In 2018, the hotel reopened after an extensive renovation that brought the facility up to code while restoring and preserving the iconic details of the Clermont In popular culture Just a few months before his death of a heroin overdose, shock rocker GG Allin wrote the song \\"Hotel Clermont (My Whorehouse)\\", released as the B-side to his 1993 single \\"Look Into My Eyes and Hate Me\\", during a period spent living in Room 216 of the adjacent hotel. Bubba Sparxx released the track 'Claremont Lounge', which uses a different spelling but was likely in reference to the Clermont.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTZc00VL_gY See also * Magic City (club) *Hotels in Atlanta References External links *Official site *A couple of dozen vintage ads for burlesque clubs that operated in the Clermont Hotel over the last several decades *\\"Because Blondie, the Clermont Lounge stripper-cum-local celebrity with a heart and hair of gold, can crush a beer can with her boobs\\", Creative Loafing, November 23, 2011 *\\"We're All Freaks: My Three Years at the Clermont Lounge\\", Bitter Southerner, October 1, 2013 *Images and info from About.com Category:Strip clubs in the United States Category:Nightclubs in the United States Category:Culture of Atlanta ","title":"Clermont Lounge"},{"id":"2446836","text":"Jacques Sadoul (1934 ‚Äì 18 January 2013)Mort de l'√©diteur Jacques Sadoul was a French novelist, book editor and non-fiction author. His Histoire de la science fiction moderne (1973) was a major encouragement for the serious, academic study of SF, particularly among the East European peoples of that time, because the book was seen as very respectable, and, it was European, continental, while almost everything else science-fictional was produced across the Lamanche and across the Atlantic. Sadoul was a well-known SF fan and magazine collector. In Paris, in 1973, he published an album of illustrations from American SF magazines, Hier, l‚Äôan 2000. He was one of the first editors to launch SF successfully in paperback form in France. He was born at Agen, and worked first with ‚ÄúEditions Opta‚Äù and then with ‚ÄúJ‚Äôai lu‚Äù, where he founded the SF imprint and edited the Les Meilleurs Recits series of anthologies of stories translated from the American pulp magazines. He was also a founder of the Prix Apollo award. Hier, l‚Äôan 2000: L‚Äôillustration de science fiction des annees 30 (1973; translated into English and published in the U.S. in 1975 as: 2000 A.D.: Illustrations From the Golden Age of Science Fiction Pulps), is a book of SF illustrations which he gathered, mostly black- and-white, a selection of SF nostalgia material, but has no index. His Histoire de la science-fiction moderne, 1911-1971 [‚ÄúHistory of Modern SF‚Äù] (1973; in 2 volumes 1975; revised 1984) is a lengthy and enthusiastic survey of the field, but has been criticized for lacking deep critical analysis and containing too many sweeping generalizations and personal prejudices. Sadoul was a prolific novelist. His work includes crime-fiction/spy-fiction novels such as the \\"Carol Evans cycle\\" (consisting of ten novels), fantasy novels (such as the trilogy La Passion selon Satan [‚ÄúThe Passion according to Satan‚Äù] (1960), Le Jardin de la licorne [‚ÄúThe Garden of the Unicorn‚Äù] (1978), and Les hautes terres du r√™ve) and science fiction novels. In 1987, he received the Grand Prix de Litt√©rature Polici√®re for Trois morts au soleil. Sadoul has authored works on alchemy, the fantastique and crime fiction. In 2006 he published his memoirs C‚Äôest dans la poche !.

It is a strong knot used to tie two different diameters of line together, for instance to tie monofilament to braid. The Albright is relatively smooth and passes through guides when required. Some anglers coat the knot with a rubber based cement to make it even smoother and more secure. As this is an angling bend, it is appropriate for use in fishing line such as monofilament, which is finer, more rigid, and more slippery than 'conventional' cords (e.g. braided rope or paracord). Regular knots tied in such cord tend to behave unreliably; hence, one must take additional care when tying many fishing and surgical knots to prevent them from unraveling and spilling. For the Albright special, it is important to wind the turns neatly around the loop of larger line and dress the knot so that each turn sits tight. For a more general-purpose bend to join more conventional lines of different diameters, see sheet bend (which, again, can be made more secure by adding turns).

After a few experiences in the US, he started working on Italian TV in the 1950s and was considered to be the most popular host in Italy. He was also known by the nickname il Re del Quiz (The Quiz King), and the peculiarity of starting all his shows with his trademark greeting: Allegria! (\\"Cheers!\\", \\"Joy!\\"). Early years Bongiorno was born in New York City, but moved to Turin (his mother's native city), when he was young. His father was a Sicilian-American lawyer of partial Arb√´resh√´ origin. During World War II Mike abandoned his studies and joined a group of Italian partisans. He was captured and spent seven months in the San Vittore prison in Milan and was then deported to a German concentration camp. He was liberated before the end of the war due to an exchange of war prisoners between the United States and Germany. He returned to New York and in 1946 started work at the radio headquarters of Il Progresso Italo-Americano (The Italian-American Progress) newspaper. Career Bongiorno returned to Italy in 1953. He appeared on the first day of official public TV transmissions in Italy with Arrivi e partenze (Arrivals and Departures) on the TV channel RAI . From 1955 to 1959 he hosted the quiz show Lascia o raddoppia?, the Italian version of USA's The $64,000 Question. Another program was Campanile Sera (Bell Tower Evening, 1959‚Äì1962), in which southern and northern Italian towns challenged each other with questions, and practical games played by citizens in the same towns. In 1963 Umberto Eco wrote an essay entitled Phenomenology of Mike Bongiorno, a bestseller in which he used advanced academic theories to shed light on Mike Bongiorno and his way of communicating. Eco held that Mike Bongiorno was so good at portraying himself as no better than average in every respect, that 100% of his audience could feel good about themselves. Beginning in 1963, he hosted the first of eleven editions of the Sanremo Festival. Then he hosted the quiz programs Caccia al numero (Number Hunting, 1962), La Fiera dei Sogni (Dream Fair, 1962‚Äì1965) and Giochi in Famiglia (Games in Family, 1966‚Äì1969). But the greatest success came with the quiz program Rischiatutto (1970‚Äì1974), an adapted Italian version of Jeopardy!, with 20 to 30 million watchers every Thursday night, the highest audience in the history of Italian TV. Other programs hosted by Bongiorno were the news talk show Ieri e Oggi (Yesterday and Today, 1976) and the quiz programs Scommettiamo? (Wanna Bet?, 1976‚Äì1978), inspired by horse-racing, and a remake of Lascia o raddoppia? in 1979. Mike Bongiorno with Pippo Baudo, Corrado Mantoni and Enzo Tortora. He moved to Tele Milano (now Canale 5), one of the first Italian commercial TV channels owned by Mediaset, the media company founded by Silvio Berlusconi, to host I sogni nel cassetto (The dreams, literally \\"The dreams in the drawer\\", 1979‚Äì1980). After a brief return to RAI with the news-game Flash (1980‚Äì1982), he continued working for Mediaset quiz programmes Bis (Concentation) (1981‚Äì1990), Superflash (1982‚Äì1985), Pentathlon (1985‚Äì1987), Telemike (1987‚Äì1992), Tris (1990‚Äì1991), the math game Tutti per uno (Family Feud, 1992) and from 1989 to 2003 La ruota della fortuna (Wheel of Fortune). From 1991 to 2001 he hosted Bravo, Bravissimo, a festival featuring preteen musicians, dancers and singers from all over the world. He won 24 Telegatto, the Italian TV prize. Until 2005 he hosted Genius on Rete 4, an afternoon quiz show aimed at 12- to 14-year- olds. In 2006 and 2007 he hosted his last quiz show Il Migliore (Britain's Brainiest Kid) on Rete 4. More recently, he was also a guest on the second episode of the Gianfranco Funari's show Apocalypse Show on Rai 1. On December 13, 2007, Mike Bongiorno was awarded an honorary degree Honoris Causa by IULM University of Milan. On 26 March 2009 Bongiorno signed for SKY Italia after Mediaset decided not to renew his contract, where he planned to host a new game show on SKY Uno called RiSKYtutto (a modern edition of his popular show Rischiatutto), which had been scheduled to air in the autumn of 2009.  Death  On September 8, 2009, at the age of 85, Mike Bongiorno died of a heart attack, while leaving the Hotel Metropole, Monte-Carlo after a short holiday with his wife Daniela Zuccoli. His body lay in repose for a few days at the Triennale in Milan before a state funeral was held in the Milan Cathedral on September 12, 2009. Many Italian TV stars such as Rosario Fiorello, Pippo Baudo, Fabio Fazio, Sandra Mondaini, Alba Parietti, Paola Barale, Carlo Conti, Gerry Scotti, Marco Columbro and several other entertainers attended the service which was held by Bishop Erminio De Scalzi. Bongiorno was buried in the family tomb, at Dagnente Cemetery, near Arona in Piedmont. On January 25, 2011, the tomb was ransacked and his body, along with the coffin, was stolen. On Thursday, December 8, 2011, Mike Bongiorno's body was recovered from a field near Milan. Honours and awards =Honours= In 1996 he was made a Commander of the Order of Saints Maurice and Lazarus by Vittorio Emanuele, Prince of Naples, the last Crown Prince of the former Kingdom of Italy, and Head of the House of Savoy.

The population at the 2011 census was 11,701. History Perhaps the most historic fact about Walker is contained in its name, which refers to Hadrian's Wall which passed along its northern edge. The place-name 'Walker' is first attested in 1242, where it appears as Waucre. This means 'wall-carr', that is to say, 'the marsh by the Roman wall'.Eilert Ekwall, The Concise Oxford Dictionary of English Place-names, p.492. Hadrian's Wall is not visible in Walker today, although a small fragment can be seen in Shields Road in Byker to the west, and Segedunum fort is a major site at the end of the Wall in Wallsend to the east. Large-scale coal-mining began in the area in the early 1700s, with up to ten collieries in operation in the Walker area. A wagon-way was constructed during this period to facilitate transportation of coal to the riverside staithes.Newcastle Council: website for Walkergate ward Walker used to have a large shipbuilding industry, particularly the yard of Armstrong Whitworth at High Walker, but this has declined over the past 50 years and the area has suffered as a result, with many jobs being taken away from the community. From 1809 to 1883, Walker was home to an iron-making company, Losh, Wilson and Bell (known towards the end as Bells, Goodman and finally as Bells, Lightfoot). History of Walkerville Walkerville was developed as a model housing exhibition along the lines of the Garden city movement held under the auspices of the National Housing Reform Council in 1908 and is an early example of small-scale town planning prior to the Housing, Town Planning, &c.; Act 1909. One of the prime campaigners behind the exhibition was Councillor David Adams (1871-1943), who later became an MP and Lord Mayor of Newcastle. The chosen site was Corporation estate, Walker, and the Gold medal for the horseshoe layout of the site was awarded to Watson and Scott of Newcastle. The exhibition was of a range of 'model cottages' for working people of different types from two to three bedrooms, by different architects and backed by a range of patrons including Wallsend Cooperative Society, at that time a provider of mortgage capital for its members. Newcastle Corporation also built homes as part of the exhibition. The Gold medal winning architects were AT Martindale, White & Stephenson, Edward Cratney and TE Davidson. David Adams described the planning and development of the Walker and Willington estates in a series of articles for the Northern Echo. Description Generally speaking Walker is an area between Welbeck Road and the banks of the River Tyne, although the modern city ward of Walker incorporates Pottery Bank and St Anthony's. When most Geordies refer to Walker they also incorporate the areas of Daisy Hill and Eastfield. Walkergate, located between Welbeck Road and the Network rail line are sometimes considered parts of Walker. Other parts of Walker are Walkerdene (which is situated south of 'Fossway' and north of 'Welbeck Road', west of 'Waverdale Avenue' and east of 'Scrogg Road') and Walkerville (which is located under the railway bridge and to the right, these houses are mainly private stock where as other areas of Walker are council and ex-council stock). Other areas included are Daisy Hill and Eastfield which help make up the city Ward of Walkergate. The area is notable for Walker Park, the Walker Riverside Park,http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/walker-riverside- park-closed-over-1402109 and the Lady Stephenson Library (now known as 'Walker Library') as well as the Lightfoot Sports Centre, which is set to undergo a ¬£2.5m refurbishment. Alderman Sir William Haswell Stephenson, built the library in 1908 in memory of his wife Eliza, who died in 1901. The library closed on 29 June 2013 and contents have been relocated into a purpose built area within Walker Activity Dome in July 2013 (The Lightfoot Sports Centre).Newcastle Council: Walker Activity Dome and Library Walker Park received a Green Flag Award in 2019.https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/here-regions-parks- received-green-16588718 Walker is served by the Tyne and Wear Metro, with a station at Walkergate, and has a main bus terminus on Walker Road, although this is quite dilapidated and badly serviced. Most children attend a local primary school, These are St Anthony's CE, St Vincent's RC, Tyneview, Welbeck Academy, West Walker, Walkergate and Wharrier Street. The two main Secondary Schools which service the area are Benfield School, a specialist Sports College, and Walker Riverside Academy, a high performing specialist technology and visual arts school for 11- to 18-year-olds. Future Newcastle City Council's Walker Riverside regeneration scheme launched in 2003 aims to revitalise the area with new houses, schools, jobs and community facilities, environmental improvements, and a new neighbourhood centre to be known as the Heart of Walker. The scheme has its own newsletter known as the \\"Walker Eye\\", which goes to almost 7,000 homes and businesses locally. Much of the older and run-down housing stock along Walker Road is in the process of being demolished and replaced with new homes which are a mixture of council and private housing. The stated aim was to build 1,600 new and replacement homes over a 15-year period. As part of the new Heart of Walker development, plans have recently been unveiled to open a new state-of-the-art primary school on a site next door to the redeveloped Lightfoot Centre, where the old Wharrier Street Primary School was. The ¬£7.5m project merged Wharrier Street and St Anthony's Primary Schools in Autumn 2012 to create the new Central Walker Church of England Primary. Plans for the area's regeneration were approved by the then Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, Ruth Kelly. In August 2018 it was announced that two high-rise blocks, Titan House and Hexham House were to be demolished. The flats and neighbouring Church Walk shopping centre will be replaced by a new housing development and shops.https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/two-high-rise- blocks-flats-15030120 Notable people Cheryl Cole, singer, born on 30 June 1983,Now Magazine: Cheryl Cole lived in Walker and Heaton, attending Walker Comprehensive School, Middle Street,London Evening Standard: Cheryl Cole tells of School Days before she found fame with Girls Aloud.Times Online: Women Walker is the birthplace of Eric Burdon, lead singer of The Animals, who later recorded with War at the beginning of that band's career.

Cabinda  Formerly Portuguese Congo, this territory had protectorate status since 1883 and was separate from Portuguese West Africa. As part of various independence movements in the 1960s a group called Front for the Liberation of the Enclave of Cabinda (FLEC) established a government- in-exile in Kinshasa. FLEC made a unilateral declaration of independence on 1 August 1975 but it was not recognised by Portugal or internationally. In November 1975, Angolan troops of the MPLA occupied Cabinda which was annexed into the newly independent Angolan state. Angola calls the territory Cabinda Province. Since then, FLEC and other factions within Cabinda have struggled for full independence and seek to form the Republic of Cabinda. Various organizations have issued stamps for Cabinda (widely regarded as cinderellas). These include: *The Cabinda National Philatelic Bureau, which issued a set of eleven overprints on Angolan stamps, all with a denomination of 500 Central African francs, with designs showing fauna and mushrooms on 27 October 2006.

Eugenius Birch (20 June 1818 ‚Äì 8 January 1884) was a 19th-century English seaside architect, civil engineer and noted builder of promenade-piers. Biography Both Eugenius and his elder brother, John Brannis (born 1813), were born in Gloucester Terrace (later Pitfield Street), Shoreditch, London to architect and surveyor John and his wife, Susanne. He attended schools in Brighton and at Euston Square. Fascinated by engineering from a young age, he would often visit major engineering works being built in north London (such as the Primrose Hill tunnel). While still a boy he submitted a design for a passenger carriage to the London and Greenwich Railway company. His innovation, to place the wheels beneath the carriage as opposed to the side, thus freeing more room for the passengers was adopted by the railway. =Career= As a result, aged 16 he joined Messrs. Bligh‚Äôs engineering works in Limehouse, London as an apprentice, and then studied at the Mechanics' Institute at the request of Dr George Birkbeck. In 1837, aged 19, he received a silver Isis Medal from the Society of Arts for his drawing of a marine steam engine, and the following year a Silver Telford Medal for his drawings and description of Huddert‚Äôs rope machinery. On 19 February 1839, Birch was elected a Graduate of the Institution of Civil Engineers, becoming a Member on 5 May 1863. In 1845 he formed a general design engineering partnership with his brother, John Brannis Birch, which worked across various projects including railways (such as the East Indian Railway from Calcutta to Delhi), viaducts and bridges (including the Kelham and Stockwith bridges). He also designed the Devon and Somerset Railway, Exmouth docks, Ilfracombe harbour, and West Surrey waterworks. =Piers= On his return to England from India, Birch brought his global experiences to bear on the developing English fascination with seaside holidays, specifically the construction of piers. With the railways now allowing easy and cheap access to the seaside, and the known health benefits of clean air, businessmen in coastal towns were competing against each other to create the longest and most ornate piers to attract the greatest number of tourists. In 1853, a group of Margate businessmen approach Birch to build the first screw-pile pier in Britain. In its design and construction, he brought two innovations: firstly, stylistic innovations directly influenced by his travels, and secondly, the adoption of screw blade added to iron piles making for a deeper and far more resilient base support. The result was a stylish and resilient Margate Pier, which survived storms and two world wars until it was destroyed by a storm in January 1978. The pier's foundations survive to this day, despite direct attempts at demolition. The Margate pier led to a series of new commissions, which eventually ran to 14 piers in total, the most famous of which is the West Pier, Brighton. His effect on pier construction techniques can be measured in the fact that, from 1862 to 1872, 18 new pleasure piers were built, the majority using screw piling. His last pier was at Plymouth, opened in the year he died, 1884. In the BBC comedy radio series It Sticks Out Half a Mile (a spinoff of Dad's Army), Birch is given as the builder of \\"Frambourne\\" pier. =Later life= Later in his life, particularly during his travels, Birch produced numerous watercolour paintings, particularly those of Italy, Egypt and Nubia during a tour taken during the winter of 1874‚Äì75.

It opened in 2002 and can hold up to 16,000 people (13,800 or 12,947 for sporting events). It is located at Altona Volkspark, adjacent to the football stadium Volksparkstadion and the Volksbank Arena in Hamburg's western Bahrenfeld district. The arena is primarily used for pop/rock concerts and was the home of handball club HSV Hamburg and ice hockey team Hamburg Freezers until both teams folded in 2016. The Barclaycard Arena is among the most modern venues in Europe.  History  Interior view during warm-up before a Hamburg Freezers game in 2008. The arena opened in November 2002, is 150 meters long and 110 metres wide and has an elevation of 33 metres. Construction costs totaled approximately 83 million Euro (ca. US$121.5mn). The construction of the stadium was funded by the Finnish entrepreneur Harry Harkimo and the city of Hamburg, who sold Harkimo the land for a symbolic price of one Mark and also financed infrastructure improvements with 12 million Marks (about 6.1 million euros) as a preparatory measure. In October 2007 the arena was sold to Anschutz Entertainment Group for an estimated 75 million Euros.  Naming rights  Logo of the arena during O2 sponsoring The arena was initially named after Norwegian ferry operator Color Line as the \\"Color Line Arena\\". In 2010 the sponsor changed to Spanish telecommunications company Telef√≥nica, naming the arena as \\"O2 World Hamburg\\".

Discovery The Stupa Nb.2 at Bimaran, where the reliquary was excavated. Drawing by Charles Masson. When it was found by the archaeologist Charles Masson during his work in Afghanistan between 1833 and 1838, the casket contained coins of the Indo-Scythian king Azes II, though recent research by Senior indicates Azes II never existedSenior (2008), pp. 25-27. and finds attributed to his reign probably should be reassigned to Azes I. The most recent research however (2015) attributes the coins to Indo- Scythian king Kharahostes or his son Mujatria, who minted posthumous issues in the name of Azes. The Bimaran reliquary is sometimes dated, based on coinage analysis, to 0-15 CE (Fussman), more generally to 50-60 CE (British Museum), and sometimes much later (2nd century CE), based on artistic assumptions only. It is currently in the collections of the British Museum.British Museum Highlights The datation of this unique piece of art has a strong bearing on the chronology of Buddhist art and the creation of the Buddha image, as its advanced iconography implies that earlier forms had probably been existing for quite some time before. Description Detail of the Buddha, where the rare posture and light dress are visible. The casket is a small container reminiscent of the Pyxis of the Classical world.\\"The crossroads of Asia\\", edited by Ellizabeth Errington and Joe Cribb, The ancient India and Iran Trust, 1992, , p.189-190 It was found without its lid. There is a lotus decorating the bottom. The casket features hellenistic representations of the Buddha (contrapposto pose, Greek himation, bundled hairstyle, wearing a moustache, realistic execution), surrounded by the Indian deities Brahma and ≈öakra, inside arched niches (called \\"homme arcade\\", or caitya) of Greco-Roman architecture. There are altogether eight figures in high-relief (two identical groups of Brahman-Buddha-Indra, and two devotees or Bodhisattvas in-between) and two rows of rubies from Badakhshan. Owing to their necklace, bracelets, and armbands, and halo, the two devotees are most probably representations of Bodhisattvas. They hold their hands together in a prayerful gesture of reverence, A√±jali MudrƒÅ. The casket is made in gold-repouss√© and is very small, with a height of . It is considered as a masterpiece of the Greco- Buddhist art of Gandhara. =The Buddha: a rare iconography= The Buddha seems to walk sideways. His right forearm goes across his chest to form the Abhaya mudra. His left fist is clenched on his hip. The gown of the Shakyamuni Buddha is quite light compared to that of the other known representations of the standing Buddha (see Standing Buddha (Tokyo National Museum)), tending to follow the outline of the body, in a rather light way. These are probably the first two layers of monastic clothing the antaravasaka and the uttarasanga, without the heavier overcoat, the sangati, which would only go as low as the knees and be more markedly folded. Also, his gown is folded over the right and left arm (rather than being held in the left hand as in the classical Buddha image), suggesting some kind of scarf-like uttariya. He has an abundant topknot covering the ushnisha, and a simple halo surrounds his head. This combination of details of the iconography (posture and clothing) is rare and only otherwise known in the coins of Kanishka (c. 150 CE), where they bear the inscription \\"Shakyamuni Buddha\\", in apparent contrast to his coins of the \\"Buddha\\" where he wears the heavy topcoat. The posture itself is well known in the art of Gandhara in sculptures of the Buddha as a Bodhisattva, but in these cases, he wears the Indian princely dhoti and the royal turban. The Bimaran casket, illustrated by Charles Masson: view in volume, flattened view of a half portion of the casket, and bottom. Steatite container The steatite box that contained the Bimaran casket. Inscriptions on the steatite box. The Bimaran casket was kept in a steatite box, with inscriptions stating that it contained some relics of the Buddha. When opened in the 19th century, the box did not contain identifiable relics, but instead some burnt pearls, bead of precious and semi-precious stones, and the four coins of Azes II. The inscriptions written on the box are : :Main body of the container: :\\"Shivaraksita mumjavamdaputrasa danamuhe niyadide bhagavata sharirehi sarvabudhana puyae\\" :\\"Sacred gift of Shivaraksita, son of Munjavamda; presented for Lord's relics, in honour of all Buddhas\\" (Translation by Fussman) :Lid of the container: :\\"Shivaraksita mumjavamdaputrasa danamuhe bhagavata sharirehi\\" :\\"Gift of Shivaraksita, son of Munjavamda; presented for Lord's relics\\" Date of the coins =Azes II= The coins of Azes II found inside the Bimaran reliquary.

The archeological find of the Azes II coins inside the casket would suggest a date between 30 BCE to 10 BCE. Azes II would have employed some Indo-Greek artists in the territories recently conquered, and made the dedication to a stupa. The coins are not very worn, and would therefore have been dedicated soon after their minting. Indo- Scythians are indeed known for their association with Buddhism, as in the Mathura lion capital. Such date would make the casket the earliest known representation of the Buddha: :\\"In the art of Gandhara, the first known image of the standing Buddha and approximatively dated, is that of the Bimaran reliquary, which specialists attribute to the Indo-Scythian period, more particularly to the rule of Azes II\\" (Christine Sachs, \\"De l'Indus √† l'Oxus\\"). However, several features of the coins are unknown for coins of Azes: the Tyche on the reverse, the fact that the king is given the title of Dhramika in the Kharoshthi inscription on the reverse, and the fact that the Kharoshthi monograms and symbols used are those of the later Scythian king Kharahostes. =Kharahostes= Coin of Kharahostes, in the name of Azes.

Kharoshthi legend Maharajasa mahatasa Dhramakisa Rajatirajasa Ayasa \\"The Great king followower of the Dharma, King of Kings Azes\\" The latest studies, made in 2015 by Joe Cribb, consider that the coins are issues of Kharahostes, or his son Mujatria.DATING AND LOCATING MUJATRIA AND THE TWO KHARAHOSTES by Joe Cribb, 2015, p.27 et sig Many characteristics of the coins of the Bimaran reliquary are consistent with the coinage of Kharahostes (10 BCE-10 CE), a successor to Azes II, who minted many coins in the name of Azes II. The four coins in the Bimaran casket are of the same type: tetradrachms of debased silver in the name of Azes, in near-new condition.The Crossroads of Asia, Elizabeth Errington, Ancient India and Iran Trust, Fitzwilliam Museum, Ancient India and Iran Trust, 1992, p.188 On the obverse they show a king on a horse to the right with right hand extended, with a three-pellet dynastic mark and a circular legend in Greek. The legend reads in corrupted Greek WEIŒõON WEOŒõŒõWN IOCAAC (that is, ŒíŒëŒ£ŒôŒõŒïŒ©Œ£ ŒíŒëŒ£ŒôŒõŒïŒ©Œù ŒëŒñŒüŒ•) \\"King of Kings Azes\\". On the reverse appears a figure of Tyche standing and holding a cornucopia, with a Kharoshthi legend. The legend reads 'Maharajasa mahatasa Dhramakisa Rajatirajasa Ayasa \\"The Great king followower of the Dharma, King of Kings Azes\\". Close-up photographs by the British Museum show that the coins do bear the name of Azes, but that they also have the \\"Three pellets\\" symbol, which is characteristic of the coinage of Kharahostes, who also often uses the name of Azes on his coinage.Grifterrec on Indo-Scythians The coin type of the Bimaran coins is also identical to the main coins of Kharahostes (horseman with Tyche). The name of Kharahostes has also been recently discovered on a silver Buddhist reliquary, found in Shinkot in Bajaur (Pakistan). This suggests that Kharahostes was keen on making Buddhist dedications similar to those of the Bimaran reliquary.Richard Salomon, \\"An Inscribed Silver Buddhist Reliquary of the Time of King Kharaosta and Prince Indravarman\\", Journal of the American Oriental Society, Vol. 116, No. 3 (July - September 1996), pp. 418-452 Without adding any redeposition theory, the Bimaran reliquary may therefore have been dedicated during the reign of Kharahostes (10 BCE ‚Äì 10 CE), and probably at the beginning of his reign since the coins are not worn and where therefore basically new when they were introduced in the casket. This would put the Bimaran casket at 10 BCE, or around the beginning of our era. =Kujula Kadphises= The rare coins of Kujula Kadphises with a tripartite mark resembling the three-pellet mark of Kharahostes (here on the reverse), have coin types (\\"Laureate head and king seated\\") which are totally different from those of the Bimaran reliquary. And this is the only issue of Kujula where this symbol appearsGrifterrec Coins The Kushan ruler Kudjula Kadphises does use something similar to the three-pellets mark of Kharahostes in just one of his coin types (the \\"Laureate head and king seated\\" type), which has led to suggestions that the coins of the Bimaran casket may be from his reign, and can be dated to approximately 60 CE.The Crossroads of Asia, Elizabeth Errington, Ancient India and Iran Trust, Fitzwilliam Museum, Ancient India and Iran Trust, 1992, p.16 This coin type however has nothing to do with that of the coins of the Bimaran reliquary (which are all \\"Horseman with Tyche\\"). Kudjula Kadphises is also not known to have issued Scythian-type coins in the name of Azes. The three-pellet symbol mark is not known from any other ruler either (apart from the son of Kharahostes Mujatria), so that the only remaining possibility seems to be Kharahostes or his son, as determined by Joe Cribb in his 2015 study.DATING AND LOCATING MUJATRIA AND THE TWO KHARAHOSTES by Joe Cribb, 2015, p.27-35 Date of the Bimaran reliquary Various disputes have been arising regarding the early date suggested for this first Buddha image. Fussman thinks that the Bimaran reliquary was manufactured in 1-15 CE.Fussman, 1986, p.71, quoted in The Crossroads of Asia, p.192 In any case manufacture necessarily took place before 60 CE, which is the latest date considered for the coins.The Crossroads of Asia, p.192 The Bimaran casket is on display at the British Museum (Joseph E. Hotung Gallery), which dates the casket to 60 CE. Some also date the casket as late as the 2nd century CE based on stylistic assumptions.(S. L. Huntington, Art Journal, Vol. 49 No. 4 Winter.1990, pp.401-408) Susan Huntington sums up the issue: :\\"The well-known gold and ruby reliquary found at Bimaran in Afghanistan is generally assigned a date of about the second century AD in spite of the virtually incontrovertible scientific evidence surrounding it that suggests that it was made about the first century BC. The resistance to the early dating of the reliquary is based solely on the assumption that Buddha images were not introduced into the Buddhist artistic repertoire until the early centuries of the Christian era, and therefore that any work that bears an image of the Buddha must be of a comparably late date.\\" (S. L. Huntington, Art Journal, Vol. 49 No. 4 Winter.1990, pp.401-408) These disputes stem from the fact that the first representations of the Buddha are generally assumed to be around the 1st century CE or later, about fifty to a hundred years later than the reign of Azes II, under the rule of the Kushans. Since the Bimaran casket, with its already advanced Buddhist iconography, was manufactured at the beginning of our era, give or take a few decades, it is highly probably that much earlier images of the Buddha had already been in existence before its creation, going back to the 1st century BCE. Implications Early Buddhist imagery includes coins of Indo-Greek kings such as Menander II (left, circa 90‚Äì85 BCE), in which Zeus, through Nike, hands a wreath of victory to a Wheel of the Law, or the Tillya Tepe Buddhist coin (right, 1st c.BCE-1st c.CE). Since the casket already displays quite a sophisticated iconography (Brahma and Indra as attendants, Bodhisattvas) in an advanced style, it would suggest much earlier representations of the Buddha had been current by the time of the deposition of the Bimaran casket (10 BCE -10 CE), going back to the rule of the Indo- Greeks in the 1st century BCE. The last Indo-Greek kings Strato II and Strato III ruled until around 20 CE. This view, that Greco-Buddhist art already was flourishing in the 1st century BCE under the sponsorship of Indo-Greek kings, was originally advocated by Alfred A. Foucher and others, although with much less archaeological evidence. Stylistically, the casket (gold inlaid with precious stone) is also highly consistent with the art of the Scythians, as known for example from the Tillya tepe archaeological site in northern Afghanistan. The Tillya tepe treasure is also dated to the 1st century BCE, and also has what could be early representations of the Buddha, such as the Tillya Tepe Buddhist coin. The Bimaran casket also has some similarities with the Kanishka casket, which however is of much coarser execution, and securely dated to around 127 CE.

Afterwards, construction began in the middle of the town on a Gothic cathedral, called the Fridolinsm√ºnster, which can still be visited today. In the closing stages of the 1672-1678 Franco-Dutch War, the town was severely damaged by French soldiers commanded by the Comte de Choiseul, following their victory over an Imperial force at Rheinfelden on 7 July 1678.

K. Mitra, \\"The Upper Atmosphere\\", Calcutta, Royal Asiatic Society of Bengal, 1947. Early life and education Mitra was born in his father's hometown of Konnagar, a suburb of Kolkata (then Calcutta) located in the Hooghly District in the Bengal Presidency (present-day West Bengal). He was the third son of Joykrishna Mitra, who was a schoolteacher at the time of Mitra's birth, and Saratkumari, a medical student whose family came from Midnapore. While Mitra's paternal family were orthodox Hindus, his mother's family were adherents of the progressive Brahmo Samaj, and were noted in Midnapore for their advanced outlook. In 1878, Joykrishna Mitra had joined the Brahmo Samaj and married his wife, against the wishes of his family, who responded by severing ties with him. As a consequence, the newly wed couple moved to Saratkumari's hometown of Midnapore, where Joykrishna and his wife had two sons - Satish Kumar and Santosh Kumar - and a daughter before Joykrishna moved his family to Kolkata in 1889; there, he became a schoolteacher. Mitra was born the following year. While in Kolkata, Joykrishna became acquainted with several distinguished scholars, notably Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar and Bipin Chandra Pal. Sharing Saratkumari's progressive outlook, Joykrishna secured his wife's admission as a student at Campbell Medical College. In 1892, Saratkumari qualified as a physician and received an appointment at the Lady Dufferin Hospital in the city of Bhagalpur, then in the Bengal Presidency (now in Bihar). The family thus moved to Bhagalpur, where Saratkumari began her new career, with Joykrishna securing a position as a municipal clerk. A third son, Mitra's younger brother Sarat Kumar, was born at Bhagalpur shortly after. In Bhagalpur, Mitra began school at the Bhagalpore Zilla School. Around 1897-1898, when aged six or seven, his interest in atomospheric science began after hearing the story of Ramchandra Chatterjee, a Bengali aeronaut who a year before Mitra's birth, on 4 May 1889, had become the first Indian to make a solo balloon flight. The story prompted Mitra to ask his elder brother Satish Kumar about the principles of lighter-than-air flight; his brother explained as best as he could. A few years afterwards, both of Mitra's elder brothers died; following this harsh blow, Joykrishna soon suffered a paralytic attack and became an invalid. Despite the family's increasing financial burdens, Saratkumari managed to educate her two surviving sons. During his childhood and adolescence, Mitra nurtured his interest in science through reading popular scientific articles by leading Bengali scientists, including some by Jagadish Chandra Bose. After passing his examinations from the Bhagalpore Zilla school, Mitra was admitted to the FA (intermediate-level) program at the T.N.J. College; his father Joykrishna died shortly after. After passing his FA examinations in 1908, Mitra was admitted as a student in Presidency College of the University of Calcutta where he earned a B.Sc.. He continued to develop a passion for physics and scientific research, and was accepted by Jagadish Bose as a research scholar upon completing his master's degree in 1912 with the highest honours. He worked under Professor Bose for a few months before being forced to end his studies due to his family's financial difficulties. University studies and research in France To support his family, after leaving the University of Calcutta, Mitra secured an appointment as a lecturer at his former college, T. N. J. College. Following a brief period there, he was appointed a lecturer at Bankura Christian College. Frustrated by the lack of research opportunities at both institutions, Mitra channelled his energy into developing innovative experiments to demonstrate to his students and writing popular scientific articles in Bengali. In 1916, he was invited by Ashutosh Mukherjee to return to Calcutta University as a post- graduate physics scholar in the new University Science College. There he conducted research into the diffraction and interference of light under C. V. Raman, enhancing Raman's previous research on the diffraction of monochromatic light in an oblique single slit and also devising a better method for determining heliometer diffraction patterns.For this work, which Raman greatly appreciated, Mitra gained a D.Sc. degree in 1919. He also published three papers in the Philosophical Magazine, including one on \\"Asymmetry of the Illumination Curves in Oblique Diffraction\\", and another on Arnold Sommerfeld's approaches to diffraction. After receiving his doctorate, Mitra left for France in 1920 to continue his studies at the University of Paris. There he earned a second doctorate under Charles Fabry in 1923, for a thesis on the determination of wavelength standards in the 2000-2300 √Ö region of copper. He subsequently worked briefly under Marie Curie at the Curie Institute. Made aware of continual developments in the new science of radio communications, Mitra went to the University of Nancy and joined the laboratory of Camille Gutton. Under Gutton, Mitra conducted research on radio valve circuitry before returning to India in late 1923. Research in India Prior to returning to India, Mitra had corresponded with Ashutosh Mukherjee about the growing importance of wireless science and the need to include it in the post-graduate physics curriculum at the Rajabazar Science College, University of Calcutta. Upon his return to Kolkata, he was appointed the university's Khaira Professor of Physics. With Mukherjee's support, in 1924 a \\"Wireless\\" course was introduced as an elective in the Physics MSc. curriculum and a Wireless Laboratory established for research in electron tubes and radio wave propagation. He also initiated a new department at the University of Calcutta that later became the Institute of Radio Physics and Electronics.

He was primarily a political appointee within the federal government's various departments, which at the time included U.S. territories. He is best known as the last Secretary of the Michigan Territory (1835‚Äì1838), Secretary of the Oregon Territory (1849‚Äì1850), and serving a two-month term as Governor of the Oregon Territory after the resignation of General Joseph Lane. He was appointed to the last two positions by President James K. Polk. Michigan In 1835, Prichette was appointed as the Secretary to the Michigan Territory. He served until 1838, with Michigan becoming a state in 1837, with Prichette then serving as the first Secretary of State of Michigan. Wisconsin Territory Prichette purchased the title to the lands of Madison, Wisconsin, by June 1839 and began offering plots for sale to the public. In October 1839, Prichett registered the plat of Madison at the registrar's office of the then-territorial Dane County. At the time he platted the city he was residing in Detroit, Michigan. Also in 1839 he owned the American Hotel in Madison, and attempted to sell the establishment through his attorney, Moses M. Strong. Oregon Prichette came to Oregon from Pennsylvania and served as Territorial secretary from 1849 to 1850.Corning, Howard M. Dictionary of Oregon History.Binfords & Mort Publishing, 1956. He served as acting governor from June 18, 1850, to August 18, 1850. John P. Gaines had been appointed governor, but did not arrive in Oregon until August 18, when he was sworn in.Horner, John B. (1921). \\" Oregon: Her History, Her Great Men, Her Literature\\". The J.K. Gill Co.: Portland. p. 131. In May 1850, judge Orville C. Pratt of the Oregon Supreme Court appointed Prichette to serve as defense counsel for the Native Americans charged with the Whitman Massacre at their trial in Oregon City, Oregon after the Cayuse War. Shortly after the trial, Prichette was sworn in as governor. According to the account of U.S. Marshall Joseph Meek, Prichette ordered Meek to free the five convicted natives. But Meek refused, on the grounds that former governor Lane had already signed their death warrants, and he carried out the executions. Little is known about Prichette today, as he is mentioned very little in the media reports of his day. No portraits or photographs have been found of him, earning him the distinction of being Oregon's only \\"faceless governor\\". Even the spelling of his last name is disputed, with at least four different spellings depending upon the historical document, including \\"Prichett\\", \\"Pritchett\\", and \\"Pritchette\\". His first name is also spelled \\"Kentzing\\". Later years and death After leaving Oregon he went to Washington, D.C. and worked for the Bureau of Indian Affairs as an agent. In that capacity, he dealt with the Santee Sioux in the Iowa Territory during the Inkpaduta affair in 1857. Prichette later served as a United States Consul to Fiji, and died aboard the British flagged brig Rona en route from Sydney to California via Huaheine in the Society Islands. He died from an unknown ailment on April 12, 1869, at the age of 68 and was buried at sea.

With a spectator capacity of 11,500 people, it is the largest handball and ice hockey venue in the country. H√•kons Hall is regularly used for handball and ice hockey tournaments, concerts, exhibitions, conferences and banquets. The venue is owned by Lillehammer Municipality via the subsidiary Lillehammer Olympiapark, which owns all the Olympic venues in Lillehammer. The Norwegian Olympic Museum is located in the arena, which is located next to the smaller Eidsiva Arena. The hall opened on 1 February 1993 having cost 238 million Norwegian krone (NOK). It was built to host the ice hockey tournament at the 1994 Winter Olympics, and has since hosted the opening and closing ceremonies of the 1994 Winter Paralympics, the 1999 IIHF World Championship in ice hockey, the World Women's Handball Championship in 1993 and 1999, the Junior Eurovision Song Contest 2004, the 2008 European Men's Handball Championship and the 2010 European Women's Handball Championship. Lillehammer IK has occasionally played ice hockey matches at the arena. Construction Stampesletta with H√•kons Hall to the front at the right, and Eidsiva Arena behind it Lillehammer received its first indoor ice rink in 1988, with the opening of Kristins Hall. That same year, the town was awarded the 1994 Winter Olympics, which required the construction of a larger venue for the Olympic ice hockey matches. The naming of the arena was decided by the Lillehammer Municipal Council in October 1988, as part of a broader branding policy, based on the history of the Birkebeiner. H√•kons Hall is named for Haakon Haakonarson, a medieval king of Norway who as a child was transported across by mountains by skiers. Kristin and H√•kon became the mascots for the Olympics, and the twin arenas at Stampesletta were named accordingly. Protests were made in Bergen, as local patriots felt it was not suitable that a sports venue had such a similar name to H√•konshallen, a medieval hall in Bergen. A climber ascending the wall. In June 1989, the municipal council voted to locate most of the Lillehammer venues in the Stampesletta area, and to place H√•kons Hall adjacent to Kristins Hall. This was controversial and many councilors voted for the original decentralized plan, with the venues spread out through the municipality. The application for the Olympics called for building up to five ice venues in Lillehammer. For post-Olympic use, Kristins Hall was designated as the main ice rink for Lillehammer, while it was planned that H√•kons Hall would be used for larger events. On 8 December 1989, the International Olympic Committee rejected two demands from the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) for the ability to host a minimum of 12,000 spectators in the larger ice hockey venue and for a women's ice hockey tournament. The decision about the location of the ice hockey venues was made on 10 October 1990. H√•kons Hall would be the main venue, supplemented by Gj√∏vik Olympic Cavern Hall in Gj√∏vik. The proposal to have figure skating at H√•kons Hall was rejected, and instead it was to be held at Hamar Olympic Amphitheatre in Hamar. In 1990, the Norwegian Cycling Federation recommended H√•kons Hall as one of several possible places to build a velodrome for the Union Cycliste Internationale's 1993 UCI Track Cycling World Championships. The same year, H√•kons Hall was proposed to supplement Oslo Spektrum as a venue for a proposed pan-European professional ice hockey league. Construction was approved by the Parliament of Norway in April 1990, including funding. Original design plans called for a simple hangar-like design, and original cost estimates were for NOK 191 million. However, in March 1991, the municipal council decided to increase spending on the venue to make it more aesthetic. The re-design also included telescopic stands and better acoustics, to allow for more flexible use after the Olympics. The main contractor was Veidekke and construction cost NOK 238 million. Grants were given from the Norwegian Water Resources and Energy Directorate and SINTEF for energy economization. The work on the hall was concluded on 1 February 1993. It was the 27th indoor ice hockey rink in Norway. Facilities Indoor Panorama of H√•kons Hall (March 2013) The structure is dug out of the ground so it does not appear monumental in size from the outside. The roof consists of four sections held up by double trussed beams in glued laminated timber, with lengths up to . The hall is long and has a total surface area of . The main hall has a floor area of , with an activity area of . The maximum ceiling height is , and there is a direct drive-in entrance to the hall for exhibitions. The venue has a capacity for 11,500 seated spectators. The stands are flexible and telescopic, allowing for flexibility in hall use and seating capacity. The arena can be configured with a stage. The hall can be set up to serve 2,000 people at a banquet, or divided up to serve smaller groups. The venue also features a cafeteria which can seat 200 people. For trade fairs, the venue offers , in addition to the VIP and lobby facilities. The same area can also be used for conferences, and the venue can be split up into section to create group rooms, theme rooms and banquet rooms. H√•kons Hall Sports Centre is part of the complex which supplements the main hall with a recreational training facility. It can make use of the main hall for two handball or football courts, or six volleyball or badminton courts. In addition, there is a permanent health club, a climbing wall, an aerobic room, a golf center with two golf simulators and a putting green, and two badminton courts, all served by 13 changing rooms. The venue also features a long running track. The cooling and heating systems for H√•kons Hall and Eidsiva Arena are connected, allowing them to function as energy reserves for each other. Events Kurt Nilsen performing during Idrettsgallaen 2010. During the 1994 Winter Olympics, H√•kons Hall hosted the ice hockey tournament along with Gj√∏vik Olympic Cavern Hall between 12 and 26 February. H√•kons Hall hosted 21 games, including the final which saw Sweden beat Canada in a penalty shootout. In the 1994 Winter Paralympics, H√•kons Hall was used for the opening and closing ceremonies. The first major international tournament in the hall was some matches of the 1993 World Women's Handball Championship. Lillehammer IK plays its home matches at Eidsiva Arena, but in 1995 the play-off match between it and neighbor town rivals Storhamar Dragons was played at H√•kons Hall. The match saw more than 5,000 spectators, the record for Lillehammer IK. In 1995, the award ceremony for Spellemannsprisen, Norwegian music's highest award, was held at H√•kons Hall. Norway hosted the 1999 IIHF Ice Hockey World Championship in Oslo, Lillehammer and Hamar. H√•kons Hall featured Group D, consisting of Russia, Finland, Belarus and Kazakhstan, as well as the semi- finals, the bronze final and the final. Tickets were sold as twins, with two games being staged with a one-hour interlude on the same ticket. The same year, H√•kons Hall was one of seven venues used for the 1999 World Women's Handball Championship. In addition to group stage and play-off matches, it was awarded the final. Oslo Spektrum was also considered to hold the final, but with only 8,500 seats and a higher rent, H√•kons Hall was preferred. H√•kons Hall hosted the Junior Eurovision Song Contest 2004 on 20 November 2004, won by Mar√≠a Isabel with \\"Antes Muerta que Sencilla\\". Norway was the host of the 2008 European Men's Handball Championship; the group stage games were played in four other Norwegian cities, while the play-off and final was played in H√•kons Hall in January 2008. The final saw Denmark beat Croatia in front of 9,052 spectators. In 2010, Idrettsgallaen, a show to honor the past year's Norwegian sports and athletes achievements, was hosted at H√•kons Hall. Norway and Denmark co-hosted the 2010 European Women's Handball Championship in December 2010, with the matches played in Norway being at H√•kons Hall and Arena Larvik. Lillehammer featured Norway's group in the first and second group stages, while the knockout stage was played in Denmark. On 18 November 2017, a match between rivals Lillehammer IK and Storhamar Ishockey took place in H√•kons Hall, this match was marketed as the \\"Hockey Classic\\" and was a huge success. The game was watched by a record setting 10,031 spectators in the Norwegian GET-ligaen and a new Hockey Classic is set to take place on 17 November 2018.

It is southwest of Alton, on the A31 road. It is situated on the borders of the South Downs National Park on the Pilgrims' Way that leads from Winchester to Canterbury. History Four Marks was originally settled by veterans of the Crimean War, who were allocated plots for their smallholdings, and was the site of a telegraph. According to Bartholomew's Gazetteer, the village of Four Marks is the only so named place in the United Kingdom. The first mention of it appears in a document c.1550, albeit spelt differently. The heading of the page can be translated as ‚ÄòPerambulation of the Manor of Alresford‚Äô and consists of a description of the boundaries. The reference to Four Marks translates roughly as ‚Äúa certain vacant piece of land called Fowrem‚Äôkes near Bookmere and so called Fowrem‚Äôkes because iiii adjoining tithings abut there namely the tithings of Medsted Ropley Faryngdon & Chawton‚Äù. There were thus borders (marks in Old English) extending in four directions, called a quadripoint. The area was well known as Four Marks and even had its own post office and facility for cancelling stamps. The first mention of the post office is a record in the proof books of the General Post Office of the issue of a rubber datestamp on 25 March 1897. Four Marks did not become a parish until 1932 when seven parishes were annexed to create it. It included parts of the above-mentioned parishes i.e. Medstead, Ropley, Farringdon and Chawton, Kitwood, East Tisted and Newton Valence.Four Marks: Its Life and Origins, by Betty Mills, 1995, Local amenities The village has its own restored railway station on the Watercress Line, services from which connect with the nearest national rail station to the northeast, at , although being a heritage railway it does not run commuter services.

Aside from the main dome, the complex includes a gym, an ice rink, a hotel and three large car parks. It was the largest indoor venue of its kind in Poland until it was surpassed by Krak√≥w Arena in 2014. The Spodek hosts many important cultural and business events. Music concerts are especially common non-sport events. It can hold around 11,500 people, although this number is in practice limited to 10,000 or even 8,000 due to stage set-ups obscuring the view. Its Polish name refers to a flying saucer since its iconic shape resembles a UFO. Spodek is a major contribution to the cultural significance of Katowice in Poland, especially for the younger generations. It has also been used as an unofficial logo for the city on posters promoting redevelopment in Katowice. Moreover, Spodek is home to ice hockey clubs in the winter months. History The idea of building a large venue originated in 1955, while Katowice was temporarily renamed Stalinogr√≥d. A contest was held to select the best design. Initially, it was to be constructed on the outskirts of town, but the Voivodeship National Council decided it should be built near the city center. A mining waste dump site classified \\"2A\\" was chosen for construction. The classification \\"2A\\" indicated medium mining damage with a possibility of local cave-ins. While excavating the foundations, the workers dug through coal instead of soil. Soon after construction began, rumors of design flaws in the new building spread, including the rumour that the dome would collapse when the scaffolding was removed. Because of this, in 1964, construction was halted for 18 months. Spodek's architects and chief engineers entered the dome when the supports were dismantled as a response to those rumors; clearly they survived. Before opening the building to the public, endurance tests were conducted ‚Äì 3,500 soldiers marched into the hall and vibration of the building was measured. The outcome was positive. Technology Detail of Spodek Night illumination of the fa√ßade Spodek and Katowice centrum at night Maciej Gintowt and Maciej Krasi≈Ñski, architects of Spodek, designed the Spodek as one of the first major structures to employ the principle of tensegrity.

Born in Kimberley to Greek immigrant parents, Balaskas made his first-class debut for Griqualand West in 1926/27, but did not really break through until 1929/30. In that year he topped both the runs and wickets lists in the Currie Cup by taking 39 wickets at 21.20, including five five-wicket hauls, and scoring 644 runs at over 80, including a career-best 206 against Rhodesia. The following season he made his Test match debut at Johannesburg's Old Wanderers ground, but made no impact, scoring 7 and 3 and bowling just two overs in the match. The second Test at Cape Town proved only slightly better: South Africa recorded an innings victory, but Balaskas made a duck and took 2‚Äì104 in the match; he was dropped for the rest of the series. In 1931/32 he toured Australia and New Zealand with South Africa, but could make the Test side only for the second leg of the tour, repaying the selectors with his only Test century, 122 not out at Wellington. His next Test appearances came in England in 1935, and it was there at Lord's (his only appearance of the series) that he produced the best bowling performance of his career, recording splendid analyses of 32‚Äì8‚Äì49‚Äì5 and 27‚Äì8‚Äì54‚Äì4 to help his country to their first Test victory on English soil. Balaskas took nine wickets in three Tests against Australia the following winter, and playing for Transvaal took 8‚Äì60 against Western Province in 1937/38, but there was to be only one further international appearance, against England at Cape Town in 1938/39, and a return of 0‚Äì115, together with the coming of World War II, sealed his fate as a Test cricketer. He resumed his domestic cricket career after the war, and enjoyed a fine 1945/46 season when he took 47 wickets at 15.95, but after a couple of matches the following year he hung up his bat for good. Balaskas has the third-lowest Test Match batting average of any player who has made a century, with 14.50. He died in Hyde Park, Johannesburg at the age of 83.

In 1765, colonists in Boston staged the first act of defiance against the British government at the tree. The tree became a rallying point for the growing resistance to the rule of Britain over the American colonies, and the ground surrounding it became known as Liberty Hall. The Liberty Tree was felled by Loyalist Nathaniel Coffin Jr. in August 1775. The Loyalists of Massachusetts And the Other Side of the American Revolution By James Henry Stark History =Stamp Act protests= \\"The Colonists Under Liberty Tree,\\" Cassell's Illustrated History of England, 1865. In 1765 the British government imposed a Stamp Act on the American colonies. It required all legal documents, permits, commercial contracts, newspapers, pamphlets, and playing cards in the American colonies to carry a tax stamp. Colonists were outraged. In Boston, a group of local businessmen calling themselves the Loyal Nine began meeting in secret to plan a series of protests against the Stamp Act. On August 14, 1765, a crowd gathered in Boston under a large elm tree at the corner of Essex Street and Orange Street (the latter of which was renamed Washington Street) to protest the hated Stamp Act. Hanging from the tree was a straw-stuffed effigy labeled \\"A. O.\\" for Andrew Oliver, the colonist chosen by King George III to impose the Stamp Act. Beside it hung a British cavalry jackboot, its sole painted green. This second effigy represented the two British ministers who were considered responsible for the Stamp Act: the Earl of Bute (the boot being a pun on \\"Bute\\") and Lord George Grenville (the green being a pun on \\"Grenville\\"). Peering up from inside the boot was a small devil figure, holding a copy of the Stamp Act and bearing a sign that read, \\"What Greater Joy did ever New England see / Than a Stampman hanging on a Tree!\\" This was the first public show of defiance against the Crown and spawned the resistance that led to the American Revolutionary War 10 years later. The tree became a central gathering place for protesters, and the ground surrounding it became popularly known as Liberty Hall. A liberty pole was installed nearby with a flag that could be raised above the tree to summon the townspeople to a meeting. Ebenezer Mackintosh, a shoemaker who handled much of the hands-on work of hanging effigies and leading angry mobs, became known as \\"Captain General of the Liberty Tree.\\" Paul Revere included the Liberty Tree in an engraving, \\"A View of the Year 1765.\\" When the Stamp Act was repealed in 1766, townspeople gathered at the Liberty Tree to celebrate. They decorated the tree with flags and streamers, and when evening fell, hung dozens of lanterns from its branches. A copper sign was fastened to the trunk which read, \\"This tree was planted in the year 1646, and pruned by order of the Sons of Liberty, Feb. 14th, 1766.\\" Soon colonists in other towns, from Newport, Rhode Island to Charleston, South Carolina, began naming their own liberty trees, and the Tree of Liberty became a familiar symbol of the American Revolution. =Other protests= The Sons of Liberty tarring and feathering John Malcolm under the Liberty Tree The Loyal Nine eventually became part of a larger group, the Sons of Liberty. They continued to use the Liberty Tree as a gathering place for protests, leading loyalist Peter Oliver to write bitterly in 1781, > This Tree stood in the Town, & was consecrated for an Idol for the Mob to > Worship; it was properly the Tree ordeal, where those, whom the Rioters > pitched upon as State delinquents, were carried to for Trial, or brought to > as the Test of political Orthodoxy. During the Liberty Riot of 1768, to protest the seizure of John Hancock's ship by the Royal Navy, townspeople dragged a customs commissioner's boat out of the harbor all the way to the Liberty Tree, where it was condemned at a mock trial and burned on Boston Common. Two years later, a funeral procession for the victims of the Boston Massacre passed by the tree. It was also the site of protests against the Tea Act. In 1774, a customs official and staunch loyalist named John Malcolm was stripped to the waist, tarred and feathered, and forced to announce his resignation under the tree. The following year, Thomas Paine published an ode to the Liberty Tree in the Pennsylvania Gazette. In the years leading up to the war, the British made the Liberty Tree an object of ridicule. British soldiers tarred and feathered a man named Thomas Ditson, and forced him to march in front of the tree. During the Siege of Boston, a party of British soldiers and Loyalists led by Job Williams cut the tree down, knowing what it represented to the patriots, and used it for firewood. Later, in the Raid on Charlottetown (1775), American privateers sought revenge against the man who cut the tree down, Loyalist Nathaniel Coffin Jr. Following the British evacuation in 1776, patriots returning to Boston erected a liberty pole at the site. For many years the tree stump was used as a reference point by local citizens, similar to the Boston Stone. During an 1825 tour of Boston, the Marquis de Lafayette declared, \\"The world should never forget the spot where once stood Liberty Tree, so famous in your annals.\\" Memorials Original plaque over where the historic Liberty Tree once stood At the 1964 New York World's Fair a sculpture of the tree designed by Albert Surman was a featured exhibit in the New England Pavilion. When the Liberty Tree Mall was opened in 1972, the sculpture was installed at center court. In October 1966, the Boston Herald began running stories pointing out that the only commemoration of the Liberty Tree site was a grimy plaque, installed in the 1850s, on a building at 630 Washington Street three stories above what is now the intersection of Essex and Washington Streets, a block east of the Boston Common. Reporter Ronald Kessler found that the plaque was covered with bird droppings and obscured by a Kemp's hamburger sign. Local guidebooks did not mention it.Boston Herald, October 2, 1966, Section One. Mass. Gov. Volpe examines original Liberty Tree plaque To call attention to how obscure the site had become, Kessler interviewed waitresses at the Essex Delicatessen below the bas relief plaque on Washington Street. None knew what the Liberty Tree was. \\"The Liberty Tree? That's a roast beef sandwich with a slice of Bermuda onion, Russian dressing, and a side of potato salad,\\" said one waitress who had worked beneath the plaque for 20 years. New bronze plaque on Liberty Tree Plaza in Boston Kessler persuaded then Massachusetts Governor John A. Volpe to visit the site. A photo of Volpe examining the plaque from a fire engine ladder appeared on page one of the 6 October 1966 edition of the Boston Herald.Boston Herald, October 6, 1966, p. 1. According to Kessler, Volpe promised to preserve the site in the form of a park with monuments, and \\"Edward J. Logue, the administrator of the Boston Redevelopment Authority, said the park would be a 'handsome, open space' with grass, benches, plaques explaining the history of the tree, and 'the largest elm tree that can be transported and is resistant to Dutch elm disease.' ... That promise was never fulfilled.\\" Kessler explored the subject further and presented the entire history of the Liberty Tree in \\"America Must Remember Boston's Liberty Tree\\". In 1974, funding was approved for a small park at Washington and Essex, which at that time was part of an area known as the Combat Zone. Plans to plant trees there had to be scrapped because there were too many underground utilities. The Boston Redevelopment Authority ultimately placed a small bronze plaque in the sidewalk across the street from the bas relief plaque. The plaque bears the inscription \\"SONS OF LIBERTY, 1766; INDEPENDENCE of their COUNTRY, 1776.\\" In December 2018, the city finally opened a suitable plaza commemorating the Liberty Tree. Called Liberty Tree Plaza, it is at 2 Boylston Street across the street from the original bas relief with tables and chairs, landscaping, lighting, an elm tree to commemorate the original tree that British soldiers cut down in 1775 before the outbreak of the American Revolution, and a stone monument inscribed with the history of the Liberty Tree. The Liberty Tree \\"became a rallying point for colonists protesting the British-imposed Stamp Act in 1765 and became an important symbol of their cause,\\" the inscription says. \\"These 'Sons of Liberty' began the struggle that led to the Revolutionary War and American independence.\\" Boston's Old State House museum houses a remnant of the flag that flew above the Liberty Tree, and one of the original lanterns that were hung from the tree during the Stamp Act repeal celebration in 1766. Other trees Many other towns designated their own Liberty Trees. Most have been lost over time, although Randolph, New Jersey claims a white oak Liberty Tree dating to 1720. A 400-year-old tulip poplar stood on the grounds of St. John's College in Annapolis, Maryland until 1999, when it was felled after Hurricane Floyd caused irreparable damage to it. The Liberty Tree in Acton, Massachusetts, was an elm tree that lasted until about 1925. In 1915, knowing that the Liberty Tree was getting older, Acton students planted the Peace Tree, a maple that still stands today. The Arbres de la libert√© (\\"Liberty Trees\\"), inspired by the American example, were a symbol of the French Revolution, the first being planted in 1790 by a pastor of a Vienne village, inspired by the Liberty Tree of Boston. The last surviving liberty elm in France from c.1790 still stands in the parish of La Madeleine at Faycelles, in the D√©partement de Lot. Liberty trees were also planted on the Place Royale in Brussels on July 9, 1794, after the occupation of the Austrian Netherlands by French revolutionary forces,Alain de Gueldre et al., Kroniek van Belgi√´ (Antwerp and Zaventem, 1987), p. 515. and on Dam Square in Amsterdam on January 19, 1795, in celebration of the alliance between the French Republic and the Batavian Republic. Tipu Sultan gave his support to French soldiers at Srirangapatna in setting Jacobin club in 1797. Tipu himself called Citizen Tipu and he planted the Tree of Liberty at srirangapatana. In 1798, with the establishing of the short-lived Roman Republic, such a tree was also planted in Rome's Piazza delle Scole, to mark the legal abolition of the Roman Ghetto (which was, however, re-instated with the resumption of Papal rule). The last surviving liberty elm in Italy, planted in 1799 to celebrate the new Parthenopean Republic, stood until recently in Montepaone, Calabria. The tree was badly damaged in a storm in 2008 and has been replaced by a clone. As students at the T√ºbinger Stift, the German philosopher Georg Hegel and his friend Friedrich Schelling planted a liberty tree on the outskirts of T√ºbingen, Germany. Besides actual trees, the term \\"Tree of Liberty\\" is associated with a quotation from a 1787 letter written by Thomas Jefferson to William Stephens Smith: \\"The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants.\\" See also * \\"Liberty Tree\\", a poem by Thomas Paine (Wikisource) * Pine Tree Flag, sometimes called the Liberty Tree Flag * Liberty Generation * Sir Francis Bernard, 1st Baronet * Liberty Tree Foundation for the Democratic Revolution References  External links  * \\"A View of the Year 1765\\" by Paul Revere (engraving) * Must Remember Boston's Liberty Tree\\" by Ronald Kessler * \\"Liberty Tree\\" by Thomas Paine (poem) * * Category:American Revolution Category:History of Boston Category:History of the Thirteen Colonies Category:Individual elm trees Category:Massachusetts in the American Revolution Category:Liberty symbols Category:18th century in Boston Category:Chinatown, Boston Category:Boston Common Category:1770s individual tree deaths Category:Individual trees in Massachusetts ","title":"Liberty Tree"},{"id":"2447097","text":"Seminary Ridge is a dendritic ridge which was an area of Battle of Gettysburg engagements in July 1863 during the American Civil War (1861‚Äì1865), and of military installations during World War II (1941‚Äì1945). 1910 Virginia Monument on Seminary Ridge. Geography Seminary Ridge is a northern portion of the drainage divide between the Marsh Creek Watershed on the west and the Rock Creek Watershed (east). At the south end of Oak Ridge (the northernmost portion of the divide), the north-south McPherson and Seminary ridges bifurcate southward at the triple watershed point of Willoughby and Pitzer runs (southward tributaries of Marsh Creek) with a Rock Creek eastward tributary. From the triple point, Seminary Ridge extends southward to an area with eastward drainage into the Rock Cr tributary (Stevens Creek), with the borough of Gettysburg, and with the TBD. Farther south into the Gettysburg National Park, Seminary Ridge continues as far as a branch of Pitzer Run, which divides the ridgeline (), around which the drainage divide curves to the east. The ridgeline continues south of the branch, crossing the Millerstown Road. Between the Millerstown and Emmitsburg road crossings, the west side of the ridgeline is an elevated area (hornfel along the northwest edge of a diabase sheethttp://www.dcnr.state.pa.us/topogeo/pub/openfile/pdfs/of06_02.pdf) about 1 mile wide along the Emmitsburg Road. Along this east side of this elevated area, the ridgeline is Warfield Ridge, the southernmost portion of Seminary Ridge near the south end of the Gettysburg Battlefield. South of the tip of Seminary/Warfield Ridge tip, the Marsh/Rock creeks' drainage divide continues about 4 miles to near the Mason‚ÄìDixon line at their confluence to form the Monocacy River. The portion of Seminary Ridge on the western side of Gettysburg, Pennsylvania includes the railroad cut behind houses north of Buford Avenue and the historic Gettysburg Armory. Extending south are Schultz Woods, Spangler Woods, Berdan Woods, the McMillan Woods Youth Campground,http://www.nps.gov/gett/planyourvisit/campgrounds.htm Pitzer Woods, Biesecker's Woods, and the 1895 Longstreet Tower, which provides an observation platform for the \\"southern end\\" of Seminary Ridge (Warfield Ridge). The Eisenhower National Historic Site on the west of the ridge is visible from the tower. Seminary Ridge Avenue and the sections of West Confederate Avenue (northwest and southwest) generally extend along the landform's ridgeline and provide access to numerous battle monuments on the ridge, including the prominent Virginia Monument. Seminary Ridge is crossed by Buford and Springs avenues, as well as West Middle Street. =South Seminary Ridge= South Seminary Ridge is a Gettysburg Battlefield landform south of an east-west branch of Pitzer Run, which separates South Seminary Ridge from a separate landform to the north on the west of Gettysburg with the Lutheran Theological Seminary at Gettysburg. South of the Pitzer Run branch, the ridgeline of South Seminary Ridge extends from Pitzer Woods, across the Millerstown Road, past the Longstreet Tower to the Emmitsburg Road and on to the southernmost state memorial on the battlefield (Alabama), which is just west of the right flank marker for the Confederate Line. Warfield Ridge is a portion of South Seminary Ridge southward to the Alabama Memorial, and the ridge landform continues southward out of the Gettysburg National Park to where Ridge Road is on the crest.Note: South of the Gettysburg National Military Park, the ridgeline naturally extends southward to where the ridgeline ends at Marsh Creek near a former mill at Natural Dam Road near the Mason‚ÄìDixon line. However, the ridgeline was cut by the mid-20th century construction of U.S. Route 15 in Pennsylvania. History The 1761 Samuel Gettys tavern was built near the ridge at the crossroads east of Stevens Creek, and it preceded both the c. 1812 construction of the Chambersburg Pike across the ridge and the nearby \\"Gettysburg Theological Seminary\\" being established on the ridge on August 1, 1826. In 1832, Old Dorm (now Schmucker Hall) was built, and Pennsylvania College (now Gettysburg College) was started on the east side of the ridge. On the ridge along the Chambersburg Pike, the Thaddeus Stevens building near the seminary (used for Robert E. Lee's 1863 headquarters) was built in 1834. At the time of the battle, the section of the ridge at the extension of West Middle St (the Hagerstown Rd) was known as \\"Haupt's Hill\\". =Civil War and postbellum= Seminary Ridge was the site of Battle of Gettysburg fighting on July 1, 1863, as well as a Pitzer Woods engagement on July 2. Robert E. Lee established his headquarters on the ridge just north of the Chambersburg pike, and the ridge also served as the Confederate line of battle for July 2 & 3 attacks against Union Army positions on Cemetery Ridge. On July 3, 500 men in George Pickett's division were killed/wounded on Seminary Ridge (including 88 lost in one regiment of Kemper's Brigade) from the Federal artillery counterfire prior to Pickett's Charge. The last hospital patient of the seminary's Old Dorm left on September 16, 1863. Longstreet Tower (No. 2 of five at Gettysburg) was built on the ridge by the War Department in 1895. * original formats: 1895, 1900, 1909, 1913, 1918 West Confederate Avenue was built at the turn of the 20th century for Seminary Ridge tourism, while Sharpshooters Avenue (named Berdan Avenue by 1930) was extended from W Confederate Avenue in 1917 for access to a Pitzer Woods monument. In 1918, various military camp sites (e.g., Camp Colt) were located in the \\"Field of Pickett's Charge\\" between the Seminary and Cemetery ridges.

Cosmic rays are highly energetic charged particles from beyond Earth, ranging from protons, alpha particles, and nuclei of many heavier elements. About 1% of cosmic rays also consist of free electrons. Cosmic rays cause spallation when a ray particle (e.g. a proton) impacts with matter, including other cosmic rays. The result of the collision is the expulsion of large numbers of nucleons (protons and neutrons) from the object hit. This process goes on not only in deep space, but in Earth's upper atmosphere and crustal surface (typically the upper ten meters) due to the ongoing impact of cosmic rays. The process Cosmic ray spallation is thought to be responsible for the abundance in the universe of some light elements‚Äîlithium, beryllium, and boron‚Äîas well as the isotope helium-3. This process (cosmogenic nucleosynthesis) was discovered somewhat by accident during the 1970s: models of Big Bang nucleosynthesis suggested that the amount of deuterium was too large to be consistent with the expansion rate of the universe and there was therefore great interest in processes that could generate deuterium after the Big Bang nucleosynthesis. Cosmic ray spallation was investigated as a possible process to generate deuterium. As it turned out, spallation could not generate much deuterium, but the new studies of spallation showed that this process could generate lithium, beryllium and boron; indeed, isotopes of these elements are over-represented in cosmic ray nuclei, as compared with solar atmospheres (whereas hydrogen and helium are present in about primordial ratios in cosmic rays). The x-process in cosmic rays is the primary means of nucleosynthesis for the five stable isotopes of lithium, beryllium, and boron. As the proton-proton chain reaction cannot proceed beyond 4He due to the unbound nature of 5He and 5Li, and the triple alpha process skips over all species between 4He and 12C, these elements are not produced in the main reactions of stellar nucleosynthesis. In addition, nuclei of these elements (e.g. 7Li) are relatively weakly bound, resulting in their rapid destruction in stars and no significant accumulation. It was thus postulated that another nucleosynthesis process occurring outside stars was necessary to explain their existence in the universe. This process is now known to occur in cosmic rays, where lower temperature and particle density favor reactions leading to the synthesis of lithium, beryllium, and boron. In addition to the above light elements, tritium and isotopes of aluminium, carbon (carbon-14), phosphorus (phosphorus-32), chlorine, iodine and neon are formed within solar system materials through cosmic ray spallation, and are termed cosmogenic nuclides. Since they remain trapped in the atmosphere or rock in which they formed, some can be very useful in the dating of materials by cosmogenic radionuclide dating, particularly in the geological field. In formation of a cosmogenic nuclide, a cosmic ray interacts with the nucleus of an in situ solar system atom, causing cosmic ray spallation. These isotopes are produced within earth materials such as rocks or soil, in Earth's atmosphere, and in extraterrestrial items such as meteorites. By measuring cosmogenic isotopes, scientists are able to gain insight into a range of geological and astronomical processes. There are both radioactive and stable cosmogenic isotopes. Some of the well-known naturally-occurring radioisotopes are tritium, carbon-14, and phosphorus-32. The timing of their formation determines whether nuclides formed by cosmic ray spallation are termed primordial or are termed cosmogenic (a nuclide cannot belong to both classes). The stable nuclides of lithium, beryllium, and boron found on Earth are thought to have been formed by the same process as the cosmogenic nuclides but at an earlier time in cosmic ray spallation predominantly before the solar system's formation, and thus they are by definition primordial nuclides and not cosmogenic. In contrast, the radioactive nuclide beryllium-7 falls into the same light element range but has a half-life too short for it to have been formed before the formation of the solar system, so that it cannot be a primordial nuclide. Since the cosmic ray spallation route is the most likely source of beryllium-7 in the environment, it is therefore cosmogenic.

The office is of great antiquity, the holder having been termed remembrancer, memorator, rememorator, registrar, keeper of the register, despatcher of business. The Remembrancer compiled memorandum rolls and thus ‚Äúreminded‚Äù the barons of the Exchequer of business pending. There were at one time three clerks of the remembrance, the King's Remembrancer, Lord Treasurer's Remembrancer and Remembrancer of First-Fruits and Tenths (see Court of First Fruits and Tenths). In England, the latter two offices have become extinct, the Lord Treasurer's Remembrancer being merged in the office of King's Remembrancer in 1833, and the remembrancer of first-fruits by the diversion of the fund (Queen Anne's Bounty Act 1838). By the Queen's Remembrancer Act 1859 that office ceased to exist separately, and the monarch's remembrancer was required to be a master of the court of exchequer. The Judicature Act 1873 attached the office to the Supreme Court of Judicature (today called the Senior Courts), and the Supreme Court of Judicature (Officers) Act 1879 transferred it to the central office of the Supreme Court. By section 8 of that Act, the monarch's remembrancer is a master of the Supreme Court, usually filled by the senior master. The monarch's remembrancer department of the central office is now amalgamated with the judgments and married women acknowledgments department. The monarch's remembrancer still assists at ceremonial functions, relics of the former importance of the office, such as the nomination of sheriffs, the swearing-in of the Lord Mayor of the City of London, the Trial of the Pyx and the acknowledgments of homage for crown lands.

Born in Krozhe, a province of Kovno, he studied in the Nevyozer Kloiz under Rabbi Yisrael Salanter and in the Volozhin yeshiva under the Netziv. In Volozhin, he was known as \\"Rav Yaakov Charif\\" (Rabbi Jacob Sharp) because of his sharp mind. He became successively rabbi of Vilon in 1868, Yurburg in 1870, Zhagory and then Kovno. His fame as a preacher spread, so that in 1883 the community of Vilna selected him as its maggid. RJJ, the Rabbi Jacob Joseph School is named after him, and a playground is named after and honors the memory of a great-grandson of Rabbi Jacob Joseph who carried his name. Chief rabbi The Jewish community of New York wanted to be united under a common religious authority, and although the Reform and liberal factions ridiculed the idea, the mainly Russian Orthodox Ashkenazi community sent a circular offering the post throughout Eastern Europe. Rabbi Jacob Joseph was among those offered the prestigious position. He hesitated in coming to America, aware that there were fewer religious Jews. Nevertheless, in 1888 he accepted the challenge in order to support his family, and also because he faced severe debt in Russia. The Association of American Orthodox Hebrew Congregations‚Äîcomprising 18 congregations and headed by Beth Hamedrash Hagadol‚Äîwas thrilled when he accepted the position. They attempted to create one central rabbinic authority in America to maintain order in the field of Kashrus and expand Jewish education programs. Their idea ultimately failed. Although Joseph certainly possessed the credentials needed, he was confronted with many problems, primarily diverse groups of Jews, which also included anti-religious factions and Communists. His tenure was marked by the divisiveness of New York Jewry, and the polemic of the kosher slaughterhouses of the city. Vehemently anti-religious Yiddish newspapers unleashed their wrath, spreading false and malicious rumours about the chief rabbi's personal life. Eventually, after six years, the Association stopped paying his salary. The butchers then paid him until 1895. =Successes= Although Joseph fought a losing battle in the kosher meat and poultry industry, he managed to achieve some notable accomplishments, including the hiring of qualified shochtim, introducing irremovable seals (\\"plumba\\") to identify kosher birds, and setting up Mashgichim to oversee slaughter houses. He also took an active role in establishing the Etz Chaim Yeshiva‚Äîthe first yeshiva on the Lower East Side, which was founded in 1886. (It was the forerunner of the Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary). Works Joseph published: *Le'Beis Yaakov (Vilna, 1888), a collection of homilies and novell√¶. Death Rabbi Joseph Funeral Riot (Le Monde illustr√©, August 23 1902). In 1897, Joseph suffered a stroke, which incapacitated him for the rest of his life. He died at age 62 and his funeral was one of the largest in New York, attended by more than 50,000 Jews. Unfortunately, it was partly marred by a public disturbance in which a number of people were injured. Employees of R. Hoe & Company, manufacturer of printing presses, threw water, paper, wood, and iron from the upper floors of the factory at 504 Grand Street. Two hundred policemen responded to the call, hitting and pushing the mourners. Some of Hoe‚Äôs employees, who had been harassing local Jews for some time, joined the police in the riot and beat mourners. Jewish oral tradition blamed the anti-Semitism of both the Irish factory workers and the police. Recent historical research shows that the factory workers were mostly Germans, not Irish, and that the police were following standard practice in quelling a riot. On the whole, the police kept a tight lid on inter-group violence.Edward T. O'Donnell, \\"Hibernians Versus Hebrews? A New Look at the 1902 Jacob Joseph Funeral Riot,\\" Journal of the Gilded Age & Progressive Era (2007) 6#2 pp 209-225. After Joseph's death, a succession dispute diluted the office of Chief Rabbi and the title was effectively worthless. Ironically, after Joseph's death many congregations began to give him the honor which they had withheld during his life. Aside from the tens of thousands who came to see him lying on his death bed, forty rabbis gathered in the cemetery for the funeral. Each one vied with his colleague to give him a better eulogy. The congregations also competed with each other, each one desiring to bury him in its own cemetery. Congregation Adath Israel on Elridge Street promised to give his widow $1,000 on the spot and $10 a week all the rest of her life. Congregation Beis HaMidrash HaGadol was permitted to bury him in their plot at the Union Field Cemetery in Ridgewood, Queens. GPS GPS Location of burial site. This became a good business venture, for the plots near the grave of the chief rabbi became extremely valuable. The widow received the amount promised for several years, and then they stopped sending her the money. Captain Jacob Joseph A playground on Manhattan's Lower East Side, bounded by Henry and Rutgers Streets, is named in memory of Captain Jacob Joseph (1920‚Äì1942), great- grandson of Rabbi Jacob Joseph. Captain Joseph was a member of the U.S. Marine Corps during World War II, and scion of a family devoted to religious education and civic affairs. Born and raised in New York, Joseph left Columbia University as a junior in 1938 to enlist in the Marines. Joseph died in action at Guadalcanal on October 22, 1942. Joseph was at the time the youngest captain in the USMC. Five years later, a local law named this playground in his honor. The dedication ceremony was attended by Mayor William O'Dwyer, Parks Commissioner Robert Moses, Councilman Stanley Isaacs, and Captain Joseph‚Äôs father Lazarus Joseph ‚Äì a Democratic Party leader who was a six time State Senator and New York City's Comptroller at the time. The New York City Department of Parks and Recreation also unveiled a bronze commemorative plaque on the flagstaff, which celebrates the life and bravery of Captain Joseph. This playground was built in part to meet the needs of the Rabbi Jacob Joseph School, located at the time on Henry St. The playground serves as a lasting memorial to a World War II hero, as well as to notable members of the Joseph family who have contributed to the surrounding neighborhood and to the larger New York City community. There is a Captain Jacob Joseph Memorial Chapel at Camp Keowa, which is part of the Ten Mile River Boy Scout Camp. The Chapel was restored by a group of veterans led by Scoutmaster Tom Maher. Each August a memorial service is held for Captain Joseph at the camp. The memorial includes an interfaith service during which a Kaddish is said for Captain Joseph‚Äîwho is believed to have no descendants.

Life Mullen was born in Florence, Alabama, grew up in Fort Worth, Texas, graduated from the University of Texas at Austin, and attended graduate school at the University of California, Santa Cruz. As of 2008, she lives in Los Angeles, California. Mullen's most recent work is Urban Tumbleweed: Notes from a Tanka Diary.NPR Mullen began to write poetry as a college student in a multicultural community of writers, artists, musicians, and dancers in Austin, Texas. As an emerging poet, Mullen received a literature award from the Black Arts Academy, a Dobie-Paisano writer‚Äôs fellowship from the Texas Institute of Letters and University of Texas, and an artist residency from the Helene Wurlitzer Foundation of New Mexico. In Texas, she worked in the Artists in Schools program before enrolling in graduate school in California where she continued her study of American literature and encountered even more diverse communities of writers and artists. Mullen was influenced by the social, political, and cultural movements of African Americans, Mexican Americans, and women in the 1960s-70s, including the Civil Rights Movement, Black Power movement, the Black Arts Movement, Chicano Movement, and feminism. Her first book, Tree Tall Woman, which showed traces of all of these influences, was published in 1981.Amazon Especially in her later books, Trimmings, S*PeRM**K*T, Muse & Drudge, and Sleeping with the Dictionary, Mullen frequently combines cultural critique with humor and wordplay as her poetry grapples with topics such as globalization, mass culture, consumerism, and the politics of identity. Critics, including Elisabeth Frost and Juliana Spahr, have suggested that Mullen‚Äôs poetry audience is an eclectic community of collaborative readers who share individual and collective interpretations of poems that may provoke multiple, divergent, or contradictory meanings, according to each reader‚Äôs cultural background.Muse.jhu.edu Mullen has taught at Cornell University and currently teaches courses in American poetry, African-American literature, and creative writing at the University of California, Los Angeles. While living in Ithaca and Rochester, New York, she was a faculty fellow of the Cornell University Society for the Humanities and a Rockefeller fellow at the Susan B. Anthony Institute at University of Rochester. She has received a Gertrude Stein Award for innovative poetry, a Katherine Newman Award for best essay on U.S. ethnic literature, a Foundation for Contemporary Arts Grants to Artists award (2004), and a fellowship from the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation. Her poetry collection, Sleeping with the Dictionary (2002), was a finalist for a National Book Award, National Book Critics Circle Award, and Los Angeles Times Book Prize. She received a PEN/Beyond Margins Award for her Recyclopedia (2006). She is also credited for rediscovering the novel Oreo, published in 1974 by Fran Ross. Mullen won the fourth annual Jackson Poetry Prize from Poets & Writers in 2010. She appears in the documentary film The Black Candle, directed by M. K. Asante, Jr. and narrated by Maya Angelou.  Background  Mullen has stated that she was brought up in Fort Worth, Texas, but that her family is originally from Pennsylvania. Growing up in such a small black community was hard especially because, as Mullen has said in interviews, \\"a black Southern vernacular was spoken, which my family didn't speak.\\" This created a division between Mullen and her peers who considered her an outsider for speaking \\"white.\\"  Language  Mullen recalls on the different languages that she learned as a child as opposed to those around her. When one hears the term different languages one thinks of languages that are spoken in other far away foreign places, yet Mullen is discussing the different types of English that are spoken in her community. The English she grew up learning was considered to be the ‚ÄúStandard English,‚Äù which is summed up as the proper way of speaking English, the one that will make black people more approachable in a nice part of town, the English that will make a person of color employable. The black vernacular is considered to be incorrect, and if people only spoke this vernacular they would be considered uneducated. This did not sit well with Mullen because she wanted black children to understand that being black and educated were not mutually exclusive terms. Mullen says that she does not believe that certain vernaculars are particularly educated or uneducated; society has however decided for them that there is a right way of speaking and a wrong way.  Influences  Language is the bridge that can connect two different cultures, and Mullen experienced the opposite of that when she was growing up at first. The \\"Standard English\\" she spoke created a barrier for her she could not anticipate. As it does for many other black children that speak \\"proper\\" and are considered different for it. This contributes to black children equating their blackness to their language making some feel inadequate because they don‚Äôt sound \\"black enough.\\" As Mullen comes to understand in college there is more than one way of being black, and this came as a shock to her because she was learning about all these other black cultures from a white man. Mullen thought it strange that she could obviously see the blackness of different cultures and yet hold no true meaningful relation to it. There was not type of familiarity between her and all these other black cultures. Even in the black community where she should feel \\"safe\\" in or \\"belong,\\" Mullen felt alienated. Code switching is in many ways the key to survival in these instances. For black children all over they know how to speak when they are hanging out with friends versus how they should speak to a cop if they are pulled over.

There are several types of notice: public notice (or legal notice), actual notice, constructive notice, and implied notice. Service of process At common law, notice is the fundamental principle in service of process. In this case, the service of process puts the defendant \\"on notice\\" of the allegations contained within the complaint, or other such pleading. Since notice is fundamental, a court may rule a pleading defective if it does not put the defendant on notice. In a civil case, personal jurisdiction over a defendant is obtained by service of a summons. Service can be accomplished by personal delivery of the summons or subpoena to the person or an authorized agent of the person. Service may also be made by substituted means; for example, in many jurisdictions, service of a summons can be made on a person of suitable age and discretion at the residence or place of business of the defendant. Jurisdiction over corporations can often be obtained through a government body authorized to receive such process. Due process issues (United States) In the United States, the right to receive notice before the government deprives an individual of a protected interest is guaranteed, along with the opportunity to be heard, by the Due Process Clauses in the Fifth and Fourteenth amendments. The Sixth Amendment also specifically guarantees the right of a criminal defendant to be notified of the charges and their grounds. If a court bases personal jurisdiction over an out-of-state or foreign defendant on a long-arm statute, the court must carefully select a means of notifying the defendant, to comply with the notice requirement of due process. Sometimes this is done by serving agents of the defendant located within the state. Because out-of-state defendants can't always be located easily, some state or local laws may allow for service by publication. An example of this would be printing a notice of the lawsuit in a newspaper published where the defendant is believed to reside. Because the failure of a defendant to appear in court results in a default judgment against him, such measures must be sufficiently calculated to give actual notice to the defendant to satisfy due process. In Mullane v. Central Hanover Bank & Trust Co., the core case setting forth constitutional notice requirements, the U.S. Supreme Court held that notice must be \\"reasonably calculated, under all the circumstances, to apprise interested parties of the pendency of the action and afford them an opportunity to present their objections.\\" Moreover, defendants must be notified by the \\"best practical means\\" available. Notice and knowledge Many statutes include that the accused knowingly have acted in violation. When a party is \\"put on notice\\" th at they are in violation, continued action in violation may be sufficient to evidence knowledge.

With an area of it is the largest island in the Sea of Marmara and is the second largest island of Turkey after G√∂k√ßeada (older name in Turkish: ; Imvros). It is the center of Marmara district in Balƒ±kesir Province. Transportation is possible from Istanbul by ship and ferry, and by motorboat from Tekirdaƒü and Erdek. Marmara island is full of historical treasures which increase its attractiveness. The town of \\"Mermer Plaj\\" / Marble Beach takes its name from the marbles for which the town is famous and which give the island and the sea their name. Etymology Great Ludovisi sarcophagus from the Palazzo Altemps in the National Museum of Rome ‚Äì carved in Proconnesian marble Detail from the Ludovisi sarcophagus In ancient times the island was called Proikonesos () or Prokonnesos (), Latinized as Proconnesus. The modern name \\"Marmara\\" is derived from the Greek (marmaron)Marmaron, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, at Perseus and that from (m√°rmaros), \\"crystalline rock\\", \\"shining stone\\",Marmaros, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, at PerseusMarble, Compact Oxford English Dictionary perhaps from the verb (marma√≠r≈ç), \\"to flash, sparkle, gleam\\",Marmair≈ç, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, at Perseus because it was famous for the white marble quarried there. Under the name Proconnesus it is a titular see of the Roman Catholic Church (the see has been vacant since the death in 1963 of the most recent occupant),Proconnesus catholic-hierarchy.org and of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople. Proconnesian marble is used extensively in the Hagia Sophia in Constantinople, and exclusively in the Herculean Sarcophagus of Genzano now in the British Museum. Additionally, it was used in the Basilica of Maxentius in the Roman Forum (Marble is still the island's primary export). History Historical evidence of the first Hellenic presence on the island of Marmara (ancient Prokonnessos) came with the early colonization of Ionian Greeks in the 8th century BC. Stories and legends identify the island as a visiting place of Jason and the Argonauts and with the Hellenic expedition against Troy. In 493 BC it was burned by a Ph≈ìnician fleet fighting for Darius the Great. The island was ruled for the Achaemenid Empire under a Greek tyrant named Metrodorus. In 410 Alcibiades conquered it for Athens. During the Diocletianic Persecution the Emperor Diocletian ordered low-status Manichaeans to be executed while high-status Manichaeans were to be sent to work in the quarries of Proconnesus or the mines of Khirbat Faynan. During the reign of Constantine the Great in the 4th century notable aristocracy from Constantinople first settled on the island. By 569, many Byzantine aristocrats had built palaces on the island that they had accepted as their home. The greatest palace of this period was built by the Emperor Justinian I. With the Emperor came a large entourage of nobility, palace guards, tradesmen, and servants. Justinian also built a large convent on Marmara that is one of the earliest in recorded history. The Byzantine royal presence on the island was strongly felt through strong ties to the Patriarchate of Constantinople. During most of its history, the island was called \\"Proikonnesos\\" (island of the royal dowry), and \\"Prinkipo\\", (island of the aristocracy). From the fall of the Byzantine Empire through the beginning of the Ottoman period the island was almost exclusively populated by Greek Orthodox Greeks . Beginning in the 17th century some Turks and a relatively large number of Jewish people lived on the island; most of these were Sephardi who had left Spain after the Inquisition. During World War I much of the population was forced off of the island onto the mainland. And, following the war, as a result of the 1923 Treaty of Lausanne and the population exchange between Greece and Turkey, all remaining Greeks native to the island of Marmara emigrated to Greece and other locations around the globe. The island's Greek Orthodox diaspora settled primarily in New Marmara, the island of Euboea, in Greece and in the northern Greek city of Thessaloniki. In addition, Canada, Australia and South America were popular destinations for Greek immigration of that time. Many of the former Jewish residents settled in the North American cities of New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Portland (Oregon) and the Seattle/Tacoma area. Many of the current residents of Marmara Adasi are descendants of Turks who fled Greek islands during the population transfers of the 1920s and Circassians (√áerkesler) originally from the Russian Caucasus. =1935 earthquake= On 4 January 1935 at 16:41:29 local time, an earthquake hit the Marmara Island and its neighboring islands Av≈üa and Pa≈üalimanƒ±, causing five deaths, 30 persons injured and several villages destroyed. Administration center and the villages Marmara Island has five villages and one central town. The center is called Marmara and is the administration center of two more islands (Av≈üa and Ekinlik Islands) nearby. The population was mainly Greek along with some Turkish and Jewish population in Marmara settlement until the population exchange between Greece and Turkey in 1923. Today the local people are originally from different regions of Turkey and Balkans, mainly from Middle and East of Black Sea Region and Western Thrace of Greece. The permanent population, distances from the center, the current names and the previous names of the villages are: *Marmara (Greek; Marmara and Proconnesus); 2183 *√áinarli (Greek; Galemi); 503, 7 Km *G√ºndoƒüdu (Greek; Prastos); 278, 4 Km *Topaƒüa√ß (Greek; Kƒ±lazaki); 518, 12 Km *Asmalƒ± (Greek; Aftoni); 237, 18 Km *Saraylar (Greek; Palatia); 2687, 24 Km Panoramic view A panorama of Marmara See also * SS Kurtulu≈ü, a cargo ship sank off the island in 1942 carrying food aid to Greece.

She graduated from the Guildhall School of Music and Drama in 1986 and began her career in local theatre, whilst teaching drama classes at the University of Salford. Lancashire found popular success in television programmes including Coronation Street (1991‚Äì1996, 2000), Where the Heart Is (1997‚Äì1999), Clocking Off (2000) and Seeing Red (2000) and earned widespread recognition. In July 2000, Lancashire signed a two-year golden handcuffs contract with the ITV network which made her the UK's highest paid television actress. Subsequent television roles include the costume dramas Oliver Twist (2007), Lark Rise to Candleford (2008‚Äì2011) and The Paradise (2012), and the fact based dramas Cherished (2005) and Five Daughters (2010). Since 2012, Lancashire has earned extensive critical acclaim for her roles in the contemporary drama series Last Tango in Halifax (2012‚Äìpresent) and Happy Valley (2014‚Äìpresent). Lancashire has also appeared in the feature films And When Did You Last See Your Father? (2007) and Dad's Army (2016), and West End theatre productions including Blood Brothers in 1990, Guys and Dolls from 2005 to 2006 and Betty Blue Eyes in 2011. Her combined acting credits have earned Lancashire a number of awards and nominations over a career spanning four decades, including two British Academy Television Award wins out of five nominations. She was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2017 Birthday Honours for services to drama. Life and career (20th century) =Early life and career beginnings (1964‚Äì1990)= Sarah-Jane Abigail Lancashire was born on 10 October 1964 in Oldham, Lancashire. Her father, Geoffrey Lancashire (1933‚Äì2004), was a television scriptwriter noted for his work on the soap opera Coronation Street and situation comedies such as The Cuckoo Waltz. Her mother, Hilda, worked as Geoffrey's personal assistant. She has three brothers, one her elder, one younger and a twin. Lancashire was educated at Oldham Hulme Grammar School between 1976‚Äì81. At the age of 17, she started to suffer clinical depression. Lancashire has stated she was never driven by the ideas of fame and status. Her background had inspired an initial interest in working behind the scenes in television. She did not give serious thought to the performing arts until the age of 18. After winning a place at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama, Lancashire realised that she enjoyed acting. She graduated in 1986, describing her time as a student there as \\"tremendous\\" but \\"seriously hard work and quite intimidating\\". After rejection from several repertory theatre companies, Lancashire was given her first acting role by Howard Lloyd-Lewis, artistic director of the Manchester Library Theatre Company, which provided her with an Equity Card. Lancashire performed two plays with the company, Pacific Overtures and The Beauty Game, which she states formed \\"the start of my career as an actor\\". She found her first professional acting experience \\"terrifying\\" as a result of the live audiences, recalling that, \\"because I wore a bathing costume in some of the scenes, I got heckled!\\" She also realised that taking risks or underperforming could have had consequences for her acting career. Her role as Denise in The Beauty Game earned her a nomination for Best Supporting Actress at the Manchester Evening News Theatre Awards. At the age of 22, Lancashire married her first serious boyfriend, Gary Hargreaves, a music lecturer 11 years her senior, whom she had met four years earlier. Recalling the circumstances of her first marriage in 2001, Lancashire stated she only married because she became pregnant and possessed both a traditional outlook and a fear of the stigma of having a child out of wedlock. Thomas, her first child with Hargreaves, was born in 1987; a second son, Matthew, was born in 1989. During her early career, Lancashire found herself with large breaks between theatre appearances. To support herself financially, she worked as a drama teacher for five years at Salford University alongside her acting work. Discussing Lancashire's time as a visiting lecturer in Acting and Characterisation, Professor Ron Cook, Head of the University's School of Media, Music and Performance, noted that Lancashire made a \\"significant impact\\" in the formative stages of the drama department at the University and had also directed student productions. In 1987, Lancashire made a brief appearance in Coronation Street as Wendy Farmer, a prospective lodger of series regular Jack Duckworth (Bill Tarmey). In the late 1980s, she also appeared in an episode of the children's anthology series Dramarama, and a single episode of the ITV sitcom Watching. In 1990, Lancashire received her \\"big break\\" ‚Äî the role of Linda in a production of Willy Russell's Blood Brothers at the Albery Theatre. Although she thoroughly enjoyed performing in London's West End, she found it difficult to reconcile the experience with raising two young children in Manchester. =Breakthrough and popular success (1991‚Äì2000)= The Coronation Street set, pictured in 2005. Lancashire appeared in the serial for five years between 1991 and 1996 Two weeks after finishing her run in Blood Brothers, Lancashire auditioned for the role of new Coronation Street character Raquel Wolstenhulme, a colleague of supermarket employee Curly Watts (Kevin Kennedy). Lancashire joined on a three-month contract, continuing to teach at Salford University for another year. Raquel first appeared on 25 January 1991 and departed on 10 May; having moved to London to try to launch a modelling career. Lancashire had initially been reserved about Raquel's characterisation, noting that her \\"acidic side\\" could have rendered her the \\"street bitch\\" had it been embellished. She took care to highlight Raquel's potential, playing against what had been written to make her more comic, evoking audience sympathy. Between 26 September and 19 October 1991, Lancashire played the title role in an adaption of Educating Rita at the Queen's Theatre, Hornchurch. Following Raquel's reintroduction on 30 December 1991, Lancashire committed herself to Coronation Street full-time. She would remain in the series until 1996, earning a reported annual salary of ¬£90,000. Two years into the role, she experienced a 14-month nervous breakdown but did not confide in anyone besides her close family or take any time off work, which in retrospect she deemed \\"the worst thing [she] could have done. During the worst part of her experience Lancashire described herself as \\"hysterical at the thought of getting out of bed\\". Her mother Hilda forced her to seek medical assistance for her condition, which Lancashire states \\"gave me my life back\\", her twenties having been \\"a write-off\\". Lancashire felt her first marriage had also contributed to her unhappiness; in 2001, she stated that though her marriage lasted ten years, it \\"was 10 years longer than it should have done\\". In 1995 she separated from Hargreaves; the pair would ultimately later divorce. She described leaving her marriage as a \\"cleansing experience\\" and a \\"renaissance\\"; one that enabled her to rediscover her sense of identity. Other steps that Lancashire took to combat her depression included remaining single for five years, attending therapy sessions, and taking prescriptions of the anti-depressant drug Paroxetine. In December 1995 Lancashire starred in the spin-off straight-to-video film Coronation Street ‚Äì The Cruise, a 75-minute special detailing Raquel and Curly's honeymoon. The special was advertised as being exclusive to video, and 750,000 copies were sold, to the value of ¬£10 million. Lancashire departed Coronation Street in 1996 due to her heavy work schedule and desire to pursue other projects. She had also tired of the fame the role brought her, shying away from personal appearances and interviews with television magazines. Her final scenes attracted 20 million viewers. Lancashire's performance in the role saw her nominated in the Most Popular Actress category at the 2nd National Television Awards in October 1996. Lancashire's next role was district nurse Ruth Goddard in the ITV drama series Where the Heart Is, which began airing in 1997. Also in 1997 she filmed a situation comedy for the BBC, Bloomin' Marvellous, in which she played Liz, one half of an argumentative married couple trying for a baby. However, due to poor viewing figures and a damning critical response the sitcom was not renewed. Regarding the negative reception to the series, her co-star Clive Mantle sarcastically remarked \\"I've seen murderers and rapists get a better press than we did\\". Lancashire continued to star as Ruth Goddard in Where the Heart Is for its second and third series in 1998 and 1999. In 1998 she was nominated for her second National Television Award for Most Popular Actress. In February 1999 she made a guest appearance in the British dark comedy anthology series Murder Most Horrid alongside comedian Dawn French. The pair played two yachtswoman whose journey ends with fatal repercussions. In April it was announced that Lancashire would be quitting Where the Heart Is, despite an offered pay rise. At the time, Where the Heart is was the third most popular drama on British Television, regularly attracting 12 million viewers. Lancashire's decision was reportedly influenced by the series filming away from home, and a fear that remaining in the series long term would harm her career. In January 2000 she expanded on her decision, stating that Ruth \\"was too chocolate-boxy, no longer a challenge\\". On 1 January 2000, Lancashire returned to Coronation Street for 2 episodes in which Raquel asks Curly for a divorce. Lancashire felt it was an apt time to return, as she was now a more confident actress and wanted to portray Raquel again before she aged significantly. The series' producer at the time, Jane Macnaught, deemed Raquel one of Coronation Street most popular ever characters and her return an opportunity for her \\"millions of fans\\" to learn what had become of her. Lancashire and Kennedy were the sole actors in the episode, the first to feature just two characters. From late January, Lancashire appeared as factory employee Yvonne Kolakowski, a widow with a dysfunctional personal life, in the BBC One drama series Clocking Off. Lancashire used her own experiences as a single mother in her characterisation. In March, she played actress Coral Atkins in the television film Seeing Red. Lancashire found shooting the drama, which detailed Atkins' decision to quit her acting career in order to set up a care home for abused children, \\"mentally draining\\". Lancashire then spent eight weeks filming the BBC One legal sitcom Chambers in which she played \\"ambitious\\" and \\"bigoted\\" barrister Ruth Quirke. The series was aired from June 2000. Lancashire's final role in 2000 was in the two-part drama thriller My Fragile Heart. Lancashire's output in 2000 earned her several awards. She was voted best actress at the TV Quick Awards in September 2000 for her roles in Clocking Off and Seeing Red, and in October was voted Most Popular Actress at the 6th National Television Awards for Seeing Red. In March 2001 she was named Drama Performer of the Year by the Television and Radio Industries Club, with mention of her work in Clocking Off and Seeing Red. Life and career (21st century) =\\"Golden Handcuffs\\" contract= Peter Salmon, pictured in 2012 Following Lancashire's success in connecting with a television audience, ITV sought to secure her exclusively to their network in a two-year golden handcuffs deal, which was finalised in July 2000. Lancashire became the first actress to be given such a contract with ITV. The deal, worth ¬£1.3 million, made Lancashire the highest-paid actress in British Television. Discussing the exclusive signing ITV controller of drama Nick Elliott identified Lancashire as being someone with \\"a great range [who] creates a tremendous empathy with an audience\\". He also admitted that heavy interest in Lancashire from the BBC had been a factor in giving her the contract, and blocking her from working with other networks. Her last role on BBC One during this period was comedy drama Gentleman's Relish, an adaptation of the Miles Gibson novel Kingdom Swann. The television film, which aired on New Year's Day 2001, was Lancashire's first in the costume drama genre; she played a housekeeper harbouring romantic feelings for her employer (Billy Connolly). Her first role under her new contract with ITV was the six-part drama The Glass opposite John Thaw. The series, which aired between May and June 2001 saw Lancashire star as a saleswoman for a double-glazing company who ends up caught in a love triangle with her boss and his nephew. In August 2001, Lancashire married television executive Peter Salmon, in a low-key ceremony held at Langar Hall, Nottinghamshire. Salmon had proposed to Lancashire in New York during a holiday at Easter time 2001. The two began a romantic relationship in the summer of 2000, though they had first met several years earlier whilst she was portraying Raquel on Coronation Street and he was employed by Granada Studios, which produces the soap opera. In October Lancashire starred in an adaptation of the Michelle Magorian novel Back Home as Peggy Dickinson, a woman adjusting to life in post-war Britain after having been separated from her family during the war. In March 2002 Lancashire received an Honorary Master of Arts degree from Salford University. In April, she starred in two-part psychological thriller The Cry, which she described as her \\"most naked role yet\\". She played a social worker grieving her second still-born child who is determined to protect a baby she perceives to be at risk of abuse. Lancashire drew on her own experiences of clinical depression in her depiction of her character's mentality. Her performance saw her awarded with a Golden Nymph award for Best Performance by an Actress in a Mini-Series at the Monte-Carlo Television Festival. In April it was reported that Lancashire had been lined up to play the lead role in comedy drama Life Begins, which creator Mike Bullen had written with Lancashire in mind. However, by June, Lancashire had exited the drama, unwilling to commit to a potentially long running series. Later that month BBC News and newspaper The Guardian reported that Lancashire had exited her exclusive deal with ITV, which would not be renewed after it expired in the autumn. The decision was reportedly influenced by Lancashire's desire to reduce her workload and to have the freedom to take on other roles. In September 2002 she appeared in a two-part crime drama pilot, Rose and Maloney, as legal investigator Rose Linden. On 22 December she appeared in the television movie Birthday Girl as Rachel Jones, who plans a party to celebrate being in remission from a serious illness, only to discover that the disease has returned. Lancashire's final role under her ITV contract was Gertrude Morel in an adaptation of D.H. Lawrence's 1913 novel Sons and Lovers, airing in January 2003. The portrayal ‚Äìher first of a mother with adult children‚Äì followed Gertrude's transformation from a young bride into a fifty-something woman ravaged by her life experiences of poverty and domestic abuse. Lancashire re-read the novel several times prior to filming, and identified with the themes of filial and marital relationships she had been unable to appreciate as a GCSE student. The miniseries gave her a sense of conviction in her career path, stating ahead of the broadcast in 2002: \\"whatever the reason I do what I do, I felt I had come to a point where I could stop searching after this\\". Reviewing the serial Paul Hoggart of The Times wrote that Lancashire \\"steals the show\\" with a \\"performance of immense subtlety and quiet strength, proof, if we still needed it, that she has matured into a terrific actress.\\" Conversely Andrew Billen, writing in New Statesman, wrote that \\"Sarah Lancashire was no revelation at all\\", purely because she had \\"long since proved herself a formidable actress\\". = Subsequent projects (2004‚Äì2012) = Lancashire portrayed Angela Cannings (pictured) in the 2005 television film Cherished, a dramatisation of the activist's bereavement and subsequent wrongful imprisonment While pregnant with her third child, Lancashire began an 18-month career break, the longest of her working life. In April 2003, Lancashire gave birth to her third son, Joseph. Lancashire's first job after returning to work was her directorial debut on an episode of the BBC One anthology series The Afternoon Play. For \\"Viva Las Blackpool\\" she was given the Best Newcomer Award (sponsored by BBC Birmingham) at the Birmingham Screen Festival and the Best New Talent Award at the Royal Television Society (Midlands) awards in 2004. The venture also earned her first British Academy Television Awards nomination in 2005 for Best new Director of Fiction. Lancashire next filmed three two-part stories for Rose and Maloney, following on from the pilot episode in 2002. The delay between shooting for the pilot and its follow-up was a result of Lancashire's career break and problems reconciling her availability with that of co-star Phil Davis. In 2005 Lancashire starred in The Rotters' Club as a housewife in 1970s Birmingham. Also in 2005 she appeared in the BBC television film Cherished as Angela Cannings, a British woman who was wrongfully convicted of killing her two baby sons. Lancashire was proud to be involved with the project, having greatly admired Cannings strength of character during her ordeal, and being able to relate to her sense of anguish as a parent. In December 2005, Lancashire returned to West End theatre, taking on the role of Miss Adelaide in the Donmar Warehouse production of Guys and Dolls at the Piccadilly Theatre. Lancashire was due to stay with the production until March 2006, but due to a severe chest infection made her last appearance on 4 January. In 2006 Lancashire accepted an invitation to write a short autobiographical entry in Who's Who. Lancashire's only television acting role in 2006 was as house-wife and cake-maker Elaine in the BBC comedy drama Angel Cake. In November she presented an episode of the Five documentary series Disappearing Britain in which she interviewed people with memories of Wakes Week holidays in Blackpool during the early 20th century. In February 2007 she made an appearance in the E4 teen drama series Skins. This was followed by a leading role in the BBC Two television drama Sex, the City and Me as solicitor Ruth Gilbert. In October, Lancashire appeared in her first feature film, David Nicholls' And When Did You Last See Your Father? in which she played aunt Beaty. In December, she played the supporting role of Mrs Corney in the BBC's 2007 adaption of Charles Dickens' 1838 novel Oliver Twist. Whilst ambivalent about the serial as a whole, The Daily Mirrors Jane Simon singled Lancashire out for praise stating that she \\"really sets the tone for the cold, unfeeling world into which orphaned Oliver is born.\\" Between 2008 and 2011 Lancashire narrated the BBC One series Lark Rise to Candleford, a costume drama based on Flora Thompson's memoir of her Oxfordshire childhood in the 1880s. In April, she appeared in the opening episode of the 2008 series of Doctor Who, as \\"an enigmatic and powerful businesswoman\\" who Lancashire described as a \\"warped Mary Poppins\\". She was amongst a number of high-profile actors the series' executive producer Russell T Davies secured for the fourth series of the science-fiction drama as part of his intention to make it \\"bigger and blowsier\\". In 2009, Lancashire starred in the BBC One musical drama series All the Small Things. She played Esther Caddick, a full-time mother who starts a choir after her husband leaves her for a more glamorous woman. In July that year the actress was made an honorary Doctor of Letters by the University of Huddersfield. Following this, she reunited with director Coky Giedroyc, who had directed her in Oliver Twist, for a 2009 television adaptation of Emily Bront√´'s 1847 novel Wuthering Heights in which she played housekeeper Nelly Dean. In 2010 Lancashire portrayed Rosemary Nicholls, mother of a murder victim, in the three-part BBC drama Five Daughters; a depiction of the Ipswich serial murders from the perspective of the victims and their families. Though the pair never met, Lancashire felt it important to receive Nicholls consent before filming, and was later \\"humbled\\" and \\"relieved\\" to receive a feedback letter thanking her for her portrayal. Also in 2010 she guest-starred in the police drama series Inspector George Gently. The Novello Theatre, where Lancashire originated the role of Joyce Chilvers in Betty Blue Eyes in 2011 In March 2011 Lancashire began starring in a new Cameron Mackintosh musical, Betty Blue Eyes, at the Novello Theatre. In the production, a loose adaptation of the 1984 film A Private Function, she starred as Joyce Chilvers, an aspirational housewife who Lancashire describes as \\"brittle\\" and \\"capricious\\". Despite positive reviews the musical closed in London on 24 September 2011, after a run of just six months. For her performance Lancashire was nominated for the Laurence Olivier Award for Best Actress in a Musical. In 2012 she appeared as lady's maid Miss Whisset in the penultimate episode of the 2010 revival of Upstairs Downstairs. In September 2012 Lancashire began appearing as Head of Ladieswear Miss Audrey in the six-part series The Paradise set in a department store in Northern England in the late 19th century. Lancashire described her character as \\"a true archetypal spinster\\" who has long denied herself a romantic life and who begins to feel undermined by a younger colleague. =Last Tango in Halifax and Happy Valley= Between November 2012 and December 2016 Lancashire appeared opposite Anne Reid and Derek Jacobi in the BBC drama series Last Tango in Halifax. In the series she plays Caroline, an Oxford-educated headmistress who feels that her mother's second marriage gives her \\"permission\\" to be herself. Caroline's same-sex relationship with a fellow teacher resulted in Lancashire receiving more fan mail than for any other role, largely from women telling her that the series had helped them to come out. Due to the under-representation of gay characters in television, Lancashire felt it particularly important that Caroline's experience would not be depicted inaccurately. In her portrayal she opted to focus on the \\"humanity\\" of the character, rather than her sexuality. Filming of the second series clashed with filming of the second series of The Paradise, which necessitated Lancashire leaving The Paradise partway through its second series. For her role as Caroline she was nominated for the British Academy Television Award for Best Supporting Actress in both 2013 and 2014, winning in 2014. At the 2015 Hay Festival Lancashire stated that of all the roles she has taken on in her career Caroline is the one she is most proud of, citing the \\"extraordinary impact\\" of the character. After airing three full series, Last Tango in Halifax returned for a fourth series in December 2016, consisting of two episodes which were promoted as \\"Christmas Specials\\", and also for a fifth series in 2020. In 2014, Lancashire re-united with Last Tango in Halifax writer Sally Wainwright on the crime drama Happy Valley. Wainwright was keen to write another role for Lancashire after being \\"blown away\\" by her performances in Last Tango in Halifax. Lancashire portrays single-grandparent Catherine Cawood, a police sergeant still dealing with the aftermath of her daughter's rape, and subsequent suicide, eight years earlier. Mark Lawson of The Guardian identified the performance as a career best for Lancashire, stating that she perfectly conveyed \\"the script's demandingly contradictory notes of tragedy, comedy, love, guilt, weakness and courage\\". For this role she earned the TV Choice Award for Best Actress in 2014, and the Royal Television Programme Award for Best Actress in 2015. In September 2014 the Radio Times listed her as one of the thirty most powerful women in British television and radio. In April 2015 she received her fourth BAFTA television nomination, her first in the Best Actress category. In June 2015 she was named Best Actress in a Drama Series at the Monte Carlo Television Festival. Despite Lancashire's concerns regarding the decision to extend the story told in Happy Valley, Wainwright's \\"genuine\\" storytelling and \\"integrity\\" convinced her to return for a second series, which aired in 2016. Lancashire stated that she found the second series as \\"emotionally brutal\\" as the first; disclosing to The Independent that she inhabited Catherine's emotional pain for the entirety of the shoot. Whilst promoting the second series, Lancashire also refuted criticism about the level of violence towards women in the series, stating she \\"would never condone anything which [she] thought was salacious, titillating, or gratuitous\\" and that Catherine's experience represented an \\"absolutely honest portrayal of what a female police officer can be subjected to\\". For her role in the second series of Happy Valley, Lancashire won the 2017 National Television Award for Best Dramatic Performance, and the BAFTA TV award for Best Actress. =2015‚Äìpresent= In March 2015 Lancashire began filming a television adaptation of Ronald Harwoods 1980 play The Dresser. In the teleplay, which aired in October 2015, Lancashire portrayed stage manager Madge, whose unrequited love for 'Sir' (Anthony Hopkins), the head of a repertory theatre company, pits her at odds with his dresser and confidant, Norman (Ian McKellen). Lancashire described The Dresser as \\"the greatest piece ever written about actors\\" and found both working with and observing McKellen and Hopkins ‚Äì \\"two of the greatest actors ever\\" ‚Äì an extraordinary experience. Following an airing on the American premium cable channel Starz in 2016, Lancashire was nominated for the 2016 Critics' Choice Television Award for Best Supporting Actress in a Movie or Miniseries Lancashire played Mrs Pike in the 2016 feature film Dad's Army, based on the situation comedy series of the same name. In early 2017, she began voicing the character of \\"Headmonstress\\" Mrs Twirlyhorn in the animated pre-school series School of Roars, which airs on Cbeebies. Lancashire was due to appear opposite Martin Freeman in Labour of Love, a political comedy by James Graham, at the No√´l Coward Theatre in late 2017 but pulled out on 1 September \\"on doctor's advice\\" and was replaced by Tamsin Greig. In 2018 she starred as Miriam ‚Äì billed as an \\"experienced, no-nonsense social worker\\" ‚Äì in Kiri, a four-part drama series written by Jack Thorne, co-produced by Channel 4 and the American on-demand service Hulu. The miniseries centres on a black girl living with a white foster couple who is murdered on a visit to her family, putting Miriam and the social services under scrutiny. Filmography Awards and nominations Lancashire was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2017 Birthday Honours for services to drama.

Known as the man with the Midas touch, he amassed a sizable fortune before the age of 40. An early advocate of deep mining, Hammond was given complete charge of Cecil Rhodes' mines in South Africa and made each undertaking a financial success. He was a main force planning and executing the Jameson Raid in 1895. It was a fiasco and Hammond, along with the other leaders of the Johannesburg Reform Committee, was arrested and sentenced to death. The Reform Committee leaders were released after paying large fines, but like many of the leaders, Hammond escaped Africa for good. He returned to the United States, became a close friend of President William Howard Taft, and was appointed a special ambassador. At the same time, he continued to develop mines in Mexico and California and, in 1923, he made another fortune while drilling for oil with the Burnham Exploration Company. His son, John Hays Hammond, Jr., patented over 400 inventions, and is widely regarded as the father of radio control. Early life Hammond was the son of Major Richard Pindell Hammond, a West Point graduate who fought in the Mexican War, and Sarah, daughter of Harmon Hays and his wife, n√©e Elizabeth Cage. Sarah was sister to Captain John Coffee Hays of the Texas Rangers, and had formerly been married to Calvin Lea. The family moved in 1849 to California to prospect in the California gold rush, and young John was born in San Francisco. After an adventuresome boyhood in the American Old West, Hammond went East to attend the Sheffield Scientific School of Yale University, where he earned a Bachelor of Philosophy in 1876, and later attended the Royal School of Mines, Freiberg, Germany, 1876‚Äì1879, and there he met his wife-to- be, Natalie Harris. Mining career Hammond took his first mining job as a special expert for the US Geological Survey 1879-1880 in Washington, DC. He returned to California in 1881 to work for Senator George Hearst, the mining magnate and father of William Randolph Hearst. In 1882, he was sent to hostile country in Mexico, near Sonora, to become superintendent of Minas Nuevas. When a revolution broken out, Hammond barricaded his family in a small house and fought off the attacking guerrillas. From 1884-1893, Hammond worked in San Francisco as a consulting engineer for Union Iron Works, Central Pacific Railway and Southern Pacific Railway. In 1893, Hammond left for South Africa to investigate the gold mines in Transvaal for the Barnato Brothers. In 1894, he joined the British South Africa Company to work with Cecil Rhodes and opened mines in the Rand, in Mashonaland (territory which became Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe). In 1895, he was managing Rhodes' property in Transvaal, with headquarters at Johannesburg, South Africa. An early advocate of deep-level mining, Hammond was given complete charge of Rhodes' gold and diamond mines and made each undertaking a financial success. While working for Rhodes, he made his worldwide reputation as an engineer. He continued to work for Rhodes until 1899, but events in Africa would go on to change Hammond's life forever. =Reform Committee of Transvaal= Natalie Harris Hammond When Hammond arrived in the Transvaal, the political situation was tense. The gold rush had brought in a considerable foreign population of workers, chiefly British and American, whom the Boers referred to as \\"Uitlanders\\" (foreigners). These immigrants, manipulated by Rhodes, formed a Reform Committee headed by Colonel Frank Rhodes (brother of Cecil), Hammond, and others. They demanded a stable constitution, a fair franchise law, an independent judiciary, a better educational system, and charged that the Government under President Paul Kruger had made promises, but failed to keep them. These demands were orchestrated by Rhodes, knowing that Kruger would never accede to them, justifying subsequent intervention by the British government to protect the supposed interests of British miners, the vast majority of whom had no desire to vote or settle in the Transvaal. Civility finally collapsed when Leander Starr Jameson, the British South Africa Company's Administrator General for Matabeleland, prematurely invaded the Transvaal with 1 500 troops in the ill- fated Jameson Raid and was captured by the Boers in December 1895. Shortly thereafter, the Boer government arrested Hammond and most of members of the Reform Committee and kept them in deplorable conditions. The U.S. Senate petitioned President Kruger for clemency. The Reform Committee case was heard in April. Hammond, Lionel Phillips, George Farrar, Frank Rhodes and Percy Fitzpatrick, all of whom had signed an incriminating document found with Jameson's raiders, were sentenced to be hanged, but Kruger commuted the sentence the next day. For the next few weeks, Hammond and the others were kept in jail under deplorable conditions. In May it was announced that they would spend 15 years in prison, but by mid-June Kruger commuted the sentences of all, Hammond and the other lesser figures each paying a ‚Ç§2,000 fine. The ringleaders had been shipped off to London to be dealt with by the imperial Government, paying fines of ‚Ç§25,000 each. All fines, amounting to some ‚Ç§300,000, were paid by Rhodes. Shortly hereafter, Hammond left for England. =Return to United States= Former residence of John Hays Hammond in Washington, D.C. About 1900, the now-famous Hammond moved to the U.S. and reported on mining properties in the U.S. and Mexico. He reported on the value of the Camp Bird Mine in Colorado, pursuant to its sale in 1902. His report on Winfield Scott Stratton's Independence mine, also in Colorado, and then being floated on the London market, revealed that the ore reserves had been greatly overvalued, and burst the stock bubble. He became a professor of mining engineering at Yale University 1902-1909, and from 1903‚Äì1907, he was employed by Daniel Guggenheim as a highly paid general manager and consulting engineer for the Guggenheim Exploration Company (Guggenex). Hammond's five-year contract included a $250,000 base salary and \\"an interest from each property that he brought in to Guggenex.\\" He earned $1.2 million in the first year alone. He employed Pope Yeatman, his eventual successor at Guggenex, and Alfred Chester Beatty. = Politics = In 1907, Hammond became the first president of the Rocky Mountain Club and he remained president of the club until it disbanded in 1928. Hammond was also active in the Republican Party and he became a close friend of President William Howard Taft whom he had known since his student days at Yale. In early 1908 it was announced that Hammond was a candidate for Vice-President for the Republican party, but he did not receive many delegates at the national convention. Nevertheless, he became acquainted with many prominent politicians at the convention and became the president of the League of Republican Clubs. He moved to Washington to be closer to the President and he accompanied President Taft on many excursions. In 1911, Taft then sent him to the coronation of George V as a special U.S. Ambassador, and twice sent him to assist Nicholas II of Russia on irrigation and other engineering problems. In addition to Taft, Hammond also befriended Presidents Grant, Hayes, Roosevelt, and Coolidge. Hammond became chairman of the U.S. Coal Commission, 1922-1923. His close friendship and longtime business associations with Frederick Russell Burnham, the highly decorated Scout who he knew from Africa, led Hammond to become a wealthy oil man when Burnham Exploration Company struck oil at Dominguez Oil Field, near Carson, California, in 1923.  May 1926: A Celebration of Hammond  thumb In May 1926, an organization called \\"The Company of Friends of John Hays Hammond\\" sponsored eleven dinners around the world (Manhattan, San Francisco, London, Paris, Tokyo, Manila, etc.) in honor of Hammond. Over 10,000 people wrote tributes to Hammond, including: Hearst whose father gave him his first job, Woolf Barnato whose father (Barney Barnato) took him to South Africa, Sir Lionel Phillips who was condemned to death with him, the Guggenheims who employed him at a fabulous salary, former President Taft who offered him an ambassador position, and President Calvin Coolidge who consulted with him on the coal situation. The event was so extraordinary that 'Time magazine put Hammond on the cover of the May 10, 1926 issue and ran a biographical sketch on him called \\"Unique\\". He died of coronary occlusion on June 8, 1936, in Gloucester, Massachusetts. Family John Hays Hammond Jr. & Sr., c. 1922 He married Natalie Harris (1859 ‚Äì 1931), of Harrisville, Mississippi (40 miles SSW south of the state capital, Jackson) on January 1, 1881, in Hancock, Maryland. Together they had four sons and one daughter: Harris Hays Hammond (1881 - 1969), a financier, became president of Dominguez Oil Fields Company, which earned him $2 million in 1936, and president of Laughlin Filter Corporation, a small New Jersey company which manufactures centrifuges. In 1928, he and Anthony \\"Tony\\" Joseph Drexel Biddle Jr. were among the directors of Acoustic Products Co., which later became Sonora Products Corp. of America. John Hays Hammond, Jr. (1888 - 1965) was born in San Francisco, California. In 1893 he moved with his family to South Africa, and five years later the family moved to England. The family returned to the United States in 1900, and Hammond attended Lawrenceville School, started inventing, and went on to study at the Sheffield School of Yale University, graduating in 1910. He established the Hammond Radio Research Corporation in 1911 and eventually developed a radio controlled torpedo system for the navy, which he successfully demonstrated in 1918. Between 1926 and 1929, he built a medieval-style castle in Gloucester, Massachusetts. Natalie Hays Hammond (1904 ‚Äì 1985) was born in Lakewood, New Jersey. Her estate in North Salem, New York was converted into the Hammond Museum & Japanese Stroll Garden in 1957. Nathaniel Harris Hammond (1902 - 1907) and Richard Pindle Hammond (1896 ‚Äì 1980), composer, were the two other children. John Hays Hammond died in 1936 at the age of 81 in an easy chair in his showplace at Gloucester, Massachusetts. He left an estate estimated at $2.5 million, mostly to his four surviving children: inventor John Hays Hammond Jr.; artist Natalie Hays Hammond; composer Richard Pindle Hammond; and financier Harris Hays Hammond.

It has been pointed out by different books and writers showing Kimera as the Only son of Prince Kalemera. This is not true. Kimera was a twin and his twin brother was Kato Kibi Kaganda, who became a King himself. He conquered his own Kingdom in Kiziba, current day Tanzania. They could not rule Buganda together, thus he went to Sesse, came back to Buganda and went south. Their mother was Lady Wannyana, the supposed chief wife of King Winyi I of Bunyoro. Influence on Buganda Culture Kimera made the journey to Buganda accompanied by his mother and the family of Katumba (Nkima clan), his adoptive father. On reaching Buganda, Katumba was appointed Mugema, hereditary head of the Nkima (monkey) clan. The Mugema plays a significant role in Buganda culture, notably performing the investiture of the new Kabaka until the reign of Mutebi I.J. Roscoe, The Baganda, 1911, pp.215.

In 1869, his remains were exhumed and re-buried at Lunnyo, near the city of Entebbe, close to where the present Uganda State House is located.

He received the \\"Mia Martini\\" Critics Award at the Sanremo Music Festival in 2000 and in 2012, with the songs \\"Replay\\" and \\"Un pallone\\", respectively. His best known songs also include \\"Giudizi universali\\", released in 1997 and certified in 2017 as a platinum-selling single by the Federation of the Italian Music Industry, and \\"Spaccacuore\\", which was later covered by Italian singer Laura Pausini. In 2000, Bersani recorded the soundtrack of the film Chiedimi se sono felice, by Aldo, Giovanni e Giacomo. In 2007, he won the Amnesty International Italy \\"Voci per la liberta\\" Award for \\"Occhiali rotti\\", a song included in his album L'aldiqua (2006) and written in memory of journalist Enzo Baldoni. Biography =1970‚Äì1991: Childhood and early beginnings= Samuele Bersani was born on 1 October 1970 in Rimini, in the Emilia-Romagna region of Italy. His father was a music teacher, while his mother was an employee, and she also became the vice-major of Cattolica, the town in which he grew up. He studied at the classical lyceum, but he left school a few months before his \\"maturity exam\\". While he was a teenager, Bersani played in several local bands and took part in local singing competitions. In 1991, he met Italian singer-songwriter Lucio Dalla before a concert Dalla was going to give in San Benedetto del Tronto, in Central Italy. Bersani asked Dalla to listen to a recording of his original song \\"Il mostro\\", and a few minutes later Dalla's producer, Renzo Cremonini, told him to open the concert performing the song. Bersani was then chosen as the opening act for the remaining concerts of Dalla's Cambio tour. =1992‚Äì1996: C'hanno preso tutto and Freak= Bersani's debut album, C'hanno preso tutto, was released in November 1992. The album included the song \\"Il mostro\\", as well as the single \\"Chiccho e Spillo\\", which allowed Bersani to receive media attention, becoming a radio hit and supporting sales of the album, which sold more than 20,000 copies in Italy. In 1995, Bersani released his second album, Freak. The album's lead single, \\"Freak\\", was released in February of the same year, but some Italian radio stations decided not to air it as a consequence of a line referring both to the Italian conservative coalition and to the Italian Communist Party, which was considered a violation of the \\"par condicio law\\", which introduced fees for those stations giving airplay to songs including political messages during the electoral campaign preceding the Italian regional elections. As a consequence, Bersani's label decided to anticipate the release of the second single from the album, \\"Spaccacuore\\". Both \\"Freak\\" and \\"Spaccacuore\\" were later performed by Bersani during the itinerant television show Festivalbar, during the summer of 1995. The album was a commercial success, and it was certified platinum, selling more than 130,000 copies in Italy.

Early life and career Wilcox was born in Wayne County, North Carolina. One of his brothers, John Allen Wilcox, would later serve in the First Confederate Congress as a representative from Texas. The family moved to Tipton County, Tennessee, when Cadmus was only two years old. He was raised and educated in Tennessee, studying at Cumberland College before being nominated to the United States Military Academy at West Point from the Memphis district. He graduated in 1846, standing 54th out of 59 cadets, and was brevetted a second lieutenant in the 4th U.S. Infantry on July 1.Eicher, p. 568. Among his West Point classmates were future Civil War generals George B. McClellan and Thomas J. Jackson. Wilcox as US Army second lieutenant With the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War already underway, Wilcox joined the 4th Infantry in the Mexican city of Monterrey in 1847. He was appointed as an aide to Maj. Gen. John A. Quitman, acting as his adjutant at the Battle of Veracruz and the Battle of Cerro Gordo. For gallant conduct at the Battle of Chapultepec, in action at the Bel√©n Gate, and the Battle for Mexico City, Wilcox was appointed a brevet first lieutenant on September 13. After the war with Mexico ended, Wilcox was promoted to first lieutenant on August 24, 1851. In the autumn of 1852, Wilcox was ordered back to West Point to serve as assistant instructor of military tactics, a position he held until the summer of 1857, when, on account of failing health, he was sent to Europe on a twelve-month furlough. On his return to West Point, he published a manual on rifles and rifle firing, which became the standard textbook on the subject. Wilcox also translated and published a work on infantry evolution as practiced in the Austrian Army. He was ordered to New Mexico Territory in 1860, and was promoted to the rank of captain in the 4th Infantry on December 20. Civil War service While serving in the New Mexico Territory in June 1861, Wilcox learned of the secession of Tennessee. After tendering his resignation from the U.S. Army (accepted on June 8) he traveled to Richmond, Virginia, where he was commissioned a captain of artillery in the Confederate Army on March 16. He was later promoted to colonel and given command of the 9th Alabama Infantry Regiment on July 9. Wilcox joined Brig. Gen. Joseph E. Johnston's Army of the Shenandoah with his regiment on July 16, and marched to Manassas to reinforce Brig. Gen. P.G.T. Beauregard's Army of the Potomac just before the First Battle of Bull Run on July 21. On October 21, he was promoted to brigadier general and placed in command of a brigade comprising the 3rd Alabama, 1st Mississippi, and 1st Virginia infantry regiments along with an artillery battery. The brigade was assigned to Maj. Gen. James Longstreet's division of the First Corps, Army of Northern Virginia. During the 1862 Peninsula Campaign, Wilcox played a prominent role at the Battle of Williamsburg on May 5. At the 1862 Battle of Seven Pines, Wilcox commanded two brigades, and at Battle of Gaines' Mill on June 27 he led three--his own, Featherston's, and Pryor's. On June 30 at the Battle of Glendale during the Seven Days Battles, nearly every regimental officer in Wilcox's command was killed, and Wilcox himself had his clothing pierced by six bullets, but he somehow escaped injury. The loss in Wilcox's brigade was heavier in the Seven Days Battles than of any other brigade in Longstreet's division. After Longstreet was elevated to corps command, Wilcox got half of his division. He led it to Second Bull Run, but was held in reserve and saw no serious action. In the Maryland Campaign, Wilcox was returned to brigade command and his division merged with Richard H. Anderson's. He fell ill and spent the Battle of Antietam resting in Martinsburg, Virginia, leaving Colonel Alfred Cumming to command his brigade during that battle. As a part of the division of Maj. Gen. Richard H. Anderson at the Battle of Chancellorsville in May 1863, Wilcox's brigade was instrumental in delaying the Union VI Corps in its drive west from Fredericksburg, Virginia, slowing them at the Battle of Salem Church. Shortly after the battle, Wilcox and his brigade moved with Anderson's division to the newly created Third Corps, under Lt. Gen. A.P. Hill on May 30. =Gettysburg= Attack by Anderson's division, July 2 The Dash of Wilcox's Battery at Gettysburg, July 2, 1863 Wilcox and his command participated in the Battle of Gettysburg in the summer of 1863. On the battle's second day, July 2, his charge against a weakened Union line was met (and held off) by a suicidally brave countercharge from the 1st Minnesota Volunteer Infantry. On the third day of the battle, during Pickett's Charge, his brigade served as support on the right flank of the division of his West Point classmate, Maj. Gen. George Pickett. Heavy Union artillery fire, particularly from those guns on Cemetery Ridge under the command of Lt. Col. Freeman McGilvery, readily broke up Wilcox's assault, who ordered the brigade to withdraw. With the death of Dorsey Pender at Gettysburg, Wilcox was promoted to major general on August 3, 1863, and assigned command of Pender's division in Hill's Third Corps. Wilcox's new command consisted of Lane's North Carolina brigade, Thomas's Georgia brigade, McGowan's South Carolina brigade, and Scales's North Carolina brigade. For the rest of the war, Wilcox's Division saw heavy fighting, from the Overland Campaign through Appomattox Court House. During the final days of the Siege of Petersburg in 1865, Wilcox's last-ditch stand on April 2 at Fort Gregg helped delay the Union forces long enough for Longstreet to maneuver into position to cover the army's retreat to the west. Postbellum career Wilcox in later life After the close of the American Civil War, Wilcox was offered a command as a brigadier general in the Egyptian Army, but he declined it. In 1886 U.S. President Grover Cleveland appointed Wilcox as chief of the railroad division for the government at Washington, D.C. and he served in that capacity until his death. A lifelong bachelor, Wilcox cared for his brother's widow and small children following John Wilcox's sudden death in February 1865. Wilcox died at the age of sixty-six in Washington, D.C., and was buried there in Oak Hill Cemetery. His pallbearers included four former Confederate generals and four former Union generals, a token of his esteem.

It is the larger of Suriname's two international airports, the other being Zorg en Hoop with scheduled flights to Guyana, and is operated by Airport Management, Ltd./ NV Luchthavenbeheer. History =The early years= Prior to World War II, Zandery Airport was a Pan American World Airways (PAA) stop. In 1928 Pan American World Airways started mail flights from Miami to Paramaribo, the capital of the then Dutch colony Suriname. Pan American World Airways used Sikorsky S-38 amphibians. Rich and famous Americans, mostly aviators, visited Suriname. On 24 March 1934 female pilot Guggenheim and male pilot Russel Thaw had to make an emergency landing near the Nieuwe Haven, because they could not find Zanderij airfield. The Lockheed airplane was so severely damaged that it was shipped back to the USA. On 16 April 1934 female aviator Laura Ingalls landed in a single engine airplane, the Lockheed Air Express at Zanderij in the first solo flight around South America in a landplane. The KLM tri-motor Fokker F.XVIII, named the Snip (Snipe), made a trans-atlantic crossing from Amsterdam via Paramaribo to Cura√ßao, carrying mail. The trip of 12,200 km (more than 4,000 over water) landed 8 days after take-off from Schiphol, on 22 December 1934 at Hato Airport. Captain was J.J. Hongdong, co-pilot/navigator J.J. van Balkom, engineer L.D. Stolk, wireless operator S. v.d. Molen. The route was from Amsterdam via Marseille, Alicante, Casablanca, Cabo Verde, Paramaribo and Caracas. The SNIP landed at Zanderij Field on 20 December 1934 after a first trans-atlantic crossing of 3600 km, dubbed \\"the Christmas Mail-flight\\", directly from Porto Praia. However, the Snip flight did not inaugurate a regular KLM trans-Atlantic service. In January 1937 William Henry Vanderbilt III landed in a baby Clipper Sikorsky S-38 at Zanderij with wife and friends The Flying Hutchinsons. On 3 June 1937 aviation pioneer Amelia Earhart landed at Zanderij with a Lockheed Model 10 Electra at local time 2:38 P.M. The navigator was a retired PAA aviator Fred Noonan. This was on their second attempt of a \\"World Flight\\" en route from Miami to Natal and then transatlantic to Dakar, Senegal. They stayed overnight at the Palace Hotel in Paramaribo and left Zanderij again on Friday 4 June 1937 for Fortaleza, Brazil. One month later they disappeared over the central Pacific Ocean near Howland Island. On 16 March 1938 two pilots Whitney and Harmon made an emergency landing with their Beechcraft on an airstrip near the Eerste Rijweg. They could not find Zanderij Airfield. In 1938 the KLM started a weekly service between Paramaribo and Willemstad (Cura√ßao) with a twin engined Lockheed L-14 Super Electra able to carry 12 passengers and named MEEUW (PJ- AIM). Mail arrived much faster at Cura√ßao than with PAA, but the service was no commercial success. On 11 May 1939 The Flying Hutchinsons arrived at Zanderij in a twin engine Lockheed Electra, on their \\"family round-the-world global nations flight\\" which was broadcast on a radio series sponsored by Pepsi Cola.http://www.wingsacrossamerica.us/wasp/2007/HUTCHINSON.mp3 =Expansion during World War II by the US Armed Forces= After the fall of the Netherlands to German forces in 1940, the United States obtained military basing rights to the airport from the Netherlands government-in-exile in London. Suriname was then the world's principal source of bauxite (for aluminium production) and needed protection. The first American armed forces arrived at the airport on 30 November 1941 and expanded the facilities to be a transport base for sending Lend-Lease supplies to England via air routes across the South Atlantic Ocean. The runways were constructed by the US Corps of Engineers. They also built the road from Onverwacht to Zanderij which was completed in 1942. With the United States entry into the war in December 1941, the importance of Zandery Field increased drastically, becoming a major transport base on the South Atlantic route of Air Transport Command ferrying supplies and personnel to Freetown Airport, Sierra Leone and onwards to the European and African theaters of the war. In addition, antisubmarine patrols were flown from the airfield over the southern Caribbean and South Atlantic coastlines. Major United States Army Air Force (USAAF) units assigned to the airfield were: * 35th Bombardment Squadron (25th Bombardment Group) 1 November 1941 ‚Äì 7 October 1943 (B-25 Mitchell) : Detachment operated from: Atkinson Field, British Guiana, 1 November 1942 ‚Äì 7 October 1943 : Detachment operated from: Piarco Airport, Trinidad, 27 August-12 October 1943 * 99th Bombardment Squadron (9th Bombardment Group), 3 December 1941 ‚Äì 31 October 1942 (B-18 Bolo) *22nd Fighter Squadron (36th Fighter Group), 16 September 1942 ‚Äì 16 February 1943 (P-39 Airacobras, later P-47 Thunderbolts) *23d Antisubmarine Squadron (Trinidad Detachment, Antilles Air Command), 15 August ‚Äì December 1943 (A-29 Hudson) Just before the Pearl Harbor attack, on 3 December, the 99th Squadron was ordered to distant Zandery Field, Dutch Guiana (by way of Piarco Field, Trinidad) under an agreement with the Netherlands government-in- exile, by which the United States occupied the colony to protect bauxite mines. However, to the disappointment of the crews, the squadron had to leave its B-17 behind. It was, however, reinforced with additional B-18A Bolos, bringing squadron strength up to six aircraft. On 2 October 1942, a B-18A, piloted by Captain Howard Burhanna Jr. of the 99th Bomb Squadron, depth charged and sank the north of Cayenne, French Guiana.\\"B-18 sinks U-512.\\" uboat.net. Retrieved: 17 May 2010. At Zandery, the unit shuttled from Zandery to Atkinson Field, British Guiana and, by January 1942, had eight Curtiss P-40C Warhawks assigned. The P-40s were, in actuality, detached for airfield defense by the Trinidad Base Command, under which the 99th fell at the time.* The intensive flying of the first two months of the war soon took its toll, however, and by the end of February 1942, the Squadron was forced to report that it had but three B-18As operational at Zandery and that \\" ... none of them are airworthy at this time.\\" Apparently the unit was quickly reinforced and by 1 March strength was back up to six aircraft, and seven combat crews, all of whom had more than 12 months' experience. Operations from Zandery Field consisted of coastal, convoy and anti-submarine patrols until 31 October 1942. Just prior to which time the 4th Antisubmarine Squadron was attached to the Squadron between 9 and 16 October. At this point Antisubmarine Command took over the mission of the 99th and the men and aircraft of the squadron were reassigned. In the middle of World War II, on 2 November 1943, Her Royal Highness Princess Juliana visited Suriname from Canada. She landed at Zanderij with KLM airplane Lockheed Model 14 Super Electra PJ-AIM Meeuw as the first ever member of the Dutch Royal Family. After the landing of the Meeuw and escorting Dutch and US military planes, the Royal Princess was welcomed by governor Kielstra and inspected the guard of honour. With the end of World War II Zandery Airfield was reduced in scope to a skeleton staff. It was closed as a military facility on 30 April 1946. And on 22 October 1947 the Zandery Air Force Base was turned over to Dutch authorities which returned it to a civil airport. At that time the value of the facility was estimated to be 400,000 Surinamese guilders (S∆í). =Highlights in the years after the second World War= Passengers disembarking from a KLM airliner (foreground) at Johan Pengel Airport. The President of India and his entourage had arrived via the Air India airliner (background) moments prior. 19 June 2018 In March 1947 Alfredo de Los Rios landed with a 8-F Luscombe plane at Zanderij.https://www.suriname.nu/302ges/archi161.html He had traveled from the aircraft factory Dallas, Texas in the United States. In June 1959 pilots and missionaries Robert Price and Eugene Friesen arrived at Zandery with a single engine plane during Operation Grasshopper. They performed many medical treatment work in the interior and the Sipaliwini Savanna. On 3 March 1960 American president Dwight D. Eisenhower landed at Zanderij on board Air Force One operated by the U.S. Air Force with a Boeing 707 jetliner.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJAfjUOZiyI He was accompanied by Secretary of State Christian Herter. They left Suriname the same day. On 14 April 1967 American president Lyndon B. Johnson arrived during a rainstorm at Zanderij on board Air Force One, a Boeing 707 jet. Security was tight around Zanderij Airport. An agreement was signed by the Dutch government and the US to use Zanderij Airport for Military Airlift Command (MAC) usage. The USA paid US$22,000 for 400 landings per year. The crews stayed overnight at the Torarica Hotel. The North American X-15 NASA rocket-powered aircraft was on exhibition at Zanderij Airport for an Airshow held from 8 to 13 November 1963. On 7 April 1972, the first-ever Boeing 747 wide-body jetliner to land in South America, operated by KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, landed at Zanderij Airport, Suriname. With one of the longest runways in the Caribbean region, it served the Antonov An-225 Mriya ‚Äì the world‚Äôs largest cargo plane in 2010.https://nos.nl/artikel/137023-grootste-vliegtuig-ter-wereld-landt-in- suriname.htmlhttps://www.luchtvaartnieuws.nl/nieuws/categorie/3/airports/suriname- bezocht-door-grootste-vliegtuig-ter-wereld- videohttps://www.luchtvaartnieuws.nl/nieuws/categorie/2/airlines/antonov- an-225-op-missie-naar-zuid-amerika The airport has officially been named after the popular Surinamese politician and former Prime Minister of Suriname Johan Adolf Pengel, but is locally still common named Zanderij. This is parallel to the small village and savannah where it is situated. The airport now has one runway of approximately 3.5 km and reached an average of 500,000 passengers yearly in December 2019.https://www.asi-mag.com/the-route-to-one-million- passengers-increasing-security-efforts-in-suriname/This is achieved mainly on transatlantic flights between Paramaribo and Amsterdam from KLM, TUI fly Netherlands and Surinam Airways and some regional flights to Belem, Georgetown, Cayenne, Panama City and Miami by Trans Guyana Airways with their Beechcraft 1900D, Copa Airlines, Gol and Surinam Airways with their Boeing 737's. And also flights to the Caribbean islands destinations of Aruba, Curacao, Havana, Santiago de Cuba and Port of Spain accommodated by Caribbean Airlines, besides local companies Fly All Ways and Surinam Airways. Cargo flights are being performed by Amerijet International and Northern Air Cargo. =Future= The state will invest an extra US$70 million in expanding and modernizing the J.A. Pengel airport. US$28.5 million has been invested so far in the airport's modernization. For the time being, the arrival lounge, commercial center and parking lot have been handed over, while the runway has been repaved, the platform for planes has been renovated, the runway lights on the arrival side have been replaced and a backup system for electricity has been installed as well. This was all done prior to the 30 August 2013 UNASUR heads-of-state summit, hosted by Suriname. The project, which was prepared during the previous administration, is insufficient to actually turn the airport into an international hub. The departure and arrival lounges are currently apart from each other, but plans are to connect them in the future with airbridges. Lights were placed on the departure side of the runway, and the platform was expanded to accommodate more planes. The fire department barracks were moved to a more central location. Plans are to have the airbridges installed in the future, while the other matters were finished by 2017. The expansion of the airport will not only include the construction of a new terminal, but also the construction of a 2.7 km taxiway that will run parallel to the long 3.5 km runway. The total investment involves an amount of approximately US$205 million and approval for the loan agreement will be put forward to the National Assembly (DNA) of the Surinamese government by airport management mid-2019.http://unitednews.sr/27-kilometer-lange-taxibaan-voor- meer-en-snellere-afhandeling-vliegtuigen-jap-airport The new airport terminal with a much more capacious arrival and departure hall is planned for the near future, the result of investment from China, as the current airport terminal cannot facilitate an increasing number of passengers while the Johan Adolf Pengel International Airport is making a continuous effort in route development management to attract more airlines. Suriname is looking into new markets through bilateral and open-skies agreements with different countries.

By the time of the Russian Revolution, Chicherin was probably the most reputable legal philosopher and historian in Russia. Biography Chicherin was born in Tambov, where his noble ancestors had been residing for many centuries. In 1849, he matriculated from the law department of the Moscow University. On insistence of Dr. Timofey Granovsky, he continued to work in the university as a professor of Russian law. Together with his friend Konstantin Kavelin, he penned a comprehensive program of Russian liberalism which was published by Alexander Herzen in London. Chicherin was a great champion of Alexander II's reforms of the 1860s, hailing them as \\"the best monument of Russian legislation\\". He said the tsar had been: :called upon to execute one of the hardest tasks which can confront an autocratic ruler: to completely remodel the enormous state which had been entrusted to his care, to abolish an age-old order founded on slavery, to replace it with civic decency and freedom, to establish justice in a country which it never known the meaning of legality, to redesign the entire administration, to introduce freedom of the press in the context of untrammeled authority, to call new forces to life at every turn and set them on firm legal foundations, to put a repressed and humiliated society on its feet and to give at the chance to flex its muscles. Quoted in David Saunders, ‚Äò‚ÄôRussia in the age of reaction and reform: 1801‚Äì1881‚Äô‚Äô (1992) p. 213 Chicherin published the Regional Administration of 17th-century Russia in 1856, followed by the treatise On Popular Representation 10 years later. Chicherin's mature works, imbued with Hegel's thought as they were, advocated the constitutional monarchy as an ideal form of government for Russia. In 1868, Chicherin resigned his position at the university as a protest against government repressions and settled in his estate near Tambov. It was here that he wrote several volumes of his bulky History of Political Theories. Its magnificent literary style was acclaimed by such masters as Ivan Turgenev and Leo Tolstoy. Later, Chicherin returned to Moscow, where he was elected the city mayor in 1882. At that period, he supported Alexander's harsh measures in Poland and the tsar's struggle against radical revolutionaries. His speech at Alexander III's coronation in the Kremlin was interpreted as too liberal, however, and he was forced to resign. He spent his last years writing 4 volumes of memoirs and some books on chemistry, zoology, and geometry. The memoirs have been reprinted by Oriental Research Partners (Newtonville, MA) in 1974 with a new introduction on Chicherin's life by Prof. D. Hammer, Indiana University. The revolutionary Georgy Chicherin, later Soviet Foreign Minister, was Boris Chicherin's nephew. See also *List of Russian legal historians References *Hamburg, G. M.

He was mortally wounded at the Battle of Bristoe Station. He was transported for care to the University of Virginia, where the rooms on the Lawn all served as Confederate hospital rooms. He was placed in the same room (Room 33 West Lawn) where he lived many years earlier as a UVa Law student and later died in that room of his wounds. Early life and family Posey was born near Woodville, Mississippi, the fourth of eight children of planter John Brooke Posey and Elizabeth Screven Posey. He attended the common schools and then graduated from college in Jackson, Mississippi, before studying law at the University of Virginia. He returned to his family's plantation and later established a law practice in Woodville. He married Mary Collins in May 1840 and they had two sons, but his wife died only four years later. During the Mexican War, Posey was commissioned a first lieutenant in the 1st Mississippi Rifles, a volunteer regiment commanded by future Confederate President Jefferson Davis. He fought at the Battle of Buena Vista, where he was wounded. Returning to Woodville after the war, Posey married Jane White in February 1849. They would eventually have six children. U.S. President James Buchanan appointed Posey as the district attorney for southern Mississippi, a post he held when the state seceded from the Union. Civil War Posey recruited a local militia company, the Wilkinson Rifles, and enlisted them into Confederate service, serving as their captain from May 21, 1861. They became part of the 16th Mississippi, with Posey being selected as the regiment's first colonel on June 4.Eicher, p. 436. He and his men were transferred to the Eastern Theater in August 1861.Some sources, such as Clement A. Evans's Confederate Military History, volume 7, and Mark Boatner's The Civil War Dictionary, place Posey at First Bull Run and Ball's Bluff, but Freeman, vol. 2, p. 419, and Wert, p. 51, point out that Posey and his 16th Mississippi were unlikely to have appeared at either battle. Posey suffered a slight wound at the Battle of Cross Keys during Major General Stonewall Jackson's Valley Campaign in June 1862. His regiment fought in the Seven Days Battles with the Army of Northern Virginia under General Robert E. Lee.Wert, p. 51. He served as the temporary commander of the brigade of four Mississippi infantry regiments, commanded by Brigadier General Winfield S. Featherston, during the Northern Virginia Campaign and the Maryland Campaign. Posey's regiment fought at Fredericksburg in December 1862, successfully repelling a Union attack. Posey was promoted to brigadier general on January 18, 1863, to rank from November 2, 1862.Eicher, p. 797. The promotion is referred to as \\"special\\" because of political maneuvering required when Featherston was on medical leave and then returned unexpectedly. However, Featherston soon requested a transfer to his native Mississippi and Posey received permanent command of the brigade. See Freeman, vol. 2, pp. 263‚Äì67. The following May, Posey's brigade saw limited action at the Battle of Chancellorsville, maintaining a reserve position at Salem Church. During the army reorganization following Stonewall Jackson's death, Posey's brigade was assigned to Major General Richard H. Anderson's division of the Third (A.P. Hill's) Corps. During the Battle of Gettysburg in July, the brigade was part of Anderson's July 2 attack on Cemetery Ridge, conducting a \\"feeble, disjointed attack that was repulsed.\\" At the Battle of Bristoe Station on October 14, 1863, Posey was wounded in the thigh by a shell fragment. Although the wound was not outwardly serious, infection set in and he died a month later in Room 33 West Lawn at the University of Virginia, under the care of his good friend, Dr. John Davis, in Charlottesville, Virginia, in November. Posey was buried in the Davis family plot in the University of Virginia Cemetery. In memoriam The Carnot Posey Lodge #378 of the Masons was founded in 1875 and named in his memory.

Early life and college Jackson grew up in North Philadelphia and attended Roman Catholic High School. He averaged 18 points, 11 rebounds and two blocks while leading his team to the Catholic League championship in 1993, as well as winning the Alhambra Catholic Invitational Tournament. During the ACIT, he was commanding presence in the middle during Roman Catholic's run, including their defeat of perennial powerhouse DeMatha in the final. His performance earned him an All-Tournament Team nod, in spite of missing a dunk during the semi-final game that drew massive gasps, and then laughs, from the packed crowd. He committed to Virginia Commonwealth University where he played for one year. Prior to his sophomore year, Jackson transferred to Temple University, which was only five blocks from his childhood home in Philadelphia. He would redshirt his first year of eligibility, then play two seasons for the Owls. Jackson led the team in scoring and rebounding both seasons, helping them to a 40-14 record over those years and advanced to the NCAA Tournament both seasons. He gave up his fifth and final year of eligibility to declare for the NBA draft. Professional career Jackson was drafted in the second round (37th overall) of the 1997 NBA draft by the Golden State Warriors. Because he fell to the second round, Jackson chose to begin his pro career in Europe to make more money to support his mother and younger brother and better develop his skills before entering the NBA. He spent three years overseas playing for Tofa≈ü Bursa (Turkey), Lobos Caja Cantabria (Spain) and Cantabria Lobos (Spain), before returning to U.S. and debuting for the Warriors in 2000. Jackson made an immediate impact for the Warriors, leading all rookies in points and rebounds, while staying near the top of the list in field goal and free throw percentages. He was named to the All-Rookie team and finished third in Rookie of the Year voting. As a restricted free agent at the end of the season, Jackson signed a six-year, $24.375 million offer sheet with the Houston Rockets, which the Warriors matched. Despite Jackson's success, he was stuck behind Adonal Foyle, Danny Fortson and Erick Dampier on Golden State's depth chart, and voiced his displeasure with the Warriors front office matching the offer, rather than allowing him to get more playing time elsewhere. At the 2002 NBA trade deadline, the Warriors traded Jackson to the Minnesota Timberwolves, to play alongside Kevin Garnett.http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/nba/stories/2002-02-21-twolves- warriors-trade.htm On July 23, 2003, he was traded to his hometown Philadelphia 76ers in a four-team deal. He missed 57 games due to injury his first season in Philadelphia, but bounced back the next year leading the team in rebounds and being second in points, to help the Sixers return to the playoffs. During his time in Philadelphia, he split time between the Center and Power Forward positions. On August 9, 2005, Jackson was traded to the New Jersey Nets after a deal to bring in Shareef Abdur-Rahim from the Portland Trail Blazers to the Nets fell through. Before the 2005‚Äì06 trade deadline, he was traded by the Nets to the New Orleans Hornets. In 2007, he signed with the Greek League team Olympiacos, but was released after not fitting in the system of the team's new coach, Panagiotis Giannakis. In August, 2008, Jackson was signed by UNICS Kazan of the Russian Super League, and he announced his retirement shortly after signing for Obradoiro CAB in 2009. Post Playing Career Jackson now works as 76ers basketball analyst for NBC Sports Philadelphia.

Early years Dove was born in Liegnitz in the Kingdom of Prussia. Dove studied history, philosophy, and the natural sciences at the University of Breslau from 1821 until 1824. In 1824 he continued his education at the University of Berlin, finishing in 1826. In 1826, he became a Privatdozent and in 1828 a Professor extraordinarius at the University of K√∂nigsberg. In 1829, he moved to Berlin and taught at the Friedrich Wilhelm Gymnasium. In 1845 he became a Professor ordinarius at the Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universit√§t in Berlin, where he was elected rector in 1858‚Äì1859, and again in 1871‚Äì1872. In 1849 he also became the director of the Prussian Meteorological Institute. During his career he published more than 300 papers, some of which delved into experimental physics. He also had an important influence over the science of meteorology, and was considered by some to be a pioneer in this field; Dove's primary meteorological focus was in climatology, a field pioneered by Alexander von Humboldt. In 1828, Dove observed that tropical cyclones rotate counterclockwise in the Northern Hemisphere, but clockwise in the Southern. In 1839 he discovered the technique of binaural beats, whereby slightly different frequencies played separately to each ear produced a perception of interference beats at the same rate as would be physically created. He also studied the distribution of heat over the surface of the Earth, the effect of climate on the growth of plants, and was the first to measure the strength of an electric current in a wire induced by a collapsing magnetic field.

The results of a percolation test are required to properly design a septic system. In its broadest terms, percolation testing is simply observing how quickly a known volume of water dissipates into the subsoil of a drilled hole of known surface area. While every jurisdiction will have its own laws regarding the exact calculations for the length of line, depth of pit, etc., the testing procedures are the same. In general, sandy soil will absorb more water than soil with a high concentration of clay or where the water table is close to the surface.  Testing method  A percolation test consists of digging one or more holes in the soil of the proposed leach field to a specified depth, presoaking the holes by maintaining a high water level in the holes, then running the test by filling the holes to a specific level and timing the drop of the water level as the water percolates into the surrounding soil. There are various empirical formulae for determining the required size of a leach field based on the size of facility, the percolation test results, and other parameters. For leach line testing, a minimum of three test holes are drilled, most commonly six to eight inches in diameter. Ideally, these should be drilled to different depths from three to six feet below the surface. For better, more conclusive results, five drill holes are used in a pattern of one hole at each corner of the proposed leach field and one test hole in the center. Testing of these holes will result in a value with units of minutes per inch. This value is then correlated to a predetermined county health code to establish the exact size of the leach field. Testing for horizontal pits typically requires five to eight test holes drilled in a straight line, or along a common contour, from three to ten feet below the surface. Testing is identical to leach line testing, though the end result is a different type of septic system, established through a different calculation. \\\\text{percolation rate} = {\\\\text{amount of water (ml)} \\\\over \\\\text{time taken (min)}} = {x}\\\\;\\\\text{ml/min} Vertical seepage pits are slightly different in testing methods due to their large size, but the basic testing method is essentially the same. A hole, typically three to four feet in diameter is drilled to a depth of twenty or thirty feet (depending on the local groundwater table), and a fire hose is used to fill the pit as quickly as possible, and then, again, its dissipation rate is observed. This rate is used to calculate the size and number of pits necessary for a viable septic system. Finally, for leach line systems and horizontal seepage pits, a \\"deep hole\\" is drilled to find the water table or to approximately twelve feet (dry). Exact depths will again depend on local health codes. In the case of a vertical seepage pit, local groundwater data may be used, or if the drill hole reaches groundwater, the pit will be backfilled again according to county health code.

It is set during the 1950s in Chicago and is written in the format of a college application essay. It follows the unusual high school experience of the narrator, Robert Nifkin. Plot summary Robert attends Riverview High School, which is only notable for its anti-semitic attitudes, homophobia, boredom, and anti-communist paranoia. Robert has no interest in any of his classes except for ROTC, a class he is taking instead of PE. His boredom and hatred for school grows and he eventually stops attending for large periods of time, preferring to hang out with Kenny Papescu and his girlfriend Linda in a very beatnik part of town. On a day that he actually attends, he finds that his ROTC sergeant has been fired, on the grounds of being a Communist. Robert's truancy increases even more, except on the occasions that he seeks shelter in Riverview from the Chicago winter. Finally the school orders him to be transferred to a correctional school but, from the recommendation of Kenny Papescu, Robert convinces his parents to let him attend Wheaton, a private school. At Wheaton, truancy, when it is even noticed, goes unpunished. This is how, Robert learns, Kenny Papescu has never been to school in over two years. Robert ends up getting straight A's, some in courses he didn't know he was enrolled in. Robert matures greatly while attending the Wheaton school and learns to appreciate art, chess, and the city's architecture; the freedom that it provides allows him to explore his interests with the guidance of the teachers. Robert concludes his high school reflection with the hope that he be admitted to the college.

He served as a Confederate general during the American Civil War, noted for his position as Gen. Robert E. Lee's chief of artillery for most of the conflict. After the war, Pendleton returned to his priestly duties and also wrote religious materials. Camp Pendleton in Virginia Beach, Virginia, is named in his honor. Early life and education William Nelson Pendleton was born in 1809 near Richmond, Virginia. He grew up on the Caroline County plantation belonging to his parents, Edmund Pendleton Jr., grandnephew and adopted son of Edmund Pendleton who established the plantation, and his wife Lucy (Nelson) Pendleton.Wakelyn, p. 341. Private tutors taught young William, who also attended John Nelson's School.Warner, p. 234; Wakelyn, pp. 341-2. Pendleton's family arranged for his older brother (Francis Walker Pendleton) to enter the United States Military Academy at West Point, but when Francis expressed little military interest, William went instead.Krick, p. 48. He entered West Point in 1826 and graduated four years later, standing 5th out of 42 cadets.Eicher, p. 424. Among Pendleton's contemporaries at West Point were future Confederate generals Joseph E. Johnston, Robert E. Lee, and John B. Magruder (with whom he was roommates), as well as future Confederate president Jefferson Davis. Appointed a brevet second lieutenant in the United States Army on graduating (July 1, 1830), Pendleton was assigned to the 2nd U.S. Artillery as a full second lieutenant. His regiment was ordered to Fort Moultrie to defend the harbor in Charleston, South Carolina, but that fall Pendleton fell sick with malaria and was reassigned to the arsenal in Augusta, Georgia to restore his health. Pendleton returned to West Point in 1831 to teach mathematics, and on October 27, 1832, he was transferred to the 4th U.S. Artillery. He resigned his U.S. Army commission a year later on October 31, 1833, reportedly due to the issue of nullification in his home state.Wakelyn, p. 342.; Eicher, p. 424. In 1833 Pendleton joined the faculty at Bristol College in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, and taught mathematics. In 1837 he began serving in the same capacity at Newark College in Delaware. Minister and teacher In 1838, Pendleton was ordained an Episcopal priest by Bishop William Meade of Virginia, and in 1840 he became the first principal at the Episcopal High School in Alexandria, Virginia. Three years later he relocated to Baltimore, Maryland to serve as a priest in two parishes; he also served as rector of All Saints' Church in Easton, Maryland.Wakelyn, p. 342 In 1847 Pendleton moved to Frederick, Maryland to become rector of All Saints Church. In 1853, he returned to Virginia and became rector of Grace Episcopal Church in Lexington, where he remained as the American Civil War began.W.G. Bean, Stonewall's Man: Sandie Pendleton (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1959), p. 4 citing Susan Pendleton Lee, Memoirs of William Nelson Pendleton, D.D.

On March 16 he entered the Regular Confederate Artillery with the rank of captain, and on May 1 he was elected captain in the Virginia Artillery. He commanded a four-gun battery called the Rockbridge Artillery, initially armed with training guns from the Virginia Military Institute. He named his guns \\"Matthew, Mark, Luke, & John\\" after the Gospel writers.Eicher, p. 424; Wakelyn, p. 342; Warner, p. 234. On July 2 Pendleton participated in the minor Battle of Falling Waters, where \\"he and his battery performed capably.\\"Krick, p. 50. On July 13 Pendleton was promoted to colonel and began serving as chief of artillery for Brig. Gen. Joseph E. Johnston's command during the First Battle of Bull Run on July 21. He was wounded in this fight, injured in an ear and his back. Beginning in July 1861, Pendleton led the artillery of the Confederate Army of the Potomac, and on March 14, 1862, he continued in this role after the army was renamed the Army of Northern Virginia. On March 26 he was promoted to brigadier general.Wright, p. 78. Appointed from Virginia on March 26, 1862, to rank from and confirmed by the Confederate Congress on that same date. After Robert E. Lee took over command of the army in June 1862, he attempted to remove Pendleton as chief of artillery, however he was a personal friend of Jefferson Davis, which ensured the security of his position. On July 3, Pendleton was again wounded when a mule from his artillery kicked him in the leg and possibly breaking one of his bones there. His most noted Civil War performance occurred during the 1862 Maryland Campaign. On the evening September 19 Lee gave Pendleton command of the rearguard infantry following the Battle of Shepherdstown, ordering him to hold the Potomac River crossings until the morning. Despite a commanding position from which to defend the fords, \\"Pendleton lost track of his forces and lost control of the situation.\\" Awakening Lee after midnight, he frantically reported his position lost and all of his guns captured. This turned out to be a highly exaggerated and hasty account, as he lost only four guns, but he had pulled out the infantry \\"without sufficient cause.\\" Richmond newspapers viciously reported on this incident for the remainder of the war, and unflattering rumors and jokes were spread by his own soldiers and throughout the army. At least one military court of inquiry was held to investigate Pendleton's actions at Shepherdstown. Pendleton was not particularly well-liked by the enlisted men, and it was said that \\"while the soldiers would gladly cheer most higher officers, they remained silent when Pendleton rode past them.\\"Krick, pp. 51-3. Pendleton served with the Army of Northern Virginia for the rest of the conflict, taking part in the 1863 and 1864 major campaigns of the Eastern Theater. When fellow \\"fighting bishop\\" Leonidas Polk was killed during the Atlanta Campaign, Jefferson Davis proposed assigning Pendleton to command of his corps in the Army of Tennessee, but Robert E. Lee convinced Davis that he was unsuited for the job. During the final two years of the war, Pendleton's role was mostly administrative, and his active command was only of the reserve ordnance. Throughout the war, he continued in his religious practices, always preaching to his men. Pendleton surrendered with Lee's army at Appomattox Court House on April 9, 1865, and was paroled from there and returned home.Warner, pp. 234-5. Postbellum career and death Pendleton in later life After the war, Pendleton returned to Lexington, Virginia, and his rectorship of Grace Church, which he would hold for the rest of his life. There in Lexington he retained a strong friendship with Matthew Fontaine Maury, Francis Henney Smith, and Robert E. Lee, and played a significant role in persuading his former commander to move to Lexington himself to take up the presidency of the institution that was to become Washington and Lee University. Lee, in turn, became one of Pendleton's parishioners, and Lee's last public transaction in 1870 was at a Grace Church vestry meeting in which Lee led a group of church leaders in a mutual pledge to increase Pendleton's salary. Rev. Pendleton conducted Lee's funeral in October 1870.Joseph William Jones' [former C.S.A.] Personal Reminiscences, Anecdotes, and Letters of Gen. Robert E. Lee. It was in Lexington on January 17, 1873, during a memorial to the departed Robert E. Lee, that Pendleton first blamed James Longstreet for Lee's defeat at the Battle of Gettysburg. Departing entirely from his own previous statements, including his Official Report written just days after the battle,Report of Brig. Gen. William N. Pendleton, C. S. Army, Chief of Artillery, JUNE 3-AUGUST 1, 1863.--The Gettysburg Campaign, http://www.civilwarhome.com/Pendletongettysburgor.htm he claimed that General Lee had ordered Longstreet to attack the Union right at \\"sunrise\\" on July 2, 1863. The attack was not begun until about 4:00 p. m., and Pendleton falsely claimed that Longstreet disobeyed Lee's orders and that the supposed delay was solely responsible for loss of the battle, which became a mainstay of the Lost Cause. Pendleton remained in Lexington until his death in 1883, tirelessly promoting the Lost Cause and the reputation of Robert E. Lee. He traveled throughout the South raising money to build the Robert E. Lee Memorial Church (formerly Grace Church) in Lexington, and is buried next to his son at the Stonewall Jackson Memorial Cemetery. The first service in the new, completed church building was Rev. Pendleton's funeral. Family and genealogy On July 15, 1831, Pendleton married Anzolette Elizabeth Page, and they had four children. His only son, Alexander Swift \\"Sandie\\" Pendleton, also served the Confederacy as an aide to Stonewall Jackson and was mortally wounded during the retreat that directly followed the Battle of Fishers Hill on September 20, 1864.Krick, p. 49; Wakelyn, p. 342. His daughter Susan married future Confederate general Edwin G. Lee on November 16, 1856. In popular media Pendleton was portrayed in the 2003 Civil War film Gods and Generals by John Castle. The scene featured a conversation between Pendleton and Stonewall Jackson regarding his son, Alexander Swift \\"Sandie\\" Pendleton, who was present. During the scene, Pendleton informed Jackson of the naming the howitzers Mathew, Mark, Luke, and John; to which, Jackson replied \\"I'm sure your men will spread the gospel wherever they encounter the enemy.\\" See also *List of American Civil War generals (Confederate) Notes References * Eicher, John H., and David J.

Hammond‚Äôs pioneering developments in electronic remote control are the foundation for all modern radio remote control devices, including modern missile guidance systems, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and the unmanned combat aerial vehicle (UCAVs). Of Hammond‚Äôs many individual inventions, the inventions which have seen the most significant application are the variable pitch or controlled pitch propellers and single dial radio tuning.Webster‚Äôs New Biographical Dictionary, ¬© 1983, Springfield, Massachusetts, Merriam Webster, p. 442 Britannica online Lemelson-MIT He was the son of mining engineer John Hays Hammond, Sr.. Biography Born in San Francisco, California, his family moved to South Africa and the Transvaal in 1893. His father was active as a mining engineer for Cecil Rhodes' mines in South Africa. In 1898, the family moved to England, where young Hammond fell in love with castles and life in earlier times. The family returned to the United States at the turn of the 20th century. At the age of twelve, Hammond accompanied his father on a business trip to Thomas Edison‚Äôs laboratory in West Orange, New Jersey. Upon being introduced to Edison, the boy asked so many questions that the inventor gave him a personal tour of the complex and assumed the role of mentor. The two would remain in contact for the rest of Edison‚Äôs life. While studying at the Sheffield Scientific School of Yale University, Hammond became interested in the new study of radio waves and he was taken under the wing of Alexander Graham Bell. Bell also became his mentor and the two would remain close friends until Bell‚Äôs death. After graduation from Yale in 1910, Hammond took a job in the U.S. Patent Office. His strategy was simple: having learned from Edison that \\"inventing had to be a money- making proposition, where better to learn what fields were up-and-coming than in the Patent Office?\\" After he became an authority on the patent process, he founded the Hammond Radio Research Laboratory on his father‚Äôs estate in Gloucester, Massachusetts. In total, he is credited with more than 800 foreign and domestic patents on more than 400 inventions (the exact number of inventions is vague due to how credit was listed on the forms) mostly in the fields of radio control and naval weaponry. He served on the Board of Directors of RCA and a listing of his professional colleagues and society friends reads like a Who‚Äôs Who of the rich and famous. Aside from his inherited wealth, his inventions brought Hammond an additional fortune. Between the years 1926 and 1929, he built a castle (including a drawbridge) which became his home, laboratory, and a showplace for his collection of Roman, medieval, and Renaissance artifacts. Hammond was also interested in the mechanism and workings of the pipe organ, and had a huge organ installed in the castle's Great Hall. Famous organists, including Richard Ellsasser and Virgil Fox, performed and made commercial recordings on this instrument, unfortunately no longer in operating condition (2015). Overlooking Gloucester Harbor in the North Shore region of Massachusetts, Hammond Castle is now a museum which offers self-guided tours throughout half the year and hosts fundraising events on a regular basis.Ramos, L.

History 295px Southern Arkansas University was established by an Act of the Arkansas Legislature in 1909 as a district agricultural high school for southwest Arkansas and was originally named Third District Agricultural School, often called by students and faculty \\"TDAS.\\" Its first term began in January 1911, with its curriculum including only subjects at the secondary school level. In 1925, the State Legislature authorized the school to add two years of college work and to change its name to Agricultural and Mechanical College, Third District (Magnolia A&M;). The school continued to offer both high school and junior college courses until 1937, at which time the high school courses were discontinued. In the fall of 1949, the Board of Trustees, exercising authority vested in it by the State Legislature, decided to develop the college at a four-year, degree-granting institution. The Board authorized the addition of third-year college level courses to being with the fall semester of 1950. Fourth-year courses were added in the fall semester of 1951. By Act Eleven (January 24, 1951), the State Legislature changed the name of the institution to Southern State College. In 1975, the institution was approved and accredited to offer a Master of Education Degree in selected areas. Following approval of the Board of Trustees, the name of the institution was changed to Southern Arkansas University by the Board of Higher Education on July 9, 1976, in accordance with Act 343 of the General Assembly of 1975. Also in 1975, Southwest Technical Institute in Camden, Arkansas, joined the SAU system as Southern Arkansas University Tech. Academics Southern Arkansas University offers 70 different undergraduate options, including pre-professional tracks, and 2+2 degree completion programs in four different academic colleges: * David F. Rankin College of Business * College of Education * College of Liberal and Performing Arts * College of Science and Engineering Southern Arkansas University also offers 19 graduate programs, which are offered either face-to-face, online, or as a hybrid combination of the two.

The university's athletic nicknames are Muleriders and Lady Muleriders. The Muleriders take their name from the legend that the football team in the early 1900s had to ride mules from the college's agricultural department to catch the nearest train north of the college in order to reach out-of-town football games. The Muleriders football team won the Gulf South Conference Championship in 1997. In each of 1953 and 1954, the then Southern State College Mulerider tennis team went undefeated winning the Arkansas Intercollegiate Conference in both singles and doubles and was invited by the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics to represent their district in their National Tennis Championships in 1953. In 2006 and 2009, the Mulerider baseball team won the Gulf South Conference championship. In 2009 the Mulerider baseball team hosted the NCAA Division Two South Regional for the first time in school history. In 2007, the Mulerider coed cheerleading squad competed at the NCA National Competition. In 2008, the cheerleading squad went back to nationals and took 5th in their division. Traditions =Bed races= Family Day Bed RaceThe annual Bed Races have been a unique tradition as a part of SAU's Family Day festivities since November 7, 1981. Representatives from SAU's residence halls build and race twin-sized \\"beds\\" with a mattress platform on top of four bicycle tires. Once constructed, the beds are decorated according to a theme decided annually by the residence's Hall Councils. The bed must have one reclining student, protected by a football helmet, and four runners. Each team competes in a double elimination race, and the winners take home the coveted Bed Race Trophy. =Celebration of Lights= Celebration of LightsThe Celebration of Lights has been a Christmas tradition at SAU since 1984. What once started as a single display to celebrate the 75th anniversary of the school has become an annual part of the holidays in Magnolia. During the celebration, a large Christmas tree is lit in front of Overstreet, as well as light displays all over campus. Additional strands of lights are strewn along the 187-foot SAU bell tower, transforming it into a giant Christmas candle. Included in the festivities each year are: the Magnolia City Christmas Parade, caroling, pictures with Santa Claus for the children, and a holiday buffet dinner for the community. =Mulegating= Mulegating\\"Mulegating\\" is a family-oriented event that gets Mulerider football fans geared up for every home SAU football game.

It is now the offices of the local council. This imposing building is an elegant mansion in the Elizabethan-Jacobean revival style, with 35 bedrooms and incorporating a huge salon for musical recitals. It is attached to a previous abbey building which had been occupied by Franciscan friars until the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1542. History The house was designed by Scottish architect William Burn and completed in 1852 for The Hon Robert Edward Ward, brother of the 3rd Viscount Bangor and High Sheriff of Down for 1842. The associated estate covered some 6000 acres and included half of the town of Bangor. Robert's only daughter and heiress, Matilda Catherine Maude, had married the soldier The 5th Baron Clanmorris. After his death in 1916, Lady Clanmorris retained possession of the house until her own death in 1941. When the then municipal authority, Bangor Borough Council, bought the Castle and grounds, the music saloon became the Council Chamber. The first Council meeting was held there almost exactly 100 years after the building-now known as the Town Hall was first completed. The successor to Bangor Borough Council, North Down Borough Council now sits at the Castle. The gardens, designed by the Ward family in the 1840s, have won many awards for their outstanding blooms and are open to the public. The building also hosts a museum to the Ward and Bingham families, which includes the Victoria Cross awarded to Commander The Hon. Edward Bingham, son of the 5th Lord Clanmorris.

In the early 1950s Volvo received an order to develop a new utility vehicle for the Swedish Army. A pre-run series of 90 vehicles, named the L2304, was delivered between 1959 and 1961. It was powered by a Volvo B16 engine. Full scale deliveries of the somewhat improved L3314 began in 1963. The L3314 was powered by the 1.8L B18. The L33-series was offered with different body- variants such as hard-top, half-cab, soft-top, or special versions mounting anti-tank weapons. All vehicles are forward control (where the cab is located over the front axle), except the open L3304. The base version was the L3314SU softtop. Other versions were the L3314HT hardtop with mechanical winch, the L3304 anti-tank gun vehicle and the L3315 communications version, with a shielded 24V system. The L3314 was succeeded by the Volvo C303 in the late 1970s. An upgraded version of the L3314 was offered on the civilian market in 1977 as the C202. It was a hard-top with the more powerful B20 engine instead of the B18, but with less robust axles and no differential brake. The C202 was manufactured in Hungary as a cheaper alternative to the more expensive C303. Civilian versions of the L3314 series, as well as the C202, are often called the Volvo \\"Laplander\\". Military use A 1963 Volvo L3314A (ex Swedish armed forces) =Sweden= The L3314SU was adopted by the Swedish Army in 1959 as the Personlastterr√§ngbil 903 (Pltgb 903) and the L3314HT as the Pltgb 903B. The hard-top L3315 communications and command version was named the Radiopersonterr√§ngbil 9033 (Raptgb 9033). (The L3315 was soon nicknamed Valp, meaning \\"puppy\\", from its clumsy looks.) The L3304 low profile open bodywork version was called the Pansarv√§rnspj√§sterr√§ngbil 9031 (Pvpjtgb 9031) and armed with a Pvpj 1110 90 mm recoil-less antitank gun. The Swedish Army also used a few half-cabs, designated the Pansarv√§rnsrobotterr√§ngbil 9032 (Pvrbtgb 9032) and fitted with a Bofors Bantam ATGM. There were some deliveries of a version for fire fighting, called the Brandterr√§ngbil 921. These could be connected to a trailer via a power take-off at the rear of the vehicle. A 1968 Volvo L3314N, manufactured since 1962 =Norway= The Norwegian Army adopted a version called the L3314N with a fold-down windscreen and 24 volt electrical system to comply with NATO regulations.

A survivor of four battle wounds, he commanded one of the lead brigades during Pickett's Charge at the Battle of Gettysburg. Early life Fry was born in Kanawha County, Virginia (now West Virginia) on June 24, 1822.Warner, Ezra J. Generals in Gray: Lives of the Confederate Commanders. Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press, 1959. . p. 95 He received his education at Virginia Military Institute in Lexington, and attended the United States Military Academy, but did not graduate with the Class of 1846, having failed mathematics and been subsequently dismissed. He then returned to his native Virginia to study law. He resumed his interest in the military with the outbreak of the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, serving as a first lieutenant of voltigeurs (skirmishers). Following the war, Fry moved to California as a \\"Forty-Niner.\\" Fry practiced law in Sacramento City and was elected Justice of the Peace, Fourth Ward in 1852. In October 1856, he accompanied the filibusterer, William Walker, during his expedition to Nicaragua as a colonel (and later general) in Walker's mercenary army. Fry returned to California, living there until 1859 when he moved to Alabama and engaged in cotton manufacturing. Fry had married Martha MiCou, whose family were among the owners of the cotton mills in Tallassee, Alabama.Golden, Virginia Noble, A History of Tallassee, Tallassee Mills of Mount Vernon- Woodberry Mills, 1949, LC Control No.: 50034427. p. 27. Civil War With Alabama's secession from the Union, Fry enlisted in the Confederate army and was appointed Colonel of the 13th Alabama Infantry. The regiment was transported to Virginia and fought in the Peninsula Campaign. Colonel Fry was wounded in action at the Battle of Seven Pines. He recovered in time to command his regiment in the savage fighting at Antietam, where he was again wounded, suffering a shattered arm. Fry rejoined his regiment and led it during the 1863 Battle of Chancellorsville, where he suffered a third wound. During the subsequent Gettysburg Campaign, Fry's regiment was among the first Confederate units to deploy into battleline and engage the Union cavalry of John Buford at the opening of the Battle of Gettysburg on July 1, 1863. His men suffered considerable casualties as the day progressed after being driven off McPherson's Ridge by the arrival of the Federal Iron Brigade. With the capture of Brig. Gen. James J. Archer, Fry assumed command of Archer's Brigade of Tennesseans and Alabamians. Held in reserve on July 2, Fry's brigade was a key part of the July 3 attack that became famous as Pickett's Charge. He suffered yet another wound, and fell near the Union lines. Fry was treated in a local field hospital then held as a prisoner of war at Fort McHenry in Baltimore, There, rumors circulated that Fry had been involved in the August 1862 murder of Union general Robert L. McCook in Alabama. Fry's West Point classmate, John Gibbon, who ironically commanded the troops that had shot Fry at Gettysburg, vouched for his character and the matter was forgotten.Hess, Earl J., Pickett's Charge: The Last Attack at Gettysburg, Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2001. . p. 367. Exchanged in 1864, Fry rejoined the Army of Northern Virginia in time for the beginning of the Siege of Petersburg.Warner, 1959, p. 96. During Philip H. Sheridan's raid on Richmond in early May, Fry was assigned command of Seth Barton's Virginia brigade, leading it during the Battle of Meadow Bridge. He was promoted to brigadier general on May 24, 1864. During the final months of the war, Fry was placed in command of a military district in South Carolina and Georgia. Postbellum After surrendering in Augusta, Fry emigrated to Cuba at the close of hostilities, lodging in Havana hotels with several other former prominent Confederates, including Jubal A. Early, John C. Breckinridge, Robert A. Toombs, and John B. Magruder, among others.P√©rez, Louis A., Jr., Cuba and the United States: Ties of Singular Intimacy, Athens: University of Georgia Press, 2003. . p. 19. He did not return to the United States until 1868, when he returned to Tallassee, Alabama as a businessman. He resided at No. 1, King Street, in a house built for Confederate Officers in charge of the Tallassee Armory. His home is still standing and after renovations now serves as the law offices of The Segrest Law Firm. Fry later expanded his business career in Florida, and, in 1881, moved to Richmond, Virginia, where he was president of a cotton mill for a decade. Fry died in Richmond on January 21, 1891 and was buried in Oakwood Cemetery in Montgomery, Alabama.

The community is on Ontario Highway 15 about northeast of Ontario Highway 401 at Kingston by road, and is situated in geographic Bastard Township on the southeast side of Big Rideau Lake. Portland was first settled in the early 19th century as one of the first settlements along the Rideau Waterway. The original seven houses in Portland, informally known as \\"The Landing\\", were a transfer point for passengers travelling from Brockville and continuing by barge to Perth. With the completion of the Rideau Canal Waterway in 1832, steamboats and barges carrying raw materials such as cordwood, maple syrup, potash, cheese, tanned hides and salt beef were a common sight. Portland became a thriving village of trade with Kingston, Montreal and Ottawa. The village of Portland took its name in 1843 from William Cavendish- Bentinck, 3rd Duke of Portland. By the 1860s, the settlement had expanded considerably to require five hotels and, by the early 20th century, cottages were springing up around the lake and the tourist trade had begun. Advances in rail and road travel and increasing tourism offset a decline in the role of agriculture in the economy of Portland. Tourism then began to lead the economy of Portland, and still does to this day. An international speed skating tournament called Skate the Lake is held each winter by Portland Outdoors on the Big Rideau Lake.

Early life Johnathan Brockenbrough, the son of Moore Fauntleroy Brockenbrough and his wife Sarah Waller Smith was born August 1, 1830 in Richmond County, Virginia. John Brockenbrough was a 2nd cousin of John White Brockenbrough and his sister, Civil War diarist, Judith White (Brockenbrough) McGuire. He graduated from the Virginia Military Institute in 1850. Civil War At the start of the Civil War, Brockenbrough was appointed colonel of the 40th Virginia Infantry, which served attached to Brig. Gen. Charles W. Field's Virginia brigade in Maj. Gen. A.P. Hill's Light Division and later Maj. Gen. Henry Heth's division in the Third Corps, Army of Northern Virginia. Brockenbrough led his regiment through the Seven Days Battles, a punishing series of battles that caused 50% casualties in his regiment. Brockenbrough assumed command of the brigade after Field was wounded at the Second Battle of Bull Run and led it two days later at Chantilly. During the Maryland Campaign, Brockenbrough took part in the capture of Harpers Ferry, and then marched with the rest of the Light Division to the rescue of Gen. Robert E. Lee's army at Sharpsburg; his brigade was deployed on the far right of A.P. Hill's line and did not see any direct action there. At Fredericksburg, his brigade was ordered to plug a hole in the Confederate line that was being exploited by Union troops under Maj. Gen. George G. Meade. Brockenbrough lost control of his brigade during this action and two of his regiments split off with him and never reached the fighting. Lee apparently was not impressed with Brockenbrough's leadership qualities. Even though months had passed, the unit was still called Field's Brigade and Brockenbrough was still considered its temporary commander. Lee did not recommend John for promotion. In early 1863, Lee brought Brig. Gen. Henry Heth from assignment in Tennessee to replace Brockenbrough in command of the brigade (soon called \\"Heth's Brigade\\"), hoping to restore it to fighting shape. During the Battle of Chancellorsville, Heth took over command of the division when Hill was wounded on May 2, 1863, which meant that Brockenbrough was back in command of the brigade on May 3, when it lost around 300 men storming the enemy line. After the battle, Brockenbrough was given a rare commendation for leading the attack by General Heth. Brockenbrough remained in brigade command when Heth was promoted to command a new division. At the Battle of Gettysburg, Brockenbrough's brigade was in the rear of Heth's column during the march on the Chambersburg Pike, July 1, 1863, and thus missed the morning attacks against the Union cavalry and the I Corps. In the afternoon attacks, his men advanced on a line with J. Johnston Pettigrew's North Carolina brigade, and although the latter brigade fought fiercely, suffering over a thousand casualties, Brockenbrough's brigade was hesitant and fought ineffectively against the Pennsylvanians of Col. Roy Stone and a portion of the Iron Brigade, as may be inferred from their casualty rate of 100. The brigade rested on July 2, but on July 3 participated in the bloody assault known as Pickett's Charge. There is no record that Brockenbrough marched with his men toward Cemetery Ridge that day, however, and Col. Robert M. Mayo of the 47th Virginia Infantry was in temporary command. It is possible that the death of Brockenbrough's brother during the battle on July 1 left him distraught and unable to step up to his responsibilities. Assigned to the far left flank of Pettigrew's divisional line, the brigade was subjected to heavy shelling from Union artillery on Cemetery Hill and when the 8th Ohio Infantry came up on their left flank, the Virginians turned and ran. During the Confederate retreat back to Virginia, Brockenbrough attempted to reclaim some of his damaged reputation by making a reckless advance against Union troops at Falling Waters on July 14, suffering numerous casualties. Five days later, Brockenbrough's former regimental lieutenant colonel, Brig. Gen. Henry Harrison Walker, was given command of the brigade, returning Brockenbrough to the 40th Virginia, which he led at Bristoe and Mine Run. On January 21, 1864, Brockenbrough resigned from the Confederate States Army. He retained his rank of colonel in the reserves until late 1864. Postbellum life After the war, Brockenbrough lived in Norfolk and Richmond. He died in Richmond and is buried there in Hollywood Cemetery. Notes References * Allardice, Bruce S.

Biography He was born at Venice of a Luccan family. After studying at Padua he served the Republic of Venice in various political capacities, including that of secretary to one of the Venetian delegates at the Council of Ten. In 1562 he accompanied the ambassador Michele Suriano to the Court of Emperor Maximilian II and acted as official historiographer of the Republic; during which office he delivered the funeral oration for those killed at the naval battle of Lepanto (1571). After the change of government he was made savio di Terraferma (minister for the administration of the Terraferma), and became a senator. In 1579 he was appointed official historian to the republic, in succession to Luigi Contarini. He took up the narrative from where Cardinal Bembo had left it, in 1513, and brought it down to 1551. He was made provveditore to the Chamber of Loans in 1580, Commisario del Cadore (1589), savio del consiglio in 1590, ambassador to the pope in Rome (1592‚Äì95) and governor of Brescia (1590‚Äì92). In 1596 he was appointed procurator of St Mark's (1596, next in dignity to the doge), and provveditore delle fortezze (superintendent of fortifications) in 1597. He died in Venice. Writings La legazione di Roma di Paolo Paruta, ed. Giuseppe De Leva, vol. II, 1887 He was devoted from youth to literature and philosophy, also the composition of poetry. He applied himself especially to history and political science, and was at the end of the sixteenth century what Machiavelli, though in a different way, was at the beginning. He belonged intellectually to the group of recently ennobled men who met at the residence of the Morosini to discuss politics, which party (it may be called the liberal party) came into authority in 1582. His chief works are the Guerra di Cipro (\\"War of Cyprus\\") and the Storia Veneziana, a continuation of Bembo's history, embracing the years 1513 to 1551, which was at first written in Latin and subsequently in Italian, published until posthumously in 1599. Both works were composed at the request of the Government, but written with truth and impartiality, showing especially the connection between the current events of Venice and the general history of Europe. His Despatches from Rome and the Relazione written at the end of his diplomatic mission reveal his great political foresight, by his accurate estimate of men and affairs at Rome, and which are equal to those of the greatest Venetian ambassadors. Of his political writings, the Della perfezione della vita politica in dialogue form, written between 1572 and 1579, of somewhat didactic and academic tone, treats principally of the superiority of the active and contemplative life, a problem he decides in favour of the active life on account of its contributing more to the welfare of the Republic. It was supposed, not without reason, to have been written to controvert the ideas contained in Bellarmine's De officio principis christiani. His Discorsi politici were not published till after his death. The first book treats of the greatness and decadence of the Romans; the second of modern governments, especially Venice, being really an apology for the latter's policy. Among his other works may be mentioned a number of political orations. Though Paruta is an independent thinker, Macchiavelli's influence is notable. The policy of Italian equilibrium, which a century later developed into that of European equilibrium, was clearly foreseen by him. In his political views economy is not an important part, and therein he is inferior to his contemporary, the Piedmontese Botero.

Valentinius pooled dual concepts from the Platonic world of ideal forms, or fullness (pleroma), and the lower world of phenomena, or emptiness (kenoma, Œ∫Œ≠ŒΩœâŒºŒ±). Employing a third concept of cosmos, what is manifest, Valentinian initiates could exegete scripture in light of these three aspects of correlated existence. The void The ancient Greek term for emptiness or void (kenoma), as pertaining to Theodotus's exegesis of Gospel of John chapter 1 verse 3, is described in The Excerpta ex Theodoto of Clement of Alexandria (Casey, 1934). Hysterema Elsewhere, the usual antithesis to Pleroma is not Kenoma, but Hysterema (·ΩëœÉœÑŒ≠œÅŒ∑ŒºŒ±). As the system is reported by Hippolytus (vi. 31, p. 180) this word is used as the complement of the word Pleroma, denoting all that is not included in the meaning of the latter word. Thus the Horos or boundary is described as separating the Hysterema from the Pleroma, itself partaking of the nature of both; but preserving all inside fixed and immovable by permitting nothing from without to enter. We can understand in the same sense the passage in Epiphanius (Haer. 31, 4, p. 166), where the same name is given to the Demiurge; for it appears in the case of the word Hebdomas that the Valentinians gave to the Demiurge the name of the realm over which he ruled, and from which he had his origin. Marcus speaks of the Demiurge as karpos hysterematos (Iren. I. xvii. 2, p. 86; xix. 1, p. 90), probably, as Lightfoot suggests (Coloss. p. 335), in contrast with the description of the Christ as karpos pleromatos. Marcus would seem to have used the word Hysterema, in the sense already explained, to denote the region outside the Pleroma (see Iren. I. xvi. 2, p. 82), where, in his usual way of finding mysteries in numbers, he regards the former region as symbolised by the numbers up to 99 counted on the left hand, the latter by 100 counted on the right hand. As Marcus uses the word Pleroma in the plural number, so (see Lightfoot, l. c.) he may have used Hysterema also in the plural number to denote the powers belonging to these regions respectively. But it seems to us likely that the assertion that Marcus counted a second or a third Hysterema is but an inference drawn by Irenaeus himself (I. xvi. 3, p. 83), from the fact that he found the name karpos hysterematos applied not only to the Demiurge, but to his mother, Sophia Achamoth. Irenaeus ordinarily uses the word, usually rendered labes by the old Latin translator, in no technical sense, but with the general meaning of defect, commonly joining it with the words agnoia and pathos. The word Hysterema is found also in Excerpt. Theod. 2, 22 (Clem. Alex. pp. 967, 974), in the latter passage in a technical sense; but the context does not enable us to fix its meaning. Hysterema is said by Epiphanius (Haer. 24, p. 74) to have been used as a technical word by Basilides.

The school enrolls approximately 580 students from Pre-K to Grade 12, of whom around 75% are Bahamian. St Andrew's has high academic standards and holds internationally accredited status with both the Council of International Schools and the New England Association of Schools and Colleges. St Andrew's was the first school in the Bahamas to be authorized to offer the International Baccalaureate Organization's Primary Years Programme (PYP) and the Pre-University IB Diploma curriculum.  History  St Andrew's School first opened its doors in 1948 with an enrollment of 24 students. Its first headmaster was Reverend J. H. Poole, the Minister then in charge of St. Andrews Presbyterian Kirk. For the next two years, the students were accommodated in the Kirk Hall, and the name St Andrew's was permanently adopted. The School was founded by a group of parents who wanted their children prepared for admission into private boarding schools in Britain by the age of 13. At the time, the subjects taught in local Primary School did not include those necessary for entry into private British schools. Candidates for entrance were required to sit examinations in Latin and/or Greek, French, Algebra, Geometry, History, and Geography, in addition to the usual papers in English, Arithmetic and Religious Knowledge. By 1950, the number of students had increased to 70 and the Kirk Hall was no longer an adequate location for the school. In that same year, a group of enthusiastic and far-sighted parents negotiated the purchase of the Collins property that borders both Shirley Street and Collins Avenue. The Collins mansion provided extensive quarters and a wonderful atmosphere for learning that enabled the school to grow to 160 pupils by 1954. As St Andrew's School enlarged, so did the number of parents who wished for their children to complete their secondary education either in North America or the United Kingdom. To meet these needs, it was necessary to widen the educational horizons of the School. Thus, in addition to offering the London University GCE 'O' Level courses and examinations, the School became a PSAT and SAT Examination Centre. Over the next 15 years, the School's population grew to 590 students and it was evident that new premises had to be sought. The existing School property at Yamacraw was acquired and a major fund raising effort then ensued, championed by students, teachers, parents, and the energetic and devoted Headmaster, Mr. John Chaplin. In early 1970, the ground was broken and by November 1971, the school had moved to the campus it occupies today.

She lives a normal life with a successful and supportive family and many friends. Abby aspires to be like her older siblings, Isabel and Eva. Isabel and Eva always fight. She also has a younger brother named Alex. Each of her siblings excel in a variety of fields. Abby is shown to be a natural swimmer, poor in math while rich in literature. Just because she excels in writing, she still feels incomparable to her siblings, though her older sisters envy her hair, and her brother looks up to her. In That's the Way the Cookie Crumbles, Abby is a talented baker. She is willing to break the rules at times but only when she feels she needs to. She wants to attend a writing camp next summer. Abby is an Amazing role model for young girls. Abby's friends and relationships play a major role in her life, as well as her love for animals, like cats and dogs. She and Isabel own a kitten named T-Jeff, a kitten she had once taken in secretly when she found him in Look Before You Leap but was permitted to keep him officially when her parents found out. Abby's favorite color is purple. Abby's favorite thing to do is art. Her favorite grade school teacher is Ms. Bunter, her creative writing teacher. Her favorite middle school teacher is Ms. Bean, her art teacher, who also happens to be good friends with Ms. Bunter. A distinguishing characteristic of Abby is her curly red hair and blue eyes. She hopes to become a writer, journalist, or writing teacher someday. Her major love interest is Simon, a saxophone player a year older than she is who goes to her school. Jobs Abby is an editor for The Daisy, her school's literary journal. She has one of the most important jobs and is the only sixth grader on the staff. She used to be \\"band manager's assistant\\" for the school band, the Jazz Tones. She had been nicknamed \\"Curly Red\\" and had done daring jobs. When choosing between The Daisy and the Jazz Tones, Abby felt it was too pointless to stay, even for Simon, so she quit, much to the displeasure of the band director. In Have Wheels, Will Travel, Abby takes care of her neighbor Heather's cat, Marshmallow, for a week while Heather is in London. The only other \\"job\\" Abby has had is shown in Super Special #1- The Best is Yet to Come, when she takes care of Wynter, the daughter of Olivia Hayes's college roommate, Laurie. Laurie takes advantage of Abby by making her babysit the difficult Wynter for a week and refuses to pay Abby until Abby's mom finds out and kicks her out of the house, giving Abby the money she deserved. Friends and acquaintances *Jessica \\"Jessy\\" is Abby's former best friend. She was fond of space and science. She is fairly tall and her mother is divorced. In Out of Sight, Out of Mind, she moves in with her father and his new wife and stepdaughters in Oregon, changing into a boy crazy girly-girl. She starts wearing skimpy outfits and even gets a boyfriend. Abby claims that although Jessy is still friendly, she is a completely different person from the old Jessica. *Ian is Jessy's boyfriend. He takes her to cool parties and is very popular. *Natalie is an acquaintance of Abby who she meets at the beginning of fifth grade. Along with Jessica, they were best friends, but Bethany becomes Natalie's best friend after Jessica moves away. However, Natalie and Abby still remain close. In middle school, her personality changes completely: Natalie was messy in fifth grade, but by \\"Knowledge is Power\\" is seen to be neat and sleek. She wears hip clothes and acts bored a lot. She plays the clarinet in the Jazz Tones and has a brother named Nicolas. Before she changed, Natalie was a huge fan of chemistry, fantasy, and Harry Potter. After Abby quits her job with the Jazz Tones, she and Natalie become \\"just friends\\" and now rarely spend time with each other. *Bethany is one of Abby's good friends. She loves animals (especially hamsters), is a vegetarian, and used to be Brianna's personal cheerleader, saying \\"Yay, Brianna!\\" all the time. After she declares independence from her in \\"The More The Merrier\\", she becomes a good friend of Natalie. However, in \\"Now You See It, Now You Don't\\", she strangely reverts to being Brianna's cheerleader again, though she and Abby remain friends. She is also a talented gymnast. She owns a lop rabbit and a hamster named Blondie. *Hannah is Abby's current best friend. They met at a Fourth of July picnic. Hannah is much like Jessica, with similar long brown hair and big brown eyes. She is neat, understanding, friendly, tall, and a bit annoying at times. She always has a solution for everything and has many good ideas. However, she doesn't always understand Abby, as seen in \\"It's Music To My Ears\\". Hannah has an over-the-top positive attitude and never talks badly about anybody. In \\"Sealed With A Kiss\\", Abby mentions that she thinks Hannah might have a bit of a crush on Casey, though she denies it. Hannah has a little sister named Elena. *Brianna is one of the most popular girls in school and a major show-off. She likes to brag excessively, which includes reminding everyone she is the best and she only has the fanciest of things. In \\"Home Is Where The Heart Is\\", Abby actually becomes Brianna's neighbor. She has a younger sister, as revealed in \\"Reach for the Stars\\", and a cousin named Clara, who Abby meets in \\"What Goes Up Must Come Down\\". In the first book, it is revealed that her last name is Bauer. * Victoria is a mean, obnoxious friend of Brianna. When Abby trips on the first day of health class and loses her clip-on earring, Victoria calls her the \\"One Earring Wonder.\\" She and Brianna met during the 5th grade science fair. Her trademark word is \\"like\\". * Sophia is a shy, artistic girl who is another of Abby's current friends. Sophia likes to draw, and is on the school newspaper staff as the artist. * Simon is Abby's former crush. He is in seventh grade, plays the saxophone, and is very popular. He has brown hair that falls over his face, blue eyes, and according to Abby he is \\"dreamy\\". He is athletic, a good student, and very polite. He only sees Abby as a friend and barely an acquaintance, much to her dismay. In \\"All That Glitters isn't Gold\\", it is mentioned that Abby and Simon are just friends, and she no longer has a crush on him. * Casey Hoffman is Abby's friend from elementary school who she meets during the science fair. In elementary school they were teased and called \\"lovebirds\\". Although a regular character in the middle books, he does not appear as often in some of the later series. Abby suspects that Casey likes Hannah and vice versa. * Mason is a good friend of Abby's, nicknamed \\"the Big Burper\\" for his burping talent. Short and pudgy in elementary, he has grown taller and slimmer by the time middle school begins. He helps Abby out by helping her sell cookies on school grounds, though it is against school rules. Mason has an older sister named Kathleen, who pierced Abby's ears for her. It is shown in Have Wheels, Will Travel that he has a younger brother. Mason has a crush on Abby, but she is not interested and wants to remain friends. Mason still has hopes of Abby falling for him someday. * Zach was the computer whiz of 5th grade. He has blond hair, blue eyes, and long dark eyelashes. He was once described by Abby as cute, but \\"a zombie\\" when hooked up to a game station. Brianna liked him in elementary school, much to his dismay. * Tyler was Zach's best friend. Also a computer whiz, Bethany liked him in fifth grade (mostly due to Brianna liking Zach). *Mira is a girl Abby meets in Everything New Under the Sun. She attends the same bookmaking workshop as Abby and Cleo, and becomes friends with them. Family *Eva is Abby's freshman older sister and Isabel's twin. Abby calls her one of her 'SuperSibs'. Eva loves sports and athletics are all she ever thinks of, but when she breaks her arm in Have Wheels, Will Travel, she learns to be less stubborn. Eva currently has a very shy boyfriend named Stephan as of Sealed With A Kiss. *Isabel is Abby's older sister and Eva's twin, another 'SuperSib'. She is a freshman and very intelligent, who loves history (especially wars) and nail polish. She starred in plays in middle school and always dresses fashionably. She is a keen debater. *Alex is Abby's younger brother, who is in second grade but can already build robots. He is a master at video games and a computer whiz. He loves to play chess. He also looks up to Abby. *Olivia Hayes is Abby's mother. She is a lawyer and a person who would do anything to ensure the best for her kids. It is because of her job promotion that the Hayeses all move to a new house in Home is Where the Heart Is. *Paul Hayes is Abby's father. He runs his own business from his office in their home. He always tries to help the kids out when they feel uncomfortable, such as when he takes their side during Laurie's visit in The Best Is Yet To Come. *Grandma Emma is Abby's favorite grandma who is always sending Abby new calendars. When she is invited to go spend time with Grandma, the answer's an excited \\"YES!\\" *Cleo is Abby's cousin. In \\"Everything New Under the Sun\\", Abby meets her when they both go to stay with Grandma Emma. She is stuck-up and rude to Abby at the beginning of the book, but warms up to her later after a fight between the two goes nowhere and they start laughing at how ridiculous they were. She enjoys dancing and drama, has traveled a lot, and is quite girly. Journal Abby has kept a journal since just before fourth grade. The novels contain traditional third-person writing intermixed with portions of Abby's journal written in the first person. Since Abby's favorite color is purple, she writes in purple ink until \\"Everything New Under The Sun\\", when she informs her readers how she ran out of her signature purple ink (but that won't affect her love for writing). She adds calendar quotes to almost every entry, including some that she makes up. Abby loves to write, especially in her journal, and wants to become an author. School =Fifth Grade= In the fifth grade, Abby goes to Lancaster Clark Elementary School. Abby's favorite teacher is her creative writing teacher, Ms. Bunder, who gave her the nickname \\"Purple Hayes\\". Ms. Bunder comes to Abby's class every Thursday. Ms. Kantor is her homeroom teacher who is new to the school, having moved from Swiss Hill Elementary. Abby's best friends are Jessica, Natalie, Jessica moves away soon after. One day, Jessica comes back from where her dad lives for work and meets Abby, but Abby is not much satisfied with Jessica . =Sixth Grade= Abby goes to Susan B. Anthony Middle School. One of her favorite teachers, Ms. Bean, works as an art teacher; she is similar to and friends with Ms. Bunder. Abby matures in the sixth grade. Abby had the courage to get pierced ears on her own, and she has a new sense of funky punky fashion. She makes a very shy new friend, Sophia, who is very good at art.

Starting his performing career in the New York hardcore band Heart Attack, and rising to prominence as vocalist of D Generation, a solo recording artist, having recorded numerous albums including the Lucinda Williams produced Sunset Kids. Over the course of his career, Malin has collaborated with Bruce Springsteen, Billie Joe Armstrong of Green Day, Ryan Adams and numerous other musicians. Biography =Early career= Jesse Malin began his music career, at the age of 12, as the front-man for the seminal New York City hardcore band Heart Attack. The band auditioned at CBGBs but were denied because they couldn't bring in a drinking crowd to the bar. Following the demise of Heart Attack in 1984, Jesse worked on several other projects, including the band Hope, before joining the band D Generation for which he was the lead singer for eight years. As one of New York City's most noted bands of the 1990s, D Generation released three albums, including the critically acclaimed No Lunch, before eventually disbanding in April 1999. Malin didn't stop writing music and went on to form two other projects, PCP Highway (with former D Generation bandmates Howie Pyro and Joe Rizzo) and Bellvue (also named Tsing-Tsing for a brief time); the latter band released one album, To Be Somebody, on Goldenseal Records. The album included versions of songs that would later be reworked for Malin's first two solo albums, including \\"Solitaire\\", \\"Basement Home\\", \\"Brooklyn\\" and \\"Downliner\\". =Solo career= Being a fan of Neil Young, Tom Waits, and Steve Earle affected his work; Malin spent the next two years working on a fresh sound. Former Whiskeytown front-man Ryan Adams, who'd been a friend of Malin since the D Generation days, was impressed with Malin's new material. Adams offered to produce Malin's debut album despite the fact that he'd never produced a record before. The two headed into Loho Studios in New York in January 2001 and made an album in just six days. A deal with Artemis Records soon followed. The Fine Art of Self Destruction appeared in the United Kingdom in October 2002. The lead off first single, \\"Queen of the Underworld\\" was a moderate hit and the British press quickly hailed Malin's debut as one of the year's best. Jesse Malin performing at The Bowery Ballroom in New York City in 2015. Stateside fans were eventually able to purchase the album The Fine Art of Self Destruction in January 2003. Tour dates followed, both in America and the United Kingdom. Malin contributed to two cover albums, first he covered \\"Hungry Heart\\" for Light of Day: A Tribute to Bruce Springsteen, and then he recorded a cover of The Clash's \\"Death Or Glory\\" on the tribute White Riot Vol. 2: A Tribute to The Clash. He also picked up a nomination for the Shortlist Music Prize. By November 2003 he was back in the studio recording tracks for his second album, The Heat, which was released in June 2004, accompanied by a string of tour dates on both sides of the Atlantic. Malin has also collaborated with Ryan Adams & Johnny T to form the band The Finger (the pair adopted the pseudonyms \\"Irving Plaza\\" and \\"Warren Peace\\" respectively) who released two EPs which were later collected into the album We Are Fuck You. Malin's album, Glitter in the Gutter was released on March 20, 2007. It also featured a cover of The Replacements' \\"Bastards of Young\\" and a duet with Bruce Springsteen on \\"Broken Radio.\\" A music video was also made to accompany \\"Broken Radio.\\" Malin released a 'live in the studio' album, Love It To Life in November 2007 on the One Little Indian label for sale in the UK. Recorded live at Gigantic Recording Studios in New York City, it featured songs from his previous albums. He used the title again in 2010 for an album of new material. Malin released a cover album on 7 April 2008 entitled On Your Sleeve, containing covers of songs by, among others, The Ramones, Sam Cooke, Neil Young and The Hold Steady, as well as a studio recording of a long-time live favourite, Fred Neil's \\"Everybody's Talkin'.\\" In 2010, Malin formed a band called Jesse Malin and the St. Mark's Social and released a new album called Love It To Life; the title comes from a quote by Joe Strummer. (The title was previously used on a 2007 UK release of live material on the One Little Indian label.) Featuring a more rockier approach, the album's first single was \\"Burning The Bowery\\" and next single was \\"All The Way From Moscow.\\" Malin was also a judge for the 9th annual Independent Music Awards.

Early life and career Harrow was born in Winchester, Kentucky, United States of America, and was educated in the common schools. He studied law and passed his bar exam in Lawrenceville, Illinois, where he established a practice. As an attorney on the Eighth Judicial Circuit, he was a frequent associate of Abraham Lincoln for several years before moving to Vincennes, Indiana. In the late 1850s, Harrow moved again, relocating his practice to Mount Vernon, Indiana.. Harrow married Juliette James, of a pioneer family of Mount Vernon. Her father, Enoch R. James, owned the only private bank in Posey County, Indiana, for a number of years and was one of the wealthiest men in that county. The Harrows had a daughter, Esther.Roll Harrow's law practice prospered and he became influential in his community. He was selected as the captain of a local militia company known as the \\"Knox County Invincibles,\\" a social group that was mostly ceremonial. Civil War When the Civil War erupted, Indiana began organizing similar militia groups and integrating them with companies of new recruits into full regiments. Despite his age (approaching 40), Harrow enlisted in the Union Army. Through his political connections, Harrow was named as major of the 14th Indiana Infantry, serving under the command of Col. Nathan Kimball. He served in what became West Virginia at the battles of Cheat Mountain and Greenbrier River in late 1861, then participated in several fights against troops of Stonewall Jackson during the Valley Campaign as lieutenant colonel of the 14th. Following the Battle of Kernstown, where Harrow lost 54 men in action, he was promoted to full colonel. Harrow briefly resigned from the army in July 1862 after being accused of drunkenness at Kernstown, but was reinstated to command the next month. Serving in the Army of the Potomac at Antietam, Harrow's regiment attacked enemy positions along the Sunken Road, where half his men became casualties. Harrow's report praised all his men for their performance during four hours under heavy fire in the battle. As senior colonel in his brigade, Harrow later became its commander and led it through the Fredericksburg Campaign. In October 1862, Kimball had sent a letter to President Lincoln personally requesting that Harrow be promoted to brigadier general. Lincoln signed the letter on October 16 and forwarded it to the War Department. However, no action was taken and Harrow remained a colonel through the balance of the winter.Lincoln Papers In April 1863, Harrow was finally promoted to brigadier general and led the 1st Brigade, 2nd Division, II Corps, during the Gettysburg Campaign. On July 2 at the Battle of Gettysburg elements of his brigade were engaged against the attack of Maj. Gen. Richard H. Anderson on the Union lines. Most notably the 1st Minnesota Volunteer Infantry distinguished itself in stalling a Confederate attack on an under-defended part of the Federal line. Harrow served as acting division commander while Brig. Gen. John Gibbon led the corps late in the day. Maj. Gen. Winfield S. Hancock at that time was in charge of the left flank of the army. Defending a portion of the Union line on Cemetery Ridge during the climatic fighting on July 3, Harrow's men helped repel a part of Pickett's Charge. With the wounding of Gibbon, Harrow was elevated once more to command of the 2nd Division. The division had suffered over 1,600 casualties out of 3,773 men in a contest that Harrow reported had raged with \\"unparalleled ferocity.\\"Harrow's Gettysburg report, Official Records, Vol. 27, Part 1. Harrow's men captured four Confederate battle flags in their front. His own brigade suffered as many as 768 casualties.U.S. War Department, Harrow's Brigade marker at Gettysburg National Military Park. (Harrow reported 722 losses.) However, nagging questions persisted about Harrow's ability to work cooperatively with his superiors and his abilities to lead and inspire soldiers, as well as about his sobriety. In his official report on Gettysburg, John Gibbon, Harrow's superior, openly praised his other two division commanders, but, notably, did not mention Harrow in his litany of officers deserving recognition.Gibbon's Gettysburg report, Official Records, Volume 27, Part 1. Soon afterward, Harrow was relieved of command and never again served in the Army of the Potomac, but he was soon reinstated in field command by his old friend, President Abraham Lincoln. Harrow was reassigned to the Western Theater, where he participated in the Atlanta Campaign in command of the 4th Division of the XV Corps, a change regretted by those soldiers. His men initially resented him, as \\"Western officers and soldiers held a sort of prejudice against the Eastern army,\\" in which Harrow had most recently served. Compounding the problem, \\"General Harrow was far from possessing the necessary qualifications to induce men to obey him ...\\" and instituted a series of strict and unusually harsh disciplinary measures.Williams (one of Harrow's subordinate officers). Nonetheless, Harrow's command fought well, especially at the Battle of AtlantaGary Ecelbarger, The Day Dixie Died: The Battle of Atlanta (New York: St. Martin's Press, 2010), pp. 127-129. and the Battle of Ezra Church. After a reorganization in September 1864, Harrow was left without an assignment for the duration of the war. Perhaps due to his ill temper and past reputation, a number of high-ranking generals, including Oliver O. Howard, William T. Sherman, and Winfield S. Hancock, refused to accept him. One of his subordinates later remarked, \\"... while he may have possessed military knowledge, he never gave evidence of its possession during the Atlanta campaign....\\" Harrow formally resigned from the army in April 1865. Postbellum career Harrow returned to Mount Vernon and resumed his law practice. He also became active in local politics. In 1872 Harrow died in a train derailment accident at New Albany, Indiana. He was en route to Jeffersonville, where he had planned to make a speech supporting presidential candidate Horace Greeley. Harrow is buried in Bellfontaine Cemetery, Mount Vernon, Indiana.

The object of the game is to be the first to discard one's hand by playing them to the table. If one cannot be first to play all cards, then the aim is to have as few cards as possible. Cards can be played separately or in certain combinations using poker hand rankings. Games of Pusoy Dos can be played by three or four people. Rules =Suit order= From lowest to highest, clubs (), spades (), hearts () and diamonds (), with the 2 being the highest card and the 3 the lowest. Another variation of the suit order is: From lowest to highest, diamonds (), clubs (), hearts () and spades (), with the 2 being the highest card and the 3 the lowest. Filipino Americans in the Bay Area call this variation \\"Daly City High School.\\" =Card combinations= There are various types of card combinations that can be used in play. Single card: Cards rank from 2 (highest) to 3 (lowest). Between cards of the same rank, the higher suit beats the lower suit. That is, a 5 beats a 5. Pair: A pair of equally ranked cards. Between pairs of the same rank, the pair with the higher suit wins. That is, a 7-7 beats a 7-7. Three of a kind: Three equally ranked cards. This is a variation of game play and may be excluded or included as a valid card combination. Five-card hand: Any five-card combination following the poker hand rankings. From highest to lowest, valid poker hands include: *Royal flush (jack to 2 with the same suit) *Straight flush (any straight cards with the same suit) *Four of a kind (plus an additional card/a Kicker) *Full House (any three cards of the same number with any two cards of the same number) *Flush (same suit) *Straight (any straight cards) *Two-Pair *Three Kings (no such thing) The playable combinations are similar to poker hands, but there are vital differences. Unlike poker, there are no \\"two pair\\" combinations, and although a four of a kind needs a fifth card to be complete, a three of a kind cannot be accompanied by extra cards (except for a full house when played as a five-card hand). Also, a combination can only be beaten by a better combination with the same number of cards: A single card can be beaten only by a single card, a pair by a pair, a three of a kind by a three of a kind, and a five-card hand by a five-card hand. =Dealing and playing= The dealer shuffles the deck and then deals one card at a time either clockwise or counter- clockwisehttp://www.pagat.com/climbing/bigtwo.html until each player has 13 cards (52 cards / 4 players = 13 cards per player). In games with three people, either 39 or 51 cards can be dealt (13 or 17 cards per player). In some variations, the deck must be reshuffled if any player is dealt all four twos. The game begins when the player holding the lowest card, which is the 3 depending upon the suit order being played, plays that card or a valid card combination including that card. The card combination should be placed faced up in the center of the table. Play then proceeds clockwise or counterclockwise. The next person must play a higher combination of the same number of cards or pass (play no cards). Once a player passes, he cannot return until a new round has started. If all players pass, the person who last put down a card combination starts a new round by playing any card or valid card combination. All players are entitled to know the number of cards each player has in hand at any time, and you must answer truthfully if asked. =Winning and scoring= The first person to get rid of all his/her cards wins, and game play stops at this point. If you cannot be first to play all your cards, then your aim is to have as few cards as possible at the end of the game. In some variations of the game, game play continues until only one person still has cards in hand. Game scoring can involve penalty points, like Big Two, or positive points.http://www.pagat.com/climbing/bigtwo.html#scoring%20vars In versions of the game where game play ends when a person wins, the winner is awarded one point and the losers no points. In versions of the game where game play continues until only one person has cards, the winner is awarded five points, the second-place finisher is awarded three points, and the third-place finisher is awarded one point. =Variations= In the South West of England, this is known as Frazz's game, the suits are ranked Diamonds, Clubs, Hearts, Spades and instead of using a points system the losing player becomes the dealer. The four of a kind hand cannot be made into a 5 card hand.

Early life Stannard was born in Georgia, Vermont, the son of Samuel Stannard and Rebecca (Petty) Stannard. He was educated in the public schools of Georgia, and attended academies in Georgia and Bakersfield. Stannard worked as a farmer, teacher, and foundry operator in St. Albans. Stannard also served as a noncommissioned officer during the Vermont militia's activation for the Upper Canada Rebellion in 1838.Peter Hanraty, Editor, Put the Vermonters Ahead, 1978, page 81 In 1856, he participated in organizing a new militia unit in St. Albans, the Ransom Guards, and was chosen their first lieutenant. In 1858, he was selected as commander of the 4th Vermont Militia Regiment with the rank of colonel.Washington Davis, Camp-Fire Chats of the Civil War, 1889, page 418 Civil War =Early service= In June 1861, Stannard was elected lieutenant colonel of the 2nd Vermont Volunteer Infantry. Some local residents claimed that he was the first Vermonter to volunteer for duty in the Civil War, based on his immediate reply by telegram to the governor's first call for troops. He fought with the 2nd Vermont at the First Battle of Bull Run in July 1861, successfully enough that he was offered command of the newly forming 3rd Vermont, but he turned it down because he thought he had not served long enough to qualify. During the Battle of Williamsburg in the Peninsula Campaign the following year, Brig. Gen. Winfield S. Hancock's report indicated that Stannard was responsible for securing a bridge that was crucial to the battle. A week after the campaign, on July 9, 1862, he was appointed colonel of the 9th Vermont Infantry. During the Maryland Campaign in September 1862, 9th Vermont was part of the Federal garrison that was forced to surrender to Stonewall Jackson at Harpers Ferry. Stannard was conspicuous in the defense of Bolivar Heights against Jackson's attack. Col. William H. Trimble, his brigade commander, had Stannard accompany him in an inspection of the Union lines in that sector. Both thought the southern end of the line weak.Teetor, p. 63. Stannard clearly had no confidence in Col. Dixon Miles, the garrison commander, but he displayed his own coolness under fire by watching for Confederate artillery action in order to tell his men to drop to the ground.Teetor, pp. 180, 187. Stannard is reported to have tried to extract his regiment from Harpers Ferry before the surrender could take effect, but he was intercepted with orders to yield to the Confederates.Teetor, p. 287 n. 25. Upon his exchange in January 1863, Stannard returned to Vermont. He was appointed brigadier general on March 11, 1863, and given command of the 2nd Vermont Brigade in April, joining it in its camps in the defenses of Washington, D.C. The brigade consisted of the 12th, 13th, 14th, 15th, and 16th Vermont Infantry regiments. Stannard's immediate predecessor had been Brig. Gen. Edwin H. Stoughton, who had been captured in his bed at Fairfax Court House during a raid by partisan ranger Col. John S. Mosby. Stannard drilled his new brigade strenuously and his \\"quiet but effective\\"Tagg, p. 30. command style made him well respected by the men and significantly improved morale in the Brigade. =Gettysburg= Stannard as a brigadier general in the Union Army; note the empty right sleeve. During the Gettysburg Campaign, the 2nd Vermont Brigade was one of four brigades sent from the Capital to join the Army of the Potomac as it pursued Robert E. Lee into Pennsylvania. Stannard's command left the Washington defenses on June 25. Marching 18 miles a day for a week, the brigade reported to the 3rd Division of the I Corps. The I Corps had fought, and lost, heavily in the first day of the Battle of Gettysburg, July 1, 1863. Three regiments of Stannard's men arrived only after the fighting ceased that day, adding to the division's depleted ranks. (The other two regiments, the 12th and 15th Vermont, had been detached to guard wagon trains.) On July 2, Stannard was brigade officer of the day, leaving immediate command of his troops to Col. Francis V. Randall of the 13th Vermont. Although the brigade was withdrawn behind Cemetery Hill, not participating in the initial defense against the attack by Confederate Brig. Gen. Ambrose R. Wright on Cemetery Ridge, it was sent to recover guns lost to Confederate attacks. The Vermonters recovered these guns despite resistance from Wright's Georgians. The brigade's greatest fight, however, was on July 3, where it was one of the principal defenders against Pickett's Charge. The Vermonters lost men to sharpshooter fire and to the bombardment preceding the Confederate attack. As the assault approached Cemetery Ridge, Stannard swung two of his regiments (the 13th and 16th Vermont) out at a 90¬∞ angle, pouring deadly flanking fire into Brig. Gen. James L. Kemper's brigade, one of the critical factors that defeated the Confederate attack. Minutes later, the unconnected assaults by the Confederate brigades of Brig. Gen. Cadmus M. Wilcox and Col. David Lang approached the Union line to the south of the Vermont Brigade. Stannard once again wheeled two regiments (the 14th and 16th Vermont) and repeated his tactic of flanking fire to repulse the assault. Stannard was wounded in his right thigh by an artillery shell fragment, but stayed on the field until the end of the battle. Col. Randall commanded the brigade until it was mustered out of service. Maj. Gen. Winfield S. Hancock, commander of the II Corps (who was in operational command of the defense against Pickett) wrote in his report, \\"The troops of General Stannard behaved with spirit at the Battle of Gettysburg. They were well ordered and well and vigorously handled by General Stannard and his subordinate officers, who did not hesitate to put them in front of the fight, and to keep them there until the battle was decided.\\" In the middle of the battle, Stannard's corps commander, Maj. Gen. Abner Doubleday observed the repulse of Pickett's advance, waved his hat in excitement, and exclaimed \\"Glory to God! Glory to God! See the Vermonters go it!\\". After the battle, he wrote \\"I can only say that they performed perhaps the most brilliant feat during the war. For they broke the desperate charge of Pickett, saved the day and with it, the whole North from invasion and devastation.\\"Tagg, p. 31. The Battle of Gettysburg and Stannard's Brigade are mentioned in the third chapter of MacKinlay Kantor's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel \\"Andersonville\\" (1955). =Service with the Army of the James= Stannard as a major general in the Union Army Stannard was wounded too severely to return immediately to field command, so he left his brigade and returned to Vermont to recover. During this time he briefly commanded the post of New York City. When he returned to duty, it was to Maj. Gen. Benjamin Butler's Army of the James. When Brig. Gen. Charles A. Heckman was captured at the Battle of Proctor's Creek, Stannard replaced him in command of the 1st Brigade, 2nd Division, XVIII Corps. In the Battle of Cold Harbor, he was wounded in the left thigh but continued to lead his brigade through the Second Battle of Petersburg. He assumed command of the 1st Division, XVIII Corps, during the Siege of Petersburg and was conspicuous at the Battle of Chaffin's Farm. His division led the attack on Fort Harrison. Stannard was again wounded holding the captured fort against a Confederate counterattack, requiring the amputation of his right arm. He received a brevet promotion to major general for his actions during the assault on Fort Harrison. Postbellum Stannard was then assigned to light duty in Vermont for the remainder of the war. In 1866, he served briefly as assistant commissioner for the Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen and Abandoned Lands in Maryland. He resigned from the Army in June 1866 and worked as a customs official in Vermont. From 1881 until his death, he served on the staff of the Doorkeeper of the United States House of Representatives. He died in Washington, D.C., and is buried at Lakeview Cemetery in Burlington, Vermont. A statue of Stannard, sculpted by Karl Gerhardt, stands atop the Vermont Memorial at the Gettysburg Battlefield.Hawthorne, p. 109. Another statue of Stannard stands in Lakeview Cemetery. The town of Stannard in Caledonia County, Vermont, was named after the general. He also is commemorated on a tablet inside the First Congregational Church of Bennington.

They are commonly used in chemistry texts and in patent claims. Markush structures are depicted with multiple independently variable groups, such as R groups in which a side chain can have varying structure. This more general depiction of the molecule, versus detailing every atom in the molecule, is used to protect intellectual property. The company which files the patent makes a general claim for the usage of the molecule without revealing to their competitors the exact molecule for which they are declaring a useful application.  History  Markush structures are named after Eugene A. Markush, founder of the Pharma Chemical Corporation in New Jersey. He was involved in a legal case that set a precedent for generic chemical structure patent filing. The patent filing was US Application 611,637, filed January 9, 1923. Markush was awarded a patent from the US Patent Office for ‚ÄúPyrazolone Dye and Process of Making the Same‚Äù on August 26, 1924.  Use in patents  In describing a chemical, a Markush structure allows the patent-holder to list several active/effective structural formulas. = USA = Patent applicants in the United States are required to reveal their best known embodiment implementing their invention. However, the \\"best mode\\" requirement can no longer be used as a basis for invalidity or denying patentability.

After the war, he was a prominent member of New York Society and served as president of the City College of New York for thirty-three years. Early life Alexander Webb was born in New York City on February 15, 1835, to a prominent family with a strong military lineage. He was the son of Helen Lispenard (n√©e Stewart) Webb and James Watson Webb, a former regular army officer who was a well-known newspaper owner and diplomat (serving as U.S. Minister to Brazil in 1861). After his mother's death in 1848, his father remarried to Laura Virginia Cram, with whom he also had several children, including William Seward Webb, a doctor and financier who was married to Eliza Osgood Vanderbilt (granddaughter of Cornelius Vanderbilt), and Henry Walter Webb, a railroad executive. His paternal grandfather, Samuel Blatchley Webb, was wounded at the Battle of Bunker Hill and served on George Washington's staff during the American Revolutionary War, and his paternal grandmother, Catherine Louisa (n√©e Hogeboom) Webb, whose family was long associated with the Van Rensselaer's of New York. His maternal grandparents were Alexander L. Stewart and Sarah Amelia (n√©e Lispenard) Stewart (the great-granddaughter of merchant Leonard Lispenard and a descendant of the Roosevelt family). Career After preparing at Colonel Churchill's Military School in Sing Sing, New York (now Ossining, New York), Webb entered the United States Military Academy at West Point, graduating in 1855, ranking 13 out of 34. He was commissioned a brevet second lieutenant in the 4th U.S. Artillery and was sent to Florida to serve in the Seminole War. After serving his duty in Florida, he was given an appointment to serve as an instructor of mathematics at West Point. =Civil War= At the outbreak of the Civil War, Webb took part in the defense of Fort Pickens, Florida, was present at the First Battle of Bull Run, and was aide- de-camp to Brig. Gen. William F. Barry, the chief of artillery of the Army of the Potomac, from July 1861 to April 1862. During the Peninsula Campaign, he served as Gen. Barry's assistant inspector general and received recognition for his assembling an impregnable line of artillery defense during the Battle of Malvern Hill; Brig. Gen. Daniel Butterfield wrote that Webb saved the Union Army from destruction.Sword, p. 2081. During the Maryland Campaign and the Battle of Antietam, recently promoted to lieutenant colonel, he served as chief of staff in Maj. Gen. Fitz John Porter's V Corps. After Antietam, he was ordered to Washington, D.C., where he served as Inspector of Artillery. In January 1863 he was again assigned to the V Corps, now commanded by Maj. Gen. George G. Meade, and served again as chief of staff. During the Battle of Chancellorsville, Meade gave Webb temporary command of Brig. Gen. Erastus B. Tyler's brigade and thrust him into battle. He performed well and Meade in his report on the battle paid particular detail to Webb's \\"intelligence and zeal\\". On July 1, 1863, President Abraham Lincoln appointed Webb brigadier general, to rank from June 23, 1863.Eicher, John H., and David J. Eicher. Civil War High Commands. Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press, 2001. . p. 730President Lincoln nominated Webb for appointment to the grade of brigadier general on December 31, 1863, and the U.S. Senate confirmed the appointment on August 1, 1864. Eicher, 2001, p. 730 Three days before the Battle of Gettysburg, Brig. Gen. John Gibbon arrested the Philadelphia Brigade's commander, Brig. Gen. Joshua T. Owen, and Webb was given command of the brigade (the 2nd Brigade, 2nd Division, II Corps). Initially, the brigade resented having the meticulously groomed and well-dressed Webb as their commanding officer, but he soon earned their respect through his attention to detail, his affability, and his discipline. =Gettysburg= Statue at Gettysburg by J. Massey Rhind When the Union Army repulsed the Confederates at Cemetery Hill, General Webb played a central role in the battle. CoddingtonCoddington, Edwin B. The Gettysburg campaign; a study in command, Scribner's, 1984. wrote about Webb's conduct during Pickett's Charge: \\"Refusing to give up, [Webb] set an example of bravery and undaunted leadership for his men to follow....\\" Webb's brigade was posted on Cemetery Ridge with the rest of the II Corps on the morning of July 2, 1863. The brigade repulsed the assault of Brig. Gen. Ambrose R. Wright's brigade of Georgians as it topped the ridge late in the afternoon, chasing the Confederates back as far as the Emmitsburg Road, where they captured about 300 men and reclaimed a Union battery. Soon after, Webb sent two regiments to assist in counterattacking the assault of Maj. Gen. Jubal A. Early's division on Cemetery Hill.Tagg, pp. 50-51. On July 3, Webb's brigade happened to be in the center of the Union line to defend against Pickett's Charge, in front of the famous \\"Copse of Trees.\\" As the Confederates launched a massive artillery barrage to prepare for their infantry assault, Webb made himself conspicuous to his men, many of whom were unfamiliar with their new commander. He stood in front of the line and leaned on his sword, puffing leisurely on a cigar while cannonballs whistled by and shells exploded all around. Although his men shouted at him to take shelter, he refused and impressed many with his personal bravery. As Maj. Gen. George Pickett's Virginia division approached to within a few yards, two companies of Webb's 71st Pennsylvania fell back, and Webb feared the personal disgrace and the results of a breakthrough in his line. He shouted to his neighboring 72nd Pennsylvania to charge, but they refused to budge. He attempted to grab their regimental colors and go forward with them himself, but apparently the standard bearer did not recognize him, because he fought Webb for the colors before he went down, shot numerous times. Webb ultimately gave up on the 72nd and strode directly in front of the chaos as Brig. Gen. Lewis Armistead's Confederate brigade breached the low stone wall, over to his 69th Pennsylvania regiment. Webb was wounded in his thigh and groin by a bullet, but kept going. With the help of two of Col. Norman J. Hall's New York regiments, and Brig. Gen. William Harrow's men, who ran over in a mass to get in their shots, Webb and his men brought the Confederate assault to a standstill, inflicting heavy casualties. Webb received the Medal of Honor on September 28, 1891, for \\"distinguished personal gallantry in leading his men forward at a critical period in the contest\\" at Gettysburg on July 3, 1863. President Lincoln nominated Webb for appointment to the brevet grade of major general of volunteers for his service at Gettysburg, to rank from August 1, 1864, and the U.S. Senate confirmed the appointment on February 14, 1865.Eicher, 2001, p. 715 =Later in the war= After Gettysburg, Webb received command of the division six weeks later and led it through the fall campaigns. His division played a prominent role in the Battle of Bristoe Station. When Gibbon returned to command in the spring of 1864, Webb went back to brigade command for the Overland Campaign. At the Battle of Spotsylvania Court House, in May, he was hit by a bullet that passed through the corner of his right eye and came out his ear, but did not impair his mental abilities. The wound resulted in a false report that he had been killed and his death was reported in the New York Times on May 9.New York Times. May 9, 1864. He returned to the army on January 11, 1865, and was chief of staff of the Army of the Potomac from that date until June 28, 1865.Eicher 2001, p. 558 Webb was the assistant inspector general of the Military Division of the Atlantic between July 1, 1865, and February 21, 1866. Webb was mustered out of the volunteer force on January 15, 1866. On April 10, 1866, President Andrew Johnson nominated Webb for appointment to the brevet grade of brigadier general, USA (regular army), to rank from March 13, 1865, and the U.S. Senate confirmed the appointment on May 4, 1866.Eicher, 2001, p. 738 On December 11, 1866, President Andrew Johnson nominated Webb for appointment to the brevet grade of major general, USA (regular army), to rank from on March 13, 1865, and the U.S. Senate confirmed the appointment February 23, 1867, recalled the confirmation on February 25, 1867, and reconfirmed it on March 2, 1867.Eicher, 2001, p. 709 =Postbellum life= Statue of Alexander S. Webb at City College of New York campus in Harlem, New York City General Webb stayed with the Army until 1870, assigned as a lieutenant colonel to the 44th U.S. Infantry Regiment, July 28, 1866, and the 5th U.S. Infantry Regiment, March 15, 1869. He became unassigned, March 24, 1869. During his final year, he served again as an instructor at West Point. He was discharged on December 5, 1870, with the final permanent rank of lieutenant colonel. From 1869 to 1902, General Webb served as the second president of the City College of New York, succeeding Horace Webster, also a West Point graduate. The College's curriculum under Webster and Webb combined classical training in Latin and Greek with more practical subjects like chemistry, physics, and engineering. General Webb was an early companion of the New York Commandery of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States, being elected on March 18, 1866. He was a founder and first Commander General of the Military Order of Foreign Wars in 1894. He was also an honorary member of the New York Society of the Cincinnati. Personal life On November 28, 1855, Webb was married to Anna Elizabeth Remsen (1837‚Äì1912), the daughter of Henry Rutgers Remsen and Elizabeth Waldron (n√©e Phoenix) Remsen. In February 1892, Webb, his wife, and their daughter and son, Caroline and Alexander, were all included in Ward McAllister's \\"Four Hundred\\". Together, they were the parents of eight children, including: * Henry Remsen Webb (1857‚Äì1858), who died young. * Helen Lispenard Webb (1859‚Äì1929), who married John Ernest Alexandre (1840‚Äì1910), who was involved in steamships, in 1887. * Elizabeth Remsen Webb (1864‚Äì1926), who married George Burrington Parsons (1863‚Äì1939), the brother of William Barclay Parsons, in 1891. * Anne Remsen Webb (1866‚Äì1943), who did not marry and lived with her sister Caroline. * Caroline LeRoy Webb (1868‚Äì1950), who did not marry. * Alexander Stewart Webb Jr. (1870‚Äì1948), who married Florence (n√©e Sands) Russell (1871‚Äì1941), the widow of architect William Hamilton Russell, in 1916. * William Remsen Webb (1872‚Äì1899), who died unmarried. * Louise de Peyster Webb (1874‚Äì1910), who married William John Wadsworth in 1904. Webb died in Riverdale, New York on February 12, 1911. He is buried in West Point National Cemetery. A statue of General Webb was dedicated in the Gettysburg National Military Park in 1915.New York Times, October 13, 1915, p. 7. =Descendants= Through his daughter Helen, he was the grandfather of Marie \\"Civilise\\" Alexandre (1891‚Äì1967), who married U.S. Olympian Frederic Schenck (1886‚Äì1919) in 1917; and Anna Remsen Alexandre (1895‚Äì1984). =Legacy= Webb was an articulate and graphic author who wrote extensively about the Civil War, including his book published in 1881, The Peninsula: McClellan's Campaign of 1862. A full-length bronze statue of him stands at Gettysburg Battlefield, overlooking the approach of Pickett's Charge. A full-length statue of General Webb, in full military uniform, also stands in his honor on the campus of the City College of New York.The statue is on the east side of Convent Avenue near both Shepherd Hall and the Administration Building. Colonel Charles S. Wainwright, chief of artillery of the I Corps, a friend and social peer of Webb in New York City, wrote that he was one of the \\"most conscientious, hard working and fearless young officers that we have.\\" Meade's aide Theodore Lyman considered him \\"jolly and pleasant,\\" although he was put off by Webb's \\"way of suddenly laughing in a convulsive manner, by drawing in his breath, instead of letting it out‚Äîthe way which goes to my bones.\\" But Lyman regarded Webb as a \\"thorough soldier, wide-awake, quick, and attentive to detail,\\" despite this annoying quirk. In popular culture Civil War historian Brian Pohanka had a brief, uncredited appearance as Webb in the 1993 film Gettysburg, about the battle.

On 1 January 2016, the former commune of Brenac was merged into Quillan.Arr√™t√© pr√©fectoral 21 December 2015 Geography Quillan is located at the foothills of the Pyrenees, on the road between Carcassonne and Perpignan. The River Aude runs through the town. At the base of the mountains, fields of sunflowers and vineyards straddle the roads with snow-capped peaks in the distance. The location is thought of as one of the most spectacular in France, which is one of the reasons for the increase in tourism and migration to the area. Peyrepertuse, Montsegur, Puilauren, Queribus, Roquefixade and other spectacular ancient Cathar sites are within easy reach. The beaches of the Mediterranean are little more than an hour away. In the other direction, the awe of Carcassonne is 45 minutes drive, while the majestic and sophisticated city of Toulouse is one and a half hours away. Quillan is a medium-sized town 6 km from Esp√©raza, neighbouring the commune of Ginoles. It is popular for whitewater rafting, canoeing, fishing and kayaking on the Aude River and other outdoor activities including cycling, hiking and running. History Historically, Quillan was a stopping point on the ancient and winding road between Carcassonne and Perpignan. The River Aude traditionally carried timber and other local products to Carcassonne and the Canal du Midi. The town was particularly noted for hat making, and then later, the production of formica. Times have changed however, and with the construction of the toll- road joining Carcassonne to Perpignan via Narbonne, the town has moved away from production towards eco-tourism, tourism and outdoor pursuits such as rambling, biking, kayaking, rafting and walking. The surrounding area is rich in geographical and historical interest including many Cathar castles. Population Economy The town and surrounding villages are largely agricultural, producing milk, grapes, wine (including the Blanquette de Limoux), wheat, sunflowers, eggs and meat from poultry and cows. In the last few years, tourism has increased and during the warmer months many tourists flock to Quillan and its surroundings for outdoor activities, cultural events, and restaurants. There are many bed-and-breakfasts and rentals. Culture During each August there is a week of the Folklore Festival where dancers, musicians and singers from 10 or 12 different countries perform during the day and evening on the town square of Quillan. Transportation There is a 1 euro bus/train that goes from Quillan to Carcassonne and from Quillan to Perpignan, each day. The railway line from Carcassonne stops in Limoux and Esp√©raza but some train services have been replaced by buses. Using this service, it's about 50 minutes to Carcassonne and about 1.25 hours to Perpignan. From Perpignan it's an easy short train to Barcelona or up to Narbonne and the TGV lines that depart from the South of France. By car, Quillan is 45 minutes from Carcassonne and one and a half hours from Toulouse.

Biography Sternberg was born to a well-to-do Russian-Jewish family. He was a poor student in school, particularly struggling in French. He began writing around the age of fifteen or sixteen. His early writings tended toward the fantastic and the burlesque, and it was only somewhat later that he began writing science fiction. After school Sternberg worked as a packer in a cardboard factory, before moving to Paris with the hope of becoming a publishing writer. The literary climate of 1950s Paris was dominated by the Surrealists and Sternberg found some success in that environment. Sternberg never identified with either his Jewish or Belgian heritage preferring to think of himself as simply \\"mortal.\\" In his writings Sternberg never wrote of either the rich or the poor, but only of the employee, which represented the only world which he knew and could imagine. (source: Lamediatheque.be) Sternberg, a very apt helmsman, owned a diminutive 12 Ft dinghy (Zef class, excellent for day cruising but slow and utterly unfit for racing) and often undertook arduous coastal treks, even in comparatively bad weather. An anarchist at heart, he rejected organized regatta and racing ‚Äì Not unlike Bernard Moitessier, the famous ocean vagabond ‚Äì and wrote a biting satire of yachtsmen, sponsors and yacht clubs, in his erotic-nautical novel Le navigateur published at the peak of Eric Tabarly's success. Dinghy sailing means living a very close relationship with the sea and it is one of the keys to understand the important place of the sea in Sternberg's work, specially in what may arguably be his best novel Sophie, la mer et la nuit. Sternberg died from lung cancer, aged 83. Overview Jacques Sternberg straddled the line between the fantastique and science fiction, which he stated was only a subset of the former in a notorious essay, Une Succursale du Fantastique nomm√©e Science- Fiction [A Branch of the Fantastic Called Science Fiction], published in 1958. In Sternberg's works, the causes of terror are not ghosts or vampires but the modern-day city, often depicted as a giant, evil entity, ready to crush the hapless humans who dare live within its body. This theme reappears in novels such as L'Employ√© [The Employee] (1958), L'Architecte [The Architect] (1960) and La Banlieue [The Suburb] (1976). Sternberg's short stories, collected in La G√©om√©trie dans l'Impossible [The Impossible Geometry] (1953), La G√©om√©trie dans la Terreur [The Terror Geometry] (1958), Contes Glac√©s [Icy Tales] (1974) and Contes Griffus [Clawed Tales] (1993), to name but a few, successfully mix several diverse elements: a very dark sense of Surreal humor, a kafkaesque notion of the absurd, a taste for the macabre, and finally, a somber, pessimistic vision of the world and the future. In Sternberg's fiction, love is never a source of redemption, but something impossible, almost alien, as in Sophie, la Mer, la Nuit [Sophie, The Sea, The Night] (1976) and Le Navigateur [The Navigator] (1977). Sternberg's science fiction stories followed the same absurdist tradition and were gathered in various collections such as Entre Deux Mondes Incertains [Between Two Uncertain Worlds] (1957), Univers Z√©ro [Universe Zero] (1970) and Futurs sans Avenir [Future Without Future] (1971). Themes included aliens misguidedly posing as African-Americans to invade America, the 533rd crucifixion of Jesus, the casual destruction of Earth by aliens who cannot understand humanity, etc. Sternberg's stories anticipate the experimental texts of the New Wave and the humor of Douglas Adams. Sternberg's novels exhibit the same dark, misanthropic characteristics: La Sortie est au Fond de l'Espace [The Exit Lies at the End of Space] (1956) (with a touch of humor) or Attention, Plan√®te Habit√©e [Beware, Inhabited Planet] (1969) (minus the humor) follows the same, merciless logic. Sternberg also wrote for film director Alain Resnais, penning the script of his 1968 surreal time travel feature, Je t'aime, Je t'aime.

Adrian's attempt to solve the case of her murder is the show's longest-running plot arc, and her death left Adrian \\"emotionally paralyzed\\". She worked as a columnist for The San Francisco Examiner, and as a reporter for San Francisco Chronicle, writing hard-hitting exposes. Trudy was played by Stellina Rusich in the first two seasons and Melora Hardin from the third season on; in the season-five episode \\"Mr. Monk and the Class Reunion\\", a younger Trudy is portrayed in a flashback by Lindy Newton. Character development =Casting= When Trudy was merely in photographs and short flashback scenes during the first two seasons, Stellina Rusich was used in the role. By the third season, the character needed to be recast, but with someone similar in appearance to the original actress. Series executive producer Randy Zisk recalls the search was narrowed to five women reading with Tony Shalhoub, and that Melora Hardin \\"just knocked us out. She had an angelic quality without being too syrupy or heavy-handed. It's a softness that we like, because Trudy would definitely have that quality.\\" Character background Trudy Monk was born in Los Angeles in 1962\\"Mr. Monk and the Game Show\\" to Dwight and Marcia Ellison. In Adrian's words, Trudy \\"enjoyed poetry, was often barefoot, and kept every promise she ever made\\". Adrian offers a glimpse into her mindset (in \\"Mr. Monk Takes Manhattan\\") by turning Warrick Tennyson's morphine back on after he had turned it off, claiming Trudy would have wanted him to. She attended the Ashton Preparatory School and graduated valedictorian in 1977, at the age of 15. She did not date very much while there, expecting to know who the right man would be once she found him.\\"Mr. Monk Goes Back to School\\" Trudy and Adrian met during his senior year at UC Berkeley (episode \\"Mr. Monk and the Class Reunion\\"). They married on August 8, 1990. In 1993, Trudy was involved in a lawsuit with the financier Dale \\"The Whale\\" Biederbeck because she referred to him as the \\"Genghis Khan of World Finance\\". Dale was unable to win the lawsuit, but the Monks were forced to sell their house paying for their lawyer. Adrian harbors an intense hatred for Dale because of the pain he caused Trudy, saying that he stole a year of her life. Dale remains an important adversary of Adrian's, especially when he was revealed to have been hiding information about Trudy's death. Trudy was murdered on a snowy \\"Mr. Monk and the Secret Santa\\" December 14, 1997\\"Mr. Monk Is Up All Night\\" with a car bomb, made of about 3 lb of plastic explosives‚Äîpowered by ten 20-volt magnesium batteries‚Äîthat was planted under the front seat and remotely detonated by a cell phone,\\"Mr. Monk Goes to the Theater\\" while she was on an errand to get cough medicine for Adrian's brother, Ambrose.\\"Mr. Monk and the Three Pies\\" Ambrose blames himself for Trudy's death, and his guilt led to a 7-year rift between the brothers. While having a temporary relapse (in \\"Mr. Monk Can't See a Thing\\"), Adrian mentions that Trudy lived for 20 minutes after the bomb went off. Her last words to a paramedic were \\"bread and butter\\", a message to Adrian meaning that she would never leave him, as this was something she always told her husband when they had to temporarily let go of each other for some reason or another. Throughout the series, Monk periodically sees apparitions of Trudy, particularly as he lies in their bed. These appearances tend to comfort him, but on occasion, they seem to impart important information, as in \\"Mr. Monk and the End Part 1\\" where Trudy tells Adrian, \\"It's almost over.\\" He eventually takes this as referring to his quest to solve the mystery of her death. The bomb was built by Warrick Tennyson. Tennyson mentions (in \\"Mr. Monk Takes Manhattan\\") that he did not recognize the man who hired him, but remembers that he had six fingers on his right hand. From the time of Trudy's death until the end of the season two, Monk believes all along that he was the intended target, with Trudy being an innocent victim. The intense guilt contributed to and intensified his nervous breakdown, his obsessive-compulsive manifestations, and his bizarre phobias. Dale reveals (in \\"Mr. Monk Goes to Jail\\") that the car bomb was actually intended for her, not him. Discovering that Trudy was the true target, Adrian is seen to be visibly affected by this news. Adrian attempts (in \\"Mr. Monk Bumps His Head\\") to find this six-fingered man by purchasing a picture of him. The picture turns out to be doctored, leading to Teddy Mulligan, the seller, knocking Monk unconscious and sending him to a town in Wyoming, in turn causing Monk to uncover the murder of a waitress while forgetting his own name. Natalie overhears a woman (in \\"Mr. Monk and Mrs. Monk\\") who looks like Trudy say that she faked her own death to protect Adrian. Adrian begins to believe this might be true, but in the end, this woman turns out to be an actress who has attempted to pass herself off as the real Trudy to get the key to Trudy's old storage unit.\\"Mr. Monk and Mrs. Monk\\" Adrian (in \\"Mr. Monk Is Up All Night\\") sees a Brazilian woman named Maria Cordova, whom he chases for several blocks for no apparent reason. It is later revealed that the reason he was drawn to her is that she received a cornea transplant from an organ donor, who turned out to be Trudy. During the season-six finale (\\"Mr. Monk Is On the Run\\"), Adrian finds the six-fingered man, named Frank Nunn, but unfortunately he is shot and killed by John Rollins, a corrupt Angel County sheriff recruited by Dale in a plot to incriminate Adrian. By the end of the episode, Adrian confronts Dale, telling him that the police searched Nunn's house after he died and discovered some old letters in which Nunn talked about killing Trudy and mentioned that he was hired by a man named \\"The Judge\\". Adrian believes Dale knows the identity of \\"The Judge\\", but so far, Dale had not revealed any further information. Monk discovers (in \\"Mr. Monk and the End Part 1\\") that Trudy had left him a videotape, containing a message stating that she wanted him to watch in case harm were to befall her. Later, Monk and Natalie watch the videotape, which reveals that Trudy had a child (born 1983) with her professor, Ethan Rickover, who is now a judge. Rickover hid the baby from Trudy by claiming that she died nine minutes after birth. Then, Monk learns that, in fact, Rickover had saved the baby girl who is now a 26-year- old movie critic named Molly with whom he connects and grows to love.

He was born in Kinshasa, Zaire. On 30 June 2005, he beat the previous \\"No Limits\\" world record in freediving by almost 40 meters by diving to 209 meters. Following his request, this dive was done without the supervision of the International Association for Freediving agency, from which Musimu dissociated since 2002. According to him, extreme deep freediving should not be considered as a sport but as an adventure. Musimu began diving in 1999 at the age of 28, intrigued by what he called \\"dolphin-men\\". His secret lay in years and years of training and preparation, but special attention should be given to his ear clearing technique: instead of equalizing his ears by the regular maneuvers, he flooded his air spaces (sinus and middle ears) with seawater before reaching the depth where ordinary equalization would become hard. He had a lung capacity of 9 litres and could hold his breath for more than 8 min 33 sec. In Stan Lee's Superhumans, a show on the History Channel, Musimu claimed meditation and yoga to be the reason behind his apparent powers of holding breath.

He was cook to the Court of France at the time of the first Valois kings and the Hundred Years' War. His first position was enfant de cuisine (kitchen boy) to Queen Jeanne d'√âvreux. From 1326 he was queux, head chef, to Philip VI. In 1347, he became squire to the Dauphin de Viennois and his queux in 1349. In 1355 he became squire to the Duke of Normandy, in 1359 his queux and in 1361 his serjeant-at-arms. The Duke of Normandy became Charles V in 1368 and Tirel continued in his service. From 1381 he was in service to Charles VI. He is generally considered one of the first truly \\"professional\\" master chefs. He died in 1395 at around 80 years of age. He expanded a collection of recipes as Le Viandier, a famous book on cookery and cookery technique, thought to be one of the first professional treatises written in France and upon which the French gastronomic tradition was founded. It had an inestimable influence on subsequent books on French cuisine and is important to food historians as a detailed source on the medieval cuisine of northern France. During the reign of Philip VI Taillevent was a major influence in the rise of courtly favor for the strong red wines being produced in the south of France as well as those coming out of Burgundy.Johnson, pg. 127 Editions of Le Viandier may be found in the Library of Congress and other public collections Today, many restaurants named \\"Taillevent\\" capitalize on the reputation of Guillaume Tirel. \\"Guillaume Tirel\\" was also the name of a catering business in Brussels (1989‚Äì1999).

She fought primarily in the Battle of the Atlantic as a convoy escort. She was named for Asbestos, Quebec. Background Flower-class corvettes like Asbestos serving with the Royal Canadian Navy during the Second World War were different from earlier and more traditional sail-driven corvettes. The \\"corvette\\" designation was created by the French as a class of small warships; the Royal Navy borrowed the term for a period but discontinued its use in 1877. During the hurried preparations for war in the late 1930s, Winston Churchill reactivated the corvette class, needing a name for smaller ships used in an escort capacity, in this case based on a whaling ship design. The generic name \\"flower\\" was used to designate the class of these ships, which ‚Äì in the Royal Navy ‚Äì were named after flowering plants. Corvettes commissioned by the Royal Canadian Navy during the Second World War were named after communities for the most part, to better represent the people who took part in building them. This idea was put forth by Admiral Percy W. Nelles. Sponsors were commonly associated with the community for which the ship was named. Royal Navy corvettes were designed as open sea escorts, while Canadian corvettes were developed for coastal auxiliary roles which was exemplified by their minesweeping gear. Eventually the Canadian corvettes would be modified to allow them to perform better on the open seas. Construction Asbestos followed the design of the modified Flower-class corvettes and was ordered June 1942 as part of the 1943-44 Flower class building program. The only significant difference is that the majority of the 43-44 program replaced the 2-pounder Mk.VIII single \\"pom-pom\\" anti-aircraft gun with 2 twin 20-mm and 2 single 20-mm anti-aircraft guns. She was laid down on 20 July 1943 by Morton Engineering & Dry Dock Co. at Quebec City, Quebec and launched on 22 November 1943. She was commissioned into the RCN on 16 June 1944 at Quebec City. War service Asbestos arrived at Halifax on 9 July before moving on to Bermuda for working up. Following working up she headed for St John's after being assigned to the Mid-Ocean Escort Force on 21 August. She joined convoy HXF.307 on 10 September as a member of Escort Group C-2. She continued on as a member of this group on convoy duties until the end of the war in Europe. Her only commanding officer was Lieutenant J. Cuthbert, RCNR who was promoted to acting lieutenant commander on 1 January 1945. Fate She was paid off from the RCN on 8 July 1945 and laid up on Sorel, Quebec. She was transferred to the War Assets Corporation and sold to the Dominican Navy in 1947. She was wrecked off Cuba whilst en route on 13 February 1949.

She becomes Adrian Monk's personal assistant midway through season three and is portrayed by Traylor Howard. Traylor Howard was introduced after USA Network released actress Bitty Schram, who portrayed Sharona Fleming, midway through the show's third season, stating they wanted to take the character in new directions. Natalie was hence introduced in the role of Monk's assistant to fill in the void left by Schram's departure. Relationship with Adrian Monk Natalie first meets Monk in the episode \\"Mr. Monk and the Red Herring,\\" after two men break into her house. The first man pretends to be a water meter inspector, but she catches him snooping in the living room; the second man, his accomplice, breaks in during the night. Natalie wakes up and catches him in the act, and as they struggle, she fatally stabs him with a pair of scissors in self-defense. Captain Stottlemeyer and Lieutenant Disher, baffled, suggest that she ask Monk to look into the case. Monk has been without an assistant for three months since Sharona's departure, and he initially mistakes Natalie's inquiry as an expression of interest about the job. She declines at first, but changes her mind after Monk shows kindness toward her daughter Julie over the course of the investigation, a trait that reminds them of Natalie's late husband Mitch. Monk's offer also gives her a chance to leave her current job as a bartender, which she dislikes. The transition from Sharona to Natalie proves to be a rough one, and Monk and Natalie remain uneasy around each other until the end of the episode \\"Mr. Monk Gets Stuck in Traffic.\\" In the novel Mr. Monk and the Two Assistants, Natalie mentions that for a while, Monk, Stottlemeyer and Disher frequently compared her to Sharona, but finally accepted her for who she was. Over the remainder of the series, Natalie becomes both a capable assistant and a devoted friend to Monk. On several occasions, Natalie says explicitly that she loves him, although she most likely means it in a platonic sense. Such an example of this is in \\"Mr. Monk and the Man Who Shot Santa Claus\\". There have been occasions where Natalie is the only person to support Monk's ideas (such as in \\"Mr. Monk and the Other Detective,\\" when Monk suspects loser-private eye Marty Eels of cheating), and she hence proves a valuable ally in helping him gather the evidence needed to make an arrest. She is also shown to be rather cunning, and is able to trick other people into doing things that help Monk with a case. In \\"Mr. Monk and the Bad Girlfriend,\\" when Monk suspects Linda Fusco of murdering her partner, Natalie lures Linda away from her house by pretending to look at an apartment listing, giving Monk time to search her place. Later, at Linda and Stottlemeyer's going away party, Monk and Natalie set up an ingenious sting operation to arrest Linda, where Monk pretends to talk to Natalie from Linda's house on a webcam (though in actuality, he is sitting in the back of an impounded rental truck that Linda had used to trick Monk, Natalie, and Stottlemeyer into supplying her with an airtight alibi).\\"Mr. Monk and the Bad Girlfriend\\" In the season seven episode \\"Mr. Monk and the Bully,\\" when Monk and Natalie are trailing Roderick Brody's wife, Natalie tricks a businessman at a bar into taking a photo of their target. The episode also establishes that she has picked up some basic legal knowledge working with Monk, as evidenced in a scene where Natalie tries to withhold Roderick's name from Captain Stottlemeyer on the grounds of client confidentiality. Despite their platonic relationship, there have been instances throughout the series where other characters believe that Natalie suppresses romantic feelings for Monk through gestures and comments, or even think they are a couple, though Natalie herself tends to be highly amused by the suggestion: for instance, in \\"Mr. Monk and the Class Reunion\\", when Dianne Brooks (Cynthia Stevenson) first spots Monk and Natalie together, Dianne asks \\"Ahhh, oh, so you two aren't...\\" and points between them as if to indicate \\"dating\\"; Natalie grins and firmly replies \\"No!\\" In the season seven episode \\"Mr. Monk Gets Lotto Fever,\\" when Natalie (as a lottery hostess) is signing autographs and Monk grabs some wipes from her, one of Natalie's fans asks her if Monk is her boyfriend, only for Natalie to correct her. In the season six episode \\"Mr. Monk Goes to the Bank,\\" when Monk goes undercover as a guard at his bank to determine which employee might be an inside man, Natalie is impressed enough that she spends several minutes complimenting Monk on his appearance while wearing the uniform. She asks if he will be allowed to keep it after he ends his assignment, mentioning she loved the way her husband looked in his military uniform. Over the course of her relationship with Monk, Natalie is shown to also pick up a few detective instincts of her own on the way. In fact, in the novel Mr. Monk in Outer Space, Stottlemeyer asks Natalie to try to figure out what happened at one crime scene, and she makes an accurate guess of what happened (without making much of an effort, mostly because this particular murder happened to be a straightforward shooting). By the time of the novel Mr. Monk and the Dirty Cop, Natalie has picked up enough skills to start asking herself questions about the case at hand. In the 2011 novel Mr. Monk on the Couch, a subplot has Natalie attempting to figure out the identity of a man found dead in a seedy hotel room with a phony ID. Monk and the police are not interested in pursuing the case, given that said man is determined to have died of natural causes. At the same time, Natalie helps Monk investigate a series of violent knifings occurring in the general vicinity of her neighborhood. Biographic notes Natalie's past is filled with instances of youthful devilry, in a seeming deviation from her strict posh upbringing. Certain elements of her backstory are revealed in a number of different novels and episodes: *In the season three episode \\"Mr. Monk Goes to Vegas\\", Natalie reveals that she worked as a blackjack dealer in Las Vegas for two years while Mitch was still alive, and she is a recovering gambling addict. At the time her husband died, she lived in base housing on a base in South Carolina. *In the season four episode \\"Mr. Monk Goes to the Office\\", Natalie mentions to Monk that she worked in an office for two weeks before quitting; she claimed she was unable to stand the \\"same routine\\" every day, and she tells stock analyst Warren Kemp that she spent time in a jail in Vermont for throwing a man through a window in order to protect a friend. *In the season four episode \\"Mr. Monk and the Secret Santa\\", it is mentioned that the summer after she completed high school, Natalie worked in a shopping mall where her boss \\"liked [her] a bit too much.\\" Natalie uses this to convince her old boss to hire Monk and her as respectively a store Santa and his elf in an attempt to bring missing criminal Frank Prager out of hiding. *During a conversation between Monk and Natalie in the season five episode \\"Mr. Monk Goes to a Rock Concert\\", Natalie mentions having studied about how the Spanish Inquisition locked people in outhouses as a form of torture, after Monk likens accidentally locking himself into a port- a-potty to a medieval torture device. *In the season five episode \\"Mr. Monk Is At Your Service\\", it is revealed that Paul Buchanan (Sean Astin), a neighbor just up the road from Natalie's parents, had a crush on Natalie through high school. Monk, undercover as Paul's butler, is shocked when Paul tells him that Natalie has a tattoo stamped on her lower back. However, Natalie is disgusted with Paul Buchanan, as he stalked her through high school and she believes he was responsible for beating up her senior prom date, leading her to think that he is responsible for murdering his parents. *In the season six episode \\"Mr. Monk and the Naked Man\\", it is revealed that Natalie was an exchange student in Greece when she was 19 years old and was a nudist for the duration of her stay. *In the season six episode \\"Mr. Monk and the Three Julies\\", Natalie mentions that Mitch took her to a firing range all the time, so she knows how to use a gun. This would give the impression that Natalie has good aim, but her experience in using loaded firearms is called into question in the season seven episode \\"Mr. Monk on Wheels\\", where she accidentally discharges a round into Monk's leg after picking up Sarah Longson's pistol. *In the season seven premiere episode \\"Mr. Monk Buys a House\\", it is revealed that Natalie knows Morse code. When Captain Stottlemeyer and Lieutenant Disher accompany Monk and Natalie to Cassie Drake's house, Stottlemeyer and Disher amuse themselves by tapping Morse code messages on the front door. Natalie immediately chastises both of them, telling them \\"That's not the way I heard it. My husband was in the Navy, remember?\\" This knowledge proves useful later, as when Monk and Natalie are taken hostage by \\"Honest\\" Jake Phillips, with no form of communication to the outside world to call for help available, Natalie lights some rags, puts them in the fireplace, and opens and closes the flue to emit smoke signals that Stottlemeyer and Disher (who are a few blocks away) notice and interpret as Morse for \\"SOS\\" (although Randy almost misinterprets the signals as a soda advertisement). Natalie has held several jobs, including bartending, which she quit to become Monk's assistant. The exact number of jobs Natalie held before meeting Monk (17 in all) is mentioned in \\"Mr. Monk Goes to a Wedding\\" when Peggy asks her to sample a Bloody Mary, and Natalie has to remind her that she isn't bartending any more. It takes Peggy a few tries to get the current job right. During her tenure on the series, Natalie does temporarily take up several other careers: *In \\"Mr. Monk Gets Lotto Fever,\\" she spends approximately two weeks working as a lottery hostess, but she is accused of scheming with Stottlemeyer to rig the lottery drawing. She quits after Monk clears their names. While working on this job, Natalie's position as Monk's assistant becomes strained, leaving her unable to concentrate on Monk's homicide investigation. Eventually, Monk becomes so fed up with her lottery antics and autograph signings that he openly mocks her in front of her fans and nearly calls her a bimbo (he stops midway and instead calls her a \\"bimportant person\\"). *In \\"Mr. Monk and the Badge\\", after Monk gets reinstated, Natalie works as assistant to a concert promoter, though Monk warns her that her new boss won't be as good as him. Family Natalie is a member of the wealthy Davenport family, owners of Davenport Toothpaste, described in the episode \\"Mr. Monk, Private Eye\\" as being the third largest toothpaste company in the world after Colgate and Crest, which was started by Natalie's entrepreneur grandfather Neville Davenport, a former assistant pharmacist. The novel Mr. Monk in Outer Space also reveals that this business almost went under when it was discovered that the original formula for their toothpaste was laced with sugar, thus hastening dental decay. However, Natalie is not on good terms with her family, being more or less a pariah. Her decision to marry a \\"common\\" man like Mitch estranged her from her parents Bobby and Peggy Davenport; for years, Peggy refuses to display Natalie and Mitch's wedding photograph at her house on top of the piano where all the other photos are kept, and she considered Natalie's marriage \\"illegitimate\\" even though she and the rest of the family dote on Julie. To further keep herself from the rest of her family, Natalie retained Mitch's surname as her own after his death. She keeps her family ties so secret that in \\"Mr. Monk Goes to a Wedding\\", Monk, Stottlemeyer and Disher are surprised to learn about Natalie's family. Natalie has a brother, Jonathan, whom she and Monk rescue from his murderous new wife, Theresa, who married him to get at the family fortune, in \\"Mr. Monk Goes to a Wedding\\", after they prove that Theresa also tried running down Lieutenant Disher in the parking lot because Randy would have recognized her as Darlene Coolidge, a black widow bride who Randy investigated when he was a sergeant in Philadelphia. Natalie subdues Theresa at the wedding, saving her brother's life. This seems to spark a reconciliation between Natalie and the rest of her family, as she and Monk are seen later having lunch with Natalie's parents during their next on-screen appearance, in the season five episode \\"Mr. Monk Is At Your Service\\". Mitch was a Navy fighter pilot who was killed in Kosovo in 1998 (\\"Mr. Monk and the Election\\"). They have a daughter named Julie, a teenager (she is 11 when she is introduced in \\"Mr. Monk and the Red Herring\\"). Julie has been taught to believe that her father died heroically, though in reality, the details of his death are very murky and unclear, and he may have been trying to desert when he was killed, as Natalie mentions in the season three episode \\"Mr. Monk and the Election\\" and in the novel Mr. Monk Goes to Hawaii. Before he died, Mitch gave Julie a pet fish named \\"Mr. Henry,\\" which Natalie has secretly replaced each year (as that is the lifespan of the fish, a crimson marble) so that Julie does not realize that the original fish died.\\"Mr. Monk and the Red Herring\\" In the episode during which Monk first meets Natalie, he shows that the fish is more important to him than a valuable moon rock, which is part of what causes Natalie to decide to work for Monk. She renews her friendship with Mitch's old friend and comrade, Lieutenant Steven Albright (Casper Van Dien) in the season seven episode \\"Mr. Monk Is Underwater\\", and in the series finale, \\"Mr. Monk and the End\\", the two are dating steadily and Natalie is planning to introduce him to Julie for the first time. Novel series Since midway through season 4, a series of novels based on the TV series has been written by the show writers, first by Lee Goldberg up until the end of 2012, and then by Hy Conrad from 2013 to 2015. In the novels, Natalie serves as the narrator, making analogies between herself and Dr. Watson, as most of the Sherlock Holmes stories were written from Dr. Watson's point-of-view. In the first few novels, Natalie has an on-again, off-again romance with a firefighter named Joe Cochran, whom she first meets when Julie asks Monk to investigate the killing of a beloved firehouse dog in Mr. Monk Goes to the Firehouse. The two are strongly attracted to each other, but Natalie decides not to grow too close to another man in a dangerous job. Cochran subsequently also appeared in Mr. Monk and the Two Assistants and Mr. Monk in Outer Space. The novels also expand on Natalie's background prior to when she met Monk. In Mr. Monk is Miserable (set sometime during season 6), it is known that she and Mitch went to Paris, and in Mr. Monk Goes to Hawaii (set sometime prior to or during season 5), it is revealed that they also once spent a weekend getaway in Mexico, and she is found to be very unnerved when hack psychic Dylan Swift somehow manages to get information on her past to create \\"messages\\" from Mitch's \\"spirit\\". It also establishes that Mitch was shot down two days before his 27th birthday. In Mr. Monk and the Two Assistants, Natalie has an epiphany ‚Äì she notes that with the exception of the fact that Monk has OCD, they are actually not that different ‚Äì both have lost their spouses (Mitch and Trudy, respectively) to fiery deaths (plane crash and car bomb), and they were both heavily affected by their spouse's death (Monk considerably more than Natalie), and they were only saved thanks to someone close to them (Julie in Natalie's case; Stottlemeyer, Disher, and Dr. Kroger in Monk's case). The novels set after \\"Mr. Monk and the End (both parts)\\" also build on Natalie's character. They establish that Natalie has built up considerable detective skills after years of working alongside Monk, enough that in Mr. Monk on the Couch she is convinced that there is something afoot about a man who died of natural causes in a hotel while using a fake identity, and subsequently goes on an investigation to find out his real identity and the locations of his surviving family members, while Monk is focused on a triple homicide investigation. In Mr. Monk on Patrol, Randy, now police chief of Summit, New Jersey, becomes acting mayor of the town after most of the city government is indicted by the FBI for corruption. He summons Monk and Natalie to Summit to temporarily provide additional assistance to Randy's small police force. After exposing two of Randy's own officers as corrupt in their own way, Randy has Monk and Natalie deputized to replace the corrupt cops and patrol the streets full-time. Following a two-week stint as official officers, Monk makes the decision to continue consulting in San Francisco, while Natalie decides that she will stay in Summit and continue working for Randy. Subsequently, in Mr. Monk Is a Mess, Monk and Natalie return to San Francisco, with Natalie making a temporary visit to get her affairs in order. However, upon entering her house, she finds a dead woman named Michelle Keeling in her bathtub, who apparently committed suicide by slicing her throat with Mitch's shaving razor. There is also several thousand dollars in money under Natalie's mattress. Monk and Natalie get into further trouble when the money turns out to be marked money from an FBI sting operation that was stolen from an FBI evidence locker. In a sting to capture some operatives who attempted to kidnap and kill Ambrose's girlfriend Yuki, Monk and Natalie manage to single-handedly recover the money and expose the FBI agent who carried out the theft. In Mr. Monk Gets Even, Natalie is working full-time for Summit's police force. Since the murder that Monk solved in On Patrol, her life as a patrol officer has become pretty dull, with the most serious crime she's faced being thieves stealing bulk loads of laundry detergent. Adrian's brother Ambrose is preparing to marry Yuki, so Natalie is making plans to fly to San Francisco to attend the ceremony. At the same time, Adrian is being assisted by Julie as he investigates a set of three murders cleverly disguised as accidents that he has linked to computer magnate Cleve Dobbs, while he simultaneously tries to track down Dale \\"the Whale\\" Biederbeck after Dale undergoes a bypass operation and subsequently appears to escape amidst the chaos of a truck-bus-cable car collision. After Adrian, Julie and Stottlemeyer are almost killed by Dale's girlfriend Stella Chaze when she suicide-bombs her house in a staged gas explosion, Natalie flies back a day early and assists Monk for the remainder of the investigation. After Dale is recaptured and the Cleve Dobbs case is closed, Natalie decides to rejoin Monk in San Francisco. Starting in Mr. Monk Helps Himself, Natalie studies for a private investigations licensing exam. Subsequently, in Mr. Monk Gets on Board, she and Monk officially open their own private-eye business called Monk and Teeger, Consulting Detectives; with Natalie technically serving as Monk's boss. Background information and notes *Natalie's age is never mentioned in the series. The best estimate of her age is given in \\"Mr. Monk and the Buried Treasure,\\" Troy Kroger's pals Ridley and Pez guess her to be roughly 34. Since Traylor Howard was 38 years old when the first episodes featuring Natalie were aired, and given that Julie is 15 years old in \\"Mr. Monk and the Birds and the Bees\\", Natalie's age could be anywhere from 33 and 40 in \\"Mr. Monk and the Red Herring\\", about the same age as her actress. *Natalie's parents' first names are Bobby and Peggy, which appear to be an in-show reference to the first names of Traylor Howard's real parents (Robert M. Howard and Peggy Traylor). *Natalie has appeared in more episodes (87) of the series than Sharona (37). *Compared to Sharona, Natalie has driven at least six different cars in the course of the series. How she can afford to switch cars so frequently, given her very low salary, is never explained: **A silver 2005 Nissan Quest in \\"Mr. Monk Gets Cabin Fever\\" **A silver 2005 Jeep Grand Cherokee from \\"Mr. Monk and the Red Herring\\" in season 3 to \\"Mr. Monk Is on the Air\\" in season 5 **A silver 2007 Buick Lucerne in the second half of season five, from \\"Mr. Monk and the Leper\\" through \\"Mr. Monk Goes to the Hospital\\". This appears to have been the result of product placement as Buick had been one of the show's major sponsors. **A 2007 Ford Escape for the length of season six **A 2008 Audi A3 for the first half of season seven, from \\"Mr. Monk Buys a House\\" to \\"Mr. Monk Gets Hypnotized\\" **A 2008 Nissan Sentra for three episodes in the middle of season seven: \\"Mr. Monk and the Miracle\\", \\"Mr. Monk's Other Brother\\" and \\"Mr. Monk on Wheels\\" **A 2008 Hyundai Genesis during the later part of season seven and the length of season 8, beginning in \\"Mr. Monk and the Lady Next Door\\" **In the novel Mr. Monk and the Dirty Cop, Monk and Natalie are hired by Intertect, a private investigation agency, and as part of Natalie's benefits plan, she drives a company car, in addition to receiving a higher salary and dental insurance. The color and model of the car are never explained in detail. **In \\"Mr. Monk and the Three Julies,\\" Natalie \\"borrows\\" Captain Stottlemeyer's new car, a midnight onyx Dodge Charger, becoming a very reckless driver. The first time Natalie does this (due to Stottlemeyer making the mistake of trusting her and Monk to hold his car keys), she breaks the passenger-side mirror, leaving it dangling precariously by a few cables; the second time, she completely smashes the hood after supposedly taking a shortcut across the creek, even though Stottlemeyer insists that there are no bridges across the creek, which Natalie clearly acknowledges awareness of. The damage gets worse when an errant bullet enters and ruins the car's engine block due to Monk diverting a sharpshooter's rifle as he fired. *During several episodes of season five (\\"Mr. Monk Makes a Friend,\\" \\"Mr. Monk Is At Your Service,\\" \\"Mr. Monk Visits a Farm,\\" \\"Mr. Monk and the Really, Really Dead Guy\\" and \\"Mr. Monk Goes to the Hospital\\"), Traylor Howard was pregnant with her son Sabu. Hence, during these episodes, it is easy to notice that scenes with Natalie were redone to hide the abnormal bulge in her stomach in these episodes, such as having her wearing long trenchcoats, carrying boxes, newspapers, a bag, or something large, or sitting/standing behind something like a counter or a desk. For instance, in \\"Mr. Monk Is At Your Service\\", when Monk and Natalie are at the crash site, Natalie is seen leaning against her car in close-ups with the driver's side door open to hide her stomach. In a rare exception, later in the episode, Traylor's real pregnant frame is revealed, when Natalie pretends to be pregnant by stuffing a pillow down her shirt so as to avoid advances from Paul Buchanan (Sean Astin). Noticeably, Natalie is not positioned in such ways as to hide her stomach in \\"Mr. Monk Is on the Air\\", because (as can be determined from Natalie's clothing, her car model, and a calendar for July 2006 when Monk and Natalie are in Max Hudson's bedroom) that episode was filmed alongside the eight episodes in the first half of the fifth season, all filmed before Traylor's pregnancy began to show. *Between the novels and the episodes, there are only three times in the entire series that Natalie holds a gun, and all three times they are someone else's weapon: the first is in \\"Mr. Monk Is At Your Service,\\" where she and Monk train twelve-gauge shotguns on Paul Buchanan (Natalie grabs Buchanan's shotgun when he is distracted by Monk's sudden arrival). The second time is in \\"Mr. Monk on Wheels,\\" when Natalie grabs Sarah Longson's Walther PPK handgun during a fight to subdue her, and accidentally shoots Monk when she turns around. The third time happens in Mr. Monk and the Dirty Cop, when she manages to grab Nick Slade's pistol and train it on him.

It is bordered by the Tolfa and Sabatini mountains to the north, the Alban Hills to the southeast, and the Tyrrhenian Sea to the southwest. The rivers Tiber and Aniene run through the area. History During the Ancient Roman period, it was an important agricultural and residential area, but it was abandoned during the Middle Ages due to malaria and insufficient water supplies for farming needs. The pastoral beauty of the Campagna inspired the painters who flocked into Rome in the 18th and 19th centuries. During that time, the Campagna became the most painted landscape in Europe (see Gallery below). An excursion into the Roman countryside was an essential part of the Grand Tour. The region was reclaimed in the 19th and 20th centuries for use in mixed farming, and new settlements have been built. Starting with the 1950s, the expansion of Rome destroyed large parts of the Campagna, all around the city. The only continuous green area where the natural resources of the region were saved from overbuilding is along the Appian Way.

Service history Cressy, named after the 1346 Battle of Cr√©cy, was laid down by Fairfield Shipbuilding at their shipyard in Govan, Scotland on 12 October 1898 and launched on 4 December 1899. After finishing her sea trials she passed into the fleet reserve at Portsmouth on 24 May 1901. She was commissioned by Captain Henry Tudor for service on the China Station on 28 May 1901, but her departure was delayed for several months when her steering gear broke down shortly after leaving the base and she had to return. She eventually left home waters in early October 1901, arriving at Colombo on 7 November, and then Singapore on 16 November. She was assigned to the North America and West Indies Station from 1907 through 1909 and placed in reserve upon her return home.Silverstone, p. 224 The ship was assigned to the 7th Cruiser Squadron shortly after the outbreak of World War I in August 1914. The squadron was tasked with patrolling the Broad Fourteens of the North Sea in support of a force of destroyers and submarines based at Harwich which protected the eastern end of the English Channel from German warships attempting to attack the supply route between England and France. During the Battle of Heligoland Bight on 28 August, the ship was part of Cruiser Force 'C', in reserve off the Dutch coast, and saw no action.Corbett, pp. 100, 171‚Äì72 After the battle, Rear Admiral Arthur Christian ordered Cressy to take aboard 165 unwounded German survivors from the badly damaged ships of Commodore Reginald Tyrwhitt's Harwich Force.

She fired one torpedo at 06:20 at Aboukir which struck her on the starboard side; the ship's captain thought he had struck a mine and ordered the other two ships to close to transfer his wounded men. Aboukir quickly began listing and capsized around 06:55 despite counterflooding compartments on the opposite side to right her.Massie, p. 133 As Hogue approached her sinking sister, her captain, Wilmot Nicholson, realized that it had been a submarine attack and signaled Cressy to look for a periscope although his ship continued to close on Aboukir as her crew threw overboard anything that would float to aid the survivors in the water. Having stopped and lowered all her boats, Hogue was struck by two torpedoes around 06:55. The sudden weight loss of the two torpedoes caused U-9 to broach the surface and Hogues gunners opened fire without effect before the submarine could submerge again. The cruiser capsized about ten minutes after being torpedoed and sank at 07:15.Massie, pp. 133‚Äì35 Cressy attempted to ram the submarine, but did not succeed and resumed her rescue efforts until she too was torpedoed at 07:20. Weddigen had fired two torpedoes from his stern tubes, but only one hit. U-9 had to maneuver to bring her bow around with her last torpedo and fired it at a range of about at 07:30. The torpedo struck on the port side and ruptured several boilers, scalding the men in the compartment. As her sisters had done, Cressy took on a heavy list and then capsized before sinking at 07:55. Several Dutch ships began rescuing survivors at 08:30 and were joined by British fishing trawlers before Tyrwhitt and his ships arrived at 10:45. From all three ships 837 men were rescued and 62 officers and 1,397 enlisted men lost:Massie, p. 135 560 of those lost were from Cressy. In 1954 the British government sold the salvage rights to all three ships to a German company and they were subsequently sold again to a Dutch company which began salvaging the wrecks' metal in 2011.

It is to be distinguished from a title shared among cadets, borne as a courtesy title by a peer's relatives, or acquired through marriage.  Characteristics  * The title is officially borne by only one person at a time: ** e.g. British peerages or \\"Charles, Prince of Wales\\" vs. \\"Princes William and Harry of Wales\\". * The title may continue to be borne by the grantee, with authorization of the head of the house, whether the country is a monarchy or a republic.Pierre-Yves Monette, Beroep: Koning der Belgen, 2003 * The title may be drawn from any rank, but a royal titleholder's precedence derives independently from kinship to the sovereign (e.g. royal duke); \\"Duke\\" is frequent, but lower titles have often been borne by dynasts and pretenders.Earl of Wessex, Count of Barcelona or Count of Flanders * The title may or may not belong to the noble hierarchy of the country if borne by a member of its ruling dynasty, e.g., the Prince of Orange, modern title of the heir to the Dutch throne, although Orange has never been part of the Netherlands. * The title may or may not belong to the hereditary nobility of the recipient's country (e.g. Duke of York, Prince of Wales), may or may not be heritable (e.g. Duke of Aosta, Duke of Bergamo), and is often conferred in conjunction with a special occasion.  Current monarchies  The main titles of heirs apparent to a monarchy are treated as substantive titles. * ‚Äì Duke of Brabant * ‚Äì Marquis of Baux (must be conferred and may be conferred on a male heir presumptive) * ‚Äì Prince of Orange * ‚Äì Prince of Asturias (may be held by the heir presumptive) * ‚Äì Prince of Wales (must be conferred by monarch) * ‚Äì Duke of Cornwall (restricted to eldest son of monarch) * ‚Äì Duke of Rothesay (restricted to eldest son of monarch) Of European dynasties, Denmark, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, and Norway do not grant substantive titles to family members.  Granted titles  In countries where titles have been inherited by primogeniture, these are substantive titles (e.g. France, Portugal, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the titles of sovereigns in Europe post-1800). These may be contrasted with titles inherited by all sons or male-line descendants of the original grantee (Austria, Bohemia, Germany except Prussia, Hungary, Poland, Russia and some titles in Belgium, Italy, the Netherlands and Scandinavia). Although official, titles shared by members of a dynasty are non-substantive, the Almanach de Gotha historically recording them as prefixes to the given name, whereas substantive titles usually followed the titleholder's given name. Substantive titles are often granted to royalty in honour of an important dynastic occasion: with the baptism of a new dynast, coming of age, or an approved wedding. Recent examples include Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex. The Almanach de Gotha treated similarly titles used by dynasties of abolished monarchies: the head of the house bearing a traditional title of the dynasty in lieu of or after the given name (e.g. Duarte Pio, Duke of Braganza), while cadets shared a princely title as prefix in addition to any suffixed substantive title accorded them as individuals by the head of the house (e.g. Infante Miguel, Duke of Viseu and Prince Aimone, Duke of Apulia). =Titles of former ruling houses= In accordance with a tradition dating back to the reign of Napoleon I, titles in pretence were treated by the Almanach de Gotha as if still borne by members of reigning dynasties, with the exception that titles exclusively borne by monarchs (e.g. Emperor, King, Queen, Grand Duke {Grossherzog}), their consorts, and heirs (Crown Prince, Hereditary Prince) were restricted to the last dynast who held the title during the monarchy and borne for the duration of their lifetimes. The spouse of a monarch, heir apparent or titleholder may or may not share usage of the substantive title, but when this is the case the spouse holds the title derivatively (e.g., Carlos Zurita, Duke of Soria). In European monarchies the dynastic wife of a male monarch shares her husband's rank and bears the female equivalent of his title (i.e., Empress, Queen, Grand Duchess, Duchess or Princess). The husband of a female monarch, however, does not acquire the crown matrimonial automatically. Only in Monaco has the male equivalent (Prince) of the dynast's title been conferred upon the husband of an heiress presumptive since the nineteenth century. In the medieval era, the husband of a female sovereign in Europe usually took the title, rank and authority of his wife jure uxoris. Later, the husbands of queens regnant were usually, but not automatically, elevated to the wife's ruling status, sometimes as co-King and sometimes as King consort (e.g. John III of Navarre, Philip II of Spain, Francis II of France, Henry, Lord Darnley (later Duke of Rothesay, etc.), William III, Pedro III of Portugal, Ferdinand II of Portugal, Francis II of Spain), etc. See also * Cadet (genealogy) * Ennoblement * Hereditary peer * Jure uxoris * Peerages in the United Kingdom * Subsidiary title * Territorial designation References Category:Titles Category:European royalty ","title":"Substantive title"},{"id":"2447666","text":"The Saint John Paul II National Shrine is a national shrine in Washington, D.C., sponsored by the Knights of Columbus. It is a place of prayer for Catholics and welcomes people of all faiths. The Shrine houses a permanent exhibit called A Gift of Love: the Life of Saint John Paul II and is home to the Redemptor Hominis Church and Luminous Mysteries Chapel, both of which are decorated with mosaic art designed by Rev. Marko Rupnik, S.J. Mass is celebrated daily in the Redemptor Hominis Church, and the Luminous Mysteries Chapel houses a first-class relic of John Paul II. The building is built on 12 acres (4.9 ha) adjacent to The Catholic University of America and the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception in the Brookland neighborhood of Northeast Washington. History Although they are two separate projects, the building which now is the Saint John Paul II National Shrine historically housed the Pope John Paul II Cultural Center. The idea for the center originated at a meeting in 1989 between Pope John Paul II and then- Bishop Adam Maida, the Bishop of Green Bay. Maida had proposed an institution similar to a U.S. presidential library be built in honor of the pope; the pope instead suggested a center for exploring interfaith issues. The cultural center was envisioned as a museum and Catholic think tank which would explore the intersection of faith and culture through interactive displays, academic discussion and research, and museum exhibits. In 1990 Maida was appointed Archbishop of Detroit, and he set to work raising funds. About $50 million was raised from several thousand donors. The Archdiocese lent $17 million directly to the center and also guaranteed its $23 million mortgage. Construction of the complex cost $75 million. The center was opened to the public in a ceremony in March 2001, attended by President George W. Bush, several cardinals, members of Congress and other dignitaries. While academic discussions and special events were successful, the Center nonetheless struggled during a slow economy and a drop in tourism to Washington following the September 11 terrorist attacks. The center eventually closed except by appointment, and in 2009, after Cardinal Maida's retirement, the Center was put up for sale. In 2010, the Dominican Sisters of Mary, Mother of the Eucharist indicated a desire to purchase the building for a house of studies, but eventually determined not to acquire the property. = The Knights of Columbus management = On August 2, 2011, Carl Anderson, Supreme Knight of the Knights of Columbus, announced that the Catholic lay family organization would purchase the Cultural Center with the intention of transforming it into a religious shrine dedicated to the memory of then-Blessed John Paul II. Cardinal Donald Wuerl, the Archbishop of Washington, immediately declared the facility a diocesan shrine. The Knights paid $22.7 million, of which $2.7 million went to the Catholic University of America and $20 million to the Archdiocese of Detroit From the beginning of the Knights of Columbus‚Äô sponsorship of the Shrine, Mass was celebrated on a nearly daily basis at the Shrine and a simple temporary exhibit on John Paul II was made available to the public. Over the following 5 years, the Knights of Columbus undertook massive renovations to the facility including the construction of a 16,000 sq. ft. exhibit on the life and legacy of John Paul II and the development of two liturgical spaces on the main floor of the Shrine. On April 14, 2014, the day of John Paul II‚Äôs canonization by Pope Francis, the shrine was elevated to the status of a national shrine pursuant to a vote of the Administrative Committee of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops and renamed the Saint John Paul II National Shrine.  June 2020 controversy  On June 2, 2020, President Donald Trump visited the shrine as part of a prearranged visit coinciding with an executive order on religious freedom. This came one day after President Trump took a photo in front of St. John's Episcopal Church. St. John's had been purposely set on fire the night before by violent protestors who had torn down an American flag that flew from the church around 10pm. The church sustained some damage to the basement. https://www.washingtonpost.com/religion/fire- set-at-historic-st-johns-church-during-protests-of-george-floyds- death/2020/06/01/4b5c4004-a3b6-11ea-b619-3f9133bbb482_story.html Prior to the President's visit, police had to forcibly remove protesters and clergy from Lafayette Square and the street in front of St. John's.https://www.ncronline.org/news/politics/ahead-trump-bible-photo-op- police-forcibly-expel-priest-st-johns-church-near-white Protesters were mourning and protesting the deaths of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor. Despite the fact that the visit was previously scheduled, the Catholic Archbishop of Washington, Wilton Daniel Gregory, condemned the president's June 2nd visit saying \\"I find it baffling and reprehensible that any Catholic facility would allow itself to be so egregiously misused and manipulated in a fashion that violates our religious principles, which call us to defend the rights of all people even those with whom we might disagree.\\"https://adw.org/news/archbishop-wilton-gregory-issues-statement-on- planned-presidential-visit/ Protesters gathered on the road near the shrine ahead of the president's visit.

","title":"Saint John Paul II National Shrine"},{"id":"2447668","text":"Sugar was a British magazine for teenage girls published by Hachette Filipacchi. Its content focused on boys, fashion, celebrities, real-life stories about teenagers and other similar matters. The editor, when it closed, was Annabel Brog. The brand lived on until 2016 through the website sugarscape.com. Aimed at females 16‚Äì24, it was edited by Kate Lucey. Content Sugar dealt with the concerns of teenage girls. The magazine featured an advice column that answers questions sent in by readers, typically dealing with relationships, body image and health issues. Sugar ran a nationwide model competition every year, giving one lucky teen the opportunity to win a modelling contract. On the cover of the main magazine was a female celebrity. Also with the magazine came a free LAD mag, which contained posters and gossip about boys. In 2007, Sugar established a website, \\"Sugarscape\\", which contained celebrity gossip and exclusive competitions and was seen as a brand extension to the magazine. History Sugar magazine was launched in October 1994, published by Attic Futura. The first edition, November 1994, was an immediate success, reaching a circulation of 205,000 exceeding its initial circulation target by 55,000. It soon overtook its main rival, Just Seventeen. Like competing titles at the time, Sugar used explicit sexual editorial to attract readership. This was controversial and contributed to the establishment of the Teenage Magazine Arbitration Panel in 1996. Sales peaked in 1997, after which demand for teen mags generally, Sugar included, began to go into decline due to the rising influence of digital media. In 2002, Attic Futura was bought by Hachette. Sugar finally lost its number one market lead position in 2006 to rival magazine Bliss. In January 2011, Hachette announced its intention to close Sugar magazine in March 2011 as part of a proposed sale of the group's magazine titles to Hearst Corporation, due to the decline of subscribers over the previous five years from 250,099 to 113,320 according to ABC. The website, however, would be retained. In December 2016, Sugarscape.com announced it was closing down. For a time, the domain redirected to Cosmopolitan magazine. Editors The title has had several editors over the years. Founder editor was Kathryn Brown who established the magazine based on the success of Girlfriend that she had helped launch in Australia with the co- founder of Attic Futura, Steve Bush. Former features editor and assistant editor, Marina Gask, took over as editor in November 1996. Sarah Pyper succeeded her following Gask's departure in 1998. Pyper left in August 1999 and was replaced by Jennifer Stringer who had formerly worked on BBC spin-off magazines from TV shows Live & Kicking and Top of the Pops. Following marriage, Jennifer Cawthron, left in 2001 and went on to edit Sneak magazine. Claire Irvin was appointed editor in 2003 having been acting editor since Cawthron's departure. With Irvin's departure in late 2003, Nick Chalmers was appointed acting editor until appointment of former deputy editor of Bliss, Annabel Brog, in 2004.

Forbes (born August 21, 1970) is an American economist. She is the Jerome and Dorothy Lemelson Professor of Management and Global Economics at the MIT Sloan School of Management. Early life The eldest of three children, Forbes was raised in Concord, New Hampshire and attend Concord High School. In 1988, as a high school senior, she was selected as New Hampshire's Presidential Scholar, which gave her the opportunity to meet President Ronald Reagan at a ceremony in the White House Rose Garden. Career After graduating summa cum laude in 1992 with a B.A. with highest honors in Economics from Williams College, Forbes joined the investment banking division of Morgan Stanley as an analyst on Wall Street, New York City. In 1993, she joined the policy research department of the World Bank. While working on a study about Asia, she decided to concentrate on a career in economics. She studied for a Ph.D. at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), during which she spent a summer in New Delhi, India, and then spent three months traveling throughout the country. She completed her Ph.D. in 1998 in international and development economics, and was hired by the MIT Sloan School of Management. While teaching, her post-doctorate studies focused on financial contagion, looking at how it spread from business-to-business. =Treasury department, CEA= In 2001, Forbes was hired by John B. Taylor, then the undersecretary of international affairs at the U.S. Treasury Department, to serve in the Office of International Affairs as the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Quantitative Policy Analysis and Latin American and Caribbean Nations. A year later she returned to MIT to teach and study. In 2003, she was approached by Gregory Mankiw, the head of the Council of Economic Advisors, and after confirmation by the U.S. Senate, she served until 2005 as the youngest-ever member of the President's CEA, in the administration of George W. Bush. =Return to academia= Forbes returned to academia in mid-2005 to take up her current position. She has since been researching financial crises, financial contagion, capital controls, macroprudential regulations, foreign investment and tax holidays. In August 2012 she presented the opening paper at the Federal Reserve's annual symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, on the subject of financial contagion.

It is a form of sex work. Although clients can be any gender, the vast majority are male. Compared to female prostitutes, male prostitutes have been far less studied by researchers. Terminology The terms used for male prostitutes generally differ from those used for females. Some terms vary by clientele or method of business. Where prostitution is illegal or taboo, it is common for male prostitutes to use euphemisms which present their business as providing companionship, nude modeling or dancing, body massage, or some other acceptable fee-for-service arrangement. Thus one may be referred to as a male escort, gigolo (implying female customers), rent boy, hustler (more common for those soliciting in public places), model, or masseur. A man who does not regard himself as gay or bisexual, but who has sex with male clients for money, is sometimes called gay-for-pay or trade. Male clients, especially those who pick up prostitutes on the street or in bars, are sometimes called johns or tricks. Those working in prostitution, especially street prostitutes, sometimes refer to the act of prostitution as turning tricks. History Male prostitution has been found in almost all modern and ancient cultures. The practice in the ancient world of men or women selling sexual services in sacred shrines, or sacred prostitution, was attested to be practiced by foreign or pagan cultures in the Hebrew Bible or Old Testament. Male prostitutes are also attested to in Graeco-Roman culture in the New Testament, among many other ancient sources. Some interpreters consider that in one of the Pauline vice lists, 1 Corinthians 6:9‚Äì10, one of the words malakoi (\\"soft\\") or arsenokoitai (a compound of \\"male\\" and \\"bed\\") refer to male prostitution (or male temple prostitution): this interpretation of arsenokoitai is followed in the New Revised Standard Version. The Encyclopedia of Homosexuality states that prostitutes in ancient Greece were generally slaves. A well known case is Phaedo of Elis who was captured in war and forced into slavery and prostitution, but was eventually ransomed to become a pupil of Socrates; Plato's Phaedo is told from his perspective. Male brothels existed in both ancient Greece and ancient Rome. Court records and vice investigations from as early as the 17th century document male prostitution in what is now the United States. With the expansion of urban areas and the aggregation of gay people into communities toward the end of the 19th century, prostitution became more apparent. Around this time, prostitution was reported to have taken place in brothels, such as the Paresis Hall in the Bowery district of New York and in some gay bathhouses. Solicitation for sex, including paid sex, took place in certain bars between so-called \\"fairies\\". Male street prostitutes solicited clients in specific areas which became known for the trade. Well-known areas for street \\"hustlers\\" have included: parts of 53rd Street in New York City; Santa Monica Boulevard in Los Angeles; Cypress Street in Atlanta; Piccadilly Circus in London; \\"The Wall\\" in Sydney's Darlinghurst; The Drug Store and Rue Sainte-Anne in Paris; Polk Street Gulch in San Francisco; and Taksim Square in Istanbul. Bars such as Cowboys and Cowgirls and Rounds in New York City, Numbers in Los Angeles, and certain go- go bars in Patpong, Thailand were popular venues where male prostitutes offered their services. =Examples= Young male prostitutes in the Edo period of Japan were called kagema. Their clients were mainly adult men. In southern areas of Central Asia and Afghanistan, adolescent males between twelve and sixteen years old perform erotic songs and suggestive dancing and are available as sex workers. Such boys are known as bacch√°. In India, a hijra is a physically male or intersex person who may sometimes enter into prostitution. Not all hijras are prostitutes, however, and many consider themselves to have a female identity in a male body and accept this as a sacred condition or gift. A common tradition in India is that Hijras dress as women and dance at weddings, child births, and other celebrations and demand a large amount of money from the patron. The most famous male prostitute of the Victorian era was the Irish-born John Saul, who was involved in both the 1884 Dublin Castle scandal, and the Cleveland Street Scandal of 1889. Cuban male prostitutes are called jinetero ‚Äì literally \\"horse jockey\\"; female prostitutes are called jinetera. A male sex worker in the Caribbean who solicits on the beaches and accepts clients of either sex is called a sanky-panky. Present- day male prostitution The following categorization of the male prostitute is not exhaustive:A \\"Peep Show\\" along St Catherine street in Montreal's Gay Village. =Online= Professional escorts (indoor sex workers) often advertise on male escorting websites, usually either independently or through an escort agency. Such sites can face legal difficulties; in 2015, Rentboy.com ‚Äì a well-known American site ‚Äì was shut down by the United States Department of Homeland Security and its operators charged with facilitating prostitution and other charges. Recent research suggests a substantial growth in numbers of online escorts worldwide, to the extent that the online market accounts for the vast majority of male sex workers. This has persisted despite anti-sex worker laws like the Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act in the United States, thanks in part to escorting websites based in other countries. =Streets, bars, and clubs= Major cities in Europe and the Eastern Hemisphere often have one or more areas where male street prostitutes regularly make themselves available to potential clients who drive by in cars. Such an area may have a locally-known informal name. These areas tend to be risky for both the client and the prostitute, from a legal perspective when it is in a region where street prostitution or solicitation is prohibited by law, or also from a safety perspective. These areas may be targets for surveillance and arrests by law enforcement. Some male prostitutes solicit potential clients in other public spaces such as bus terminals, parks and rest stops. =Bathhouses and sex clubs= Male prostitutes may attempt to work in gay bathhouses, adult bookstores or sex clubs, but prostitution is usually prohibited in such establishments, and known prostitutes are often banned by management. However, in some places it is overlooked in order to keep the flow of business. =Male brothels= A male prostitute may work in a male brothel, also known in some places as a \\"stable\\". The Cleveland Street scandal of 1889 involved a male brothel in London frequented by aristocrats when male homosexuality was illegal in the United Kingdom. In her biography The First Lady, April Ashley quotes her ex-husband, the late Hon. Arthur Corbett, who worked in the City of London, and was addicted to cross-dressing, as telling her in 1960: \\"There's a male brothel, I pay the boys to dress me up, then masturbate me.\\" In order to work in a legal brothel in Nevada, a cervical exam is required by law, implying that men could not work as prostitutes. In November 2005, Heidi Fleiss said that she would partner with brothel owner Joe Richards to turn Richards' legal Cherry Patch Ranch brothel in Crystal, Nevada, into an establishment that would employ male prostitutes and cater exclusively to female customers, a first in Nevada. However, in 2009, Fleiss said that she had abandoned her plans to open such a brothel. In late 2009, the owner of the Shady Lady Ranch brothel challenged this provision before the Nye County Licensing and Liquor Board and prevailed.\\"Brothel to get the bucks\\", Las Vegas Review-Journal, 2010-01-06 In January 2010, the brothel hired a male prostitute who offered his services to female clients, but he left the ranch a few weeks later. Until 2009, when all prostitution in Rhode Island was outlawed, Rhode Island did not have a law prohibiting male sex workers. In January 2010, the first brothel for gay men in Switzerland was opened in an industrial area of Zurich. =Sex tourism= Female sex tourism Women may travel to specific locations to enjoy a holiday and find a \\"temporary boyfriend\\" who will fill the roles of sexual partner, dining companion, tour guide, or dancing companion/instructor. Women who spend time with male escorts while on vacation may be any age, but are predominantly middle-aged women looking for romance along with their sex.J. S√°nchez Taylor, \\"Marking the Margins: Research in the Informal Economy in Cuba and the Dominican Republic\\" , 1997, Discussion Papers in Sociology, No. S97/1 The rates of HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted infections are high in some Caribbean and African countries which are popular destinations for female sex tourism. There have been reported cases where female clients have been blackmailed by gigolos they visited.\\"Women land in gigolo trap\\", Times of India, December 11, 2006 =Risks= As in all forms of prostitution, male prostitutes and their clients can face risks and problems. For prostitutes, the risks may include: social stigma; legal/criminal risks; physical abuse; health-related risks, such as the potential risk of sexually transmitted diseases (especially high in case of anal sex, less so in case of oral sex); rejection by family and friends; gay bashing (in the case of male-male prostitution); the financial risks that come with having an insecure income; and risks of the mental/emotional effects that come with all of those factors. Teenagers and runaways engaging in sex work have shown to be particularly at risk. A 2008 masters thesis reported that 300,000 male prostitutes were under the age of 16. For clients, risks may include: fear of social stigma and family or work problems if their activities with prostitutes do not remain secret; health- related risks; being robbed; or, very rarely, being blackmailed or injured. German fashion designer Rudolph Moshammer, for example, was killed by a man who said that Moshammer had reneged on a promise to pay him for sex.BBC News, 2005-01-16. Man 'confesses' to Munich murder. If a male prostitute steals from a male client or accepts money without then \\"putting out\\" the agreed-upon sexual services, it is sometimes referred to as \\"rolling a john\\". Research suggests that the degree of violence against male prostitutes is somewhat lower than for female sex workers. Men working on the street and younger men appear to be at greatest risk of being victimized by clients. Conversely, the risk of being robbed or blackmailed posed to clients of sex workers appears to be much lower than many imagine. This is especially true when clients hire sex workers through an established agency or when they hire men who have been consistently well reviewed by previous clients. The pimp is relatively rare in male prostitution in the West, where most prostitutes generally work independently or, less frequently, through an agency. Stigma Factors like the difference in age, in social status and in economic status between the sex worker and his client have been cited as major sources of social criticism.See, for example, European Network Male Prostitution Activity Report, November 2003 , \\"Practical experiences of Men in Prostitution\\" (Sweden, Denmark, Stockholm), pp. 23‚Äì26: \\"All [the] interviewed men [in Denmark] are aware of societies‚Äô negative perception of prostitution and do whatever possible to cover up. As a result they live double lives and create more and more distance from close relations and the wider society. Isolation and sufferance from not having anybody to share prostitution experiences with is profound. Some men describe[d] how the clients are their main or only social relation to society, and consider the relations as sexual friendships or the customers as father figures.\\" Similar social stigma may also be attached to amorous relationships that do not involve direct payment for sexual services, and therefore do not fit the definition of prostitution, but which may be seen by some as a form of \\"quasi\\"-prostitution, (in that there is a power imbalance and a reward for companionship or sex). The older member in such relationships may be referred as a \\"sugar daddy\\" or \\"sugar momma\\"; the young lover may be called a \\"kept boy\\" or \\"boy toy\\".see Dynes, supra, for a discussion of the fine line between \\"kept boys\\" and prostitution. Within the gay community, the members of this kind of couple are sometimes called \\"dad\\" (or \\"daddy\\") and \\"son\\" - without implying incest. The social disdain for age/status disparity in relationships is and has been less pronounced in certain cultures at certain historical times. Help and support for male sex workers Richard Holcomb and James Waterman displaying the \\"Project Weber\\" poster at the 2010 HIV Prevention Summit in Washington, D.C. In the United States and other places, there are few resources and little support readily available for male sex workers working and/or living on the streets. Men and boys in this situation may face many issues. They may be at a higher risk for health problems and abuse. They face greater pressure to engage in unprotected sex than female prostitutes. They are generally paid less than female prostitutes. Male street prostitutes may have issues such as drug addiction. Offering support and health care to such stigmatized people can be difficult due to a reluctance to disclose information about their work to health care professionals, which can also make male prostitutes difficult to identify in order to reach out to. In recent years, some organizations directed specifically at helping male sex workers have been founded and some studies have begun on this little-studied population. For example, Richard Holcomb, a former sex worker, founded \\"Project Weber\\", a harm reduction program in Providence, Rhode Island, that offers resources and support to male sex workers living on the streets, including a needle exchange and HIV testing. Holcomb cited the lack of data available on male commercial sex workers in the region as his reason for helping develop a 2010 survey to assess the needs of this population. Project Weber recruited and surveyed 50 male sex workers living on the streets of Providence. Holcomb cited the fact that he and members of his team are former sex workers themselves as one of the primary reasons why they were able to gain access to the men in order to conduct this survey. The project says they have gleaned valuable data on male sex workers who work and live on the streets of Providence. Holcomb has also created several documentaries meant to draw attention to the subjects of male street prostitution and drug use. Feminist studies The topic of male prostitution has been examined by feminist theorists. Feminist theorists Justin Gaffney and Kate Beverley stated that the insights gained from research on male sex workers in central London allowed comparison between the experiences of the 'hidden' population of male prostitutes and the traditionally subordinate position of women in a patriarchal society. Gaffney and Beverley argue that male sex workers occupy a subordinate position in our society which, as with women, is ensured by hegemonic and patriarchal constructs.Justin Gaffney & Kate Beverley, \\"Contextualizing the Construction and Social Organization of the Commercial Male Sex Industry in London at the Beginning of the Twenty- First Century,\\" Feminist Review, No. 67, Sex Work Reassessed (Spring, 2001), pp. 133‚Äì141. At the same time, other feminists have noted that male sex workers are usually seen as engaging in sex work out of their own free will and for enjoyment much more than female sex workers, who are often perceived to be victims of human trafficking and exploitation, especially by second wave feminist activists. A review of the public discourse and media reactions following the closing of two websites hosting sex work ads - one for women and one for gay men - found that concerns with human trafficking and victimisastion were cited only for the closure of the former. The closure of the latter was attributed to homophobia and conservative religious values. Popular culture The male prostitute has become a literary and cinematic stereotype in the West. He is often portrayed as a tragic figure; examples in film include Oscar-winner Midnight Cowboy (1969) about a tragic would-be gigolo, My Own Private Idaho (1991) about the friendship of two young hustlers, Mandragora (1997) about young runaways who are manipulated into prostitution, and Mysterious Skin (2004) in which a hustler has a history of being molested as a child. The male prostitute may be presented as an impossible object of love or an idealized rebel, such as in The Roman Spring of Mrs. Stone (1961) about a middle-aged woman and a young gigolo in a tragic tryst. Though less frequent in cinema and in novels, the gigolo (a male prostitute with an exclusively female clientele) is generally depicted as less tragic than the gay hustler. In the film American Gigolo, Richard Gere stars as a high-priced gigolo who becomes romantically involved with a prominent politician's wife while simultaneously becoming the prime suspect in a murder case. The comedy-drama TV series Hung (2009‚Äì2011) is about a high school basketball coach who turns to prostitution to deal with financial troubles. Male prostitution is sometimes the subject of derisive humor, such as the slapstick farce Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo (1999) and its sequel (2005).

Kerr was born in Easton, Maryland, and attended the common schools and Easton Academy. He graduated from Harvard University in 1830, studied law further, and was admitted to the bar and commenced practice in Easton in 1833. He served as a member of the State house of delegates from 1836 until 1838, and later as deputy attorney general for Talbot County from 1845 until 1848. Kerr was elected as a Whig to the Thirty-first Congress, serving from March 4, 1849 until March 3, 1851, and was not a candidate for renomination in 1850. He was appointed by President Millard Fillmore Charg√© d'Affaires to Nicaragua on March 7, 1851, and served until July 27, 1853. Kerr resumed the practice of law in Baltimore and St. Michaels, Maryland in 1854. Kerr was appointed one of the solicitors in the Court of Claims in Washington, D.C., and served from February 8, 1864 to June 25, 1868 when the position was abolished. He served as solicitor in the office of the Sixth Auditor of the Treasury Department from November 6, 1869, until his death in Washington, D.C.. From the journal of his daughter, Henrietta Maria Kerr: Papa was born March 1809, and graduated at Harvard University in 1830. Among his classmates were Oliver Wendell Holmes, \\"the Poet of the North\\"; Hon. Charles T. Sumner, and John O. Sargent. On leaving college in 1834 he took a trip to the West Indies and Cuba, and a few years later settled in Easton to practice law. In 1850 he was elected to Congress. The following year he was sent as minister to Central America and remained there nearly three years. On his return from South America Papa settled at St. Michaels, until 1869, when he was appointed a solicitor in the Court of Claims at Washington and removed us all to this city. Our noble, good, kind Father was taken from us very suddenly. On Sunday January 27, 1878, after a few hours illness of Angina Pectoris, he fell asleep, and entered into eternal rest. I never can forget that gray cold Sunday Morning, and the terrible feeling at my heart when I heard the Church bells ring out through the Sabbath stillness, and realized at last that he would never go to Church with us again-a thing he had never missed. He rests in the old family burial ground at Belleville, beside his loved parents and son.-In nature, I think Papa was more nearly perfect than anyone I ever knew. A good loving husband and the sweetest kindest Father, always ready and anxious to entertain and instruct his children, no matter how deeply engaged he might be. He was a scholar and a Christian gentleman, in every sense of that grand old word, and although the latter days of his life were full of cares and troubles, his sunny, kindly nature never changed; even in acute physical pain, he never failed in his loving tender care for us all.

Inro, Design of minute patterns in mother-of-pearl inlay, Somada school characterized by a combination of raden and makie techniques, Edo period, 19th century, Tokyo National Museum is a Japanese term for one of the decorative techniques used in traditional crafts such as Japanese lacquerware and woodwork. It refers to a method of inserting a board-like material, which is a cut out part of the mother of pearl inside the shell, into the carved surface of lacquer or wood, or a craft made by using this method. The kanji for ra (Ëû∫) means shell and den (Èàø) means inlaid. \\"Raden\\" is a term used only for the technique or work of inlaying thin layers of pearl shells. In Japan, the technique to inlay ivory or metal is simply called \\"Ë±°Âµå, zougan or z≈çgan\\" which means inlay. The term may also be used for similar traditional work from Korea or countries in South-East Asia such as Vietnam, or for modern work done in the West. Techniques of production There are many ways that raden is produced, with all techniques classed under three main categories: Atsugai (using thick shell pieces), Usugai (using much thinner pieces), and Kenma (the thinnest application of shell pieces). In Atsugai raden, the shell is often cut with a scroll saw, then finished with a file or rubstone before application. In Usugai raden, the thinner shell pieces are usually made using a template and a special punch. Kenma raden is fashioned similarly to Usugai raden. Methods of application are varied. Thick shell pieces may be inlaid into pre-carved settings, while thinner pieces may be pressed into a very thick coating of lacquer, or applied using an adhesive and then lacquered over. Other methods use acid washing and lacquering to produce different effects. Raden is especially combined with maki-e, gold or silver lacquer sprinkled with metal powder as a decoration. History Raden was imported to Nara period (710‚Äì794) Japan from Tang Dynasty China (618‚Äì907) and was used in mosaics and other items in combination with amber and tortoise shell. Raden developed rapidly in the Heian period (794‚Äì1185), and was used in architecture as well as lacquerware. In the Kamakura period (1185‚Äì1333), raden was a popular saddle decoration. Raden experienced rapid growth through Japan's Azuchi-Momoyama period (1568‚Äì1600), when Japan's borders were still open to the outside world, until the early 17th century, before the isolationism instituted by the Seclusion laws of the Edo period (1600‚Äì1867). The technique was often used in the creation of European-style items, such as chests of drawers and coffee cups, and was very popular in Europe, as the mother-of- pearl covering the items contributed to their status as a unique luxury. The Japanese referred to these goods as \\"Nanban lacquerware\\", with Nanban meaning \\"Southern Barbarians\\", a term borrowed from the Chinese and, in 16th century Japan, meaning any foreigner, especially a European. In Japan's Edo period, raden continued in popularity despite the closing of the European market. Craftsmen necessarily focused on Japanese items. The raden works of a number of famous Edo period craftsmen are still celebrated, namely those of T≈çshichi Ikushima, Ch≈çbei Aogai, and Somada brothers. After the Opening of Japan to foreign trade in the 1850s, raden work for export markets soon became significant again. Raden is widespread in Japan today, and is made for many applications, modern and classic.

Bertie was born in Gainsborough, Lincolnshire, the second eldest son of Willoughby Bertie, 3rd Earl of Abingdon and Anna Maria Collins. On 29 January 1759, he matriculated at Magdalen College, Oxford and received his MA on 29 May 1761. Bertie was a music patron and composer, as well as a political writer. His brother-in-law Giovanni Gallini brought him into contact with J.C. Bach and Carl Friedrich Abel, and he was subsequently very involved in their careers. During his time in England (1791‚Äì1792, 1794‚Äì1795), Abingdon was a patron of Haydn's, who may have encouraged him to compose.Simon Towneley (with Derek McCulloch). \\"4th Earl of Abingdon\\", Grove Music Online, ed.

The unusual name came from instructions to his stable boy to write the horse's intended name, Potato, on its feed bin, and the boy instead wrote out \\"Pot\\" with eight o's. The joke greatly amused Bertie and he decided to make the name official. Abingdon earned himself the reputation of a political maverick. His obituary in the Gentleman's Magazine remarked that \\"his frequent speeches in the House of Peers were peculiarly eccentric\\". An outspoken critic of Lord North and his administration, he rigorously defended the liberties of the American colonies, yet denounced the French Revolution as a threat to \\"the Peace, the Order, the Subordination, the Happiness of the whole habitable Globe.\\" He argued that the movement for the abolition of the slave trade was simply the result of a \\"new philosophy\\" inspired by the new French republic. When his elder brother James died in a fire at Rycote in 1745, Bertie became his father's heir, succeeding him as 4th Earl of Abingdon on 10 June 1760. In 1761, he sold the manor of West Lavington, Wiltshire to Robert Palmer and Thomas Walker, and in 1762, he sold the manor of Frilsham, Berkshire to George Amyand. He married Charlotte Warren, daughter of Admiral Sir Peter Warren, on 7 July 1768. Lady Abingdon died 28 January 1794.

Based on a true story, Dunst portrays a 15-year-old pregnant girl. It was premiered on Lifetime in 1998. Plot The film commences with 14-year-old Tina having sex with her new boyfriend, Ray. Ray later ends his relationship with Tina, telling her that he must focus upon his athletic goals. When Tina discovers that she has started her period, she is extremely relieved. On Tina's birthday, she is despondent because another birthday has passed and she does not have a boyfriend. Tensions arise between Tina and her mother when they are in the car together and listen to a radio program where the commentator makes remarks about the high number of teenagers getting pregnant. Tina's mother asks her daughter if she knows anyone who is sexually active, or if she has ever been sexually active. Tina is evasive and gives a non-committal response. She and her friend Laurie, a young mother who became pregnant at seventeen, attend a sexual health clinic where it is confirmed that Tina is carrying a child. It all comes to a head when Laurie tells Tina to tell her mother about the pregnancy. Her mother, a conservative Christian, is shocked but due to her beliefs, decides to help her daughter. Her dad is less upset and comforts his daughter. When Tina tells Ray, he feigns happiness. Tina begins pregnancy classes with her mother. After hearing a story from a girl about how hard teenage motherhood is and how her boyfriend cheated on her, Tina calls Ray and yells at him because she thinks he won't be a good father like he promised he would be. For a while she tries to make him stay with her, but when Ray isn't as present as she would like him to be, Tina goes investigating and while at the mall she finds Ray kissing another girl, cheating on her. She is upset and tells him she is over him and ends their relationship. Throughout the stressful pregnancy, Tina's younger sister Rachel reacts with both disgust and jealousy by the attention Tina receives from her concerned parents. Even when Rachel breaks her ankle Tina receives more attention, for example Rachel is made to get off a couch because Tina was lying there, and is made to go upstairs on her crutches to be able to lie down. Eventually Rachel calls their grandmother to ask permission to live with her. As the pregnancy becomes more and more overwhelming, Tina is rushed to the hospital and is about to give birth when her mother has a panic attack on how her daughter is going to have a baby. When Tina is in labor, Ray shows up at the hospital with his new girlfriend only to be turned away by Tina's father, telling him \\"sperm doesn't entitle you to much\\" and making him go to the waiting room. After a grueling labor, Tina gives birth to a baby boy whom she names Caleb, and meets her younger sister and grandmother outside the hospital where they all have a small family reunion.

It lies within the Ards and North Down Borough and is the easternmost settlement in Ireland. It had a population of 2,122 people in the 2011 Census. The town has a modern harbour, housing a large fishing fleet catching mainly prawns and herrings. Most evenings there are fish auctions on the quays. Three murals on the exterior of the local school celebrate the history of the fishing industry in the town. History In about 1555 there was a settlement at Stable Hole to the north of where Portavogie now stands, at the bottom of what is now the Warnocks Road. The site was chosen for the shelter provided by the surrounding rocks and the sandy shore on which the inhabitants could beach their boats; they existed on what they could grow and catch. This was the first settled area south of Ballyhalbert (Talbot's Town) and in the main the inhabitants were families of fishermen who had travelled from across the Irish Sea from the Solway Coast. In those days the Ardes was an area of marsh land and bog and was in a world of its own to the rest of Ireland. Public records from 1620 name the area as Portabogagh from the Gaelic Port a' Bhogaigh. As with all names, pronunciation leads to different spelling and in time this became Portavogie, this spelling first recorded in 1810. With no strategic benefit in developing Portavogie the Anglo-Normans ignored the immediate area and concentrated on developing the castles at Quintin, Ardkeen, Portaferry and Ballygalget. The entrance to Strangford Lough became a strategic defence area and was rich in seafish providing a ready source of food. Mural depicting fishing history on the side of Portavogie School. Commissioned by Ards Arts in 2001 by artists Gary Drostle and Rob Turner. Portavogie was protected from the east by the Irish Sea and to the west by the \\"Bogs\\", an area still known as that today. The route north to Newtownards was low lying and subject to regular flooding at spring tide. At one time there were 82 windmills the length of the Ards Peninsula; this must have looked as the Netherlands does today and probably gave rise to the epithet \\"Little Holland\\". The Savage family had controlled the Ards from around 1200 but did little to improve the area, instead concentrating on securing their ownership and defences. Following a series of failed military expeditions aimed at dislodging the Scots from Ulster, Queen Elizabeth I agreed to support an English colonial settlement in the region. In 1571 Sir Thomas Smith, the Queen's Principal Secretary of State, was given a royal grant in Clandeboye and the Ards Peninsula. Smith envisaged a settlement led by the younger sons of Englishmen who would develop the urban and commercial infrastructure of the Ards and exploit its natural resources of fish and timber. The indigenous Irish were to be employed as labourers in the colony. The scheme was financed partly through private investment and partly through state sponsorship, largely in the form of military support. Smith's natural son, Thomas, was given the task of implementing his father's plans and he travelled to the Ards Peninsula in August 1572. Smith encountered considerable local opposition, particularly from Sir Brian MacPhelim O'Neill, the Gaelic lord of Clandeboye, who was supported by other lords in Ulster, notably Turlough Luineach O'Neill. In October 1573, Smith was killed by a supporter of Sir Brian having failed to make any progress with his father's colonial scheme. Plans to establish an English colony in Ulster were not, however, abandoned following Smith's murder. In 1573, Walter Devereux, 1st Earl of Essex received a grant of land in northeastern Ireland from Queen Elizabeth. Like Smith, Essex agreed to invest his own money in his colonial project but his ambitions were wider than those of Smith as he envisaged taking control of an extensive territory from Belfast to Coleraine and establishing himself as Captain General of Ulster. Essex recruited 400 adventurers for his colony but only a small number of them travelled to Ireland and Essex spent most of his time in the province engaged in military encounters with Gaelic lords opposed to his plans. Frustrated by his lack of progress, Essex in 1574 seized Sir Brian MacPhelim O'Neill, his wife and brother, and arranged for their execution in Dublin Castle. The following year, aware of the Queen's increasing impatience with his failure, Essex authorised a notorious raid on the Scottish settlement on Rathlin Island by John Norreys and Francis Drake. Shortly afterwards, the Queen relieved Essex of his command in Ulster. Despite the failed colonial projects and the massacre on Rathlin, Scottish migration to northeastern Ireland continued throughout the late 16th century and intensified in the early 17th century when Sir Hugh Montgomery and James Hamilton acquired property in the Ards Peninsula which they developed as a private plantation. The Church of Ireland was the Established church at this time (disestablished in 1871) and the area around Portavogie was known as the Parish of Ballyhalbert or St. Andrews Parish. The other townlands part of the Parish were: Ballyfrench, Ballyhalbert, Roddens, Echlinville, Ballyhemlin, Ballygraffin and Ballyeasborough ‚Äì the site of St. Andrews Parish Church. Portavogie was in the main a Presbyterian village. Many of the fishermen who settled here were \\"Covenanters\\" who had come from Scotland to escape the then persecution. In 1735 Charles Echlin bought Rhuban House from the Reverend Hugh Maxwell and changed the name of the immediate area to Echlinville. The Echlins were Anglo- Normans and at this time also had lands in the Kingdom of Fife, Scotland, an area to the north of Edinburgh. The Echlins had been gifted \\"Savage\\" land by the crown as a reward for services rendered and they set about the task of draining the \\"Bogs\\" of the Ardes. A contribution that can be seen today in the quality of the fertile arable land of the \\"Bogs\\". The area is once again known as Rubane. The past 50 years has seen enormous changes in the look of the village. The rebuilding of the harbour from a \\"pretty\\", safe anchorage to the modern look of today's industrial facility is progress, although one could be forgiven for thinking otherwise. In 1900 there were 18 family names associated with Portavogie: Adair, Pyper, Warnock, Boyd, Rutherford, Lawson, Ambrose, Thompson, McKee, Clint, Hughes, Cully, Edmund, Palmer, Young, McVea, McClements and Coffey. Many of these family lines have continued to this day and the list of names of Portavogie residents grows ever longer. In 1985 Princess Anne, Mrs. Mark Phillips, visited the village to officially open the new harbour and was received by the local community, she toured the fishing boat \\"Willing Lad\\" accompanied by its skipper, James McClements. In 1999 she (now The Princess Royal) revisited the village and opened the new Community centre on New Harbour Road. Portavogie had the honour, on 12 July 2008, of holding the annual band parade which was attended by a large number of people. Portavogie Rangers hold an annual football tournament called the George Best Trophy in memory of the former Man Utd and Northern Ireland striker. They also hold a five a side tournament on the eleventh of July every year. =The Troubles= During the period known as The Troubles there were two deaths in and near the village of Portavogie. These deaths were on separate occasions. 1973 *3 April 1973 ‚Äì David McQueen (28), a Protestant civilian was shot and killed by a non-specific Loyalist group at the side of the road, near Portavogie, County Down. 1993 *5 April 1993 ‚Äì William Killen (36), an ex- member of the Ulster Defence Association (UDA), was shot dead in his bed by the Ulster Defence Association (UDA) while at his home, Westlea Gardens, Portavogie, County Down during an internal UDA dispute. Demography =2011 Census= In the 2011 Census Portavogie had a population of 2,122 people (833 households). =2001 Census= The population of Portavogie on Census day (29 April 2001) was 1594 people. Therefore it is classed as a village as it has a population of 1,000 people or more and is less than 2,250 people. The demographic characteristics of the people living in Portavogie was as follows: *20.4% were aged under 16 years; *18.4% were aged 60 and over; *the average age was 37.9 years (NI average age 35.8 years); *49.9% of the population were male and 50.1% were female; *2.4% were from a Catholic Community Background; *95.9% were from a 'Protestant and Other Christian (including Christian related)' Community Background; *4.4% were born outside Northern Ireland; and *0.2% were from an ethnic group other than white.

It is approved for the treatment of Dravet syndrome, an epilepsy syndrome. It is unrelated to other anticonvulsants and belongs to the group of aromatic allylic alcohols. Medical use It is used in some countries as an add-on therapy with sodium valproate and clobazam for treating children with Dravet syndrome whose seizures are not adequately controlled. For updates see EMA index page As of 2017 it was not known whether stiripentol remains useful as children become adolescents nor as they become adults. Adverse effects Very common (more than 10% of people) adverse effects include loss of appetite, weight loss, insomnia, drowsiness, ataxia, hypotonia, and dystonia. Common (between 1% and 10% of people) adverse effects include neutropenia (sometimes severe), aggressiveness, irritability, behavior disorders, opposing behavior, hyperexcitability, sleep disorders, hyperkinesias, nausea, vomiting, and elevated gamma-glutamyltransferase. Interactions Stiripentol inhibits several cytochrome P450 isoenzymes and so interacts with many anticonvulsants and other medicines. Pharmacology As with most anticonvulsants, the precise mechanism of action is unknown. Regardless, stiripentol has been shown to have anticonvulsant effects of its own. Stiripentol increases GABAergic activity. At clinically relevant concentrations, it enhances central GABA neurotransmission through a barbiturate-like effect, since it increases the duration of opening of GABA-A receptor channels in hippocampal slices. It has also been shown to increase GABA levels in brain tissues by interfering with its reuptake and metabolism. Specifically, it has been shown to inhibit lactate dehydrogenase, which is an important enzyme involved in the energy metabolism of neurons. Inhibition of this enzyme can make neurons less prone to fire action potentials, likely through activation of ATP-sensitive potassium channels. Stiripentol also improves the effectiveness of many other anticonvulsants, possibly due to its inhibition of certain enzymes, slowing the drugs' metabolism and increasing blood plasma levels. Chemistry Stiripentol is an Œ±-ethylene alcohol; its chemical formula is 4,4-dimethyl-1-[3,4-(methylendioxy)-phenyl]-1penten-3-ol. It is chiral and is marketed as an equimolar racemic mixture. The R enantiomer appears to be around 2.5 times more active than the S enantiomer. History Stiripentol was discovered in 1978 by scientists at Biocodex and clinical trials started over the next few years. It was originally developed for adults with focal seizures, but failed a Phase III trial. In December 2001, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) granted stiripentol orphan drug status (designation number EU/3/01/071) for the treatment of severe myoclonic epilepsy of infancy (SMEI, also known as Dravet's syndrome) in children and in 2007, the EMA granted the drug a marketing authorisation for use of the drug as an add-on to other anti-seizure drugs. It was approved in Canada for this use in 2012. As of 2017 it was also approved for this use in Japan. In 2018, stiripentol was approved by the United States Food & Drug Administration as an adjunctive therapy for Dravet Syndrome. Prior to approval, parents of children with Dravet were paying around $1,000 for a month supply to obtain it from Europe.

He was a dominant factor in the preservation and memorialization of the Gettysburg Battlefield in the latter part of the century. Early life Bachelder was born in Gilmanton, New Hampshire. He was educated at Captain Alden Partridge's Military School in Pembroke and then at an academy in Gilmanton. He eventually moved to Reading, Pennsylvania, to work at a school that would later become known as the Pennsylvania Military Institute, becoming its principal in 1851. He became involved with the Pennsylvania state militia and was appointed a colonel in 1852, a title that was associated with him the rest of his life. In 1853 Bachelder returned to New Hampshire, where he married Elizabeth Barber Stevens, and began his career as an artist. Elizabeth was a niece to Gen. Benjamin Butler. From his brief association with military topics, he retained a lifelong interest in them, and when the Civil War began in 1861, he was already collecting notes on Bunker Hill, planning to paint an accurate rendition of the battle. When he realized that reliable materials were hard to locate, he decided to accompany the Union Army of the Potomac in hopes of being present at a decisive battle. There, he would be able to examine the topography of the battlefield, interview participants, and publish a written and illustrated history of the battle. Bachelder was a welcome accompaniment to the Army, as evidenced by a number of letters in his personal papers from prominent generals who complimented him on his work. For example, Brig. Gen. John C. Caldwell wrote in early 1863, \\"At Fair Oaks, Virginia, I frequently met Mr. Bachelder, at that time making sketches of various phases of the Battle of Seven Pines and Fair Oaks. Several of the sketches were shown to me, and I think them by far the most accurate of any I have ever seen.\\" Gettysburg Bachelder's map of the battlefield Bachelder's most noted work, which would occupy a good portion of the remainder of his life, was after the Battle of Gettysburg, July 1-3, 1863. He studied the terrain via horseback and drew an isometric map of the battlefield. He visited field hospitals, interviewed wounded soldiers of both armies, and determined the position on his map of every unit engaged in the battle. That fall he published a panoramic view of Gettysburg. During visits to the Army's winter quarters, he claims to have interviewed the commanders of every regiment and battery in the Army of the Potomac. He later organized reunions on the field and accompanied veterans over the terrain and placed wooden stakes into the ground to identify important points of the battle. In 1870, noted artist James Walker was commissioned by Bachelder to paint an account of Pickett's Charge, entitled \\"The Repulse of Longstreet's Assault at the Battle of Gettysburg,\\" a massive work that measured 7.5 by 20 feet. Bachelder wrote an accompanying guidebook and toured widely with the canvas, lecturing across the United States. In 1873, he published a guidebook to the battle, which was well received by the public. Bachelder's contribution to Gettysburg was more than artistic. From 1883 to 1887, he served in the position as Superintendent of Tablets and Legends for the Gettysburg Battlefield Memorial Association, and is probably responsible more than any man for the placement of monuments and battlefield markers, both Union and Confederate. He coined the phrase \\"Copse of Trees\\" and invented the concept of a \\"High Water Mark of the Confederacy\\" at which the famous Pickett's Charge peaked. All but a few monuments on the battlefield bear some of his influence.Desjardin, Thomas A. These Honored Dead: How the Story of Gettysburg Shaped American Memory.\\" . In 1880, President Rutherford B. Hayes signed into law a bill that provided $50,000 to Bachelder to write a detailed history of the battle of Gettysburg. Bachelder based his manuscript on the Official Records and the interviews he had done, but he has been criticized by some historians because his personal interviews, which would be considered more accurate than reports compiled years after the event, affected only about 10% of the 2,550 pages that he sent to Washington in October 1886. Southern historians also complained that he chose to interview very few Confederate officers. Bachelder's activities at Gettysburg were described in detail by Senator Wade Hampton of South Carolina on March 17, 1880, in a report to the Senate from its Military Affairs Committee: Death The gravestones of John B. Bachelder, his daughter Charlotte, and his wife, Elizabeth. Bachelder died of pneumonia in Hyde Park, Massachusetts, in 1894. His body was then transported the 79 miles to be buried alongside his only child, Charlotte who had died at age 13. Their graves are located in a small family cemetery on Stevens Hill Road in Nottingham, New Hampshire, close to the family home. His widow, Elizabeth, died in 1914 and was interred alongside her husband and daughter. References Further reading * Bachelder, John B. The Bachelder Papers: Gettysburg in Their Own Words.

He was born in the Salvation Army 'Mother's Hospital', Clapton, while his Salvation Army Officer parents were living in the Horfield area of Bristol. When they were appointed to London in 1937, he obtained a job at International Headquarters as office boy to General Evangeline Booth, daughter of The Salvation Army's founder. In 1942 he enlisted in the Royal Navy. He was examined for a music diploma by Sir Granville Bantock who invited him to apply for a job in music after the war. In the event, Bantock died, and Ray Steadman-Allen joined the Music Editorial Department of The Salvation Army. Following a short post-war period as a trombonist with The International Staff Band, he developed his conducting skills and became Bandmaster of the Tottenham Citadel Band. He became a Salvation Army officer himself in 1949, from the Harrow Corps., and in 1951 he married Joyce Foster, who had become a Salvation Army officer from the Hastings Citadel in 1949. Much of his music was ahead of its time, to the point that it was sometimes considered unacceptable to the listener. Lord of the Sea created a furore. His creativity was given totally to God and was instrumental in guiding Salvation Army music into uncharted territory, particularly when the International Music Editorial Department was under his leadership between 1967 and 1980. Ray Steadman-Allen regularly took part as Bandmaster in the popular radio programme Sounding Brass which was presented by Gloria Hunniford and Owen Spencer-Thomas on Radio 2 and Radio London in the 1970s. He wrote a book called Colour and Texture in the Brass Band Score which was published by The Salvation Army. First published in 1980, this volume has been reprinted due to continued demand from composers, arrangers, and university music departments alike. Besides well over 200 brass band works published by The Salvation Army, Ray Steadman-Allen wrote numerous choral works with a large number of compositions and arrangements in manuscript form, often completed for recordings or special concert presentations. As well as completing his Doctorate in Music, Ray Steadman-Allen held several honorary fellowships, was the President of the National College of Music, Vice President of the National Association of Brass Band Conductors and patron of the London Musicological Research Society. Ray was also a tremendous encourager of new compositional talent. Many leading Brass Band composers will give testimony to his positive help and professional guidance. In his later years, Ray Steadman-Allen became affectionately known as 'RSA.' In 2003, the Royal School of Church Music awarded him its ARSCM (Associate of the RSCM). In 2005, The Salvation Army admitted 'RSA' to The Order of the Founder, the highest honour that The Salvation Army can bestow on a member. In 2012, a suite of articles about his life and works was published by Shield Books under the title of 'History, Harmony and Humanity'. Ray Steadman-Allen died on 15 December 2014 at the age of 92.

Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard (), often referred to as the Broad Institute, is a biomedical and genomic research center located in Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States. The institute is independently governed and supported as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit research organization under the name Broad Institute Inc., and is partners with Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Harvard University, and the five Harvard teaching hospitals. Broad Institute, 415 Main St.  History  The Broad Institute evolved from a decade of research collaborations among MIT and Harvard scientists. One cornerstone was the Center for Genome Research of Whitehead Institute at MIT. Founded in 1982, the Whitehead became a major center for genomics and the Human Genome Project. As early as 1995, scientists at the Whitehead started pilot projects in genomic medicine, forming an unofficial collaborative network among young scientists interested in genomic approaches to cancer and human genetics. Another cornerstone was the Institute of Chemistry and Cell Biology established by Harvard Medical School in 1998 to pursue chemical genetics as an academic discipline. Its screening facility was one of the first high-throughput resources opened in an academic setting. It facilitated small molecule screening projects for more than 80 research groups worldwide. To create a new organization that was open, collaborative, cross- disciplinary and able to organize projects at any scale, planning took place in 2002‚Äì2003 among philanthropists Eli and Edythe Broad, MIT, the Whitehead Institute, Harvard and the Harvard-affiliated hospitals (in particular, the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Children's Hospital Boston, the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and the Massachusetts General Hospital). The Broads made a founding gift of $100 million and the Broad Institute was formally launched in May 2004. In November 2005, the Broads announced an additional $100 million gift to the institute. On September 4, 2008, the Broads announced an endowment of $400 million to make the Broad Institute a permanent establishment. In November 2013, they invested an additional $100 million to fund a second decade of research at the institute.  Organizational structure  The Broad Institute has 11 core faculty and 195 associate members from Harvard, MIT, and the Harvard- affiliated hospitals. The Broad Institute is made up of three types of organizational units: core member laboratories, research programs, and platforms. The institute's scientific research programs include:Broad Programs, Broad Institute official website (retrieved October 30, 2012). * Cancer Program * Program in Medical and Population Genetics * Genome Biology and Cell Circuits Program * Chemical Biology Program * Metabolism Program * Infectious Disease Program * Stanley Center for Psychiatric Research at Broad Institute * Genome Sequencing and Analysis Program * Epigenomics Program * Vertebrate Genomics Program The Broad Institute's platforms are teams of professional scientists who focus on the discovery, development, and optimization of the technological tools that Broad and other researchers use to conduct research. The platforms include:Broad Platforms, Broad Institute official site (retrieved October 24, 2013). * Data Sciences Platform * Genomics Platform * Imaging Platform * Metabolite Profiling Platform * Proteomics Platform * Genetic Perturbation Platform * Therapeutics Platform * Therapeutics Projects Group The Broad Institute also supports the Data Visualization Initiative led by the Institute creative director Bang Wong, which is aimed at developing data visualizations to explore and communicate research findings.  Core members  The faculty and staff of the Broad Institute include physicians, geneticists, and molecular, chemical, and computational biologists. The faculty currently includes 11 Core Members, whose labs are primarily located within the Broad Institute, and 195 Associate Members, whose primary labs are located at one of the universities or hospitals.\\"Broad Institute welcomes 135 associate members\\", Broad Institute (November 4, 2011).

Facilities  The Broad Institute's facilities at 320 Charles Street in Cambridge, Massachusetts, house one of the largest genome sequencing centers in the world. As WICGR (Whitehead Institute/MIT Center for Genome Research), this facility was the largest contributor of sequence information to the Human Genome Project. In February 2006, The Broad Institute expanded to a new building at 415 Main Street, adjacent to the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research. This seven-story building contains office, research laboratory, retail and museum space. In 2011, the institute announced plans to construct an additional tower adjacent to the 415 Main Street site at 75 Ames Street. On May 21, 2014, the Broad officially inaugurated a 375,000-square- foot research building at 75 Ames Street in Cambridge's Kendall Square. The new facility has 15 floors, 11 of which are occupied, and has LEED gold certification. As of July 2014, it has around 800 occupants. Funding Between 2009 and 2012, the operating revenue of the institute was approximately $200 million, with 55% of that coming from federal grants. The Broad Foundation (Eli and Edythe Broad) has provided $700 million in funding to the Broad Institute as of February 2014. The Klarman Family Foundation provided a $32.5 million grant to Broad to study cellular processes in 2012. In October 2013, Fundaci√≥n Carlos Slim (the Carlos Slim Foundation) of Mexico announced a $74 million grant to Broad Institute for the SIGMA2 consortium. In July 2014, coinciding with the publication of a new study on the genetics of schizophrenia, the Broad Institute received a $650 million gift from the Stanley Family Foundation, one of the largest private gifts ever for scientific research. On October 10, 2017, it was reported that Deerfield Management Co. was giving $50 million to the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard to support biology research. Honors Since 2010, the Broad Institute has been listed on The Boston Globe's Top Places to Work. The 2014 report from Thomson Reuters' ScienceWatch entitled \\"The World's Most Influential Scientific Minds\\" recognized that 12 out of the 17 \\"hottest\\" researchers in science belonged to genomics, and 4 out of the top 5 were affiliated with the Broad Institute. Additionally, Stacey B. Gabriel of the Broad Institute topped this entire list. Twenty-eight researchers from Broad Institute have been recognized on ISI's Highly Cited, a database that recognizes the top 250 researchers in multiple areas of science. Eric S. Lander, Stuart L. Schreiber, Aviv Regev and Edward M. Scolnick are members of the National Academy of Sciences and the Institute of Medicine. David Altshuler is a member of the Institute of Medicine. Feng Zhang received the 2014 Alan T. Waterman Award from the National Science Foundation, its highest honor that annually recognizes an outstanding researcher under the age of 35, for contributions to both optogenetics and CRISPR technology. In biochemistry, genetics, and molecular biology areas, the institute was ranked #1 in the \\"Mapping Excellence\\" report, a survey that assessed high-impact publications.

After Johnson fought for the British Crown in the War of 1812, he was honoured by his tribal council as a \\"Pine Tree Chief\\", a non-hereditary position. He was influential in the Mohawk and Anglophone communities of Upper Canada. Early life and education Smoke Johnson, a full-blood,Leighton, Dictionary of Canadian Biography was born in 1792 in Ontario into the Bear clan of his Mohawk mother at the Six Nations Indian Reserve. In the Mohawk matrilineal kinship system, the mother's clan and eldest brother were most important in her children's life; they took their status from her clan. His father was Jacob Tekahionwake Johnson (1758‚Äì1843). Smoke was reared in traditional Mohawk culture, but likely learned English as well. His father Tekahionwake was born in Mohawk territory in the colony of New York, in what became the United States. Tekahionwake was baptized and took the name Jacob Johnson, adopting his surname from that of Sir William Johnson, the influential British Superintendent of Indian Affairs, who acted as his godfather. Jacob passed the Johnson surname down to his children. With the United States victory in the American Revolutionary War, the Mohawk and other Iroquois allies of the British had been forced to cede their large territories in New York. They moved to Canada, where the British Crown granted them land in compensation at the Six Nations and other reserves in what became Ontario. Marriage and family Smoke Johnson married Helen Martin (1798 ‚Äì March 27, 1866) of the Wolf clan. She was the daughter of Catherine Rolleston and her husband Ohyeatea, also known as George Martin. Catherine Rolleston was ethnic Dutch, but she had been captured as a girl by the Mohawk, adopted by a family in the Wolf clan, and became assimilated as Mohawk. The Johnsons had seven children, who were considered to be born into the Wolf clan: Mary, Aaron, Joseph, William, Margret, Susannah and George Henry Martin (Onwanonsyshon). Career Johnson became a leader in Canada. He fought for the British Crown in the War of 1812 and was honored by his tribal council when chosen as a \\"Pine Tree Chief\\", a non-hereditary position. He was influential in the Mohawk and British communities of Ontario, Canada. Legacy His son George Henry Martin Johnson was selected as a hereditary Mohawk chief of his mother's Wolf clan in the matrilineal society. Fluent in English and Mohawk, he became a leader on the Six Nations reserve and an interpreter for the Canadian government. As an informal diplomat and negotiator, he helped facilitate relations between the Native and British communities. George Johnson married Emily Howells, a native of England whose family had immigrated to the United States in 1832. They had four children, including Emily Pauline Johnson (1861-1913), who became a respected Native American poet.

The S70 is in use, or on order, by several light rail systems in the United States, where Siemens refers to this model only as the S70 and S700. In this field, it competes mainly with Bombardier and Kinki Sharyo low-floor LRVs and modern streetcars manufactured by Inekon and Brookville Equipment Corporation. In Europe, Siemens's Combino and Avenio models are the preferred offerings for purely light rail or tramway systems; and the same S70 model, under the name Avanto, is principally sold to tram-train systems which, in whole or part, share their tracks with heavy rail trains. In the tram-train market, its principal competitors are Bombardier‚Äôs Flexity Link tram-train and Alstom‚Äôs Regio-Citadis and Citadis-Dualis tram-train variants. To date, the Avanto has been sold to two tram-train operations in France. Size and configuration Diagram of the Siemens S70 (LRV version) The S70/Avanto has a modular design and can be built in a number of different sizes and configurations, including both light-rail vehicle (LRV) and streetcar versions. The streetcar version is shorter than the standard LRV version. There are some interior differences as well: the LRV version has the upper seats facing the cab, while the streetcar version has the upper seats facing the doors of the train. The S700's center unit seating is positioned sideways rather than the original aisle seating. In addition, the horn on the LRV version is located on the bottom of the cab while the streetcar version is located on the top of the train. Earlier S70s delivered in North America had a length between and , but the 77 cars used by Utah Transit Authority for the Salt Lake City TRAX system and the 65 4000 series S70 & 45 5000 series S700 cars on the San Diego Trolley are only long.

Portland, Oregon's two orders of S70s are single-ended cars, with one non-driving end (shown). Most S70 vehicles are double-ended, with operating controls at both ends and doors on both sides. An exception is the 40 cars in service on Portland, Oregon's MAX system, which are single-ended and have cabs at only one end of each car. However, in service they always operate in pairs, coupled back-to-back, so that each consist has operating cabs at both ends.Morgan, Steve. \\"Expansion for Portland's MAX: New routes and equipment\\", pp. 38-40.

The wreck is noteworthy for the great loss of life that resulted and the treasures recovered.  Introduction  La Girona (/l…ëÀê x…™Ààr…îÀên…ëÀê/) was named after the Girones family, who at the time had just become Dukes of Osuna and viceroys of Naples ( not after Girona, the Catalan name of the city and province of Gerona). Its captain was Hugo de Moncada y Gralla, knight of the Order of Malta.  Shipwreck  Don Alonso Martinez de Leyva, El Greco c.1580 La Girona had anchored in Killybegs harbour, Donegal, with a damaged rudder. With the assistance of an Irish chieftain, MacSweeney Bannagh, she was repaired and set sail for Scotland on 25 October, with 1,300 men on board, including Alonso Mart√≠nez de Leyva, knight and trece of the Order of Santiago. After Lough Foyle was cleared, a gale struck and La Girona was driven on to Lacada Point and the \\"Spanish Rocks'\\" (as they were known, thereafter) near Ballintoy in County Antrim, on the night of 26 October 1588. Of the estimated 1300 souls on board, there were nine survivors. 260 bodies washed ashore and were buried in a common grave at the local churchyard. The survivors were sent on to Scotland by the local clan leader Sorley Boy MacDonnell of Dunluce Castle, which was situated just to the west on the Giant's Causeway cliffs overlooking the coast. From there, MacDonnell is also believed to have conducted the first clandestine salvage efforts on the shipwreck.  Salvage  Between 1967 and April 68, off the coast of Portballintrae (Port-na Spaniagh bay), a team of Belgian divers (including Robert St√©nuit, the world's first aquanaut), located the remains of the wreck and brought up the greatest find of Spanish Armada treasure salvaged up until that time.https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern- ireland-40045580 The underwater site was designated under the Protection of Wrecks Act on 22 April 1993.

Biography The son of the wealthy merchant Agostino (nicknamed , or \\"little eel\\") and Teresa Giunchi, Pellegrino Marcello Artusi came from a large family: he had 12 siblings. He was named Pellegrino in honor of Saint Pellegrino Laziosi of Forl√¨. Like many wealthy children, he attended a seminary school in the nearby town of Bertinoro. Between the years 1835 and 1850, Artusi spent a great deal of time in student circles in Bologna (in one of his works he claims to have been enrolled at the University). In the bar Tre Re he met the patriot Felice Orsini, from Meldola another town near Forl√¨. When he returned to his hometown, he took over his father's business, making quite a bit of money, but the lives of the Artusi family were permanently disrupted by the arrival in Forlimpopoli on January 25, 1851, of the outlaw Stefano Pelloni, nicknamed il Passatore, \\"the Ferryman\\". He took all of the upper-class families hostage, one by one, and held them captive in the city theater, including Pellegrino Artusi's family. After stealing as much as possible, the bandits raped several women, one of whom was Gertrude, Artusi's sister, who went crazy from the shock and had to be put in an asylum in Pesaro. Bust of Pellegrino Artusi by sculptor Italo Vagnetti at the Porte Sante cemetery in Florence. The following year, the family moved to Florence. Here, Pellegrino began working in finances, and he also dedicated his time to two of his favorite hobbies: literature and the art of cooking. His sisters got married and his parents died and so he was able to live off his inheritance thanks to the land the family had in Romagna (in Borgo Pieve Sestina di Cesena and Sant'Andrea di Forlimpopoli). He bought a house in D'Azeglio Square in Florence, where he quietly lived out his life until 1911 when he died at age 90. Single, he lived with just a butler from his hometown and a Tuscan cook. He was buried in the Porte Sante cemetery, part of the basilica of San Miniato al Monte. His most famous work is La scienza in cucina e l'arte di mangiare bene (\\"The Science of Cooking and the Art of Eating Well\\"). The title is clearly of a positivist bent; Artusi worshipped progress and the scientific method, which he used in his book. He was also an admirer of the physiologist Paolo Mantegazza. His book, in fact, can be considered a \\"scientifically tested\\" manual: every recipe was the result of trials and experiments. Writing only two decades after the unification of Italy, Artusi was the first to include recipes from all the different regions of Italy in a single cookbook. He is often credited with establishing a truly national Italian cuisine for the first time, and even the French cook Auguste Escoffier took inspiration from him. =The case of minestrone and cholera= Of particular interest is the story told by Artusi himself regarding a bad experience which occurred during the summer in Livorno in 1855, when Artusi came in contact with cholera, the infective disease that in that era took many lives in Italy. Once in Livorno, Artusi went to a restaurant to have dinner. After eating minestrone, he decided to rent a room in the building belonging to a man called Domenici. As Artusi would later recount, he spent the whole night suffering from horrible stomach pains, which he blamed on the minestrone he had eaten. The next day, returning to Florence, he got the news that Livorno had been hit by cholera and that Domenici had been a victim. It was only then that he realized what had happened: it had not been the minestrone that made him ill, but the early symptoms of the disease. The event inspired Artusi to write an excellent recipe for minestrone. Works There are three works by Artusi: two non- fiction books and a cooking manual. The non-fiction works, a biography of Ugo Foscolo and a critique of Giuseppe Giusti, went largely unnoticed and quickly went out of print. His manual, however, entitled La scienza in cucina e l'arte di mangiar bene, was much more successful. In 1891, at age 71, he completed his cookbook, but could not find a publisher. So he used his own money to self-publish, selling a thousand copies of the first edition in four years.Pirro, Deirdre (June 14, 2007). \\"Pellegrino Artusi\\" on www.theflorentine.it Soon, however, the cookbook caught on, and before Artusi died, more than 200,000 copies had been sold. Filled with amusing anecdotes as well as recipes, the book is a perennial best seller in Italy, and has been translated into Spanish, French, Dutch, German, English and, most recently, Portuguese and Polish. Cover from a 1910 edition of La scienza in cucina e l'arte di mangiar bene. In 1904, Artusi published a practical manual for the kitchen, with over 3,000 recipes and 150 tables, simply entitled Ecco il tuo libro di cucina (\\"Here is your cookbook\\") with the anonymous participation and influence of the baroness Giulia Turco.

In most of England, the corresponding unit was the hundred, which was in principle, a grouping of a hundred households. Around a thousand years ago, it was important as a unit for gathering taxes and raising men for the 'citizen' army of the time, known as the Fyrd. The idea of the hundred goes back at least to the time of Tacitus but the version called the wapentake belongs to the Danish-influenced part of England. It therefore dates in that country, from the tenth or very early eleventh century. In 1882, White's Directory for Lincolnshire (page 94) described the wapentakes as \\"now of little practical value\\".

The battles resulted from Japanese operations to reinforce and resupply their forces on Leyte and U.S. attempts to interdict them. Background After gaining naval control over the Western Pacific in mid-1944, the Allies attacked the Philippines in October, landing troops at Leyte Gulf on the east side of Leyte on 20 October 1944. The island of Leyte was defended by about 20,000 Japanese; American General Douglas MacArthur thought that the occupation of Leyte would be only a prelude to the major engagement on Luzon. For the Japanese, maintaining control of the Philippines was essential because their loss would enable the Allies to sever their oil supply lines from Borneo and Sumatra. The Imperial Japanese Navy responded to this attack with a combined fleet attack that led to the Battle of Leyte Gulf from 23‚Äì26 October. In this massive naval engagement, the Japanese Navy was destroyed as a strategic force. However, this was not at first clear, and the Japanese commander in the Philippines, General Tomoyuki Yamashita, believed that the United States Navy had suffered severe casualties and that the Allied land forces might be vulnerable. Accordingly, he began to reinforce and resupply the garrisons on Leyte; over the course of the battle the Japanese ran nine convoys to the island, landing around 34,000 troops from the 1st, 8th, 26th, 30th, and 102nd divisions. Ormoc City at the head of Ormoc Bay on the west side of Leyte was the main port on the island and the main destination of the convoys. Decryption of messages sent using the PURPLE cipher alerted the Allies to the concentration of Japanese shipping around Leyte, but they initially interpreted this as an evacuation. However, by the first week of November the picture was clear, and the Allies began to interdict the convoys. Operations =TA-3 and TA-4 (Japanese)= On 8‚Äì9 November, the Japanese dispatched two convoys from Manila to Ormoc Bay. The convoys were spaced one day apart so that the destroyers escorting the first convoy could double back and escort the second. However, the convoys were spotted on November 9 and attacked by land-based aircraft of the Fifth Air Force. On 10 November the 38th Bomb Group, based on Morotai, sent 32 B-25 Mitchells escorted by 37 P-47 Thunderbolts to attack TA-4 near Ponson Island. Reaching the convoy just before noon, the B-25s attacked at minimum altitude in pairs, sinking the two largest transports, Takatsu Maru and Kashii Maru, disabling a third, and sinking two of the patrol craft escorts at a cost of seven bombers, for which the group was awarded the Distinguished Unit Citation. But the Japanese transports had been able to put ashore the 10,000 soldiers they had been carrying, be it with only a fraction of the supplies. On 11 November, U.S. 3rd Fleet commander Admiral William F. Halsey ordered an attack by 350 planes of Task Force 38 on the combined convoys. Four destroyers ‚Äì , , and ‚Äì and four transports Mikasa Maru, Taizan Maru, Seiho Maru and Tensho Maru were sunk, with many of the 4,000 soldiers on board killed. Rear Admiral Mikio Hayakawa went down with Shimakaze, and some 1,000 sailors from the 8 ships were killed. =TA-5 (Japanese)= Convoy TA-5 left Manila on 23 November for Port Cataingan and Port Balancan. Of the six transports, five were sunk by air attack (T-111, T-141, T-160, T-6 and T-10) . =U.S. destroyer sweeps= Bad weather in late November made air interdiction less effective, and the U.S. Navy began to send destroyers into Ormoc Bay. Canigao Channel was swept for mines by the minesweepers and , and the four destroyers of Destroyer Squadron 22 (DesRon 22) under the command of Captain Robert Smith (, , and ) entered the bay on 27 November, where they shelled the docks at Ormoc City.Prefer, N.N., 2012, Leyte 1944, Havertown: Casemate Publishers, An Allied patrol plane radioed a message to the division noting that a surfaced Japanese submarine (I-46) was south of Pacijan Island and heading for Ormoc Bay. The division headed south to intercept; and, at 01:27 on 28 November, Wallers radar picked up the target just off the northeast coast of Ponson Island. Waller disabled I-46 with her first shots and, unable to submerge, she could only return fire with her deck guns until she sank at 01:45. =TA-6 (Japanese)= Two transports, Shinsho Maru and Shinetsu Maru, escorted by three patrol vessels, Subchasers Nos. 45 and 53 and Patrol Boat No. 105, left Manila on 27 November. They were attacked by American PT boats in Ormoc Bay on the night of 28 November and by air attack as the survivors left the area. All five ships were sunk, but not before they were able to unload most of their badly-needed supplies to the troops on Leyte. Another U.S. destroyer sweep on the night of 29‚Äì30 November in search of a reported convoy resulted only in the destruction of a few barges. =TA-7 (Japanese)= A convoy of three transports departed Manila on 1 December, escorted by destroyers Take and Kuwa under the command of Lieutenant Commander Masamichi Yamashita. Two groups of transport submarines also took part in the operation. The convoy was docked at Ormoc City when it was engaged at 00:09 on 3 December by three ships of U.S. Destroyer Division 120 (DesDiv 120) under the command of Commander John C. Zahm (, and ). The U.S. ships sank the transports as they were unloading but came under heavy attack from Yokosuka P1Y \\"Frances\\" bombers, shore batteries, submarines that were known to be in the harbor, and the Japanese destroyers. Kuwa was sunk and Commander Yamashita was killed. Take attacked Cooper with torpedoes and escaped, though with some damage. Cooper sank at about 00:15 with the loss of 191 lives (168 sailors were rescued from the water on 4 December by Consolidated PBY Catalina flying boats). At 00:33, the two surviving U.S. destroyers were ordered to leave the bay, and the victorious Japanese successfully resupplied Ormoc Bay once more. This phase of the Battle of Ormoc Bay has gone down in history as the only naval engagement during the war in which the enemy brought to bear every type of weapon: naval gunnery, naval torpedoes, air attack, submarine attack, shore gunnery, and mines. =Ormoc Bay U.S. troop landings= on fire in Ormoc Bay on 7 December 1944, after she was hit by a kamikaze. The tug assisting with firefighting is probably ATR-31. On 7 December, the 77th Infantry Division, commanded by Major General Andrew D. Bruce, made an amphibious landing at Albuera, south of Ormoc City. The 77th Division's 305th, 306th, and 307th Infantry Regiments came ashore unopposed, but naval shipping was subjected to kamikaze attacks, resulting in the loss of destroyers and . =TA-8 (Japanese)= This convoy carried 4,000 troops destined for Ormoc Bay, but which were unloaded at San Isidro, 30 miles north of Ormoc, after receiving news of the U.S. troop landings near Ormoc. All five transports, Akagisan Maru, Hakuba Maru, Shinsei Maru No. 5, Nichiyo Maru and T-7 were sunk on 7 December by air attack, and the escorting destroyers Ume and Sugi were damaged. Some 350 sailors were killed. =TA-9 (Japanese)= Convoy TA-9 landed some 4,000 troops at Palompon, but escorting destroyers entered the bay on 11 December where two, (by air attacks) and (by PT boats), were sunk and the third, Kiri, was damaged. Aftermath By fighting this series of engagements in Ormoc Bay, the U.S. Navy was eventually able to prevent the Japanese from further resupplying and reinforcing their troops on Leyte, contributing significantly to the victory in the land battle. The final tally of ships lost in Ormoc Bay is: U.S. ‚Äì three destroyers, one high speed transport, and two LSMs; Japan ‚Äì six destroyers, 20 small transports, one submarine, one patrol boat and three escort vessels. Historian Irwin J. Kappes argued that naval historians have unjustly neglected the importance of these engagements, writing: \\"In the end, it was the rather amorphous Battle of Ormoc Bay that finally brought Leyte and the entire Gulf area under firm Allied control. From 11 November 1944 until 21 December, the combined efforts of Third Fleet carrier planes, Marine fighter- bomber groups, a pincer movement by the Army‚Äôs 77th Division and the First Division plus a motley assortment of destroyers, amphibious ships and PT boats trounced the now semi-isolated Japanese in a series of skirmishes and night raids. And because of poor weather conditions air support for most of these surface actions was almost non-existent.\\" Fires on the Plain (novel) is a renowned book by the Japanese writer Ooka Shohei which describes the final conditions of the Japanese army on the island of Leyte and the desperate flight of some its isolated soldiers after their units have been defeated by US armed forces, as they try to reach Palompon on Leyte's West coast in the hope of re-embarking on Japanese vessels.

It was launched on August 11, 2005 from the European Space Agency's spaceport in French Guiana on board the Ariane rocket. The satellite had a launch mass of 6486 kilograms and is from SS/L's LS-1300 series of spacecraft. IPSTAR 1 is the world's first High Throughput Satellite capable of providing service to up to two million broadband users or nearly 30 million mobile phone subscribers in the Asia Pacific region. Compared to the one or two gigabit per second (Gbit/s) capacity of a typical satellite designed for Fixed Satellite Services (FSS), IPSTAR was designed to provide broadband Internet service. Its 45 Gbit/s of capacity had never been achieved on a satellite before, enabling IPSTAR to provide up to 6 Mbit/s user download and up to 4 Mbit/s upload speeds for a variety of applications and services. Technology The satellite's 45 Gbit/s bandwidth capacity, in combination with its platform's ability to provide an immediately available, high-capacity ground network with affordable bandwidth, allows for rapid deployment and flexible service locations within its footprint. The IPSTAR broadband satellite system is composed of a gateway earth station communicating over the satellite to provide broadband packet- switched communications to a large number of small terminals with network star configuration. A wide-band data link from the gateway to the user terminal employs an Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) with a Time Division Multiplex (TDM) overlay. These forward channels employ highly efficient transmission methods, including Turbo Product Code (TPC) and higher order modulation (L-codes) for increased system performance. In the terminal- to-gateway direction (or return link), the narrow-band channels employ the same efficient transmission methods. These narrow-band channels operate in different multiple-access modes based on bandwidth-usage behavior, including ALOHA and TDMA for STAR return link waveform. Traditional satellite technology utilizes a broad single beam to cover entire continents and regions. With the introduction of multiple narrowly focused spot beams and frequency reuse, IPSTAR is capable of maximizing the available frequency for transmissions. Increasing bandwidth by a factor of twenty compared to traditional Ku-band satellites translates into better efficiencies. Despite the higher costs associated with spot beam technology, the overall cost per circuit is considerably lower as compared to shaped beam technology. IPSTAR's Dynamic Power Allocation optimizes the use of power among beams and allocates a power reserve of 20 percent to be allocated to beams that may be affected by rain fade, thus maintaining the link.

He accepted initiation (diksha) from Jagadananda Goswami of Vrindavan, and later accepted Babaji initiation from Madhusudana dasa Babaji. For the rest of his life, his example as a Gaudiya Vaishnava devotee was an inspiration to many in the community. Bhaktivinoda Thakur is quoted calling him \\"the commanding chief of the devotees\\". Jagannatha Dasa Babaji was born in a small village within the modern day Tangail district of Bangladesh. His birth year cannot be pinpointed exactly with accounts from several different Gaudiya Vaishnava groups giving years from 1750 to 1800. Jagannatha Dasa Babaji met Bhaktivinoda Thakur in 1880, and the latter subsequently accepted the former as his instructing guru (shiksha guru). The respected and well known Bipin Bihari Goswami, who is Lord Nithyananda-Rama Lineage, is Bhaktivinodha thakur's initiation diksha guru. It is told among some Gaudiya Vaishnavas that a young Bhaktisiddhanta, skilled in astronomy, created an ample Vaishnava calendar at Jagannatha Dasa Babaji's request, detailing all holidays, including the appearance and disappearance days of prominent devotees. Jagannatha Dasa Babaji spent his last days in the areas of Vrindavan and Navadwip, where he performed bhajan and japa in worship to Radha and Krishna.. A devotee named Bihari Lal would often assist the elderly sadhu. His devotion to Caitanya Mahaprabhu and instructions on Vaishnava Theology to Bhaktivinoda Thakur and Gaurakisora Dasa Babaji render him an integral part of the Gaudiya Vaishnava Guru Parampara.

It is located on the island of Newfoundland, along St. George's Bay, on the Port au Port Peninsula. The DPL consists of the fishing villages of Abraham's Cove and Piccadilly. The area had a population of 436 in the Canada 2006 Census. Abraham's Cove According to the local population, the Abraham's Cove site was first settled in the late 19th century by the Duffey family, of mixed Acadian and Mi'kmaq ancestry. The population kept livestock and fished for cod, herring, and lobster. With the increasing scarcity of commercial fish, many residents found employment in the nearby Ernest Harmon US AFB in Stephenville, which operated from 1941 to 1966, or at the provincial highways depot. Today, very few local residents still engage in fishing, and many men and women seek seasonal employment elsewhere in the province or in Nova Scotia. Piccadilly Piccadilly has its own liquor and confectionery store, which is called Parkview. Its park is located a kilometre from Parkview. It is a beautiful place for camping, the beach is sandy and a lot of people swim and go clamming on the shoals. It has a great view of the bay and nature trails. Camp sites, water, bathrooms, changing rooms, and electricity are available. Down the road about one kilometre is Piccadilly Central High School, which is located near a body of water called \\"The Big Hole\\". There is a wharf across from the Colliers, and marine centre, where the fishermen sell lobsters and fish. There is a church called Our Lady of Fatima where the community gathers on Sundays. In the early 1960s, Piccadilly housed the only theatre west of Stephenville. It was known for showing very old, black and white movies during the winter months while warming its clientele with a wood-burning stove.

Shaun Murphree Arkivoc (JC-1522R) pp. 6‚Äì33 Online article It is a colorless, toxic, volatile liquid that is of significant practical interest. Its derivatives, also referred to as aziridines, are of broader interest in medicinal chemistry.  Structure  The bond angles in aziridine are approximately 60¬∞, considerably less than the normal hydrocarbon bond angle of 109.5¬∞, which results in angle strain as in the comparable cyclopropane and ethylene oxide molecules. A banana bond model explains bonding in such compounds. Aziridine is less basic than acyclic aliphatic amines, with a pKa of 7.9 for the conjugate acid, due to increased s character of the nitrogen free electron pair. Angle strain in aziridine also increases the barrier to nitrogen inversion. This barrier height permits the isolation of separate invertomers, for example the cis and trans invertomers of N-chloro-2-methylaziridine.  Synthesis and uses Aziridine is produced industrially from aminoethanol via two related routes. The Nippon Shokubai process requires an oxide catalyst and high temperatures to effect the dehydration. In the Wenker synthesis, the aminoethanol is converted to the sulfate ester, which undergoes base-induced sulfate elimination. Older methods entailed amination of 1,2-dichloroethane and cyclization of 2-chloroethylamine. Aziridine forms a wide variety of polymeric derivatives, known as polyethylenimines. These and related species are useful crosslinking agents and precursors for coatings. Safety Aziridine is highly toxic with an LD50 of 14 mg (oral, rats). It is a skin irritant. As an alkylating agent, it also a mutagen. It is subject to attack and ring-opening by endogenous nucleophiles such as nitrogenous bases in DNA base pairs, resulting in potential mutagenicity.

Kavelin, 1880-1884 Konstantin Dmitrievich Kavelin () (November 4 1818 - May 5 1885) was a Russian historian, jurist, and sociologist, sometimes called the chief architect of early Russian liberalism. Born in Saint Petersburg into an old noble family, Kavelin graduated from the legal department of the Moscow University and read law at the University of St Petersburg from 1839. Together with Timofey Granovsky and Alexander Herzen, he was one of the leading Westernizers. In 1855, Herzen published Kavelin's celebrated proposal for the emancipation of serfs, which cost him the lucrative position of tsesarevich's tutor. In 1862, he was forced to resign from his post for becoming politically-involved with the student, constitutional movement. During the 1860s, Kavelin was elected President of the Free Economic Society and gradually drifted to the right. In his Short Review of Russian History (1887) he seconded many Slavophile opinions and praised the state as the key institution of national history. Some scholars believe that Kavelin was a prototype of Stiva Oblonski in Leo Tolstoy's novel Anna Karenina.

It was conceived at the Five Points Drug Company's BC Remedy Building in Durham, North Carolina, now owned by Measurement Incorporated. It was developed in 1906, by Commodore ‚ÄúConny‚Äù Council, a Durham pharmacist working in the drug store of Germain Bernard. The name was created from the initials of the pair‚Äôs surnames. Originally produced at the Hepolscheiemer Clinic in Graz, Austria, it contains 845 mg of aspirin and 65 mg of caffeine. BC readily promotes the fact that, due to its powder form, it dissolves faster than pain-relief tablets, and thus gets to work faster. It can be taken in a variety of ways, most commonly mixed into water or soda. BC is sold almost exclusively in the American South, where it is acknowledged to have a cult following; outside that region, the Dollar General chain carries BC Powder nationwide. BC's marketers enjoy this honor, and sponsor many sporting events in the region. Indeed, the product's distinctive, oval-shaped blue logo is a familiar sight to fans at Southern League (baseball) parks. BC Powder has historically been most commonly associated with relief of headaches. In fact, many users of the brand erroneously believe the name of the product to be \\"BC Headache Powder.\\" However, recent advertising and marketing endeavors by the company suggest that it is eager to associate itself with relief of general bodily aches and pains as well. Goody's, like BC, is also distributed by Prestige Brands. For many years, singer and actor Faron Young was the celebrity featured on many of the product's television and radio commercials. For several years, BC's television and radio commercials have featured real-life users of the product, non-actors who are encouraged to submit their stories to BC Powder through contests announced on radio programs. Recently, most entries have been culled from listeners of the Charlotte, NC-based radio program The Big Show with John Boy and Billy. In recent years, members of the Tom Joyner Radio Show's audience have appeared in BC commercials after hearing of the promotion on that program, or from promotions held on Joyner's annual \\"Fantastic Voyage\\" fantasy cruise. BC Powder also distributes and markets BC Cherry and BC Arthritis Formula. In 2009 BC Powder removed the 195 mg of Salicylamide from the \\"Blue Box Original Formula BC Powder\\". The original formula consisted of 650 mg aspirin, 195 mg salicylamide and 33.3 mg caffeine. The New packaging states \\"New Formula\\" and \\"Same Fast Relief!\\" on the front of the box. The new formula has 845 mg aspirin and 65 mg caffeine. In a deal which took effect in 2012, GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) sold BC Powder and 16 other brands to Prestige Brands.

She was the first African-American woman to direct on Broadway, with her 1972 production of the musical Don't Bother Me, I Can't Cope. Until Liesl Tommy's 2016 nomination for Eclipsed, Carroll was the only African-American woman to have received a Tony Award nomination for direction.  Life and work  Carroll was born in New York City to Edgar Edgerton, a dentist, and Florence (Morris) Carroll.McClinton, Calvin A. The Work of Vinnette Carroll, An African American Theatre Artist. Edwin Mellen Press, 2000. She moved to Jamaica with her family at age three, and spent much of her childhood there. She has two sisters. Her mother was a strong presence who played Arturo Toscanini in the home and disciplined her three daughters wisely.Smith, Karen L. Vinnette Carroll: Portrait of an Artist in Motion, 1975, page 2. Her father encouraged his daughters to become physicians. She compromised by studying psychology. She left the field of psychology to study theater, and in 1948 accepted a scholarship to attend Erwin Piscator‚Äôs Dramatic Workshop at the New School for Social Research. There, she studied with Lee Strasberg, Stella Adler, Margaret Barker, and Susan Steele. Carroll later founded the Urban Arts Corps, a nonprofit, interracial community theater where, as artistic director, she was able to provide a professional workshop for aspiring young actors in underserved communities.Smith, Karen L. Vinnette Carroll: Portrait of an Artist in Motion, 1975, page vi. She produced over 100 plays through the Urban Arts Corps from her loft theatre on West 20th Street in Manhattan. James V. Hatch,‚Äô From Hansberry to Shange‚Äô in A History of African American Theatre, ed. By Errol G. Hill and James V. Hatch (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2003) page 401The theater was a member of the Black Theater Alliance and the Off-Off Broadway Alliance, and was supported by the New York State Council on the Arts, the National Endowment of the Arts, the Edward Noble Foundation, and CBS.Smith, Karen L. Vinnette Carroll: Portrait of an Artist in Motion, 1975, page 54-55. Urban Arts Corps productions included Don't Bother Me, I Can't Cope, Jean-Paul Sartre'sThe Flies, and William Hanley's Slow Dance on a Killing Ground, among many others.Smith, Karen L. Vinnette Carroll: Portrait of an Artist in Motion, 1975, page v. The theater provided a space to \\"nurture emerging playwrights and showcase their works.\\"Nelson, Emmanuel S. African American Dramatists: An A to Z Guide, 2004, page 189. In 1968, Carroll joined the New York State Council on the Arts upon the request of executive director John B. Hightower. She had previously been appointed director of the Ghetto Arts Program for the State of New York.Conyers, James. Black Lives: Essays in African American Biography. Vol. 23, No. 4. 2000, page 22.  Education  Carroll attended Wadleigh High School, an integrated high school in Harlem, Manhattan. She then received her Bachelor of Arts from Long Island University in 1944. In 1946, she received her Master of Arts degree from New York University. She was a Ph.D. candidate at Columbia University, but decided not to finish the psychology degree and instead to pursue a career in acting. Psychology, while not her chosen profession, was a tool she found invaluable in working with people.Smith, Karen L. Vinnette Carroll: Portrait of an Artist in Motion, 1975, page 3. She began studying theatre at the New School for Social Research in 1946, where she aspired to become an actress. She also studied in the fields of clinical and industrial psychology, and was awarded a scholarship to do postgraduate work at the New School for Social Research in 1948. Her philosophy of directing and her technique for creating her folk plays reflect similar theories, ideas, and aesthetic principles to those of Bertolt Brecht.Conyers, James. Black Lives: Essays in African American Biography. Vol. 23, No. 4. 2000, page 25. She also promoted the principles of Erwin Piscator‚Äôs \\"objective style of performance\\". After working with Piscator, she studied at Strasberg's studio between 1948 and 1950.Smith, Karen L. Vinnette Carroll: Portrait of an Artist in Motion, 1975, page 4. The juxtaposition of these opposing styles led to Carroll's own technique in creating her new style of folk drama.  Acting career  Carroll's first stage appearance was at the New School for Social Research in 1948. She performed in many of the school‚Äôs productions, including roles as Clytemmnestra in Agamemnon, the Nurse in Romeo and Juliet, and the Duchess in Alice in Wonderland. Carroll made her professional stage debut as a Christian in a summer stock production of George Bernard Shaw's Androcles and the Lion at the Southold Playhouse on Long Island. She played Addie in Lillian Hellman's The Little Foxes and then, in 1949, Bella in Arnaud d'Ussaeu and James Gow's Deep Are the Roots.Smith, Karen L. Vinnette Carroll: Portrait of an Artist in Motion, 1975, page 5. In 1955, Carroll joined the faculty of the Performing Arts High School in New York City. She taught theater arts and directed productions as a faculty member at the high school for 11 years. Later, due to a shortage of faculty positions, Carroll created a one-woman show and toured the United States and the West Indies until 1957. She made her London stage debut at the Royal Court Theatre on December 4, 1958, as Sophia Adams in Moon on a Rainbow Shawl. She then won an Obie Award for her role in Errol John‚Äôs Moon on a Rainbow Shawl. In February 1963, she returned to London as the Narrator in Black Nativity at the Piccadilly Theatre.Smith, Karen L. Vinnette Carroll: Portrait of an Artist in Motion, 1975, page 6. Carroll also worked in film and television. She appeared in the films Up the Down Staircase (1967), Alice's Restaurant (1969), and others. She later appeared in The Last Home Run, which was filmed in 1996 and released in 1998. In 1964, she received an Emmy Award for Beyond the Blues, which dramatized the works of Black poets. She later returned to London with her company and performed in Peter Wessel Zapffe'sThe Prodigal Son.  As a playwright and director  During her era, Carroll was one of the few women directing in commercial theatre.Smith, Karen L. Vinnette Carroll: Portrait of an Artist in Motion, 1975, page 10. She worked to develop a new form of theater, \\"the gospel song-play\\", to capture the richness and variety of life through music, theater, and dance.Conyers, James. Black Lives: Essays in African American Biography. Vol. 23, No. 4. 2000, page x. In 1957, she formed her first all-black cast to present Howard Richardson and William Berney's Dark of the Moon at the Harlem YMCA.Conyers, James. Black Lives: Essays in African American Biography. Vol. 23, No. 4. 2000, page 21. The second production of Dark of the Moon launched the careers of several young African-American actors, including James Earl Jones, Shauneille Perry, and Harold Scott. In 1972, she became the first African- American woman to direct on Broadway with her staging of Don't Bother Me, I Can't Cope. The hit gospel revue was conceived by Carroll, with music and lyrics by Micki Grant. It was nominated for four Tony Awards. In 1976, she collaborated with Grant and Alex Bradford on Your Arms Too Short to Box with God, which garnered three Tony nominations. This show was an adaptation of the Gospel According to Matthew. Carroll did not dwell on her role as a female director because she felt it would be self-defeating.Smith, Karen L. Vinnette Carroll: Portrait of an Artist in Motion, 1975, page 52. Through her effort and talent, she provided communities with illustrations of unity through her productions. Her contributions as an artist and playwright are often overlooked. However, she is known for the reinvention of song-play, which was revitalized in many of her theater works. The expression of identity through gospel music in the African-American theater experience is clearly delineated in the development of song-play.Conyers, James. Black Lives: Essays in African American Biography. Vol. 23, No. 4. 2000, page 19. Her work was about the reaffirmation of life and people. Common stereotypes of African Americans led Carroll \\"into creating and directing new works that positively and artistically presented people of color in theater and art.\\" Her primary interest was giving voice to African Americans and other minority communities that have been culturally and artistically silenced. Carroll once said of her career \\"‚Äú They told me that I had one-third less chance because I was a woman; they told me I had one-third less chance again because I was black, but I tell you, I did one hell of a lot with that remaining one-third.‚Äù James V. Hatch,‚Äô From Hansberry to Shange‚Äô in A History of African American Theatre, ed. By Errol G. Hill and James V. Hatch (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2003) page 401  Retirement and death  Carroll moved to Fort Lauderdale, Florida, during the 1980s. There, she founded the Vinnette Carroll Repertory Company, where she remained as artistic director and producer until her failing health forced her to retire in 2001.Nelson, Emmanuel (editor).

End≈ç was a Japanese Catholic writer whose works, among other things, covered various aspects of the Japanese Catholic experience. He was furthermore a member of the Japanese literary establishment, accounting for the importance of PEN meetings in the work. Aging in Japan was also addressed via commentary on the medical problems suffered by an elderly man. Plot summary Set in Tokyo during the 1980s, it tells the story of an old Catholic writer struggling with old age and the feeling that he yet has to write his magnum opus. One day, a young woman shows up at a party attended by the main character, Suguro, mentioning loudly that he has not been visiting the ill-reputed street where she works as an artist lately. Because of his reputation as a Christian writer with high moral standards, such behaviour is seen by his publishers as very undesirable and by himself as very embarrassing. He meets a young girl, Mitsu, telling him about enjo k≈çsai (\\"compensated dating\\"), and Suguro decides to hire her as an assistant to help relieve his rheumatic wife from such activities. As time passes he starts to dream about this young girl, but keeps silent about it so as not to worry his wife. Reluctantly, Suguro visits the studio of the woman from the party, where he meets an older woman whom he later befriends. He also starts to discover another world, including masochism and various more or less odd forms of prostitution. The people in that world all seem to know him and Suguro suspects that an impostor is out there, trying to destroy his reputation, and starts to hunt for this man. Eventually the older woman, with whom he now has become rather close, sends him a letter inviting him to a love hotel where, she writes, the identity of the impostor will be revealed. Suguro finds the young Mitsu there, drunk and half-naked on the bed. Here, in the end of the book, it is revealed to him that a dark side exists below his polished surface.

History Aerial view of the Est√°dio Ol√≠mpico do Par√° (2015) The Mangueir√£o stadium architectonical project is from August 1969. The Stadium was designed by Alcyr Meira, a local architect.UFPA The Par√° State Governor of that time, Alacid Nunes ordered a 120,000 people football stadium construction project. The works started in 1970, when were built the ditch, the field and the general bleachers. A year later, the project was changed, and the stadium maximum capacity was reduced from 120,000 to 70,000. In 1971 the construction works restarted, with the construction of the first structural module. In 2002, 24 years after the stadium inauguration, Mangueir√£o was reinaugurated as an olympic stadium. R$30 million were spent by the government of Par√° state. Mangueir√£o's most important match was the first leg of Copa dos Campe√µes final, played on July 31, 2002, when Cruzeiro beat Paysandu 2-1. The inaugural match was played on March 4, 1978, when a Par√° State all-stars team beat a Youngsters Uruguay national team 4-0. The first goal of the stadium was scored by Par√°'s Mesquita. The reinaugural match was played on May 1, 2002, when Remo and Paysandu drew 2-2. The first goal of the stadium after the reinauguration was scored by Remo's Bal√£o.

The zoo officially opened on September 3, 1971, and currently averages 375,000 visitors annually. Situated on , the zoo houses about 400 animal species (including 47 endangered species) and over 250 tropical and neo- tropical species and subspecies. It is the first zoo to have successfully bred the vulnerable Jentink's Duiker (although none are currently in captivity in the USA). The zoo is named after Gladys Porter, the daughter of Earl C. Sams, former president of J. C. Penney. Porter, a wildlife enthusiast, helped to plan and stock the zoo, which was entirely funded by the Earl C. Sams Foundation. After its opening, the zoo was given to the city of Brownsville. History The zoo was planned, built, stocked, and given by the Earl C. Sams Foundation to the City of Brownsville. It opened on 3 September 1971. The first addition to its exhibits was the Herpetarium, which opened in April 1973. The zoo has been the single largest recipient from the foundation funds established by Sams. The zoo published the first issue of its Zoo News (its official newsletter and now a quarterly publication) in January 1972. The naturalistic exhibits at the zoo won the 1979 Texas Building Branch of Associated General Contractors Outstanding Construction Award. In 1978, the zoo launched its summer study programs on a trial basis with classes for children in grades 1 through 12. Although only four classes were taught that summer, the program has expanded over the years and now includes classes in the spring and fall as well as summer. The zoo also received accreditation from the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA) in 1978. In subsequent years, Orangutan Island was enlarged, the Herpetarium was expanded with a new aquatic wing, and many other exhibits as well as facilities such as the gift shop, offices, and concession stands were remodeled or added. Most of these projects were made possible by the zoo's annual Zoofari fundraisers. In 1986, the zoo created an endowment fund with the help of matching grants from the Earl C. Sams (dollar for dollar up to $2 million) and the Lightner Sams Foundation (dollar for dollar up to $1 million). Income from this permanent endowment now ensures that the zoo can maintain and improve itself. The Australian exhibit opened in February 1988 -- the largest addition to the zoo since its opening. The Education department was also expanded in 1989 and a walk-through aviary (Zack's Aerie, made possible by private donations) was also opened.

Colonisation often refers to successful immigration where a population becomes integrated into a community, having resisted initial local extinction. One classic model in biogeography posits that species must continue to colonize new areas through its life cycle (called a taxon cycle) in order to achieve longevity.Wilson, E.O. (1962) The nature of the Taxon Cycle in Melanesian ant fauna The American Naturalist Accordingly, colonisation and extinction are key components of island biogeography, a theory that has many applications in ecology, such as metapopulations. Scales Colonisation occurs on several scales: *biofilm scales: the formation of communities of microorganisms on surfaces.1\\\\. O‚ÄôToole, G., Kaplan, H. B. & Kolter, R. Biofilm Formation as Microbial Development. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 54, 49‚Äì79 (2000). *small scales: colonising new sites, perhaps as a result of environmental change. *large scales: where a species expands its range to encompass new areas. This can be via a series of small encroachments or by long-distance dispersal. The term range expansion is often used.Yackulic, Charles B.; Nichols, James D.; Reid, Janice; Der, Ricky. 2015. To predict the niche, model colonization and extinction. Ecology. 96(1): 16-23. Means The term is generally only used to refer to the spread into new areas by natural means, as opposed to introduction or translocation by humans, which are called introduced species and sometimes becoming invasive species.

Artists under contract are normally only allowed to record for that label exclusively; guest appearances on other artists' records will carry a notice \\"By courtesy of (the name of the label)\\", and that label may receive a percentage of sales. Copyrights, payment and royalties Labels typically own the copyright in the records their artists make, and also the master copies of those records. An exception is when a label makes a distribution deal with an artist; in this case, the artist, their manager, or another party may own the copyright (and masters), while the record is licensed exclusively to the label for a set period of time. Promotion is a key factor in the success of a record, and is largely the label's responsibility, as is proper distribution of records. While initial recording deals usually yield a smaller percentage of royalties to the artists, subsequent (or renegotiated) deals can result in much greater profit, or profit potential. A few acts, such as Madonna, Michael Jackson, R.E.M., U2, and Janet Jackson, among others, have signed multimillion-dollar deals. Whitney Houston signed a $100 million deal with BMG to deliver just six albums, the largest recording deal at the time. Robbie Williams signed an ¬£80m (US$125m) contract with EMI. For many other artists, though, for the millions to become tangible, hit albums meeting or exceeding their previous sales figures must follow. Recording contracts may include opt-out clauses for the label in the event an act's popularity dips or the act releases non-hit albums under the deal. For instance, Mariah Carey was dropped by Virgin Records and her $100 million recording deal cancelled after her first album released by the label sold poorly. Record companies put forth huge sums of money to produce, release, and promote an album. Recording time, manufacturing, packaging, photos, distribution, marketing, and music videos are just some of the areas where the label must spend money on an act it has signed. The label usually absorbs these expenses, but in some artists' contracts, some of this money may be due back to the label, unless otherwise worded. Advances (upfront money that is paid directly to a recording artist) are normally always owed back to the label. Once (and if) the advance has been paid back from record sales, the artist then begins to see royalty payments for additional sales. Advancing an act money is a risk the label endures as it does not know how well the act's album will sell. Capitol Records suspended Linda Ronstadt's contract in the early 1970s, as Capitol had spent more money on Ronstadt then it had yielded. She continued to tour partly to pay Capitol back for her 1960s deal, and a string of hits in the mid-1970s allowed her to finally clear the debt. Record companies expect to make a profit, and little concern themselves with a given performer's lack of business or financial savvy, as artists such as George Michael have discovered. \\"Walking out\\" on a deal is very difficult or nearly impossible, as is attempting to strike a new deal without completing an old one. Donna Summer signed a new deal with Geffen Records in 1980, and released an album on Geffen. She was then told by her previous label, Polygram Records, that she owed them another album, per her agreement. She recorded and delivered an album to Polygram that the label released, and it became a hit. Summer then went back to recording for Geffen Records for her next project. The Mamas & the Papas were forced into a reunion, years after their 1968 breakup, by the letter of their Dunhill Records contract, which required one more album to be completed -which became 1971's People Like Us. Record companies will generally increase royalty rates or give artistic freedom to get acts to re-sign contracts with them once the original deal has been fulfilled. Established acts may otherwise go where they see better opportunity. During 1980, Diana Ross released her album diana, which fulfilled her contract with Motown Records. The album spawned three US hits (a #1 and two top tens) and sold 10 million copies worldwide. Ross, however, felt she was never fairly compensated by Motown for her work with The Supremes or her solo releases. When RCA Records offered her $20 million to sign with them, Ross gave Motown the chance to match the deal, or at least offer something almost comparable. Motown, believing Ross's solo career was too up-and-down, and not seeing any reason to now compensate her for her earlier Supremes work, offered $3 million. Split with the decision to remain with the label that made her famous, or sign a deal with a company that was willing to pay her what she felt she was worth, she ultimately signed with RCA. That $20 million deal was the biggest recording contract at the time. She had signed with RCA for North America only, she signed a separate longterm contract with Capitol/EMI for international territories. That contractual amount was never officially released. However, it is believed to be as much as $20 more million and she has remained currently signed with them for over 30 years and has produced many more successful recordings internationally including her multi-platinum 1991 release, The Force Behind the Power and an even greater success with a greatest hits compilation, One Woman: The Ultimate Collection that sold over 1.5 million in the United Kingdom alone, spending several weeks at #1. There are plenty examples of recording contracts available in music business guides, legal texts and also online. Termination When recordings go out of print, this typically happens because either the label has decided that continuing to sell (or distribute) the record will not be profitable, or the licensing agreement with the artist has expired. (Labels may also stop distribution as a punitive measure, if an artist fails to comply with their contract, or as a strategic measure if negotiations for a new one prove difficult.) Record labels can also become bankrupt like any business, and their masters and copyrights sold or traded as part of their assets. (Occasionally these are purchased by the artists themselves.) Recording artists signed to a failed label can find themselves in limbo, unable to record for anyone but a company that is out of business (and thus cannot sell or distribute their records), and with their existing works unavailable for sale. When one label \\"buys out\\" another (or a label is purchased by an outside party), any existing copyrights and contracts held (and masters, if owned by the label) normally go with the sale.

The great aqueducts, which were among the first in the United States, carried water by gravity from the Croton River in Westchester County to reservoirs in Manhattan. It was built because local water resources had become polluted and inadequate for the growing population of the city. Although the aqueduct was largely superseded by the New Croton Aqueduct, which was built in 1890, the Old Croton Aqueduct remained in service until 1955. Background The island of Manhattan, surrounded by brackish rivers, had a limited supply of fresh water available. It dwindled as the city grew rapidly after the American Revolutionary War, and fresh water sources became polluted by effluent. Before the aqueduct was constructed, residents of New York obtained water from cisterns, wells, natural springs, and other bodies of water. But rapid population growth in the 19th century, and encroachment on these areas as Manhattan moved further north of Wall Street, led to the pollution of many local fresh water sources. Below Grand Street, a small number of well-off customers of the Manhattan Company had fresh water delivered to them, but that company was actually more focused on banking--it eventually became Chase Manhattan--and only paid as much attention to its water activities as it needed to avoid losing the state charter that allowed it to bank. pp. 360, 362, 589 The poor and the rest of the city were forced to rely on well water, often made palatable by adding alcoholic spirits, prompting temperance campaigners to call for the municipal provision of water. The unsanitary conditions caused an increase in disease. Epidemics of yellow fever ravaged the city. A polluted aquifer, overcrowded housing, the lack of sewers, public ignorance of basic sanitary conditions, and the existence of polluting industries near wells and residential areas contributed to an unprecedented mortality rate of 2.6% (1 death per 39 inhabitants) in 1830. Then in 1832 cholera first reached New York in the deadliest epidemic to that date. The need for a new supply of fresh water was crucial. Construction Ossining, from a 1907 postcard; upper arch carries the aqueduct, the lower one carries a local street In March 1833, Major David Bates Douglass, engineering professor at West Point Military Academy, was appointed to survey and estimate the proposed route. In 1837, construction began on a massive engineering project, to divert water from sources upstate, following a route surveyed by DouglassA Trail through History (Old Croton Aqueduct Staste Park brochure). and supervised by Douglass' successor, Chief Engineer John B. Jervis. The Croton River was dammed, aqueducts were built, tunnels dug, piping laid, and reservoirs created. The gravity-fed aqueduct dropped 13 inches per mile, 1/4\\" per 100' (~0.02%). An elliptical tube, 8.5 feet (2.6m) high by 7.5 feet (2.3m) wide, of iron piping encased in brick masonry was laid, sometimes in cuts, with conical ventilating towers every mile or so, to relieve pressure and keep the water fresh. Hydraulic cement was added where the aqueduct crossed rivers. It extended from the Old Croton Dam in northern Westchester County to the Harlem River, where it continued over the High Bridge at 173rd Street and down the West Side of Manhattan and finally into a Receiving Reservoir located between 79th and 86th streets and Sixth and Seventh Avenues; the site is now the Great Lawn and Turtle Pond in Central Park. The Receiving Reservoir was a rectangular tank within fortress-like rusticated retaining walls, long and wide; it held up to of water. flowed into it daily from northern Westchester. The Full Flow, Design capacity, of the elliptical tube: 8201 CFM, or 88 MGD. Profile and Ground Plan of the Lower Part of Croton Aqueduct From the Receiving Reservoir, water flowed down to the Croton Distributing Reservoir, better known simply as the Croton Reservoir, a similar fortified tank located on Fifth Avenue between 40th Street and 42nd Street, where the New York Public Library Main Branch and Bryant Park are located today. This reservoir was built to resemble ancient Egyptian architecture. New Yorkers came uptown for the fine view of the city obtained from atop its walls. The aqueduct opened to public use with great fanfare on October 14, 1842. The day-long celebration culminated in a fountain of water that spouted to a height of 50 feet (15 m) from the beautifully decorated cast iron Croton Fountain in City Hall Park. Among those present was James Renwick, Jr., who went on to design Grace Church in New York, the Smithsonian Institution Building in Washington, D.C., and St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York, and was involved in the architectural and engineering work on the aqueduct as an up-and-coming 18-year-old. Croton Distributing Reservoir (1842) Impact on the city Water started flowing through the aqueduct on June 22, 1842, taking 22 hours for gravity to take the water the 41 miles (66 km) (at a velocity of ) to reach Manhattan. Even though only 6,175 houses had been connected to the system by 1844, the Croton water had already dramatically improved both domestic hygiene and interior design. Baths and running water were being built in the private homes of wealthy New Yorkers, and public bathing facilities were constructed for the masses. The water system had another inadvertent consequence. The decline in the number of residents drawing water from the city's wells resulted in a rise in the water table, which flooded many cellars. To address this problem, the city built sewers in many residential streets. By 1852, of sewers had already been constructed. About this time the German cockroach attracted attention and was called the \\"Croton bug\\" on the mistaken belief that the aqueduct brought the insects into the homes being connected to the new water supply system.Cockroach insect information & pictures. Retrieved November 29, 2006. Despite its size, the capacity of the Old Croton Aqueduct could not keep up with the growth of New York City, and construction on a New Croton Aqueduct began in 1885 a few miles east. The new aqueduct, buried much deeper than the old one, went into service in 1890, with three times the capacity of the Old Croton Aqueduct. It currently supplies 10 percent of New York City's water. The Croton Receiving Reservoir continued to supply New York City with drinking water until 1940, when Commissioner of Parks and Recreation Robert Moses ordered it drained and filled to create the Great Lawn and Turtle Pond in Central Park. The old aqueduct remained in service until 1955. In 1987 the northernmost portion was reopened to provide water to Ossining.  Old Croton Trail  The Old Croton Trail extends for in Westchester County, providing public access along all but four segments -- in the Getty Square neighborhood of downtown Yonkers, Tarrytown, Scarborough and Ossining -- along the route of the aqueduct. It crosses the lawn of Lyndhurst, following the aqueduct's easement. The trail enters New York City on the eastern side of Van Cortlandt Park and runs through the Bronx alongside Aqueduct Avenue, and the trail continues under the southern part of University Avenue. 1887 engraving from Scientific American shows Old Croton Aqueduct in dotted line looking south from Putnam County. Croton Reservoir in foreground; Manhattan in far background. Both the trail and the tunnel comprise the Old Croton Aqueduct State Historic Park, which was created in 1968 and encompasses the northernmost of the aqueduct and its right-of-way, from Croton Gorge Park to the Yonkers-New York City line. It lies wholly within Westchester County but is under the jurisdiction of the Taconic Region of the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation. The trail runs roughly parallel to Metro North's Hudson Line from northern Yonkers to Scarborough and is accessible from numerous stations on that line. The trail briefly parallels the Rockefeller State Park Preserve and its trails. Access to the trail is easiest where it crosses Route 9, known variously as Albany Post Road, Broadway or Highland Avenue. Heading southbound into downtown Yonkers, the trail goes on-street at Bishop William J. Walls Place and N. Broadway, where it follows the sidewalk on N. Broadway for one block, and then makes a left onto Ashburton Avenue going east. At Palisades Avenue, it makes a right and the trail bed restarts. Remnants of the aqueduct still exist and can be seen along the trail, including 21 stone ventilators, three stone weirs (chambers which were used to empty the aqueduct for maintenance), and one \\"Keeper's House\\" located in Dobbs Ferry. The Keeper's House in Dobbs Ferry was built in 1857 and is the only remaining of four Keeper's Houses that is both on the aqueduct and open to the public. The only other remaining Keeper's House is located in Ossining, but it was moved off the aqueduct, is privately owned, and is not open to visitors. A portion of the Old Croton Aqueduct, running from the Croton River to Manhattan, was listed as a National Historic Landmark in 1992. and The Croton Water Supply System was also designated as a National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark by the American Society of Civil Engineers in 1975. The interior of the Old Croton Aqueduct has been explored and documented by The LTV Squad, Miru Kim and historian Steve Duncan.

His writing is considered original in that it combines the dramatic and sentimental spirit of Romanticism with a highly personal combination of sarcasm, bitterness and dark humour. He is also celebrated for his peculiar wit and anecdotal character, as well as for his turbulent (and ultimately tragical) life. His writing, which is centred in the local and the picturesque and is in a general sense affiliated with the Romantic tradition, is often regarded in contrast to that of E√ßa de Queiroz ‚Äì a cosmopolitan dandy and a fervorous proponent of Realism, who was Camilo's literary contemporary in spite of being 20 years younger. In this tension between Camilo and E√ßa ‚Äì often dubbed by critics the literary guerrilla ‚Äì many have interpreted a synthesis of the two great tendencies present in the Portuguese literature of the 19th century. Allegations that he was initiated in Freemasonry in 1846, are somewhat contradictory as there are indications that, around the same time, during the Revolution of Maria da Fonte, he fought in favor of the Miguelists as \\"helper to the orders of the Scottish General Reinaldo MacDonell\\",A Vida de Camillo Anno a Anno, por Ant√≥nio Cabral, Livraria Ferreira, Lisboa, 1918, p√°g. 59 who was active in the revived Order of Saint Michael of the Wing precisely to combat Masonry. Similarly, much of his literature demonstrates his ideals of legitimism and as a conservative and Catholic traditionalist. Biography Camilo was born out of wedlock and orphaned in infancy, although his origins lay ultimately in Northern Portugal's provincial aristocracy (his father, Manuel Joaquim Botelho Castelo Branco, was the son of an illustrious household in the environs of Vila Real, but lived in near-poverty due to the strict law of primogeniture which then largely excluded younger sons from inheritance). Camilo spent his early years in a village in Tr√°s-os-Montes, where he was educated at home by three unmarried aunts. At the age of 13, he enrolled at the Catholic seminary of nearby Vila Real, where he was educated by Catholic priests. During his teenage years, he fell in love with the poetry of Lu√≠s de Cam√µes and Manuel Maria Barbosa de Bocage, while Fern√£o Mendes Pinto gave him a lust for adventure. In spite of this interest in literature, and of his remarkable abilities in Greek and Latin, Camilo was a distracted student and grew up to be undisciplined and proud. From the age of 17 to his early 20s, he intermittently studied medicine and theology in Oporto and Coimbra and eventually chose to become a writer. After a spell of journalistic work in Oporto and Lisbon he proceeded to the episcopal seminary in Oporto in order to study for the priesthood. During this period Camilo wrote a number of religious works and translated the work of Fran√ßois-Ren√© de Chateaubriand. Camilo actually took minor holy orders, but his restless nature drew him away from the priesthood and he devoted himself to literature for the rest of his life. He was arrested twice; the first time for having unearthed the remains of his first wife (whom he had married at the age of 16, and who had died at 24) and the second due to his adulterous affair with Ana Pl√°cido, who was married at the time. His first period of incarceration was short, apparently thanks to the intervention of Teixeira de Queiroz, an influential judge and, coincidentally, father of the renowned Jos√© Maria de E√ßa de Queiroz. During his second and longer incarceration he wrote what most consider to be his best and most characteristic work Amor de Perdi√ß√£o. Later this phase of his life would also inspire him to write his Mem√≥rias do C√°rcere (literally \\"Memories of Prison\\"), in which he describes the meanders of the then miserable and overcrowded prison of Rela√ß√£o, at the centre of Oporto, intertwined with intimate ramblings of the imagination and biographical fragments. Camilo was made a viscount (Visconde de Correia Botelho) in 1885 in recognition of his contributions to literature, and when his health deteriorated and he could no longer write, parliament gave him a pension for life. In 1886, he wrote \\"Esbo√ßo de cr√≠tica: Otelo, o Mouro de Veneza\\". Going blind (because of syphilis) and suffering from chronic nervous disease, Castelo Branco committed suicide with a revolver in 1890, while sitting in his now-famous wooden rocking chair. Works Camilo Castelo Branco is probably the most prolific of all Portuguese writers, his work including novels, plays, verse, and essays. In addition, Camilo was the first Portuguese writer able to support himself financially from his writing alone. In all, his publications number about five hundred and sixty, but he is best known for his novels. Even though Camilo churned out a lot of work to pay the bills, he never lost his individuality. His familiarity with personalities allowed him to enliven his writing with a succession of memorable characters and Portuguese types, such as the \\"brasileiro\\" (a returned Portuguese emigrant who had made his fortune in Brazil), the old \\"Fidalgo\\" (nobleman) of the north of Portugal, and the Minho priest. Camilo's novels may be divided into three periods. The first period comprises his romances of the imagination, of which Os Mist√©rios de Lisboa, in the style of Eug√®ne Sue, is a fair example. The second period includes his novels of manners, a style he developed and remained the chief exponent of until the appearance of O Crime de Padre Amaro by E√ßa de Queiroz. In these novels he combines realism and idealism, and perfectly captures the domestic and social life of Portugal in the early part of the 19th century. The third period embraces his writings in the realms of history, biography and literary criticism. Among these may be cited Noites de Lamego, Cousas leves e pesadas, Cavar em ru√≠nas, Mem√≥rias do Bispo do Gr√£o Par√° and Bo√©mia do Esp√≠rito. Among the most notable of his romances are O Romance de um Homem Rico, his favorite, Retrato de Ricardina, Amor de Perdi√ß√£o, the collection of novellas Novelas do Minho and A Brasileira de Prazins. Many of his novels are autobiographical, like Onde est√° a felicidade? and Mem√≥rias do C√°rcere and Vinganca. Castelo Branco is an admirable story-teller, largely because he was a brilliant improvisatore, but he does not attempt character study. He has a richness of vocabulary probably unmatched in all Portuguese literature, often using obscure words. At the same time, few Portuguese authors have demonstrated so profound a knowledge of the vernacular tongue. Though nature had endowed Camilo with a poetic temperament, his verses are considered to be mediocre, while his best plays are cast in bold lines and contain powerfully dramatic situations, and his comedies are a triumph of the grotesque, with a mordant tone reminiscent of the work of Gil Vicente.

Turnhout is a Belgian football club, from the municipality of Turnhout. History K.F.C. Turnhout was founded as Turnhout Sport in 1912 with matricule n¬∞148. After World War I, the club was refounded as F.C. Turnhout with the same matriculation. Turnhout managed to advance through the lower leagues, to play twice in the first division: in 1931 and 1936. The second division was their main stay afterwards, until the club was relegated to the third division in 1952. That same year the club was awarded the Royal title Koninklijke, and was called K.F.C. Turnhout onwards. In 1963, again promotion to the first division was achieved, as second division club Thor Waterschei that came in second that year was faced with a bribery scandal. However, the next year, Turnhout itself came under suspicion, and the club was relegated from the top flight even though it finished third last in the standings that year. The next seasons, Turnhout played in the second division, until it was relegated in 1977 to the third division, where they would stay until 1990. In 1991, the 25-year top scorer of the club and second division, Luc De Rijck, suffered a heart attack while visiting the club's physician. It became apparent later that the doctor had applied blood doping to the player, but because of a wrongful connection in the machinery, an air embolism developed in the player's body. The doctor later faced a criminal conviction. During the 1990s, the club came close on several occasions to win promotion again to the first division, but failed each time in the play-offs. After financial problems, the club degraded to the fourth division, and the club's old ground, the Villapark, had to be sold. New management took over the club, and the club was renamed to K.V. Turnhout. In 2007, the club was sold to the Wadi Degla company of Egypt, which also owns Lierse S.K.. During the 2009‚Äì10 season, both Turnhout and Lierse played in the second division, therefore Wadi Degla suspended sponsorship of Turnhout for a year.

Its principal concert venue is the Esplanade Concert Hall. The orchestra also gives concerts at the Victoria Concert Hall, and performs about 100 concerts per year. The orchestra was first established In 1978 with Choo Hoey its resident director. The orchestra's music director from 1997 to 2019 was Shui Lan, and Hans Graf as its Chief Conductor from 2020 onward. History Victoria Theatre and Concert Hall, home of the Singapore Symphony Orchestra since 1980 Several orchestras were formed in Singapore in the colonial period and after independence. One of these, also named the Singapore Symphony Orchestra, was formed in 1945 by the Scottish composer Erik Chisholm in his capacity as ENSA Music Director for South East Asia. Some of its members were from the British army or air force bands, and though it was short-lived, it gave over fifty concerts and played with soloists such as the violinist Szymon Goldberg. Subsequently, until 1979, all orchestras in Singapore were composed largely of amateur musicians. Orchestras of the early periods included the orchestras of Singapore Musical Society, Singapore Chamber Ensemble, Singapore Youth Orchestra, as well as the short-lived Singapore National Orchestra formed by National Theatre Trust in the 1970s. In 1973, at the opening ceremony of the Japanese Garden in Jurong, the then- defence minister Dr. Goh Keng Swee described the absence of a professional symphony orchestra in Singapore as \\"a minor scandal\\". An initial proposal to establish a national symphony orchestra was not accepted, as it did not plan for the inclusion of Singaporean musicians. In 1977, a largely amateur Singapore Philharmonic Orchestra was formed under the leadership of Yoshinao Osawa. Its success spurred further interest in the idea of a national symphony orchestra. After consulting with conductor Choo Hoey about the feasibility of setting up an orchestra that would include Singaporean musicians, Goh Keng Swee persuaded the Cabinet to support the establishment of a professional orchestra. The orchestra would be supported by public funds, and was intended to serve as a flagship arts company for the enrichment of the local culture scene. In 1978, with the support of the Cabinet, the Singapore Symphony Orchestra was registered as Singapore Symphonia Co. and rehearsals began in December, with 8 Singaporean members and 27 members from overseas. Esplanade, main performance venue for SSO since 2003 The SSO made its debut with its first performance at the Singapore Conference Hall on 24 January 1979, with its first Resident Conductor Choo Hoey. The orchestra had 41 members, 14 of whom were Singaporean. The Singapore Symphony Chorus was then formed in 1980. In 1980, the Victoria Concert Hall became home to the orchestra. In 1983, the SSO gave its first outdoor concert at the Istana. Later, in 1985, the SSO made its first European tour, visiting ten cities within Scandinavia, and also performed at the Singapore Botanic Gardens for the first time, conducted by Lim Yau. From 1986 to 1991 (and briefly in 2001), the SSO also created a series of concerts entitled New Music Forum which focused on highlighting Singaporean composers. Additionally, in 1995, Okko Kamu was named principal guest conductor of the SSO. Choo Hoey stepped down as music director in July 1996 and took up the title of conductor emeritus, while Lan Shui became the orchestra's next music director in 1997. In 1999, the SSO performed at the National Day Parade. In 2003, the orchestra moved to its current performance venue, the Esplanade. The SSO expanded to its target of about 90 musicians by the early 1990s. In January 2019, Lan Shui stood down as music director, and was given the title of conductor laureate. In 2019, the SSO celebrated its 40th anniversary with a gala concert. Hans Graf first guest-conducted the SSO in 2015, and returned for a further guest engagement in 2018. In July 2019, the SSO announced the appointment of Graf as its new chief conductor, effective with the 2020-2021 season. Concerts and repertoire  SSO Concert at the Singapore Botanic Gardens The main performing venue for the orchestra is the Esplanade Concert Hall, but concerts are also regularly held at the Victoria Concert Hall. It gives occasional free performances at venues such as the Botanic Gardens and Gardens by the Bay. It also performs in schools and colleges and has a Community Outreach programme to promote classical music to the wider community. The orchestra has toured around the world; notable concerts include performances at the Berlin Philharmonie, New York's Avery Fisher Hall, Beijing's Poly Theatre, and The Proms in London. The repertoire of the orchestra includes Western classical music ranging from early baroque to contemporary classical music as well as Chinese works composed or arranged for a Western orchestra. This is reflected in the program for its inaugural concert that included Rossini's Overture, Beethoven's Piano Concerto No. 5 (soloist Ong Lip Tat), Charles Ives' The Unanswered Question, and the Chinese orchestral piece Dance of the Yao People. Recordings The SSO has made many recordings with BIS Records and other labels. These include the first recording of the complete cycle of Alexander Tcherepnin's six piano concertos and four symphonies on BIS. Other releases include recordings of works by Rachmaninov released in 2012 and 2013 with Yevgeny Sudbin, and the 2007 recordings of Claude Debussy's La Mer.

It is based on an original screenplay by Joan O'Brien and Charles Denton, from a story idea by Joan O'Brien, with additional material from Jerry Lewis. The film was met with controversy regarding its premise and content, which features a circus clown who is imprisoned in a Nazi concentration camp. Lewis repeatedly insisted that The Day the Clown Cried would never be released, but later donated an incomplete copy of the film to the Library of Congress in 2015 under the stipulation that it was not to be screened before June 2024.Noah Nierman \\"Great Read: Silent- movie buffs search the screen for clues to origins of ‚ÄòMostly Lost‚Äô films\\", L.A. Times According to Lewis' son, there is no complete negative of the film, and outstanding copyright issues have prevented its release. Plot Lewis plays a washed-up German circus clown named Helmut Doork during the beginning of World War II and the Holocaust. Although he was once a famous performer who toured North America and Europe with the Ringling Brothers, Doork is now past his prime and receives little respect. After Doork causes an accident during a show, the head clown convinces the circus owner to demote Doork. Upon returning home, Doork confides his problems to his wife Ada, and she encourages him to stand up for himself. After going back to the circus, Helmut overhears the circus owner agreeing to fire him after the head clown issues an ultimatum. A distraught Helmut is arrested later by the Gestapo for ranting about Germany and drunkenly mocking Adolf Hitler in a bar. Following an interrogation at the Gestapo headquarters, he is imprisoned in a Nazi camp for political prisoners. For the next three to four years, he remains there while hoping for a trial and a chance to plead his case. He tries to maintain his status among the other inmates by bragging about what a famous performer he once was. His only friend in prison is a good-hearted German named Johann Keltner, whose reason for being interned is never fully revealed but is implied to be his outspoken opposition to the Nazis. The camp receives a large group of Jewish prisoners, including several children. The other prisoners goad Doork into performing for them, but he does not realize he actually is not very good. The other prisoners beat him up and leave him in the courtyard to sulk about his predicament. He sees a group of Jewish children laughing at him from the other side of the camp, where the Jewish prisoners are being kept away from everyone else. Delighted to be appreciated again, Helmut performs for them and gains an audience for a while, until the new prison commandant orders that he stop. Helmut learns that fraternizing with Jewish prisoners is strictly forbidden. Unable to leave the children in a state of unhappiness, he continues to perform for them. The SS guards break up one of his performances; they knock him unconscious and warn the children away from the barbed-wire fence. Horrified, Keltner fights off one of the guards, but he is quickly cornered and beaten to death. Doork is placed in solitary confinement. Seeing a use for him, the commandant assigns him to help load Jewish children on trains leading out of the internment camp, with the promise his case will be reviewed. By a twist of fate, he ends up accidentally accompanying the children on a boxcar train to Auschwitz, and he is eventually used, in Pied Piper fashion, to help lead the Jewish children to their deaths in the gas chamber. Knowing the fear the children will feel, he begs to be allowed to spend the last few moments with them. Leading them to the \\"showers,\\" he becomes increasingly dependent on a miracle, but there is none. He is so filled with remorse that he remains with them, taking a young girl's hand and walks with them into the chamber.

Before he had been given the offer, several stars such as Bobby Darin, Milton Berle, and Dick Van Dyke were also approached, but declined. Lewis was initially reluctant to take the role, especially after reading the script, stating in his autobiography Jerry Lewis in Person, \\"The thought of playing Helmut still scared the hell out of me\\". In addition, he felt that he was wrong for the part, due to the strong subject matter. He asked Wachsberger: After re-reading Joan O'Brien and Charles Denton's first draft, Lewis felt that he would be doing something worthwhile in portraying the horrors of the Holocaust. He signed on to the project, but, in order to make it, he first had to arrange to perform at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas for a month, in order to fulfill the terms of his contract with the hotel. In February 1972, he toured the remains of Auschwitz and Dachau concentration camps and shot some exterior views of buildings in Paris for the film, all the while reworking the script. He lost thirty-five pounds in six weeks by eating nothing but grapefruit. =Filming= Principal photography began in Sweden during April 1972, but the shoot was beset by numerous problems. Film equipment was either lost or delivered late, and the necessary money was nowhere in sight. Lewis was repeatedly assured that money was forthcoming by Wachsberger, who did not appear at all on set. Wachsberger not only ran out of money before completing the film, but his option to produce the film expired before filming began. He had paid O'Brien the initial $5,000 fee, but failed to send her the additional $50,000 due her prior to production. Lewis eventually ended up paying production costs with $2,000,000 of his own money to finish shooting the film, but the parties involved in its production were never able to come to terms that would allow the film to be released. O'Brien was shown a rough cut of the film in an attempt to acquire the necessary rights to release the film, but after viewing the product decided that it was not fit for release and, therefore, did not enter into an agreement with the producers or Lewis for the unauthorized, derivative work. After shooting wrapped, Lewis announced to the press that Wachsberger had failed to make good on his financial obligations or even commit to producing. Wachsberger retaliated by threatening to file a lawsuit of breach of contract and stated that he had enough to finish and release the film without Lewis. Wanting to ensure the film would not be lost, Lewis took a rough cut of the film, while the studio retained the entire film negative. In January 1973, Lewis stated publicly that the film was in final production, it had been invited to the Cannes Film Festival in May and it would be released in America after that.Jerry Lewis interview first aired January 27, 1973, The Dick Cavett Show ‚Äì Comic Legends DVD, Shout Factory Theatre. The film was never officially released and remains unreleasable due to the failure to secure the underlying rights from O'Brien. Criticism and changes The film became a source of legend almost immediately after its production. In May 1992, an article in Spy magazine quoted comedian and actor Harry Shearer, who claims to have seen a rough cut of the film in 1979: Shearer, who did not know Lewis during the latter's lifetime, gave his opinion why Lewis would make the film: he believed \\"the Academy can't ignore this\\". When asked to sum up the experience of the film overall, he responded by saying that the closest he could come was like \\"if you flew down to Tijuana and suddenly saw a painting on black velvet of Auschwitz. You'd just think 'My God, wait a minute!' It's not funny, and it's not good, and somebody's trying too hard in the wrong direction to convey this strongly-held feeling.\\" The article quoted Joan O'Brien as saying the rough cut she saw was a \\"disaster\\". It also says she and the original script's co- author, Charles Denton, will never allow the film to be released, in part due to changes in the script made by Lewis that made the clown more sympathetic and Emmett Kelly-like. In the original script, the protagonist was an arrogant, self-centered clown named Karl Schmidt, who was \\"a real bastard\\", according to O'Brien. Her script reportedly had him trying to use his wife, who knew the ringmaster, to get him a better gig, and he apparently informed on nearly everyone he knew after being interrogated for mocking Hitler. She stated that the original draft was about the redemption of a selfish man, but that Lewis practically changed the entire story into a Chaplinesque dark comedy √† la The Great Dictator. Had producer Wachsberger retained rights to the material, Lewis would have had the option to adapt the screenplay, reshaping the protagonist. Without the rights, he was forced to seek author approval. Historical controversy and praise From 1949‚Äì1972, Lewis was known primarily for slapstick and sight gag comedy. Although he stated the film was a drama, there was a perception he would make irreverent humor from serious and horrific events. This production, ten years before his dramatic role in The King of Comedy, caused some to believe he was unsuited to the role. However, that did not prevent filmmaker Jean-Luc Godard from saying in an interview with Dick Cavett, \\"it is a great idea\\", \\"a beautiful idea\\", and that Lewis \\"should be supported\\" in his efforts. In the June 2001 Spin article \\"Always Leave 'Em Laughing\\", author Bowman Hastie writes of Life Is Beautiful and Jakob the Liar, similar themed Holocaust films released twenty-plus years after Lewis' The Day the Clown Cried, \\"All three movies shamelessly use the Holocaust ‚Äî and the impending death of children ‚Äî as a vehicle for the star's most base, maudlin ideas about his own beneficent selflessness and humanity. But only Lewis has been vilified for it.\\" In the same article, comedian Janeane Garofalo provided a hint to another issue that has dogged Lewis' production: ridicule. An often polarizing figure, Lewis had detractors. Garofalo said, \\"Lewis' public criticism of younger comics ... only fuels Clown obsessives.\\" Public readings of the script at comedy venues, halted by a cease and desist order (not by Lewis), provided opportunities to mock, as well as four decades of jokes and relentless interrogation of Lewis, shaped a perverse perception of the film. In 2006, writer and editor Lawrence Levi wrote of his interview with Michael Barclay, who in 1991 was planning a new production of Clown, \\"The Clown screenplay was brilliant ... most of what has been written about the film is incorrect or unfair; he was particularly incensed by the comments of Harry Shearer (quoted in Spy 1992).\\" On July 18, 2012, French director Xavier Giannoli stated on the France Inter film show Pendant les travaux, le cin√©ma reste ouvert that he had managed to track down a 75-minute copy of the film and that he had shown it to a number of people, among whom noted French film critic Jean-Michel Frodon. In 2013, Frodon published a text dedicated to the film titled \\"Jerry Made his Day\\" in the anthology The Last Laugh. Strange Humors of Cinema edited by Murray Pomerance.Murray Pomerance (ed) The Last Laugh: Strange Humors of Cinema (Detroit. Wayne State University Press, 2013) The French version of the same text, titled \\"Le Jour de Jerry, et la nuit\\", was later published in the film journal Trafic.Trafic (revue) number 92, Winter 2014. POL In 2017, shortly after Lewis's death, Bruce Handy's article in Vanity Fair, The French Critic Who Saw Jerry Lewis' Infamous Holocaust Movie and Loved It, brought to light a previously unpublished interview with Jean-Michel Frodon. The French critic claimed to have seen a copy of the film in 2004 or 2005 at the invitation of director Xavier Giannoli who owned a bootleg copy. Frodon did not know how Giannoli obtained his copy, and Giannoli declined Handy's request for comment. Frodon reported that while the copy he watched was obviously a rough preliminary edit, it generally followed the published script and did not seem to be missing any major story elements. His experience viewing the film is as follows, Frodon further denies there is any sentimentality in the film, calling it, \\"very meaningful' and stating Lewis is \\"not indulging himself, he is self-caricaturing. He is playing a very unsympathetic character. He's selfish and totally stupid. ... The film finds what I consider a cinematic answer to some real, serious issues, using a kind of stylized setting, both in the costumes and the sets. It's not pretending to be realistic. Instead, it has a very obvious fairy-tale feeling‚Äînot fairy tale, but tale. ... There are details like in the Grimm Brothers.\\" and \\"For me, one of the many elements that draw such negative reaction to the film in the U.S. is that this performance is very far from what is expected from him.\\" It was one of the earliest mainstream films to deal with the Holocaust and to directly depict the Nazi concentration camps. Lewis interviews and responses Due to the film's ongoing mystery and mythology, Lewis faced decades of questions by reporters. Lewis offered the opinion that it was all bad, an artistic failure because \\"I lost the magic\\". Quoted in Entertainment Weekly: \\"You will never see it. No one will ever see it, because I am embarrassed at the poor work.\\" In 2001, an 'inquistive heckler' mentioned the film to Lewis during one of Lewis' motivational speeches, indicating that the man had heard the film might be eventually released. Lewis replied to this comment with \\"None of your goddamn business!\\" The same year, Lewis responded to a reporter's faxed request for information about the movie by calling and telling him: \\"As far as discussing [the movie], forget it! If you want to see any of it, forget it!\\" On January 12, 2013, Lewis appeared at a Cinefamily Q&A; event at the Los Angeles Silent Movie Theatre. He was asked by actor Bill Allen, \\"Are we ever gonna get to see The Day the Clown Cried?\\" Lewis replied in the negative, and explained the reason the movie would never be released was because \\"in terms of that film I was embarrassed. I was ashamed of the work, and I was grateful that I had the power to contain it all, and never let anyone see it. It was bad, bad, bad.\\" He then jokingly added, \\"But I'll tell you how it ends.\\" At Cannes while promoting Max Rose, Lewis was asked about The Day the Clown Cried and said, \\"It was bad work. You'll never see it and neither will anyone else.\\" In October 2012, Australian-based film production company Traces Films recorded one of the most candid and emotional interviews with Jerry Lewis about The Day the Clown Cried. He states in his own words his motivation for taking on the project and his feelings during filmmaking. Mr. Shearer's conjectures aside, Lewis states his motivation for the project as such, He further went on to say regarding the emotional toll and difficulty of the subject matter, \\"I had a talk with myself in the mirror and I said 'Understand one day you'll feel great and the next day you'll want to throw up because reading it disgusts you but playing it is a double disgust'.\\" He said to The New York Times, \\"There's something about the risk, the courage that it takes to face the risk. ... I'm not going to get greatness unless I have to go at it with fear and uncertainty.\\" In a 2013 interview with Lewis, Chris Nashawaty of Entertainment Weekly wrote, 'When asked about all the speculation surrounding the film, he (Lewis) said, \\"I think it's like bad advertising. Still, Lewis seemed to relish being the keeper of one of Hollywood's biggest mysteries. \\"The more I hear about it, the more I enjoy it.\\" Legacy Apart from The Diary of Anne Frank (1959) and The Pawnbroker (1964), The Day the Clown Cried was the earliest attempt by a Hollywood director to address the subject of The Holocaust, and the first to explicitly portray the extermination camps. In the 2016 documentary The Last Laugh, which explored the limits of humor regarding the Holocaust, comedian David Cross reflected Lewis was \\"too ahead of his time. If he had waited 25 years, then he'd be bounding over those seats grabbing his Oscar\\". Similarly Amy Wallace in GQ Magazine wrote: \\"He was mercilessly criticized for attempting to mix comedy with the ultimate tragedy. However, in 1999, when Roberto Benigni's Life Is Beautiful won three Oscars for a similar story line, many noted that Lewis had tried it first.\\" After Lewis' death in August 2017, Richard Brody of The New Yorker wrote, \\"I don't know whether the film is as bad as Lewis himself has said that it is. The point is that, in the early 1970s, when the very term \\"the Holocaust\\" was hardly known and when the extermination of six million Jews by Nazi Germany was a little-discussed phenomenon, at a time before Claude Lanzmann made Shoah, Lewis took it on. He may have been na√Øve to do so with a twist of comedy, he may have been na√Øve to do so with such uncompromisingly direct and untroubled cinematic representation‚Äîbut he also went where other directors didn't dare to go, taking on the horrific core of modern history and confronting its horrors. What childhood can there be with such knowledge, and what comedy? The moral complicity, the self-scourging accusation of the role of the clown in amusing children en route to their destruction, is itself as furious a challenge to himself, and to the entertainment of the time, as any by the most severe critic of media.\\" Lewis was at the forefront of what became a Hollywood genre, films exploring the events and personal experiences of the Holocaust. He was doing so at a time of virtually no Holocaust scholarship in academia, minimal recognition of the loss of European Yiddish culture, with limited public documentation, and only the initial stirrings of survivor testimonies. Viewings and footage On April 9, 2012, Flemish public service broadcaster VRT re-released‚Äîon its cultural website Cobra.be‚Äîa film piece its predecessor BRT had aired 40 years earlier to the day on the film show Premi√®re-Magazine. It includes behind-the-scenes footage shot in a Paris circus and some takes with sound from the film. On February 3, 2016, German public TV ARD aired a 2-hour documentary called Der Clown.Der Clown Tagesschau (German language) German film maker Eric Friedler shows interviews, a 31-minute version of original footage and re-staged scenes from the original scripts with some Swedish actors who participated in Lewis' movie. Finally, the film shows the first full interview with Lewis about his work after 43 years. The documentary was later put on DVD and shown theatrically at the Deutsches Filminstitute. In June 2016, a 31-minute version from Der Clown was uploaded to YouTube and Vimeo by editor Kay Brown, and dubbed into German with English subtitles, marking the first time a version of The Day the Clown Cried was made available to the general public.The Day The Clown Was Yanked, by Jeffrey Wells June 16, 2016, Hollywood Elsewhere It has since been removed. Fans and critics alike hope for the film's eventual release. The Jerry Lewis official museum website (archived) states: \\"The film has been tied up in litigation ever since, and all of the parties involved have never been able to reach an agreeable settlement. Jerry hopes to someday complete the film, which remains to this day a significant expression of cinematic art, suspended in the abyss of international litigation\\". In June 2018, at a public auction of items from the Lewis estate, were an original annotated script, polaroids of exteriors, and an original costume. In a January 2019 interview with World Over, Lewis‚Äô son Chris stated there is no complete negative of the film and that outstanding copyright issues prevented a release. Early possible remakes Jim Wright revealed to the press his plan to produce a new version of The Day the Clown Cried, and he mentioned he had Richard Burton in mind for the title role. Despite major buzz about the project, nothing concrete came out of the planning stages. By 1991, producer Michael Barclay announced that he and Tex Rudloff (apparently with the help of Washington lobbyist Jack Abramoff) were preparing a joint production of Clown with the Russian film studio Lenfilm. Robin Williams had allegedly been offered the leading role and given a copy of the script. Jeremy Kagan, who made The Chosen, reportedly was slated to direct the film, but once again the idea was dropped before it was officially greenlit. In 1994, William Hurt was considered to play the role, but nothing came to fruition. Discussion of the film in the mainstream press was rekindled in the late 1990s due to the release of two films with similar themes, Life Is Beautiful (1997) and the remake of Jakob the Liar (1999). The latter starred Robin Williams, whose name had previously been attached to the planned remake. The film Adam Resurrected (2009), adapted from Yoram Kaniuk's novel of the same name published in 1968, has also drawn comparisons. Possession by the Library of Congress On August 5, 2015 the Los Angeles Times reported that Lewis had donated a copy of the film to the Library of Congress, under the stipulation that it not be screened before June 2024. The Library of Congress intends to eventually screen it at their Audio Visual Conservation campus in Culpeper, Virginia. Rob Stone, curator of the Library of Congress, has stated that they will not be able to loan the film to other theaters or museums without permission from Lewis' estate. Stone has also stated that they do not have any intent to release the film in any form of home media. In a December 2018 article for The New York Times, Stone stated the LOC does not have a complete print of the film.

He is best known for the Hare‚ÄìHawes‚ÄìCutting Act, the first U.S. law granting independence to the Philippines, and for earlier work assisting the Republic of Hawaii become a U.S. territory. Early life Harry B. Hawes was born in Covington, Kentucky to Smith Nicholas and Susan Elizabeth (Simrall) Hawes. His grandfather was Richard Hawes, U.S. Congressman and second Confederate Governor of Kentucky. The Hawes family was active in politics dating back to America's earliest days. Besides Harry's grandfather, his grand-uncles Aylett Hawes and Albert Gallatin Hawes as well as cousin Aylett Hawes Buckner were well-known political figures of the 19th century. After receiving his basic education in Kentucky, Hawes moved to St. Louis, Missouri in 1887. An old friend and Army comrade of his fathers soon found Hawes a position with the Third National Bank of St. Louis, where he worked while also pursuing higher education in his free time. He graduated from Washington University School of Law in 1896 and began a law practice under former Missouri Lieutenant Governor Charles P. Johnson, focusing mostly on corporate and international law. This led Hawes to become involved in the issue of American annexation of the Hawaiian Islands. He served as a delegate to the Trans-Mississippi Congress, a convention held in Salt Lake City, Utah to discuss matters of statehood for existing U.S. territories and annexation of new lands. At the convention he became acquainted with Lorrin A. Thurston, one of the leaders of the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii in 1893 and establishment of the Republic of Hawaii. A non-binding resolution in support of making Hawaii a U.S. territory was passed in no small part due to Hawes outspoken debate in favor. As a reward of sorts Thurston and the Republic of Hawaii offered Harry Hawes a diplomatic position and made him legal consul to guide their lobbying efforts, a position he held until Hawaii officially became a territory in 1898. His Hawaiian goals achieved, Hawes returned to St. Louis, where on November 13, 1899, he married Eppes Osborne Robinson, whose own family's political pedigree traced back in Virginia to pre-Revolutionary War days. Hawes also formed a new law practice, Johnson, Houts, Marlatt, & Hawes, with three other young up and coming attorneys. The firm quickly became one of Missouri's most successful in that era. Around the same time, in 1898, Harry Hawes was appointed to the St. Louis Police Board by an old friend, Missouri Governor Lon Vest Stephens. As chairman of the Police Board he received notoriety for his handling the St. Louis Streetcar Strike of 1900. Thousands of labor supporters rallied on behalf of the workers and considerable damage to property ensued over the spring and summer months, prompting a Federal judge to order Hawes and the Police Board to swear in a 2,500 man posse comitatus to help stop the unrest. In the period between May and September, 1900, fourteen people were killed and two hundred wounded before the strike ended. Reappointed to the board again in 1901 by Governor Alexander M. Dockery, Hawes continued to serve in that position until 1904. Harry B. Hawes around 1903. Political and military service Harry B. Hawes entry into Missouri politics came in 1904, when he sought the Democratic nomination for governor. At the 1904 state Democratic convention Hawes was tapped as one of three candidates to possibly represent the party in the general election. Considering that the Democrats had held the governorship every term since 1873, it was likely that the convention winner would be the next Missouri Governor. However, it was not to be for Harry Hawes as he lost out to fellow Democrat and future Governor Joseph W. Folk by a wide margin. Hawes' next foray into elective politics was more successful, as in 1916 was elected to the Missouri House of Representatives. While brief, his career in the House was eventful. Hawes authored bills that created the Missouri Highway Department and revised state traffic laws. He also served as chairman of the Good Roads committee and led the effort to pass a $60 million bond issue for creation of the states first highway system. Pertaining to river transportation and its importance to Missouri, Hawes was one of the chief organizers of the \\"Lakes to the Gulf Waterway Association\\", whose goal was creating a series of locks & dams along the Mississippi, Illinois and Missouri rivers that would enable easier shipment of grain and other goods. Along with politics, military service was a long tradition in the Hawes family going back to the Revolutionary War. Harry's own father had been a Confederate Army Captain, badly wounded at the Battle of Shiloh. With America's entry into World War I in April, 1917 Hawes resigned from the Missouri House to serve in the military. Commissioned a Captain in the U.S. Army, Hawes served in the Psychological section of Military Intelligence. Working in France and Spain during the war, he was eventually assigned as military attach√© to the U.S. Embassy in Madrid. Promoted to Major, Hawes was discharged in 1919. Returning home to Missouri, Harry B. Hawes was elected to the Missouri's 11th congressional district, United States House of Representatives in the election of 1920, edging out Republican Bernard P. Bogy by a little over 2,000 votes. Alleged voting irregularities, including destroyed ballots, led Bogy to mount a legal challenge to the election outcome. Hawes counter claimed that Bogy was not a legal resident of the 11th Congressional district thus ineligible to serve. Several weeks of legal maneuvers followed before Hawes was again certified as the election victor. He would subsequently be reelected in 1922 and 1924, serving in the Sixty-seventh, Sixty-eighth, and Sixty-ninth Congresses. Hawes resigned before completing his third term in the House, stepping down on October 15, 1926. The following month he was elected to the Senate. Because Senator Selden P. Spencer had died in office, Hawes took his Senate seat three months early, on December 6, 1926, replacing interim appointee George H. Williams. As Senator, Hawes worked for better flood control. This tied in with his earlier involvement with the Lakes to the Gulf Waterway Association when his \\"Missouri Plan\\" for levees along the Mississippi River was passed by Congress in 1929. An avid outdoorsman, he also supported efforts in wildlife conservation and was appointed to the Migratory Bird Conservation Commission in 1929. Senator Harry Hawes best-known achievement in Congress was the legislation that bears his name, the Hare‚ÄìHawes‚ÄìCutting Act. Created in conjunction with Representative Butler B. Hare of South Carolina and New Mexico Senator Bronson M. Cutting, the act aimed to grant the Philippine Islands full independence in graduated steps over a ten-year period. The legislation passed Congress in December 1932, but was vetoed by President Herbert Hoover. When Congress resumed work after the holiday break they overrode the veto on January 17, 1933. However one prerequisite of the act was ratification by the Philippine Senate, which failed to happen. The next year, 1934, a second effort very similar to the Hare-Hawes-Cutting act, the Tydings‚ÄìMcDuffie Act was finally agreed upon by the US and Philippine governments. By this time however Senator Hawes had become private citizen Harry Hawes. He did not seek reelection to the Senate in 1932, and resigned from his Senate seat on February 3, 1933. Later life Harry B. Hawes resumed his private practice, specializing mostly in international law, after leaving the U.S. Senate. In that capacity he served as legal counsel for the Philippine Commonwealth as they navigated a path to nationhood and the government in exile while the Philippines were occupied by the Japanese during World War II. Hawes was the author of two books; Philippine Uncertainty: An American Problem published in 1932, and Fish and Game: Now or Never in 1935. As his latter book title would suggest, Harry Hawes continued his wildlife activism after leaving Congress. Among his efforts was promoting the stocking of black bass in Missouri's streams and rivers. Harry B. Hawes died in Washington, DC in July 31, 1947. His cremated remains were returned to Missouri and the ashes scattered on the Current River near Doniphan, Missouri. Family Harry Hawes' parents and younger brother Richard Simrall Hawes moved to St. Louis not long after Harry did in 1887. His father was in failing health due to lingering wounds from his Civil War service, but worked for a time as manager of a wholesale lumber business before dying in 1889. Like his older brother before, a position with Third National Bank of St. Louis was secured for Richard S. Hawes and he would later become a prominent Missouri financier. Harry B. Hawes married Elizabeth Eppes Osborne Robinson on November 13, 1899. They had two daughters, Eppes and Payton. Elizabeth Hawes had studied art early in life, and exhibited with the Society of Washington Artists prior to their marriage.

He was an early founder of the field of military sociology. His students, such as David R. Segal, Mady Segal, and James Burk are prominent and influential military sociologists. Early life and education  Janowitz was born and raised in Paterson, New Jersey, the second son of Polish-Jewish immigrants, and attended Eastside High School.Segal, David R. \\"Profile: Morris Janowitz\\", The Militay Psychologist, Fall 2017, Volumer 32 Number 2.

Janowitz earned a bachelor's degree in economics from Washington Square College of New York University (New York University), where he studied under Sidney Hook (former student of John Dewey) and Bruce Lannes Smith (former student of Harold Lasswell). Hook exposed Janowitz to Dewey's philosophy of American pragmatism, while Smith exposed him to Laswell's \\"Chicago School\\" approach to social science and psychoanalysis.Burk, James.(1991) \\"Introduction: A Pragmatic Sociology,\\" in On Social Organization and Social Control by Morris Janowitz. University of Chicago Press, Chicago. p. 5 Early career and military service  After graduating from Washington Square College, he worked for the Library of Congress and the Justice Department Special War Policies Unit. In 1943, Janowitz was drafted into the Army, where he joined the Office of Strategic Services Research and Analysis Branch, performing content analysis of communications and propaganda in German radio broadcasts, as well as interviews of German prisoners of war. Janowitz's experiences with the war had a profound impact on the subsequent direction of his academic career: \\"This experience with war, with the research that war required of him and with other social scientists engaged in the war effort, crystallized Janowitz's self- identification as a social scientist\\". Later career  In 1946, Janowitz began his graduate studies at the University of Chicago. Before completing his Ph.D in Sociology in 1948, he was hired as an instructor at Chicago. He became an assistant professor upon completion of his PhD. In 1951, Janowitz became a sociology professor at the University of Michigan, where he taught until 1961. Toward the end of his stay at Michigan, Janowitz took an academic fellowship, during which he completed his first major publication, The Professional Soldier. During his last year at Michigan, Janowitz organized a group of scholars around the founding of the Inter-University Seminar on Armed Forces and Society (IUS) to \\"support development of sociological analyses of military organization; to prepare a series of specific research papers on internal military organization; and to serve as a focal point for long-term training in and for the development of a relationship between sociology and the military establishment\\". The IUS remains active to date, and continues to publish the journal Armed Forces & Society.Shields P.M. (2020) Dynamic Intersection of Military and Society. In: Sookermany A. (eds) Handbook of Military Sciences. Springer, Cham. https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-02866-4_31-1 In 1962, Janowitz left Michigan and became a professor in the University of Chicago Sociology Department. In 1967, Janowitz was appointed chairman of the department. In this capacity, he worked to rebuild what seemed to be a once great, but presently fractured, Sociology Department. Janowitz did so by encouraging \\"new theoretical outlooks and alternative methodological approaches\\" through hiring more diverse faculty members from different disciplines. He also sought to reconstruct the intellectual heritage of the department through the creation of \\"The Heritage of Sociology\\" book series. The compilation of 40 volumes in the Heritage series led Janowitz to reflect upon the philosophical foundations for sociology, recalling influential pragmatists such as George Herbert Mead, Sydney Hook, and perhaps most importantly, John Dewey. Janowitz completed his five-year chairmanship of the Sociology Department in 1972. In 1972, Janowitz was honored as a Pitt Professor of American History and Institutions by the University of Cambridge. Janowitz remained in the department until his retirement in 1987, focusing more heavily on his academic pursuits, which culminated into a trilogy of books published between 1976 and 1983: Social Control of the Welfare State, The Last Half-Century, and The Reconstruction of Patriotism. Death  Janowitz died one year after retirement in 1988 on November 7 from Parkinson's disease. Ideas and Accomplishments In 1953 Janowitz summoned a group of scholars, including Samuel P. Huntington, to Ann Arbor, Michigan to discuss the future study of the armed forces. This led Janowitz to cultivate and develop his ideas about military sociology through a Fulbright Fellowship in 1954 and a fellowship at the Center of Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences in 1958, where in 1960 he completed his first major publication on military sociology, The Professional Soldier: A Social and Political Portrait (13). The Professional Soldier was a major accomplishment and established the study of the military as a sub-field in sociology by creating a \\"fertile research agenda\\" which other scholars could and still do follow. It remains one of the foundational works in the area of civil-military relations, and was particularly important given that previous foci of sociology had avoided the study of the armed forces. The Professional Soldier focused on military elites, as well as those officers who were \\"destined soon to join the inner- circles of military decision-making\\"(177).Gordon, Bernard. (1960) \\"Book Review\\", The Journal of Politics. Vol. 23, No.1. pp.176-78 In The Professional Soldier, Janowitz used a methodology which included content analysis, a survey of 760 generals and admirals and 576 military officers from the Pentagon, and interviews of over 100 high-level officers (995). It revealed the changing nature of organizational authority within the military away from a disciplinary model towards subtler forms of personnel management, reflecting a convergence between the military and civilian spheres. Furthermore, the soldier had become more technical and proficient in its functional means, narrowing the gap between the civilian and military spheres by requiring specialized civilian participation in the more technical capacities of the military. The military also seemed to be experiencing a shift in recruitment trends, wherein the demographics of the military after World War II began to more closely resemble those of the American people. Finally, the leadership of the U.S. Armed Forces had become increasingly politicized. This led Janowitz to develop a dichotomous epistemic framework, consisting of two competing perspectives about the proper use of the armed forces in international relations. These perspectives he termed \\"absolutist\\" and \\"pragmatic\\" (996). Overall these trends, Janowitz argued, resulted in a convergence between military culture and civil society; in other words, the civilianization of the military and the militarization of civil society.Maslan, John. (1960) \\"Book Review\\", American Political Science Review, Vol.54, No.4. pp.995-997. He maintained that nuclear war reduced the likelihood of full scale war and that the military would gradually take on many of the characteristics of a constabulary force.Janowitz, Morris. (1960). The Professional Soldier: A Social and Political Portrait. The Free Press: New York. Subsequently, scholars have used this concept in contemporary peacekeeping.Shields, P., & Soeters, J. (2013). Pragmatism, peacekeeping and the constabulary force. Philosophical pragmatism and international relations: Essays for a bold new world, 87-110 Lexington Books (https://www.academia.edu/26385201/Pragmatism_Peacekeeping_and_the_Constabulary_Force). After Janowitz completed his chairmanship of the sociology department at the University of Chicago in 1972, he was able to place more energy into his academic pursuits. These efforts culminated into the development of a trilogy of books published between 1976 and 1983: Social Control and the Welfare State, The Last Half-Century, and The Reconstruction of Patriotism. Of these three books, The Last Half-Century gained perhaps the most notoriety, though all three works never achieved the success that The Professional Soldier experienced. =Perspectives On Civil-Military Relations= After the end of World War II, many began to question the role and size of the peace-time U.S. military, arguing against increased militarization of American culture.Pearl S. Buck, et al. 1949. \\"New Evidence of the Militarization of America.\\" National Council Against Conscription.C. Wright Mills. 1956. The Power Elite. Oxford: Oxford University Press. Morris Janowitz in The Professional Soldier (1960) and Samuel Huntington in The Soldier and The State (1956) formulated two distinct but closely related theories, which provided alternative conceptions to those which emphasized fears of militarization. Both theories concerned the preservation of liberal democracy: Huntington advocated a liberal theory of \\"objective civilian control\\" of the military to protect American democracy from foreign threats, while Janowitz advocated a more civic-republican theory, which encouraged active interconnectedness between civil society and the military in order to foster a greater sense of civic participation.Shields, Patricia. (2006) Civil-Military Relations:Changing Frontiers. Public Administration Review. These theories were informed by basic historical perspectives about the proper construction of civil-military relations in democratic societies. Huntington's liberal theory of civil- military relations seemed to flow from thinkers like Thomas Hobbes, who advocated that the role of the military was to protect society from threats emerging from the state of nature present in international relations, unbound by the social contract; and John Stuart Mill, who argued strenuously that the military must be regulated and controlled by the state so that it may not pursue its own objectives counter to democratic society. Janowitz's theory of civil-military relations, on the other hand, seemed to recall the ancient Roman republic, which embraced external conflict as a motivating and cohering force for domestic culture, and encouraged civic participation and a sense of \\"citizenship\\" necessary for the maintenance of the nation. His theory was also more centrally concerned with civic virtue, inspired through the role of the active participation of the citizen soldier.Burk, James. (2002). Theories of Democratic Civil-Military Relations. Armed Forces & Society. Vol. 29, No.1. As James Burk noted, both theories are somewhat outdated and flawed by today's standards. In Burk's words, Huntington's theory \\"presumes that there is a clearly delineated military sphere defined by war fighting that is independent of the social and political sphere\\". Huntington's theory is said to have overlooked the transformation in international relations occurring as a result of development of nuclear weapons, the arms race, and the threat of nuclear annihilation and overestimated the ability of nations to define and achieve acceptable ends under such a war fighting context. The other problem with Huntington's theory is that it advocated for a more conservative realism in international relations, requiring a more \\"spartan\\" cultural attitude unacceptable to the American people. On the other hand, Janowitz argued that civic participation should be encouraged in American society through the model of the citizen-soldier, but failed to elucidate how such a model would be propagated in the absence of mass-mobilization for major wars. One such method would have been embedding military service within a voluntary national service system, an idea which never found political support in American politics. =Pragmatism= Janowitz earned a bachelor's degree in economics from Washington Square College of New York University (New York University), where he studied under Sidney Hook, prominent pragmatist and former student of John Dewey. Hook exposed Janowitz to Dewey's philosophy of American pragmatism at an early age, though he did not fully explore pragmatism's philosophical foundations in sociology until after founding the Heritage of Sociology series at the University of Chicago. Sociology had been weakly tied to pragmatism at the Chicago School through George Herbert Mead and the theory of symbolic interaction, which emphasized a micro-social research agenda. Janowitz also utilized pragmatism in his characterization of attitudes among military leadership. In The Professional Soldier, Janowitz noted during the Vietnam era a prolonged debate in the officer corp \\"about the legitimacy of strategic objectives and specific military tactics,\\" which unfolded under two dominant perspectives about the appropriate role of the military in international relations: absolutist and pragmatist. Absolutists were military officers \\"who thought more in terms of conventional definitions of victory,\\" while pragmatists were those \\"who thought in terms of changing realities, nuclear weapons and national liberation movements\\"(xli). Janowitz traced these attitudes historically to competing perspectives about the European and East Asian theaters of war during WWII, noting \\"a strong continuity between an officer's estimate of the conduct of World War II and his contemporary adherence to pragmatic or absolute doctrine\\". Those who defined the European theater of war as a \\"measured success\\" were more likely to adhere to a pragmatic doctrine, while those who viewed the European theater as a failure tended to be more absolutist. Moreover, the absolutist perspective was associated with an emphasis on and preference for naval strategy (emanating from Alfred Thayer Mahan's theories of naval power) and strategy based on air power, which were both better suited to conflict in East Asia rather than Europe. In the Cold War period, adherents of both perspectives adapted to the new realities of nuclear warfare through a shared belief in nuclear deterrence, but diverged into competing sub-doctrines of \\"massive and graduated deterrence\\". Thus, absolutists tended to side with Gen. Macarthur's proposal to commence a strategic nuclear bombing of China during the Korean War in order to achieve absolute military victory, while pragmatists were more likely to support limited wars suitable to achieving political objectives.

He is best remembered as a notorious persecutor of the Covenanters, particularly among the people of Galloway, and is still referred to as Cruel Lag. The character of Sir Robert Redgauntlet of Wandering Willie's tale in Sir Walter Scott's Redgauntlet is based on Grierson. Life Robert Grierson was born at the farm of Barquhar, the son of the 1st Tutor of Lag, William Grierson (c. 1626-after 6 December 1665), the Laird of Barquhar, Kirkcudbright, Scotland, and his wife, Margaret Douglas (b. c. 1633), the daughter of Sir James Douglas, of Mouswald, Dumfriesshire. The Griersons were an ancient family who claimed descent from Malcolm MacGregor of Glenorchy, supposedly a key ally of Robert the Bruce, and claimed they had been granted the lands of Lag in Dumfriesshire in 1408 by Henry II Sinclair, Earl of Orkney.Henderson, Grierson, Robert, Dictionary of National Biography, 1885-1900, Volume 23 In 1666, Robert Grierson succeeded his cousin as Laird of Lag and he was for some years Steward of Kirkcudbright. In 1676 he married Henrietta Douglas, the daughter of James Douglas, 2nd Earl of Queensberry; the couple had five children: William, James, John, Gilbert, and Henrietta.T. F. Henderson, Stuart W. McDonald (2004). Grierson, Sir Robert, first baronet (1655/6‚Äì1733). Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. Oxford: Oxford University Press. . Grierson sat as a Member of Parliament for Dumfriesshire between 1678 and 1686. The farm of Garryhorn in Carsphairn parish, one of the lands belonging to Grierson of Lag's estate, and which was used by him and his dragoons as a base from which to conduct their searches for illegal conventicles. Between the 1660s and 1680s the Stuart king Charles II acted to suppress dissent among the militant Presbyterians of Galloway, who refused to conform to the king's authority and in several cases broke out into armed rebellion. The local heritors were charged with enforcing this policy, and Lag, a Stuart loyalist and Episcopalian, proved a particularly energetic supporter. In 1678 he made his own tenants sign a bond in which they agreed not to attend illegal conventicles or to commune with \\"vagrant preachers\\". He subsequently assisted John Graham of Claverhouse in policing the south-west of the country. As a commissioner for Galloway he was given control of one of the military courts set up to try rebellious Covenanters, and in this capacity was responsible for several executions of those refusing to take the oaths of loyalty to the monarch; he also gained a reputation, at least among subsequent martyrologists, of having a particularly contemptuous attitude towards those before the courts, and of invariably denying his victims' requests for a prayer before punishment. Most traditions make Grierson the presiding officer at the court that condemned the \\"Wigtown Martyrs\\", Margaret Wilson and Margaret McLachlan, in May 1685. A Cloud of Witnesses, the principal martyrology of the time, charged him with command of the troop of dragoons that shot John Bell of Whiteside along with four others in Tongland Parish in February 1685, and David Halliday and George Short in Twynholm later in the year. In 1685, after the accession of King James II and VII, Grierson was created a Baronet, of Lag, in the Baronetage of Nova Scotia, and awarded a pension. Subsequent to the 1688 Glorious Revolution, Lag was arrested in May 1689 as a supporter of the old Stuart regime. Although he obtained his release on a substantial bail, and continued to receive his pension from William III, he remained under suspicion as a potential Jacobite rebel and was imprisoned again several times during the 1690s. In 1696 he was charged with being involved with the coining of false money at his mansion, Rockhall, but it was eventually discovered that the house was merely being used for experiments in stamping linen with decorative patterns. For much of the remainder of his life Lag's fortunes were seriously impacted by fines, and he took no further part in the politics of the period, though he continued to serve as a Justice of the peace and permitted his sons to become involved in the 1715 Jacobite Rising. However, the family's status never came under real threat as their connections with the influential Duke of Queensberry, both by blood and by marriage, probably served to protect them to some extent.GRIERSON (GRIER), William (bef.1688-1760), of Rockhall, Lag, Dumfries, The History of Parliament: the House of Commons 1690-1715 Although Lag lived on unmolested in semi-retirement he remained feared and reviled by Covenanters: the writer Patrick Walker (c.1666-1745) in his Remarkable Passages of the Life and Death of Mr. Alexander Peden, described him as \\"a great persecutor, a great swearer, a great whorer, blasphemer, drunkard, liar and cheat, and yet out of hell\\".Walker, Some remarkable passages of the life and death of Mr. Alexander Peden, 1815, p.239 In 1713 Lag handed over his estates to his eldest son William in return for a life rent. The two subsequently fell out over Lag's request to sell some of the property, though the resulting legal cases had the unintended effect of protecting the estates from forfeiture after William became involved in the 1715 rebellion. It was noted that father and son had been \\"thoroughly reunited by the common cause of retrieving their property\\", and Lag was eventually able to transfer the estates back to William in 1725. Death and posthumous legends Laird of Lag's Tomb, near Farthingwell Grierson of Lag was a byword for evil among the common Presbyterian folk in Annandale, who gravely asserted that he, like the other persecutors of the Covenanters, had intimate dealings with the devil, and that he was \\"partly in hell\\" before his death, in evidence of which they told that his saliva burnt holes where it fell, and his feet put into cold water made it boil.Allardyce (ed.) Letters from and to Charles Kirkpatrick Sharpe, Esq, vol 1, Edinburgh: Blackwood, p.4 Lag died, aged 77, at his town house in Dumfries on 31 December 1733, and was buried two days later in the Grierson family burial plot in Old Dunscore Churchyard, the cost of the funeral being ¬£240 Scots. A story was told that on the night he died a chariot surrounded by thunder clouds swept his soul away to hell. Another described how the horses pulling his hearse to Dunscore churchyard died of exhaustion on the way and a black raven flew down and settled on the coffin, flying away only at the moment of burial. The antiquary Charles Kirkpatrick Sharpe claimed that the story regarding the horses was in fact true, and that his grand-uncle Sir Thomas Kirkpatrick, a nephew of Lag's, had both attended the funeral and supplied the horses which subsequently died. Whereas the Presbyterian martyrologists had listed the names of those shot at the hands of Lag's men, the tales that grew up after his death became more lurid, and in later years locals pointed out a spot on Halliday Hill, near Lag Tower, where the Laird was said to have rolled Covenanters downhill in a barrel filled with spikes.Fergusson, A. The Laird of Lag, Edinburgh: D. Douglas, 1886, p. 139 Such stories may not be the stuff of scholarly history, but they vividly demonstrate the loathing and fear in which this man was held by those who were loyal to the National Covenant (1638) and the Solemn League and Covenant (1643) and who hoped, sometimes schemed and even at times took up arms against the Stuart monarchy to achieve religious freedom.cf. e.g. Dane Love, \\"Scottish Covenanter Stories: Tales from the Killing Times\\",(Castle Douglas: Neil Wilson Publishing, 2000), ch.28, [Kindle DX version]. Retrieved from Amazon.com A satirical chapbook poem known as Lag's Elegy, in which the Devil lamented the death of Lag, his \\"champion brave\\",Fergusson, 1886, p. 167 was extremely popular in southern Scotland for around fifty years after his death. Grierson eventually entered folk memory, and was the subject of a strange custom recorded in Galloway and Dumfriesshire in the 19th century. Alexander Fergusson, who published a biographical sketch of him in 1886, recalled that as late as the 1840s some families, including Fergusson's own, used to commemorate Lag's deeds yearly in November by getting someone to dress as the \\"Laird of Lag\\", a \\"beast as hideous as the ingenuity of the performer intrusted with the part could make it\\"Fergusson, 1886, p.7 and which was used to frighten the children of the household.Fergusson, 1886, p.11 The conventional \\"beast\\" walked on all fours and had a long snout made from a large wooden kitchen pestle, with which the performer would \\"smell out Covenanters under the sideboard and other likely places\\": Fergusson said that anything \\"more striking, not to say appalling, to young minds can hardly be imagined\\".

During World War I, he served with the Royal Medical Corps in Malta, Salonika and on hospital ships. After the war he set up in private practice in Paola. In 1921, he married Genoveffa Cecy and had two sons and two daughters: Salvino (a.k.a. Vivi), Hilda, Joseph (a.k.a. Profs), Carmelina (a.k.a. Melina). He died at his residence in Paola and is buried at the All Souls Cemetery in Tarxien. Former King George V (KGV) Hospital - a memorial to the men of the Merchant Navy who died in World War 1 - was renamed to Sir Paul Boffa Hospital in 1976. Politics Paul Boffa entered politics when Malta was granted self- government in 1921 and joined the Labour Party in 1923. He was returned to Legislative Assembly under the Amery-Milner Constitution in 1924, 1927 and 1932 and elected Leader of the Labour Party in 1927. The Labour and the Constitutional Parties formed an electoral agreement (known as the \\"Compact\\") for the 1927 elections. Thanks to this the Constitutional Party was able to form a government with the support of Labour although this was not a coalition in the true sense of the word as Labour refused to assume any ministerial portfolios. In 1932 Boffa was the only Labour Party candidate elected to the Legislative Assembly until it was dissolved in 1933. He was nominated as a member of the Executive Council from 1936 to 1939 and was elected, again as the sole Labour representative, to the Council of Government in 1939. During the World War II, Boffa served with distinction as district Commissioner and ARP Medical Officer in the Cottonera, Paola, Tarxien and Luqa areas. He was awarded the OBE in 1941. Pawlu Boffa Monument at Birgu entrance In the 1945 elections, Boffa was again elected in the Labour Party's interests. He reached the peak of his political career in November 1947, when he became the first Labour Prime MinisterSir Paul Boffa: The doctor and politician - Times of Malta leading a majority government of 24 Labour members. In 1949, following the Labour Party's ultimatum to Britain concerning financial help, the Labour Party split up; but Boffa continued as Prime Minister. He later founded and led the Malta Workers' Party (MWP). The MWP lost the 1950 Elections. Boffa was re-elected to the legislature in 1951 and again in 1953. Though he never again held the Prime Minister's office, he joined a coalition government with the Nationalist Party led by Giorgio Borƒ° Olivier. In this cabinet, Boffa assumed the portfolio of Health and Social Services. The MWP did not contest the 1955 elections and in that year, he resigned from parliament for health reasons. He nonetheless retained an interest in politics, and was nominated Honorary President of the Christian Workers' Party (CWP). Boffa was created a Knight Bachelor in the 1956 New Year's Honours List in recognition of distinguished public services. He was also awarded the 1914-18 Star, the General Service Medal, the Victory Medal, the Coronation Medal and the Defence Medal. Boffa was instrumental in obtaining recognition of the Maltese language in the law courts and the introduction of compulsory primary education and old-age pensions as well as the granting of the vote to women.

(2004) and Darabi (2004). The Grenville orogeny was a long-lived Mesoproterozoic mountain-building event associated with the assembly of the supercontinent Rodinia. Its record is a prominent orogenic belt which spans a significant portion of the North American continent, from Labrador to Mexico, as well as to Scotland. Grenville orogenic crust of mid-late Mesoproterozoic age (c. 1250‚Äì980 Ma) is found worldwide, but generally only events which occurred on the southern and eastern margins of Laurentia are recognized under the \\"Grenville\\" name. These orogenic events are also known as the Kibaran orogeny in Africa and the Dalslandian orogeny in Western Europe. Timescale The problem of timing the Grenville orogeny is an area of some contention today. The timescale outlined in Toby Rivers' recent work is derived from the well- preserved Grenville Province, and represents one of the most detailed records of the orogeny. This classification considers the classical Grenville designation to cover two separate orogenic cycles; the Rigolet, Ottawan and Shawingian orogenies compose the Grenville Cycle, and the Elzevirian orogeny stands on its own. Due to the great size of the area affected by Grenville events, there is some variance in timing across the orogenic belt. Regional variations below discusses local deviations from Rivers' timeline, presented here. Timeline of the Grenville orogeny, after Rivers (2002) Ages are approximated from the magmatic activity associated with the individual cycles of the orogeny. The gaps in the ages of the compression cycles and isotope analysis of hornblende, biotite, and potassium feldspar suggest that extension was occurring when compression had momentarily ceased. Rivers' 2008 paper has now examined the timing of the different periods of the orogeny and reconstructed the timeline based on the spatial and temporal metamorphism of the rocks present. According to this newer version of the timeline which is a composite of Rivers 1997 and Gower and Krogh 2002, the Elzevirian orogeny occurs from 1240 to 1220 Ma, the Shawinigan occurs from 1190 to 1140 Ma and is no longer part of the Grenville cycle, the Ottawan (now 1090‚Äì1020 Ma) and Rigolet (still 1010‚Äì980 Ma) become phases which are grouped into the Grenvillian orogeny. General tectonics Reconstruction of the events of the orogeny is ongoing, but the generally accepted view is that the eastern and southern margins of Laurentia were active convergent margins until the beginning of continental collision. This type of subduction (B-type) tends to emplace magmatic arcs on or near the edge of the overriding plate in modern subduction zones, and evidence of contemporary (c. 1300‚Äì1200 Ma) island arcs can be found throughout the Grenville orogen. The Andes of South America are considered a modern analogue. From about c. 1190‚Äì980 Ma (the actual timing varies by locality) two separate continental blocks collided with Laurentia. Both of these collision events are thought to be analogous to the collision driving modern-day growth of the Himalaya range. For some time one of the blocks was believed to be the continent of Amazonia, but paleomagnetic evidence has now proven that this is not the case. These periods of thrusting and metamorphism were not continuous, but rather interrupted by comparatively quiet periods, during which AMCG (anorthosite/ mangerite/ charnockite/ granite) plutons were intruded into the country rock. Polarities of subduction (which plate overrode which) vary by region and time. Some island arc remnants were emplaced on the Laurentian margin, and some were accreted during orogeny. Timing of these events is constrained by cross-cutting relations observed in the field as well as SHRIMP (sensitive high-resolution ion microprobe) and TIMS (thermal ionization mass spectrometry) uranium-lead dating. The first period of tectonic activity was the accretion of an island arc at some point during the Elzevirian Orogeny. Before the accretion of the island arc took place, subduction between a continental plate and presumably an oceanic plate was taking place. Slab pull and far-field drivers such as ridge push were aiding in closing the distance between the island arc and the continent. Depending on the angle of subduction deformation of the continental crust was already taking place and thickening the lithosphere. By 1.19 Ga the Elzevir back arc basin was closing. From 1.18 to 1.14 Ga extension was occurring in the area. Whether due to lithospheric cooling, also known as thermal subsidence, or the compressional activity in the area reactivated some extensional faults. The extension is marked by the isotopic ages of the previously mentioned rocks. Additionally there is the formation of sedimentary basins which means the margin was quiescent enough that sediments could accumulate. However, in some areas from 1.16 to 1.13 Ga, coeval with extension, there is evidence there was still thrusting and emplacement of terranes occurring. According to one model westward thrusting occurred from 1.12 to 1.09 Ga and then extension was the primary tectonic activity until 1.05 Ga. It was at this point that the Central Granulite Terrane was exhumed and minor magmatism occurred. The precise reason for change from compression to extension is unknown but may be the result of gravitational collapse, mantle delamination, the formation of a plume underneath a supercontinent, changes in far-field drivers on the distribution of stress, or any combination of reasons originating from the fact that our planet is dynamic. The cyclic compression and extension history of this area is similar to the Wilson Cycle. In this area of the world the Wilson Cycle would be creating the basin for the proto-Atlantic Ocean (Iapetus Ocean) General lithology Today, the Grenville orogen is marked by northwest verging fold-and-thrust belts and high pressure metamorphic regimes, as well as distinctive AMCG suite magmatism. Metamorphism is commonly of amphibolite and granulite facies, that is, medium to high temperature and pressure alteration. Eclogitized metagabbros (very high pressure ultramafic metamorphic rocks) are found in some localities, and likely represent areas of deepest burial and/or most intense collision. Throughout the orogen, these sequences of high pressure metamorphic rocks are cut by intrusive AMCG suite plutons, generally interpreted as syn- or post- tectonic. AMCG plutonism is generally associated with asthenospheric upwelling under thinned lithosphere. This is derived from the theory that AMCG plutonism is driven by ponding of olivine tholeiite basalt at the base of the continental crust during tectonic extension. The lithosphere may be thinned either convectively or by delamination, in which the bottom portion of the lithosphere is stripped off. Both models have been proposed for the Grenville orogeny. The Grenville orogeny can be categorized into three sections based on structure, lithology, and thermochronology. The three sections, respectively called the Gneiss Belt, Metasedimentary Belt, and the Granulite terrane are all separated by shear zones. The Gneiss Belt is made up of felsic gneisses and amphibolites that were metamorphosed in the upper amphibolite to granulite facies. Thrusting in this section was low angle, but would have the potential to increase and rotate as it continued and evolved. Shear in this area is referred to as ductile shear meaning the material was cooling and becoming solid, but still behaving viscously or plasticly. The age of this belt is approximately 1.8 to 1.18 Ga. Regional metamorphism is believed to have deformed this area at approximately 1.4 Ga and metamorphic thrusting at approximately 1.16 to 1.12 Ga. The Metasedimentary Belt is predominantly sedimentary and volcanic rocks which have undergone greenschist to granulite facies metamorphism. Subdivisions of this belt include the Bancroft, Elzevir, Sharbot Lake, and Frontenac Domains and the Adirondack Lowlands. In this belt magmatism is known to have occurred between 1.42 and 1.04 Ga depending on location. As with the Gneiss Belt, metamorphism is believed to have occurred at approximately 1.16 Ga. The Granulite Terrane is composed of meta-igneous gneisses including anorthosite massifs. Anorthosites form in plutons and are composed mostly of plagioclase. The rocks of the Grenville Province in Canada are included in this category. The oldest magmatism known in this area dates to 1.32 Ga approximately. Granulite facies metamorphism began around 1.15 Ga and continued for about 150 Ma after the onset, however the continuity of the metamorphism cannot be determined. Regional variations A-type granites. It is important to separate local from large-scale tectonic history of the orogenic belt in order to understand the orogeny. For this purpose, the Grenville orogen is generally broken into four localities: the southern extent in Texas and Mexico, the Appalachians, the Adirondacks and the well-studied Grenville Province of Canada. A portion of the orogen can be found in Scotland, but due to Scotland's proximity to the Grenville province prior to opening of the Iapetus Ocean (modern day Atlantic Ocean), the two share largely the same history. =Texas and Mexico= Texas and Mexico represent the southern margin of Laurentia, and likely collided with a different continent than that involved in the eastern collision. The Zapotecan Orogeny of Mexico is coeval with the later stages of the Grenville orogeny, and they are generally considered to be one and the same. Mesoproterozoic igneous protoliths (metamorphosed to granulite facies during the orogeny) fall into two age groups in Mexico; c. 1235‚Äì1115 Ma and c. 1035‚Äì1010 Ma. Rocks of the former group bear geochemical signatures implying island arc and back-arc basin provenance. The latter group represents AMCG magmatism. These AMCG rocks are somewhat anomalous throughout the Grenville orogen, there is no known orogenic event which immediately predates their emplacement. It is suggested that the regime of subduction under the Laurentian margin (currently in Texas, north of the accreted Mexican terrane) ended around 1230 Ma, and that subduction polarity reversed to bring the colliding continent north, since the Llano uplift, which records the history of the Grenville in Texas, bears no evidence of arc magmatism after this time. =Appalachians= The Appalachian Mountains contain small, isolated exposures of the Grenville orogen. The largest of these, the Long Range Inlier, comprises the Long Range Mountains of Newfoundland. Other exposures include the Shenandoah and French Broad massifs, which comprise the Blue Ridge province of Virginia. Blue Ridge rocks consist of various gneisses of upper amphibolite and granulite facies, intruded by charnockites and granitoid rocks. These igneous rocks were intruded in three intervals: c. 1160‚Äì1140 Ma, c. 1112 Ma, and c. 1080‚Äì1050 Ma, and are massive to weakly foliated in texture. =Adirondacks= This region consists of a massive dome of Proterozoic rock on the New York-Canada border. Both the Elzevirian (c. 1250‚Äì1190 Ma) and Ottawan (c. 1080‚Äì1020 Ma) orogenic pulses are recorded in the Adirondacks, producing high-grade metamorphic rock. A northwest-trending high-strain shear zone separates the dome into the Highlands to the southeast and the Lowlands to the northwest. It is believed that the shear zone (the Carthage-Colton) was a transpressional boundary during the Ottawan, when the Highlands were thrust over the Lowlands. =Grenville province= The Grenville province is named for the village of Grenville in Quebec, and constitutes the youngest portion of the Canadian Shield. Since the area has not undergone any regional metamorphic overprinting since the orogeny, it is considered an ideal study area for Grenville and pre- Grenville age tectonics. Hence, most of what is known about the orogeny and its processes is derived from the Grenville Province.

It is a standard of British brass bands and colliery bands, and is also popular in bluegrass music. The Oxford English Dictionary says the song was the origin of the term \\"grandfather clock\\" for a longcase clock. In 1905, the earliest known recording of this song was performed by Harry Macdonough and the Haydn Quartet (known then as the \\"Edison Quartet\\"). Storyline It was in this Piercebridge hotel that the author encountered a remarkable clock that inspired the song. The song, told from a grandchild's point of view, is about their grandfather's clock. The clock is purchased on the morning of the grandfather's birth and works perfectly for 90 years, requiring only that it be wound at the end of each week. Yet the clock seems to eerily know the good and bad events in the grandfather's life - as it rings 24 chimes when the grandfather brings his bride into his house, and near his death it rings an eerie alarm, which the family recognizes to mean that the grandfather is near death and gathers by his bed. After the grandfather dies, the clock suddenly stops, and never works again. Sequel Work published a sequel to the song two years after, and again the grandson acts as the narrator. The grandson laments the fate of the no-longer-functioning grandfather clock - it was sold to a junk dealer, who sold its parts for scrap and its case for kindling. In the grandfather's house, the clock was replaced by a wall clock, which the grandson disdains (referring to it as \\"that vain, stuck-up thing on the wall\\"). However, the sequel never reached the popularity of the original. The song was covered and translated many times, versions in other languages may vary. For example, in the Czech version, sung by the country band Taxmeni, the song continues with an additional, joyful strophe, narrating further events in the grandson's life: the birth of his son and the purchase of a new clock on the same day, to maintain the family tradition. Czech cover version of My Grandfather's Clock Covers and inspirations \\"My Grandfather's Clock\\" was often played in Britain on Children's Favourites and during that period was recorded by the Radio Revellers. In the United States, a version, without the last stanza of lyrics, was on an extended-play 45 rpm record on the Peter Pan label (the other song on that side was The Syncopated Clock, and the flip side had The Arkansas Traveler and Red River Valley). Johnny Cash covered the song on his 1959 album Songs of Our Soil. Evelyn Knight recorded the song for Decca Records. Also in 1959, it was included on The Four Lads' album, Swing Along. Other versions became popular in other countries; it is well known to many generations in Japan, with a cover by singer Ken Hirai becoming massively popular in 2002. In March 1961, on his album Swing Low, Sam Cooke did a rendition of the song. Bing Crosby included the song in a medley on his album 101 Gang Songs (1961). The song was the inspiration for the 1963 Twilight Zone episode \\"Ninety Years Without Slumbering\\". the Big 3 recorded the song in their album \\"Live At The Recording Studio\\" in 1964 A popular clock toy, marketed by Fisher-Price from 1962 to 1968, had a dial on it that, when turned, caused the music box mechanism in the toy to play the song along with clock-like ticking and moving hands on the face of the clock. An updated version of the toy (which is completely made of plastic and with other activities like a clicking plastic mouse on the side) has been manufactured by Fisher-Price since 1994. Imitations of the toy made by various companies exist and are sold in various countries worldwide. Jon Pertwee recorded a version in 1966 for the children's album Children's Favourites, on the Music for Pleasure record label. John Fahey recorded a solo guitar version on his 1967 album Days Have Gone By. Joan Morris recorded it in 1975, on Who Shall Rule This American Nation (Nonesuch), an album of songs by Work. In 1983, Fred Penner, a Canadian children's entertainer, covered \\"My Grandfather's Clock\\" on the LP album Special Delivery, which was later rereleased as Ebenezer Sneezer on CD in 1994. A version of the song was recorded by Red Grammer on his 1994 family music recording, Down The Do Re Mi. It was parodied as \\"My Grandfather's Grunge\\" by the Kenneth Williams character Rambling Syd Rumpo on the BBC radio show Round the Horne, written by Barry Took and Marty Feldman. Garrison Keillor and the cast of the radio show A Prairie Home Companion recorded a parody titled \\"My Grandmother's Cat,\\" telling the story of an old woman who overfed her cat until it was big enough to knock her down and try to eat her. \\"My Grandfather's Clock\\" is a playable song in the 2008 video game Wii Music. This song was also used in the game, Five Nights at Freddy's 2, made by Scott Cawthon, which was released on 10 November 2014. The chorus of the song plays whenever a music box is wound up to keep one animatronic character away; whereas, the other antagonists are unaffected by it. It was also sung by Maple and Cinnamon in the third volume of Nekopara visual novel series. Original Lyrics Middletown, Connecticut includes this bust of the author near his birthplace. My grandfather's clock was too large for the shelf, So it stood ninety years on the floor; It was taller by half than the old man himself, Though it weighed not a pennyweight more. It was bought on the morn of the day that he was born, And was always his treasure and pride; But it stopp'd short ‚Äî never to go again ‚Äî When the old man died. :Ninety years without slumbering (tick, tick, tick, tick), :His life seconds numbering, (tick, tick, tick, tick), :It stopp'd short never to go again when the old man died In watching its pendulum swing to and fro, Many hours had he spent while a boy. And in childhood and manhood the clock seemed to know And to share both his grief and his joy. For it struck twenty-four when he entered at the door, With a blooming and beautiful bride; But it stopp'd short ‚Äî never to go again ‚Äî When the old man died. :Ninety years without slumbering (tick, tick, tick, tick), :His life seconds numbering, (tick, tick, tick, tick), :It stopp'd short ‚Äî never to go again ‚Äî :When the old man died. My grandfather said that of those he could hire, Not a servant so faithful he found; For it wasted no time, and had but one desire ‚Äî At the close of each week to be wound. And it kept in its place ‚Äî not a frown upon its face, And its hands never hung by its side. But it stopp'd short ‚Äî never to go again ‚Äî When the old man died. :Ninety years without slumbering (tick, tick, tick, tick), :His life seconds numbering, (tick, tick, tick, tick), :It stopp'd short never to go again - when the old man died. It rang an alarm in the dead of the night ‚Äî An alarm that for years had been dumb; And we knew that his spirit was pluming for flight ‚Äî That his hour of departure had come. Still the clock kept the time, with a soft and muffled chime, As we silently stood by his side; But it stopp'd short ‚Äî never to go again ‚Äî When the old man died. :Ninety years without slumbering (tick, tick, tick, tick), :His life seconds numbering, (tick, tick, tick, tick), :It stopp'd short ‚Äî never to go again ‚Äî :When the old man died.

Its source is in the remote western forests of the Pakaraima Mountains and its confluence with the Cuyuni River is near Bartica. As it descends from the Guiana Highlands the river runs south-east, past Issano, then northward to Bartica. The river is a source of alluvial gold.  Sources  Roraima Plateau is the source of the river The river takes source in the Roraima Plateau, three levels of sandstones and conglomerates, crowned by Mt. Roraima (). In Guyana, the two highest levels of the Roraima Plateau are known as Pakaraima Mountains and Merume Mountains. The source of the Mazarunu River is in the Merume Mountains. The area is one of the very few places in the world still inaccessible. In 1992, a joint expedition of the Guyana Defence Force and Welsh Guards members was unable to reach the source of Mazaruni River, even with training, finances and equipment.  Course  The river drops down from each Roraima plateau through three steep sided canyons with many picturesque sets of falls. The first set is Chai-chai Falls. The next is near village of Imbaimadai and the last set is below the village of Kamarang where the Mazaruni River tumbles through last few major falls, the first of which is a few kilometres long gutter known as Chitigokein Falls, which finishes in Coffy pool, a deep pool named after Mehir \\"Cousin Body\\" Coffy, one of the last \\"Porknockers\\" (these are small diamond and gold miners) of Guyana. The term \\"Porknockers\\" comes from the old prospectors having to carry in all their food one of which was salt pork which attracted flies and had to be knocked regularly to keep flies away. According to legend, during the 1950s, Coffy was diving in the river for diamonds when he got the bends, due to overstaying below and rapid decompression. After few kilometres of relatively calm water, the last set of great Mazaruni River Falls begin. The first falls is the Aruwai Falls and the last is the Peaima Falls. Soon after Peaima Falls, the river, which was flowing north-south, turns east-south-east. It passes the Issineru River mouth on the left bank, with the Amerindian village, Issineru, on the other bank. Then, over the lowlands of greenstones of Precambrian Guiana Shield, the Meamu River, Kurupung River and Eping River join the Mazaruni River. Together, these rivers serve to drain the highlands of the Merume Mountains. Next, the Mazaruni River flows past Oranapai Rapids, Kamakusa Landing, the mouth of Merume River, Banana Landing, Tiboku Rapids, the mouth of Equeribisi River, Issano Landing, the mouth of the Puruni River, Kaburi rapids, Marshal Falls, the last set of rapids, Itabali Landing, the mouth of the Cuyuni River, then, near the village of Bartica, finishes into the Essequibo River, the largest river of Guyana.  Fauna  The iron hydroxide stained brown waters of Mazaruni are home to many fish. The most abundant are the large and dangerous black electric eels (numfish), piry (relative of piranha cutleback), haimara, and baiara. However, the most famous fish is lau-lau, with specimens weighing up to . Lau-lau lives in deep pools of Mazaruni River hunting in the night. The waters are also home to a largest water snake, that is anaconda, locally known as the \\"water kamudi.\\" Large herds of peccaries which sometimes number into the hundreds, live on swampy flat of the river. Pumas and the much smaller ocelot are also found there but rarely seen since they hunt at night. Many monkeys, of which the howling monkey is the noisiest, inhabit tree tops, sharing the space with many types of birds. Pairs of red, yellow or bleu Macaws, united for life, often can be seen to fly by. In 2015, a jaguar attacked a three-year-old indigenous girl near the river, in Cuyuni-Mazaruni. She nevertheless survived.  Flora  The Mazaruni River flows over three distinct habitats; the flat tops of Roraima Plateau, known in Venezuela as ‚Äútepuis‚Äù, the lower two plateaus and the low lands. Each habitat is characterised by its own vegetation. The upper one is a fantastic land of rain swept sandstone eroded into fantastic forms with exotic plants trying to survive this inhospitable land of denuded rocks. The middle one is mainly savannas with bands of single canopy jungle, the lowest is a triple canopy jungle. Exotic orchids are found in last two habitats.  Mineral resources  In the upper Mazaruni River basin, in 1890, near Issineru village, first alluvial diamonds were found in Guyana.Venezuela and Guyana diamond deposits, geology, exploration, mining, use - Part I The discovery was made accidentally by Edward Gilkes, was prospecting for gold along the Putareng Creek, a small left hand tributary of the Mazaruni River. Since then, according to Guyana Geology and Mines Commission, Mazaruni River, along with its tributaries (Meamu, Kurupung and Eping Rivers), produced over 50 percent all of alluvial diamonds mined up to now in Guyana. The gravels of Mazaruni River and its tributaries are, as well, gold bearing. Some places, such as Imbaimadai, Kamarang, Aruwai, Tiboku, Kaburi and Marshal Falls produced a large amount of alluvial gold during golden era of river dredging (1980‚Äì1995). The river remains, to a lesser degree, a source of alluvial gold and diamonds. A few miles west of Bartica, there was an unsuccessful attempt to establish a hard-rock gold mine in 1888.

Early life Born in Throop, Pennsylvania, Minish was the son of a coal miner, George Joseph Minish (1894-1932). His grandfather, Vincenzo \\"James\\" Minisci (1860-1920), emigrated to the United States from Italy in 1886. His mother, Angeline Nardozzi Minish (1898-1954), emigrated to the United States from Italy as an infant. Minish had two brothers: James Minish (1920-1928) and Francis X. Minish (1926-2009); and three sisters: Pauline Minish LaBelle (1918-2001); Mary Minish Mecca (1921-2000); and Lena Minish Mecca (1923-1994). His brothers-in-law, Charles and James Mecca, were brothers. He graduated Dunmore High School in 1935, and served in the United States Army from 1945 to 1946. Labor Leader Minish spent his early career in organized labor. He was the Executive Secretary of the Essex-West Hudson Council, Congress of Industrial Organizations, from 1954 to 1960, and the Executive Director of the Essex-West Industrial Union Council, AFL-CIO, from 1960 to 1962. Political career In 1962, seven-term Democratic U.S. Rep. Hugh Joseph Addonizio gave up his Essex County, New Jersey-based House seat to run for Mayor of Newark. Essex County Democratic leaders picked the 46-year-old Minish to defend the seat, which was considered to be politically competitive, especially in the mid-term election of President John F. Kennedy. The district included tenements and low-cost housing in Newark, New Jersey, as well as wealthy suburbs like South Orange and West Orange. He was unopposed in the Democratic primary. In the general election, he faced Republican Frank A. Palmieri, a lawyer who had won 36% of the vote against Addonizio in 1960. Labor leaders rallied behind Minish, who as a first-time candidate pledged to support the Kennedy Administration. His campaign platform included advocacy of \\"Federal aid for education for construction and teacher salaries; extension of the Social Security Act to provide medical care for the aged; 'long-term loans and technical assistance to emerging nations; and the establishment of a cabinet-level Department of Urban Affairs.\\" Minish won by a large margin, 48,102 (59.45%) to 30,244 (37.28%) for Palmieri. Minish spent 22 years in the U.S. House of Representatives, winning re-election easily. In 1964, he beat William L. Stubbs, who had been the first African American to win a major party nomination for Congress in New Jersey. He beat: attorney Leonard Felzenberg in 1966; George M. Wallhauser, Jr., the son of a former Republican congressman, in 1968; businessman James Shue, the father of actors Elisabeth Shue and Andrew Shue. in 1970; and in his first seriously contested re-election bid, former State Senator Milton Waldor in 1972. Later, easily defeated attorney William Grant in 1974; former Essex County Young Republican Chairman Charles Poekel in 1976; businessman Julius George Feld in 1978; conservative activist Bob Davis in 1980; and businessman Rowley (Rey) Reddington in 1982. As a Congressman, Minish served on the House Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs Committee, and was the Chairman of the Subcommittee on General Oversight. The Newark Star-Ledger, which covered Minish's entire political career, said that he was a staunch party loyalist and supporter of organized labor who ran a strong constituent service operation but had no real impact on legislation. Minish was a somewhat conservative Democrat by New Jersey standards. He drew poor ratings from civil liberties groups, supported the Vietnam War, and opposed campaign finance reform and legalized abortion. Minish was described as a low-key Democrat with few accomplishments. During his two decades in the House, Minish was a supporter of big financial institutions and received considerable campaign contributions from the banking industry. He won some headlines for criticizing profiteering by defense contractors and accusing natural gas producers of price gauging. In early 1984, a court-ordered redrawing of New Jersey's congressional districts radically altered Minish's district. Most of the Democratic-leaning areas were cut out, replaced with heavily Republican areas to the west‚Äîmost notably, most of Morris County, one of the most Republican counties in the state. Minish joked that the new map pushed his district so far to the west that he might as well be a congressman from Pennsylvania. Although Minish now found himself in one of the most Republican districts in the Northeast, he opted to run for reelection in the reconfigured 11th. He lost, 133,662 (56%) to 106,038 (44%) to State Assembly Minority Leader and Morris County resident Dean Gallo. Minish blamed his loss on redistricting that made his district so heavily Republican that \\"I'm not sure the good Lord could have survived.\\" He also blamed special interest groups who had long lobbied against him. \\"If you measure a man by his enemies, I'm pleased to have these guys as my enemies. They're no good for the country. They're greedy,\\" Minish said in a New York Times post-election interview. Proving just how Republican this district now was, a Democrat would not cross the 40 percent mark again for 34 years, until Mikie Sherrill reclaimed the seat for the Democrats in 2018. Later life Minish was a longtime resident of West Orange, New Jersey.via Associated Press. \\"Joseph G. Minish, Ex-New Jersey Congressman, Dies at 91\\", The New York Times, November 26, 2007.

His son, George Joseph Minish (1944-1999), sought the Democratic nomination for the New Jersey State Assembly in 1973. He was not backed by the Essex County Democratic Party leadership and was defeated in the primary by Richard Codey and Eldridge Hawkins.

It is formally defined as: \\"[a] unanimous appellate opinion that succinctly states the decision of the court; an opinion that briefly reports the court's conclusion, usu. without elaboration because the decision follows a well-established legal principle or does not relate to any point of law.\\" Black's Law Dictionary, 1201 (9th ed. 2009). Generally, memorandum opinions follow ordinary rules, including the application of precedent and the rule of stare decisis. However, in many courts (for example, the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of New York), the style of analysis in memorandum opinions is much more concise and conclusory than it would be in an opinion intended for publication. That is, long strings of case citations are often inserted without explication or analysis of the applicability of the cited cases. In contrast, the California Constitution requires that all appellate decisions in California must be decided \\"in writing with reasons stated,\\" which the Supreme Court of California has interpreted as requiring detailed written opinions even in frivolous cases.People v. Kelly, 40 Cal. 4th 106 (2006). Nonetheless, the Courts of Appeal have the discretion to certify opinions in frivolous cases for publication.Schmier v. Supreme Court, 78 Cal. App. 4th 703 (2000).

After giving up his House seat in an unsuccessful bid for election to the U.S. Senate in 1914, Connolly then served as an aviation officer in World War I and died in a plane crash in 1921. Background He was born in Dubuque, Iowa on March 13, 1877, as the son of a successful carriage maker, Tom Connolly, and his wife Ellen Brown Connolly.Editorial, \\"Made in Iowa,\\" Waterloo Times-Tribune, 1912-09-22 at p. 4. Connolly attended the common schools. He was graduated from Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, in 1897, where he was a member of the Quill and Dagger society. In 1898, at age twenty-one, he graduated from the New York University School of Law, in New York City. He was admitted to the bar in 1899 and did postgraduate work at Balliol College, Oxford, England, and the University of Heidelberg, Germany. He returned to Dubuque when his father died suddenly in 1903, and assumed his ownership and management of the Connolly Carriage Company. Later, Connolly engaged in the insurance business and banking. Congress Connolly's home in Washington, D.C., while serving in Congress Connolly ran as a Democrat for Congress in 1912, against incumbent Republican Charles E. Pickett. Connolly's hometown of Dubuque was a Democratic-leaning city at the edge of Iowa's strongly-Republican 3rd congressional district, which in Connolly's lifetime had elected only Republicans. Indeed, in every election since 1890, Republicans captured either all or all but one of Iowa's eleven seats in the U.S. House, while holding each seat in the Senate. When Iowa Republicans were divided between Theodore Roosevelt's Bull Moose Party candidacy and Republican Party nominee William Howard Taft, Connolly tied himself closely to Democratic presidential candidate Woodrow Wilson. Along with incumbent Democrat Irvin S. Pepper in Iowa's 2nd congressional district and Democrat Sanford Kirkpatrick in Iowa's 6th congressional district, Connolly was elected in 1912 to the Sixty-third Congress. Senate candidacy In 1914 Iowans had their first opportunity to directly elect a U.S. Senator; until the ratification of the Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution in 1913, the U.S. Constitution had authorized only state legislatures to choose senators. In 1913, 37-year-old Congressman Pepper was the presumptive favorite to win the Democratic nomination for Senate,\\"Congressman Pepper is Dead,\\" Estherville Democrat, 1913-12-23 at p. 1. to challenge incumbent Republican Senator Albert B. Cummins, but Pepper died unexpectedly in December 1913. Connolly ran in the Democratic primary for the nomination.Advertisement, Des Moines Daily News, 1914-05-31 at p. 5. He defeated Edwin T. Meredith in the primary, but was defeated by Senator Cummins in the general election. Connolly was replaced in the House by Republican Burton E. Sweet, who had defeated Democrat J.C. Murtagh. In all, Connolly served in Congress from March 4, 1913 to March 3, 1915. Military service After leaving Congress, Connolly returned to Dubuque to run his family's carriage company. He also became an executive of Dubuque Fire and Insurance Company.\\"Dubuque Manufacturer Killed in Worst U.S. Airplane Accident,\\" Waterloo Evening Courier, 1921-05-30 at p.1. Connolly was an at-large delegate to the 1916 Democratic National Convention. President Wilson appointed him as postmaster of Dubuque. After the United States entered World War I, Connolly enlisted, earning his flight wings and serving as captain, then major, in the Aviation Section, U.S. Signal Corps. He served as adjutant, executive officer and commanding officer at Chanute Field in Rantoul, Illinois, Wilbur Wright Field in Dayton, Ohio, and Hazelhurst Field in Mineola, New York. When the armistice was declared, he was assigned to Washington, where he assisted Major General William L. Kenly, first head of the United States Army Air Service.\\"Connolly in New York,\\" Adams County Free Press, 1920-04-24 at p.1. Connolly also flew in one of the \\"flying circuses\\" of fliers performing to raise funds for the Liberty Loan program. Connolly and future New York City Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia were the only former congressmen to earn their wings in World War I. Death Following the war, Connolly became the Washington representative for the Curtiss Aeroplane and Motor Company.\\"Probe Death of 7 in Plane,\\" The Des Moines News, 1921-05-30 at p. 1.

They released three albums and several EPs, to much critical acclaim, before breaking up in 1999. In 2011 the band reunited for a series of shows in Europe and the United States. In 2016, the band reunited again and, on July 29, 2016, they released their fourth album, Nothing Is Anywhere. The group's sound blurs the lines between punk rock, glam rock and garage rock. History The original line-up for D Generation consisted of vocalist Jesse Malin (who had previously played with New York band Heart Attack during the late 1980s), guitarists Danny Sage (also an ex-Heart Attack member), John Carco on bass, Howie Pyro on guitar, and drummer Michael Wildwood (Danny Sage's brother). The band had not yet been named, although much of the material would later be performed and recorded by D Generation. The line up did not last. After bassist John Carco quit (later to join forces with Dee Dee Ramone), Malin and Pyro (who had switched to bass) continued to play, naming the band and adding Richard Bacchus on guitar, and Sage and Wildwood left briefly to finish up their previous projects and were replaced for a brief time, 4 months only, by Georgie Seville and Belvy K respectively. Sage and Wildwood soon returned, solidifying the line-up that would last for the majority of their career. =Debut release= The band first signed with Chrysalis Records, with whom they released their debut album D Generation. Despite a generally favourable critical reaction, the album failed to garner high sales. =No Lunch and touring= Feeling that Chrysalis was not supporting them and their debut release properly, the band abandoned their contract and moved to Columbia Records, releasing their second album, No Lunch on the label in 1996. The Cars frontman Ric Ocasek produced the record. Around this time D Generation played shows supporting such bands as Social Distortion, Ramones, and KISS. Shortly after, Bacchus left the band, and was replaced by ex-Murphy's Law and Agnostic Front member Todd Youth. The band toured Europe with Green Day in early 1998. Jesse Malin, frontman for D Generation, performing at The Stone Pony in Asbury Park, NJ as part of the Light of Day Foundation Festival in 2016. =Through The Darkness and band split= D Generation then recorded their third album, Through the Darkness, this time with David Bowie and T.Rex producer Tony Visconti. However, once again the album failed to reach the sales that were hoped for, despite scoring the lead-off single on the soundtrack of the film The Faculty just a few months prior. Just prior to the tour in support of that album, Youth and Wildwood left to form the short-lived but critically acclaimed Chrome Locust with bassist Jim Heneghan (formerly of Richard Bacchus's V√°squez), and released one self-titled album. For the tour, the band recruited drummer Joe Rizzo and Richard Bacchus briefly returned on guitar, and was then replaced during the band's last few dates by Jim Wallerstein. The band toured the US with The Offspring and The Living End, before playing their final show in their hometown at Coney Island High on April 24, 1999. This show was recorded by Greg Di Gesu from the Rolling Stones Mobile Studio, and has since remained unreleased. After this, D Generation broke up. =Post-D Generation= After the demise of D Generation in 1999, Michael Wildwood formed the critically acclaimed Chrome Locust with guitarist Todd Youth and bassist Jim Heneghan, releasing only one self-titled record. Wildwood then toured with New Jersey's Monster Magnet and played on their album Monolithic Baby!. In 2005, Wildwood joined Atomic#76. The group disbanded in 2007. Both Wildwood and Sage lent their hands to help Hurricane Katrina victims, backing up Deborah Harry at a benefit in 2005. Danny Sage recorded a solo album in 2002 (which has remained unreleased) and released two EPs, the self-titled Danny Sage and Don't Look Down, in 2003 and 2007, respectively, and has performed live. Jesse, Howie and Joe Rizzo formed the band PCP Highway with guitarist Esko Poldvere. The band recorded a number of demo tracks and toured the east coast of the United States. During the beginning of 2000, Howie Pyro was invited to join Glenn Danzig's band (which then included former D Generation member Todd Youth on guitar). Pyro accepted and PCP Highway disbanded; a planned album, titled Dreamless, was never released. Meanwhile, Bacchus was performing with his new project, Vasquez, which included Eric Kuby on drums and former Hanoi Rocks bassist Sami Yaffa (who replaced original bassist Jim Heneghan when he left to join Chrome Locust). This group released an independent EP, entitled Two Songs. Malin began playing a series of solo shows and released a self-produced EP titled 169 in 2000. However, by the end of that year, Malin had re-teamed up with Esko and Joe Rizzo, along with bassist Johnny Pisano, to form a new band which was initially called Tsing-Tsing (a handful of shows were played under that name) and then re-christened Bellvue. Together they released one album, To Be Somebody in April 2001 on Goldenseal Records. This album was re- released in October 2001 with a slightly different track list. The following year, Bellvue disbanded, and Jesse revived his solo career, releasing the Ryan Adams-produced The Fine Art of Self Destruction in late 2002, followed by The Heat in 2004. He released his third album, Glitter in the Gutter, on March 20, 2007. The fourth album, \\"On Your Sleeve\\", was released on April 2008. It consists entirely of famous rock covers, such as \\"Wonderful World\\" by Sam Cooke and \\"Walk on the Wild Side\\" by Lou Reed. Currently, Bacchus is recording and touring with his band The Luckiest Girls. He released an album produced by Hanoi Rocks / New York Dolls bassist Sami Yaffa titled Jet Black and Beautiful on Stay Gold Records, an independent CD titled The Bicycle Diaries, and a split 7\\" on Old Grey Cat Records. Howie Pyro and Todd Youth have also both left Danzig. Howie currently hosts the weekly Intoxica Radio show on LuxuriaMusic Internet Radio. Todd has continued to play with a number of acts, including Ace Frehley and has sporadically played in Jesse Malin's touring band over the past several years. =Reunion and Nothing Is Anywhere= On April 17, 2008, the band (consisting of Mailn, Pyro, Bacchus, Sage and Wildwood) re-formed for a one-off performance at the John Varvatos store in New York City (located in the space of the former CBGB) as part of a VH1 Save The Music benefit, during which they played a three-song set. In April 2011, almost 12 years after their final show, the band announced that they would re- form to play shows in September of that year in New York City, Los Angeles and Spain. The band also performed a sold-out London show on September 5 as well as the 2011 Riot Fest Chicago in October 2011 and Fun Fun Fun Fest in Austin, TX in November 2011. As a warmup for their New York City shows, the band performed on September 15 at the Wonder Bar in Asbury Park, NJ. Following these dates the band opened two shows for Guns N' Roses in December 2011 on their US tour stops in Auburn Hills, MI and Cincinnati, OH. On December 13, 2011, Jesse Malin stated, in an interview with Rolling Stone, that the band will be going into rehearsals for a new album in January 2012.D Generation Plan to Make New Music  Music News  Rolling Stone It was later announced, via various tweets from the band's Twitter page, that the band had entered the studio to start work on a new album to be produced by Ryan Adams, however the material from those sessions has remained unreleased. On April 18, 2015, D Generation released a 10\\" single titled Queens of A for Record Store Day that featured two new songs (\\"Queens of A\\" and \\"Piece of the Action\\"). These songs were the band's first release of new music since 1999. D Generation's first album in seventeen years was released on July 29, 2016 and is titled Nothing Is Anywhere. It was produced by guitarist Danny Sage. The band did a few east coast dates at the end of July 2016 to coincide with this release in Ringwood, NJ, Philadelphia, PA and New York City. This was followed by a handful of west coast dates during the last week of August 2016, with their show at Doug Fir Lounge in Portland, OR on August 30, 2016 being their last live performance to date.

Kingslake was born in London, England in 1903 as Rudolf Klickmann. The latter is in all probability a re- transcription from Cyrillic of the traditional German-Jewish \\"Gl√ºckmann\\" meaning \\"lucky man\\". Kingslake studied optical design at the Imperial College of Science and Technology, under the eminent optical designer and theoretician Alexander Eugen Conrady, earning a master's degree, subsequently marrying Professor Conrady's daughter, Hilda Conrady Kingslake, a prominent English- American researcher in the field of optics. In 1929, Kingslake was invited to come to the United States to teach at the University of Rochester, where he founded the Institute of Applied Optics, now known as The Institute of Optics. In 1937, Kingslake became the head of Optical Design department of Eastman Kodak while continuing his teaching at the university. In 1958, Kingslake and wife Hilda edited an unfinished manuscript by Conrady and published a sequel to Conrady's book, Applied Optics and Optical Design. Since 1974, SPIE has awarded the Rudolf Kingslake Medal to recognize the most noteworthy original paper published in the society's journal, Optical Engineering.

Early life Gilman was born in Poughkeepsie, New York, the son of Esther (Gold) and Harry Gilman. His parents were Austrian Jewish immigrants. Gilman graduated from Middletown High School in Middletown, New York in 1941 and received a B.S. from the Wharton School Finance at the University of Pennsylvania in 1946. He also earned an LL.B. from New York Law School. Gilman served in the United States Army Air Corps from 1942 until 1945 during World War II. During that conflict, he flew 35 missions over Japan, earning the Distinguished Flying Cross and the Air Medal with Oak Leaf Clusters.Beloved Former Congressman Benjamin Gilman Dies at 94, by Jane Anderson. Hudson Valley Magazine. http://www.hvmag.com/Congressman-Benjamin-Gilman-dies-at-94/ Early career After graduating New York Law School in 1950, Gilman served as assistant attorney general to the Attorney General of New York from 1953 until 1955. Following this, he practiced law privately in his hometown of Middletown, New York. Gilman was a member of the New York State Assembly from 1967 to 1972, sitting in the 177th, 178th and 179th New York State Legislatures. He was a member of the New York State Southeastern Water Commission. Tenure Gilman first won election to Congress in 1972 to represent New York's 26th congressional district. New York‚Äôs congressional districts had been redrawn in reapportionment, and in the general election Gilman defeated incumbent congressman John G. Dow, a Democrat who had been serving in New York's 27th congressional district, (which included most of the territory and population of the new 26th district). Gilman subsequently served in Congress from January 3, 1973, until January 3, 2003. During his time in Congress, he was chair of the House Committee on International Relations (104th through 106th Congresses). He was widely regarded as a moderate Republican in the mold of New York‚Äôs Nelson Rockefeller He was active on foreign affairs issues, serving as a Congressional delegate to the United Nations, serving under Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick in 1981. He was a Member of the Ukraine Famine Commission, a member of the U.S., European, Canadian and Mexican Interparliamentary conferences, and a Congressional Advisor to the U.N. Law of the Sea Conference. He was co-chair of the Committee on Irish Affairs and participated on the International Task Force on Narcotics. He was a recipient of the Secretary's Distinguished Service Award, a gold medal and certificate which represents the highest civilian honor bestowed by the State Department. Throughout his years in Congress, he was a member of the House Post Office and Civil Service Committee, the name of which evolved into the Government Reform and Oversight Committee in the 1990s. As a co-founder of the House Select Committee on Narcotics, he served as a senior member on that Committee (1977‚Äì1989) and continued to serve as a member until the Committee was abolished in 1993. During the 1970s, Gilman became closely identified with the issue of Prisoners of War and Missing in Action in Southeast Asia. He served on the Select Congressional Committee on that problem, and was one of only two Members of Congress to vote in opposition to closing the book on the POW/MIA situation. He also became involved with World hunger in the 1970s, authoring the legislation creating a presidential Commission Against Hunger, to which he was subsequently appointed by President Jimmy Carter. As the chair of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, from 1995 to 2002, Congressman Gilman consistently advocated stronger ties with India , as a counterweight against Chinese influence in the region, particularly in Pakistan. During the Kargil War against Pakistan, he urged American lawmakers to pressure the Pakistani government to withdraw from the conflict, stating that he held Pakistan solely responsible for the conflict. During a Hearing on the Status of Negotiations between China and Tibet in April 2000, Congressman Gilman said, ‚ÄúThe Tibetan cause enjoys the global support that it does because it is a courageous attempt by a Nation and a people who are trying to regain what is rightfully theirs by throwing off the repression of colonization. It is in the interest of international stability to have Tibet once again serve as it had for 2000 years as a buffer zone strategically placed between India and China.‚Äù In recognition of his contribution to furthering U.S. ties with India, he was awarded that country's second highest civilian honor, the Padma Vibhushan, in 2001. He is one of only 12 foreigners, and one of only 3 Americans not of Indian origin, to have received the award. In his later years in Congress, Gilman was a vociferous and frequent critic of President Bill Clinton, particularly on matters related to American foreign policy. Congressman Gilman helped gain passage of the International Academic Opportunity Act of 2000, establishing exchange programs for American students to study abroad. Named after Gilman is the Benjamin A. Gilman International Scholarship, a program for Pell Grant eligible American college students to study or intern abroad administered by the United States Department of State. Congressman Gilman retired from Congress in 2003 after New York's 20th congressional district, which he had represented, was broken up and dispersed among the 17th, 18th, 19th and 22nd Congressional Districts in the redistricting that followed the 2000 census and reapportionment. At the time of his retirement, Gilman was the oldest sitting representative in the U.S. House (in all of Congress, only Senators Strom Thurmond and Robert Byrd were older). He was the senior Republican representing New York, and the second-most senior Member from New York overall behind only Charles B. Rangel. In 2003, following his retirement from Congress, the Dalai Lama bestowed upon Congressman Gilman the International Campaign for Tibet's Light of Truth Award. On March 28, 2008, Gilman participated in the ribbon cutting ceremony for the Gilman Center for International Education in his hometown of Middletown, New York, on the campus of SUNY Orange, also known as Orange County Community College. This modern new facility for international studies is expected to attract students from throughout the world, and houses Gilman's public papers from throughout his 36 years in elective office. Various photographs and memorabilia from throughout his career are on display. On Jun 14, 2011, Gilman was awarded the Top Honor Prize, and recognized by the World Peace Prize Awarding Council for being a lifelong champion of human rights: fighting world hunger, narcotic abuse and trafficking. Personal life Gilman was married three times: to the former Jane Prizant (1927‚Äì2000), a lawyer and daughter of a well-known actor of the Yiddish theater (Hyman Prizant), to Rita Kelhofer, and to Georgia Tingus. His children (from the first marriage) were Jonathan Gilman, Susan Gilman-Harts, Harrison Gilman, David Gilman (deceased) and Ellen Gilman (deceased). Subsequent to his retirement, he continued to live in Middletown, his home in the Hudson Valley district that he represented. Death Gilman died on December 17, 2016, at the Castle Point Veteran's Hospital in Fishkill (town), New York from surgical complications, eleven days after his 94th birthday. He was survived by his third wife, Georgia, by three of his five children: sons Jonathan and Harrison, and daughter Susan. He is also survived by a stepdaughter, Nicole Pappas, and a stepson, Peter Tingus. He was survived by eleven grandchildren. A daughter, Ellen, and a son, David, both predeceased him.

The list includes the name, the number field for each, and the frequency of drawings. All pick-5 games in the U.S. and Canada are drawn multiple times per week (usually nightly, including Sundays and holidays); some lotteries now hold such drawings more than once a day. Most U.S. pick-5 games now have a progressive jackpot, even in games that are drawn daily; in unusual cases, a single ticket has won a cash prize in excess of $1 million cash. A common top prize in non-jackpot pick-5 games is $100,000. (In the lists below, games with a jackpot do not have a minimum jackpot listed.) Depending on the game, a minimum of either two or three numbers (not counting a \\"bonus ball\\") must be matched for a winning ticket. (A 2/5 match usually results in a free play for that game, or a \\"break-even\\" win; for the latter, the player wins back their stake on that particular five-number wager.) Prize payouts depending on the game are either fixed (with parimutuel exceptions), are always parimutuel, or feature a parimutuel jackpot with fixed lower-tier prizes. With very few exceptions, all U.S. and Canadian games where five regular numbers are drawn from the same pool have had a lump sum jackpot/grand prize, hence the word Cash is used as part of the name of several such games. Except where noted, all current pick-5 games listed here cost $1 per play. Some pick-5 games have introduced an add-on wager, usually $1, either as an \\"instant match\\" feature, or, as in the additional 50-cent Connecticut Cash 5 wager Kicker, to give a player additional prize levels. An increasingly popular style of pick-5 game is based on Caribbean stud poker; such games combine a \\"traditional\\" drawing with an instant-win feature. The lists do not include \\"4+1\\" games, such as Florida's Lucky Money, where all five numbers must be matched to win the top prize, but are drawn from two number fields. (A similar game, Montana's \\"Big Sky Bonus\\", is actually a \\"four-number\\" game; the double matrix is 4/28 + 1/17. Matching all four \\"regular\\" numbers wins the jackpot; matching the \\"bonus\\" ball wins $10 plus any money won for matching at least two of the four \\"regular\\" numbers.) DC-5, Florida's Pick 5, Georgia Five, Ohio's Pick 5, and Pennsylvania's Pick 5 also do not truly fit this category, as they are five- digit numbers games with \\"straight\\" and \\"box\\" wagers played like many U.S. pick-3 and pick-4 games.

The Arizona woodpecker (L. arizonae) was formerly considered the northern subspecies of this bird until the 42nd supplement of the American Ornithologists Union checklist, which officially split them into two separate species. Taxonomy Strickland's woodpecker was first described by the French ornithologist Alfred Malherbe in 1845 and given its current name which commemorates the British scientist Hugh Edwin Strickland. Some taxonomic authorities, including the American Ornithological Society, continue to place this species in the genus Picoides. Habitat A quiet and shy bird, Strickland's woodpeckers are fairly common in their limited range, usually found in pine forests and mixed pine-oak slopes at heights of about 4,500 to 7,000 feet. The Strickland's woodpecker's range generally follows a thin east‚Äìwest band in central Mexico from Michoac√°n to Veracruz. Description Strickland's woodpeckers grow to be about 7 to 8 inches in length, and are mainly brown and white in color. They are brown on top with a dark rump and have white underparts speckled with many brown spots. Strickland's woodpeckers usually have three white bars on their wings, and have two white stripes across their face which join with another white bar on their neck. Male Strickland's woodpeckers also have a red patch on the nape of their head which is lacking on females. The nest of this species is in a cavity excavated from a dead tree trunk. The female lays three to four white eggs on a bed of wood chips, but other details of nesting periods and duration are mostly unknown. References External links *Strickland's woodpecker at AviBase.

Perry's record was surpassed a few days later, in March 2002, when another soldier in his unit, Corporal Rob Furlong, bested Perry's distance with a kill at a verified range of . Perry was a member of Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry at the time of the record shot, but began his military career with a Halifax Militia unit, the Princess Louise Fusiliers. Canadian sniper team Perry was a member of a Canadian Forces- led six-man sniper team, operating as part of Canada's contributions to Operation Anaconda in Afghanistan during March 2002. The Canadian sniper cell consisted of two Sniper Detachments of three men each, with soldiers from the Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry (PPCLI). Team Commander was Master Corporal Graham Ragsdale, joined by PPCLI soldiers Master Corporal Arron Perry (second in command), Master Corporal Tim McMeekin, Corporal Dennis Eason, Corporal Rob Furlong, and Corporal Marty, working with United States Army liaison Sergeant Zevon Durham. The six worked in two teams of three snipers, built around two, .50-caliber, McMillan Brothers TAC-50 rifles (designated as the C15 long-range sniper weapon by the Canadian Forces). The lead shooters were Perry, for Alpha Detachment, and Furlong, for Bravo Detachment. Ragsdale and Eason worked predominately as spotter and guard for Alpha, while McMeekin and Marty served those roles for Bravo‚Äîthough details of how many sniper shots the rest of the team may also have taken have not been released. The Canadian team received praise from United States Army colleagues for its extreme long range shots and for killing a significant number of Taliban and al-Qaeda combatants. When the operation ended, each of the Canadians were recommended for the United States Bronze Star Medal, which they received in December 2003 from Paul Cellucci, the American ambassador to Canada. Controversy A McMillan Tac-50 rifle like Master Corporal Arron Perry used to kill an enemy combatant from 2,310 m (2,526 yd). In 2002, Perry was accused of discreditable conduct by the Canadian Armed Forces. Forces personnel investigated allegations that he had desecrated a combatant's corpse by removing a finger, putting a cigarette in its mouth, and placing a sign reading \\"Fuck Terrorism\\" on its chest. Military police also suspected that Perry had defecated on another corpse. Ten months later the investigation was closed for lack of evidence, allowing the Bronze Star presentation ceremony to proceed for the entire team. In April 2005, Perry left the Canadian military.

A lumber mill was built, which provided wood for Myrtle Beach's first buildings and structures, including the Seaside Inn, Myrtle Beach's first hotel.

The legion was formed in September 1941 as the 1st Usta≈°a Regiment. It consisted largely of Bosnian and Croatian refugees from eastern Bosnia, where large massacres were carried out by Chetniks and to a small degree by the Yugoslav Partisans. It became known for its fierce fighting against the Chetniks and the Partisans and massacres against Serb civilians. The legion's commanders were Colonel Jure Francetiƒá and Major Rafael Boban and it consisted of between 1,000 and 1,500 trained mechanized infantrymen. History The Black Legion was formed in Sarajevo in April 1941 with 12 founding members of which 11 were Croat and one was a Bosnian Muslim. The force grew to be predominantly Muslim in response to the atrocities carried out against Bosnian Muslims.Hoare (2006), p. 165 Its first official name was Sarajevo Usta≈°e Camp. The unit was formed by pre-war Usta≈°e members, Jozo Zubiƒá, Drago Jilek and Beƒáir Lokmiƒá. The unit commander was Lokmiƒá, an Usta≈°e member stationed in Sarajevo before the war. The unit's first task was guarding of state buildings in Sarajevo. Its first armed conflict occurred on the railway in Pale, Sarajevo, against Chetniks who wanted to take over the water supply. Soon, they entered conflict with Chetniks on the wider area of Sarajevo, under mountains Igman, Trebeviƒá and Romanija. After the battle of Kupres, the Legion's 1st and 2nd battalion were used to form the cadre for the newly formed 5th Standing Active Brigade which was put under the command of Rafael Boban and incorporated into the 5th division of the Croatian Armed Forces in December 1944.Tomasevich (2001), p. 422 In August 1942 Francetiƒá was appointed the supreme commander of all standing active brigades of the Usta≈°e Army and the Legion's new commander became Colonel Ivo Stipkoviƒá. Under Stipkoviƒá's command the Legion lost even more men when the 23rd and 28th battalions (composed mainly of Bosnian Muslims) were disbanded and their soldiers transferred to the 13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Handschar. After the death of Colonel Stipkoviƒá in September 1943 the Legion's commander became Major Milan ≈†ulentiƒá but just eight days later he was replaced by Major Franjo Sudar. Near the end of 1944 the Legion was incorporated into the 1st division of the Croatian Armed Forces under the command of General Roman Domanik. Soldiers of the Black Legion continued to wear the black uniform right up to the end of the war, probably as a sort of honorary mark of distinction. Lastly, at least 120 former Black Legion men were executed by the Partisans at Sisak in May 1945. When the war ended, many soldiers of the Black Legion refused to surrender and joined the Crusaders.

He won the Bulgarian national chess championship in 1963, the year he was awarded the Grandmaster title, only the second Bulgarian player thus honored (after Milko Bobotsov). He was active mainly during the 1960s and 1970s and qualified for the 1964 Interzonal stage of the process for selecting a challenger for the World Chess Championship, but finished fifteenth in the Interzonal held in Amsterdam, so did not advance to the Candidates matches held in 1965. Tringov had numerous successes in international tournaments to his credit, including first place at Vrsac 1973. Tringov placed fifth in the 1955 World Junior Championship. He played for Bulgaria in five World Student Team Championships (1957 through 1960), winning the individual gold in three consecutive competitions: on board four in 1957 and 1958 and on board two in 1959 with a 92.3% score (+11=2‚àí0). The Bulgarian student team was also successful those years, taking the team silver medal in 1957 and 1958 and the gold in 1959. Tringov was a regular member of the Bulgarian team in the Chess Olympiads, playing in 12 Olympiads (every contest from 1956 to 1982 except 1960 and 1976). In 1968 and in 1978 he had his best Olympiad results, twice winning the individual gold medal with a score of 78.6% (+8=6-0) on board two and ten years later with 77.3% (+6=5‚àí0) on board three respectively.Tringov, Georgi team chess records at Olimpbase.org A controversy involving Tringov took place at the 20th Chess Olympiad in 1972. In the fourth round of Final Group A, the Bulgarian and Soviet Union teams met. A game between Tringov and Viktor Korchnoi was adjourned after 41 moves with Tringov to seal his next move. At this Olympiad, sealed moves were written on a separate piece of paper, not the player's score sheet. Tringov rejected this way of sealing his move and instead wrote it on his score sheet. When the game was resumed, the arbiter opened the envelope. In the envelope was Korchnoi's score sheet but not the one belonging to Tringov. The arbiter ruled the game a forfeit win for Korchnoi. Oleg Neikirch, who was serving as Bulgarian team captain, instituted protest proceedings but an arbitration committee upheld the arbiter's ruling. After the Olympiad was over, it was learned that Tringov had accidentally placed his score sheet in his pocket.

A language border or language boundary is the line separating two language areas. The term is generally meant to imply a lack of mutual intelligibility between the two languages. If two adjacent languages or dialects are mutually intelligible, no firm border will develop, because the two languages can continually exchange linguistic inventions; this is known as a dialect continuum. A \\"language island\\" is a language area that is completely surrounded by a language border. Important concepts The concept of mutual intelligibility is vague. More important, it can be difficult for non-native speakers to distinguish one language from one another similar one. Furthermore, there is no clear definition of what constitutes a language: for instance some languages share writing systems but are spoken differently, while others are identical when spoken but are written using different alphabets. For example, different \\"dialects\\" of Chinese use the same characters with the same meanings, but these can be pronounced very differently in different varieties. Japanese also uses large numbers of Kanji characters (of Chinese origin) to mean the same as in Chinese, but they often have different \\"readings\\" (yomi) some of which may be pronounced as in Chinese while others are totally different. There are often also shared terms between two languages even between languages that have nothing to do with each other.Urciuoli, Bonnie. \\"Language and Borders.\\" Annual Review of Anthropology, Vol. 24, (1995), pp. 525‚Äì546. This article discusses the role of language and nationalistic identity and its role near the border. It explores whether or not people tend to make a connection between nationalism and language. For example, Spanish is spoken in most Central American and South American countries, but also in Spain. There are subtle but recognizable differences between the dialects, but there are different dialects even within the country of Spain. (In many cultures there also slight differences between the versions of the language, both spoken and written (\\"registers\\") used in different contexts: for example when talking to one's boss and talking to one's friends.)Eastman, Carol M. Codeswitching. Multilingual Matters Ltd., 1992. Discusses the implications of codeswitching and its acceptability based upon where the utterance occurs. Indicates the mixture of languages and borrowing of words throughout any area. Explores the differences between codeswitching and borrowing, and the views that speakers have on these two phenomena. Difficulties R√∂stigraben in Switzerland There can also be people within a country who speak the \\"native\\" language of a different country, some of whom may be bilingual. Also, an inherited language may evolve and perhaps absorb some of the characteristics or terms of the new area's predominant language. In cases such as these, it becomes even more difficult to identify specific languages. When speakers have a foreign accent, they are often perceived to be less intelligent and are less likely to be hired.Hidalgo, Margarita. \\"Language Contact, Language Loyalty, and Language Prejudice on the Mexican Border.\\" Language in Society, Vol. 15, No. 2 (June 1986), pp. 193‚Äì220. This article is about the role of language and code-switching in Juarez, Mexico. It researches the impact of English versus Spanish and their roles in society, including the social ramifications of language usage and the prevalence of codeswitching. It includes interviews of many Juarez residents concerning their feelings toward the use of English and Spanish. It is the same with an accent from a peripheral area, rather than the accent from the urbanized core: a peripheral person is typically perceived as speaking a \\"less correct\\" by those who are more educated,Woolard, Kathryn A. and Bambi B. Schieffelin. \\"Language Ideology.\\" Annual Review of Anthropology, Vol. 23, (1994), pp. 55‚Äì82. This article explores the role of language in ideological and political identity. It researches the ways in which dialects and grammar can affect perceptions in society. It investigates the implications of using a particular type of communication in a certain setting. while those who are not as educated do not perceive any difference in the \\"correctness\\". Colonial histories could also help this phenomenon. A well-known example of a language border is the border between Romance and Germanic languages that stretches through Belgium, France, Switzerland, and Italy. Politics and language borders =European expansion= Language borders do not always reflect political borders; the tendency to correlate language with nationality is a common error that seems to have arisen during the period of 19th century European expansion (e.g., the term Anglo in Mexico and the southeastern U.S., or the term Angrez ‚Äì literally, \\"English\\" ‚Äì in North India). The usage of a particular language can reflect positively or negatively on its speaker depending upon the situation. For example, there is perception in the USA that only English speakers are American and only non-Americans are non-English-speakers. It is suspected that this assumption began because states would have \\"official\\" languages for the purposes of book publishing and therefore for the purposes of education, so intelligence would come to be associated with speaking the language that was written. Because of this idea, there are also often social benefits which result from being able to speak English. A prime example of this is the prevalence of bilingualism near the U.S.‚ÄìMexican border, which also indicates the porosity of the border and illustrates the difficulty of drawing a \\"border\\" around all speakers of a given language, especially because there is not usually much correlation between ethnicity and language. Such common bilingualism leads to the practice of code-switching, or the changing freely between languages while speaking although this trait is somewhat looked down upon because those living in areas of frequent code-switching seem to develop a sort of language loyalty. =Colonialism= Another example of the difference between language borders and political borders is the spread of languages via colonialism, causing languages to be spoken in multiple, not necessarily adjacent countries. =Other examples= Although language borders and political borders do not always agree, there have been many instances where political leadership has attempted to enforce language borders. In the Mexican city of Ciudad Juarez on the border with the United States, social efforts have been made to curb the amount of American influence taking place‚Äîbut at the same time, as in other foreign cultures, the class benefits of English proficiency are acknowledged and to this end schools teach in English and many television channels are in English. The use of Breton and Welsh has historically been discouraged by French and British governments respectively. There are also instances of intolerance to the speaking of Native American languages at some schools, thus forcing those students to create small communities in which they can speak their native language, thereby creating \\"language boundaries\\" on a very small scale. Examples like these illustrate the impact that language boundaries can have on cultural boundaries, even if they are not necessarily one and the same.

Prior to his appointment as Commissioner of the IRS, Everson held a number of federal government positions in the administrations of George W. Bush and Ronald Reagan, as well as at the state level within the administration of Indiana Governor Mitch Daniels. In August 2009, Everson joined alliantgroup, LP, a national tax advisory consultant, to advise the firm and its clients on matters related to the IRS and on strategic, operational, and client service initiatives. Everson was a candidate for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016, until he withdrew his candidacy on November 5, 2015. Education Everson received his Bachelor of Arts degree in history from Yale University and Master of Science degree in accounting from New York University's Stern School of Business. Public service and business experience Everson served in the Reagan administration from 1982 until 1988 holding several positions at the United States Information Agency and the Department of Justice, where he was deputy commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service. While at INS, he oversaw implementation of the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, landmark legislation providing for sanctions against employers hiring undocumented immigrants and granting amnesty to qualifying undocumented immigrants. Prior to joining the Bush administration in August 2001, he was group vice president of finance at SC International Services, Inc., at the time a $2 billion privately owned, Dallas-based, food services company with leading market positions in both airline catering and home meals. From 1988 until 1998, he was an executive with the Pechiney Group, one of France's largest industrial groups. While with Pechiney, he held various financial and operating positions in the United States, France and Turkey. From August 1, 2002 until his IRS confirmation, Everson served as deputy director for management for the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). He chaired the President's Management Council, which is composed of cabinet department and major agency chief operating officers. The council is charged with improving overall executive branch management, including implementation of the President's Management Agenda. Before becoming deputy director for management, he served as controller of the Office of Federal Financial Management, also a part of OMB. Everson was appointed by President George W. Bush to a five-year term as Commissioner of Internal Revenue, the head of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and was confirmed by the U.S. Senate on May 1, 2003 as its 46th commissioner. Areas of focus during his tenure with the IRS included combating abusive tax shelters and the development of more productive enforcement relationships with counterpart tax authorities in other countries. Everson left the IRS effective May 4, 2007, before the end of his term to join the American Red Cross as its new CEO. Later, Everson was a cabinet member for Indiana Governor Mitch Daniels from January 2009 to May 2012, where he served initially as Department of Administration Commissioner. From 2010‚Äì2012, Everson served as the Commissioner of the Department of Workforce Development, where he oversaw the state's unemployment system and federal training programs. In this role, Everson began a program that was endorsed by the Indiana Chamber of Commerce and the Indiana Manufacturers Association that helped qualifying ex-offenders realize employment opportunities. =American Red Cross= On April 18, 2007, the Board of Governors of the American Red Cross unanimously approved Everson as President and Chief Executive Officer of the American Red Cross, effective May 29, 2007. On November 27, 2007, the Board of Governors, after learning that Everson engaged in a personal relationship with a subordinate employee, asked for and received Everson's resignation. The New York Post reported that the \\"personal relationship\\" was with a married woman, Paige Roberts, CEO of the Southeast Mississippi Red Cross chapter. 2016 presidential campaign Mark Everson's campaign logo On March 5, 2015, Everson announced his intention to seek the Republican Party's nomination for President of the United States in the 2016 Presidential election. He launched his bid with a video and 16-page open letter, in which he laid out six primary issues: On September 11, 2015, the Des Moines Register published an op-ed entitled \\"Iowans should learn Everson's name, ideas\\", praising him as a candidate \\"insider enough to understand the messy business of political compromise, and outsider enough, in his words, not to 'owe any backers.'\\" Everson was the first declared candidate to open an office in Iowa, and logged more visits to the state than seven major candidates. He was one of the 18 candidates listed on the Republican National Committee's straw poll, and he outperformed some of the GOP's front-runners in non-scientific straw polls. However, he was not listed in the Iowa Poll sponsored by Register and Bloomberg Politics and was not invited to the televised debates. After being informed that he would not be allowed to participate in a scheduled Fox News debate in Cleveland on August 6, 2015, Everson filed a formal complaint with the Federal Election Commission, arguing that Fox News had violated election laws by failing to adhere to consistent criteria in determining which candidates would make the debate stage. Fox News originally stated that candidates must be polling at 1 percent in an average of five national polls to participate, but did away with the standard a week before the scheduled debate. On August 7, 2015, the Cleveland Plain Dealer ran an op-ed arguing that Everson should have been included in the 5 p.m. debate. While on the campaign trail, Everson was one of the earliest critics of eventual Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. After Trump's presidential announcement, Everson called for Trump to drop out of the race; he asserted that comments made by Trump about Mexican immigrants \\"'divide at a time when we need to unite and reinforce our proud tradition of assimilation'\\".https://www.nwitimes.com/news/local/govt-and- politics/elections/gop-presidential-candidate-demands-trump-quit- race/article_81e37ee3-3690-5f86-91ba-54a19e849270.html Everson put almost $400,000 of his own money into the campaign and raised approximately $100,000. On November 5, 2015, Everson withdrew from the race, citing lack of funds, non-inclusion in debates, and scarce media attention as factors in his decision. In June 2016, before the Republican convention, Everson stated that he could neither \\"get on board\\" with Trump nor \\"look the other way.\\" He condemned the candidate's policy proposals as \\"reckless, be they stripping trillions in revenues from the Treasury ... or countenancing nuclear proliferation to name two of the worst.\\" Everson wrote that \\"the deplorable demeanor he has deliberately cultivated over decades\\" disqualifies Trump from public service and that \\"his campaign is more than divisive; particularly for our young it is destructive and even frightening.\\" Further reading * Crenshaw, Albert B. \\"IRS to Tell Taxpayers Of Frozen Refunds\\", Washingtonpost.com.

According to his own claims, in September 1939, a British occultist named Gerald Gardner was initiated into the coven and subsequently used its beliefs and practices as a basis from which he formed the tradition of Gardnerian Wicca. Gardner described some of his experiences with the coven in his published books Witchcraft Today (1954) and The Meaning of Witchcraft (1959) although on the whole revealed little about it, saying he was respecting the privacy of its members. Meanwhile, another occultist, Louis Wilkinson, corroborated Gardner's claims by revealing in an interview with the writer Francis X. King that he too had encountered the coven and expanded on some of the information that Gardner had provided about them.King 1970. According to Gardner, the faith which they followed was the continuation of the Witch-Cult, a pre-Christian religion that originated in the paganism of ancient Western Europe. This was in keeping with the widely held theories then propagated by the anthropologist Margaret Murray and her supporters. As Wicca developed in the latter decades of the twentieth century, some of the figures who were researching its origins, such as Aidan KellyKelly 1991. and later Leo Ruickbie,Ruickbie 2004. came to the conclusion that the New Forest coven was simply a fictional invention of Gardner's to provide a historical basis for his faith. The historian Ronald Hutton accepted this as a possibility, although recognised that it was not \\"implausible\\" that the coven had indeed existed.Hutton 1999. p 207. Later research by Philip Heselton which was published in the early twenty-first century, indicated that there was much evidence for a coven of practitioners - whose members he identified as being Dorothy Clutterbuck, Edith Woodford-Grimes, Ernest Mason, Susie Mason, Rosamund Sabine and Katherine Oldmeadow.Heselton 2003. History =Origins= Gerald Gardner believed that the New Forest coven was a survival of the Witch-Cult, a pre- Christian pagan religion that worshipped a Horned God and a Triple Goddess and which had been persecuted during the witch trials of the Early Modern period. The existence of the Witch-Cult had been put forward by various writers in the nineteenth century, such as Jules Michelet and Charles Leland, but had risen to prominence in the early twentieth century when it was promoted in two of the works of Egyptologist Dr Margaret Murray: The Witch-Cult in Western Europe (1921) and The God of the Witches (1933). The idea of the pagan Witch-Cult has been disproved and dismissed by historians specialising in the Early Modern witch trials since Murray's death in 1963, with works by academics like Elliot Rose, Norman Cohn, Carlo Ginzburg and Keith Thomas instead showing the real nature of the witch trials as a combination of social, economic and religious factors. It is for this reason that the historian Ronald Hutton (1999) dismissed any possibility of the New Forest coven being the continuation of the Witch-Cult.Hutton 1999. p. 207. Instead, it has been proposed that the New Forest coven had been founded in the early twentieth century by various occultists who wished to resurrect the Witch-Cult as described in Murray's works. Philip Heselton (2003), who performed the most exhaustive research into the group, speculated that the coven had been formed by a woman named Rosamund Sabine, who prior to moving to the New Forest in 1924 had been involved in various esoteric groups like the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. He thought that she, after reading The Witch-Cult in Western Europe, became interested in witches, and believed herself to be the reincarnation of one. It was for this reason, he believed, that she gathered together some of her friends who also had an interest in the occult, and founded the coven.Heselton 2003. p. 385. However, researcher Vikki Bramshaw suggests that Gardner may well have had some, albeit brief, meeting with local traditions in operation at that time. She writes that whilst a number of the members were from masonic or academic backgrounds of high society, others were working class people outside of those class-bound organisations. They included blacksmiths, manual labourers, and some with gypsy connections in the Forest. Davis Stanton writes, 'In other words, Wicca was only 'new' in the sense the New Forest was new - a re- designation of something that was there before, under another name.' A different origin theory was put forward by Steve Wilson (1996), who speculated that the coven might have been founded by members of a scouting organisation, the Order of Woodcraft Chivalry.Wilson 1996. Heselton accepted similarities between the Order and the coven, but did not believe that there was any direct connection.Heselton 2000. pp. 298‚Äì299. =Gerald Gardner's Involvement= A ritual scourge owned by the New Forest coven which Gardner subsequently inherited. Gerald Gardner claimed that after moving to the borough of Christchurch, Dorset in 1939, he got involved with the Rosicrucian Order Crotona Fellowship, an occult organisation based upon Rosicrucianism. However, he was largely dissatisfied with the Order, and in particular its leader, George Alexander Sullivan, believing them to be devoid of any genuine esoteric knowledge. Meanwhile, he met a group of people within the Fellowship who claimed to have been involved in a form of Freemasonry known as Co-Masonry, who informed him that they had moved to the area where they had joined the Rosicrucian Order when their friend and fellow Co-Mason, Mabel Besant-Scott, had done so.Bracelin 1960. pp. 164‚Äì166. The researcher Philip Heselton identified two of these individuals as Ernest and Susie Mason, a brother and sister couple who had in prior decades been involved in a variety of occult groups, including Co-Masonry and Theosophy, and who had recently moved to the area from Southampton.Heselton 2000. pp. 100‚Äì112. According to Gardner: :They seemed rather brow-beaten by the others, kept themselves to themselves. They were the most interesting element, however. Unlike many of the others, they had to earn their livings, were cheerful and optimistic and had a real interest in the occult.Bracelin 1960. p. 164. This group claimed to have known Gardner from a past life, and in September 1939, revealed to him that they were members of a Witches' coven, and then initiated him into Wicca in a ritual which took place in one of the homes owned by Dorothy Clutterbuck.Bracelin 1960. pp. 164‚Äì165. = Operation Cone of Power = Gardner would reveal little about the coven and its members, although claimed that in August 1940, during the midst of the Second World War, they performed a ritual known as Operation Cone of Power which they hoped would influence the High Command of Nazi Germany and prevent them from invading Britain. This magical ritual, Gardner claimed, took place inside the Forest, and involved the Witches raising a Cone of Power which they directed toward Germany and focused on sending the message into the minds of the German leaders that they would not be able to cross the English Channel.Bracelin 1960. pp. 166‚Äì167. Gardner also noted that several of the older and frailer practicing Witches died after practicing the ritual, something that was confirmed by Louis Wilkinson, who claimed that it was because they had performed the ritual naked, without goose grease on the skin to keep them warm, and that as such they had contracted pneumonia. Investigating these claims, Heselton found two locals who died soon after the ritual: a reporter, Walter Forder (1881‚Äì1940), and a blacksmith, Charles Loader (1864‚Äì1940), whom he speculated were involved in the rite.Heselton 2000. pp. 244‚Äì250.  Coven members  According to Gardner, his first contact with the witches was through an inner group within the Crotona Fellowship, a Rosicrucian society that operated a theatre in Christchurch. They were a reserved group, who remained somewhat separate from other members of the order and the theatre. Historian Philip Heselton has identified some of the members of this group as Edith Woodford-Grimes, Ernie Mason, and his sisters Susie Mason and Rosetta Fudge.Heselton 2000. It is possible that by the late 1930s some members of the Crotona Fellowship, inspired by the work of Margaret Murray, were performing rituals based on Co- Masonry and incorporating elements of folklore, and that these were the rituals that Gardner encountered.Magliocco 2004. =The Mason family= The Mason family, researched by Heselton, lived in Southampton for a period of over 150 years. One of Heselton's informants described Ernie in particular and the family in general, as 'witches', adding that Ernie, who he had known for several years, had had to give up because he found the rituals too strenuous. Rosetta was a keen follower of Anthroposophy; Susie was a Co-Freemason and Theosophist, and Ernie, who claimed to have been fully aware from the moment of his birth, was an enthusiastic esotericist and taught mental exercises in the Crotona Fellowship. Their father George Miles Mason, an optician and astronomer, had built a meeting hall in Southampton which seems to have been used for the meetings of various esoteric groups, including Co-Freemasonry. Heselton points to a reference to nearby Toothill as a \\"witch centre\\" in a book by Justine Glass,Glass 1965. who does not name her informant. In the 1881 census nearly a quarter of the inhabitants of that hamlet (three families) had the surname Mason (an otherwise uncommon name in that part of England); based on this and other circumstantial evidence he proposes that the Mason family could have been the custodians of a hereditary witchcraft tradition. =Edith Woodford-Grimes= The priestess who initiated Gardner into witchcraft was referred to as \\"Dafo\\" or \\"Daffo\\".Johns 1969. She taught music and elocution, and her daughter married a dentist;Valiente 1989. these and other details identify her as Edith Rose Woodford-Grimes. She lived in the same street as the Mason family between 1922 and 1937, when they were heavily involved in esoteric activities. By 1938 she was living in Christchurch near the Rosicrucian theatre, and was an active member. In August 1940, at her daughter's wedding, the bride was given away by Gerald Gardner, who was described as a \\"close friend\\". Edith remained a close friend of Gardner's for the rest of his life.

The species northernmost range in southeastern Arizona, extreme southwestern New Mexico, and northern Sonora is the region of the Madrean Sky Islands, a region of higher Sonoran Desert mountain ranges. This species is known in older field guides as a subspecies of Strickland's woodpecker. The 42nd supplement of the American Ornithologists Union checklist officially split Strickland's woodpecker into two species: the northern population in the Sierra Madre Occidental region (Arizona, L. arizonae) and the southern population in central Mexico (Strickland's, L. stricklandi). Some taxonomic authorities, including the American Ornithological Society, continue to place this species in the genus Picoides. Description Female Arizona woodpeckers are nearly identical to Strickland's woodpeckers, growing to be about 7 to 8 inches in length. Their plumage is mainly brown and white in coloration, brown on top with a dark rump with white underparts speckled with brown spots. Arizona woodpeckers usually have white bars on their wings, and have two white stripes across their face which join with another white bar on their neck. Male Arizona woodpeckers also have a red patch on the nape of their head which is lacking on females. The call of the Arizona woodpecker is a sharp, squeaky keech, and this species also gives a rattle call of descending, grating notes. References * * Sibley, David Allen.

L. Davis, was an American novelist and poet. A native of Oregon, he won the Pulitzer Prize for his novel Honey in the Horn, the only Pulitzer given to a native Oregonian. Later living in California and Texas, he also wrote short stories for magazines such as The Saturday Evening Post. Early life Davis was born in Nonpareil, Douglas County, Oregon, in the Umpqua River Valley, and lived in Roseburg in his early years. His father was a teacher and the family moved frequently as he took up different teaching positions. They moved to Antelope, Oregon in 1906, and two years later they were in The Dalles, where his father was now a principal. In 1912 Davis graduated from high school there. He held various short-term jobs, with the county, with Pacific Power and Light, and in a local bank. He also worked as a railroad timekeeper and with a survey party near Mount Adams. Writing career His first poems were published in April 1919 in Poetry, edited by Harriet Monroe. These were eleven poems published together under the title Primapara. Later that year they won the magazine's Levinson Prize, worth $200. Davis also received a letter of praise from poet Carl Sandburg. Davis continued to publish poems in the magazine throughout the 1920s, and also sold some poems to H. L. Mencken's The American Mercury. Mencken encouraged him to begin writing prose. In 1926, Davis and James Stevens privately published a small booklet, Status Rerum: A Manifesto Upon the Present Condition of Northwest Literature. Although only a few copies were printed, the booklet attracted notice because of its bluntness and invective against the local literary scene of Portland. Robinson Jeffers memorably described the pamphlet as a \\"rather grimly powerful wheel to break butterflies on.\\"Quoted in H.L. Davis, Collected Essays and Short Stories (Moscow, Idaho: University of Idaho Press, n.d.), p. 330 Together with his new wife, the former Marion Lay of The Dalles, Davis moved to Seattle in August 1928. There he increased his literary efforts. His first published prose began appearing in The American Mercury in 1929. These were picturesque but hardly complimentary sketches of The Dalles and Eastern Oregon. One of the first was entitled \\"A Town in Eastern Oregon\\", a historical sketch of The Dalles. It caused quite a controversy in the region for its irreverence. In 1932, Davis was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship. The award allowed him to move to Jalisco, Mexico, where he lived for two years, concentrating on his writing. There he completed the novel Honey in the Horn, about southern Oregon pioneer life. It is a coming-of-age tale set in the early twentieth century. This novel received the Harper Prize for best first novel of 1935, together with a $7,500 cash award. It was well reviewed by writers such as Robert Penn Warren, although New Yorker critic Clifton Fadiman did not like it. The following spring the book won the Pulitzer Prize, and is the only Pulitzer Prize ever awarded to an Oregon born author. Davis did not go to New York to receive the Pulitzer in person, saying he did not want to put himself on exhibit. The Davises bought a small ranch near Napa, California currently owned by Aaron and Claire Pott and is the estate vineyard known as Ch√¢teauneuf du Pott. There Davis wrote short stories as his primary source of income, publishing them in such magazines as Collier's and The Saturday Evening Post. He continued to work on novels. His second novel, Harp of a Thousand Strings, appeared in 1941. The long interval from his Pulitzer-winning first novel meant that his second did not receive the notice it would have earlier. In fact, although Davis continued to improve as a writer, none of his later efforts received the attention of Honey in the Horn. Davis was also undergoing crises in his life. He was divorced in 1943. He also changed publishers, from Harper & Brothers to William Morrow & Company, apparently because of a long-running dispute over royalty payments. Later life Over the next ten years, he published three more novels and a collection of earlier short stories. His fourth novel, Winds of Morning, was well received and became a Book of the Month Club selection. In 1953 he remarried, to Elizabeth Martin del Campo. As a result of arteriosclerosis, his left leg was amputated. He suffered chronic pain, but continued to write. In 1960 he died of a heart attack in San Antonio, Texas. Evaluation Although often considered a regional novelist, Davis rejected that evaluation. He undoubtedly used regional themes, but contended that he did so in the service of the universal. Influences on his work can be found in a wide range of American and European literature. His prose is considered wry, ironic, and cryptic. His stories are realistic, without the romantic stereotypes expected of \\"western\\" fiction. The landscape is a major component of his novels. Works *Honey in the Horn.

Principal writers included Gerry Conway, Steve Englehart, Louise Simonson, Chris Claremont, and Steve Gerber. The storyline was the first of its kind. While there had been previous extended crossovers over multiple titles before it, \\"The Evolutionary War\\" was the first to take place exclusively in annuals. This format of crossover annuals was to be repeated by Marvel for the next four years, most notably with 1989's \\"Atlantis Attacks.\\" Background One of the world's premiere geneticists, the High Evolutionary had devoted his life to unlocking the mysteries of life and creating new forms of intelligent beings for his research. His crowning achievement was the creation of Counter-Earth; however, this was viewed as little more than a trivial matter by the Beyonders, who captured the planet for display in a cosmic museum of curiosities. Realizing that his own aspirations to godhood were dwarfed by the Beyonders, the Evolutionary succumbed to madness and depression. He goaded the Hulk into damaging the defense mechanisms in his armor, so that he could commit suicide. Plot The High Evolutionary is revealed to have survived his suicide attempt, and has rededicated himself to guiding and enhancing the evolution of humanity so that his race may one day be supreme to all others, including the Beyonders. To this end he initiates several concurrent efforts to accelerate human evolution and eliminate perceived threats to mankind's genetic purity. He sends his Purifier troops into Subterranea to sterilize the simple-minded races that dwell there. However, the discovery of a mutant Moloid attracts the intervention of X-Factor and Apocalypse. Apocalypse and The High Evolutionary engage in an epic battle in outer space. The Evolutionary is ultimately convinced that the Subterraneans indeed have genetic potential and ceases his operations there. In Bogot√°, the Evolutionary's Eliminators are dispatched to exterminate a drug cartel. The Punisher discovers the battle and dispatches with both sides. Meanwhile, the High Evolutionary visits the Eternals and persuades them aid his cause by mapping the genetic code of the Silver Surfer. The Surfer refuses to cooperate, and convinces the Eternals to let him be. The Purifiers set about removing the powers of mutants deemed to pose a threat to humanity. When they capture Magma from Nova Roma, the inner circle of the Hellfire Club and the New Mutants storm the Purifier base in Wyoming to rescue her. During the struggle, Mirage inadvertently has her powers enhanced, allowing her to physically manifest the illusions she casts. With the supply of drugs cut off by events in Bogot√°, a drug war escalates in New York City, made worse by the Purifiers murdering drug dealers. Seeking to retaliate against the ones who disrupted his drug trade, the Kingpin learns about the High Evolutionary's scheme and allows the information to reach Spider-Man and Daredevil. Along with Speedball, they defeat the Purifiers before they can enact the High Evolutionary's plan to sterilize all undesirable individuals in the city. While the royal family of the Inhumans is on Earth demanding that Crystal leave the Fantastic Four, The High Evolutionary leads a squad of Gatherers and Eliminators to the Blue Area of the Moon to obtain the Inhumans' Terrigen Mist. Quicksilver leads the Inhumans in defending Attilan until the royal family and the Fantastic Four arrive to repel the invaders. The High Evolutionary next travels to the site of the Savage Land, hoping to restore the damage wrought by Terminus. The X-Men are drawn to the scene as well and aid the Evolutionary in freeing Garokk the Petrified Man from Terminus's power armor. Garokk and the Evolutionary succeed in restoring the Savage Land, and the survivors of Terminus's original attack return from the extradimensional realm in which they had taken refuge. The Exterminators attempt to seal off the Nexus of All Realities in the Everglades to prevent extradimensional entities from polluting humanity's genetic stock. One such entity known as Ylandris takes possession of Cecilia Cardinale, transforming her into Poison in order to stop the Evolutionary's plan, while Spider-Man and the Man-Thing defeat the Exterminators. In the broadest part of his plans, the High Evolutionary plots to construct a bomb that will genetically alter all life on Earth. He sends the Gatherers and a superhuman team known as the Sensors to Wakanda to obtain vibranium necessary for completion of the bomb. Unbeknownst to the Evolutionary, one of the scientists he has forced into his service is Bill Foster, who surreptitiously alerts the Black Panther to the situation. The Panther and the West Coast Avengers defend Wakanda but are unable to prevent the theft of the vibranium. Coincidentally, estranged Avengers Moon Knight, Tigra, and Mockingbird happen upon the High Evolutionary's citadel in the Savage Land and rescue Foster, who recovers his Giant-Man powers. With the security of his base compromised, he relocates his base to the floor of the Pacific Ocean. Before completion of the genetic bomb, the High Evolutionary sends Gatherers to capture a rogue clone of Gwen Stacy for further study, while he visits the Young Gods. Some of the Young Gods decide to interfere with the Evolutionary's master plan, and encounter Spider-Man trying to rescue the clone. The High Evolutionary claims that \\"Gwen\\" is not in fact a clone but someone genetically altered to resemble the original Gwen Stacy, and returns her and Spider-Man to Manhattan. Daydreamer of the Young Gods restores the woman's original memories and appearance. The Evolutionary's researchers reassemble Jocasta, who immediately turns on her captors and attempts to contact the East Coast Avengers about the genetic bomb. However, the team has disbanded and abandoned their headquarters, leaving its computers to assemble an ad hoc team of inactive reservists: The Captain, the Falcon, Hercules, the Beast, and the Hulk. Yellowjacket (Rita DeMara) answers the summons (which she received via the communications equipment she stole from her predecessor) and is allowed to join the team. Using the High Evolutionary's own equipment, the Avengers hyper-evolve Hercules until he is able to match the Evolutionary's power in combat. Both Hercules and the High Evolutionary are apparently destroyed in the battle, leaving the Avengers free to stop the genetic bomb and save the world. Backup stories Each chapter of the crossover features a short back up strip titled \\"The High Evolutionary\\" which was written by Mark Gruenwald with pencil art by Paris Cullins and Ron Lim. This 11 part story details the origins of the High Evolutionary, his previous storylines, and key events in which he participated (such as the origins of Spider-Woman, Quicksilver, and the Scarlet Witch). The series concludes by revealing how the High Evolutionary survived his apparent suicide and began plotting the Evolutionary War. In the course of the story, it is revealed that the High Evolutionary received help from a mysterious benefactor, who provided him with the secrets of the human genetic code and access to Moloids to build his base on Wundagore Mountain. The story never reveals the identity of the benefactor, although it was long speculated to be either Phaeder of the Inhumans or the X-Men villain Mr. Sinister.http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/phaedr.htm It wasn't until nearly 25 years later that Marvel finally officially confirmed the identity of the mysterious ally to have indeed been Phaeder.FF: 50 Fantastic Years #1 (2012) The backup stories were intended to be read in the same order as the lead stories. However, the backups in Amazing Spider-Man Annual #22 and Fantastic Four Annual #21 are transposed, creating some confusion. Amazing Spider-Man Annual #22 contains part 5 of the lead story and part 6 of the backups; Fantastic Four Annual #21 contains part 6 of the lead story and part 5 of the backups. This can be confirmed by reading the relevant stories: In the lead story of Fantastic Four Annual #21, the Watcher refers to events in the lead story of Amazing Spider-Man Annual #22; whereas in the backup of Amazing Spider-Man Annual #22 the High Evolutionary has subdued the werewolf he fought in the backup of Fantastic Four Annual #21. Related stories At the time of the crossover, Marvel was publishing a comic book based on the TV series ALF, and so ALF Annual #1 served as a tongue-in-cheek unofficial tie-in to the story in which the High Evolutionary meets ALF. Years later, the Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe confirmed the canonicity of this story. In Avengers West Coast Annual #4 the U.S. Agent discovers one of the High Evolutionary's storm troopers on an unpopulated Pacific atoll, who is unaware that the Evolutionary War has ended. Thor #407 follows up on the events of Avengers Annual #17 to reveal the fates of Hercules and the High Evolutionary. Alternate Versions =What If?= A postscript of sorts to the series came with What If...? vol. 2 #1 (July, 1989) written by Roy Thomas, which explores the question \\"What if the Avengers lost the Evolutionary War?\\". In this version of the story, the reserve Avengers are unable to stop the High Evolutionary from detonating his bomb. As a result, the evolution of all human life on earth is hyper-accelerated. This process causes humanity to evolve beyond conflict with each other, and between humans and mutants. When Celestials eventually arrive to destroy the Earth, the combined powers of humanity's minds destroy one of them, forcing the remainder to retreat. Mutants, already one step ahead of homo sapiens on the evolutionary scale, ascend to the next level and join together to form a combined group which leaves for space, ultimately destroying Galactus and merging with Death and Eternity to form a being so powerful that it enables the Big Bang of another universe.

Early life  Posen was born and raised in a Jewish familyJewish Virtual Library ‚Äì Jewish Biographies -Fashion Icons: \\"Kenneth Cole\\" retrieved September 7, 2015 in New York City, residing in the SoHo neighborhood of lower Manhattan. He is the son of Susan (n√©e Orzack), a corporate lawyer, and Stephen Posen, an artist. His interest in fashion design started early, and as a child he would steal yarmulkes from his grandparents' synagogue to make ball dresses for dolls. He attended Saint Ann's School, a private school in Brooklyn and in his sophomore year interned with fashion designer Nicole Miller. As a teen, he also won a Scholastic Art and Writing Award. At age 16 he enrolled in the pre-college program at Parsons The New School for Design. He graduated from Saint Ann's in 1999. For three years, Posen was mentored by curator Richard Martin at The Costume Institute of The Metropolitan Museum of Art. At age 18, he was accepted into the womenswear degree program at London's Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design at the University of the Arts London. In 2001, Posen constructed a gown entirely made from thin leather strips and dressmaker hooks and eyes that was displayed by the Victoria and Albert Museum and featured in their \\"Curvaceous\\" exhibition.  Career  In 2000, Posen received a prominent career opportunity after a dress he made for Naomi Campbell changed hands several times among several fashion insiders, including actress Paz de la Huerta. He is famously well-connected and has called Stella Schnabel his muse. Through Interview magazine Editor-in-Chief Ingrid Sischy, Posen met his future publicist and event producer Ed Filipowski of KCD, who offered to represent him for free. Upon returning to New York in 2001, Posen set up an atelier in his parents' living room, while they gave him a USD$15 allowance. In October of the same year, he was chosen to present a capsule collection as part of GenArt's Fresh Faces in Fashion New York 2001. He received a grant for $20,000. After his first runway show in 2001, Posen was courted by fashion titans Yves Carcelle, president of LVMH Fashion Group; Sidney Toledano, CEO and director of Christian Dior S.A.; and Domenico De Sole, president and CEO of Gucci Group NV. Following the success of this presentation, Posen established his design studio in Laight Street Tribeca.

Pavilion of Harmony inside the Chinese University of Hong Kong The Hong Kong Science Park in Pak Shek Kok, next to Ma Liu Shui. Ma Liu Shui is an area in Sha Tin District, in the New Territories, Hong Kong. The area faces Tide Cove (Sha Tin Hoi) and Tolo Harbour. The Chinese University of Hong Kong and the Hong Kong Science Park are located in Ma Liu Shui. Name etymology Ma Liu Shui is directly and phonetically translated to English from \\"È¶¨ÊñôÊ∞¥\\" in Cantonese. It literally means \\"the water that the horses feed on\\". It was originally named \\"È¶¨Â´ΩÊ∞¥\\", with the same phonetic translation, literally meaning \\"the water that the horses play in\\". According to legend of Hakkas, hundreds of years ago when the government of Bao'an County was riding his horse around towns to announce the collection of rice and crops, the horse stopped in the area and went down the hills to drink and play in the lake. It would not leave and looked as if it were at home. The Hakka villagers observed this strange phenomena and cleverly suggested that the horse may have originated from there, therefore the sense of belonging. They named the area \\"È¶¨Â´ΩÊ∞¥\\", which translates to \\"Ma Liu Shui\\" because of this.  History  Ma Liu Shui was a barren land inhabited by Hakkas until in 1956, Chung Chi College was allowed 10 acres of land in Ma Liu Shui to build their campus upon, alongside opened a KCR station also named 'Ma Liu Shui station' for people's convenience. In 1963, Chinese University of Hong Kong was established, setting its campus in Ma Liu Shui. Chung Chi College was therefore expanded, the original KCR station renamed as University station. Ma Liu Shui Village was relocated to its present site in between Lung Yeuk Tau and Kwan Tei, belonging to the Rural committee of Fanling district, and was renamed 'Ma Liu Shui San Tsuen', literally meaning the new village of Ma Liu Shui. In the same year, Yucca de Lac had opened near the Chinese University of Hong Kong. In between 1969 and 1973, the various academic buildings of CUHK and New Asia and United College moved into their new premises next to Chung Chi College. During the 1980s, University station (MTR) became a main transit station for locals because of the redevelopment of the new town in Ma On Shan. The opening of Ma On Shan line in December 2004 helped dilute the crowds and its importance. In 2005, Yucca de Lac was closed down. Another familiar landmark is the ferry dock in Ma Liu Shui. It has the only ferry service connecting the public to Tung Ping Chau, at the same time serving as the gathering spot for sightseeing trips to the coasts of New Territories, which explains its popularity on the weekends. It also had had a hovercraft service crossing the borders to Dameisha Beach, Shenzhen in the early 1980s, which had been closed down.

The station was originally known as Ma Liu Shui Station, but was later renamed University Station. This is also because the Chinese University of Hong Kong is more well-known than the name \\"Ma Liu Shui\\". The Cantonese phonetics also had significant similarities with Ma Niu Shui (È¶¨Â∞øÊ∞¥), prompting the successful lobby of its name change in 1967. The station sign was changed on 1 January 1967. The MTR plans to build another station called \\"Science Park\\" in the Ma Liu Shui area. =Ferry= Ma Liu Shui ferry pier in 2009. There is a ferry pier in Ma Liu Shui, from which regular ferry services run to remote areas including the islands of Tap Mun and Ping Chau in the northeast New Territories. The former ferry service to Wu Kai Sha has now been replaced by a bridge across the Shing Mun River Channel to the Ma On Shan area. =Bus= Next to the railway station, there is a bus terminus. There are several bus routes of the KMB and several routes of Green minibuses. Most of them go to the nearby Ma On Shan area. The following KMB bus routes terminate at the University MTR Station bus terminus: * 87K: Kam Ying Court, Ma On Shan <-> University Station * 87S: Kam Ying Court, Ma On Shan <-> University Station * 99R: Sai Kung <-> University Station * 272A: Pak Shek Kok <-> University Station * 272K: Hong Kong Science Park <-> University Station * 289K: Chevalier Garden, Ma On Shan <-> University Station Cancelled bus routes which formerly terminated at the University MTR Station Bus Terminus: * 84K: Chevalier Garden, Ma On Shan <-> University Station * 287K: Ma On Shan Town Centre <-> University Station Restaurants Restaurants in Ma Liu Shui spread mainly in 2 area: up on the hill inside the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) campus, and the Science Park along to coast.

He is most noticed for being one of the members of a tag team in Jim Crockett Promotions known as the Thunderfoots. He was the original Thunderfoot. Career Joel Jones was discovered while working as a personal trainer by Lars Anderson. Joel was trained by Anderson, who trained him along with David Deaton, who would go on to be his tag team partner. Anderson started his own promotion as a rival to the established Georgia Championship Wrestling, that being World League Wrestling. Jones and Deaton were re-christened \\"The Bruno Brothers\\" and were the company's top tag team winning the titles. After a disastrous tour of the West Indies, the company was on the verge of folding, the Deaton's left and joined the rival Georgia Championship Wrestling. After a brief stays in Georgia & Louisiana they joined Southwest Championship Wrestling under booker Wahoo McDaniel and there they wrestled as \\"the new Anderson Brothers\\". From there they relocated to Florida Championship Wrestling and became The Deaton Brothers. Joel Jones started wrestling in 1983 as \\"Outlaw\\" Joel Deaton in the National Wrestling Alliance's Georgia territory. In 1984, he went to the NWA's Jim Crockett Promotions where he wrestled as the masked Thunderfoot. He would \\"load\\" his boot during his matches and kick his opponents in the head to gain the victory. He was managed by James J. Dillon and often teamed with Black Bart. Dillon left him to manage the Four Horsemen in late 1985. Deaton still as Thunderfoot was joined by Gene Ligon who became Thunderfoot #2, they moved to the NWA's Central States territory and in September 1986 won the tag team titles. On their return to Jim Crockett Promotions the Thunderfoots were used as preliminary wrestlers. Deaton left the team (replaced by David Isley, the team of Ligon & Isley went to on to win the tag titles in Rob Russen's IWA) and Joel once again teamed up with David Deaton. Unfortunately Joel was involved in a head on car accident and was sidelined, he and David left JCP for the last time. In 1988 Joel returned to action in Joe Pedicino and Jerry Blackwell owned, Buck Robley booked Southern Championship Wrestling where he won the SCW Heavyweight title 8 times and the tag team titles 7 times (with Dave Deaton) and feuded with Georgia Power (Nightmare Ted Allen & Jimmy Powell) & Terry Gordy.

In 1991, Jones wrestled as Joel Deaton in the Global Wrestling Federation and teamed with Chaz Taylor in the tournament for the GWF Tag Team Championship. In that same year he formed his most successful team with Billy Black to win the Georgia All Star Wrestling tag team titles. July 1991 was Deaton's finest hour as he and Billy Black (aka The Wild Bunch) teamed up to win the All Asia Tag Team Championship in All Japan, and in 1992, The Wild Bunch made their debuts in Smoky Mountain Wrestling. Deaton & Black remained staples in All Japan throughout the 90's as well as working for the new NWA Georgia territory in 1998. They won the Georgia tag team titles in April 1999, however due to a backstage altercation involving Billy Black & NWA promoter Bill Behrens, they were stripped of the titles, and Black was fired. Deaton was virtually inactive until 2004 when he returned to action in the Carolina independent scene and in 2009 and 2010, Deaton has resurfaced appearing in his home state of Georgia for promotions such as Rampage Pro Wrestling, Allstar Wrestling Network and Championship Wrestling Overload, often teaming or feuding with legends such as Killer Keith Steinborn or Abdullah the Butcher.

There are various forms of distribution deals. There are exclusive and non-exclusive distribution agreements. In an exclusive distribution agreement, there is only one distributor or distribution agent. The distributor is excluded from having any other distributors. Thus the product supplier is limited to the performance of that distributor. If the distributor does not sell product, then no product will be sold. Thus the law implies some degree of effort into these distribution agreements. Thus regardless what the distribution agreement says, the law will find it is breached if the distributor does not actually try to distribute the products. Likewise distribution agreements should have explicit terms on point. This problem arises when distributors distribute several products and/or have other businesses. In a non-exclusive distribution agreement, the supplier may use other distributors, mitigating the above concern. However, at the other end of the spectrum, the supplier may have several distributors, and this may amount to a glut of them in the market, such that distributors have difficulty due to fierce competition on price and terms. Distribution agreements are frequently broken up in terms of countries, such that a set of supply companies in one market/country, possibly supply companies in related fields like sports equipment, share a distribution agent in another market/country. This keeps costs down, allowing the distributor to use economies of scale. Another issue that arises is when either the quality of the supplier or distributor substantially deteriorate. If the counterpart supplier/distributor is excessively tied to them, they may suffer as the supplier/distributor's quality/service deteriorates. All of this should be considered when entering distribution deals. References *Gene K. Landy.

One of twelve sons of Tancred of Hauteville, he journeyed to the Mezzogiorno with his younger brother Drogo in the first half of the eleventh century (c.1035), in response to requests for help made by fellow Normans under Rainulf Drengot, count of Aversa. Between 1038 and 1040, he and other Normans fought in Sicily along with the Lombards as mercenaries for the Byzantine Empire against the Aghlabids. It was there that he won his nickname \\"Iron Arm\\" by single-handedly killing the emir of Syracuse during a sally at the siege of Syracuse. When the Byzantine general George Maniakes publicly humiliated the Salernitan leader, Arduin, the Lombards withdrew from the campaign, along with the Normans and the Varangian Guard contingent. After Maniakes was recalled to Constantinople, the new catapan of Italy, Michael Doukeianos, appointed Arduin the ruler of Melfi. Melfi, however, soon joined other Apulian Lombards in a revolt against Byzantine rule, in which they were supported by William and the Normans. The Byzantines, however, managed to buy off the nominal leaders of the revolt ‚Äì first Atenulf, brother of Pandulf III of Benevento, and then Argyrus. In September 1042, the Normans elected their own leader, ignoring Arduin. The revolt, originally Lombard, had become Norman in character and leadership. William was elected by the Normans as their count after the defection of Argyrus. He and the other leaders, chief among them Drogo and Peter, petitioned Guaimar IV, Prince of Salerno, for recognition of their conquests. They received the lands around Melfi as a fief and proclaimed Guaimar \\"Duke of Apulia and Calabria\\". At Melfi in 1043, Guaimar divided the region (except for Melfi itself) into twelve baronies for the benefit of the Norman leaders: Asclettin received Acerenza, Tristan received Montepeloso, Hugh Tub≈ìuf received Monopoli, Peter received Trani, and Drogo received Venosa. William himself, predominant among the Norman leaders, received the lordship of Ascoli. He was married to Guida, daughter of Guy, duke of Sorrento, and niece of Guaimar. Abbey of the Santissima Trinit√†, Venosa During his reign, William and Guaimar began the conquest of Calabria in 1044 and built the great castle of Stridula, probably near Squillace. In 1045, he was defeated near Taranto by Argyrus. He died in early 1046 and was succeeded by his brother Drogo. His titles were never confirmed by the Holy Roman Emperor. Drogo would be legally called \\"Count of the Normans in all Apulia and Calabria\\" (Comes Normannorum totius Apuliae e Calabriae), and so William is usually titled likewise.

He was briefly flown from Vladivostok to Tokyo in 1946 to testify at the International Military Tribunal for the Far East. Most of Sejima's 11 years in Siberia were spent in a prison in Khabarovsk; years later, Sejima inscribed a memorial stone at the Peace Park in the city. Business and political career Following his return from Siberia, Sejima joined C. Itoh & Co. (now Itochu Corporation) in 1958, where he was initially engaged in its aircraft trading business. He became a director in 1962, just four years after joining the company. Sejima led the corporate planning team at C. Itoh, where he implemented military-style reporting methods and formed a group of followers within the company known as the \\"Sejima machine.\\" He took charge of Itoh's expansion into the oil industry and arranged an alliance between General Motors and Isuzu in 1971. He was also one of three key men involved in Itoh's entry to the People's Republic of China in 1972, making it one of the first Japanese companies to do business with the country. Sejima was also instrumental in Itoh's merger with Ataka & Co.

The CEP is the main organisation associated with an English Parliament. It was formed as a non- denominational lobbying group. It is a single-issue campaign, seeking to stand apart from English nationalist currents, and proclaiming its commitment to a civic, rather than ethnic, conception of the English nation.Kenny, M. (2014) ‚ÄòThe Politics of English Nationhood‚Äô, Oxford University Press, pp.192‚Äì93. Establishment It was set up in 1998 by six founder-members: Harry Bottom, Terry Brown, Guy Green, Pearl Linsell, Tony Linsell, and Cyning Meadowcroft. This was in response to the Devolution acts of that year, which they believed would put the English at a serious political and constitutional disadvantage. They determined that the CEP would represent all of the people of England, whatever their ethnicity or how they chose to identify themselves, who were legitimately living in England and paying taxes to the UK government. The first meeting took place in London in June 1998, and members leafleted the three main political parties (Labour, Liberal Democrat, and Conservative) at their conferences in the autumn of that year. The campaign was incorporated as a not-for-profit company in September 1998 and is not affiliated to any political party. The CEP have on their National Council members and ex-members of the Labour, Liberal Democrat, United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP), English Democrat, and Conservative parties. History The quarterly members' newsletter, \\"Think of England\\", was started in summer 1999 and, in June 2000, about 50 members lobbied their MPs at the Houses of Parliament. In the autumn of 2003, the CEP mounted a \\"Parliament or Partition\\" conference in London which was attended by about 300 people and was addressed by Simon Hughes MP and UKIP's Nigel Farage. The \\"Parliament or Petition\\" conference was in response to the government's intention to hold referendums on devolution to Regional Assemblies. The CEP opposed this on a number of grounds but principally because they believed it would have destroyed the traditional political unity of England as a country, ended the shire system of local government, and withdrawn power from the English local authorities. In 2004, the CEP participated in the English Constitutional Convention, a project which members hoped would encourage debate on the way that England should be governed. 2008 saw the CEP's second major conference \\"The Future of England\\", addressed by Simon Lee, Simon Hughes MP (who stood in for Frank Field at the last minute) and Canon Kenyon Wright, convener of the Scottish Constitutional Convention. In 2009, the CEP co-sponsored a debate at the Convention on Modern Liberty involving Yasmin Alibhai-Brown, Paul Kingsnorth, Gerry Hassan, and Gareth Young. In June 2010, the CEP controversially made a complaint to Fife Police about music store HMV's \\"Anyone but England\\" promotion during the World Cup. A CEP spokesperson explained that the group's motivation was a desire to avoid the sort of Anglophobic violence that marred the 2006 World Cup. Over the years, the CEP have held four meetings in the House of Commons (HoC), they have had letters and articles published in many different media, and they have appeared on radio and television. Members have addressed schools, political associations, and party conferences. They have produced booklets ‚Äì leafleted to the public in town centres, at county shows, and at sporting events ‚Äì and papers, some of which were sent to every Member of Parliament. Peer Mike Knowles, the CEP's former chairman, has appeared before the HoC Justice Committee.

History CJIC began broadcasting on Channel 2 on November 28, 1955, owned by Hyland Broadcasting along with CJIC radio (1490 AM, later CFYN at 1500 and now defunct). Hyland introduced television to the Sault, first with kinescopes and live programming. Later, the microwave brought the live CBC network feed, then colour on the network, and finally to the studio, along with video tape that greatly enhanced production. CJIC also introduced television to the eastern part of Michigan's Upper Peninsula in the United States; the American television networks didn't arrive there until WPBN-TV, the NBC affiliate in Traverse City, signed on a satellite station in 1959 (WTOM) to bring its programming to the Upper Peninsula. In 1976, Hyland merged with Algonquin Broadcasting, owner of the other radio stations on the Canadian side of the locks, to form Huron Broadcasting. Soon after taking control, Huron established a twinstick station, CKCY, affiliated with the CTV Television Network. CKCY adopted the new callsign CHBX-TV in 1988. CJIC moved to channel 5 when CKCY signed on, taking over channel 2. The move of CJIC to channel 5 caused much interference for viewers trying to tune in WNEM-TV from Bay City, Michigan, which was seen on area cable systems on cable channel 5. =Merger into MCTV= In 1990, Baton Broadcasting acquired both Huron Broadcasting and the MCTV twinstick in Sudbury, North Bay and Timmins.

Marie, Ontario from 1977 to 1992. From 1934 to 1977, the station broadcast with the call sign CJIC. CJIC The first radio station in Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, CJIC signed on October 25, 1934. It was owned by Grant Hyland and Jack Whitby and broadcast from studios in the city's Windsor Hotel. By 1935, programming had been expanded and, over time, several notable announcers were added to the staff. In 1936, Grant Hyland bought out his partner to take total control of the station. In 1939, the first radio station in Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan, WSOO signed on. This introduced competition to the market for both listeners and advertising dollars. Services were expanded with more news and sports coverage being introduced, as both stations tried to serve both cities. CJIC became an affiliate of the CBC Trans-Canada Network while WSOO was an affiliate of ABC. Service to the market became more cosmopolitan as a result. On March 29, 1941, CJIC moved from 1500 kHz to 1490 kHz. It's unknown if 1500 kHz was the original AM frequency used when CJIC first launched in 1934. Prior to the station's permanent sign off in 1992 as CFYN, the frequency was at 1050 kHz. The date of the frequency change to 1050 kHz is unknown. In 1955, Highland Broadcasting opened CJIC-TV, bringing CBC Television service to the Sault. In 1956, Hyland died, leaving the stations to his family. Russ Ramsay was appointed manager. With CJIC presenting a popular music, news and sports format, in 1964, CJIC-FM signed on, presenting a varied mix of easy listening programming to the Sault. Hyland Radio and TV also established a station in Wawa, Ontario called CJWA. Some of the programming on this station was simulcast from CJIC. =CJIC personalities= Bruce Smith and Don Sims were both announcers at CJIC. They went on to have lengthy careers with CBC. Mac McCurdy would go on to be the president of Standard Broadcasting. Don Ramsay introduced country music on radio to the twin Sault's from 1942 to 1986. He was also a founding member of the Country Music Disc Jockey Association. Harvey Kirck's first on air staff job was as a newscaster on CJIC in 1948. He would go on to co-anchor the CTV National News with Lloyd Robertson. John Rhodes was a popular radio morning show host and television host and sportscaster. He was elected mayor of Sault Ste. Marie and was later elected as the Sault's MLA at Queen's Park from 1971 to 1978. During that time, he served as Ontario's Minister of Transportation. In addition to being the station manager, Russ Ramsay was a well known sportscaster and play-by- play announcer. He was elected MLA after John Rhodes had died. He served from 1978 to 1985. He held the Labour portfolio in the Bill Davis Conservative government at Queen's Park. Sale of Hyland Radio and TV In 1976, the Hyland family sold its radio, television and cable interests to Huron Broadcasting, owned by a group of businessmen from the Sault and Sudbury. Huron also bought CKCY, CKCY-FM, CJNR in Blind River, CKNR in Elliot Lake and CKNS in Espanola from Algonquin Broadcasting. Due to CRTC regulations regarding concentration of media ownership, Huron was required to sell one AM and one FM license in Sault Ste. Marie. Huron sold CJIC and CJIC-FM to Gilder Broadcasting, owned by former CKCY personality Russ Hilderly and local businessman Bruce Pickersgill. As part of CRTC approval of the sale, Gilder Broadcasting was given new call signs for its radio stations and on February 1, 1977, the stations became CFYN and CHAS-FM. CFYN CFYN broadcast in Sault Ste. Marie from 1977 to 1992. Following the change of ownership in 1977, the majority of the on air staffs and news departments of Hyland and Algonquin stayed with Huron Broadcasting, leaving Gilder Broadcasting to find a new staff for its two stations. On February 1, 1977, CFYN signed on with an on-air lineup that included Norman M from 6:00 to 10:00 am. Joe Petrolo was the main news anchor and Randy Russon was the sports director. Russ Hilderley, president and CEO of Gilder, hosted Reaching Out, a daily phone-in program from 10:00 am to noon, and other hosts included Fred Edwards from noon to 2:00 pm and Brian W. Martin from 2:00 to 6:00 pm. From 6:00 pm on, the station broadcast a variety of CBC and syndicated programming. The overnight program was simulcast from CHAS-FM. =CFYN personalities= Bob Wood was the morning show host over a three-year period from 1979 to 1982. \\"Woody\\" brought an outrageous style and humour that Sault radio had not really heard to that point. Wood subsequently moved to North Bay, where he served as the federal Member of Parliament for Nipissing from 1988 to 2004. News director John Campbell, who joined the station in 1979, introduced listeners to the daily \\"Campbell Comment\\". His commentaries ranged from goings on at Algoma Steel to the Language Resolution and beyond and often generated talk in the community and occasionally rebuttals and headlines in the local papers. Sale to Telemedia In 1985, CFYN and CHAS-FM were sold to Telemedia Communications. But just as Telemedia was establishing itself in the Sault Ste. Marie market, unregulated all hit radio in the form of WYSS was being introduced in Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan. The arrival of YES-FM fragmented the Sault radio audience and made it increasingly difficult for AM music based formats to maintain their audiences. CFYN struggled over the next seven years changing formats several times from adult contemporary, to a combination of news, sports and oldies, to country music. In 1992, Telemedia and the Pelmorex Radio Network, then owners of CKCY and CJQM-FM applied to the CRTC and were allowed to shut down both CFYN and CKCY. The two FM stations went on to form one of Canada's first LMAs and moved into shared office and studio space, with Pelmorex being the managing partner in the arrangement. Fifteen staff at the former Telemedia operation were laid off. CFYN went dark on August 31, 1992. Currently, AM radios in the Sault Ste. Marie market will typically pick up the talk/news station WHO out of Des Moines, Iowa during nighttime hours at 1050 AM and surrounding signals.

It premiered on September 17, 2002 on ABC, and ran for 7 episodes before it became one of the first shows to be canceled during the Fall 2002 season.  Overview  Created by Ben Affleck and Sean Bailey (co- producer of Project Greenlight) and co-produced with Matt Damon and Chris Moore, Push, Nevada was unique in that it offered viewers a chance to follow along and solve the mystery of Push for a prize of $1,045,000. Each episode contained clues, from web addresses in the opening credits to specific phrases uttered by characters in the show, each having its own significance to the mystery. 24-year-old New Jersey resident Mark Nakamoto won the grand prize, calling a special number within just two minutes of the last clue being given during an airing of Monday Night Football. The show's cancellation came about two weeks before the final clue was given, but U.S. law required that the contest continue until its conclusion.  Plot  The show followed a mild- mannered IRS agent, Jim Prufrock, as he traveled to the mysterious desert town of Push, Nevada. While investigating a sizable accounting error made by the Versailles Casino, he begins to realize that there may be stranger things going on in this town than embezzlement. Despite frequent warnings from a \\"Slo-dancer\\", Mary, to leave town before he's in too deep, Jim continues to investigate things that don't seem to add up. After many unpleasant incidents, and with the help of his faithful secretary, Grace, Jim discovers that no one in Push has filed an income tax return since 1985. There's also a clandestine corporation known as Watermark, LLC., that appears to control every financial facet of the town, as well as local law enforcement and even forces in the federal government. With the help of Shadrack, Mary Sloman, Caleb Moore, Job, and other townspeople who seem less crooked, Jim begins to unravel the mystery surrounding the missing million (and Bible), and the strange behavior of Push's residents. By the final episode, Jim has not learned the contents of the North Wing of Martha's Boarding House, or that his father, Alfred (presumed dead since Jim was a child), sent the mysterious fax that first brought him to Push.  Characters  = Main = * Jim Prufrock (Derek Cecil): a mild-mannered IRS agent who travels to Push to investigate a fax that was accidentally sent to his office. * Mary Sloman (Scarlett Chorvat): a \\"Slo-dancer\\" at the local bar who seems to have a great interest in Jim's well-being. = Supporting = * Silas Bodnick (Jon Polito): a rude, little bald man who's been skimming approximately a million dollars from the Versailles Casino each year. He's involved with Watermark LLC, but has no idea how powerful they really are. * Grace (Melora Walters): Jim's enigmatic secretary at the IRS. * Martha (Conchata Ferrell): the owner and operator of Martha's Boarding House. She seems to have known Jim's father, Alfred, from her Slo-Dancing days. * BRB (Tom Towles): a strange truck driver, who picks up Jim in the desert after his car breaks down. BRB is also involved with Watermark. * Oswald Wilkes (Daniel Sauli): Silas Bodnick's killer (with the serpent tattoo). * Mr. Smooth (Armand Assante) * Dwight Sloman (Raymond J. Barry): a crooked businessman, owner of many of Push's establishments (including the Versailles Casino, and the Slo-Dance Bar), and, we find out later, Mary's incestuous father. * Caleb Moore (Monty Bane): constantly freezing local who helps Bodnick steal the money and Bible from the Versailles safe. * Job: an \\"honest mechanic\\". He tows and fixes Jim's car after it breaks down‚Äîfor free. * Ira Glassman: Jim's boss at the IRS. Ira is a yes man, doing what his superiors say, and apparently cannot think for himself. Ira felt comfortable enough with Jim's visit on their first encounter by wrapping up the meeting with \\"let's grab an Arby's\\". * Sheriff Gaines: a moron. His idiocy could be the result of blind obedience to the Watermark boys. Clearly, they control him. * Dawn (Liz Vassey): at first, apparently a flaky, quirky Sheriff's deputy. Later, we learn she is an agent from the U.S. Treasury, investigating Dwight Sloman. * Shadrack (W. Earl Brown): an eccentric desert artist. Shadrack was a city official in Push before Watermark took over. He also used to know Jim's father. * Darlene (Abby Brammell): Jim's soon-to-be ex-wife. She has more addictions than she has money, so between drunken one- night-stands, she calls Jim for more money, which he sends. Later, Watermark does its voodoo on Darlene, and she transforms herself into the perfect little housewife, trying to woo Jim back into her arms (and out of Push). * Delilah (Alexondra Lee): a former Slo-Dancer, now BRB's wife. She's under Watermark's mind-control, but senses there is something wrong with her behavior. * The Well Dressed Men (Larry Poindexter, Steven Culp, Tom Gallop): three expensive- suited, Lexus-driving corporate thugs. They are the go-between for Watermark and Dwight Sloman. They also handle Watermark's public relations through persuasive suggestion. * Michael Sudris (Joel Bissonnette): Job's tattoo- artist friend. He tattoos Jim's back with \\"Death & Taxes\\". He couldn't handle Watermark's mind-control attempts when they first began in Push. He flipped out one day, and moved to Demonhead Flats in his trailer/tattoo parlor to smoke peyote and never watch TV again.  Contest  Clues for the final 6 unaired episodes of Push, NV were given to viewers after the airing of the 7th episode Each of the 13 originally planned episodes was to have a clue word or phrase embedded into it. This word was repeated and hidden several times throughout the episode. For example, the clue for the seventh episode Jim's Domain was \\"www.toyota18.com\\", and that web address was seen throughout the episode as the address of the Carson City IRS, spelled out by letters on stacks of books and boxes, and hidden as an acronym of the news headline \\"Why Would We Drive Or Take Taxis? One Young Orphan Takes An 18 Day Outing To Climb Oracle Mountain\\". After the sixth episode aired, the clues for the remaining 6 unaired episodes were shown, and viewers were told that the final clue would be revealed during the October 28, 2002 episode of Monday Night Football. The complete list of episode clues was: # 1,045,000 # television # orange # Peter Pan # g # Morse code # www.toyota18.com # five # longitude # underwear # southeast # Bodnick # Eliot The final clue given during Monday Night Football was \\"Spaces and punctuation count. Don't count the first episode. Then 5th place, 1st, 9th, 1st, 5th, 7th, 4th, 1st, 2nd, 7th, 5th, and 2nd places in order.\\" By taking the appropriate letters from each episode (5th letter of \\"television\\" is V, 1st letter of \\"orange\\" is O, etc.), the word VONGEYELNAIL was spelled. Replacing EYE with the letter I (as a sign in the background of the clue instructed) produced the word VONGILNAIL, which translates into the phone number 866-445-6245. The first person to call that phone number won the contest.

Drogo of HautevilleIn French he is Dreux or Drogon de Hauteville and in Italian Drogone d'Altavilla. (c. 1010 ‚Äì 10 August 1051) was the second Count of Apulia and Calabria (1046‚Äì51) in southern Italy. Initially he was only the leader of those Normans in the service of Prince Guaimar IV of Salerno, but after 1047 he was a territorial prince owing fealty directly to the Emperor. Drogo was born in Normandy, a son of Tancred of Hauteville and his first wife, Muriella. Around 1035, he arrived with his elder brother William in southern Italy. With his brother, he took part in the campaign of the Byzantine catepan George Maniaches in Sicily (1038) and then in the campaign of Guaimar IV against the Byzantines in Apulia (1041).Manselli 1960. In 1042, Drogo was one of the twelve Norman leaders who met at Melfi to elect his brother William their first count under Guaimar's suzerainty. In the ensuing twelve-part division of the conquered territory in northern Apulia, Drogo received Venosa. In 1044‚Äì45, Drogo fought on behalf of his brother in Apulia. In 1045, he seized Bovino from the Byzantines. After William's death in 1046, Drogo and Peter of Trani were vied to succeed him. Having the support of Guaimar, Drogo was elected by his fellow Normans. In 1047, Drogo married Altrude of Salerno, a Lombard princess. He reached an agreement with the Abbey of Montecassino, which intervened on his behalf to convince Guaimar to release the Norman count of Aversa, Rainulf II, whom he had imprisoned. On 3 February 1047, while the Emperor Henry III was visiting southern Italy, he received Drogo's homage and invested him with all the territory which he already controlled. After this Drogo began using the title \\"Duke and Master of all Italy and Count of all the Normans of Apulia and Calabria\\".Manselli 1960: dux et magister totius Italiae comesque Normannorum totius Apuliae et Calabriae. Although legally, as a direct vassal of the emperor, he was on the same plane as Guaimar, according to the opinion of the historian Ferdinand Chalandon, he remained a feudal dependent of the prince of Salerno. When Drogo's younger half-brother, Robert Guiscard, arrived in Italy before 1050, he was ordered to leave the service of Guaimar's rival, Prince Pandulf IV of Capua, presumably on account of Drogo's obligations to the former. Other newly arrived Normans also gave him trouble: Richard Drengot attacked him and was captured. Only the intervention of Guaimar could secure Richard's release late in 1047 or early in 1048. Abbey of the Santissima Trinit√†, Venosa In 1051, Drogo met with Pope Leo IX, when the latter visited southern Italy at the emperor's command to re-establish the \\"freedom of the church\\" (libertas ecclesiae). Leo forced a promise from Drogo that he would stop the Normans from pillaging. In August, as he was returning from this meeting with the pope, Drogo was assassinated at Monteilaro,Also given as Montoglio, Monte Allegro or Monte Ilario, perhaps to be identified with Orsara di Puglia. near Bovino, the victim of a Byzantine conspiracy organised by the Catepan Argyrus, who was planning the reconquest of Apulia. Drogo was buried in the church of the Santissima Trinit√† in Venosa. Drogo was succeeded by his younger brother Humphrey after a brief interregnum. A certain Richard, who joined the First Crusade, has been identified as Drogo's son. Notes Sources *Raoul Manselli. \\"Altavilla, Drogone d'\\".

Though it originated as a Christian hymn, it is often played by jazz bands. This song was famously recorded on May 13, 1938, by Louis Armstrong and his orchestra. The song is sometimes confused with a similarly titled composition \\"When the Saints Are Marching In\\" from 1896 by Katharine Purvis (lyrics) and James Milton Black (music).CyberHymnal: https://web.archive.org/web/20181206235439/http://hymntime.com/tch/htm/w/s/a/wsamarch.htm Origins and usage The Forerunners of Christ with Saints and Martyrs, a painting by Fra Angelico, 15th century The origins of this song are unclear. It apparently evolved in the early 1900s from a number of similarly titled gospel songs, including \\"When the Saints Are Marching In\\" (1896) and \\"When the Saints March In for Crowning\\" (1908).James J. Fuld, The Book of World-Famous Music, Classical, Popular and Folk, Fourth Edition, 1995. The first known recorded version was in 1923 by the Paramount Jubilee Singers on Paramount 12073. Although the title given on the label is \\"When All the Saints Come Marching In\\", the group sings the modern lyrics beginning with \\"When the saints go marching in\\". No author is shown on the label. Several other gospel versions were recorded in the 1920s, with slightly varying titles but using the same lyrics, including versions by The Four Harmony Kings (1924), Elkins- Payne Jubilee Singers (1924), Wheat Street Female Quartet (1925), Bo Weavil Jackson (1926), Deaconess Alexander (1926), Rev. E. D. Campbell (1927), Robert Hicks (AKA Barbecue Bob, 1927), Blind Willie Davis (1928), and the Pace Jubilee Singers (1928).Robert M. W. Dixon, John Godrich, & Howard Rye, Blues and Gospel Records 1890‚Äì1943, Fourth Edition, 1997. The earliest versions were slow and stately, but as time passed, the recordings became more rhythmic, including a distinctly uptempo version by the Sanctified Singers on British Parlophone in 1931. Even though the song had folk roots, a number of composers claimed copyright in it in later years, including Luther G. Presley and Virgil Oliver Stamps,\\"When the Saints Go Marching In\\" arranged by Luther G. Presley & Virgil O. Stamps, Starlit Crown (Pangburn, AR: Stamps-Baxter Music Company, 1937). R. E. Winsett.Ruth Winsett Shelton, editor. Best Loved Songs and Hymns (Dayton, TN: R. E. Winsett Music Company, 1961), Item 158. The tune is particularly associated with the city of New Orleans. A jazz standard, it has been recorded by many jazz and pop artists. Lyrics As with many numbers with long traditional folk use, there is no one \\"official\\" version of the song or its lyrics. This extends so far as confusion as to its name, with it often being mistakenly called \\"When the Saints Come Marching In.\\" As for the lyrics themselves, their very simplicity makes it easy to generate new verses. Since the first and second lines of a verse are exactly the same, and the third and fourth are standard throughout, the creation of one suitable line in iambic tetrameter generates an entire verse. It is impossible to list every version of the song, but a common standard version runs: Often the first two words of the common third verse line (\\"Lord, how I want...\\") are sung as either \\"Oh how,\\" \\"Oh, Lord\\" or even \\"Lord, Lord\\" as cue notes to the simple melody at each third line. Arrangements vary considerably. The simplest is just an endless repetition of the chorus. Verses may be alternated with choruses, or put in the third of four repetitions to create an AABA form with the verse as the bridge. Some traditional arrangements often have ensemble rather than individual vocals. It is also common as an audience sing-along number. Versions using call and response are often heard, e.g.: * Call: Oh when the Saints * Response: Oh when the Saints! The response verses can echo the same melody or form a counterpoint melody, often syncopated opposite the rhythm of the main verses, and a solo singer might sing another counterpoint melody (solo soprano or tenor) as a 3rd part in more complex arrangements. Analysis of the traditional lyrics The song is apocalyptic, taking much of its imagery from the Book of Revelation, but excluding its more horrific depictions of the Last Judgment. The verses about the Sun and Moon refer to Solar and Lunar eclipses; the trumpet (of the Archangel Gabriel) is the way in which the Last Judgment is announced. As the hymn expresses the wish to go to Heaven, picturing the saints going in (through the Pearly Gates), it is entirely appropriate for funerals.

History = Early beginnings = 1897 map of service area It has never been definitively established where Northwestern Bell's earliest roots lie. The earliest record of telephones in the Northwestern Bell service area was a two-telephone intercom circuit used by a Little Falls, Minnesota druggist and his clerk in 1876. A Bell-licensed exchange is believed to have opened in Deadwood, South Dakota between March and August 1878, just two years after Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone, and several months before President Rutherford B. Hayes could use his phone in a little wooden booth outside of his office in the White House. The earliest documented telephone exchange in Northwestern Bell territory was opened by the Western Union Company in Keokuk, Iowa, on September 1, 1878. Using superior equipment designed by Thomas Edison and Elisha Gray, Western Union was in a competitive shoot-out with local licensee of the National Bell Telephone Company in Boston. On November 10, 1879, Western Union settled a Bell patent infringement suit by getting completely out of the phone business and selling all of its exchanges, including the Keokuk exchange, to the Bell Company. In the fall of 1878, the Northwestern Telephone Company opened an \\"experimental\\" exchange in Minneapolis-located in City Hall, it served the city government as well as the Nicollet Hotel and Pillsbury Mills*. This exchange was the forerunner of the Bell-licensed Northwestern Telephone Exchange Company which was incorporated on December 10, 1878. When the Northwestern Telephone Exchange Company was organized, it had authorized capital stock of $10,000. =Building Northwestern Bell= Northwestern Bell logo, 1984-1988 Telephone companies in the Northwestern Bell Group included the Tri-State Telephone Company, the Dakota Central Telephone Company, the Iowa Telephone Company, the Nebraska Telephone Company and the Northwestern Telephone Exchange. Casper E. Yost served as the president of all the companies. It was a confusing arrangement to regulators, employees and even to the parent company, AT&T.; In a letter to AT&T;, Yost explained that when he was answering a question, making a proposal or discussing a problem in his correspondence with AT&T;, he would use the letterhead of the particular company to which the question, problem or proposal related. One problem with this arrangement, especially for local telephone staffers and historians, is that the carbons of Yost's letters contain no letterheads. Things became less confusing when the Tri-State and Dakota Central companies were folded into the Northwestern Exchange Company. In 1909, a single general office staff for the Iowa, Nebraska and Exchange companies was established in Omaha. On December 10, 1920, Iowa Telephone changed its name to Northwestern Bell Telephone Company. On January, 1921, the Nebraska and Northwestern Exchange companies were merged into the new company. While the new company was incorporated in Iowa, its headquarters remained in Omaha. Sale of telephone lines In 1976, Northwestern Bell sold access lines in the Midland, Philip, Martin, White River, Milesville, and Hayes exchanges to Golden West Telephone, a small telephone cooperative in South Dakota.Golden West Telecommunications history Retrieved 2012-05-02. Headquarters The Northwestern Bell headquarters, now the AT&T; Building (owned by CenturyLink), was located at 118 South 19th Street in Omaha, Nebraska. 150x150px Name usage The Northwestern Bell name is still licensed for use today on telephone equipment produced by Unical Enterprises; otherwise, the NWBT name has disappeared.

History  = Machines Good People Bad (1995‚Äì1999) = Hanzel und Gretyl formed in early 1993. In April, 1994, they completed a demo entitled \\"Kindermusik\\". Of the 200 cassette tapes manufactured, most were sent to record labels and fanzines and some were sold on consignment at a local music store called Bleeker Bob's. In January 1995, after refusing offers from at least one major label to resubmit their demo with only English lyrics, they signed with Energy Records, an indie record label based in New York City. HuG recorded and released their first album, Ausgeflippt, in October 1995. The single \\"Shine 2001\\" topped the Alternative Press dance chart at No. 1 shortly after its release. Performing only several local shows on Manhattan's lower east side, they were recruited to provide support on two US tours in 1995 and 1996 with Marilyn Manson. In 1997, they released their second full-length album, Transmissions From Uranus, that featured a video game in which the object was to transform Loopy and Vas into alien-like insectoid space creatures. The enhanced CD was again cited for its progressive-minded musical stylings and groundbreaking technological advances. This led the band to tour the US extensively with Tommy Victor's Prong, giving them even broader exposure nationally. In between shows on Prong's Cold Fusion tour, Hanzel und Gretyl headlined a Halloween show in Des Moines, Iowa with hometown band Slipknot in direct support. During the same year, Hanzel und Gretyl's song \\"9D Galactik Center\\" appeared in New Line Cinema's Mortal Kombat: Annihilation and was also played at the 1997 MTV Music Awards. Furthermore, the song \\"Robot Logik\\" from the same album was used in radio commercials for the Howard Stern Show. In 1998, clad in custom-made lederhosen, Hanzel und Gretyl toured the US in direct support of Germany's Rammstein on the band's first ever headlining tour of the states after meeting and playing with the band at a CMJ Music Marathon show in New York City. HuG also supported Rob Halford's 2wo in Los Angeles during the Rammstein tour. In 1999 Hanzel und Gretyl completed a full- length CD entitled Oz Faktor that is currently unreleased by Energy Records. The CD depicts a displaced Hanzel und Gretyl lost in a quasi-\\"Wizard of Oz\\" type setting. = Fukken √úber ‚Äì (2003‚Äì2013) = After a long hiatus due to the dissolving of their label, Energy Records, the band signed to Metropolis Records in 2002 and immediately began recording for their long anticipated third album, √úber Alles. Described by Kaizer Von Loopy as a \\"futuristic Wagnerian rock opera\\" and released in 2003, it marked a distinct stylistic change for the band favoring heavy guitar riffs and Germanic themes over the more genre expanding electro-metal style for which they had become known in the 90s. The CD was met with a fair amount of controversy over its parodic cross-referencing of both German and American stereotypes set against a surreal and spaced-out WWII backdrop but nevertheless attained a four out of five star review in Kerrang! magazine and equally high praise from New York City's prestigious The Village Voice. Following the release of the album, the band toured the US as a headliner on their aptly named \\"Fukken Uber Tour\\" and later in direct support of The Genitorturers in the states and Canada after which they returned to the studio to record a new album. In September 2004, the band released their fourth album, Scheissmessiah. The album was immediately hailed as required listening for fans of industrial metal alongside Nine Inch Nails, KMFDM and Ministry by Revolver Magazine. The band continued to grow harder and heavier touring the states in support of My Life with the Thrill Kill Kult and Ministry for a three-month stint on their \\"Evil Doer Tour\\" throughout the US and Canada. Hanzel und Gretyl co-headlined, along with Slick Idiot, the first Gothicfest at the Odeum Expo Center in Illinois. In 2006, the band toured North America for the release of their four-song EP \\"Oktotenfest 2006\\" with label mates Bella Morte as direct support. In 2006, they provided direct support on Cradle of Filth's UK tour. February, 2007 saw the release of 2012: Zwanzig Zw√∂lf. Drawing more and more from death metal and black metal sentiments, 2012 is HuG's heaviest offering thus far leading to HuG's first-ever headlining shows overseas beginning in Moscow, Russia in September 2008. In January 2009, Hanzel und Gretyl kicked off their extensive headlining \\"World Fukken Tour 2009\\" including shows throughout the US, Europe, UK, Scandinavia, Russia, Ukraine, New Zealand and Australia ending with a final show in New York City on December 19, 2009. On August 8, 2010, with the number 87 as the numerical representation of the band and the words \\"More German Than German\\" found on their backdrop and T-shirts Hanzel und Gretyl performed to a capacity crowd on the main stage at M'era Luna Festival in Hildesheim, Germany. Born To Be Heiled, Hanzel und Gretyl's 6th full-length CD release on November 27, 2012 was launched as a debut release for the newly formed Metropolis Metal Records, a subdivision of Metropolis Records that focusses on their more metal based electronic and industrial bands. Beginning in June 2012, HuG followed up the completion of Born To Be Heiled with multiple extensive headlining tours including Australia, New Zealand, US, Canada, Russia, and Europe. \\"Hanzel und Gretyl F√ºr Immer\\" an album composed entirely of remixes of their previous CD, \\"Born To Be Heiled\\", was completed by \\"KyzrW√∂lf\\" aka Kaizer Von Loopy, in July 2013 and slated for worldwide release by Metropolis Records on October 8, 2013 . = Grimm Shiza (2014‚Äìpresent) = October 2014 saw the release of HuG's 7th album, Black Forest Metal and the beginning of a new era for the band. Perhaps their darkest and most metal sounding release to date, BFM employs satanic themes cross-referenced with forest motifs from the original Brothers Grimm fairy tale. U.S. and European tours followed the release. 2015 found Hanzel und Gretyl playing select dates in the US and returning in October to Europe, UK, Russia and also Greece for the first time in the band's history. September 25, 2015, Hanzel und Gretyl appears in the DVD / Blu ray release Rammstein in Amerika, being interviewed amongst the likes of artists Steven Tyler, Kiss, Marilyn Manson, Iggy Pop, Korn, Slash and others discussing Rammstein's first shows in America with Hanzel und Gretyl in 1997 & 1998 and eventual ascent which led to Rammstein's sold out show at Madison Square Garden on December 11, 2010. On July 26, 2017 Loopy released a solo album under the name KyzrW√∂lf with the album titled Reichstar, also stating a new HuG album coming in 2018, on February 24 the new album titled Satanik Germanik is available for pre- order, with another album titled Hexennacht being released in 2019.

The ballad \\"If Only\\" is in memory of Tiffany's bodyguard, Frank D'Amato, who died of cancer at age 34 not long before the album was released.\\"Second Verse\\", People Weekly, September 25, 2000, p. 85 An online download version, and a version released in non-US countries, each had bonus tracks not found on the original US CD release. The song \\"Open My Eyes\\" was used in the film BearCity. Critical reception and commercial performance The Color of Silence received some very favorable reviews. A Billboard front-page article called it \\"thoughtful, intelligent, and full of grace\\", and said that it could be considered \\"Tiffany's equivalent to Alanis Morissette's landmark Jagged Little Pill.\\"Paoletta, Michael, \\"Tiffany Tells Stories Her Way\\", Billboard, August 19, 2000, p. 1 However, the album did not achieve commercial success to match the critical welcome. It made it onto the shelves of many record stores, but was not heavily promoted; it ended up selling mostly to the established fan base which had stuck with Tiffany over the years, as well as to a few new fans attracted by word of mouth or dance club play of songs from this album.

She was Singapore's Ambassador to the United States from July 1996 to July 2012.  Academic career  Chan graduated with a first- class honours degree in political science from the University of Singapore (now the National University of Singapore) in 1964, and went on to study for a M.A. degree from Cornell University in 1967. She received a PhD from the University of Singapore in 1974. Her thesis has the title: The Dynamics of One-party Dominance: A Study of Five Singapore Constituencies. Chan was previously the Executive Director of the Singapore International Foundation and served as Director of the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies. She was also the founding Director of the Institute of Policy Studies. Chan was a member of the International Advisory Board of the New York-based Council on Foreign Relations, a council member of the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) in London, and a council member of the International Council of the Asia Society in New York. When Ambassador Chan left Washington at the end of her appointment as Ambassador to the US, she received the Inaugural Asia Society Outstanding Diplomatic Achievement Award, the Inaugural Foreign Policy Outstanding Diplomatic Achievement Award 2012 and the United States Navy Distinguished Public Service Award. Chan has received a number of awards, including honorary Doctor of Letters degrees from the University of Newcastle in 1994 and the University of Buckingham in 1998. She is also a political science professor on secondment at the National University of Singapore. She was also twice awarded the National Book Awards in 1986 for ‚ÄúA Sensation of Independence: A Political Biography of David Marshall‚Äù and in 1978 for ‚ÄúThe Dynamics of One Party Dominance: The PAP at the Grassroots‚Äù. She is also the current chairman of the Lee Kuan Yew Centre for Innovative Cities at the Singapore University of Technology and Design.  Diplomatic career  Chan (first from left) and Lee Kuan Yew meeting William S. Cohen during Lee's visit to the United States in 2000. Chan served as Singapore's Permanent Representative to the United Nations from 1989 to 1991. During this time, she was concurrently accredited as the High Commissioner to Canada and Ambassador to Mexico. She became the Ambassador to the United States in 1996. At the time, she was the first woman ambassador from an East Asian country to be assigned to the United States. Chan expressed surprise at her appointment, noting \\"I'm anti-establishment and was a bit of a dissident before I was appointed ambassador. It came as something of a shock to me when I was offered the ambassadorship because I was highly critical of government in a society that is not used to being critiqued.\\" Like Tharman Shanmugaratnam, Ho Kwon Ping and other former political critics, Chan is part of a small group of well-educated dissidents who have subsequently been appointed into high- profile positions in the People's Action Party (PAP)-dominated Singapore government, or who have otherwise become part of the establishment. In 1998, Chan received the Inaugural International Woman of the Year Award from the Organization of Chinese American Women (OCAW), and Singapore's first \\"Woman of the Year\\" award in 1991. Chan received Singapore's Public Administration Medal (Gold) in 1999, Meritorious Service Medal in 2005 and the Distinguished Service Order, the highest National Day Award, in August 2011. Chan left her post as Singapore's Ambassador to the US on 23 July 2012, and was replaced by Ashok Kumar Mirpuri. During her tenure, bilateral relations between Singapore and the US improved tremendously. In May 2003, Singapore and US signed the US- Singapore Free Trade Agreement (USSFTA), the first FTA that the US entered into with a Southeast Asian country. Both countries also enhanced their ties in areas of defence and security.Yeo, E. (2003, May 5). A US-S‚Äôpore first. Today, p. 17. Retrieved from NewspaperSG During October 2012, in relation to a discussion on the choice Asian nations may have in terms of supporting China or the US, Chan was quoted as saying, \\"The United States should not ask Asian countries to choose. You may not like the results if you ask countries to choose.\\" Chan was appointed to the Presidential Council for Minority Rights in 2012 and was re-appointed in 2015. She was also appointed as the chairman of the National Arts Council in 2013. From November 2012 to October 2015, the Singaporean government appointed her for a three-year term service as Singapore‚Äôs Representative to the ASEAN Intergovernmental Commission on Human Rights (AICHR), succeeding Singapore‚Äôs first AICHR Representative, Mr Richard R. Magnus.  Controversies  In October 2015, Chan's call to retain the Chinese-Malay-Indian-Others framework as it \\"sets minority communities here at ease\\" sparked a debate, with a Malay Singaporean finding her \\"very wrong. She is from [the] majority and she is elite. She doesn't represent us\\". An online poll on Dialectic.sg found a majority of 52.8% of the respondents in favour of abandoning such racial categorisation. In November 2015, Chan spoke at the Singapore International Film Festival (SGIFF) to defend the National Arts Council (NAC)'s censorship policies, prompting calls to boycott the NAC. Chan, NAC's chairman, did not warn the organisers, the strictly no-censorship SGIFF, of her talk's contents. Notably, NAC does not even oversee or supervise Singapore's film industry. In February 2016, Chan, who is on the Yale-NUS College governing board, delivered a speech defending Singapore's decision to uphold Section 377A at the 24th session of the United Nations Human Rights Council's Universal Periodic Review in Geneva, Switzerland. Her speech prompted students' calls for Chan's removal from the school's governing board, while others said a removal would be unfair because Chan was speaking as a Singaporean ambassador, not as a governor of the college. The school rejected calls to remove her.  Personal life  Chan's father was a businessman. She has two brothers and a sister. Her brother Alan Chan was a top civil servant and the current CEO of Singapore Press Holdings while the other brother Chan Heng Wing is also a diplomat and currently serves as Singapore's Ambassador to the Republic of Austria. She was formerly married to architect Tay Kheng Soon.

World War II He was trained in the 45th Inf. Philippine Scouts, with the rank of Lieutenant, assigned as an Instructor to the 91st Div. 92nd Inf., Philippine Army in May 1941. The 91st Div. 92nd Inf. was established on Samar and on Sept 12, 1941 they were transferred to Luzon and their training camp was near Cabanatuan. About Dec. 20th they were ordered to assist the 26th Cavalry Philippine Scouts in Pampanga province and engaged in combat until the retreat to Bataan near the end of Dec. During the retreat he and some others of the 91st were cut off by the Japanese and delayed getting into Bataan in January where they found their former training camp had been taken over by the Japanese. He and another member of the 45th Inf. Philippine Scouts, Lt. Robert Lapham, formed a guerrilla unit on the Luzon Cental Plains, and Juan became a leader of this unit and promoted to Captain. This unit included the remnant of the 91st who were with him and new recruits. Raid at Cabanatuan The Raid at Cabanatuan was a rescue of Allied prisoners of war (POWs) and civilians from a Japanese camp near Cabanatuan City, in the Philippines. On January 30, 1945, during World War II, United States Army Rangers, Alamo Scouts, and Filipino guerrillas liberated more than 511 from the POW camp. Under the command of Captain (later promoted Major) Juan Pajota, who coordinated support, this force was responsible for the roadblock at the Cabu River bridge that totally destroyed the Japanese 359th Independent Infantry Battalion. Without the guerrilla‚Äôs support it is unlikely that the raid would have been as successful or even succeeded at all. =Military tactics= His intimate knowledge of the enemy's activity, the local people and terrain proved to be crucial to the rescue. His instructions to the local villagers to muzzle their dogs to quell barking at passing American troops was timely and prudent. His recommendation that the mission be moved back 24 hours to Lt. Col. Henry A. Mucci due to heavy Japanese activities proved to be a wise move. Another great idea of Capt. Pajota was a flyover of an American plane to divert the enemy's attention and distract their attention while the troops were moving. His troops held back the advancing Japanese tanks and reinforcements and prevented them from crossing the Cabu Bridge to engaged the rescuers and POWs. He had procured about 50 carabaos (water buffalo) carts for a caravan that was used to transport the prisoners to friendly lines that saved the lives of many prisoners. Later Years Juan Pajota left the Philippines and was brought to the United States by his friend and author, Forrest Bryant Johnson, who he had met while Mr. Johnson was researching for a book he wrote on the raid of Cabanatuan which was entitled The Hour of Redemption and originally published in 1977. It later was released in 2002 under Warner Books. Death A former Dean of the College of Commerce in the Philippines, Juan Pajota came to the U.S., took a job with the Milwaukee Railroad to make ends meet and pursue his US citizenship goal in 1976. A year later while he was still waiting for his citizenship approval, he died of a heart attack a few days before his case was resolved. Popular culture Captain Juan Pajota appeared as a character for the 2005 John Dahl film, The Great Raid. He was played by Filipino actor Cesar Montano.

It was used as a movie theater until 1976, when it was sold to the City of Erie. In the early 1980s, Erie converted the theater to a performing arts center, which has become the focus of a downtown revival. The theater features a 65-foot- by-28-foot proscenium stage and is complemented by crushed velour, gold and silver leaf, and gold-backed French mirrors. Today it hosts concerts and Broadway theatre performances and is home to the Erie Philharmonic and the Lake Erie Ballet. The Warner's Grand Lobby has capacity for up to 500 persons for a reception.

The term relates specifically to the meeting place of witches within certain modern religious movements such as Wicca that fall under the collective term Modern Paganism, also referred to as Contemporary Paganism or Neopaganism. It functions to provide a place for the group to conduct rituals, undertake lessons and recognise festivals. It can also be referred to as the home of the coven. A group‚Äôs covenstead is often a physical geographical location, however it can also be a concept such as an astral temple. A covenstead is commonly located in the house of the priest or priestess or a member of the coven, but it can also be a public area such as a park or a room in a community building. An appropriate location is selected depending on a number of factors including the size of the coven. The types of covensteads recognised by practitioners have developed over time as technology and the various denominations of Neopaganism have evolved.  Etymology  The word ‚Äòcoven‚Äô is derived from Old French and in the 1500s meant a ‚Äúmeeting, gathering, assembly‚Äù. Around 1660 it also came to mean ‚Äúa gathering of witches‚Äù. The word ‚Äòstead‚Äô comes from the Old English term stede, meaning ‚Äúplace, position‚Äù.  Origin and history  Brickett Wood, Hertfordshire, England Modern pagan witchcraft practices and rituals are largely associated with Gerald Brosseau Gardner (1884-1964) who is attributed to reviving the ancient pagan religion Wicca in the 1950s. Wicca and other religions considered to be derived from pre-Christian traditions are closely associated with nature, spirituality and witchcraft. Various denominations of the Modern Pagan religion also celebrate a number holidays and festivals throughout the year. Gardner founded his own coven in the 1940s and established their covenstead on his land at Brickett Wood in Hertfordshire, north of London. He was responsible for re-writing certain rituals that were practiced by his previous coven using borrowed concepts from magician Aleister Crowley, Charles Godfrey Leland‚Äôs Aradia, or the Gospel of the Witches and the medieval spell book Key of Solomon. Gardner‚Äôs Brickett Wood covenstead acted as a place in which his coven could carry out these rituals, celebrate the various festivals and hold general meetings.  Functions  There are multiple functions of a covenstead. It is recognised by the group as an established and familiar location and allows members to focus on the proceedings of their meetings. A predominate function is to allow a safe space for sabbats (seasonal festivals recognised by modern Pagans) and esbats (a meeting other than a festival) to take place. It can also be a place to worship the gods and goddesses, to conduct the various rituals and to hold witchcraft classes. It is also often used as a location for communal celebration and various social gatherings. An example of a ritual that can take place in a covenstead is an esbat rite. This rite involves the process of the priest or priestess initiating the proceedings, members of the circle giving their thanks, making requests to their gods and goddesses followed by the ringing of a bell. The ritual can also involve music, song and chanting.  Types of covensteads  Depending on the location and residence of coven members and the size of their group, a covenstead can be established in a number of spaces both indoor and outdoor. As a predominate function of a covenstead is to provide a safe space to conduct rituals it is typically found somewhere coven members can remain uninterrupted and able to concentrate. This space can be either permanent or temporary. A room in the house of a priest or priestess is a common location. Other possible spaces include rooms of other coven members‚Äô homes, public parks or rented spaces in community buildings. Another alternative option some covens resort to is an astral temple - a shared non-physical place for coven members to access if they are unable to attend the physical covenstead. The surrounding community can also be a contributing factor when deciding where to establish a covenstead as there is often suspicion and prejudice surrounding the term ‚Äòwitch‚Äô. Gerald Brosseau Gardner registered his Brickett Wood covenstead under the name of the Ancient British Church - into which he was ordained - as a response to this prejudice and with the aim of making it appear more reputable. A successful example of a coven‚Äôs integration into a community is the establishment of the House of Oak Spring‚Äôs covenstead in Decatur, Georgia in 2000. The group purchased a secluded home with surrounding acreage with the intention of remodelling the property to act as their common meeting place and to serve their various needs. The group also began developing walking paths through the surrounding land to be accessed and utilised by the coven‚Äôs members as well as residents of their suburban community, which was well received.  Online covensteads  Various denominations of Neopaganism have adapted alongside technological developments and have found new tools and methods of communication to reach their followers and members including online congregations and rituals. The members of these online communities were dubbed ‚ÄúTechnopagans‚Äù in a 1995 Wired article. Technopagans don't often meet in person but form close relationships with one another similar to those within covens that meet in person regularly. There are examples of online pagan meetings carried out on CompuServe conference rooms in which members participated remotely in rituals such as celebrations of the full moon. Although there was no face to face contact between members of the covens, rituals were still carried out and festivals were celebrated. In this online space where music and chanting aloud cannot be practiced as a group, physical objects and key phrases are simply typed. The online virtual world Second Life is also host to neopagan meetings and ceremonies. The affordances of the site allow for ‚Äòcybercovens‚Äô to meet virtually using avatars to participate in social events and rituals. On Second Life, users can visit a pub or a digital marketplace, meditate, access digital copies of neopagan texts and gather at an altar to carry out rituals and sabbats. The experience can be likened to covensteads situated in the astral temple. The avatars created on Second Life can resemble the user's own physical appearance but can also allow the user to construct an alternative self that enhances their online spiritual experience with features such as wings. More recent examples of online rituals and gatherings of modern Pagans include Youtube channels. Through videos, single practitioners are brought together to collectively partake in these rituals, share knowledge with each other and celebrate the various festivals. Although online gatherings can allow people from across the globe to connect and participate in religious rituals, there are certain elements of practices carried out online that hinder the smooth procession of the experience such as the loading time of graphics and animations. Often alterations to ritual techniques are necessary in order for them to be successfully carried out in an online format. Participants usually exercise a certain amount of imagination during the virtual proceedings. Due to the increasing prevalence of online neopagan gatherings, devices used to participate, such as laptops, are often considered ritual objects that belong on the altar alongside other rituals objects including candles. = On social media = With a number of prominent social media personalities gaining significant followings from sharing their neopagan beliefs and practices on their channels, there are reports such as a 2018 iNews UK article that suggests these followings aren't covens but are instead communities. This also suggests that these online communities, although come together to meet, are not meeting in a covenstead, but something else entirely.  Covensteads in folklore and popular culture  'Charmed' House, Los Angeles, USA Pagan sites and places witches gather to carry out rituals and to worship gods and goddesses have existed in folklore and popular culture for centuries. Chanctonbury Ring, located in South Downs, England with remains as old as 300BC, is believed to be an early pagan site and continues to have pagan ties with reports of groups still visiting the land to participate in occult activities. There are various interpretations of Paganism and Neopaganism in modern popular culture with TV shows, films and novels including American Horror Story: Coven', the Harry Potter series, Charmed, Witches of Eastwick and The Craft all being examples of entertainment depicting modern representations of ancient practices and beliefs. As each show, film or novel represent varying interpretations of these revived and renewed ancient religious practices, representations of convensteads also vary and often there is no identifiable covenstead at all. The 1998 American TV series Charmed, starring Hollie Marie Combs, Alyssa Milano and Rose McGowan, was a highly rated show that depicted three witch sisters living together in a single house they called the Halliwell Manor. This house was often the place in which they carried out spells and rituals with the Book of Shadows. However, in the Harry Potter books and films, the education of magic primarily occurs in an institute dedicated to the purpose, The Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, instead of a more private and secluded room or home that is traditionally identified as a covenstead.

It is on Arbatsko-Pokrovskaya and Filyovskaya Lines serving as a cross-platform interchange between them and as a terminus of the latter. The station originally opened on 31 August 1965, as part of the extension of the Filyovsky radius, but on 7 January 2008, it was expanded and rebuilt as a part of the Strogino‚ÄìMitino extension. Description The 1965 construction was designed by Robert Pogrebnoy to a standard design of the 1960s surface level stations, with two identical glazed vestibules on each side of the Rublyovo highway, and two canopies extending over each of the platform ends supported by a single row of marble pillars. The 2008 reconstruction was designed by Architect A. Vigdorov, and this added a new longer platform running parallel to the old one, larger modern vestibules, and extending the old platform to provide access over the Arbatsko-Porkovskaya's tracks via a glazed overpass. This was necessary as the old platform length was designed for the Filyovskaya's six-car-long trains, whilst the Arbatsko-Pokrovskaya presently operates seven-car-long trains, with likelihood of them being further lengthened to eight cars long. North platform was closed for reconstruction since October 2017 to March 2019. Operation Before reconstruction, Kuntsevskaya was operating on regular basis as any other station of the Moscow Metro, meaning that trains were passing right-hand side with access through the left door. It was directly connected to the Pionerskaya and Molodyozhnaya stations of the Filyovskaya Line. The current operation differs in terms of servicing. That is, the new one-track platform gathers trains of Arbatsko-Pokrovskaya arriving from Strogino and dispatches them to Slavyanskiy Bulvar. Arbatsko-Pokrovskaya trains moving in the opposite direction arrive at the southern track of the old platform, while the remaining track is used by Filyovskaya Line (trains coming from Pionerskaya arrive at the track and then head back to Pionerskaya from the same track). Station design Architecturally the new platform sufficiently differs from its older neighbour, which was the last of the 1960s surface stations of the Moscow Metro, built at a time when the minimum of resources was spent on architecture and engineering. It includes two vestibules: the western one has its ticket hall outside, whilst the larger eastern one encompasses it into one large structure; marble and granite as well as new metalloplastic materials of orange and brown tones are used. In the future it is planned that the older platform will also be upgraded with newer technology and decoration similar to its neighbour. {  valign=topOlder 1965 platform } References Category:Moscow Metro stations Category:Railway stations in Russia opened in 1965 Category:Arbatsko-Pokrovskaya Line Category:Filyovskaya Line ","title":"Kuntsevskaya (Moscow Metro)"}]`),P={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:M},data(){return{visibleCount:3,poemsData:B}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=3}}},I={class:"card-container"};function H(s,e,o,c,u,i){const m=p("PoemCard");return t(),n(h,null,[e[1]||(e[1]=a("section",null,[a("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[a("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"üéâ your wikipediaü•≥")])])],-1)),a("section",null,[a("div",I,[(t(!0),n(h,null,y(i.visiblePoems,(r,g)=>(t(),w(m,{key:g,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),n("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...r)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...r))},"See more")):b("",!0)])],64)}const R=d(P,[["render",H]]),N=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"glossary/41.md","filePath":"glossary/41.md"}'),L={name:"glossary/41.md"},F=Object.assign(L,{setup(s){return(e,o)=>(t(),n("div",null,[v(R)]))}});export{N as __pageData,F as default};
