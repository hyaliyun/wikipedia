This movie is double-billed with short CGI movie, , one of the shorts for the 2013 cardass game Mega Monster Rush: Ultra Frontier, which played first before the premier of the movie. A DVD and Blu-Ray release of the movie was sold in December 25, 2013 by Bandai Visual, costing around 3,990 and 5,040 Yen respectively. The main catchphrase in this movie is . Synopsis =Mega Monster Rush: Ultra Frontier - Dino- Tank Hunting= At a desert arena, various participants tried to take down the Dino-Tank Mk II. With most participants eliminated, only one team left: the Rush Hunters, consisting of Baltan Battler Barrel, Guts Gunner Garm and Magma Master Magna. After a failed attempt to attack while Dino-Tank trapped inside an electrical field, Barrel turned himself into a barrier long enough to contain the Plasma Monster for Garm and Magna to attack, but the technique greatly exhausted Barrel. In a last effort, Barrel quickly destroyed the last Plasma Soul, causing Dino-Tank to fall into a pit for the Rush Hunters to win. Their Hunter Leader, Djent, express his satisfaction before reminding himself that his team still had a long way to go. =Ultraman Ginga Theater Special= The film started with a brief introduction given by Alien Valkie to the viewers, where he review past incidents from first to sixth episodes of Ultraman Ginga. After finish reviewing, he told the viewers that the mastermind still had his supply of monsters before fading. The mysterious figure surveyed through his Spark Dolls collection and brought one to life, an Alien Icarus. While Hikaru contacted his parents in Glasgow, Scotland, both him and Taro received visions of monsters, which came from Mt. Furuboshi. The next day, Hiakru and his childhood friends went on a hike to Mt. Furuboshi to collect six Spark Dolls that had been scattered. The group split into two, Hikaru and Chigusa, followed by Misuzu, Taro and Kenta. With Hikaru and Chigusa found one first, Kenta, Misuzu and Taro stumbled upon Alien Icarus, whom also had the same goal in mind. Tomoya joined the three as they confiscated the Spark Doll from Icarus and the latter expelled by Taro's power. Tomoya's arrival was only due to crossing paths with them in his investigating mission, but Taro insisted him to protect them. With two Spark Dolls in his possession, Icarus tried to impersonate Misuzu to trick Hikaru and Chigusa into giving them their Spark Dolls but the Ginga Spark emitted a backlash wave that shed half of his disguise, causing the two to escape and met the other group via Tomoya's signal. Alien Icarus chased after them and hold Misuzu as a hostage, later taking the Spark Dolls in exchange of her. With the Spark Dolls in his possession, Icarus fused with them into the monster Tyrant. Hikaru as well decided to use a special Spark Doll, Ultraman Tiga and engaged in a fight against the monster. Having drained up most of his energy, Tiga almost defeated until Tomoya brought Jean-nine into the battle as the two defeated Tyrant, separating Alien Icarus from the six Spark Dolls. The captured Icarus tried to tell his secret out of the safety of his life but before he could do so, the mysterious figure turned him into a Spark Doll and bring forth Dark Zagi. The dark Ultraman quickly weakened Tomoya/Jean-nine in its frenzied combat skilled and nearly torn the robot until Ginga appeared and took over Jean-nine in the battle. Having fight in various continents around the world, both Ultra Warriors returned to the Mt. Furuboshi before they clashed their finishers, concluding the battle with Dark Zagi's defeat. His Spark Doll was quickly recovered before Hikaru could find it. The group nonetheless return to their homes. Misuzu wondered if Hikaru's mission had concluded but both him and Taro denied as such. After the ending credits, the Spark Doll Theater casts felt asleep until the realized that their screen time is currently running, causing all of them to go frantic. Taro, whom was watching the incident from behind reminded the viewers that Ultraman Ginga would return to broadcast in November.

History Vestskoven was established in the late 1960s to provide easy access to recreational areas for the rapidly growing population of Copenhagen's western suburbs in accordance with the Finger Plan. The area was landscaped with artificial hills and lakes. The first trees were planted in 1967. Topography Herstedh√∏je is a group of artificial hills located just north of Hersted√∏ster in Albertslund Municipality. It rises to 67 metres or 30-35 metres above the surrounding countryside. Oxbjerget is an artificial hill situated just north of Hvissinge in Glostrup Municipality in the easternmost part of Vestskoven. Its highest point is 35 metres and it rises approximately 15 metres above the surrounding terrain. It is located in a fenced part of the forest where unleashed dogs are permitted. Store Vejle√•dal in the westernmost part of Vestskoven is grazed by cattle. Vestskoven contains two boglands. Harrestrup Mose is located on the north side of the forest.

The constancy (immutability) of any \\"physical constant\\" is thus subject to experimental verification. Paul Dirac in 1937 speculated that physical constants such as the gravitational constant or the fine-structure constant might be subject to change over time in proportion of the age of the universe. Experiments conducted since then have put upper bounds on their time-dependence. This concerns the fine structure constant, the gravitational constant and the proton-to-electron mass ratio specifically, for all of which there are ongoing efforts to improve tests on their time-dependence.CODATA Recommended Values of the Fundamental Physical Constants: 2010\\" (March 15, 2012): \\"Although the possible time variation of the constants continues to be an active field of both experimental and theoretical research, there is no observed variation relevant to the data on which the 2010 recommended values are based; see, for example, the recent reviews by Uzan (2011) and Chiba (2011). Other references may be found in the FCDC bibliographic database at physics.nist.gov/constantsbib using, for example, the keywords 'time variation' or 'constants.'\\". The immutability of these fundamental constants is an important cornerstone of the laws of physics as currently known; the postulate of the time-independence of physical laws is tied to that of the conservation of energy (Noether theorem), so that the discovery of any variation would imply the discovery of a previously unknown law of force.\\"Any constant varying in space and/or time would reflect the existence of an almost massless field that couples to matter. This will induce a violation of the universality of free fall. Thus, it is of utmost importance for our understanding of gravity and of the domain of validity of general relativity to test for their constancy.\\" Uzan (2011) In a more philosophical context, the conclusion that these quantities are constant raises the question of why they have the specific value they do in what appears to be a \\"fine-tuned universe\\", while their being variable would mean that their known values are merely an accident of the current time at which we happen to measure them.Uzan (2011), chapter 7: \\"Why Are The Constants Just So?\\": \\"The numerical values of the fundamental constants are not determined by the laws of nature in which they appear. One can wonder why they have the values we observe. In particular, as pointed out by many authors (see below), the constants of nature seem to be fine tuned [Leslie (1989)]. Many physicists take this fine-tuning to be an explanandum that cries for an explanans, hence following Hoyle [(1965)] who wrote that 'one must at least have a modicum of curiosity about the strange dimensionless numbers that appear in physics.'\\" Dimensionality It is problematic to discuss the proposed rate of change (or lack thereof) of a single dimensional physical constant in isolation. The reason for this is that the choice of a system of units may arbitrarily select any physical constant as its basis, making the question of which constant is undergoing change an artefact of the choice of units. For example, in SI units, the speed of light has been given a defined value in 1983. Thus, it was meaningful to experimentally measure the speed of light in SI units prior to 1983, but it is not so now. Tests on the immutability of physical constants look at dimensionless quantities, i.e. ratios between quantities of like dimensions, in order to escape this problem. Changes in physical constants are not meaningful if they result in an observationally indistinguishable universe. For example, a \\"change\\" in the speed of light c would be meaningless if accompanied by a corresponding \\"change\\" in the elementary charge e so that the ratio e2:c (the fine-structure constant) remained unchanged. \\"[An] important lesson we learn from the way that pure numbers like Œ± define the World is what it really means for worlds to be different. The pure number we call the fine structure constant and denote by Œ± is a combination of the electron charge, e, the speed of light, c, and Planck's constant, h. At first we might be tempted to think that a world in which the speed of light was slower would be a different world. But this would be a mistake. If c, h, and e were all changed so that the values they have in metric (or any other) units were different when we looked them up in our tables of physical constants, but the value of Œ± remained the same, this new world would be observationally indistinguishable from our World. The only thing that counts in the definition of worlds are the values of the dimensionless constants of Nature. If all masses were doubled in value you cannot tell, because all the pure numbers defined by the ratios of any pair of masses are unchanged.\\" Natural units are systems of units entirely based in fundamental constants. In such systems, it is meaningful to measure any specific quantity which is not used in the definition of units. For example, in Stoney units, the elementary charge is set to while the reduced Planck constant is subject to measurement, , and in Planck units, the reduced Planck constant is set to , while the elementary charge is subject to measurement, . The 2019 redefinition of SI base units expresses all SI base units in terms of fundamental physical constants, effectively transforming the SI system into a system of natural units. Fine-structure constant In 1999 evidence for time variability of the fine-structure constant based on observation of quasars was announced but a much more precise study based on CH molecules did not find any variation. An upper bound of 10‚àí17per year for the time variation, based on laboratory measurements, was published in 2008. Observations of a quasar of the universe at only 0.8 billion years old with AI analysis method employed on the Very Large Telescope (VLT) found a spatial variation preferred over a no-variation model at the 3.9\\\\sigma level. The time-variation of fine-structure constant is equivalent to the time-variation of one or more of: speed of light, Planck constant, vacuum permittivity, and elementary charge, since \\\\alpha=\\\\frac{e^2}{2\\\\epsilon_0ch}.  Speed of light  Gravitational constant The gravitational constant G is difficult to measure with precision, and conflicting measurements in the 2000s have inspired the controversial suggestions of a periodic variation of its value in a 2015 paper. However, while its value isn't known to great precision, the possibility of observing type Ia supernovae which happened in the universe's remote past, paired with the assumption that the physics involved in these events is universal, allows for an upper bound of less than 10‚àí10 per year for the gravitational constant over the last nine billion years. As a dimensional quantity, the value of the gravitational constant and its possible variation will depend on the choice of units; in Planck units, for example, its value is fixed at by definition. A meaningful test on the time-variation of G would require comparison with a non-gravitational force to obtain a dimensionless quantity, e.g. through the ratio of the gravitational force to the electrostatic force between two electrons, which in turn is related to the dimensionless fine-structure constant. Proton-to-electron mass ratio An upper bound of the change in the proton-to-electron mass ratio has been placed at 10‚àí7 over a period of 7 billion years (or 10‚àí16 per year) in a 2012 study based on the observation of methanol in a distant galaxy. Cosmological constant The cosmological constant is a measure of the energy density of the vacuum. It was first measured, and found to have a positive value, in the 1990s. It is currently (as of 2015) estimated at 10‚àí122 in Planck units.Collaboration, Planck, PAR Ade, N Aghanim, C Armitage-Caplan, M Arnaud, et al., Planck 2015 results. XIII. Cosmological parameters. arXiv preprint 1502.1589v2 , 6 Feb 2015. John D.

It was released on May 11, 2016, as their 10th single under Warner Music Japan and 13th single overall in Japan. The song was written by lead vocalist Jung Yong-hwa. Revolving around the theme of a wedding, \\"Puzzle\\" deals with the idea of \\"eternal love\\". The single was released in four editions: Regular Edition, Limited Editions A and B, and a fan club-only Boice Limited Edition. \\"Puzzle\\" debuted on the weekly Oricon Singles Chart at number four and has sold over 30,000 copies since its release. The band embarked on the CNBLUE Spring Live 2016 \\"We're Like a Puzzle\\" arena tour, where they held four concerts in Aichi, Tokyo, and Osaka. Background Due to the band's fifth anniversary since its major-label debut in Japan, Jung took interest in composing a song about marriage. With the idea of making a \\"flashy\\" lead single, he decided to write a \\"catchy\\" track. In crafting the song, Jung sought to create \\"pop melodies and lyrics with a story, but also linked to the visual, such as a CD jacket and music video\\". \\"Puzzle\\" was announced as CNBLUE's 10th single on March 6, 2016, with a release date of May 11. It serves as commemoration for the band's major-label debut five years prior. Composition \\"Puzzle\\" was written by vocalist Jung Yong-hwa, and Japanese-language translations were provided by Hasegawa. The song was composed by Jung, Han Seung-hoon, and Ko Jin-yeong; it was arranged by the latter two. Described as a \\"bright\\" alternative rock and synthpop track, it is the band's first wedding-themed song; the lyrics revolves around \\"eternal love\\". He described the arrangement of the song as being \\"60% upper band sound and 40% dance music\\". The single was accompanied by two coupling tracks. \\"Take Me Higher\\" was written by Jung and Takashi Ogawa. Likewise, the song was composed by Jung, Han, and Ko; it was arranged by Shogo Ohnishi. Lyrically, the songs conveys the band's sentiment of exceeding its potential. \\"Be My Lover\\" was written by Lee Jong-hyun, who also composed the track alongside Kim Jae-yang and Park Hyun-woo; it was arranged by the latter two. Additional guitars were provided by Lee Tae-wook and Park, and additional bass provided by Ko. In order to express its \\"poetic sentiment\\", the song is sung entirely in English to capture the \\"emotions, feelings, and delicate nuances\\" of the lyrics. All three songs were recorded in Seoul at the FNC Entertainment Studio. Release and promotion The music video for \\"Puzzle\\" was scheduled to be broadcast on TBS Television's variety show ≈åsama no Brunch () on April 16, but was postponed following the Kumamoto earthquake earlier that day. Instead, a 90-second preview was released on Yahoo! Japan's video on demand service GyaO later that day. The full music video was uploaded onto YouTube two days later.

Four possible structures exist depending on the relative positions of the heteroatoms; these forms do not interconvert and hence are structural isomers and not tautomers.

Thirty-five officers and men of the Philippine Army were killed by elements of the Moro National Liberation Front under Usman Sali. Among the dead were Brigadier General Teodulfo Bautista, commanding general of the 1st Infantry Division, Adjutant General of the Armed Forces of the Philippines, Col. Gabriel Pangilinan and four lieutenant colonels. The massacre Usman Sali, the leader of a group of MNLF rebels, had earlier agreed to meet with Gen. Bautista at the headquarters of the 1st Infantry \\"Tabak\\" Division in Jolo for a peace dialogue. At the last minute, Sali changed his mind and proposed to meet Gen. Bautista at a public market in Barangay Danag, Patikul. Bautista agreed and on the way to Patikul, was accompanied by Col. Gabriel Pangilinan, his classmate at the Philippine Military Academy. Earlier, Bautista had invited Fidel V. Ramos, then Chief of the Philippine Constabulary to join him but the latter demurred due to a previous engagement in Zamboanga City. When the General and his troops arrived at the market aboard two army trucks, the place was deserted. Sali was not there to meet Bautista, so the General and his men sat down at a table to await his arrival. At that point gunfire broke out and Bautista and his men were mowed down. The bodies were later found to have sustained hack wounds. All of the Army soldiers died, except for a sergeant, the group's radioman, who survived by playing dead. Although some reports indicate that Usman Sali died during subsequent government operations, others state that he escaped to Sabah, Malaysia after the incident. Memorials Then-president Ferdinand Marcos, in his eulogy to the fallen, stated that Gen. Bautista and his men were \\"killed with perfidy and treachery\\", and that the massacre \\"conclusively brands the MNLF as the violator of the ceasefire agreement\\". In 2012, Bautista's son, then-Commanding General of the Philippine Army Emmanuel T. Bautista inaugurated a museum in Camp General Teodulfo Bautista in Barangay Busbus, Jolo. The Army camp is named in honor of his late father. A stone memorial to those killed was restored in 2009 by the Philippine Marine Corps, Joint Special Operations Task Force-Philippines, and residents of Barangay Danag.

The internal CPU logic was synchronised to even and odd clock signals and special signals generated via the microinstruction diode boards. The memory logic had slow and fast loops to speed the transfer of sequential data bursts. Its microinstructions were programmed on diode boards. A facility was provided to microstep through instructions to help with fault-finding. Processor status bits were provided with machine instructions being decoded from 6 bits in the current address memory word. Double word data had the MSB designated a sign bit coded as binary fractions ( -1 to +1) for the square root, multiply and divide instructions. The instruction set had the usual functions based on three registers named A, B and D (C was the current address in memory register, M).

The IUMSWA was first organised at the New York Shipbuilding Corporation shipyard in Camden, New Jersey. From here it slowly spread to a number of other private shipyards in the Northeast, gaining representation at the Staten Island shipyard in 1936 and the Federal Shipyard in 1937, as well as a range of other smaller ship repair yards in the New York area. The IUMSWA's industrial coverage of all production workers in the shipbuilding industry brought it into conflict with established craft unions, such as the boilermakers, leading the IUMSWA to be refused an AFL charter in 1933. The IUMSWA later joined the Congress of Industrial Organisations in 1936. In 1940, the membership was about 100,000. IUMSWA gained size and strength during the World War II shipbuilding effort, and membership reached about 250,000. IUMSWA Local 15 signed a contract on May 15, 1941 covering workers at Bethlehem Steel Corporation's shipyard in Hoboken, New Jersey. This ended the company's policy of an open shop in shipbuilding, and was an important step towards the Steel Workers Organizing Committee (SWOC-CIO)'s success in the organizing the workers in Bethlehem's steel manufacturing plants. The membership of the union declined after the war ended. In the 1970s and 1980s, the union was known for its efforts in worker health and safety.

She was the founding editor of the British edition of the French magazine Elle in 1985. Early life She was born in Brunei, on the island of Borneo, the daughter of Pamela and Roy Brampton; her father was a manager for oil firm Shell. Brampton was the middle child with an elder and younger brother. Her father's job meant that the family's existence was nomadic with periods living in many countries. In all she attended twelve schools, among which were a school in Rio de Janeiro, Ashford School in Kent, where she boarded, and St Clare‚Äôs Hall School in Oxford. After leaving school, she studied fashion at Saint Martin's School of Art. After winning a competition, Brampton joined Vogue in 1978, and then became the fashion editor of The Observer in 1981. Launch editor of British Elle Brampton was appointed the first editor of the British edition of the French magazine Elle which published its first issue in November 1985. \\"There was a whole new generation [of women] fumbling its way towards tomorrow\\", she said later. \\"Elle was the first mainstream magazine to act as a voice for that generation.\\" It was aimed at professional women with an interest in fashion and shopping, rather than emotions and personal relationship concerns of other titles. The writers Jeanette Winterson, Julie Burchill and Tony Parsons were among those who contributed to Elle under Brampton's stewardship. By this time, she had become a close friend of the designer Jasper Conran. Soon after Elles launch in Britain, Naomi Campbell then not yet 16, was spotted in Covent Garden by a talent scout, and Elles use of Campbell as a cover model in April 1986 helped to launch her career. Brampton opposed using models who were underweight. The word \\"diet\\" was banished and she ran features on \\"healthy eating plans\\" instead. After clashes with the publisher of the magazine, Hachette, Brampton left the company in 1989 to develop her career as a novelist and freelance writer. Management changed frequently and she had tired of the early mornings. Later life and career Brampton was appointed as the editor of Red magazine in November 1999. Red was then a fairly new title, which had launched in January 1998. It was thought at the time that Brampton had been appointed to the post to position the title for women over the age of 40. She remained in the post for about a year. At the time she was sacked in October 2000, it was asserted that her decision to run political articles, including interviews with Prime Minister Tony Blair and government minister Mo Mowlam had led to a decline in circulation. By January 2001, she had been diagnosed as suffering from clinical depression. A memoir, Shoot the Damn Dog (2008), a partial reference to Churchill's description of his depression as a \\"black dog\\", recounts Brampton's experience of the condition and periods as an in-patient. The journalist Simon Garfield, writing for The Observer commented that \\"her story is compelling and unflinching and she makes no claims that her descent and slow recovery will match those of others\\". From 2006, she was an agony aunt for The Sunday Times Style supplement; her advice column called Aunt Sally was discontinued by the paper in 2014. After this she wrote a similar column for the Daily Mail. In this period, she also wrote for the women's magazine Psychologies and the gardening title Easy Living; she was a keen gardener. Her novels were Good Grief (1992), Lovesick, Concerning Lily, and Love, Always (2000). Personal life Brampton married and divorced three times. She was briefly married to the television and film director Nigel Cole, whose best known film is Calendar Girls (2003). Her second marriage was to the television producer and executive Jonathan Powell in 1990; the couple had a daughter, Molly, who now works in publishing. The marriage ended around 2000. Her third husband was Tom Wnek, who has been employed in ethical marketing. Brampton moved to St Leonards, East Sussex from London in 2010, after separating from her third husband. Death It is believed Brampton killed herself by \\"walk[ing] into the sea at St Leonards\\" on 10 May 2016. A spokesman for Sussex Police said there were no \\"suspicious circumstances\\". A letter from Brampton's psychiatrist, dated from 18th March 2016, stated that she was \\"in crisis\\" and that she had \\"disengaged\\" from local services and had \\"painted a very jaundiced view of them\\". Her former husband, Nigel Cole, said he was \\"devastated\\" to hear his ex-wife had \\"lost her battle with depression\\". The inquest into her death agreed that it was her own choice to enter the sea, but said that the health services had \\"missed opportunities\\" to help her, describing several occasions when she approached doctors but was not helped appropriately. The editor-in-chief of Elle at the time Brampton died, Lorraine Candy, wrote on the magazine's website that the magazine Brampton developed was a \\"breath of fresh air, mixing high street with high end, having a brave and sometimes contrary opinion, questioning the norm and championing new thinkers.\\" Candy also wrote, \\"Smart, tough and stylish, Sally [Brampton] was also elegantly charming. She was a gentlewoman in the truest sense of the word, an Editor-in-Chief who discovered and nurtured new talent with the same enthusiasm as she nurtured her family and friends.\\" References External links * Official website Category:1955 births Category:2016 deaths Category:Suicides by drowning in England Category:British magazine editors Category:British women journalists Category:People educated at Ashford School Category:People educated at St. Clare's, Oxford Category:Alumni of Saint Martin's School of Art Category:British Vogue Category:The Observer people Category:Elle (magazine) writers Category:Women magazine editors Category:Suicide in 2016 ","title":"Sally Brampton"},{"id":"50520042","text":"Belley is a commune in Eastern France.

It is the largest saltflat on the north-east coast, located on the south bank of the River Aln estuary, and notable for the varied plant community found on the interface between the saltflats and the dunes. It overlaps with and forms part of the much larger Northumberland Shore SSSI. Location and natural features Alnmouth Saltmarsh and Dunes is situated in the north-east of England at Alnmouth, a village at the mouth of the River Aln where it empties into the North Sea on the east coast. The site covers the south bank of the estuary from a point due west of the village, and follows the coast south for about to Buston Links, east of High Buston. Warkworth Dunes and Saltmarsh SSSI is immediately to the south, and both fall within the scope of the Northumberland Shore SSSI. The site extends to and covers estuarine saltflats and a single ridge of dune extending south from the river mouth. Alnmouth's saltmarsh owes its origins to a shift in the course of the river which occurred in 1806. Before that time, the river passed to the west of Church Hill at the north-west end of the large single sandbank immediately to the south of the estuary, taking an oxbow course around the hill to discharge slightly south of today's river. A violent storm on Christmas Day in that year allowed the river to break through the northern extent of the sandbank to assume its current course - in the process cutting off and destroying the remains of the village's Church of St. Waleric, which stood at the northern end of the sandbank. The river's previous course became silt- filled, forming much of the saltmarsh now of scientific interest. =Vegetation= The saltmarsh is ungrazed and is dominated by sea-purslane (Halimione portulacoides) and by the most northerly British colony of the seaweeds Bostrychia scorpioides, Fucus vesiculosus and Pelvetia canaliculata. Higher levels of the marsh support thrift (Armeria maritima), common saltmarsh-grass (Puccinellia maritima), sea-plantain (Plantago maritima) and sea aster (Aster tripolium) associated with the sea-purslane. Much of the intertidal mud has been colonised by common cord-grass (Spartina anglica), but open areas and saltmarsh creeks are used by feeding and roosting gulls, dunlin and other waders including redshank, curlew and snipe. Common reed (Phragmites australis) and three locally rare species, sea rush (Juncus maritimus), parsley water-dropwort (Oenanthe lachenalii) and slender spike-rush (Eleocharis uniglumis) are found at the freshwater inflow area of the marsh. A distinct habitat is provided by the interface between saltmarsh and dune and supports reflexed saltmarsh grass (Puccinellia distans), hard-grass (Parapholis strigosa) and sea-milkwort (Glaux maritima). The dune ridge supports marram (Ammophila arenaria), and lesser meadow-rue (Thalictrum minus) with bloody crane's-bill (Geranium sanguineum) and hound's-tongue (Cynoglossum officinale). Bracken (Pteridium aquilinum) is found on the lower landward slopes. The site extends to areas of shorter turf, which supports cowslip (Primula veris), early-purple orchid (Orchis mascula), violets (Viola spp.), and yarrow (Achillea millefolium), with widespread early forget-me-not (Myosotis ramosissima), common cornsalad (Valerianella locusta), hairy tare (Vicia hirsuta), and crosswort (Galium cruciata). A further distinctive habitat is provided by an area of gravel exposed by historic sand extraction, and on which grows wild thyme (Thymus praecox), common stork's-bill (Erodium cicutarium), mouse-ear hawkweed (Hieracium pilosella) and common centaury (Centaurium erythraea) together with common bird's-foot trefoil (Lotus corniculatus), common restharrow (Ononis repens), blue fleabane (Erigeron acer), crested hair-grass (Koeleria macrantha) and fern-grass (Desmazeria rigida). The margin of this area supports viper's-bugloss (Echium vulgare) and bloody crane's-bill. =Condition= The site is divided into four units for SSSI management purposes. The condition of all was rated \\"favourable\\" in 2007 (units 1 & 2) and 2009 (units 3 & 4). Ownership The site is owned by Northumberland Estates, the estate company of Ralph Percy, 12th Duke of Northumberland, and is leased to the National Trust.

Kov√°cs (Bonn, 2013), p. 74 His life is known primarily through inscriptions.Most notably, Biography The son of Lucius and a member of the Roman tribe Camilia, Carus' career began with his appointment to the decemviri stlitibus judicandis, one of the four boards of the vigintiviri; membership in one of these four boards was a preliminary and required first step toward gaining entry into the Roman Senate. This was followed by serving as a military tribune, firstly of the Legio VIII Augusta, at the time stationed at Argentoratum (Strasbourg), then of the Legio IX Hispana, sometime after AD 122.Cowan, R. Roman Legionary AD 69-161 (2013), p. 10 Returning to Rome, Carus began his climb up the series of Republican magistracies: first appointed quaestor to the Emperor, then Plebeian Tribune before achieving the Praetorship. Returning to the military sphere, Carus was granted the rank of Legatus legionis, commanding the Legio XXX Ulpia Victrix. Anthony Birley notes this was unusual assignment, for Legio XXX and Legio IX were both stationed in the same province, Germania Inferior, and men were rarely assigned command of a legion in the same army as they had held a tribunate; Birley could only list 14 men with that distinction.Birley, The Fasti of Roman Britain, (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1981), pp. 17f He returned to civilian life, serving as curator of the Via Flaminia. His next assignment was as Legatus Augusti pro praetore (or governor) of the Roman province of Arabia Petraea from AD 142 to 143. In 144, he was appointed suffect consul, and this was followed up with an appointment as imperial censitor of Gallia Lugdunensis. Finally, Carus was made Legatus Augusti pro praetore, or governor, of Cappadocia. Carus was a member of the Quindecimviri sacris faciundis, the collegium of Roman priests entrusted with the care of the Sibylline oracles, and the sodales Flaviales, a less prominent collegium.  Family  Carus' son, also named Lucius Aemilius Carus, was Legatus Augusti pro praetore of the province of Tres Daciae in AD 174/175, and suffect consul at some point between 170 and 175.G√©za Alf√∂ldy, Konsulat und Senatorenstand unter der Antoninen (Bonn: Rudolf Habelt Verlag, 1977), p. 224 and note Sources * Campbell, Brian.

It was pioneered in the late 1960s and early 1970s by acts like Sly and the Family Stone, Jimi Hendrix, and the Parliament-Funkadelic collective. It would influence subsequent styles including '70s jazz fusion and the '90s West Coast hip hop style G-funk. George Clinton performs with Parliament-Funkadelic in 2007. History Following the late 1960s work of Jimi Hendrix, the music and drug culture of psychedelia began to have a widespread impact on African American soul and funk musicians.\\"Psychedelic soul\\", Allmusic, retrieved 27 February 2017. Black funk artists such as Sly and the Family Stone borrowed techniques from psychedelic rock music, including wah pedals, fuzz boxes, echo chambers, and vocal distorters. Producer Norman Whitfield would draw on this sound on popular Motown recordings such as The Temptations' \\"Cloud Nine\\" and Marvin Gaye's \\"I Heard It Through the Grapevine.\\" In 1970, Hendrix formed the short-lived trio Band of Gypsys, described as \\"ground zero\\" for psychedelic funk. By the early 1970s, the main elements of psychedelic funk were adopted as signifiers of \\"urban blackness\\" and incorporated into blaxploitation films. In the 1970s, groups such as Parliament-Funkadelic developed this sensibility, employing synthesizers and acid rock-oriented guitar work into open-ended funk jams. Led by George Clinton, P-Funk would shift the genre away from song-form and toward groove and texture, emphasizing the abject elements of psychedelia in contrast to earlier artists, according to theorist Kodwo Eshun. The 1970s group War (with singer Eric Burdon) recorded in a psychedelic funk-rock style featuring prominent rhythm and horn sections, bass lines, and drum breaks, as well as lyrics protesting racism and police brutality. The 1974 album Inspiration Information by Shuggie Otis explored psychedelic funk and later received acclaim when it was reissued by David Byrne's Luaka Bop label. West African groups such as Blo and Orchestre Poly-Rythmo de Cotonou played forms of psychedelic funk in the mid 1970s, both drawing on the Afrobeat of Nigerian musician Fela Kuti. A collection of 1970s psychedelic funk recordings from Ghana and Togo was released in 2010 as Afro-Beat Airways: West African Shock Waves by the Analog Africa label. Music from Nigeria's 1970s psychedelic funk scene was later documented on the compilation Wake Up You! The Rise & Fall of Nigerian Rock 1972-1977, released in 2016. Influence In the early 1970s, jazz artists such as Miles Davis and Herbie Hancock combined elements of psychedelic funk with urban jazz to pioneer jazz fusion. New wave band Talking Heads explored psychedelic funk, influenced by George Clinton, on a trilogy of acclaimed albums in the late 1970s. Subsequent artists would be influenced by the style including Prince. In the 1990s, the popular psychedelic funk style known as G-funk emerged from the West Coast hip hop scene, represented by Warren G, Dr. Dre, and Snoop Dogg. Many G-funk recordings sampled tracks by earlier psychedelic funk bands, most prominently Parliament-Funkadelic. The 1990s hip hop duo OutKast were also influenced by black psychedelic musicians such as Sly Stone and Clinton. Examples of psychedelic funk from world music scenes have been collected on compilations issued on the World Psychedelic Funk Classics label.All Music Various Artists, Psych-Funk Sa-Re-Ga!

Synopsis The film's original premise was to address the life of Julian Assange, documenting scenes showing \\"motives and contradictions of Assange and his inner circle\\", focusing on the risks taken by persons involved in the well-known Wikileaks website, the most notable risk being taken by Assange himself. The documentary begins in 2010, addressing Assange's worldwide persecution by the United States, and the extreme judicial measures he came to face on the part of the Swedish judicial authorities, which sought his extradition from the U.K. in 2012. Assange alleges that any such Swedish extradition would have culminated in an eventual extradition to the United States. The opening scene shows Assange (with Wikileaks staffer Sarah Harrison) calling the U.S. State Department, asking them to step-up security procedures, so as to make clear that the document-loss was not an intentional act of damage to the United States by Wikileaks/Assange. This segues into a presentation of Assange's angst about the fate of Chelsea Manning and Assange's plans to avoid U.S. capture. The film then presents documentation of Assange's asylum claim, and the disguising of himself to sneak into the Embassy of Ecuador in London for refuge. Originally titled \\"Asylum\\", the film becomes a journey into the perception of Poitras, who, in the re-cut of the film, altered the film's focus on the experience of risk- taking media work (Assange's as well as her own), towards a critique of Assange as a flawed character under attack, including for his alleged mistreatment of women. In the 2016 version of the film, Poitras presents a more sympathetic position towards Assange, drawing parallels between her own U.S. persecution for filmmaking with Assange's persecution for publication of leaked official documents. The 2017 re-cut version focuses more on Assange's responses to accusations against him. One apparent trigger for the change of heart for Poitras appears to be her affair and subsequent disappointment with Assange friend and Wikileaks supporter Jacob Appelbaum. In mid-2016, directly after the Cannes screening, Appelbaum was publicly accused of abusing women while working with Wikileaks and serving as a computer security activist at Tor. The film crosses lines at one point from being a documentary to a cin√©ma v√©rit√©, when Poitras admits in a voice-over her personal disappointment with Appelbaum, and her anger at Appelbaum's alleged abuse of one of her friends. In interviews, Poitras claimed that it was Julian Assange's frantic attempts to reason with her about the pre-Cannes cut, citing that his lawyers contacted her directly before the Cannes. Poitras said that Assange sent her an SMS message calling these scenes a \\"threat to his freedom\\". According to Poitras, this was what led her to refocus on the same accusations, to add the Appelbaum story to the film, and to change the overall message of the film. The film touches briefly on the role played by Wikileaks in the 2016 U.S. election. Cast * Jacob Appelbaum * Laura Poitras * Julian Assange * Sarah Harrison * Lady Gaga Reception Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes collected 94 reviews with an average rating of 7/10 , of which 82% were positive. The website's critical consensus states: \\"Risk poses knotty questions regarding documentary filmmaking ethics, but remains consistently compelling despite its flaws.\\" Metacritic gave the film a score of 72 out of 100 based on 25 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Some reviewers highlighted Poitras' personal entanglement in the story, for her affair with Appelbaum. The film drew only $145,000 in box office remittances, a sharp drop from the $3 million earned by Citizenfour, Poitras' documentary about Edward Snowden.

After a Dano-Norwegian assault on northern Bohusl√§n, ships under the command of Peter Tordenskjold attacked the Swedes at Marstrand harbor and the immobile ships of the Swedish Gothenburg Fleet. The Danes subsequently attacked Carlsten fortress, whose garrison surrendered swiftly, partly because of psychological warfare. The commander of the fortress, Colonel Henrich Danckwardt, was later sentenced to death by a Swedish court-martial for abandoning the fort while it was still deemed defensible. The surrender of Carlsten fortress in 1719 is still surrounded by myths and legends.  Background  After the death of Charles XII of Sweden on November 30, 1718 at Fredriksten fortress in Norway, the Swedish army marched back across the border to Sweden. The Great Northern War which had been fought continuously since 1700, had depleted fighting forces on both sides. As the Russian Pillage of Sweden posed a threat to Sweden's eastern seaboard, a large part of the Swedish Navy was operating in the Baltic Sea. Denmark-Norway, seeing this as an opportunity, put plans into motion to retake lost territories on the Swedish west coast. There were also plans for a naval and land invasion of Bohusl√§n. The Swedish vessels which had previously been stationed in Gothenburg, the Gothenburg Squadron, had been attacked by Peter Tordenskjold's fleet in 1717 and had been ordered by Charles XII to remain scattered along the Bohusl√§n coast. A majority of the squadron was stationed in Marstrand by the Spring of 1719, and a few smaller ships were located near Str√∂mstad. A couple of smaller vessels escorted transports between Gothenburg and Marstrand on the Nordre River, leaving a single galley to defend Gothenburg. The frigates at Marstrand were not operational, due to a lack of sailors and of food and equipment for the crews. Maintenance of the fortresses was handled poorly and in early 1719, local fortification experts complained over not getting paid for a long time. Similar concerns were raised by the naval officers' corps and the carpenters of Gothenburg. = Blockade and rearmament = Danish map of the area between Gothenburg and Marstrand in the spring of 1719. Kalvsund and Riv√∂ bay are blockaded by Danish naval forces. Merchant vessels near Klippan and Stigberget are unable to get out. Frigates of the Swedish Gothenburg Squadron are immobile and unequipped in Marstrand. A few smaller vessels are acting as sentries near Kippholmen in the mouth of Nordre river. Depth is specified in famnar or Danish feet (fod). At the time, Swedish privateers headquartered in Gothenburg were hijacking foreign vessels. This irritated Dano-Norwegian authorities, so on March 27, a Dano-Norwegian naval force, consisting of four ships of the line and a frigate, anchored in Riv√∂ Bay outside of Gothenburg, blockading the city. The blockading force was under the command of Tordenskjold, who had recently been promoted to the lower admiral rank of schout-bij-nacht. To avoid endangering the peace conference that was to take place in Stockholm in the spring, Tordenskjold was ordered not to assault Gothenburg. In early June, the blockading naval force increased to seven ships of the line, two frigates, four barges, two floating batteries, one bombarderskip, five galleys and two Galliots. The smaller Danish vessels attempted to halt Swedish naval traffic between Nordre river and Marstrand. In mid-June, an additional 26 Danish merchant ships arrived from √òresund with supplies for the Danish blockading fleet. The stockpiling of supplies in Str√∂mstad in 1718 for Charles XII's army had resulted in the need for emptying the existing supply caches ‚Äì which were filled to the brim ‚Äì as quickly as possible. Many Swedish naval transports with cannons and supplies were moved to Sundsborg and Svinesund south towards Uddevalla. The removal of vital supplies caused the defense of northern Bohusl√§n to falter. By the end of May, a convoy of transport vessels had docked at Marstrand for transshipment to more capable vessels, where the cargo rerouted for further transport through Nordre river. A part of the convoy later returned to Str√∂mstad. On May 23, Field Marshal Carl Gustav Rehnski√∂ld took command of Swedish troops in Bohusl√§n. Following an inspection in May, it was deemed that fortifications needed repair in several locations around the region. The strong Danish blockade outside Gothenburg, with an estimated force of 1,300 soldiers and several special-purpose vessels for bombarding coastal defense positions, implied that the Danes were to attack either Marstrand or √Ñlvsborg fortress. Captain Erik Sj√∂blad of the Gothenburg Squadron was ordered to moor all frigates and galleys to defend the harbor inlets. Rehnski√∂ld later gave the order to sink all anchored Swedish ships. = Assault on Str√∂mstad = Bohus, V√§nersborg and Marstrand. Drawn by Johann Baptist Homann. The peace talks in Stockholm failed, and King Frederick IV of Denmark ordered his troops to attack Sweden. Frederick IV had over 30,000 soldiers available in southern Norway, along with an attack force which would attack Str√∂mstad from the north. A naval force with 8,000 soldiers was to invade Hisingen. The Swedish transport ships in Str√∂mstad could not vacate Str√∂mstad before Danish Vice Admiral Andreas Rosenpalm blockaded the only way out with a naval force of at least three frigates and four galleys at the end of June. After Rehnski√∂ld and the commander of the Gothenburg Squadron, Admiral Jonas Fredrik √ñrnfelt, had assessed the situation and had received intelligence that Norwegian forces were indeed marching towards Str√∂mstad, the order was given to scuttle the transport fleet. Several Swedish galleys and a smaller vessel attempted to slip out of the area at night through an inner channel but this route was blockaded as well. The Gothenburg squadron's galleys Kristiania, Lovisa and Bellona, along with the brig Pollux, were all sunk at T√•nge Bay and T√•ngeflo south of Str√∂mstad on July 5. The Str√∂mstad and G√• P√•, equipped with 20 cannons each, were also sunk, along with fourteen fully loaded cargo ships in Str√∂mstad harbor. All remaining caches were opened, so that both civilians and military could take what they could, and the remains were then destroyed. Afterwards, Swedish troops under the command of Rehnski√∂ld totalling around 5,000 ‚Äì including the garrisons at the fortifications of Gothenburg, Nya √Ñlvsborg and Carlsten ‚Äì started south towards Uddevalla. The first Danish troops arrived in Str√∂mstad between July 6 and July 8. Frederick IV later arrived along with additional soldiers. By the end of June, heavy Danish surveillance of the Gothenburg archipelago had been arranged; a force consisting of eight vessels had been deployed between Kl√•ver island and Tjuvkil. Since the vessels were attempting to halt naval traffic between Marstrand and Tjuvkil, and since they were pillaging the archipelago, the Swedes found it highly probable that Tordenskjold was planning to attack Marstrand. The Swedes performed a counter-attack against the Danish blockaders on the night of July 3, when the Swedish galley Lucretia and the brigantines Luren, Uppassaren and Framfuss from Kippholmen in the mouth of Nordre river, managed to creep down Hisingen and get past the Danish reconnaissance fleet without being spotted. The Danish galley Prins Kristian, armed with 9 cannons, was attacked and hijacked at Riv√∂'s mouth.  Battle of Marstrand  = Friday, July 10 = Marstrand island, present-day, as seen in a helicopter view from the north-east over Ko√∂n. In the first week of July, Tordenskjold scrambled an attack force which he planned to use in his assault on Marstrand. On July 10, the attack began. In the afternoon, the Carlsten fortress garrison reported seeing at least 18 Danish vessels. Tordenskjold had left ships of the line and frigates outside of Gothenburg and the attack force at Marstrand consisted partly of barges armed with cannons and mortars, and galleys with an additional 50 soldiers aboard each ship. Between 600 and 700 soldiers landed at Metsund on the east side of the undefended Ko√∂n, east of Marstrand. At the same time, 12 heavy mortars were being transported to the west side of the island. Only the far western part of the island could be bombarded from the fortress. Colonel Henrich Danckwardt, commander of Carlsten had on June 27 requested an additional 400‚Äì500 men, to prevent an invasion of Ko√∂n and Kl√•ver√∂n (south of Marstrand) but the soldiers had not arrived in time to repel Tordenskjold's attack. The Danish tactic of landing on the east side of Ko√∂n was virtually the same as the leading General of Norway, Ulrik Frederik Gyldenl√∏ve, had used when he occupied Marstrand and Carlsten at the Battle of Marstrand in July 1677. = Saturday, July 11 = The galley Prins Fredrik of Hessen (T) and the barge Ge P√• (V) defending the outwork Hedvigsholm from Danish attack. (N) is the sunken frigate Halmstad, and (P) is a sunken burner. Existing and planned fortifications around Marstrand, 1709. In the morning, heavy barrages were fired from the new Danish artillery stationed at Ko√∂n, at Carlsten fortress. Tordenskjold describes in one of his later writings of the new artillery station being heavily fired upon by three Swedish galleys, a barge and three other vessels. He also describes that the Danes were fired upon from Carlsten and its southern outworks. From 6‚Äì7 p.m., the cannon fire from Hedvigsholm outwork, which was placed on an island near Ko√∂n, consisted of four 36-pounder, two 12-pounder and two 6-pounder cannons. Hedvigsholm was only staffed with twelve men under the command of a non-commissioned officer. When the NCO realized that he would not be able to hold the fortress due to the heavy incoming fire, he sent word to Danckwardt about the situation. Squadron chief Sj√∂blad decided that the Hedvigsholm battery should be destroyed, to prevent the cannon falling into enemy hands. Danckwardt dispatched Lieutenant Breittenberg to destroy the cannon. Upon his arrival, Breittenberg found that both the Hedvigsholm garrison and the cannon were unharmed, but decided to carry on with his mission. When the Danes noticed that the battery fire from Hedvigsholm had ceased, they started firing upon the Swedish naval vessels in the harbor and managed to sink the vessel which was carrying the crew and ammunition of Hedvigsholm ‚Äì around seven barrels of gunpowder ‚Äì to the fortress. After the events in Marstrand, a military hearing was held at the end of July 1719 with commander Danckwardt. Upon being asked why he had not ordered additional manpower to Hedvigsholm, which was considered the strongest and most effective battery to defend the town, which was also being supported by the galley Prins Fredrik av Hessen, Danckwardt defended his actions by arguing that if he had not destroyed Hedvigsholm, the outwork would have been captured, regardless of its number of personnel. He also pointed out that the enemy would have been able to wade between Ko√∂n and Hedvigsholm, something the hearing officials did not agree with. = Sunday, July 12 = Carlsten fortress as seen from the north-east. Part of Danish situational map, 1719. On Saturday night, another Danish cannon battery had been constructed, even closer to Carlsten and the northern river inlet. It was equipped with four 100-pounder mortars and between thirty and forty lighter mortars. Tordenskjold had also planned on using ten 24-pounder cannon but this was prevented by officers responsible for fortifications and the artillery. These officers had been brought on the ships but were not under Tordenskjolds command. They believed that the battery was unsafe, and refused to hand over the cannon. Fascines and other supplies necessary to produce the battery were not available, according to army officers. Tordenskjold then ordered a fahnenjunkers and nine gunners under his command, together with additional manpower from the ships, to build the battery. The heavy mortars were carried from the northern side of Ko√∂n to the new battery. When it was considered ready, Tordenskjold ordered a barrage against Carlsten, which had little effect on the fortress. Even though Tordenskjold had Swedish naval vessels in his firing range, he avoided firing against them in order to attempt to capture them unharmed.  Marstrand falls  View of a location north of the Antonetta battery on Marstrand island. On the right side, the lobed west side of Ko√∂n is visible, and on the horizon, southern Tj√∂rn. From 7‚Äì8:00 a.m., the first negotiator was dispatched to Marstrand, Danish Captain-Lieutenant Conrad Ployart who was sailing towards the northern outwork Antonetta ‚Äì which was guarding the northern inlet ‚Äì in a sloop with a clearly visible white flag. A Swedish sloop carrying a Lieutenant Br√§nn√∂ was sent to meet with the Danish vessel half-way. Ployart demanded access to the fortress but was told that he should speak with the commander, \\"His excellency\\" Field Marshal Rehnski√∂ld, if he wanted anything. The Danish officer lamented the fact that he could not meet the commander in person and added that if there were any women present in the fortress, they would immediately be given the chance to leave. Ployart had also received orders to offer the Swedes a deal, the Swedes would have to hand over six naval vessels in exchange for the Danes not firing at Marstrand. The Swedes rejected the offer. Danish forces attacking Marstrand After Ployart had returned with the Swedes' rejection, Tordenskjold mounted an assault on the vessels and outworks which were defending the northern harbor inlet. The artillery galiot Johannes and the mortar barge Lange Maren fired the first rounds. Two barges, the Hj√¶lperinden and the Fredrikshald were in reserve. The Swedish outworks consisted of Antonetta ‚Äì equipped with four 6-pounder cannons and a crew of seven ‚Äì and the Northern Blockhouse, a smaller outwork equipped with two 36-pounder guns. Captain Sj√∂blad had stationed an additional three cannons close to the Northern Blockhouse, which were served by 15 men. The outworks did not have enough ammunition and were commanded by NCOs. After firing at the outworks, with the help of a galley and eight sloops, 200‚Äì300 Danish soldiers were landed on Marstrand island and close to Antonetta. After the Swedes had returned fire against the landing force, its guns were spiked and the crews retreated to Carlsten. The Northern Blockhouse suffered the same fate and so the Danes, commanded by Captains Kaas and Kleve, could rapidly enter the city. In the harbor, the Swedish frigate Kalmar and the galley Greve M√∂rner continued to defend the northern inlet until the Danish troops eventually entered the city. At the war hearing, Danckwardt was asked why he had not contributed more to the defense of the northern inlet outworks. The two outworks could have defended each other by cross fire and he could have sent one of the seven professional officers from Carlsten to act as a commander. Danckwardt defended himself by saying that he could not afford to send away even more personnel from Carlsten and that the men would have been cut off if the outworks were conquered.  Sinking of the Swedish fleet  Detailed Danish situational map of placements of navy vessels and defensive structures on and around Kl√•ver√∂n, Ko√∂n and Marstrand island, after the sinking of the Gothenburg Squadron in 1719. At the same time as the Danes were storming into the city, Danish sloops were sailing towards the Swedish vessels in the harbor. Since the Swedish ship crews were understaffed, they realized that they would not be able to survive the imminent battle; their only way of retreat towards Carlsten was being blockaded and the Swedish ships fired their last broadsides. Thereafter, the Swedes fired shots at their own vessels' strakes. grapeshots intended for close-quarters combat. Found at the site of the sunken frigate Fredricus at Marstrand harbor, on exhibit at Bohusl√§n museum in Uddevalla. Most of the ships' crews managed to return safely to Carlsten. The vessels which were sunk were the frigates Halmstad, Stettin and Kalmar, all armed with 40 cannon, as well as Fredricus (36) and Charlotta (30). The galleys St√• Bra and Greve M√∂rner with 9 cannons each, the sloop Diana (4) along with two fire ships were sunk. Tordenskjolds soldiers managed to prevent the sinking of the frigates Varberg (40 cannons) and William Galley (14), the galiot Prins Fredrik av Hessen (9) and the barge Ge P√• (18). William Galley was probably a captured British vessel or possibly a privateer. During the hearing, Danckwardt mentioned that a few volunteers from the ship crews and the garrison had left the fortress to \\"overwhelm the enemy\\" but could not get any further than the castle hill, since enemy soldiers were deployed around Marstrand cemetery, which was close by. The force of volunteers promptly turned back and re-entered the fortress, according to Danckwardt. In the afternoon, firing on Carlsten continued from the mortar batteries on Ko√∂n. A shed which was being used as temporary gunpowder storage was hit and exploded. A fire also broke out on the tower roof and on parts of Fyrkantsbatteriet, an outwork on the eastern side of the fortress, which were put out by fortress personnel. No deaths were reported as a result of the artillery fire but Swedish morale was depressed because of the Danish conquering of their outworks and the sinking of the Swedish fleet. On the night to Monday, Tordenskjold landed 200 soldiers on Marstrand island, 500 men in total. = Monday, July 13 = Detail from Danish map. The Swedish frigate Varberg (g), the galley Prins Fredrik av Hessen (h), and the frigate William Galley (i) are all captured by Danish forces and are escorted to safety east of Ko√∂n, 1719. During the day, only a few rounds were fired from the fortress and none at all from the Danes. Inside the fortress, the commander ordered artillery officers Captain Josias M√∂rck and Lieutenant Graan to burn the city down, the officers stated that they did not have any suitable ammunition. At the hearing, Danckwardt was asked why the retreating outwork crews failed to burn the city down, to which he replied that he was not aware that this could have been done any other way except by firing from the fortress. He also argued that the artillery officers unwillingness was because they had their houses inside the city. Depiction of Carlsten from the south, detail from fortress blueprint, 1716. The Danes transported the captured vessels away from the area, moving up additional mortars and repairing a cannon battery on Ko√∂n, which had sustained fire from the Prins Fredrik av Hessen. Repairs could be done uninterrupted because Carlsten only had one cannon which could reach the battery and this cannon was damaged. The crew of Carlsten consisted of Redv√§g's company from the √Ñlvsborg Regiment with around 100 men and a company from Zengerlein's Saxon Infantry Regiment which had at least 100 men, both units totalling 227 infantrymen. The artillery, under the command of Captain M√∂rck, consisted of 54 men. 107 men were acquired from the ship crews as well, the entire crew consisted of a total of 388 men. The fortress had been heavily expanded since the Danish assault in 1677. This rendered Carlsten one of the most heavily defended fortresses in the country. The fortification of the city of Marstrand and the construction of Carlsten fortress was, and still is, one of the largest investments ever in Swedish static defense. = Tuesday, July 14 = Artillery fire against the fortress continued until 11:00 a.m. In the afternoon, Lieutenant Ployart approached the fortress as a negotiator along with an army drummer and asked the Swedes to be let inside. Blindfolded, Ployart was promptly taken to see the Swedish commander. Ployart handed over a sealed letter written by Tordenskjold. The letter, which consisted of flattery and threats, is preserved today in the Danish National Archives. While Danckwardt was preparing a proper reply to the letter, one of his captains brought another letter from Tordenskjold to his attention. In it, Tordenskjold offered a sum of 3,000 ducats and the mercy of the Danish king, if the Swedes surrendered. According to Danckwardt, he had replied to the second letter, that even if he had been offered 300,000 ducats, he would rather have blown the fortress up, than abandoning it for money. Swedish Captain Jacob von Utfall accompanied Ployart to Tordenskjold later in the day and suggested that an armistice would be appropriate, to which Tordenskjold agreed. Portrait of Peder Tordenskjold from 1720, drawn by Jacob Coning. Oslo Museum. When von Utfall had returned to Carlsten, Danckwardt called all officers to a meeting. The protocol of the meeting was later used as an instrument of surrender. The officers explained the situation, the artillery suffered lack of personnel and bad gun carriages. The supply of food was estimated to be able to sustain them for a month but there was a lack of water. The fortress had next to no combat personnel, the naval crews were deemed not of much use in the case of an ambush, due to their lack of combat training, their sole purpose at the fortress was as a fire brigade. Tordenskjold used this time by placing additional light mortars on suitable locations in Marstrand. = Wednesday, July 15 = The Swedish meeting continued during the morning. Tordenskjold was still preparing an assault by relocating the Danish barges, floating batteries and galleys closer to the fortress. Since the Carlsten garrison was deemed too exhausted to sustain an assault, the Swedes agreed to surrender before the end of the armistice. All of the Swedish officers signed the instrument of surrender which was handed over to the Danes by Captain von Utfall. Quote from the instrument of surrender \\"Hwarf√∂re conjunctim resolverades att En formel Capitulation skall gi√∂ras genom Capitainen von Uthfall i dhe Puncter och Propositioner som det Jnstrumentet ad acta uthwijsar och aparto underskrifwes. Datum Carlsteen d. 15 Julii 1719\\" Danish map of buildings at Ko√∂n and Marstrand island after the sinking of the Swedish Gothenburg Squadron in 1719. After two hours, Utfall returned with the document which had been signed by Tordenskjold. All Swedish forces were instructed to leave the fortress by 3:00 p.m., all officers who wished to return to Marstrand were allowed to do so, without being treated as a prisoner of war. The Swedes were granted an additional two hours, properly to vacate the fortress. At four in the afternoon, Torenskjold arrived at the fortress gate and was promptly let in. Danckwardt met with him and showed him to the commanders quarters, where the other officers had gathered. After a while of conversation, the commander and a number of officers accompanied Tordenskjold to a house in Marstrand, where they all enjoyed red wine. At 9:00 p.m., all men returned to their quarters. The only breach of the peace, was when soldiers from the Saxon regiment along with personnel from the artillery, had broken into a storage facility and stolen the butter supply. The Saxon soldiers were ordered to vacate the city and to spend the night standing outside the fortress wall surrounded by armed Danish soldiers. = Thursday, July 16 = In the morning, all Swedish marched out of the fortress. At around four in the afternoon, the commander left the fortress for a house in Marstrand. At 9:00 p.m., the remaining Swedish soldiers of the infantry and the artillery vacated the fortress. = Friday, July 17 = The Swedish troops were transported to Tjuvkil on the mainland, except for a few troops from the artillery and the Saxon regiment, which were transferred to Danish service. During the transport, Tordenskjold handed out gifts to the officers such as watches and feather fans, along with other goods that had been taken from captured ships. After arriving at Tjuvkil, Danckwardt sent a letter to Field Marshal Rehnski√∂ld in Uddevalla explaining the situation. After reading the letter, Rehnski√∂ld issued an arrest warrant for Danckwardt. Danckwardt was arrested at Bohus fortress when he was attempting to travel to Gothenburg.  Aftermath  Danish blueprint, partly in German, of the conquered fortress Kristiansten in Marstrand, 1719. Scaled in Danish feet. Field Marshal Rehnski√∂ld and his officers were now left with a tough decision: should they stay with the Swedish troops at Uddevalla and protect the roads to V√§nersborg and Dalsland or move south towards Hisingen, to avoid being cut off by the Danish forces which could land north of Gothenburg? Rehnski√∂ld chose to stay, which turned out to be a good decision since the Danish army at Str√∂mstad later pulled back into Norway at the end of August. Tordenskjold used the naval base to attack Nya √Ñlvsborg fortress on July 21 and later Nya Varvet at G√∂ta river mouth. While under Dano-Norwegian rule, Carlsten fortress was named Kristiansten and Norwegian Major General Hartvig Huitfeldt was assigned to command the fortress garrison. On November 12, 1720, after the signing of the Treaty of Frederiksborg, the fortress was returned to Swedish control and was once again renamed Carlsten. On July 22, all officers who had signed the Carlsten instrument of surrender were arrested. After a war hearing with Danckwardt on July 21, a court martial was held on August 27, where he was violently disciplined for his actions. Charles XI's war law ¬ß73 states that any fortress commander that surrenders the fortress to the enemy without being under sufficient distress, shall receive the highest grade of punishment. On September 5, Danckwardt was sentenced to death by beheading according to these laws. The execution took place on September 16. The executioner, Jonas Wessman, was allegedly late and under the influence of alcohol which resulted in him not performing the beheading correctly and was forced to strike three times in order to completely remove the head from the body. Wessman was brought to court, but was let off with a formal warning. On November 13, 1719, a court martial was held with the arrested Carlsten officers. The officers stated that all documents that they had signed on Carlsten were simply a report on the fortress' defensive capabilities and that the last parts, that documented the official surrendering of the fortress, must have been added after the signing, without their knowledge. Because of this, the officers were not sentenced to death.  Myths  \\"What is the delay?\\" An impatient Tordenskjold speaks with a humble Danckwardt at Marstrand. According to Rothe, Tordenskjold made an active effort to drive a certain part of the Swedes out of Carlsten after the surrender. Painted by the Danish artist Otto Bache (1875). Carlsten's surrender has been compared to Siege of Sveaborg and its surrender in 1808. Psychological warfare was used in both cases to break down their opponents will to fight. Certain events at Marstrand in 1719 have become myths, which can sometimes be confirmed or disproved with the help of documents from the time. = Espionage = Peder Tordenskjold (then known as Peter Wessel) was a crewman on a civilian British vessel in the summer of 1710. Bad weather forced the crew to navigate the vessel towards Marstrand. Peter Wessel seized an opportunity to explore the town's surroundings and fortifications without being suspected as a Danish spy. He left afterwards on a Dutch warship and reported his findings in a letter to Frederick IV, which he sent on February 28, 1711. = Tordenskjold's soldiers = Captain von Utfalls visit to Tordenskjold at Marstrand on July 14, was described in a more detailed way by Danish author Casper Peter Rothe. Rothe claims that Tordenskjold had only between 200 and 300 soldiers present in the city. While the soldiers were being deployed, Utfall was invited into a local tavern. Tordenskjold ordered his men to roam the streets slowly in larger groups so that it would appear to the intoxicated von Utfall that there were at least 1,000 of them. The story is most likely untrue, as the amount of Danish soldiers in the city was listed as 500 men on the Swedish instrument of surrender, which corresponds with Danish intelligence. = Reinforcements = Findings from the wreckage of the former frigate Fredricus in Marstrand, on display at Bohusl√§n museum. On the left, the head of a rammer can be seen ‚Äì which was used to load the gunpowder into the cannon before it fired. Linstocks are also visible which were used to deal with the burning slow matches. A handle is visible to the right with a personal marking on it. In his letter to Danckwardt, Tordenskjold mentions that he was awaiting reinforcements of 2,000 men which were deployed on the Koster Islands. Rothe's version of the same document mentions that the reinforcements consisted of 20,000 men. The threat was not unfounded, General Major Hans Jacob von Arnold was in command of a landing force of around 8,000 men, who were embarked on 28 transport ships near Larkollen but had been forced to return just prior to Tordenskjold's assault due to strong winds. These ships, along with escorts, were supposed to land troops on Hisingen. = Defeated and humiliated = Rothe's version of the events at Marstrand, describes Danish soldiers humiliating the captured Swedish officers by verbally abusing them and forcing them to dress up in women's decorative clothing. Other reports suggest the opposite, that Tordenskjold and Danckwardt, along with their officers socialised for several hours on the night of July 15. = Alleged Saxon betrayal = One of Danckwardt's explanations for his actions was that soldiers with the Saxon Infantry Regiment had allegedly mutinied. The regiment, commanded by Colonel Georg David Zengerlein, was composed of Saxon prisoners of war who had been captured during the battles in Saxony-Poland. They had then been conscripted into the Swedish army and were therefore considered badly motivated mercenaries. That these soldiers were merely present at Carlsten, was seen as a weak point by both the Danish and Swedish militaries. Prior to the assault, Field Marshal Rehnski√∂ld had attempted to dispatch another ship of 150 Swedish soldiers to relieve the 100 Saxon soldiers but due to a large amount of Danish vessels occupying the area, the force had to return to Uddevalla. According to Danish reports, the Danish Captain Kleve had sneaked up to the fortress wall at night and overheard how the Saxon sentries were talking about forcing the commander to surrender. The discipline inside the fortress was poor and women were granted entry into the fortress at night, which was forbidden. Tordenskjold used this to his advantage by smuggling in letters written in German, which urged the Saxon soldiers to surrender. There is nothing relating to a Saxon mutiny stated in the Swedish instrument of surrender. During a war hearing, Captain Palmcrona verified that the Germans were behaving. Colonel Zengerlein of the Saxon Infantry Regiment was the chairman of the war hearing and he would never have been elected to the position if the Swedes had doubted him or his unit.

These proteins have quaternary structures, as they are made up of multiple tertiary structured protein domains. Protein domains can combine to form different types of proteins, creating a diversity of proteins. These domains are spread throughout the genome because they are mobile, which is why some domains can be found in a variety of proteins, even though they are seemingly unrelated. This also allows the domains to fold independently, and so they don't become deformed and unfolded in a new environment.  Development  All proteins are transcribed and produced from blueprints in the cell, called genes. Mosaic proteins can be made when two adjacent genes are transcribed together and are therefore made into the same protein. This can benefit the protein because it makes the protein more stable and gives the protein a more complex function. For example, if the protein is an enzyme, it will be able to act more efficiently with its substrates. Additionally, these proteins are most utilized outside of the cell membrane or on the outer side of membrane proteins. This suggests that these multifunctional proteins played a part in the development of multicellular organisms.  Examples  There are many studies comparing different mosaic proteins and their functional domains, trying to understand protein families and the overall functions of different proteins. For example, SpCRL and SpCRS proteins in sea urchins have a variety of functional domains that are also found within other proteins in the animal. By making comparisons, scientists can understand the complex roles these proteins play. Also, scientists are using the concept of mosaic proteins to improve vaccine function. Vaccines are injections of weak germ cells into the body that stimulate the body to produce antibodies specific to that germ. This ensures that the body will build an immunity, and that next time the germ is introduced, it will be more equipped to fight it off. Mosaic proteins of the germs can be designed in order to maximize antibody production and quality.

Aymeric Eug√®ne Robert d‚ÄôHumi√®res (1868-1915), was a French man of letters, poet, chronicler, translator and theatre director.  Biography  Robert d'Humi√®res was born on 2 March 1868 at the Ch√¢teau de Conros, Arpajon-sur-C√®re in Cantal d√©partement. A former pupil of Saint-Cyr, he returned to civilian life. Called up for the duration of the First World War as captain with the 4e r√©giment de zouaves, he was killed on 26 April 1915 at Lizerne.Lizerne (in the defence of Ypres). He was cited in army orders as √™tre mort en h√©ros en combattant √† la t√™te de son unit√© (\\"died heroically in combat at the head of his unit\\"). He was posthumously awarded the title of Chevalier de la L√©gion d'honneur. He was the son of Count Aymeric d'Humi√®res (1839-1923) and the Countess, n√©e Norah Kelly, an American of Irish origin, born in Connecticut (1842-1922), fthe daughter of Robert Kelly. In 1905, he married Marie de Dampierre (1881-1917); they had three children. A friend of Marcel Proust, he helped the latter with his translation of John Ruskin's The Bible of Amiens. He was friend of Oscar Wilde who gives him a dedicated copy of his Poems (Paris, collection Jean-David Jumeau-Lafond).  Career  If the name of Robert d'Humi√®res is still known today, it is thanks to his friendship with Proust and also because of the beautiful translations he made (in collaboration with Louis Fabulet) of the works of Rudyard Kipling. He was also an author whose personal genius, humanism, culture, scientific curiosity and first class poetic inspiration, clearly illustrate French literature. His penetrating, sometimes prophetic and always highly enlightened reflection, place him amongst the most inspired philosophers. He was made director of the th√©√¢tre des Arts, from 1907 to 1909. He presented his silent drama The Tragedy of Salome with the American dancer Loie Fuller in his first season; Diaghilev reused this poem for his ballet 1913.  Works  His own works remain to be discovered. He developed an aesthetic of high and enlightened thoughts that is expressed in a dazzling form, sometimes mixing poetry and science in a union of surprising beauty.

She began her career as a web developer in 1994 and has worked in a variety of industries, including engineering, consulting, education, advertising, healthcare, and software development infrastructure. She is known for her work in Ruby, and in 2016 earned the Ruby Hero award at RailsConf, a conference for Ruby on Rails developers. She is also known for her social justice work and activism, the creation of Contributor Covenant, and promoting the widespread adoption of codes of conduct for open source projects and communities.  Career  Ehmke began writing software in 1994, using the Perl programming language. She has since written software in ASP.NET and Java, before discovering Ruby in 2007. She is the author of 25 Ruby gems and has contributed to projects including Rspec and Ruby on Rails. She has spoken frequently at software conferences,     and she has given keynote addresses at multiple technology conferences worldwide, including RubyFuza in Cape Town, South Africa and RubyConf Brazil. In 2013 at the Madison+ Ruby conference, Ehmke was among a group of people who announced the creation of a community for LGBT technologists called LGBTech. During this announcement, she also came out publicly as transgender. In 2014, Ehmke created OS4W.org, a website to help all women contribute to open source by connecting them with mentors and pair programming partners, and identifying open source projects that welcome diverse contributors. Also in 2014, she created the Contributor Covenant, a code of conduct used in over 40,000 open source projects including all such projects from Google, Microsoft, and Apple. In 2016, she received a Ruby Hero award in recognition of her work on the Contributor Covenant. After allegations of sexual harassment were made against the founder and CEO of GitHub and his wife in March 2014, Ehmke joined Betsy Haibel to create a service called the Culture Offset. Culture Offset allowed people who wished to boycott GitHub but were unable to do so because it was necessary for their work to \\"offset\\" their use by directing donations to organizations working to help underrepresented people in the technology industry. This project was featured in the Wall Street Journal and Wired Magazine. Ehmke was a panelist on the Ruby Rogues podcast from 2014 to 2016, and is a founding panelist on the Greater Than Code podcast. She serves on the boards of directors for Ruby Together and RailsBridge. In 2016, she joined GitHub as a senior developer on a team that develops community management and anti-harassment features for the software platform. She was fired approximately a year later, and on July 5, 2017 published an article criticizing GitHub's culture and the circumstances surrounding her severance. Her story was featured in a 2017 report on hush clauses and non-disparagement agreements published by CNN. In 2018 Ehmke participated in a debate at the United Nations Forum on Business and Human Rights in Geneva, Switzerland on the topic of tech companies being a threat to human rights. Related to this Human Rights work, Ehmke created the Hippocratic License and founded the Ethical Source Movement. Ehmke has been the repeated target of negative reporting by far-right organizations and bloggers including Breitbart News, and has described herself as a \\"Notorious Social Justice Warrior\\" after being given the moniker in a Breitbart article about her joining GitHub.  Personal life  Ehmke is transgender, and began her transition in March 2014. She has been public about her transition in hopes of helping others, and has given several interviews about her experiences transitioning and working as a trans woman in technology.

The film stars Anthony Morrison, Steve Railsback, Ronald France, and Glynis Johns.EW.com The plot concerns an alien, Nukie, who crash lands on earth and seeks help from two children to reunite with his brother, Miko, who has been captured by the US government.Nukie (1988) - TCM.com The film was considered a knock-off of Steven Spielberg's 1982 film E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial.One-Word Weird-A-ThonAmerican Cinematheque It is considered one of the worst movies ever made.  Plot  Two aliens, Nukie and Miko, spend their time flying through space in the form of stars and looking for fun. The two come across the planet Earth and, while trying to survey the planet, get caught in its gravitational pull and end up crash landing. During the crash, the two are separated, with Nukie ending up in the African savanna and Miko falling into the hands of a Space Federation in the United States. Upon discovering Miko's crash site, the agency take the alien in to perform tests on him, while Miko cries out for Nukie. Miko reaches out to Nukie telepathically and informs him that he is being held captive in America. The head of the operation, Dr. Glynn (Lester C. Muller) sends Dr. Eric Harvey (Steve Railsback) to Nairobi to investigate the other crash site. During their experiments, the scientists discover that Miko is a being made of pure energy. Nukie, meanwhile, begins to explore his surroundings, attempting to communicate telepathically with the animals he encounters to ascertain the location of America. The animals don't understand and ‚Äì much to Nukie's frustration ‚Äì run away. He then comes across two children, Tiko (Siphiwe Mlangeni) and Toki (Sipho Mlangeni), who seem to be able to understand Nukie. He asks them for their help with finding America, but they run off vowing not to tell anybody about what has happened. In America, Miko is subjected to more painful testing to explore his physical makeup. Miko's brain patterns show images of the animals which Nukie sees, indicating that Nukie is transmitting his brainwaves to Miko. Nukie decides to rest in the shade of a tree, turning invisible as he does so. Tiko and Toki pass by and Nukie is awoken by a flock of birds, becoming visible once more. He surmises that his light beam transformer must be working once more, and he succeeds in flying. Landing near a stream, he tastes the water and notices his reflection, which he claims is different from usual. As the Space Federation continue to experiment on Miko, Sister Anne (Glynis Johns) is contacted via radio to inform her that Dr. Harvey is on his way to her mission. She reports nothing unusual happening, and says that Dr. Harvey will not be expected. The next day, an earthquake strikes the tribal village, and subsequently the tribe breaks into the mission seeking shelter, but Sister Anne tells them to stay outside for their own safety. Nukie, meanwhile, comes across a talking ape who finally responds to Nukie, but he claims he does not America. Two hunters arrive and take aim at Nukie, but he freezes one of them and the other carries him back to the village where Dr. Harvey is arriving. The Corporal (Ronald France) attempts to shoot Nukie, but he teleports out of harm's way in time to save Tiko and Toki from a mountain lion. The boys then agree to help Nukie find America. Nukie attempts to commandeer Dr. Harvey's helicopter, but crashes it. At the Space Federation, Miko has started to befriend the supercomputer, Electronic Digital Data Intelligence computer (nicknamed E.D.D.I), and convinces him to scan for Nukie. When this fails, Miko presumes Nukie is asleep. In the meantime, Dr. Harvey repairs the helicopter and takes off, tracking Nukie. Tiko and Toki are brought before Sangoma (Sam Ntsinyi) and the tribe and banished for bringing Nukie into their midst. Sister Anne is mortified, and tells the Corporal to go looking for them. Nukie finds the boys and asks why they were banished. When they explain, Nukie expresses disbelief and tells them to get some sleep. Back at the Space Federation, E.D.D.I berates the scientists' treatment of Miko. Back in Africa, Tiko is bitten by a cobra and is taken back to the camp by Dr. Harvey, who has tracked them from the village. The corporal also arrives, and shoots Nukie with tranquilizers. The tribe then appear to carry Nukie's unconscious body back to the village despite Toki's protests. In America, E.D.D.I begins to rebel against the researchers, refusing to administer an injection, and the researchers threaten to report the problem to IBM. Toki (now referred to as Tiko due to a production error) tells Dr. Harvey and Sister Anne about Nukie's capture. Dr. Harvey makes to report the news, but Sister Anne refuses to allow this as it will invite outside interference. Meanwhile, E.D.D.I attempts once more to scan for Nukie, and manages to lock in on Toki. Miko asks Toki where Nukei is, and Toki replies that he may know where he has been taken. Back in the village, the tribe has Nukie locked up in a cage, but the Corporal tells Sangoma that he is more valuable alive than dead. Toki sneaks up on the party and sneaks into the Corporal's truck as he makes off with Nukie. While at a nearby trading post, Charlie the Chimpanzee attempts to free Nukie, but it takes Toki to break him out. The Corporal finds Toki sneaking around and holds him at gunpoint as Nukie and Charlie escape. Shooting at Nukie's retreating figure, he alerts Sister Anne to his presence and she distracts him enough to allow Nukie to escape. Nukie finds Tiko at the infirmary and heals him, then Toki and Charlie arrive. Toki and Nukie decide to leave Tiko to recover, and set off to find America. Meanwhile, Sister Anne attempts to contact Dr. Harvey, but finds out that Dr. Harvey has left for America and that the Corporal has been trying to sell Nukie. In America, Miko begs to be set free, claiming he will die if he does not go free. E.D.D.I attempts to free him, but cannot bypass the security system. Dr. Harvey arrives at the Space Federation but is told to return to Africa. Miko manages to escape with the help of Pamela Carter (Carin C. Tietze). With Miko missing the project is now cancelled, and Dr. Glynn tenders his resignation. Back in Africa, Nukie and Toki manage to evade the Corporal, who drives off the edge of a cliff into a river while attempting to run them down. Nukie ends up in the river too, and falls over a waterfall. Toki finds Nukie badly hurt at the bottom, and is told to try to contact Miko. When this fails, Nukie suggests that the two of them try flying with Miko's help. They manage to fly some of the way, but Nukie collapses from exhaustion and crashes. Toki calls to America for help as Nukie lays exhausted. Later, Toki is sat by some water and wishes for his family as well as Miko and Nukie to be with him. Following his wish, Tiko, their mother and Sister Anne arrive. Tiko explains that Nukie is not a bad omen as the tribe claim, but a friend who is in need. Nukie then appears in his light form, and Dr. Harvey lands in his helicopter bringing Miko with him. Miko and Nukie move to greet each other and then inform the humans that they have to leave.

Really, really, really fucking bad,\\" while claiming that sitting through the film left him feeling violated and significantly more stupid than before. He would later go on to say that Nukie is the worst film he has ever reviewed. Total Film named Nukie the worst kids movie ever made. They also named it one of the worst science-fiction films ever made. Simon Abrams of Politico compared Nukie to another E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial knock- off, Mac and Me. Abrams wrote that Nukie was worse than Mac and Me, adding that it was \\"probably the most incompetent E.T. ripoff of any time period ... While Mac and Me was just rotten and ill-conceived, Nukie is uniquely perplexing.\\" Derek Miller of BadMovieRealm was similarly hostile toward the film, but complimented the performances of Siphiwe and Sipho Mlangeni, who he claimed were \\"the only bright spot in the film. Unlike... everything else in the movie, the boys somehow manage to at least come off as likeable.\\" His review concluded \\"I'll grudgingly admit, while it is an absolutely dreadful film by nearly every objective measure, Nukie probably isn't the worst E.T. knockoff ever made. However, it is definitely the worst one you can watch with your lights on, the volume up, and your door unlocked.\\" Reviewer Matt Caracappa was more lenient on the film, highlighting the uniqueness of the film's premise. However, he notes that the film is \\"incredibly annoying... as in, painful and grating to see and hear,\\" and that ultimately \\"once the novelty of the insanity wears thin, you're left with an exceedingly boring movie that plods along worse than a one-legged duck who just barely survived a big fire.\\" Movie reviewer Mike Stoklasa has said this movie is so bad that he must own all of them. He now has a wall of Nukie VHS tapes, which he uses to play a variation of the game Jenga with unlabelled VHS tapes, stating, ‚ÄúEvery tape we take out will be replaced with a VHS tape of Nukie.‚Äù  References   External links  * * Nukie at AllMovie * Trailer Category:1987 films Category:1987 independent films Category:1980s adventure comedy films Category:1980s science fiction comedy films Category:Alien visitations in films Category:E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial Category:English-language films Category:Films about NASA Category:Films set in Nairobi Category:Films set in the United States Category:Films shot in Germany Category:Mockbuster films Category:South African films Category:Trimark Pictures films ","title":"Nukie"},{"id":"50520341","text":"Lithia Springs Regional Park, is a park in Lithia, Hillsborough County, Florida, in the United States. The park's major attraction is a natural spring from which water flows year-round at a temperature of 72 degrees. Sixty per- cent of the park is surrounded by the Alafia River, into which the water from the spring flows. In addition to the popular swimming area, the park includes forty-four campsites and two indoor shower facilities, as well as canoe and kayak launch facilities and canoe rental. There is a large grassy area. a fishing dock, volleyball, and hiking trails. A circular trail between the park and Alderman's Ford Regional Park is being planned by the Southwest Florida Water Management District (SwiftMud) and the Environmental Lands Acquisition and Protection Program (ELAPP). Lithia Spring Major The spring, officially known as Lithia Spring Major, is located 500 feet from the Alafia River, into which it discharges an average of 35 million gallons of water per day. Lithia Springs is within the Floridan Aquifer, and is recharged by precipitation falling within five to ten miles of the vent. The spring vent lies in 10‚Äì15 feet of water, underneath an outcropping of limestone, which is part of the Arcadia Formation, and is protected by a steel grate. As the water is very clear, the vent is clearly visible in the swimming area. The water is a year- round temperature of 72 degrees, making it the warmest in Central Florida. The water contains nitrates, sulfates, as well as a trace amount of its namesake Lithium. Research by the WQMP shows the elevated level of nitrates is caused by fertilizer applied to citrus in close proximity to the spring. A portion of the water is diverted to an industrial facility operated by the Mosaic fertilizer mining company.

Location  Freiberger Mulde near Kloster Buch Kloster Buch is located approximately halfway between the cities Leipzig and Dresden, about 4 km east of the town of Leisnig in the Mittelsachsen district and in a bend of the river Freiberger Mulde. The floodplain of the latter is here about 800 m wide, bordered by forests and used for agriculture.  History  = From its foundation until the Protestant Reformation = Kloster Buch was first mentioned in a document of Emperor Heinrich IV who bestowed to it the parish of LeisnigOriginal document: S√§chisches Staatsarchiv Dresden, 10001; √Ñltere Urkunden: Nr. 101 (1 December 1192) According to Cistercian tradition, (Reprint: Ridgewood, N.J., Gregg Press, 1964) abbot Hildebert, twelve monks and twelve lay brothers left Sittichenbach Abbey in 1 August 1192 and reached Buch on 17 August 1192. Kloster Buch is therefore a filial abbey of Sittichenbach, their primary abbey is Morimond. The foundation of the new abbey was initiated by Burgrave Heinrich III of Leisnig, who resided in nearby Mildenstein Castle. Unlike other Cistercian monasteries, it was not founded in uninhabited parts. The Burgraves of Leisnig gifted the monastery with many villages. It also possessed several granges in the surrounding regions as well as outposts in Leipzig and Oschatz, indication its participation in the medieval overland trade. In 1309 the monastery acquired the town of Belgern, where it established an ecclesiastical manor, together with its ferry across the river Elbe. Manor buildings in Belgern, once belonging to Kloster Buch The Margraves of Mei√üen, who forced the Burgraves of Leisnig to sell their burgraviate and who took possession of Mildenstein Castle in 1365, also bestowed the monastery with donations or had donations of their ministeriali transferred to it. Finally, the monastery held 52 villages. The number of monks and lay brothers living in Kloster Buch has not been passed on. In the late Middle Ages most monks hailed from the local and neighbouring areas, the furthest known place of origin was Halle (Saale). In 1433 a manuscript bible was made in the monastery, and in 1441 the abbot gained privileges ordinarily reserved to bishops, such as to wear a mitre and a bishop's ring during Solemn Mass, and to consecrate objects for liturgical use. In the same year, the abbey was awarded a coat of arms by the Council of Basel, showing the Lamb of God, a flag with the Christian cross, and three roses symbolising Mary, the patron saint of the Cistercian order. In 1486 a Cistercian school was founded in Belgern which prepared young monks for their studies, in particular at the Cistercian college of Leipzig University. = From dissolution until the 19th century = After abbot Antonius Dytz died on 20 December 1525, the monastery was dissolved in the course of the Protestant Reformation which had already prevailed in nearby Leisnig. Prince-elector John the Steadfast had the election of a new abbot suppressed and ordered the properties of the abbey to be administrated by his representative Kaspar Kitzscher. The monks were offered ‚Äì according to their rank ‚Äì parts of the property of the monastery as means of subsistence, or money to take up a civil trade. Alternatively, they were allowed remain on place. (Reprint: Leisniger Geschichts- und Heimatverein, 2013.) The village of Klosterbuch grew from buildings surrounding the secularised monastery. In 1965 it was incorporated into Leisnig. Manor chapel, seen from the courtyard From 1532 on, the Landst√§nde of Saxony took over the administration of the sequestered holdings of the monastery from the representatives of the Leisnig Amtmann More distant possessions were lost, while others were sold, such as the villages of Poselitz (1534) and Paudritzsch (1545). In 1548 the estate was put under the control of Klosteramt Buch, and a register (Amtserbbuch) was compiled. In 1556, councilors of the Prince-elector took over the administration, and in 1567 the estate was given to Johann von Zeschau as a hereditary fiefdom, becoming a manor in the process. The Zeschau family had the abbot's house rebuilt and, probably around 1600, the manorial chapel built from the ruins of the choir of the abbey's church. During the Thirty Years' War the estate suffered much damage and had to be auctioned off. It was bought by F√ºrstenschule Grimma who had the manor chapel renovated and consecrated anew in 1678 by the church superintendent of Leisnig, and remained in possession of the estate until 1836, when it became property of the Saxon state. = 20th and 21st century = In the course of the agrarian reforms (Bodenreform) in the Soviet occupation zone the manor was transformed into a Volkseigenes Gut. In 1990 this became a GbR who, however, stopped using the former monastery premises for agricultural purposes in 1994. Restoration works started in 1992, directed by the town of Leisnig and its local history club. In 2000 the premises passed into the hands of the support association F√∂rderverein Kloster Buch e.V., and transformation into a historico-cultural centre began. Floods in 2002 caused severe damage which was completely repaired until 2008. Today the former abbey is used as a venue for exhibitions, guided tours and other events, among them a monthly farmer's market and the yearly monastery and harvest festival in September. Each year, Kloster Buch receives tens of thousands of visitors.  Buildings  Abbot's residence Remains of the necessarium Manor chapel, western side Ruins of former malt house Of the medieval buildings, the eastern parts of the church, the chapter house, the infirmarium, the abbot's residence and several auxiliary buildings have survived. The church was a pillared basilica with a nave and two aisles and a transept. An outer wall of an aisle, the choir and three sidechapels are still extant. Using medieval parts (pillars, windows, and vaults), a smaller evangelical church was built in the choir to serve the manor with an altar on its western side. From the courtyard it cannot be recognised as a church. The chapter house with a length of 70 m is witness to the generous planning of the builders and founders who envisaged a numerous convent. Its room layout was changed several times according to the varying uses after the dissolution of the monastery. It contained the assembly room on the ground floor, while the upper floor served as the dormitorium. Toilets, the so-called necessarium, were located at its southern end. A sewer branching off the Mulde river flowed through this part of the building which was only accessible from the inside of the dormitorium. Remainders of the lower part of the necessarium can still be viewed. The two-storied abbot's residence was built around 1400 as evidenced by dendrochronological studies of the roof timbers. Its outward appearance is determined by alterations performed in the 16ths and 17th century, while the portal with its pointed arch dates back into the Middle Ages. The infirmarium (sick quarters) was located behind the abbot's residence. The eastern part of the ward and the chapel have been preserved unlike the infirmaries and necessaries of other former monasteries. Ruins of the so-called brewery or malt house are found west of the former monastic quarters. Here the lay brothers worked, guests were received, and travellers were accommodated. The location of the former cloister is traced by flowr beds. A 10 m long fragment of the wall that once surrounded the entire premises has been preserved between chapter house and brewery.

The company, which is now owned by the third generation of its founding family, currently employs around 60 people. Titoni manufactures watches in the mid-price range. Almost all of the timepieces have mechanical movements that are assembled by hand. The family- owned company thus combines the art of the traditional watchmaker's skills with the use of the latest technologies. In the year 2019 Titoni introduced its manufacture movement called calibre T10. The in-house developed movement can so far only be found in selected models, e.g. Line1919 which was introduced in 2019 in celebration of the 100-years anniversary of the company. The watch brand Titoni is known in Switzerland by watch experts in particular as a quality brand with an excellent price-performance relationship. For historical reason, the traditional family-run company focuses on working the international markets. History In the year 1919, Fritz Schluep set up a small watch workshop in Grenchen, Switzerland. He started with only three employees, but with hard work and a clear vision, the small team developed its first watches under the brand name Felco (later: Felca). Just one year later, the team had grown to 15 people and sales could be expanded to outside of Switzerland to America, Germany, and Japan. In 1938 Fritz Schluep's son Bruno Schluep, who had trained as a master watchmaker in Le Locle, joined the family business. In the year 1952, Fritz & Bruno Schluep introduced the new name Titoni and started to use it in combination with the meihua, the plum blossom, as its logo. About seven years later, 1959, Fritz Schluep passed away, leaving his son Bruno in charge of what was now a successful watch company with worldwide sales. In the 1950s Titoni entered as one of the first Swiss watch brands the Chinese markets. Throughout the years, Titoni managed to get a very strong positioning among Chinese customers. Until today, Titoni continuously increased its market presence in Asia and has as of today over 600 points of sales in Greater China and Southeast Asia. Furthermore, over the years, Titoni introduced many iconic models (such as Airmaster in 1969, Space Star in 1983, and the Masters Series COSC in 2006) that can still be found in the current collection. Although only for selected watch models, Titoni is among the few brands that certify their watches with COSC certificates. Titoni Ltd. located at Grenchen, Switzerland Shortly after the firms 60 years' anniversary Bruno Schluep passed away and his son Daniel Schluep took over as the 3rd Generation. In 2019, Titoni celebrated its 100th anniversary. To mark the occasion, the brand introduces its first in-house calibre called the T10 calibre in combination with the new watch series Line 1919. Products The current collection of Titoni includes about 10 product families including both, ladies and gents models. * Master Series (COSC certified) * Line 1919 * Cosmo * Airmaster * Space Star * Impetus * Slender line * Miss Lovely (Ladies only) * Mademoiselle by Titoni (Ladies only) * Heritage References External links *Titoni Ltd.

In The Buffet, Salem expands one of the scenes in Oedipus. In the latter work, Awaleh, the chief of police, seems more interested in grilling anyone who even unintentionally implies something against Oedipus than he is in preserving the security of the city.\\" The Buffet was written in 1967, first performed at the Hakim Theatre in Cairo in March 1968, published in Arabic in 1969, and in English translation in 1973 by John Waterbury. The term al-B≈´fƒ´h in Arabic refers to an office canteen or snack bar, although the play is set not down in the canteen, but upstairs in the office of the theatre manager. The cast requires only three actors: a theatre manager in an unnamed Kafkaesque authoritarian state, a playwright trying to get his play produced, and the waiter who brings food up from the buffet below. These characters symbolize the human contract between the powerful (the manager) and the powerless (the playwright) and the waiter (brute force).Northeast Africa Series 1973 \\"The Buffet is a one-act play by Ali Salem which was performed at the Hakim Theatre in Cairo, March 1968. It involves only three actors. The author has reduced the complexities of political power to their simplest elements: executive power, muscle, and brains locked into a single room and bound by a contract none of them can break. The first sophisticated forms of centralized political power may have been developed in the Nile Valley. Thousands of years later Ali Salem evokes the same immutable forms of the use of power and force. The situation depicted in the play is universal, but I have left unchanged most of those details that are particular to Egypt. The title itself. The Buffet (Al-Bufay) of course has a certain connotation in English. In this play it is the equivalent of an office canteen or snack bar, but the word \\"canteen\\" does not really do justice to the Egyptian institution, thus I decided to use the word \\"buffet\\" despite its rather different implication in English.

It has been a ruin since the Thirty Years' War.  Geography  Lauterstein castle is situated on a gneiss rock at the eastern end of Niederlauterstein village, above the left bank of Schwarze Pockau river, approximately 2 km north-west of Z√∂blitz and 4.5 km north-east of Marienberg.  History  Archeological investigations in the 1970s have shown that the castle was built in the second half of the 12th century. It was first mentioned in writing in 1304 when a document named a Johannis in Lutirstein of the ministerial family of Erdmannsdorf in the castle. The castle was mainly built from stone, hence probably the name ending in -stein.Hering 1, 1828, p. 32 Its purpose was the protection of a medieval trade route between Leipzig and Prague across the Ore Mountains. The family of Schellenberg became lords of Lauenstein in the early 14th century. They lost their influence in 1323 after they lost a feud with Altzella Abbey, and margrave Frederick the Brave enfeoffed the burgraves Albrecht IV von Altenburg und Otto I von Leisnig, who had helped to support him and the abbey, with Lauterstein castle and the town of Zcobelin (Z√∂blitz). Doctoral thesis Kaspar von Berbisdorf from Freiberg, an owner of mines and metalworks in the Ore Mountains, bought the lordship of Lauterstein for 4000 guilders from burgrave Otto II of Leisnig and Altenburg in 1434. His descendants Bastian and Melchior divided the lordship and the castle in 1497 into Oberlauterstein and Niederlauterstein.Hering 1, 1828, p. 258‚Äì259 A fire damaged the castle in 1530, but it was rebuilt within a few years.

The Mill was located on the north bank of the Monroe City Creek, about one quarter mile below its source at a karst spring. The creek provided water to power the mill. The valley created by erosion from the creek is generally referred to as \\"the Monroe City Hollow.\\" Over the years, the Mill has been referred to by a number of names, primarily reflecting ownership: Kinney's Mill from 1800 until about 1823; James' Mill from about 1823 until 1850; Ziebold's Mill from 1850 until 1856; and Monroe City Mill since 1856 when the Town of Monroe City was platted. In 1798, Josiah Ryan built a mill in the Monroe City Hollow about 2 miles west of the Monroe City Mill site, also on the banks of the Monroe City Creek.  Kinney's Mill  320x320px In 1800, Andrew Kinney built the original Mill at the current site. According to the Combined History (1883), \\"Where Monroe City now stands Andrew Kinney built a water mill, and this vicinity, at an early time, became one of the important business points of the county. From this mill flour was shipped to St. Louis and to New Orleans before the war of 1812.\\" Kinney also built a dam on the creek about 200 yards upstream. The dam was about 15' tall and collected water which was channeled to the mill through a wooden trough. Remains of the dam can still be seen. John Great, an emigrant from Maryland was the stonemason. One grindstone is on display at the Rosalie Baum home across the creek from the mill. In 1814, Kinney installed a cotton gin at the Mill.

Yung made her return to Impact Wrestling on the March 22 episode of the show, attacking Allie while Braxton Sutter proposed to her, establishing herself as a heel. That led to Sutter accompanying Yung through her matches. At Redemption, Yung faced Allie for the Impact Knockouts Championship, but she was defeated. After Yung lost, Sutter proposed to her but was misted in the face, ending their relationship. On the April 26 episode of Impact!, Yung debuted her legion of undead bridesmaids and attacked Allie in an attempt to put her in a coffin, until Rosemary rescued her. That incident started a rivalry between Rosemary and Yung, which led into a match between them on the May 3 episode of Impact!, that ended up in a brawl. Allie tried to help Rosemary, but Yung's undead bridesmaids held her back and forced her to watch, as Yung attacked Rosemary and put her inside a coffin. On the May 17 episode of Impact!, Yung and her undead bridesmaids held a funeral for Rosemary, misting her coffin and setting it on fire. On May 31 (which was taped on April 24) at Impact! Under Pressure, Yung defeated Allie in a Last Rites match to win the Knockouts Championship for the first time in her career. At One Night Only: Zero Fear on June 15, Yung made her first successful title defense against Katarina. At Slammiversary XVI, Yung successfully retained her title against Madison Rayne. On August 12 (which aired on tape delay on August 30) at Impact! ReDefined, Yung lost the title to Tessa Blanchard in a three-way match that also involved Allie, ending her reign at 110 days. On the September 6 episode of Impact!, she received her rematch against Blanchard for the Knockouts Championship, but was unsuccessful in regaining the title. After Yung lost, she attacked Blanchard and tried to put her inside a coffin, until Allie and Kiera Hogan attacked Yung and rescued Blanchard. On the October 4 episode of Impact!, Yung defeated Kiera Hogan in a match and got into a brawl with Allie who was saved by Hogan, but was able to put the latter inside a coffin. At Bound for Glory, Yung was attacked by Allie who entered the Undead Realm to rescue Hogan and dealt with a returning Rosemary as they escaped, with the former appearing to be possessed. Following the next couple of months, Allie showed a darker and villainous version of herself, aligning with Yung and turning on her friend Hogan under possession, thus turning heel for the first time since 2016. On the January 3, 2019 episode of Impact!, the newly formed duo attacked Hogan after a match, and were interrupted by Jordynne Grace who came to rescue her. This led to a tag team match at Homecoming, which they won as Yung technically submitted Hogan, but were soon confronted by Rosemary. Yung continued her feud with Rosemary who wanted to get Allie back, and on the February 22 episode of Impact!, she got involved in the \\"Dark War\\" concocted by Father James Mitchell, where both Allie and Rosemary's lives were at stake. On the March 9 episode of Impact!, Team Su Yung (Yung, Allie and The Undead Maid of Honor) were defeated by Team Rosemary (Rosemary, Hogan and Grace), meaning that Allie belonged to Rosemary. On March 29 at Against All Odds, Yung was confronted by Rosemary who came to the Undead Realm to retrieve Allie's soul, and she \\"killed\\" the latter instead. After distracting her in a four-way match for the Knockouts Championship at United We Stand, their rivalry came to a head in a Demon Collar match on the May 17 episode of Impact!, with Yung losing to Rosemary and being dragged by her afterwards. On the June 7 episode of Impact!, she was freed from her control by a returning Havok, now aligning herself with Father Mitchell. At Slammiversary XVII, Yung competed for the Knockouts Championship in a four-way Monster's Ball match against Rosemary, Havok and then-champion Taya Valkyrie. As Valkyrie retained her title, Yung's alliance with Havok began to see fractures. On the August 9 episode of Impact!, Yung prevented Havok from winning the Knockouts Championship against Valkyrie, leading to a match between the both of them on the September 6 episode of Impact!, where Yung disqualified herself after misting Havok in the face. The two would meet again in a no disqualification match on the September 20 episode of Impact!, with Yung losing to Havok after a tombstone piledriver. They continued to brawl backstage, ending with Havok wrapping a noose around Yung's neck and hanging her over the staircase rail, presumably killing her. Susie (2019‚Äìpresent) On the October 29 episode of Impact!, Riggs made an appearance without her makeup, introducing herself as Susie. Susie continued making appearances over the following months, having no recollection of her past but slowly regaining her memories after coming across Havok and Father Mitchell, being coerced to join them. On the January 28, 2020 episode of Impact!, Rosemary invited Susie to a \\"friendly competition\\" against her the next week, where they fought each other to a double count-out and continued to brawl backstage, ending with Rosemary wrapping a noose around Susie's neck and resurrecting Su Yung. The next couple of weeks had her send both Father Mitchell and Havok to the Undead Realm. On the March 24 episode of Impact!, it led to a fight between Yung and Havok that saw both of them betrayed by Father Mitchell and sent to the Undead Wasteland, only for them to escape thanks to Rosemary and kill him. Riggs reverted back to her Susie persona on the March 31 episode of Impact!, fully aware that she terrified people as Su Yung and caused bad things to them. On the May 26 episode of Impact!, she aligned herself with Kylie Rae after they were bullied and beaten up by Kiera Hogan and Tasha Steelz, leading to a tag team match the next week, where they lost after Hogan pinned Susie with a swinging fisherman suplex. On the June 23 episode of Impact!, Susie was defeated by Taya Valkyrie in a singles match, and was continually insulted by her until Rae arrived to save Susie. On the July 14 episode of Impact!, she teamed with Rae, Havok, Nevaeh and Alisha Edwards in a 10 Knockout tag team match to defeat the team of Kimber Lee, Hogan, Steelz, Rosemary and Valkyrie. At Slammiversary, Susie competed in a Gauntlet for the Gold match to determine the #1 contender for the Knockouts Championship, which was won by Kylie Rae. On the July 28 episode of Impact!, Susie joined a bunch of wrestlers in the reality show Wrestle House. The following week, she teamed with Alisha Edwards to defeat Johnny Swinger in a mixed gender handicap match. On the August 11 episode of Impact!, Susie went on a date with Cousin Jake Deaner that goes wrong when her Su Yung persona briefly returns and scares him off. She naively blamed Edwards for the bad dating advice she gave her, leading to a match between them that Susie won by using a roll-up. On the September 1 episode of Impact!, Susie confronted Cousin Jake during his brawl alongside Cody Deaner against XXXL (Acey Romero and Larry D), angry that she broke the truce between the two teams and unknowingly \\"winning\\" the match. She and the rest of the Wrestle House cast returned to the Impact Zone during Knockouts Champion Deonna Purrazzo's Black Tie Affair, preventing Kimber Lee from attacking Kylie Rae. On the September 15 episode of Impact!, Susie teamed with Rae in a winning effort against Purrazzo and Lee. On October 3 at Victory Road, she challenged Purrazzo for the Knockouts Championship, but failed to win after submitting to the Venus de Milo. Personal life She married fellow professional wrestler Rich Swann in March 2017. On December 10, 2017, Swann was arrested in Gainesville, Florida on charges of battery and kidnapping/false imprisonment. The victim was identified as his wife. According to the arrest report, Swann and Riggs had gotten into an argument over Swann critiquing Riggs' performance at a show that night. When Riggs tried to get away from Swann, witnesses state that he grabbed her in a headlock and dragged her back into his car. Swann was released from Alachua County Jail later that same day and told to get in contact with court services. On January 25, 2018, all charges against Swann were dismissed, when a determination was made by prosecutors that there was \\"insufficient evidence\\" to move forward with the case.

Built sometime between 1900 and 1910, it is a well-preserved example of a barn built during a transitional period between mixed-use farming and specialized dairy farming. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2015. Description and history The Foster Farm Barn is located on the property currently known as Winterberry Farm, in northern Belgrade, on the east side of Augusta Road (Maine State Route 27), just south of its junction with Point and Guptil Roads. It is set back from the road, behind the farmstand used for public sales, and north of the c. 1900 farmhouse. It is a two-story timber-frame structure with a gambrel roof. It is about in size, and exhibits construction techniques common to the period after the American Civil War. It also includes features that were considered modern in the early 20th century for dairy farming purposes, including concrete manure troughs, ventilation slats in the walls, and specialized ducting to facilitate the movement of air to ventilators in the roof. The lower level of the barn is finished in original wooden shingles, while the upper levels of the walls are unfinished, with exposed sheathing. The barn was built sometime in the first decade of the 20th century, by brothers Frank and Edgar Foster, whose parents had farmed the property since the late 1850s. It (and construction of the house) may have been funded as the result of one of the brothers receiving an inheritance. It was a clear departure from traditional New England barns of the 19th century, which typically had space for only a small number of livestock. The Foster brothers were reported in 1902 to have a dairy herd of fifteen cows, in addition to two each horses, oxen, and pigs. The barn's interior is clearly organized to support a focused dairy operation.

In 1949, when the Civil War ended with the side of the national government victorious, he was transferred to the main place of exile and imprisonment for Greek Leftists, the Makronisos island. Asked repeatedly to repent and denounce his \\"traitorous\\" and \\"subversive\\" beliefs, he refused and was eventually transferred to the prison on Agios Efstratios island and then to the Hadjicostas prison in the mainland. In 1951, his mother died; Leivaditis signed the denunciation papers and was released. He started working in 1954 as a literary critic in the Left's main newspaper Avgi (Dawn), a position he held up to 1967.

The conjecture states that a convex body K containing only one lattice point in its interior as its barycenter cannot have volume greater than (n+1)^n/n!: :\\\\operatorname{Vol}(K) \\\\le \\\\frac{(n+1)^n}{n!}.

Description The sculpture has dimensions 25 x 32 x 24 centimeters. It is in the collection of The Irish Museum of Modern Art, Dublin. Analysis It represents a young girl's dress painted dark pink, that stands alone on a shelf. It is self-supported due to a wax treatment. The bottom part of the dress just under the yoke is decorated with rose hips, or berries. The dress was created in 1994 and the berries were originally round and a blood red color but have dried into a shriveled brown crust.Photo in 1994Artwork record on museum website The dress presents challenges for presentation and preservation, while being itself a commentary on the definition of the term \\"dress\\". Alice Maher's work often incorporates natural materials and this dress can be seen as a pendant of a similar girl's dress presented on a shelf covered in mummified honeybees.Bee Dress, 1994 When asked about her art, Maher said ... the meaning is changing all the time.

He then filed a class action lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Central District of California on behalf of a nationwide class of individuals who had received the text message, but had not previously consented to its delivery.Campbell-Ewald, slip op. at 3. The suit alleged that Campbell's transmission of the text message violated the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991. Gomez's lawsuit claimed costs and attorneys fees, which he claimed should be tripled in light of Campbell's conduct, as well as an injunction to prevent future unsolicited messaging. Before Gomez's class was certified, Campbell proposed a settlement (pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 68), which offered to pay Gomez's costs and $1503.00 for every text message that he could prove that he received, but they did not agree to pay attorneys fees.Campbell-Ewald, slip op. at 3-4.

Early life and career On a scholarship of the Konrad Adenauer Foundation, Seif studied law at the University of Bonn from 1983 until 1989. During his studies, he worked for the International Society for Human Rights. Since 1993, he has been practicing as a lawyer. Political career Seif joined the CDU in 1982 and held positions in local politics in Weilerswist from 1999 to 2009. Since 2009, Seif has been CDU party chairman in the district of Euskirchen. Seif has been a member of the German Bundestag since the 2009 federal elections. Since then, he has been a member of the Committee on European Affairs. In 2014 he became Deputy Spokesman for the committee. Seif's thematic areas of expertise in the committee are basic rights; EU citizenship; coordination between the judicature and police; border protection and counterterrorism; and asylum- and migration policy. Additionally, he is the CDU/CSU parliamentary group's rapporteur for Great Britain and Malta. Between 2009 and 2017, Seif was a member of the Committee on Legal Affairs, where he served as his parliamentary group's rapporteur on legal professionals, data privacy and labor law. In 2018, he joined the Committee on Internal Affairs. The same year, Seif became a member of the first Investigative Committee of the 19th legislative period, which is investigating the failure of German security authorities to prevent Anis Amri's attack on a Berlin Christmas market in December 2016. In addition to his committee assignments, Seif is a member of the German-American Parliamentary Friendship Group and the German-British Parliamentary Friendship Group. Political positions European Affairs On July 17, 2015, Seif voted against his party's line and rejected the Merkel government‚Äôs proposal to negotiate a third bailout for Greece.Paul Carrel (July 17, 2015), German lawmakers back Greek bailout despite rebellion; Tsipras sacks dissenters Reuters.Stephan Haselberger (August 9, 2015), Volker Kauder will Abweichler in der Union bestrafen Der Tagesspiegel. As the EU deputy spokesperson for the CDU/CSU parliamentary group and rapporteur for affairs in Great Britain, Seif is outspoken on the topic of Brexit. Before the Brexit referendum in June 2016, Seif stated that if Prime Minister Cameron wanted Britain to stay in the EU, he would have to convince his fellow Britons of the advantages of EU membership. Seif compared Cameron to a ‚Äúbutterfly,‚Äù and declared that ‚ÄúBritain does not need a butterfly but a lion.‚Äù Regarding Brexit negotiations, Seif has taken a rigid stance and views the Brexit as a ‚Äúcatastrophe‚Äù that ‚Äúdamages economic development and the development of the EU.‚Äù Upon Prime Minister Theresa May's activation of Article 50 of the Treaty of Lisbon beginning formal Brexit proceedings and her remark that a failure to reach an agreement on Brexit would weaken UK-EU cooperation in the fight against crime and terrorism, Seif was one of many German members of parliament who did not take kindly to May's statement, deeming it ‚Äúan extraordinarily primitive attempt at blackmailing us.‚Äù Seif blamed a leak to the Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung of an unflattering description of the first meeting between UK and EU negotiation teams in May 2017 on a ‚Äúbabbling idiot,‚Äù seeing both sides at fault for ‚Äúthe fact that the atmosphere is becoming poisoned.‚Äù Seif believes the Brexit will do significant damage to both Great Britain and the EU and is quoted as saying ‚Äúa win-win settlement is excluded and it‚Äôs appropriate to speak about a lose-lose result.‚Äù Domestic Affairs Within his party, Seif belongs to the conservative wing. During the B√∂hmermann affair in 2016, Seif read the B√∂hmermann's \\"smear poem\\" in the German Bundestag to demonstrate that it is an insult of the Turkish president, which caused the outrage of other MPs.CDU-Politiker Seif verliest das Schm√§hgedicht von B√∂hmermann, Focus, in German In June 2017, Seif voted against Germany's introduction of same-sex marriage.Diese Unionsabgeordneten stimmten f√ºr die Ehe f√ºr alle Die Welt, June 30, 2017. Following the party's result in the 2017 elections, he held that voters had abandoned the CDU because, under Angela Merkel, it had moved too far to the left.Guy Chazan and Stefan Wagstyl (September 25, 2017), Critics circle defiant Angela Merkel after poll losses Financial Times. Following Germany's September 2017 federal elections, Seif identified points of contention between the CDU, CSU, and SPD, telling Reuters that pensions, Europe and asylum and migration policy were all ‚Äúareas where there are explosives built into the coalition agreement.\\" In April 2018, Seif was the first member of the German Bundestag to delete his Facebook account as a result of the Facebook‚ÄìCambridge Analytica data scandal. He wrote an open letter to Facebook's Managing Director in Central Europe in which he stated he could not recommend Facebook to anyone, so long as Facebook continued to handle user data in a sloppy fashion. Ahead of the Christian Democrats‚Äô leadership election in 2020, Seif publicly opposed Friedrich Merz's candidacy to succeed Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer as the party‚Äôs chair.AKK-R√ºckzug: Diese Nachfolger w√ºnschen sich Christdemokraten aus K√∂ln und der Region K√∂lner Stadt-Anzeiger, February 10, 2020.

He was a co-author of the early rotorcraft engineering text, Aerodynamics of the Helicopter, which, although published in 1952, has been in print for more than 50 years. Prof. Gessow was Chair of the Department of Aerospace Engineering at the University of Maryland, College Park, and was ultimately promoted to Professor Emeritus.  Researcher  While Gessow is best known for his book Aerodynamics of the Helicopter, his earliest published technical papers and reports helped bring a new level of clarity to the development of the helicopter, which prior to then had relatively primitive standards for flying qualities. For example, Gessow authored one of the earliest efforts to standardize mathematical symbology in helicopter aeromechanics to enable aerospace engineers to more easily communicate advances in the field. One of Dr. Gessow's earliest theoretical papers was on the subject of blade twist and plan-form effects, and how it affected the fundamental performance of a hovering helicopter. While it is now established that numerical techniques became the basis of methods in early use by the helicopter industry, the digital computers in 1956 were very primitive by modern standards. His approach lays down the well-known \\"blade element method\\" incorporating two- dimensional, non-linear sectional airfoil data from tables, a fundamental engineering approach that even today remains the basis for most helicopter rotor design analyses. In 1967, Gessow published an article in Scientific American on \\"The Changing Helicopter.\\"  Educator  Prof. Gessow devoted much of his government and teaching career to expanding the knowledge of helicopter aerodynamics, developing new theoretical approaches, and conducting flight experiments. = University of Virginia (1945-1956) = Prof. Gessow began his formal career as an educator while assigned to the NASA Langley Research Center, where he also served as Chairman of the Committee on Graduate Studies and as Chairman of the Faculty at University of Virginia's Hampton Roads Graduate Extension Center. During this period, he developed an advanced degree program administered by the University of Virginia for the benefit of personnel working at the Langley Research Center. He organized and taught undergraduate and graduate courses on helicopter and fixed-wing aerodynamics, and also served as a thesis advisor. = A Lecturer in Helicopter Theory = Prof. Gessow taught Helicopter Theory in New York University's summer program in the Aerospace Sciences (1966), and subsequently taught graduate courses as an Adjunct Professor of Aerospace Engineering (1968-1969). He also taught Helicopter Theory at the Catholic University of America (1970-1971), and also served as an invited professor at the Korean Advanced Institute of Science (1979-1980). Prof. Gessow lectured widely on helicopter technology, and delivered lectures at several universities in the United States including Princeton University, Cornell University, Penn State University, Georgia Tech, Colorado State University, Brooklyn Polytechnic, Virginia Polytechnic, and the Catholic University. He also lectured at international universities including the University of Aachen (Germany), the Technion (Israel), and the Korean Advanced Institute of Sciences (South Korea). = University of Maryland (1980-2002) = Prof. Gessow joined the University of Maryland in 1980 as the Chair of the Department of Aerospace Engineering. He served in this capacity from 1980 through 1988. During his tenure as Chair, his leadership was instrumental in expanding the department's research and educational programs into a wide range of fields in aeronautical and astronautical engineering including: rotorcraft; space systems; flight dynamics and control; flight structures; and hypersonic vehicles. In 1981, Prof. Gessow founded the Center for Rotorcraft Education and Research, and continued as its Director until 1992, when he became Professor Emeritus. In 1997, the center that Prof. Gessow founded was renamed the Alfred Gessow Rotorcraft Center to honor his extensive contributions to both the field of rotorcraft and to the University of Maryland. Today, the Alfred Gessow Rotorcraft Center is internationally recognized for its continuing mission of fostering both research and education in the field of vertical flight.  Honors  Prof. Gessow was the recipient of numerous major awards in the field of aerospace engineering. Prof. Gessow was recognized with the NASA Exceptional Service Medal in 1974, the citation for which read \\"for significant contributions to helicopter development, and for effective and innovative planning and management of aerodynamic research activities that have contributed significantly to NASA's stature in aeronautics.\\" Prof. Gessow was awarded Honorary Fellow of the American Helicopter Society in 1978, and the citation stated that Prof. Gessow was recognized \\"For outstanding rotary-wing contributions including inspirational teaching and writing, applying computer technology to rotor blade aerodynamics, and leadership in helicopter airfoil development.\\" Prof. Gessow was awarded the Fifth AHS Alexander A. Nikolsky Honorary Lectureship in 1985. This honorary lectureship is bestowed on an individual who has had \\"a highly distinguished career in vertical flight aircraft research and development, and is skilled at communicating their technical knowledge and experience, for whom a summary of their original work represents a valuable reference publication.\\" Prof. Gessow's lecture was entitled \\"Understanding and Predicting Helicopter Behavior ¬ó‚Äî Then and Now.\\" Prof. Gessow was the recipient of the AHS Alexander Klemin Award (1996). The Alexander Klemin Award is the highest and most prestigious honor bestowed by AHS International on an individual for lifetime achievement in the field of vertical take-off and landing aircraft. Prof. Gessow was awarded Fellow of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics in 1982. Legacy Prof. Gessow was the founding editor of the Journal of the American Helicopter Society, published by AHS International, and served as editor for one year as was the custom of the time. The journal was established in 1956 to provide a forum in which original technical papers dealing with the theory and practice of vertical flight could be peer-reviewed and archived. The journal fosters the exchange of information about innovation and practical information of various aspects of helicopters and V/STOL aircraft. The Journal of the American Helicopter Society celebrated its 50th year of publication in 2006, and reprinted its first issue to commemorate the occasion, and has continued publication to this day. Every year, the American Helicopter Society International, the world's only international technical society for engineers, scientists and others working on vertical flight technology, awards its Alfred Gessow Award for Best Paper in honor of Prof. Gessow, at their annual forum in recognition of the best technical paper presented that year. According to AHS, the award recognizes the author(s) who prepared and presented the most significant forum technical paper as judged and selected by peers. The University of Maryland Department of Aerospace Engineering has a professorship named in Gessow's honor: The Alfred Gessow Professor.

Life and career  Stephen Cornelius Roberts was born in Omaha, Nebraska in 1952. Roberts‚Äô original focus was as a serious musician and went to California to pursue a recording contract with a friend. In 1979 he switched his attention to art as his professional direction. Roberts graduated from the University of Nebraska at Omaha, with a Bachelor of Fine Art degree in painting (under painter Peter Hill) in 1976. Roberts became a full-time artist in 1979. In 1981, with advice and encouragement from Ivan Karp, he went to New York City to find a gallery and was accepted into a small gallery at the time. By October 1990, Roberts was represented by the Allan Stone Gallery in New York City (the gallery of artists such as Wayne Thiebaud, Richard Estes, and William Beckman). In February 1991, Allan Stone said of Roberts, ‚Ä≥I see a lot of figure painting. I think he [Roberts] is especially talented. Besides a strong technical facility, Roberts brings an essential sense of theatricality to his paintings as well as that elusive 'X quality' necessary to their success.‚Ä≥ Roberts' main subject matter is the human figure in narrative and portrait form. The figures in his paintings and drawings are typically life size or larger, some reaching 12 feet in height. Roberts' artwork has been exhibited throughout the country including T√™te-√Ä-T√™te: Portraits In Dialogue at Allan Stone Projects, New York, NY; The Body Revealed: 200 Years of the American Nude, New Britain Museum of Art, New Britain, CT; The Perception of Appearance: A Decade of Contemporary American Figure Drawing, Frye Art Museum, Seattle, WA and Disrobed at Allan Stone Projects, New York, NY. = Influences and process= Roberts‚Äô artistic influences are mostly from Greek and Roman Art and traditional European painting from the Renaissance onward. He works mainly from photographic references, but he does not grid or project them. He spends much of his time freehand drawing in the process of doing his paintings. Roberts‚Äô painting process requires many thin layers of paint in order to achieve the desired effects and the work develops over months and sometimes years until completion. In his drawings he also spends much of the time layering. He usually uses pastel or conte with white highlights and works them up much like his paintings. = Nebraska State Capitol= In 1990, the Nebraska Capitol Mural Commission invited Roberts to participate in a mural competition for eight panels in the Nebraska State Capitol's Memorial Chamber on the 14th floor.

Environment The Mata do Jacar√© has typical seasonal semi-deciduous forest vegetation of the Atlantic Forest biome, one of the last fragments of such forest in the S√£o Carlos region. The unit has riparian vegetation. It is an isolated fragment surrounded by sugar cane fields. A 2002 study found only 145 species of birds, with a low incidence of endangered species.

Invented by Ernesto Stassano in 1898, it is the first electric furnace in history for ferrous metallurgy.  History  Stassano furnace, 1920 Stassano had the idea of building an electrical furnace for ferrous metallurgy in 1896, while he was working in Pont-Saint-Martin, Aosta Valley, on electrical furnaces for the production of calcium carbide. Stassano moved to the workshops of Santa Maria dei Cerchi in Rome, in 1898. Here he carried out his first experiments to obtain steel from iron ores using a small shaft furnace equipped with two electrodes capable of heating the minerals thanks to a 95 kW indirect arc. In the same year, in Darfo (BS), he carried out other tests on a similar furnace, equipped with three electrodes working at 370 kW. As a result of his experiments, Stassano modified the structure of the furnace, reducing the space above the electrodes and separating the section destined to electrodes and the one for the production of the material. He also moved from mineral-only burdens to mixed loads composed of ores, scrap and cast iron. With these adjustments, Stassano obtained high-quality steel from burdens containing 80% scrap and 20% cast iron, thus obtaining a product that could economically compete with imported steel. In 1898 Stassano patented the principles and technical solutions of his furnaces in Italy, Austria, Spain, Luxembourg, Belgium, Norway, England, Sweden, Germany and USA. In 1901 in France and Hungary, and in 1902 in Switzerland. Based on the Darfo furnace, in 1901 Stassano produced a furnace with a final configuration and installed it in the Arsenal in Turin. In 1904 Stassano founded the Societ√† Forni Termoelettrici Stassano (Stassano Society of Thermoelectric Furnaces) and opened in Turin the first foundry where steel was obtained electrically. The foundry was activated in 1905, using for its purposes two 1-ton furnaces, two 2-ton furnaces and one 5-ton furnace. Between 1906 and 1907 a number of Stassano furnaces were activated at the Bonner Faserfabrik plants in Bonn (Germany), in St. Polen (Austria), in Dunston-on-Tyne and Newcastle (UK), in Bridgeton and Redondo (USA). In 1910 Stassano furnaces will also be installed in the Ansaldo steel plants in Genoa and in the Vanzetti plants in Milan. Between 1900 and 1915 there are three active types of electric arc furnaces in the industrial field: the Stassano indirect arc furnace, the Heroult direct arc furnace with non-conductive soles, and the Girod direct arc furnace with conductive soles. The Heroult furnace is, among the three, the most suitable for large-scale production, so that its supremacy determines the decline of the Stassano furnace in the steel industry already in 1915.  Structure  The indirect arc electric furnace of the Stassano type, in its final configuration, is made from a cast iron cylindrical structure lined internally with refractory bricks. The structure is divided in two separate sections: an upper section where the electrodes are placed, and a lower crucible where the burden is loaded and fused into steel. On the upper part of the furnace side wall, in correspondence with the space that houses the three graphite electrodes, are the couplings of the latter, placed at 120¬∞ from one another; each coupling is equipped with a water cooling jacket and a hydraulic system for moving the electrodes; the electrodes are placed in a horizontal position. In the central part of the side wall, in correspondence with the upper part of the crucible, there is the charge door, equipped with a metal panel coated with internal refractory material and closable with a pulley mechanism. In the lower part of the side wall, in correspondence with the lower part of the crucible, is the taphole. At the centre of the upper base of the oven is an escape tube for gases.  Functioning  The Stassano furnace produces steel by fusing scrap iron and cast iron and operating a successive decarburization of the fused material. The furnace is initially loaded with the material to be fused, which is introduced into the crucible from the charge door. Once the loading is completed, current is sent to the electrodes, which generate an electrical arc between them. The arc produces heat which is transmitted to the material to be melted through thermal radiation heat transfer, which is why the furnace is referred to as an indirect or radiant arc device. During the process, the charge door can be reopened to introduce into the crucible further amounts of scrap and cast iron. When all the material has been melted, it undergoes a first refining before it is poured out from the taphole.

He was also well known as the franchise player for Royal Never Give Up and its predecessors, although he also played briefly for OMG and Newbee. Uzi has played in the World Championship grand finals twice, both times with Royal Club. He won his first international title at the 2018 Mid-Season Invitational with his team Royal Never Give Up, after defeating the LCK champions Kingzone DragonX. Uzi officially announced his retirement from professional play on Weibo on 3 June 2020.  Career  Uzi began his professional career on the Chinese team Royal Club. Widely considered as one of the best AD carries during seasons three and four, Uzi demonstrated his great mechanic prowess and carried his team to two consecutive second-place finishes at the League of Legends World Championship in both 2013 and 2014. Despite their success at Season 3 Worlds, the departure of Tabe prompted Uzi to switch to the mid lane at the start of Season 4 before returning to the ADC role during the summer. Renamed to Star Horn Royal Club, Uzi with Korean imports inSec and Zero rose to the challenge and finished second at worlds with a 1:3 series against one of the best teams ever, Samsung White. And he left the Royal club for the communication problem with Korean imports. Season 5 however, proved to be a slump in Uzi's career after moving to OMG. Despite being touted as one of the biggest talent transfers of the offseason, OMG incurred difficulties in integrating Uzi to the team. Coupled with the decline of Gogoing and Lovelin, Season 5 was a disappointing one for Uzi. Uzi was picked up by Qiao Gu Reapers and was their sub for Peco. QG was invited to IEM Katowice in March 2016 where they beat Fnatic in their first best of one but were then subsequently eliminated in the group stages following a loss to SK Telecom T1 and then losing to Fnatic 1 - 2. In May 2016, Qiao Gu Reapers was acquired by Newbee. However, five days later Uzi's contract was bought out by Royal Never Give Up. On 3 June 2020, Uzi announced his retirement from professional gaming, citing health concerns. In a statement he said, \\"As a result of staying up late for years, a fatty diet and being under insurmountable stress, last year I found out that I was type-2 diabetic.\\" He added that his mental state was \\"not as good as it was before\\". In an effort to recover, he took medication and made changes to his work schedule and exercise habits, but his situation did not change. His doctor told him there could be \\"serious complications\\" if he continued playing competitively.

In late 2017, Li was given an 18-month competitive ban by Riot Games for beating his girlfriend during a livestream, an incident which prompted Chinese authorities to investigate and arrest him for domestic violence. Prior to his suspension he was a member of LPL team Newbee, and was best known outside of China as the former AD carry for LCS team LMQ.  Career  = 2014 Season = On 15 December 2013, LMQ left its parent organization Tian Ci and obtained a new sponsor in iBUYPOWER. With the assistance of its new sponsor, LMQ moved to North America to take advantage of the superior esports infrastructure. At this point, Dreams and Wayoff left the team, to be replaced by Royal Club top laner GoDlike, who renamed to ackerman. While competing in the second Challenger Series, LMQ was also offered an invite to the North American Challenger League (NACL) Season 2 Qualifiers, where they went undefeated and secured a spot in the league. During the league's regular season, LMQ went 18‚Äì4 without a losing record against any team. During the March playoffs, LMQ defeated Cloud 9 Tempest 2‚Äì1 in the semifinals and moved on to face Team 8 in the tournament's grand finals. LMQ won the final series 3‚Äì1 and became NACL champions. After having secured a spot in the semi-finals of the Challenger Series playoffs due to their tremendous number of points accumulated from both Challenger Series, LMQ went on to defeat Curse Academy in a 2‚Äì0 victory sending them to the finals against the tough Cloud 9 Tempest. After an initial loss in the best of five series, LMQ came back winning two in a row to make the series 2‚Äì1. Cloud 9 Tempest however, bounced back in game four to tie up the series 2‚Äì2. After a very low-kill game game five, Cloud 9 Tempest attempt to make a pick, but instead gets nearly aced and loses the game to LMQ.

In the LCS, LMQ made an immediate impact, opening with a 4‚Äì0 week. Despite some relative floundering in the mid-season, LMQ found themselves back on top of the standings entering the last week of play. With a 2‚Äì2 week to end the season, LMQ dropped to second beneath Cloud 9. Although the two teams had the same 18‚Äì10 record, Cloud 9 held the tiebreaker with a 3‚Äì1 season head-to- head record against LMQ. Nevertheless, LMQ entered the NA LCS Summer Playoffs with the second seed and a first round bye. In playoffs, the team fell to Team SoloMid 2‚Äì3 in a close series. They played against Team Curse in the 3rd place match and started off 0‚Äì2 but pulled off a reverse sweep and won the series 3‚Äì2. This qualified them for the 2014 World Championship where they were placed in Group C with Samsung Galaxy Blue, Fnatic and OMG.

The games allow players to control several unique species of sharks, including mako sharks, great white sharks, hammerhead sharks, reef sharks, megamouth shark and Megalodon. To progress, the player must consume other marine animals and grow in size until the next, more powerful shark is available for purchase. In May 2016, Hungry Shark World was downloaded 10 million times in six days, reaching the top 10 free iPhone and Android apps. In 2018, Hungry Shark World was released for the Xbox One, PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch. It featured better graphics, and the complete removal of micro transactions. Editions of Hungry Shark =Hungry Shark Trilogy (2010‚Äì2011)= * _Hungry Shark: Part 1_ The first game in the trilogy and the first in the series. * _Hungry Shark: Part 2_ A sequel to the previous game. * _Hungry Shark: Part 3_ The final game in the trilogy. * _Hungry Shark: Trilogy_ re-release A compilation of the first 3 games, updated with HD graphics = _Hungry Shark: Night_ (2011) = The final game to be published solely by Future Games of London. = _Hungry Shark Evolution_ (2012)= The first Hungry Shark game originally released by Future Games of London in 2012 and later published by Ubisoft in 2013 after the studio was officially acquired by the latter. = _Hungry Shark World_ (2015)= A sequel to Hungry Shark Evolution, reached 50 million downloads on Google Play Store. The game includes 33 of new sharks and many returning ones. The game is still being updated today. = _Hungry Shark VR_ (2017)= A version of Hungry Shark that is in VR and runs on Google Daydream. = _Hungry Dragon_ (2018)= A spinoff of Hungry Shark, where the player controls a flying dragon. And it's not made with Future Games of London but with Ubisoft Barcelona Mobile.  Gameplay  Hungry Shark revolves around the player, a lone shark, consuming various marine species to grow in size until the subsequent, more powerful sharks are unlocked. The number of species the player is able to consume depends on the strength of the shark; for instance, a Reef Shark cannot eat Lionfish, but a Great White Shark is able to, or a Megamouth Shark (Hungry Shark World) is unable to eat small mines, but a megalodon is able to. Not all creatures can be consumed, and some are hostile towards the shark. As the player progresses, the hazards posed to them increase; helicopters may begin dropping explosive barrels into the sea, or fisherman may seek out the player in an attempt to end their frenzy. In addition to these foes, the shark's health constantly deteriorates and can only be restored when food is consumed; if the player goes without food for too long, the shark will die. Each shark possesses a unique ability (such as freezing breath or a boost) that can be upgraded. Like many other mobile games, the Hungry Shark series offers each game for free but charges real world money for additional gold (which can be acquired by playing the game) and gems (which can also be collected in the game). This freemium model has been met with criticism from some journalists. Accolades Hungry Shark World was nominated for \\"Best Casual Game\\" at The Independent Game Developers' Association Awards 2018.

The small, pretty thick shell is elongated and conical. It is formed of six distinct, slightly convex whorls. The surface of the upper whorls appears to be shagreened by very small tubercles, formed by a multitude of very approximate longitudinal folds and transverse striae. Upon the lowest whorls the longitudinal folds disappear, and the transverse striae, on the contrary, become more apparent. The simple suture is accompanied by a small, very narrow scaffolding, formed by a row of granulations, a little larger, and like papillae. The whitish aperture is subrotund. The outer lip is smooth at its edge, and striated internally. The columella is arcuated and smooth. The general color of this shell is of a uniform red brown.Kiener (1840).

Created as a Star vehicle for lead actor Martin Kemp, only one series was commissioned owing to the show not achieving the ratings expected by the network, despite a consistent consolidated viewing audience of between 6-7 million. A total of six episodes were broadcast. The complete series has since been released for streaming on YouTube by production company All3Media on 8 April 2011.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eu_xnbzXzP0 Plot Jack (Martin Kemp) and Tony Finn (Joe Duttine) are two brothers working together in the same division of the National Serious and Organised Crime Unit. Being the only officers of their kind, they are feared by colleagues and criminals alike. Jack, however, is leading a secret double life ‚Äî having fallen in love with Tony's wife Rachel (Esther Hall). Forced to put their personal differences aside for the sake of their profession, Jack and Tony investigate the likes of crime families, Triads, gangland killings, extortion and major drug suppliers, all whilst trying to battle with their own demons. The series begins with the arrival of a new boss, DI Dennis Clifton (Danny Sapani), who replaces the outgoing DI Kitchen (Sidney Livingstone). Clifton immediately makes it clear that he will not stand for any nonsense, and is determined to lead the unit his way. Alongside the Finn brothers are DC Joanna Granger (Emily Bruni) and DC Graham Reid (James Hillier). During the team's second case, it transpires that Reid has secret connections to a gangland murderer, forcing him to go on the run. Granger also finds herself under the spotlight after embarking on an affair with Tony Finn, which subsequently sparks a relationship between Jack Finn and his brother's wife, Rachel. DC Pete Gordon (Mark Leadbetter) is a junior member of the team who also assists the Finn brothers on various cases. Production Valerie Lilley was initially announced to play the part of Jeannie Finn, Jack and Tony's mother. However, Lilley pulled out shortly before filming began, forcing every episode to be partially re-written. Her part was not re-cast. Although credited on IMDb, Lilley did not appear in the series. D.C. Pete Gordon (Mark Leadbetter) is also sometimes erroneously referred to as D.C. Pete Burns, but was never credited as such in the series. Danny Dyer, Nina Sosanya, Neil Stuke and Amanda Mealing all guest starred in the series. Cast * Martin Kemp as D.C. Jack Finn, senior detective * Joe Duttine as D.C.

The church is built on a small hill, the Hundisburg.  History  The history of St. Stephen's dates back to the seventh century. The foundation of the church may be connected with the Christianization campaign of bishop Kunibert of Cologne in the seventh century. In 1247 Nijmegen came under the control of Count Otto II of Gelredome. For strategic reasons, St. Stephen's was moved from the Kelfkensbos to its current location on the Hundisburg. The present church was consecrated in 1273 by Albertus Magnus. Administratively, St. Stephen's fell under the authority of the chapter of the Basilica of the Holy Apostles, Cologne. The church has long been the only parish in the city. The building was expanded several times in the thirteenth to sixteenth centuries, including an impressive ambulatory. Pope Pius IV authorized the establishment of its own chapter, in 1475, making St. Stephen's independent of Cologne. In 1591 Saint Stephen's was converted to a Protestant church after the city was captured from the Spanish (during which the steeple was severely damaged), which it has remained since except for a Catholic interlude around 1670. Catherine of Bourbon was buried in the St. Stephen's Church, in 1469. Her son, Charles of Gelre, paid to have a monument to her placed in the church, which remains to this day. In 1810 is by royal decree the church property was transferred to the Reformed Church; the civil community retained the ownership of the tower, as part of the city defenses. The church was severely damaged by the bombing of 1944, but was rebuilt until 1969. In 2001 the church received two stained- glass windows of Marc Mulders entitled Pelican and Stigmata. Current use Today St. Stephen's Church is mainly used for weekly ecumenical church organ concerts on the famous K√∂nig organ, exhibitions, cantus of the HRG Achelous, and orations.

Grand Vizier Koca Sinan Pasha, the main commander of the Ottoman army, ordered for the relics to be brought from Mile≈°eva to Belgrade, where he set them on fire on 27 April. Monk Niƒáifor of the Fenek monastery wrote that \\"there was great violence carried out against the clergy and devastation of monasteries\\". The Ottomans sought to symbolically and really, set fire to the Serb determination of freedom, which had become growingly noticeable. The event, however, sparked an increase in rebel activity, until the suppression of the uprising in 1595. It is believed that his left hand was saved; it is currently held at Mile≈°eva. The burning of Saint Sava's relics () is a Serbian Orthodox religious holiday venerated on 27 April (10 May Gregorian). Archbishop Sava founded the Serbian Orthodox Church, Serbian ecclesiastical law and national literature. He was canonized as a miracle-worker and his religious cult was assimilated into folk beliefs in Ottoman times. The veneration of his relics created tension between Serbs and the occupying Ottomans. In 1774, Sava was proclaimed the patron saint of all Serbs. In the 19th century the cult was revived in the context of nationalism with the prospect of independence from the Ottomans, \\"representing and reproducing powerful images of a national Golden Age, of national reconciliation and unification, and of martyrdom for the church and nation\\". After Serbia gained full independence, a cathedral dedicated to the saint was planned, part of modernization plans of Belgrade. Although the construction board for the church was established in 1895, the construction of the winning concept, based on Graƒçanica and Hagia Sophia, began in 1935. Construction stopped during World War II and the Communist rule, only to be restarted after permission in 1984; as of 2010, the exterior is finished and interior unfinished., The site where Saint Sava's relics were burnt, the Vraƒçar plateau, became the new grounds of the National Library of Serbia and the Church of Saint Sava dedicated to the saint, in the 20th century. From its location, the church dominates Belgrade's cityscape, and has become a national symbol.

She is \\"a strong candidate as the first Scottish woman photographer\\" and one of the first women anywhere to be involved in photography. Biography Mann was born on 20 January 1805, in Perth, Scotland, the daughter of a house painter. She grew up there with her four sisters and one brother. When her father died in 1839 she moved to Edinburgh with her two unmarried sisters, Elizabeth and Margaret, to live with their brother Alexander, a solicitor. Mann worked in the Hill & Adamson studio, Scotland's first photographic studio in \\"Rock House\\", on Calton Hill, Edinburgh for at least three years, until it closed after Adamson's death in 1848. She went on to become a school housekeeper in Musselburgh. She returned to Edinburgh and died there of a stroke on 21 April 1867. She is buried at Rosebank Cemetery. It is reasoned that a print in the Scottish National Portrait Gallery, of the King of Saxony in 1844, taken at the studio while Hill and Adamson were unavailable, was taken by Mann. The portrait was known to have been taken by an assistant to Hill and Adamson. Tate curator Carol Jacobi says this demonstrates that \\"she must have been part of their skilful understanding of how you set up a photograph, so she is a real pioneer.\\" A letter from the painter James Naysmith to Hill, written in 1845, praises Mann as \\"that most skillful and zealous of assistants\\". Mann was included in the 2016 exhibition at Tate Britain, Painting with Light: Art and Photography from the Pre-Raphaelites to the Modern Age.

History The Gr√£o-Par√° Ecological Station was established by state decree 2609 of 4 December 2006, signed by the state governor Sim√£o Jatene. The unit was announced by Jatene in a ceremony that announced nine conservation areas, mostly in northern Par√° that occupy a total of about . Others included the Maicuru Biological Reserve, the Paru, Trombetas, Faro and Iriri state forests and the Triunfo do Xingu Environmental Protection Area. Creation of the protected areas was expected to reduce deforestation, mining and consequent mercury contamination of water, poaching, irregular farming and other threats. Within two months of creation of the strictly protected unit it was reported that the Rio Tinto mining company was seeking approval to have excluded from the unit. The miner had been prospecting for bauxite near the headwaters of the Curu√° River, and thought there might be a huge deposit. It seemed unlikely that the permission would be given since this would throw into doubt the state's entire environmental plan. In 2007, the Par√° Secretary of State for the Environment signed a Term of Technical Cooperation with the Museu Paraense Em√≠lio Goeldi, Forest Development Institute of Par√°, Institute of Man and Environment, Conservation International and the German Technical Cooperation Agency. These institutions worked together to develop the management plan for the implementation of the reserve, published in 2011. The Management Plan is based on the general objectives for a conservation unit, and establishes standards for use of the area and management of natural resources, including implementation of the physical structures needed to manage the unit. Environment The Gr√£o-Par√° Ecological Station covers dissected plateaus with altitudes from . Most of the region has altitudes of .

The terrain is rugged, with no access roads or fully navigable rivers. The unit can be reached only by helicopter or light air plane using improvised landing strips. It is known that indigenous people access it through the Trombetas and Erepecuru river regions. The Gr√£o-Par√° Ecological Station is in the Amazon biome. It has a tropical monsoon climate. Temperatures range from and are usually between . Average annual rainfall is from , with heaviest rains on the December‚ÄìMay period when monthly precipitation is . Even in the driest months rainfall is above . The unit contains parts of two sub-basins of the Amazon River, the Nhamund√°-Trombetas basin and the Cuminapanema-Maicuru sub-basin. The main rivers of the unit have combined lengths of . The unit is mostly covered with dense submontane rainforest (89.43%) or transitional forest (8.9%), with small areas of cerrado (0.79%) and dense alluvial rainforest (0.01%). Known numbers of species include 125 fish, 62 amphibians, 68 reptiles, 355 birds, 61 mammals, 125 ferns and 653 flowering plants. The natural resources are well preserved. Conservation The Gr√£o-Par√° Ecological Station allows only indirect use of its natural resources, and has the specific purpose of conserving nature and supporting scientific research. Public visits are prohibited except for educational purposes subject to the Management Plan, and scientific research requires prior permission of SEMA/PA.

Led by Gijubhai Badheka and Nanabhai Bhatt, the children's literature expanded rapidly in form of stories, poems, rhymes and riddles. Several authors and poets wrote for children intermittently and exclusively. Large number of magazines catering to children were published by middle of twentieth century.

Route Knossos Palace serves the overnight route Piraeus - Heraklio and Heraklio - Piraeus, except for some rare occasions in which it replaces other ships of Minoan Lines in their routes. During the holiday season, it occasionally operates during daytime, completing her voyage in 6 hours. Accidents and incidents On November 19, 2003 Knossos Palace was sailing 40 nm northwest of Heraklion en route from Piraeus when a fire broke out on board. The fire was caused by a truck in the vessel's garage that was carrying chemicals. The crew swiftly dealt with the emergency and the fire was put out using the sprinkler system before causing major damage. However, the fire damaged the cables powering the passenger drawbridge, which became inoperable. As a result, an airport staircase had to be brought to the port in order to allow safe disembarkation.

He scored twice in 17 senior appearances, of which 15 were in the league, before returning to the north of England to join Carlisle United of the Fourth Division on 2 March 1959 for a ¬£1500 fee. He made his debut the following day, and scored twice as Carlisle beat Oldham Athletic 3‚Äì0. He continued as a regular in the first team, scoring 58 goals from 177 appearances in all competitions (53 from 164 in the league). Walker was the club's top scorer in both 1960‚Äì61 and 1961‚Äì62, when the team went into the last two matches of the season in sixth place, two points outside the promotion positions. He scored both goals in a 2‚Äì1 win at Doncaster Rovers and the first in a 2‚Äì0 win at home to Chester that gave Carlisle the four points they needed to overtake Bradford City and York City and make sure of their first ever promotion. His Carlisle career was ended when he broke his leg playing in a reserve match, although he was able to go back into non-league football with Morecambe. Walker settled in the Carlisle area, where he and former teammate Ginger Thompson went into the building trade. They also founded a football club, Carlisle City, in 1975 \\"to give local lads somewhere to play\\". Walker was married to Val; the couple had three sons. He died of leukaemia in Cumberland Infirmary, Carlisle, in 2012 at the age of 78.

The act was signed into law by President Barack Obama on May 11, 2016. It underscored Congress‚Äôs desire to align closely with the Uniform Trade Secrets Act, which had been adopted in some form in almost every U.S. state. Technically, the DTSA extended the Economic Espionage Act of 1996, which criminalizes certain trade secret misappropriations. The law also grants legal immunity to corporate whistleblowers. After the DTSA's passage by the Senate, Forbes magazine called the law the \\"Biggest Development in [Intellectual Property] in Years\\".  Notable cases  The first judicial decision under the DTSA was Henry Schein, Inc. v. Cook, in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, on June 10, 2016. In that decision, U.S. District Court Judge Jon S. Tigar granted the first temporary restraining order under the DTSA prohibiting an ex-employee from soliciting customers of the plaintiff. The first verdict under the act came in Dalmatia Import Group, Inc. v. FoodMatch Inc. et al.,Dalmatia Import Group, Inc. v. FoodMatch Inc. et al., no. 16-cv-02767 (E.D. Pa. Feb. 24, 2017). on February 25, 2017. In that case, a federal jury awarded Dalmatia $2.5 million for misappropriation of trade secrets, trademark infringement and counterfeiting, $500,000 of which was allocated to the DTSA claim. The trade secrets claim was based on Foodmatch's misappropriation of Dalmatia's fig jam recipe.

Early life His father, the drama critic Milton Shulman, and mother, journalist Drusilla Beyfus, were married in 1956. They had three children: Alexandra, Nicola, and Jason. While Jason was growing up, the Shulman family lived in Belgravia. He returned to Haggerston and attended school. Career Shulman worked as a graphic designer for The Sunday Telegraph and an art director for Harpers & Queen and Harvey Nichols' magazines. Two years after quitting his job as an Art Director, Shulman had his first gallery show in 2006 at the Madder Rose gallery near London's Old Street. Ten of the pieces concerned the painkiller Solpadeine, and one piece in particular was made using his father's ashes in stratified, magnetised, colour-coded layers. Regarding the pills, Shulman remarked, \\"They're the ones that just about give you the strength to get out of the bath in the morning. I wanted to say thank you.\\" In 2009, he participated in the Third Moscow Biennale of contemporary art. During the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics, Shulman focused a camera on his television and took long exposure photos of the athletes in motion. Since most of what he recorded was short, he imagined what might happen if he shot longer stretches of action. In 2015, the artist presented himself (along with dogs, drinks, and vintage porn) at Soho's Door Gallery in a \\"secretive\\" installation. In 2016 at the Cob Gallery, Shulman exhibited his Photographs of Films, a series of photographs which capture the entire duration of a movie (minus titles and credits) in a single exposure. Shulman spoke of the photographs: \\"There are roughly 130,000 frames in a 90 minute film and every frame of each film is recorded in these photographs. You could take all these frames and shuffle them like a deck of cards, and no matter the shuffle, you would end up with the same image I have arrived at. Essentially each of these photographs show the genetic code of the film.\\". Personal life He is married to writer Susan Irvine.

Stadtman, Berkeley Public Policy Press, 2002, pp. 129, 135-136 The origins of Cal Performances date from 1906, when stage actress Sarah Bernhardt appeared at the William Randolph Hearst Greek Theatre to help rebuild public morale after the devastating San Francisco earthquake and fire in April of that year. Cal Performances presents over 100 performances annually in five venues‚ÄîZellerbach Hall, Zellerbach Playhouse, Hertz Hall, and Wheeler Hall on the UC Berkeley campus, and First Congregational Church of Berkeley‚Äîand in site-specific locations and other spaces. The performances range among Modern and Classical Dance, Theater, Instrumental and Vocal Recital, Early Music, Opera, Chamber Music, Jazz, New Music, World Music, Dance & Theater, and a speaking series. Cal Performances serves some 150,000 patrons annually through performances and arts education, residency and community programs.  Mission Statement  The mission of Cal Performances is to produce and present performances of the highest artistic quality, enhanced by programs that explore compelling intersections of education and the performing arts.  History  Cal Performances is the performing arts presenting, commissioning and producing organization based at the University of California, Berkeley. The origins of Cal Performances date from 1906, when stage actress Sarah Bernhardt appeared at the William Randolph Hearst Greek Theater to help rebuild public morale after the devastating San Francisco earthquake and fire in April of that year. Over the subsequent century, Cal Performances grew to become the largest, multi-discipline performing arts presenter in Northern California, and one of the largest university-based arts presenters in the United States. = Founding and Early Expansion = The San Francisco earthquake and fire of April 18, 1906 proved momentous to the rise of this arts institution in Berkeley. Sarah Bernhardt‚Äôs landmark performance in Racine‚Äôs Ph√®dre on May 17, 1906, was a testament to the restorative powers of the performing arts for the thousands of citizens who had been impacted by the earthquake, and the atmosphere of expectancy surrounding the appearance of ‚ÄúThe Divine Sarah‚Äù was rewarded by her decision to donate the proceeds of her performance to the Emergency Relief Fund. Bernhardt‚Äôs wild popularity combined with the Greek Theatre‚Äôs spectacular design and atmosphere, set in motion the tradition of performing arts presentation in Berkeley. In the words of theater director Samuel Hume, it was the event that ‚Äúplaced the Greek Theatre definitely in the field of the commercial theatre.‚Äù William Dallam Armes, Chair of the Musical and Dramatic Committee, realized that the Theatre‚Äôs large seating area (of about 6,500) made it economically feasible to invite big-name artists of national and international standing such as Bernhardt. Major stars of the time such as Margaret Anglin and Maude Adams brought notoriety to the campus through the Hearst Greek Theatre, in conjunction; the theatre also burnished their reputations as well. Soon after the Greek Theatre opened, University faculty and administration realized the need for a smaller stage suited to productions requiring an intimate setting. In 1917, the campus gained a 1,050-seat (now reduced to 700) auditorium with the opening of Wheeler Hall, in the heart of the university campus. Wheeler Hall‚Äôs auditorium immediately became a vital performance venue overseen by the Musical and Dramatic Committee, where it was possible to increase the variety of chamber music and recital programs offered, as well as drama, lectures and other entertainments. Though members of the Drama, Music and Dance departments realized that Wheeler Auditorium was not the ideal venue for the performing arts on all occasions, several uncompleted projects and, later, the financial strains of The Great Depression delayed the completion of a venue designed for such performances. The opening of Alfred Hertz Memorial Hall in 1958, with its formidable collection of organs and superior acoustics, was marked by the May T. Morrison Music Festival, a presentation of 11 programs between April 15 and May 22, 1958, presented by the Committee on Drama, Lectures and Music. Music critic Alfred Frankenstein claimed Hertz Hall to be the finest auditorium in California. = 1960s-present = Seeing that Wheeler Auditorium and Hertz Hall were not suited for presenting drama and dance, Zellerbach Hall was built in 1968. Zellerbach Hall consists of two main theaters: the 2,015-seat Auditorium (today known as Zellerbach Hall) and the 500-seat, multiform Playhouse. The Playhouse was conceived as a laboratory in which students can learn all aspects of the dramatic arts. Movable seating allows for numerous formations of the stage. The stage of the Auditorium is equipped for all major forms of theater, opera, music and dance productions, and, with the aid of a movable acoustic shell, the magnitude of the stage can be scaled back to suit chamber or recital music programs. Zellerbach has become Cal Performances‚Äô main venue for presenting various genres of the performing arts as well as lecture events, and is one of the most well-appointed theaters in the United States.  Artists Presented  Traditional and non-traditional artists regularly appear on or near the UC Berkeley campus in the theaters and concert halls managed by Cal Performances, including Mikhail Baryshnikov, Wynton Marsalis, Cecilia Bartoli, Bryn Terfel, Mark Morris, Yo-Yo Ma, Philip Glass, Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, Merce Cunningham, Pina Bausch, Bill T. Jones, Peter Sellars, and Robert Lepage; as well as artists based in the San Francisco Bay Area like John Adams, Lou Harrison, Margaret Jenkins, Paul Dresher, Kronos Quartet, Joe Goode, Kaila Flexer, Jon Jang, and Sarah Cahill. Cal Performances is also instrumental in facilitating the touring of large ensembles from abroad, and has hosted such companies as the Grand Kabuki Theater of Japan, the Bolshoi and Kirov Ballet companies, Lyon Opera Ballet and Orchestra, the Kirov Orchestra, the Russian National Orchestra, the Berliner Ensemble, the Beijing People‚Äôs Art Theater, the Gate Theater of Dublin, Les Arts Florissants, Ballet Nacional de Cuba, and Nederland Dans Theater, among others.  Current Leadership  Jeremy N. Geffen is the current Executive and Artistic Director of Cal Performances. Geffen came to Berkeley in April 2019 from Carnegie Hall, where he held the position of Senior Director and Artistic Adviser. During his 12 years there, Geffen was instrumental in designing and directing visionary artistic projects, built deep and meaningful connections with artists and collaborators, cultivated community partnerships, and aided in the expansion of the organization‚Äôs rich educational offerings. As part of Carnegie Hall‚Äôs artistic planning team he led program planning and thematic development for the approximately 160 performances each season at Carnegie Hall, as well as the creation of a wide range of audience engagement programs. Geffen oversaw the expansion of Carnegie Hall festivals including a series of concerts dedicated to the impact of large-scale migrations on American culture. Prior to his appointment at Carnegie Hall, Geffen was Vice President of Artistic Administration for the St. Louis Symphony Orchestra (2005‚Äì07) and Artistic Administrator of the New York Philharmonic (2000‚Äì05). Geffen serves on numerous advisory boards and frequently adjudicates international competitions. He chaired the nominating jury for the 2013 Pulitzer Prize in Music, awarding the honor to Caroline Shaw, then the youngest recipient in the prize‚Äôs history. In June 2015, he received Bang on a Can‚Äôs Visionary Award at the organization‚Äôs annual gala, and in April 2019, he was honored at S≈ç Percussion‚Äôs annual benefit. Geffen provides the overall artistic vision and executive leadership for Cal Performances, with direct decision-making authority and responsibility for planning all programs, functions, and activities of Cal Performances and Student Musical Activities. This encompasses initiating and commissioning new artistic and educational ventures, including those in association with national and international performing arts centers and festivals, and supporting the educational and research mission of the university through the performing arts program. He also works closely with Cal Performances‚Äô board of trustees.

Brazil is a leading producer of animal products, and its allowance of intensive animal farming methods such as extreme confinement make farm animal welfare a major concern. Compared to other countries, Brazil also uses large numbers of animals for fur and research. Recent years have seen several welfare reforms by the government and major meat producers.  Regulations  Brazil's first animal welfare law was a 1924 decree prohibiting \\"carrying out any behavior or recreation that cause[s] suffering to animals.\\" A more comprehensive 1934 decree stipulated that animals not be overworked or kept where they cannot breathe properly, move, or rest, or are deprived of air or light, and that animals be given a quick death (whether or not they are for human consumption). The decree also prohibits abandoning a sick, injured or mutilated animal and failing to provide an animal with \\"all that is necessary\\", including veterinary assistance. Lawyers from the Public Ministry or from animal protection organizations are allowed to assist animals in court, giving animals a degree of legal standing which they lack in many countries such as the United States. Brazil's constitution (1988) states that the government must protect animals from cruelty. In 1997 this constitutional protection was invoked in a historic decision by the Brazilian Supreme Court to uphold a ban on Farra do Boi, a festival involving the torture and killing of bulls and oxen in the state of Santa Catarina. A 1998 law prohibits the abuse of domestic and wild animals. It imposes more serious penalties for cruelty than the 1934 decree, with a sentence of 3 months to a year plus a fine, with the penalty increased by one- sixth to one-third if the animal is killed. A 2012 update to the Penal Code increased the penalty for cruelty from 3 months-1 year to 1‚Äì4 years, and up to 6 years if the animal is killed. The 1998 does not specifically address farm animals. A 2000 Normative Instruction regulates pre-slaughter handling and slaughter methods, stating handling must minimize stress and forbids the use of \\"aggressive instruments in slaughter\\". 2008 instructions establish procedures for rearing and transporting animals and provide for the production of Manuals of Good Practice (whose adoption is voluntary). In that year the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock, and Food Supply established the Permanent Technical Commission of Animal Welfare, whose tasks include the promotion of animal welfare-related events, the training of those involved in the livestock chain, and the publication and dissemination of technical material on animal welfare. Birds, which make up the large majority of land animals slaughtered for food in Brazil, are exempt from laws governing transport or export that affect animal welfare. In 2008 Brazil passed its first federal regulation specifically addressing animals in scientific research. The 2008 law provides for the creation of a National Animal Control and Experimentation Committee and institutional Ethical Committees on Animal Use, which are to follow the principles of the Three Rs: replacement of animals with non-animal methods, reduction of the number of animals used, and refinement of techniques used on animals. In 2014, Brazil banned most animal cosmetics testing, though testing ingredients with unknown effects on animals is allowed, as is testing on animals in other countries and selling the resulting products in Brazil. In 2014, Brazil received a C out of possible grades A,B,C,D,E,F,G on World Animal Protection's Animal Protection Index.  Animals used for food  = Animal agriculture = A 2014 source states that Brazil has the world's second- largest cattle herd (behind India) at 187 million animals. In 2009 Brazil had the fourth-largest chicken population (behind China, the U.S., and Indonesia) at around 1.2 billion. A 2012 report states that Brazil is the fifth-largest producer of pig meat, fourth-largest producer of turkey meat, third-largest producer of chicken meat, and second-largest producer of cattle meat. A 2014 source states that Brazil is the second-largest fish consumer in the world (behind Japan) at 12 kg per person per year. Brazil produces about 1.25 million tons of fish per year, with around 38% coming from aquaculture.  Intensive animal farming  Brazilian animal farms have been shifting towards a confinement model. Battery cages, gestation crates, and veal crates - systems of extreme confinement - are legal in Brazil. At any given time, there are over 70 million egg-laying hens living in battery cages and almost 1.5 million breeding sows in gestation crates. In 2014, BRF - Brazil's largest pork producer - committed to phasing out the continuous use of gestation crates from its supply chain by 2026. In 2015, JBS - the world's largest animal protein processing company - announced plans to phase out all use of gestation crates at company-owned facilities by 2016, and the Brazilian Pork Producers Association announced that it will lead a study concerning a transition to higher-welfare group housing systems.  Transport  The welfare of animals in transport is a major issue. Brazil is the world's leading exporter of live cattle and chicken Exported animals face severe welfare threats, as highlighted by the 2012 incident in which 2700 cattle died in the heat on a vessel attempting to unload at ports in the Middle East. Transport within Brazil is also a problem. Poor road conditions and weather often make journeys to the slaughterhouse last sixty or more hours, leading to extreme stress and death for the animals.  Government involvement  The government actively encourages the growth of the animal agriculture industry. From 2007-2009 the Brazilian National Development Bank invested $2.65 billion in the country's three largest beef suppliers. In 2010, the Agriculture and Livestock Plan doubled the credits available to the industry. In 2012, the government announced a plan to invest $2 billion until 2014 \\"to double catches and reach two million tons of fish annually.\\" = Vegetarianism and veganism = In a 2012 survey of Brazilians, approximately 8% of respondents identified as vegetarian. The percentage of vegetarians was higher among those 65‚Äì75 years old (10%) than those aged 20‚Äì24 (7%). The study did not measure the number of vegans.  Animals used for clothing  Brazil is one of the biggest producers of chinchilla fur in the world. In 2014 the state of Sao Paulo banned most fur farming, imposing a fine of at least 10,000 reais (approximately 2880 USD) for offenders.  Animals used in science  A total of 3,497,653 animals were used in research published in 18 journals in the State of Paran√° in 2006. From this the authors conclude that \\"it can be extrapolated that, in the whole of Brazil, the total number of animals used every year is extremely high in terms of the worldwide use of animals in experimentation.\\"  Animal personhood  In 2005, a writ of habeas corpus was requested for Su√≠√ßa, a chimpanzee caged in allegedly inadequate conditions at a zoo. The court agreed to hear the case, but Suica died before a decision could be made. According to Gordilho, \\"This was the first case that recognised a chimpanzee as a plaintiff that achieved standing in a court of law through representatives.\\" Several years earlier, a habeas corpus petition to release a caged bird had been dismissed. Aftermath, these activists founded a peer- reviewed open access academic journal, which is named as Brazilian Animal Law Journal (In Portuguese: Revista Brasileira de Direito Animal). This journal is the first academic journal of Latin America specialized in Animal Law.  Animal activism  According to World Animal Protection, Brazil has \\"a thriving animal protection movement dating back to the 19th century.\\" Two Brazilian groups were represented at the 1910 International Congress of animal protection organizations in Washington, D.C. (compared with much larger delegations from Europe, the U.S., and Canada). The Brazilian No More Cruelty! movement is aimed at increasing sentences for animal cruelty. In January 2012, in over 150 cities thousands of protesters marched under the No More Cruelty! slogan. On Paulista Avenue, S√£o Paulo alone there were 10,000 protesters. Later that year, changes to the Penal Code included an increase in the penalty for cruelty from 3 months-1 year to 1‚Äì4 years, and up to 6 years if the animal is killed. Sentences of 1‚Äì4 years were assigned to neglect and abandonment, promoting or participating in cockfighting was given up to 6 years. In 2013, No More Cruelty! protests were again held in over 165 cities. Domestic animal protection organizations include ProAnima, which focuses on ending the use of animals in circuses and horse carting and stopping the slaughter of street dogs and cats, and F√≥rum Nacional de Prote√ß√£o e Defesa Animal, which addresses a range of companion and farm animal issues. Both were involved in the Be Cruelty-Free Brazil campaign to ban cosmetics testing. Humane Society International is active in Brazil, having led the Be Cruelty-Free Brazil campaign which resulted in the partial ban on cosmetics testing and working with civil societies to promote Meatless Monday.

Personal life Lazar was born in Brooklyn to Orthodox Jewish parents. His family moved to a ranch in the San Fernando Valley in Los Angeles when Lazar was young. By the time he was 12, Lazar was keeping the books for his father's accounting business. He graduated from Los Angeles High School in 1943, took a job at Lockheed, and enrolled pre-law at University of California, Berkeley. He was drafted into the Army Air Corps, served two years, and then returned to his studies. In 1949, he graduated from Berkeley with a degree in economics, and in 1951, from University of Southern California with a law degree. His first marriage ended in divorce. His second marriage, to Alyce Lou, lasted until his death. He has three children from his two marriages. Entertainment law Early on in Lazar's career he specialized entertainment law. His clients included Bob Dylan, Miles Davis, Joni Mitchell, Lenny Bruce, and the Beatles. He dated Maya Angelou when she was working as a cabaret singer. She later stated that he helped launch her career as a poet. Stock trading In the 1960s, Lazar began investing in oil wells in Texas and Louisiana, a Spanish- language newspaper, timberland in Indonesia, and stocks. According to New York Magazine, he became \\"the single largest individual stock trader during the sixties\\", buying and selling more tham $300 million in stocks in 1967 alone. Most of these investments were related to mergers and acquisitions. He had a few big losses, including a proposed merger between Armour and General Host (owner of Frank's Nursery & Crafts) that fell through in 1969. The Mormon will In 1976, Lazar joined a group that was trying to prove that a will found in the headquarters of the Latter Day Saints in Salt Lake City was the final will of Howard Hughes. Lazar invested $250,000 in the investigation. A Nevada jury ruled that the will was a fake. Milberg Weiss kickback scheme Lazar developed a professional relationship with Milberg Weiss, a New York law firm known for handling class-action lawsuits. Over a period of about 25 years, he and members of his family participated, as plaintiffs, in over 50 class-action suits against companies like Hertz and United Airlines. In 2005, a federal investigation of these activities led to an indictment against Lazar for taking $2.6 million in kickbacks from Milberg Weiss. He was charged with mail fraud and money-laundering. In 2007, Lazar plead guilty to obstruction of justice, filing a false tax return and making a false declaration; he was sentenced to six months of home detention and ordered to pay a $600,000 fine, on top of a previously ordered $1.5 million forfeiture. Lazar died at his home in Palm Springs in 2016. In 2016, Lazar's daughter, Tara Lazar, opened a speakeasy in Palm Springs and named it Seymour's after her father.

Biography  Morrison was born in Richmond, Surrey to father Thomas Morrison (1834‚Äì1901), son of a Scottish innkeeper who worked as a copper and metal broker in Spain and elsewhere, a wealthy company director, and mother Judith Wakefield Morrison (1856 ‚Äì 1924), from Lincolnshire, from an illiterate labourer's family. Due to her father's work involving travel, Morrison's early education to the age of 15 was in four different countries, at five schools before she studied at Manchester High School for Girls from 1904 to 1907,Elizabeth Cruickshank and Carrie de Silva, 'Morrison [married name Appelbe], Carrie (1888‚Äì1950)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2018 and awarded an exhibition. Morrison went on to graduate in 1910, again with an exhibition, from Girton College, Cambridge with First Class Honours in Modern and Medieval Languages Tripos, but she was not allowed a degree because she was a woman. Morrison languages career was then trying teaching at schools in Penarth, Wales and East Putney, London, then working for MI5 eventually in Constantinople, attached to the Army of the Black Sea, in 1919. Through a contact there, Alfred Baker, Morrison was taken on as clerk and then after the Sex Disqualification (Removal) Act 1919, permitted women to train as solicitors, after the First World War, when attitudes to women and work began to change, and there were 3000 fewer (all male) solicitors than when the war began. Baker sponsored her to take her articles. On qualification as one of the first female solicitors, in 1922, Morrison was interviewed by the Dundee Evening Telegraph (31 October 1922) saying ' Men say the law is too rough and tumble for women, but I have had that in the Permit Office' and also complaining that the cost of qualifying was a more significant barrier to women.  Legal career  In 1922 she and Mary Pickup, Mary Sykes, and Maud Crofts became the first women in England to qualify as solicitors; Morrison was the first of them to finish her articles, and was the first woman admitted to the role of solicitor, at the Supreme Court of England. Morrison worked as a 'Poor Man's Lawyer', providing pro bono or low fee services to people in London's East End, at Toynbee Hall. In 1927, she married fellow solicitor Ambrose Appelbe, who was 15 years her junior, but shared her socialist views. Their non- conformist views led them to be 'watched' by MI5, during the 1930s. Her husband went on to found a firm in London that is still active. Morrison refused to use her married name and petitioned court officials to be refer in court records, to her profession not her marital status. Morrison was said to 'set high standard of determination and dedication to her profession for the women who came after her.' Morrison took on cases which were considered socially challenging, such as acting for prostitutes in court, acted for the Women and Children‚Äôs‚Äô Protection Society and the Becontree Estate protesters in 1932. Keen to see reform of divorce laws, she had a modern attitude to gender equality, and was not supportive of women taking advantage of their husbands nor of men who mistreated their wives. She was said to have taken steps 'to shield her 17 year old male articled clerk from the details of the more brutal and salacious cases that she dealt with.' The Daily Telegraph (26 May 1928) reported the judge Lord Meredith remarked on unusual situation of a divorce decree nisi female petitioner being represented by a woman. Morrison was the first woman to be invited to speak at the Law Society‚Äôs Annual Provincial Meeting in 1931, and spoke on the benefit of dispute resolution and ‚ÄúCourts of Domestic Relations.‚Äù In another well reported divorce case, Blackwell v Blackwell [1943] 2 All ER 579, Morrison unsuccessfully defended a wife whose husband was claiming her dividends from shopping at the Co- operative Society should belong to him. MP Robert Boothby commented on the case that 'if wives were permitted to save money from the housekeeping for their own purposes they would not feed their husbands properly.' On an official form question about 'suffering from any physical disability?' Morrison put 'No, except being a woman'. Although they later divorced, Morrison, unconventionally, continued to work with her ex-husband Applebe professionally, and both were actively involved in the Married Woman's Association. Morrison worked until her death in Broxbourne, Hertford, age 62.England & Wales, National Probate Calendar (Index of Wills and Administrations), 1858-1966, 1973-1995 Her obituary in the local press Herefordshire Mercury, praised 'the generosity and compassion of a complex and at times gruff and eccentric woman'. The 1919 Club for women solicitors, (succeeded by the Association of Women Solicitors) of which she was a founder member kept a minute‚Äôs silence when her death was announced. Morrison is considered a 'trailblazer' in the first century of female lawyers. She was also a Soroptimist.  Legacy  By 1967, 2.7% of solicitors in England were women, by 1997 32% and by the centenary of Morrison's admission to the profession over 52% of qualified solicitors are women. In 1999, Lady Hale became the first female Law Lord, and in 2009 became the first woman to be a Justice of the Supreme Court. Lady Hale became President of the Supreme Court in 2017, stepping down on 10 January 2020.

History  The initial impetus for the establishment of the V√≠tkovice ironworks came Dec. 9, 1828 by Olomouc Archbishop Rudolf. Rudolph's Smelter operation was then launched in mid-September 1830. A year later there was a coke plant. The first blast furnace coke was ignited in 1836, the second two years later. In 1852, it was near the smelter based mine depths.

It is a serious pest of cotton crops, the adults and older nymphs feeding on the emerging bolls and the cotton seeds as they mature, transmitting cotton staining fungi as they do so. Description The nymphs moult five times as they grow. The first and second instar nymphs are orange/red, and the third instar has emerging wingpads and is orange at first, deepening in colour by the second day. The fourth instar is crimson and cylindrical with larger, darker wingpads and the fifth instar is similar, with prominent dark wingpads, black antennae and legs. The adult insect is also crimson, with a pair of black spots on the forewings. The membranous hind wings are concealed under the forewings when the insect is at rest. Males are about in length and females are a little larger. Distribution Dysdercus koenigii is commonly found in India, Pakistan and southeastern Asia. Host plants The species is a pest of cotton crops, although cotton is not its preferred choice of hosts, as it prefers Alcea rosea and Hibiscus. As each host plant ages and becomes unsuitable, the winged adults migrate to new host plants of the same or different species. While migrating, they often feed on nectar from non-host plants and probe fruits with their rostra (beak-like mouthparts). These fruits are often citrus, perhaps because citrus and cotton are often grown in close proximity. Biology The female D. koenigii usually lays three batches of seventy or eighty eggs in damp soil, under plant litter or in crevices. The eggs are oval and creamy-yellow, and take about six days to hatch. The nymphs pass through five instar stages and become winged adults after fifty to sixty days.

The place is known for the Battle of Bhuchar Mori and a memorial site dedicated to it. The annual fair dedicated to the event is organised in July and August. Etymology Bhuchar Mori, a cowherd of Mori branch of Rajput community, used to sit on the plateau while his animals fed on grass. The place was referred to as Bhuchar Mori No Timbo after him. It is said that the bad omens, such as voices of the birds, at the place had foretold about the future battle. Battle of Bhuchar Mori The battle of Bhuchar Mori was fought between the army of Kathiawar led by Nawanagar State and the Mughal army in July 1591 (Vikram Samvat 1648). It was meant to protect Muzaffar Shah III, the last Sultan of Gujarat Sultanate who had taken asylum under Jam Sataji of Nawanagar after his escape from the Mughal emperor Akbar. The Kathiawar army included the armies of Junagadh and Kundla who betrayed Nawanagar and joined the Mughal army at last. The battle led to a large number of casualties on both sides. The battle resulted in the decisive victory of the Mughal army. It is considered the largest battle in the history of Saurashtra. It is often dubbed as the Panipat of Saurashtra. Due to the large number of casualties, in Halar region, the word Bhuchar Mori became almost synonymous with the massacre. Memorial site The paliya or memorial stone of Ajaji is a horse-mounted idol. The paliya with the hand, dedicated to his wife Surajkunwarba, stand south of it. The inscription on the stone can not be read. There is an inscription in the shrine that the memorial site was renovated by Jam Vibhaji and the shrine was constructed by him on the palia of Ajaji.

Description  The painting is an oil on canvas with dimensions of 97 x 140 centimeters. It is in the collection of the National Gallery, in Athens.  Analysis  The scene shows a family mourning for a lost sailor. This is one of the most well-known paintings of Lytras Nikiforos. The common people's customs and their life incidents was a source of inspiration to the painter. The relatives mourn for the lost sailor. They are sitting solemnly, in silence, around his fez. The dull colours, the organization of the interior of the place, and faces indistinct of characteristics express the inner crush of the people as well as the surrounding atmosphere of grief and mourning. The painting, \\"The Dirge in Psara\\", belongs to the era of maturity of Lytras (1888) and, beyond the moral-forming element of mourning, it presents the absent sailor, who is lost forever to the bottom of the sea. This requires a great deal of mental ability and courage for a 19th-century painter to represent the mute void, which replaces a body, with the exception of the red fez. It is yet more tragic the mute mourning of the women at the bright left side of the painting and of the elderly at the dark right side of the threadbare place. The painter's will to symbolize is evident in one more detail: the fallen stool, which represents the end, death.*  References   External links  Category:1888 paintings Category:Psara ","title":"The Dirge in Psara"},{"id":"50523039","text":"18 Wheels of Justice is an American crime drama series that aired from 2000 to 2001 on TNN.

At some point, Speedwell, under the command of Lieutenant Robert Tomlinson, recaptured St Patrick, Harford, master. Tomlinson and Speedwell captured another French privateer on 10 October. Speedwell was about nine leagues south of The Start when she encountered a small French cutter. A chase ensued and after six hours Speedwell captured Les Amis, armed with two brass 6-pounder guns and two swivels, and manned by 18 men.

Heureuse Esperance had thrown eight guns overboard during the chase. Heureuse Espereance was a small vessel with a burthen of 49 tons (bm). The next day,Speedwell and Valiant chased another privateer brig for nine hours (the last hour and ten minutes being a running fight). The British vessels forced the privateer to strike some two miles north of the Swin (sic) Islands. The privateer was Heureux Speculateur, of Granville. She was armed with fourteen 6-pounder guns and had a crew of 58 men under the command of Citizen Louis Joseph Quoniam. She had been cruising for four days but had not taken anything.

Produced by Sivalenka Krishna Prasad's Sridevi Movies, Gentleman features Nani in double role, Nivetha Thomas and Surbhi in the lead roles; it marked Prasad's return to film production after an eight-year hiatus. Srinivas Avasarala, Sreemukhi, and Rohini play supporting roles. The film narrates the story of two women, Aishwarya and Catherine, whose respective lovers, Jayaram \\"Jai\\" Mullapudi and Gautham, are lookalikes. When Gautham dies in an accident, Catherine suspects Jai's role in it and spies on him, which reveals further truths about Jai and the people around him, including Gautham. P. G. Vinda was the film's director of photography. Mani Sharma composed the soundtrack and score; Marthand K. Venkatesh edited the film. Principal photography commenced in November 2015 and lasted until April 2016. Except for a schedule in Kodaikanal, the majority of the film's portions were shot in and around Hyderabad. Produced on a budget of 150 million, Gentleman was released on 17June 2016 in 700 screens globally. It was also the third biggest South Indian film released in the United States to that point in terms of screen- count. Post-release, the film received positive reviews with praise for the performances, Sharma's score, and the scripting. It was commercially successful, grossing a total of 326 million globally, with a distributor share of 177.2 million.  Plot  Aishwarya, the daughter of a wealthy entrepreneur, boards a flight back to Hyderabad from the United States. Catherine, a visual effects designer returning from a month-long workshop, boards the same flight in London. To help pass the time, they share their love stories. Catherine explains that she is in a relationship with Gautham, a graduate who owns an adventure club, and Aishwarya shares that her fianc√© Jayaram \\"Jai\\" Mullapudi is an award-winning entrepreneur who manages his father's company JaiGowri Finance. When Aishwarya and Catherine reach Hyderabad, they are met by Jai and the former's cousin Vamsi. Catherine is shocked to see that Jai is a lookalike of Gautham. After learning from Gautham's mother Yashoda about his death in an accident ten days earlier, she leaves his house grief-stricken. An investigative journalist named Nithya meets her and tells her that she suspects that Gautham was murdered. They initially suspect David, Catherine's uncle, who is admitted to a hospital after an overdose of narcotics. Catherine reaches the hospital only to learn that Jai has kidnapped the comatose David. Nithya uncovers information about a potential accounting scandal in JaiGowri Finance and learns that the suicide of Jai's uncle Mohan and Gautham's accident happened on the same day. Catherine and Nithya decide to spy on Jai. Aishwarya recommends Catherine to Jai for a job in the latter's company, to which he reluctantly agrees. Catherine's presence in the company disturbs Jai, who soon realizes that she is spying on him. Nevertheless, he remains silent. Catherine overhears a conversation between Vamsi and Jai where the former threatens to disclose the latter's involvement in Gautham's murder to the media. She later gains information about the security arrangements of the company by coercing her team leader Sudarshanam. Nithya provides a duplicate of the master key to Jai's cabin. Catherine finds the discharge papers of David and Gautham and a document confirming the transfer of 5 billion from Aishwarya's company. She later leaves for an orphanage where David is being treated and finds him dead. Catherine and Nithya spot Jai running away from the orphanage, which strengthens their suspicions. At a party, Jai is disturbed after observing a growing intimacy between Catherine and Vamsi, an intimacy created by Catherine to provoke Jai. After mustering courage, Jai kills Vamsi and manages to make it look like a road accident. Jai then destroys all the documents Vamsi had been using to blackmail him. The following day, Aishwarya finds Jai's clothes and a photograph of him in Catherine's closet and suspects an illicit relationship between them. After Aishwarya calls off her engagement, Catherine confronts Jai and challenges to unveil his real self as a murderer and fraudster. Initially stoic, an emotional Jai reveals that he is Gautham himself by showing a wrist band Catherine had given him before leaving for London. The couple reconciles and Gautham starts narrating the truth. Vamsi, who is jealous of Jai's success, persuades David, his old friend, to murder him. David agrees, assuming that he is Gautham, whom he considers his rival. Meanwhile, Gautham comes across Jai's photograph in an attempt to find sponsors for his club. He alters his look to resemble Jai and meets Mohan. A dying Mohan reveals that Vamsi coerced him to invest in betting, which resulted in a loss of nearly 5 billion, for which Aishwarya's father Ram Prakash agreed to reimburse him. Meanwhile, David fatally stabs Jai in a warehouse, which is secretly filmed by Vamsi. Gautham reaches the spot and promises Jai to save his company from Vamsi and others. Gautham then places his clothes and wallet along with Jai's body in his car and pushes it into a lake, making it look like an accident. Yashoda helps him with this cover-up, and Gautham begins his new life as Jai. However, Vamsi, who has filmed all the events, edits the visuals and blackmails Gautham. With Catherine spying on him, Gautham had no option but to remain silent to avoid issues with Vamsi. Aishwarya overhears their conversation, and the families mourn Jai's death. A year later, the families of Jai and Aishwarya attend an award ceremony where Aishwarya is adjudged the best entrepreneur of the year. She dedicates the award to the deceased Jai, as Gautham and Catherine watch teary-eyed.

Indraganti stated that he had long been keen on making a film based on that concept, adding that it would be a completely new genre for him. Sivalenka Krishna Prasad agreed to bankroll the film, marking his comeback to film production after a sabbatical of eight years. Prasad urged Indraganti to listen to a script written by Tamil writer R. David Nathan. Indraganti found Nathan's script too alien for the Telugu-speaking audience and tweaked it to suit the regional sensibilities. He later revealed that the film would be a romantic thriller and dedicated its second half to filmmaker Alfred Hitchcock as a tribute. R. David Nathan was credited with providing the story and scenario, while Indraganti penned the screenplay and the dialogue besides co-writing the script. P. G. Vinda was the film's director of photography. Mani Sharma composed the film's soundtrack and score. Marthand K. Venkatesh edited the film. As the protagonist is suspected to be a villain but actually is a gentleman, Indraganti wanted to name the film by choosing the Telugu equivalent of the word gentleman. After considering titles such as Uttamudu and Manchivadu, he chose Gentleman, with the tagline \\"Hero? Villain?\\". The title was formally announced on 15April 2016, on the eve of Sri Rama Navami. = Casting = Indraganti signed his prot√©g√© Nani as the protagonist after being impressed with his performance as a selfish businessperson in Yevade Subramanyam (2015); it marked their second collaboration after Ashta Chamma (2008). In February 2016 Nani was reported to play a dual role in the film and Srinivas Avasarala inclusion was confirmed. Indraganti described the latter's role as \\"something very complex\\", unlike the comic and supporting roles he has undertaken in the past. It was later revealed that Nani's character would feature a negative streak and that a pair of spectacles would be instrumental as a \\"key contrasting feature\\" for the dual role. Indraganti stated that the film \\"explores human frailties\\" and lacks a \\"conventional villain, one who is completely bad\\". Surbhi and Nivetha Thomas were cast as the female leads in September 2015; Gentleman marks the latter's debut in Telugu cinema. Surbhi's name was suggested by Nani to Indraganti, who was impressed with her performance in Velaiilla Pattadhari (2014). Commenting on Aishwarya's characterisation, Surbhi stated that she would play a rich young entrepreneur who \\"has her values intact and takes life very seriously\\" besides being \\"generous and compassionate\\". Her costumes were a blend of ethnic and urban casuals. Nivetha called her role as Catherine an \\"independent, vulnerable and modern girl who is ready to take on any challenge head-on\\". Two romantic tracks were written for the leads; while one was cinematic, the other was more realistic. Nivetha learnt Telugu during the film's shoot and was encouraged by Nani and Indraganti to dub for her portions. She gave up the attempt to attend her architecture exams in Chennai. Vennela Kishore was cast as Sudarshanam, a comic role of a suspicious team leader. Sreemukhi played the role of Nithya, an investigative journalist, which was reported to be a key supporting role. = Filming = According to Indraganti, the costumes, production design, and cinematography were well- coordinated, resulting in the film being produced with an \\"interesting palette\\". Surbhi joined the film's sets in November 2015, and Nani was expected to begin filming for his portions after completing Krishna Gaadi Veera Prema Gaadha (2015). The film's cast and crew, including the director, underwent a thorough reading session to better understand the story and its characters before rehearsals. Filming was stalled in December 2015 due to the death of a crew member at the Sanghi Temple in Hayathnagar, Hyderabad. Surbhi and Nani completed filming of their portions in Gentleman while continuing to promote their respective films Express Raja (2016) and Krishna Gaadi Veera Prema Gaadha in Hyderabad. The first schedule wrapped up in mid-February 2016. By then, 40% of the film's shoot had been completed. The next schedule commenced at Kodaikanal on 22February 2016. Major scenes and songs were filmed during the schedule, which lasted until 6March 2016. The last schedule began on 14March 2016. Principal photography neared completion in early April 2016, and the remaining portions were filmed in Hyderabad. The post-production work commenced in late April 2016, after the completion of the film's shoot.  Music  Mani Sharma composed the soundtrack and score of Gentleman, which consists of four songs. His inclusion into the film's technical crew was confirmed in late February 2016. Impressed with his work in Krishna Gaadi Veera Prema Gaadha, Nani recommended lyricist Krishna Kanth to Sharma, who wrote the lyrics for two songs. Ramajogayya Sastry and Sirivennela Sitaramasastri each penned the lyrics for one song. The soundtrack, marketed by Aditya Music, was released on 31 May 2016 at a promotional event attended by the full cast and crew. Reviewing the soundtrack, The Times of India gave a rating of four stars and stated that it \\"excels with various styles and genres, kicking mediocrity out of the window\\". The newspaper termed \\"Chali Gaali Chuudduu\\" a \\"real gem of a song\\", praising the lyrics and an interlude with trumpet solo that \\"comes as a breath of fresh air\\". Karthik Srinivasan, writing for The Hindu, found the second interlude of \\"Chali Gaali Chuudduu\\" a \\"beautifully melodic and extended\\" one similar to the works of Ilaiyaraaja. Srinivasan termed the song a \\"wonderfully mellow and jazzy\\" melody and praised the renditions by Haricharan and Padmalatha.  Release  Gentleman was released worldwide on 17June 2016 in 700 screens, competing with other Telugu films such as Guppedantha Prema, Premikudu, and Rudra IPS. Gaatri Media released the film on 127 screens in the United States with special premieres, claiming it the biggest release for a film starring Nani up to that date. According to Indo-Asian News Service, Gentleman had the third biggest release for a South Indian film to that point after 24 and Theri. The release locations included a few smaller cities of the United States such as Tallahassee, Maryville, and Poughkeepsie. Besides the United States, Gentleman was released in other overseas markets such as Africa and Germany. The film was remade into Bengali as Villain (2018). = Critical reception = Gentleman received positive reviews, with praise for the performances, Sharma's score, and the scripting. Mridula Ramadugu of Firstpost praised the performances of Nani and Niveda in particular and called Gentleman a very subtle thriller that \\"stands out from the typical, action drama\\". Purnima Sriram of The New Indian Express termed the film a \\"game changer\\" in Nani's career, and one that can \\"penetrate minds with intelligent moves in every scene\\". Writing for The Hindu, Sangeetha Devi Dundoo gave three and a half stars out of five and called Gentleman an \\"intriguing tale marked by fine performances\\". Dundoo praised Nani's performance and found it \\"swiftly moving between being vulnerable and ominous\\". Suresh Kavirayani of the Deccan Chronicle also gave the film three and a half stars out of five, praising the performances of the principal cast and Sharma's score. He also praised Indraganti's screenplay and dialogues but criticised the climax and the love story of Nani and Surbhi. Karthik Keramalu of CNN-News18 gave Gentleman three stars out of five and stated, \\"I wouldn't say this is the most experimental film [Nani] has worked on; I'd say this is an excellent film he has chosen to work on within the limited space of [the] commercial cinema.\\" Sify also gave the film a rating of three stars and called it a \\"neat thriller\\" that \\"doesn't move to the next level after promising best in the interval period\\". In contrast, L.Ravichander of The Hans India rated the film two stars out of five and criticised the performances of the principal cast except that of Nani for lacking authenticity, adding that the actor \\"fights a lone battle to bring credibility\\". = Box office = Gentleman debuted with earnings of US$71,938 (4.825 million) from its premiere shows, surpassing the records set by Nani's previous films. The opening global gross and distributor share figures stood at 55 million and 31.9 million, respectively, making it Nani's career best opener. In its first weekend, Gentleman grossed nearly 140 million and collected a distributor share of approximately 90 million globally. At the same time, it managed to earn US$537,490 (36.3 million) at the United States box office. The film continued to earn steady returns due to positive word of mouth; it collected a total of US$678,032 (46 million) in eight days, and US$771,107 (52.5 million) in ten days at the United States box office. It also experienced a decent theatrical run at the AP/Nizam box office, where it grossed 154 million in ten days, with a distributor share of 102.1 million. In its third week, the film witnessed a drop of 60% in its screen count and 65% in its revenues. According to trade analyst Taran Adarsh, it collected a total of US$872,320 (58.6 million) in 17days at the United States box office. The film's global earnings remained steady despite reduction in screen count due to new releases. In 17days, Gentleman grossed a total of 282.1 million globally with a distributor share of 162.3 million. The film managed to retain nine screens in the United States after the release of Sultan and witnessed a drop of 80% in its earnings; it collected a total of US$897,001 (60.3 million) in 24 days. By the end of its theatrical run, Gentleman grossed a total of 326 million globally, with a distributor share of 177.2 million.

It was first released on iOS in May 2016, followed by a release on Android in December 2016, debuting as a major update to the already- established Google Keyboard app on Android. Gboard features Google Search, including web results (removed since April 2020) and predictive answers, easy searching and sharing of GIF and emoji content, a predictive typing engine suggesting the next word depending on context, and multilingual language support. Updates to the keyboard have enabled additional functionality, including GIF suggestions, options for a dark color theme or adding a personal image as the keyboard background, support for voice dictation, next-phrase prediction, and hand-drawn emoji recognition. At the time of its launch on iOS, the keyboard only offered support for the English language, with more languages being gradually added in the following months, whereas on Android, the keyboard supported more than 100 languages at the time of release. In August 2018, Gboard passed 1 billion installs on the Google Play Store, making it one of the most popular Android apps. This is measured by the Google Play Store and includes downloads by users as well as pre-installed instances of the app. Features Gboard is a virtual keyboard app. It features Google Search , including web results (removed for Android version of the app) and predictive answers, easy searching and sharing of GIF and emoji content, and a predictive typing engine suggesting the next word depending on context. At its May 2016 launch on iOS, Gboard only supported the English language, while it supported \\"more than 100 languages\\" at the time of its launch on the Android platform. Google states that Gboard will add more languages \\"over the coming months\\". As of October 2019, 916 languages are supported. Gboard features Floating Keyboard and Google Translate in Gboard itself. Gboard supports one- handed mode on Android after its May 2016 update. This functionality was added to the app when it was branded as Google Keyboard. An update for the iOS app released in August 2016 added French, German, Italian, Portuguese, and Spanish languages, as well as offering \\"smart GIF suggestions\\", where the keyboard will suggest GIFs relevant to text written. The keyboard also offers new options for a dark theme or adding a personal image from the camera roll as the keyboard's background. Another new update in March 2018 added Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, Finnish, Greek, Polish, Romanian, Balochi, Swedish, Catalan, Hungarian, Malay, Russian, Latin American Spanish, and Turkish languages, along with support for voice dictation, enabling users to \\"long press the mic button on the space bar and talk\\". In April 2017, Google significantly increased the amount of Indian languages supported on Gboard, adding 11 new languages, bringing the total number of supported Indian languages to 22. In June 2017, the Android app was updated to support recognition of hand-drawn emoji and the ability to predict whole phrases rather than single words. The functionality is expected to come to the iOS app at a later time. Offline voice recognition was added in March 2019. On 12 February 2020, a new feature ‚ÄúEmoji Kitchen‚Äù was introduced that allowed users to mash up different emoji and use them as stickers when messaging. Reception In 2016, The Wall Street Journal praised the keyboard, particularly the integrated Google search feature. However, it was noted that the app does not currently support integration with other apps on the device, meaning that queries such as \\"Buy Captain America movie tickets\\" sends users to the web browser rather than an app for movie tickets installed on their phone. The Wall Street Journal also praised the predictive typing engine, stating that it \\"blows past most competitors\\" and \\"it gets smarter with use\\". They also discovered that Gboard \\"cleverly suggests emojis as you type words\\". It was noted that there was the lack of a one-handed mode (a feature added in May 2016 for Android), as well as a lack of options for changing color or the size of keys, writing that \\"If you're looking to customize a keyboard, Gboard isn't for you.\\" References External links * * Category:Google software Category:2016 software Category:Android (operating system) software Category:Android virtual keyboards Category:Virtual keyboards Category:Input methods for handheld devices ","title":"Gboard"},{"id":"50523518","text":"Margiris Normantas (born 27 October 1996) is a Lithuanian basketball player who last played for Lietkabelis Panevƒó≈æys of the Lithuanian Basketball League.

Biography  Guerrero was born in Granada, where, from 1930 to 1934, he attended art classes at the Escuela de Artes y Oficios. In 1940, on the advice of his friend Federico Garc√≠a Lorca, he moved to Madrid, where he continued his studies until 1945 at the Escuela Superior de Bellas Artes de San Fernando. The same year, he received a grant from the French government to study fresco painting for one year at the √âcole des Beaux-Arts, Paris. During his time in Paris, he saw works by artists such as Juan Gris, Paul Klee, Joan Mir√≥, Pablo Picasso, and especially Henri Matisse, whose influence can be seen in the landscapes and rural scenes Guerrero painted after returning to Spain. From 1946, Guerrero spent several years traveling across Europe, staying in Bern, Brussels, London, Paris, and Rome. In Rome, he became friends with the artist brothers Afro and . He also met Roxanne Whittier Pollock, an American journalist. The couple married in 1949, and moved to the United States, staying first in Philadelphia and settling a year later in New York. Guerrero now became acquainted with many prominent members of the American avant-garde, including the artists Willem de Kooning, Franz Kline, Robert Motherwell, Ad Reinhardt, Mark Rothko, and Theodoros Stamos, and with James Johnson Sweeney, art critic and director of the Guggenheim Museum. Guerrero painted his last figurative work (a self-portrait) in 1950, and thereafter devoted himself to abstract expressionism. In 1954, his paintings were exhibited at the Betty Parsons Gallery, and in Sweeney's exhibition Younger American Painters: A Selection. He used his skills in fresco to collaborate with architects on postwar reconstruction projects, winning a fellowship from the Graham Foundation of Chicago for such work. In 1965, he returned to Spain, and from then on divided his time between there and U.S.A. He produced portfolios of graphic works to accompany the poems of Jorge Guillen, Stanley Kunitz and others. He died in Barcelona in 1991, survived by his wife, a son and a daughter.  Assessment  According to an assessment on the Guggenheim Foundation's website, in Guerrero's early abstract style \\"simplified, biomorphic forms float in a quasi-monochromatic background\\". By the mid-1950s it \\"had become more gestural, expressing a deeper sense of urgency, as he loosened his brushstroke and introduced a controlled dripping technique\\". After his first return to Spain, he \\"reintegrat[ed] purer colors in his works, distant from the anxiety-ridden, predominantly black paintings of the late 1950s\\". His style continued to evolve through the 1970s and 1980s, \\"as he created orderly and rhythmic vertical compositions, followed by increasingly dynamic works in which brilliant hues took the lead\\". According to art critic Grace Glueck, he was \\"[k]nown for big, vibrantly colored paintings whose abstract imagery suggested landscape, primitive architecture and atmospheric events\\". She quotes him as saying that the structure of his paintings was based on \\"vertical thrusts or horizontal tensions and diagonal crisscrossings\\".  Exhibitions and collections  His work is held by several prominent collections, including those of the Guggenheim, Whitney and Brooklyn Museums in New York, and from 2000 in the Centro Jos√© Guerrero, Granada. His solo exhibitions include: 1952Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C.; 1954 and 1958Betty Parsons Gallery; 1964Galer√≠a Juana Mord√≥, Madrid (es); 1981Escuela de Artes y Oficios; 1990Museo de Arte Contempor√°neo, Seville (es). In 1994, there was a major retrospective of his work at Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sof√≠a, Madrid. In 2014, an exhibition organized by Yolanda Romero (director from 2000 of Centro Jos√© Guerrero) entitled Jos√© Guerrero: The Presence of Black, 1950-1966 was toured in Granada, Madrid and Barcelona.

It was mostly destroyed in a fire in July 1844 leaving only a few ruined walls still visible. History Bernau Castle and the nearby village of Bernau probably date back to the 11th century, though the earliest mention of Bernowa is in 1157. The noblemen Ulrich and Berchthold of Bernau appear in a document in 1299. Jakob Christoph Beck, Jakob Christoph Iselin, August Johann Burtorff: Neu-vermehrtes Historisch- und Geographisches Allgemeines Lexicon, Basel, Brandm√ºller, 1742, Article: Bernau In the 13th century it was inherited by the Gutenburg family and in 1379 it passed to the lords of Rinach. The Bernau estates included the high and low courts for Leibstadt, Gansingen and Schwaderloch. After the Old Swiss Confederacy conquered the Aargau in 1415, Leibstadt sat on the border between the Swiss County of Baden and the Austrian district of Laufenburg. Following the peace treaty, the border ran through the bergfried of Bernau Castle and the owners served two masters. On 1 March 1499, during the Swabian War, the castle and town were attacked and burned.Leibstadt municipal website accessed 12 May 2016 The castle and town were rebuilt soon thereafter. The lords of Rinach sold Bernau in the 16th century to the Rotberg family. They in turn sold it in the early 1620s to the von Roll family from Uri. While the owner of the castle, Franz Ludwig von Roll became an Austrian baron on 26 February 1624.

After the business failed he became insolvent. When his creditors attempted to sue him in Waldshut the bailiff determined that the living quarters of the Baron in Bernau Castle were actually in Swiss territory and that they should contact the bailiff in Baden. During a typhus epidemic in 1814 Bernau Castle was used as a military hospital. After the epidemic it was sold and passed through several owners until it was divided up into apartments. Then, in 1844, the castle was destroyed in a fire. Today only the portions of the walls of the main tower and the residence wing are still visible.

Life Born at Kelston, Somerset during September 1727, he was the son of Henry Harington of Kelston, and of Mary, daughter of Richard Backwell. On 17 December 1745 he matriculated at The Queen's College, Oxford, and graduated B.A. in 1749, M.A. in 1752. While at Oxford he joined a musical society set up by William Hayes, and restricted to competent sight-readers. Dropping a plan of taking holy orders, Harington studied medicine, and in 1753 established himself as a physician at Wells, Somerset. He accumulated his degrees in medicine in 1762. In 1771 Harington moved to Bath, Somerset, where he composed in spare time, and founded the Bath Harmonic Society. The Duke of York appointed him his physician. He was also an alderman and magistrate of Bath, and served as mayor in 1793. Bath at that time had a substantial population of French exiles caused by the French Revolution, leading to tension, and his term as mayor 1793‚Äì4 saw Harington active against radicalism, and attempting to clean up Bath's streets.

Page 128-133 Since the 1940s, commercial or modern Colombian cumbia expanded to the rest of Latin America, after which it became popular throughout the continent following different commercial adaptations, such as Argentine cumbia, Bolivian cumbia, Chilean cumbia, Dominican cumbia, Ecuadorian cumbia, Mexican cumbia, Peruvian cumbia, Salvadoran cumbia, Uruguayan cumbia, and Venezuelan cumbia, among others. Etymology Most folklorists and musicologists, such as Narciso Garay, Delia Zapata Olivella, and Guillermo Abadia Morales, assume that cumbia is derived from the Bantu root kumbe \\"to dance\\", or any other of the many Bantu words with \\"comb\\" or \\"kumb\\". Cf. samba, macumba. Another possibility is the Tupi-Guarani word cumbi \\"murmuring, noise\\". Cumbia was also a kind of fine woolen garment produced for the Inca. In 2006, Colombian musician and musicologist Guillermo Carbo Ronderos said that the etymology of the word cumbia is \\"still controversial\\" and that \\"seems to derive from the Bantu word cumb√©\\" Origins Sociologist Adolfo Gonzalez Henriquez, in his work \\"La m√∫sica del Caribe colombiano durante la guerra de independencia y comienzos de la Rep√∫blica\\" (Music of the Colombian Caribbean during the war of independence and the beginning of the Republic), includes a text of Admiral Jos√© Prudencio Padilla which records cumbiambas and indigenous gaitas during the festival of John the Baptist in the neighboring town of Arjona, a few days before the naval battle that took place in the Bah√≠a de las √Ånimas of Cartagena between the last Spanish resistance and the republican army, military confrontation that sealed the independence of Colombia: Translated as Children playing cumbia instruments. Notice the gaita, maracas, instruments mentioned by Gosselman in his historical record. The musician and pedagogue Luis Antonio Escobar, in the chapter \\"La mezcla de indio y negro\\" (The mixture of Indian and black) of his book \\"M√∫sica en Cartagena de Indias\\" (Music in Cartagena de Indias) takes the description of Indian dance who witnessed the navy lieutenant Swedish Carl August Gosselman in Santa Marta, and recorded in his work \\"Viaje por Colombia: 1825 y 1826\\" (Journey through Colombia: 1825 and 1826) as proof that at least in the second decade of the nineteenth century the gaita ensemble existed already in Santa Marta, the same that appears in Cartagena and other coastal cities with black musical elements that resulted in cumbia: Translated as: In the description of the writer Jos√© Mar√≠a Samper during his trip down the Magdalena River in 1879, the constituent elements of dance and music on the Magdalena River, instruments and elements of dance cumbia are identified: Translated as: In his work 'Lecturas locales (Local Readings) (1953), the barranquillero historian Miguel Goenaga barranquillero describes the cumbia and its cumbiamba circles in Barranquilla around 1888: Translated as: = Controversy = The origin of cumbia has been the subject of argument between those who attribute an indigenous ethno-musical origin, geographically located in the region of Depression Momposina and those who argue the thesis of origin black African in Cartagena or even in Africa itself. The first, represented by personalities like the composer Jos√© Barros, writers like Joc√© G. Daniels, sociologists like Orlando Fals Borda and historians as Gnecco Rangel Pava, and the latter by the folklorist Delia Zapata Olivella. House of the composer Jos√© Barros at El Banco, Magdalena. In 1998, in his article \\"La cumbia, emperadora del Pocabuy\\" (La cumbia, Empress of Pocabuy) the writer Joc√© G. Daniels theorizes that the cumbia was \\"el aliciente espiritual de los indios\\" (the spiritual attraction of the Indians) to associate the flutes used in the celebrations of the Chimilas, pocigueycas and pocabuyes in the territories of the current populations of Guamal, Ci√©naga and El Banco, with the primitive cumbia gaita, based on the report sent by the perpetual governor Lope de Orozco to the king in 1580, about the Province of Santa Marta, which recounts that \\"los yndios i yndias veben y asen fiestas con una ca√±a a manera de flauta que se meten en la boca para ta√±er y producen una mucica como mui trayda del infierno\\" (The Indians drink and party with a cane that is used as a flute, which they put in their mouths to be played and that produces a music that seems to come from the very hell) (sic). The banque√±o songwriter Antonio Garcia presented in 1997 the following theory about the birth of cumbia: \\"Las tribus dedicadas a la pesca y la agricultura, en sus rituales f√∫nebres, especialmente cuando mor√≠a alg√∫n miembro de la alta jerarqu√≠a de la tribu, todos los miembros se reun√≠an al caer la noche alrededor de una fogata, en el centro del c√≠rculo se colocaba a una mujer embarazada que era s√≠mbolo de la nueva vida, quien iniciaba una danza con el ritmo suave y melanc√≥lico de la flauta de millo, esta ceremonia se prolongaba por varias horas y terminaba por sumir en el m√°s grande √©xtasis a todos los que estaban all√≠ reunidos y as√≠ naci√≥ la cumbia\\" (The tribes engaged in fishing and agriculture, in their funeral rituals, especially when someone in the hierarchy of the tribe died, gathered all members at nightfall around a campfire in the center of the circle stood a pregnant woman who was a symbol of new life, who started a dance with the soft and melancholic rhythm from flute of millo, this ceremony was prolonged for several hours and ended up plunging into the greatest ecstasy to all who were gathered there and cumbia was born). At the same meeting, Jos√© Barros said, product of the oral tradition received from the Indians: \\"The cumbia was born in funeral ceremonies that Chimillas Indians celebrated in the country of Pocabuy when one of its leaders died\\" (La cumbia naci√≥ en las ceremonias f√∫nebres que los indios Chimillas celebraban en el pa√≠s de Pocabuy cuando mor√≠a uno de sus jerarcas). Barros also holds in relation to dance: \\"The idea of dancing in a circular motion has to do with the custom of the Chimilas Indians who danced around the coffin of one of their leaders, what they did counter-clockwise, what meant one-way trip). Daniels adds that the musical airs related to the origin of the cumbia \\"had their peak between Chymilas, Pocigueycas (Ponqueycas) and Pocabuyes, i.e., in the actual populations of Guamal, Cienaga and El Banco. Cumbia reached its development with the elements provided by Bemba color√° blacks and whites, cunning and canny.\\". To researchers of indigenous cultures, the ethno-musical mixture that gives rise to the cumbia occurs during the Colony in the native country of Pocabuy (current populations of El Banco, Guamal, Menchiquejo and San Sebastian in the Magdalena, Chiriguan√° and Tamalameque in the Cesar and Mompox, Chilloa, Chimi and Guataca in Bol√≠var Department) located in the current Caribbean region of Colombia, in the upper valley of Magdalena region the Mompox Depression (including the cultures of La Sabana (Sucre),La Sabana and the Sin√∫ River, north to Pincoya), product of the musical and cultural fusion of Indigenous, Afro-Colombian slaves and, on a lesser extent, of Spaniards, as referred by it historians Orlando Fals Borda in his book Mompox y Loba, and Gnecco Rangel Pava in his books El Pa√≠s de Pocabuy and Aires Guamalenses. The Pocabuy are mentioned in several recordings, although the most famous mention corresponds to the chorus of the song \\"Cumbia de la paz\\" (Cumbia of peace) recorded by \\"Chico\\" Cervantes: translated as: Fals Borda notes: translated as: For the writer Joc√© G. Daniels, is \\"ironic\\" that people have \\"tried to foist a Kumb√© Bant√∫ origin to cumbia.\\" Researchers question that if the cumbia came from African rhythms, in other parts of America where blacks came from all over Africa as slaves, as the United States, there should be cumbia, or at least something similar. J. Barros says, \\"cumbia does not have a single hint of Africa. That's easy to check: the United States, which received so many thousands of black Africans does not have anything like cumbia in its folkloric manifestations. The same happens with the Antillean countries. I wonder why if the cumbia is African and entered through La Boquilla, like Manuel and Delia Zapata Olivella Dsay, in Puerto Tejada, for example, where there are also black people, and throughout the Pacific, cumbia is not a rhythm or appears in compositions ... I, who have been in contact with Pocabuyanos Indians since I was eight, who have had the opportunity since I was a child to interact with indigenous wome of 80 to 90 years telling her ritual, the cumbia ritual, I can certify the above, that the cumbia appeared every time the cacique died and they danced around the dead.\\" In turn, the Africanists place the emergence of the cumbia to contact the black slaves with Indians in ports like Cartagena, Ci√©naga, Santa Marta and Riohacha, mainly in the first, during the celebrations of the Virgen de la Candelaria. The Afro- Colombianists dispute the origin of cumbia, and the place it Cartagena. Some authors assume that the black element in cumbia comes from cumb√©, a bantu rhythm and dance from Bioko island Bioko, Equatorial Guinea. The Africans who arrived as slaves to those regions, to tell the story of their ethnic groups and those famous deeds worthy to be stored in memory, used certain songs that they called are√≠tos, which means \\"dance singing\\": putting up candles, they sang the coreo which was like the historical lesson that, after being heard and repeated many times, remained in the memory of all listeners. The center of the circle was occupied by those who gave the lesson singing and those more proficient in handling guacharacas, millos, drums and maracas, to sing with delicacy the music of those songs that suffer a transformation, with time, from being elegiac to exciting, gallant, complainant and amusing. The cultural researcher A. Stevenson Samper refers to the work of General Joaquin Posada Gutierrez, \\"Fiestas de la Candelaria in La Popa\\" (1865), where the music and dance of the festivities of the Virgen de la Candelaria described in Cartagena and relates the following description with cumbia circle. The anthropologist Nina S. de Friedemann uses the same text to explain the configuration of cumbia within the scope of slavery in Cartagena de Indias: That can be translated as At least until the 1920s, the terms cumbia and mapal√© designated the same rhythm in the area of Cartagena de Indias: translated as Regarding the cantares de vaquer√≠a (cowboy songs) as one of the origins of vallenato, the cultural and musical researcher Ciro Quiroz states about cumbia: that is loosely translated as Referring to the site of origin of vallenato, Quiroz notes on the site of origin of cumbia: translated as On the transition of whistles and flutes to the current vallenato instruments, the author says: Translated as On April 16, 1877 La Cumbia Solede√±a was founded, one of the most distinguished and traditional cumbia groups.  Colombian tradition  By the 1940s cumbia began spreading from the coast to other parts of Colombia alongside other coste√±a form of music, like porro and vallenato. Clarinetist Lucho Berm√∫dez helped bring cumbia into the country's interior. The early spread of cumbia internationally was helped by the number of record companies on the coast. Originally working-class populist music, cumbia was frowned upon by the elites, but as it spread, the class association subsided and cumbia became popular in every sector of society. The researcher Guillermo Abad√≠a Morales in his \\"Compendium of Colombian folklore\\", Volume 3, # 7, published in 1962, states that \\"this explains the origin in the zambo conjugation of musical air by the fusion of the melancholy indigenous gaita flute or ca√±a de millo, i.e., Tolo or Kuis√≠, of Kuna or Kogi ethnic groups, respectively, and the cheerful and impetuous resonance from the African drums. The ethnographic council has been symbolized in the different dancing roles that correspond to each sex.\\" The presence of these cultural elements can be appreciated thus: * In instrumentation are the drums; maracas, guache and the whistles (ca√±a de millo and gaitas) of indigenous origin; whereas the songs and coplas are a contribution of Spanish poetics, although adapted later. * Presence of sensual movements, distinctly charming, seductive, characteristic of dances with African origins. * The vestments have clear Spanish features: long polleras, lace, sequins, hoop earrings, flower headdresses and intense makeup for women; white shirt and pants, knotted red shawl around the neck and hat reckless =Festivals= Monument to the cumbia in El Banco, Magdalena. The most relevant cumbia festivals are: * Festival Nacional de la Cumbia \\"Jos√© Barros\\": that is celebrated yearly in El Banco, Magdalena. It's was declared cultural heritage of the Nation by the Congress of Colombia in 2013. *Festival Nacional de la Cumbiamba: that is celebrated yearly in Ceret√©, C√≥rdoba. *Sirenato de la Cumbia: celebrated yearly in Puerto Colombia, Atl√°ntico. *Festival de Cumbia Aut√≥ctona del Caribe Colombiano: celebrated yearly in Barranquilla. *Festival de Bailadores de Cumbia: celebrated yearly in Barranquilla. The carnaval de Barranquilla is the scenario of multiple cumbia performances and contests ; the main stage of the parades, V√≠a 40 Avenue, is called the \\"cumbi√≥dromo\\" during the days of carnival, in analogy to the Sambadrome in Rio de Janeiro and other Brazilian cities. =Cultural Heritage of Colombia= In 2006, the cumbia was nominated by the magazine Semana and the Ministry of Culture as a cultural symbol of Colombia, being in the position twelve of fifty candidates. In 2013 the Congress of Colombia declared the National Festival of the Cumbia Jose Barros of El Banco, Magdalena cultural heritage of the Nation. Since 2013, the mayor of Guamal, Magdalena (municipality located in the territory of the former nation of Pocabuy), Alex Ricardo Rangel Arismendi, promotes the project to declare the cumbia as Intangible Cultural Heritage of the Nation Colombiana. =In Colombia today= Geographical coverage of Colombian cumbia. The cumbia is present on the Caribbean coast, in the subregion around the Magdalena River delta invested, the Montes de Mar√≠a and riverine populations, with its epicenter in the Depresi√≥n momposina seat of ancient Pocabuy Indigenous country. Traditional cumbia is preserved and considered representative of the Colombian identity, especially on the northern Caribbean coast. The best representation of traditional Cumbia is shown every year on the Festival de la Cumbia in El Banco, Magdalena. The festival was created by one of the most important Colombian Cumbia composers, Jose Barros, in order to preserve the original rhythms of traditional Cumbia music. Modern forms of cumbia are also combined with other genres like vallenato, electronica or rock. This mixing of genres is found in the music of modern artists, such as Carlos Vives, Bomba Est√©reo, Andr√©s Cabas, and Humberto Pernett. Since the 1980s, in the city of Medell√≠n, there has been growing interest among young and middle-aged people in \\"rescuing\\" the masterpieces of the '50s. It is the only city in Colombia where ballroom numbers of Cumbia, Porro and Gaita (an orchestrated variant of Porro Pelayero, or Palitiao) are still widely enjoyed and danced to by all ages of all social classes. Diffusion in Latin America thumb La Sonora de Tommy Rey, a Chilean cumbia band. The image shows the classic instrumentation of the international variants of the genre. The most fruitful of Colombian music industry is given time in the 1960s, it began with the founding of Discos Fuentes in 1934, the Discos Sonolux in 1949 and soon after Discos Victoria. Since the 1940s, orchestras like Lucho Bermudez, Los Corraleros de Majagual, Los Hispanos or Los Graduados took the cumbia to Peru, where it became more known with groups such as Los Mirlos, Los Destellos, Juaneco y Su Combo or Cuarteto Continental who were the first to give a proper rhythm to the Peruvian cumbia using as the main instrument electric guitars. Thanks to this it becomes much better known in Argentina, El Salvador, Mexico, Ecuador, Chile, Venezuela, among other. This led local musicians to give rise to variants of cumbia as a result of its fusionr with rhythms of each nation such as Argentine cumbia, Mexican cumbia, Salvadoran cumbia, etc. =Argentina= Cumbia and porro rhythms were introduced by Lucho Bermudez, who in 1946 recorded for RCA V√≠ctor in Argentina 60 of his compositions with musicians provided by Eduardo Armani and Eugene Nobile. In the early 1960s, Bovea y sus vallenatos move to Argentina and popularizes cumbia in the country; the same was done by the Cuarteto Imperial, a Colombian band nationalized Argentine. The country has contributed musical compositions and own variations Cumbia villera, which resonates particularly with the poor and marginalized dwellers of villas miseria, (shanty towns, and slums); lyrics typically glorify theft and drug abuse. Undoubtedly the most refined version of Argentine cumbia is called Santa Fe cumbia or cumbia with guitar. In this style the main instrument is the guitar and its compositions are more complex. In the Santa Fe cumbia schemes of two or three simple chords and lyrics about dancing are abandoned, and melancholy lyrics and atypical chords are explored. Its creator, Juan Carlos Denis, is considered a hero of the local music. His creation became popular in 1978 with his album \\"A mi gente\\" and the band \\"Los del boh√≠o\\". Pablo Lescano, ex-member of Amar Azul and founder of Flor Piedra and Damas Gratis is known to be the creator of the cumbia villera \\"sound\\". However, a lighter form of cumbia enjoyed widespread popularity in Argentina during the 1990s. Antonio Rios (ex-Grupo Sombras, ex-Malagata) is a good representative of the Argentinian cumbia from the 1990s. The emergence of cumbia as a massively popular form of music in Argentina came perhaps with the release of Tarjetita de Invitacion by Adrian y Los Dados Negros in 1988 which was certified platinum, a first back then for a cumbia act. =Bolivia= The cumbia sound from Bolivia usually incorporates Afro-Bolivian Saya beats and tecnocumbia. =Cumbia marimbera (Central America)= In the south and southeast of Mexico (states of Chiapas and Oaxaca) is traditional the use of the modern marimba (Percussion instrument made of native wood from Guatemala) as this instrument was developed in the region, extending its use to much of Central America, particularly in Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras and Nicaragua. Since the early 1940s, several Central American composers created music pieces using the rhythm of cumbia giving an original touch. Among the main drivers of the cumbia are Nicaraguans Victor M. Leiva with \\"Cumbia piquetona\\", Jorge Isaac Carballo with \\"Baila mi cumbia\\", Jorge Paladino with \\"Cumbia Chinandega\\" and groups like Los Hermanos Cort√©s with \\"A bailar con Rosita\\", \\"Entre ritmos y palmeras\\" and \\"Suenan los tambores\\" and Los Alegres de Ticuantepe with \\"Catalina\\". In El Salvador, Los Hermanos Flores with \\"La cumbia folcl√≥rica\\", \\"Salvadore√±as\\" and \\"La bala\\". The Guatemalan orchestra \\"Marimba Orquesta Gallito\\" is the most famous between cumbia marimbera bands/orchestras. From Mexico, there are orchestras like \\"Marimba Chiapas\\" and \\"Marimba Soconusco\\". =Chile= In Chile, cumbia was also introduced by recordings made in Colombia. Chilean cumbia was born when Luis√≠n Land√°ez, a Venezuelan singer, achieved success with songs like \\"Macondo\\" or \\"La Piragua\\" and when the Colombian Amparito Jim√©nez recorded in Chile \\"La pollera color√°\\", among other songs. Cumbia is one of the most popular dance forms in Chile. They have a style of their own, Chilean cumbia, and some of the most successful orchestras of this genre include Sonora Palacios, Viking 5, Giolito y su Combo, and La Sonora de Tommy Rey. However, Cumbia's popularity has been declining since the success of reggaeton in the mid-2000s, losing part of the preferences of the popular sectors of society. However, it has regained popularity in late 2000s thanks to the new rhythms like Nueva Cumbia Chilena, a particular fusion of cumbia and punk-rock styles. Nowadays, Cumbia is gaining new attention as a result of emergence of acts formed by younger musicians usually labelled as \\"La Nueva Cumbia Chilena\\" (The new Chilean Cumbia), including bands such as Chico Trujillo, Banda Conmoci√≥n, Juana Fe, Sonora Bar√≥n, Sonora de Llegar, Chorizo Salvaje, Sonora Tomo como Rey, and Villa Cari√±o, among others. These new bands offer some of the classic tones and sounds of Chilean cumbia blended with rock or other folk Latin American styles. La Noche and Am√©rico are also very popular acts, although they perform a more traditional style of Chilean cumbia, in some extend related to the style that dominated during the 1990s. The other substyle of the Chilean cumbia is called \\"sound\\", and it is the most popular cumbia style in the northern part of the country. =El Salvador= Orchestras such as Orchestra San Vicente, Los Hermanos Flores and Grupo Bravo perform cumbia with basic instrumentation, replacing accordion with brass instruments and woodwinds, and using traditional percussion and bass guitar. =Mexico= In the 1940s, the Colombian singer Luis Carlos Meyer Castandet emigrated to Mexico, where he worked with the Mexican orchestra director Rafael de Paz. Their album La Cumbia Cienaguera is considered the first cumbia recorded outside Colombia. Meyer Castandet also recorded other hits, including Mi gallo tuerto, Caprichito, and Nochebuena. Colombian cumbia and porro began to become popular in Mexico combined with local sounds, with Tony Camargo creating the beginnings of Mexican cumbia. Later styles include the Technocumbia, tropical Cumbia, Cumbia grupera, Mexican Andean Cumbia, and Cumbia sonidera, which uses synthesizers and electric batteries. In the 1960s, Mike Laure incorporated rock and roll into cumbia, to create a new style. In the 1970s, Aniceto Molina emigrated to Mexico, where he joined the Guerrero group La Luz Roja de San Marcos and recorded many popular tropical cumbias, such as La Cumbia Sampuesana, El Campanero, El Gallo Mojado, El Peluquero, and La Mariscada. Also in the 1970s the Mexican singer Rigo Tovar popularized a fusion of cumbia with ballad. Other popular Mexican cumbia composers and performers include Efr√©n David, Super Grupo Colombia, Grupo Kual, La Sonora Tropicana, La Tropa Vallenata, Celso Pi√±a Y su Ronda Bogot√°, Fito Olivares, Grupo Ca√±averal, Los Angeles Azules, Alberto Pedraza, Los Angeles de Charly, Los Caminantes, and Grupo Bronco. =Nicaragua= Nicaragua became a stronghold of Cumbia music during the 1950s and 1960s. The country has its own variation of cumbia music and dance.National Geographic Cumbia Music Mostly known for its cumbia chinandegana in the Northwestern section of the country, it has also seen a rise in cumbia music artists on the Caribbean coast like Gustavo Layton. =Peru= Peru, like other American countries, was invaded by the first cumbia recordings made in Colombia from the north and from the capital. During the mid-1960s began to appear on national discography from various music labels like Virrey, MAG, and Iempsa, orchestras like Lucho Macedo and Pedro Miguel y sus Maracaibos. Since the early 60s', the Cumbia Peruana has had great exponents. While initially had strong influences from Colombian cumbia, over time it has achieved a unique and distinctive style with shades or rhythms influenced by rock, Huayno, native dances of the jungle, waltz, bolero, merengue, salsa, etc., we can say that it is continually changing or evolving. The rhythm was understood soon in all regions of the country, prompting some groups to introduce some Peruvian musical elements, making electric guitars protagonists. Contributions from Peru to the cumbia are interpretation, compositions and variations like Tropical andean cumbia; thanks to the contribution of Peruvian cumbia, this genre is known throughout South America. Peruvian cumbia, particularly from the 1960s to mid-1990s, is generally known as \\"Chicha\\", although this definition is quite problematic as both Peruvian cumbia and Chicha currently co-exist and influence each other (good examples include Agua Marina's popular cover of Los Eco's \\"Paloma Ajena\\" and Grupo Nectar's cover of Guinda's \\"Cerveza, Ron y Guinda\\"). Peruvian cumbia started in the 1960s with groups such as Los Destellos, and later with Juaneco y Su Combo, Los Mirlos, Los Shapis, Cuarteto Continental, Los Diablos Rojos, Pintura Roja, Chacalon y la Nueva Crema and Grupo N√©ctar. Some musical groups that play Peruvian cumbia today are: Agua Marina, Armonia 10, Agua Bella, and Grupo 5. These groups would be classified as Cumbia but often take songs and techniques from Chicha and Huayno in their stylings or as songs. Grupo Fantasma was a Peruvian-Mexican cumbia group. Andean Cumbia, is a style that combines Andean music and cumbia. This style has even become popular in Mexico, as some groups like Grupo Saya claim to be Cumbia andina mexicana, Mexican Andean Cumbia. =Venezuela= Since the 1950s the cumbia has great success and impact in Venezuela due to its proximity to Colombia and to the emigration of Colombians. Two of the oldest Venezuelan tropical orchestras that begin to perform and record cumbia in the country were Los Mel√≥dicos and Billo's Caracas Boys. The most significant contributions have been creating Venezuelan cumbia styles using melodic organs and harps.

A British-French-Belgian co-production, the film stars an ensemble cast that includes Steve Buscemi, Simon Russell Beale, Paddy Considine, Rupert Friend, Jason Isaacs, Michael Palin, Andrea Riseborough, Paul Whitehouse, and Jeffrey Tambor. Based on the 2010 and 2012 French graphic novel La Mort de Staline, the film depicts the power struggle following the death of Soviet leader Joseph Stalin in 1953. The Death of Stalin was screened in the Platform section at the 2017 Toronto International Film Festival and received critical acclaim. It was released in the United Kingdom by Entertainment One Films on 20 October 2017, in the United States by IFC Films on 09 March 2018, in France by Gaumont on 4 April 2018 and in Belgium by September Film Distribution on 18 April 2018. The film was banned in Russia and Kyrgyzstan for allegedly mocking the countries' past and making fun of its leaders. It received a Magritte Award nomination in the category of Best Foreign Film. Plot In the USSR in 1953, Chairman of the Council of Ministers Joseph Stalin is listening to a concert on the radio and orders that a recording of it be delivered to him. The concert has to be hurriedly repeated and recorded, but the pianist, Maria Yudina, hides a note to Stalin in the sleeve of the record, saying he has ruined the country. As Stalin reads the note in his dacha, he suffers a cerebral hemorrhage and becomes paralysed. The members of the Central Committee are alerted. The first to arrive is Interior Ministry (NKVD) head Lavrentiy Beria. He discovers and pockets Yudina's note, and proceeds to steal papers from a safe and give them to his men who are waiting outside the dacha. Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers Georgy Malenkov arrives next. As Malenkov panics, Beria encourages him to take the leadership, hoping to use him as a puppet. Moscow Party Head Nikita Khrushchev arrives with the rest of the Committee, except Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov, whom Stalin had added to one of his lists of enemies the previous night. Beria closes off Moscow, has the NKVD take over city security duties from the Soviet Army, and replaces Stalin's list of enemies with his own list, reprieving Molotov. Khrushchev and Beria struggle for symbolic victories, including control over Stalin's daughter, Svetlana, and his unstable son, Vasily. Stalin dies, and the Committee members rush back to Moscow. As soon as they leave NKVD troops arrive to loot Stalin's dacha and execute witnesses. Khrushchev goes to Molotov's home and attempts to enlist his support, but Molotov, a true believer in Stalinism, opposes any factionalism in the Communist Party. Beria buys Molotov's loyalty by releasing his wife, Polina Molotova, from confinement. Malenkov is named Premier while being largely controlled by Beria. At the first Committee meeting following Stalin's death, Beria sidelines Khrushchev by putting him in charge of Stalin's funeral and suggesting the introduction of many of the liberal reforms Khrushchev had already planned. Stalin's body is laid in state in the Hall of Columns, while many political prisoners are released and restrictions on the Russian Orthodox Church are loosened, earning Beria more popular support. Marshal Georgy Zhukov arrives and demands to know why the Soviet Army has been confined to barracks within Moscow. Beria learns that Khrushchev has a passing acquaintance with Maria Yudina, who has been hired to play at the funeral, and threatens them both that he will reveal Yudina's note. Khrushchev approaches Zhukov, who agrees to provide the Army's support in a coup to overthrow Beria, but only if the Committee agrees. To undermine Beria's popularity, Khrushchev orders the resumption of trains into Moscow, allowing thousands of mourners into the city. As Khrushchev has anticipated, the NKVD guards around the Hall fire on the crowd, killing 1,500 people. The Committee suggests scapegoating low-level NKVD officers, but because Beria believes any blame attached to security services will tarnish his reputation, he angrily threatens the Committee with incriminating documents he has collected on them. Enraged that Beria has ended the State's persecution of the Orthodox Church, Molotov secretly tells Khrushchev and Lazar Kaganovich that he will support the coup if they can enlist the support of the others, including Malenkov. On the day of Stalin's funeral, Khrushchev lies to the Committee and Zhukov that he has Malenkov's support. The Soviet Army overwhelms the NKVD and takes up positions outside the conference room. Zhukov and his men arrest Beria, and Khrushchev coerces Malenkov into signing the papers for Beria's trial. In a kangaroo court Khrushchev and his allies find Beria guilty of treason and sexual assault, and execute him. As Beria's body is burnt, Khrushchev gives Svetlana a ticket to Vienna and assures her that her brother will be cared for. Several years later, Khrushchev, now leader of the Soviet Union, having removed his co-conspirators, attends a concert by Maria Yudina, while future leader Leonid Brezhnev watches him from the next row of seats.

The Death of Stalin grossed $8 million in the United States and Canada and $16.6 million in other territories (including $7.3 million in the UK), for a worldwide total of $24.6 million. = Ban in Russia= Ban in Russia, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan Nikolai Starikov, head of the Russian Great Fatherland Party, said The Death of Stalin was an \\"unfriendly act by the British intellectual class\\" and part of an \\"anti-Russian information war\\". In September 2017 the head of the Public Council of the Russian Ministry of Culture said Russian authorities were considering a ban on the film, alleging the film could be part of a \\"western plot to destabilise Russia by causing rifts in society\\". On 23 January 2018, two days before the film's scheduled release in Russia, a screening was attended by State Duma MPs, representatives of the Russian Historical Society, members of the Culture Ministry's Public Board, and film industry members. Two days later, the Ministry of Culture withdrew the film's distribution certificate. But several cinemas screened the film in late January, claiming that by then they had not heard that the movie's exhibition license had been revoked. Russia's culture ministry sued these theatres. According to the results of a poll conducted by the state-run Russian Public Opinion Research Center (VTSIOM), 35% of Russians disapproved of the Culture Ministry's decision to pull the film off the screens, while 30% supported the ban and 35% were neutral. 58% of Russians said they would be willing to watch the film in cinemas if the ban were lifted. The film has been illegally downloaded around 1.5 million times in Russia. A group of Russian Culture Ministry's lawyers, including the daughter of Zhukov, Era Zhukova, cinematographers Nikita Mikhalkov, Vladimir Bortko, and Head of the Russian State Historical Museum Alexey Levykin, petitioned Culture Minister Vladimir Medinsky to withdraw the film's certification, saying \\"The Death of Stalin is aimed at inciting hatred and enmity, violating the dignity of the Russian (Soviet) people, promoting ethnic and social inferiority, which points to the movie's extremist nature. We are confident that the movie was made to distort our country's past so that the thought of the 1950s Soviet Union makes people feel only terror and disgust.\\" The authors said the film denigrated the memory of Russian World War II fighters, with the National Anthem accompanied by obscene expressions and offensive attitude, historically inaccurate decorations, and the planned release on the eve of the 75th Anniversary of the Battle of Stalingrad \\"a spit in the face of all those who died there, and all those who are still alive\\". The film was banned in Russia, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan. Armenia and Belarus were the only members of the Eurasian Economic Union to show it. In Armenia the film premiered in two theatres in Yerevan on 25 January 2018. In Belarus the film premiered after an initial delay. In Kazakhstan the film was screened only at the Clique festival. =Critical response= On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 95% based on 243 reviews, with an average rating of 8.06/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"The Death of Stalin finds director/co-writer Armando Iannucci in riotous form, bringing his scabrous political humor to bear on a chapter in history with painfully timely parallels.\\" On Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 88 out of 100, based on 43 critics, indicating \\"universal acclaim\\". Donald Clarke, writing for The Irish Times, wrote that the film \\"starts in a state of mortal panic and continues in that mode towards its inevitably ghastly conclusion\\". In The Guardian, Peter Bradshaw wrote that \\"fear rises like gas from a corpse in Armando Iannucci's brilliant horror- satire\\" and that it \\"is superbly cast, and acted with icy and ruthless force by an A-list lineup. There are no weak links. Each has a plum role; each squeezes every gorgeous horrible drop.\\" Raphael Abraham, writing for Financial Times, wrote, \\"As this coven of vampiric apparatchiks feasts on the remains of Stalinism, the unremitting blackness of the situation at times threatens a full comedy eclipse. But the discomfiting balancing act of humour and horror is precisely Iannucci's game‚Äîand only he could pull it off with such skill.\\" Former U.S. President Barack Obama included The Death of Stalin as one of his favourite films of 2018. Historical accuracy A number of academics have pointed to historical inaccuracies in The Death of Stalin. Iannucci has responded, \\"I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs a documentary. It is a fiction, but it‚Äôs a fiction inspired by the truth of what it must have felt like at the time. My aim is for the audience to feel the sort of low-level anxiety that people must have when they just went about their daily lives at the time.\\" Historian Richard Overy has written that the film \\"is littered with historical errors\\", including: * Molotov was not foreign minister when Stalin died. He had been sacked in 1949, but became foreign minister again in the post-Stalin reshuffle. * Marshal (not Field Marshal) Zhukov was a local field commander when Stalin died, exiled to the provinces to satisfy Stalin's paranoid jealousy of him. He became deputy minister of defence in the post-Stalin government but was not the commander of the Soviet Army in March 1953. * Khrushchev, not Malenkov, chaired the meeting to reorganise the government. * Beria was arrested three months after Stalin died, not almost simultaneously, and that was precipitated by the 1953 East German Uprising, not a massacre of mourners in Moscow, which is actually based on the 109 who were trampled to death during the funeral. Furthermore, Beria was not head of the security forces, a job he gave up in 1946. Overy was most critical that the film did not appropriately honour those who died during Stalin's leadership. Iannucci said he \\"chose to tone down real-life absurdity\\" to make the work more believable. The Radio Moscow portion is a retelling of an apocryphal story first recorded in Solomon Volkov's book Testimony. But in Volkov‚Äòs account it was Maria Yudina who was awakened in the middle of the night to be brought in to record, and the recording brought Stalin to tears, moving him to pay Yudina 20,000 rubles in appreciation. The story subsequently served as the loose basis for the 1989 BBC radio play The Stalin Sonata by David Zane Mairowitz. Another smaller historical aspect of the plot was modified for the film‚Äîthe 1950 Sverdlovsk plane crash in which 11 players on the VVS Moscow ice hockey team died. In the movie Vasily Stalin and Anatoly Tarasov deal with a depleted Soviet Union national ice hockey team, complete with a reference to their star player Vsevolod Bobrov, who missed the flight. In actuality the crash happened on 5 January 1950, over three years before Stalin‚Äôs death. The NKVD was not known as such at the time of Stalin's death, having been replaced by the MVD in 1946. Samuel Goff, at the Department of Slavonic Studies, University of Cambridge, while admitting that the film's historical discrepancies could be justified as helping to focus the drama, wrote that turning Beria into \\"an avatar of the obscenities of the Stalinist state\\" missed the chance to say \\"anything about the actual mechanisms of power.\\" Goff argued that Iannucci's approach to satire was not transferable to something like Stalinism and the film is \\"fundamentally ill-equipped to locate the comedy inherent to Stalinism, missing marks it doesn't know it should be aiming for.\\" References External links  * Category:2017 films Category:2017 black comedy films Category:2010s political films Category:British black comedy films Category:British political satire films Category:British films Category:French black comedy films Category:French films Category:French political satire films Category:Cold War films Category:Cultural depictions of Leonid Brezhnev Category:Cultural depictions of Nikita Khrushchev Category:Cultural depictions of Joseph Stalin Category:Cultural depictions of Georgy Zhukov Category:Cultural depictions of Lavrentiy Beria Category:English-language films Category:English-language French films Category:Films about Joseph Stalin Category:Films about the Soviet Union in the Stalin era Category:Films based on French comics Category:Films set in 1953 Category:Films set in Moscow Category:Films set in the Soviet Union Category:Films shot in London Category:Films shot in Ukraine Category:Live- action films based on comics Category:Political films based on actual events Category:IFC Films films Category:Censored films Category:Films critical of communism Category:Films directed by Armando Iannucci Category:Films with screenplays by Armando Iannucci Category:Works banned in Russia Category:Films about funerals Category:Films about Soviet repression Category:Films about coups d'√©tat Category:Films about Christianity ","title":"The Death of Stalin"},{"id":"50525042","text":"William Charles Morris (March 6, 1874 ‚Äì April 10, 1940) was an American political cartoonist.

Californium was developed as a tribute to science-fiction author Philip K. Dick on the 30th anniversary of his death. The player controls Elvin Green, a struggling writer dealing with family matters, as he discovers the means to manipulate reality, and explores several surreal landscapes. Gameplay As an exploration game, the player can move Green around the current level, but has no direct means to interact with it. Several non-playable characters can be approached to initiate a one-side dialog with them. Through each level are several cathode-ray tube monitors that once discovered will present a Roman numeral value to the player. This represents the number of reality-warping points that must be found in the nearby area. These points are marked with a glowing Œò (Theta) glyph, but may require the player to look upon the point from a specific vantage point, to turn to look at the point from a specific direction, or to look near the point to eliminate objects in front of it to make it appear. When the glyph is hidden, objects nearby will flicker in and out of reality, allowing the player to recognize the glyph is nearby. Once the glyph is found, the player interacts with their controllers to activate it. This causes a spherical bubble of a new reality to replace what had previously been there. Once all the glyphs for a section are found, the player is given some narrative for the game, and other sections of the level may be made available. Once all sections are completed in the same manner, the player must then find the right vantage point on the level to enable a final large glyph that spans across many difference surfaces. Plot Elvin Green is a struggling writer living in Berkeley, California in 1967. Following the death of his daughter Alice, and the departure of his wife Thea Trauberg, Green is struggling writer's block, unable to come up with new material for a book; his publisher threatens to drop him, he's in danger of being evicted from his apartment, and his drug addiction is escalating, manifesting in short seizures. Green suddenly hears a voice in his head coming from the static on his television, telling him to seek out images of the Theta. In finding these, Green is able to alter his reality and slip into a new one. In this next reality, Green is revered as the Patriot Writer, the most important writer of his generation - however, California is now the California Republic, an authoritarian police state, and Green's wife Thea, an anti-state revolutionary has been captured and is planned to be executed; characters in this new reality, who are versions of their original selves, all suggest Green to collaborate with the state and bear witness against Thea. The voice, meanwhile, taunts Green that his success in this reality has come with a price, as Green explores and finds yet another reality. In the third reality takes place on Mars, where Green is a Commander of a colony of cyborgs; Green was responsible for creating sentient androids, who eventually enslaved the remaining humanity as workforce. As he prepares for the opening of the museum in his name, colonists let Green know that his wife Thea, a human rebel, is planning to assassinate him at the museum's opening. Green's AI companion, Alice, in the meantime, encounters a technological anomaly, and becomes sentient, which terrifies her. The voice at this point begins to caution Green of exploring more realities, implying that venturing deeper may cause him to lose grip on his reality, but Green does so anyway. The final reality Green finds is a scattered chaotic mash of the previous three realities; the voice at this point actively dissuades Green from venturing further, and there's a faint background sound of paramedics trying to revive a man - it is implied that Green is in fact encountering a drug-related emergency in the real world. Once Green reaches the top of the chaotic world and finds a giant Theta sigil, he appears in a dark void with a single desk and a typewriter. He then awakens in his original apartment and experiences another seizure, as he sits down in front of the static on the television again. Development Californium was borne out of an idea between the development teams Darjeeling and Nova Productions in 2011 as the 30th anniversary of Dick's death was approaching. Darjeeling digital producer Noam Roubah noted that many of the themes that Dick had written about have since come to pass in the 21st century, such as the Internet and the dehumanization of human communications. The developers initially thought of doing a web-based project but within a few months opted to use a video game for this work. The teams brought artist Olivier Bonhomme to create surreal environments to reflect a more psychedelic feel, acknowledging the influence of recreational drugs in Dick's life, rather than the darker tones used in other adoptions of Dick's works. The developers took inspiration from Dick's earlier years in crafting Green; the departure of Green's wife and his dismissive editor are similar concepts Dick had to face early on. The gameplay's central concept, of discovering the Theta glyph to change reality, was inspired by autobiographic material Dick wrote on coming to an epiphany in 1974 on seeing a woman wearing an ichthys symbol, which caused him to have a vision of a \\"pink beam\\" that would impart wisdom and insight to those it touched. The impact in the game comes from another of Dick's essays, \\"If You Find This World Bad, You Should See Some of the Others\\", in which Dick considers that many alternate realities are occurring simultaneously with the current one, and may come to see those though the subconscious. Journalists from Ars Technica and Motherboard have noted the game shares many similarities with Dick's 1981 VALIS, the first of a planned trilogy, which presents a story in which human behavior is controlled by an external intelligence. The game was developed with financial support from the French broadcaster Arte, and was released to coincide with an Arte mini-series on the writer. Though the game was meant to be a tribute to Dick, the developers could not get appropriate rights from Dick's estate to use his name in any of the promotional materials for the title. Reception Wireds Julie Muncy wrote that while Californias mechanic of finding the hidden glyphs may become tedious, the game performed well as a \\"deep dive\\" in the ideas Philip K. Dick wrote about. Daniel Oberhaus for Motherboard similarly found the gameplay overly repetitive and felt because the developers could not attach Dick's name to the game, the game's connection to the author was weak, using only the more obscure biographical facts about Dick's life to make the association. Oberhaus though praised the game's visuals and attention to era- specific details. Martin Robinson of Eurogamer similarly found the details relating to Dick and his writings to be well done, but the central gameplay mechanic of finding the hidden glyphs become frustrating as there seemed to be no logic into how to reveal some of the glyphs. Rock Paper Shotguns John Walker commented that the approach of showing the bubbles of alternate realities was \\"extraordinary as a piece of level design\\", while some of the attempts at meta-fictional narration had been better accomplished in The Stanley Parable.

Biography  The details of his early life are unclear. He apparently began by studying medicine in Kiev, then switched to the Imperial Academy of Arts in Saint Petersburg, where he studied painting and lithography. In 1848, he was one of the artists who provided illustrations for Topographical Anatomy of the Human Body by Nikolay Pirogov. From 1852 to 1860, he was Director of the theater in Zhitomir, where he designed sets for an early production of Halka, by Stanis≈Çaw Moniuszko.

At a young age Lessa had a penchant to acting, and eventually took lessons at the prestigious O Tablado Theater.Teatrop√©dia: Bia Lessa One of her first acting credits was in an adaptation of Maria Clara Machado's Maroquinhas Fru-Fru, made by Wolf Maya. She later founded her own theater group, Carranca, alongside Gilda Guilhon and Daniel Dantas, and one of the first plays they ever performed was Bertolt Brecht's Mr Puntila and his Man Matti.Ita√∫ Cultural: Bia Lessa In 1981 she acted in Nelson Rodrigues' O Eterno Retorno and in Antunes Filho's adaptation of M√°rio de Andrade's novel Macuna√≠ma; she was one of Filho's major collaborators for two years. She would, however, abandon her acting career to become a theater director, and in 1983 she directed her first play, an adaptation of Graciliano Ramos' novel A Terra dos Meninos Pelados. Her play was very well received, what would inspire her to direct further plays, her most famous outputs being adaptations of Virginia Woolf's Orlando (starring Fernanda Torres in the title role), Anton Chekhov's Three Sisters, Robert Musil's The Man Without Qualities and Jules Verne's Journey to the Center of the Earth. Most (if not all) of her plays count with the participation of her husband, musician Dany Roland, who contributes with the sound design and occasionally the soundtrack itself. In 1997 Lessa and Roland directed their first independent full-length film, the critically acclaimed Crede-Mi, which was loosely based on Thomas Mann's 1951 novel The Holy Sinner.

As winners of one of the Division Series and the team with the best regular season record in the National League, the Cubs earned home- field advantage regardless of opponent. The series was the 47th in league history. FS1 televised all of the games in the United States. The Cubs would go on to defeat the Cleveland Indians in the World Series in seven games, after overcoming a 3‚Äì1 series deficit, winning their first World Series championship for the first time in 108 years, ending the Curse of the Billy Goat. Background The 2016 NLCS was the Cubs' second consecutive NLCS appearance and fifth overall. Chicago lost its first four NLCS appearances, in 1984, 1989, 2003, and most recently were swept in the 2015 National League Championship Series. This was the first time the Cubs have made back-to-back NLCS appearances. The Cubs had not won a World Series championship since 1908 or played in the World Series since 1945. This was the Dodgers' 11th overall appearance in the NLCS. Los Angeles was in the NLCS for the first time since losing the 2013 National League Championship Series to the St. Louis Cardinals. The Dodgers split their previous ten NLCS appearances, with their most recent victory in 1988, the same year they last appeared in and won the World Series. This was the second postseason meeting between the Cubs and the Dodgers. Their only other postseason series was the 2008 National League Division Series, in which the Dodgers swept the Cubs in three games, this postseason matchup would happen again in the 2017 NLCS, with the Dodgers winning four games to one. The Cubs won the regular season series 4 games to 3. Chicago won three of the four games played at Wrigley Field from May 30 to June 2, while Los Angeles took two out of three games played at Dodger Stadium from August 26 to 28. With the Cubs' and Dodgers' appearances, the winning team was guaranteed to end a pennant drought of at least 28 years. The last time an NLCS had two teams that had pennant droughts of more than 25 years was 1989, when the Giants had a 27-year drought and the Cubs a 44-year drought. Summary Game summaries =Game 1= With Clayton Kershaw needed to unexpectedly close out the 2016 National League Division Series against the Washington Nationals and Rich Hill having to start that game on three days' rest, the Dodgers turned to Kenta Maeda to open this series. Opposing him was Cubs' ace Jon Lester. Chicago got to Maeda early. Dexter Fowler singled to lead off the first and scored on Kris Bryant's double. Jason Heyward tripled to lead off the second and scored on Javier B√°ez's double. Baez moved to third on a wild pitch, then stole home to make it 3‚Äì0 Cubs. He became the first Cub to steal home in the postseason since 1907. Lester pitched well, allowing only one run (a pinch-hit home run by Andre Ethier in the fifth) in six innings. In the top of the eighth, the Dodgers loaded the bases with no outs on two singles and walk off Mike Montgomery and Pedro Strop. Aroldis Chapman in relief struck out Corey Seager and Yasiel Puig, but Adri√°n Gonz√°lez tied the game with a two-run single to center In the bottom of the inning, Miguel Montero's pinch-hit grand slam off Joe Blanton was followed by a Dexter Fowler homer on the next pitch to put the Cubs back in front 8‚Äì3. The Dodgers got a run off H√©ctor Rond√≥n in the ninth when Joc Pederson singled with one out and scored on Andrew Toles's double, but Chase Utley lined into an inning-ending double play as Game 1 marked the Cubs' first victory in a National League Championship Series since Game 4 of 2003. They had previously lost seven straight NLCS games. =Game 2= Game 2 featured a matchup between two of the league's stingiest pitchers in 2016, in terms of earned run average. Clayton Kershaw and Kyle Hendricks were the top two in ERA in baseball, although the former didn't have enough innings to qualify. The start marked the fourth appearance in ten games for Kershaw in the 2016 playoffs. For Hendricks, this was his first appearance since being struck on the forearm by a line drive by √Ångel Pag√°n in Game 2 of the National League Division Series. The game lived up to the billing of a pitcher's duel. Kershaw pitched seven shutout innings and the Dodgers edged the Cubs, 1‚Äì0, to even up the series at one. There were just five hits. The only run scored in the second inning on a home run by Adri√°n Gonz√°lez. Hendricks pitched 5‚Öì innings of one-run ball, while four Cub relievers allowed three baserunners over 3‚Öî innings. Kenley Jansen, whose previous outing in the NLDS was a seven-out, 51-pitch outing, got the first six-out save of his career. It was the Dodgers' first six-out save in a postseason since Jay Howell in Game 4 of the 1988 World Series. Jansen needed just 18 pitches as the Dodgers tied the series at a game apiece. Game 2 was the Cubs' second 1‚Äì0 game of the postseason and first loss since Babe Ruth and the Boston Red Sox blanked them in the 1918 World Series opener at Comiskey Park. This was also the first time the Dodgers had won a Championship Series game on the road since Game 5 of the 1988 NLCS against the Mets. =Game 3= This was Jake Arrieta's first start at Dodger Stadium since his no-hitter on August 30, 2015. Opposing him was journeyman Rich Hill, a former Cub. The Dodgers opened the scoring in the bottom of the third inning. Andrew Toles led off with a single to left, advanced to second base on a ground out by Hill, then scored with two outs on a Corey Seager single to left field. Yasmani Grandal made the score 3‚Äì0 in the fourth with a two-run homer to right field. The Dodgers tacked on another in the sixth as Justin Turner drilled a homer to center field, chasing Arrieta from the game. Hill, meanwhile, pitched six innings, limiting the Cubs to two hits and two walks with six strikeouts on 93 pitches. Joe Blanton threw an inning in the seventh and Grant Dayton and Kenley Jansen combined to do so in the eighth. In the bottom of the eighth, against reliever Mike Montgomery, Yasiel Puig singled with one out and came around to score on a double down the left-field line by Joc Pederson, improving the Dodgers' lead to 5‚Äì0. Pederson would steal third base and score on a Grandal groundout, making it 6‚Äì0. Jansen pitched the ninth to end the game. This was the first time the Dodgers shut out a team back-to-back in the postseason in their history. It was just the fourth time in LCS history a team posted consecutive shutout wins. It marked the first time the Cubs had been blanked in back-to-back games since May 27‚Äì28, 2014. The Cubs hitting slump continued as the 2-3-4-5 hitters went 3‚Äì27 in the two shutouts. The win gave the Dodgers a 2‚Äì1 series lead. =Game 4= Looking to break their two-game scoring drought, the Cubs sent playoff veteran John Lackey to the mound while the Dodgers went with Julio Ur√≠as, the youngest pitcher to start a game in postseason history. The Cubs' struggles continued as Ur√≠as held them without a hit through three innings. In the bottom of the second, the Dodgers had a scoring chance denied as Adri√°n Gonz√°lez was thrown out at the plate by Jason Heyward after an Andrew Toles single. Dodger manager Dave Roberts called a video review but the call stood. In the fourth, the Cubs' bats began to awaken. Ben Zobrist notched their first hit with a leadoff bunt. Javier B√°ez and Willson Contreras followed with singles to score Zobrist, the first Cub run in 22 innings. A Heyward groundout scored another run and left Contreras at third for Addison Russell. On a 2‚Äì0 pitch, Russell broke out of his slump with a two-run homer to put the Cubs up 4‚Äì0. Ur√≠as was lifted one batter later. In the top of the fifth, Anthony Rizzo's home run on a full count made it 5‚Äì0. Back-to-back walks to begin the bottom of the fourth forced Lackey from the game. Reliever Mike Montgomery gave up a single to load the bases before striking out Corey Seager. A single off Montgomery's glove by Justin Turner brought in two runs, and the Dodgers reduced the lead to 5‚Äì2. Montgomery retired the next two batters to end the threat. In the top of the sixth, the Cubs blew the game open. Russell singled and reached second on a throwing error. Montgomery and Dexter Fowler both singled to score Russell. Following a Kris Bryant walk, Rizzo's single scored two runs to make it 8‚Äì2. Following a single by Zobrist to load the bases, B√°ez hit a sacrifice fly to center fielder Joc Pedersen, whose throw to home got by the catcher. Bryant and Rizzo both came home, ballooning the lead to 10‚Äì2. The Cub bullpen shut down the Dodgers and the series was tied at two games apiece. =Game 5= Game 1 starters Jon Lester and Kenta Maeda returned. Chicago started the scoring in the first inning on a single by Dexter Fowler and an RBI double by Anthony Rizzo, but the Cubs left runners on base in the first, second, fourth, and fifth innings without another run. The Dodgers tied the game in the fourth following a Howie Kendrick double and steal of third. Adri√°n Gonz√°lez hit a ball to Rizzo, who could not field it cleanly, Kendrick scoring. The Dodgers lifted Maeda in the fourth inning. In the sixth, Javier B√°ez continued his strong post-season by singling. Addison Russell homered to center field to break the deadlock and put the Cubs up 3‚Äì1. After stranding two more runners in the seventh, the Cubs broke the game open in the eighth. Russell reached on an error and pinch hitter Willson Contreras singled. Also pinch-hitting, Albert Almora, Jr. bunted the runners over, Dexter Fowler following with a run-scoring infield single.. An infield single by Kris Bryant scored Contreras. A walk by Ben Zobrist loaded the bases for Baez, whose bases- clearing double put the Cubs up 8‚Äì1. The Dodgers scored a run in the bottom of the eighth off Pedro Strop on a double by Carlos Ruiz. Cub closer Aroldis Chapman pitched the ninth. He allowed a run-scoring single by Josh Reddick and a sacrifice fly by Andrew Toles to make the score 8‚Äì4, but induced Justin Turner to ground out to end the game. The win put the Cubs on the brink of the World Series as the series moved back to Wrigley Field. =Game 6= Cubs pitchers Kyle Hendricks and Aroldis Chapman combined to allow only two hits and one walk, facing the minimum 27 batters, the first time this had occurred in postseason play since Don Larsen's perfect game in the 1956 World Series. The Cubs won the series four games to two and won the pennant for the first time since 1945, clinching a pennant at home for the first time since 1932. Hendricks pitched 7‚Öì shutout innings, allowing just two hits and walking none. After he allowed a single in the eighth, Chapman entered and forced a double play to end the eighth and a double play grounder by Yasiel Puig to end the game, series, and the Cubs' 71-year pennant drought. Anthony Rizzo and Willson Contreras each hit home runs and Kris Bryant, Ben Zobrist, and Dexter Fowler each drove in a run as the Cubs jumped to a 5‚Äì0 lead in the fifth inning. Of the four Dodgers to reach first base, none reached second: Andrew Toles (single, first inning), Josh Reddick (single, eighth inning), and Carlos Ruiz (walk, ninth inning) were all retired on double plays. Reddick reached on a fielding error in the second inning but was picked off at first by Hendricks. As a result, the Cubs faced the minimum number of batters, 27, to complete a nine-inning Major League Baseball game, a rarity in a postseason contest. (Don Larsen's perfect game in the 1956 World Series was the only other occurrence. The Dodgers' World Series drought reached 28 years with the loss. Dodgers starter Clayton Kershaw could not repeat his Game 2 magic, giving up five runs and two home runs, being replaced in the sixth inning. Relief pitcher Kenley Jansen shut out the Cubs for three innings in the loss. Javier B√°ez and Jon Lester won NLCS co-Most Valuable Player honors. =Composite line score= 2016 NLCS (4‚Äì2): Chicago Cubs beat Los Angeles Dodgers.

As division champions, the Indians had home-field advantage for the series over the Blue Jays, who were a wild-card team. The Indians defeated the Blue Jays four games to one. The series was the 47th in league history. TBS televised all games in the United States, with Sportsnet, a property of Toronto Blue Jays owner Rogers Communications, airing all games in Canada using the TBS feed.

Visible are notes for the camera operator and thumbnail photographs of each player in the game. Background This was Toronto's second consecutive ALCS appearance and seventh overall. The team lost the 2015 American League Championship Series to the eventual World Series champion Kansas City Royals. The Blue Jays had previously made consecutive ALCS appearances in 1991, 1992 and 1993, losing in the former but winning both the 1992 and 1993 World Series. This was Cleveland's fifth appearance in the ALCS. The Indians won the ALCS in 1995 and 1997, but went on to lose the World Series both times. In their other two ALCS appearances, the Indians were defeated in 1998 and 2007. This was the first postseason meeting between the Blue Jays and the Indians. The Indians won the regular season series, 4‚Äì3. The two teams split a four-game series in Toronto in early July, and the Indians won two of three games in Cleveland in mid- August. Six of the seven games were decided by three runs or less, including four decided by one run. The July 1 game between the two teams at the Rogers Centre lasted 19 innings with the Indians winning that game. Canadian architect and indigenous activist Douglas Cardinal tried to file an injunction barring the Indians from using their name and logo for Games 3 and 4 in Toronto, but the application was dismissed by an Ontario judge. Summary The Indians middle reliever Andrew Miller was voted the MVP of the series. The Indians also set an MLB record with the lowest batting average by a winning team in a postseason series, hitting just .168 against the Blue Jays. Cleveland became the first club to lock up the AL pennant on the road since the Chicago White Sox did so at Angel Stadium of Anaheim in 2005. Game summaries =Game 1= Corey Kluber pitched 6‚Öì shutout innings, allowing six hits while Andrew Miller struck out five batters in 1‚Öî innings. Toronto's Marco Estrada pitched a complete game, but took the loss when Francisco Lindor's two-run home run in the sixth after a Jason Kipnis walk provided the only runs of the game. Cody Allen pitched a perfect ninth for the save. =Game 2= Rajai Davis steals second base in the bottom of the third inning of Game 2 Carlos Santana's leadoff home run in the second off J. A. Happ gave the Indians a 1‚àí0 lead, but the Blue Jays tied it in the third off Josh Tomlin when Darwin Barney singled with one out, moved to second on a groundout and scored on Josh Donaldson's double. In the bottom of the inning, Rajai Davis reached first on a force-out, stole second, moved to third on a wild pitch, and scored on Francisco Lindor's two-out single. Neither team scored for the rest of the game with Andrew Miller striking out five batters in two innings pitched and Cody Allen pitching a perfect ninth for his second consecutive save. The Indians went up a perfect 2‚àí0 in the series heading to Toronto. =Game 3= The Indians struck first off Marcus Stroman when Carlos Santana drew a leadoff walk in the first and scored on Mike Napoli's two out double, but their starter, Trevor Bauer had to leave the game in the bottom of the inning after allowing two walks and throwing 21 pitches due to a bloody pinkie finger as a result of being cut from a drone a few days earlier. Dan Otero in relief allowed a game-tying home run to Michael Saunders in the second. Napoli's home run in the fourth put the Indians back on top 2‚àí1, but the Blue Jays tied it in the fifth off Zach McAllister when Ezequiel Carrera hit a leadoff triple and scored on Ryan Goins's groundout. Jason Kipnis's leadoff home run in the sixth gave the Indians a 3‚àí2 lead. Stroman was taken out after walking Napoli with one out. Napoli moved to second on a wild pitch by reliever Joe Biagini and scored on Jos√© Ram√≠rez's single to make it 4‚àí2 Indians. Cody Allen and Andrew Miller combined to pitch three shutout innings, striking out five batters as the Indians took a 3‚Äì0 series lead. =Game 4= Josh Donaldson's two-out home run in the third off Corey Kluber gave the Blue Jays their first lead in the series. Kluber walked two straight to lead off the fourth before Ezequiel Carrera's one-out RBI single made it 2‚àí0 Blue Jays. The Indians cut it to 2‚àí1 in the fifth off Aaron Sanchez when Coco Crisp walked with one out, moved to second on a wild pitch, and scored on Roberto P√©rez's double. Their only other hit in the game came on Tyler Naquin's leadoff double in the third. In the seventh, the Blue Jays loaded the bases with no outs off reliever Bryan Shaw on a single, Shaw's fielding error, and intentional walk when Edwin Encarnaci√≥n's single scored two with Josh Donaldson being thrown out at third.

Roberto Osuna retired the Indians in order in the ninth, forcing a Game 5. =Game 5= The Indians went up 1‚àí0 in the first when Francisco Lindor singled with two outs off Marco Estrada and scored on Mike Napoli's double. They added to their lead with home runs by Carlos Santana in the third and Coco Crisp in the fourth. Ryan Merritt, Bryan Shaw, Andrew Miller, and Cody Allen shutout the Blue Jays as the Indians' 3‚àí0 win gave them their first trip to the World Series since 1997.

The three divisional winners (seeded 1-3) and a fourth team‚Äîthe winner of a one-game Wild Card playoff‚Äî played in two series. FS1 and MLB Network carried all the games in the United States. These matchups were: * (1) Chicago Cubs (Central Division champions) versus (5) San Francisco Giants (Wild Card Winner) * (2) Washington Nationals (East Division champions) vs (3) Los Angeles Dodgers (West Division champions) The higher seeded team in each series hosted Games 1, 2, and 5 (if necessary), and the lower seeded team hosted Games 3 and 4 (if necessary). This was the second postseason meeting between the Dodgers and the Nationals franchise. Their most recent meeting was in the 1981 National League Championship Series, in which the Dodgers won the National League pennant over the then-Montreal Expos in five games. The Dodgers defeated the Nationals in five games and reached the National League Championship Series for the first time since 2013. The Cubs and Giants also met for the second time in postseason play after the Giants defeated the New York Mets 3‚Äì0 in the National League Wild Card Game. Their last meeting was in the 1989 National League Championship Series, which the Giants won in five games. However, they did meet in a Wild Card tiebreaker in 1998 where the Cubs advanced, beating the Giants 5‚Äì3. The Cubs won the Division Series three games to one and advanced to the NLCS for the second consecutive year. This was the first and only playoff series loss of the Bruce Bochy-led Giants. Matchups =Chicago Cubs vs. San Francisco Giants= =Washington Nationals vs. Los Angeles Dodgers= Chicago vs. San Francisco =Game 1= The Cubs began postseason play with starter Jon Lester on the mound facing Johnny Cueto for the Wild Card Game-winning Giants. In the pitching duel, Lester scattered five hits in eight innings of work, shutting out the Giants. Cueto also blanked the Cubs allowing only two hits until the eighth inning, when Javier Baez's home run into the left-field basket put the Cubs up 1‚Äì0. Aroldis Chapman in the ninth gave up a double to Buster Posey, but earned the save as the Cubs took a 1‚Äì0 series lead. =Game 2= In Game 2, the host Cubs scored in the first inning on a Ben Zobrist single off former Cub Jeff Samardzija. Starting pitcher Kyle Hendricks had the key hit in the second inning, driving in two runs with a single up the middle. Kris Bryant drove in the Cubs' fourth run two batters later, ending Samardzija's day. In the top of the third, the Giants answered, scoring two runs on back-to-back doubles by Joe Panik and pinch-hitter Gregor Blanco and a sacrifice fly by Brandon Belt. Hendricks was hit in the arm by an √Ångel Pag√°n line drive, forcing him to leave the game. Reliever Travis Wood ended the Giants' rally and, in the bottom half of the fourth, hit a home run to put the Cubs up 5‚Äì2. The homer was the first by a relief pitcher in a postseason game since 1924. The Cub bullpen of Carl Edwards Jr., Mike Montgomery, and H√©ctor Rond√≥n shut down the Giants with Aroldis Chapman getting another save. =Game 3= The Cubs looked to sweep the series with Jake Arrieta facing the Giants' Madison Bumgarner. The host Giants were trying to extend a streak to 10‚Äì0 in their last 10 elimination games. Arrieta hit a three-run homer in the top of the second, putting the Cubs up 3‚Äì0. They threatened to chase Bumgarner in the third inning with singles by Ben Zobrist and Addison Russell, but failed to score. San Francisco scored in the third following a Denard Span double and again in the fifth after Span's triple. In the eighth, Travis Wood gave up a single and H√©ctor Rond√≥n walked a batter. Closer Aroldis Chapman came in early to seek a six-out save, but gave up a two-run triple to Conor Gillaspie to give the Giants' their first lead of the series. Chapman was lifted after getting only one out. The Giants added a run on a single by Brandon Crawford. In the ninth, trailing 5‚Äì3, Dexter Fowler led off with a walk and Kris Bryant hit a two-run home run off Giants' closer Sergio Romo. Mike Montgomery took over in the ninth for the Cubs and held the Giants scoreless for four innings. In the 13th, the Giants' Crawford leadoff double was followed by a Joe Panik walk-off double to continue the series. =Game 4= With the Giants looking to continue their streak of wins in elimination games to 11, the Cubs sent John Lackey to the mound against Matt Moore. Lackey allowed a leadoff double to Denard Span and a sacrifice fly by Buster Posey to give San Francisco an early 1‚Äì0 lead. David Ross answered for Chicago in the third with a home run, becoming the oldest catcher ever to homer in a postseason game. A run-scoring to single by Moore with the bases loaded and a force-out grounder by Span in the fourth put the Giants up 3‚Äì1. The Cubs bounced back with a run in the top of the fifth on a three-base throwing error by Brandon Crawford and a sacrifice fly by Ross. Justin Grimm relieved Lackey in the bottom of the fifth and surrendered a single to Posey and double by Crawford that just missed being a home run. Travis Wood entered and gave up a single to Conor Gillaspie and sacrifice fly to Joe Panik as the Giants went up 5‚Äì2. Moore cruised through the next three innings before being lifted to start the ninth, a Game 5 appearing inevitable. However, the Giants ended up using five pitchers in the inning. Kris Bryant singled, Anthony Rizzo walked, and Ben Zobrist doubled to make it 5‚Äì3. With runners on second and third, Cubs manager Joe Maddon decided to pinch-hit for Addison Russell (and his 95 RBIs) with Chris Coghlan. Giants manager Bruce Bochy countered with lefty reliever Will Smith and Maddon switched to rookie catcher Willson Contreras instead. Contreras promptly singled up the middle to tie the game at 5. Jason Heyward's attempted sacrifice bunt was too hard and Contreras was forced out at second, but Gold Glove winner Crawford's throw to first ended up in the dugout, allowing Heyward to reach second. Javier Baez singled up the middle to complete the Cub comeback for 6‚Äì5 lead. Aroldis Chapman struck out the side in the bottom of the ninth to end the game and series. His three saves and four save opportunities tied and set Division Series records, respectively. It marked the biggest comeback in postseason- clinching history, the Cubs becoming the fourth team to rally from three runs down in the ninth to win a postseason game and the first to do so in regulation. This was the Giants' first postseason series defeat at home since AT&T; Park opened in 2000. =Composite line score= 2016 NLDS (3‚Äì1): Chicago Cubs beat San Francisco Giants Washington vs. Los Angeles =Game 1= Plans called for retired pitcher Liv√°n Hern√°ndez to throw out the ceremonial first pitch, but after Hurricane Matthew‚Ä≤s effects on Florida made it impossible for Hern√°ndez to fly to Washington, the host team surprised the fans at Nationals Park by having Nationals starting catcher Wilson Ramos, whose season had ended with a knee injury on September 26, throw it instead. The game provided an historic first: When Dusty Baker and Los Angeles Dodgers manager Dave Roberts exchanged lineup cards before the game, it became the first postseason game in the Major League Baseball history in which two African-American managers faced one another in the postseason. The game was billed as a marquee matchup between two of the best starting pitchers in Major League Baseball, Clayton Kershaw for the Dodgers and Max Scherzer for the Nationals, but neither was particularly sharp. With rookie catcher Pedro Severino behind the plate, Scherzer gave up a home run to the second batter, Dodgers rookie shortstop Corey Seager, on his sixth pitch of the game. In the third inning, after Dodgers second baseman Chase Utley drove in Andrew Toles with an RBI single, Scherzer gave up a two-run home run to Justin Turner, giving Los Angeles a 4‚Äì0 lead. The Dodgers did not score again; Scherzer allowed no more runs before leaving the game after six innings, and the Washington bullpen also held the visitors scoreless. Kershaw pitched five innings and held onto the lead, but the Nationals repeatedly pushed him to the brink, while his frequent discussions on the mound with Dodgers catcher Yasmani Grandal incited boos from the crowd. In the second inning, after Daniel Murphy and Ryan Zimmerman singled and Anthony Rendon reached first on a fielder's choice, a Dodger error allowed Severino to reach safely and load the bases, but Scherzer popped out to end the inning. In the third, Rendon singled to drive in two runs as part of what promised to be a big inning, cutting the Dodgers‚Ä≤ lead to 4‚Äì2, but Danny Espinosa struck out to end the inning with two men on base. Severino doubled in the fourth and scored on a sacrifice fly by Trea Turner to bring Washington within 4‚Äì3, but in the fifth, with Jayson Werth and Rendon on base, Espinosa again struck out to end the inning. Although he provided his typically reliable defense, Espinosa's strikeouts left six men on base and brought three rallies to an end. Kershaw left the game after five innings and 101 pitches, having given up three runs, all earned, on eight hits and a walk with seven strikeouts. Los Angeles's bullpen followed with four innings of shutout ball, but the Nationals had ample opportunities to tie the game. In the seventh inning, Murphy walked with one out, but then got a poor jump in an attempt to steal second and was thrown out. In the eighth, Clint Robinson doubled in the first postseason plate appearance of his career and speedy Michael A. Taylor pinch-ran, but Dodgers closer Kenley Jansen struck out pinch-hitter Chris Heisey on a called third strike to end the inning. It was the Nationals' last scoring threat; they had the tying run on base in four of the game's last five innings without being able to score a single run, and left nine men on base during the game. The Dodgers won 4‚Äì3 to take a 1‚Äì0 lead in the series. =Game 2= Originally scheduled to begin at 4:08 p.m. EDT on October 8, Game 2 was postponed due to rain and rescheduled for 1:08 p.m. EDT on October 9. Retired first baseman and former National Adam LaRoche threw out the ceremonial first pitch, tossing it to his son Drake, who spent a great deal of time with the Nationals during his father's years on the team..] Game 2 began much as Game 1 had: Washington's starting pitcher Tanner Roark, starting Game 2 because Stephen Strasburg remained sidelined with an injury, struggled; for the second game in a row, Los Angeles shortstop Corey Seager hit a first-inning home run in the Dodgers‚Ä≤ second at-bat of the game; and the Dodgers‚Ä≤ starter, Rich Hill, struck out the side in the bottom of the first, as Clayton Kershaw had in Game 1. The Nationals, meanwhile, again missed a chance at a big inning when reserve catcher Jos√© Lobat√≥n, starting in the postseason due to the unavailability of the injured Wilson Ramos, hit into a double play with the bases loaded to end the second inning. The Dodgers added another run in the third inning on an RBI single by right fielder Josh Reddick; Bryce Harper made a good throw to the plate from right field, but Lobat√≥n was unable to tag Dodgers third baseman Justin Turner out at home. Dodgers starter Rich Hill used his curveball very effectively for 3‚Öî innings, and Los Angeles held a 2‚Äì0 lead in the bottom of the third when Lobat√≥n came to bat again with two outs and Daniel Murphy and Danny Espinosa on base. Lobat√≥n hit only the second postseason home run of his career,Jos√© Lobat√≥n‚Ä≤s only previous postseason home run had been a walk-off homer for the Tampa Bay Rays in 2013. (See .) and only the second postseason homer by a catcher in the history of the Montreal-Washington franchise,The only previous postseason home run by a catcher for the Montreal-Washington franchise was by Gary Carter for the Montreal Expos in 1981. (See .) driving in Murphy and Espinosa to give the Nationals a 3‚Äì2 lead, the first time they had taken the lead in the series. Although Roark had an uncharacteristically unsteady outing, the Dodgers were 0-for-6 with runners in scoring position during the first five innings even though they had the bases loaded with one out three times, at least in part thanks to good Nationals defensive plays, notably by left fielder Jayson Werth. A tiring Roark left the game in the fifth inning, after 4‚Öì innings pitched and 85 pitches, with two Dodgers on base and Washington still holding a 3‚Äì2 lead. After that, Washington's bullpen, a postseason weakness for the 2012 and 2014 teams, held the Dodgers scoreless; Marc Rzepczynski, Sammy Solis, Blake Treinen, √ìliver P√©rez, and Mark Melancon combined to give up only three walks (all by Rzepczynski) and one hit (a single yielded by Melancon) in the game's remaining 4‚Öî innings, striking out five Dodgers. The Dodgers were 1-for-9 with runners in scoring position during the game, and by the end of the game, the Nationals‚Ä≤ bullpen had pitched 7‚Öî innings in the series without giving up a run. Meanwhile, Murphy, who went 3-for-3 and scored a run, pushing his offensive output for the series‚Ä≤ first two games to 4-for-6 with two walks, drove in runs with singles in the fifth and seventh innings as Nationals fans in the crowd chanted \\"\\"MVP! MVP!\\" The Nationals went 4-for-8 with runners in scoring position, a turnaround from their previous postseason performance: From Game 5 of the 2012 National League Division Series until Lobat√≥n's homer in the third inning, they had gone only 3-for-35 in the postseason with runners in scoring position. Washington won 5‚Äì2 to even the series at one. It was the Nationals‚Ä≤ first postseason victory at home since a 2‚Äì1 win over the St. Louis Cardinals in Game 4 of the 2012 National League Division Series on October 11, 2012. =Game 3= As the series crossed the country to Los Angeles, the visiting Nationals put pressure on Dodgers starter Kenta Maeda from the outset, loading the bases in the first inning on a single and two walks; although they did not score, they forced him to throw 28 pitches. In the Dodgers‚Ä≤ half of the first, Nationals starter Gio Gonz√°lez walked Justin Turner, followed by Corey Seager staking L.A. to a 1‚Äì0 lead in the first inning, as he had in both previous games of the series, this time with a double. The Nationals' offense erupted in the third inning. Trea Turner singled and scored as Jayson Werth doubled. Bryce Harper then singled, scoring Werth to give the Nats a 2‚Äì1 lead, and Anthony Rendon followed with a 432-foot (132-meter), two-run home run into the left-field seats, putting Washington ahead 4‚Äì1. Maeda left the game after the inning, having thrown 68 pitches. After the Dodgers scored their first-inning run, Gio Gonz√°lez retired 11 of the next 12 batters. However, in the fifth inning, he gave up a two-run homer to Dodgers pinch-hitter Carlos Ruiz that narrowed the lead to 4‚Äì3. Nationals manager Dusty Baker immediately took out Gonz√°lez and, for the second consecutive game, Nationals relievers had to pitch the final 4 innings. Sammy Solis pitched 1‚Öî innings, followed by √ìliver P√©rez for a third-of-an-inning and Shawn Kelley for 1‚Öî innings, all scoreless; Kelley retired all five Dodgers, striking out three of them. The Dodgers‚Ä≤ bullpen also blanked the Nationals through the eighth inning, Washington clinging to a 4‚Äì3 lead going into the ninth. Los Angeles closer Kenley Jansen came in to pitch, hoping to give the Dodgers a chance to tie or win the game in the bottom of the inning. But Jayson Werth led off with a 450-foot (137-meter) home run into the left-field stands that gave the Nationals an important insurance run. Jansen then walked second baseman Daniel Murphy, hit Harper with a pitch and, after Rendon popped out, first baseman Ryan Zimmerman doubled off the right field wall, scoring both Murphy and Harper and knocking Jansen out of the game. By the time Washington pinch-hitter Chris Heisey came to bat with a 7‚Äì3 lead, many Dodger fans were leaving the stadium; Heisey capped the inning by scoring Zimmerman with a sacrifice fly to make the score 8‚Äì3. Nationals closer Mark Melancon pitched a perfect ninth to seal the victory, completing 4‚Öî scoreless innings by the bullpen; in the series thus far, Nationals relievers had pitched 12‚Öì innings without yielding a single run, striking out 14 Dodgers. By the end of the game, Zimmerman was hitting .455 in the series, Werth .417 and Murphy .400. The win gave the Nationals a 2‚Äì1 edge, their first lead in a postseason series since the first game of the 2012 National League Division Series. =Game 4= Facing elimination, the Dodgers opted to have their ace starter Clayton Kershaw pitch again on only three days rest. In the top of the first inning, the Nationals pressed him, with Trea Turner leading off with a walk and Bryce Harper following with a single, after which Daniel Murphy drove in Turner with an RBI single to give the Nationals a run in the first inning for the first time in the series. Nationals starter Joe Ross, however, had a rough first inning himself, hitting Justin Turner with a pitch and giving up a two-run homer to Adri√°n Gonz√°lez.Janes, Chelsea, \\"Nationals get to Clayton Kershaw, but bullpen finally breaks as Dodgers force Game 5,\\" washingtonpost.com, October 11, 2016, 9:13 p.m. EDT. With a 2‚Äì1 lead, Kershaw then settled down, allowing Washington to tie the game at two in the top of the third with singles by Trea Turner and Jayson Werth and a sacrifice fly by Murphy that drove in Turner, but otherwise keeping the Nationals scoreless until the seventh inning. Ross, meanwhile, struggled. In the bottom of the third inning, he gave up a lead-off double to Kershaw; after keeping Kershaw at second and recording two outs, he allowed a single by Justin Turner that scored Kershaw, walked Adri√°n Gonz√°lez and Josh Reddick to load the bases, and then hit Joc Pederson with a pitch, forcing Justin Turner home from third. Ross left the game with the Dodgers leading 4‚Äì2, having thrown 55 pitches in 2‚Öî innings, giving up four runs, all earned, on three hits and two walks, and striking out three. The Nationals bullpen faced another long outing. They stretched their streak of scoreless innings in the series to 14‚Öì, but with two outs in the bottom of the fifth inning, Reynaldo L√≥pez became the first Washington reliever to give up a run in the series when Reddick singled and Pederson drove him in with an RBI double, giving Los Angeles a 5‚Äì2 lead. The Nationals‚Ä≤ offense, meanwhile, finally got to Kershaw, staging a comeback in the top of the seventh inning. Danny Espinosa, who had gone 0-for-10 with nine strikeouts in the series, singled for his first hit of the 2016 postseason. He was still on first with two outs when Trea Turner singled and Harper walked to load the bases, driving Kershaw out of the game after throwing 110 pitches. Dodgers reliever Pedro Baez then hit Werth with a pitch to force Espinosa home, and reliever Luis Avil√°n gave up a single to Murphy that scored Turner and Harper, tying the game at five, with all five Nationals runs charged to Kershaw. Pitching the bottom of the eighth for Washington, Blake Treinen got the first two outs, but then hit Andrew Toles with a pitch and gave up a single to pinch-hitter Andre Ethier, followed by a single by Chase Utley that drove in Toles to give the Dodgers a 6‚Äì5 lead. Dodgers closer Kenley Jansen secured the Dodgers‚Ä≤ victory with a perfect ninth in which he struck out two Nats, and Los Angeles tied the series at two. Daniel Murphy's 2-for-3 performance in the game pushed his postseason average for 2016 to .462, and his four RBIs set a new Montreal-Washington franchise record for RBIs by a single player in a postseason game.Lee, Forrest, \\"Los Angeles Dodgers edge Washington Nationals, send NLDS to Game 5,\\" upi.com, October 12, 2016, 2:25 AM. At the end of the game, the Nationals‚Ä≤ bullpen ERA for the series stood at 1.02, with only two runs given up in 17‚Öî innings of work. Washington's starters, in contrast, had pitched only 16‚Öì innings and given up 13 runs, with a 7.16 ERA for the series. When Blake Treinen hit Andrew Toles with a pitch in the bottom of the eighth inning, it set two new Major League Baseball records: It was the first time in history that one team's pitchers hit four batters with pitches in a single postseason game,Allen, Scott, \\"Game 4 best and worst: Dodgers even series with 6-5 win over Nats,\\" washingtonpost.com, October 11, 2016, 8:56 p.m. EDT. and it was also the first time that two teams had combined to hit 11 batters with pitches in the course of a single postseason series. =Game 5= For the fifth and final game of the series, at Nationals Park, Dodgers starter Rich Hill on short rest struggled and didn't make it out of the third inning, yet gave up just one run. Max Scherzer held Los Angeles scoreless for the first six innings. Joc Pederson hit a solo homer to lead off the seventh inning and tie the game. A two-out pinch-hit single by Carlos Ruiz off Sammy Solis put the Dodgers ahead and Justin Turner's two-run triple extended it to 4‚Äì1. A two-run homer by Washington pinch-hitter Chris Heisey off Grant Dayton in the bottom of the inning made it 4‚Äì3, with the Dodgers bringing in closer Kenley Jansen to get out of the inning. Jansen threw a career high 51 pitches, working into the ninth inning. In a rare relief appearance, Dodger ace Clayton Kershaw came into the game with one out in the ninth, two days after throwing 110 pitches in Game 4 on short rest. He induced a pop-up by Daniel Murphy and struck out Wilmer Difo swinging to end the game and series. It was Kershaw's first save in the majors; the only save he had in the minors had come in his first professional season for the 2006 Gulf Coast Dodgers, a game in which Jansen was his catcher. At 4 hours, 32 minutes, this set a record for the longest nine-inning postseason game in Major League history. The seventh inning alone lasted an hour and six minutes, with seven pitching changes, six runs, four pinch-hitters, two pinch-runners, and a double switch.http://deadspin.com/the- seventh-inning-of-dodgers-nationals-was-insane-and-1787789525 This record would be passed just two years later in Game 4 of the 2018 American League Championship Series between the Boston Red Sox and the Houston Astros, which took 4 hours and 33 minutes to complete. https://www.mlb.com/gameday/red-sox- vs- astros/2018/10/17/563396?partnerId=LR_box#game_tab=box,game_state=final,game=563396 For the third time in franchise history, the Expos/Nationals blew a 2‚Äì1 lead in the postseason, both of the other times coming in 1981. In the 1981 National League Division Series, the then Expos took a 2‚Äì0 lead against the Philadelphia Phillies, lost Games 3 and 4 but won Game 5 in Philadelphia. In the ensuing NLCS against the Dodgers, the Expos also blew a 2‚Äì1 lead and lost the pennant. With the win, the Dodgers advanced to the NLCS for the first time since 2013, with this being their fourth appearance in nine seasons. =Composite line score= 2016 NLDS (3‚Äì2): Los Angeles Dodgers beat Washington Nationals.

The three divisional winners (seeded 1-3) and the winner of a one-game Wild Card playoff played in two series. The divisional winners were the Texas Rangers in the American League West with the first seed by virtue of having the best record in the American League, the Cleveland Indians in the American League Central with the second seed, and the Boston Red Sox in the American League East with the third seed. The Toronto Blue Jays beat the Baltimore Orioles in the Wild Card Game, earning the fourth seed. The top two seeds had home-field advantage, and the top seed was matched against the lowest seed. The matchups were: * (1) Texas Rangers (West Division champions) versus (4) Toronto Blue Jays (Wild Card Winner) * (2) Cleveland Indians (Central Division champions) versus (3) Boston Red Sox (East Division champions) TBS televised all the games in the United States, with Sportsnet, a property of Toronto Blue Jays owner Rogers Communications, airing the games in Canada using the TBS feeds. The Blue Jays and Indians both swept their respective opponents in three games to advance to the ALCS. Matchups =Texas Rangers vs. Toronto Blue Jays= =Cleveland Indians vs. Boston Red Sox= Texas vs. Toronto This was the second meeting between the Blue Jays and the Rangers in the postseason, the first being the 2015 American League Division Series in which the Blue Jays defeated the Rangers after losing the first two games at home, which was marked by a controversy-laden deciding Game 5 defined by Jos√© Bautista's bat flip. It was also the first series between the two teams since May 15, a game which featured multiple bench clearing skirmishes and the infamous Rougned Odor punch of Bautista. =Game 1= The Blue Jays opened the scoring in the third inning with five runs. Ezequiel Carrera walked with one out, moved to second on a wild pitch, then scored on Josh Donaldson's double. Back-to-back singles by Edwin Encarnacion and Jos√© Bautista made it 2‚Äì0. After Russell Martin walked to load the bases, Troy Tulowitzki cleared them with a triple. Rangers' starter Cole Hamels threw 42 pitches that inning, the most pitches in an inning he had ever thrown. Next inning, Melvin Upton Jr.'s leadoff home run made it 6‚Äì0. Rangers' shortstop Elvis Andrus's throwing error to first allowed Devon Travis to reach. He moved to second on a passed ball, then scored on Josh Donaldson's single to make it 7‚Äì0 and knock Hamels out of the game. The Rangers bullpen tossed 4 scoreless innings, but after back-to-back singles to lead off the ninth off Jake Diekman, Bautista hit a three-run home run amid boos from the Rangers crowd, giving the Blue Jays a 10‚Äì0 lead. Blue Jays' starter Marco Estrada went a strong 8 innings having given up only four hits and one earned run (in the ninth when Andrus hit a leadoff triple and scored on Shin-Soo Choo's groundout) on 98 pitches. =Game 2= In Game 2, Texas sent out Yu Darvish, who was unable to participate in Texas's 2015 playoff run due to recovery from Tommy John surgery. In return, the Jays responded with 20-game winner J. A. Happ. The Rangers offense, which mustered only four hits in Game 1, erupted for 13 hits in Game 2. However, three runs was all that Texas could get on the day, as their dismal hitting with runners in scoring position failed to bring home any more baserunners (the Rangers went 2-for-18 in RISP situations, and left 13 men on base). Meanwhile, Darvish gave up only five hits through five innings; however, four of those hits were home runs (a two-run home run to Troy Tulowitzki in the second after a leadoff walk, then three home runs in the fifth to Kevin Pillar, Ezequiel Carrera and Edwin Encarnacion), which tied the MLB playoff record for most home runs given up by a pitcher in a single game. The Rangers scored their first run of the game on three straight one-out singles in the fourth. In the eighth, Francisco Liriano allowed a leadoff double and one out walk before Carlos Gomez's RBI single made it 5‚Äì2 Blue Jays. Liriano was then removed from the game due to taking a line-drive off his head and later be diagnosed with a concussion. Toronto manager John Gibbons called upon his closer Roberto Osuna to get a five-out save. Osuna allowed an RBI groundout to Ian Desmond before striking out Carlos Beltran to end the inning. Then he allowed a leadoff double to Adri√°n Beltr√© in the bottom of the ninth to bring the tying run to the plate with no outs. The next three Rangers batters went down in order without being able to advance Beltre, giving the Jays a 2‚Äì0 series lead heading to Toronto for Game 3. With the loss the Rangers dropped to 1‚Äì11 in Division Series home games. This would be the last postseason game at Globe Life Park in Arlington as the Rangers would move to Globe Life Field in 2020. =Game 3= Looking to eliminate the Rangers from the playoffs for the second consecutive year, the Blue Jays sent American League ERA leader Aaron Sanchez to the mound in Game 3. The Rangers countered with starter Colby Lewis. The Rangers took their first lead of the series in the top of the first with a walk to Carlos G√≥mez, a stolen base, and back-to-back groundouts. The Blue Jays, though, took that lead away immediately in the bottom of the same inning with a two-run home run by Edwin Encarnaci√≥n and a shot by Russell Martin, making the score 3‚Äì1, Jays. The Rangers chipped away in the third with an Elvis Andrus home run to cut the score to 3‚Äì2. But the Blue Jays pulled ahead in the bottom of the same inning on an RBI double by Josh Donaldson that just stayed fair down the right field line and knocked Lewis out of the game, followed by an RBI single by Encarnaci√≥n off Tony Barnette to make it 5‚Äì2. The Rangers made it a one-run game again with a two-run home run to dead center by Rougned Odor. Sanchez would pitch into the sixth inning, leaving with two runners on and a 5‚Äì4 lead. Joe Biagini would allow a double to Mitch Moreland that just got out of the reach of Kevin Pillar that scored two runs and gave the Rangers a 6‚Äì5 lead. In the bottom of the sixth, a passed ball by Jonathan Lucroy with the bases loaded allowed Troy Tulowitzki to score the tying run. The game would go into the tenth inning tied at six. Rangers pitcher Matt Bush, pitching his third inning of relief, gave up a leadoff double to Donaldson. After an intentional walk to Encarnaci√≥n and a Jos√© Bautista strikeout, Martin hit a ground ball to shortstop Andrus. Andrus flipped the ball to Odor, who recorded the out at second and then threw on to first base in an attempt to double up Martin. But the throw went wide of first, drawing Moreland off the base and allowing Martin to reach safely; in the meantime, Donaldson never stopped running from second base and he was able to score the winning run when he slid safely under Moreland's throw to the plate. Rangers manager Jeff Banister called for a video review to see if Encarnaci√≥n had interfered with the throw to second but the call was upheld to end the game and series. Odor's error was first time in MLB history that any postseason series ended on an error. =Composite line score= 2016 ALDS (3‚Äì0): Toronto Blue Jays beat Texas Rangers Cleveland vs. Boston The Red Sox‚ÄìIndians series marked the fifth postseason meeting between the two teams, with each team winning two series. Their most recent meeting was in the 2007 American League Championship Series, in which the Red Sox overcame a 3‚Äì1 deficit to win the American League pennant. =Game 1= Dustin Pedroia led off Game 1 with a double to right field off Trevor Bauer, then moved to third on Brock Holt's single and scored two outs later on Hanley Ram√≠rez's double, but Holt was thrown out trying to score, ending the inning. Jose Ram√≠rez led off the bottom of the second with a double off Rick Porcello and scored on Lonnie Chisenhall's single to tie the game. Andrew Benintendi's leadoff home run in the third put the Red Sox back up 2‚àí1, but in the bottom of the inning, home runs by Roberto Perez, Jason Kipnis, and Francisco Lindor gave the Indians a 4‚àí2 lead. The Red Sox cut the lead to one on Sandy Leon's leadoff home run in the fifth off Bauer, who was replaced by Andrew Miller with two outs in the inning. In the bottom half, Perez hit a leadoff single, moved to second on a sacrifice fly, and scored on Kipnis's single off reliever Drew Pomeranz. Holt's leadoff home run in the eighth off Bryan Shaw made it 5‚àí4, but Cody Allen pitched 1 shutout innings for the save. =Game 2= Corey Kluber pitched seven shutout innings in Game 2, allowing three hits and three walks while Dan Otero and Bryan Shaw pitched a perfect eighth and ninth, respectively. Red Sox's David Price, after a perfect first, allowed three straight one-out singles in the second, the last of which to Brandon Guyer scoring Carlos Santana, before Lonnie Chisenhall's three-run home run put the Indians up 4‚àí0. In the fourth, Price allowed a leadoff single to Guyer, then walked Roberto P√©rez with one out before being relieved by Matt Barnes. Rajai Davis hit into a forceout at third before Jason Kipnis's single scored Perez. Guyer hit a leadoff single off Barnes in the sixth, then moved to third one out later on Dustin Pedroia's fielding error before scoring on Davis's sacrifice fly off Brad Ziegler to make it 6‚àí0 Indians, who went up two games to none in the series heading to Boston. =Game 3= The Indians struck first in Game 3 off Clay Buchholz when with runners on second and third in the fourth with one out, Tyler Naquin drove them both in with a single to right field. In the fifth, Xander Bogaerts singled with one out off Josh Tomlin and scored on Andrew Benintendi's double to make it 2‚àí1 Indians, but in the sixth, Jose Ramirez drew a leadoff walk off Drew Pomeranz, then Coco Crisp homered one out later to put the Indians up 4‚àí1. Dustin Pedroia singled to lead off the bottom of the inning off Tomlin, who was relieved by Andrew Miller. Pedroia moved to third on Mookie Betts's double and scored on David Ortiz's sacrifice fly. In the eighth, pinch hitter Travis Shaw singled with one out off Bryan Shaw. After Betts hit into a force out, Cody Allen relieved Shaw and walked Ortiz before Hanley Ram√≠rez's RBI single made it 4‚àí3 Indians. Allen pitched a scoreless ninth despite allowing a single and walk as the Indians completed a sweep of the Red Sox. This was David Ortiz's 85th and final playoff game. =Composite line score= 2016 ALDS (3‚Äì0): Cleveland Indians beat Boston Red Sox References External links *2016 American League Division Series Texas Rangers v Toronto Blue Jays at Baseball Reference *2016 American League Division Series Cleveland Indians v Boston Red Sox at Baseball Reference American League Division Series 2016 Category:Boston Red Sox postseason Category:Cleveland Indians postseason Category:Texas Rangers postseason Category:Toronto Blue Jays postseason Category:2016 in sports in Massachusetts Category:2016 in Boston Category:2016 in sports in Ohio Category:2010s in Cleveland Category:2016 in sports in Texas Category:21st century in Arlington, Texas Category:Baseball in the Dallas‚ÄìFort Worth metroplex Category:2016 in Toronto Category:October 2016 sports events in the United States ","title":"2016 American League Division Series"},{"id":"50525288","text":"The 2016 National League Wild Card Game was a play-in game during Major League Baseball's (MLB) 2016 postseason played between the National League's (NL) two wild card teams, the New York Mets and the San Francisco Giants. As both teams finished with identical 87‚Äì75 records, a tiebreaker was used to determine the host team. In accordance with MLB tiebreaking rules, the Mets earned the right to host the game by winning their season series against the Giants 4‚Äì3. The game was played on October 5, 2016 at Citi Field in Queens, New York, and the winner advanced to play the first-seeded Chicago Cubs in the NL Division Series. It was televised in the United States on ESPN. The Giants defeated the Mets, 3-0\\\\. Background This was New York's third playoff appearance as a Wild Card team, and their second consecutive postseason appearance after winning the National League pennant the previous season, while it was San Francisco's second appearance since 2014, when they went on to win the World Series. It was the second postseason meeting between the Mets and the Giants, after the 2000 National League Division Series. Game results =Line score= With the winner advancing and the loser finished for the year, each team sent its best starting pitcher to the mound, and the game was a pitchers' duel between the Mets' Noah Syndergaard and the Giants' Madison Bumgarner. Syndergaard did not allow a hit until the sixth inning, and finished with seven scoreless innings and ten strikeouts. On the other side, Bumgarner matched zeroes with Syndergaard. In the top of the sixth, with two outs and a runner on second, Curtis Granderson made a solid catch in center field on a drive by Brandon Belt to preserve the shutout. In the top of the eighth, reliever Addison Reed allowed the Giants to load the bases with two outs on a single and two walks (one intentional), but struck out Hunter Pence to end the inning. In the bottom of the inning, with a runner on second, a hard line drive by Asdr√∫bal Cabrera right at Bumgarner ended the threat. In the top of the ninth, Mets closer Jeurys Familia allowed a leadoff double to Brandon Crawford, then after Angel Pagan struck out and Joe Panik walked, journeyman infielder Conor Gillaspie hit a three-run home run to deep right to break the scoreless tie and give the Giants a 3‚àí0 lead. In the bottom of the ninth, Bumgarner returned to the mound and set down the Mets in order for a complete game shutout. Exactly as he had done in the 2014 National League Wild Card Game, Bumgarner had tossed a four-hit shutout to send the Giants to the NLDS.

Precinct COMELEC Code Number 60250021. History Guindapunan has primary education, but intermediate education students enroll at Bulao Elementary School on the nearby island of Samar. Elected officials Barangay Captain: * Lolito Tamor - Captain Newly Elected Barangay Captain: * Mateo R. Bentillo - Brgy. Chairman/Captain Councilors Name The town of Guindapunan was named after a brook flowing into a main river in the area.  Location  Said barangay is about 5 kilometers away from the town of San Jorge, going east. It is bounded in the north by Gandara River(Brgy. Proper) in the east by Brgy. Buenavista, to the south are mountain ranges and a portion of Brgy. Anquiana, to the west by the Municipality of San Jorge and Brgy. La Paz.  Main Source of Livelihood Guindapunanons are mostly farmers who sustain themselves by planting rice, corn, coconut, root-crops and other vegetables. Those who do not have any land, which can be farmed, work as labourers on the other plantations. There is an existing irrigation system in the area which is of little practical use due to the fact that there is no defined group to operate and take charge of the operation and maintenance of the system. If a system of operation and maintenance were organised, it would contribute greatly to the lives of the local farmers. Most farmers are practicing the old fashioned way of cultivating their fields. Rice is grown twice a year but the harvest is minimal. There are also farmers who harvest more, but these are the ones who have greater capital to invest in their businesses. Vegetable production at one time boomed in the area, but due to unorganised production, the production has failed because of rivalry and envy between the farmers. The people on the island are not yet ready for large scale production of goods as well as services. Literacy  Almost 80% of the populace is literate. Almost all have gone to elementary level schools, others have attended high school, some have finished college courses. There are professionals also, some are teachers, engineers, managers, while others are business proprietors. If you ask middle-age men and women today in the area, \\"Where are your daughters and sons?\\" they will just say, \\"In Manila.\\" Polit has already produced successful politicians at the Barangay level. They have already a municipal councilor and countless government employees all over Samar and Leyte area, others are in Manila and Cebu. Mind you, politicians before, even they do not have honorarium are better than politicians of today. Populace readily cooperates in Barangay works before, but this time only a few do it. The reason is that Barangay officials already have honorarium, they have money, then they may be the ones to do the maintenance works. Samar area has a rugged terrain mostly. The municipality of San Jorge is composed mainly of mountainous areas. Sloping and flat areas are devoted to agriculture. Mountain ranges are mostly bare. Cogon grass and second growth trees and shrubs are present wherever you go in the field. Previously their rivers were full of tree vegetation along the banks, but now, all you will see are grasses and cultivation. In a matter of years, our town will be out of bigger trees, because whenever rain falls, floods readily come rushing to the lowland areas.

Origins In the late 2000s, around the time he was directing the short film, Marcel the Shell with Shoes On, Camp was digging through clips on the user-generated content platform YouTube when he stumbled across over 100 hours of home video footage documenting the life of an unknown American family and uploaded to the internet between 2008 and 2015.

The book records his experiences when serving as an officer in the Israeli army during the 2006 Lebanon War and recounts autobiographically his long period of recovery from the wounds he sustained in battle. The book was originally published in Hebrew by Yedioth Books in 2008, and became a bestseller, and in English translation under this title in 2016. The army's former chief of staff, General Moshe Ya'alon, wrote a laudatory foreword. Synopsis The book describes the Second Lebanon War from the perspective of a platoon commander in the Golani Brigade. It records the preparations for battle, the fighting itself, and the responsibilities and challenges that faced him as he led his men forward under fire. The first section records how the kidnapping of Gilad Shalit compelled Israel to respond and fight in Gaza. Battalion 51, part of the Golani Brigade, entered Gaza. From fighting there the soldiers were called to fight in the north, in what came to be called the Second Lebanon War and forms the subject of the second section. Among the many engagements, the most memorable was the Battle of Bint Jbeil in which Roi Klein, the deputy-battalion-commander was killed together with seven officers and men. Among the fallen was Amichai, the author's closest friend, and Asael describes the terrible experience of finding himself holding the dead body of his dearest comrade. It is to the latter's memory that the book is dedicated. After many days' fighting at Bint Jbeil, the author himself was severely wounded when an anti-tank missile hit his vehicle. Then comes the period of his personal struggle, the mental strength he needed in order to undergo numerous operations, lengthy hospitalization, and a protracted period of rehabilitation during which he learned to walk again. In addition to those personal experiences, there emerge certain stories connected with the past, such as the discovery that the nurse who tended his grandfather, Iser Lubotzky, when injured as a partisan fighting against the Nazis was the mother of the doctor who was treating Asael.The 19th Biannual IMA World Fellowship Conference, Israel Medical Association Journal No. 12, November 2009. As a result of his experiences during his hospitalization, Asael determined that he too would study medicine and, despite the fact that he walks on crutches, Lubotzky has since then become a qualified pediatrician working at the Shaare Zedek Hospital in Jerusalem. Title of the book The title of the book has a double source. It records the geographical area in which he fought, but it also refers to the biblical verse Deuteronomy 11:24: \\"Every place whereon the soles of your feet shall tread shall be yours: from the wilderness and Lebanon, from the river, the river Euphrates, even unto the uttermost sea shall your coast be\\", defining the boundaries of the Promised land. There is the further implication that the Desert and Lebanon represent different emotional situations - the first symbolizing the difficult period of his rehabilitation, and the second representing the resilience it demanded. Reception The book became a bestseller and received wide coverage,A wounded soldier who became one of Israel's best-selling authors has become a father, Maayana Miskin, Arutz Sheva, 16 September 2010. perhaps because it recorded acts of heroism in a war that was perceived by many as a failure. Former IDF chief of staff and former Israeli Defense Minister, Lt. General Moshe (Bogie) Ya'alon, wrote in the Foreword: Many reviews of the book saw it as representing 'the beautiful Israel', the embodiment of modern Zionism, while others felt that it should have criticized more forcefully the political and military leadership of the war. The English translation of the book was launched on October 20, 2016, in Jerusalem at an evening event entitled \\"Faith and Doubt in Times of Uncertainty\\". The speakers were Rabbi Shlomo Riskin, Brigadier-general Avigdor Kahalani, and the author, Asael Lubotzky.Faith and Doubt in Times of Uncertainty, Book launch of From the Wilderness and Lebanon. October 20, 2016 Today the book serves as a text in the IDF's officers' course. Author Lieutenant Asael Lubotzky in IDF service prays with tefillin. Asael Lubotzky grew up in Efrat, studied at the Hesder yeshiva in Ma'ale Adumim, was accepted to Shayetet 13, but chose to enlist in Golani's 51st Battalion. He underwent a training course as a combat soldier and was chosen as the outstanding company cadet. After completing Officer Candidate School Asael served as an officer commanding a platoon of the Golani Brigade. He led his platoon in the fighting in Gaza and, during the Second Lebanon War, fought in many battles in which many of his comrades were killed and wounded, until his own severe injury in the Battle of Bint Jbeil left him with a disability. After his rehabilitation from the injury, he began studying medicine at the Hebrew University Hadassah Medical School, qualified as a doctor, and is now specializing in pediatrics at the Shaare Zedek Hospital in Jerusalem.The Hero Healer, Noga Tarnopolsky, Jewish News, 29 September 2016.

She started showing her work in 1990, and has participated in many group shows alongside other artists known for their portrayals of family, society, and everyday subjects, such as Nan Goldin, Shirin Neshat, Pipilotti Rist and Wolfgang Tillmans. She has traveled internationally for her work, spending time in Japan, Poland, Scotland, Paris, and England, amongst other places.

While creating images that evoke fantastical emotion using technological processes, she simultaneously embraces a sense from 19th century romanticism while addressing themes of domesticity and nature.2007 Gladstone, Valerie: ‚ÄúAnnelies Strba,‚Äù, Artnews, September] ≈†trba uses a digital camera to capture moments and figures in film and still, which she then colors with the aid of computer programs. This digital manipulation provides ≈†trba's images with a sense of painterliness and allows her to abandon naturalism and realist details in favor of complex visual textures. She often photographs around the family homes just outside of Zurich or in the Swiss mountains, where they spend many weekends and holidays. The product is a personal and poetically abstract documentation of the life around her, capturing her subjects at the dining room table, grooming, in the chaos of untidy rooms, or surrounded by nature.

Biography  Wesker grew up in the Rothschild Buildings, a block of flats in Spitalfields, tenanted mainly by Jewish families. She was on the executive committee of the National Union of Tailors and Garment Workers (NUTGW) before joining the United Ladies Tailors' Trade Union (ULTTU), a Jewish trade union. Wesker was involved in the organisation of many strikes by garment workers in the East End. At Goodman's trouser factory in 1926, where she worked as a machinist, she led the all- female workforce in a walk out demanding a farthing a pair. In 1928 she organised 600 young women at the Rego Factory on Bethnal Green Road. The strike lasted for 12 weeks until the workers won at Christmas. As the strike was not recognised by the national leadership of the NUTGW, the workers raised money by singing \\"strike songs\\" and collecting money around London, activities orchestrated by Wesker. In 1929 she took a leading part in the strike at Polikoff's, a factory at 148-160 Mare Street in Hackney, and in 1930 she led a strike at the Simpson factory, also in Hackney.http://www.grahamstevenson.me.uk/index.php?option=com_content&view;=article&id;=1248:wesker- sarah&catid;=23:w&Itemid;=106 In 1929, Wesker was a founding member of the United Clothing Workers' Union (UCWU). She was the only female member of its executive committee, and later became its full-time women's organiser.Kershen, A. (1995). Uniting the tailors : Trade unionism among the tailoring workers of London and Leeds, 1870-1939. Ilford: Cass. The UCWU was absorbed into the NUTGW in 1935. Wesker again sat on the NUTGW executive committee and her appointment in 1937 as NUTGW women's organiser signalled a new approach to female workers. She helped women to become organised in a number of large factories. Wesker was elected to the Communist Party of Great Britain's Central Committee at the 12th Congress in 1932. Along with other women, she took part in the Battle of Cable Street on 4 October 1936. Wesker was fluent in English and Yiddish and was known to be a fiery speaker, able to inspire the older women workers in the factories.

At that institution, he built his reputation in the area of Keynesian Economics. His focus was on first principles, in which he added notable contributions to the Keynesian literature such as hydraulic Keynesianism, which established that there are stable macroeconomic flow inherent in the Keynesian system for its functioning in the policy area, without having to fall back on accounting flows. Coddington methodological contribution to economics was based on positive economics, where his presentation of the propositions as Stylize Facts has help to popularize the methodology. He contribution in bargaining theory was not just to recite the Cournot or Nash behavioral assumptions in economics, but to seek new a new research program for the formation of agents action-reaction behavior.

Inspired by the intelligence amplification effects that occur within flocks of birds, schools of fish, and swarms of bees, Unanimous enables people to achieve similar benefits by forming \\"artificial swarms\\" online. Known as Artificial Swarm Intelligence (ASI), the core technology enables groups to efficiently combine their knowledge, wisdom, insights, and intuitions into an emergent intelligence that is sometimes referred to as a \\"hive mind.\\" Unanimous has deployed swarm-based technologies through a cloud-based server Swarm.ai, (formally UNU) which enables online groups to answer questions, reach decisions, and make predictions by thinking together as a unified intelligence. This process has been shown to produce significantly improved decisions, predictions, estimations, and forecasts, as demonstrated when predicting major events such as the Kentucky Derby, the Oscars, the Stanley Cup, Presidential Elections, and the World Series. Unanimous is also the provider of Swarm Insight and Swarm IQ, two on-demand intelligence services using their SaaS platform called Swarm. In 2018, Swarm AI technology from Unanimous won the Best AI and Machine Learning Technology Award at the South by Southwest (SXSW 2018) Innovation Awards, as well as winning the overall Best in Show Award for technology at SXSW 2018. In 2018, Unanimous AI also made headlines with Stanford University School of Medicine by amplifying the intelligence of medical doctors using the Swarm platform, enabling significantly more accurate diagnoses than traditional methods or deep learning. Building a \\"Hive Mind\\" using Swarm AI technology In 2019, the Swarm platform from Unanimous AI was featured on the Amazon Original Series, Giant Beast That is The Global Economy, starring Kal Penn and showcasing inventor Louis Rosenberg. In the episode, Amazon producers brought in a group of random people from the general public and had them use Swarm to forecast box-office results for summer movies (2018). As shown in the episode, the group of people, connected together into a \\"hive mind\\" using the Swarm software, correctly forecasted that Incredibles 2 was going to significantly outperform other highly anticipated films at the box-office, including Solo: A Star Wars Story and Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom.  History  Unanimous AI was founded by entrepreneur and inventor, Louis Rosenberg, as a means of building intelligent systems that keep human values, morals, wisdom, and sensibilities deeply embedded in the process. By keeping people \\"in the loop\\", swarm-based systems may prove safer in the long term than traditional approaches to AI  swarm.ai  Unanimous AI has deployed a \\"human swarming\\" platform known as \\"swarm.ai\\" (formally called UNU) that allows distributed groups of users to login from anywhere in the world and think together as real-time closed-loop systems to answer questions, make predictions, generate ideas, and reach decisions. 280x280px  2016 Kentucky Derby  Challenged by a reporter with TechRepublic, Hope Reese, Unanimous AI used their Swarm AI system to predict the winners of the 2016 Kentucky Derby. The Swarm's single pick for the top four horses was published by TechRepublic on May 6, 2016. The following day, the race was won and the four horses that had been picked (Nyquist, Exaggerator, Gun Runner, and Mohaymen) finished in the exact order that the system predicted and that TechRepublic published. The odds for making such a pick were 542 to 1, which would yield $54,000 on a $100 bet. Hope documented her own bet of $1, which earned $540.  Medical Applications  In 2018, Unanimous AI, in collaboration with researchers at Stanford University Medical School, conducted a series of trials wherein small groups of radiologists were connected together into \\"hive minds\\" using Swarm software. As reported in IEEE Spectrum, and published at Society for Medical Imaging Informatics in Medicine (SIIM)‚Äôs Machine Intelligence conference, results showed that when thinking together in swarms, diagnostic errors were reduced by over 30%.

It was the first state college established in Ogun State. As well as providing health technology training and certification, it is a major factor in both increasing the population and enhancing the status of Ilese, a town on the outskirts of Ijebu Ode. History The college was established on 28 September 1976 as a school under a department in the Ministry of Health during the military administration of Saidu Balogun. At inception, the institution was located temporarily at Itamogiri in Ijebu East local government area in 1982. The primary objective of the college is to train middle level for the delivery of primary healthcare services for the state. The college has since surpassed this mandate by providing quality health care workers for primary, secondary and tertiary health care delivery system not only for Ogun State, but also for neighbouring states and federal institutions. Being the first tertiary institution in the state, its general importance to the overall primary healthcare delivery in the state, as well as being the single largest producer of primary health care workers accounting for over ninety percent (90%) of the total health manpower needs of the twenty local governments in the state; the impact of its contribution to primary health care spurred the state government to upgrade it to a college with polytechnic status. The required legislation, House Bill number 27, was enacted and signed by the then governor of the state. The law is cited as Ogun State College of Health Technology Law, 2004 as amended in 2008. Location The college occupies a wide expanse of land from Ilese township road, almost reaching the Sagamu-Benin express road. This gives ample room for expansion and development. As of April 2012, Ogun State College of Health Technology had approved the private Royal Institute of Health Technology, Ifo in Arigbajo- Ifo, Ogun State to run some accredited courses. This provides access to recognized studies that would not otherwise be accessible by people in that region. Academics As well as 11 programmes approved by the National Board for Technical Education (NBTE) and national professional organizations at diploma and Higher National Diploma levels, the college can award degrees accredited by Kwara State University. Degree courses are available in environmental health, medical laboratory sciences, health information management, and other health technology fields.

The series marked James' second starring role in a CBS sitcom, following The King of Queens (1998‚Äì2007). The series began with James starring as a recently retired Nassau County, New York, police officer and father of three, married to Donna (Erinn Hayes). Beginning with season two, the character of Donna has died, and the series' new female lead is Vanessa Cellucci (Leah Remini), Kevin's former rival on the force and now his partner at their new security company, Monkey Fist Security. While the first season focused on Kevin's personal and family life, the second concerns his new profession, his relationship with Vanessa, and his adjustment to life as a single parent. On May 12, 2018, CBS cancelled the series after two seasons.  Plot  Kevin Gable is a newly retired Nassau County police officer living in Massapequa, New York, on Long Island, with his wife Donna, daughters Kendra and Sara, and son Jack Cole. He looks forward to a carefree early retirement hanging out with his friends, who are also retired officers: Goody, Duffy, and Mott. However, Kevin soon realizes his smaller pension paycheck and family challenges will put those plans on hold. His elder daughter Kendra, who was away at college, moves back into town with her unemployed fianc√©, Chale, and they begin living in the home's garage; Sara is becoming increasingly difficult, with anger-management issues; and youngest son Jack is a hypochondriac who sees the school therapist for anxiety-related issues. During the first season, Kevin holds various odd jobs to supplement his retirement income while the family deals with several issues, including Kendra's and Chale's wedding. First season episodes revolve around Kevin and Donna, although Kevin is frequently seen with his group of friends. Most scenes during the first season take place either at the Gable household or the bar Enzo's (where Kendra is employed and where Kevin hangs out with his friends). Season two picks up over a year after the events of the first-season finale. Donna has been deceased for about a year, leaving the widowed Kevin with the three kids, and now working full-time with his old work rival, Vanessa Cellucci, in their new security company, Monkey Fist Security. With the death of Donna, Kevin's reentry into the work force, and the regular inclusion of Vanessa, season two expands its focus to also feature more of the supporting characters not seen much in the first season. The Monkey Fist Security office also becomes a frequently used location.  Cast and characters  = Main = * Kevin James as Kevin Gable: The patriarch of the Gable household. As the series started, Kevin, a recently retired cop married to wife Donna, tends to get involved in some situation, which he usually solves with his down-to-earth principles, and some help from Donna. After Donna's death between the first two seasons, the widowed Kevin becomes a helicopter parent, who goes to work at a security firm with his ex- partner, Vanessa Cellucci. Kevin is a generally good man at heart, although he tends to sometimes get distracted in his goals. He cares deeply about his family and friends, and is willing to do most anything to help them. * Erinn Hayes as Donna Gable (season 1): Kevin's wife and the matriarch of the Gable household for the first season. Donna is a school nurse, until she quits in the first season finale (also her last physical appearance in the series). Donna passes away before the second season. Her father does, or did, not like Kevin, as mentioned in the pilot episode. The episode \\"The Fantastic Pho\\" reveals Kevin and Donna met at a bar, and \\"The Might've Before Christmas\\" reveals she and Kevin got together after Vanessa urged them (on their first night as partners). * Taylor Spreitler as Kendra Gable-Witt: The elder Gable daughter. Kendra is a 21-year-old college student (she gets into Columbia Law School in the first season finale), who also works as a waitress at Enzo's. Out of all the Gable kids, she has the most prominent role in the series. In the pilot, she revealed her engagement to her parents (Donna only knew they were dating, while Kevin was not even told) and moved back in with her fianc√©, Chale. Kendra is the most responsible and dependable of the Gable kids. She is also shown to be nagging at times, more specifically towards Chale after their marriage. While most of the first season shows her and Donna planning her wedding, she and Chale get married in the season two premiere, after he faces deportation. Following the death of Donna, Kendra becomes the surrogate matriarch of the family. * Ryan Cartwright as Chale Witt: Kendra's English fianc√©, later husband. He moves into the Gables' garage following the revelation of his engagement with Kendra. Chale is shown to be shy and soft-spoken, but very intelligent. Kevin initially shows hostility towards him, but their relationship somewhat improves over the course of the series. When the show first begins, Chale claims to be designing an app that will be successful; thus, Chale is unemployed for the majority of season one, working on the app. In the season two premiere, he and Kendra marry as he faces deportation. Chale begins working at Enzo's alongside Kendra in \\"Plus One is the Loneliest Number\\", and gets promoted to manager (and temporarily stops working on his app) in \\"The Kevin Crown Affair. * Mary-Charles Jones as Sara Marie Gable: The younger Gable daughter. Sara has anger management issues that are frequently mentioned throughout the series (e.g. starting a food fight, calling a family friend's baby \\"stupid\\", etc.). Sara is somewhat of a tomboy‚Äîshe excels at and loves sports, watches football, and frequently fights. Sara is also known to have a rebellious streak: she has been suspended, stolen her father's money, and even created a secret second Facebook account and snuck off with her boyfriend. Despite her hostility (especially towards her siblings), she does overall love her family. The first season saw Sara mostly in short, cameo roles; she becomes more prominent in the second season. * James DiGiacomo as Jack Gable: The son of the Gables. Jack is 11-years-old, and is portrayed as the weakest Gable child (especially when compared to Sara), and somewhat dim. He has very few friends, and is stated to be a hypochondriac. He frequently tries to make friends, but with little success. The first season saw Jack mostly in short, cameo roles; he becomes more prominent in the second season. * Gary Valentine as Kyle Gable: Kevin's older brother. He is a firefighter for the New York City Fire Department. Kyle is a bachelor, and has a crush on Vanessa (much to her dismay). Like Jack, he is also shown to have below-average intelligence, and is mainly relegated to being a cook at the Fire Department. As a part of Kevin's group, he is frequently seen with Kevin's friends, and is also seen at the Gable household. * Leonard Earl Howze as Tyrone \\"Goody\\" Goodman: Kevin's friend from the police force, who he is frequently seen with. He is married to Didi, who was good friends with Donna. In the second season, Goody begins working for Monkey Fist security. * Lenny Venito as Duffy (season 1): Kevin's friend, also newly retired from the force. He has been divorced three times.

Following the retooling, Vanessa becomes Kevin's partner in the second episode, with her own struggling company, Golden Phoenix Security (later Monkey Fist Security). Vanessa is mentioned to have several exes, many of which she has dumped for ridiculous and unbelievable reasons (e.g. helping sick kids in Africa for three years, moving to Australia), and which sometimes get her distracted (e.g., she didn't complete the task of getting liability insurance because she dumped the State Farm agent she was dating). = Recurring = * Bas Rutten as Rootger Van De Kamp, the Gables' annoying Dutch neighbor who becomes Kevin's friend.

Episodes =Series overview= = Season 1 (2016‚Äì17) = =Season 2 (2017‚Äì18)=  Production  = Development = In October 2015, it was announced Kevin James would star in a new family-comedy television series for CBS, while Rock Reuben will executive produce the series, and Bruce Helford would serve as the show runner. On May 12, 2016, CBS placed a series order. The series premiered in the 2016‚Äì17 United States network television schedule and aired at 8:00 pm. On October 17, 2016, CBS ordered a full season of 22 episodes. In November 2016, Bruce Helford exited the series as showrunner after the first thirteen episodes, due to creative differences. Cheers alum Rob Long replaced Helford as showrunner. On January 6, 2017, two additional episodes were added, bringing the season to a total of 24 episodes. The series was filmed entirely on Long Island at Gold Coast Studios in Bethpage, New York. The pilot episode was filmed on April 1, 2016. Production on subsequent episodes began taping on August 5, 2016. On March 23, 2017, CBS renewed the series for a second season, which premiered on September 25, 2017, and concluded on May 7, 2018. Season two's original order was for 22 episodes and was later increased to 24 episodes. = Casting = In January 2016, Taylor Spreitler had been cast in the series as Kendra, Kevin's daughter. In February 2016, Ryan Cartwright, Mary-Charles Jones, and James DiGiacomo had been cast in the series, as Kendra's boyfriend, and James' characters other children, respectively. That same month, Leonard Earl Howze and Erinn Hayes joined the cast portraying James' character's friend and former police partner and James' wife, respectively. In March 2016, Lenny Venito and Gary Valentine joined the cast. In September 2016, it was announced Ray Romano and Gina Brillon would guest star. In November 2016, it was announced Adam Sandler would also guest star. In March 2017, it was announced James' former King of Queens co-star Leah Remini would guest star in the first season's final two episodes. In June 2017, Remini was upped to a series regular starting with Season 2; shortly after, it was announced that Erinn Hayes would not be returning for the show's second season. Sources cited in a Variety article confirmed that Remini would be returning as Detective Vanessa Cellucci, the character she portrayed in the first-season finale, and that Hayes' dismissal was for creative reasons and \\"not a reflection\\" of the actress' performance. In August 2017, it was reported Hayes' character would be killed off before season two began and the season will take place 7‚Äì10 months after season one ended, in order to make room for Remini. = Cancellation = On May 12, 2018, it was announced that CBS officially cancelled Kevin Can Wait after two seasons, with the combination of factors, including declining ratings, CBS's desire to have an ownership stake, and the network needing to clear space for three new sitcoms in the fall 2018 schedule, led to the show's demise.  Reception  = Critical response = During the first season, Kevin Can Wait received generally negative reviews from critics. On the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the series has an approval rating of 30%, based on 23 reviews, with an average rating of 3.9/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"Kevin James proves a likable, funny lead, but Kevin Can Wait relies too heavily on predictable, unfunny jokes and a series of lackluster subplots to stand out from the crowd.\\" On Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating, the series has a score 39 out of 100, based on 17 critics, indicating \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\". With the firing of Hayes and addition of Remini in season two, the series' retooling also received negative reviews, this time heavily assessing the series as inferior to James and Remini's former show The King of Queens. = Controversy = The replacement of Erinn Hayes with Leah Remini, and how the show handled Donna Gable's death, has been a source of controversy for the series. Criticism has been levied especially on the episodes \\"Civil Ceremony\\" and \\"Grief Thief\\". In the former, which served as the season premiere, criticism was placed on the brief mention of Donna's death, via a piece of mail, and a subsequent joke many found distasteful. The later episode, the season's fifth episode, was panned for its plot that the characters use a single parents support group for getting out of work and their romantic life. The series' reduced mention of Donna following her death, as well as no specific cause to her death, has also been target of criticism. Viewers and critics of the show remain divided over the retool. Some stated the decision was a well-made one, and that the chemistry between James and Remini made the quality of the series better. Others said that Hayes' firing, and the addition of Remini with how the show handled her character's death, with poor script quality, made the show worse. Despite the division, both Hayes and Remini spoke highly of each other. Remini stated that, before Hayes' firing, she was looking forward to working with her again; Hayes (who mostly remained silent over the firing) asked fans to not place blame on Remini. It has been rumored and hinted at that the addition of co- star Leah Remini was an attempt to save the show from cancellation. Many suggested this theory is due not only to their chemistry and ability to play off one another well, but also to capitalize on their successful run on The King of Queens a decade earlier. However, James insisted the choice was purely creative, as the writers felt they were running out of ideas, and he was unsure if it would continue beyond a second season. James also stated that the original plot line of the series was to have him as a single father, but the original producers gave him a wife instead. Despite the controversy surrounding the revamp, the series' ratings remained steady. As of December 1, 2017, the series was averaging 8.2 million viewers (with delayed viewing) in the season, competing against more established Top 20 series Dancing with the Stars and The Voice. The series also performs well in the much-coveted 18-49 demographic, ranking as the fifth-highest rated program on CBS in that category. = Ratings =  Season 1 (2016‚Äì17)   Season 2 (2017‚Äì18)   Home media  The Complete First Season was released on DVD on September 5, 2017, by Sony Pictures Home Entertainment.

Airy, Philadelphia. This institution was a continuation of the work of Rev. William A. Passavant but was founded and managed by Elizabeth Fry Ashmead Schaeffer, who received a single dollar from Passavant and began the mission. The Lutheran Home in Germantown later moved to the Silver Springs property in Plymouth Meeting, Pennsylvania, where it continues as a residential treatment facility for children and school for elementary students and middle schoolers.  Story of the first dollar  The Lutheran Home in Germantown was a continuation of the work of the Rev. William A. Passavant, who was famous for his work not only as an abolitionist and Lutheran pastor, but also as one of the proponents of social ministries in the Lutheran Church through the Passavant charitable institutions that he created. This Lutheran Home in Germantown was not organically connected with the Passavant Home and Farm School of Zelienople but was an offshoot, thanks to the help of the founding director of the home in Germantown, Elizabeth Ashmead Schaeffer. In 1852, on his way to the Ministerium of Pennsylvania, Passavant stopped off in Womelsdorf, and inspected an orphanage of the Reformed Church. Reaching Philadelphia, he visited the home of Elizabeth Ashmead Schaeffer and the Pastor of St. Michael's Church of Germantown, Charles W. Schaeffer, and (as one account states) he told Mrs. Schaeffer, \\"Why cannot the Lutherans have an orphanage as well and the Reformed? Now, everything must have a beginning: I will give you the first dollar.\\" Elizabeth Schaeffer would place that dollar in her knitted purse that would be cherished by the Home in Germantown for generations.  History  After receiving the first dollar and the motivation from William Passavant, Elizabeth Schaeffer gathered women from local Lutheran churches of Philadelphia to collaborate to begin the Lutheran Home at Germantown. On March 12, 1859, they rented a house at 6719 Germantown Ave in Mt. Airy, Philadelphia. Sister Louise Marthens came with four orphaned girls from the Passavant home in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, to help get the home in Germantown off the ground. Within eight weeks seven orphans and a matron had been admitted to live in the home. Elizabeth Schaeffer became the director of the school but relied on the help of the women of the local Lutheran congregations to help her keep up with the work of the home. The women would help sew, give advice, and attend to the different needs of the building, clothing, and children. The first admitted child to the orphanage was George Silvers, who was born on May 6, 1853. By the middle of June, thirteen had been admitted and very quickly, Schaeffer and the other leaders realized that it was necessary to secure a larger space. In October, 1859, a new site was purchased at 6950 Germantown Ave, in Mt. Airy for a total of $7,000. The managers were able to $4,300 at the time of the purchase through the generosity of the members of congregations in Philadelphia and elsewhere. The property was five acres and contained multiple buildings for usage. It was within the city limits and was in easy traveling distance to the downtown portion of Philadelphia by railroad or horse carriage. The women of various congregations in Philadelphia would meet with Elizabeth Schaeffer to help ensure the longevity of the ministry. On May 1, 1860, constitution and by-laws were finalized, officers were elected and an application was sent to the state for incorporation. Two ladies were to be chosen by each of the local Lutheran congregations to be representatives to constitute the Board of Lady Managers. While the board of trustees constituted of mostly men (other than Elizabeth Schaeffer as the director), it was especially stipulated that the board of trustees were not to interfere with the internal management of the home but that responsibility fell to the Board of Lady Managers alone. In 1864, the home grew exponentially because of the number of children left orphaned by the deaths and violence of the Civil War. The Home at Germantown was one of the first to open its doors for the relief of the children. As of July 1865 there were 68 orphans, October 2nd there were 107, and by the next April there were 131.Lee, Clarence L. (1984). \\"Momento, Domine, Famulorum, Famularumque Tuorum\\". Lutheran Archives Center at Philadelphia: Reporter (Vol. 2): 2‚Äì9. From the beginning, Elizabeth Schaeffer imagined this ministry to be inclusive to all and a place that would teach the children skills and practices to excel in the world. The Home would describe itself as a place, \\"for destitute orphan children without distinction of creed or country, where they may be educated in any useful branch of business to which they may be inclined, and thus prepared for the active duties of life.\\" In 1869, it was realized that there was a need for a more sustainable financial backing. Elizabeth Schaeffer highly disliked the idea of transferring the control and responsibility, but realized the inevitable as the Home became a larger corporation. On April 9, 1872, the Board of Lady Managers transferred the control and responsibility of the Home to the Ministerium of Pennsylvania. The Board of Lady Managers became the Board of Lady Visitors, which composed of the two representatives from each local Lutheran congregation but they served in co-operating and support efforts rather than in their previous positions of leadership. = Lutheran support and education = The Lutheran Home at Germantown would not have been able to get off the ground without the help and support of the members of the local Lutheran congregations in Philadelphia. Along with donations of finances and resources, the local congregations would also provide religious education, pastoral support, and donations of Bibles to every child at the time of their confirmation. The Lutheran churches considered it a priority that the children receive religious instruction. > The Church was most concerned with the welfare of the children to its care. > They were instructed in both the English and German languages, as so many > came from German-speaking families, and so much of the support came from > German congregations. Their religious training was thorough, with > instruction in the Bible and Luther's small Catechism. They attended school > and religious services regularly. In December, 1860, Rev. J. Schladermundt became the first House-Father of the home. Throughout the early history of Home, Lutheran pastors and seminary students at The Lutheran Theological Seminary at Philadelphia (then often called the Mt. Airy Seminary), would help with the religious instruction of the students, using the Bible and Luther's Small Catechism as the textbooks. The seminary students would give assistance in numerous ways. One student, Rev. E. L. Leisey, reflected on his experience and according to his description, he served as a, \\"big brother, a Bible School teacher, playground director, chauffeur, and general utility man.\\" The Home also developed a close relationship (because of proximity and affiliation) with St. Michael's Germantown, the Lutheran Church at 6671 Germantown Ave, that was just a few blocks away. In 1874‚Äì1890, it was reported that 121 residents of the Home were confirmed into membership at St. Michael's. The children would participate in Sunday-school and take part in the annual church picnic.  Donation Day  Donation Day was an annual celebration in which the churches of the surrounding areas would gather resources and goods and bring them to the Home and visit both the children and the grounds for a day of activities. The first Donation Day took place on Ascension Day, May 27, 1881. > The day is not merely a day of donations and for the improvement of the > finances of the Home, but a day for the coming together of friends from far > and near, who are united together in the spirit of loving devotion. It has > become a general reunion day, with untold blessing to the institution and to > the cause of Christian benevolence. = Shift in Education = In 1912, a shift occurred in education. Before then, all secular instruction of the children was conducted in the Home. However, at this point in time children were allowed to attend the public school in Mt. Airy. The public instruction was supplemented by additional instruction in religion and German.  Asylum for the aged and infirm  From the beginning, the Lutheran Home at Germantown was also supposed to be an asylum for the aged and infirm. The asylum was to be open to \\"adult members of the Lutheran Church in want through old age, accident, or disease.\\" The first inmate of the asylum was Sister Margaret Kaufflet, who arrived May 10, 1860. She would not only be a resident of the home but also an invaluable presence for other residents as time went on. Sister Margaret was described as having a gentle disposition, and a sweet spirit. When other aged residents were troubled, they would be brought to her room, \\"the word of peace was spoken, and the trouble vanished.\\" The asylum is no longer affiliated with the Home but has been incorporated through other ministries of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America.  Silver Springs ‚Äì Martin Luther School  Over 100 years after its founding, the Lutheran Orphans' Home at Germantown was moved to the Silver Springs farm in Plymouth Meeting, Pennsylvania where it still resides today. While nonsectarian with regard to whom it serves (holding true to its mission from the very beginning), Silver Springs remains a Social Ministry Organization of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America. In 1969, the Silver Springs program was expanded with the establishment of Martin Luther School, a state licensed private school designed to serve the special education needs of children that live in the residential treatment facility and also children of the communities of the tristate area. = Mission Statement of Silver Springs = Holding true to the mission and values of Elizabeth Schaeffer, > The intentions of the corporation are exclusively for charitable and > educational purposes, particularly to afford a home, education, and support > for destitute or dependent children and mental health services for such > children and others without distinction of creed, color, or country, and to > engage in related study and research. Today Silver Spring ‚Äì Martin Luther School has over 65 children in its residential treatment program and over 200 students in its schools with grades from Kindergarten through eighth grade.

He died in The Holocaust at the end of the war, after almost all his family were killed by the Nazis. The letters Zytomirski had sent and received during the war document a lost struggle of a brave man who died shortly before the war ended. The information regarding the short life of his son Henio, who became an icon of the Holocaust in Poland, became known to the public from his father's letters. The circumstances of Shmuel Zytomirski's death remain mysterious and are unknown to this day.  Biography  = Youth = Shmuel Zytomirski was born in Warsaw (now in Poland, but then in Imperial Russia) on 16 September 1900. His father, Ephraim (1880‚Äì1941), who was born in the little town of Medzhybizh () in Podolia (now in Ukraine) was a member of Hovevei Zion, a follower of the Mizrachi movement,Kantor Theodor Herzl, The 'Mizrachi' movement in Lublin, In: \\"Encyclopedia of the Jewish Diaspora: A Memorial Library of Countries and Communities - Poland Series: Lublin Volume\\", Jerusalem, 1957, p 449, in Hebrew one of the Yavne School founders in LublinMeisles, A.C., 'Yavneh' school.

Shmuel's mother, Chaya Devora (n√©e Melamed) (1882‚Äì1942), was born in Riga (now the capital of Latvia, but then in Imperial Russia).

During World War I the economic conditions in Warsaw became worse. In 1917, the Zytomirski family moved to Lublin, hoping to improve their economic status. = Teacher and educator = Young Shmuel Zytomirski was a teacher in the Tarbut school in the town of Bychawa. His attempts to emigrate from Poland to Mandatory Palestine had failed. After completing a year of study at the University of Vienna, he came back to Lublin in 1922 and continued to teach. He was an idealistic devoted teacher. Zytomirski had taught his students the best works of art of the modern Hebrew poets and writers (Constitution Generation): Bialik, Tchernichovsky, Peretz and Frug. In his students' hearts he implanted the Zionist vision and the desire for leaving diaspora and aiding the national renewal of the Jews in the Land of Israel. While teaching he used various advanced pedagogical methods: plays, poetry, public declamation of pieces, and trips out-of-town.Sheingarten, Noah. 'Profile of a teacher'. In: J. Adini (Ed.), Bychawa: A memorial to the Jewish community of Bychawa, Lubelska. Tel Aviv, 1969, pp. 243‚Äì245. = Zionist leader = Zytomirski's best efforts were dedicated to Zionist activity, which had national and social orientation. He was the chairman of Poale Zion (Z.S.) party in Lublin.Zuckerman, Meyer. 'The Palestine labor movements: Ze'ire Zion and Poale Zion (Z.S.)'. In: Encyclopedia of the Jewish Diaspora: A Memorial Library of Countries and Communities \\"Poland Series: Lublin Volume\\", Jerusalem, 1957, pp. 401‚Äì406. Zytomirski and his party took actions in the community council and in the community committee for the poor and for Zionist enterprises and institutions. Thanks to the efforts of the Poale Zion (Z.S.) party, the community council allocated substantial funds for several important organizations - CYSZO (The Central Organization of Yiddish Schools), the Tarbut Hebrew school, the National Funds (JNF and Keren Hayesod), HeHalutz movement and Hapoel sport association (the first Hapoel club in Poland was founded in Lublin) - as well as for evening classes organized by the Poale Zion (Z.S.) party. Thanks to the efforts of the Zionist parties, several rooms at the community house on 41 Krawiecka street were renovated and given to the Hakhshara Kibbutzim. These kibbutzim were the cores of Yad Mordechai and Negba kibbutzim in the land of Israel.Zuckerman, Meyer. 'The community in the years 1932-1939'. In: \\"Encyclopedia of the Jewish Diaspora: A Memorial Library of Countries and Communities - Poland Series: Lublin Volume\\", Jerusalem, 1957, pp. 373‚Äì376. Often Zytomirski and his party members participated in lectures and meetings which were held in towns near Lublin: Piaski (Lublin Province), Lubartow, ≈Åƒôczna, Krasnik, Bychawa and Bilgoraj. Frequently there were district conferences of the Poale Zion (Z.S.) party, in which representatives from the central committee in Warsaw were present. Zytomirski was a member of the Central Committee of the League for Working Eretz Israel. The league carried out an extensive explanatory and cultural activities agenda. Famous people came to Lublin and lectured in the league's meetings: Zalman Shazar (Rubashov), the author Nathan Bistritzky (Agmon) and Eliyahu Dobkin.Zuckerman, Meyer.

In: \\"Encyclopedia of the Jewish Diaspora: A Memorial Library of Countries and Communities - Poland Series: Lublin Volume\\", Jerusalem, 1957, p. 389. He was also a member of the youth movement 'Dror' and its culture committee,Zuckerman, Meyer. 'The Movement for Working Eretz Yisrael, Chapter V: HaDror'. In: \\"Encyclopedia of the Jewish Diaspora: A Memorial Library of Countries and Communities - Poland Series: Lublin Volume\\", Jerusalem, 1957, pp. 410‚Äì412. and attended the Executive Committee of the Tarbut Hebrew school in Lublin. In the 1930s Zytomirski was the organizer of the Lublin branch of the HIAS welfare organization.Zuckerman, Meyer. \\"The Movement for Working Eretz Yisrael, Chapter I: Ze'ire Zion and Poale Zion (Z.S.)\\". In: \\"Encyclopedia of the Jewish Diaspora: A Memorial Library of Countries and Communities - Poland Series: Lublin Volume\\", Jerusalem, 1957, p. 405. = Zytomirski and his son Henio = In the early 1930s Shmuel Zytomirski was married to Sara Oksman, who ran retail store selling stationery. In 1933 their son Henio (in Hebrew: ◊ó◊ô◊ô◊ù) was born. Henio Zytomirski, 5 July 1939 During Henio's childhood the situation of Jews in Poland became worse. In the neighbouring country of Germany the Nazi regime was established, and in post-Pilsudski Poland anti-Semitism increased. Over the window of the Zytomirski family store Anti-Semitic Poles had engraved the word ZYD (in Polish: \\"≈ªyd\\"). In 1937 Shmuel Zytomirski wrote in a letter to his young brother Yehuda, who had immigrated to Mandatory Palestine in that year: In accordance with his perception he registered his son to learn in Tarbut school, a Jewish and Zionist school in which the lessons were in the Hebrew language. Henio was not fortunate enough to enter the school gates. On 1 September 1939, the opening day of school, Nazi Germany invaded Poland and World War II began.  World War II period  = Lublin Ghetto = With the establishment of the Nazi regime in Poland, a Judenrat of twenty-four members was set up in Lublin. Zytomirski, a teacher by profession and Chairman of the Poale Zion movement in Lublin, was appointed by the Judenrat to be the manager of the post office at 2nd Kowalska Street. This role allowed him, apparently, to make contact with the Polish underground (which delivered him forbidden information and newsKorn, Nachman.

By order of the Nazi governor of Lublin district, all 34,149 Jews who lived then in the city were forced on 24 March 1941 to move to the ghetto that was established in Lublin. In March 1941, the Zytomirski family moved to 11th Kowalska Street in the Lublin Ghetto. Shmuel Zytomirski's father, Ephraim, died from typhus on 10 November 1941. Before his death he asked to be buried near the cemetery gates in order to be the first to witness the liberation of Lublin. The tombstone on his grave was smashed and destroyed in 1943 when the Nazis liquidated the new Jewish graveyard in Lublin. Zytomirski didn't surrender to the harsh conditions in Lublin Ghetto and was a source of encouragement to his friends. For example, in December 1941 the Nazi Security Police (in Germany: Sicherheitspolizei SiPo) ordered the Judenrat in Lublin to collect from Lublin Jews all the woolen clothes they had in their possession and give it to the Germans. The Judenrat called to one hundred people and sent them to collect woolen clothes. Professor Nachman Korn and Shmuel Zytomirski went from house to house to collect woolen clothes for the Wehrmacht soldiers who fought in the Russian front. Zytomirski had tried to reassure the people and told them:Korn, Nachman. 'The last days of Bella', In: Bella Mandelsberg- Schildktaut, On the history of Lublin Jewry. Tel Aviv, 1965, p 44. Being a person who had seen matters from a historical perspective, Zytomirski wrote a diary since the beginning of the Nazi occupation. In his diary he recorded everything he had seen and heard. He kept the diary like the apple of his eye. His hope was that the diary would get to trustful hands and would serve as evidence of Nazi atrocities. With the death of Shmuel Zytomirski also his diary was lost.Zuckerman, Meyer. 'The Movement for Working Eretz Yisrael'. In: \\"Encyclopedia of the Jewish Diaspora: A Memorial Library of Countries and Communities - Poland Series: Lublin Volume\\", Jerusalem, 1957, p412. His letters and those of his father which remained after their death are poor substitutes for the lost diary. Reading the letters leads the reader through the loss of the family and loss of the Lublin Jewish community. = Sending Lublin Jews to extermination in Belzec = On 16 March 1942, the transports in freight trains from Lublin District to extermination camps began as part of \\"Operation Reinhard\\". Every day about 1,400 people were sent to the camps. The German police and SS people supervised the transports. The Selection of the Jews took place in the square adjacent to the municipal slaughterhouse. The deportees were led on foot from the Great Synagogue (named after the Maharshal), which served as a gathering place for the deportees. Elderly and sick people were shot on the spot.Kuwalek, Robert (2003). The Ghetto in Lublin. \\"Voice of Lublin\\" Magazin no. 39 The rest were sent to the extermination camps, mainly to Belzec. Hundreds of Jews were shot dead in the woods on the outskirts of Lublin. A total of about 29,000 Lublin Jews were exterminated during March and April 1942. Apparently, among them were Shmuel Zytomirski's wife, mother and two of his sisters ‚Äì Esther and Rachel ‚Äì who were murdered then. = Majdan Tatarski Ghetto = On 14 April 1942 the transports ended. Zytomirski and his son Henio survived the selections of spring 1942, apparently thanks to a work permit (in German: J-Ausweiss) that Shmuel had. Along with the rest of the Jews who stayed alive in Lublin, they were transferred to another smaller ghetto that was established in Majdan Tatarski (a suburb of Lublin). Between 7,000 and 8,000 people entered this ghetto, although many of them did not have work permits. On 22 April, the SS held another selection: about 2,500 to 3,000 people without work permits were taken initially to Majdanek and from there to Krepiec (Krƒôpiec) forest which is about 15 km from Lublin. There they were shot to death. From the Majdan Tatarski ghetto Zytomirski sent (via the Red Cross organization) a message to his brother Yehuda in Mandatory Palestine: On 23 July 1942 Zytomirski sent a letter from the Majdan Tatarski ghetto to Nathan Schwalb in Geneva: These words of Zytomirski, \\"in my solitude I hang all my hopes in you\\", were used by the Holocaust researcher, Prof. Avraham Milgram, as the title of his article about sending the food packages from Portugal to Jews who were in territories under Nazi occupation. = End of Lublin Jews = On 9 November 1942, the final liquidation of the Jewish Ghetto in Majdan Tatarski occurred. About 3,000 people were sent to the extermination camp Majdanek, including Zytomirski and his son Henio. Old people and children were sent immediately to the gas chamber. Nine year old Henio Zytomirski was also in this group. Men and women who were capable to work were sent to forced labor camps in Lublin, such as Flugplatz camp (where the property of the murdered Jews was sorted and sent to Germany) and Sportplatz (where the forced labor prisoners built a sports stadium for the SS people). Apparently, Zytomirski was transferred to the Sportplatz camp. From the camp he managed to send two last letters to the Zionist delegation in Constantinople. On 3 November 1943, the massive extermination of all remaining Jewish captives and prisoners in Majdanek and the other camps in Lublin District took place. This liquidation is known as \\"Aktion Erntefest\\", which in German means \\"Harvest Festival\\". On that day at Majadanek 18,400 Jews were shot to death in specially dug open pits. That murderous \\"operation\\" was the largest single execution in the history of the Nazi death camps. At the end of this killing operation, Lublin District was declared Judenrein, i.e., \\"free of Jews\\".  Mystery of his death  Surprisingly, Shmuel Zytomirski survived also this mass extermination. This is known according to a letter he had sent by courier from Lublin to the Zionist delegation in Constantinople on 6 January 1944. It is not clear from where exactly this letter was sent. The address on the letter was \\"7 Drobna Street\\". In that letter Zytomirski stated preliminary information about the mass killing at Majdanek in November 1943. That was his last letter. Only half a year later, on 24 July 1944, the city of Lublin was liberated by the Soviet Red Army. Shmuel Zytomirski did not survive the Holocaust; the circumstances of his death remain unknown. It is not known where he was hiding in the last days of his life, and whether he was betrayed or got sick and died.

D. T. Davie, was an American 19th-century photographer known as a pioneer of the daguerreotype in America and an innovator of photographic equipment and techniques. He was a key player in the controversy over Levi Hill's claim to have invented a process for producing color daguerreotypes. Personal life Daniel DeWitt Tompkins Davie was born about 1820 in Otsego County, New York,1855 NYS Census record at Utica, Oneida County, New York. to Christina Scism/Sissem Davie and Samuel Davie. His childhood was spent in Bolivar, New York as his parents moved there 23 Mar 1823Davie Family Reunion and History - Bolivar Breeze, Sep. 2, 1915. and were among the earliest settlers in this area. Little is known of his life before his marriage in 1839 to Azubah Burdick. The couple had four daughters and a son named after his father. He died on 20 Feb 1877 in Alden, New York.Cuba Patriot, Cuba, Allegany County, New York, Friday, March 2, 1877. His remains were brought to Bolivar, New York for interment at Maple Lawn Cemetery next to his parents. Photography career Davie had wanted to be a painter but gave up the idea for financial reasons. Instead he learned the daguerreotype technique sometime after 1843, and in 1846, he opened his first photography studio, located in Utica, New York. Although Davie was almost entirely self-taught, his professional reputation developed rapidly, and in 1850 he traveled to Washington, DC, where he photographed nearly every member of both houses of Congress along with other public figures. His 1850 daguerreotype of Daniel Webster was considered in its day \\"one of the most striking likenesses\\" of that statesman. In 1851, Davie expanded from taking photographs to manufacturing the chemicals used in the daguerreotype process. An innovator in photographic technology, he is credited with such inventions and improvements as the plate vise, the buffing lathe, a camera stand, and refined rotten stone. His most elaborate invention may have been an award-winning device called the American Photographer that clipped, crimped, cleaned, and buffed photographic plates. Davie also learned and experimented with the techniques for making albumen prints and stereoscopic transparencies. In the 1850s, Davie opened a second daguerreotype studio in Syracuse, New York, this one in partnership with his brother Joseph. He also became the owner of a photographic gallery in Albany, New York. Around the same time, Davie took on a partner in Utica, Gordon Evans with whom he published the monthly periodical Scientific Daguerreian of which no known copies survive. Davie's assistant for three years in the mid 1850s was the photographer Julia Ann Rudolph, then at the very beginning of her long career. =Heliochromy controversy= Davie was elected first president of the Association of Daguerreotypists in 1851, and in that capacity he oversaw a team of three experts investigating the Reverend Levi Hill's claimed invention of a process called \\"heliochromy\\" that could supposedly produce color daguerreotypes. The team reported bluntly that Hill's purported discovery was \\"a delusion.\\" When a few years later Hill sought to publish his heliochromy formula, Davie obtained a court order banning the sale of Hill's book on the grounds that it libeled him and his committee, with the result that most of the edition was pulped. Recent researchers have found that Davie's team was not quite correct: although Hill appears to have faked some of the color in his images, it also appears that his process can indeed produce a muted color spectrum.

They came to an end in 1984. In those undertaken in the middle of the 20th century, remains dating to the 6th century BC were brought to light, including parts of the city walls and some ceramic objects of the Bronze Age Castelluccio culture, while the 1980s excavations revealed a defensive tower from the middle of the 6th century BC. These discoveries were of great significance, because they helped to clarify the course of the city wall discovered almost thirty years earlier. Objects discovered in the excavations include vases, objects for everyday use, plates and lamps, as well as a terracotta statue of a female divinity and the terracotta head, which demonstrate the existence of various spaces dedicated to religious cult.

Madeline Di Nonno joined as CEO of the Institute in 2009. The Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media is currently headquartered at Mount St. Mary's University, in Los Angeles, California.  History  The founder, Hollywood actress Geena Davis, in a speech at the Millennium Development Goals Countdown event in the Ford Foundation Building in New York, addressing gender roles and issues in film (24 September 2013) After watching children's TV with her young daughter, Geena Davis noticed that the large majority of these television shows and other media lacked a large number of female characters. After conducting research on this type of entertainment, Davis found that three times more men than women appear in children's television shows and films.The research also showed that characters in the workplace were 80.5% male and only 19.5% female.Marechal, AJ. ‚ÄúDavis Institute Tracks Gender Gaps in Media.‚Äù Salem State University , 23 Sept. 2011 Davis studied 122 \\"G, PG, and PG-13 films theatrically-released between 2006 and 2009.‚Äù https://seejane.org/wp-content/uploads/full-study-gender-disparity- in-family-films-v2.pdf Generally, she found that ‚Äúonly 29.2% of all speaking characters are female,‚Äù and these women are more sexualized than the men. As ‚Äúchildren are engaging with media up to 7-10 hours/day,‚Äù the representation of women in children's television shows and films has a major impact on how young girls believe they should act and how they view themselves. Davis subsequently founded the eponymous Institute in 2004.  Mission  Using her connections in the industry, Davis takes these statistics to media executives to educate them about the poor representation of women in media. Children's entertainment is a primary focus of the Institute. The Institute is the only research-based organization working within the media to exchange, educate, influence, and expound on the need for gender balance, and, it is a leading voice to create a wide variety of roles for females in the entertainment industry. The Institute is against stereotyping of female characters, and it furthers calls for roles that empower women rather than denigrate them.  Davis‚Äô thoughts about the Gender Gap  Davis states, ‚ÄúThe fact is women are seriously underrepresented in nearly all sectors of society across the globe, not just on screen, but, for the most part, we are simply not aware to this reality, and media images exert a powerful influence in perpetuating our unconscious bias‚Äù One of the reasons that impelled Davis to start her foundation was personal experience with Hollywood's sexist treatment of older women. Davis says, ‚ÄúFilm roles really did start to dry up when I got into my 40‚Äôs. If you look at IMDB, up until that age I made roughly one film a year. In my entire 40‚Äôs, I made one movie, Stuart Little.‚Äù  Research impact  The Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media has garnered several notable accomplishments concerning their research. As an Institute, they have cultivated one of the largest repositories of research around the intersection of gender and media for the past 25 years. The Institute has engaged in several large scale research projects concerning the current conditions for women in mass media. In addition, the Institute collaborates with several other non-profits and for- profit corporations in order to highlight their feelings on the need to reform the way that women are represented in popular culture. Contributors to the Institute include scientists, non-profit coordinators, business leaders, as well as those involved in producing and acting in media. In 2010, the Institute, along with the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences Foundation, established a $5000 award for diversity in children's animation created by college students.  Current partnerships  The Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media has teamed-up with several multi-national corporations to achieve their goal of informing media consumers about the current state of women in popular culture. Recently, the Institute has partnered with Ford and several YouTube stars to create a video series entitled #ShesGotDrive. The partnership between Ford and the Institute seeks to highlight several stories of women content creators overcoming significant challenges. Thus far, the campaign has featured Taryn Southern, Yulin Kang, and Clara C. The purpose of this campaign is to highlight the power of women in media and inspire other women to follow their dreams. In addition, the campaign seeks ‚Äúto fight unconscious gender bias in media.‚Äù The Institute has also teamed up with the Girl Scouts of the United States of America (GSUSA) to create a program entitled Girls‚Äô Fast Track Races. With this program, girls construct their own race cars. The program was created in order to foster learning of automobile engineering in young women. Previously, in 2016, the Institute received a 1.2 million dollar grant from Google. Using this grant, the Institute developed the Geena Davis Inclusion Quotient (or GD-IQ). The GD-IQ is an algorithm that can quickly scan a feature-length film to detect gender differences in representation. The Institute believes that the GD-IQ will significantly improve the Institute's research of on-screen gender disparities. In addition to its partnerships with several for-profit corporations, the Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media has also partnered with a number of non-profit organizations in order to further the institute's goal of generating equal representation for women in media. The institute has partnered with the United Nations; and founder Geena Davis is a chair on the California Commission on the Status of Women.  Significant studies  The Institute has completed several large studies around the representation of gender in media. One larger study was conducted over gender roles in popular culture, including topics such as the disparity between speaking roles for men and women; and what type of roles men and women were shown as portraying on screen. The Institute conducted this research by analyzing several blockbuster films from 2008 and concluded that gender roles are stereotyped in popular culture. A second larger study was conducted over the impact that gender plays in both on screen media as well as behind the scenes of media production. The Geena Davis Institute investigated and discovered that in the film industry, only 8% of directors are women, coupled with 19% of producers and 13.6% of writers. Several other studies conducted by the institute concern additional issues regarding gender and media including gender disparity in media across several countries as well as the portrayal of gender in films specifically marketed to young girls and families. Each year, the institute studies female representation in entertainment and publishes their findings. Through this study, the institute hopes that bringing the facts about media representation to the public's attention will bring positive change for female representation in the media. In 2015, the institute studied the top 100 grossing films of 2014 and 2015 and found that, overall, women spoke less than men and received less screen time in films. However, the study also found that ‚Äúwomen had a particularly strong presence in the comedy and action genres,‚Äù and cites women like Tina Fey and Melissa McCarthy as a couple of the year's leading ladies. Yet even with female leads like Fey and McCarthy, out of the 100 films, only ‚Äú11% featured a female lead.‚Äù Even though films featuring a female lead made up less than a quarter of the top 100 grossing films, ‚Äúfilms led by women grossed 15.8% more on average than films led by men.‚Äù In 2016, the organization found that there were increasingly more female leads in movies than ever before. A separate study exemplifies the influence of female leads: after the release of films like The Hunger Games and Brave, both of which feature female archers as leads, the number of young girls participating in archery greatly increased.https://seejane.org/wp-content/uploads/hitting-the- bullseye-reel-girl-archers-inspire-real-girl-archers-short.pdf According to Davis, ‚Äú68% of the film companies they‚Äôve worked with have changed two or more of their projects‚Äù to include more female representation. In partnership with the Lyda Hill Foundation, the institute released a 2018 study of the media representation of female characters in the science, technology, engineering and math career fields. The study showed that men depicted 62.3% of all STEM characters, while women accounted for 37.1%.(\\"Portray Her:\\". See Jane. Retrieved 2019-02-28.) In a survey of girls and young women, the majority of participants acknowledged the impact of female STEM characters in the media.(Marotti, Ally. \\"Men outnumber women nearly 2-to-1 in STEM roles on TV and in movies.

Bentonville Film Festival  In addition to many of their research contributions, the Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media also created the Bentonville Film Festival. Davis founded the Bentonville Film Festival with Trevor Drinkwater. Films that are in the Bentonville film festival are guaranteed distribution, a move that Davis says will fix the disproportionate number of women creators in Hollywood. The yearly festival is held in Bentonville, Arkansas. Nearly 100 films are showcased at the growing festival. The festival also has concerts with various artists each year. In 2018 country singers Carly Pearce and Lauren Alaina performed as well as Jillian Jacqueline, Vintage Troube and Fifth Harmony's Ally Brooke.https://5newsonline.com/2018/05/01/bentonville-film-festival-kicks-off- drawing-celebrities-to-northwest-arkansas/  See also  * Exploitation of women in mass media * Misogyny and mass media * Media and gender * Gender equality * Feminism and media  References   External links  * * Bentonville Film Festival website Category:2004 establishments in California Category:Think tanks established in 2004 Category:Non-profit organizations based in Los Angeles Category:Feminist art organizations in the United States ","title":"Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media"},{"id":"50526456","text":"The Firebird Z-One is a German single-place, paraglider that was designed and produced by Firebird Sky Sports AG of F√ºssen in the mid-2000s.

King Charles's French troops failed to enter Paris, defended by the governor Jean de Villiers de L'Isle-Adam and the provost Simon Morhier, with the support of much of the city's population. Background  After Henry V of England entered Paris in 1420, the English administration was sympathetic to the citizens of Paris, confirming their former privileges and giving even new ones. The Parisians had accepted the English mostly by hatred of Charles VII (whom they had nicknamed \\"King of Bourges\\") and the Armagnac party, who threatened the many liberties that the city had obtained over the centuries. After the battle of Mont√©pilloy on 26 August 1429, Joan of Arc and Duke John II of Alen√ßon, took Saint-Denis, a town north of Paris. On August 28, Charles VII signed the truce of Compi√®gne which excepted from the armistice Saint-Denis (which was already taken), St. Cloud, Vincennes, Charenton and Paris. The battle  The Porte Saint-Honor√© a century later, in 1530 (Braun and Hogenberg plan). In early September, Charles VII established his camp at the butte de Saint-Roch. On September 3, Joan of Arc accompanied by the Dukes of Alen√ßon and Bourbon, the counts of Vend√¥me and Laval, Marshals Gilles de Rais and La Hire and their troops, lodged in the village of La Chapelle. After several days of performing recognitions and skirmishes on various gates of Paris, Joan of Arc prayed in St. Genevieve chapel. On the morning of Thursday, 8 September 1429, Joan of Arc, the Duke of Alen√ßon, Marshals Gilles de Rais and Jean de Brosse Boussac began their march from the Village of La Chapelle to storm the Porte Saint-Honor√©. Joan of Arc installed culverins on the butte de Saint-Roch to support the attack. Joan of Arc at siege of Paris The Parisians, believing that the Armagnacs wanted to destroy the city from top to bottom, made a vigorous defence. Joan of Arc was given the task of leading the assault to capture the city by Charles VII. Joan of Arc charged towards the main gate with the French army and tried to cross the city's water-filled moat in front of the gate. The French failed to capture any section of the gatehouse and its surrounding walls and suffered extremely heavy casualties. Joan of Arc was wounded by a crossbow bolt in the thigh. Joan was then dragged away from the battlefield and was brought back to her house in La Chapelle. Although she wished to resume the attack on Paris, King Charles VII ordered her to withdraw to the Abbey of Saint-Denis. After four hours of assaulting the walls of Paris, Charles VII sounded the retreat as no progress had been made.In the end, ultimately the English won, and successfully defended Paris. Consequences The city was defended by about 3,000 English commanded by marshal Simon Morhier and governor Jean de Villiers de L'Isle-Adam, which forced Charles VII and his army of 10,000 soldiers to retreat. Having failed by force, Charles VII, tried to take the city otherwise. In 1430, he staged a plot that was discovered by the English, and lead to the hanging of 6 Parisians on the scaffold. In 1432 and 1434, further attempts were made to open the gates of Paris to the forces of Charles VII, but were prevented by Parisians. After the Duke of Burgundy had withdrawn his support for the English as a result of the Treaty of Arras (1435), on 13 April 1436 the Parisians opened the city gates to the bastard of Orl√©ans and constable Richemont.

Background Man Haron Monis was alleged to have sent letters (and in one case, a recording on a CD) to parents, spouses and other relatives of Australian soldiers killed while on active service in Afghanistan (and in one case, to the mother of an Austrade official killed in a bombing in Indonesia). The letters contained expressions of sympathy to the relatives of the deceased, but also contained criticisms of the deceased: assertions that they were murderers of innocent civilians, comparisons of the body of one deceased soldier to the ‚Äúdirty body of a pig‚Äù, and comparisons to Adolf Hitler. Copies of the letters were also sent to Australian politicians. Section 471.12 of the Code makes it an offence for a person to use a postal or similar service \\"in a way ... that reasonable persons would regard as being, in all the circumstances... offensive\\". Monis was charged with 12 counts under s 471.12 of the Commonwealth Criminal Code. In addition, Amirah Droudis was charged with eight counts of aiding and abetting Monis in the commission of those offences. Mr Monis and Ms Droudis claimed that s 417.12 violated the implied constitutional freedom of political communication. The New South Wales Court of Appeal rejected this argument and found the section was valid. The case was appealed to the High Court. The decision On appeal, the High Court divided evenly on the question (3‚Äì3). As a result, the decision of the Court of Appeal was affirmed. Decision in case of difference of opinion. The Court was not obliged to determine whether the communications in the present case were \\"offensive\\" for the purposes of s 417.12. The sole question before the Court was whether s 417.12 infringed the implied freedom and was so invalid. The Court reiterated that the implied freedom of political communication does not operate as an individual right; rather, it is an implied restriction on the legislative competence of Australian parliaments and executives. In determining whether s 417.12 infringed the implied freedom, the Court applied the test expounded in Lange v Australian Broadcasting Corporation,. as modified in Coleman v Power.. There are two limbs to that test:At [61] per French CJ, at [93] per Hayne J, at [274] per Crennan, Kiefel & Bell JJ. #Does the law effectively burden freedom of communication about government or political matters? #If so: All members of the Court construed the word \\"offensive\\" in s 417.12 narrowly. They found the true operation of the provision is only to make illegal use of postal services that are \\"very\\", \\"seriously\\" or \\"significantly\\" offensive,At [336] per Crennan, Kiefel and Bell JJ or that are \\"calculated or likely to arouse significant anger, significant outrage, disgust or hatred in the mind of a reasonable person in all the circumstances.\\"At [57]-[59] per French CJ (Heydon J agreeing); at[90] per Hayne J. There were a number of reasons for adopting this interpretation including: the provision is a criminal provision, and carries a significant penalty; the provision restricts a common law freedom; the prohibition on ‚Äúoffensive‚Äù uses of postal services sits together with prohibitions on ‚Äúmenacing‚Äù and ‚Äúharassing‚Äù uses, suggesting the provision intends to target more serious conduct; and legislation should be interpreted, if possible, so as to avoid constitutional invalidity. Despite this narrow construction, all members of the Court found that s 417.12 does effectively burden freedom of communication about government or political matters. That is because even construed narrowly, the provision would criminalise some political communications. The first limb of the Lange test was therefore satisfied. Crennan, Kiefel, and Bell JJ held that the purpose of the law was to protect people from ‚Äúintrusive‚Äù, seriously offensive communications. The nature of postal communications is that they are delivered into people‚Äôs private homes and workplaces. Seriously offensive communications are likely to be unsolicited.At [320]. They held that this purpose is compatible with the maintenance of the constitutionally prescribed system of government. Further, the law is reasonably and appropriately adapted to achieving that legitimate purpose. The freedom of political communication is not absolute. Section 417.12 is not directed at political communications ‚Äì it only incidentally affects them. It is unlikely to impose an extensive burden them.At [340]-[353] The law is therefore valid. In contrast, French CJ (with whom Heydon J agreed) and Hayne J held that the purpose of s 417.12 is simply to prevent the use of postal services in an offensive way.At [73] per French CJ, at [178] per Hayne J For slightly different reasons, they held that this is not a legitimate purpose with respect to the Lange test. Notably, they both appeared to consider that the restrictions imposed on political communications were greater than did Crennan, Kiefel, and Bell JJ. Both French CJ and Hayne J attached a greater degree of importance to the role that offensive communications play in political discourse.At [67] per French CJ, at [220] per Hayne J French CJ, Hayne, and Heydon JJ also held that s 417.12 is invalid as it should not be read down to avoid infringement of the implied freedom.At [75]-[76] per French CJ, at [232] per Hayne J, at [236] per Heydon J See also * Rowan v.

Little is left of the medieval abbey buildings. Some buildings of the eighteenth century survive (enriched with older fragments, such as the arms of the abbot Jean Marius (1575-1597) and of the Duchy of Bar), notably the dovecote of the abbey, which was built in 1747 in the Baroque style and remodeled in 1774 with Rococo elements; it is registered in the Base M√©rim√©e of notable French architectural monuments.  History  The abbey was founded in 1090 by Lubricus, a Canon of the St. Stephen's Cathedral in Metz. Reginald I, Count of Bar became the Vogt of the abbey in 1102. In 1186, Saint- Pierremont briefly served as a refuge for the exiled Archbishop of Trier, Folmar of Karden, formerly a member of the congregation.Geschichte der deutschen Kaiserzeit, Vol. VI, p. 142. In the course of the Counter- Reformation, the community was reformed by St. Pierre Fourier, who incorporated it into the Congregation of Our Savior. Subsequent to the invasion and subsequent annexation of the Duchy of Lorraine under Cardinal Richelieu in 1632, the saint and his fellow canons refused to take an oath of loyalty to King Louis XIII of France; as a result, the abbey was pillaged and razed in 1636, though partially restored later in that century and the subsequent one. Being situated in the Three Bishoprics, the abbey became part of France with the settlement of the Treaty of Westphalia in 1648. Though the congregation lost its formal independence in 1733, being made directly subordinate to the cathedral chapter of Metz, the community itself survived until the French Revolution.

Sonia Saraiya, writing in Variety, felt that despite an engaging lead performance the series failed to live up to its \\"fun\\" potential, and raised strident objections to its style of violence: \\"the studied shallowness of Time After Time‚Äôs approach to violence makes for a sickening dynamic that attempts to cheaply humanize a serial killer.

He has released several albums, many featuring covers of popular songs. His 2012 album, Till We Meet Again is a collection of mostly original material. In 1994, and along with fellow broadcaster Stuart Linnell and the Coventry Telegraph, Brolly founded the Snowball charity to raise funds for good causes. This was followed in 1998 by the first Bob Brolly and Friends annual fundraising campaign. Brolly hosted his first charity fundraising ball in 1999, in aid of the Omagh Victim Support Fund and Leukemia Research, and featuring Irish artists and personalities such as Brendan Shine, Foster and Allen, Barry McGuigan and Majella O'Donnell. Brolly was awarded the MBE in the 2003 New Year Honours for his services to charity and broadcasting. He is also a past winner of the Irish World Radio Presenter of the Year Award, and the Irish Post Media Person of the Year Award. In November 2005 Brolly was rushed to hospital after suffering a heart attack. At the time he described the experience as like being \\"hit in the chest with a baseball bat\\". He subsequently gave his backing to the Derek Higgs Start a Heart Appeal, an appeal named in honour of former Coventry City F.C. director Derek Higgs (who died from a heart attack in 2008), and which sought to raise funds for fifty defibrillators that would be placed at locations around Coventry. He is also a patron for the Z√∂e's Place Baby Hospice in Coventry.

Eighteen commercial buildings are of brick construction. Of those, eight are two-story structures, and ten are single-story structures. The remaining three buildings are wood frame commercial buildings. The single historic structure is the stone lock in the city park, which is also individually listed on the National Register. In addition to the industrial buildings, the commercial buildings historically housed stores, a bank, an opera house, and a fraternal society. Bonaparte's commercial area was built on the riverfront to take advantage of the riverboats that were important for commerce when the town was founded in the 1830s. As the railroad came through the focus of river town commerce moved away from the river and focused on the rail station. Because of the Meek's facilities, Bonaparte continued to focus on the river until the mills closed in 1909. The period of significance is 1852 to 1909, and most of the non-contributing buildings and the structures were built after 1909.

Its mission is to sustain America‚Äôs forests for their public benefits of wood, water, wildlife, and people‚Äôs wellbeing, in cooperation with landowners and communities. History Pacific Forest Trust was founded in 1993 by Laurie Wayburn and Constance Best to provide incentives and support to encourage and enable forest landowners to conserve their properties. Laurie Wayburn, an environmentalist and Harvard Alumna, is the daughter of noted environmentalist Edgar Wayburn. Constance Best is a conservationist and entrepreneur. Approach Pacific Forest Trust‚Äôs strategy is to make conservation an economically competitive use of forests and other associated lands. They partner with private landowners to permanently conserve their forests, prioritizing long-term forest health and productivity that benefit the public, with 82,484 acres currently under conservation easement. They promote forest conservation because it helps mitigate climate change, protects water resources, serves as habitat for wildlife, and offers recreational opportunities for those who enjoy the outdoors. Pacific Forest Trust promotes practical implementation of stewardship forestry‚Äîforestry, which encourages natural, native forest composition, age distributions, processes, and structures‚Äîon private forestlands. They do this through providing research results, technical and management planning assistance, demonstration, advice and education for landowners, resource managers, and governmental agency personnel. Pacific Forest Trust‚Äôs Van Eck Forest Project is an example of this type of forestry. This project was also the first emissions reduction project registered and independently verified in California. Policy and advocacy Pacific Forest Trust develops policy initiatives and analyses to generate new incentives for‚Äîor remove barriers to‚Äîlong-term forest stewardship, promoting initiatives and regulations that support landowners' investments in the restoration and conservation of their land. They pioneered the conception and implementation of the Working Forest Conservation Easement, which is a conservation easement \\"specifically designed to protect working forests in which the harvesting of timber and other forest products is sustained in perpetuity along with related conservation values‚Äù such as wildlife habitat, water sources, and climate-mitigating stores of carbon. Pacific Forest Trust also led the process of including legitimate and verifiable standards for forest carbon into the Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 and participated in the development of the Forest Project Protocol. By doing so they created the basis for the ongoing market in forestry-based Carbon Credits that has been facilitating the reduction of net emissions of CO2 since it was enacted. In addition, Pacific Forest Trust developed a streamlined approach to obtaining Safe Harbor Agreements, that ensure landowners are rewarded‚Äîrather than penalized‚Äîfor maximizing conservation of habitat for animals that are in danger of extinction. In 2004, Pacific Forest Trust also spearheaded an attempt to add nearly 1,600 acres to the Yosemite National Park by purchasing 793 acres of the land and then offering it to the National Park for inclusion.l The local Congressman Tom McClintock halted the attempt.  Awards and accolades  * Pacific Forest Trust was awarded the California Climate Action Reserve's \\"Climate Action Champion\\" Award in 2012. * In 2010 and 2016, Pacific Forest Trust achieved ‚Äúaccredited‚Äù status and renewed their accreditation respectively through the Land Trust Accreditation Commission, an independent program of the Land Trust Alliance. * In 2009, Pacific Forest Trust was awarded the U.S. EPA International Climate Protection Award, the EPA's highest honor in climate protection. * In 2008, Laurie Wayburn, Co- Founder and President of Pacific Forest Trust, was awarded the Kingsbury Browne Conservation Leadership Award and Fellowship by the Land Trust Alliance and the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy. Wayburn also earned the Leadership Award from the James Irvine Foundation in 2008.  Questions and criticism  Some environmental groups opposed the rules that authorized the production of Carbon Credits from forestland, including the Sierra Club, the Center for Biological Diversity and two dozen others.

Its title came from the name of a person of the same name who offered a drum break for the title track that was not included in the final mix. Containing a 1980s-style atmosphere and noted by one reviewer to be the duo's cleanest sounding release so far, the extended play was influenced by Russian disco records Frankel found on eBay. DFA released the title track as a single in February 2016 to promote the EP's release. The EP went on to receive positive reviews from music critics. Production and composition Crime Cutz has been described by Lily Moayeri of Under the Radar as an EP that strongly showcases the nu-disco side of the duo. The music of the EP was influenced by records by Russian jazz musicians that were released in the 1970s and 1980s but were never distributed in the duo's home country; these musicians attempted to copy the disco style of American and French acts such as Chic. Frankel, who was sent mp3 files of these tracks by a Russian record dealer on eBay, said that their failure to mimic the style of the popular songs they wanted to recreate due to their different synthesizer sounds is what made the songs unique: \\"I guess that's kind of what Nick and I do ... We find a sound we like, try to make it and fail, but in the process we make something new.\\" The rhythm of each track was developed first before writing the melodies and lyrics, given that the main goal of the EP was for it to be \\"instantly rhythmically gratifying\\", as member Nick Millhiser described. In addition to its disco element, Crime Cutz features exaggerated arrangements and childlike R&B; vocals that gives it a 1980s-esque atmosphere. Consequence of Sounds David Sackllah noted Crime Cutz to be Holy Ghost!'s cleanest-sounding release to date. As for the lyrical content, Frankel wanted the songs' seductive lyrics to be \\"phonetically fun\\" as with most other disco records. Tracks The starting title track of Crime Cutz derived its title from a person of the same name who gave Holy Ghost! a drum break to be used in the song; it was not included in the final mix, however. It begins with \\"spacey\\" synthesizers, before the acoustic drum beat kicks in around a minute into the song. Halfway into the song, diva vocals from the East Coast Inspirational Singers group join in, which Frankel, \\"literally found them on the internet. We met up the next day, and it was awesome and really moving to hear them sing. In general we've tried to be a bit more off the cuff when recording recently, [and they were] a last minute addition while mixing the song.\\" Sequenced synth arpeggios, \\"super-dry\\" guitars, and falsetto lead vocals are also present in the arrangement. \\"Stereotype\\" is about the band's self-awareness and pride towards them being of a very well-known musical genre, singing in a mournful tone that \\"I know I'm a stereotype, don't be so critical [‚Ä¶] Let go.\\" In the track's first draft, the drum parts and chord progression were developed first. Holy Ghost! traveled to Los Angeles to work with DJ and production duo Oliver on the song, but with little success in making the type of track Holy Ghost! wanted it to be. It was not until Oliver created a bassline for the duo that Holy Ghost! reworked the arrangement of the song into what would be the final mix that ended up on Crime Cutz. The title of \\"Compass Point\\", a song Frankel wrote in 45 minutes, is a reference to Chris Blackwell's Compass Point Studios, where numerous popular musicians in the style mixture of funk, reggae and synthpop, that Crime Cutz pays a tribute to, recorded their music. Its working title was \\"Back to Earth\\", and was the first song to be written for but was not included on their second studio album Dynamics. As Millhiser explains, \\"There was always some indescribable thing about it that irked us, so we went back to that song with the intention of being like, 'Oh, you know, it‚Äôs just a matter of re-recording the vocals or the piano, and it‚Äôll be done.' That of course was not the case, and we ended basically just keeping the drums and one line from the song, making a totally different song out of it, essentially remixing ourselves.\\" Frankel called the EP's closer, \\"Footsteps\\", to be the least rhythmic of all the tracks. Its original title was \\"Your Favorite Band/Footsteps\\". As Frankel described coming up with the name, \\"I was going the other night to see our friends in Hot Chip. When I was there, I overheard some people saying, 'I thought they were playing, but they‚Äôre DJing,' and that‚Äôs something that happens all the time now. People go to see their favorite band, and it turns out it‚Äôs a DJ set. I thought it was kind of funny, and also kind of sad ‚Äî but in a funny way.\\" While the version of Crime Cutz that was officially released only consists of four tracks, Holy Ghost! said in their January 2016 announcement of the EP that a fifth track might be included; \\"We‚Äôre still messing around, because we have a lot of demos from this last year and a half, and we‚Äôre sifting through, figuring out if there‚Äôs one more we want to finish.\\" Release and promotion Holy Ghost! first announced in a January 7, 2016, interview with The Boston Globe that an extended play titled Crime Cutz was to be released in late spring of that year. The title track of Crime Cutz first premiered worldwide on Zane Lowe's Apple Music show Beats 1 on February 4, 2016. The label DFA Records released it as a digital download single a day later. As part of the PopMatters feature Singles Going Steady, multiple writers reviewed the track upon its release. The 12-inch vinyl single for the song that also includes the instrumental version of the song was a 300-copy limited edition. An official Ben Fries- directed video for the song depicted multicolored lights flashing to the beat, with Aubrey Cook starring as the dancer. On April 22, 2016, DFA released a \\"Crime Cutz\\" remix EP featuring two re-cuts of the song, one by Alan Palomo's project Neon Indian and another by producer Eli Escobar. DFA released the Crime Cutz EP on April 29. Critical reception Reviews of Crime Cutz were generally positive, holding an aggregate 67 out of 100 on the website Metacritic based on four critics. Lily Moayeri wrote in her review that \\"Holy Ghost! has sculpted its production for a sharply defined quadruple hit.\\" Austin Reed, writing for Pretty Much Amazing, praised the band for returning to a little-to-no effort approach that was used in making their self-titled debut album: \\"Dynamics fell short because neither Frankel nor bandmate Nick Millhiser seemed 100% convinced that what they were doing made any sense. But on tracks like \\"Crime Cutz\\", and EP highlight \\"Compassion Points\\", that confidence sounds fully restored and more galvanized than ever\\". Cameron Cook of Pitchfork honored Crime Cutz as \\"a bright, tight, tense mini-epic, solidifying [Holy Ghost!] as one of the pillars of the mid-'00s disco resurgence.\\" His only major criticism of the EP was its lack of stylistic variety: \\"you spend a lot of the record hoping for something to take them even further over the edge, but they continue to pull back until the very end.\\" The group's lack of musical risk on the EP was also criticized in a more mixed review by Sackllah, spotlighting \\"Compass Point\\" as the set's only memorable track: \\"At best, Crime Cutz is a decent release by a talented group that clearly has potential to make some great retro records. At its lowest points, it‚Äôs filled with clumsy lyrics and meandering tracks that never really go anywhere.\\" Track listing References Category:2016 EPs Category:Holy Ghost! albums ","title":"Crime Cutz"},{"id":"50526678","text":"Hung Hau-hsuan (, ), better known by his in-game name Karsa, is a Taiwanese professional League of Legends player who is the jungler for Top Esports of China's LPL.

There are three generations of songwriters represented on the recording - from musical theater masters like George Gershwin, Burton Lane to pop icons of more recent years like Paul Simon and Peter Allen and a new generation of writers. Campbell's dad Jimmy Barnes suggested the song \\"It Will Always Be You\\", written by (Don Walker. In an interview with The New York Times, Campbell said; \\"This recording has been a great experience for me because I've had to trust myself and trust what I was hearing in my head - without being ignorant of the people around me and their advice, The buck stopped with me everywhere\\" adding \\"Every song has to mean something to me or there's no use singing it\\". Review The New York Times said \\"the emotional center of the recording is \\"Yard Sale\\", a quiet story song, written by Tom Anderson, about a young man getting rid of his possessions before facing life's final battle. Campbell follows it on the CD with \\"Bridge Over Troubled Water\\" which emotionally supports the song that proceeds it. The spirituality and uplifting nature of the Paul Simon classic comes through in a way that is new and surprising, even for those who have listened to the song for years.\\" Track listing ;Taking the Wheel CD/Cassette (537936-2) # \\"Grateful\\" (John Bucchino) - 4:38 # \\"Gentle Souls And Tender Hearted Fools\\" (John Bucchino) - 3:27 # \\"It Will Always Be You\\" (Don Walker) - 3:58 # \\"I Honestly Love You\\" (Jeff Barry, Peter Allen) - 3:17 # \\"Old Devil Moon\\" (Burton Lane, Yip Harburg) - 3:12 # \\"The Nearness Of You\\" / \\"Not A Day Goes By\\" (Hoagy Carmichael, Ned Washington, Stephen Sondheim) - 5:06 # \\"I Got Rhythm\\" (George Gershwin & Ira Gershwin) - 2:38 # \\"Never Really Mine To Lose\\" (Ann Hampton Callaway, Lindy Robbins) - 4:03 # \\"Storybook\\" (Frank Wildhorn, Nan Knighton) - 3:10 # \\"Yard Sale\\" (Tom Andersen) - 5:43 # \\"Bridge Over Troubled Water\\" (Paul Simon) - 4:09 # \\"Taking The Wheel\\" (John Bucchino) - 3:54 # \\"Just Where They Should Be\\" (Craig Carnelia) - 4:45 # \\"It Will Always Be You\\" (Acoustic Version) 4:43 Credits * Backing Vocals ‚Äì David Campbell, Maggie McKinnie, Mark Punch, Mark Williams, Toni Mott * Bass ‚Äì Graham Thompson, Leon Gaer * Cello ‚Äì Adrian Wallis, Peter Morrison * Drums ‚Äì Andrew Gander, Doug Gallacher, Frank Celenza, Kere Buchanan * Guitar ‚Äì Mark Punch, Rex Goh * Keyboards ‚Äì Jamie Rigg, Mike Gubb * Percussion ‚Äì David Armstrong * Piano ‚Äì Christopher Denny, Don Walker * Saxophone ‚Äì Craig Walters, Martin Hill, Terry Benn, Trevor Griffin * Trombone ‚Äì Herb Cannon * Trumpet ‚Äì Paul Panici*, Paul Thorne * Viola ‚Äì Anne-Louise Comerford, Virginia Comerford * Violin ‚Äì Aram Zarasyan, Fiona Ziegler, Jennifer Johnson, John Pokorny, Martin Lass, Michael Wittgens, Phillip Hartl, Rebecca Daniel External links * \\"Taking the Wheel\\" by David Campbell at Discogs References Category:1997 albums Category:Covers albums Category:Polydor Records albums Category:David Campbell (Australian musician) albums ","title":"Taking the Wheel"},{"id":"50526812","text":"Lure of the West is a 1926 American silent western film starring Eileen Sedgwick.

The team is named after the Florida Gators, the mascot of the University of Florida.

Unit history and background  Gator guard performing at Mardi Gras parades, 2016. The Gator Guard Drill Team was founded in 1953 at the University of Florida. The drill team was formed by cadets from the University of Florida ROTC program. The Gator Guard performs annually at the University of Florida's Homecoming Parade, as well as the Krewe of Mid-City and King Rex parades at the New Orleans Mardi Gras.http://www.gainesville.com/news/20160205/gator-drill-team-ready-to-head- to-tigers- denhttps://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1356&dat;=19651128&id;=Xc1NAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=tg4EAAAAIBAJ&pg;=2104,3600336&hl;=en The Drill Team uses M1903 rifles with 8-inch bayonets for all performances.https://thepatriotpress.wordpress.com/2015/02/ In addition, the Gator Guard also performs Color Guard ceremonies for the University of Florida, the SEC, and the MLB. The Gator Guard was modeled after the 3rd United States Infantry Regiment, \\"The Old Guard.\\" The team makes an annual trip to Washington D.C. to train with The Old Guard. The Gator Guard absorbed and succeeded the University of Florida's Army ROTC chapter of the Pershing Rifles upon its inception. The founding class of the Gator Guard consisted of 16 cadets in 1953. The team's membership would see an all-time high of 72 members in 1957. In many universities across the United States, ROTC participation was compulsory. This policy would be revoked in the 1960s, following opposition to U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War, in favor of voluntary programs.http://www.fsm-a.org/stacks/AP_files/APCompulsROTC.html This move from compulsory to voluntary participation in the UF ROTC program would cause a substantial decrease in enrollment of members, both in the ROTC program and in the Gator Guard Drill Team. This is largely why the team's enrollment peaked in 1957. From 1963 to 1972 the Gator Guard would hold an unprecedented nine year winning streak as the \\"Best Drill Unit\\" in the All- Florida Invitational Drill Meet, held in Sarasota, Fl. On August 18, 1976, an alumnus of the Gator Guard, Mark T. Barrett, assigned to United States Forces Korea would tragically be at the center of the Axe Murder Incident. Assigned to the Joint Security Area of the Demilitarized Zone, LT. Barrett would be part of a detail sent to cut down a poplar tree that had been blocking the view of the United Nations observers. While in the process of cutting down the tree, the detail was assaulted by North Koreans and LT. Mark Barrett was killed. The incident would be recognized internationally, and had the potential to spark an escalation of conflict on the Korean peninsula. A memorial for LT Barrett currently stands in front of Van Fleet Hall (Gainesville, Florida). The Gator Guard performs an annual changing of the Guard ceremony over the course of 24 hours over Mark T. Barrett's memorial, in similar fashion to 3rd U.S. Infantry Regiment (The Old Guard) Tomb of the Unknown Soldier changing of the guard. In the 1970s, women would gain opportunities for entrance into ROTC programs, as the Army opened up positions in Field Artillery and the Ordinance Corps to female officers.http://sill- www.army.mil/FAMAG/1978/JUL_AUG_1978/JUL_AUG_1978_PAGES_40_43.pdf Women coming into the Army through ROTC dovetailed with the elimination of the Women's Army Corps. The Gator Guard, having been an exclusively male team, would also see the entrance of female members in the coveted position of drillers, who would march and execute precision drill movements in parade as part of the team. The first female cadet to march with the drill team was during the 1973-1974 school year was Carmen Parrot. She was allowed to carry the Guidon during parades. The first female commander of the drill team would be Nancy A. Oxer in 1979. The first female GGDT member to be commissioned was Bonnie Chandler. Between 2010 and 2015, the Gator Guard helped to create and train teams at other Florida universities modeled after the Gator Guard Drill Team. By 2015, the Gator Guard had successfully set up the 'Osprey Guard' at the University of North Florida, and the 'Seminole Guard' at Florida State University. In 2016, the team consisted of 31 active male and female members.

He was one of the Song dynasty grand councilors between 973 and 982. Emperor Zhenzong's Consort Shen was his granddaughter. During the Five Dynasties Early in his career, Shen Yilun studied the \\"Three Rites\\" (Rites of Zhou, Book of Rites, and Etiquette and Ceremonial) and taught these classics between Luoyang and S≈çng Prefecture to support himself. During Later Han, he joined the staff of Bai Wenke (), the prefect of Sh«én Prefecture. In 954 during the Later Zhou, Shen Yilun was referred by a friend and became a retainer to general Zhao Kuangyin, then a military governor administering Hua Prefecture, X«î Prefecture, and S√≤ng Prefecture. Shen was able to manage the finances of all 3 prefectures, and had an incorruptible reputation. During the Song dynasty In February 960, Zhao Kuangyin usurped the Later Zhou throne and founded the Song dynasty. At that time, Shen Yilun was a mere surveillance circuit judge stationed in S√≤ng Prefecture, but now that his former boss had become the emperor, he was summoned to the capital (and his hometown) Kaifeng and made director of the Census Bureau. In early 962, returning from a diplomatic trip to Song's tributary state Wuyue, Shen offered more than 10 recommendations to the new emperor, all of which were accepted. One of recommendations was loaning out grain from military granaries to relieve the mass starvation Shen witnessed in Si and Yang Prefectures. Shen argued that peasants would repay the loan come harvest time in the autumn. However, another minister soon objected: :\\"If starvation continues, where would the repayment come from? And who would be accountable for that?\\" To which Shen responded: :\\"A nation should govern humanely. This will automatically ensure peace, prosperity and a ripe harvest.\\" Zhao Kuangyin was pleased with the reply and ordered government officials in Huainan Circuit to dispense grain to starved people. In 962, Shen was made a supervising secretary. The following spring he was made fiscal commissioner of Shaanxi Circuit. When the Song dynasty invaded the Later Shu in 964, Shen was in charge of the military finances.

She established the museum which is now called Wheelwright Museum of the American Indian, in 1937 along with Hosteen Klah.  Early life and family  Wheelwright was born on October 22, 1878, the only child of Andrew Cunningham Wheelwright and Sarah (\\"Sadie\\") Perkins Cabot Wheelwright. She was raised in a wealthy household and the Cabot family was part of the Boston upper class. Her family traced its ancestry to 18th- century merchants who had become wealthy through shipping. Her great- grandfathers worked as commission agents and her maternal grandfather made his wealth through \\"slavery, sugar, and rum,\\" also building China's first trading outpost, where he imported silks and opium. Mary's mother, Sarah, was close friends with Ralph Waldo Emerson, who often visited the family's home. As a child, Wheelwright was raised in the tradition of the Transcendentalists and the Unitarian Church. In 1882, at the age of four years old, she posed for a portrait by artist Frank Duveneck. She was well-traveled, visiting Europe, Egypt, and California with her parents, who were \\"protective\\" and raised Wheelwright as how a friend described as \\"growing up in cotton wool.\\" For 40 years, Wheelwright remained the \\"dutiful Victorian daughter.\\" She devoted herself to \\"good works, particularly a settlement-house music school in the South End of Boston.\\" As the heiress of a family trust, she had significant income that would support her throughout her life but lacked control of the capital, which was intended to protect her from \\"fortune-hunting suitors\\" but made her unable to endow the museum she would later found as she wished.  Life and work in the American Southwest  At age 40, after both her parents had died, Wheelwright journeyed to the American Southwest, where she \\"found and embraced a more primitive type of civilization, more adventuresome and more exciting than the safety of Boston.\\" In Alcalde, New Mexico, she stayed on a ranch. In addition, she traveled to the Four Corners region and Navajo reservation. There, she developed an interest in Navajo religion. In 1921, Wheelwright was introduced to Hosteen Klah, a Navajo medicine man and singer, who was worried about preserving traditional Navajo religious practices. The two developed a friendship and began working together to preserve Navajo religious practices, with Klah sharing details about Navajo ceremonies with Wheelwright, who recorded and translated them. While at the time, there was a taboo in the Navajo community against replicating ceremonies, Klah's fear of the knowledge of his culture's traditions being lost led him to share the information with Wheelwright. Throughout the next years, Wheelwright spent time traveling the world, living in the eastern United States, and living in Alcalde. In 1940, she traveled to India with the goal of finding symbols related to the ones found in Navajo art. She also visited Europe, Greece, Egypt, and China. She continued to record information about Navajo ceremonials given by Klah and by another 58 medicine men, and collected reproductions of ceremonial sandpaintings in various media. In 1923, Wheelwright purchased the Los Luceros Ranch near Alcalde. She befriended Maria Chabot, who managed the ranch for 20 years, and later gifted the ranch to Chabot. In 1937, Wheelwright and Klah established the House of Navajo Religion in Santa Fe. The name was later changed to the Museum of Navajo Ceremonial Art in 1939. In 1942 the Museum published Navajo Creation Myth - the Story of the Emergence by Hosteen Klah, Recorded by Mary C. Wheelwright.\\"Navajo Creation Myth.\\" Sacred Texts. (retrieved 17 Dec 2019) In 1977, the Museum was renamed the Wheelwright Museum of the American Indian. Wheelwright wrote an autobiography, titled Journey Towards Understanding, in 1957. Ultimately, it went unpublished during her lifetime. An excerpt was published in A Quilt of Words: Women's Diaries, Letters & Original Accounts of Life in the Southwest, 1860‚Äì1960 in 1988. In addition to traveling, Wheelwright enjoyed sailing. She spent summers on the coast of Maine and lived alone for a time in a shipmaster's cottage on Sutton Island.  Later life and death  Wheelwright continued to serve as director of the museum for the rest of her life. She died on July 29, 1958 at the age of 79 in her home in Maine.

She is a teenage girl wearing a black, pink and white kitten-themed costume, including cat ears, tail, and paws. She is described as an otaku, having an obsession with Japanese pop culture and speaking in Japanese and English with a Japanese accent, though given her blonde hair and blue eyes,. She is hired by G Corporation to be a mascot commercial. Her fighting style involves a lot of kicks, twirls, and flips, somewhat like a hip-hop dancer. As shown in her, Eddy Gordo and Jack-7's own endings, she's a good actor in her idol persona, but is revealed to be mean spirited in real life. Reception for Lucky Chloe has been mixed, with some criticizing her for an \\"uninspired and generic\\" design, while other have defended her by claiming that Tekken has had a number of more \\"ridiculous\\" characters than her. Appearances =Tekken series= Lucky Chloe is a J-pop sensation, devotion Otaku and the face of the G Corporation brand. When Eddy Gordo burst into G Corp and took out guard after guard with dance-like techniques, Chloe fearlessly walked right up to him and blocked his path. She threw the man one of her trademark smiles and issued him a challenge: Fight her, and if he loses he'll have to work as her backup dancer. Without caring if he'd accepted the conditions or not, she prepared for battle, and enters the King of Iron Fist Tournament 7. The tournament veteran, Interpol's detective Lei Wulong happens to be her fan. Design and gameplay Chloe was designed by Y≈´suke Kozaki, a character designer who had also worked on Fire Emblem Awakening and the No More Heroes series. The character's revelation drew complaints from forums such as NeoGAF, with some going so far as to ask Harada to remove the character from the game. Others, meanwhile, called out the character for being a fish out-of water conception or drew comparisons with characters from other fighting game series, Harada tweeted that he would consider to make Chloe exclusive for the Asian and European versions and a make well-muscled skinhead for the North American market; though the tweet was later clarified as a joke, as several game outlets apparently took the comment seriously. Chloe's fighting style is Freestyle Dance. According to the German edition GamePro, \\"Chloe kills the life energy of her opponents with her nimble Mids and Lows bit by bit - a comparatively aggressive character, whose fighting style meets her cat costume.\\" Merchandise A 1/7 scale statue of Lucky Chloe was released in July 2016 by Kotobukiya. The artwork for the statue was designed by Shunya Yamashita. Reception Overall reception for Lucky Chloe has been mixed, with Wesley Yin-Poole of Eurogamer observing \\"Lucky Chloe has already divided the fighting game community, with some criticising her Japanese idol design as uninspired and generic. Others point to the fact the Tekken series, despite being more realistic in terms of hand to hand combat, has a tradition of including outlandish characters, many of which are designed to appeal to a Japanese audience.\\" Todd Black from ToonZone asked if Tekken 7 \\"crossed a line\\" by including Chloe in the game, where he added \\"For while fighting games may not be ‚Äúrealistic‚Äù, they are meant to be believable. Or at least, believable within the context of the world. If you compare Street Fighter to Tekken, you see clear differences between the fighters and their styles. But even in those worlds, what‚Äôs believable, and what‚Äôs not, is clear. Enter‚Ä¶Lucky Chloe‚Ä¶\\" Black also stated \\"She wasn‚Äôt believable in the context of Tekken 7. Whether it was her ridiculous outfit, the fact that her hands are essentially padded (and thus won‚Äôt have as much striking power as her hands without them), or even her breakdancing fighting style, fans just couldn‚Äôt put stock into her.\\" At WhatCulture, gaming journalist Scott Tailford declared her as the worst character in Tekken 7, commenting \\"A character that almost feels designed to annoy the hardcore set, Lucky Chloe's aesthetic is already far too influenced by the most stereotypical of eastern tween anime, but in practice, her moveset just doesn't hold up either.\\" Tailford also criticizes her Rage Art for being \\"incredibly cheap,\\" due to her \\"sliding\\" under other characters before connecting. Gavin Jasper from Den of Geek sarcastically responded to her criticism by saying \\"Yes, it seems that a girl dressed as a cat just doesn‚Äôt fit in with a cast of such characters as a boxing kangaroo, a man made of wood, a robot teenage girl with chainsaw hands, and...whatever the hell Yoshimitsu is.\\" Eddie Makuch of GameSpot was more neutral about her, stating \\"The Tekken series is known for its quirky characters, so Lucky Chloe's outlandish design isn't much of a surprise.\\" In a list of characters more \\"ridiculous\\" than Chloe, Eurogamer's Aoife Wilson spoke in defense of her, noting that she likes \\"flippy kick-ass fighters\\", while also praising her \\"adorable\\" attitude. In a review of Tekken 7 by Game Revolution, James Kozanitis opined that Chloe \\"is sure to be a fan favorite,\\" citing her obsession with the Japanese culture.

In the 9th and 10th centuries, he served the Christian Church as a monk and an abbot, and ultimately as the bishop of the ancient city of Khytri. He is venerated for his apparently miraculous rescue of Christian Cypriots who had been enslaved by Saracen invaders. Life Contemporaneous documentation of Demetrian's life is limited to a single manuscript. Complicating his record, he has at times been called by the common names Demetrio or Demetrius. The lone manuscript holds that Demetrian was the son of a priest, born in a small village named Sika in medieval Cyprus. As a young man, he wed a woman who died only a few months after marriage. After her death, he devoted himself to the Christian Church. Demetrian served in a monastery dedicated to Saint Anthony, and he was eventually ordained as that institution's abbot, or hegoumenos, a position he is said to have held for forty years. Church leaders then elevated him to bishop of the city of Khytri, but at first he resisted the appointment. Not wanting to exchange his quiet monastic life for a busy episcopal office in the city, he is said to have fled, and was hidden in a cave by a friend. Ultimately, however, his friend became uncomfortable with the situation, and Demetrian was convinced to return to the city and embrace his appointment. He served as bishop of Khytri for some twenty-five years, from 885 until his death, and is acknowledged by the Catholic Encyclopedia as that office's most famous inhabitant. Near the end of his life, Demetrian saw Cyprus overrun by Saracen invaders. Many Christians were taken captive and marched toward Baghdad to become slaves. Despite his advanced age, Demetrian followed them on the road and pleaded desperately for their release. Seemingly miraculously, the Saracens were persuaded and they released the captives to him. Legacy A longstanding devotional following of Saint Demetrian continues through the present day in Cyprus. His annual feast day is celebrated on 6 November. Venerated as a patron saint of prisoners, Demetrian is also invoked in a more general fashion by a preamble to Catholic prayer: \\"Loving Father, through the intercession of Saint Demetrian, rescue me from the anxieties that hold me captive\\".

Devaraj Urs Road is the most prominent shopping street of Mysore city in Karnataka state, India. This street is also the center of the downtown or the Central business district area in the city. In post office parlance, Devaraj Urs road is known as Mysore One. History This street was named after the former Chief Minister of Karnataka Shri. Devaraj Urs. He was a popular chief minister and a reformist. This area was formerly called Devaraja Mohalla and a weekly market was regularly conducted here. The location of the market became the present Devaraja Market. Location Devaraj Urs road is about one mile in length. There are many parallel roads to Devaraj Urs Road and a total of two kilometer square area makes up the downtown of Mysore city. The street has an east‚Äìwest orientation. K.R.Circle comes in the northwest corner of the Mysore palace and Devaraj Urs Road starts here. JLB Road joins the Devaraj Urs road near the Maharani's College. Nature of business Most of the shops in the Devaraj Urs Road are those selling clothes and ornaments. There are also branches of leading banks here. Restaurants are not many but a few of them are available in the parallel roads. Parking is allowed on one side of the road and the entire street is one way. There is only one coffee shop but the smell of coffee permeates the atmosphere because there are many shops selling fresh coffee powder. All buildings on this road has a similar fa√ßade. Modern period In the modern period, Mysore has seen the experiment of opening many shopping malls in different parts of the city. But the footfall on Devaraj Market still continues to be the highest in the city for a number of reasons. One is the proximity to the city bus station and the other is access to the railway station which is only one kilometer from here. Timings Unlike in the west, shops in Mysore open late and close early. Most shops close by nine in the evening some stretching up to 10 pm.

The episode was written by co-executive producers Eugenie Ross-Leming & Brad Buckner and directed by Thomas J. Wright. It was first broadcast on May 11, 2016 on The CW. In the episode, Sam and Dean set to find Lucifer/Castiel as he continues being tortured by Amara while God has a new strategy as Metatron finds a new Prophet. The title is a reference to the hit TV show All in the Family. The episode received critical acclaim, with critics commenting on Metatron's choice and the new Prophet. Plot Picking up where the previous episode left, Sam (Jared Padalecki) and Dean (Jensen Ackles) are astounded to find Chuck (Rob Benedict). He then transports them to the bunker where He invokes the spirit of Kevin Tran (Osric Chau) and then sends him to Heaven. Now realizing Chuck is God, Sam is a bit excited but Dean is mad at Him for having abandoned humanity when they were in trouble though Chuck tells him to stop shifting his issues with his father on Him. Meanwhile, Amara (Emily Swallow) continues torturing Lucifer/Castiel (Misha Collins) as a way to lure God. Amara appears to Dean in an hallucination to show him Lucifer's health state. That night, another fog attacks a town called Lewis in Oklahoma and kills everyone in the town, except for a professor named Donatello Redfield (Keith Szarabajka). Metatron (Curtis Armstrong) is informed by this in a bar and notices Sam and Dean during a report of Hope Springs. He contacts Sam and Dean to find Donatello. When they interrogate him, Donatello reveals he suffered visions (the same Kevin showed when he was chosen as a Prophet), and they come to realize that Donatello is a Prophet. Metatron then shows Sam and Dean God's autobiography, which is in fact a suicide note as he will sacrifice himself battling Amara. Dean confronts him on this choice as God tells them that he will be protecting his creations this way before stating if he failed, Sam and Dean will take over. Dean then tells him he shouldn't sacrifice himself, as God considers it. While Sam, Metatron and Donatello rescue Lucifer from Amara's hideout, Dean tries to distract her. Eventually, she discovers Dean has met God and that they're planning on freeing Lucifer from her. Metatron stays behind and tries to hold back Amara but she's too powerful for his cast and he is imploded into nothingness. She catches Sam, Lucifer and Donatello while trying to free and tries to kill them, when they're transported by God to the Bunker. God and Lucifer finally meet face to face for the first time in millennia and God heals Lucifer's wounds. Sam and Dean send Donatello back home and Dean states to Sam that Amara has plans for him. Reception =Viewers= The episode was watched by 1.75 million viewers with a 0.7/2 share among adults aged 18 to 49. This was a 13% increase in viewership from the previous episode, which was watched by 1.54 million viewers. This means that 0.7 percent of all households with televisions watched the episode, while 2 percent of all households watching television at that time watched it. Supernatural ranked as the second most watched program on The CW in the day, behind Arrow. =Critical reviews= \\"All in the Family\\" received critical acclaim. Matt Fowler of IGN gave the episode a \\"great\\" 8.3 out of 10 and wrote in his verdict, \\"'All in the Family' seemed to work, in the end, getting everyone (who survived) on the same page regarding the Darkness. It wasn't a flat episode, but it also wasn't the most thrilling. Once again, Chuck had to snap his fingers and save our heroes in the end, which helped demonstrate how formidable Amara is. Though Chuck's fickleness about most everything makes him more of a wild card than an ally.\\" Sean McKenna from TV Fanatic, gave a 4.2 star rating out of 5, stating: \\"If anything, this hour had its moving parts, but it was a stepping stone toward getting to that big match. I'm invested and intrigued by what's to come, but I just hope there's some solid payoff when all is said and done.\\" Bridget LaMonica from Den of Geek, gave a perfect 5 star rating out of 5, stating: \\"God, Lucifer and Amara, oh my! This episode took off right where the last left off, with Dean and Sam staring in shock at the former Prophet Chuck. His credibility was accounted for by bringing Kevin forward, and sending him on his way to Heaven. Be still, my heart.\\" Samantha Highfill of EW wrote, \\"Ever since the apocalypse story line in seasons 4 and 5, I've hoped and, quite fittingly, prayed that this show would eventually get back around to one of the things it does best: using religion to tell its story. And one could make the argument that this season uses it more than any other, considering the official introduction of God. Regardless, this week's episode was yet another reminder of why those stories work so well for this show. Because if this show specializes in family drama, there's no better family drama than that of God, his sister, and all of his children.\\" MaryAnn Sleasman of TV.com wrote, \\"Well, they can't all be mind-blowing, mythology- smashing, head-canon-confirming buckets of awesome.

It lived during the Late Pleistocene, about 10,000 years ago; fossils have been found in Brazil. The only known species is Piauhytherium capivarae.Gu√©rin, Claude, and Martine Faure. \\"Un nouveau Toxodontidae (Mammalia, Notoungulata) du Pl√©istoc√®ne sup√©rieur du Nordeste du Br√©sil.\\" Geodiversitas 35.1 (2013): 155-205.  Description  This animal in general terms resembles a hippopotamus, with a big short snout, a massive body and a big head. The skull measured almost in length, which indicates that Piauhytherium could be as big as a modern black rhinoceros. With regard to its nearest relatives, such as Toxodon, this animal's legs were shorter and thicker, in addition, certain differences in the denture distinguish it from other notoungulates of this period.  Classification  Piauhytherium capivarae was described for the first time in 2013, based on a complete skull including a jaw and some postcranial bones found in Serra da Capivara in Piau√≠, in northeastern Brazil. This animal belonged to a group of notoungulates known as Toxodonta, which comprises numerous herbivores from the Cenozoic of South America, whose better-known representative is Toxodon. (Some remains found in Brazil have been reassigned to Piauhytherium.) Piauhytherium was very similar to Toxodon, but is differentiated in some features of is leg bones and characteristics of the teeth.  Paleobiology  The limb bones, which are particularly short and massive, led the authors of the original scientific description to hypothesise that P. capivarae led a semiaquatic lifestyle, similar to that of modern hippopotamus. This hypothesis had already been previously proposed for other toxodontids (including Toxodon), but equally has been refuted by other studies. The discovery of Piauhytherium is remarkable since it increases the degree of diversity of the toxodontids in the final stages of their evolutionary history: in the Upper Pleistocene only Toxodon, Trigodonops and Mixotoxodon were also known.

Marie Madeleine Jodin (1741‚Äì1790) was an eighteenth-century French actress, friend of Diderot, and early feminist. Jodin was born to a prostitute mother and a Swiss clockmaker father. After a childhood of forced imprisonment and religious conversion, she eventually became an actress performing in the Comedie Francaise in Paris and then in Warsaw, Dresden, and Bordeaux during the 1760s. When her father died she became the ward of his friend, the encyclopedist, and art critic Denis Diderot, who would become her mentor. Diderot's help would shape the course of her adult acting life and many of her feminist theories that she would later present in her treatise Vues Legislative Pour Les Femmes to the French National Assembly. Her treatise is considered to be the first feminist work to be written and signed by a woman in the French Revolutionary period and Enlightenment periods.  Early life  Marie's father, Jean Jodin, married a former prostitute much older than himself. Due to the nature of his marriage his artisan family was wary of his new wife's ability to be a fit mother and suitable wife, Through letters that Jean Jodin wrote to his sister it is known that Marie Jodin was a troublesome child; her own father called her a ‚Äúmonster clothed in a human face‚Äù. At the age of nine she was forced to convert from Protestant to Catholic, a conversion that she fought throughout her childhood into her teenage years. As being Protestant in France was much more undesirable than being Catholic, it was advised that children convert in order to be treated better. Families like the Jodins were able to gain extra money by making children renounce the Protestant faith, or forcing a conversion. Throughout her life, Jodin was described as ‚Äúquarrelsome and (having) often violent behavior‚Äù. Her violent behavior and her constant rejection of her Catholic conversion led to Jodin being sent to many convents throughout her childhood, as a way to fix her problems. Her behavior did not change while she was in the convents; she violently resisted the disciplines of convent life and of her conversion, and was expelled from six different convents. Her passage through these convents did however allow Jodin to become well educated, which in her adult years would allow her to write with intellectual and social confidence.  Imprisonment  Jodin's family saw her as a lost cause, and pushed for her imprisonment. Familial rights were very strong during the 18th century throughout France, if a family wanted a young woman held against her own will, for their own good, the state could assist them in attempting to control their daughters and save their reputations. By the age of 16, after being expelled from numerous convents, Jodin along with her mother were working as prostitutes. Marie's family believes that her own mother forced her into prostitution at such a young age for her own financial gain. As a result, they were imprisoned for their actions for two years. This period of two years at which Jodin was imprisoned in Salp√™tri√®re Hospital had a profound effect on her life, and her later political writings. Conditions were deplorable even for 18th century standards; girls lived in cramped overcrowded rooms and only received blankets during the cold winter months. Stories of prisoners being beaten for lack of productivity or disobedience were common. It was said by a member of an acting troupe, which Jodin would later belong to, that her shoulders showed visible signs of abuse and whippings that she received during her time at Salp√™tri√®re.  Diderot' influence  After her release from the hospital in 1760, Jodin was able to get back on her feet quickly largely in part to her late father's close friend, Denis Diderot. He arranged for her to go to the Com√©die Fran√ßaise, which allowed her to become a licensed actress within a year of her being released. Diderot aimed to shape Jodin life through his personal theories on life as well as acting. As a mentor Diderot encouraged her to reform her life through rebuilding her character according to his dramatic and ethical theories. Diderot encouraged Jodin's intellectual ambitions that she had always had from a young age. Although Diderot was one of Jodin's closest friends and helped influence her life as well as her own theories on feminism, his name was never mentioned in her treatise, due to his conflicting views with Jean Jacques Rousseau.  Acting career  Within a year of being released from her imprisonment Jodin was already a licensed actress, thanks to her friend Denis Diderot. Diderot was able to get her into the Com√©die Fran√ßaise in Paris. Actresses, like prostitutes, could not enjoy the basic civil or religious rights of the average person. They were unable to marry, pass on property, or have their children legitimized. Many actresses died young or ended up living in poverty, or in worst cases would become prostitutes. These men and women were criticized for the qualities that made them successful. Theatre was a form of self-promoting and was seen as very flamboyant which was why those involved in theatre were considered morally suspect by many. Actresses were at best depicted as ladies of easy virtue, at worst as whores. As in her childhood, Jodin's years as an actress were tested by her short temper and erratic behavior. In 1766 when she was working in Warsaw there was an incident where she was arguing violently with her manager and another actor because a satirical pamphlet had come out about the French troupe that many thought Jodin had written. Following the release of the pamphlet an anonymous and vicious libel on Jodin's character came out. Jodin refused to act until she received an apology from whoever had slandered her; by doing this she risked imprisonment yet again (for breach of contract), but she refused to stand down. In 1769 she was imprisoned while working in Bordeaux for mocking a religious procession. That same year while acting in Angers she again quarreled with her manager and this time was fired. She then successfully sued her manager for breach of contract. All of these quarrels that she had with her managers and her co-workers were attempts to assert her rights ‚Äúand to gain some form of symbolic or legal reimbursement in the face of indiscriminate power‚Äù.  Vues L√©gislatives Pour Les Femmes  In 1790 she presented a treatise, entitled Vues L√©gislatives Pour Les Femmes, or Legislative Views for Women, in front of the French National Assembly. Political works written by women in the 18th century were considered oddities; a letter, novel or a memoir was considered more suitable for female expression. But Marie Jodin was a radical for her time, who envisioned women in roles of political power, not the ones being told what to do. It wasn't until the eve of the revolution that women like Jodin were able to write on political topics, such as the rights of women. As daughter of a citizen of Geneva, Jodin believed she had inherited an honorable and superior social status that gave her confidence to defend her rights as a woman and as a citizen of France. Throughout her treatise she constantly evoked Jean-Jacques Rousseau, who, in his own work, celebrated the citizens of Geneva. This enabled her to draft a model of citizenship which he had originally designed for men, and to apply it to women. Her 86-page treatise defended and argued for women in France on numerous different levels. Her primary demand was for the establishment of a women's legislature with jurisdiction over women's issues such as the institution of divorce. She believed that women should be in the realm of public life in order to legislate on behalf of women. She was interested in changing the political situation for women in France and since women were becoming more involved in public activities, due to the Enlightenment, she emphasized that ‚Äúthe love of country, the love of liberty and glory animates our sex as much as yours, messieurs. We are not another species on earth‚Äù. She argued that men and women were equal, and that there should be a single standard for both sexes. She also proposed the eradication of prostitution; she attacked public prostitution and more specifically the wider idea of moral corruption. Inspired by her own time spent imprisoned due to prostitution, she argued for the suppression of prostitution, but did not want prostitutes to be imprisoned. She sought to transform them by allowing them to become useful and productive citizens, rather than locking them up and allowing for the vicious cycle of prostitution and poverty to continue. In the same year that she presented her treatise, Jodin died. Two years after her death the Law of 20 September 1792 passed. This law legalized divorce, and was the most liberal law on divorce in Europe. Marie Jodin's treatise allowed for the understanding of social and gender composition of the time and demonstrated that a feminist agenda was already securely in place during the early days of the French Revolution.

It was established by Bernard V. Travis and was first described as those with \\"polymastiginid flagellates having three anterior flagella and a trailing one originating at a single basal granule located in front of the anteriorly positioned nucleus, and a more or less well-defined axostyle\\".Travis, B. V. 1932. A Discussion of Synonymy in the Nomenclature of Certain Insect Flagellates, with the Description of a New Flagellate from the Larvae of Ligyrodes relictus Say (Coleoptera-Scarabaeidae). Iowa State Coll J. Sci., 6, 317‚Äì323. It is the first eukaryotic genus to be found to completely lack mitochondria, and all hallmark proteins responsible for mitochondrial function. Data suggests that the absence of mitochondria is not an ancestral feature, but rather due to secondary loss. Monocercomonoides sp. was found to obtain energy through an enzymatic action of nutrients absorbed from the environment. The genus has replaced the iron-sulphur cluster assembly pathway with a cytosolic sulphur mobilization system, likely acquired by horizontal gene transfer from a eubacterium of a common ancestor of oxymonads.Vacek, V., Novak, L. V. F., Treitli, S. C., et al. 2018. Fe‚ÄìS Cluster Assembly in Oxymonads and Related Protists. Molecular Biology and Evolution. 35(11): 2712-2718. These organisms are significant because they overrule the notion that eukaryotes must have mitochondria to properly function. The genome of Monocercomonoides has approximately 75 million base pairs (75 Mbp), with 16629 predicted protein-coding genes.  Habitat and ecology  Monocercomonoides species are obligate animal symbionts that live in the digestive tracts of insects, amphibians, reptiles, and mammals.Lauter, F. H. 1959. Haemoflagellates and intestinal flagellates from anura of Louisiana. Louisiana State University. Monocercomonoides are common in insect orders Orthoptera and Coleoptera. The species Monocercomonoides qadrii are found in the rectum of the larva of the dung-beetle (Oryctes rhinoceros).Bhaskar Roa, T. 1969. The morphology and Incidence of the genus Monocercomonoides of insects found in Andhra Pradesh, India. Proceedings of the Indian Academy of Sciences. 70(5): 208-214. The following species M. caviae, M. wenrichi, M. quadrifunilis, and M. exilis are found in the caecum of guinea pigs, and M. caprae has been found in the rumen of goats.Flynn, F. J. 1923. Parasites of Laboratory Animals. Iowa: Blackwell Publishing. In a study by Karnkowska (2016) Monocercomonoides were found in the guts of a chinchilla that belonged to one of the lab members. Leslie, M. 2016. First eukaryotes found without a normal cellular power supply. Science Mag. Researchers found the organisms in the intestines of chinchilla hosts, where nutrients are abundant but oxygen is scarce. The organism uses enzymes found in its cytoplasm to break down food and furnish energy since there is no mitochondria or oxygen presence. It has been noted that Monocercomonoides ingest bacteria or wood and feed by pinocytosis, however, limited studies have been done on feeding style.  Morphology  Monocercomonoides are small free-swimming, single-cell organisms ranging from 5-12Œºm in length, and 4.5-14.5Œºm in width. The body may be ovoidal, pyriform, spherical or subspherical; however, they lack holdfasts and have small axostyles.Laird, M. 1955. Intestinal Flagellates from Some New Zealand Insects. Transactions and Proceedings of the Royal Society of New Zealand. 84: 297-307. The axostyle is a single, contractible appendage made of microtubules that originates from the posterior end of the preaxostyle, and is situated near the posterior pair of the basal bodies (known as blepharoplast in older cytological literature). The cytoskeleton is based around four basal bodies, an anterior pair and a posterior pair.Simpson, A. G. B., Radek, R., Dacks, J. B., and O'Kelly, C. J. 2002. How oxymonads lost their groove: An ultrastructural comparison of Monocercomonoides and excavate taxa. Journal of Eukaryotic Microbiology 49: 239-248. The preaxostyle runs between the two pairs of basal bodies and is composed of a broad, curved sheet of microtubules. The inner face of the microtubule sheet adheres to a paracrystalline fibre (about 50nm thick) which is a common characteristic of all oxymonads. Monocercomonoides sp. has four flagella that originate in two pairs and arise from each basal body found in the anterior end. Three of the four flagella and roughly equal in length (9.5-18Œºm) and the fourth trailing flagellum is slightly longer, measuring between 9.0-24.5Œºm. The flagella have a beating action and are used for rapid movement. The proximal part of the long flagellum may adhere to the pellicle, which causes it to trail posteriorly. The trailing flagellum is always directed backwards and is attached to the body for a considerable distance (6-9Œºm) by an accessory filament called a funis. There are one to four funises (rib-like strictures) extending backwards beneath the body surface. In some parasites, the flagella end in acronemes. The nucleus is generally situated near the anterior end of the body and contains a central endosome surrounded by chromatin granules, some species have pelta-like structures below the nucleus. The cytoplasm is granular with or without vacuoles. Electron microscopic imaging of Monocercomonoides has found that the intracellular morphology lacks any Golgi apparatus, mitochondria, or potential homologs of the two, Golgi-associated proteins have been detected, but mitochondrial ones have not.  Metabolic processes  Monocercomonoides sp. is the first eukaryote discovered to lack any trace of mitochondria. In all other eukaryotes that seemingly lack mitochondria, there is nuclear DNA that contains some of the genes required to assemble mitochondria, but no such genes are present in Monocercomonoides. It also lacks any genes ordinarily found in mitochondrial DNA, and genes used to make the energy-extracting enzymes present in mitochondria. Monocercomonoides are able to get some energy from glucose using anaerobic metabolic pathways that operate in the cytoplasm, however, most of its energy is obtained using enzymes that break down the amino acid arginine.  Glycolytic pathway  Each molecule of glucose catabolized in Monocercomonoides yields less ATP compared to mitochondrial eukaryotes that use the tricarboxylic acid cycle and electron transport chain.Liapounova, N. A., Hampl, V., Gordon, P. M., Sensen, C.W., Gedamu, L., and Dacks, J.B. 2006. Reconstructing the mosaic glycolytic pathway of the anaerobic eukaryote Monocercomonoides. Eukaryotic Cell 5(12): 2138-2146. To aid in energy conservation, Monocercomonoides has adapted alternative glycolytic enzymes. Four alternative glycolytic enzymes include pyrophosphate-fructose-6-phosphate phosphotransferase (PFP), fructose- bisphosphate aldolase class II (FBA class II), 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate independent phosphoglycerate mutase (iPGM), and pyruvate phosphate dikinase (PPDK). Glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (GPI) is predicted to be in Monocercomonoides since it is universally distributed among Eukaryotes, Bacteria, and some Archaea and essential in catabolic glycolysis, but has not yet been found. Most of the glycolytic enzymes are the standard eukaryotic versions, making Monocercomonoides' metabolic pathway a mosaic similar to that of other anaerobes. The addition of PPDK to the conversion of phosphoenolpyruvate to pyruvate (typically catalyzed solely by pyruvate kinase) has a strong effect on ATP conservation. Both PFP and PPDK rely on inorganic phosphate (PPi) as the phosphate donor; therefore rather than hydrolyzing ATP, the ATP yield is increased by using a by-product of the cell's anabolic processes as an energy source. These reactions are able to allow for greater ATP conservation and regulation of glycolysis due to the PPDK's reversible nature and use of inorganic phosphate where pyruvate kinase only catalyzes the forward reaction.  Arginine deiminase pathway  In addition to the adjusted glycolysis, Monocercomonoides contain enzymes needed in the arginine deiminase (degradation) pathway. The arginine deiminase pathway may be used for ATP production, as in Giardia intestinalis and Trichomonas vaginalis. In G. intestinalis (an anaerobic unicellular eukaryote) this pathway produces eight times more ATP than sugar metabolism, and a similar output is expected in Monocercomonoides, but has yet to be confirmed.  Iron-sulfur cluster  Iron-sulfur clusters are important protein components that are synthesized by mitochondria. The main function of these small inorganic prosthetic groups is mediating electron transport, which makes them a key part of photosynthesis, respiration, DNA replication/repair, and regulation of gene expression. In eukaryotic cells, the common pathway for Fe-S cluster synthesis is ISC (iron-sulfur cluster). In the cytosol, a cytosolic iron-sulfur cluster assembly (CIA) forms Fe-S cluster-containing proteins that are responsible for the maturation of nuclear Fe-S proteins. CIA is unique to eukaryotes and does not have prokaryotic homologs. The mitochondrial ISC pathway is believed to be necessary for the function of CIA since it synthesizes and transports uncharacterized sulfur-containing precursor to the cytosol, and is a major reason for retention of mitochondrial-related organelles in anaerobic eukaryotes. The genus Monocercomonoides contains the CIA pathways but completely lacks the ISC pathway, along with any mitochondrial proteins. The genus contains a reduced version of the SUF (sulfur utilization factor) pathway, having only three proteins - SufB, SufC, and SufU. The SUF pathway is a known pathway of prokaryotes, and it is believed that the genes used to build Monocercomonoides' SUF system had to have come from prokaryotes. However, Monocercomonoides' SUF proteins were found to not be related to plastid homologues, or any other microbial eukaryotes. It was proposed that the pathway was acquired from a eubacterium by horizontal gene transfer (HGT) in the common ancestor of Monocercomonoides and Paratrismastrix (a sister taxon of oxymonads). The genetic acquisition has not been demonstrated despite the assumption that it must have occurred.  Mitochondrial acquisition and loss  Monocercomonoides contain no detectable sign that mitochondria were ever part of the organism. However, since it is widely accepted that all eukaryotes have a common ancestor that evolved mitochondria, it is believed that mitochondria must have once been present in the ancestors to oxymonads and then secondarily lost. The amitchondrial genus demonstrates that mitochondria are not absolutely essential for life of a eukaryotic cell.  Genomic structure  The lack of mitochondria or any mitochondria-related organelles in Monocercomonoides is confirmed by its genome sequence. A complete genome sequence analysis of Monocercomonoides sp. PA203 from Chinchilla lanigera was conducted. The estimated size of the genome is ~75Mb and the number of predicted protein-coding genes is 16,629. Homology searches reveal a lack of genes that encode mitochondrial import machinery, metabolite transport proteins, and iron-sulfur clusters. Additionally, an absence of targeted important genes and genes coding for mitochondrial membrane proteins were revealed when a search for specific N-terminal and C-terminal sequences was conducted. Genes that are typically encoded on mitochondrial genomes (mtDNA) were not found among the assembled scaffold, suggesting Monocercomonoides lacks mtDNA. 18S RNA genes were sequenced and found to be 2,927 nt long, and is among the longest known. Some expansions were specific to Monocercomonoides, but many were similar to those in other oxymonad genera but substantially longer. Comparisons of genes coding for ùõº-tubulin, ùõΩ-tubulin, ùõæ-tubulin, EF-1ùõº, EF-2, cytHSP70, ubiquitin, 18S rRNA, and HSP90 allow the placement of oxymonads near diplomonads and trichomonads, with Monocercomonoides and Streblomastix making up the oxymonad branch.

He was awarded a James King of Irrawang travelling scholarship and studied politics, philosophy and economics at The Queen's College, Oxford receiving a B.A. in 1926 and an M.A. in 1933. In 1927 he married Peace Flavelle Little stepsister/cousin of Elaine Marjory Little they had one child Pacita in 1934 Australian Dictionary of Biography - Moore, Tom Inglis by Elizabeth Perkins Moore taught in universities in Iowa and the Philippines before returning to Sydney in 1931, where he taught at the university. From 1934-1940 he was a leader-writer and literary reviewer for The Sydney Morning Herald, before enlisting in the Australian Imperial Force in July 1940. After the war he taught at Canberra University College, which was later amalgamated with the Australian National University. He was promoted to associate professor in 1959, and retired in 1966. Moore was a member of the advisory board of the Commonwealth Literary Fund from 1945 to 1971 and was a passionate supporter of Australian literature. During his working life he published collections of poetry, gave talks for the Australian Broadcasting Commission on literary topics, wrote reviews and critical articles, and edited anthologies of Australian short stories and poetry. He died in Canberra in 1978.

This event was the first one under the full control of the new ownership group consisting of William Morris Endeavor, Silver Lake Partners, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and MSD Capital. This event was the most bought UFC pay-per-view of all time with a buyrate of 1.65 million, until UFC 229 (which also featured McGregor in the main event) broke the record with 2.4 million.https://www.mmafighting.com/2018/10/11/17962158/ufc-229-khabib-vs- mcgregor-destroys-previous-mma-record-for-pay-per-views Background The event was headlined by a welterweight rematch between The Ultimate Fighter 5 winner and former lightweight title challenger Nate Diaz and UFC Featherweight Champion Conor McGregor. UFC President Dana White said they worked on booking the rematch due to \\"McGregor's obsession with it\\". The pairing previously met earlier in the year at UFC 196. McGregor was expected to challenge then UFC Lightweight Champion Rafael dos Anjos, but Dos Anjos pulled out due to a broken foot only 11 days before the event. Diaz eventually replaced him and the bout was shifted to the welterweight division. Diaz won the fight via rear-naked choke in the second round. Their rematch was originally expected to take place at UFC 200, but everything changed during mid-April, as a disagreement between McGregor and the UFC, regarding his media schedule, led to his removal from the event and then Diaz was also pulled out. A bout between former UFC Light Heavyweight Championship challengers Anthony Johnson and Glover Teixeira was expected to serve as the co-main event for UFC on Fox: Holm vs. Shevchenko. However, Johnson pulled out one month before the event to tend to personal issues. In turn, promotion officials elected to pull Teixeira from the card and the pairing was left intact and rescheduled to take place at this event. Dong Hyun Kim was expected to face Neil Magny at the event. However, Kim pulled out due to injury on July 12 and was replaced by Lorenz Larkin. A welterweight contest between former WEC Welterweight Champion and former interim UFC Welterweight Champion Carlos Condit and Demian Maia, a former UFC Middleweight Championship challenger, was scheduled to take place at this event, but was moved a week later to headline an already scheduled FOX event. Sultan Aliev was expected to face Hyun Gyu Lim at the event. However, Aliev pulled out of the fight in early August citing a wrist injury. Lim faced promotional newcomer Mike Perry. On August 5, Sean Strickland pulled out of his planned bout against Tim Means due to a knee injury. He was replaced by promotional newcomer Sabah Homasi. The Ultimate Fighter: China winner Ning Guangyou tested positive for clenbuterol from an out-of-competition sample taken May 19, but USADA found he ingested the substance without fault or negligence. They reviewed the evidence of the case ‚Äì Ning's whereabouts, dietary habits and the lab reports showing \\"very low parts per billion concentrations\\" of the substance ‚Äì and determined that it very likely came from tainted meat, as countries like Mexico and China have a high risk for meats contaminated with the substance. Ning will not face a suspension. He was expected to face Marlon Vera at this event, but due to this incident the bout was pushed back one week for UFC on Fox: Maia vs. Condit.

Under the DS approach, syntactic knowledge is understood as the ability to incrementally analyse the structure and content of spoken and written language in context and in real-time. While it posits representations similar to those used in Combinatory Categorial Grammars (CCG), it builds those representations left-to-right going word-by-word. Thus it differs from other syntactic models which generally abstract way from features of everyday conversation such as interruption, backtracking, and self-correction. Moreover, it differs from other approaches in that it does not postulate an independent level of syntactic structure over words. DS emerged in the late 1990s and early 2000s through the work of prominent figures such as Ruth Kempson, Ronnie Cann, Wilfried Meyer-Viol and Dov Gabbay. The first monograph- length work in the framework was released in 2001 under the title Dynamic Syntax: the flow of understanding. It was embedded in wider trends in linguistic thinking of the 20th century, especially in syntax, semantics, pragmatics and phonology. The Dynamics of Language by Ronnie Cann, Ruth Kempson and Lutz Marten followed on from the 2001 title and expanded the discussion and empirical coverage of the framework. Subsequent years saw an expansion of the empirical coverage of the framework to modelling structures in Japanese, Korean, dialects of Modern Greek, Medieval Spanish and a variety of Bantu languages including Swahili, Rangi and siSwati. More recent work has also explored the way in which the framework can naturally be expanded to model dialogue. Theoretical assumptions While most grammar formalisms characterise properties of strings of words, in Dynamic Syntax it is propositional structure which is characterised. Propositional structure is modelled through recourse of binary semantic trees. Propositional structure is built up on a strictly incremental manner on a left-to-right basis and is represented through processes of tree growth. Under this framework, syntactic knowledge is considered to be the knowledge to parse/process strings in context. A consequence of this is that it is not just the final tree that is important for representational purposes, but all of the intermediate stages of the parsing/production process. Similarly, since the trees represent propositions, the same tree represents the same proposition (albeit represented through different sentences) from different languages. The framework assumes a single level of representation. This contrasts with frameworks such as Lexical Functional Grammar in which multiple structures are posited. Similarly, no movement operations are considered necessary, unlike in Minimalism or other Generative approaches. Parts of the formalism Dynamic Syntax constitutes several core components: semantic formulae and composition calculus (epsilon calculus within typed lambda calculus), trees (lambda application ordering), and tree building actions (lexical and computational actions). =Semantic formulae and compositional calculus= The semantic formulae which classical Dynamic Syntax generates are a combination of Epsilon calculus formulae and Lambda calculus terms (in recent years DS-TTR has been developed alongside DS where Record Types from the formalism Type Theory with Records (TTR)) are used - see Purver et al. (2011).Purver, M., Eshghi, A., & Hough, J. (2011, January). Incremental semantic construction in a dialogue system. In Proceedings of the Ninth International Conference on Computational Semantics (pp. 365-369). Association for Computational Linguistics. The formulae are either simple first order logic constants such as john', predicate terms such as run'(john') or functions such as \\\\lambda x.run'(x). Normal lambda calculus substitution (\\\\beta-reduction) means a function can be applied to a simple term to return a predicate such that (\\\\lambda x.run'(x))~john' = run'(john'). The Epsilon calculus extension to first order logic is implemented in quantifiers, where (\\\\exists x) A(x)\\\\ \\\\equiv \\\\ A(\\\\epsilon x\\\\ A) , e.g. the string \\"a boy\\" may result in the formula boy'(\\\\epsilon x\\\\ boy') being generated. = Tree growth = One of the basic assumptions behind DS is that natural language syntax can be seen as the progressive accumulation of transparent semantic representations with the upper goal being the construction of a logical propositional formula (a formula of type t). This process is driven by means of monotonic tree growth, representing the attempt to model the way information is processed in a time- linear, incremental, word-to-word manner. Tree growth is driven by means of requirements (indicated by the question mark (?)). 50px Material was copied from this source, which is available under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License. Tree growth can take place in three ways: through computational rules, lexical input and pragmatic enrichment. Computational rules involve an input and an output. These are considered to be universally available across languages. Given the right input the corresponding computational rule can ‚Äì although need not ‚Äì apply. This contrasts with lexical input which is lexically supplied and therefore language-specific. = The language of trees = The language of representation in Dynamic Syntax consists of binary trees. These trees are underpinned by the Logic Of Finite Trees (LOFT, Blackburn & Meyer-Viol 1994). LOFT is an expressive modal language that allows statements to be made about any treenode from the perspective of any treenode. LOFT uses two basic tree modalities, the up and down arrow relations. These correspond to the daughter and mother relations. Left nodes are addressed as 0 nodes and right nodes are 1 nodes. By convention, nodes on the left correspond to argument nodes, i.e. nodes in which arguments are represented, whereas right nodes correspond to the functor nodes, i.e. nodes in which all the various types of predicates are represented. The rootnode is given the treenode address 0 and it is defined as the sole node that does not have a mother node.  Conference series  The First Dynamic Syntax conference was held at SOAS University of London in April 2017. Prior to this there was a meeting of mainly Dynamic Syntax practitioners at Ghent University in Belgium. The Second Dynamic Syntax Conference was held at the University of Edinburg in 2018. The 3rd Dynamic Syntax conference was held at the University of Malta in May 2019. The 4th Dynamic Syntax conference will be held at the University of Oxford in May 2020. A Dynamic Syntax course was held at ESSLLI in 2019. A phd level course will be held at Bergen University in May 2020. Dynamic Syntax has been taught at institutions around the world including SOAS, Kings College London, the University of Essex in the UK, as well as at institutions in China.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1999. At the time of its nomination it contained four resources, which included one contributing building, one contributing site, and two non-contributing buildings. with The contributing resources include the remains of two kilns from Bonaparte Pottery, which operated from 1866 to 1895. It also includes the factory building (1876) that replaced a building that was destroyed in a fire in November 1875. The non-contributing resources include two buildings that are associated with the lumberyard that took over the site after the pottery closed. They were built after the period of historical significance. While modest in size compared with Red Wing Pottery in Minnesota and Western Stoneware in Illinois, Bonaparte Pottery was mid-sized operation associated with the pottery industry in Iowa. Pottery had a significant economic impact on the state from the mid to the late 19th-century. The Des Moines River Valley had the greatest concentration of potteries in the state because of the abundant coal deposits located there. Fire clay, which is used to manufacture ceramics, was a by-product of coal mining. Sidney Parker and Thomas Hanback founded the business in 1866. Robert Wilson and Henry Jones joined the business in its later years. The pottery went out of business in 1895 for a variety of reasons. The financial panic of 1893 undoubtedly played a part, but Bonaparte experienced a severe decline in manufacturing that began in the 1890s. Other pottery operations had improved their mechanization, they had a better quality of clay, and they were located closer to population centers where they could sell their products.

Background This was the first UFC event in Cleveland. The event was headlined by a UFC Heavyweight Championship bout between current champion (and Cleveland area native) Stipe Miocic against 2010 K-1 World Grand Prix winner and former Strikeforce Heavyweight Champion Alistair Overeem. The professional debut of former professional wrestler CM Punk took place at this event. Punk, who signed with the UFC in December 2014, had a delayed debut due to past injuries from professional wrestling that needed treatment and also due to his need for training time. He made his debut against Mickey Gall in a welterweight bout. The signing of CM Punk was originally announced during the UFC 181 broadcast on December 6, 2014. Ben Rothwell was expected to face former heavyweight champion Fabr√≠cio Werdum at this event. However, on August 11, Rothwell pulled out due to injury. A team representative said he may have suffered a torn meniscus and could have an ACL injury. He was replaced by Travis Browne. This was a rematch as Werdum defeated Browne via unanimous decision at UFC on Fox: Werdum vs. Browne in 2014. A lightweight bout between Erik Koch and Drew Dober was originally booked for UFC 195, but Koch pulled out due to an injury and the bout was scrapped. The fight was later rescheduled for this event, until Koch pulled out again due to injury and was replaced by promotional newcomer Jason Gonzalez. Mairbek Taisumov was expected to face Nik Lentz at the event. However, Taisumov was removed from the fight on September 1 for alleged visa issues and replaced by promotional newcomer Michael McBride. On September 5, it was announced that the lightweight bout between Damir Had≈æoviƒá and Yusuke Kasuya, slated to open the preliminary portion of the card, was postponed and will now take place at October's UFC Fight Night: Lamas vs. Penn after Had≈æoviƒá experienced issues with his travel visa. Ray Borg was scheduled to face Ian McCall at the event. However, Borg pulled out of the fight on September 7 citing an illness. With no time to find a suitable replacement, McCall was removed from the card. Michael McBride missed weight, coming in at 158 lb. As a result, he was fined 20% of his fight purse, which went to his opponent Nik Lentz. On the day of the event, C.B. Dollaway was forced out of his bout against Francimar Barroso due to a back injury he sustained in a malfunctioning elevator at his hotel. As a result, Barroso was also removed from the event.

In what was described by UFC president Dana White as the \\"biggest fight card\\" in the company's history, Conor McGregor became the first fighter in the promotion's history to hold titles in two divisions simultaneously. Background This event was the first UFC event hosted in New York City. It was also the first UFC event hosted in the state of New York after the longtime professional MMA ban was revoked in early 2016. To this point, UFC 7 was the only event contested in the state, taking place in September 1995 in Buffalo. The UFC worked tirelessly to surpass the law that forbade professional mixed martial arts events in the state, including a drastic measure: they announced an event (UFC 197) for the Madison Square Garden, despite the ban still being in effect. However, it was announced that a preliminary injunction allowing the promotion to hold the event was denied by a federal judge. The event was eventually moved and contested in the promotion's home base of Las Vegas, Nevada. =Main card: three title bouts, including a champion vs. champion contest= The event was headlined by a UFC Lightweight Championship bout between then champion Eddie Alvarez and UFC Featherweight Champion Conor McGregor. This was the second time in UFC history that champions in different divisions fought for the same title. The first time was at UFC 94 on January 31, 2009, when then-welterweight champion Georges St-Pierre defended his title against then-lightweight champion B.J. Penn. Alvarez was originally expected to make his first title defense against undefeated contender Khabib Nurmagomedov, but it was announced on September 21 that Alvarez missed the contract deadline for the bout and in consequence it was expected to take place at UFC 206 in December. Meanwhile, McGregor was previously expected to challenge for the lightweight title at UFC 196 in February against then champion Rafael dos Anjos. Dos Anjos eventually pulled out due to a broken foot and the bout never materialized. A UFC Welterweight Championship bout between the champion Tyron Woodley and five-time kickboxing world champion Stephen Thompson took place at the co-main event. A third title fight, a UFC Women's Strawweight Championship bout between the champion Joanna Jƒôdrzejczyk and Karolina Kowalkiewicz was also part of the card. The duo met previously in their amateur days in 2012, when Jƒôdrzejczyk defeated Kowalkiewicz via submission in the Amatorska Liga MMA Tournament final. Madison Square Garden hosted the much anticipated New York City debut of the UFC. A potential middleweight title eliminator between former UFC Middleweight Champion Chris Weidman and 2000 Olympic silver medalist and former world champion in freestyle wrestling Yoel Romero took place at this portion of the event. A welterweight bout between former champion Robbie Lawler and former lightweight title challenger Donald Cerrone was the first confirmed bout of the event. However, just a few days after the announcement, it was revealed the Lawler decided to take a little more time to get ready for the fight after losing his title via knockout at UFC 201. He was replaced by The Ultimate Fighter: Team Jones vs. Team Sonnen middleweight winner Kelvin Gastelum, who was scheduled to face Jorge Masvidal one week earlier than the event. Opening the main card was a women's bantamweight bout between former Strikeforce and UFC Women's Bantamweight Champion Miesha Tate and Raquel Pennington. Tate was Pennington's coach during The Ultimate Fighter: Team Rousey vs. Team Tate. =Preliminary card: a former champion and title challengers stack the under- card= A featherweight contest between former lightweight champion Frankie Edgar and Jeremy Stephens was the featured bout of the preliminary card. A few other bouts also took part of the Fox Sports 1 televised prelims: *Despite being originally expected to face Alvarez, Khabib Nurmagomedov faced Michael Johnson instead in a potential lightweight title eliminator. *A middleweight bout between Tim Boetsch and Rafael Natal. *A welterweight bout between former Bellator Welterweight Champion Lyman Good and Belal Muhammad was scheduled for this portion of the event. However, on October 24, Good was pulled from the card after being notified by USADA due to a potential anti-doping violation stemming from an out-of-competition sample collected ten days earlier. He was replaced by Vicente Luque. A lightweight bout between Al Iaquinta and former welterweight title challenger Thiago Alves was previously linked to UFC 202. However, the pairing was initially delayed and was expected to be contested at this event. Subsequently, Iaquinta announced on September 19 that he pulled out due to a contract dispute with the promotion. He was replaced by Jim Miller. The bout headlined the UFC Fight Pass portion of the event. To complete the card, there was a women's bantamweight bout between former title challenger Liz Carmouche and Katlyn Chookagian. A light heavyweight bout between Gian Villante and Marcos Rog√©rio de Lima was briefly linked to the event. However, Villante pulled out of the fight on September 21 citing injury and the bout was scrapped. A middleweight bout between Tim Kennedy and former UFC Light Heavyweight Champion and divisional newcomer Rashad Evans was scheduled for the FS1 portion of the event. However, on November 8, Evans was pulled from the fight after an undisclosed irregularity was found during his pre-fight medical exam. Subsequently, Kennedy was removed from the card as well. The bout is now expected to take place at UFC 206, a month later. =Weigh-ins= At the weigh-ins, Alves was over his division weight limit by six pounds, weighing in at 162.6 lb. Per New York State Athletic Commission (NYSAC) rules, opposing lightweight fighters must weigh within 7 pounds of one another. Having not yet completed his own official weigh-in, Alves' opponent Jim Miller (who was within the designated lightweight limit) was able to rehydrate and officially weigh in over the limit himself, at 157.6 lb, allowing the bout to proceed as catchweight. NYSAC and UFC officials indicated that Alves must not weigh more than 173 lb the day of the fight, or it would be cancelled. As a result of missing the original designated weight, Alves was fined 20% of his purse, which went to his opponent. Kelvin Gastelum did not appear for the official weigh-ins, announcing via Twitter that he would not fight Cerrone \\"on account that he couldn't make the weight limit\\". Prior to this announcement, Cerrone had already successfully weighed in at 170.4 lb, meaning he was unable to subsequently rehydrate as Miller did, to keep within 7 pounds of his over-weight opponent. In an interview after hearing the news, Cerrone stated he would have \\"blown weight too,\\" had Gastelum informed him prior. As a result, Gastelum was pulled from the card and UFC president Dana White stated he will never let him fight at welterweight in the organization again, and that he believes Gastelum missed weight by 10 pounds. Despite the one-day notice, it was reported a small number of fighters were interested in filling in to fight Cerrone. According to one candidate Alan Jouban, UFC matchmaker Joe Silva was interested in having him fill in, however, according to Jouban, the NYSAC would not consider sanctioning any fighters on such short notice. Consequently, the bout was scrapped. Cerrone was quickly rescheduled and faced Matt Brown the following month at UFC 206. Results Bonus awards The following fighters were awarded $50,000 bonuses: *Fight of the Night: Tyron Woodley vs. Stephen Thompson *Performance of the Night: Conor McGregor and Yoel Romero Records set The ceremonial weigh-ins set an attendance record of 15,480 spectators. The event reportedly generated $17,700,000 in gate receipts, which broke the UFC 129 record for a mixed martial arts event, as well as the record for the venue, Madison Square Garden. The attendance of 20,427 was the highest for a domestic event. The pre-fight documentary Fighting for History drew 2.4 million viewers on Fox, the most of any preview show in UFC history. The Reebok athlete outfitting pay was the highest in history, with a total of $392,500. With his win, McGregor became the first fighter in the promotion's history to hold two titles simultaneously. Aftermath On November 21, the NYSAC administratively suspended Gastelum for six months because he did not attend the weigh-ins. An administrative suspension is different from a typical commission suspension in that it does not have to be reciprocated by other jurisdictions. Despite being originally expected to value only in New York, it was announced two days later that the suspension was added to the database of the Association of Boxing Commissions (ABC) and it could be extend to other jurisdictions as well. Gastelum's team announced they would enter an appeal. Gastelum was cleared of his suspension on November 30, which allowed him to face Kennedy at UFC 206, as Evans once again was pulled from the bout. The NYSAC also issued a three- month suspension for Alves due to him missing weight, as well as a two-month suspension for Romero for leaving cage right after defeating Weidman. Romero jumped over the Octagon in adulation, did a soldier's march around the outside perimeter of the cage, and then entered back in for the official results. On November 26, due to his inactivity in the featherweight division, McGregor was stripped of the UFC Featherweight Championship, therefore promoting Jos√© Aldo to undisputed champion On April 1, 2017, it was announced that Good will receive a six-month suspension from USADA retroactive to his positive test. \\"USADA found that Lyman's October 2016 flagged urine specimen was the result of tainted vitamins and not the result of any intentional violation\\", Good‚Äôs lawyer David Fish said.

He joined the staff at Queen Mary College, University of London, lecturing in theories and applied microeconomics. He then moved to The University of York, Centre for Health Economics in January 1998 to present. Most economists probably know him as the lead author with Ray Rees, of the standard intermediate text: Microeconomics, Prentice Hall, 1981, First Edition. He started this text while at Queen Mary College as lecture notes, where he was teaching Microeconomics based on James Ferguson text. The book was intended and received as a bridge between standard and more advanced text, presenting the standard neoclassical point of view, but with a view toward General Equilibrium Analysis and Welfare Economics. In the Preface of the third edition in 2004, the authors hinted that a new edition seems warranted every eleven years of so, which one cannot avoid linking to sunspot-cycles which peaks at that interval. An application of Gravelle et al. welfare theorem is exemplified in Market Failure. Since 1998, Gravelle has published enormously in the field of Health Economics. wikipedia has highlighted one of his collaborative inputs in its entry in Pay for performance (healthcare). One of Professor Gravelle's theory of health and unemployment was discussed in a recent book by Davide Stucker and Sanjay Basu. The theory holds that sickness is not caused by unemployment but the reverse, namely, unemployment is a result of sickness. (2013, p. 187). References *Hugh Gravelle and Ray Rees. (1981).

The episode was written by showrunner Jeremy Carver and directed by executive producer Robert Singer. It was first broadcast on October 7, 2015 on The CW. In the episode, Sam and Dean have to deal with the consequence of having freed The Darkness into the world while Crowley recovers after Castiel's attack. With this episode, Supernatural became the longest-running science fiction TV show in North America, surpassing Smallville. The episode received critical acclaim, with critics praising the tone for the season and the new threat as well as the character development. Plot The season picks up exactly where it left off; Dean (Jensen Ackles) finds himself surrounded by the black smoke and finds a mysterious woman (Emily Swallow), revealed to be The Darkness. She tells him that's she's finally free, even going far as to say she didn't even know what The Death was and that they will always help each other as they're bound together. Sam (Jared Padalecki) wakes up in the Impala, where the black smoke is gone. He looks for Dean and finally discovers him in a field. They soon drive to a highway where they discover dead police and medical officers. They are being attacked by a medical officer, who's gunned down by a sheriff's deputy named Jenna Nickerson (Laci J. Mailey). She states that people began attacking each other like rabid dogs, revealing to have black veins in their necks. As she is injured, they take her to the hospital, where the administrators are also dead. Sam discovers an infected man trying to kill a person in a closet. The infected man dies and the man, is holding a newborn baby he just received when his wife died. Meanwhile, Crowley (Mark A. Sheppard) evades Castiel's (Misha Collins) attack by leaving his vessel. Castiel is also feeling guilty about his actions and is being attacked by a family of hunters where he stood the past hours. Crowley takes on a female vessel. Crowley later retains his true vessel and is notified by his employees that The Darkness has been unleashed and that everyone on Hell heard a warning coming from Lucifer's Cage. That night, Castiel prays for help as police officers are cornering him. Two angels arrive to take Castiel for custody but they instead kidnap him for torture. The infected man, Mike (Aaron Hill), states that he's infected too, but Dean speaks in private with Sam and Jenna to kill Mike before he morphs and kills them. When more infected people arrive, Sam decides to stay in the hospital to distract them while Dean and Jenna leave with the baby at Mike's request, also calling the baby Amara. Sam manages to attack the infected people but discovers he's infected too. Dean and Jenna stop in a shop, and while Jenna changes Amara's diaper, it's revealed the baby is carrying the Mark of Cain, revealing that the baby is The Darkness. Reception =Viewers= The episode was watched by 1.94 million viewers with a 0.9/3 share among adults aged 18 to 49. This was a 12% increase in viewership from the previous episode, which was watched by 1.73 million viewers; but was a 23% decrease in viewership from the previous season premiere, which was watched by 2.50 million viewers. This means that 0.9 percent of all households with televisions watched the episode, while 3 percent of all households watching television at that time watched it. Supernatural ranked as the second most watched program on The CW in the day, behind Arrow. =Critical reviews= \\"Out of the Darkness, Into the Fire\\" received universal acclaim. Amy Ratcliffe of IGN gave the episode a \\"great\\" 8.4 out of 10 and wrote in her verdict, \\"The stakes seem to get bigger with every season of Supernatural, and they've effectively raised them with The Darkness. The Winchesters need to get back to their core mission of saving people, and this is already set up as the big bad that could unite them ‚Äì but they ruined some of what they set up by having Sam hide something from Dean. The episode didn't pack quite the punch it could have, but it did a fine job of setting the stage and showing us that the Winchesters might be going back to their roots.\\" Hunter Bishop of TV Overmind, wrote, \\"The brothers have to change, and they have to change now. I suspect they'll defeat The Darkness, or at least corral it; they are, after all, the closest things to real superheroes as you'll ever find. But if they are faced with the choice of living a life without the other, and letting the world burn, they have to choose the former. For the show's sake, for the people on it, and for the audience that has devoted 11 years to it, the Winchesters have to change. Or else all these bodies, and all this blood, and all of those broken homes mean nothing. Let's hope Sam and Dean learn that sooner rather than later, and end the story as the heroes, instead of the ones who destroyed everything.\\" Samantha Highfill of EW stated: \\"Welcome back, everyone! Yes, I'm welcoming you back to a world that's covered in literal darkness and where Sam has once again found a way to put his life in danger ‚Äî but still, feels kind of good, right? Overall, this hour reminded me a lot of the apocalypse days, or even the Croatoan virus ‚Äî the deserted town, the infected individuals, the general sense of death and destruction. So let's break down what happened this week, or as I like to call it: The Winchester Boys and the Case of the Mysterious Darkness.\\" Sean McKenna from TV Fanatic, gave a 4.4 star rating out of 5, stating: \\"Overall, this was an engaging episode that did a good job of focusing on the brothers and setting up what feels like a compelling new direction with the Darkness. I know it's early, and Supernatural usually does premieres well, but I can't help but be excited to get back on the road with Sam and Dean.\\" MaryAnn Sleasman of TV.com wrote, \\"I'm so happy, you guys. Hellatus was long and cold and sad. It was fraught with worry and doubt‚Äîwhat if Supernatural returned and it was terrible? Don't lie, you know it to be true. The utter disappointment that was 'Exile on Main Street' still stings when I think about it. The Js and the writers and Jeremy Carver himself have been saying all summer long that Season 11 will herald a return to basics for Dean and Sam. I wasn't sure how to take this news initially. After all, the Winchesters have evolved too far to simply go back to the good old days of prank wars and credit card fraud.\\" References Category:Supernatural (season 11) episodes Category:2015 American television episodes ","title":"Out of the Darkness, Into the Fire"},{"id":"50527724","text":"Boolarra virus (BoV) is a member of the family Nodaviridae. It was named after Boolarra, Victoria where it was first discovered after infecting and killing or severely debilitating a pest larvae. As of now, the only know host for Boolarra virus is the Oncopera intricoides which a moth that is endemic to Victoria (Australia).  History and discovery  In the winter of 1977, an outbreak of Oncopera intricoides prompted examination of the insect and its habits. While examining the pest, many dead and terminal larvae were found. After looking closely to discover the cause these insects' ailment, researchers were unable to find any traces of bacteria, fungi, or protozoa that could have contributed to the insects' death. After further examination, the researchers found viral particles that were found to be members of the Nodaviridae. After comparing the RNA genome of this virus with that of other members of the Nodaviridae, it was found to be different and therefore a new member of the Nodaviridae. After this discovery, the virus was named after the place where the infected Oncopera intricoides were found; Boolarra, Victoria.  Physical data  Boolarra virus typically measures around 30 nano-meters and is approximately 21 percent RNA. Boolarra virus is characterized by its polyhedral shape. The virus only shares a significant portion of the same amino acid sequence with the Nodamura virus, which is a similar Nodavirus. Among other Nodoviruses, Boolarra was not very similar concerning amino acid sequences. Still a very rare virus, Boolarra virus can only be found in a very small population of moths that is endemic to the region of Victoria, Australia. While only found within this small population, the virus causes severe harm to occur to infected larvae and can even cause death.

There is no newspaper report of that match, nor any further mention of South United, in either the Times, The Brisbane Courier, Truth or The Telegraph. The four remaining teams played on September 9 and 16. Valley-Toombul won both their matches. Ipswich B and South Brisbane each had one win. Ipswich A lost both. On September 23, Valley- Toombul met Ipswich B in, \\"the final match of the second round of the Queensland Rugby League's fixtures.\\" Scoreless at half-time, Valley-Toombul triumphed 13 to nil as, \\"The soaked and mud-bespattered players worked with a will along most unorthodox lines, providing fun and plenty for the onlookers, by their scrambles and slips in the mud and splashes in the pools.\\" In sunnier conditions the following Saturday, September 30, Valley-Toombul again met Ipswich B at the 'Gabba. Playing in their maroon and white strip, Ipswich B had a try disallowed early in the match. Later they kicked a goal from a mark. Under the rules of the time, a mark could be claimed when an opponent's kick was caught. At half-time, Ipswich B led two-nil. Superior skills in the scrums secured the Valley-Toombul navy blues a larger share of possession, and they scored three second half tries to win, 13 to 2, and claim the premiership. At the QRFL Annual Meeting in April 1912, it was reported that Valley-Toombul played 11 matches for 9 wins, a draw and one loss. =Junior Grades= Three junior competitions were held, First Grade, Second Grade and Third Grade. Matches began on May 13, although Third Grade may have started one week later. Whilst results of some junior matches were published in the newspapers most weeks, reporting on these matches was inconsistent. Venues used for junior matches included the Brisbane Cricket Ground (as a curtain- raiser to a senior game), Albert Park, Albion Flats, Balmoral, Bulimba, Kelvin Grove, Land's Paddock, Paddington Reserve, Toombul, Toowong and West End Reserve. Teams in the Junior First Grade competition included Kelvin Gordon, North Brisbane, South Brisbane A, South Brisbane B, St Bridget's, Toowong and Valley. First Grade Semi-finals were played on September 9, with Toowong beating South Brisbane A and St. Bridget's defeating the team \\"leading on points after the second round\\", South Brisbane B. On the 16th, St. Bridget's beat Toowong. In a match advertised as a \\"Junior Challenge Final\\", South Brisbane B defeated St. Bridget's 12 to nil to claim the premiership. Their record was 10 wins and 3 losses from 13 matches. The Junior Second Grade competition comprised at least four teams: Mildura, St. Bridget‚Äôs, Toombul and Violet. In semi-finals held on September 9, Mildura defeated St. Bridget's 18-nil and Toombul 22 beat Violet 9. The result of a final, played on the 16th, was a win to Toombul by 19 points to Mildura's 5. Premiers Toombul were undefeated in their 12 matches. The Junior Third Grade competition comprised at least six teams: Britannia, North Brisbane, South Brisbane A, South Brisbane B, Toombul and Toowong. North Brisbane defeated Toombul in a final on September 9. However, \\"By virtue of being ahead in points on the second round, the Toombul club hold the right to challenge.\\" In the second final on the following Saturday, Toombul won, but North Brisbane lodged a protest. This must have been dismissed, as Toombul were named as Junior Third Grade premiers in a report given at the QRFL Annual Meeting in April 1912. Toombul's record was 12 matches, 10 wins, 1 drawn, 1 loss. Runner's up North Brisbane played 12 matches for 8 wins, 2 draws and 2 losses. =Ipswich= Ipswich began the season with the intention of holding a local senior competition as well as two lower grades. Only two of the five clubs that had participated in the 1910 Ipswich Senior premiership nominated for 1911. One senior match was held on May 13, between Belvideres and Starlights, but both sides needed to call upon junior players. At a delegates meeting of the Ipswich Amateur Rugby League on the following Monday, May 15, there was agreement that a second Ipswich team be entered into the QARL senior competition. Senior players not required for either Ipswich team were permitted to play for their junior club. The two lower grade premiership competitions in Ipswich saw teams join after they commenced and teams withdraw before the season ended. The competitions were also disrupted by forfeits, at a rough average of one per week. Nine teams competed in what was initially called the Junior competition, but later was known as B Grade. Starlight B were the premiers, winning gold medals and a cup presented by the publican of the Commonwealth Hotel, Mr. W. Hartigan. The nine teams were Belvideres, Blackstone, Harrisville (late entry), Montes (also known as Silkstone), St Paul‚Äôs, Starlights A, Starlights B, Western Suburbs A and Western Suburbs B (withdrew). The teams that finished second to fifth were invited to compete for a cup donated by the publican of the North Australian Hotel, Mr. Jack Lindsay. This was played as a knock-out in September. On the 16th, St. Paul's defeated Blackstone but Harrisville forfeited to the Belvideres. The following Saturday, Belvideres defeated St. Paul's to claim the Lindsay Cup. The minor competition, also referred to as C Grade, was for Under 18 players. The competition began on May 6 with three teams, Belvideres, Starlights and Western Suburbs. They were joined by the Catholic Young Men‚Äôs Society (CYMS) on June 3, Silkstone and St. Paul‚Äôs on June 17 and Blackstone on July 14. Belvideres won the premiership without a final being played. =Maryborough= For the second year, Rugby League competitions were held in Maryborough. All three grades commenced on May 6. Four teams entered the senior competition. Howard left to play in a Burrum district competition. Christian Brothers switched from Rugby Union to join Glebe, Natives and Wallaroos. Seven teams competed in the Junior grade. Wallaroos were premiers, finishing one point ahead of Natives. They were followed by Glebe, Granville, Past Grammars, Present Grammars and Pialba. Three teams competed in the Third grade. Wallaroos were premiers, ahead of Glebe and Natives. Representative Season =New South Wales= In early June, a representative Queensland team travelled to Sydney to play three matches in eight days against New South Wales. They were defeated by large margins in each encounter: 65 to 9 on the 3rd, 49 to nil on the 7th and 32 to 8 on June 10. =New Zealand= In June and July a New Zealand team toured Australia, playing against New South Wales, Newcastle and Queensland, although they did not play against an Australian team. Queensland won the second of three matches. =Northern Districts= A team billed in the newspapers as New South Wales, but composed of players from the Newcastle and Maitland competitions, visited Brisbane in August. =Players= Forty-five players represented Queensland in the nine matches played in 1911.

Launched to the public on January 18, 2016 by the bank's full- service investment firm, BMO Nesbitt Burns, it was the first digital portfolio management service offered by a big five Canadian bank. BMO SmartFolio was developed in-house to appeal to the growing number of investors looking for investment management alternatives to traditional brokerages. As of December 18, 2017, the minimum amount required to open a BMO SmartFolio account is $1,000, reduced from the $5,000 minimum amount set when the service was originally launched. Account fees are calculated at 0.7 per cent for the first $100,000 invested then are reduced as the account size increases, to 0.4 per cent on assets over $500,000. The service offers clients the option of holding their investment in TFSA (Tax-Free Savings Account), RRSP (Registered Retirement Savings Plan), RESP (Registered Education Savings Account), RRIF (Registered Retirement Income Fund), as well as non-registered and joint investment accounts. Investment industry disruption Following the financial crisis of 2007-2008, new financial technology startups began offering digital investment management services, or robo-advisors, to meet consumer demands for technology-based solutions to lower the costs of investing. While these online investment management services are most common in the United States, a number are available in Canada, Europe, Australia, India and Asia. While similar to a robo-advisor service, where investors sign- up online and have digital access to their investment holdings and performance tracking, BMO SmartFolio differs from its peers in the U.S. and UK, in that the portfolios are monitored and managed by a portfolio management group, as opposed to a computer algorithm.

Governor Bligh, Marc Clark Marc Clark MA (R.C.A, Lon A.R.C.A.) R.B.A. (born 20 October 1923) is an English born Australian sculptor and print maker.  Life  Marc Clark was born in London in 1923. At 14 he enrolled into the Sydney Cooper School of Art in Canterbury where he studied for four years. World war two interrupted Clark's studies during which he served with the 9th Queens' Royal Lancers in North Africa, Sicily, Italy and Austria. After Military Service in 1947 Clark enrolled as a student at the Royal College of Art (RCA) 1948‚Äì1951. He was given a travelling Scholarship from the RCA 1951‚Äì1952 which he spent in France.  Teaching  After graduation Clark lectured at the Watford College of the Arts, UK, from 1953 to 1962. His first teaching appointment in Australia was with the Caulfield Institute of Technology where he taught basic design. After six months he was appointed Master of Drawing at the National Gallery of Victoria Art School which was later to become the Victorian College of Arts. There, Clark introduced Clay Portraiture and lectured in Human Anatomy. At the time all students were majoring in painting only. The Head of the School was initially John Brack. When the School relocated to its St Kilda Road premises, and was renamed the \\"Victorian College of the Arts\\", the Dean was Lenton Parr. Clark was appointed Senior Lecturer in charge of the newly formed Sculpture School that was incorporated into the new College. He often acted as Dean of the Art School. He retired from the College in 1984 and moved to Queensland but continued as a Visiting Lecturer at Dandenong TAFE, Melbourne University, Hervey Bay Senior College, in Queensland and Deakin University over various periods up until 2007.  Work  \\"A major preoccupation with his art has been with the notion of timelessness, an art which more that commemorate an individual person's ego or freeze an historical event in time .\\" Dr. Sasha Grishin. After graduation Clark produced numerous sculptures in the United Kingdom, including author Peter Cheyney's hands and a death mask of the Welsh painter Evan Walters. He has contributed to monumental works in Australian parks and gardens. These include Sculpture of Captain James Cook, now located at Cooks' Cottage within Fitzroy Gardens in Melbourne, Victoria. In 1971 he was commissioned by the Tongan Government to provide a statue of Queen SƒÅlote Tupou III. This is located at Nuku‚Äôalofa, Tonga. In 1983 Clark contributed a cast of the 'Eternal Flame' to the Rats of Tobruk Memorial located in Canberra. Edmund Barton located at Barton House, in Australia's capital city Canberra, was the next major work completed by Clark in 1981. In 1985‚Äì87 he was commissioned to provide three bronze sculptures. The first was Matthew Flinders, R.N., which is located at Mornington Park, Mornington, Victoria, Captain William Bligh R.N., at Cadmans Cottage, Sydney, NSW, and a sculpture of Baron Sir Ferdinand von Mueller located within the Botanical Gardens, Melbourne. Clark has made significant contributions to the Australian Federal Parliament House Art Collection. His works in the collection include 'Alpha and Omega', 'Ancient Sites' and 'Monument to a Hero II '. \\"Marc Clark is widely acknowledged to be a very accomplished and versatile sculptor who has created with equal assurance a succession of commissioned memorial works on a monumental scale and a large number of other sculptures more personally conceived and motivated by his own powers of observation and invention.\\"Lenton Parr AO Clark's abstract works form a human relationship to figurative expression through the portrayal of personal and human elements in geometrical forms. The bronze sculpture Stairway to Nowhere (Now in Queensland Art gallery collection) represents his own experience of the result of bombing in WW2 where functional buildings were transformed into symbols of futility. (Dr Sasha Grishin)  Personal life  Clark married his wife Waltraud in Melbourne, Australia in 1983.

A row of gin cases on a rural property was a sign that bee-farming was in progress as they were frequently used as bee hives. Bee-keeping remained largely a part-time activity for farmers and people living on the outskirts of towns and cities till dedicated full-time beekeepers began to emerge. The British author Anthony Trollope (1815-1882) visited Australia in 1871 and commented on the popularity of honey as a favourite food. The South Australian Beekeepers Society was established in 1884 and a beekeepers association was founded in Victoria in 1886.The South Australian Advertiser, 3 October 1884, p.9 The Victorian Apiarists Association started in 1900.Bolton (1976), p.296 In February 1903, Victorian bee-farmer Thomas Bolton (1863-1928) questioned the wisdom of clearing the forest in the Dunkeld area of the Western District.

The land was being cleared to create grazing pastures for sheep which he claimed annually returned just ¬£80 per square mile.\\"The Beekeper - Forest Destruction,\\" The Australasian (Melbourne), 21 February 1903, p.10 Bolton sent a test shipment of honey to China early in the 20th century. ‚ÄúThe ships company thought so highly of his honey that empty cases were they only part of the consignment left when the ship reached port.‚ÄùBolton (1976), p.299 In 1921-22, Australia produced 7,370,790 pounds weight of honey.The Illustrated Australian Encyclopaedia, vol 1, (1925) Sydney, Angus & Robertson, p.148 Honey exports that year were worth ¬£84,417. Beeswax was also exported. Drawbacks to beekeeping in Australia include bushfires, frequent droughts and the tendency for beeswax to melt during very hot conditions. The distance from export markets is another issue. The export of honey may have started in 1845 when an experimental shipment of honey and honeycomb was shipped from New South Wales to Britain in wooden casks.‚ÄúThe Honey Trade,‚Äù Maitland Mercury and Hunter River General Advertiser, 29 August 1846, p.2 The production of honey and bees-wax fluctuates greatly and is determined by the flow of nectar from flora, particularly from the eucalypts, which varies greatly from year to year.

About 70% of Australian honey comes from nectar from native plants. Demand for pollination services for almonds and other crops is growing. Bee-brokers co-ordinate bee-keepers for pollination services to crops, such as almonds. The species most commonly used for bee keeping in Australia are European bees (Apis mellifera).

The purity, taste and variety of Australian honey makes it popular in Asia and elsewhere.

In performance it lasts about 5 minutes. The work demonstrates Satie's attempts to reconcile the linear contrapuntal style he had acquired through his recent studies at the Schola Cantorum in Paris with his natural sense of wit and fantasy. It was to have been the first of his series of \\"humoristic\\" piano suites (1912-1915), but the composer withdrew the score after it was rejected for publication. He then wrote a second set of pieces on the same theme, the Veritables Preludes flasques (pour un chien) (1912), which proved a breakthrough in Satie's career and creative development.John Williamson, \\"Words and Music\\", Liverpool University Press, 2005, p. 173. The original Pr√©ludes flasques were presumed lost for decades and would not see print until 1967.See IMSLP score at http://imslp.org/wiki/Pr%C3%A9ludes_flasques_(pour_un_chien)_(Satie,_Erik) History Satie was never a pet-owner, but his fondness for dogs is well known.Steven Moore Whiting, \\"Satie the Bohemian: From Cabaret to Concert Hall\\", Oxford University Press, 1999, p. 358. Stray mongrels he occasionally fed and sheltered were the only visitors he allowed inside his one-room Arcueil apartment during the 27 years he lived there.Caroline Potter, \\"Erik Satie: A Parisian Composer and His World\\", Boydell & Brewer, 2016, p. 116. And among the random jottings in his composition notebooks can be found Blaise Pascal's famous quote, \\"The more I see of Mankind, the more I prefer my dog.\\"Whiting, \\"Satie the Bohemian\\", p. 358. As early as 1907 he considered calling the second movement of his Nouvelles pi√®ces froides a Suite pour un chien (\\"Suite for a Dog\\").Robert Orledge, \\"Satie the Composer\\", Cambridge University Press, 1990, p. 291. Independent Satie scholar Ornella Volta believed the composer was inspired to dedicate a piece of music to a canine by one of his favorite books, Gargantua and Pantagruel by Fran√ßois Rabelais.Ornella Volta, \\"A Mammal's Notebook: The Writings of Erik Satie\\", Atlas Publishing, London, 1996 (reissued 2014), pp. 187-188. In the preface to Gargantua, Rabelais paraphrased the ancient philosopher Socrates to urge readers to look beyond the \\"curious\\" titles of written works and explore their contents, just as a dog chews an unappetizing-looking bone to extract the marrow.Rabelais quotes from the same passage of Plato's Symposium that Satie would set to music in his cantata Socrate (1918). See Volta, \\"A Mammal's Notebook\\", pp. 187-188. The idea stayed with Satie long after he had completed his sets of preludes pour un chien. He would later tell author Jean Cocteau, \\"I want to write a play for dogs, and I already have my set design: the curtain rises on a bone.\\"Ornella Volta, \\"Give a Dog a Bone: Some investigations into Erik Satie.\\" Originally published as \\"Le rideau se leve sur un os\\" in the Revue International de la Musique Fran√ßaise, Vol. 8, No. 23, 1987.

Retrieved from Niclas Fogwall's defunct Satie Homepage (1996-2014) through the Internet Archive Wayback Machine at https://web.archive.org/web/20041014172728/http://www.af.lu.se/~fogwall/articl10.html#sports07r.Dogs would also make whimsical appearances in the extramusical texts of Satie's piano suites Peccadilles importunes (1913) and Sports et divertissements (1914, in the piece Le R√©veil de la Mari√©e). The first three of the Pr√©ludes flasques (pour un chien) were completed in Paris between July 11 and July 23, 1912; the fourth was finished by the end of the month. Satie informed his friend Claude Debussy he was going to name the concluding piece Sous la futaille (\\"Bottom of the Barrel\\"), a title Debussy found so offensive that Satie changed it to Avec camaraderie (\\"With Friendship\\").Orledge, \\"Satie the Composer\\", p. 296. He may already have been dissatisfied with the work as it stood. After the publisher Durand rejected the score in the first week of August, Satie told his prot√©g√© Alexis Roland-Manuel, \\"I am going to destroy the Pr√©ludes flasques, and begin anew.\\"Erik Satie, letter to Alexis Roland- Manuel dated August 8, 1912. Quoted in Alan M. Gillmor, \\"Erik Satie\\", Twayne Publishers, Boston, 1988, p. 146. He followed through on the second part of this statement with the V√©ritables pr√©ludes flasques (pour un chien), which he completed by August 23 and successfully sold to Demets in September. In his 1948 biography of Satie, Rollo H. Myers cited Roland-Manuel when he wrote, \\"It is perhaps not generally known that Satie destroyed the original version of the Pr√©ludes flasques...and re-wrote them under the title, which they now bear, of V√©ritables pr√©ludes flasques.\\"Rollo H. Myers, \\"Erik Satie\\", Dover Publications, Inc., NY, 1968, p. 78. Originally published in 1948 by Denis Dobson Ltd., London. In reality Satie was not inclined to dispose of his manuscripts, regardless of what he told Roland-Manuel, and a wealth of unpublished material was retrieved from his squalid flat after his death. Robert Caby discovered the autograph of the Pr√©ludes flasques among the composer's papers at the Biblioth√®que nationale de France, and edited it for publication by Max Eschig in 1967. The first recording was by pianist Aldo Ciccolini in 1968 (Angel Records). Music The Pr√©ludes flasques consist of four pieces: :1. Voix d'int√©rieur (Voices Within) :2. Idylle cynique (Cynical Idyll) :3. Chanson canine (Canine Song) :4. Avec camaraderie (With Camaraderie) There is nothing \\"flabby\\" about these preludes, which are lean, dry, and sharply contrapuntal. The harmonies are occasionally bitonal. They were written with conventional bar lines and time signatures, though Satie might have removed them at the proof stage (as he would in his later piano music) had they been accepted for publication.Orledge, \\"Satie the Composer\\", p. 222. The first two pieces are pensive in mood. Stomping dissonances invade and finish off the lively Chanson canine; a whiff of the music hall can be detected in Avec camaraderie, with its dancelike rhythms and popular-sounding main theme. Apart from some of the titles there are no overt attempts at humor. The primary difference between this abandoned set and the subsequent humoristic piano suites is its four-part structure. Beginning with the V√©ritables pr√©ludes flasques Satie would revert to his old \\"trinitarian obsession\\" (evident from such early works as the Sarabandes and Gymnop√©dies) and construct his piano music in groups of three.Alexander Carpenter, Allmusic review at http://www.allmusic.com/composition/pr%C3%A9ludes-flasques-pour-un- chien-flabby-preludes-for-a-dog-for-piano-mc0002363035%3C Other posthumous Pr√©ludes Satie's 1912 notebooks pertaining to the Pr√©ludes flasques yielded four additional preludes, two of them grouped under the title Deux Pr√©ludes pour un chien. Robert Caby edited No. 2 of the latter set and published it as Pr√©lude canin, No. 4 of his posthumous Satie collection Six Pi√®ces de la p√©riode 1906-1913 (Salabert, 1968). The two unnamed preludes were also edited by Caby and published under his own title, Deux R√™veries nocturnes (Salabert, 1968).Orledge, \\"Satie the Composer\\", pp. 295-296.

Melanie is optimistic about her new life but she is quickly demoralized by her difficulty making friends in the new city and by the unruly students she can't control. After a student throws chocolate milk on her, Melanie tries to discipline him by talking to his mother, but after his mother dismisses the incident, Melanie covers it up. Melanie manages to befriend Tina, a salesgirl who sells her a jacket and who happens to live in the same tenement building as she does. After Tina visits Melanie in her apartment, the two get drunk and, realizing that Tina's apartment is viewable from Melanie's apartment, they end up spying on Tina's ex, Tobias, as he enters the apartment. Melanie continues to pursue Tina's friendship, but things quickly become awkward as Melanie spies on Tina from her apartment and goes out of her way to chase down Tina. At school, things take a turn for the worse when Melanie overhears two colleagues discussing her and how she lets the children run wild. Upset, Melanie calls her mother, but rather than worry her, ends up cancelling her planned trip home to stay in Karlsruhe over vacation. She spends her vacation alone, spying on Tina as she goes out with her other friends. As the new term begins, Melanie continues to have problems at school and with Tina. She is relieved when Tina invites her to her birthday party; however, she bumps into Tobias outside and, introducing herself, tells him it would be better if he didn't come inside. Tobias then gives her flowers to deliver to Tina. When Tina realizes that Melanie told Tobias not to come up, she tells her to leave. Melanie's attempts to reconnect with Tina fail and while spying on Tina from her window, she spots Tobias and Tina peering back at her and appearing to make fun of her. Upset, Melanie begins to miss work obligations, skipping parent-teacher night. The following day she leaves class in the middle of the day, gets in her car and begins to drive. As she drives, she lets go of the wheel and climbs into the back seat where she calmly surveys the scenery. Film development The film was Ade's thesis film for film school. Ade based the movie on stories her parents, who both were teachers, had told her. Awards In 2005, The Forest for the Trees won the top award at three international film festivals: the Indie Lisboa Festival (in Portugal), the Newport Film Festival, and the Valencia Golden Jove Film Festival.

Chang is one of the most successful and highly regarded contemporary watercolourist in Southeast Asia. A self-taught artist, he began his career in the early 1980s. He started his international travels in the early 1980s ‚Äî to Nepal, India, Indochina ‚Äî spending about two months on a trip. While his travelling and painting seemed intertwined, for him, travelling is not only for painting's sake. He said: \\"Throughout the journey, the things you see, the people you meet, even the air you smell can give you so much enjoyment. I don't count how many paintings I can do every trip ‚Äî this way, the travel is full of potential and surprises.\\" In the 1990s, he used to spend four months a year in Bali (where he has a studio), as he found that the island gave him good \\"chi\\" to paint. However, his favourite place to visit is the East Coast of Peninsular Malaysia, from Eastern Johor all the way to the end of Kelantan, where he is most happy as he knows the region well, and feels strongly connected to its people and culture, making it easy for him to paint the subjects related to the area. Asked about his choice of watercolour as his medium for painting, he said: \\"It all began as a practical choice as it is non-cumbersome and easy to pack and use, and also odourless and easy to clean. But artistically, I was moved by the works of Malaysian East Coast watercolour painters such as the late Mat Zain and the great Khalil Ibrahim. Their watercolour paintings seem to capture the tones and moods of the region so well, convincing me that it was the medium to use for these subjects.\\" Despite his many travels to Indonesia for the past 30 years, it remains a favourite travel destination. His dream is to complete a thematic body of work for an exhibition called \\"Taman Mini Indonesia\\", to show his sketches and drawings on envelops as a documentary of this beautiful multi-cultural country. He is currently in Singapore (May 2016) to hold an exhibition called \\"A Traveller's Diary\\".

The property is owned by Great Wash Park LLC. The project was announced in May 2005, as The Village at Queensridge. Work began on the project in 2006, but its opening was delayed numerous times because of poor economic conditions, which prompted the decision to develop the property in separate phases. The property opened its first phase in April 2011. Work on a second phase had begun by May 2010, with an opening initially planned for 2012. The opening of the second phase was delayed several times. Construction of the second phase began in October 2013, and the opening occurred in October 2016. Additional phases have been considered since 2010, with possible amenities including condominiums and a small hotel. History The project was initially announced on May 24, 2005, as The Village at Queensridge, a $500 million mixed-use project to be developed by Peccole Nevada Corporation and the Las Vegas-based Executive Home Builders (EHB). The project would be developed near the Las Vegas community of Summerlin on of land, at the northeast corner of Rampart Boulevard and Alta Drive, near the Suncoast Hotel and Casino, the Angel Park golf course, and the developers' One Queensridge Place high-rise condominium project. The project would feature of boutique retail stores, movie theaters, restaurants, and executive office space. Restaurant space would take up of the project. The property would also include two five-story condominium towers and a 10-story tower with a total of 340 units, priced from the $600,000 range to over $1 million. The condominium towers were expected to begin construction within 90 days, with a projected opening in 2007. Frank Pankratz, president of Executive Home Builders, wanted the project to portray the elegance and quality of the company's other projects throughout the Las Vegas Valley: \\"We're big into stonework and granite. You can see the fit and finishes here are the same as what we'll be incorporating into our tower, One Queensridge Place.\\" The project would be accessible from Rampart Boulevard and from Alta Drive, and would include an underground parking garage with 3,500 parking spaces, to be built in what was once a wash, which created difficult topography for the project that required the excavation of 1.1 million cubic yards of dirt to accommodate the garage. A 12-foot-by-25-foot culvert was to be added underground to divert floodwater from the property. The garage would contain a series of elevators and escalators to help patrons easily navigate the property. In November 2005, IDB Development Corporation joined the project as an investment partner. Because of rising construction costs and design changes of the condominium towers, the project's cost increased to an estimated $750 million in 2006, when grading and infrastructure work began. The culvert cost $5 million, and was nearly complete in September 2006, as the property was being prepared for the next phase of work. Construction was underway as of August 2007. By September 2007, the project was to include 18 buildings, some as high as 10 stories. As of April 2008, the underground parking garage was under construction, while a foundation had been completed for one of the project's 18 buildings. The parking garage required a 35-foot mass excavation, at a cost of $5 million. More than a year was spent constructing the parking garage. Australian company Village Roadshow planned to build the movie theater, which would feature eight screens at a total of . Approximately 170 construction workers were on the property daily; the number was expected to increase to over 1,000 workers during the project's busiest construction period. The project, at that time, was expected to cost $850 million, and was scheduled to open in spring 2009. Tivoli Village during construction, April 2011 By May 2008, the project had been renamed as Tivoli Village at Queensridge. In August 2008, the project was expected to open in fall 2009. At that time, 70 percent of the project's space had been leased or was in the process of being leased to tenants. In September 2008, the developers announced that construction would continue despite a declining economy, with the project on track for a 2009 opening. In December 2008, Tivoli Village's developers and tenants reached a consensus that the project's opening be delayed to spring 2010, due to poor economic conditions, although construction was to continue at a slower pace. During the 2008 recession, the developers chose to construct Tivoli Village in phases. Buildings at Tivoli Village In June 2009, Tivoli Village was expected to open in fall 2010. In November 2009, full-scale construction resumed with a planned opening around December 2010. The first phase of Tivoli Village was initially set to include of office space and for retail, entertainment, and restaurants; this number was reduced to for office space and for all other businesses, for a total of . In May 2010, Tivoli Village planned to open its first phase in March 2011, with 40 to 50 retailers and approximately eight restaurants, including a pizzeria by actor Joe Pesci. It was also announced that the project's 340 condominium units had been placed on indefinite hold. In July 2010, a local law firm signed on as the project's first office tenant. By November 2010, Merrill Lynch had signed up as an office tenant of Tivoli Village, which was nearing completion. In March 2011, the project's soft opening had been delayed to April 28, 2011, while a grand opening was planned for September 2011. Only 15 retailers and three or four restaurants were expected during the soft opening; while the building exteriors were nearly finished, the interiors were not. Tivoli Village opened on April 28, 2011, with 15 retailers and three restaurants, only about half of the first phase's retailers. Tivoli Village was expected to ultimately include 30 or 40 retail stores, after the completion of its first phase in the winter. Leases had been finalized for 72 percent of the property's retail space and 55 percent of its office space. Tivoli Village was built at a cost of $700 million, and was the first new, large-scale retail project to open in Las Vegas since Town Square in 2007. With Tivoli Village, the developers wanted to create a \\"city within a city.\\" Tivoli Village was designed to resemble a 1400s European village, and was named after Italy's Tivoli Fountains. The project contained of retail space and of office space. The project's condo units were still in consideration at that time. =Second phase= In May 2010, it was announced that work had begun on the project's second phase, which would bring the project's total square-footage to 700,000 upon its completion in 2012. In December 2010, the second phase with of entertainment and retail space, as well as a movie theater was scheduled to open by late 2012. At the time of Tivoli Village's opening in April 2011, its second phase was expected to be finished by the end of 2012, and would double the project's size. In January 2012, the second phase was expected to be finished by December 2013. Construction on the second phase began in October 2013, with a projected opening in spring 2015. The second phase would include an underground garage and would add , with consisting of retailers and restaurants and consisting of office space. Phase three, planned for the northern side of the project, was set to include approximately 300 condominiums in multiple six-story buildings. In April 2014, the second phase was 45 percent complete and expected to open by December 2015. By November 2014, the second phase's cost had increased by approximately $200 million, to more than $500 million, with an expected opening in winter 2015 or spring 2016. By January 2015, Executive Home Builders was no longer a part of the project's future development. IDB had also relinquished half of Tivoli's financing because of major investment losses. However, phase two continued construction and was on track to open in late 2015 or early 2016. In May 2016, it was announced that the second phase would open in October 2016. During construction of the second phase in August 2016, a construction worker died from a fall after a scaffolding collapsed. Construction was halted to allow for a safety investigation to take place. After years of sporadic construction due to unexpected economic circumstances, the second phase opened on October 28, 2016, with approximately . The second phase included a new entrance on Rampart Boulevard and an additional 1,000 parking spaces in the underground garage. The second phase's anchor store was Restoration Hardware, which opened RH Las Vegas-The Gallery at Tivoli Village, located in a , four-level building. It was the largest gallery built by Restoration Hardware up to that point. =Future expansions= In December 2010, plans were announced for a third and fourth phase. The third phase would add approximately of retail and office space. The fourth phase would consist of 342 condominium units located in three buildings. In April 2011, the third phase was expected to be finished by the end of 2013. In January 2012, the third phase consisting of residential development at the time was no longer being considered. During construction of the second phase in April 2014, discussions were held with potential operators for a seven-story, 150-room boutique hotel that could be part of the third phase, which was to start construction in 2015 and be completed by the following year. The third phase would also include of retail space and 300 condominium units located in three five-story buildings, with sales prices exceeding $400,000. The second and third phases were estimated to cost a combined total of $600 million. Plans for a 138-room hotel remained intact as of January 2015. At the time, Tivoli Village was ultimately expected to extend to its northern border with Angel Park Golf Course, with phase three of construction. The third phase, at that point, had a possible opening date of 2017, with the project's condominiums being planned as part of the third phase. In October 2016, the third phase was expected to occur in subsequent years, on property north of the Restoration Hardware store. Elysian at Tivoli Elysian at Tivoli is an apartment complex under construction on land across from Tivoli Village. Originally, the site was intended for an indoor shopping mall that was also being planned by EHB and IBD. In October 2010, the companies paid $11.75 million for the 23-acre site, located directly south of Tivoli Village, separated by Alta Drive. The developers announced plans in April 2011 for Las Vegas Renaissance, to be built on the land. The project would include a indoor shopping mall as well as 100 condominium-type units. The mall would include 50 stores and would connect to Tivoli Village through a pedestrian bridge that would extend over Alta Drive. The project was expected to open in 2015. Las Vegas Renaissance would blend with the Italian aesthetic of Tivoli Village, and would be inspired by the Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II mall in Italy. By November 2014, construction had yet to begin on the project due to legal issues with the former land owners. Following EHB's exit from the Tivoli Village project, the plans for Las Vegas Renaissance were also cancelled. In 2017, plans were approved by a separate company, The Calida Group, to build apartments on the property previously intended for Las Vegas Renaissance. The start of construction was delayed due to the slow process of receiving project permits. Groundbreaking on the apartments, called Elysian at Tivoli, began around June 2019. The 359-unit complex occupies 15.6 acres. The project is expected to be complete by 2021.

In this case, the sign forbids them on Stearns Wharf in Santa Barbara, California. pumps/court shoes with stiletto heels A high heel policy is a regulation or law about the wearing of high heels, which may be required or forbidden in different places and circumstances. Historically, high heels were used by aristocratic women for cosmetic reasons, to raise their height or to keep their feet and long dresses clean. The style was then subject to sumptuary laws. In more modern times, stiletto heels have been restricted when they might damage the floor surface or cause accidents. Some dress codes, however, require women to wear high heels so that they appear to be taller and more attractive. Such footwear may be painful and damage the feet, and there have been repeated protests by women workers against such policies. In 2016, a British receptionist was dismissed for not wearing high heels and she then started a petition which attracted sufficient support to be considered by the UK Parliament.  Regulations preventing the wearing of high heels  =In history= In 1430, chopines were high, at times. Venetian law then limited the height to three inches‚Äîbut this regulation was widely ignored. A 17th- century law in Massachusetts announced that women would be subjected to the same treatment as witches if they lured men into marriage via the use of high- heeled shoes. In 1770, an act was introduced into the British parliament which would have applied the same penalties as witchcraft to the use of high heels and other cosmetic devices. =Floor surface concerns= The pressure under a stiletto heel is greater (per unit of the very small area) than that under the feet of an elephant. Thus, as the very narrow stiletto heel became more widespread in the 1950s, the owners of many types of buildings became concerned about the effects of large numbers of such heels on their floors, especially in historic and high-traffic public buildings. Specifically, there was concern that the heels would either damage certain types of floor covering or cause minor accidents through heels getting jammed in floor-grills, the gaps in planking, or uneven surfaces. Soft outdoor ground also caused problems, affecting both the surface and the wearer. Wood flooring was the most vulnerable, but carpets, linoleum, and mosaic floors were also considered at risk of damage. Signs were frequently posted attempting to ban stiletto heels, though they were generally ineffective. A 1963 article in a US building maintenance magazine stated, \\"Replacement of floors is estimated to have cost at least half a billion dollars throughout the country since the advent of the stiletto heel fashion.\\"Modern Sanitation and Building Maintenance, Volume 15, 1963 The U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service claimed in 1963 that \\"with style changes the stiletto-heel problem has diminished\\".United States Department of Agriculture Forest Service, research note, Forest Products Laboratory, 1963 High heels can represent contributory negligence by the plaintiff in American personal injury cases involving slip and fall accidents.Gary M. Bakken, H. Harvey Cohen, Jon R. Abele, Slips, Trips, Missteps, and Their Consequences, p. 170, Lawyers & Judges Publishing Company, 2007, , 9781933264011, google books Many high heel policies in the US are related to concerns over the potential for legal claims.  Regulations requiring the wearing of high heels  = In media and fashion = Some women have challenged the expectation that women should wear high heels in formal social situations. In 2015, a group of women were turned away from a film premi√®re at the Cannes Film Festival in France for wearing flat shoes, including a woman physically unable to wear heels due to an operation on one of her feet. The women complained that this was a sexist policy which forced women into a stereotyped appearance; festival organisers later responded that there was no official policy on footwear and stated that they would remind red carpet officials of this. =In workplaces= Some dress codes require women to wear high heels, and some medical organizations have called for a ban on such dress codes. There have been repeated protests by women workers against such policies. Laws regarding dress codes that require women to wear high heels in the workplace vary. It has been argued that high heels in the workplace should be subject to a health and safety assessment. Canada Guidelines on acceptable dress codes in the workplace are permitted by Canadian law in order to ensure that employees are able to complete their work safely and effectively. However the inclusion of the wearing of high heels in these guidelines has created controversy. Some workplace studies show that women in the hospitality industry who wear high heels have suffered injuries after tripping, falling or slipping. In addition, requirements for appearance which differ for male and female employees have the potential to be considered discriminatory. In 2014, waitresses at three restaurant chains in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, claimed that they were required to wear high heels at work despite complaining of pain and injury. Management responded that there was no written policy on wearing high heels. In April 2017, the Canadian province of British Columbia amended workplace legislation to prevent employers from requiring women to wear high heels at work. British Columbia premier Christy Clark stated that the government was \\"changing this regulation to stop this unsafe and discriminatory practice.\\" Other Canadian provinces followed suit. =US= During the mid-1990s, several US-based airlines required female flight attendants to wear shoes with heels. Minimum heel heights ranged from one-half inch to the two inches mandated by USAir. Flight attendants at times avoided censure by changing into more comfortable shoes during flights, since their supervisors were less likely to be present there. Policies that force women to wear heels have been challenged in a number of locations. In 2001, cocktail waitresses in Las Vegas organised a \\"Kiss My Foot\\" campaign which was successful in getting casinos to relax their requirement to wear high heels. =UK= In 2009, the UK Society of Chiropodists and Podiatrists released a report outlining the dangers of wearing high heels for extended periods and approached unions and employers to collaborate on measures to ensure risk assessments would be completed on women's footwear, and to offer alternatives to high heels where these were deemed unhealthy. Similar policies were tested again in the UK in 2016 when a temporary receptionist, Nicola Thorp, was sent home unpaid after she refused to follow the dress code at the office of accountants PricewaterhouseCoopers. Outsourcing firm Portico stated that Thorp \\"had signed the appearance guidelines\\" but after Thorp launched an online petition‚Äî\\"Make it illegal for a company to require women to wear high heels at work\\"‚Äîthe firm changed their policy. The new guideline states that all female employees \\"can wear plain flat shoes or plain court shoes as they prefer.\\" The petition gained widespread support from public figures such as Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon and MPs Caroline Dinenage, Margot James and Tulip Siddiq. Two parliamentary committees in January 2017 decided that Portico had broken the law; the company had already changed its terms of employment. The petition gained over 130,000 signatures, sufficient for a debate in the British parliament. This took place on 6 March 2017, when MPs decided the UK government should change the law to prevent the demand being made by employers. However, this was rejected by the government in April 2017 as they stated that existing legislation was \\"adequate\\". Existing legislation allows women to be required to wear high heels, but only if it is considered a job requirement and men in the same job are required to dress to an \\"equivalent level of smartness\\". =Israel= In 2015, the Israeli airline El Al introduced a requirement that female flight attendants wear high heels until passengers had been seated. The airline's workers' union stated that the requirement would endanger the health and safety of the flight attendants and instructed its members to ignore the rule. Later that year the requirement was removed. =Philippines= Also in 2017, the Philippines forbade companies from mandating that female employees wear high heels at work. =Japan= In 2019, a petition against mandatory high heels was started in Japan with the hashtag #KuToo, blending the #MeToo movement with the Japanese words for shoes (kutsu) and pain (kutsuu). Japan's labor minister commented that high heels are necessary for women.High heels at work are necessary, says Japan's labour minister The Guardian, 2019 See also *Foot Emancipation Society *KuToo movement *Price Waterhouse v.

The reserve is situated in the Tashtypsky District of Khakassia. It was originally created to preserve steppe ecosystems, wetlands and waterfowl nesting sites, and a historical complex of monuments and cemeteries from the 4-11 centuries BC. The reserve is particularly noted for its variety of large lakes on the Yenisei River migration route for birds. The current configuration of protected sectors was established in 1999, and covers a total area of . Topography The Khakasski Reserve is a collection of nine tracts of land covering two types of habitat - steppe and mountain taiga. The Minusinsk Depression is a low plain between the Kuznetsk Alatau mountain range to the west, and the Sayan mountains to the east. The Khakassia steppe, which is part of the Altai-Sayan mountain region, has characteristics of mountain steppes. Steppe Group * Lake Shira (ru:–ë–µ–ª—ë) (1,397 hectares). A salt lake with a surface area of 39.5 km2, Lake Shira has a public access section that supports beaches and medicinal spas (the water has a very high magnesium content). The lake is covered with ice from late November to April. * Lake Bele (ru:–ë–µ–ª—ë) (5,285 hectares). The largest mineral lake in Eastern Siberia (52 km2), Bele is 8 km north of Lake Shira. The surrounding terrain rises up to 240 meters above the lake surface, and there is some fir and spruce on the generally hilly steppe landscape. Like Lake Shira, Bele has no outflow and only one small river for inflow. The level of mineralization is 9-14 g/liter of water (about 1/3 the density of seawater. The reserve covers the north, southeast and southwest portions of the lake. Bele's waters contain an aboriginal population of Bele perch. Lake Itkul * Lake Itkul (ru:–ò—Ç–∫—É–ª—å (–æ–∑–µ—Ä–æ, –•–∞–∫–∞—Å–∏—è)) (5,547 hectares). Located 3 km southwest of Lake Shira, but 100 meters higher. Itkul is a freshwater lake, unlike Shira or Bele which are alkaline. The shores are sandy, or small gravel. Surroundings are gentle hills, and the southern shore has some covering of larch forest. * Oglakhty (ru:–û–≥–ª–∞—Ö—Ç—ã) (2,590 hectares). Oglakhty is a lowland ridge with a pronounced cuesta (sloped) formation, having an uplift of 100‚Äì150 meters. The rock is mostly sedimentary of the lower Carboniferous; there are some stands of birch but overall the terrain is steppe. This sector includes a burial complex of the Tashtyk culture from the first century CE. Most of the 15 km ridge, which runs along the Krasnoyarsk Reservoir, is part of the Khakasski reserve. * Kamyzyaksky steppe and Lake Ulug-Kol (ru:–ö–∞–º—ã–∑—è–∫—Å–∫–∞—è —Å—Ç–µ–ø—å) (4,789 hectares). Steppe ridge, with a small shallow lake that is endorheic with bitter-salty water. The lake has mud-flats on its shores and is a breeding place for a wide variety of waterfowl. * Podzaploty (ru:–ü–æ–¥–∑–∞–ø–ª–æ—Ç–Ω—ã–µ –±–æ–ª–æ—Ç–∞) (5,181 hectares). Steppe terrain. * Hol-Bogaz (ru:–•–æ–ª-–ë–æ–≥–∞–∑) (2,499 hectares). Steppe and mountain-steppe region in a spur of the Kuznetsky Alatau range. Mountain Taiga Group * Maly Abakan (ru:–ú–∞–ª—ã–π –ê–±–∞–∫–∞–Ω) (97,829 hectares). Along the \\"Small Abakan River\\", in mountainous terrain south of the steppe sectors of the Khakassi reserve. This sector was originally formed as a separate reserve in 1993 to protect pristine mountain pine taiga to serve as a benchmark for the study of the effects of logging. It was also designated as a site for the resettlement of sable. * Zaimka Lykovykh (ru:) (142,441 hectares). Contains the preserved homestead of Lykov family of Old Believers, who lived in the remote area far from civilization until well into the 20th century. Climate and Ecoregion Khakasski is located in the Sayan montane conifer forests ecoregion, a region of mid-elevation mountains in the Altai-Sayan mountain range of central Asia. It lies between the Siberian taiga to the north and the Mongolian steppe to the south. This ecoregion is characterized by mountains desiccated with river valleys, high levels of precipitation, and high biodiversity. Flora is generally dependent on the elevation and terrain, with forests having three main subzones based on altitude: light needle-leaf sparse taiga, dark needle-leaf taiga, and dark taiga. The climate of Khakasski is Subarctic climate, without dry season (K√∂ppen climate classification Subartic climate (Dfc)). This climate is characterized by mild summers (only 1-3 months above ) and cold, snowy winters (coldest month below ). In the steppe areas of the Khakassi reserve, average temperatures range from in January, to in July. Average precipitation per year is 250 ‚Äì 350 mm, although this can range up to 500 mm in the forested areas. Average frost-free period per year is 110‚Äì120 days. In the mountainous sectors of Khakassi, temperatures about 2 C degrees cooler, and precipitation ranges up to 800 - 1,100 mm/year with a frost-free period of only 85 days. Flora and fauna The different sectors were each chosen for a particular habitat for study and conservation, with the two general environments being steppe and mountain taiga. In the steppe area, the typical landscape features shores of developed upland meadows, with small larch groves and birch, and thickets of steppe shrubs. Where rivers enter the lakes are narrow strips of reed swamps, saline steppes and meadows. The reserve has recorded more than 852 species of vascular plants in the steppe areas. The mountain taiga sectors to the south are about 80 covered with coniferous forests, with smaller communities of dark-coniferous-birch forest. All told, the various sectors of the reserve have recorded 1195 species of vascular plants, from 429 genera and 105 families. The animal life of the reserve is characteristic of the northern Sayan mountain steppe and forest region. Characteristics mammals of the steppe are the steppe lemming, vole, and common field mouse. Larger mammals are the hare, fox and deer. Scientists on the reserve have recorded 52 species of mammals and 295 species of birds. 32 species of fish are resident, with chum salmon and trout recently having been reintroduced to Lake Bele. Ecoeducation and access As a strict nature reserve, the Khakasski Reserve is mostly closed to the general public, although scientists and those with 'environmental education' purposes can make arrangements with park management for visits. There are several 'ecotourist' routes in the reserve, however, that are open to the public. These require permits to be obtained in advance. On the Lake Itkul sector there is an 18 km bike trail, and a 14 km bird-watching trail with observation platforms. The reserve sponsors a Nature Museum that is open to the public. The main office is in the city of Abakan.
