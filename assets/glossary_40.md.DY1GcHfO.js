Silver is an American cell and systems biologist and a bioengineer. She holds the Elliot T. and Onie H. Adams Professorship of Biochemistry and Systems Biology at Harvard Medical School in the Department of Systems Biology. Silver is one of the founding Core Faculty Members of the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering at Harvard University. Silver is one of the founders of the emerging field of Synthetic Biology. She has made contributions to other disciplines including cell and nuclear biology, systems biology, RNA biology, cancer therapeutics, international policy research, and graduate education. Silver was the first Director of the Harvard University Graduate Program in Systems Biology. Education and early life Silver grew up in Atherton, California where she attended Laurel and Encinal Elementary Schools. During this time, she was a winner of the IBM Math Competition, winning a slide rule and received special recognition for her early aptitude in science. She attended Menlo Atherton High School and graduated from Castilleja School in Palo Alto. She received her B.A. in Chemistry from the University of California, Santa Cruz and her PhD in Biological Chemistry from the University of California, Los Angeles in the laboratory of William T. Wickner, working largely on the coat assembly of the M13 coliphage. Career and research Silver did her postdoctoral research with Mark Ptashne at Harvard University where she discovered one of the first nuclear localization sequences. She continued to study the mechanism of nuclear localization in her own lab as an Assistant Professor at Princeton University. During this time, she characterized the receptor for NLSs and discovered one of the first eukaryotic DnaJ chaperones. Silver continued in the area of Cell Biology upon moving to the Dana Farber Cancer Institute to hold the Claudia Adams Barr Investigatorship and to become Associate Professor of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology at Harvard Medical School and Dana-Farber. During this time, she was among the first to follow GFP- tagged proteins in living cells. In addition, she initiated early studies in systems biology to examine interactions within the nucleus on a whole genome scale. Together with Bill Sellers, she discovered molecules that block nuclear export and formed the basis for a publicly traded company Karyopharm Therapeutics. She was promoted in 1997 to Professor of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology at Harvard Medical School and Dana-Farber. In 2004, Silver moved to the newly formed Department of Systems Biology at Harvard Medical School as a Professor. Around this time, she worked closely with the Synthetic Biology Working Group at MIT and made the decision to move her research group into Synthetic Biology. Since then, she has developed numerous genetic circuits in all types of cells, engineered carbon fixation, and developed new therapeutic proteins and biofuel precursors. She observed the motion of the carbon fixing organelles in photosynthetic bacteria. She has worked extensively on designing modified bacteria to act as sensors for exposure to a drug or inflammation in the mammalian gut. She has served as the Director of an ARPA-E (DOE) project on electrofuels. =Synthetic Biology= Some of Silver‚Äôs foundational work in this area includes the engineering of: mammalian cells to remember and report past exposures to drugs and radiation, robust computational circuits in embryonic stem cells and bacteria, and synthetic switches to moderate gene silencing with the integration of novel therapeutic proteins. Silver‚Äôs work sets the stage for the development of novel therapies for use in both humans and animals. =Carbon fixation and sustainability= Silver has characterized the carboxysome ‚Äì the major carbon- fixing structure in cyanobacteria ‚Äì to enhance photosynthetic efficiency and carbon fixation. She has also engineered cyanobacteria to more efficiently cycle carbon into high-value commodities and has shown that these bacteria can form sustainable consortia. In a collaboration with Jessica Polka, Silver performed super-resolution microscopy of the Œ≤-carboxysome. The bionic leaf is a system for converting solar energy into liquid fuel developed by the labs of Daniel Nocera and Pamela Silver at Harvard. Silver collaborated with Daniel Nocera at Harvard University to develop a device, called the \\"Bionic Leaf\\", that converts solar energy into fuel through a hybrid water-splitting catalyst system that leverages metabolically-engineered bacteria. =Gene regulation= Silver discovered a correlation between nuclear transport and gene regulation ‚Äì she identified the first arginine methyltransferase, which plays a role in chromatin function and is important to the movement of RNA binding proteins between the nucleus and cytoplasm of cells. She also discovered previously unknown variations among ribosomes that led her to propose a unique specificity for the matching between ribosomes and the subsequent translation of mRNAs. Silver‚Äôs finding has several implications towards our understanding of how gene regulation impacts disease development, such as cancer. Awards Silver has been the recipient of an NSF Presidential Young Investigator Award, a Basil O‚ÄôConnor Research Scholar of the March of Dimes, an Established Investigator of the American Heart Association, the NIH Directors Lecture, and NIH MERIT award, Innovation award at BIO, a Fellow of the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study, the Elliot T. and Onie H. Adams Professorship at Harvard Medical School and named the Top 20 Global Synthetic Biology Influencers. She sits on numerous advisory boards and has presented to members of the US Congress. Silver was awarded the BBS Mentoring Award for Graduate Education at Harvard Medical School. She is also one of the founders of the International Genetically Engineered Machines competition (iGEM) and currently sits on the Board of iGEM.org. Silver founded and was the first Director of the Harvard University Graduate Program in Systems Biology. Silver was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2017.

He is the chairman & co-owner of the NFL's Minnesota Vikings. Early life Wilf was born in Berlin, West Germany on April 22, 1950. His parents, Joseph (1925-2016) and Elizabeth Wilf (1932-), are Polish Jews and Holocaust survivors from Nazi occupied Poland. The Wilf family immigrated to the United States from Europe in the early 1950s and settled in Hillside, New Jersey. After a brief stint as used car salesmen, Joseph and his brother Harry Wilf began purchasing apartment buildings and renting units. Eventually, the brothers began building single-family homes and founded Garden Homes. A real estate developer, his two main family-run businesses, Garden Homes and Garden Commercial Properties, have constructed some 25,000 homes in 39 states across the country since their initial ventures; the two entities and their affiliates own and manage in retail and business property.G.R. Anderson, Jr., Eye of the Beholder, City Pages, January 3, 2007. Wilf attended Fairleigh Dickinson University, earning a bachelor's degree in economics in 1971, and later earned a J.D. degree from New York Law School in Manhattan. President Richard Joel presented him with an honorary doctorate from Yeshiva University in May 2010 at the university's 79th commencement. Zygi, along with his brother Mark Wilf, serve as trustees of Yeshiva University. He received an honorary degree at Fairleigh Dickinson's 69th Commencement Ceremony in May 2012. Career After working as an attorney, Wilf joined the family business and became head of one of the company's affiliates, Garden Commercial Properties. Wilf has grown the company from four shopping centers in Northern New Jersey to over a hundred properties, including several large malls. In addition to the commercial properties, the Garden companies also own and manage 90,000 apartment units around the country. =Minnesota Vikings= Wilf and five partners purchased the Minnesota Vikings of the National Football League from Red McCombs in 2005 for a reported 600 million. Legal advisement for the deal was provided by international law firm Greenberg Traurig and now- Vikings Chief Operating Officer Kevin Warren. Forbes estimates the 2018 value of the franchise at 2.4 billion, the 18th of the 32 NFL teams or the 33rd of the 50 most valuable sports teams. For several years, the Vikings and Wilf stated that their former home, the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome was inadequate and had lobbied for a new stadium.City Pages - March 1, 2012 -Vikings, Rybak, Dayton, pro-Vikes legislators finally unveil stadium planTom Goldstein \\"Vikings Stadium Proposal Isn't For The People\\", City Pages, March 14, 2012 In May 2012, the Minnesota Vikings moved closer to getting a new $975 million stadium after the state Senate approved a plan that relies heavily on public financing. Later that month the deal was signed by Gov. Mark Dayton and narrowly approved by the Minneapolis City Council, ending any speculation of relocation. The new stadium, U.S. Bank Stadium opened in July 2016 on the site of the former Metrodome. =Nashville SC= In August 2017, Wilf, his brother Mark and his cousin Leonard became minority owners of the Nashville SC alongside lead investor John Ingram. Controversy In August 2013, Wilf, along with his brother, Mark Wilf, and cousin, were found liable by a New Jersey court for breaking civil state racketeering laws and keeping separate accounting books to fleece former business partners of shared revenue. The presiding judge noted that Wilf had used organized crime-like tactics to commit fraud against his business partners. In September, the judge awarded the two business partner plaintiffs Ada Reichmann and Josef Halpern $84.5 million in compensatory damages, punitive damages and interest that the Wilfs must pay. In June 2018, an appeal reduced this amount to roughly $32 million. Personal life In 2011, Zygi and Audrey Wilf purchased an apartment occupying the entire 18th floor of New York's 778 Park Avenue for $19 million, reduced from its original December 2009 asking price of $24.5 million while they still reside in their home in Springfield, New Jersey.

The Scooby Gang attends Joyce's funeral, and Angel visits to pay his respects. The day after the funeral, Dawn attempts to bring her mother back to life. Also, Glory learns that the Key is in human form. Plot Buffy selects a coffin for her mother with Giles and Dawn. Dawn expresses her concern that their mother would not have appreciated Buffy's choice. Later, the gang gathers for dinner at the Summers residence and discusses plans for the funeral, excluding Dawn from any decision making. Spike, while bringing a bouquet of flowers to the Summers home, runs into Willow and Xander. A brief spat occurs when Xander misinterprets this as Spike taking advantage of the situation to get closer to Buffy, while Spike insists that he was attempting to pay his respects to Joyce, as she was the only one of Buffy's \\"lot\\" that ever treated him decently. When it becomes clear that Xander won't be convinced otherwise, an irritated Spike throws the bouquet down and storms off, and it is only after he departs that Willow and Xander discover that he hadn't included a card with the flowers and recognize the sincerity of the gesture. The next day, a group of people gather at a cemetery for Joyce's funeral. Dawn leaves with Tara and Willow while Buffy remains at the grave. Hours later, after the sun has set, Angel appears beside her. Inconsolable regarding the loss of her mother, Dawn reveals to Tara and Willow her intent to perform a resurrection spell. After making love, Anya tells Xander how special it is to be able to create life, and how sex has become much more meaningful. Tara tries to convince Dawn that magic can't be used to alter the natural order of things, such as life and death, and tells her that Wiccans took an oath disallowing resurrection. In the graveyard, Angel does his best to comfort Buffy when she worries how she will continue without Joyce's strength, and if there was any chance she could have saved her mother. Angel offers to stay in town for as long as she needs him, and Buffy asks him to stay with her forever. The two kiss sweetly but pull away, knowing nothing more can happen. Buffy expresses her gratitude, and he stays with her until the sun rises. Ben encounters Jinx, saying that he will not help Glory and he is tired of her games, but accidentally makes a comment that leads Jinx to conclude that the Key is human. Not wanting Glory to learn this fact, Ben stabs the minion with his own knife. The next morning, Dawn is sulking over Willow and Tara's refusal to help her. As she leaves, Willow magically pulls a book out from the bookshelf to make it noticeable. Alone, Dawn retrieves the book, identifying the section about resurrection spells. Later, at the Magic Box, Dawn sneaks up to the loft after Giles tells her that's where he keeps his most dangerous books. She slips several items into her backpack. While collecting dirt from Joyce's grave that night, Dawn is caught by Spike, who recognizes her actions, but shocks her by offering to help. Meanwhile, Giles is seen drinking at home, reminiscing while listening to old records. Spike, claiming to dislike seeing Summers women \\"take it so hard on the chin,\\" makes Dawn promise not to tell Buffy of his involvement in her plans. Glory fumes about Ben after Jinx returns to her wounded, but quickly cheers up when he informs her that the Key is human. In the home of a man named Doc, Dawn and Spike receive an incantation, but learn that they need a Ghora demon's egg and a picture of Joyce. Doc advises Dawn that the results might not be what she wants and that if she wishes to undo the spell, she must tear up the image. Spike takes Dawn to a Ghora demon nest, where he plays interference with the three-headed demon while Dawn gets an egg, which she drops in her haste. During their second attempt, Spike is bitten by the Ghora, but kills it in turn. Tara realizes that A History of Witchcraft is missing from their shelf and after concluding that Dawn took it, she and Willow (who is sheepishly feigning surprise) decide to call Buffy. Buffy hears about Dawn's spell just as she is finishing it upstairs in her room. When Buffy confronts her, the two girls get into a vicious argument about their different ways of dealing with their mother's death. Dawn accuses Buffy of being so busy arranging everything that she doesn't care that their mother is dead, earning herself a slap across the face from her sister. Buffy immediately regrets her action and admits that she's keeping busy so she doesn't have to deal with the situation, because when she stops then her mother is really gone. During their argument, a figure emerges from Joyce's grave and walks toward the house. A shadow passes by the front window followed by a knocking on the door, and Buffy, hoping it's Joyce, rushes to answer the door. Dawn immediately realizes the inherent dangers of the spell and rips up the photo, and when Buffy answers the door all she finds is an empty step. This is too much for Buffy and she starts to cry, finally facing the reality of her mother's death. A sobbing Dawn hugs her, and they collapse to the floor united in grief. Production details Writer and director Marti Noxon says, \\"To me, the idea of wanting to defy death is just an inherent, almost mythological, iconic notion. It‚Äôs something we can relate to...a universal longing.\\" She says the idea for this episode arose from the idea that Dawn would be in the bargaining stage of mourning, and \\"if you were in Sunnydale and someone you loved died, you would absolutely call on the forces of darkness to resurrect them.\\" The magical-resurrection plot thread of this story bears a strong resemblance to the 1902 short story \\"The Monkey's Paw\\" by W. W. Jacobs.

This was a private railway, being the property of the New Redhead Estate and Coal Company and was generally known as the Belmont Branch. The line closed in December 1991. It has since been converted into a cycleway or rail trail - The Fernleigh Track. The Redhead Coal Mining Company In 1881, the Redhead Coal Mining Company Limited obtained rights over of coal bearing lands lying near the headland of that name, and by 1883 had expended some ¬£25,000 in sinking a shaft, installing machinery, and other improvements. In order to transport the coal to Newcastle, the Company was desirous of constructing a railway long, junctioning with the Government line, then under construction, at Adamstown. The necessary act was passed on 14 April 1885, and five years was allowed for the completion of the line. However, trouble developed in that it was found that the population reserve adjoining Newcastle encroached on the Company's property, and that several other portions had been taken up by different persons. This led to court proceedings and it was not until 1887 that the position had become sufficiently stabilised to warrant the Company proceeding with the construction of the line. As by this time the Company's five-year period prescribed by the act had nearly expired, an amending act was obtained on 5 June 1888, granting a further five year. On 21 December of that year, another amending act was passed authorising, amongst other things, deviations in the route, a branch to the South Burwood Coal Company's colliery, and an extension of the rights of construction to the northern shores of Lake Macquarie, through or near the village of Belmont. The railway, as authorised in the amended act, was to leave the Great Northern Railway at Adamstown and continue in a southerly direction, passing under Charlestown by a tunnel, continue through the Company‚Äôs Burwood Estate (where a coal mine was being opened up) and terminate in the Company's Redhead Estate, a distance of , also for a branch line to be constructed leaving the abovementioned railway at a point from Adamstown, known later as Dudley Junction, and running in a south- east direction to the South Burwood Coal Company's Estate, a distance of from the Junction. Coal transport by rail begins Work was commenced early in 1889 and the main line had been completed as far as Burwood (later No.3) Colliery, , by the end of 1891. Coal was sent from this mine over the new line early in 1892. Work on the extension to the Redhead Company's Ocean Colliery, and on the branch to the South Burwood Colliery was carried on apace both being open to traffic on 23 November 1892. An agreement was satisfactorily arranged between the Redhead Company and the Railway Commissioners, whereby the latter were to operate both lines for the Company, owing to the Company having neither locomotives nor rolling stock. Both the Burwood and South Burwood Collieries worked successfully, but, after about six months operation the Ocean Colliery at Redhead was closed, the traffic on the line ceasing early in June 1893. In 1894 the South Burwood Colliery was closed, leaving the Burwood Pit the only one working. Early in 1896, a new company, the Dudley Coal Mining Company, took over the South Burwood mine and renamed it the Dudley Colliery. This Company re-opened the mine in May 1896, and coal was again transported from the mine from that year. About the same period, the Scottish Australian Mining Company took over the Burwood Colliery, and also opened a new colliery at Redhead, which was named the Durham Colliery. Passenger services begin With the re-opening of the colliery at Dudley in 1896, the Redhead Coal Company approached the Railway Commissioners with a request that a passenger service be operated on the line between Adamstown and Dudley for the convenience of employees at both the Burwood and Dudley Collieries. The Commissioners agreed, and in January 1897 a through twice daily train service was commenced between Newcastle and Dudley, calling at Hamilton, Adamstown, Kahibah, and Burwood Colliery en route. For the convenience of employees and others who used this train service, small raised platforms were erected at Kahibah, Burwood and Dudley, and all trains stopped regularly at these places to pick up and set down passengers. The Kahibah platform was situated from Adamstown, Burwood platform (which served the Burwood Colliery and later as a transfer station to persons travelling to and from the Redhead line) was from Adamstown, and Dudley was about short of the colliery. Dudley platform was opened on 14 January 1900, all the other platforms were opened with the commencement of the passenger service. The trains left Newcastle daily (Sundays excepted) at 5.55 a.m., and 1.55 p.m., returning from Dudley on the same days at 3.20, and 11.20 p.m., the time of journey between Newcastle and Dudley being 40 minutes. These trains were worked usually by an E17 class engine hauling either six or eight 4-wheel and 6-wheel old time carriages, and a brake-van. The Redhead Branch During 1898 and 1899, the Scottish Australian Mining Company was opening out its new Durham Mine at Redhead, and among other things a siding was built from this colliery to the abandoned Redhead line, in length. However nothing eventuated until 29 January 1900, when, under the new name of \\"Lambton B\\", the Colliery was opened and shortly afterwards coal was transported from the mine over the Redhead line to Dudley Junction. The junction points of the Lambton B siding were situated from Dudley Junction. To handle the coal traffic on the Redhead line, an agreement was made between the Scottish Australian Mining Company and the Redhead Company for the former to work the traffic between Dudley Junction and Lambton B Colliery. This having been ratified by both companies, the Scottish Australian Company transferred an 0-6-0 tank engine \\"Newcastle\\" by name, from its colliery near Merewether Beach, to work the traffic late in 1899. Scottish Mining Co. passenger service For the convenience of employees at Lambton B Colliery the Scottish Mining Company decided to operate a passenger service on the line between Lambton B and Dudley Junction connecting at the latter place with Dudley trains to and from Newcastle. This service commenced with the opening of the mine on 29 January 1900, and was worked by the engine \\"Newcastle\\" hauling a tram-car, which at first was hired from, and in January 1901 purchased outright from, the Tramways branch of the Railway Commissioners. This car was a 70-passenger steam-trailer, having buffers and drawhooks to replace the usual link and pin couplers, and carried the number 149B. The service between Lambton B and Dudley Junction was worked by the Scottish Australian Mining Company's engine and car. On account of the passenger accommodation provided on the line being of the tram-car variety arranged for ground loading, no platforms were provided on the Dudley Junction-Lambton B section. A run round loop was provided at Dudley Junction, and persons wishing to travel on the Redhead branch left the Dudley trains at Burwood platform and walked across to the Lambton B engine and car, and vice versa. Further, as the siding arrangements at Lambton B were not suitable for reversing, each trip was extended to the old Ocean Colliery where there was a run round loop, and where the car was stabled when not in use, the locomotive being stabled in the Lambton B yard. Burwood Extended Colliery On 27 August 1903, a Company known as the Ocean Coal Company re-opened the old Ocean Colliery, and on 17 October 1904 renamed it the Burwood Extended Colliery. Coal was raised from this Colliery early in 1904, which increased the traffic on the Redhead line, so that the Redhead Company made a new agreement with the Railway Commissioners and the Scottish Australian Company, wherein the Railway Commissioners were to work all the coal traffic on the line, while the Company was to work the passenger traffic between Dudley Junction and Burwood Extended Colliery at Redhead. This new arrangement was brought into force on 28 March 1904, from which date the engine \\"Newcastle\\" ceased to haul the coal trains to Dudley Junction, work being done by the Government engines. To meet the increased passenger traffic on the Redhead line, the Scottish Australian Mining Company purchased an additional tram-car from the Government tramways in November 1904. This car was similar in all respects to the original car, but carried the number 107B. When the engine \\"Newcastle\\" was not employed hauling the tram-cars, it was used for shunting in the Lambton B yard, shunting at Burwood Extended being done by the Government engines. New Redhead Estate and Coal Mining Company In 1905 the Railway and all property owned by the Redhead Coal Mining Company was sold to a new Company, known as the New Redhead Estate and Coal Mining Company, and during that year an act was passed transferring all the rights of the old to the new Company. To meet the needs of the local people at Dudley and Redhead slight alterations were made so the train service to Dudley, early in 1906 viz:- The 5.50 p.m. train from Newcastle to Dudley would run every day, the 8.40 a.m. train Dudley to Newcastle would start at 8.10 a.m. and run every day. Connecting with these alterations the Scottish Australian Company ran additional trams leaving Burwood Extended Colliery at 7.55 a.m. and 6.00 p.m. on Mondays to Fridays, and on Saturdays the 8.25 a.m. tram from Burwood Extended was altered to 7.55 a.m. These alterations gave the Dudley residents a three times a day service with connections to Redhead. In August 1904, a crossing loop was put in at from Adamstown and named Redhead loop, it was renamed Fernleigh loop on 12 January 1925, and sidings were put into the Burwood No.3 (late Burwood), Dudley and Burwood Extended Collieries as required. Signal boxes were opened at Dudley Junction, and Lambton 3 Junction on 3 June 1910 and 4 February 1909 respectively. Through passenger trains to Redhead begin At a meeting of the Scottish Australian Company and the New Redhead Company in June 1910, it was decided to ask the Railway Commissioners to work the passenger traffic on the Redhead line. The Commissioners agreed and commencing with the summer timetable of 1910, a through service of passenger trains was introduced between Newcastle and Burwood Extended Colliery at Redhead. The trains, which were run similarly to the Dudley trains, left Newcastle daily (Sundays excepted) at 6.05 a.m., and 2.05 p.m., returning from Burwood Extended at 5.15 and 11.15 p.m. Each train called en route at Hamilton, Adamstown, Kahibah, Lambton B and terminated at Burwood Extended, but instead of the carriages being left at Burwood Extended they were shunted into Lambton B yard ready for the return trip. With the introduction of through trains on the Redhead line, the two tram-cars belonging to the Scottish Australian Company were sold to the Abermain Coal Company and transferred to Abermain during November 1910, the locomotive \\"Newcastle\\" lay derelict until 1914 in the Lambton B yard, when it was sold to Tullochs Phoenix Works at Rhodes near Sydney. Passenger services to Belmont 3079 stands at Belmont station with a passenger train on 4 August 1954 As early as 1905, agitation had been started by the local residents to have the Burwood Extended tram service extended to Belmont and Lake Macquarie. The Minister for Works, at the time, had a survey made for a tramline to be built from Burwood Extended Colliery to Belmont. It was decided by the Government to take over the line from Dudley Junction to Burwood Expended, and run a tram service to Belmont for tourists etc. A deputation from Dudley met the minister, asking that Dudley be not left out of the scheme, and that the tramline should be run through that town. However, on account of difficulties among the local residents themselves, and their not being able to come to some decision, the whole matter was shelved. In 1914, a fresh agitation was started by the local residents to have a tramway or railway to Belmont, and under the Transfer Act passed in 1905, authority was given to the New Redhead Estate and Coal Company to extend its line from Burwood Extended Colliery to Belmont, a distance of three miles (5 km). Work was carried on during 1915 and 1916 and was completed by October of the latter year. Small platforms were erected at Whitebridge, from Adamstown, at Redhead, from Adamstown; at Jewells Swamp, from Adamstown and at Belmont, from Adamstown. Work on station buildings, etc., having been completed, the railway extension was opened to traffic to Belmont on 23 December 1916. With the opening of the Belmont extension, a six times daily train service was run on Weekdays, with an extra train on Saturdays and four trains on Sundays. Kahibah had its name changed to Kenibea on 1 June 1915, and back to Kahibah on 6 April 1925. Lambton B Colliery was renamed Lambton Colliery on 1 February 1924. Burwood Extended was renamed Redhead Colliery in 1920. Jewells Swamp was renames Jewells on 4 November 1925, and transferred to the new site on 5 December 1925. Belmont Colliery siding was opened in 1926 and North Wallarah Colliery siding, also at Belmont, was opened in February 1941. Bramble siding on the Dudley line was opened on 15 March 1929 and closed on 7 July 1909. During the period 1900-1910, when the Scottish Australian Mining Company was operating a passenger service between Dudley Junction and Burwood Extended Colliery, its engine and cars travelled and carried 1,601,650 passengers. Goods trains Public goods traffic was first handled on the Belmont Railway in 1926, sidings being installed at Jewells and Belmont for that purpose, but from 1 September 1939, the Railway Commissioners declined to handle this class of traffic. In February 1941, owing to the difficulty of handling the heavy coal traffic on the line with its handicaps of single line, heavy grades, and non air braked hoppers, the passenger service was reduced to three trains each way daily. Duplication of the tracks In 1932, Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited acquired a Colliery Property on the line, which was named John Darling Colliery, and in anticipation of the additional traffic expected, the New Redhead Coal Company shortly afterwards commenced the duplication of the line between Adamstown and Fernleigh tunnel, also between Redhead, and Belmont. This work was stopped during the depression years and was never completed, though the original Redhead platform was replaced by one on a new site at Lambton B Junction in 1925, and a new platform was erected at Redhead South in the same year. A branch line to the John Darling Colliery was opened on 17 March 1925 and a platform, near the junction with the Belmont line, on 15 October 1924. Dudley line closed All traffic on the Dudley Junction- Dudley section ceased on 10 July 1931 and the rails were removed in 1941. A journey on the line (1940) Fernleigh 052863.JPGFernleigh Loop Dudley 052867.JPGDudley Junction On leaving Adamstown station, the Belmont line branched off to the left, becoming single track immediately clear of the junction. It commenced to climb at 1 in 40 into hilly country and, in the valley on the left, could be seen branch lines off the main line to the New Lambton and Shortland collieries. Winding into the hills, it came to the summit and a short tunnel immediately after which was situated Fernleigh Loop. Between Adamstown and the tunnel, an attempt had been made to duplicate the line and the derelict works could still be seen to the left of the line in 1940. Fernleigh Loop had Down and Up loops, one on each side of the main line. The lines here were on a sharp curve. There was no passenger platform, the only building being the signal box. Still traversing hilly country, the line came to Kahibah, a single platform on the right-hand side and located on a reverse curve. The station buildings here, as at other places, were once painted chocolate colour and finished in cream. Dudley Junction was the next \\"station,\\" and, as the name implies, was the junction for the Dudley branch, a short line serving the Dudley colliery, with another connection to Burwood colliery yard. There was a signal box with a very short platform at the Adamstown end of the loop and another platform with a shelter, but no name, existed further along the loop to serve the miners from the Burwood colliery. Alongside the main line was a long loop siding with a crossover in the middle of it, and was used for staging northbound traffic. Again rising, the line approached Whitebridge, a single platform on the left hand side and in the cutting the line reached the summit level of above sea level and above Adamstown. From here the line descended at 1 in 40 with a number of curves to Redhead, a crossing station with island platform. This station was signalled for working on either road, passenger traffic normally using the left-hand road. On the left-hand side adjacent to the station was the Lambton Colliery with its large white buildings. The next station we came to was Jewell‚Äôs, and between it and Redhead were uncompleted duplication works, first on one and then on the other side of the line. A derelict colliery (Redhead) was also passed in this section. Jewell‚Äôs had an island platform, but only the left hand side was used, the right-hand track being portion of the uncompleted duplication works long since abandoned. The station buildings here were in a deplorable condition, all windows, doors and about two-thirds of the weatherboards were missing and the platform was overgrown with grass and weeds. Shortly after passing Jewell's, a branch line curved off to the right to the John Darling mine, the catch points to this siding actually joining the derelict duplication and by the layout it was apparently intended to work each road as an independent single line as far as Redhead. Redhead was the only location on the branch where steam locomotives could take water. An elevated water tank was positioned at the southern end of the platform. A water column was provided on either side of the tank so that locomotives could take water whilst standing on either track. The line now proceeded over marshy ground past a half-derelict platform on the right displaying no name but presumably for the miners from the adjacent John Darling colliery. A short distance beyond this platform was the Landmark signal for Belmont, which was about half-a-mile further on, and was the terminus of the line. The station here consisted of a long platform on the right-hand side, with low buildings and offices. There was a run-round loop, a long goods siding and two additional sidings serving a colliery loading bank. The points at the approach end of the loop were unlocked by a key from the lever frame which worked all the other points. The line was fully signalled and was worked on the Electric Staff system of the New South Wales Railways, the sections being:- Adamstown - Fernleigh Loop - Dudley Junction. - Redhead - Belmont, with an intermediate instrument at John Darling Junction. The Dudley branch was worked by Ordinary Train Staff, without tickets. The line, for traffic purposes, was staffed and worked by the New South Wales Railways who also supplied motive power. The owners were responsible for the maintenance work of the line. Coal-dust and ashes formed a substitute for ballast and the riding qualities of the track were anything but smooth, the suburban cars lurching and rolling badly for practically the whole length of the trip. The station buildings were badly in need of paint and the whole line had a general air of neglect. A tall, disused, lattice signal post was standing a short distance from the Adamstown end of the tunnel, and was apparently once the Down Distant signal. At the end of the 1930s, the line suffered a severe reduction in its passenger service owing to the bus competition and also the difficulty in running sufficient coal trains to clear the collieries as, the hoppers all being non-air, much time was occupied in applying and releasing hand brakes en route. Passenger services decline During the 1960s, passenger services were worked by Broadmeadow-based 30-class locomotives, normally hauling up to three end- platform suburban carriages. The locomotives were rostered to work bunker first on the outward journey. During the final years of passenger services on the line, CPH railmotors were utilised. Passenger services ceased completely on 8 April 1971. The final years Until the early 1960s, coal trains on the Belmont Branch consisted of rakes of non-air-braked, 4-wheel hopper wagons hauled by either a 50 class or a 53 class Standard Goods locomotive on allotment to Port Waratah depot. Locomotives operated tender first towards Belmont and carried respirators for working through Fernleigh Tunnel. From 1963 the BHP Co progressively introduced its own CXD bogie hopper wagons to the Belmont line traffic. From August 1965, 48-class diesel locomotives took over from the steam engines on the coal trains, however there were brief periods when steam returned because of a shortage of diesel motive power. Later, 44, 45 and 47 class diesels were authorised to work the line, 47 class being particularly prevalent. A tour of the line as far as Jewells took place using the CPH Rail Motors of the Rail Motor Society (Paterson, NSW) on 28 March 1987. Following the closure of Lambton Colliery at Redhead, the last operating pit in the area in late 1991, the Belmont Branch was closed from 19 December 1991. Current use Following closure as a railway line, the corridor was converted into a combined bicycle and walking track, under the joint ownership of Newcastle City Council and Lake Macquarie City Council.

He was praised by historians for his insistence on being morally upright, and for being a just administrator of the law during his time as Xuanzong's senior chancellor. Background Song Jing was born in 663, during the reign of Emperor Gaozong. His clan was originally from Guangping (Âª£Âπ≥, in modern Handan, Hebei), but by the time of Song Jing's birth, his family had relocated to Xing Prefecture (ÈÇ¢Â∑û, roughly modern Xingtai, Hebei). The clan traced its ancestor to the Northern Wei official Song Bian (), although Song Jing's grandfather Song Wuben () and father Song Xuanfu () served only as local officials.New Book of Tang, vol. 75. Song Jing was said to be upright in his character from youth. He was also said to be learned and capable in writing, and passed the imperial examinations when he was young. During Wu Zetian's reign During the reign of Emperor Gaozong's wife Wu Zetian, Song Jing became Fengge Sheren (È≥≥Èñ£Ëàç‰∫∫, Fengge Sheren), a mid-level official at the legislative bureau of government (È≥≥Èñ£, Fengge). It was said that he acting properly while in office and was respected by Wu Zetian. In 703, when Wu Zetian's lovers Zhang Yizhi and Zhang Changzong tried to falsely accuse the chancellor Wei Yuanzhong by persuading Song's colleague Zhang Shuo to provide corroboration of their accusation that Wei wanted to pledge loyalty to Wu Zetian's son and crown prince Li Xian instead of Wu Zetian herself, it was Song, along with Zhang Tinggui () and Liu Zhiji who persuaded Zhang Shuo that historical reputation was more important than political expediency, which led Zhang Shuo to change his testimony and instead corroborate Wei's innocence. As a result, Wei (and Zhang Shuo) were exiled, but escaped death. Meanwhile, Song himself refused to yield to Zhang Yizhi and Zhang Changzong, despite their honored status. At one feast, Zhang Yizhi tried to placate Song by offering the most honored position on the table to Song, which Song declined‚Äîand subsequently, publicly showed disapproval when another official, Zheng Gao (), used an endearing epithet toward Zhang Yizhi. It was said that Zhang Yizhi and Zhang Changzong later tried to attack Song before Wu Zetian, but Wu Zetian favored Song and therefore took no action. Song soon became Yushi Zhongcheng (), one of the deputy chief imperial censors. In 704, when Zhang Changzong was accused of having had inappropriate discussions with the fortuneteller Li Hongtai (), who had told him that he had the appearance of an emperor, Song pressed on with the investigation even though Wu Zetian and the chancellor Yang Zaisi signaled to him that he should stop the investigation. He even had Wu Zetian approve an interrogation of Zhang Changzong, although as the interrogation had just commenced, Wu Zetian issued an edict pardoning Zhang Changzong. Song sighed, \\"I should have first cracked that villain's skull.\\" When Wu Zetian subsequently had Zhang Changzong try to meet Song to thank him for the release, Song refused to meet Zhang Changzong. During Emperor Zhongzong's second reign In 705, Wu Zetian was overthrown in a coup, and Li Xian, formerly emperor, was restored to the throne (as Emperor Zhongzong). Song Jing became the deputy minister of civil service affairs (), and as Emperor Zhongzong favored Song for his morals, he also gave Song the title of imperial consultant (Ë´´Ë≠∞Â§ßÂ§´, Jianyi Daifu). Soon thereafter, he was made Huangmen Shilang (), the deputy head of the examination bureau of government (ÈñÄ‰∏ãÁúÅ, Menxia Sheng). At that time, Wu Zetian's nephew and Emperor Zhongzong's cousin Wu Sansi the Prince of Dejing, who was also the lover of Emperor Zhongzong's powerful wife Empress Wei, was very powerful. On one occasion, Wu Sansi made a request to Song and Song sternly rejected, stating: In summer 706, when the hermit Wei Yuejiang () submitted an accusation of the adulterous relationship between Wu Sansi and Empress Wei, Emperor Zhongzong was incensed and was set to execute Wei Yuejiang. Song refused, stating that executing Wei Yuejiang would merely bring more rumors and that if Emperor Zhongzong were to execute Wei Yuejiang, he needed to execute Song first. Meanwhile, other officials, including Su Xiang (), Xu Jian (), and Yin Sizhen (), pointed out that it was inappropriate to execute anyone during the summer. Emperor Zhongzong thus spared Wei Yuejiang and exiled him to the Lingnan region. (However, Wei Yuejiang ultimately was unable to escape death, as Empress Wei's associate Zhou Rengui (), then the commandant at Guang Prefecture (Âª£Â∑û, roughly modern Guangzhou, Guangdong), executed Wei Yuejiang as soon as fall came.) Soon thereafter, Wu Sansi had Song sent out of the capital to serve as acting prefect of Bei Prefecture (Ë≤ùÂ∑û, in modern Xingtai). Once Song got to Bei Prefecture, he further offended Wu Sansi‚Äîas he refused to have tax payments due Wu Sansi as his fief paid to Wu Sansi, citing that the region had just suffered a flood. He was moved to be the prefect of the more distant Hang Prefecture (Êù≠Â∑û, roughly modern Hangzhou, Zhejiang), and later served as the prefect of Xiang Prefecture (Áõ∏Â∑û, in modern Handan). It was said that he was clean but strict as a prefect, and his subordinates did not dare to be corrupt. During Emperor Shang's reign and Emperor Ruizong's second reign Emperor Zhongzong died suddenly in 710‚Äîa death that traditional historians believed to be a poisoning carried out by Empress Wei and her daughter Li Guo'er the Princess Anle, so that Empress Wei could become \\"emperor\\" like Wu Zetian and Li Guo'er could be crown princess. Meanwhile, though, Emperor Zhongzong's son by a concubine, Li Chongmao the Prince of Wen, was named emperor (as Emperor Shang), but Empress Wei retained power as empress dowager and regent. Song Jing was made the secretary general of Luo Prefecture (), which contained the eastern capital Luoyang. Less than a month later, Empress Dowager Wei and Li Guo'er were killed in a coup led by Emperor Zhongzong's sister Princess Taiping and nephew Li Longji the Prince of Linzi. Li Longji's father Li Dan the Prince of Dan, himself a former emperor, returned to the throne (as Emperor Ruizong). Emperor Ruizong made Song the minister of civil service affairs () and gave him the designation Tong Zhongshu Menxia Sanpin (), making him a chancellor de facto. After Li Longji was created crown prince, Song was also made a member of his staff. During Emperor Zhongzong's reign, the civil service affairs system was subject to great abuses by powerful individuals at court, particularly while the chancellors Cui Shi and Zheng Yin were in charge ‚Äî as they were allowing bribes and pleas by powerful individuals to influence them, going as far as naming reserve officials two years in advance. Song and his deputies Li Ai () and Lu Chongyuan () reformed the system and put the civil service system back in order, at the same time that Song's fellow chancellor Yao Yuanzhi, who was then also minister of defense, put the military promotion system back in order as well. It was said that popular sentiment at the time viewed this as the return to the clean government of the days of Emperor Gaozong's father Emperor Taizong. Song's reforms included removing all of the several thousands of officials that Emperor Zhongzong commissioned directly without submitting the commissions to the examination bureau for review. Meanwhile, Princess Taiping and Li Longji were beginning to have discord, as both tried to influence Emperor Ruizong's administration. Princess Taiping, finding Li Longji difficult to control, began considering trying to replace him as crown prince with one of two nephews with arguable better claims than Li Longji‚ÄîLi Longji's older brother Li Chengqi the Prince of Song and his cousin Li Shouli the Prince of Bin, the son of Emperor Zhongzong's older brother Li Xi√°n (note different tone), who had been crown prince at one point during Emperor Gaozong's reign. When she hinted that Li Longi should be replaced at a meeting she had with the chancellors, the other chancellors all did not dare to speak, but Song directly responded: In spring 711, Song and Yao suggested to Emperor Ruizong that the way to stop the rumors about Li Longji's being replaced would be to send Princess Taiping and her husband Wu Youji to live in Luoyang, while sending Li Chengqi and Li Shouli out of the capital Chang'an to be prefectural prefects. Emperor Ruizong initially agreed (with the exception that he believed that Luoyang was too far, and therefore was ready to send Princess Taiping to Wu Youji to Pu Prefecture (Ëí≤Â∑û, roughly modern Yuncheng, Shanxi) instead), but after Princess Taiping found out and objected vehemently, Li Longji, fearful of consequences, disavowed and denounced Song and Yao. Emperor Ruizong removed both from their chancellor positions and demoted them to be prefectural prefects‚Äîin Song's case, to be the prefect of Chu Prefecture (Ê•öÂ∑û, roughly modern Huai'an, Jiangsu). He later served successively as the prefect of Yan Prefecture (ÂÖóÂ∑û, roughly modern Jining, Shandong), Ji Prefecture (ÂÜÄÂ∑û, roughly modern Hengshui, Hebei), and Wei Prefecture (È≠èÂ∑û, in modern Handan); the examiner of Hebei Circuit (Ê≤≥Âåó, roughly modern Hebei, Beijing, and Tianjin); the commandant at You Prefecture (ÂπΩÂ∑û, roughly modern Beijing); and principal of the imperial university (ÂúãÂ≠êÁ•≠ÈÖí, Guozi Jijiu), being in charge of Luoyang. He was then recalled to Chang'an to serve as the secretary general of the capital prefecture Yong Prefecture (ÈõçÂ∑û, roughly modern Xi'an, Shaanxi). During Emperor Xuanzong's reign In 712, Emperor Ruizong passed the throne to Li Longji, who took the throne as Emperor Xuanzong. In 713, after Emperor Xuanzong converted Yong and Luo Prefectures to special municipalities, Song was made the mayor of Jingzhao Municipality (‰∫¨ÂÖÜÂ∫ú, i.e., the old Yong Prefecture). As of 715, he was serving as chief imperial censor (Âæ°Âè≤Â§ßÂ§´, Yushi Daifu), when, on one occasion, he was accused of not ordering for greater force to be applied when a criminal was being caned, and he was demoted to be the prefect of Mu Prefecture (Áù¶Â∑û, in modern Hangzhou). He was later made the commandant at Guang Prefecture (Âª£Â∑û, roughly modern Guangzhou, Guangdong). It was said that at that time, the people of Guang Prefecture used bamboo to build houses, and therefore the houses were prone to fires. Song promoted the use of bricks, which greatly reduced the damage of fires, and the people of the region were grateful for this. As of 716, Yao Yuanzhi‚Äîwho had changed his name to Yao Chong by that point‚Äîand Lu Huaishen were serving as chancellors. Lu died in late 716, and before he did, submitted a petition arguing that Song and several other officials, Li Jie (), Li Chaoyin (), and Lu Chongyuan had been demoted only of minor offenses and, as they were talented, should be repromoted. Meanwhile, Yao was drawing displeasure from Emperor Xuanzong due to accusations that his sons and associate Zhao Hui () were corrupt. Yao, in fear, offered to resign and recommended Song to succeed him. Emperor Xuanzong, who was then preparing to go to Luoyang, thus recalled Song to serve as the minister of justice (ÂàëÈÉ®Â∞öÊõ∏, Xingbu Shangshu) and be in charge of Chang'an. He sent one of his close eunuch associates, Yang Sixu (), to Guang Prefecture to escort Song back to the capital. Yang had many past achievements‚Äîincluding putting down a coup during Emperor Zhongzong's reign led by Emperor Zhongzong's crown prince Li Chongjun‚Äîand was honored by the emperor, but on the trip back to Chang'an, Song, who did not like to ingratiate the emperor's associates, did not say anything to him. When Yang informed Emperor Xuanzong of this, Emperor Xuanzong was even more impressed with Song. Around the new year 717, he removed Yao and fellow chancellor Yuan Qianyao from their chancellor posts and replaced them with Song and Su Ting‚Äînaming Song Huangmen Jian (ÈªÉÈñÄÁõ£, the head of the examination bureau, which by that point had been renamed Huangmen Sheng ()) and acting minister of civil service affairs. Emperor Xuanzong also created Song the Duke of Guangping. Song and Su worked well together, with Song taking the leading role and Su the assisting role. With Yao having distinguished himself as one who modified the regulations to fit the situation and Song known for following the laws strictly and fairly, it was said that while their styles were different, they were both considered great chancellors of Emperor Xuanzong's reign. Song was also known for often making suggestions to correct Emperor Xuanzong's and governmental officials' behavior, thus causing Emperor Xuanzong to respect him more. These actions included: * In spring 717, when Emperor Xuanzong was heading to Luoyang, he saw that the roads were not in good condition and initially was angry, wanting to arrest the mayor of Henan Municipality (i.e., Luoyang) and the official in charge of the itinerary. Song pointed out that this would have the undesirable effect of causing the officials to put many citizens to labor to repair the roads. Emperor Xuanzong was set to release the two, but Song then pointed out that if he did so immediate, the officials would be grateful to Song, not to him, and therefore suggested that he should order the two to report to the place of investigation and then release them there. * In fall 717, under Song's suggestion, Emperor Xuanzong restored the customs during Emperor Taizong's times that officials were not to meet the emperor privately without imperial chroniclers and advisors present, to promote openness. * In winter 717, when Emperor Xuanzong requested that Song and Su submit a number of formal names and titles for his sons and daughters‚Äîbut separately requested a set of particularly honorable names, presumably for a favorite son‚ÄîSong and Su pointed out that this would be viewed as favoritism, and therefore submitted a group of names without any designation as to what were particularly honorable names. * When Song found out that the officials of Guang Prefecture had established a monument for him, he informed that Emperor Xuanzong that he believed that the act was mere flattery, trying to ingratiate him as a chancellor. He suggested that not only the monument be abolished, but that such actions be prohibited in the future, and Emperor Xuanzong agreed. * When Emperor Xuanzong's father-in-law Wang Renjiao () died, Wang Renjiao's son Wang Shouyi () requested that a tomb be built for Wang Renjiao that would be as large as Emperor Xuanzong's maternal grandfather Dou Xiaochen (), and Emperor Xuanzong initially agreed. Song and Su pointed out that Dou's tomb was already considered overly wasteful and should not be followed. Emperor Xuanzong agreed, and reduced the scale of Wang Renjiao's tomb. * When Emperor Xuanzong wanted to give an extraordinary promotion to Wang Renchen () -- a former staff member of his who also appeared to be Wang Renjiao's cousin‚ÄîSong pointed out that this was unfair favoritism, and that Wang Renchen might deserve an award but not an extraordinary promotion. * When Song Yuanchao (), a reserve official who was also a cousin of Song Jing's father Song Xuanfu, tried to use the connection to gain influence on the civil service officials, Song Jing found out and removed Song Yuanchao from the roll of reserve officials. * When Li Chengqi, whose name had been changed to Li Xi√†n at this point and who was greatly honored by Emperor Xuanzong as an older brother, recommended a relative named Xue Sixian () as an official, Song pointed out that this would be unfair favoritism as well, and recommended that Xue's service be reexamined. * It had been customary that the liaison officers that the regional governments sent to Chang'an carried large sums of money and treasure to Chang'an‚Äîand they were then often kept at Chang'an as officials, creating the perception that they had bribed powerful individuals. Song changed the regulations such that such liaison officers were required to return to the regional governments. By 720, however, Song's strictness would eventually bring his removal. Song had ordered that individuals who had repeatedly appealed their cases without cause be detained by the imperial censors, until they were willing to drop their appeals. This drew much anger from people. At that time, there happened to be a drought, which, according to popular beliefs at the time, would be accompanied by the appearance of a spirit known as the Hanba (). One day, while Emperor Xuanzong was watching a play, an actor dressed as the Hanba, and stated: Meanwhile, further, Song and Su were strictly prohibiting the use of damaged coins, which they had tried to replace with newly minted coins. However, the damaged coins were still in circulation despite the prohibition, particularly in the region between the Yangtze River and the Huai River. Song sent the imperial censor Xiao Yinzhi () to the region to be in charge of collecting the damaged coins and taking them out of circulation. Xiao was strict in his behavior, drawing much resentment. Emperor Xuanzong, when he heard this, demoted Xiao, and in spring 720 removed Song and Su from their chancellor posts, giving Song the honorific title of Kaifu Yitong Sansi () instead. He replaced Song and Su with Yuan and Zhang Jiazhen. In 722, while Emperor Xuanzong was at Luoyang, there was a coup attempt at Chang'an by the army officer Quan Chubi (), who had his nephew Quan Liangshan () claim to be the son of Emperor Shang and therefore deserving of the throne. The coup attempt was put down quickly, and Quan Chubi was killed. Emperor Xuanzong sent the mayor of Hunan Municipality, Wang Yi (), to Chang'an to investigate. Wang detained a large number of people but could not quickly come to resolutions as to who were responsible. Emperor Xuanzong made Song in charge of Chang'an and had him investigate. Song quickly determined who were the leaders and had them executed, and at his request, Emperor Xuanzong pardoned the rest of the detainees. In 724, when Emperor Xuanzong was set to visit Luoyang again, he again made Song in charge of Chang'an and made him minister of civil service affairs; he also awarded Song with silk. Around 725, when Emperor Xuanzong's trusted general Wang Maozhong () was set to have his daughter married, he invited the key government officials to the wedding banquet‚Äîbut Song declined; Wang, who wanted the honor of Song's attendance, had Emperor Xuanzong order Song to attend, which Song did, but as soon as he had the chance to toast the emperor, he then claimed illness and left the banquet. In 729, Song was made You Chengxiang (), one of the heads of the executive bureau of government (Â∞öÊõ∏ÁúÅ, Shangshu Sheng). The day that Song was to take office, Yuan and Zhang Shuo were to take new offices as well, Emperor Xuanzong set up a grand ceremony for their inauguration, including an elaborate tent, music, and food from the imperial kitchen. Emperor Xuanzong personally wrote a poem commemorating the contributions of the three.New Book of Tang, vol. 124. In 730, when the chancellor Pei Guangting took the office of minister of civil service affairs as well, Pei instituted a system of promotion based on seniority. Song argued fervently against it, believing that this would cause capable people to be stuck in low positions, but Emperor Xuanzong did not agree. In 733, Song retired and took residence in Luoyang, and Emperor Xuanzong ordered that full salaries be paid to Song notwithstanding his retirement. In 734, when Emperor Xuanzong visited Luoyang, Song came out of his mansion to greet the emperor, and Emperor Xuanzong had his son Li Huang () the Prince of Rong personally comfort Song, and thereafter frequently sent medicines and delicacies to Song. Song died in 737 and was given posthumous honors. Notes and references * Old Book of Tang, vol. 96. * New Book of Tang, vol. 124. * Zizhi Tongjian, vols. 207, 208, 209, 210, 211, 212, 213, 214.

He held automotive design positions at General Motors, Packard, and Chrysler before becoming Vice President of Design for American Motors Corporation (AMC), and designed several notable show cars and production vehicles including AMC's Pacer, Gremlin and Hornet models, as well as the Jeep Cherokee XJ and either designed or assisted in the designing of later cars for Chrysler such as the Jeep Grand Cherokee and Neon after American Motors' buyout. Early life Teague's mother worked in the motion picture industry during the silent movie era. At five years of age Teague appeared in five episodes of Our Gang, playing the role of Dixie Duval, a girl. When he was six, he was seriously injured in a car accident near Pasadena, California, which was caused by a drunk driver. He lost several teeth, suffered a broken jaw, as well as sight in his right eye (leaving him without depth perception or stereoscopic vision), while his mother was left an invalid. A year later his father was killed in another automobile accident, also caused by a drunk driver. While attending grade school in Los Angeles during the 1930s, Teague built model airplanes before turning to hot rods, since his schoolmates included Ed Iskendarian (who became a drag racer), and land speed racer Stuart Hilborn, as well as other car enthusiasts. He participated in time trials on a dry lake northeast of Los Angeles and was fond of saying that he \\"had a little gasoline in his blood.\\" Teague was exempt from service in the armed forces during World War II because of his visual impairment. After graduating from Susan Miller Dorsey High School in 1942, he worked as an aircraft technical illustrator for Northrop Corporation. His boss, Paul Browne, was a former designer at General Motors who suggested that Teague take night classes at the ArtCenter College of Design. Early work Executive After World War II, Teague penned a design for a pre-Henry J economy car for Kaiser Motors. In 1947 he joined the General Motors design studios headed by Edmund Anderson. Starting as an apprentice stylist and eventually graduating to the Cadillac advanced design group, he also worked on the 1950 Oldsmobile Rocket. The 1950s \\"saw some of the most beautiful and some of the most outlandish vehicles\\" and the head of the design department at General Motors liked chrome on cars. Teague described how two sets of overlay designs were made for Harley Earl to choose from. Both chrome trim sets had been put on one Oldsmobile prototype by mistake. Earl saw it and ordered it produced that way although the stylists were horrified. Teague was dismissed from General Motors in 1952, and joined the Packard Motor Car Company as Chief Stylist, following John Reinhart's resignation. His first work there was a minor facelift on the Packard line for 1953, and when the Packard management under James J. Nance decided to re-launch the Clipper brand as a stand-alone make, separate from Packard, it was Teague who achieved the visual distinction between the two. He also designed several Packard show cars. These included the 1953 Balboa (whose canopied reverse-slant and lowering for ventilation rear window later appeared on the 1957 Mercury Turnpike Cruiser, 1958‚Äì1960 Lincoln Continental, and various Mercury models), the 1954 Panther, and contributed with William Schmidt to the 1955 Request, whose principal designer was Dick Macadam. The restyled Packard line for 1955 showed Teague's keen eye for detail and his ability to produce significant changes based on limited budgets. However, the company was not doing well following the purchase of struggling Studebaker Corporation in 1954. The last Teague design for Packard was the Executive, introduced mid-1956 and derived from the Clipper Custom, launched just as sales of the luxury Packard line collapsed. Teague also designed the last Packard show car, the Predictor, plus a new Packard and Clipper lineup for 1957 that would have followed the general lines of the Predictor. The design was stillborn when the Detroit Packard operations were shut down completely in mid-1956. Lacking funds for all-new models, the Studebaker-Packard Corporation had to make use of existing and economical Studebaker designs. Working with little time and money, the stopgap 1957 Studebaker-based Packard models became known as \\"Packardbakers.\\" The 1957 Packard Clipper, popularly derided as \\"a Studebaker wearing Packard makeup\\", was designed largely by Teague, and was intended as a temporary stopgap to keep the brand going until the company's fortunes improved and a \\"real\\" Packard model could again be made. By 1957, the entire Packard styling team had moved to Chrysler Corporation and Teague became Chief Stylist. After leaving due to management conflicts, he went to work for an independent design firm on non-automotive assignments. American Motors AMC designers, 1961: Teague stands by the scale model Rambler's left front fender 1967 AMC Ambassador convertible AMC Pacer 1975 One of Teague's widely known designs, the Jeep Cherokee XJ 1983 Teague joined American Motors Corporation (AMC) as a member of Edmund E. Anderson's design team in 1959, and became principal designer when Anderson left in 1961. Teague's first assignment, according to designer James W. (Jim) Alexander, was to re-do the front sheetmetal on the 1961 Ambassador.Lamm, p. 202. Retrieved on 27 August 2013 The first cars influenced by Teague's styling were the 1963 Rambler Classic and Ambassador, AMC's first all-new models since 1956. With the ascendancy of Teague in the early 1960s, \\"AMC Styling began to be written of in a more positive manner\\" within the industry and automotive press. Teague was Vice President at the automaker from 1964 until he retired from AMC in 1983. At his retirement, he joked that the only Detroit auto company he had not worked for was Ford. Although he worked within tight budget restrictions at AMC, Teague sometimes referred to his times there as \\"Camelot\\". Designing several different cars from existing AMC stampings, he worked \\"relative miracles\\" compared to the spending norms in this industry. With little money to work with, he reconfigured the existing cars and parts in new ways. For example, he incorporated the doors from AMC's large-sized automobiles into his design for the new 1964 compact Rambler American. The AMC Cavalier was one of the \\"Project IV\\" concept cars in the mid-1960s that demonstrated advanced techniques of interchangeable body panels and design symmetry. The right front and left rear fenders were identical, as well as the panels for doors, hood, and deck lid all interchanged. The automobile platforms designed by Teague featured numerous interchangeable door skins, glass, and more. For example, the front and rear bumpers on the 1970 AMC Hornet were made from the same stamping. This design talent yielded significant cost savings for the company. Teague's work on the 1967-1969 AMC Ambassador proved that he \\"could do more with less than most any other car designer around -- usually because he had to.\\" While the 1965 models were reskinned and rode on a longer wheelbase, Teague \\"came through handsomely with crisp, angular lines\\" that helped the Ambassador achieve record sales. The 1967 model year brought even greater change, in line with Roy Abernethy's longtime aim of matching Big Three models on most every front, including an all-new Ambassador that \\"emerged as one of the decade's unsung good-lookers.\\" After a management change at AMC, Teague worked under Roy D. Chapin, Jr. who was also a sports car enthusiast. Teague developed production models that featured \\"excitement\\" such as the Javelin. This design evolved from two AMX prototypes that were part of the \\"Project IV\\" concept cars during 1966.Mueller, page 101. Other top executives, such as Robert B. Evans, wanted Teague's two-seat AMX design to be brought to the market \\"very quickly.\\" Teague originated a non-running show car in late-1965 and since he was a ‚Äútwo-seater kind of guy, the production American Motors AMX was his car.\\" The new models offerings reflected AMC's strategy to shed its \\"economy car\\" image and appeal to a more youthful, performance-oriented market. During the 1970s, \\"only a handful of cars had real personalities, and many of those came from the smallest U.S. producer, American Motors\\" under the direction of Teague. When the automobile market was changing to a greater focus on quality and fuel efficiency, Teague characterized the work by his design team at AMC as \\"we still want to make cars with charisma; cars that stand out from the pack ... the future means the large look inside, away from the claustrophobic.\\" Teague worked on the design of the 1975 AMC Pacer, the first car with cab forward design. It was also the first 'wide-small' automobile that \\"gave drivers the impression they were driving a conventional large American.\\" Its \\"styling was different and appealing in an offbeat sort of way\\" featuring large amounts of glass. The Pacer's low beltline prevented the side door window from lowering completely out of sight, so Teague designed the inner door panels with large bolsters.\\" Anatole Lapine, the designer of the Porsche 928 body was inspired by the Pacer. Teague received AMC Hall of Fame recognition as the 2012 \\"Person of American Motors\\" - an executive or employee of American Motors or subsidiary company that was instrumental to the success of the company. Teague designs 1968 AMX-GT show car 1970 AMC AMX 390 go-package blue front 1973 AMC/American Motors Hornet 2-Door Fastback 1974 Matador X Coupe 1969 AMC Javelin SST British automotive writer Nick Georgano devotes a chapter to Teague in the book titled The Art of the American Automobile: the Greatest Stylists and their Work describing individuals whose creative talents made a difference in production and custom automobiles since the 1930s. According to the authors of the book,Yesterday's Tomorrows: Past Visions of the American Future, Teague was one of the people that \\"helped to transport us into the future.\\" While serving as the chief stylist, Teague was called by Popular Mechanics to predict the design trends for automobiles in the 1960s. Together with Brooks Stevens, Teague presented ideas about future cars and vehicle technologies at the 1963 SAE congress in Detroit. Teague, \\"who is generally considered to have been a bit of a maverick\\" predicted an evolutionary process for automobiles that turned out to be right. Teague foretold improvements in conventional gasoline engines, while cars \\"would have greater variety of style now that glass could be shaped, and better suspension systems\\" In contrast to Stevens, Teague believed that the automobiles of 1970 would still be built to provide basic transportation, and not be \\"a home on wheels\\" powered by an advanced power plant ‚Äúthe size of a breadbox.‚Äù During the early-1960s, Teague's styling team began developing an entirely new concept for AMC - a sporty fastback design. Teague knew that the automaker was just not willing to spend the millions of dollars needed for all-new tooling, his design team made imaginative use of existing tooling and create spin-offs from existing products. The results were proposals for which Teague selected the names for both: the Tarpon show car and the production Marlin. Although promoting the smaller version, Teague recalled that \\"Abernethy had decided that instead of a 2+2 we would build a 3+3 sports-type car.\\" Teague was responsible for the design of several AMC and Jeep vehicles. He developed the Gremlin, Pacer, Matador coupe, Rambler American, AMC Javelin, and AMX Hornet, and subsequently adapted AMC's compact platform for the Concord, Spirit and Eagle models. He was also responsible for a number of concept cars and lobbied for the production of several, including the compact Tarpon that ultimately led to the large Marlin. He also lobbied for continuing the two-seat AMX models after 1970. The 1968 AMX GT was one of the Teague-designed concept cars which had some of their design elements incorporated into production models. For this short-wheelbase coupe he styled a truncated kammback tail which was then used on the 1970 Gremlin. He also designed the \\"Concept 80\\" series of show cars, built on variations of existing AMC platforms as ideas for possible future models. Perhaps Teague's strongest effort ever was the \\"handsome design\\" of the 1970 AMX/3 that AMC developed with help on the chassis from Italian sports-car engineer Giotto Bizzarrini and road testing and development from BMW. Before he and his team of designers settled on the final design, a fiberglass pushmobile was made with the molds taken from the final clay mockup. The AMX/3 is one of the most unusual cars to come out of Detroit in the late-1960s featuring an internationally sourced components, a top speed of , and potentially the Ford Pantera as its closest competitor. Teague was instrumental in moving the car to production at a reasonable cost, but upcoming U.S. bumper regulations and other issues would have inflated its price beyond volume viability. Teague was responsible for the Jeep Cherokee (XJ) that was launched in the United States in 1983. He described the practical and utilitarian appearance of the new SUV: \\"We didn't want to lose the flavor of the older Jeeps ... We wanted it to look like something you'd want to take into the rough country.\\" The design was unchanged and remained in production through 2001 and in China to 2005. The Cherokee XJ was described by one automotive magazine in 2009 as \\"possibly the best SUV shape of all time\\", and was the last Teague design to go into production. Automotive journalist Robert Cumberford, writing for Automobile, called the Jeep XJ one of the 20 greatest cars of all time -- for its design, and \\"possibly the best SUV shape of all time, it is the paradigmatic model to which other designers have since aspired.\\" Starting in 1982, Teague worked on the first large cars sold by AMC since 1978, the front-drive sedan code named X-58, for introduction in late-1986. and a companion code named X-59, that was to debut for the 1988 model year. He achieved a roomy interior in an aerodynamic design, and the two-door model was to have featured hidden headlamps, but the coupe was never produced. Giorgetto Giugiaro penned the sharper-edged exterior design for the four-door sedan that went into production as the Eagle Premier. Historian and collector 1970 AMX/3, a mid-engined car Teague was a noted automobile historian and collected classic and rare vehicles, as well as other auto memorabilia. He restored old cars as a hobby, including a 1904 Packard, one of the first produced, and had already owned 285 cars by 1970. Teague was a 4-wheel drive enthusiast before AMC bought Jeep, he owned several World War II models. At retirement, he mentioned that he had owned \\"400 or 500\\" cars. Teague's collection included a rare AMX/3. It was donated to the San Diego Automotive Museum along with most of his papers. Awards * Chilton's Automotive Industries magazine named Teague the 1976 \\"Man of the Year\\" for his designs and work on the AMC Pacer. In the award's 12-year history, this was the first time an automotive stylist was so honored. * Teague was honored with the EyesOn Design 1999 \\"Lifetime Design Achievement Award\\" for his accomplishments as an automotive designer. Family Teague married his wife Marian A. Rose (1927-) in 1950. He had three children: Richard B. (\\"Rick\\", 1953-2002), Jeff (1956-2016), and daughter Lisa (Scarpelli). Jeff Teague was also an industrial designer and established two automotive and product design services firms: \\"Teague Design\\" and \\"JTDNA Design\\". Jeff was quoted as that he didn't \\"long for the vehicles of his father's days\\", but had sketched updated versions of his father's designs including the AMX/3. Death Teague died on 5 May 1991 after suffering a long illness.

It is serviced by NSW TrainLink Hunter line services from Newcastle. Most services terminate at Telarah with a limited number continuing to Dungog. Just north of the station, the North Coast line becomes single track. Both lines from Maitland are signalled for bidirectional working with trains able to arrive or leave via either line. A disused freight yard is located south of the station.

The Pope was forced to make peace with the Duchy of Spoleto to save Naples.R.A.

Foulke however dates this to 594, while noting that the historian Thomas Hodgkin dates this to 593 (History of the Lombards, p. 155n .2) The Lombard King Agilulf, noticing this, crossed into central Italy and even threatened Rome. Frustrated with the lack of support he received from the Exarch (R.A. Markus describes him as a \\"large thorn in Gregory's side\\"),Markus, Gregory the Great, p. 105 the Pope tried to circumvent Romanus' authority by appealing to the Byzantine Emperor Maurice in 595, but this proved fruitless, given the fact that Maurice saw more value in maintaining a link between Ravenna and the Balkans, where he kept the Avars and Slavs at bay. Romanus died soon after this, and was succeeded by Callinicus, who proved to be more conciliatory to Pope Gregory.

Hartnup disease (also known as \\"pellagra-like dermatosis\\" and \\"Hartnup disorder\\") is an autosomal recessive metabolic disorder affecting the absorption of nonpolar amino acids (particularly tryptophan that can be, in turn, converted into serotonin, melatonin, and niacin). Niacin is a precursor to nicotinamide, a necessary component of NAD+. The causative gene, SLC6A19, is located on chromosome 5. It is named after the English family, Hartnup, who suffered from this disease. Signs and symptoms Hartnup disease manifests during infancy with variable clinical presentation: failure to thrive, photosensitivity, intermittent ataxia, nystagmus, and tremor. Nicotinamide is necessary for neutral amino acid transporter production in the proximal renal tubules found in the kidney, and intestinal mucosal cells found in the small intestine. Therefore, a symptom stemming from this disorder results in increased amounts of amino acids in the urine. Pellagra, a similar condition, is also caused by low nicotinamide; this disorder results in dermatitis, diarrhea, and dementia. Hartnup disease is a disorder of amino acid transport in the intestine and kidneys; otherwise, the intestine and kidneys function normally, and the effects of the disease occur mainly in the brain and skin. Symptoms may begin in infancy or early childhood, but sometimes they begin as late as early adulthood. Symptoms may be triggered by sunlight, fever, drugs, or emotional or physical stress. A period of poor nutrition nearly always precedes an attack. The attacks usually become progressively less frequent with age. Most symptoms occur sporadically and are caused by a deficiency of niacinamide. A rash develops on parts of the body exposed to the sun. Mental retardation, short stature, headaches, unsteady gait, and collapsing or fainting are common. Psychiatric problems (such as anxiety, rapid mood changes, delusions, and hallucinations) may also result. Causes Hartnup disease is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. Heterozygotes are normal. Consanguinity is common. The failure of amino-acid transport was reported in 1960 from the increased presence of indoles (bacterial metabolites of tryptophan) and tryptophan in the urine of patients as part of a generalized aminoaciduria of the disease. The excessive loss of tryptophan from malabsorption was the cause of the pellagra like symptoms. From studies on ingestion of tryptophan it seemed that there was a generalized problem with amino-acid transport.Milne, M.D., Crawford, M.A., Girao, C.B. and Loughridge, L. (1961) The metabolic disorder of the Hartnup disease. Q. J. Med. 29: 407-421 In 2004, a causative gene, SLC6A19, was located on band 5p15.33. SLC6A19 is a sodium-dependent and chloride-independent neutral amino acid transporter, expressed predominately in the kidneys and intestine. Diagnosis The defective gene controls the absorption of certain amino acids from the intestine and the reabsorption of those amino acids in the kidneys. Consequently, a person with Hartnup disease cannot absorb amino acids properly from the intestine and cannot reabsorb them properly from tubules in the kidneys. Excessive amounts of amino acids, such as tryptophan, are excreted in the urine. The body is thus left with inadequate amounts of amino acids, which are the building blocks of proteins. With too little tryptophan in the blood, the body is unable to make a sufficient amount of the B-complex vitamin niacinamide, particularly under stress when more vitamins are needed. In Hartnup disease, urinary excretion of proline, hydroxyproline, and arginine remains unchanged, differentiating it from other causes of generalized aminoaciduria, such as Fanconi syndrome. With urine chromatography, increased levels of neutral amino acids (e.g., glutamine, valine, phenylalanine, leucine, asparagine, citrulline, isoleucine, threonine, alanine, serine, histidine, tyrosine, tryptophan) and indican are found in the urine. Increased urinary Indican can be tested by Obermeyer test. Treatment A high-protein diet can overcome the deficient transport of neutral amino acids in most patients. Poor nutrition leads to more frequent and more severe attacks of the disease, which is otherwise asymptomatic. All patients who are symptomatic are advised to use physical and chemical protection from sunlight: avoid excessive exposure to sunlight, wear protective clothing, and use chemical sunscreens with a SPF of 15 or greater. Patients also should avoid other aggravating factors, such as photosensitizing drugs, as much as possible. In patients with niacin deficiency and symptomatic disease, daily supplementation with nicotinic acid or nicotinamide reduces both the number and severity of attacks. Neurologic and psychiatric treatment is needed in patients with severe central nervous system involvement.

Yoffe served as a squad leader in one of the squads, acting as Lt. Michael Grove second in command. During World War II he served as a captain in the British Artillery Corps from 1940 until 1944. During the 1948 war he was a battalion commander in the Golani brigade. On 12 May his battalion captured Beisan during Operation Gideon. During the Suez Crisis he commanded Brigade 9 of the IDF. Between 1957 and 1958 he headed the training department and was commander of the officers' school. In 1958 he was appointed commander of the Southern Command, and in 1962 switched to the Northern Command. After being demobilised in 1964, he was recalled to service during the Six-Day War. He commanded a troop division in Egypt during the attack on the Sinai Peninsula, through Wadi Haroudin, an area impassable to the Israeli tanks. His army captured the Bir-Lafhan junction, effectively preventing the Egyptian army from calling for reinforcements. Avraham Yoffe and his four brigades on the Egyptian front avoided any areas of heavy enemy concentration and rushed to the passes; in fact, he traversed terrain that was unguarded because the Egyptians believed that tanks could not cross over dunes. Then, General Israel Tal's elite tank division and General Sharon would follow behind, forcing the Egyptians back into a deathtrap that was guaranteed to wipe out the third of their army that resided in the Sinai. The basis of the plan was for Yoffe to attack the Egyptians from the flank, and drive them to retreat into the Mitla Pass, where Sharon and Tal would wipe them out. As was seen through the first four days of the war, when Israel and Egypt were locked in combat, this plan succeeded beyond expectations, forcing the Egyptian retreat. On the eve of the first day of fighting, after intense battles, Tal's forces reached El-Arish and Sharon's division prevailed in the most important encounter in north Sinai in the Battle of Abu-Ageila. Meanwhile, Yoffe's division advanced on the Egyptian defenses and captured the Bir-Lafhan junction. By the end of the first day, part of Tal's division headed north to the Gaza Strip, and by 7 June the IDF captured Gaza City. On the fourth day of the war, 8 June 1967, the Egyptian forces were defeated. General Tal's division conquered Qantara on the banks of the Suez Canal and continued south along the canal in order to join up with the main force of the division which continued from Bir Gifgafa to the Suez Canal in the Ismailiya sector. South of them, General Yoffe's division also continued towards the canal along two axes in the Suez sector, while another force of his division continued on another route to Ras-Sudar on the Gulf of Suez, south of the Canal. From there, the force continued south along the Gulf of Suez and reached Abu- Zenima, where it met up with the paratroopers coming from E-Tur. General Yoffe had an important role in discovery of Bar Kokhba letter in a cave in Judaean Desert. He participated in the archaeological exploration with Yigael Yadin in a cave earlier plundered by Bedouin and researched by another archaeological team. Yoffe suggested use of advanced military equipment, which resulted in discovery of buried artifacts. That find is among the most important for study of the Bar Kokhba revolt against Romans.Yadin, Yigael. (1971).

Tel Aviv: Japhet Press. =Political career= Yoffe was one of the founders of the Movement for Greater Israel, and as the organisation merged into it, subsequently joined the Likud. He was elected to the Knesset on the Likud list in 1973, and was a member of the influential Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee and Finance Committee. He lost his seat in 1977.

He was born in Zozan in Greater Khorasan in Samanid-ruled Persia (modern Khaf, Razavi Khorasan Province, Iran). Hamza is considered the founder of the Druze and the primary author of the Druze manuscripts. Life After spending the first twenty years of his life in Samanid-ruled Persia, Hamza emigrated to Egypt and became known in the Fatimid Government as Hamza al-FƒÅtimƒ´ \\"Hamza the Fatimid\\". He arrived in Cairo (modern Egypt) just as the Fatimid Caliph Al-·∏§ƒÅkim built the House of Knowledge, which became one of the main cultural centers of the Fatimid state.Hamza Ibn Ali From Book one of the Tawheed Faith By the American Druze Society In a very short period of time, Hamza became a close associate of al-·∏§ƒÅkim and the Caliph appointed him Head of Letters and Correspondence. Hamza took as his headquarters the Raydan Mosque, which was located outside the walls of Cairo. This mosque became the center where Hamza organized a new missionary movement. In May 1017, al-·∏§ƒÅkim issued a decree naming Hamza the imƒÅm of \\"the Monotheists\\" (al-Muwahhid≈´n) immediately after declaring the beginning of the Divine call. Hamza demonstrated brilliant leadership for four years under al-·∏§ƒÅkim‚Äôs direction. Al-·∏§ƒÅkim granted Hamza the freedom to preach this new reformist doctrine openly. Public resistance to Hamza's teachings increased as he spoke against corruption, polygamy, remarriage of divorcees and other social customs as well as his theological disputes with other prominent Ismaeli leaders. Hamza and ad-Darazƒ´ During this external resistance, an internal rivalry arose between Hamza and one of his subordinates, ad-Darazƒ´. Ad-Darazƒ´ deviated from the essence of the movement‚Äôs message and falsified the writings of Hamza to present al-·∏§ƒÅkim as divine. Ad- Darazƒ´ had hoped that al-·∏§ƒÅkim would favor him over Hamza, but instead there was public opposition to his teachings. Ad-Darazƒ´ then redirected the public‚Äôs resistance by declaring that he had acted on Hamza's instructions. Consequently, instead of attacking ad-Darazƒ´, the crowds turned against Hamza and his associates, who were at Ridyan Mosque at the time. Although al-·∏§ƒÅkim executed ad-Darazƒ´ for heresy and repudiated his teachings, many years later observers attributed the Druze doctrine to ad-Darazƒ´ and do not mention Hamza at all. After the execution of ad-Darazƒ´ and his collaborators, Hamza continued his preaching activities for two more years. Few medieval chroniclers of the time not only failed to make the distinction between Druzes and Darazƒ´s but attributed ad-Darazƒ´‚Äôs doctrine to the followers of Hamza and argued that Hakim supported ad-Darazƒ´‚Äôs ideas. Other historians have reported that it was Hamza who was subordinate to ad-Darazƒ´, and still others have referred to Hamza and Darazi as the same person: Hamza ad-Darazƒ´. As a consequence, the name ‚ÄúDruze‚Äù became synonymous with the reform movement. Despite the ironic and misleading origins of the sect‚Äôs name, the title ‚ÄúDruze‚Äù never occurs in the Druze manuscripts of the 11th century. After the execution of Darazi and his collaborators, Hamza continued his preaching activities for two more years. Many modern scholars have written that Hamza's and ad-Darazƒ´'s ideology was the same, which is preaching the literal divinity of al-·∏§ƒÅkim,Minorities in the Middle East: A History of Struggle and Self- expression - Page 95 by Mordechai Nisan The Druze in the Middle East: Their Faith, Leadership, Identity and Status - Page 41 by Nissim Dana Encyclopaedic Survey of Islamic Culture - Page 94 by Mohamed Taher whom they say supported their claims. Such uncertainty is caused by the historical ambiguity of that era and the secretive, esoteric aspect of the Druze faith. Occultation During the same year that al-·∏§ƒÅkim disappeared in 1021, Hamza went into retreat and delegated the third leading figure, Baha'ud-Dƒ´n as-Samuqƒ´ (\\"al- Muqtana Baha‚Äôud-Dƒ´n\\") to continue the missionary movement. Baha‚Äôud-Dƒ´n continued public preaching with the approval of Hamza, who was in a disclosed location known only to Baha‚Äôud-Dƒ´n and few other missionaries. Preaching was halted after the Druze sect was closed in 1043 by Baha‚Äôud-Dƒ´n.

Publication history Stilt-Man first appeared in Daredevil #8 (June 1965). He is a criminal wearing an impenetrable suit of armor with powerful telescopic legs (useful for high- story heists). In addition to being one of Daredevil's most enduring arch- foes, he has appeared as an adversary for heroes more equally matched to his power level, such as Iron Man and Thor. Fictional character biography =Wilbur Day= Wilbur Day was born in New York City. As a scientist, inventor, and engineer, he was employed by Carl Kaxton who invented a hydraulic ram device. Wilbur stole Kaxton's designs and used them to engineer a pair of extremely long, telescopic metal legs, which allowed him to tower high over the ground. He incorporated these hydraulic stilts into an armored battlesuit, which he created for use in robberies as the professional criminal Stilt-Man. He battled Daredevil, and was seemingly shrunk into nothingness when he was accidentally hit by an experimental molecular condenser ray.Daredevil #8 His return from the limbo-like \\"microverse\\" was later recounted, and he attempted to help Leap-Frog escape from custody. Stilt-Man was defeated by Daredevil again, but was helped to escape by the Masked Marauder.Daredevil #26 Stilt-Man teamed with the Masked Marauder in an attempt to trap Daredevil; however, he battled Spider-Man and was defeated by Daredevil.Daredevil #27 His escape from Daredevil aided by Electro was later recounted. Stilt-Man teamed with Electro, Matador, Leap-Frog, and Gladiator to form the original Emissaries of Evil and battle Daredevil.Daredevil Annual #1 Stilt-Man was later hired by mobsters to kill district attorney candidate Foggy Nelson, and battled Daredevil once again.Daredevil #48 He disguised himself as Stunt-Master, and attacked Daredevil on a Hollywood movie set.Daredevil #67 In San Francisco, he kidnapped his former employer Carl Kaxton and his daughter, to force him to recreate his molecular condenser. However, Stilt-Man battled and was defeated by Daredevil and the Black Widow.Daredevil #102 Besides Stilt-Man's long, unsuccessful career against Daredevil, he encountered other superheroes in the meantime. He was hired by Los Angeles mobsters to kill the Falcon, and in the process stole various weapons and devices from the Trapster.Captain America #191 He robbed a Los Angeles bank, and battled Black Goliath. He teleported Black Goliath and his companions to an alien planet using the Z-ray weapon.Black Goliath #4 Stilt- Man attacked Black Goliath at Champions headquarters in search of an alien power source. He battled the Champions, and his Z-ray weapon was destroyed by Darkstar, but he managed to escape from the Champions.Champions #11-12 He was later freed from prison by Blastaar and F.A.U.S.T., and given a special new battlesuit constructed of secondary adamantium with additional weaponry. He stole some radioactive isotopes, and battled Thor, but lost the fight and was stripped of his suit by the victorious Thunder God, who confiscated it.Thor #269 Stilt-Man was hired to kidnap assistant District Attorney Maxine Lavender. He was waylaid in his civilian identity by Turk Barrett, a small- time crook and an even greater loser than Day, who cold-cocked Day, stole his armor, and took on the Stilt-Man identity. Turk contacted the Kingpin and offered to become his new assassin, only to be refused, being told \\"It does not matter what armor or weapons you may have acquired, Turk. You are an idiot. I do not employ idiots.\\" Enraged by Turk's audacity, Day contacted Daredevil and informed him of a weakness in the armor. Thanks to Day's information, Daredevil easily disabled the auto-gyroscopes necessary for the armor to keep its balance and brought Turk down.Daredevil #186 Day later modified the armor to prevent Daredevil from using this newfound knowledge against him. Stilt-Man sought to regain his reputation by defeating Spider- Man. He turned an automated Cordco factory against Spider-Man, but when Spider-Man saved his life, Stilt-Man returned the favor by not taking the opportunity to kill him.Amazing Spider-Man #237 Stilt-Man continued to make sporadic appearances in various Marvel comics, wherein he has continued his criminal career and fought several superheroes, but without much success. One of his most prominent appearances during this time was during the Iron Man storyline \\"Armor Wars\\", where he was one of the many armored super-villains whose armors had been secretly upgraded with technology stolen from Tony Stark; Iron Man quickly defeated the villain in their confrontation by throwing one of his own hydraulic legs at him to knock him out.Iron Man #225 Stilt-Man later attempted to kill District Attorney Blake Tower for sending him to prison, but was captured by She-Hulk.Sensational She-Hulk #4 Stilt-Man was among the villains assembled by Doctor Doom to attack the Fantastic Four in Washington, D.C. during the Acts of Vengeance. Even though he had several other villains with him, he failed miserably.Fantastic Four #336 He was also among the villains who attempted to attack the Avengers at the site of their reconstructed mansion, but was foiled by the construction workers.Avengers Annual #19 (1990) In the 2006 series Heroes for Hire, a version of Stilt-Man's armor can be found in a police storehouse with other villains' equipment under their names. The armor seen here is labeled \\"Case: NYC v. Turk (\\"Loser\\")\\".,Heroes for Hire #12 (2006) and is used by Scorpion during her battle with Paladin. Later, Daredevil's secret identity of Matt Murdock was exposed by a local newspaper, with Murdock denying the allegations. On hearing of this news, Wilbur visited the law offices of Nelson and Murdock, announcing he was sick of the whole ordeal and that he was retiring as Stilt-Man. He left his armor in a suitcase on Murdock's desk, and was forcibly removed when he began yelling his paranoid conclusion that Murdock was the real Kingpin. Murdock then jokingly asked his law partner, Foggy Nelson, if he would like to be the next Stilt-Man, an offer he quickly declined.Daredevil vol. 2 #41 During this period, Day romanced and eventually married Circus of Crime member Princess Python. Then, when the Superhero Registration Act offered Day a chance at redemption, he signed up with the government and was outfitted with a new suit of armor to serve as a law enforcer during the Civil War. Unfortunately for Day, one of his assignments led him into conflict with the Punisher. Both were tracking a convicted child pornographer who was already in FBI custody. The Punisher paralyzes Stilt-Man with a M72 LAW, and then shoots him at point-blank range, killing him. The pornographer is killed moments later.Punisher War Journal vol. 2 #1 Day's funeral was held in the Bar With No Name, and was attended by his fellow also-rans of the crime world. Sadness turned to remembrance, which turned into high spirits, which eventually led to a full-scale fight breaking out. The appearance of Spider-Man put an end to the violence, but the bar was then promptly blown up by the Punisher in an attempt to kill all the villains inside.Punisher War Journal vol. 2 #4 It was later mentioned that \\"they all had to get their stomachs pumped and be treated for third-degree burns.\\"She-Hulk vol. 2 #17 During the Dead No More: The Clone Conspiracy storyline, Stilt-Man is among the supervillains cloned by Miles Warren and his company New U Technologies.Clone Conspiracy #2 Stilt-Man later appears in San Francisco where he fights the Superior Spider-Man, who has recently relocated there.Superior Spider-Man Vol. 2 #1 =Unnamed= During Day's absence from the world of costumed crime, an as-yet-unnamed criminal acquired the Stilt-Man armor. After upgrading its telescoping abilities, this Stilt-Man was defeated by Daredevil and Luke Cage. The fight only lasted as long as it did because Daredevil was afraid of knocking the villain out at his current height as the fall would have killed him.Marvel Team-Up #9 (June, 2005) He was next seen being defeated by Ms. Marvel.Ms. Marvel #1 (May, 2006) Stilt-Man later fought both Daredevil and the Superior Spider-Man (Doctor Octopus' mind in Spider-Man's body).Daredevil #22 (January, 2013) =Michael Watts= A third Stilt-Man was chosen by a gang of small-time petty thugs. Michael Watts claimed to know a guy who knows a guy who knows a guy that leads to the connection of the Tinkerer who apparently upgraded the suit before his last arrest. Punisher was aware of the gang's actions. But after some convincing by the Rhino, Frank let Watts live who quotes \\"You punish the guilty Frank, not the stupid.\\" Watts believes he and his gang will rise to great things since the Hood's coming to power over the supervillains.Punisher War Journal vol. 2 #26 =Callie Ryan= A fourth unidentified female variant appears in The Amazing Spider-Man #611, calling herself \\"Lady Stilt-Man\\". Deadpool defeats her by removing a manhole cover, causing one of her legs to fall in, and her other to step onto a high heel attached to the top of a truck. She does not appear to be connected to any of the other Stilt-Men, and claims she is using the name as an \\"homage\\". This version is more clumsy and uncoordinated, and Spider-Man himself says she is \\"trying too hard.\\"Amazing Spider-Man #611 In the \\"Villains for Hire\\" miniseries, Lady Stilt-Man reappears as a member of Misty Knight's villain subgroup for Heroes for Hire going by just \\"Stilt-Man\\".Villains for Hire #2 She later defects to Purple Man's side.Villains for Hire #3 Lady Stilt-Man is later recruited by Max Fury to join the Shadow Council's incarnation of the Masters of Evil.Secret Avengers #29 Lady Stilt-Man later appears in a hospital where she is visited by Misty Knight. In this appearance, it is revealed that Lady Stilt-Man's real name is Callie Ryan. Lady Stilt-Man is revealed to be a victim of a scandal over an embarrassing sex video among other female heroes and villains. Though Misty clears her name when it is discovered that the videos were all a hoax, it is later mentioned that Lady Stilt-Man was caught committing a crime.Captain America: Sam Wilson #16 Powers and abilities Day is a competent, although perhaps not genius level, engineer and inventor, with degrees in physics and mechanical engineering. He is also a moderately talented disguise artist. Day often uses a gun capable of producing a potent stun gas. He has also used gas grenades, a charged-particle beam blaster, a vacuum device, an electrified exterior for his suit, various devices stolen from the Trapster, and various conventional weaponry. Stilt-Man designed and constructed his battle suit, which increases his strength tenfold, enabling him to lift (press) approximately .Official Handbook Of the Marvel Universe (1986 series) #17 The suit's telescopic legs contain hydraulic rams which allow them to be used as battering rams, able to stretch up to 250' and also allow him to walk up to . His legs are also coated with a silicone compound that prevents Spider-Man's webbing from adhering to them. Carl Kaxton designed the hydraulic ram device, but Wilbur Day designed the hydraulic stilts and weaponry as part of his battlesuit. Other versions =House of M= Stilt- Man is shown as a human using technological equipment who was arrested by the FBI's Brotherhood. =Marvel Zombies= In Marvel Zombies Stilt-Man is seen a part of the horde of zombified super-villains attacking Galactus when he arrives upon Earth. The World-Devourer is brought down by the combined efforts of the Power Cosmic Zombies, but the super-villains try to claim the body and a scrap ensues. A zombified Stilt-Man appears in the limited series, Marvel Zombies 3. He is among the group of zombies guarding the compound run by the zombified Kingpin. He is referred to as \\"... a roving sentry with unlimited sightlines\\". He confronts Machine Man who is attempting to escape the compound. The android, also on stilts, teases Stilt-Man with how their similarities might have made them friends. Stilt-Man wonders if Machine Man is being serious; he is not and Stilt-Man is quickly destroyed.Marvel Zombies 3 #2-3 (2009) Another Stilt-Man is seen in another zombie-infested dimension, his body had been picked clean and left to lie in the debris of New York for decades.Marvel Zombies Return: Avengers (September 2009) In other media =Television= * The Wilbur Day version of Stilt-Man made a guest appearance on the Iron Man episode \\"Armor Wars\\" Pt. 1 voiced by Dorian Harewood.

It was directed by Al Reinert with music by Brian Eno.For All Mankind: Is the Moon Landing Cinema?  Brows Held High by KyleKallgrenBBH on YouTube The film concentrates on the beauty of the Earth as seen from space with the experiences of Apollo crew members and mission control staff played over original mission footage. Background Reinert began interviewing (mostly retired and unseen in the film) NASA astronauts in 1976. It was from these interviews that the majority of the voices heard in the documentary appear. The idea for the documentary film began in 1979 after Reinert researched a story about the Apollo program for Texas Monthly and learned that huge amounts of footage shot by astronauts had been archived by NASA without ever being seen by the public. Reinert and editor Susan Korda sifted through six million feet of film footage, and 80 hours of NASA interviews to create the documentary. Although he initially thought that making a film of the missions would be relatively straightforward it would take ten years before the film was released. To copy the original films held at the Johnson Space Center, Reinert had to take an optical printer and scan each frame from the original 16mm film and enlarge to 35mm. To get the 80 minutes of film used in the documentary took Reinert 18 months of copying. Reinert also used footage from the Project Gemini including Ed White's spacewalk from Gemini 4, the film of rocket stage separation is test footage shot during earlier missions and a shot used to represent Trans Lunar Injection (TLI) is in fact footage of a Gemini mission re-entry. Reinert's DVD commentary also explains that although the documentary purports to show a single Moon mission, it is in fact a collage of footage from all six successful Apollo missions. An initial release of the film called Apollo had no narration, just the soundtrack and original recordings from the missions. Audience response was lukewarm and Reinert updated the documentary with the interviews he had conducted with the astronauts in the 1970s plus material held in the NASA archives. The final film included just under 80 minutes of NASA footage. The documentary focuses on the impact of the missions on the astronauts and their experiences as well as some members of mission control. Thirteen of the original Apollo astronauts were interviewed by Reinert. Among those providing narration are Jim Lovell (Apollo 8 and Apollo 13), Michael Collins (Apollo 11), Charles Conrad (Apollo 12), Jack Swigert (Apollo 13), and Ken Mattingly (Apollo 16). Documentary's title The title comes from President John F. Kennedy's Address to Rice University on the Nation's Space Effort, 12 September 1962, but is slightly altered from \\"for all people\\" to \\"for all mankind\\": > The exploration of space will go ahead, whether we join it or not, and it is > one of the greatest adventures of all time ... We set sail on this new sea > because there is new knowledge to be gained and new rights to be won, and > they must be won and used **for all people** ... We choose to go to the > moon. We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, > not because they are easy, but because they are hard .... The phrase was altered in the film's audio of Kennedy's speech as well. The director dubbed in \\"mankind\\" from a different Kennedy speech. The term 'for all mankind' also appears on the lunar plaque left by the Apollo 11 astronauts: > Here men from the planet Earth first set foot upon the Moon, July 1969, A.D. > We came in peace for all mankind. Specific views Several unusual or memorable views are included: * The fires of the Bedouin tribes in the Sahara desert, seen as dots of light in the extreme darkness. * Sunrise over the edge of the Earth. * A space-walk floating in silence over the Earth, despite travelling at 25,000 miles per hour. * A floating tape recorder providing music to the astronauts during periods of weightlessness ... in particular when playing the theme from the 1968 film, 2001: A Space Odyssey. * The first picture of the Earth seen as a whole circle from space \\"floating in a blackness beyond perception\\". * Trying to prevent food from floating off during meals. * The first close-up pictures of the Moon. * Travelling around the far side of the Moon, including the \\"Earthrise\\" as our planet came back into view. * The Apollo Lunar Module calmly drifting down at a low angle to the surface of the Moon, then burning its engines for a more vertical landing. * Touchdown in the Sea of Tranquility: \\"The Eagle has landed.\\" * The first footstep onto the Moon by Neil Armstrong. * David Scott dropping a feather and a hammer together on the Moon to prove Galileo correct, that both hit the ground together if there is no atmosphere. * Erecting the Stars and Stripes on the surface of the Moon. * Gathering rocks and soil samples from the surface of the Moon. * An astronaut tripping and speculating on his vulnerability should the suit be ruptured. Release The original version of the documentary film had no narration, and simply featured 35mm footage of the Apollo moon missions collected together roughly chronologically, and set to Brian Eno's soundtrack as it appears on the album. Although the film had a limited theatrical runs at art house cinemas in some US cities, audience response was lukewarm. The filmmakers still felt the film could do better if it reached a wider audience, and so they re-edited the film, added commentaries from the Apollo astronauts and ground crew, re-structured the music, and re-titled the film in the process. Various edits of the film were shown to test audiences for further refining. As all this was going on, the film's release was delayed until 1989. = Home media = For All Mankind has been released by The Criterion Collection on DVD and Blu-ray Disc. The title features a commentary track by director Al Reinert and Eugene A. Cernan, commander of Apollo 17. The Blu-ray version also has \\"behind the scenes\\" footage, explaining the artistic concept and how original NASA footage was selected for the film. The title has two subtitle tracks; the first shows the name of each mission and the name of each person shown on screen; the second subtitle track contains traditional subtitles for the hard- of-hearing, specifying the name of the person doing the narration. Soundtrack The film's original score was written, produced, and performed by Brian Eno, his brother Roger and Daniel Lanois in 1983 (for a feature- length documentary movie called Apollo, later re-titled For All Mankind). It was released as an album entitled Apollo: Atmospheres and Soundtracks in 1983.

Life Palmer was born in Pompey, New York. He was the second of nine children. He showed early artistic promise, and pursued his father's trade of carpentry. Palmer married Matilda Alton in 1839 and had a son, but both mother and child died soon after; he remarried, to Mary Jean Seamans, in 1840, and settled in Utica, New York. In his leisure moments as a carpenter Palmer started by carving portraits in cameo, and earned the encouragement of Thomas R. Walker, a local art patron in Utica, who introduced him to prominent artists in New York City. By 1849, Palmer had relocated to Albany with his family and had transitioned from cameo-cutting to large-scale sculpture. He worked in a primarily neoclassical style. Palmer mounted an exhibition of twelve of his sculptures, known as \\"the Palmer Marbles,\\" at the National Academy of Design in 1856, aiding his rise to prominence. His major works include The White Captive (1858) in the permanent collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, Peace in Bondage (1863), Angel at the Sepulchre (1865), in Albany, New York, a bronze statue of Chancellor Robert R. Livingston (1874), in Statuary Hall, Capitol, Washington, D.C., and many portrait busts. Palmer died at his home in Albany on March 9, 1904, and is buried in Albany Rural Cemetery. Palmer admired the work of William Cullen Bryant, Asher B. Durand, and Frederic Edwin Church. Palmer was a friend of Church, and his work is represented in the collection at Olana, Church's home in Hudson, New York. The Albany Institute of History & Art also has significant holdings of Palmer's sculpture. Palmer's son, Walter Launt Palmer (1854‚Äì1932), was also an artist best known for his paintings of winter scenes.

US perspective Given their initial lack of experience, workers' earnings start out low. Earnings peak when workers hit middle age, then begin to fall as retirement approaches. But peak earnings now occur later in life and reach a higher level. In the 1970s the peak earning years were between 35 and 44 for people with only an elementary school education. However people who graduated from high school and college had a peak income between 45 and 54. In 2009 peak income occurred between the ages of 40-55. Twenty years ago, those in their peak earning years took home about twice as much as workers between the ages of 20 and 24. Now they earn more than three times as much.

Cypress Creek High School. Retrieved on May 24, 2019. \\"Physical Address 9815 Grant Road Houston, TX 77070\\" Cypress Creek, which serves grades 9 through 12, is a part of the Cypress-Fairbanks Independent School District. Cypress Creek High School opened in the fall of 1977. The first graduating class was in 1980. Over the years, several additions were made to expand the building. In 2004, a major renovation project was passed by Proposition 1 from the 2004 Bond Referendum. All of the interior and much of the exterior is to be remodeled, and new classrooms are to be added. The project was expected to cost approximately $51 million and was completed in 2010. The new renovations, included a new wing in the building, made room for 50 to 100 additional classes and renovated the old parts of the school dating back to the 1970s. As well, a \\"Black Box Theatre\\", a Multi-Purpose Room (nicknamed the \\"Lego Gym\\") and 6 Assistant Principal/Counselor offices, which were spread around the school, were included in the additions. Cypress Creek features a CISCO Networking Academy class. Students may commute from other Cypress-Fairbanks high schools to take the course. Additionally, in the school year 2010-2011, an ROTC program was finally added to the school after years of students commuting to other high school campuses to participate in the programs. Academics For the 2018-2019 school year, the school received a B grade from the Texas Education Agency, with an overall score of 89 out of 100. The school received a B grade in two domains, School Progress (score of 88) and Closing the Gaps (score of 86), and an A grade in Student Achievement (score of 90). The school received five of the seven possible distinction designations for Academic Achievement in Science, Academic Achievement in Mathematics, Academic Achievement in English Language Arts/Reading, Top 25% Comparative Academic Growth, and Top 25%: Comparative Closing the Gaps. The school did not receive distinction designations for Academic Achievement in Social Studies and Post-Secondary Readiness. =Academy system= Along with the renovations in the 2010‚Äì2011 school year, Cypress Creek HS implemented a new \\"Academy\\" System based on 16 career pathways as deemed by the organization Achieve Texas, and based on different high schools around the state of Texas and the Country (including nearby Atascocita High School). Administration at Cy Creek combined many of these academies to form 6 that students can choose from. They include: * Academy A: AIM (Agriculture, Architecture, Industrial and Manufacturing) **Programs of Study: Architectural Designer, Interior Design, Agriculture Welding, Animal Science, Transportation Servicing and Maintenance, Heavy Industrial Metal (welding), Environmental Service Systems, Veterinary Science, Warehousing and Distribution, Plant and Animal Technology * Academy B: Business and Finance ** Programs of Study: Administrative and Information Support, Advertising & Sales Promotion Marketing, Banking & Related Services, eMarketing, Financial Management and Accounting, Management, Marketing. * Academy C: Education and Human Services **Programs of Study: Culinary Arts, Education-Teacher (Small Children and School-Age), Personal Care Services, Restaurant and Food Services (management), Therapeutic Services. * Academy D: Government, Law and Public Administration ** Programs of Study: Law Enforcement, Legal Services-Technical, Pre-Law, National Defense & Public Administration. * Academy E: STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) (the most popular academy) ** Programs of Study: Engineering Technician, Pre-Engineering, Health Science Biotechnology, Health Science Diagnostic Services and Health Information, Medical Support Services, Health Science Therapeutic Service/ Patient Care. * Academy F: Arts, Communication and Information Technology ** Programs of Study: Arts and Animation, Fine Arts (including Dance, Dramatic Arts, Musical, Vocal), Visual Arts (including Artist and Fashion Design), Interior Design, Journalism, Web and Digital Media, Computer Information Systems, Computer Systems Technician, Network Systems Engineering, Software Engineer, Technology Engineer, Radio/Television, Sound/Video/Film Production. Each academy includes one Counselor and one Assistant Principal to guide the students (that total approximately 400-600 in each academy) toward the career that interests them. Additionally, each staff member will follow approximately 15 students during the year to help the students if needed. However, changes to academies may be made at the end of each school year if the student feels like his/her future lies in a different pathway. With the new academies and the administration of Cy Creek trying to steer the campus into a new way of teaching to better prepare the students for their future, a new bell schedule was implemented in the 2010‚Äì2011 school year. On Mondays, Tuesdays and Fridays, the students attend their regular 7 classes with 6 minutes in between each class. However, Wednesdays and Thursdays implement a \\"Block Schedule\\" in order to get more information to the students in a longer class period. Wednesdays include 1st, 3rd, 5th and 7th periods as well as an advocacy period in which a teacher advises a group of students (all students share gender, grade and academy) in their high school career. On Thursdays, students attend 2nd, 4th and 6th periods and are released from the campus at 12:58 (instead of the normal 2:30). This new schedule was implemented in order to include the advocacy time, and to allow for training of teachers during the extra time after school on Thursdays, without extending teacher's working hours. Although the plan had been met with a surprise liking from the students and parents, the bell schedule was eventually reverted back to 7:20AM - 2:40PM for 5 days a week during the 2016-2017 school year. During the 2010‚Äì2011, 2011‚Äì2012, and 2012‚Äì2013 school years, the school will be expanding the academy program and changing it so that it fits the school the best. With the plan's implementation, the school has been awarded a grant for $500,000 in order to nurture the new program, and has been named a \\"High School that Works\\" (one of about 1000 nationwide and the only in Cy-Fair ISD). =Newsweek rankings= Cy Creek has repeatedly been rated as one of the top 1500 schools in America by Newsweek, with the 2009-2010 school year bringing it the rating 1487, just behind fellow Cy-Fair ISD school Langham Creek, the first time Langham Creek has ranked higher than Cy Creek in the Newsweek ratings.

Its brother fraternity is Alpha Gamma Omega. History Alpha Delta Chi was founded in 1925 at the University of California, Los Angeles by ten women. Their vision was to create a place where Christian women could participate in Greek life without compromising their beliefs, build strong friendships, and most of all, they wanted to create a place which would mirror Christ's love to their community. The sorority was originally named Areta, which means virtue. The sorority's purpose is to provide fellowship for Christian college women, to strengthen the spiritual lives of its members, to be a testimony for Christ on each campus. In 1929, Karin Anderson Dyer and Edith Bishop McAulay, two members of the Alpha chapter of Areta, were attending the University of California, Berkeley as graduate students. The two saw a need for the sorority and with the help of the Alpha chapter, they organized the Beta chapter on February 4, 1929. The first annual convention of Alpha Delta Chi was held in Berkeley, California, on April 6‚Äì7, 1939. At this meeting the National Association of Areta and the National Executive and Advisory Board were formed. The original name of the National Fraternity, Areta, was changed to Alpha Delta Chi at the June 1943 National Convention. A.D.X. currently has 18 active chapters across the nation, the newest of which is the Alpha Beta chapter at the University of Denver. Sorority Verse \\"For we all with unveiled face, reflecting as in a mirror the glory of the Lord, are transformed into the same image, from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord.\\" 2 Corinthians 3:18 The Aims and Purposes of Alpha Delta Chi * To strengthen the SPIRITUAL lives and testimonies of the members of the National Fraternity resulting in service and outreach to others. * To promote higher SCHOLASTIC standards among the members of the National Fraternity. * To provide SOCIAL fellowship among the university students living the Christian life and active in Christ's service.

John replaced Theodore II as exarch in 687. That same year, he took an active role in a disputed papal election. Bribed by the archdeacon Paschal, he demanded that the latter should be made pope. Conflict with another papal candidate, Theodore, seemed inevitable, but then a compromise candidate, Sergius I, was made pope. Paschal did not give up hope, however: he promised John a hundred pounds of gold in exchange for the papacy. John quickly came to Rome, but found that it would be too difficult to go against the majority. He therefore recognized Sergius, but demanded from the pope the hundred pounds of gold that Paschal had promised. Sergius protested, saying he had made no such agreement; when John did not give up his demands, he took the holy vessels of St. Peter's Basilica, claiming they were all he possessed. The local populace, becoming increasingly angry at the exarch, rallied to the pope and paid the sum demanded.This disputed election is described in the Liber Pontificalis. Raymond Davis (translator), The Book of Pontiffs (Liber Pontificalis), first edition (Liverpool: University Press, 1989), pp. 83f In 691 the Byzantine Emperor Justinian II sent Pope Sergius a series of canons approved by the Quinisext Council for his signature. Jeffrey Richards notes that Justinian had believed this would be a matter of routine, since his apocrisiarius had signed them. Since several of them were counter to the interests of the papacy, Sergius refused, and forbade them to be read out publicly. Negotiations over the canons failed to solve anything, so Justinian retaliated by sending a certain Zacharias to arrest him, as his predecessors Justinian I and Constans II had done with earlier popes.Jeffrey Richards, The Popes and the Papacy in the Early Middle Ages (London:Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1979), pp. 210f The result was disastrous for the exarchate. The imperial armies in Ravenna and Rome not only refused to cooperate, the army of Ravenna marched to Rome to defend Sergius, and were joined by soldiers of the Pentapolis. The soldiers reached Rome, surrounded the papal residence, and demanded to see the pope. Zacharias is said to have cowered under the pope's bed until Sergius himself allowed him to escape; in any case, the Pope was safe.Liber Pontificalis, pp. 84f The entire affair was an embarrassment to Byzantine authority in Italy, and undermined John's power. John was followed as exarch by Theophylactus around 702.

The dam is located, as the name implies, at the Whittier Narrows. It provides water conservation storage and is also the central element of the Los Angeles County Drainage Area (LACDA) flood control system. Its reservoir has a capacity of . The Whittier Narrows are a natural gap in the hills that form the southern boundary of the San Gabriel Valley of Southern California. Both the Rio Hondo, a tributary of the Los Angeles River, and the San Gabriel River flow through this gap and are impounded by the reservoir. The Pomona Freeway (CA-60) passes through the reservoir flood control basin and the San Gabriel River Freeway (I-605) passes along the eastern boundary of the basin. In September 2017, the United States Army Corps of Engineers officials warned local residents that the dam no longer met the agency‚Äôs 'tolerable-risk' guidelines and could fail in the event of a very large, very rare storm, similar to exceptionally intense California storms which occurred between December 1861 and January 1862, a so-called ARkStorm Authorization for the project construction is contained in the Flood Control Act of 18 August 1941 (PL 77-228) and the initial funds for construction were provided in the 1949 Appropriations Bill. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers completed construction of the dam in 1957. Flood control Whittier Narrows Dam Sign The purpose of the project is to collect runoff from the uncontrolled drainage areas upstream along with releases into the San Gabriel River from the Santa Fe Dam. The Rio Hondo outlet has four main outlet passages plus a small diversion passage. The San Gabriel outlet has nine large gates installed on top of a spillway. Dimensions are furnished in the table below. The \\"stand-by\\" position of the gates on the Rio Hondo outlet is wide open. On the San Gabriel side one gate is normally open about .5 ft (15 cm) with the remaining gates closed. The reservoir is normally empty, and a \\"crossover weir\\" within the reservoir keeps the flows from the Rio Hondo and the San Gabriel River separated. The natural flow to each river therefore normally passes through the dam unhindered. During the initial stages of a flood event, the gates on the Rio Hondo side are partially closed to build a water conservation pool. As long as the pool on the Rio Hondo side of the reservoir is below elevation 201.6 ft (61.4 m) NGVD29, releases are made to accommodate the capacity of the spreading grounds downstream along the Rio Hondo. The spreading grounds are operated by the Los Angeles County Department of Public Works to recharge the groundwater basin. Flow reaches the spreading grounds either directly by way of the diversion passage or from a diversion structure in the Rio Hondo downstream of the dam. Both the diversion passage direct from the dam and the diversion structure in the Rio Hondo are operated by the county. When the water conservation pool on the Rio Hondo side of the reservoir is exceeded, the releases to the Rio Hondo are increased to match inflow until either the capacity of the Rio Hondo or the Los Angeles River downstream are reached. If the water conservation pool on either side of the reservoir is exceeded, discharges on the San Gabriel side can be increased to approximately 5000 ft¬≥/s (142 m¬≥/s). The San Gabriel outlet has automatic spillway gates. When the pool in the reservoir exceeds flood control storage these gates will begin to open automatically. The top of the flood control storage pool is at elevation 228.5 ft (69.6 m) NGVD. The capacity of the Rio Hondo downstream from Whittier Narrows Dam is approximately 36,500 ft¬≥/s (1,034 m¬≥/s). The capacity of the Los Angeles River downstream of its confluence with the Rio Hondo is approximately 127,000 ft¬≥/s (3,596 m¬≥/s), and the capacity of the San Gabriel River downstream of the dam is approximately 13,000 ft¬≥/s (371 m¬≥/s).

Fascia supports and protects these structures. Osteopathy claims that this soft tissue can become restricted due to psychogenic disease, overuse, trauma, infectious agents, or inactivity, often resulting in pain, muscle tension, and corresponding diminished blood flow. The use of myofascial release as a treatment is not supported by good evidence; as a replacement for conventional treatment for cancer, it risks causing harm.  Effectiveness  The American Cancer Society states that \\"There is little scientific evidence available to support proponents' claims that myofascial release relieves pain or restores flexibility\\" and caution against using it as a substitute for conventional cancer treatment. The poor quality of research into the use of myofascial release for orthopaedic conditions precludes any conclusions being drawn about its usefulness for this purpose. In 2011, the UK Advertising Standards Authority upheld a complaint regarding the effectiveness claims published in an advertising leaflet produced by the Myofascial Release UK health care service. The ASA Council ruled that materials presented by Myofascial Release UK in support of the claims made in their ad were inadequate to establish a \\"body of robust scientific evidence\\" to substantiate Myofascial Release UK's range of claims. In addition, the ASA determined that the ad breached advertising rules by introducing a risk that readers might be discouraged from seeking other essential medical treatments. Reviews published in 2013 and 2015 evaluating evidence for MFR efficacy found that clinical trials that had been conducted varied in quality, technique, outcome measurements, and had mixed outcomes; the 2015 review noted: \\"it is time for scientific evidences on MFR to support its clinical use.\\" Another review concluded that the use of foam rollers or a roller massager before or after exercise for self-myofascial release appears to be helpful with regard to range of motion and soreness, but the optimal timing and duration of use requires further study.  History  The approach was promulgated as an alternative medicine concept by Andrew Taylor Still, inventor of osteopathy, and his early students. The exact phrase \\"myofascial release\\" was coined in the 1960s by Robert Ward, an osteopath who studied with Ida Rolf, the originator of Rolfing. Ward, along with physical therapist John Barnes, are considered the two primary founders of Myofascial Release.

Colors was intended to be the world‚Äôs first GPS video game, but due to Gizmondo‚Äôs bankruptcy, it was never officially released. However, the game leaked and distributed online in 2008. There was a mostly complete version of Colors that was circulated on the Internet. When first playing Colors, it appears the multiplayer game, called TurfWar, is offline. After a player gains 30,000 dollars, it unlocks. Another unlockable is the tag editor which allows players to spraypaint custom tags around the city. It is unlocked after beating a certain mission in the game. The multiplayer mode of the game does not function. On November 30, 2015, Carl Freer announced plans to re- release the game for iOS and Google Play.http://www.marketwired.com/press- release/carl-freer-launch-colors-ios-google-play-worlds-first-gps-based-open- world-shooter-2077804.htm Gameplay Gameplay in Colors is very similar to many popular third person shooter games, like Grand Theft Auto, Resident Evil 4, or Max Payne. Its targeting system is odd, in that you cannot manually target body parts like the head or arms, but instead, the reticle moves automatically, slowing down and becoming more precise depending on the player's movement. If the player strafes or moves more while targeting, the reticle wildly bobs around, making it difficult to aim and shoot accurately. The player may select a character at the beginning of the game. The characters differ in appearance. Two stats, health and stamina, are also presented. A button must be held to strafe, and due to the Gizmondo's lack of an analog stick, a button must also be pressed to activate running, though it must only be pressed once. The game's weapon selection is split into different types. There are rifles, shotguns, pistols, and explosives, as well as some improvised weapons like nailguns. There are no melee weapons, however, only ranged ones. In the game, the player can be caught by the police and taken to a prison cell with three people in it. Two of them offer to get the player out at a price, while one will offer assistance in exchange for sex rather than money. After that, the player is transported to the hospital and allowed to leave. Crimson City itself is mostly free roaming, but divided into several small areas with loading screens. The locales in the game include a train station (where the game begins and ends), a China Town, a Little Italy, a Little Mexico, a junk yard, some docks, and an area without a particular theme but with a man selling C4 explosives. Some of the highest paying missions are also in this area. Overall, there are about forty missions in the game, and no main story, so all of them are self-contained stories of the character's services to multiple people. Each boss has their own small story that is uncovered more, such as one female Spanish boss who is being followed around by a junkyard worker, and finally gets kidnapped by the worker, leaving the character to save her and kill him. =Story= The game takes place in the fictional Crimson City. The game contains little to no story and does not explain the reason why the main character is in the city, nor why he begins to commit crimes. The character is simply introduced by a vague CG intro arriving by train. The people the player works for include a pimp in the stereotypical purple suit and hat, a corrupt police officer, a gamut of gangsters, and many criminals fitting stereotypes of their race. During the game's missions, the player is given jobs such as hiding drugs for a cop, removing someone's life support plug, getting high on drugs and chasing a man in a rabbit suit through a maze-like building. The game ends with the main character leaving the city as ambiguously as he came in. After beating the game, the player is able to select a lot more character models to play as, including many of the denizens within Crimson City itself, such as the pizza seller, the drug rabbit, the gun dealer, Mr. Smith, who has some of the best stats in the game, and a medieval knight, which is never seen regularly in the game.

It is named after the Italian city of Piacenza. The base of the Piacenzian is at the base of magnetic chronozone C2An (the base of the Gauss chronozone and at the extinction of the planktonic forams Globorotalia margaritae and Pulleniatina primalis. The GSSP for the Piacenzian stage is at Punta Piccola on Sicily, Italy.Castradori et al.

(1998) Climate The Piacenzian was the last age before the Quaternary glaciations started to take hold in the Northern hemisphere. The ice sheet of Antarctica was also less prominent than today and sea levels were approximately twenty meters higher than the present. The global mean temperature was 2‚Äì3 ¬∞C warmer than the pre-industrial temperature. During the Mid-Piacenzian Warm Period the concentration of carbon dioxide peaked at approximately 389 ppm (in the range 381‚Äì427 ppm with 95% confidence), thus similar to the concentration during the 2010s. The Piacenzian can therefore be used as an analogue to the future climate and sea level to expect if the carbon dioxide concentration stabilizes at this level. In particular, the KM5c interglacial during the Mid-Piacenzian Warm Period occurred during an orbital configuration close to the current situation, with similar geographical distribution of solar insolation. de la Vega, E., Chalk, T.B., Wilson, P.A. et al.

Sci Rep 10, 11002 (2020). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-67154-8 Climate of the Piacenzian would have started as a somewhat wet and warm period in North America occurring just after a brief cooling period of the Zanclean. Deposition of sediments and mollusks of the Piacenzian correspond with the rise in sea level creating the Tamiami Subsea and Jackson Subsea of Florida, Duplin Subsea generally of South Carolina, and Yorktown Subsea of the Outer Banks and inland North Carolina. Dates have been established on the basis of the genera and species of mollusks found.Petuch, Edward J., Ph.D. Florida Atlantic University, Department of Geodsciences. Cenozoic Seas: The View From Eastern North America. CRC Press, Dec. 29, 2003. . Origin of the genus Homo The late Piacenzian may be when the genus Homo developed out of the ancestral genus Australopithecus. While the oldest known fossils unambiguously identified as Homo habilis date to just after the end of the Piacenzian (2.58 Ma), a fossilized jawbone that exhibits traits that are transitional between Australopithecus and Homo habilis was discovered in the Afar Triangle in 2015. The find was made by Ethiopian student Chalachew Seyoum at a site called Ledi-Geraru between the Mille and Awash rivers, in Afar Regional State (near ). Based on geological evidence from the Afar region, the individual would have lived just after a major climate shift, during which forests and waterways were rapidly replaced by arid savanna. Regarding the Afar region, and as stated in the journal Science: \\"Vertebrate fossils record a faunal turnover indicative of more open and probable arid habitats than those reconstructed earlier in this region, in broad agreement with hypotheses addressing the role of environmental forcing in hominin evolution at this time.\\" This interpretation is consistent with hypotheses that emphasize the savanna as the ancestral environment that shaped the evolution of early Homo and other hominins.

The PlayStation Portable version was released a year later under the title Gun: Showdown, this version features new side-missions, a multiplayer mode, and other additions that were not available in the console versions. During its first month, the game sold 225,000 copies across the four console systems for which it was initially released. The game had sold over 1.4 million units in the United States as of October 2008. It was well received by game critics and won several awards, including GameSpy's Xbox 360 Action Game of the Year. Gameplay Gunfights are an important feature of the game, with enemies ranging from outlaws to wild animals. Gun features an open world action role-playing game environment, including side- missions that add to the story. Players control the protagonist, Colton White, from a third-person perspective. Side-missions improve the player stats. Players can purchase upgrades using money obtained from these optional activities and by mining gold veins. While traveling from town to town, bandit attacks are frequent and players must either escape or defend themselves. Players can hunt and kill various animals like buffalo, wild horses, and even stray dogs and farm animals. The player can also cause mayhem within communities, but can attract attention from lawmakers and other gunslingers by doing so. They act as gunslingers protecting righteousness or seek reputation as they face resistance fighters, local lawmen, renegade soldiers and vengeful Apaches and Blackfoot. A Town Patience meter goes down every time a civilian is killed. Once the patience meter reaches zero, a showdown ensues between the player and the locals. Several minigames are included in Gun. As the player progresses through the game, they can choose to complete side missions, including poker tournaments, cattle herding, law enforcement, time trials and bounty hunting. =Combat= Players can enter a first person quick draw mode during gameplay. Players can wield a revolver and switch between rifles, shotguns, various explosives, and bows. There are a variety of types of arrows to choose from, including ordinary, flaming, and, if unlocked, explosive arrows. Throwing knives are available in Gun Showdown. Attacking and killing enemies fills up a Quickdraw gauge which, when activated, slows down time like bullet time, switches the game to a first-person perspective and gives the player unlimited ammunition for a short duration, allowing the player to take on a significant number of enemies. The player can switch from first person to third person overhead camera with certain weapons. There are two handheld explosives available in the game: dynamite and whiskey bombs. Dynamite explodes after a short delay, while whiskey bombs instantly ignite when they hit the ground. Enemies may roll to attempt to avoid explosives. Barrels of TNT are scattered around the environment and during missions, encouraging players to use barrels to set traps or throw and use the Quickdraw mode to shoot them and detonate the TNT. Land mines are available on the PSP version. Melee combat is also emphasised, with enemies randomly charging at the player throughout the game. Players can use a bowie knife, a tomahawk and a cavalry saber. They can use enemies as a human shield, and dispatch them by slitting their throats or knocking them out if the enemy has a bounty. Players can also scalp a dying enemy with a scalping knife. Stealth plays a part in many missions as well, and players are encouraged to use bows, melee and, on the PSP version, throwing knives, in such situations. Horseback combat is also featured, and is an important aspect of the game. Fast-paced chases are featured, and players can shoot while riding. Both the player's and the enemies' horses can be killed. While riding a horse players can do close- quarter combat with any melee weapon they possess. Trampling or running over enemies is also a way of dispatching them while on horseback. Synopsis =Setting= Gun is set in the American Old West, specifically in Arizona, Colorado, Kansas and New Mexico in the year 1880. This includes cities and badlands with populated environments that stretch from the mountains to the plains of early Dodge City, Kansas. The story, written by Randall Jahnson, features several veteran actors, including Ron Perlman, Lance Henriksen, Kris Kristofferson, Tom Skerritt and the lead, played by Thomas Jane. =Characters= The game features a number of characters whose names are taken from real Old West figures, including Clay Allison, Jose Chavez y Chavez, Hoodoo Brown, Dave Rudabaugh, John Joshua \\"J.J\\" Webb, Luke Short, Major Thomas Magruder (who was most likely based on John B. Magruder), Soapy Jennings (who was based on Soapy Smith), and Magruder's hulking personal bodyguard, Dutchie, based on \\"Dutchy\\" Schunderberger, a member of the real- life Hoodoo Brown's Dodge City Gang. The name \\"Alhambra\\", given to the brothel in the game, comes from a former pleasure-castle of the Nasrid Kingdom of Granada. * Colton \\"Cole\\" White (Thomas Jane) ‚Äì The Apache protagonist and player character of the story. He learned the ways of the outdoors from his adoptive father, Ned White. Cole meets many characters during his adventure; some become his allies while others turn out to be the utmost of enemies. He is a skilled marksman, and is always willing to stand up for what he believes is right. * Soapy Jennings (Dave Wittenberg) ‚Äì A safe cracker and a friend of Colton. Soapy's two specialties are cracking safes and cheating at poker, two major moral strikes against him in the Old West. During the ride to Piper Lake from the Badlands, he confides to Cole the origin of his nickname: he was cornered in a lady friend's bedroom by her husband, and was forced to hide inside the shaft of her water closet ‚Äì after which he had to scrub for three days before he could get the smell off of him. * Thomas \\"Tom\\" Magruder (Lance Henriksen) ‚Äì The main antagonist of the story. He is the unofficial boss of the West, in charge of the railroads being installed through Apache Indian territory. Magruder was a Confederate major during the Civil War and led a group of soldiers, which included Clay Allison, to find the mythical city of gold, Quivira. The war ended, but Magruder's mission did not. He has made it his ultimate goal in life to find the lost city of gold and is willing to do anything to accomplish it. Margruder meets his end when he is crushed to death during a cave-in at his mine. * Ned White (Kris Kristofferson) ‚Äì Colton's adoptive father. He raised Colton under the false pretense of being his real father. Right before his death, he confesses part of the truth to Colton and sends him on his quest to find out the rest of the truth. Ned is a well- trained outdoorsman and makes his living selling animal skins and carcasses to the local riverboats sailing down the Missouri River. * \\"Reverend\\" Josiah Reed (Brad Dourif) ‚Äì A misogynistic and sadistic priest who works for Magruder as a hired killer to take control of the area. He is eventually killed by Cole in revenge for the death of Jenny. * Mayor Hoodoo Brown (Ron Perlman) ‚Äì The fast- talking mayor of Empire City. Hoodoo takes orders from Thomas Magruder, although his true goal is to make his city great rather than simply earn money. Due to his dirty practices, Hoodoo has many enemies and therefore has hired two professional gunslingers, J.J. Webb and Dave Rudabaugh, as personal bodyguards. He himself is a skilled gunfighter. The mayor pretends to hire Colton as another bodyguard, but in fact intends to set him up and is killed in a firefight with Cole. * Clay Allison (Tom Skerritt) ‚Äì A former Corporal for the Confederate Army and friend of Ned White and Tom Magruder. He is the leader of the resistance group fighting against Hoodoo Brown's corrupt reign over Empire City. He and his followers work closely with the Apaches, dedicated to keeping Magruder and his men out of the frontier and restore some dignity to the Old West. * Fights-At-Dawn (Eric Schweig) ‚Äì The Blackfoot chief and a proud warrior. He is deeply concerned for the future of his tribe and saddened by the white man's arbitrary murder and theft. He befriends Colton, and recalls a time when Cole was younger, when he was attacked by a cougar. * Many Wounds (Eric Schweig) ‚Äì An Apache Indian who gave Colton to Ned when he was a baby. Later in the story, Many Wounds becomes a trusted ally of Colton and helps him out with Cole's fight against Magruder. * Jenny (Kath Soucie) ‚Äì A prostitute and the main attraction of the Alhambra Saloon in Dodge City. Jenny is tired of the small-town life and is anxiously waiting the completion of the bridge in town so she can travel south to New Mexico to Empire City. She proves to be a valuable ally to Colton, but is killed by Reed. =Plot= In 1880, Colton White and his father Ned are hunting game along the Missouri River. After Cole saves Ned from a grizzly bear, they board a riverboat to sell the meat. The riverboat is suddenly attacked by a murderous preacher named Reverend Josiah Reed and his men. After losing ground to Reed's men, Ned tells Cole to find a prostitute named Jenny in Dodge City. Ned then reveals he is not Cole's real father, and pushes him over the side to save him from the steamboat's explosion. Cole travels to Dodge City to find Jenny. After rescuing her from a gang of bandits, Cole learns from her that Reverend Reed came to Dodge City from Empire City, and that Empire's Mayor Hoodoo Brown would know of the preacher's whereabouts. After assisting the sheriff in fixing the bridge to out of Dodge, Cole and Jenny travel to Empire City. Upon arriving in Empire City, Colton is made a deputy by Hoodoo and promises to help him find Reed. During a gunfight at the local cattle ranch between the Resistance and the Deputies, Cole is appalled to see Hoodoo's other deputies kill an unarmed couple. Cole then attempts to arrest the deputies but is forced to kill them both when they resist. When Cole confronts the Mayor in his Casino back in Empire City, Hoodoo tells Cole that Reed has captured Jenny and is holding her in his office. Rushing to save her, Cole witnesses Reed murdering Jenny and is then knocked unconscious by Hoodoo. Colton is then brought before Thomas Magruder, Reed and Hoodoo's boss, who had also ordered the Steamboat Massacre and Jenny's murder. After Cole learns Magruder and Ned have history, Magruder orders Colton to be hanged the next morning for Jenny's murder. Cole is thrown into the Empire jail before his scheduled execution the next day. Here he meets Port, a member of the Resistance, and Soapy Jennings, a safecracker. With Soapy's help, Cole escapes jail and flees Empire with the other two prisoners. Soapy departs for Dodge while Port takes Cole to the Resistance's Hideout, where he meets their leader, Clay Allison. Cole later learns from Clay that he and Ned had served under Magruder during the Civil War, and that the former Confederate Major was searching for Quivira, a lost city of gold, and that his ruthless quest had torn the West apart. Clay takes Cole on a mission to destroy one of Magruder's trains, which they execute successfully. They also discover the boxcar of the train is full of captured Apaches, who Magruder had been using as slaves. The Apache Chief Many Wounds turns up at the scene, and thanks Cole for freeing his people. As the Resistance celebrate at the hideout later that night, they are attacked by Magruder's men. They eventually manage to repel the attack but Clay is captured and taken to Empire City. Cole convinces Port and the rest of the Resistance to attack Empire, rescue their leader and take out Hoodoo. After battling his way through Empire to Hoodoo's stronghold, Cole eventually rescues Clay from his prison and confronts the corrupt mayor, whom he eventually kills. With the city liberated from Magruder's control, Cole travels back to Dodge to find Soapy so they can crack a safe that Cole noticed on the steamboat. After Cole saves Soapy from a lynch mob, the pair escape Dodge and travel to the wreckage of the steamboat. However, the two are then captured by the renegade army commander Sergeant Hollister, who is revealed to be in league with Magruder. After escaping Hollister's fort, Cole and Soapy save the local Blackfoot tribe from Hollister's soldiers. Cole then assists the tribe in attacking and capturing Hollister's Fort. Cole then travels up river, only to be attacked by Hollister, who now wields Ned's powerful rifle. After Cole wounds the psychotic sergeant heavily, Hollister then attempts to kill him via a suicide bombing, which he fails, killing only himself. With Hollister dead, Cole and Soapy make their way to the riverboat, only to be ambushed by Magruder's riders. Cole defeats them, then they are attacked by Reed. After a long gunfight with the murdering preacher, Cole kills the Reverend and he and Soapy discover that the item Magruder had been hunting for is a part of the golden Cross of Coronado which shows the route to Quivira. Cole realizes that the other piece is held by Many Wounds, the Apache Chieftain. Cole and Soapy travel through the Badlands to the Apache Camp, where Many Wounds reveals that Cole is Apache. Many Wounds explains that his father and many other innocent villagers, were murdered by Magruder and his soldiers during their original search for the Cross of Coronado during the Civil War. They are then once again ambushed by Magruder's men on their way to a mountain top Many Wounds told them of. Upon reaching the peak and using the Cross, they learn that Quivira is hidden inside a mountain, above where Magruder had been digging for it. However, Magruder's militia discover their location, and attack them. Soapy is captured and tortured by Magruder, and is forced to reveal Quivira was above him all along. Magruder returns to his mine to find the City of Gold, while Cole fights his way down the mountain to save Soapy. Cole then kills Magruder's henchman Dutchie and his men, and captures Magruder's armored train. Clay and Cole then use the train to break into Magruder's Mine, which is then attacked by a joint force of Resistance fighters and Apache warriors. Fighting their way into the mines, Cole finally confronts Magruder inside Quivira. The two then furiously battle inside the Lost City, with Cole eventually overcoming the ruthless tyrant and causing the mountain to begin to collapse. Cole leaves Magruder with his leg trapped under a rock to be crushed by the crumbing mountain while he escapes the Lost City with the help of Many Wounds. Then, with Magruder dead and Quivira lost for good, Cole tells Many Wounds that their fathers can finally rest in peace. Development and marketing Gun was marketed through the use of \\"Last Call Poker\\" ‚Äî an alternate reality game from 42 Entertainment. Reception and sales Gun received mostly positive reviews from critics, although the Xbox 360 version met positive to mediocre ratings. It holds aggregate scores of 79% and 79/100 at GameRankings and Metacritic respectively. IGN stated that \\"Neversoft has finally made a good game besides all their Tony Hawk\\". GameSpot described it as \\"initially a 19th-century Grand Theft Auto\\", while GameSpy addressed it as having \\"just about everything you could want from a game set in the Wild West\\". In its first month, the game sold 225,000 units across the four systems for which it was initially released. According to TRST sales data, the game had sold over 1.4 million units in the US by October 2008. =Awards= The game was highly acclaimed by many, and has scored high ratings and awards. GameSpy awarded it \\"Editor's Choice\\" and \\"Xbox 360 Action Game of the Year\\", saying that it \\"needs a sequel and fast.\\" The game's protagonist was placed #7 on Game Informer's \\"Top 10 Heroes of 2005\\" list. At the 9th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards, Gun was nominated for \\"Outstanding Achievement in Original Musical Composition\\", \\"Outstanding Character Performance ‚Äì Male\\", \\"Outstanding Character Performance ‚Äì Female\\", and \\"Outstanding Achievement in Story and Character Development\\". The editors of Computer Games Magazine presented Gun with their 2005 \\"Best Voice Acting\\" award. It was a finalist for PC Gamer USs \\"Best Action Game 2005\\" award, which ultimately went to F.E.A.R.. =Controversy= The Association for American Indian Development declared a boycott of the game, claiming that it contains \\"derogatory, harmful, and inaccurate depictions of American Indians.\\" Featured on the Association's boycott-specific website was a petition demanding that Activision clean up various aspects of the game before re-releasing it to retailers; the group called for a worldwide recall of the game if the revision was not completed. The site suggested that a game in which players were required to kill members of specific ethnic groups, like African-Americans, Irish, Mexicans or Jews would never be tolerated, \\"but apparently, killing Indians is still fair game.\\" The site also mentioned events and revelations that take place later in the game's story, but assert that they do not address the problematic portions from earlier sections of the game. On the now-defunct GamerGod.com website, contributor, Beth Dillon, concluded on January 31, 2005, that: > Even though the historical period portrayed in Gun was fraught with racism, > Activision's decision to publish a racially stereotyped video game > represents a serious misstep in social responsibility. Like Custer's > Revenge, Gun provokes wonder. In this case, the industry has unfortunately > bought into the popular misconception that games are frivolous because they > are made for fun.

It works by using a different return path (also called \\"envelope sender\\") for each recipient of a message.  Motivation  Any long-lived mailing list is going to eventually contain addresses that can't be reached. Addresses that were once valid can become unusable because the person receiving the mail there has switched to a different provider. In another scenario, the address may still exist but be abandoned, with unread mail accumulating until there is not enough room left to accept any more. When a message is sent to a mailing list, the mailing list software re-sends it to all of the addresses on the list. The presence of invalid addresses in the list results in bounce messages being sent to the owner of the list. If the mailing list is small, the owner can read the bounce messages and manually remove the invalid addresses from the list. With a larger mailing list, this is a tedious, unpleasant job, so it is desirable to automate the process. However, most bounce messages have historically been designed to be read by human users, not automatically handled by software. They all convey the same basic idea (\\"the message from X to Y could not be delivered because of reason Z\\") but with so many variations that it would be nearly impossible to write a program to reliably interpret the meaning of every bounce message. RFC 1894 (obsoleted by RFC 3464) defines a standard format to fix this problem, but support for the standard is far from universal. However, there are several common formats (e.g., RFC 3464, qmail's qsbmf, and Microsoft's DSN format for Exchange) that cover large proportion of bounces. Microsoft Exchange can sometimes bounce a message without providing any indication of the address to which the original message was sent. When Exchange knows the intended recipient, but is not willing to accept email for them, it omits their address. If a message is sent to \`joe@example.com\` and the server knows that this is \\"Joe User\\", it will bounce the message saying that the message to \\"Joe User\\" could not be delivered, leaving out the \`joe@example.com\` address altogether. VERP is the only viable way to handle such bounces correctly.  How VERP solves the bounce handling problem  The hard part of bounce handling is matching up a bounce message with the undeliverable address that caused the bounce. If the mailing list software can see that a bounce resulted from an attempt to send a message to \`user@example.com\`, then it doesn't need to understand the rest of the information in the bounce. It can simply count how many messages were recently sent to \`user@example.com\`, and how many bounces resulted, and if the proportion of bounced messages is too high, the address is removed from the list. While bounce message formats in general vary wildly, there is one aspect of a bounce message that is highly predictable: the address to which it will be sent. VERP takes full advantage of this. In a mailing list that uses VERP, a different sender address is used for each recipient. The mailing list manager knows that it sent a message from X to Y, so if a bounce message is received at address X, it can only be because address Y was undeliverable, because nothing was sent from X to any other address. Thus the important information has been extracted from the bounce message, without any need to understand its contents, which means the person in charge of the list does not need to deal with it manually.  Origin  The first serious advocate of this solution, and the originator of the term VERP to describe it, was Daniel J. Bernstein, who first put the idea into practice in his qmail MTA and ezmlm mailing list manager.D. J. Bernstein qmail, February 1, 1997refresh  Example  Assume there is a mailing list called \`wikipedians@example.net\` and that an individual, \`bob@example.org\` has subscribed to it, but later on, Bob has left example.org, so his address is no longer valid. Consider what happens when someone sends a message to the list. = Without VERP = Without VERP, the mailing list manager might send a message with the following characteristics: * envelope sender: \`wikipedians- owner@example.net\` * recipient: \`bob@example.org\` This would result in a bounce, generated by the MTA of either example.net or example.org, with the following characteristics: * envelope sender: empty * recipient: \`wikipedians- owner@example.net\` * contents: example.org was unable to deliver the following message to bob: ... The mailing list manager can't be expected to understand the contents of this bounce, and can't deduce anything from the recipient address because hundreds of other people besides Bob were also sent messages from \`wikipedians-owner@example.net\`. = With VERP = With VERP, the original message would be different: * envelope sender: \`wikipedians- owner+bob=example.org@example.net\` * recipient: \`bob@example.org\` The bounce, then, will be more useful: * envelope sender: empty * recipient: \`wikipedians- owner+bob=example.org@example.net\` * contents: example.org was unable to deliver the following message to bob: ... From this bounce message the mailing list manager can deduce that a message to \`bob@example.org\` must have failed. This example shows the simplest possible method of matching a VERP to a list subscriber: the entire recipient address is included within the return path, with the at sign replaced by an equals sign because a return path with two at signs would be invalid. Other encoding schemes are possible.  Software that supports VERP  * CiviCRM * Courier Mail Server * Discoursehttps://meta.discourse.org/t/handling-bouncing-e-mails/45343 * exim, using a specialized Router/Transport combination * ezmlm * GNU Mailman * G Suite * Inxmail * Mercury Mail Transport System * mlmmj * Mahara * Mailchimp * MediaWiki though mw:Extension:BounceHandler * Moodle * postfix * qmail * Sendmail, with a rulesethttp://compgroups.net/comp.mail.sendmail/sendmail- verp-ruleset/1311680 * STEdb * StrongMail * Sympa * Thexyz * Zimbra * Target Box * NotifyBC * AWS SES (Simple Email Service)  Disadvantages  The use of VERP requires each message to be sent once for every recipient, instead of once to each receiving SMTP server. This is because of a limitation of SMTP, which allows multiple recipient addresses to be specified in a single transaction, but only one sender address. When there are many subscribers in the same domain, a mailing list that is not using VERP can combine multiple deliveries into a single transaction. It connects to the appropriate server for the domain, gives the single sender address, the recipient addresses, and then sends the message contents only once. A mailing list using VERP, on the other hand, must send the entire message body repeatedly, which leads to an overall increase in bandwidth usage. This inefficiency is usually not considered a big problem, especially by qmail users, since qmail always sends messages once per recipient, even when VERP is not being used. Some packages mitigate the impact of VERP by applying it selectively, for example a mailing list manager might only use VERP on 1 in 10 mailings. This way you can gain much of VERP's tight bounce control and accurate feedback without incurring the processing and network overhead every time. Another problem with VERP (and with any automatic bounce handling scheme) is that there are MTAs on the Internet that fail to follow basic SMTP standards. VERP depends on the recipients' MTAs following the rule that bounces are sent to the envelope sender. This has been a standard requirement since the dawn of SMTP in 1982 (see RFC 821), but still there are MTAs that get it wrong, usually by bouncing to the address in the \`From:\` header. Systems that implement greylisting work fine with VERP if the envelope sender follows the above-mentioned format. However, some VERP implementations use message number or random key as part of VERP, which causes each post to the mailing list to be delayed unless the greylisting system treats \\"similar\\" sender addresses as being equivalent.

It is a concept album which tells the story of an alien race and their journey to a new world following a volcanic catastrophe on their home planet. Anderson wrote and performed the music himself. Production =Background and writing= By mid-1975, Anderson had been the lead vocalist in the progressive rock band Yes for seven years. In August of that year the band, which was then a line-up of Anderson, bassist Chris Squire, guitarist Steve Howe, drummer Alan White, and keyboardist Patrick Moraz, completed the 1974‚Äì1975 tour in support of their seventh album, Relayer. The group, who had been recording and touring consistently for the past five years, felt a break was necessary and agreed to take time off for each member to make their own solo album. For his solo effort, Anderson wished to present a concept album which told a \\"semi- science fiction\\" story inspired by the artwork that Roger Dean had designed for Yes's fourth album, Fragile (1971). Dean's first piece of work for the group, the front cover depicts a tiny planet breaking apart and a glider escaping into space, which Anderson adapted into the story with additional inspiration from the novels The Finding of the Third Eye and The Initiation of the World by writer, painter, and mystic Vera Stanley Alder and The Lord of the Rings trilogy by J.R.R. Tolkien. The latter book by Alder describes the theory of four \\"nature tribes\\" that once lived on the planet: Negro, Oriental, Nordic, and Asian, which became the four tribes in Olias that were not of people, but \\"music consciousness tribes\\". On the first day of recording Anderson had yet to have a concrete story, but started to formulate one slowly from watching the sunrise that morning. He spent about a year on the story. Looking back on the album, Anderson thought it was \\"not that well mapped out\\" with \\"vague\\" interpretations of the different characters and settings. \\"I just thought of the story as three magicians coming out of space to take these tribes from one planet to another to save them from destruction. It's a very simple story [...] I hope it will be taken on a level without people thinking there are any hidden meanings.\\" Anderson's growing desire to learn about musical structure and his own performing capabilities with various instruments made Olias of Sunhillow a platform for him to explore this with a self-taught approach, without help from other musicians. He had previously relied on his Yes band mates for seeing his ideas for songs through and decided against the idea of spending time learning to play the piano with a teacher. Halfway through the album, it became clear to Anderson what he could and could not do: \\"You just find out where you're at in being able to express yourself. It was an intense period of time.\\" Despite not being proficient with keyboards or percussion instruments at the time Anderson thought that \\"What I've pulled off attracts me and sounds right\\", and focused on the accuracy of expressing his ideas to tape rather than the technical ability of his playing.\\"\\"Jon Anderson and the miracle of Olias\\" - Jon Anderson interview by Herv√© Picard in Best' magazine, 1977 (translated from French by Ivar de Vries, hosted on Elsewhere - the Independent Vangelis Website =Plot= The planet of Sunhillow is home to four tribes‚ÄîNagrunium, Asatranius, Oractaniom and Nordranious‚Äîeach of which represents a different aspect of music consciousness, which comes under threat after a catastrophic eruption of its volcano. Olias, a magician, is the chosen architect of an ark, named the Moorglade Mover, to fly Sunhillow's people to a new planet. He is helped by fellow magicians Ranyart, the harp-playing navigator of the glider, and Qoquaq (pronounced \\"ko-quake\\"), the mystic and appointed spokesperson who unites the four tribes to leave the planet together. Olias fashions the Moorglade Mover by persuading Sunhillow's trees and fish to sacrifice their lives and substance to form it, while Qoquaq travels across Sunhillow using trance singing to bring together the mutually suspicious tribes to unite and board the ship. With the population on board and in a collective trance, the ship leaves Sunhillow just before the planet explodes into millions of silent teardrops. As the glider travels through deep space, the refugees succumb to the mysterious Moon Ra, a force of disorientation. Creating an evil form out of their panic and frustration, they are reassured and reunified by Olias through his singing of chords of love and life. The Moorglade Mover lands on the plains of a new planet named Asguard, and the tribes disembark and go their separate ways. Their mission completed, Olias, Ranyart, and Qoquag ascend the highest of Asguard's mountains to sleep and \\"become one with the universe\\". =Recording= The album was recorded in approximately four months in Anderson's then country home in Seer Green, Buckinghamshire which housed a garage that he converted into a recording studio. Anderson performed all of the vocals and instruments himself. Two- thirds of the album was initially recorded in demo form onto 8-track tape, which Anderson used as a guide to write the complete arrangements that were then re-recorded onto 24-track. To help with operating the recording desk and obtaining the desired sound for the album, Anderson hired Yes sound engineer Mike Dunne. Anderson worked for as long as ten hours a day on the album and took weekends off. Anderson praised Dunne's involvement on the project, particularly during the mixing stage, the second side of which lasted within a week. Mixing the first side, however, was problematic because Anderson continued to make changes to the music due to his dissatisfaction with it. In the end, Anderson commented of the final mix that, with Dunne's help, \\"It was what I wanted to hear. Mike was more than the second man, he was part of the mix.\\" In the end, over 100 tracks were used to make the album. The pressure of recording it resulted in delays which caused Atlantic to push its release by some months. Anderson said: \\"There were points when I didn't think I was going to finish it, and that I was going to end up a nervous wreck.\\" Anderson was cautious over the music and refused to play the music to anyone in case they did not like it, including his wife and Atlantic president Ahmet Ertegun; Dunne was the only other person that heard the album. Anderson plays a variety of keyboard, string, and percussion instruments, including the harp, wooden flute, Asian bells, sitar, Moog synthesiser and Turkish saz. He still considered his voice his primary instrument and used layered vocals to create impressions of a new language on \\"Sound Out the Galleon\\". He chose the words particularly for his voice as he was technically unable to play a dedicated solo on an instrument and called them \\"a vocal exercise [...] I sang it until we created twenty voices and finished up with this tangible energy.\\" Anderson named Yes keyboardists Rick Wakeman and Patrick Moraz, and Greek keyboardist and composer Vangelis as influences in his keyboard work on the album. After the album was finished, management of RCA Records informed Vangelis, a composer and keyboardist signed to the label at the time, of their dissatisfaction that he had played on Olias of Sunhillow without informing them. Vangelis denied any involvement on the album despite RCA having thought the keyboards on the album were performed in his style. Vangelis said: \\"I myself was very surprised it had my name on the thank you-list. Maybe I have influenced Jon, I don't know. And it's clear that it's closer to this than you get with Yes. But maybe it's a coincidence. In any case, it's a formidable feat there is such a record when it features like Jon a debutante on keyboards. I believe the record represents more the way he is than what he does with Yes, no offense intended [...] Anderson is not an instrumentalist in the old sense of the term and yet he has made, with lots of effort, a marvellous record.\\"\\"Vangelis, the Master\\" - Vangelis interview by Herv√© Picard in Best' magazine, 1977 (translated from French by Ivar de Vries, hosted on Elsewhere - the Independent Vangelis Website =Artwork= Despite repeated requests from Anderson, Roger Dean was too busy to commit to designing the cover, so Anderson decided upon a series of designs by artist David Fairbrother-Roe, who was suggested by a friend. Release =Commercial performance= The album was originally set for a release around Christmas of 1975, but it was pushed back some months so Anderson could complete it. In early 1976 he was pressured by his Yes band mates to complete the album before a proposed Japanese tour, but the plan was cancelled due to Anderson's exhaustion from working on Olias. The album was released in July 1976 on Atlantic Records. The album peaked at number 8 on the UK and number 47 in the United States.Charles Snider, The Strawberry Bricks Guide to Progressive Rock, pg. 232, Strawberry Bricks (2008), \\"Ocean Song\\" was performed by Yes on their 1976 tour, but as with the other songs they performed from other members' solo albums, it was dropped after the first few weeks. =Reception= Writing in RAM in July 1976, Bob Edmunds described the album as being \\"as impressive as anything Yes have produced collectively... Musicians with greater skills (e.g. Mike Oldfield) have created instrumental works on this scale but have always been denied access to the wonderful instrument of Jon Anderson's voice. Endless tours have done nothing to detract from one of the richest, purest voices in rock‚Ä¶. Olias has a continuity of intensity rarely found on any album, let alone one this ambitious. It won't go down too well with those who reject anything except full-tilt rock'n'roll. But there's no way you can deny the sheer grandeur of Jon Anderson's music, no matter what opinions you hold about rock.\\" Review of ‚Äò‚ÄôOlias of Sunhillow‚Äô‚Äô by Bob Edmunds in ‚Äò‚ÄôRAM‚Äô‚Äô, July 1976 (hosted on ‚ÄòYes in the Press‚Äô website) In Allmusic, Dave Connolly concludes \\"the idea may seem overly ambitious, but Anderson fills the record with enough magical moments to delight fans of Yes' mystic side... at no point does the music lose its spellbinding effect for lack of sonic detail. Olias of Sunhillow is faithful to the spirit of Yes, though decidedly more airy than that band's visceral style - its closest comparison would be Fragiles \\"We Have Heaven\\" or Going for the Ones \\"Wonderous Stories\\" (which was clearly influenced by this record) on the vocal tracks, and Greek progressive electronic composer (and future Anderson collaborator) Vangelis on the instrumental tracks.... Olias of Sunhillow is not the missing Yes album some might hope it to be, though it does prefigure the later Jon & Vangelis collaborations of the '80s.\\"Olias of Sunhillow album review at AllMusic, by Dave Connolly (retrieved 17 August 2011) Writing on his own Progrography website, Connolly has also commented that \\"it's not a stretch to say that Olias of Sunhillow looks and sounds like (Roger) Dean's previous Yes artwork come to life. Since Anderson himself handles all the instruments, the album is an airier affair than Yes, and yet at the heart of these songs is the same captivating, intoxicating core that the singer brought to that band.... Olias of Sunhillow is the one Anderson album most likely to please Yes fans, immersed as it is in their mystical aura. It's also a gorgeously packaged product (in LP form, anyway), which helps set the mood immeasurably.\\"Olias of Sunhillow review by Dave Connolly in Progrography, 2002 Writing about Olias of Sunhillow on his Mewsings blog in 2009 (thirty-three years after the album's initial release), Murray Ewing reflected \\"there‚Äôs a dangerous swerve towards the New Age in Anderson‚Äôs first solo album, both in the optimistic whimsy of its fantasy world, and the musical palette of soft, sparkling synths and world instruments. Thankfully, it easily escapes that particular doldrum of musical hell through sheer energy (on the musical front) and sheer weirdness (on the fantasy front). This isn‚Äôt music to attune your chakras to, it‚Äôs adventurous, full of drama, uplifting melodies, evocative soundscapes, and a fresh unearthliness that makes it the only fantasy album I can think of which genuinely sounds like it could have come from another world.\\"\\"Jon Anderson‚Äôs Olias of Sunhillow\\" - article by Murray Ewing in Mewsings, 21 June 2009 =Reissues= The album has been released several times. A recent US CD release was by Wounded Bird Records on 28 February 2006. Contrary to some earlier releases it presents all the artwork, but very small,. Some earlier cd-releases don't show all the original artwork and only part of the story, since they left out pages 3‚Äì6 of the original vinyl album. The Japanese pressing on MMG Inc/Atlantic AMCY-18 presents the complete artwork in a booklet, like the vinyl version with 8 pages (including frontcover and backcover). The album was reissued in January 2014 on SACD by Audio Fidelity. Proposed sequel In 2004, Jon Anderson called for collaborators to contact him via his website. He described a project that would be a \\"return to Olias\\". In 2006, around the time Olias of Sunhillow was re-released, Anderson announced that he was making a sequel called The Songs of Zamran: Son of Olias. In late 2008, he announced on his Myspace page that he was hoping to finish the sequel soon. In a Rockline interview on 20 July 2011, Anderson was asked about the sequel. He said that he hoped to have the first bits of Zamran out in a year. In late 2012, a web site was launched (www.sevendragons.org/zamran now closed) entitling it Zamran Experience, showing a short preview and describing it as \\"an interactive audio-visual album\\". On 3 January 2013, Anderson confirmed he was still working on The Songs of Zamran: Son of Olias. On 1 December 2014, Anderson stated on his Facebook page: \\"I keep myself busy working on the Zamran project.\\" Track listing Words and music by Jon Anderson.

Since then they have played most of their tour matches against the host countries‚Äô A teams, except for their tours of England, when they have mostly played against county teams. =2001-02 Busta Cup in the West Indies= Between late January and early March 2002 Bangladesh A competed as the eighth team in the 2001-02 Busta Cup, the domestic first- class competition in the West Indies. Captained by the Test player Akram Khan, they played seven matches, winning one and losing five, and finished seventh. The average age of the team was 22, and they struggled to adapt to the conditions. None of the team scored a century.Wisden 2003, p. 1469. Mosaddek Hossain, who was 18 at the time, was the most successful player, taking 21 wickets with his leg-spin at an average of 32.23. The highest scorer was Mazharul Haque, with 451 runs at an average of 32.21. The victory over Windward Islands was the first first-class victory by any Bangladeshi representative team. Tushar Imran, who was also 18 years old, scored 46 and 79 and was named man of the match. Mosaddek Hossain took 3 for 41 and 5 for 81 in the eight-run victory. =2003-04 PCB Patron's Trophy in Pakistan= In December 2003 and January 2004 Bangladesh A competed in the 2003-04 PCB Patron's Trophy in Pakistan. Using 25 players, they played six matches, losing four and drawing the other two. Shahriar Hossain scored 218, the only double- century in that season‚Äôs competition, in the drawn match against Defence Housing Authority. During the same period Bangladesh A also competed in Pakistan's Patron's Cup List A tournament, winning two and losing four of their six matches. =2004-05 in Zimbabwe= In February and March 2005, Bangladesh A played three first-class matches followed by five List A matches against Zimbabwe A in Bulawayo and Kwekwe. Captained by Shahriar Nafees, Bangladesh A won all three first-class matches, but under the captaincy of Sanwar Hossain they lost the List A series 2‚Äì3. The highest first-class innings for Bangladesh A was scored by Mushfiqur Rahim, who made 111 not out and 50 in the second match, his second first-class match at the age of 16. He made his Test debut at Lord‚Äôs three months later. Enamul Haque (aged 18), Shahadat Hossain (aged 18) and Shakib Al Hasan (aged 17) shared the bowling honours, Haque taking the best innings and match figures with 7 for 49 and 3 for 69 in the first match. All three subsequently played Test cricket. =2005 in England= Shortly after the Bangladeshi Test team toured England in 2005, a Bangladesh A team also toured, again captained by Shariar Nafees, playing five first-class matches (of which they lost three and drew two) and three List A matches (won two, lost one) in July and August. Six of the team had been part of the earlier Test squad.Wisden 2006, p. 548. The outstanding player was Tushar Imran, who had not been part of the Test squad, who scored 467 runs in first-class matches at an average of 58.37, including the team's only two centuries. =2006 in Zimbabwe= The tour to Zimbabwe in June and July 2006 followed the same pattern as the tour in 2005: three first-class matches followed by five List A matches, all against Zimbabwe A. This time, along with matches in Bulawayo and Kwekwe again, two matches were played in Mutare. Tushar Imran captained the team, most of whom had Test experience. Bangladesh A won the first first-class match, drew the second, and lost the third; they won the List A series 4‚Äì1. The outstanding player in the first- class matches was Enamul Haque, who took five wickets in each first innings and finished with 22 wickets at an average of 17.18. The highest scorer in the first-class matches was Alok Kapali, with 336 runs, including two centuries, at an average of 67.20. Mehrab Hossain scored a century in each innings in the second match. =2006-07 in Sri Lanka= Bangladesh A toured Sri Lanka in March and April 2007, playing two first-class and three List A matches against Sri Lanka A. Tushar Imran again captained the team. All five matches were lost by large margins. No centuries were scored. =2008 in Ireland and England= A young team of 22 players toured Ireland and England from mid-June to early August 2008. Nobody was older than 26, and 17 were under 22.Hugh Chevallier, \\"Bangladesh A in Ireland and England, 2008\\", Wisden 2009, pp. 526‚Äì31. The captain, Junaid Siddique, was 20. They played four first-class matches (winning won and drawing three), four List A matches (winning one and losing three), one Twenty20 match (lost) and three minor matches. The only century was scored by Raqibul Hasan in the List A match against MCC. =2010-11 in South Africa= Bangladesh A, captained by the experienced Test player Mohammad Ashraful, toured South Africa in April 2011, playing two first-class and four List A matches against South Africa A. South Africa A won all the matches comfortably, except for the second first-class match, which was ruined by rain, and the first List A match, in which Ashraful took 3 for 27 and made 118 not out off 99 balls to lead Bangladesh A to a six-wicket victory. Ashraful's was the only century for Bangladesh A. =2011-12 in the West Indies= In November 2011 Bangladesh A visited the West Indies, playing two first-class, two Twenty20, and two List A matches against West Indies A in Antigua and Saint Vincent. The captain was Jahurul Islam. They drew the first first-class match and lost the second by one wicket; they won the first Twenty20 by one wicket and lost the second by 55 runs; and they lost the two List A matches. Their only centuries came in the first match, when Mominul Haque (150) and Nasir Hossain (134) added 259 for the fifth wicket after the first four wickets had fallen for 59. =2013 in England= An experienced 15-man Bangladesh A team, again captained by Jahurul Islam, toured England in August 2013, playing eight List A matches: five against county teams followed by three against England Lions. Bangladesh A had generally sound batting but ineffective bowling, and they lost their first seven matches.\\"Bangladesh A in England, 2013\\", Wisden 2014, pp. 745-55. They won their last match after chasing the England Lions total of 319 for 7, when Farhad Reza hit a six off the last ball of the 50th over. =2014 in the West Indies= In May and June 2014 Bangladesh A played seven matches in Barbados against teams representing the Sagicor High Performance Centre: two first-class, three List A and two Twenty20 matches. The young West Indians outclassed Bangladesh A in every match except the first Twenty20 match, which Bangladesh A won easily. Nasir Hossain captained the team in the two first-class matches, and Naeem Islam was the captain in the limited-overs matches. =2015-16 in India= In September 2015 Bangladesh A visited India and played three List A matches against India A in Bangalore, and two first-class matches, one against Karnataka in Mysore and one against India A in Bangalore. The team was captained by Mominul Haque. India A won the first and third List A matches. Bangladesh A won the second, thanks to Nasir Hossain, who scored 102 off 96 balls then took 5 for 36. Karnataka won their first-class match by four wickets, then India A overwhelmed Bangladesh A by an innings. In Bangladesh A's first innings, Sabbir Rahman, going to the wicket after the first three wickets had fallen for two runs, scored 122 not out off 131 balls out of a team total of 228. =2015-16 in South Africa and Zimbabwe= A team captained by Shuvagata Hom toured South Africa and Zimbabwe a few weeks after the tour to India. They played four minor matches against South African provincial teams in Pretoria in October 2015, winning one and losing three, before going on to Zimbabwe in November to play five matches at the Harare Sports Club. They played three List A matches against Zimbabwe A, winning them all comfortably; Mithun Ali scored 100, 66 and 60.Wisden 2016, p. 1181. Two first-class matches followed which were evenly contested. Bangladesh A won the first by 14 runs and the second was drawn. Tasamul Haque scored 102 in the second match. =2018 in Ireland= A team toured Ireland to play five unofficial ODIs (captained by Mominul Haque) and three unofficial T20s (captained by Soumya Sarkar) in August 2018.

Klutznick, 448 U.S. 448 (1980), was a case in which the United States Supreme Court held that the U.S. Congress could constitutionally use its spending power to remedy past discrimination.. The case arose as a suit against the enforcement of provisions in a 1977 spending bill that required 10% of federal funds going towards public works programs to go to minority- owned companies.  Opinion of the Court  The Court was deeply divided as to both the rationale for the decision and the outcome. Five separate opinions were filed, none of which commanded the support of more than three members of the Court. Chief Justice Burger wrote a plurality opinion, joined by Justices White and Powell; Justice Powell also wrote a separate concurrence. Justice Marshall delivered an opinion for a concurrence with an entirely different basis in law, joined by Justices Brennan and Blackmun. Since there was neither a single opinion that represented the views of a majority of the court nor a clear proposition in opinion that commanded a majority, only the judgment of the court, affirming the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, unambiguously has precedential value. The Court held that the minority set-aside program was a legitimate exercise of congressional power, and that under the particular facts at issue, Congress could pursue the objectives of the minority business enterprise program under the Spending Power. The plurality opinion noted that Congress could have regulated the practices of contractors on federally funded projects under the Commerce Clause as well. The plurality further held that in the remedial context, Congress did not have to act \\"in a wholly 'color-blind' fashion.\\"  Dissent  Two dissenting opinions were written, one by Justice Stewart, joined by Justice Rehnquist, and the other by Justice Stevens. Justice Stevens objected to the congressional procedures to determine the 15% set-aside figure.  Subsequent history  Fullilove v. Klutznick was overruled by Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pe√±a.. There the Court adopted strict scrutiny for race preference in federal contracting. This brought the standard of review into uniformity with City of Richmond v. J.A.

Tai Tam means a big pool in the Chinese language which illustrates a triangular bay, namely Tai Tam Bay between Stanley Peninsula, D'Aguilar Peak and Tai Tam Tuk (, lit. innermost of Tai Tam, also known as Tytam Took). The meaning of Tai Tam varies greatly between the early colonial days and the present day. Current usage The present-day Tai Tam is the area around Tai Tam Tuk, the location of Tai Tam Tuk Reservoir. It is covered by the Tai Tam Reservoirs, the Tai Tam Country Park and Tai Tam Country Park (Quarry Bay extension). Along Tai Tam Road are some luxurious apartment towers and houses. The innermost of Tai Tam Bay is Tai Tam Harbour, close to Tai Tam Tuk. The Red Hill in the southern part of Tai Tam Tuk is an area primarily consists of low-rise upmarket residences, including the Redhill Peninsula, Red Hill Park, Turtle Cove, Le Palais and Villa Rosa. Tai Tam Scout Centre is a Scout campsite of The Scout Association of Hong Kong on the shore of Tai Tam Harbour. From the campsite to the foot of the dam of Tai Tam Tuk Reservoir is the Tai Tam Village. The shore outside the village is mudland with some mangrove plants. The high school and middle school campuses of the Hong Kong International School are also in Tai Tam. The Tai Tam Tuk Eco Educational Centre is a visitors centre run by the Tai Tam Tuk Foundation with the aim to educate and inspire action for sustainable development in Hong Kong through hands on interaction with the outstanding nature and culture of Tai Tam. Organising a number of Citizen Science events to engage and involve the public, the site was one of the first BioBlitz events organised in Hong Kong. Historical usage In 1845, Tai Tam was a small habitat east of the market of Stanley, facing Tai Tam Bay. (It still uses the postal address of Tai Tam Village, Stanley). Later, the Stanley Peninsula was also known as Tai Tam Peninsula. The southeast cape of the peninsula is Tai Tam Head. Tai Tam Tuk, the site of Tai Tam Tuk Reservoir, was a valley habitat with extensive cultivation. The village of Tai Tam Tuk was moved to Tai Tam Harbour due to the construction of the reservoir. The Tai Tam area was the scene of heavy fighting between Commonwealth and Japanese forces in December, 1941.

It particularly refers to pilgrimage sites and holy places in Hinduism as well as Jainism. The process or journey associated with Tirtha is called Tirtha-yatra, while alternate terms such as Kshetra, Gopitha and Mahalaya are used in some Hindu traditions to refer to a \\"place of pilgrimage\\".Pilgrimage, Sanskrit-English Dictionary, Koeln University, Germany (2012) Tirtha Tƒ´rtha () literally means \\"a ford, a \\"crossing place\\" in the sense of \\"transition or junction\\". Tirtha is a spiritual concept in Hinduism, particularly as a \\"pilgrimage site\\", states Axel Michaels, that is a holy junction between \\"worlds that touch and do not touch each other\\". The word also appears in ancient and medieval Hindu texts to refer to a holy person, or a holy text with something that can be a catalyst for a transition from one state of existence to another. It is, states Knut A. Jacobsen, anything that has a salvific value to a Hindu, and includes pilgrimage sites such as mountains or forests or seashore or rivers or ponds, as well as virtues, actions, studies or state of mind. Tirtha can be an actual physical sacred location in Hindu traditions, or a metaphorical term referring to meditation where the person travels to an intellectual sacred mind state such as of \\"truth, forgiveness, kindness, simplicity and such\\". Tirtha in Hindu texts, states Bhardwaj, is \\"one of the many ways toward self-realization and bliss\\". The field of our state of mind is the body, mind, intellect and ego, a quadripartite. Yoga prepares the field to understand God (God's Grace). Antahkarana is the levels of mental layers and, or including mental body. The word Tirtha is found in the oldest layer, that is the Samhita of the Rigveda as well as other Vedas. In the hymns of Rigveda, such as 1.169.6 and 4.29.3, the context suggests that the word means \\"a way or road\\". In other hymns of Rigveda such as 8.47.11, states Kane, the context suggests the term means \\"a ford in the river\\". Yet, in other cases, Tirtha refers to any holy place, such as by the sea, or a place that connects a sacrificial ground (Yajna) to the outside. Later texts use the word Tirtha to refer to any spot, locality or expanse of water where circumstances or presence of great sages or gurus has made special.Tripurari, Swami, Sacred of the Sacred, Harmonist, 2009.\\\\; Quote: ... India and its sacred places are sacred by and large for one reason alone. Sacred places are such because sacred persons, who have crossed over the river of samsara, reside in them. There is no more sacred place than the heart of the sadhu, wherein God himself resides. In the Upanishads, states Diana L. Eck, the \\"crossing over\\" refers to the \\"spiritual transition and transformation from this world to the world of Brahman, the Supreme, the world illumined by the light of knowledge\\". The emphasis in the Upanishads, in Tirtha context is on spiritual knowledge, instead of rituals, and this theme appears in the Hindu epics as well. =Holy sites= The Dharmasastras and the Puranas, states Kane, assert numerous descriptors for what is holy, including all mountains, all of Himalayas, all rivers, lakes, dwellings of Rishis (sages), temples, cowpens, great forests, and all seas. This tradition traces back to the Rigveda, where Aranyani (large forest) is referred to as a deity. The reverence for rivers and water bodies is traceable to the Nadi Stuti, or the river-hymn, in hymn 10.75 of the Rigveda. Pilgrimage sites are not prominent in Dharmasastras such as Manusmriti and Yajnavalkya Smriti, but they are found in the epic Mahabharata and the Puranas.< Most Puranas include large sections on Tirtha Mahatmya along with tourist guides, which describe sacred sites and places to visit, particularly the Padma Purana, Skanda Purana, Vayu Purana, Kurma Purana, Bhagavata Purana, Narada Purana, Devi Bhagavata Purana, Vamana Purana, Linga Purana, Brahma Purana, Brahmanda Purana and Bhavishya Purana. In ancient texts, Varanasi (Benares, Kashi), Rameshwaram, Kanchipuram, Dwarka, Puri, and Haridwar have been mentioned as particularly holy sites, along with geographies where major rivers meet (sangam) or join the sea. The Kumbhamela, which rotates at a gap of three years, between Prayaga (renamed to Allahabad in the late medieval era), Haridwar, Ujjain and Nasik, remain popular into the modern times, with tens of millions of Hindus participating. =Reasons= Some pilgrimage are part of a Vrata (vow), which a Hindu may make for a number of reasons. It may mark a special occasion, such as the birth of a baby, or as part of a rite of passage such as a baby's first haircut, or after healing from a sickness.Agehananda Bharati (1963), Pilgrimage in the Indian Tradition, History of Religions, Vol. 3, No. 1, pages 135-167 It may, states Eck, also be the result of prayers answered, or consequent to a vow a person had made if his or her prayer were to come true, such as the well being of a family member, or overcoming poverty or destitution or a challenging situation. An alternate reason for Tirtha, for some Hindus, is to respect wishes or in memory of a beloved person after his or her death. This may include dispersing their cremation ashes in a Tirtha region in a forest, mountain, river or sea to honor the wishes of the dead. The journey to a Tirtha, assert some Hindu texts, helps one overcome the sorrow of the loss. Another reason for a Tirtha is the Hindu belief that journeys have rejuvenating potential, to purify the inner state of man, and there is spiritual merit in travel, a theme asserted by the Vedic texts. This journey in later Hindu texts, states Bhardwaj, has ranged from the inner journey of meditation to physically traveling to famed temples or bathe in rivers such as the Ganges. Tirtha has been one of the recommended means of addressing remorse and to perform penance, for unintentional errors and intentional sins, in the Hindu tradition. The effort and austerities during the Tirtha are a part of PrƒÅya≈õcitta concept, which means \\"atonement, penance, expiation\\" for \\"something one has done, but shouldn't have\\" or \\"something one did not do, but should have\\".PrƒÅya≈õcitta, Sanskrit-English Dictionary, Koeln University, Germany Vishnu Dharmasastra asserts that the type of sin that may be expiated through pilgrimages is referred to as anupƒÅtakas (small sin), in contrast to mahapƒÅtakas (major sin) that require other penances. According to Kane, many texts asserted that \\"tirtha-yatra (journey to a holy place) was a popular way for redemption of sins in the case of all classes of men and women. =Method= The proper procedure for a pilgrimage is debated within the , with questions such as whether one should cut his hair before a pilgrimage arising or whether a fast at the tƒ´rtha is required. The mode of travel is also widely discussed, particularly when the Tirtha is undertaken as part of a penance. The most widely accepted view appears to be that the greatest austerity (prƒÅya≈õcitta) comes from traveling on foot, or part of the journey is on foot, and that the use of a conveyance is only acceptable if the pilgrimage is otherwise impossible. The Hindu texts assert that the man should take his wife with him, when proceeding to pilgrimage. However, some also call attention to the fact that doing one's duty as a householder is more important than going on pilgrimages, and it is only in special cases or once one has paid his Three Debts (to his parents, his teacher, and the Vedas) that he should resort to pilgrimages. Raghunanda's PrƒÅya≈õcitta-tattva asserts that the person seeking penance must give up 16 things when he reaches Ganges river, including behavior such as praising another tirtha, striking any one, sexual dalliance, accepting gifts, giving one's used clothing as gifts to others. Kshetra A pilgrimage place or location in some Hindu texts is also referred to as Kshetra (IAST: k·π£ƒìtra, ), literally any \\"field, area, tract of land\\". A kshetra denotes a holy precinct or temenos. Kshetra is also an etymon of the Avestan term X≈°aŒ∏ra \\"[Desirable] Dominion\\", which holds the semantic field \\"power\\" and is also a personal name for a divinity or immortal who comprises one of the Amesha Spentas of Zoroastrianism. X≈°aŒ∏ra or Shahrevar conquered that which was evil and annexed territory thus won, proffering it to the honest, peaceable and humble. A kshetra often refers to a collection of tirtha locations (temples, river banks) in a certain location, such as Varanasi, Hardwar, Somnath, Mathura-Vrindavan, Ayodhya, Puri and Kanchipuram, are referred to as a kshetra. A kshetra may denote a place where there is a temple or where there is held to have been a person or event of sacred, religious or dharmic importance. The Kurukshetra specifically is the \\"field\\" or \\"precinct\\" where the Pandavas and Kauravas fought a religious war as told in the Bhagavad Gita section of the Mahabharata. A kshetra need not be distant permanently developed travel site, and refers to any temporary space, such as a wedding area or mandala set up for a worship, that is sacred. Both yantras and mandalas are sometimes referred to as kshetras. Buddhism has two analogues to the kshetra, the Pure Land or buddhak·π£etra and the refuge tree. The Vaishnava Puranas enumerates seven sites as the gates of Moksha: Ayodhya, Mathura, MƒÅyƒÅ, KƒÅsi, KƒÅ√±chƒ´, AvantikƒÅ (Ujjain), Purƒ´ and DvƒÅrƒÅvatƒ´. Tirtha monastery The Gosains (Dashnami) credit Adi Shankara for setting up 10 monastic orders in India, of which Tirtha is one and is based in Dwarka, Gujarat in Kalika Matha. The entire list includes Tirtha and Ashrama in Gujarat, Vana and Aranya in Odisha, Giri, Parvata and Sagara in Uttarkhand, Saraswati, Bharati and Puri in Karnataka.

Among the Bakweri, the name is liengu (plural: maengu). Miengu are similar to Mami Wata spirits Bakoko the name is Bisima. The miengu's appearance differs from people to people, but they are typically said to be beautiful, mermaid-like figures with long hair and beautiful gap-teeth. They live in rivers and the sea and bring good fortune to those who worship them. They can also cure disease and act as intermediaries between worshippers and the world of spirits. For this reason, a jengu cult has long enjoyed popularity among the Duala peoples. Among the Bakweri, this cult is also an important part of a young girl's rite of passage into womanhood. As a single spirit Jengu may refer to a single spirit, as well. In some traditions, this spirit replaces the class of miengu spirits, while in others, it acts as their leader. Among the Isubu, for example, this spirit is called Jengu. Bakweri belief talks of a female spirit named Mojili or Mojele. Mojili became the progenitor of the miengu when she lost a bet with Moto, the ancestor of mankind, over who could build the longer-lasting fire. Moto won the right to stay in the village, but Mojili was forced to flee to the sea. The Bakweri still worship Mojili as the ruler of the miengu. In fact, her name is so powerful, that many believe that children under seven may die if they hear it uttered. By extension of this tale, the miengu are said to be the wives of the rats, as the ancestor of the rats also lost the bet and fled to the forest. Another Bakweri tradition names this spirit Liengu la Mwanja and makes her the consort of Efasa-Moto, spirit of Mount Fako (Mount Cameroon). Long ago, the two formed an understanding that Efasa-Moto would live on the mountain, while Liengu la Mwanja would inhabit the sea. When lava from Mount Fako's 1992 eruption made it all the way to the ocean, many hailed it as a sign that the spirit was visiting his wife. Jengu cult The Duala and related groups hold the jengu cult in high importance. The cult may have originated with peoples further west, possibly the Ijo, and then passed from people to people, reaching the Batanga at its most eastward extent. In the earliest days, jengu-worship centred on the water spirits as the source of four boons: crayfish, the end of the rainy season in one of the world's wettest regions, victory in the pirogue races, and protection from epidemics of disease. Among the Duala proper, membership was originally reserved to \\"free\\" (pure-blooded) Duala, a stipulation that even excluded members of the prestigious Akwa clan due to one of their ancestors being a Longasse woman. Observations by European traders and explorers prove that jengu-worship was well established by the early 19th century. Early missionaries largely failed in their attempts to suppress it. The cult is still active in Cameroon's Littoral and Southwest Provinces. Both males and females are eligible to join, though this openness may be a fairly recent development. Jengu-worship is primarily male among the Duala , Malimba proper, but among the Bakweri, on the other hand, the cult is primarily for women. =Ceremonies and rituals= Jengu worship centres on a secret society led by an individual known as the ekale. This person traditionally wears a mask at all meetings, though this practice all but died out by the mid-20th century. Anyone can supplicate the miengu, however, and the simplest rituals involve nothing more than prayers or sacrifices to the deities before fishing or traveling by water. Early jengu worshippers performed rituals in pirogues on the Wouri River, its tributaries and estuary, and on nearby islands. The person would first dress in ceremonial garb, a cape, skirt, and headdress of raffia fronds, and carry palm fronds and wooden paddles. He would then summon the miengu and offer them oblations of food and drink. He might also visit a jengu shrine further up the Wouri. Much jengu worship is related to healing and medicine, and the miengu are called upon when mainstream healing fails. For example, a jengu doctor can treat a patient by first sacrificing a cock and goat. He then administers a vomit- inducing medicine and waves a small stool over the patient's head. The one treated must then follow a series of taboos. Among the Bakweri, this rite is known as Liengu la Vafea. The highest-profile miengu ceremony today is the annual Ngondo celebration in Douala, first held in 1949. The night before the f√™te's culmination, members of the jengu cult hold a private ceremony at Jebale Island on the Wouri. There they sacrifice to the water spirits and prepare a package of gifts. The next day, this offering is presented to the miengu during a public ceremony on a beach near Douala. One cult member dives into the sea with the gift and stays down as long as possible. Afterward, he returns with a message from the miengu about the year to come. The climax of the ngondo festival is the jengu cult. Wherein the traditional diver goes into the river under supervision of the traditional rulers. This undisclosed custodian of tradition, accompanied by a woman and two men, embarks on a ritual boat. He will then submerge himself in the middle of the river and stay underneath the water for three to ten minutes. It is believed that he visits the kingdom of their ancestors (spirits) beneath the waters. He returns with news of the successor of the ngondo presidency and a coded message from the gods of the land in a calabash. One mystery of this ritual is that the calabash, which the diver holds as he re-emerges from underneath the river, is dry. =Induction= The rites observed by the Bakweri people of Mount Cameroon serve as an example of similar rituals among other coastal groups. Toward the coast, the Bakweri practice two major induction rituals. In the Liengu la Ndiva, cult members take a seizure or collapse as a sign that a young girl is ready for induction. A cult member then speaks to her in a secret liengu language, and if she seems to understand any of it, a traditional healer begins the initiation rites. The girl must live in seclusion for several months, during which she must follow a strict set of taboos and may see visions of spirits. She also receives a secret name and teaching in the secret liengu language. Eventually, the healer releases her into the custody of a group of strong men and a number of women singing in the liengu language. The men take turns carrying her until she reaches the middle of a stream. There, the healer plunges her in, inducting her into the cult. Meanwhile, other cult members attempt to capture a crab from the waters, as this animal represents the liengu spirit. The new member's taboos remain, however, and she must live in seclusion for several more months. Finally, the cult holds a feast in her honour, and the initiation comes to an end. The entire process takes the better part of a year. An alternate Bakweri initiation ritual is the Liengu la Mongbango. If a young girl disappears into the bush, her female relatives try to track her down by singing to her in the liengu language and carrying cult insignia made of wicker. When they find her, they hide her away for several months (outsiders may visit, however). Afterward, the cult prepares a feast for the girl. She and her sponsor then go alone into the forest. The initiate dresses in traditional regalia of fern fronds and rubs her body with red camwood. She is then led back to the village tied to the middle of a long rope. Two groups play a tug of war over her until the rope breaks, and she collapses. The cult members call to her nine times in the liengu language, which causes her to stand back up. After a few more weeks of taboos, a traditional healer bathes her in a stream, and her initiation ends. This process also takes most of a year.

Description This species is very small, a mature adult growing to only in length, a wingspan of 11 cm, and an average weight of 3.05 g for males and 3.22 g for females. The male Costa's has a mainly green back and flanks, a small black tail and wings, and patches of white below their gorgeted throat and tail. Its most distinguishing feature is its vibrant purple cap and throat with the throat feathers flaring out and back behind its head. The female Costa's hummingbird is not as distinct as the male, having grayish-green above with a white underbelly. Distribution Female Costa's hummingbird is fairly common in the arid brushy deserts and any nearby gardens of the Southwestern United States and the Baja California Peninsula of Mexico. Behaviour =Courtship= The male Costa's hummingbird's courtship display is a spirited series of swoops and arcing dives, carefully utilizing a proper angle to the sun to show off his violet plumage to impress prospective mates. Each high-speed dive will also pass within inches of the female, perched on a nearby branch, which will be accented by a high-pitched shriek that is produced by the tail. Separately, the male will perch and produce similar sounds in his song‚Äîexcept, the song is vocal rather than tail-generated. =Nest= The female hummingbird constructs a small cup-shaped nest out of plant fibers, down and at times spider silk, coated with lichen to hold it together. The nest will be situated above ground on a yucca stalk or tree limb. =Chicks= The female lays just two eggs, which are white in color, which she will incubate for 15 to 18 days before the young hatch. The young Costa's hummingbirds leave the nest after 20 to 23 days. =Diet= Like all other hummingbird species, Costa's hummingbird feeds on flower nectar and any tiny insects that it happens to find in the flower petals. =Torpor= As with other species, it can slow down its metabolism during cold nights when it enters a hibernation-like state known as torpor and its heart and respiration rate are dramatically slowed. Hybrids Hybrids between this bird and Anna's hummingbird, the black-chinned hummingbird as well as the broad-tailed hummingbird are known. Meaning of scientific name The binomial commemorates French nobleman Louis Marie Pantaleon Costa, Marquis de Beauregard (1806‚Äì1864). Conservation The IUCN describes them as of least concern. The population is stable and there are no known threats. They are found in at least one protected area.

Ernst Udet beside his Fokker DVII \\"Lo\\" Royal Prussian Jagdstaffel 11 (\\"No 11 Fighter Squadron\\"; commonly abbreviated to Jasta 11) was founded on 28 September 1916 from elements of 4 Armee's Kampfeinsitzerkommandos (or KEKs) 1, 2 and 3 and mobilized on 11 October as part of the German Air Service's expansion program, forming permanent specialised fighter squadrons, or \\"Jastas\\". It became the most successful fighter squadron in the Luftstreitkr√§fte. Founding Jasta 11's first commander was First Lieutenant (Oberleutnant) Rudolf Lang, from its mobilization at Brayelles, until 14 January 1917. Jasta 11's first months of operations were very undistinguished. It was not until the appointment of 24-year-old Cavalry Captain (Rittmeister) Manfred von Richthofen on 16 January 1917 as Commanding Officer that the unit commenced its path to fame and immortality. Von Richthofen, later known as the Red Baron (due to the practice of painting his aircraft red for easy identification during combat) was already an able tactical pilot and ace following several months of service in Jasta 2 and became a highly effective unit commander who led his pilots by example. He already had 16 victories and was awarded the Pour le Merite just before he assumed his command. The unit was first based at Douai-Brayelles and then Roucourt for operations over the 6 Armee on the Arras front, the Jasta were equipped with various models of the excellent Albatros D.III sesquiplane fighter. Between 22 January 1917 and the end of March the Jasta claimed some 36 victories. The beginning of the Battle of Arras in early April meant a higher number of targets, with Jasta 11 logging 89 claims for aircraft destroyed in April (from a total of 298 made by all German fighter units for the month.) This decimation of the Royal Flying Corps became termed 'Bloody April'. The Jasta's performance is all the more extraordinary as the unit usually flew in small flights of six or fewer. Significant 'scorers' in the unit that April were Manfred von Richthofen (21 claims), Lt. Kurt Wolff (22), Lt. Karl Sch√§fer (15), Manfred's brother Lothar (15) and NCO pilot Sebastian Festner (10).

Richthofen was promoted to command JG I, which was the second fighter wing in the history of military aviation. It was dubbed 'Richthofen's Flying Circus' because it mimicked a circus's logistics by using dedicated railway trains to transport it to forward airfields, and because of its vividly painted aircraft. In September 1917, Jasta 11 would be equipped with Fokker Dr.I triplanes. It would operate these until April‚ÄìMay 1918, when it received the Fokker D.VIIs it would use until war's end. Manfred von Richthofen remained Jasta commander until 26 June 1917, when his deputy, Leutnant Karl Allmenroeder took over. Following the latter's death the next day, former Jasta 11 pilot Leutnant Kurt Wolff took over after his transfer back from Jasta 29. After Wolff was wounded in September, Oberlt. Wilhelm Reinhard took charge until Wolff returned. Soon after Wolff was killed in action on 15 September, thereafter Lothar took command. Jasta 11 would then have a bewildering succession of other temporary commanding officers, especially when Lothar was frequently away from the front recovering from wounds. Oberleutnant Erich R√ºdiger von Wedel was the last Staffelf√ºhrer, from September 1918 until the end of the war. The Jasta was demobilised at Darmstadt on 16 November 1918. Jasta 11 eventually became the highest scoring German Jasta of World War I, with 350 claims. The first was scored on 23 January 1917, the 100th on 23 April, the 200th on 17 August, the 250th on 2 April 1918, the 300th on 28 June 1918; the 350th was on 19th Sept 1918 (the Jasta 11 last victory) was the shooting down of a Royal Aircraft Factory R.E.8 of No. 3 Squadron RAAF [Pilot Lt.

Career The group began as a side project of bassist Eli Janney and Fugazi drummer Brendan Canty. Canty left the project by 1990 due to his commitments with Fugazi. Janney went on to recruit three former members of D.C. hardcore punk group Soulside to complete the lineup: singer/guitarist Scott McCloud, bassist Johnny Temple and drummer Alexis Fleisig. Girls Against Boys employs dual bass guitars, a rarity in rock music. However, Janney occasionally doubled on keyboards. Their second album, Venus Luxure No. 1 Baby, was a heavy yet nuanced entry into early 1990s post-hardcore. It was later performed live in its entirety as part of the All Tomorrow's Parties-curated Don't Look Back series, and at the 25th anniversary concert for Touch and Go Records held in Chicago in September 2006. They provided music for the soundtrack to the film Series 7: The Contenders (2001). They have also contributed to soundtracks of the films Clerks, Hedwig and the Angry Inch, Permanent Midnight, White Oleander, SubUrbia, Terror Firmer, Mallrats, the Psycho remake and Songs of the Witchblade. They covered the song \\"Boogie Wonderland\\" for the 1999 movie 200 Cigarettes; the band also appears in the film. The band has toured extensively throughout Europe, Japan, Australia and the United States and Canada. They have performed in numerous festivals including Lollapalooza 1993, 1995 and 1996, All Tomorrow's Parties, Reading Festival, 1994 Phoenix Festival, Dour Festival, Primavera Festival, 1997 Fuji Rock Festival, Pukkelpop, Lowlands Festival, Les Transmusicales. They have appeared on Late Night with Conan O'Brien, The Jon Stewart Show, Canal+ and MTV. Touring included stints with bands such as Jawbox, The Jon Spencer Blues Explosion, Helmet, the Jesus Lizard, Garbage, Rage Against the Machine, Interpol, Fugazi, Brainiac, Pitchshifter, Atari Teenage Riot, Foo Fighters, Luscious Jackson, Tar, No Means No, Les Savy Fav, Magic Dirt, Big Chief, Edsel and others. Bands who supported them before going on to have mainstream success include the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, dEUS and Placebo. In May 2013, Girls Against Boys resumed touring in support of a new EP. The first show of their reunion tour was performed at the Donaufestival in Krems, Austria, with David Yow of The Jesus Lizard providing additional vocals. In November 2013, the band played the final holiday camp edition of the world-famous All Tomorrow's Parties festival in Camber Sands, England.  Side projects/current projects Scott McCloud and Johnny Temple also played together in a side- project called New Wet Kojak, releasing two records on Chicago's Touch and Go Records‚ÄîNew Wet Kojak (1995) and Nasty International (1997). They followed with three more on Beggars Banquet‚ÄîDo Things (2000), No. 4 EP (2001) and This Is the Glamorous (2003). The group featured Geoff Turner (ex-Gray Matter), Nick Pellicciotto (Edsel) and Charles Bennington. Alexis Fleisig performed with Moby for his album Animal Rights. Scott McCloud, Johnny Temple and Alexis Fleisig toured with Gina Gershon in 2002 in support of her film Prey for Rock and Roll, a film focusing on the struggles of an all‚Äîfemale band based roughly on the life of Cheri Lovedog. The tour consisted of Gershon and three members of Girls Against Boys performing songs penned by Stephen Trask and Linda Perry. The tour resulted in the reality series/documentary Rocked with Gina Gershon.

From the Huolongjing The oldest known depiction of rocket arrows, from the Huolongjing. The right arrow reads 'fire arrow', the middle is an 'arrow frame in the shape of a dragon' and the left is a 'complete fire arrow'. Fire arrows were one of the earliest forms of weaponized gunpowder, being used from the 9th century onward. Not to be confused with earlier incendiary arrow projectiles, the fire arrow was a gunpowder weapon which receives its name from the translated Chinese term hu«íji√†n (ÁÅ´ÁÆ≠), which literally means fire arrow. In China a 'fire arrow' referred to a gunpowder projectile consisting of a bag of incendiary gunpowder attached to the shaft of an arrow. Fire arrows are the predecessors of fire lances, the first firearm. Later rockets utilizing gunpowder were used to provide arrows with propulsive force and the term fire arrow became synonymous with rockets in the Chinese language. In other languages such as Sanskrit 'fire arrow' (agni astra) underwent a different semantic shift and became synonymous with 'cannon'. Design Although the fire arrow is most commonly associated with its rocket mechanism,The History of Early Fireworks and Fire Arrows ‚Äî About.com it originally consisted of a pouch of gunpowder attached to an arrow. This type of fire arrow served the function of an incendiary and was launched using a bow or crossbow. According to the Wujing Zongyao the fire arrow was constructed and used in the following manner: Incendiary gunpowder weapons had an advantage over previous incendiaries by using their own built-in oxygen supply to create flames, and were therefore harder to put out, similar to Greek fire. However unlike Greek fire, gunpowder's physical properties are solid rather than liquid, which makes it easier to store and load. The rocket propelled fire arrow appeared later. By the mid 1300s rocket arrow launchers had appeared in the Ming dynasty and later on mobile rocket arrow launchers were utilized in both Korea and China. The fire arrows propelled by gunpowder may have had a range of up to 1,000 feet. History Two fire arrows (crossbow bolts). Southern Germany, ca. 15th Century, with preserved incendiary mixture of charcoal, sulphur, saltpeter and textile on the shaft. The fire arrows were first reported to have been used by the Southern Wu in 904 during the siege of Yuzhang. In 969 gunpowder propelled rocket arrows were invented by Yue Yifang and Feng Jisheng. In 975, the state of Wuyue sent to the Song dynasty a unit of soldiers skilled in the handling of fire arrows. In the same year, the Song used fire arrows to destroy the fleet of Southern Tang. In 994, the Liao dynasty attacked the Song and laid siege to Zitong with 100,000 troops. They were repelled with the aid of fire arrows. Published in 1044, the Wujing Zongyao, or Complete Compendium of Military Classics, states that in 994 A.D. the city of Zitong was attacked by an army of 100,000 men who were driven back by regular war machines and fire arrows.This New Ocean: The Story of the First Space Age (Google eBook), William E. Burrows, Random House Digital, Inc., Nov 5, 1999P.8 In 1076 Vietnam's L√Ω dynasty used fire arrows against the Song army and razed three Chinese cities. In 1083 Song records state that the court produced 350,000 fire arrows and sent them to two garrisons.

The History of Song attributes the invention to two different people at different times, Feng Jisheng in 969 and Tang Fu in 1000. However Joseph Needham argues that rockets could not have existed prior to the 12th century since the gunpowder formulas listed in the Wujing Zongyao are not suitable as rocket propellant. According to Stephen G. Haw, there is only slight evidence that rockets existed prior to 1200 and it is more likely they were not produced or used for warfare until the latter half of the 13th century.

The Allied Powers, with their larger fleets and surrounding position, largely succeeded in their blockade of Germany and the other Central Powers, whilst the efforts of the Central Powers to break that blockade, or to establish an effective counterblockade with submarines and commerce raiders, were eventually unsuccessful. Major fleet actions were less decisive. Prelude The naval arms race between Britain and Germany to build dreadnought battleships in the early 20th century is the subject of a number of books. Germany's attempt to build a battleship fleet to match that of the United Kingdom, the dominant naval power of the 20th-century and an island country that depended on seaborne trade for survival, is often listed as a major reason for the enmity between those two countries that led the UK to enter World War I. German leaders desired a navy in proportion to their military and economic strength that could free their overseas trade and colonial empire from dependence on Britain's good will, but such a fleet would inevitably threaten Britain's own trade and empire. Ever since the First Moroccan Crisis (over the colonial status of Morocco, between March 1905 and May 1906), there had been an arms race, over their respective navies. However, events led up to this. Captain Alfred Thayer Mahan was an American naval officer, extremely interested in British naval history. In 1887, he published The Influence of Sea Power upon History. The theme of this book was naval supremacy as the key to the modern world. His argument was that every nation that had ruled the waves, from Rome to Great Britain, had prospered and thrived, while those that lacked naval supremacy, such as Hannibal's Carthage or Napoleon's France, had not. He hypothesized that what Britain had done in building a navy to control the world's sea lanes, others could also do ‚Äî indeed must do if they were to keep up with the race for wealth and empire in the future. =Naval arms race= Mahan's thesis was highly influential and led to an explosion of new naval construction worldwide. The US Congress immediately ordered the building of three battleships (with a fourth , to be built two years later). Japan, whose British trained navy wiped out the Russian fleet at the Battle of Tsushima, helped to reinforce the concept of naval power as the dominant factor in conflict. However, the book made the most impact in Germany. The German Kaiser Wilhelm II had been much impressed by the Royal Navy, when he visited his grandmother, Queen Victoria. His mother said \\"Wilhelm‚Äôs one idea is to have a Navy which shall be larger and stronger than the British navy\\". In 1898 came the first German Fleet Act, two years later a second doubled the number of ships to be built, to 19 battleships and 23 cruisers in the next 20 years. In another decade, Germany would go from a naval ranking lower than Austria to having the second largest battle fleet in the world. For the first time since Trafalgar, Britain had an aggressive and truly dangerous rival to worry about. Mahan wrote in his book that not only world peace or the empire, but Britain's very survival depended on the Royal Navy ruling the waves. Indeed, the Cambridge 1895 Latin essay prize was called \\"Britannici maris\\", or \\"British Sea Power\\". So when the great naval review of June 1897 for the Queen's diamond Jubilee took place, it was in an atmosphere of unease and uncertainty. The question everyone wanted to know the answer to was how Britain was going to stay ahead. But Mahan couldn't give any answers. The man who thought he could was Jackie Fisher, then Commander in Chief, Mediterranean Fleet. He believed there were \\"Five strategic keys to the empire and world economic system: Gibraltar, Alexandria and Suez, Singapore, the Cape of Good Hope, and the Straits of Dover.\\" His job was to keep hold of all of them. =Fisher's reforms= Design of the revolutionary battleship . When he became First Sea Lord, Fisher began drawing up plans for a naval war against Germany. \\"Germany keeps her whole fleet always concentrated within a few hours of England,\\" he wrote to the Prince of Wales in 1906. \\"We must therefore keep a fleet twice as powerful within a few hours of Germany.\\"Marder, Arthur.

He therefore concentrated the bulk of the fleet in home waters, with a secondary concentration in the Mediterranean Fleet. He also had dozens of obsolete warships scrapped or hulked. The resources thus saved were directed to new designs of submarines, destroyers, light cruisers, battlecruisers and (most notably) dreadnoughts. Fisher proclaimed, ‚ÄúWe shall have ten Dreadnoughts at sea before a single foreign Dreadnought is launched, and we have thirty percent more cruisers than Germany and France put together!‚Äù. =German response= , a , Germany's first response to Dreadnought. Admiral Alfred Tirpitz had also often visited Portsmouth as a naval cadet and admired and envied the Royal Navy. Like the Kaiser, Tirpitz believed Germany's future dominant role in the world depended on a navy powerful enough to challenge it. He demanded large numbers of battleships. Even when Dreadnought was launched making his previously constructed 15 battleships obsolete, he believed that eventually Germany's technological and industrial might would allow Germany to out-build Britain ship for ship. Using the threat of his own resignation he forced the Reichstag to build three dreadnoughts and a battle cruiser. He also put aside money for a future submarine branch. At the rate that Tirpitz insisted upon, Germany would have thirteen in 1912, to Britain's 16. When this was leaked out to the British public in spring 1909, there was public outcry. The public demanded eight new battleships instead of the four the government had planned for that year. As Winston Churchill put it, ‚ÄúThe Admiralty had demanded six ships; the economists offered four; and we finally compromised on eight‚Äù. Tirpitz had no option but to consider Britain's new dreadnought building program as a direct threat to Germany. He had to respond, raising the stakes further. However, the commitment of funds to out-build the Germans meant Britain was abandoning any notion of a two-power standard for naval superiority. No amount of money would allow Britain to compete with Germany and Russia or the US, or even Italy. Thus a new policy, of dominance over the world's second leading sea power by a 60% margin went into effect. Fisher's staff had been getting increasingly annoyed by the way he refused to tolerate any difference in opinion, and the eight dreadnought demand had been the last straw. Thus on January 25, 1910, Fisher left the admiralty. Shortly after Fisher's resignation, Churchill became First Lord of the Admiralty. Under him, the race would continue; indeed Lloyd George nearly resigned when Churchill presented him with the naval budget of 1914 of 50 million pounds. By the start of the war Germany had an impressive fleet both of capital ships and submarines. Other nations had smaller fleets, generally with a lower proportion of battleships and a larger proportion of smaller ships like destroyers and submarines. France, Italy, Russia, Austria-Hungary, Japan, and the United States all had modern fleets with at least some dreadnoughts and submarines. Naval technology Naval technology in World War I was dominated by the dreadnought battleship. Battleships were built along the dreadnought model, with several large turrets of equally sized big guns. In general terms, British ships had larger guns and were equipped and manned for quicker fire than their German counterparts. In contrast, the German ships had better optical equipment and rangefinding and were much better compartmentalized and able to deal with damage. The Germans also generally had better propellant handling procedures, a point that was to have disastrous consequences for the British battlecruisers at Jutland. Many of the individual parts of ships had recently improved dramatically. The introduction of the turbine led to much higher performance, as well as taking up less room and thereby allowing for improved layout. Whereas pre-dreadnought battleships were generally limited to about , modern ships were capable of at least , and in the latest British classes, . The introduction of the gyroscope and centralized fire control, the \\"director\\" in British terms, led to dramatic improvements in gunnery. Ships built before 1900 had effective ranges of perhaps , whereas the first \\"new\\" ships were good to at least , and modern designs to over . One class of ship that appeared just before the war was the battlecruiser. There were two schools of thought on battlecruiser design: British and German. The British designs were armed like their heavier dreadnought cousins, but deliberately lacked armor to save weight in order to improve speed. The concept was that these ships would be able to outgun anything smaller than themselves, and run away from anything larger. The German designs opted to trade slightly smaller main armament (11 or 12 inch guns compared to 12 or 13.5 inch guns in their British rivals) for speed, while keeping relatively heavy armor. They could operate independently in the open ocean where their speed gave them room to maneuver, or alternately as a fast scouting force in front of a larger fleet action. The torpedo boat caused considerable worry for many naval planners. In theory a large number of these inexpensive ships could attack in masses and overwhelm a dreadnought force. This led to the introduction of ships dedicated to keeping them away from the fleets, the torpedo boat destroyers, or simply destroyers. Although the mass raid continued to be a possibility, another solution was found in the form of the submarine, increasingly in use. The submarine could approach underwater, safe from the guns of both the capital ships and the destroyers (although not for long), and fire a salvo as deadly as a torpedo boat's. Limited range and speed, especially underwater, made these weapons difficult to use tactically. Submarines were generally more effective in attacking poorly defended merchant ships than in fighting surface warships, though several small to medium British warships were lost to torpedoes launched from German U-boats. Oil was just being introduced to replace coal, containing as much as 40% more energy per volume, extending range and further improving internal layout. Another advantage was that oil gave off considerably less smoke, making visual detection more difficult. This was generally mitigated by the small number of ships so equipped, generally operating in concert with coal-fired ships. Radio was in early use, with naval ships commonly equipped with radio telegraph, merchant ships less so. Sonar was in its infancy by the end of the war. Aviation was primarily focused on reconnaissance, with the aircraft carrier being developed over the course of the war, and bomber aircraft capable of lifting only relatively light loads. Naval mines were also increasingly well developed. Defensive mines along coasts made it much more difficult for capital ships to get close enough to conduct coastal bombardment or support attacks. The first battleship sinking in the war ‚Äî that of ‚Äî was the result of her striking a naval mine on 27 October 1914. Suitably placed mines also served to restrict the freedom of movement of submarines. Theaters =North Sea= The North Sea was the main theater of the war for surface action. The British Grand Fleet took position against the German High Seas Fleet. Britain's larger fleet could maintain a blockade of Germany, cutting it off from overseas trade and resources. Germany's fleet remained mostly in harbor behind their screen of mines, occasionally attempting to lure the British fleet into battle (one of such attempts was the bombardment of Yarmouth and Lowestoft) in the hopes of weakening them enough to break the blockade or allow the High Seas Fleet to attack British shipping and trade. Britain strove to maintain the blockade and, if possible, to damage the German fleet enough to remove the threat to the islands and free the Grand Fleet for use elsewhere. In 1918 the U.S. Navy with British help laid the North Sea Mine Barrage designed to keep u-boats from slipping into the Atlantic. Major battles included those at Heligoland Bight (two of them), Dogger Bank, and Jutland. Though British tactical success remains a subject of historical debate, Britain accomplished its strategic objective of maintaining the blockade and keeping the main body of the High Seas Fleet in port for the vast majority of the war. The High Seas Fleet remained a threat as a fleet in being that forced Britain to retain a majority of its capital ships in the North Sea. The set-piece battles and maneuvering have drawn historians' attention; however, it was the naval blockade of food and raw material imports into Germany which ultimately starved the German people and industries and contributed to Germany seeking the Armistice of 1918. =English Channel= Although the English Channel was of vital importance to the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) fighting in France, there were no big warships of the British Royal Navy in the Channel. The primary threat to the British forces in the Channel was the German High Seas Fleet based near Heligoland; the German fleet, if let out into the North Sea, could have destroyed any ship in the Channel. The German High Seas Fleet could muster at least 13 dreadnoughts and many armoured cruisers along with dozens of destroyers to attack the Channel.https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/worldwars/wwone/war_sea_gallery_01.shtml The High Seas Fleet would be fighting against only six armoured cruisers that were laid down in 1898‚Äì1899, far too old to accompany the big, fast dreadnoughts of the Grand Fleet based in Scapa Flow.Castles of Steel by Robert K. Massie pg. 129 The U-boat threat in the Channel, although real, was not a significant worry to the Admiralty because they regarded submarines as useless.Castles of Steel by Robert K. Massie pg. 122 Even the German high command regarded the U-boat as, \\"experimental vessels.\\"Castles of Steel by Robert K. Massie pg. 126 Although the Channel was a major artery of the BEF, the Channel was never attacked directly by the High Seas Fleet. =Atlantic= U-boat sinking a troopship, painting by Willy St√∂wer While Germany was strangled by Britain's blockade, Britain, as an island nation, was heavily dependent on resources imported by sea. German submarines (U-boats) were of limited effectiveness against surface warships on their guard, but were greatly effective against merchant ships. In 1915, Germany declared a naval blockade of Britain, to be enforced by its U-boats. The U-boats sank hundreds of Allied merchant ships. However, submarines normally attack by stealth. This made it difficult to give warning before attacking a merchant ship or to rescue survivors. This resulted in many civilian deaths, especially when passenger ships were sunk. It also violated the Prize Rules of the Hague Convention. Furthermore, the U-boats also sank neutral ships in the blockade area, either intentionally or because identification was difficult from underwater. This turned neutral opinion against the Central Powers, as countries like the U.S. and Brazil suffered casualties and losses to their trade. In early 1917, Germany declared unrestricted submarine warfare, including attacks without warning against all ships in the \\"war zone\\", including neutrals. This was a major cause of U.S. declaration of war on Germany. The U-boat campaign ultimately sank much of British merchant shipping and caused shortages of food and other necessities. The U-boats were eventually defeated by grouping merchant ships into defended convoys. This was also assisted by U.S. entry into the war and the increasing use of primitive sonar and aerial patrolling to detect and track submarines. =Mediterranean= Some limited sea combat took place between the navies of Austria-Hungary and Germany and the Allied navies of France, Britain, Italy and Japan. The navy of the Ottoman Empire only sortied out of the Dardanelles once late in the war during the Battle of Imbros, preferring to focus its operations in the Black Sea. The main fleet action was the Triple Entente attempt to knock the Ottoman Empire out of the war by an attack on Constantinople in 1915. This attempt turned into the Battle of Gallipoli which resulted in a Triple Entente defeat. For the rest of the war, naval action consisted almost entirely in submarine combat by the Austrians and Germans and blockade duty by the triple entente. =Black Sea= The Black Sea was mainly the domain of the Russians and the Ottoman Empire. The large Russian fleet was based in Sevastopol and it was led by two diligent commanders: Admiral Andrei Eberhardt (1914‚Äì1916) and Admiral Alexander Kolchak (1916‚Äì1917). The Ottoman fleet on the other hand was in a period of transition with many obsolete ships. It had been expecting to receive two powerful dreadnoughts fitting out in Britain, but the UK seized the completed and with the outbreak of war with Germany and incorporated them into the Royal Navy. The war in the Black Sea started when the Ottoman Fleet bombarded several Russian cities in October 1914. The most advanced ships in the Ottoman fleet consisted of two ships of the German Mediterranean Fleet: the powerful battlecruiser and the speedy light cruiser , both under the command of the skilled German Admiral Wilhelm Souchon. Goeben was a modern design, and with her well-drilled crew, could easily outfight or outrun any single ship in the Russian fleet. However, even though the opposing Russian battleships were slower, they were often able to amass in superior numbers to outgun Goeben, forcing her to flee. A continual series of cat and mouse operations ensued for the first two years with both sides' admirals trying to capitalize on their particular tactical strengths in a surprise ambush. Numerous battles between the fleets were fought in the initial years, and Goeben and Russian units were damaged on several occasions. The Russian Black Sea fleet was mainly used to support General Nikolai Yudenich in his Caucasus Campaign. However, the appearance of Goeben could dramatically change the situation, so all activities, even shore bombardment, had to be conducted by almost the entire Russian Black Sea Fleet, since a smaller force could fall victim to Goebens speed and guns. However, by 1916, this situation had swung in the Russians favour ‚Äì Goeben had been in constant service for the past two years. Due to a lack of facilities, the ship was not able to enter refit and began to suffer chronic engine breakdowns. Meanwhile, the Russian Navy had received the modern dreadnought which although slower, would be able to stand up to and outfight Goeben. Although the two ships skirmished briefly, neither managed to capitalize on their tactical advantage and the battle ended with Goeben fleeing and Imperatritsa Mariya gamely trying to pursue. However, the Russian ship's arrival severely curtailed Goebens activities and so by this time, the Russian fleet had nearly complete control of the sea, exacerbated by the addition of another dreadnought, . German and Turkish light forces would however continue to raid and harass Russian shipping until the end of the war in the east. After Admiral Kolchak took command in August 1916, he planned to invigorate the Russian Black Seas Fleet with a series of aggressive actions. The Russian fleet mined the exit from the Bosporus, preventing nearly all Ottoman ships from entering the Black Sea. Later that year, the naval approaches to Varna, Bulgaria were also mined. The greatest loss suffered by the Russian Black Sea fleet was the destruction of Imperatritsa Mariya, which blew up in port on October 20 (October 7 o.s.) 1916, just one year after being commissioned. The subsequent investigation determined that the explosion was probably accidental, though sabotage could not be completely ruled out. The event shook Russian public opinion. The Russians continued work on two additional dreadnoughts under construction, and the balance of power remained in Russian hands until the collapse of Russian resistance in November 1917. To support the Anglo-French attack on the Dardanelles, British, French and Australian submarines were sent into the Black Sea in the Spring of 1915. A number of Turkish supply ships and warships were sunk but several submarines were lost. The boats were withdrawn at the evacuation of the Dardanelles in January 1916. The small Romanian Black Sea Fleet defended the port of Sulina throughout the second half of 1916, causing the sinking of one German submarine. Its minelayer also defended the Danube Delta from inland, leading to the sinking of one Austro-Hungarian Danube monitor. (See also Romanian Black Sea Fleet during World War I) When Bulgaria entered World War I in 1915, its navy consisted mainly of a French-built torpedo gunboat called Nadezhda and six torpedo boats. It mainly engaged in mine warfare actions in the Black Sea against the Russian Black Sea Fleet and allowed the Germans to station two U-boats at Varna, one of which came under Bulgarian control in 1916 as Podvodnik No. 18. Russian mines sank one Bulgarian torpedo boat and damaged one more during the war.Spencer Tucker, Priscilla Mary Roberts, Encyclopedia of World War I, Volume 1, p. 240 =Baltic Sea= In the Baltic Sea, Germany and Russia were the main combatants, with a number of British submarines sailing through the Kattegat to assist the Russians. With the German fleet larger and more modern (many High Seas Fleet ships could easily be deployed to the Baltic when the North Sea was quiet), the Russians played a mainly defensive role, at most attacking convoys between Germany and Sweden. A major coup for the Allied forces occurred on August 26, 1914 when as part of a reconnaissance squadron, the light cruiser ran aground in heavy fog in the Gulf of Finland. The other German ships tried to refloat her, but decided to scuttle her instead when they became aware of an approaching Russian intercept force. Russian Navy divers scoured the wreck and successfully recovered the German naval codebook which was later passed on to their British Allies and contributed immeasurably to Allied success in the North Sea. With heavy defensive and offensive mining on both sides, fleets played a limited role in the Eastern Front. The Germans mounted major naval attacks on the Gulf of Riga, unsuccessfully in August 1915 and successfully in October 1917, when they occupied the islands in the Gulf and damaged Russian ships departing from the city of Riga, recently captured by Germany. This second operation culminated in the one major Baltic action, the battle of Moon Sound at which the Russian battleship was sunk. By March 1918, the Russian Revolution and the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk made the Baltic a German lake, and German fleets transferred troops to support the White side in the Finnish Civil War and to occupy much of Russia, halting only when defeated in the West. =Other Oceans= A number of German ships stationed overseas at the start of the war engaged in raiding operations in poorly defended seas, such as , which raided into the Indian Ocean, sinking or capturing thirty Allied merchant ships and warships, bombarding Madras and Penang, and destroying a radio relay on the Cocos Islands before being sunk there by . Better known was the German East Asia Squadron, commanded by Admiral Graf Maximilian von Spee, who sailed across the Pacific, raiding Papeete and winning the Battle of Coronel before being defeated and mostly destroyed at the Battle of the Falkland Islands. The last remnants of Spee's squadron were interned at Chilean ports and destroyed at the Battle of Mas a Tierra. Allied naval forces captured many of the isolated German colonies, with Samoa, Micronesia, Qingdao, German New Guinea, Togo, and Cameroon falling in the first year of the war. As Austria-Hungary refused to withdraw its cruiser from the German naval base of Qingdao, Japan declared war in 1914 not only on Germany, but also on Austria-Hungary. The cruiser participated in the defense of Qingdao where it was sunk in November 1914.A Brief History of the Austrian Navy by Wilhelm Donko pg. 79 Despite the loss of the last German cruiser in the Indian Ocean, , off the coast of German East Africa in July 1915, German East Africa held out in a long guerilla land campaign. British naval units despatched through Africa under Lieutenant-Commander Geoffrey Spicer-Simson had won strategic control of Lake Tanganyika in a series of engagements by February 1916, though fighting on land in German East Africa continued until 1918.

Founded in Raleigh, North Carolina in 2003, Annuals first found success following its critically acclaimed 2006 release, Be He Me. As of September 2013, Annuals is based out of Los Angeles. History =Early history= Born and raised in Apex, North Carolina, Adam Baker began playing drums at 10 years old. In 2000, Baker formed Timothy‚Äôs Weekend, a pop-punk band, with future Annuals members, Kenny Florence (lead vocals, guitar) and Mike Robinson (bass).http://www.indyweek.com/indyweek/bleary-eyed/Content?oid=1200103 As the band evolved musically, members were added, and Sedona was formed. Sedona (later, Sunfoldhttp://www.qromag.com/interviews/mike_robinson_of_annuals/) featured much of the same lineup as the original Annuals lineup. As in Timothy‚Äôs Weekend, Florence took the role of lead singer, songwriter and guitarist, with Robinson on bass, Baker on drums, and Zack Oden joining on guitar. Over the next couple of years, as Baker learned to play other instruments and took up an interest in audio production, he began to write, record and distribute his own songs. These became the first recorded Annuals tracks. Mike Robinson (bass), Kenny Florence (guitar), and Adam Baker (drums) playing as Sunfold at Mercury Lounge on July 26, 2008 Early demos and releases from both Annuals and Sunfold were initially put out by their own label, Terpsikhore, which was founded by JK Horne and bassist Mike Robinson. =Be He Me (2006-2008)= In the fall of 2005, Annuals signed with Ace Fu Records, and on October 17, 2006, they released their debut LP, Be He Me. The album exploded on the indie music scene and, thanks in large part to overwhelming coverage in the blogosphere, the band found itself mentioned on just about every \\"Next Big Thing\\" and \\"Bands To Watch\\" list across the internet in 2006 and 2007, earning them a reputation as a \\"blog band.\\" Annuals appeared as the No. 25 entry in Pitchfork‚Äôs \\"Infinite Mixtape\\" series with their song \\"Brother\\" and received extensive coverage in such publications as Rolling Stone, Spin, Paste, Stereogum, Filter, NME, BrooklynVegan and AbsolutePunk, among many others. Be He Me would go on to sell over 5,000 copies by years' end and has sold over 19,000 copies to date.https://www.facebook.com/annuals/posts/10151716391319527 On June 17, 2007, Annuals released Frelen Mas, an 8-song collection of B-sides from Be He Me. On the heels of the startling success of Be He Me, Annuals signed with Sony imprint, Canvasback Music, and on April 1, 2008, released Wet Zoo, a 5-song split-EP with sister band, Sunfold. The 5-song album featured 3 tracks by Annuals and 2 contributions from Sunfold. =Such Fun & Sweet Sister (2008-2011)= Annuals' second full-length album, Such Fun, was released on October 7, 2008 via Canvasback/Terpsikhorehttps://www.nme.com/news/nme/38429 and was met with mostly positive reviews.https://www.metacritic.com/music/such-fun/annuals A far more polished product than its predecessor, the album was co-produced by Grammy award- winning producer Jacquire King (Tom Waits, Modest Mouse, Dawes) and features an original Bob Ross painting as the cover art. While Such Fun did not achieve the same level of commercial success as Be He Me, the album saw Annuals take a giant step forward in their songwriting, production quality and overall musicianship. Such Fun's shimmering orchestration, clever lyrics and engaging melodies would set the standard for their future recordings. On May 4, 2010, on the heels of their departure from Canvasback, Annuals released Sweet Sister on Banter Media. Written, recorded and produced entirely by Baker, the 5-song EP featured four original songs and one cover (Johnny Cash's \\"Flesh and Blood‚Äù), and showcased yet another evolution in the band's sound. Softer, more polished vocals and intricate, electronic Latin rhythms pushed the Annuals sound in yet another new direction. =Time Stamp (2012-present)= In January 2012, it was announced on the band's Facebook page that a forthcoming studio album, Born Raised, was nearing completion and would be released later that year.https://www.facebook.com/annuals/posts/10150468832359527 The album would be delayed, however, and by the time of its release, the title would be changed, due in part to the similarly titled album Born and Raised by John Mayer.https://www.facebook.com/annuals/posts/188597217930407 On April 23, 2013, after sitting in \\"near completed form for almost 18 months,\\" Annuals self-released their long-awaited follow up to Such Fun, Time Stamp.http://annuals.bandcamp.com/album/time-stamp A digital-only release, the album was initially released via Bandcamp and is now available for purchase on iTunes, Amazon, and various other music downloading sites. Accompanying the release was the following note from the band:http://annuals.bandcamp.com/album/time-stamp This is Time Stamp. Whether it's a swan song, a comeback, or something else... Even we aren't sure. This is the first Annuals full length in nearly five years with just five songs in between, and even those songs from Sweet Sister (which were supposed to be a quick \\"hold-you-over\\") have gathered some dust. There have been good, bad, hard, and harder times since our departure from Canvasback and Columbia records in 2010. It seems we've all individually landed on our feet but for better or worse in different, separate places. The majority of Time Stamp has sat in a near-completed form for almost 18 months, the final stretch towards completion would cost the band essentially all of the money it had left to its name. It's here now, with some measured degree of hope, that people will care enough to see that this might be a last ditch effort. We know we have friends and fans across the USA and beyond, we've met you and we've shared many joyful evenings together over the years. We skipped the crowd funding and went straight to getting out a final product. We hope you care about the project, can put something back into it, and to share it with your friends and loved ones. Thank you for all of the love and support you've afforded us all these years. This is for y'all. =Move to Los Angeles and new album= In September 2013, following what the band announced was their \\"last show for the foreseeable future\\", Adam Baker relocated to Los Angeles, where he began work on the band's fourth full-length release.

He credits his mother for his ‚Äúbeach‚Äù music influences and his father for his Motown and country influences. Television and licensing Annuals made their national television debut on Late Night with Conan O'Brien performing the song \\"Carry Around\\", and came back in October 2008 for a second show, playing \\"Confessor\\", the opening track from their album, Such Fun.

Irene Handl, and a cameo by Dutch collective The Fool, who were also set designers for the film. The film is also remembered for its soundtrack, composed by then-Beatle George Harrison. Plot The reclusive, eccentric scientist Oscar Collins (Jack MacGowran) has two next-door neighbours: a pop photographer (Iain Quarrier) and his girlfriend/model Penny Lane (Jane Birkin). Discovering a beam of light streaming through a hole in the wall between them, Collins follows the light and spots Penny modelling for a photo shoot. He begins to make more holes as days go by and becomes a Peeping Tom as they do more photo sessions. Oscar gradually becomes infatuated with the girl, and feels a part of the couple's lives, even forsaking work to observe them. When they quarrel and the couple splits, Penny takes an overdose of pills and passes out, but Oscar comes to her rescue.

Soundtrack The soundtrack was composed by Beatle George Harrison, whom Massot approached specially for the project. Harrison had never done a film soundtrack, and told Massot he did not know how to do it, but when Massot promised to use whatever Harrison created, Harrison took the job. Deciding to make the soundtrack an anthology of Indian and Indian- inspired music, Harrison recorded a series of short ragas at EMI's recording studio in Bombay in January 1968. He mixed these selections with pieces in the rock and other Western musical styles, which he recorded in London. Timing the segments with a stopwatch as he watched the unfinished film, Harrison built up a varied musical programme. The soundtrack album (Wonderwall Music), the first \\"solo\\" Beatles record, was released in November 1968 by Apple Records as the company's first LP. Wonderwall Music also appeared on compact disc in 1992, during reissues of the Apple catalogue, being reissued again in 2014. 1968 theatrical movie poster. \\"Poor Oscar. He Only Wanted to Watch Her Through The Wonderwall\\". Release history The film premiered at the Cannes Film Festival on 17 May 1968, with George Harrison, his wife Pattie, Ringo Starr, his wife Maureen, and the cast members of the film in attendance. The premiere in London was on 12 January 1969. The film won an award, but did not gain a proper distribution deal. A print finally appeared on the American midnight movies circuit in the 1970s, and on home video in the 1980s and 1990s, all of rather low technical quality. In 1998, thirty years after the film's release, and with Massot an established film director, he decided to restore and re- release his first film. Harrison's search for master recordings turned up a lyrical song, \\"In the First Place\\" by the Remo Four, which he hadn't submitted the first time around, believing Massot wanted only instrumental music. \\"In the First Place\\" was released as a single in 1999. Harrison is believed to have not only produced it, but sung and played on it, although he asked to be credited only as producer. Massot was happy to include the song in the restored film, which got a distribution deal. The restored version of Wonderwall, both in theatrical and Director's Cut versions, is currently available on DVD through Shout! Factory in the United States, with bonus features.\\"Wonderwall\\" on the Shout! Factory website Critical reception Critical opinion of the film was mixed. TV Guide panned the film, giving it one star out of four. Other critics were kinder, though. Budd Wilkins, writing for Slant Magazine, criticized the \\"slender-to-the-edge-of-nonexistent narrative\\" and \\"hopelessly square\\" underlying point, but enjoyed the film overall, saying it was \\"best taken for the sensory provocation of its eye- popping set designs and the spaced-out world music ambience of its soundtrack\\" in his 3.5 (out of 5) star review. Keith Phipps, reviewing the film for The Dissolve, wrote \\"The film is mostly just an excuse to experiment. And while not all the experiments work out, the film remains a charming relic of a bygone era of light shows, sitar sounds, and over-the-top symbolism.\\" References Notes External links Wonderwall at TCM.com Category:1968 films Category:British drama films Category:British films Category:1968 drama films Category:English-language films Category:Psychedelic films Category:Films directed by Joe Massot Category:Films scored by George Harrison Category:1968 directorial debut films ","title":"Wonderwall (film)"},{"id":"2442237","text":"The Cisuralian is the first series/epoch of the Permian.

The ten tracts of Blackbird State Forest are open to the public for nature walks, hiking, jogging, and horseback riding all year. It features a 1/2-mile, wheelchair-accessible wildlife and nature interpretation trail on the Tybout Tract and the Blackbird Education Center on the Meadows Tract. Long-range management plans for Blackbird State Forest outline goals for timber production, wildlife habitat, recreation, soil and water protection, wetland and endangered species protection, and public education. Many educational programs are available at the Blackbird State Forest Education Center on the Meadows Tract. Complementing a center at Redden State Forest, the facility has two meeting spaces and interactive displays: The Life Cycle of a Forest, Tree Identification, Invasive Species, Urban/Community Forestry, and Wildland Firefighting.

The modern Redden State Forest is the consolidation of several Sussex County forest tracts, including the Ellendale State Forest. The Ellendale State Forest Picnic Facility was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1991. The first land was acquired in 1928, and since then the forest has continued to grow, with acquisitions as late as 2008. Popular activities at the forest include in-season hunting, horseback-riding, nature observation, and hiking. Redden State Forest is also home to one of Delaware's two forest education centers. The Redden Forest Education Center includes exhibits on the history of forestry in Delaware, forest pests, urban forestry, and the importance of forests within watersheds. =History of Redden State Forest= Redden Lodge was built around 1903 and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It can be found on the Headquarters Tract of Redden State Forest in Sussex County, Delaware Much of Redden State Forest‚Äôs history is tied to the railroad. The Junction & Breakwater Railroad, one of Delaware‚Äôs earliest rail systems, was completed in 1868. A railroad station was established in 1870 near what would later become Redden State Forest. The station was originally known as Carey‚Äôs Station, but a short time later was renamed for Col. William O. Redden. Col. Redden played a prevalent role in Sussex County as he served in the Civil War, was sheriff of Sussex County from 1838‚Äì1840, a member of Delaware‚Äôs House of Representatives from 1840‚Äì1846, including Speaker of the House in 1843, and was instrumental in establishing a railroad system in Delaware. In 1877 a farm near the Redden Station and owned by William W. Donovan proceeded through Orphan‚Äôs Court following his death. This land is now a portion of Redden State Forest‚Äôs Headquarters Tract. Transcripts of the court proceedings mention a large, two-story dwelling with an attached single story, which fits the description of Redden State Forest‚Äôs Manager‚Äôs House (currently the Redden office). Charles C. Stockley, the Governor of Delaware from 1872 to 1876, purchased the Donovan Farm in 1879. In 1901 Frank Thompson purchased of land including the original Donovan Farm. Mr. Thompson was the son of the president of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company. In 1903 the club house (Redden Lodge) appeared on Sussex County tax records. From 1903 to 1919 the Lodge was used by Pennsylvania Railroad Company officials and guests for hunting (primarily quail, since much of the surrounding area at that time was fields and hedgerows). Visitors arrived at the Redden Station by train from Philadelphia and proceeded to the Lodge by horse and buggy. The carriages and horses were kept in the Horse Barn, which is now the Redden Education Center. In 1936 under the leadership of Delaware‚Äôs first State Forester, William S. Taber, the State Forestry Department purchased the that is now the Headquarters Tract from Richard Houghton, who had acquired the property following its use by the Pennsylvania Railroad Company. Since that time, the Headquarters Tract has grown to over . On July 4, 1970, lightning struck the Lodge, and the resulting fire burned the entire west wing and kitchen. The burned section was rebuilt in 1976. In 1990 the Lodge, Manager‚Äôs House, and Horse Barn were placed on the National Register of Historic Places. The Delaware Forest Service acquired funding from the Delaware General Assembly and, working with the Delaware Department of Administrative Services, Division of Facilities Management, renovated these historic structures. The Redden Lodge was rededicated in 1996, the Manager‚Äôs House opened as the Redden office in 1998, and the Horse Barn opened in 2000 as the Education Center. These three structures are now the centerpiece of Redden State Forest. Taber State Forest Taber State Forest covers over in Kent County and is located southwest of Harrington. Parker Road south off of Delaware Route 14, and the Maryland state line generally form the western boundary. About actually extends westward into the state of Maryland. Burrsville Road running southeast from Parker Road cuts through near the center of the land holdings. Saulsbury Creek Road generally forms a boundary for the southwest extent of the property. Taber State Forest is a primitive use facility and there is no formal office onsite. It is primarily used for hunting, hiking, and wildlife habitat. In addition, the forest is also managed for timber production. =History of Taber State Forest= Although officially dedicated in 1994, the origin of Taber State Forest was 1984, when the Delaware Forest Service received the Saulsbury Farm. Also included at Taber State Forest is the building known as the Smith School House (now a residence on the property). The Cooper and Cooper Study (found in the holdings of the Delaware Division of Historical and Cultural Affairs) describes the Smith School as a one-teacher schoolhouse with an average student population of 23. The school operated 180 days of the year.

She turned professional in 1998 and won the 2010 French Open singles title, becoming the first Italian woman to win a Grand Slam event in singles. She was also runner-up at the 2011 French Open. Her career-high ranking is world No. 4, achieved on 31 January 2011. To date, Schiavone is the last one-handed- backhand player to win a Grand Slam title on the women's tour. She won eight WTA singles titles in total, including Roland Garros. In doubles, her career- high ranking is world No. 8, peaking with an appearance in the final of the 2008 French Open. Furthermore, she helped Italy to win the Fed Cup in 2006, 2009 and 2010, and has the most wins for the Italian team. Schiavone played in the longest ever women's singles match at a Grand Slam tournament, when she defeated Svetlana Kuznetsova 6‚Äì4, 1‚Äì6, 16‚Äì14 in the fourth round of the 2011 Australian Open women's singles draw, the match lasted 4 hours and 44 minutes and in the process secured her first and only quarterfinal at the Australian Open. On 5 September 2018, Schiavone announced her retirement from tennis at the US Open. During the announcement, she shared aspirations of winning a Grand Slam as a coach. Personal life Schiavone was born in Milan to Franco Schiavone, from Manocalzati in the Province of Avellino, Campania, Southern Italy, and to Luiscita Minelli, from Bornato in the Province of Brescia, Northern Italy. Playing style Schiavone employs an all-court game and has a very classic approach to her clay game. She uses an extreme eastern grip on her one-handed backhand. Chris Fowler and Brad Gilbert described her forehand as a \\"buggy whip.\\" Professional career Schiavone won eight singles titles on the WTA Tour and also achieved eleven runner-up positions, eight of them since the autumn of 2005. She lost her first eight career finals before finally winning her first title in July 2007. She and her Italian teammates Mara Santangelo, Flavia Pennetta and Roberta Vinci beat the Belgian team 3‚Äì2 in the 2006 Fed Cup final. Justine Henin had to retire in the fifth and final match due to an injury in her right knee, which let Italy win their first Fed Cup trophy.Italy wins the Fed Cup for the first time , FedCup, 17 September 2006 This match was a doubles match and Kirsten Flipkens partnered Henin, and Roberta Vinci partnered Schiavone. In 2009, she won the Fed Cup with Italy for the second time against the US, and also made the quarterfinals of Wimbledon for the first time. In 2010, Italy with Schiavone won the Fed Cup for the third time. In addition, she realized a notable victory during the quarterfinals of the 2008 Dubai Open, when she upset world No. 1 and four-time champion Henin 7‚Äì6, 7‚Äì6. She also beat Am√©lie Mauresmo in a Fed Cup tie in 2006 when Mauresmo was ranked No. 1. Partnering with Australian Casey Dellacqua, Schiavone was the runner-up in the women's doubles competition at the 2008 French Open where they lost to Anabel Medina Garrigues and Virginia Ruano Pascual. Schiavone also reached the semifinals of the doubles event at the other three Grand Slam tournaments. =2010: First major title at Roland Garros= At the Australian Open, Francesca defeated Frenchwomen Aliz√© Cornet 0‚Äì6, 7‚Äì5, 6‚Äì0, and Julie Coin 6‚Äì3, 6‚Äì4 first before upsetting No. 10 seed Agnieszka Radwa≈Ñska 6‚Äì2, 6‚Äì2. Though she matched her best results there (round four), she went on to lose to No. 6 seed Venus Williams after winning the first set, 6‚Äì3, 2‚Äì6, 1‚Äì6. She beat Alberta Brianti, Tathiana Garbin, Carla Su√°rez Navarro, Yaroslava Shvedova, and Roberta Vinci all in straight sets to win her third WTA title at the Barcelona Ladies Open. Seeded 17th entering the French Open, Schiavone was lightly regarded as a contender for the championship. She defeated Regina Kulikova, Sophie Ferguson, 11th seed Li Na, and 30th seed Maria Kirilenko to reach her first French Open quarterfinal since 2001 (where she had lost to Martina Hingis). There, she defeated world No. 3, Caroline Wozniacki, in straight sets to become the first Italian woman to reach the semifinals of a Grand Slam singles event. The semifinals of the French Open consisted of four players (Jelena Jankoviƒá, Elena Dementieva, Samantha Stosur and Schiavone) who had never won a Grand Slam singles event; nevertheless, most in the tennis community, including ESPN's tennis commentary team of Mary Joe Fern√°ndez, Patrick McEnroe, and Brad Gilbert singled out Schiavone as the one player who was not a serious contender to win the title. In the semifinals, Schiavone defeated world No. 5 and 2004 finalist, Dementieva (she retired in the second set with a torn calf muscle having lost the first set in a tiebreaker), and the victory made Schiavone the first Italian woman to reach a Grand Slam final, and assured that she would become a top-ten player for the first time following the tournament. In the final, Schiavone faced Stosur in a rematch of their first-round meeting at the 2009 French Open which Stosur had won easily (6‚Äì4, 6‚Äì2). Because of this previous result, and Stosur's victories over four-time French Open champion Justine Henin, world No. 1 Serena Williams and world No. 4 Jankoviƒá en route to the final, Stosur was considered a heavy favorite-. However, on 5 June 2010, Schiavone defied expectations to become the first Italian woman to win a Grand Slam singles title, beating Stosur 6‚Äì4, 7‚Äì6. The victory made her only the third Italian player to win a Grand Slam event in singles, after Nicola Pietrangeli and Adriano Panatta. She also became the oldest woman to win a first Grand Slam title in the Open Era, beating the previous record by Jana Novotn√°. The victory also meant she rose to No. 6 in the world rankings on 7 June 2010 and became the highest-ranked Italian woman ever, after Flavia Pennetta reached world No. 10 in 2009. Schiavone's next event was Eastbourne, where she lost in the first round to Sorana C√Ærstea, 5‚Äì7, 3‚Äì6. As the fifth seed at Wimbledon, due to the pre-tournament withdrawal of Dementieva, she lost to Vera Dushevina in the first round, 7‚Äì6, 5‚Äì7, 1‚Äì6. Schiavone reached the quarterfinals of the Rogers Cup, where she fell to top seed Caroline Wozniacki. She was the sixth seed at the US Open, and defeated Ayumi Morita, Maria Elena Camerin, 29th seed Alona Bondarenko, and 20th seed Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova to advance to the quarterfinals for the first time since 2003 (where she had lost to Jennifer Capriati). In the quarterfinals, she fell to seven-time Grand Slam singles champion No. 3 seed Venus Williams 6‚Äì7, 4‚Äì6. As the fifth seed, Schiavone reached the semifinals of the Pan Pacific Open, where she fell to seventh seed Elena Dementieva. At the season-ending Tour Championships, Schiavone competed for the first time in her career but was eliminated in the round-robin stage. She fell to Caroline Wozniacki in three sets, and Sam Stosur in two sets before defeating Elena Dementieva in what would be Dementieva's final career match. =2011= Schiavone began the year at the Hopman Cup representing Italy. In singles, she defeated Laura Robson, but fell to Bethanie Mattek-Sands. Schiavone retired with an injury against Kristina Mladenovic. Seeded sixth at the Australian Open, Schiavone advanced to the quarterfinals for the first time in her career upon a victory over 23rd-seeded and two-time Grand Slam champion Svetlana Kuznetsova. The fourth- round encounter lasted nearly five hours (4:44; 47 games in total), and Schiavone saved six match points before finally prevailing 6‚Äì4, 1‚Äì6, 16‚Äì14. With this win, Schiavone rose in the rankings to world No. 4 after the tournament, the highest ranking ever achieved by an Italian woman, improving her own record. In the quarterfinal against world No. 1, Caroline Wozniacki, Schiavone was a set and 3‚Äì1 up in the second set, but was broken twice by Wozniacki in the same set and twice in the third, to lose 6‚Äì3, 3‚Äì6, 3‚Äì6 after saving three match points. At the Dubai Tennis Championships, Schiavone was seeded third, but fell in the round of 16 to Kuznetsova. At the Qatar Ladies Open in Doha, she fell to Peng Shuai in the round of 16. She then fell to eventual champion Jelena Dokic at the Malaysian Open. Schiavone then reached the round of 16 again at the BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells, falling to Shahar Pe'er. Seeded fifth at the Sony Ericsson Open in Miami, she reached the round of 16, losing to Agnieszka Radwa≈Ñska. Schiavone began her clay-court season with a round of 16 loss to Radwa≈Ñska at the Porsche Tennis Grand Prix. She then reached the round of 16 at the Mutua Madrid Open, falling to Mattek- Sands. Following Madrid, Schiavone reached the quarterfinals of the Internazionali BNL d'Italia, losing to world No. 7, Sam Stosur, in a rematch of the 2010 French Open final. She then lost to world No. 1, Caroline Wozniacki, in three sets during the semifinals of the Brussels Open, the last tournament before the French Open. Schiavone was the fifth seed and defending champion at the French Open. She beat Melanie Oudin, Vesna Dolonts, 29th seed Peng Shuai, tenth seed Jelena Jankoviƒá, 14th seed Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova, and 11th seed Marion Bartoli to reach the final where she lost to Li Na, 4‚Äì6, 6‚Äì7. She then switched to the grass courts, falling to Agnieszka Radwa≈Ñska at the Aegon International in her only Wimbledon warmup. She was the sixth seed at the Wimbledon Championships, losing in the third round to Tamira Paszek of Austria. During the Rogers Cup, Schiavone won her opening-round match against Ekaterina Makarova but fell in the third round to Lucie ≈†af√°≈ôov√°. The Western & Southern Open saw another early round loss for Schiavone. It took her three sets to defeat Maria Kirilenko in her opening round match. She then lost to former world No. 1, Jelena Jankoviƒá, in a third round three-setter. Just before the US Open Schiavone entered the New Haven Open. She defeated Alexandra Dulgheru and Monica Niculescu in the first two rounds. Her quarterfinal match against Anabel Medina Garrigues was a walkover. Schiavone was defeated by Wozniacki in straight sets in the semifinals. At the US Open, she reached the fourth round where she lost to Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova. At the China Open Schiavone emerged victorious in the first round against Bojana Jovanovski but was then defeated in the second round by Dominika Cibulkov√°. =2012= Schiavone at the 2012 French Open Schiavone began the season at the Brisbane International. Seeded third, she reached the semifinal where she lost to eventual champion Kaia Kanepi. Schiavone struggled whilst representing Italy at Fed Cup versus Ukraine, losing to a non-top-100 player Lesia Tsurenko comprehensively 1‚Äì6, 2‚Äì6 and barely getting past Kateryna Bondarenko, 6‚Äì7, 7‚Äì5, 6‚Äì4. Despite her struggles, Italy still managed to progress through to the semifinals. Schiavone played in the mini gulf series in Doha and Dubai losing early in both of them as the seventh seed; Doha in the second round to Yanina Wickmayer 4‚Äì6, 6‚Äì7 and in her Dubai opener to Ana Ivanovic 1‚Äì6, 5‚Äì7. At the BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells, she (as 10th seed) avenged her Fed Cup loss by beating Lesia Tsurenko, 6‚Äì2, 6‚Äì4, before retiring against Lucie ≈†af√°≈ôov√° in the third round after losing the first set 6‚Äì2. With the same seeding in Miami, she lost to Ksenia Pervak 4‚Äì6, 6‚Äì4, 4‚Äì7 in her opener, blowing a 3‚Äì0 final-set lead. After lackluster results, the clay-court season was a chance for Schiavone to get back on form on her favorite surface, but as the top seed at the Barcelona Ladies Open, her poor form continued as she lost to Olga Govorstova, 4‚Äì6, 3‚Äì6 in her opening match. She represented Italy in Fed Cup semifinals against Czech Republic, losing both of her matches to Lucie ≈†af√°≈ôov√°, 6‚Äì7, 1‚Äì6, and to Petra Kvitov√°, 4‚Äì6, 6‚Äì7. Italy lost the tie 1‚Äì4. After passing her opening round in Stuttgart against Monica Niculescu, she lost in the second round to No. 3 seed Petra Kvitov√°, 2‚Äì6, 2‚Äì6. She also lost her opener in Madrid to Varvara Lepchenko and Rome to Ekaterina Makarova.

Personification of \\"Italy\\", 1919 Semi-postal overprinted ‚ÄúValore globale‚Äù The first postage stamps for Fiume were issued 1 December 1918 by the Italian National Council which governed the city. They were produced by overprinting ‚ÄúFIUME‚Äù on the contemporary stamps of Hungary. Both handstamping and printing presses were used. In January 1919, two postage due and a savings bank stamp were surcharged as well. These stamps‚Äîeven the most common values‚Äîwere extensively forged. Serious collectors will require close examination of all stamps. January also saw the first appearance of an issue produced specifically for Fiume. It consisted of 17 values, ranging from 2 centesimi to 10 corone, and used four designs: a figure representing ‚ÄúItaly‚Äù, the town clock tower with an Italian flag hanging from it, an allegory of ‚ÄúRevolution‚Äù, and a sailor raising the Italian flag. The first printings were inscribed just ‚ÄúFIUME‚Äù, while in July they were redesigned with the inscription ‚ÄúPOSTA FIUME‚Äù, along with other minor changes. Meanwhile, a set of 12 semi-postal stamps was issued 18 May, commemorating the 200th day of peace since the end of the war. Later in 1919 the higher values were surcharged with lower values, and the semi- postals were overprinted ‚ÄúValore globale‚Äù for use as regular stamps.  The Regency of Carnaro  This confusing situation was exploited by the Italian poet Gabriele d'Annunzio, who entered the city on 12 September 1919 and began a 15-month period of occupation. On 8 September 1920, d'Annunzio established the Italian Regency of Carnaro in Fiume. On 12 September, 1920, the first anniversary of the city‚Äôs takeover by the forces of Gabriele d‚ÄôAnnunzio, the city government issued a series of 14 values featuring a portrait bust of d‚ÄôAnnunzio, intended for regular use. A set of four with various allegorical designs was issued, intended for the use of the legionnaires on that day only. On 18 November, the set of four of 12 September were overprinted ‚ÄúARBE‚Äù and ‚ÄúVEGLIA‚Äù, marking the occupation of the islands of Arbe and Veglia, and on 20 November, more were overprinted ‚ÄúReggenza / Italiana / del / Carnaro‚Äù (Italian Regency of Carnaro), and with new values.

ASCM fosters liberal and progressive religious and social views and has been associated with the social gospel, Christian socialist and environmentalist movements and is generally part of the Christian left. The ASCM sees itself as: *Open ‚Ä¶ encouraging spiritual growth through understanding and tolerance of others‚Äô viewpoints. *Ecumenical ‚Ä¶ welcoming and affirming members from all denominations and valuing the rich diversity of Christian traditions and those of other faiths, while seeking unity in prayer and action. *Active ‚Ä¶ seeking God‚Äôs desire for peace, justice and liberation from oppression throughout the Bible and life of Jesus, and responding to God‚Äôs call for conversion of self and transformation of society. *Critical ‚Ä¶ taking the learning of students seriously and looking to theology, the sciences and the humanities to provide new perspectives on faith and a deeper understanding of truth and life. Described as a 'university within a university,' the ASCM was formed in 1896 and is one of the oldest student groups in existence in Australia. Originally named the Australian Student Christian Union, the name changed gradually during the period between the wars to reflect the idea of movement rather than organisation. The title ASCM was formally adopted in the early 1930s.R. Howe, A Century of Influence: The Australian Student Christian Movement, (Sydney: UNSW Press, 2009). The ASCM was involved in the formation of the National Union of Students, the Overseas Service Bureau and the Uniting Church in Australia. Inauguration The Australasian Student Christian Union was established at a meeting in Wyselaski Hall, Ormond College, University of Melbourne, in 1896, fourteen years before the 1910 Edinburgh Missionary Conference that is commonly considered to have inaugurated the modern ecumenical movement. At the time Australia had only four universities, which were strongly opposed to any religious activities taking place on their secular campuses. Yet those who created the ASCM fervently believed that Christian students could be agents of change in the university, the nation and the world. Activism The ASCM has had a long history of activism, which led to the movement being monitored by the Commonwealth Investigations Branch (CIB) and Australian Security Intelligence Organisation in the 1940s and 1950s, worried about the ASCM's work with refugees and the pacifism and conscientious objection of some of its members. During the Vietnam War the ASCM was involved in subverting the Draft and providing support for so-called draft dodgers. Today the ASCM is involved in the struggles for the liberation of women and of gay, lesbian and bisexual people, in the work against racism against both migrant and Aboriginal people and the exploitation of the people and lands of the Asia-Pacific region. This is reflected in the history of the ASCM with their explicit support for Gandhi, the equality of women and their activism for changes to the White Australia policy which reached its climax in the 1960s with the Sydney branch leading the way.Howe, A Century of Influence ASCM are still politically active and continue to offer opportunities for students to be involved in Human Rights and a world wide recognition of women's rights in differing cultures. ASCM is seen to promote a mature faith of intellectual engagement. Affiliations It is affiliated with the World Student Christian Federation and has close ties to the National Council of Churches in Australia, the Christian Conference of Asia and to the World Council of Churches. ASCM is part of the World Student Christian Federation Asia-Pacific Region with a biannual Regional Committee Meeting and the Pacific Sub-region (Australia, Aotearoa/New Zealand with Fiji and Papua New Guinea not active. Conflict There is at times conflict with conservative evangelical Christian groups on campus, such as the Australian Fellowship of Evangelical Students (affiliated to the parachurch International Fellowship of Evangelical Students). While the formation of the ASCM was inspired by the charismatic American evangelical ecumenist, John R. Mott, from the beginning the Australian movement had a tense relationship with evangelicalism, deciding not to adopt Mott‚Äôs watchword of ‚Äúthe evangelisation of the world in this generation‚Äù. The ASCM refused to hold American-style university missions; encouraged liberal Biblical interpretation; and supported the modernist side in the modernist- fundamentalist controversy of the 1920s. In 1930 the Evangelical Union split off from the ASCM; a division that has never been healed. While this split was seen as a catastrophe, by no longer feeling the constraint of conservativism, ASCM had the flexibility to explore liberal issues in a more consistent and concise way. The areas of engagement included science, psychology, humanism and Communism amongst many others.Howe, A Century of Influence In the early years of the ASCM's history, conflict was often over issues of theology and biblical interpretation. In later decades the conflict was often over social issues, including sexuality. Since the 1990s, the ASCM has promoted itself as queer- friendly and has supported gay, lesbian and bisexual Christians who have felt hurt by their treatment within conservative Christian groups.

Notated chess moves are presented in the table from left to right. Variations on a given line are given horizontally below the parent line.  Arrangement  Chess opening theory tables are commonly published in opening books with annotations by experienced chess players. These tables are typically arranged in a compact manner to allow experienced players to see variations from a position quickly. Usually, the table indicates that either White or Black has equal, slightly better, or better chances at the end of the variation. Often, this information is distilled down to mere symbols (\\"Œ£\\" for example) or the percentage of games (usually tournament games) where White won ‚Äì no information is usually given on what the assessment is based on or how to proceed in the game.  Shortcomings  Chess opening theory books that provide these tables are usually quite large and difficult for beginners to use. Because the table entries typically do not include the themes or goals involved in a given line, beginners will either try to memorize the tables or simply drown in the detail. The Wikibook Chess Opening Theory aims to bridge this gap by providing this type of information at the end of each line.  Notation  Typically, each table has a heading indicating the moves required to reach the position for which the table provides an analysis. The example below is for the opening position, so no moves are shown in the heading. The first row provides the move numbers with subsequent rows representing different variations. Since the initial position is not always the opening position, these numbers will not always start at \\"1.\\" White half-moves are shown above black half-moves. Ellipses (...) represent moves that, for the variation, are identical to the variation above. Bold type indicates that another variation is considered elsewhere ‚Äì usually in another table. A hyphen (-) or en dash (‚Äì) indicates that the variation transposes to a variation elsewhere. Transpositions are common in chess ‚Äì a given position can often be reached by different move orders ‚Äì even move orders with more or fewer moves. The table may also provide percentage of games won by white for each variation, based on the results of the games considered in creating the table. Development Chess openings are studied in great depth by serious players. \\"Novelties\\", or new, previously unexplored variations are often discovered and played by professional players. These new lines can refute lines that were previously thought to be sound. The games that represent this discovery process are represented in these ever-changing and expanding tables. With the advent of computer databases, even the most casual player can explore an opening line deeply, looking for novelties to spring on their opponents.

It is a small bird, with mature adults reaching only in length. The male has a green back and forehead, with rust-colored (rufous) flanks, rump, and tail. The male's throat is an iridescent orange-red. The female and immature Allen's hummingbirds are similarly colored, but lack the iridescent throat patch, instead having a series of speckles on their throats. Females are mostly green, featuring rufous color only on the tail, which also has white tips. Immature Allen's hummingbirds are so similar to the female rufous hummingbird, the two are almost indistinguishable in the field. Both species' breeding seasons and ranges are common factors used to differentiate between the two species in a particular geographical area. Distribution Allen's hummingbird is common only in the brushy woods, gardens, and meadows of coastal California from Santa Barbara north, and southern coastal Oregon. The nominate race of Allen's hummingbird, S. s. sasin, is migratory, and winters along the Pacific coast of central Mexico. A second, S. s. sedentarius, is a permanent resident on the Channel Islands off southern California. This population colonized the Palos Verdes Peninsula of Los Angeles County in the 1960s and has since spread over much of Los Angeles and Orange Counties, south through San Diego County, and east to the western end of Riverside County. Behavior Male Allen's hummingbird The courtship flight of male Allen's hummingbirds is a frantic back-and-forth flight arc of about similar to the motion of a swinging pendulum, followed by a high-speed dive from about during which tail feathers emit a characteristic sharp flutter to further attract attention of the female. Aggressive and territorial, male Allen's hummingbirds will chase any other males from their territory, as well as any other hummingbird species, and have even been known to attack and rout predatory birds several times larger than themselves, such as kestrels and hawks. Allen's hummingbird constructs its nest out of plant fibers, down, and weed stems, coating the nest with lichens and spider webs to give it structure. The nest is placed above ground on a tree branch or the stalk or stem of a plant. The female lays one or two white eggs, which she incubates for 15 to 17 days. The young leave the nest about three weeks after hatching. The mother continues to feed the fledglings for several more weeks, then the young are left to fend for themselves. Like all hummingbirds, Allen's hummingbird's high rate of metabolism requires it to feed frequently. It drinks nectar from flowers and eats any small insects in flight or on flower blossoms, providing needed protein. Name The common name commemorates Charles Andrew Allen (1841‚Äì1930), American collector and taxidermist. A hybrid between this species and Anna's hummingbird has been described as Floresi's hummingbird, \\"Selasphorus\\" floresii.

He is currently an adjunct professor at the College of Information and Computer Sciences, at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.  Biography  While working towards his B.A. in physics at Harvard College in 1967, Sproull met Ivan Sutherland. Together, they worked on head-mounted displays, which led the way for 3-dimensional virtual reality. Sproull received his master's degree in Computer Science from Stanford University in 1970, and Doctorate in Computer Science from Stanford in 1977. Sproull worked as a researcher for Xerox Palo Alto Research Center from December 1973 to August 1977. While at Xerox PARC, he worked on the design of the Alto personal computer, the first laser printers, page description languages and the initial PC-type operating systems. In 1973, Sproull and William M. Newman wrote Principles of Interactive Computer Graphics; a second edition was published in 1979. This was the first comprehensive textbook on computer graphics, and was regarded as the graphics \\"bible,\\" until it was succeeded by Foley and van Dam's Computer Graphics: Principles and Practice. Sproull was an Associate Professor of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University. In 1980, Bob Sproull and Ivan Sutherland founded a consulting firm, Sutherland, Sproull and Associates. In 1990, Sun Microsystems bought out Sutherland, Sproull and Associates for its patents and key people. This led to the creation of Sun Microsystems Laboratories, where Sproull worked on asynchronous processor design. In 2006 he became director of the laboratories. In 2010 after Sun was purchased by Oracle Corporation, it became Oracle Labs. Sproull is also a member of the National Academy of Engineering, a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and has served on the US Air Force Scientific Advisory Board. He currently chairs the United States National Research Council's Computer Science and Telecommunications Board (CSTB). He has co-authored several books in addition to Principles of Interactive Computer Graphics, such as Logical Effort, and holds 7 patents.  Publications  * Newman, W., Sproull, R.

A training bus is a special kind of bus or coach that is used by bus operators for training the driving skills of bus drivers. It is also used to train the driving skill of a person who is learning to become a bus driver. Driving a training bus on the road is an important part of driving training, as it is the most practical to train one's driving skill. A training bus is usually a bus that has been retired from the passenger-serving fleet. Some bus companies may like to repaint the bus with a special livery for training bus after the bus is retired from the passenger-serving fleet, which is usually white or a plainer version of the company's regular livery. Some bus companies may also remove most of the facilities (such as passenger seats) from a training bus, so that those facilities can be installed onto some newer buses. On a training bus, there is usually another seat for the driving instructor (trainer) next to the driver's seat. This allows the instructor to monitor how trainee is driving and give appropriate instruction when necessary. They may also have a separate handbrake or foot-operated brake in order to slow or stop the bus. Hong Kong The use of training buses for practical training is especially popular among the Hong Kong franchised bus companies. In Hong Kong, training buses are known in Chinese as \\"Ë®ìÁ∑¥Â∑¥Â£´\\" (pinyin: X√πn li√†n bƒÅ Sh√¨). Training buses used in Hong Kong, such as those used at Kowloon Motor Bus, are typically buses that are older buses and retired from its main bus fleet, therefore only used for training purposes and not for passenger services. However, for route training and other service or safety improvement trainings, in-service buses may be used. Other places In contrast, other jurisdictions may use active-service buses for training; this will be at non- peak service times when more buses are available. The head sign may be set to read 'TRAINING', and a sign mounted at the rear as well.

It is situated roughly halfway between the towns of Barboursville to the west and Milton to the east. Ona is a part of the Huntington-Ashland, WV-KY-OH, Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA). As of the 2010 census, the MSA had a population of 287,702. New definitions from February 28, 2013 placed the population at 363,000.  Landmarks  Ona is home to three notable places. The first is Cabell Midland High School, which is the consolidated regional secondary school for students living in the eastern half of Cabell County. This is a rather large high school of modern construction, with extensive athletic facilities. The student population varies from 1,500 to 2,000 students. A second landmark is the Ona Speedway. This is a prime location for local stock-car racing competitions. The track has had its share of financial difficulties and has been closed several times in prior years. It has, however, been operating continuously since 2006. The last time NASCAR held a Cup level race on a Tuesday was Aug. 11, 1970, when Richard Petty won the West Virginia 300 in Ona. The third landmark is the Ona Airpark. This airstrip consists of a 3154x40 foot runway (heading 064/244 magnetic) with an associated taxiway, 48 hangars, FBO and a parking lot. Flying lessons are offered Hangar 9 Aviation on site. The airport's IATA Airport Code is 12V, and its CTAF frequency is 122.8 MHz. Landing and departure control are conducted from Charleston's Yeager Airport. Ona Airpark does not have its own control tower. Ona is also home to the Ona Little League Athletic Complex which sits just across the Mud River from the Ona Airpark.

Based on the 1901 short story \\"Amy Foster\\" by Joseph Conrad, the film is about a doomed love affair between a simple country girl and a Ukrainian peasant who is swept onto the Cornish shore in 1888 after his emigrant ship sinks on its way to America. Plot Yanko G√≥ral (Vincent Perez), a Ukrainian peasant, is swept ashore on the coast of Cornwall, England, after his emigrant ship sinks on its way to America in 1888. The bodies of his fellow passengers wash ashore and are soon buried in a mass grave. Yanko makes his way to the Swaffer farm, where his dishevelled appearance frightens the family. Amy Foster (Rachel Weisz), however, is not frightened by the stranger. Amy is a loner who visits her parents, Mary and Isaac Foster (Zo√´ Wanamaker and Tom Bell), every Sunday, despite receiving very little love from them. Her father calls her a \\"queer sort\\" who collects things that wash ashore, and blames her for his scandalous marriage‚ÄîMary was already pregnant before they were married. Amy attends to Yanko‚Äîwashing, feeding, and caring for him. The next morning, Yanko is taken away by the townspeople to work as slave labour. A few months later, Dr. Kennedy (Ian McKellen) and Mr. Swaffer (Joss Ackland) are playing chess when Yanko approaches and shows the men a series of brilliant chess moves. Dr. Kennedy soon determines that the man is in fact Ukrainian. Having gained a newfound respect for the stranger, the Swaffers take him in, start paying him for his labor, and give him normal working hours. Yanko learns from the doctor that Miss Swaffer (Kathy Bates), on the eve of her wedding day, had a horse-riding accident and broke her spine. The doctor also reveals that he lost his wife and son to typhus \\"many lifetimes ago.\\" The doctor's fatherly affection for Yanko is evident in their meetings, where Yanko learns English and the doctor learns chess. Yanko purchases a new suit of clothes with the wages he's saved up, which gives him the courage to visit Amy and ask her to walk out with him. When Mr. Swaffer learns of Yanko's interest in Amy, he tries to dissuade her from any romantic involvement. Amy's parents also urge her to stay away‚Äîher mother warning her that love is \\"God's trick upon women.\\" When Yanko goes to church, he encounters a hostility in the congregation that bewilders him. \\"Their eyes are like glass,\\" he later tells Amy, who finds him at the obelisk memorial for the ship's dead. There he learns for the first time what happened to his fellow passengers. To escape the hate, Amy takes Yanko to her secret cave filled with treasures she found on the shore, which she calls \\"gifts from the sea.\\" Yanko and Amy dance and embrace in the cave. Soon after, while walking alone in town, Yanko is set upon by Amy's father and his thuggish friends, beaten up, and nearly drowned before being saved by Amy, who takes care of him in the coming days. Meanwhile, Dr. Kennedy has little sympathy for Amy, whom he considers \\"a little strange\\" and \\"slow of the mind\\". Kennedy chastises the father and his thuggish friends for their actions. Amy's father, however, retains his hatred for Amy whom he reveals to be in fact the child of his father, saying, \\"Not a tear. Bad you were conceived and bad you've remained.\\" After someone sets fire to Amy's cave, Miss Swaffer arranges for the cottage to be given to Amy and Yanko, who are soon married in church. Afterwards, they make love in the cave pool, with Yanko saying, \\"We are the lucky ones.\\" Later that year they have a son, who is delivered by the doctor. Amy asks Yanko to show the child the sea, and he does, while the doctor looks on approvingly. Amy's new-found happiness, however, is soon cut short by the town's children who taunt her and call her a witch. When Yanko learns of this, he is angry and shares his feelings with Dr. Kennedy, who tries to console him. Believing he cannot leave because Amy has found a home in Cornwall, Yanko's greater concern is for his child and his future. Yanko tells the doctor, \\"I want him to be like you ... I want him to have the learning of great men. I want him to love the mystery of our universe.\\" The doctor pledges to help his son. One day Yanko becomes sick with a fever. Dr. Kennedy arrives and treats him, gives Amy medicine to give to Yanko, and urges her to stay with him while the doctor continues his rounds. Unfortunately, Yanko's condition worsens and he becomes delirious‚Äîseeing a vision of his sinking ship. Unable to understand what he's saying, Amy doesn't know what to do, and when Yanko loses control, Amy flees the cottage with the child in a rainstorm in search of help. Her first stop is at her parents' house, but her mother turns her away. On the road she stops a neighbor and pleads for help, but is also rejected. Finally, she makes it to the Swaffers' house, and Miss Swaffer agrees to watch the baby while Mr. Swaffer accompanies Amy back to her cottage. Meanwhile, Dr. Kennedy returns to the cottage and discovers Yanko lying on the floor near death. Shortly after, Amy arrives and takes her dying husband in her arms as he says, \\"I would change nothing, my love, my gold‚Äîwe are the lucky ones.\\" In the coming weeks, Dr. Kennedy complains to Miss Swaffer about Amy not showing appropriate grief for her deceased husband. He wonders how she could wipe Yanko's memory from her mind so easily, but Miss Swaffer points out that the doctor has wiped from his memory his own ghosts of his dead wife and son. Soon after, Dr. Kennedy visits Amy and apologizes for wronging her, asks to be forgiven, and the two embrace. Amy declares, \\"I will love him until the end of the world.\\" Dr. Kennedy concludes his story to Miss Swaffer saying, \\"He came across the world to love and be loved by Amy Foster.\\" Cast * Rachel Weisz as Amy Foster * Vincent P√©rez as Yanko Gooral * Ian McKellen as Dr. James Kennedy * Kathy Bates as Miss Swaffer * Joss Ackland as Mr. Swaffer * Tony Haygarth as Mr. Smith * Fiona Victory as Mrs. Smith * Tom Bell as Isaac Foster * Zo√´ Wanamaker as Mary Foster * Neil Rutherford as Brother Petr Production It was produced by Tapson Steel Films and Phoenix Pictures, in association with Canal+.

In his review in the Chicago Sun-Times, Roger Ebert gave the film two stars, calling it \\"a disappointment, a film in which good and evil dutifully go through their paces, while the character who could have added complexity and intrigue remains, unfortunately, unrealized.\\" In their review in Spirituality & Practice, Frederic and Mary Ann Brussat wrote, \\"Screenplay writer Tim Willocks has done a masterful job delineating the passionate love affair between these two outsiders who find in each other all they need. Even more impressive is director Beeban Kidron's respect for the mystery of human personality.\\" Terence Davies later cast Rachel Weisz in The Deep Blue Sea after seeing her performance in this film.

She is based at the network's studios in Manhattan. Biography A native of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Moos originally wanted to pursue a career in print journalism, but while attending the S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications at Syracuse University (where she earned a bachelor's degree in TV-Radio), she decided to go into the television business instead. In 1976, she landed her first major job in television at WPTZ in Plattsburgh, New York, as the station's first female correspondent. During her tenure at WPTZ, she covered local and national stories, including the 1980 winter Olympic Games in Lake Placid, New York. In 1981 she joined CNN as a reporter. It was there that she covered stories ranging from political corruption to the United Nations during the 1991 Gulf War. In the 1990s, Moos began to report on unusual and off-beat soft news stories, which is her current trademark. In 1995, she began a series of reports called \\"Making The MOOSt Of It.\\" Today Moos continues to file reports for CNN in a segment called \\"Moost Unusual,\\" seen during The Situation Room and during Showbiz Tonight on CNN Headline News. These stories tend to focus on subjects related to popular culture and make use of man-on- the-street style interviews, shots of tabloid magazine headlines, and clips garnered from videos on YouTube. They also frequently take viewers behind the scenes, showing Moos placing prank calls from her office or cracking jokes with other employees in CNN's Manhattan studios.  Controversy  In April 2014, Moos was forced to apologize following CNN's airing of a segment titled \\"Man in thong: Eyes up here, Duchess!\\", which was deemed \\"insensitive\\" and \\"racist\\" by viewers. In the roughly two-minute video, Moos mocked New Zealand Maori culture including traditional dance, costume, a greeting ceremony, and the haka, which she described as \\"a cross between a Chippendales lap dance and the mating dance of an emu.\\" See also * Cable news in the United States * New Yorkers in journalism References Category:American television reporters and correspondents Category:American humorists Category:S.

The typical clutch is three white eggs, which are marked with brown. The adult scrub greenlet is 11.5 cm long and weighs 13 g. It is mainly green on the upperparts, with brighter wings and rump, and an olive-brown head with very weak supercilium and yellowish eyering. The underparts are yellow, the bill is mainly dark and the legs are pale. The call is a long series of notes, weary-weary-weary- weary, interspersed with churrs and squeaks. The race H. f. insularis is a large, strong-billed form with a brown iris endemic to Tobago. Other races differ in underpart tone. Scrub greenlets feed on insects and spiders taken from the upper and middle levels of tree foliage. They also eat berries, especially before migration.

Marie Henri Daniel Gauthier, comte de Rigny (; 2 February 1782 ‚Äì 6 November 1835) was the commander of the French squadron at the Battle of Navarino in the Greek War of Independence. Biography He was a nephew of Baron Joseph Dominique, baron Louis, and son of a former captain in the Penthi√®vre Dragoon regiment, and who died leaving five small boys, including his brother, the future General Rigny. The French Revolution led him out of the Pont-√†-Mousson school, where he had been sent. He was ten years old then, had lost his father and his mother was listed as the list of emigrants. An aunt collected the family, consisting of a young girl of sixteen years and five boys, including Henry, the eldest. After spending several months in Special School in Brest, where he had been sent there to finish his studies, in 1798, he entered the navy as a midshipman with Admiral √âtienne Eustache Bruix. In 1799 he was appointed midshipman. He assisted in the blockade of Porto Ferrajo and the Battle of Algeciras, and then he made the Egyptian campaign, and took part in the Saint-Domingue expedition, Corsica and Spain. In 1803 he was appointed ensign and as such sent to the camp of Boulogne, he was responsible for commanding the corvette La Triomphante. Interrogated by Napoleon about the tides for the invasion of England, the young sailor gave to the Emperor a response strong and concise. Embedded with the marines of the Guard in the Army in 1806 and 1807, he made in the course of two years these campaigns Prussia, Poland and Pomerania; fought at Jena, to Pu≈Çtusk, the siege of Stralsund and Graudentz, where he was wounded. Assigned to the army of Spain in 1808, he became aide-de-camp of Marshal Bessi√®res; he distinguished himself at the Battle of Medina de Rioseco, and was wounded at the Battle of Somosierra, and he witnessed the capture of Madrid, in 1809, and the Battle of Wagram. In 1816, he was elevated to the rank of captain. In 1822 he received the command of the French naval forces assembled in the Levant (flagship the frigate M√©d√©e). He soon raised the French flag daily in these waters against the Greek and Turkish pirates, his intelligent care settled in the Archipelago Police navigation. He was appointed Admiral in 1825, and raised his pennant in his flagship Sir√®ne. In September 1827 the French government tasked him with the enforcement of the joint resolution by France, Russia, and England, who had united to wrest Greece to the Turkish rule. He commanded the French fleet at the Battle of Navarino on 20 October 1827, which action earned him the Cross of the Order of the Bath, the Order of St. Alexander Nevsky, and promotion to Vice-Admiral.C.

Charpentier, E. Fasquelle, Paris, 1897 Back in France after the evacuation of the Morea, which he chaired, the Admiral was appointed maritime prefect of Toulon in 1829. In 1829 Charles X awarded him the title of Count of Rigny, but he refused until 8 August that year, the portfolio of the Navy in the Polignac ministry. Admiral Count Rigny went into the Levant to resume command of the fleet. Returning to Toulon for health reasons, in September 1830 he was appointed to the Board of Admiralty, and received the decoration of Grand Officer of the Legion of Honor. Called in 1831 to the Chamber of Deputies by a double election, Admiral Rigny received, on 3 March that year, Louis-Philippe, the portfolio of the navy. Assigned on 4 April 1834, the Department of Foreign Affairs, he started that administration of a new activity. On 17 September 1834 he married Adele Defontaine Narcissus, of Mons (born 13 May 1803), widow in her first marriage to a wealthy Belgian businessman, Daniel Honnor Florent Fran√ßois (1780‚Äì1830), with whom she had two daughters: Elise (1826‚Äì1876), later Duchess of Padua by his marriage with Louis Arrighi de Casanova, and Leonie (1829‚Äì1892), later Marchioness of Talhou√´t by her marriage with Auguste de Talhou√´t-Roy. On 12 March 1835 his health became increasingly unsteady, forcing him to resign his ministerial duties, but in August, he accepted a short mission to Naples. He was barely back in late October, when he felt the first attacks of which he succumbed on the night of 6 to 7 November 1835 at the age of 52 years. After his death, his widow gave birth to a daughter, Amelia Marie Gaultier Rigny, born on 7 February 1868. She married Baron Verneaux and died on 6 July 1868 at the Chateau de Ris Ris-Orangis.

Personal life Born in Zuidlaren, in the north east of the Netherlands, Van Heiden was the second son of Sigismund Pieter Alexander Reichsgraf van Heiden, Lord of Reinestein and Laarwoud, Drost of Drenthe, and Marie Frederique Freiin van Reede. He is the only Dutch naval hero to have come from the landlocked province of Drenthe. Van Heiden married Anne-Marie Akeleye, daughter of Captain Johannes Akeleye, a Danish-born sea officer in Russian service. They had four children, including their sons Friedrich Moritz and Ludwig Heinrich Sigismund van Heiden, the future Governor-General of the Grand Duchy of Finland.Genealogisches Handbuch der baltischen Ritterschaften Teil 2,3: Estland, G√∂rlitz 1930 Early naval career Lodewijk van Heiden joined the Dutch Navy at the age of nine, and was promoted to Lieutenant-at-sea at sixteen. He made several journeys to the Dutch overseas territories during his six years in active duty. He remained a faithful Orangeist and accompanied Stadtholder William V on his flight from Scheveningen to England. Upon his return to the Netherlands he was captured and locked up in the ill-reputed Gevangenpoort prison in The Hague. Despite being questioned harshly several times he always refused to give any details on William's passage. He was set free after two months on the initiative of the French general Pichegru. He then resigned his commission and returned to Zuidlaren. In 1795, Van Heiden, or Geiden, as he became known in Russia, offered his services to the Russian Emperor. He was appointed Captain- Lieutenant at sea at only twenty-two, and quickly rose through the ranks. He operated in the Black Sea until 1803; during that period, he was promoted to Captain at sea 2nd class. After marrying van Heiden settled in Estonia, then one of the Russian Baltic provinces. In 1808, Van Heiden was promoted to Captain 1st class and was awarded command of the Russian flotilla in Viborg in the 1808-09 war against Sweden following Russia's alliance with Napoleon after the treaty at Tilsit in 1807. He defeated a Swedish galley fleet in the Battle of Sand√∂str√∂m together with Lieutenant-Commander Pyotr Dodt. The Swedish flotilla retreated to √Öland whereas the Swedish and British high sea fleets continued to control the Baltic Sea. Afterwards, van Heiden was made Squadron commander in the Grand Duchy of Finland. After the siege of Danzig (1813), Van Heiden was promoted to Commodore. He was decorated several times during this period, apparently partly in order to keep him in the Russian ranks. Commander in the Mediterranean Heyden monument in Pylos in commemoration of the Battle of Navarino In 1826, Van Heiden was given command of the Russian fleet in the Mediterranean (with Mikhail Lazarev as deputy). On 27 October 1827 he was the commander of the Russian squadron in the Battle of Navarino against the Turks during the Greek War of Independence - one of the most important sea battles of that war. It ended with the defeat of the Turko- Egyptian fleet and the destruction of the feared artillery at the fortress of Navarino. Van Heiden narrowly escaped death when the quarter-deck where he was standing was shattered by a cannonball. The victory meant promotion to Vice- Admiral and several more decorations. His international prestige grew: the Greeks considered him their redeemer from the Turks. In Athens one of the roads to Victoria Square is named after van Heiden. There is also a statue, and in 1927 his portrait was on a Greek stamp. Governor of Kronstadt Greek stamp issued in 1927 on the 100th anniversary of the Battle of Navarino. Van Heiden's malleable name is here given as \\"Van der Heyden\\". At the height of his fame, respected everywhere and by everyone, decorated with numerous European medals, he was summoned by the Tsar to become military governor of Kronstadt (on Kotlin Island in the Gulf of Finland between Estonia and Saint Petersburg) and Reval (Tallinn, now capital of Estonia, then capital of the Governorate of Estonia). The population loved him and, as the Greeks did, called him baba (Father). Return to the Netherlands In 1832, Van Heiden returned to the Netherlands for the last time. He was welcomed by the monarch, King William I, who lent him an armoured steamship to visit several important cities, as well as his home town, Zuidlaren. Guards of honour accompanied him to the town hall and a large banquet was held at Laarwoud. He stayed at the estate for some time, but couldn't reacclimatise and shrank into himself. He only appeared in public to sail the Zuidlaardermeer lake. He left for the New World, but was disappointed and eventually returned to Estonia. Back in Tallinn he fell ill from edema and died there in 1850 at the age of 77. Contrary to his wish to be buried in Zuidlaren, Van Heiden was buried to the now destroyed Kopli cemetery in Tallinn.

He entered the movie business in 1984 as a production assistant in Mexico City. In the years throughout 1988 to 1995, starting with El gato, he shot four feature films on home-video and developed his skills as a storyteller as well as his cinematic visual aesthetics, namely with Utop√≠a 7. In 1997, he began his professional career in 35-millimeter film format with Angeluz, a horror film, released at the 1998 Guadalajara International Film Festival. Despite the criticisms, upon return to Mexico City, he wrote and shot Sin destino and Un secreto de Esperanza, throughout 1999 to 2002. The starring actors are, respectively, Roberto Cobo and Katy Jurado, these two films being the last acting performances they gave. Sin destino is known as ‚Äúa key piece in raw realism‚Äù, and Un secreto de Esperanza won twelve awards in film festivals around the world. Laborde also alternated among other works in digital video format, such as Cuerpo prestado, La repetici√≥n and Los tr√©boles no pueden so√±ar, throughout 2000 to 2004. During 2005, he wrote, edited and directed Enemigo, this time with debutant performers, and in 2007, Un hombre y su morada interior.

Description  The Blue- throated mountaingem is a fairly large hummingbird, reaching in length and 6 to 10 grams in weight. The Blue-throated Hummingbird is dull green on the top of its body, fading to medium gray on its belly. It has a conspicuous white stripe behind its eye and a narrower stripe extending backward from the corner of its bill, bordering a blackish cheek patch. Its tail feathers are iridescent blue-black with broad white tips on the outer two to three pairs. The species gets its name from the adult male's iridescent blue throat patch (gorget), but the female lacks this, having a plain gray throat.  Behavior  The blue-throated mountaingem is native to mountain woodlands of Mexico, although during the summer it is an uncommon to rare resident of moist, wooded canyons in the Madrean sky islands of southeastern Arizona, southern New Mexico, and western Texas in the United States and northeastern Sonora, Mexico. A few individuals traditionally winter at feeding stations in southeastern Arizona. = Song = Males sing two types of songs: a simple \\"peep song,\\" which sounds like a squeaky wheel lasting about 1 second, and a quiet but complex \\"whisper song\\" lasting as long as 8 seconds. The female is also reported to sing during the breeding season to attract the attention of males. A male song differs in several respects from other oscine birds in that it uses sharp atonal forceful trills and clicks, and has an unusually large vocal range of 1.8 to 30 kHz. The bird also uses ultrasonic vibrations which are not for communication, but possibly serve to flush out and disorient its insect prey. = Nesting = The male takes no part in nest building or care of the young. The female constructs her nest from soft plant fibers, held together and attached to its support (a tree branch, flowering plant, fern, vine, rock shelf, or man-made object such as a wire or nail) using strands of spider silk stolen from spider webs. The exterior is camouflaged with green mosses where available; in drier habitats, moss-like dendroid lichens may be used, or the exterior may be left bare. Blue-throated Hummingbirds frequently nest over water, especially flowing streams. The two white eggs hatch in 17 to 19 days, and the young leave the nest at 24 to 26 days of age. Up to three broods per year are possible under ideal conditions; the female usually builds each new nest atop the previous nest, leading to nest \\"towers\\" at traditional nest sites. = Diet = Like other hummingbirds, the blue-throated mountaingem feeds on nectar from flowers and catches insects in flight and by gleaning from vegetation. In winter, sap from wells drilled by sapsuckers may substitute for nectar. See also * Williamson, S. L. 2000. Blue-throated Hummingbird (Lampornis clemenciae). In The Birds of North America.

It was designed by the Pritzker Prize-winning Brazilian architect Paulo Mendes da Rocha. The stadium is owned by the Goi√°s state Government, and is the home ground of Goi√°s Esporte Clube. Vila Nova and Atl√©tico Goianiense have their own stadiums which they use for most league games, but for derbies and other big games they move to the Serra Dourada. History Serra Dourada was completed in 1975 and was inaugurated on March 9 of that same year. It was one of the venues of the 1989 Copa Am√©rica. The stadium was also the neutral ground used by CONMEBOL in the 1981 Copa Libertadores group stage replay match between Flamengo and Atl√©tico Mineiro, in which Flamengo was declared the winner by CONMEBOL, after five Atl√©tico Mineiro players were sent off by referee Jos√© Roberto Wright. The inaugural match was played on March 9, 1975, when Goi√°s State All-Stars beat the Portugal national team 2-1. The first goal of the stadium was scored by Portugal's Oct√°vio. The inauguration match also marked the stadium's attendance record, at 79,610. The inauguration of Serra Dourada opened the way for Goi√°s Esporte Clube supremacy in the Goi√°s State Championship. From 1975 onwards (the so-called \\"Serra Dourada Era\\") the club won the State Championship seventeen times, while Goi√¢nia, once the biggest team in the state, would never win the championship again.

Little is known for certain of his life outside of his own writings, but he is considered the father of the exact and natural sciences in Armenia‚Äîthe first Armenian mathematician, astronomer, and cosmographer. Seen as a part of the Armenian Hellenizing School, the last lay scholar in Christian Armenia until the 11th century, Anania was educated primarily by Tychicus, in Trebizond. He composed science textbooks and the first known geographic work in classical Armenian (Ashkharhatsuyts), which provides detailed information about Greater Armenia, Persia and the Caucasus (Georgia and Caucasian Albania). In mathematics, his accomplishments include the earliest known table of results of the four basic operations, the earliest known collection of recreational math puzzles and problems, and the earliest book of math problems in Armenian. He also devised a system of mathematical notation based on the Armenian alphabet, although he was the only writer known to have used it. Life =Background= Anania Shirakatsi lived in the 7th century. The dates of his birth and death have not been definitively established. Robert H. Hewsen noted in 1968 that Anania is widely believed to have been born between 595 and 600; a quarter-century later he settled on c. 610 as a birthdate and 685 as the year he died. Agop Jack Hacikyan places his birth in early 600s but agrees on 685. Edward G. Mathews and Theo van Lint also concur with 610‚Äì685, while Greenwood suggests c. 600‚Äì670. Vardanyan places his death in the early 690s. Anania is the only classical Armenian scholar to have written an autobiography. It is a brief text, characterized as \\"somewhat self- congratulatory\\" and \\"more a statement of academic pedigree\\" than autobiography. It was probably written as the preface to one of his scholarly works, possibly the K'nnikon. He was the son of John (Yovhannes) and was born in the village of Anania/Aneank' (‘±’∂’•’°’∂÷Ñ) or in the town of Shirakavan (Yerazgavors) (’á’´÷Ä’°’Ø’°’æ’°’∂), in the canton of Shirak (≈†irak), in the central Armenian province of Ayrarat. Aneank' may be connected to the later city of Ani, the Bagratid Armenian capital. Anania probably came from a noble family. Since his name is sometimes spelled as \\"Shirakuni\\" (’á’´÷Ä’°’Ø’∏÷Ç’∂’´), Hewsen argued that he may have belonged to the house of the Kamsarakan or Arsharuni princes of Shirak and Ar≈°arunik‚Äô, respectively. Greenwood suggests that it is more likely that Anania came from the lesser nobility in Shirak, who served the house of Kamsarakan. Broutian describes his father as a \\"minor Armenian nobleman.\\" Vardanyan believes he either came from the Kamsarakan family or that they were his patrons. Anania is traditionally thought to have been buried in the village of Anavank', however, the tradition probably originated from the name of the village. =Education = Anania received his early education at the local Armenian schools, possibly at Dprevank monastery, where he studied sacred texts and earlier Armenian authors. Due to the lack of teachers and books in Armenia, he decided to travel to the Byzantine Empire (the \\"land of the Greeks\\") to study mathematics. After first traveling to Theodosiopolis, then to the Byzantine-controlled province of Fourth Armenia, where he studied under Christosatur for six months. He then left to find a better teacher and learned about Tychicus, who was based at the monastery (or martyrium) of Saint Eugenios in Trebizond. Greenwood has speculated that Tychicus, not mentioned elsewhere, may actually be Stephanus of Alexandria. A 19th century artist's impression of Anania Shirakatsi Anania devoted a significant part of his autobiography to Tychicus (born c. 560), with whom he spent eight years in the 620s or 630s. Tychicus had studied the Armenian language and its literature while serving in the Byzantine army in Armenia. Wounded by the Persians, he retired from the military and later studied in Alexandria, Rome, and Constantinople. Tychicus later returned to his native Trebizond, where he established a school c. 615. Tychicus taught many students from Constantinople (including from the imperial court) and was renowned among Byzantine kings. He provided Anania special attention and taught him What Anania called a \\"perfect knowledge of mathematics\\". In Tychicus's large library, Anania found sacred and secular Greek authors, including works on the sciences, medicine, chronology, and history. Anania considered Tychicus to have been \\"predestined by God for the introduction of science into Armenia.\\" =Educator and scientist= Anania himself established a school in Armenia upon his return. That school, the first in Armenia to teach quadrivium, is presumed to have been located in his native Shirak. He was disappointed with the laziness of his students and their departure after learning the basics. Anania complained about Armenians' lack of interest in mathematics, writing that they \\"love neither learning, nor knowledge.\\" The 12th-century chronicler Samuel of Ani listed five of Shirakatsi's students, who are otherwise unknown. Anania financed his research in several fields with the money he earned teaching. Relationship with the Armenian Church Anania had a close relationship with the church. Several scholars consider him a church ideologist akin to Cosmas Indicopleustes, whom he actually criticized. Hacikyan describes Anania as a \\"devout Christian and well versed in the Bible\\" who \\"made some attempts to reconcile science and Scripture.\\" In his later years, Anania may have been a monk in the Armenian Church. This is based on his religious discourses and attempts to date the feasts of the church. On the other hand, John A. C. Greppin doubts that Anania was ever in any religious order. Hewsen noted that some of Anania's \\"more revolutionary ideas\\" were suppressed by the Armenian Church after his death. Greppin noted that Anania, a largely secular author, had fallen into a \\"bad clerical odor.\\" Soviet historians represented him as a founder of irreligious and anti-clerical thought in Armenia, who pioneered double-truth theory. Gevorg Khrlopian went as far as to argue that Anania was an enemy of the Armenian Church and fought against its obscurantism. Hewsen opposed this view, suggesting that, instead, he was an \\"independent thinker of sorts.\\" Philosophy Anania is considered by modern scholars to be a representative of the Hellenizing School since many of his works were based on classical Greek sources. He was the first Armenian scholar to have \\"imported a set of scientific notions, and examples of their applications, from the Greek-speaking schools\\" into Armenia. He was well versed in Greek literature, and the influence of Greek syntax is evident in his works. Anania was also knowledgeable about native Armenian and Iranian cultural traditions; several of his works provide important information on late Sassanian Iran. Anania accepted the importance of experience, observation, rational practice and theory, and was influenced by the ideas of the 5th-century Neoplatonist philosopher Davit Anhaght (the Invincible), and Greek philosophers Thales of Miletus, Hippocrates, Democritus, Plato, Aristotle, Zeno of Citium, Epicurus, Ptolemy, Pappus of Alexandria, and Cosmas Indicopleustes. In particular, Aristotle's On the Heavens had a significant influence on Anania's thought. According to Gevorg Khrlopian Anania was heavily influenced by Yeghishe's An Interpretation of Creation, the anonymous Interpretation of the Categories of Aristotle, and the works of Davit Anhaght, who had established Neoplatonism in Armenian thought. Anania was also the first Armenian scholar to quote Philo of Alexandria. Anania was the last lay scholar in Christian Armenia until Grigor Magistros Pahlavuni in the 11th century. He advocated rationalism in studying nature and attacked superstitious beliefs and astrology as the \\"babblings of the foolish.\\" He adopted the classical theory of four elements, which considered all matter to be composed of four elements: fire, air, water, and earth. He believed that while God directly created these elements, He did not interfere with the \\"natural course of the development of things.\\" He asserted that the creation, existence, and decay of natural bodies and phenomena occurred through the union of these elements‚Äîwithout the interference of God. Both living and non- living matter came into existence from a synthesis of the four elements. Anania accepted that the Earth is round, describing it as \\"like an egg with a spherical yolk (the globe) surrounded by a layer of white (the atmosphere) and covered with a hard shell (the sky).\\" He accurately explained solar and lunar eclipses, the phases of the moon, and the structure of the Milky Way, describing the latter as a \\"mass of dense but faintly luminous stars.\\" Anania also correctly attributed tides to the influence of the moon. He described the topmost sphere as the aether (arp'i), the source of light and heat (through the sun). Works Anania was a polymath and natural philosopher. About 40 works in various disciplines have been attributed to Anania, but only half are extant. They include studies and translations in mathematics, astronomy, cosmology, geography, chronology, and meteorology. Many of his works are believed to have been part of K'nnikon (’î’∂’∂’´’Ø’∏’∂, from \\"canon\\", Greek: Kanonikon), completed circa 666, and used as the standard science textbook in medieval Armenia. According to Greenwood, the K'nnikon was a \\"fluid compilation, whose contents fluctuated over time, reflecting the interests and resources of different teachers and practitioners.\\" Modern scholars have praised Anania's writing as concise, simple, and to the point, retaining the reader's attention and citing examples to illustrate his point. =Mathematical= An arithmetic book by Shirakatsi Anania was primarily devoted to mathematics, which he considered the \\"mother of all knowledge.\\" His mathematical books were used as textbooks in Armenia. Of Anania's several mathematical works, the most important is the book of arithmetic (’Ä’°’¥’°÷Ä’∏’≤’∏÷Ç’©’´÷Ç’∂, Hamaroghut‚Äôiun or ‘π÷Ç’°’¢’°’∂’∏÷Ç’©’´÷Ç’∂, T'vabanut'iun), a comprehensive collection of tables on the four basic operations. It is the earliest extant known work of its kind. The operations reach up to a total of 80 million, which is the highest number. A possible theoretical part is believed lost. Problems and Solutions (alternatively translated as On Questions and Answers), a collection of 24 arithmetical problems and their solutions, is based on the application of fractions; it is the earliest such work in Armenian. Many of its problems allude to real-world situations: six connect to the princely house of Shirak, the Kamsarakans, and at least three to Iran. Greenwood calls the problems \\"a rich source for seventh-century history whose value has not been sufficiently recognized.\\" The third work, probably an appendix of the book of arithmetic, is titled ‘Ω÷Ä’°’≠’≥’°’∂’°’Ø’°’∂÷Ñ, Xraxc'anakank', literally \\"things for festive occasions\\". It has been translated into English as Mathematical Pastimes, Fun with Arithmetic or Problems for Amusement. It also contains 24 problems \\"intended for mathematical entertainment in social gatherings.\\" According to Mathews this may be the oldest extant text of its kind. Numerical notation For his mathematical works, Anania developed a unique numerical notation based on 12 letters of the Armenian alphabet. For the units, he used the first nine letters of the Armenian script (‘±, ‘≤, ‘≥, ‘¥, ‘µ, ‘∂, ‘∑, ‘∏, ‘π), similar to the standard traditional Armenian numerical system. The letters used for 10, 100, and 1000 were also identical to the traditional Armenian system (‘∫, ’É, ’å), but all other numbers up to 10,000 were written using these 12 letters. For instance, 50 would be written ‘µ‘∫ (5√ó10) and not ‘æ as in the standard system. Thus, the notation is multiplicative-additive as opposed to the ciphered- additive standard system and requires knowing 12 letters, instead of 36, to write numbers less than 10,000. Numbers greater than that could be written using multiplicative combinations of just 2 or 3 signs, but using all 36 letters. Stephen Chrisomalis believes this system was created by Anania since it only occurs in his works and is not found in Greek, Syriac, Hebrew, or any other alphabetic numeral system. Allen Shaw has argued it was just a variant of the Armenian numerals designed specifically for the representation of large numbers. No other writer used it. =Astronomical= thumb One of Anania's most significant works is Cosmology (’è’´’•’¶’•÷Ä’°’£’´’ø’∏÷Ç’©’´÷Ç’∂, Tiezeragitut‚Äôiun). Abrahamian's version is composed of ten chapters, with an introduction titled \\"In the Fulfillment of a Promise\\", implying a patron. It covers the sun, the moon, celestial spheres, constellations, the Milky Way, and meteorological changes. Works used for the parts of the Cosmology include the Bible (mostly the Pentateuch and Psalms) and works by the Church Fathers. Anania cites the work of Basil of Caesarea, Gregory the Illuminator, and Amphiolocus (perhaps, of Iconium). Some chapters of the work, such as \\"On Clouds\\" (also called \\"On the Sky\\" or \\"Concerning the Skies\\"), are largely based on Basil's Hexameron. Anania also repeats the classical Greek notions in the fields of astronomy, physics or meteorology. Pambakian wrote about the significance of the Cosmology: Another of Anania's astronomical works, Tables of the Motions of the Moon (‘Ω’∏÷Ä’°’∂÷Ñ ’®’∂’©’°÷Å’´÷Ñ ’¨’∏÷Ç’Ω’∏’µ, xorank‚Äò ƒïnt'ac'ik' lusoy), is based on the works of Meton of Athens and his own observations. Perpetual calendar In 667 Anania was invited by Catholicos Anastas I of Akori (r. 661/2‚Äì667) to the Armenian Church's central seat at Dvin to establish a fixed calendar of the movable and immovable feasts of the Armenian Church. The result was a perpetual calendar based on a 532-year cycle (’á‘º‘≤ ’¢’∏’¨’∏÷Ä’°’Ø), combining the solar cycle and the lunar cycle since they coincide every 532 years. It was first proposed by Victorius of Aquitaine in 457 and adopted by the Church of Alexandria. Anania's calendar was never implemented by the Armenian Church; Hovhannes Draskhanakerttsi believes that Anastas's death prevented a church council from ratifying it. =Geographical= Suren Eremian Ashkharhatsuyts (classical Armenian: ‘±’∑’≠’°÷Ä’∞’°÷Å’∏’µ÷Å, A≈°xarhac'oyts, lit. \\"showing the world\\") is an anonymously published world map, believed to have been written sometime between 610 and 636. Its authorship has been disputed in the modern period; formerly believed to have been the work of Movses Khorenatsi, most scholars now attribute it to Anania. Hewsen calls it \\"one of the most valuable works to come down to us from Armenian antiquity.\\" The Armenian Geography‚Äîas it is alternatively known‚Äîhas been especially important for research into the history and geography of Greater Armenia, the Caucasus (Georgia and Caucasian Albania) and the Sasanian Empire, which are all described in detail. The territories are described before the Arab invasions and conquests. The information on Armenia is not found elsewhere in historical sources, as it is the only known Armenian geographical work prior to the 13th century. Ashkharhatsuyts has survived in long and short recensions. According to the scholarly consensus, the long recension was the original. For the description of Europe, North Africa and Asia (all the known world from Spain to China), it largely uses Greek sources, namely the now lost geography of Pappus of Alexandria (4th century), which in turn, is based on the Geography of Ptolemy (2nd century). According to Hewsen, it is the \\"last work based on ancient geographical knowledge written before the Renaissance.\\" It was one of the earliest secular Armenian works to be published (in 1668 by Voskan Yerevantsi). It has been translated into four languages: English, Latin (both 1736), French (1819), and Russian (1877). In 1877, Kerovbe Patkanian first attributed it to Anania as the most probable author. Another geographical work of Anania, The Itinerary (’Ñ’≤’∏’∂’°’π’°÷É÷Ñ, Mghonachap'k‚Äô or M≈Çonaƒça'k‚Äô), may have been a part of Ashkharhatsuyts. It presents six routes from Dvin, Armenia's capital at that time, to the major settlements in different directions, with distances in miles (’¥’≤’∏’∂, mghon), referring to the Arabic mile of , according to Hakob Manandian. =Chronology= Anania's major chronological work, the Chronicle, listed important events in order of their occurrence. Written between 686 and 690, it is composed of two parts: a universal chronicle, utilizing the lost works of Annianus of Alexandria and the lost Roman imperial sequence from Eusebius's Chronographia, and an ecclesiastical history from a miaphysite perspective, which records the six ecumenical councils. Another chronological work, known as the Tomar (Calendar), included texts and tables about the calendars of 15 peoples: Armenians, Hebrews, Arabs, Macedonians, Romans, Syrians, Greeks, Egyptians, Ethiopians, Athenians, Bythanians, Cappadocians, Georgians, Caucasian Albanians, and Persians. The calendars of the Armenians, Romans, Hebrews, Syrians, Greeks, and Egyptians contain texts, while those of other peoples only have the names of months and their length. =Other= Anania wrote several books on weights and measures. He extensively used the work of Epiphanius of Salamis to present the system of weights used by the Greeks, Jews, and Syrians, and his own knowledge as well as other sources for those of the Armenians and Persians. Anania wrote several works on precious stones, music, and the known languages of the world. Anania's discourses on Christmas/Epiphany and Easter, which are discussions on the dates of the two feasts. In the first, he uses a lost work he ascribes to Polycarp of Smyrna and insists that the Armenian custom of celebrating Christmas and the Epiphany on the same date is truer to the holidays' intent than celebrating them separately as is common elsewhere in the Christian world. Legacy 2009 statue of Anania in Gyumri =Influence in the Middle Ages= Anania laid the foundations of the exact sciences in Armenia and greatly influenced many Armenian scholars who came after him. Hovhannes Imastaser (Hovhannes Sarkavag) and other medieval scholars extensively cited and incorporated Anania's works. In a 1037 letter, Grigor Magistros, a scholar from the Pahlavuni noble family, asked Catholicos Petros Getadardz for Anania's manuscripts of his K‚Äônnikon, which were locked up at the catholicosate for centuries. Grigor used these as a textbook at his school at the Sanahin Monastery. =Reemergence in the modern period= Shirakatsi's statue at the Yerevan State University In the print age, passing references to Anania were made as early as 1742 (by Paghtasar Dpir), but it was not until the latter half of the 19th century that Anania and his work became a subject of study. In 1877 Armenian linguist and philologist Kerovbe Patkanian published a collection of Anania's works in the original classical Armenian at Saint Petersburg University. Titled Sundry Studies (’Ñ’∂’°÷Å’∏÷Ä’§÷Ñ ’¢’°’∂’´÷Å, Mnatsordk‚Äô banits), it is the first-ever print publication of his works. Galust Ter- Mkrtchian published a number of Anania's works in 1896. Joseph Orbeli, an Armenian member of the Russian Academy of Sciences, published a Russian translation of Anania's Problems and Solutions in 1918. Systematic study and publication of his works began in the Soviet period. Ashot G. Abrahamian, who began his research at the Matenadaran in the 1930s, first published one of Anania's arithmetical texts in 1939, followed by a complete compilation of Anania's work in 1944. Abrahamian's work was not received with universal acclaim. One critic objected to his 1944 compilation for attributing disputed works to Anania. Abrahamian and Garegin Petrosian published an updated edition in 1979. Some criticism persisted: Varag Arakelian noted a number of errors in translations from classical Armenian and concluded that a new translation of Anania's works was needed. Another Soviet scholar, Suren T. Eremian, studied the Geography. He insisted on Anania's authorship and published his research in 1963. The first translation of Anania's work into a Western language was done by the British Orientalist Frederick Cornwallis Conybeare, who translated into English Anania's On Christmas, in 1896, and On Easter and Anania's autobiography, in 1897. Lemerle noted that Conybeare translated Anania's autobiography from a Russian translation, and it contains numerous serious errors. Renewed interest in Anania's work emerged in the West in the 1960s. A French translation of his autobiography appeared in 1964 by Ha√Øg Berb√©rian. Robert H. Hewsen authored an introductory article on Anania's life and scholarship in 1968. Greenwood argues that studying Anania and his works \\"resonated with twentieth-century political beliefs and offered a suitable subject for academic research in ways that works on medieval theology or Biblical exegesis did not. Anania came to be projected as a national hero from the distant Armenian past, linking and affirming past and present identities.\\" 2005 Armenian postage stamp depicting Shirakatsi =Modern assessment = Anania is considered by modern scholars as the \\"father of the exact sciences in Armenia.\\" Modern historians consider him as the greatest scientist of medieval Armenia and, possibly, all Armenian history, up to the 20th century astrophysicist Viktor Ambartsumian. He is widely regarded as the founder of the natural sciences in the country. He was the first classical Armenian scholar to study mathematics and several scientific subjects, such as cosmography and chronology. Hacikyan et al. wrote in The Heritage of Armenian Literature: Shirakatsi was one of six scholars whose statue was erected in front of the Matenadaran, the museum-institute of Armenian manuscripts in Yerevan, in the 1960s. Another statue was erected in the front yard of the Yerevan State University. A crater on the Moon was named after Shirakatsi in 1979. In independent post-Soviet Armenia, Anania Shirakatsi has been commemorated in various ways. In 1993 the Medal of Anania Shirakatsi, a state award, was established, given for \\"significant activities, inventions, and discoveries in the spheres of economy, engineering, architecture, science, and technology.\\" In 2005 the Central Bank of Armenia issued a commemorative coin, while HayPost issued a stamp dedicated to Anania Shirakatsi.

R represents the alkyl portion of a fatty acid. General structures of sphingolipids Ceramides are a family of waxy lipid molecules. A ceramide is composed of sphingosine and a fatty acid. Ceramides are found in high concentrations within the cell membrane of eukaryotic cells, since they are component lipids that make up sphingomyelin, one of the major lipids in the lipid bilayer. Contrary to previous assumptions that ceramides and other sphingolipids found in cell membrane were purely supporting structural elements, ceramide can participate in a variety of cellular signaling: examples include regulating differentiation, proliferation, and programmed cell death (PCD) of cells. The word ceramide comes from the Latin cera (wax) and amide. Ceramide is a component of vernix caseosa, the waxy or cheese-like white substance found coating the skin of newborn human infants.  Pathways for ceramide synthesis  There are three major pathways of ceramide generation. First, the sphingomyelinase pathway uses an enzyme to break down sphingomyelin in the cell membrane and release ceramide. Second, the de novo pathway creates ceramide from less complex molecules. Third, in the \\"salvage\\" pathway, sphingolipids that are broken down into sphingosine are reused by reacylation to form ceramide. = Sphingomyelin hydrolysis = Hydrolysis of sphingomyelin is catalyzed by the enzyme sphingomyelinase. Because sphingomyelin is one of the four common phospholipids found in the plasma membrane of cells, the implications of this method of generating ceramide is that the cellular membrane is the target of extracellular signals leading to programmed cell death. There has been research suggesting that when ionizing radiation causes apoptosis in some cells, the radiation leads to the activation of sphingomyelinase in the cell membrane and ultimately, to ceramide generation. =De novo= De novo synthesis of ceramide begins with the condensation of palmitate and serine to form 3-keto-dihydrosphingosine. This reaction is catalyzed by the enzyme serine palmitoyl transferase and is the rate-limiting step of the pathway. In turn, 3-keto-dihydrosphingosine is reduced to dihydrosphingosine, which is then followed by acylation by the enzyme (dihydro)ceramide synthase to produce dihydroceramide. The final reaction to produce ceramide is catalyzed by dihydroceramide desaturase. De novo synthesis of ceramide occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum. Ceramide is subsequently transported to the Golgi apparatus by either vesicular trafficking or the ceramide transfer protein CERT. Once in the Golgi apparatus, ceramide can be further metabolized to other sphingolipids, such as sphingomyelin and the complex glycosphingolipids. =Salvage pathway= Constitutive degradation of sphingolipids and glycosphingolipids takes place in the acidic subcellular compartments, the late endosomes and the lysosomes, with the end goal of producing sphingosine. In the case of glycosphingolipids, exohydrolases acting at acidic pH optima cause the stepwise release of monosaccharide units from the end of the oligosaccharide chains, leaving just the sphingosine portion of the molecule, which may then contribute to the generation of ceramides. Ceramide can be further hydrolyzed by acid ceramidase to form sphingosine and a free fatty acid, both of which are able to leave the lysosome, unlike ceramide. The long-chain sphingoid bases released from the lysosome may then re-enter pathways for synthesis of ceramide and/or sphingosine-1-phosphate. The salvage pathway re-utilizes long-chain sphingoid bases to form ceramide through the action of ceramide synthase. Thus, ceramide synthase family members probably trap free sphingosine released from the lysosome at the surface of the endoplasmic reticulum or in endoplasmic reticulum-associated membranes. The salvage pathway has been estimated to contribute from 50% to 90% of sphingolipid biosynthesis. Physiological roles As a bioactive lipid, ceramide has been implicated in a variety of physiological functions including apoptosis, cell growth arrest, differentiation, cell senescence, cell migration and adhesion. Roles for ceramide and its downstream metabolites have also been suggested in a number of pathological states including cancer, neurodegeneration, diabetes, microbial pathogenesis, obesity, and inflammation. Ceramides induce skeletal muscle insulin resistance when synthesized as a result of saturated fat activation of TLR4 receptors. Unsaturated fat does not have this effect. Ceramides induce insulin resistance in many tissues by inhibition of Akt/PKB signaling. Aggregation of LDL cholesterol by ceramide causes LDL retention in arterial walls, leading to atherosclerosis. Ceramides cause endothelial dysfunction by activating protein phosphatase 2 (PP2A). In mitochondria, ceramide suppresses the electron transport chain and induces production of reactive oxygen species. =Apoptosis= One of the most studied roles of ceramide pertains to its function as a proapoptotic molecule. Apoptosis, or Type I programmed cell death, is essential for the maintenance of normal cellular homeostasis and is an important physiological response to many forms of cellular stress. Ceramide accumulation has been found following treatment of cells with a number of apoptotic agents including ionizing radiation, UV light, TNF-alpha, and chemotherapeutic agents. This suggests a role for ceramide in the biological responses of all these agents. Because of its apoptosis-inducing effects in cancer cells, ceramide has been termed the \\"tumor suppressor lipid\\". Several studies have attempted to define further the specific role of ceramide in the events of cell death and some evidence suggests ceramide functions upstream of the mitochondria in inducing apoptosis. However, owing to the conflicting and variable nature of studies into the role of ceramide in apoptosis, the mechanism by which this lipid regulates apoptosis remains elusive. =Skin= Ceramide is the main component of the stratum corneum of the epidermis layer of human skin. Together with cholesterol and saturated fatty acids, ceramide creates a water-impermeable, protective organ to prevent excessive water loss due to evaporation as well as a barrier against the entry of microorganisms. In the hyperplastic disorder psoriasis the water permeability barrier is compromised. Ceramide VI is the most abundant ceramide of the skin, along with ceramide II, and has been exploited to model the organization of the stratum corneum lipidic network. The stratum corneum is composed of 50% ceramides, 25% cholesterol, and 15% free fatty acids. Key components of the extracellular lipid lamellae of the stratum corneum are ultra long chain (C28-C36) ceramides. With aging there is a decline in ceramide and cholesterol in the stratum corneum of humans. A clinical trial using ceramide-rich wheat extract showed increased skin hydration in those taking the extract rather than the placebo. =Hormonal= Inhibition of ceramide synthesis with myriocin in obese mice may lead to both improved leptin signaling and decreased insulin resistance by decreasing SOCS-3 expression. An elevated level of ceramide can cause insulin resistance by inhibiting the ability of insulin to activate the insulin signal transduction pathway and/or via the activation of JNK. Substances known to induce ceramide generation *Anandamide *Ceramidase inhibitors *Chemotherapeutic agents *Fas ligand *Endotoxin *Homocysteine * Heat *Gamma interferon *Ionizing radiation *Matrix metalloproteinases *Niacinamide *Reactive oxygen species *Tetrahydrocannabinol and other cannabinoids *TNF- alpha *1,25 Dihydroxy vitamin D Mechanism by which ceramide signaling occurs Currently, the means by which ceramide acts as a signaling molecule are not clear. One hypothesis is that ceramide generated in the plasma membrane enhances membrane rigidity and stabilizes smaller lipid platforms known as lipid rafts, allowing them to serve as platforms for signalling molecules. Moreover, as rafts on one leaflet of the membrane can induce localized changes in the other leaflet of the bilayer, they can potentially serve as the link between signals from outside the cell to signals to be generated within the cell. Ceramide has also been shown to form organized large channels traversing the mitochondrial outer membrane. This leads to the egress of proteins from the intermembrane space. Uses Ceramides may be found as ingredients of some topical skin medications used to complement treatment for skin conditions such as eczema. They are also used in cosmetic products such as some soaps, shampoos, skin creams, and sunscreens. Additionally, ceramides are being explored as a potential therapeutic in cancer. Ceramide in bacteria Ceramide is rarely found in bacteria. Bacteria of family Sphingomonadaceae, however, contain it.

It operated between November 8-12, 1954 at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) with a maximum sustained power of 2.5 megawatts (MW), and generated a total of 96 MW-hours of energy. The ARE was the first reactor to use circulating molten salt fuel. The hundreds of engineers and scientists working on ARE provided technical data, facilities, equipment, and experience that enabled the broader development of molten salt reactors as well as liquid metal cooled reactors.  Background  The concept of nuclear-powered aircraft was first formally studied in May 1946 by the US Army Air Forces. It was supposed that the unique characteristics of nuclear power could be applied to long-range supersonic flight, which was considered highly valuable in terms of military strategy. Challenges in the proposal were understood immediately, and by 1950 the Atomic Energy Commission joined with the Air Force to study the possibilities via technology development in the Aircraft Nuclear Propulsion (ANP) program. The ORNL staff of the ANP project decided that technical information and experience needed to support the objective of nuclear-powered flight could most economically be obtained from building and operating the ARE. They considered the task of flying a supersonic airplane on nuclear energy exceedingly complex, and thought more than one experimental reactor may be necessary before sufficient information was obtained to design and construct a reactor for flight. Originally, the ARE was conceived as a liquid sodium metal-cooled Beryllium oxide (BeO)-moderated solid-fuel reactor. The BeO moderator blocks were purchased with the solid-fuel design in mind. However, concerns regarding chain reaction stability related to xenon in solid fuel at very high temperatures were serious enough to warrant abandoning solid fuel and replacing it with circulating fluid fuel. A fluid-fueled option with molten fluoride salt was worked into the original design.  Reactor  Aircraft Reactor Experiment Diagram A cross-section of the Aircraft Reactor Experiment The ARE was designed to be a prototype of a 350-megawatt, BeO-moderated, circulating-fuel aircraft reactor. It used a fuel composed of 53.09 mole % NaF, 40.73 mole % ZrF4, and 6.18 mole % UF4. The reactor was a BeO cylinder with bent tubes directing flowing fuel through the core in both directions. It was surrounded by an Inconel shell. The ARE operational life targeted 1000 hours, with as much time as possible at the full power level of 3 megawatts. The design fuel temperature was , with a temperature rise across the core, though the peak temperature reached in steady operation and peaked at in transients. of fuel flowed through the reactor per minute at a core pressure of about . Sodium was pumped through the reactor at a rate of per minute with about of pressure. The fuel salt transferred heat to a helium loop, which then transferred the heat to water. Additionally, the reflector and moderator blocks were cooled with a liquid sodium metal cooling loop, which also transferred heat to helium and then water. The reactor contained one neutron source (15 curies of polonium-beryllium), one regulating rod, and three helium-cooled boron carbide shim rods. The experiment was instrumented with two fission chambers, two compensated ionization chambers, and 800 thermocouples. The ARE control system could automatically scram the reactor based on high neutron flux, fast reactor period, high reactor exit fuel temperature, low heat exchanger fuel temperature, low fuel flow rate, and loss of offsite power.

Used to shake down filling and draining processes at low temperature View of the equipment layout in the Aircraft Reactor Experiment The molten salt fuel pump used in the Aircraft Reactor Experiment The heat exchanger chamber took up significantly more space than the reactor and dump tank chambers. The ambitious goals and military importance of the ANP catalyzed a significant amount of research and development of complex systems in challenging high-temperature, high-radiation environments. Corrosion and hot sodium handing studies began in 1950. Investigations of the engineering and fabrication problems involved in handling molten fluoride salts began in 1951 and continued through 1954. Natural-convection corrosion test loops were operated to down-select suitable material and fuel combinations. Subsequent studies in forced-circulation test loops established means to minimize corrosion and mass transfer. Development of pumps, heat exchangers, valves, pressure instrumentation, and cold traps spanned from late 1951 to summer 1954. Much of the work was based on extensive experience at lower temperature from Argonne National Laboratory and the Knolls Atomic Power Laboratory. Techniques had to be developed concerning the construction, preheating, instrumentation, and insulation of reliable leak-tight high-temperature circuits made of Inconel. They found that all-welded construction was necessary. In all, equipment development in support of high-temperature leak- tight operation lasted about four years. The ARE Hazard Summary Report was issued on November 24, 1952. A low-temperature critical mockup of the reactor was assembled to verify the calculation models. The BeO moderator blocks were fitted with straight tubes filled with a powder mixture to simulate the fuel. Critical mass, regulating rod worth, safety rod worth, neutron flux distributions, and reactivity coefficients of a wide variety of materials were measured. Construction of the test facility building began on July 6, 1951. Building plan of the Aircraft Reactor Experiment Building  Operation and experiments  The ARE was operated successfully. It became critical with a mass of uranium-235. It was very stable as a result of its strong negative fuel temperature coefficient (measured at -9.8e-5 dk/k/¬∞F). The assembly was first sufficiently assembled on August 1, 1954, at which point a three-shift operation commenced for tests. Hot sodium metal was flowed through the system beginning on September 26 to test the process equipment and instrumentation. Problems with the sodium vent and sodium purification systems required lengthy repairs. After several sodium dumps and recharges, carrier salt was introduced to the system on October 25th. Fuel was first added to the reactor on October 30, 1954. Initial criticality was reached at 3:45 P.M. on November 3, after a painstaking and careful process of adding the enriched fuel. Much of the four days was spent removing plugs and repairing leaks in the enrichment line. Aircraft Reactor Experiment control room at initial criticality A series of fuel samples were taken periodically. Most notably, they showed an increase in chromium content at a rate of 50 ppm/day, indicating rapid corrosion of the fuel pipes.

It appeared that the gas fittings to the main fuel pump were leaking fission-product gases and vapors into the pits, and the pits were leaking into the basement through defective seals in some electrical junction panels. A pipeline was run from the pits south into an uninhabited valley. Portable compressors and a jet were used to bring the pits to sub-atmospheric pressure for the rest of the experiment. The safety radiation detectors shut down the reactor a few times during restart and were withdrawn to be further away from the reactor. Eventually, the reactor started back up and reached high power. On November 12, operation of the reactor was demonstrated to Air Force and ANP personnel who had gathered at ORNL for a quarterly information meeting. Load following was demonstrated by turning the blowers on and off. With all operational objectives attained, the decision to cease operation was made. Colonel Clyde D. Gasser was visiting the lab at this time and was invited to officiate the termination of the experiment. At 8:04 P.M., he scrammed the reactor for the last time. Final shutdown of the Aircraft Reactor Experiment. Colonel Gasser of the Air Force was visiting at the time and had the honor of scramming the reactor Much information was published about the operation of the reactor, including detailed experimental logs, power traces, and a total of 33 lessons learned.  Decommissioning  The heat exchanger pit of the ARE during decommissioning Aircraft Reactor Experiment on truck on way to burial ground Between shutdown and fuel dumping, the operating personnel were required to wear gas masks due to the high level of airborne radioactivity, which was due to a offgas leak, which was never exactly located. On November 13th, the fuel was transferred to the fuel dump tank. Pressurized carrier salt flushed the pipes and diluted the dump tank. Flush salt was heated to above the system temperature and pumped through the fuel channels. Operators observed the thermocouples to ensure flush salt flowed in all channels. After the fuel dump, the operating personnel had to evacuate the building for one hour after gas from the fuel purge operation which had been discharged out the stack descended and entered the ventilators on the building roof. The sodium system was drained without incident. Two flat by lead shields with thickness were suspended in the heat exchanger cell to protect decommissioning personnel from radiation from the fuel systems. Water lines were cut first. Then, sodium lines were cut with hack saws and immediately sealed with several layers of masking tape. The sodium pump was cleaned and the impeller was removed for examination. When the sodium pump and heat exchanger were removed, the radiation field in the room increased to 600 mrem/hr. The equipment had been shielding the area from the fuel system radiation. The fuel system was carefully dismantled starting in February, 1955. The main fuel pump bowl surveyed at 900 mrem/hr at . A portable grinder that could be operated from within a lead box was built to cut the fuel lines near the reactor can. Once it was free, the reactor was moved to storage and later to a burial ground. The fuel in the dump tank was slated to be reprocessed. About 60 samples of equipment and material were taken for detailed analysis and examination. Metallographic, activation, visual, stereophotographic, and leak tests were performed.  Follow-up  Heavy construction to fit the ART in the building where ARE had been After the ARE operated, the ANP project moved on with plans to build a larger experiment, the 60 MW Aircraft Reactor Test (ART). The ART was to be a NaF-ZrF4-UF4-fueled, Be-moderated, Be-reflected core with sodium metal as the reflector coolant and NaK as the secondary coolant. Its shield was made of lead and borated water. Building 7503 at ORNL was significantly re-excavated in an extension project including new deep excavations to accommodate the ART, but the program was cancelled before the new experiment was performed. The building and facilities later went on to house the Molten Salt Reactor Experiment.

While the riot appeared to be based in a trade dispute of the previous summer between Calvin Lamberth, a white man, and Calvin Carter, an African American, it was provoked when Lamberth shot a friend of Carter's over rumored comments about the former's black mistress. After Lamberth shot Carter's friend, Whitlock Fields, numerous other armed whites came from nearby houses and attacked Carter and seven other black men at a nearby black-owned grocery store. Although the constable arranged a ceasefire, after the freedmen gathered at the door of the store, some eighteen whites rushed and shot at them at close range. They murdered one man, mortally wounded another, and injured four. No white was injured or prosecuted. The incident was investigated by the Freedmen's Bureau office of Nashville, Tennessee. Background of incident In December 1865, white Confederate veterans had founded the Ku Klux Klan, a secret vigilante organization, in Pulaski. Chapters had been started in numerous other towns in Tennessee and other states. Members generally operated in groups and often threatened intended victims at night, trying to suppress black political actions and sometimes economic enterprises. Michael Walsh, Sub. Asst. Comr. of the Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen and Abandoned Lands office in Nashville, known as the Freedmen's Bureau, arrived in Pulaski on January 9, 1868 to investigate and report on the murders and shootings in the town. Michael Walsh, \\"Letter to Bvt. Maj. Genl. W. P. Carlin\\", January 11, 1868. Transcribed from Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen, and Abandoned Lands, 1865 - 1869; National Archives Microfilm Publication M999, roll 34; \\"Reports of Outrages, Riots and Murders, Jan. 15, 1866 - Aug. 12, 1868\\". Retrieved from \\"The Freedmen's Bureau Online\\" website, 24 December 2011 He learned that Calvin Lamberth, a white man who owned a grocery, and Calvin Carter, a freedman, apparently had some kind of feud from a trade dispute starting the previous summer. Carter may have been related to John Carter, another freedman in town who owned a grocery store. Whites resented competing with men who had so recently been enslaved. But the immediate cause of violence was that Lamberth was told that Carter and his friend Whitlock Fields had \\"threatened\\" his Black mistress, warning her to stay away from his store. Lamberth found Fields on the street and shot him twice with a pistol. Fields could not return fire because his gun did not work. Hearing shots, more than 18 white men ran from their homes with pistols and shotguns to suppress any Black violence. The mob attacked freedman John Carter's nearby grocery store. Eight Black people, including Calvin Carter, had gathered there. Though initially caught unaware, a few of them were armed, and together they returned fire and kept the whites at bay. After many volleys of shots, the town constable arranged a ceasefire. As the Black men left the store, eighteen of the white mob rushed the men and fired at them, killing Orange Rhodes and mortally wounding Calvin Carter. Two other African Americans were severely wounded and two more described as slightly wounded. None of the white men was injured. Given the armed preparation by the whites and their concerted group action against the freedmen, Walsh believed they were likely members of the Ku Klux Klan (KKK). In addition to the riot, whites killed Black people in other local incidents, and conducted campaigns of general harassment against freedmen and their sympathizers in the area. The riot was a demonstration of the KKK's growing power in Giles County, and the Middle Tennessee area. KKK members were said to commit more than 1,300 murders during the run up the Election of 1868. Most of the violence were directed towards Black people to intimidate them and break Republican support, though \\"carpetbagger\\" and \\"scalawag\\" whites were also targeted.

WRPI broadcasts 365 days a year with an effective radiated power of 10,000 watts, serving listeners in Albany, eastern New York, western Massachusetts, Vermont, and via webstream. The studios are located in the basement of the Darrin Communications Center and the FM signal is broadcast from North Greenbush. Programming includes a wide range of music, cultural and public affairs programs, live bands, special events, and sports simulcasts, particularly of RPI hockey, football, and baseball. WRPI has a large record library dating to the origins of the station, estimated at 43,800 albums, and a large CD library, dating to the start of the medium. History =Founding= The predecessor to WRPI was an RPI owned AM broadcasting radio station known as WHAZ-AM. WHAZ-AM began broadcasting in 1922, finding itself among the first radio stations to broadcast within the United States.> First issued to Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute on July 18, 1922, the school extended their license for many years thereafter. This ended with the transfer of the license to WPOW Inc. in June 1954.https://licensing.fcc.gov/cgi- bin/prod/cdbs/forms/prod/getimportletter_exh.cgi?import_letter_id=59356 While under the ownership of the school, WHAZ found itself under the stewardship of several groups throughout the years. In 1924, the founding of Campus Review, an entertainment broadcasting group, began the focus of the radio station in broadcasting college centered entertainment and radio for the Troy, New York area. Over two decades later, in the spring of 1947, Carl J. Kunz Jr. founded the \\"Rensselaer Broadcasting Association\\", which took charge of managing broadcasting time slots not used by Campus Review. The Association would completely employ the service of students from RPI to run activities.http://www.wrpi.org/history/ In that same year, the school's radio club began broadcasting their own AM radio station under the call sign W2SZ. The most popular and active station broadcasting on campus at the time, this station was informally referred to by students as WRPI. =Unification= At this point, three different clubs were managing radio broadcasts across the university's campus. Thus the RPI Student Union proceeded to consolidate the clubs into one, the Radio Counsel, by the end of 1948. Only three years later, in 1951, the Radio Counsel was disbanded, and divided into two groups: an amateur radio group, and a broadcast group. The broadcast group still exists under the old banner of W2SZ.https://w2sz.union.rpi.edu/about.php As for the broadcast group, WRPI continued to function on AM channels, where it captured the majority of the campus listener audience at the time. =Moving To FM= Without a broadcast tower, or industry grade equipment, WRPI had a meager broadcast range. In many cases, signals could not reach to certain portions of the college campus. In 1956, the station proposed a move to FM broadcasting, in order to take advantage of its high fidelity capabilities. On December 4, 1957, the FCC approved WRPI to begin broadcasting on 91.5 FM, where it continues to broadcast today.https://transition.fcc.gov/fcc- bin/fmq?call=WRPI&fileno;=&state;=&city;=&freq;=0.0&fre2;=107.9&serv;=&status;=&facid;=&asrn;=&class;=&list;=0&ThisTab;=Results+to+This+Page%2FTab&dist;=&dlat2;=&mlat2;=&slat2;=&NS;=N&dlon2;=&mlon2;=&slon2;=&EW;=W&size;=9 This accompanied the construction of a 30-foot tower, extending the range of the station to nearly all of Troy, Albany, and Schenectady. =Growth And Evolution= As opposed to contemporary FM radio stations at the time, WRPI found itself as the sole popular music broadcaster in the area. In 1967, the station switched to a progressive rock themed station, abandoning its former free form radio status. In addition, WTEN-TV donated a radio tower in North Greenbush, New York, which is still used by the station today.https://enterpriseefiling.fcc.gov/dataentry/public/tv/publicFacilityTechDetails.html?facilityId=55742&applicationId;=3564f25a233c45dab665c1b6063ebeb7 This move increased broadcast strength from 750 watts to 10,000 watts. WRPI thus abandoned use of AM signals and extended range to cover large swaths of New York as well as some areas in Vermont and Massachusetts. =The Station Today= During the mid 1970s, as other FM rock and roll radio stations began to form, WRPI made the decision to revert to their former free form radio format. In addition, the station established their studio in the basement of RPI's Darren Communications Center, where it has remained through the decades. The station continues to be completely student run, allowing virtually anyone to receive training, and potentially broadcast on a time slot. In addition to broadcasting on 91.5 FM, the station may also be listened to over the internet.http://www.wrpi.org/listen/ References *Schedule *History of WRPI External links * WRPI official website * Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute Website Category:Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute RPI RPI Category:Radio stations established in 1947 Category:1947 establishments in New York (state) ","title":"WRPI"},{"id":"2442780","text":"The V√©ges family originates from the Sibiu area of Transylvania, Romania.

In 1970, he graduated from the Rollins College Crummer Graduate School of Business with an MBA. In 1978, Ackerman also graduated from the MIT Sloan School of Management with a master's degree in management. Career Ackerman began his communications career in 1964, and has served in numerous capacities with BellSouth. In November 1992, he was named President and Chief Executive Officer of BellSouth Telecommunications, BellSouth's local telephone service unit and largest subsidiary. He was promoted to vice chairman and Chief Operating Officer in January 1995, and was elevated to the position of President and CEO in January 1997. A year later, the BellSouth board added the chairman's responsibilities to Ackerman's portfolio, and he served as chairman and CEO until BellSouth's merger with AT&T; on December 29, 2006. In 2006, his total annual compensation was a reported $13.97 million, with a 5-year compensational total of $43.30 million. The SBC-AT&T; merger created a uniquely complex situation for Ackerman with regards to Cingular Wireless, a joint venture between BellSouth and SBC. After the SBC/AT&T; merger, the new AT&T; began competing with BellSouth for lucrative business landline customers in BellSouth's primary market, disturbing the historical territorial lines between the former Regional Bell Operating Companies or RBOCs (SBC and BellSouth). Indeed, this issue, as well as the desire for AT&T; to entirely control the highly-profitable Cingular venture, lead AT&T; to purchase BellSouth outright.

He made landmark civil rights rulings that helped end segregation and disenfranchisement of African Americans in the South. In the words of journalist and historian Bill Moyers, Judge Johnson \\"altered forever the face of the South.\\" Early life, education and career Johnson was born in 1918 and grew up in Haleyville in northern Alabama, long an independent- minded part of the state. Winston County had opposed secession from the Union during the American Civil War. Johnson graduated from the University of Alabama and later the University of Alabama School of Law with a Bachelor of Laws in 1943, and passed the bar. He married Ruth Jenkins, a classmate from the University of Alabama. (Another classmate was George C. Wallace, future governor of the state, who became Johnson's b√™te noire during the civil rights era of the 1960s.) Johnson served in the United States Army in Europe during World War II, while his wife Ruth served in the WAVES as an adviser to Hollywood directors making films about the war. After military service, Johnson entered private law practice in Jasper, Alabama from 1946 to 1953. Unlike most white voters of the time in Alabama, he became active in politics with the Republican Party, serving as a delegate to the 1948 Republican National Convention. He managed Alabama's \\"Veterans for Eisenhower\\" group during the 1952 campaign. Johnson was known as a foe of the Democratic Party's segregationist policies. He was appointed as the United States District Attorney for the Northern District of Alabama from 1953 to 1955, during President Dwight D. Eisenhower's administration. Federal trial judicial service Johnson received a recess appointment from President Dwight D. Eisenhower on October 22, 1955, to a seat on the United States District Court for the Middle District of Alabama vacated by Judge Charles Kennamer. He was nominated to the same position on January 12, 1956. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on January 31, 1956, and received his commission on February 1, 1956. He served as Chief Judge from 1966 to 1979. His service terminated on July 12, 1979, due to his elevation to the Fifth Circuit. =Notable district court case and incidents= In 1956, Johnson ruled in favor of Rosa Parks, striking down the \\"blacks in the back of the bus\\" law of the city of Montgomery Alabama, as unconstitutional. In orders issued in 1961 and 1962, he ordered the desegregation of bus depots (such as the Montgomery Greyhound station) and the Montgomery Regional Airport in Alabama's Middle judicial district. In 1961 he ordered the Ku Klux Klan and Montgomery police to stop the beating and harassment of Freedom Riders attempting to integrate interstate bus travel. In March 1965, Judge Johnson ruled that activists had the right to undertake the Selma to Montgomery march as a means to petition the government, overturning Governor George Wallace's prohibition of the march as contrary to public safety. Thousands of sympathizers traveled to Selma to join the march, which had 25,000 participants by its last leg into Montgomery on March 25, 1965. It was considered integral to gaining passage by Congress of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Judge Johnson received death threats and ostracism for his role in advancing civil rights, and was protected by federal marshals for nearly two decades. A burning cross was placed on his lawn in 1956 following the Rosa Parks decision, and his mother's house was bombed in 1967, although she was not hurt. FBI director nomination In 1977 President Carter and Attorney General Griffin Bell asked Johnson to become FBI Director when Director Clarence M. Kelley stepped down. But, the day after Carter nominated him, Johnson was found to have an aneurysm, or abnormal swelling, of his abdominal aorta. His nomination had to be withdrawn and William H. Webster was nominated in his place. Federal appellate judicial service Johnson was nominated by President Jimmy Carter on April 2, 1979, to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, to a new seat established by 92 Stat. 1629. He was confirmed by the Senate on June 19, 1979, and received his commission on June 21, 1979. His service terminated on October 1, 1981, due to reassignment to the Eleventh Circuit. Johnson was reassigned to the newly established United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit by operation of law on October 1, 1981. He assumed senior status on October 30, 1991. He was succeeded on the bench by Judge Edward Earl Carnes. His service terminated on July 23, 1999, upon his death. Johnson additionally served on the Temporary Emergency Court of Appeals from 1972 to 1982. Johnson served more than 40 years on the federal bench. At the memorial service after his death, he was praised by former United States Senator Howell Heflin, Democrat of Alabama, who said that the judge's \\"unrelenting devotion to the rule of law\\" helped him strike down segregation laws. Death Johnson died at his home in Montgomery of pneumonia after being briefly hospitalized for a fall at his home the week prior. =Legacy and honors= *1978, Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement *1979, inducted into the Alabama Academy of Honor\\"Frank M.

Located at the junction of the Lyndon B. Johnson Freeway (Interstate 635, I-635) and the Central Expressway (US Highway 75, US 75), it replaces an antiquated partial cloverleaf interchange constructed in the 1960s. The $261 million project was started in 2002 and completed in December 2005. It was designed by the HNTB Corporation and built by Zachry Construction Corporation. The interchange is considered by Popular Mechanics to be one of \\"The World's 18 Strangest Roadways\\" because of its height (as high as a 12-story building), its 43 permanent bridges and other unusual design and construction features. In 2006, the American Public Works Association named the High Five Interchange as \\"Public Works Projects of the Year\\". Description The High Five Interchange, north of downtown in Dallas, Texas, is a massive five-level freeway interchange. It is the junction of two major highways carrying heavy rush hour traffic, the Lyndon B. Johnson Freeway (Interstate 635) and the Central Expressway (US 75), and is the first five- level stack interchange to be built in the city. It replaces the antiquated three-level, modified cloverleaf interchange built in the 1960s that caused a severe bottleneck by narrowing US 75 down to two lanes at the junction of the two highways. The looped ramps of the cloverleaf forced motorists to slow down drastically, backing up traffic. Left-hand exits contributed to the congestion. Further, its two frontage roads were not directly connected to each other, making local access difficult. Alluding to the celebratory gesture, the \\"High Five\\" name refers to the five flyover ramps handling the left-turn movements that tower over the landscape. The interchange is as high as a 12-story building, and includes 43 bridges spread across five levels (the \\"High Five\\"), 710 support tiers, and 60 miles of additional highway. The highest ramps are above ground. The lanes of US 75, which are on the bottom level, are below ground level, giving the structure a total height of 140 feet from bottom to top. As part of the project, I-635 was widened to include four dedicated high-occupancy vehicle lanes (HOV lanes) that are barrier-separated and reversible. High Five Interchange: US 75 on the bottom level; the two frontage roads on the second; I-635 on the third; direct connection ramps on the two top levels The roads on the five levels are: *Level I: US 75, an eight lane highway, four lanes going each way *Level II: The junction of the two six-lane frontage roads, each having three through lanes in each direction, left-turn lanes and turnarounds, and easy access to US 75 and I-635 *Level III: I-635, ten regular lanes, five going each way, and four HOV lanes (two going each way) separated by barriers *Level IV and V: Direct connection ramps (two levels), eliminating the left exits of the modified cloverleaf The interchange, with its decorative etchings on precast concrete elements, along with the visually appealing coloration specified by the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT), can be regarded as an enormous work of public art. The High Five also incorporates a hiking and bike trail, named the Cottonwood Trail, which runs under all levels of the interchange. The section of the trail passing beneath the interchange was constructed as part of the High Five project by TxDOT.  History  High Five Interchange under construction in 2005 The High Five Interchange project was planned as a replacement for the existing, antiquated interchange that accommodated 500,000 vehicles daily and was located in one of the most intensely developed commercial zones in Dallas. It was a collaborative project between the TxDOT, affected motorists and property owners, and the primary contractor, Zachry Construction. An essential consideration was to complete the project with as little disruption to the traffic flow as possible. Reasons for upgrading the interchange, in addition to the need to increase traffic flow and reduce congestion, were to improve air quality, safety, and local access. Zachry Construction Corporation submitted the lowest bid and was awarded the $261 million contract by TxDOT, the largest ever by that agency. The construction contract for the High Five Interchange was unique in that it contained elements not found in other construction project contracts. For example, it specified the concrete maturity method to be used to ensure the concrete's strength (the first time TxDOT had ever done so), and contained an early completion bonus, a sliding scale of up to $11 million if the company completed the contract within four years. Also built into the construction contract was a provision that Zachry was charged for \\"lane rentals\\" by TxDOT for time they closed down traffic lanes--fees based on hourly assessments and the time of day the lane was closed. The fees ranged from $50 to a high of $110,000 for rush hours. In order not to interfere with traffic flow during construction, the new interchange was designed largely as elevated flyover ramps and viaducts so they could be built high over the existing junction lanes; once traffic was transferred to the new structures the old lanes could simply be closed off and removed. Little of the original interchange remained when the project was finished. To save time and money, innovative construction methods were employed: The original plans called for the segments of the long ramps and spans (used to direct-connect roads) to be made of steel, but because building with steel would interfere with heavy traffic flow during construction, cast- in-place segmental concrete was substituted in the plans. However, Zachry decided to use precast concrete segmental bridges, rather than casting the bridge elements in place, and used a unique machine, designed and constructed by Deal S.R.L. of Italy and costing about $1 million, to move the pieces into place. During the construction, 2.2 million cubic yards of earthwork was used, 350,000 cubic yards of concrete was mixed on site, and 300,000 square feet of retaining walls were built. Additionally, 40,000 feet of drilled shafts and 75,000 linear feet of drainage pipe were completed. In addition to the construction of 43 permanent bridges, six temporary bridges were built, resulting in 2.3 million square feet of bridge deck. The project was designed by the HNTB Corporation who provided professional engineering consultation throughout the construction, which had begun in 2002 and was completed in December 2005, more than 13 months sooner than planned.  Recognition  In 2006, the American Public Works Association named the High Five \\"Public Works Project of the Year\\" for its massive size, its innovative design, the complexity and rapidity of its construction and the need it fulfilled for the community. TxDOT as the managing agency, Zachry Construction Corporation as the primary contractor, and HNTB Corporation as the primary consultant received the award in recognition of their cooperative alliance in completing the project. The interchange is considered by Popular Mechanics as one of \\"The World's 18 Strangest Roadways\\", calling it a \\"labyrinth of lanes\\" and a \\"five- level marvel of engineering\\" because of its height, the number of its bridges and other unusual design and construction features.

Biography  Harris's summer home in Prince Edward Island. Harris was born in Chicago, Illinois as the youngest of eight children. He moved with his family to Oakland, California, after his father's broom factory burned to the ground. After high school, he attended the University of California, Berkeley. He graduated in 1901 with a B.S. in writing, and as an actor for the university theater troupe, he had gained a patron, Phoebe Apperson Hearst, the mother of William Randolph Hearst. With her financial backing, Harris was able to study in New York City and Europe for the next four years. When he returned to San Francisco, he became a newspaper reporter for the San Francisco Call-Bulletin, and lectured at clubs and universities on authors and playwrights, such as George Bernard Shaw and Henrik Ibsen. However, this didn't last long: when the San Francisco earthquake of 1906 destroyed the newspaper's office and the newspaper, Harris left for New York City. There he wrote feverishly for newspapers and magazines, contributing articles, reviews, and short stories. At the same time he was translating with Cora Older. He began to travel back and forth from Manhattan to the Bay Area, and in California he helped to found the Carmel-by- the-Sea artists' colony. At Carmel he dramatized his first play, Sham, a short story by Geraldine Bonner. Harris was married in 1908, and after his honeymoon he built a summer home in Fortune Bridge, Prince Edward Island, helping to establish a second artists' colony there. At Fortune Bridge he worked on his next three plays, The Offenders (1908), Trial Marriage (1909), and Thy Neighbor's Wife (1911). During this period, he divided his time between Fortune Bridge and New York City. When World War I broke out, he was 39, and so was ineligible for combat. He went to work for the Food Board under Herbert Hoover, but tired of working with Graham flour, he took a new position as civil aide to the commander in charge of amusements and morale at Camp Bowie, Texas, as a dramatic director with the Fosdick Commission. He was also stationed in San Diego. After the war he wrote his first screenplay, Lottery Man, in 1919. For the next twenty years he would be very prolific, collaborating on, directing, adapting, or supervising the production of almost 35 silent and \\"sound\\" films. He would live half the time in New York City, writing for the stage, and half in Hollywood, writing for the motion picture industry. In the 1920s, he wrote six screenplays that were produced by Peninsula Studios, including Chalk Marks (1924), The Girl on the Stairs (1924), The Wise Virgin (1924), The Awful Truth (1925), Beauty and The Badman (1925), and Let Women Alone (1925). He was also working on seven original screenplays of his own. He saw the major transitions in the motion picture industry occur, both the move from New York to Hollywood, and the progression from silent films to \\"talkies\\". His best known film was probably Johnny Belinda, released in 1948. He would base the story on the residents of the local area of his summer home in Fortune Bridge, and actual events that occurred there. The title character was based on Lydia Dingwell (1852‚Äì1931) of Dingwells Mills, Prince Edward Island. Elmer Blaney Harris died at age 88 in Washington, D.C.

His first science fiction story and novel appeared in 1978, when he was in his early sixties. By this point, however, he had already achieved success as a mainstream novelist, including a Miles Franklin Award, and as a literary critic. Biography Turner was born in Kalgoorlie, Western Australia, and educated in Melbourne. He served in the Australian Imperial Forces during the Second World War. Subsequently he worked in a variety of fields, including as an employment officer, as a technician in the textile industry, and was a reviewer of science fiction for the Melbourne Newspaper The Age.Collins, Paulsen & McMullen 1998, p. 173. Prior to writing science fiction, he had a well-established reputation as mainstream literary fiction writer, his most productive period being from 1959 to 1967, during which he published five novels. Two of these were award winning, The Cupboard Under the Stairs (1962), being awarded the Miles Franklin Award, Australia's highest literary honour, and The Lame Dog Man (1967) being awarded a Commonwealth Literary Fund fellowship.Blackford, Ikin & McMullen 1999, p. 145. During the 1970s, he gained considerable reputation for his reviews and criticism of science fiction, among his first critical publications in the field being in Australian Science Fiction Review, edited by John Bangsund, who at that time worked for Turner's publisher, Cassell Australia, and in SF fan magazine SF Commentary, edited by Bruce Gillespie. In 1977 he edited The View from the Edge, an anthology of tales produced by participants in a Melbourne writers' workshop, which he ran with science fiction authors Vonda McIntyre and Christopher Priest. Over a decade after his previous publication of a full- length work of fiction, he published 'Beloved Son' (1978), his first science fiction novel. An extract from the novel had previously been published as \\"The Lindley Mentascripts\\" in Science Fiction: A Review of Speculative Literature 1 in June 1977. Before his death he published six more science fiction novels.Blackford, Ikin & McMullen 1999, pp. 145‚Äì146. Science fiction Turner's science fiction narratives contain detailed extrapolation and their invariably earnest approach to moral and social issues. In such novels as The sea and Summer/Drowning Towers and Genetic Soldier he displayed a gloomy vision of global warming's future ramifications. The former novel won an Arthur C. Clarke Award. Much of his work has a strongly \\"Australian\\" feel, and it sometimes incorporates references to the Aboriginal peoples of his country. Turner's first science fiction novel, Beloved Son (1978), was followed by two related works, Vaneglory (1981) and Yesterday's Men (1983), comprising the Ethical Culture series. While they did not form a coherent trilogy, they were set in the same future, plagued by the problems of both a nuclear holocaust and the ravages of ill-advised experimentation with genetic food crops and epidemics caused by mutated viruses.Blackford, Ikin & McMullen 1999, p. 146. Vaneglory introduced perhaps his most memorable creation, the Children of Time, a secret society of mutant human beings who are virtually immortal and have certain advanced mental skills. Unlike similar fictional creations however they do not control human destiny- although they intermittently dabble in human politics, their cynical and self-absorbed personalities make it difficult for them to care much about humanity or to co-operate in planning its future. His next published novel The Sea and Summer (1987; published in the United States as Drowning Towers in 1988), was his most successful, being shortlisted for the Nebula Award and winning the Arthur C. Clarke Award in 1988. It was based on a short story \\"The Fittest\\" published in 1985 in Urban Fantasies edited by Russell Blackford and David King. A work of science fiction realism, it concerned a future historian, writing a historical novel about a near future Melbourne, beset by the problems of climate change, unemployment caused by excessive automation, the collapse of the monetary system and the division of society into elite communities segregated from impoverished masses.Blackford, Ikin & McMullen 1999, p. 147. Turner concluded the novel with a personal reflection on the urgency of giving serious consideration to social and environmental issues highlighted by the narrative .Blackford, Ikin & McMullen 1999, p. 148. His next two novels were both political thrillers set in the near future. Brainchild (1991) and The Destiny Makers (1993). Brainchild focused on journalist commissioned to investigate a genetic experiment that had led to varieties of humans beings with superior intelligence. Part of the novel was formed from the short story \\"On the Nursery Floor\\" (1985).Collins, Paulsen & McMullen 1998, p. 174. Genetic Soldier (1994) shared the timeline of The Destiny Makers. Subsequent to the events of that novel, the crew of a starship sent to explore for habitable planets, return to find themselves at odds with the inhabitants of the Earth, who have evolved in a more ecologically harmonious direction in their absence, and ostracise them for their incompatibility with a society determined by rigid genetic specialisation. The novel drew some inspiration from Turner's short story \\"Shut The Door When You Go Out\\" which dealt with a similar scenario .Blackford, Ikin & McMullen 1999, p. 149. George Turner was named as a Guest of Honor for Aussiecon Three, the 1999 World Science Fiction Convention held in Melbourne, but died before the event. In 2013 his The Sea and Summer became the first Australian novel to be included in Gollancz's SF Masterworks list.

West of Portland, US 30 generally follows the southern shore of the Columbia River; east of Portland the highway has largely been replaced with Interstate 84, though it is signed all the way across the state, and diverges from the I-84 mainline in several towns, as a de facto business route. (The state of Oregon does not sign Interstate business routes; instead it uses the designations US 30 and Oregon Route 99 (along the Interstate 5 corridor) for this purpose.) Out of all the states U.S. Route 30 traverses, it spends the most time in Oregon. At 477 miles, it is also the longest road in the state. Route description End US 30 Marker, Astoria, Oregon =Astoria to Portland= 1937 sketch including Columbia River Highway (now U.S. Route 30) as it passes west of Sauvie Island, northwest of Portland US 30 begins in Astoria, at an intersection with U.S. Route 101. US 101 southbound from the intersection goes down the length of the Oregon Coast, northbound US 101 crosses the Astoria-Megler Bridge into Washington state. US 30 proceeds east through the intersection, through downtown Astoria, and then along the southern bank of the Columbia. East of Astoria, US 30 is known as the Lower Columbia River Highway No. 2W (see Oregon highways and routes), a designation which it carries until Portland. Between Astoria and Portland, the highway passes through (or by) numerous Columbia River towns, such as Svensen, Knappa, Wauna, and Westport. In Westport, one can use the Wahkiakum County Ferry to cross the Columbia to Puget Island and Cathlamet, Washington. Continuing east, the highway passes through the communities of Woodson and Clatskanie. East of Clatskanie, the highway runs inland from the river a bit, approaching the town of Rainier, Oregon. Just before Rainier is an interchange providing access to the Lewis and Clark Bridge, which crosses the Columbia to Longview, Washington. After Rainier, the highway turns south, following a bend in the river, and runs parallel to Interstate 5 (which is across the river on the Washington side). Towns along the way include Goble, Deer Island, Columbia City, and St. Helens. South of Deer Island, US 30 becomes an expressway, known locally as St. Helens Road. The highway proceeds through the towns of Warren, Scappoose, and Burlington (as well as passing by the access road to Sauvie Island) before entering Portland. East of Scappoose is the confluence of the Columbia and Willamette Rivers. =Portland area= In northwest Portland, US 30 is sandwiched between Forest Park to the west and the Willamette River to the east. South of the Linnton area, US 30 Bypass heads east across the St. Johns Bridge. US 30 continues south along St. Helens Road, then later on Yeon Avenue through an industrial area as it approaches Downtown Portland. On the edge of Downtown Portland, US 30 briefly becomes a freeway, utilizing part of the route of the cancelled I-505, until its interchange with I-405 at the western end of the Fremont Bridge. US 30 crosses the Fremont Bridge (along with I-405), on the Stadium Freeway No. 61; at the eastern end of the bridge it joins Interstate 5 south for approximately one mile on the Pacific Highway No. 1 and then joins the Banfield Expressway (I-84), where it becomes the Columbia River Highway No. 2. For the remainder of its route in the Portland area, US 30 shares an alignment with I-84. I-84 passes through the eastern Portland suburbs of Fairview, Wood Village, Gresham, and Troutdale in this fashion. US 30 Bypass is the Northeast Portland Highway No. 123. It runs along the following streets before rejoining US 30 in Fairview: N.W. Bridge Avenue, N. Philadelphia Avenue, N. Ivanhoe Street, N. Richmond Avenue, N. Lombard Street, N.E. Lombard Street, N.E. Portland Highway, N.E. Killingsworth Street, N.E. Sandy Boulevard, and N.E. 238th Drive. U.S. Route 30 Business was a spur from US 30 Byp. northeast of Downtown Portland, across I-84/US 30 to Oregon Route 99E east of Downtown, just east of the Burnside Bridge. It has not rejoined US 30 on its west end since US 30 was moved onto I-405 and I-5 around Downtown. Former alignment Before the interstates were built, US 30 ran on Saint Helens Road to the Willamette Heights section of Portland, then on Wardway St, then Vaughn St, then NW 18th & 19th Avenues, then Burnside Street (now BR 30), then Sandy Blvd. =East of Portland= Historic Route 30 Sign US 30 runs mostly along I-84 in Oregon east of Portland, diverting to short segments of the old surface route to act as a business route or scenic route for I-84: *Historic Columbia River Highway No. 100 1 mile (2 km) through Cascade Locks (also designated the Cascade Locks Highway) *Mount Hood Highway No. 26 3 miles (4 km) through Hood River *Historic Columbia River Highway No. 100 and Mosier-The Dalles Highway No. 292 20 miles (32 km) from Mosier to The Dalles *Pendleton Highway No. 67 7 miles (11 km) through Pendleton *La Grande- Baker Highway No. 66 5 miles (9 km) through La Grande *La Grande-Baker Highway No. 66, 22 miles (36 km) from North Powder to Baker City *Huntington Highway No. 449 8 miles (13 km) through Huntington *Ontario Spur No. 493, 1 mile (1 km) from Ontario to the Idaho state line The sections concurrent with I-84 are part of the Columbia River Highway No. 2 west of U.S. Route 730 at Boardman and part of the Old Oregon Trail No. 6 east of U.S. Route 730. There is also a U.S. Route 30 Business signed in the Ontario area. This is part of the Olds Ferry-Ontario Highway No. 455. History In 1988, US 30 was realigned along NW Yeon Avenue in Portland to alleviate residential congestion. The new route utilized an interchange with I-405 that was intended for a proposed Interstate 505. The proposed interstate was intended to be a freeway spur in northwest Portland that would have connected I-405 to St. Helens Road, the latter being the original route for U.S. 30. The freeway was canceled in 1979 after plans were withdrawn, as it would have required condemnation and rerouting streets on a swath of land through the Northwest Industrial neighborhood.https://www.interstate-guide.com/i-505-or/ Major intersections See also * U.S. Route 630 * U.S. Route 730 * U.S. Route 830 References 30 Oregon Category:Columbia River Gorge Category:Interstate 84 (Oregon‚ÄìUtah) Category:Transportation in Multnomah County, Oregon Category:Transportation in Umatilla County, Oregon Category:Transportation in Wasco County, Oregon Category:Transportation in Baker County, Oregon Category:Transportation in Clatsop County, Oregon Category:Transportation in Columbia County, Oregon Category:Transportation in Hood River County, Oregon Category:Transportation in Malheur County, Oregon Category:Transportation in Gilliam County, Oregon Category:Transportation in Union County, Oregon Category:Transportation in Sherman County, Oregon Category:Transportation in Morrow County, Oregon ","title":"U.S. Route 30 in Oregon"},{"id":"2442873","text":"Justin Lanioux Jaschke is the founder and former chief executive officer of Verio, one of the world's largest domain hosting companies.

Miguel Covarrubias also known as Jos√© Miguel Covarrubias Duclaud (22 November 1904 ‚Äî 4 February 1957) was a Mexican painter, caricaturist, illustrator, ethnologist and art historian. Along with his American colleague Matthew W. Stirling, he was the codiscoverer of the Olmec civilization.Coe, Michael D. \\"Covarrubias, Miguel.\\" In Dav√≠d Carrasco (ed).The Oxford Encyclopedia of Mesoamerican Cultures. : Oxford University Press, 2001. Early life Jos√© Miguel Covarrubias Duclaud was born 22 November 1904 in Mexico City. After graduating from the Escuela Nacional Preparatoria at the age of 14, he started producing caricatures and illustrations for texts and training materials published by the Mexican Ministry of Public Education. He also worked for the Ministry of Communications. In 1924, at the age of 19, he moved to New York City armed with a grant from the Mexican government, tremendous talent, but very little English. In her book Covarrubias, author Adriana Williams writes that Mexican poet Jos√© Juan Tablada and New York Times critic/photographer Carl Van Vechten introduced him to New York's literary/cultural elite (known as the Smart Set). Soon Covarrubias was drawing for several top magazines, eventually becoming one of Vanity Fair magazine's premier caricaturists. Theatre work A man of many talents, he also began to design sets and costumes for the theater including Caroline Dudley Reagan's La Revue Negre starring Josephine Baker in the show that made her a smash in Paris. Other shows included Androcles and the Lion, The Four Over Thebes, and the Garrick Gaities' Rancho Mexicano number for dancer and choreographer Rosa Rolando (or Rolanda; born Rosemonde Cowan, and later to take the name Rosa Covarrubias). The two fell in love and traveled together to Mexico, Europe, Africa and the Caribbean in the mid to late 1920s. During one of their trips to Mexico, Rosa and Miguel traveled with Tina Modotti and Edward Weston, who taught Rosa photography. Rosa was also introduced to Miguel's family and friends including artist Diego Rivera. Rosa would become lifelong friends with Rivera's third wife, the artist Frida Kahlo. Caricatures and illustrations Miguel's artwork and celebrity caricatures have been featured in The New Yorker and Vanity Fair magazines. The linear nature of his drawing style was highly influential to other caricaturists such as Al Hirschfeld. Miguel's first book of caricatures The Prince of Wales and Other Famous Americans was a hit, though not all his subjects were thrilled that his sharp, pointed wit was aimed at them. He immediately fell in love with the Harlem jazz scene, which he frequented with Rosa and friends including Eugene O'Neill and Nickolas Muray. He counted many notables among his friends including Zora Neale Hurston, Langston Hughes and W.C. Handy for whom he also illustrated books. Miguel's caricatures of the jazz clubs were the first of their kind printed in Vanity Fair. He managed to capture the spirit of the Harlem Renaissance in much of his work as well as in his book, Negro Drawings. He did not consider these caricatures, but serious drawings of people, music and a culture he loved. Covarrubias also did illustrations for George Macy, the publisher of The Limited Editions Club, including Uncle Tom's Cabin, Green Mansions, Herman Melville's Typee, and Pearl Buck's All Men Are Brothers. Heritage Press, the sister organization of The Limited Editions Club, reprinted unsigned editions. In addition he did illustrations for publisher Alfred & Charles Boni's Frankie and Johnny for a young writer who would become a good friend and film director named John Huston. Today, these editions are very sought after by collectors. He collaborated in Austrian Artist Wolfgang Paalen's journal Dyn from 1942‚Äì44. Additionally his advertising, painting and illustration work brought him international recognition including gallery shows in Europe, Mexico and the United States as well as awards such as the 1929 National Art Directors' Medal for painting in color for his work on a Steinway & Sons piano advertisement.  Painting  Covarrubias was invited by the 1939-1940 Golden Gate International Exposition (GGIE) that was held on Treasure Island, \\"to create a mural set entitled Pageant of the Pacific to be the centerpiece of Pacific House, 'a center where the social, cultural and scientific interests of the countries in the Pacific Area could be shown to a large audience.'\\" Covarrubias painted the six murals for GGIE in San Francisco with his assistant Antonio M. Ruiz. The set of murals featured oversized, \\"illustrated maps entitled: The Fauna and Flora of the Pacific, Peoples, Art and Culture, Economy, Native Dwellings, and Native Means of Transportation. These murals were immensely popular at the GGIE and were later exhibited at the American Museum of Natural History in New York. Upon returning to San Francisco, five of the murals were installed at the World Trade Club in the Ferry Building where they hung until 2001. The whereabouts of the sixth mural, Art and Culture, are unknown and has been the subject of great speculation.\\" The Fauna and Flora of the Pacific mural is now on display at the de Young museum in San Francisco. \\"The colorful map depicts the four Pacific Rim continents with examples of their flora and fauna suspended in a swirling Pacific Ocean populated with sea creatures.\\" Personal life Miguel and Rosa married in 1930 and they took an extended honeymoon to Bali with the National Art Directors' Medal prize money where they immersed themselves in the local culture, language and customs. Miguel returned to Southeast Asia (Java, Bali, India, Vietnam) in 1933, as a Guggenheim Fellow with Rosa whose photography would become part of Miguel's book, Island of Bali. The book and particularly the marketing for months surrounding its release, contributed to the 1930s Bali craze in New York. He also spent time in China, where his work was very influential among artists in Shanghai.Paul Bevan: A Modern Miscellany: Shanghai Cartoon Artists, Shao Xunmei‚Äôs Circle and the Travels of Jack Chen, 1926-1938 (Leiden: Brill, 2016). Review: http://u.osu.edu/mclc/book- reviews/crespi2/ - retrieved 1 June 2018 Rosa Rolanda with writer Avery Hopwood, 1924. Rosa and Miguel returned to live in Mexico City where he continued to paint, illustrate and write. Their home, Tizap√°n, would become a hub for visitors from around the world including the likes of Nickolas Muray, Dolores del R√≠o, and Nelson Rockefeller. He taught ethnology at the Escuela Nacional de Antropolog√≠a e Historia and was appointed artistic director and director of administration for a new department at the Palacio de Bellas Artes, the National Palace of Fine Arts. His mandate was to add an Academy of Dance - a task to which Rosa with her dance and choreography background was most valuable. Miguel recruited friend and dancer Jos√© Lim√≥n who brought his dance company from New York City for the inaugural season in 1950, taught at Bellas Artes and helped arrange for international exposure of this new Mexican modern dance company. During Miguel's tenure, traditional Mexican dance was not only researched, documented and preserved but by this research into its roots, it helped usher in a new era in contemporary Mexican dance. In 1952, Covarrubias had completely separated from Rolanda in pursuit of one of his own students, Roc√≠o Saga√≥n. Notability Covarrubias‚Äô style was highly influential in America, especially in the 1920s and 1930s, and his artwork and caricatures of influential politicians and artists were featured on the covers of The New Yorker and Vanity Fair. Covarrubias is also known for his analysis of the pre-Columbian art of Mesoamerica, particularly that of the Olmec culture, and his theory of Mexican cultural diffusion to the north, particularly to the Mississippian Native American Indian cultures. His analysis of iconography presented a strong case that the Olmec predated the Classic Era years before this was confirmed by archaeology. In his thesis of a final cultural battle between Olmecs and Maya he was encouraged by his friend, the Austrian Surrealist and ethnological philosopher Wolfgang Paalen, who even went so far to describe the conflict as one of ancient matriarchal culture with new patriarchal orientations in Maya culture with its dominant adoration of the male sun-god Kukulkan. Both Paalen and Covarrubias published their ideas in Paalen's magazine DYN. Covarrubias interest in anthropology went beyond the arts and beyond the Americas‚ÄîCovarrubias lived in and wrote a thorough ethnography of the \\"Island of Bali\\". He shared his appreciation of foreign cultures with the world through his drawings, paintings, writings, and caricatures.

Professional wrestling career =Early career (1991-1993)= Robert Horne made his debut in 1991 and soon found himself teaming with Nelson Frazier in the Carolinas-based Pro Wrestling Federation. The two were kayfabe brothers in a team known as \\"The Harlem Knights\\" with Horne performing as \\"Bobby Knight\\" and Frazier performing as Nelson Knight. The heel team was managed by George South, who led the young team to two PWF Tag-Team titles over the years. =United States Wrestling Association (1993)= In 1993, The Harlem Knights moved on to the United States Wrestling Association based out of Memphis without their manager George South. While in the USWA, the team was pushed as the ‚ÄúMonster threat‚Äù due to their size and feuded with Jerry Lawler, Jeff Jarrett, and other faces. Their work in the PWF and the USWA got them noticed by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) and they were signed to a contract in mid-1993. =World Wrestling Federation (1993-1996)= Mo (left) as one-half of Men on a Mission in the World Wrestling Federation in 1994. When Horne and Frazier made their WWF debut, the vicious heel duo had been repackaged as faces with a rap gimmick. They wore bright clothes and had positive attitudes. They were teamed up with a rapping manager ‚ÄúOscar‚Äù and had their names changed to \\"Mo\\" (Horne) and \\"Mabel\\" (Frazier) while the team name was changed to ‚ÄúMen On a Mission‚Äù (or M.O.M., the initials of the three men). The team met with moderate success in the ring but got over mainly due to Mabel‚Äôs unusual size, their fun loving personas, and Oscar‚Äôs crowd pleasing raps. Their fun loving personalities were prominently displayed when they appeared at Survivor Series 1993 dressed up as Doinks (referred to by color commentator Bobby Heenan as ‚ÄúDoinks on a Mission‚Äù)\\\\ and teamed up with The Bushwhackers (also dressed as Doink) in a comedy match. Their next feud was against the WWF Tag Team Champions The Quebecers and they even won the titles during a United Kingdom tour. Two days later, the Quebecers regained the titles in a rematch. While the title change was reported on WWF television, the fact that Men on a Mission were former champions wasn‚Äôt something that was mentioned in the future. In the summer of 1994, Mabel started to wrestle more singles matches; he was seen as the spectacle of Men on a Mission due to his size, the ‚Äúspecial attraction‚Äù that got used to make rising stars look good. It wasn't until the early parts of 1995, that Men on a Mission started to team again on a regular basis. One night after another loss, Mabel and Mo attacked the Smoking Gunns in a fit of anger, then apologized for it later on. When they asked the Gunns to come to the ring to let them apologize, Men on a Mission attacked them once again and then beat up Oscar, turning the duo heel and dropping their rapping manager. After a short feud with the Smoking Gunns, Mabel won the 1995 King of the Ring tournament. He became King Mabel with his trusty sidekick being dubbed \\"Sir Mo\\", wrestling royalty. When Mabel became king, the focus shifted from the team to Mabel once more with Sir Mo acting more as a manager and less like an active competitor as Mabel challenged for the WWF Championship. One of the last notable appearances for Men on a Mission was at In Your House 2 where they beat Razor Ramon and Savio Vega. They were also the opponents in the match where the British Bulldog turned on partner Diesel. Mabel and Mo's last appearance in the WWF together was at the 1996 Royal Rumble, where Mo accompanied Mabel at ringside, while he participated in the match, until he was eliminated by Yokozuna. Afterwards they left the WWF. =World Championship Wrestling (1995)= While still being under contact by the WWF, Horne worked under his real name in World Championship Wrestling on March 25, 1995 as a jobber teaming with Barry Houston as they lost to Bunkhosue Buck and Dick Slater on WCW Saturday Night. =Return to USWA and Independent circuit (1996-2007)= After leaving the WWF Mo returned to Memphis and the USWA where he became a part of the original Nation of Domination, the stable that was a forerunner to the more famous stable in the WWF. Mo became \\"Sir Mohammad\\", using a black supremacist gimmick. The USWA version of the N.O.D. was led by PG-13 J.C. Ice and Wolfie D) and also included Kareem Olajuwon (Reggie B. Fine), Akeem Muhamad (Big Black Dog), Elijah (the Spellbinder), Shaquille Ali (Tracy Smothers), Randy X, and Queen Moishe (Jacqueline). After group disbanded, Mo and Mabel reformed Men On A Mission on March 18, 1996. Faarooq started the Nation of Domination in the WWF, due to the USWA version of the group disbanding, where they had major success. Men On A Mission disbanded on June 17, 1996. Horne would remain in the Memphis region wrestling mainly as Rob Harlem, competing under that name in the USWA, its successor ‚ÄúMemphis Pro Wrestling‚Äù, and Randy Hales‚Äô ‚ÄúPower Pro Wrestling‚Äù. While in PPW, Horne teamed up with ‚ÄúDeon Harlem‚Äù to form the tag team ‚ÄúThe Regulators‚Äù. The team beat Derrick King in a Handicap match to win the PPW Tag Team Title, which they held when the promotion closed down in April 2001. In 1997, Horne would start his own promotion ‚ÄúSouthern Extreme Wrestling‚Äù which he both booked and wrestled for. Horne‚Äôs ‚ÄúSouthern Extreme Wrestling‚Äù is not affiliated with the \\"Southern Extreme Wrestling Promotions\\" organization that operates today. He returned to WWF as Buzz on September 6, 1997 beating a jobber at a house show in Nashville, Tennessee. In 2003, Bobby Horne added yet another gimmick to his long list of gimmicks. On December 30, Mabel was at ringside commentating when manager Paul Wylde came out and introduced the ‚ÄúBahamian Heavyweight Champion‚Äù \\"Marly Pride\\". Wylde started making comments that Mabel was the fattest whale which Mabel took exception to. When the big man entered the ring, Marley Pride was revealed as his former tag-team partner Mo who attacked him and the two brawled until they were separated by officials. Mo and Mabel had a short feud in Memphis Wrestling. On March 1, 2006 Horne as Mo defeated Bad News at a dark match for Ohio Valley Wrestling. Then on April 21, 2007 Mo defeated Christina York at ISPW in Newton, New Jersey. He then retired from wrestling and went into truck driving. =Return To Independent circuit (2015)= In May 2015, he worked four shows as Sir Mo teaming with Davey Boy Smith Jr. for Ultimate Championship Wrestling in Nova Scotia, Canada. He returned to the Maritimes in July with partner Lord Deon (Johnson) for three more shows. On July 30, the team - known as MOM2K - won the UCW tag team titles by beating Sidewalk Sam and Homeless Bob in Halifax, Nova Scotia. Currently (January 2019) Horne runs SOAR Championship Wrestling with his wife Denise Jones in Dallas Texas.

They are also called Berger's waves after the founder of EEG. Alpha waves are one type of brain waves detected either by electroencephalography (EEG) or magnetoencephalography (MEG), and can be quantified using quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG). They predominantly originate from the occipital lobe during wakeful relaxation with closed eyes. Alpha waves are reduced with open eyes, drowsiness and sleep. Historically, they were thought to represent the activity of the visual cortex in an idle state. More recent papers have argued that they inhibit areas of the cortex not in use, or alternatively that they play an active role in network coordination and communication. Occipital alpha waves during periods of eyes closed are the strongest EEG brain signals. An alpha-like variant called a mu wave can be found over the primary motor cortex.  Research  =Possible types and origins= Some researchers posit that there are at least two forms of alpha waves, which may have different functions in the wake-sleep cycle. Alpha waves are present at different stages of the wake-sleep cycle. The most widely researched is during the relaxed mental state, where the subject is at rest with eyes closed, but is not tired or asleep. This alpha activity is centered in the occipital lobe, and is presumed to originate there, although there has been recent speculation that it instead has a thalamic origin. This wave begins appearing at around four months, and is initially a frequency of 4 waves per second. The mature alpha wave, at 10 waves per second, is firmly established by age 3. The second occurrence of alpha wave activity is during REM sleep. As opposed to the awake form of alpha activity, this form is located in a frontal-central location in the brain. The purpose of alpha activity during REM sleep has yet to be fully understood. Currently, there are arguments that alpha patterns are a normal part of REM sleep, and for the notion that it indicates a semi-arousal period. It has been suggested that this alpha activity is inversely related to REM sleep pressure. It has long been believed that alpha waves indicate a wakeful period during sleep. This has been attributed to studies where subjects report non-refreshing sleep and have EEG records reporting high levels of alpha intrusion into sleep. This occurrence is known as alpha wave intrusion. However, it is possible that these explanations may be misleading, as they only focus on alpha waves being generated from the occipital lobe. =Meditation= Mindfulness meditation has been shown to increase alpha wave power in both healthy subjects and patients. Practitioners of Transcendental Meditation have demonstrated a one Hertz reduction in alpha wave frequency relative to controls. =Alpha wave intrusion= Alpha wave intrusion occurs when the alpha waves appear with non-REM sleep when delta activity is expected. It is hypothesized to be associated with fibromyalgia, although the study may be inadequate due to a small sampling size. Despite this, alpha wave intrusion has not been significantly linked to any major sleep disorder, including fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, and major depression. However, it is common in chronic fatigued patients, and may amplify the effects of other sleep disorders. =Mistake prediction= Following this lapse-of-attention line of thought, a recent study indicates that alpha waves may be used to predict mistakes. In it, MEGs measured increases of up to 25% in alpha brain wave activity before mistakes occurred. This study used common sense: alpha waves indicate idleness, and mistakes are often made when a person is doing something automatically, or \\"on auto-pilot\\", and not paying attention to the task they are performing. After the mistake was noticed by the subject, there was a decrease in alpha waves as the subject began paying more attention. This study hopes to promote the use of wireless EEG technology on employees in high-risk fields, such as air traffic controlling, to monitor alpha wave activity and gauge the attention level of the employee. Measurement = EEG artefacts = As demonstrated by Dr. Adrian R. M. Upton, it is possible for extraneous sources (ambient fluctuations detected with a mound of Jell-O in Upton's experiments) to cause signals to appear on an EEG readout, causing false signals to be interpreted as healthy alpha waves. This finding suggests that it is possible that a non-flat EEG could lead to the interpretation that a patient is still living when in fact he or she is long dead.JELL‚Äê0 TEST FINDS LIFELIKE SIGNAL, By BOYCE RENSBERGER, New York Times, MARCH 6, 1976 Cecil Adams from The Straight Dope discusses this scenario: > Sometimes it's claimed Jell-O brainwaves are identical to a healthy adult's. > That's clearly a stretch, but the Jell-O EEG readings do look pretty similar > to a normal human alpha rhythm. Alpha waves are observed when a patient is > awake and resting with eyes closed, and in some kinds of sleep and > reversible coma. True, the Jell-O waves are a little slower and of much > lower amplitude, barely within normal human limits, but that doesn't tell > you much by itself. Hypoxia, encephalitis, and other medical conditions can > cause reduced frequency and amplitude, as can drug use. History The sample of human EEG with prominent alpha-rhythm in occipital sites Alpha waves were discovered by German neurologist Hans Berger, the inventor of the EEG itself. Alpha waves were among the first waves documented by Berger, along with beta waves, and he displayed an interest in \\"alpha blockage\\", the process by which alpha waves decrease and beta waves increase upon a subject opening their eyes. This distinction earned the alpha wave the alternate title of \\"Berger's Wave\\". Berger took a cue from Ukrainian physiologist Vladimir Pravdich-Neminsky, who used a string galvanometer to create a photograph of the electrical activity of a dog's brain. Using similar techniques, Berger confirmed the existence of electrical activity in the human brain. He first did this by presenting a stimulus to hospital patients with skull damage and measuring the electrical activity in their brains. Later he ceased the stimulus method and began measuring the natural rhythmic electrical cycles in the brain. The first natural rhythm he documented was what would become known as the alpha wave. Berger was very thorough and meticulous in his data-gathering, but despite his brilliance, he did not feel confident enough to publish his discoveries until at least five years after he had made them. In 1929, he published his first findings on alpha waves in the journal Archiv f√ºr Psychiatrie. He was originally met with derision for his EEG technique and his subsequent alpha and beta wave discoveries. His technique and findings did not gain widespread acceptance in the psychological community until 1937, when he gained the approval of the famous physiologist Lord Adrian, who took a particular interest in alpha waves. Alpha waves again gained recognition in the early 1960s and 1970s with the creation of a biofeedback theory relating to brain waves (see below). Such biofeedback, referred to as a kind of neurofeedback, relating to alpha waves is the conscious elicitation of alpha brainwaves by a subject. Two researchers in the United States explored this concept through unrelated experiments. Joe Kamiya, of the University of Chicago, discovered that some individuals had the conscious ability to recognize when they were creating alpha waves, and could increase their alpha activity. These individuals were motivated through a reward system from Kamiya. The second progenitor of biofeedback is Barry Sterman, from the University of California, Los Angeles. He was working with monitoring brain waves in cats and found that, when the cats were trained to withhold motor movement, they released SMR, or mu, waves, a wave similar to alpha waves. Using a reward system, he further trained these cats to enter this state more easily. Later, he was approached by the United States Air Force to test the effects of a jet fuel that was known to cause seizures in humans.

Biography Virginia Gildersleeve was born in New York City, she attended the Brearley School and following her graduation in 1895 went on to attend Barnard College, a member of the Seven Sisters affiliated with Columbia University. She completed her studies in 1899 and received a fellowship to undertake research for her MA in medieval history at Columbia University. She taught English part-time at Barnard for several years. She declined a full-time position and took a leave of absence to undertake her Ph.D. in English and comparative literature at Columbia for three years. When she completed her studies in 1908 she was appointed a lecturer in English in 1908 by Barnard and Columbia; by 1910 she had become an assistant professor and in 1911 was made dean of Barnard College. In 1918 Gildersleeve, Caroline Spurgeon, and Rose Sidgwick met while the two English women were on an academic exchange to the United States. They discussed founding an international association of university women, and in 1919 founded the International Federation of University Women. Gildersleeve shared an \\"intimate\\" relationship with the British Spurgeon, with whom she annually shared a rental summer home. Following World War I she became interested in international politics. She campaigned for Al Smith and Franklin D. Roosevelt. During World War II she chaired the Advisory Council of the navy's women's unit, the WAVES and following the war she was appointed to the United Nations Charter Committee. She was involved in the reconstruction of higher education in Japan. For this work she received France's Legion of Honor. Dean of Barnard College Barnard College Throughout her tenure as Dean of Barnard College, Gildersleeve worked to advance women's rights by championing their access to Columbia' professional school and to the best professors. This included hiring Charles A. Beard, a young Columbia instructor in 1914 to teach Barnard's first course in American government so that Barnard graduates would be eligible to attend the Columbia School of Journalism. At the beginning of World War I, she hired the head of Columbia's anthropology department, Franz Boas, when he was threatened with being fired because of his objections to World War I. Professor Boas was a German Jewish immigrant and a Socialist. Among the Barnard undergraduates, Boas found several of the century's most outstanding anthropologists, including Margaret Mead. Barnard had only a few African-American students during Gildersleeve's tenure. Zora Neale Hurston was a pioneer in 1925, who attended Barnard with assistance from her literary mentor Fannie Hurst and Barnard College co-founder Annie Nathan Meyer. In the early 1940s, Dean Gildersleeve paid for the full scholarship of at least one African-American student from Harlem out of her own pocket. Gildersleeve opposed religious exclusivity and refused to openly categorize her students, but took steps to reduce the number of Jewish students. In the 1930s, roughly 20 percent of Barnard students were Jewish, compared to 6 to 10 percent at most other women's colleges, although Jewish enrollment at Columbia College had reached 40 percent before World War I. According to Gildersleeve's biographer Rosalind Rosenberg, both Columbia and Barnard began recruiting students from outside New York City, evaluating applicants on the basis of psychological tests, interviews, and letters of recommendation, as well as academic criteria, thereby lowering the number of Jewish applicants accepted. In the two decades before World War II, this process of selective admissions reduced the percentage of Jewish students at both Columbia and Barnard to 20 percent. Politics and foreign affairs Gildersleeve encouraged faculty and students to engage in all the political movements of the day even though the Barnard College Board of Trustees believed that \\"marching in a parade would be a shocking and shameful thing\\" for female students to do, and some school administrators considered political activism \\"unladylike\\" and \\"too sordid for a refined woman,\\". Virginia Gildersleeve, 1921 During World War I, Gildersleeve contributed vigorously to wartime civil defense activities in New York City. She was an early and strong supporter of the formation of the League of Nations. On February 22, 1918, Gildersleeve called for \\"some ordered system of international government, backed by power enough to give authority to its decrees\\". When Germany invaded Poland in 1939, Gildersleeve, was a strong interventionist. In 1942, early in World War II, Gildersleeve was instrumental in founding the WAVES (\\"Women Accepted for Volunteer Emergency Service\\"). Its second in command was Gildersleeve's companion, English Professor Elizabeth Reynard; and all of its members ‚Äì 90,000 in all-were college graduates. In 1945, Franklin D. Roosevelt named Gildersleeve ‚Äì the only woman named ‚Äì to the U.S. delegation to write the United Nations Charter. They were instructed to address two issues: 1) the need to prevent future wars through the creation of a Security Council; and 2) the need to enhance human welfare, which they accomplished through the establishment of the United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC). Gildersleeve sought and received drafting responsibility for the work of this second Council‚Äîthe one, as she put it, in charge of \\"doing things rather than preventing things from being done.\\" She was able to insert into the Charter the following goals for people around the world: \\"higher standards of living, full employment, and conditions of economic and social progress and development.\\" She also persuaded the delegates to adopt the following aim for the United Nations: \\"universal respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex, language, or religion.\\" She insisted that the Charter require the appointment of the Commission on Human Rights, which under the direction of Eleanor Roosevelt, wrote the Universal Declaration of Human Rights three years later. In March 1946, having been invited by General Douglas MacArthur, Gildersleeve served as a member of the U.S. Educational Mission to Japan. She was respected in Japan for having been the only American woman delegate at the San Francisco founding conference. Some historians consider Gildersleeve to have been \\"the most influential leader\\" of the Christian \\"anti-Zionist lobby\\" of her era.Christian attitudes towards the State of Israel, Paul Charles Merkley. McGill-Queen's Press - MQUP, 2001, p. 6. Gildersleeve wrote that \\"after (her) retirement from the Deanship at Barnard, (she) devoted (her)self mainly to the Middle East,\\" describing herself as \\"struggling ardently against\\" the creation and, later, the continued existence of the Jewish State. She blamed her failure to prevent the creation of the State of Israel on \\"the Zionist control of the media of communication.\\" Gildersleeve repeatedly testified before congressional committees and lobbied members of Congress and President Harry Truman to deny American political, military, and financial support to Israel. Gildersleeve was a trustee of the American University of Beirut and a leading figure in the Christian opposition to Israel's statehood in 1948. She helped found and chaired the Committee for Justice and Peace in the Holy Land, which merged into the American Friends of the Middle East. According to historian Robert Moats Miller, of the University of North Carolina, the group was funded by the Central Intelligence Agency and ARAMCO.Harry Emerson Fosdick: preacher, pastor, prophet, Robert Moats Miller, Oxford University Press US, 1985, p. 192. Miller states that Gildersleeve's \\"sympathies were indeed overwhelmingly with the Arabs.\\" Women's equality Gildersleeve was an early advocate of paid leaves of absence for female faculty members. In 1931 she raised the matter with Columbia President Butler, who \\"looked a little startled.\\" But, Butler agreed, saying \\"We should have women teachers with fuller lives and richer experience, not so many dried-up old maids\\" Gildersleeve recorded this remark in her memoir without comment. She persuaded the Barnard Board of Trustees to enact a maternity policy that provided one term off at full pay or a year off at half pay for all new faculty mothers. In the first year three women took advantage of this new policy. In 1915, in a speech to the Columbia Chapter of Phi Beta Kappa she challenged the commonly held belief that the education of women was a detriment to society, arguing that improved public health and the declining infant mortality made it unnecessary to breed as many children as once had been the case. In the modern world women could have the same ambitions as men. Rosalind Rosenberg, Gildersleeve's biographer, has argued that \\"Through her work Gildersleeve and other pioneers like her provided the essential conditions necessary to winning for women full equality with men in American society and throughout the world. ‚Ä¶ In broadening women's scholarly horizons, Gildersleeve laid the groundwork for some of the most innovative scholarship of the twentieth century. And in helping to draft the charter of the UN, Gildersleeve assured that the issues to which she had devoted her career on Morningside Heights would be addressed throughout the world in the decades that followed. By insisting that women have the right to every educational opportunity open to men, and by fighting her whole life to secure that opportunity, she helped establish the bedrock on which feminists have been building ever since.\\" Sexuality In her 1954 memoir, Gildersleeve protested the \\"particularly cruel and unwholesome discrimination against unmarried women,\\" like herself, who chose to spend their lives living with other women. She attributed this trend to \\"the less responsible psychologists and psychiatrists of the day,\\" who voiced \\"disrespect for spinsters in the teaching profession as 'inhibited' and 'frustrated.'\\" Gildersleeve never identified herself as a lesbian, preferring instead the adjective \\"celibate.\\" For several decades she lived with companion Professor Caroline Spurgeon. Later she lived with Barnard English Professor Elizabeth Reynard and they are buried together at Saint Matthew's Episcopal Churchyard, Bedford (town), New York. International Federation of University Women Gildersleeve and Spurgeon met just after the First World War ended when a delegation of British educators came to the United States. Caroline Spurgeon, a highly respected Shakespeare scholar who published many books and papers about both Chaucer and Shakespeare, taught at Bedford College for Women, part of the University of London. Together they worked to establish an organization that would foster international cooperation among like-minded academic women. Gildersleeve imagined an organization built on the model of the American Association of Collegiate Alumnae and the British Federation of University Women. In 1919 they created the International Federation of University Women (IFUW), housing it in London with a second home in Paris at Reid Hall. For two decades, between World War I and World War II, Gildersleeve worked through the IFUW to keep alive the spirit of international understanding, even as isolationism gripped her country. They believed that the women of the world could make change by talking to and learning from each other. Tributes In 1969 eleven members of the International Federation of University Women founded the Virginia Gildersleeve International Fund (VGIF).(See http://www.vgif.org). The Fund to date has awarded more than 400 grants for a total project aid disbursement of over US$1.8 million to women's groups in low per capita income countries. Priority is given to income generation and community development projects which enhance and utilize women's educational, vocational, and leadership skills. Project activities range from seminars, conferences, and training workshops to community-action projects. Published works * * (essays) References *Brown., C.F. 2000 Gildersleeve, Virginia Crocheron.

Their label \\"Truth Commission\\" was a take on the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission. History The Truth Commission debuted in the USWA in 1996, where Recon and Kurrgan (then known as The Interrogator) captured the USWA Tag Team Championship and Tank briefly captured the USWA Unified World Heavyweight Championship. Their manager, the Commandant, was an actor who had met Bret Hart while Hart was filming in South Africa. Hart recommended him to the WWF as a manager for the Truth Commission. it was rumored in 1997 that Truth Commission would be the bodyguards and hired guns of The Hart Foundation. During a 1997 WWE tour of South Africa, The Commandant, stated during a promo that he was going to unleash his Commandos and Militia upon WWF by bringing glory to the South African nation. Upon moving to the WWF, the Commandant was quickly replaced by Truth Commission member The Jackyl because the WWF wanted someone in the role who could participate physically in the matches. Incidentally, Jackyl was initially more interested in being a wrestler than the group's manager, but WWF booker Vince McMahon convinced him to cut promos on behalf of the Truth Commission because of his verbal talent. Tank departed from the WWF after two matches. The Interrogator name was changed to Kurrgan and he was pushed as a monster heel while Recon and Sniper competed as a tag team. The stable started to fall apart when Jackyl expressed how disappointed he was with Recon and Sniper, who had little success in their matches. During this time, Jackyl would pay more attention to Kurrgan's career than Recon and Sniper. He would enter the ring when one or both of them lost a match, berated and slapped them, then ordered the towering Kurrgan to attack them. Eventually, Recon and Sniper formed the team of Armageddon (under their real names of Buchanan and Poirier) but left the WWF after several matches. They continued to work together as Recon and Sniper in other promotions until disbanding in 1999. Kurrgan remained a part of The Jackyl's new stable, The Oddities. Jackyl would later manage The Acolytes and left WWF in December 1998 and went to Extreme Championship Wrestling as Cyrus the Virus. Kurrgan would stay with the Oddities until they disbanded on February 28, 1999 and he was released in March 1999. Sniper would return to Germany for Catch Wrestling Association and then retired from wrestling in 1999. In 2000 Recon would later return to the WWF as Bull Buchanan, first as a tag team partner of the Big Bossman, then later as a member of Right to Censor. He later teamed up with John Cena until his release from the company in 2003. He would make a final appearance years later as part of a \\"This is Your Life, John Cena\\" segment featuring Mick Foley, in which he began by remembering his time as Cena's tag team partner at first fondly, but on an increasingly-sour note until concluding by accusing Cena of ruining his life.

Baseball Mogul tied with CART Precision Racing to win Computer Gaming Worlds 1997 \\"Sports Game of the Year\\" award. The editors called it \\"about as humble as games get, but it was more original than any sports title this year\\". Other games using the Baseball Mogul engine Microsoft Baseball 2001 was an action-oriented baseball game that used the Baseball Mogul engine and allowed players to control the franchise. MLB Slugfest and MLB Slugfest: Loaded are a series of action-oriented baseball games for PS2, Xbox and GameCube that used the Baseball Mogul engine for in-game and franchise simulation. Gameplay Prior to Baseball Mogul 2007, all games were simulated, with the player assuming the combined role of general manager/manager/owner. Players oversee an entire baseball franchise, and possess the ability to set batting lineups, make trades, and set ticket and concession prices. Baseball Mogul 2007 added a play-by-play option to control every pitch of a game. Baseball Mogul relies primarily on text-based menus. =Configuration= When starting a new game, the player must choose from one of five options: * Modern - Take control of a team with its Opening Day 2019 roster. * Classic - Play in any year from 1901 through 2018. * Fictional - Play in a league with fictional players and fictional team names. This takes a bit longer to start because it simulates some fictional years to develop stats for the players that will appear on each team. * Expansion - Play any of the 14 expansion teams that developed between 1961 and 1998. As of Baseball Mogul 2015, players can also create their own team in a city of their choice, with the AI making a second team to have 32 teams overall. * Custom - This allows you to use any saved game as your Universe. This is how player-made rosters are used in-game. After selecting one of those five options the players must choose the level of difficulty (Fan, Coach, Manager, or Mogul). The opposing AI strengthens, and the player's initial operating budget shrinks with each increment in difficulty. The following options further determine the nature of the game's simulation and are listed under \\"Advanced Options\\": * Equalize Cities generates cities and regions with identical population bases. This offers an advantage to real- world teams from smaller markets, such as the Tampa Bay Rays or the Cincinnati Reds. * Shuffle All Teams reassigns every roster, so each team has a random set of players. * Fictional Players generates a new set of players with randomly generated statistics. * Fictional Teams renames all teams, complete with nicknames (i.e. the San Francisco Giants become the California Cowboys). It does not create any teams in cities that do not already have a Major League Franchise, and the Team History option still shows the actual team's history up until the year the league started. * Fictional Rookies supplies randomly generated rookies to the Amateur Draft. This option may be combined with Historical Rookies, but it will automatically be on if Historical Rookies is turned off. * Historical Rookies supplies historical players (and associated data) as rookies to the Amateur Draft. Only players with Major League experience qualify, and the depth of the player pool depends on the game year. Lack of data may produce player shortages if Fictional Rookies is disabled. Games set in the present cannot enable Historical Rookies. * Don't Randomize Players smooths fluctuations in player performance, allowing more accurate prediction of game outcomes. This was formerly named Simulation Mode. =Player ratings= A variety of player attributes are rated numerically on a 100-point scale, though none are likely to score lower than 40 or 50 except for relief pitchers' Endurance. Ratings vary over time with player development, aging, and injuries suffered. All players possess an Overall rating, a combination of all other measures weighted by position, a Peak projection of overall performance at the height of his career, and an indication of Health, the likelihood of succumbing to personal injury, which declines with age and major injuries. Position players are rated for a variety of measures of batting, baserunning, and fielding prowess. Contact and Power ratings correlate to a batter's ability to connect with pitches and do so solidly, influencing batting average and extra base hits. Swinging-at-a-pitch determination, or not, relates to the Eye rating, with highly rated players properly identifying good pitches from bad. Laying down bunts and running the bases are also measured, by Bunt and Speed ratings. Defensive talent is broken into Range, Arm, and Fielding ratings, measuring aptitudes to reach and quickly dispose of batted balls with skill and consistency. Pitchers are rated for a variety of measures of pitching skills. Power measures pitch velocity and strikeout rate. Accuracy in pitch placement and walk rate relates to a pitcher's Control rating. Movement indicates the action, or movement, on pitches thrown, with highly rated pitchers inducing more ground balls or popups from opposing batters. Endurance roughly indicates the pitch count that can be thrown before fatigue sets in, adversely affecting velocity, control, or movement. Batting and fielding skills for pitchers are conflated into \\"Hitting\\" and \\"Defense\\" ratings, respectively, with values comparable only to other pitchers. For example, a Hitting score of 90 would not qualify a pitcher to start as a position player. =Online play= Many players choose to run leagues with their friends using Baseball Mogul. This gameplay is similar to fantasy baseball, except that the games are simulated by the engine and thus leagues can continue beyond the Major League Baseball season. The league commissioner posts game results as a saved game file, and each player downloads this file, makes adjustments to his team, and sends his updated file to the league commissioner. =Deprecated features (in previous versions)= *For a couple of versions, Baseball Mogul used a \\"point\\" system instead of dollars for assessing values for contracts. *Players used to be graded by letter grades, and are now graded numerically. This allows for a greater degree of granularity in assessing players. For example, both an 80 and an 82 would be displayed as a 'B-', but one is slightly better than the other, and the numerical scale covers that difference.

Biography Halliday was born in Brooklyn, New York. In infancy, he moved with his parents to Europe, and he lived abroad until he was 18. He served with the British Army 1901-02 in the Boer War in South Africa. In 1905 Halliday, a civil/mining engineer from before his South Africa adventure, migrated to Nevada and dug up a fortune in gold nuggets and managed to lose the lot. After losing his money in the stock market in Sacramento, Halliday became an actor with a stock theater company headed by Nat Goodwin. He progressed from that group to touring the world as leading man in a troupe headed by T. Daniel Frawley. Making his Broadway debut in 1912 in Cecil Raleigh and Henry Hamilton's The Whip, he became a familiar presence there, especially in sophisticated comedies such as W. Somerset Maugham's The Circle (1921), Vincent Lawrence's Sour Grapes (1926), Louis Verneuil's Jealousy (1928) and S. N. Behrman's Rain from Heaven (1934). He was also well known for his film roles. He was one of the leading actors in the drama film Millie. His best-known movie appearance was as \\"Seth Lord\\", father of Tracy Lord (Katharine Hepburn) in the film adaptation of Philip Barry's The Philadelphia Story (1940). The following year he played his final role in Lydia (1941). In 1929, Halliday married actress Eleanor Griffith in Greenwich, Connecticut. He died from a heart ailment at the age of 67 on October 17, 1947 in Hawaii.

His great successes as an owner, however, came in association with the expert Irish horsemen connected to the Coolmore Stud of John Magnier. In 1994 Tabor paid more than $400,000 for the promising two-year-old thoroughbred Thunder Gulch. The horse went on to win the Kentucky Derby, the Belmont Stakes and the Travers Stakes, narrowly missing the American Triple Crown when he was beaten by less than a length in the Preakness Stakes. Tabor had been looking for a horse to race in America having moved to Miami, Florida, and had been pointed for advice to John Magnier by a mutual friend, J.P. McManus. Demi O'Byrne, the bloodstock adviser to Magnier, advised Tabor on his purchase and Magnier bought half of Thunder Gulch to stand at stud at Coolmore's Kentucky annexe at Ashford. Tabor joined the Coolmore partnership. His money allowed Magnier to become once again a major buyer in the top yearling sales, a role he had not played since the mid-1980s when he had acted in conjunction with Robert Sangster and other associates. In 1995 they bought three of the top four yearlings at the Keeneland Sales and paid 600,000 guineas for the leading lot at Tattersalls' Houghton Sale. That colt, Entrepreneur, went on to win the 2,000 Guineas at Newmarket.\\"Coolmore: the growth of an empire\\", the- racehorse.com, 26 April 2006. Retrieved 12 October 2012. Tabor became the owner and co-owner of an extraordinary catalogue of some of the world's best racehorses, generally owning the Coolmore horses in a three-way partnership with Magnier and his wife Sue, and with another former London bookmaker, Derrick Smith, who became involved in the mid-2000s. His Desert King won the Irish 2,000 Guineas and the Irish Derby in 1997, while Entrepreneur took the 2,000 Guineas at Newmarket that same year to give Tabor his first victory in an English Classic. Montjeu won the Irish Derby and the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe in 1999, while Tabor won The Derby in 2001 and 2002 with Galileo and then High Chaparral, the latter horse also winning the Irish Derby and the Breeders' Cup Turf. Tabor won the Derby again, with Pour Moi in 2011 and with Camelot in 2012, the year that horse also took the 2,000 Guineas and the Irish Derby at the Curragh, though he missed out on the English Triple Crown by finishing second in the St Leger. Tabor was also the breeder, as well as the owner, of Giant's Causeway, winner of numerous Group One races, and in 1995 his Hurricane Run was voted the world's top-ranked racehorse by the International Federation of Horseracing Authorities. His Derby victories made Tabor one of only four men to have raced a winner of both the Epsom and the Kentucky Derbies; the others are Paul Mellon, John W. Galbreath and Prince Ahmed bin Salman. Tabor acknowledged the superiority of his Irish associates in their judgment of horses, telling The Independent newspaper: \\"I enjoy going round looking at the horses and I like to think I've got a fair idea. But I don't know a lot really and a little knowledge is dangerous.\\" Discussing the economics of Coolmore's extremely successful breeding operation, Tabor said: \\"I get enormous pleasure out of the horses but, it goes without saying, that you're trying to make stallions. You need a stallion, maybe a stallion and a half, every year.\\" Other business interests In May 2014 Tabor assumed a 100% control of Victor Chandler International after Victor Chandler sold his interest in the firm. His racing associations have also extended into other areas of business. With Magnier, Derrick Smith and J.P.

Freight cars were transferred here between the two lines, leaving the same way they came; a direct connection avoiding the yard was impossible due to the lack of a suitable connecting track. *The CNJ's Allentown Yard was just east of Allentown, Pennsylvania; the RDG and L&HR; had trackage rights along the CNJ to the yard. *The RDG's Rutherford Yard just east of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania; the RDG here combined traffic from Allentown (including L&HR; traffic from New England via the NYNH&H; through Maybrook), Jersey City and the New York / New Jersey metro area (via the CNJ to Allentown), and Philadelphia. *The WM's Jamison Yard in Hagerstown, MD, where traffic from the RDG via Rutherford Yard was combined with traffic from Baltimore on the WM. *The NYNH&H;'s Maybrook Yard was just east of the junction with the L&HR.; Cars were transferred between the two lines. *The NYNH&H;'s Cedar Hill Yard was in New Haven, Connecticut. Through trains continued on to Providence and Boston, while some freight was transferred to other NYNH&H; lines at Cedar Hill. The freight trains along the middle section of the route were known as Alpha Jets. The WM, P&WV; and NKP (and later WM and Norfolk & Western, after merger of latter two lines into N&W; in 1964) generally operated two daily \\"run-through\\" freight trains each way via their connection in Connellsville, Pennsylvania. The westbound trains were variously symbolled AJ-1 (Alpha Jet 1) and Advance AJ-1, 1st AJ-1 and 2nd AJ-1, then later PAJ-1 and WAJ-1. The eastbound runs were usually called AJ-2 and AJ-12, with an Advanced AJ-12 sometimes also running. These runs originated or terminated in either the RDG's Rutherford Yard near Harrisburg, PA or in the WM yard at Hagerstown, MD, and ran to or from Toledo, OH and Detroit, MI. The Advanced sections usually originated or terminated in Bellevue, OH. For a time during the 1970s, the RDG also symbolled its high- priority connection run from Philadelphia to Rutherford, PA as an Alpha Jet. Three major sources of traffic for these trains were: # automobile manufacturing parts and supplies going from eastern factories to the Detroit and Toledo automotive manufacturing regions, and autos and manufactured items moving from these cities to the north eastern region; # high-priority boxcar loads (often from freight consolidation and forwarding companies such as Acme Fast Freight) moving to and from New England, the New York City area, Philadelphia and Baltimore to Detroit, Cleveland, Chicago and St. Louis via other trains connecting with the Alpha Jet schedules; and # trailer-on-flatcar (TOFC) service, especially to and from Philadelphia but also from the New York area via the CNJ, going to or from one of the above mid-western cities. In the 1960s and early 1970s, the Alphabet Route partners promoted Alpha Jet service as an alternative to the TOFC service offered by the Pennsylvania Railroad (and then the Penn Central, after the Pennsylvania-New York Central merger in 1968) between Philadelphia and Chicago. The Pennsylvania offered 23-hour service between these points with its Truc Train runs, while the Alphabet Route partners offered 34-hour service (depending upon a prompt connection at Bellevue to the BC-1 priority freight to Chicago). Although this did not seem competitive, much of the 11-hour difference was due to departures and arrivals around midnight for the Pennsylvania service, whereas many shippers did not send and receive shipments during the night and thus could accept a mid- evening departure and a mid-morning arrival, as the Alpha Jet service could provide. Alpha Jet service was de-emphasized in the late 1970s and eventually ended by the early 1980s as the WM was fully integrated into the Chessie System (B&O; and C&O;), later to become CSX, which was and remains a major competitor of the N&W;, later Norfolk Southern. The route was formed on February 11, 1931, with the completion of the P&WV; to Connellsville, Pennsylvania, on the WM. It was an outgrowth of George J. Gould's attempts to create a transcontinental railroad and later proposals made to the Interstate Commerce Commission for a \\"Fifth System\\" to supplement the four major systems; the consolidations planned to form those systems were stopped by the Great Depression.

The Spooklight, also called the Hornet Spooklight, Hollis Light and Joplin Spook Light, is a light that appears in a small area known locally as the \\"Devil's Promenade\\" on the border between southwestern Missouri and northeastern Oklahoma west of the small town of Hornet, Missouri. Even though it is named after a small, unincorporated community in Missouri from which it is most commonly reached, the light is most commonly described as being visible from inside the Oklahoma border looking to the west. The Spooklight is commonly described as a single ball of light or a tight grouping of lights that is said to appear in the area regularly, usually at night. Although the description of the light is similar to that of other visual phenomena witnessed throughout the world, the term \\"Spooklight\\" when standing alone generally refers to this specific case. Numerous legends exist that attempt to describe the origin of the Spooklight, one of which involves the ghosts of two young Native American lovers looking for each other.  History  According to most accounts, it has appeared continually since the late 19th century,Spooklights' source is still unknown , Tulsa World, October 30, 2007 although it was generally not well known to anyone but locals until after World War II. Some date the first encounters with the light back to the Trail of Tears in the 1830s. However, the first documented sighting is generally accepted to have occurred in 1881, although some report sightings as far back as 1866. The earliest published report was in 1936 in the Kansas City Star. In 1946 the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers studied the \\"Hornet Light\\", but could not find a cause for it. In their words, it was a \\"mysterious light of unknown origin\\". Early residents of the area reported seeing lights in the woods, over their land, or even in their yards. During the 1960s, there was a general store in Hornet that gave out information about the light to sightseers. It included a \\"Spooklight Museum\\". There have also been various establishments along the Missouri- Oklahoma state line that served a similar function, but they have since closed. During the 1960s and 1970s the roads where the Spooklight usually appears were often packed with parked vehicles and people hoping to get a glimpse of the mysterious light.  Appearance  Aficionados say the best chances for spotting the light occur after dark when parked on Oklahoma East 50 Road, four miles south of the three-state junction of Kansas, Missouri and Oklahoma in Ottawa County, Oklahoma and looking to the west. One must sit very silently. The light has been seen in backyards of the area and has been spotted both near to and far away from sightseers. Its color is also not consistent: some eyewitnesses report a greenish glow while others describe it as orange, red, yellow, or even blue. It is almost always said to be in the shape of a ball, although some say it more resembles a camping lantern traveling a couple of feet off the ground.  Explanations  Explanations for the light's appearance vary widely from the extraordinary to the mundane. The area of Oklahoma in which the light is seen is very hilly and forested and out to the west of where the light is seen lies Interstate 44. It has been suggested that the headlights of cars seen over the hills explain the light's appearance, which is sometimes said to bob up and down, dance, or even split into multiple globules of light. In William Least Heat-Moon's 2008 book Roads to Quoz, the author suggests that the lights seen at the end of E 50 are explained perfectly by the fact that the road aligns directly with Route 66 across the interstate and the river valley, some ten miles distant. He also claims that earlier sightings of the light from E 40 Road, one mile to the north, are explained by an earlier alignment of Route 66 to the north of the town of Quapaw, Oklahoma, also aligned with E 40 Road. The author suggests that there are no reliable sightings of the light in any location but directly west along the road and therefore explainable by the Route 66 connection. Robert Gannon, writing for Popular Mechanics Magazine, also claims that the Spooklights are headlights from Route 66, citing a test in which he flashed his headlights on Route 66 at a certain time and the Spooklights were reported to flash as well. Other explanations for the light's appearance include atmospheric gases being affected by electrical fields. A University of Arkansas professor studied the light in the 1960s and suggested that it was from a fixed object. In 2014, professor Allen Rice, Ph.D. of the University of Central Oklahoma investigated the Spooklight with a team of investigators called the Boomers and discovered the source of the light as car headlights and taillights 9 miles west of the viewing spot. He conducted an experiment with the Boomers and was able to recreate a light with the headlights of a car from the junction of E 50 and State Highway 137, located south of Quapaw. A documentary made by the group, Into the Light: An Exploration of the Spook Light Phenomena, was released on April 3, 2015.

Professional wrestling career = Canada and early career (1981-1989) = Mike Shaw started wrestling in 1981 in Vancouver's NWA All-Star Wrestling using the ring name Klondike Mike. In 1981, he wrestled in the WWF as Mike Smith, in a losing effort against former world champion Pedro Morales on All Star Wrestling. In 1982, Shaw began wrestling under his real name for Stu Hart's Stampede Wrestling in Calgary, Alberta. In 1984, he connected with wrestler The Great Gama \\"Singh\\" and was bestowed the ring name of Makhan Singh, forming the stable \\"Karachi Vice\\" with Gama and Gary Allbright as Vokhan Singh and managed by Judah Rosenbloom and following the rebirth of Stampede Wrestling in 1985, by Abu Wizal and feuded with the likes of Owen Hart, Davey Boy Smith, Bret Hart, and Chris Benoit. = World Championship Wrestling (1989-1991) = Stampede Wrestling closed in December 1989 and just prior to the closure, he received the opportunity to join World Championship Wrestling as Norman the Lunatic. He was managed by Theodore Long, who led him around with a giant key. This key was symbolic of Long's potential to recommit Norman to the insane asylum he came from if he did not follow orders. Norman carried a teddy bear with him. Norman eventually broke away from Long, and turned face (being renamed Norman the Maniac). He feuded with Kevin Sullivan, and even received title shots against NWA World champion Ric Flair. He later adopted a trucker gimmick (\\"Trucker Norm\\"), ostensibly in memory of his late father, a long-haul truck driver. Shaw then wrestled in Memphis' USWA as Jed Grundy. = Global Wrestling Federation (1991) = In 1991, Shaw wrestled in the Global Wrestling Federation under his \\"Makhan Singh\\" gimmick, where he joined The Cartel with Cactus Jack, Rip Rogers, and Scott Anthony. = Mexico (1991-1992) = Shaw wrestled in Mexico in the 1990s as Aaron Grundy, the brother of Solomon Grundy, in EMLL and on the Mexican independent scene. Solomon Grundy was an established wrestler in the promotion and in Mexico. = World Wrestling Federation (1993-1994) = In April 1993, Shaw briefly wrestled for the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) as (alternately) The Friar and Friar Ferguson, a \\"mad monk\\". The WWF received negative feedback from the Catholic Church of New York, so they dropped the character. Shaw was then (allegedly as punishment for his weight) given the ring name Bastion Booger in June 1993, with the gimmick of an unkempt, slovenly and gluttonous man who wrestled in dingy, too-small, gray/beige singlets tailored to give him the appearance of a hunchback. Shaw's debut as Bastion Booger saw him lose to Virgil on the June 19, 1993 edition of Superstars,http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/superstars93.htm though he did win a rematch the following week. Booger achieved only marginal success, primarily serving as a jobber to the stars. Booger's biggest victory in the WWF was a clean pinfall over Owen Hart on All-American Wrestling just prior to Hart's main event push. Booger's only WWF pay-per-view appearance was at the 1993 Survivor Series, teaming with Bam Bam Bigelow and The Headshrinkers in a loss to Men on a Mission and The Bushwhackers. He feuded with Bam Bam Bigelow after \\"falling in love\\" with Bigelow's valet, Luna Vachon. While teaming with Bigelow on the January 3, 1994 episode of Monday Night Raw, Booger kissed Vachon, causing Bigelow to get angry. Booger and Bigelow faced each other the following week, and Bigelow won the match after Vachon distracted Booger by blowing him kisses. Booger was scheduled to appear in the 1994 Royal Rumble match, but was replaced; the kayfabe explanation was food poisoning. He lost his final match on WWF TV to Koko B. Ware in April 1994 and left the WWF in August 1994. = Independent circuit (1994-1999) = After leaving WWF, Shaw kept the Bastion Booger gimmick. He wrestled in the independent circuit in Michigan and Canada for Border City Wrestling. He feuded with Typhoon in 1995 in indy American promotions losing all the matches to Typhoon. On December 15, 1995 he returned to Calgary as Makhan Singh defeating the Gothic Warrior at the Stu Hart 50th Anniversary Show. Shaw retired from wrestling in 1999. = Return To WWE (2007) = On December 10, 2007 during the WWE Raw 15th anniversary special, he returned as Bastion Booger in the opening segment, in which Triple H jokingly suggested that Big Dick Johnson (another character whose unsightly physical appearance had been used by WWE for comic effect) was Booger's son. Jakks Pacific added Bastion Booger to the Classic Superstars line, series 25 in 2008. = Return to independent circuit (2006-2009) = Shaw worked for various independent promotions in his final years, and trained several wrestlers in Saginaw, MI. He returned to wrestling on June 3, 2006 losing to Danny Demanto at National Wrestling Superstars in South River, New Jersey. His final match was in Paramus, NJ on July 24, 2009 in a losing effort against Prince Akkanatan.

Company history Its general offices and factory were located at 3355 East Slauson Avenue in Vernon, an industrial area just south of downtown Los Angeles. This was an ideal location for a company that would eventually supply over 7,000 wig-wag signals to the country and the world, as it had great rail access for not only shipping its products out, but for bringing in the raw materials needed to manufacture its products. The Union Pacific's old Los Angeles and Salt Lake line to the harbor ran just east of that location, and the main lines of the Southern Pacific and Santa Fe ran by just north of there as well. This probably had a great deal to do with those three railroads being some of Magnetic Signal's biggest customers. In its heyday, Magnetic Signal not only manufactured wigwag signals, but also the alternating-flasher type TrafficLights.com railroad signals, reflectorized \\"Railroad Crossing\\"Highway Rail Crossings signs, button reflectors for highway signs, traffic island beacons, curb beacons, flasher relays, automobile and bicycle reflectors, and even a \\"Portafount\\" portable drinking fountain. The company had sales offices located in New York, Chicago, St. Louis, Salt Lake City, Seattle and Washington, D.C. Although it is known that the Signal Department of the Pacific Electric Railway developed the first wigwags in 1909, under the direction of Albert Hunt, it is not known at exactly what point the Magnetic Signal Company became a separate entity. What is known is that it soon became a subsidiary of the American Brake Shoe and Foundry Company of Los Angeles, which also owned National Bearing Metals CorporationNational Bearings Company: History and the Canadian Ramapo Iron Works. It remained a subsidiary of American Brake Shoe until it was purchased by the Griswold Signal Company of Minneapolis, Minnesota sometime in the late 1940s. At that time, the offices and factory on Slauson Avenue were closed down and relocated to Minneapolis.

History =World Wrestling Federation= In early 1990, manager Mr. Fuji split up the team known as The Powers of Pain (The Warlord and The Barbarian) as he sold their individual contracts to Slick who got the former and Bobby Heenan who received the latter, respectively. Fuji then brought in The Orient Express (Sato & Tanaka) as his latest threat to the WWF tag team division. While the Orient Express was supposed to represent Japan, Pat Tanaka was born in Hawaii. The Orient Express kicked off a prolonged feud with The Rockers (Shawn Michaels and Marty Jannetty) that started at WrestleMania VI, where Sato and Tanaka were victorious via countout after Sato threw salt in Jannetty's eyes while they were outside of the ring, and continued off and on for well over a year. The Orient Express got involved in the Legion of Doom (Animal and Hawk) / Demolition (Ax, Smash and later Crush) feud as Mr. Fuji managed Demolition as well. Demolition was being phased out and the Orient Express began taking on the Legion of Doom instead. The Legion of Doom / Orient Express feud was extremely onesided due to the Legion of Doom‚Äôs massive size advantage. After WrestleMania VI, Tanaka and Sato only made two pay-per-view appearances while in the WWF. Firstly at SummerSlam 1990 where the team were defeated by \\"Hacksaw\\" Jim Duggan and Nikolai Volkoff. They were then a part of the Sgt. Slaughter led team \\"The Mercenaries\\" (that also included Boris Zhukov. Sato was pinned by Bushwhacker Butch 1:46 into the match and Tanaka was pinned by Tito Santana only moments later, 2:13 into the match. When Akio Sato decided to leave the US wrestling scene in the latter days of 1990, the WWF decided to reunite the team known as Badd Company, only this time with Paul Diamond wearing a mask to conceal his ethnicity and using the name Kato. During this time the team had a very well received match with their old enemies the Rockers at the 1991 Royal Rumble and another well received match against The New Foundation (Jim \\"The Anvil\\" Neidhart and \\"The Rocket\\" Owen Hart) at the 1992 Royal Rumble ‚Äì which were the only two PPV appearances for the New Orient Express. Sato briefly rejoined the team in 1991 to team with Tanaka and Kato for a series of 6-man tag-team matches on WWF house shows, but Sato left the WWF after only a handful of matches together. Tanaka would leave the WWF in February 1992. Diamond went on to wrestle as a singles competitor in the WWF, first as Kato, then later as Max Moon, replacing the departed Konnan, neither gimmick meeting with very much success. =Post-WWF and split= After Paul Diamond also left the WWF, the two reunited as Badd Company, working for Eastern Championship Wrestling from late 1993 to early 1994, wrestling against the likes of The Bad Breed (Ian and Axl Rotten) and The Public Enemy, but never won the tag team titles. Pat Tanaka resurfaced in WCW during 1994 as a singles wrestler billed as \\"Tanaka-San\\". Paul Diamond showed up with the Kato mask on using the name \\"Haito\\" shortly afterwards. The two men even wrestled a couple of matches together, but they never achieved any notoriety in WCW and finally split up for good by the end of 1994. Pat Tanaka showed up in singles matches during 1996 in WCW. The two reunited in 2006 as the Orient Express on the independent circuit until 2008.

Porter was an American businessperson who, along with Bernard A. Newcomb founded the first electronic trading platform, E-Trade. After the success of E-Trade, Porter also co-founded International Securities Exchange with Marty Averbuch and became (the first) chairman of ISE on his 70th birthday in 1998. Porter was the former chief executive officer, board member, and chairman emeritus of E-Trade. In 2000, CNN called Porter the \\"forefather of online trading\\". Later in his life he donated money to businesses and nonprofits benefiting organic farming, recreation and community building on Kauai's North Shore. He died October 15, 2015 at his home in Princeville, surrounded by family and friends. Early life Porter was born and raised in Boulder, Colorado, and spent his childhood summers as a cowboy on a Colorado ranch. He quit high school to join the Navy during WWII and was expelled from the Navy when they learned he was only sixteen. Porter later put himself through college, finishing undergraduate work in three years and working nights as a crew dispatcher on the Denver and Rio Grande Railroad. According to a 2000 CNN interview, Porter attributes his self-confidence to his work as a young cowboy: As a student at Adams State College, Porter and other students would take turns visiting and reading aloud to the aged and infirmed former governor of Colorado, Billy Adams. =Education= Porter received a B.A. from Adams State College, an M.S. in Physics from Kansas State University, and a Master's degree in Management (M.B.A.) from the Sloan Fellows program at the MIT Sloan School of Management. Career =First Company= Porter started Commercial Electronics Inc. in 1968 and developed the first commercial low- light night vision for electron microscopes and the first color low-light (night vision) broadcast television camera, a technology that's used today in all broadcast cameras. Porter sold Commercial Electronics to Warner Communications after the cancellation of a large order during the 1974 recession. =Patents= Porter holds 14 patents, having developed a number of electronic devices and processes‚Äîincluding for the aforementioned \\"first\\" shoulder-mounted-backpack broadcast color TV camera, the first infrared horizon sensor for satellite stabilization (prior to Sputnik), and several other breakthroughs still in use today in a variety of fields‚Äîincluding, according to the 2000 CNN interview, devices used by the US military to this day. =The Search= Under the project name The Search, Porter developed the first electronic diesel-electric locomotive \\"checkout system,\\" whereby a testing device could be inserted into a locomotive engine. The Southern Pacific and B&O; Railroads suggested the system could improve operating capacity of the approximately 33,000 locomotive engines in the US by roughly 10 percent. =Management and Directorships= Porter has served as Chairman of Trelleborg Rubber Company, President of Tretorn Shoes, and President of Commercial Electronics Incorporated (see below). Porter was Director of Research and Planning for Textron from 1962‚Äì67, and Research Manager and Electrical Engineer of General Electric's Advanced Electronics Center at Cornell University from 1957‚Äì62. He was a physicist with the National Bureau of Standards from 1952‚Äì1957. Creation of E-Trade In 1980, in Palo Alto, Porter met Bernie Newcomb at a party. Having recently purchased an Apple II computer, Porter had the idea that a personal computer could be used to buy and sell stock. Having no means of accessing the necessary information with his modem, Porter convinced Newcomb to become his partner and together create a company that would enable any individual with a personal computer to trade stocks from their home‚Äîthereby disintermediating stock trades. Newcomb developed the programming which enabled the project to succeed. According to Porter, the first actual trade, made on July 11, 1983, was made by a dentist in Michigan. In 1992, PC Magazine featured Trade*Plus on its cover. In 1992, The San Jose Business Journal named Trade*Plus the year's fastest growing private company in Silicon Valley. In 1996, Trade*Plus was renamed E-Trade Group and went public. Newcomb retired soon after and established a philanthropic foundation, the Bernard A. Newcomb Foundation. Personal life and philanthropy Porter had three children from his first wife, Ada Guthrie, now deceased. He and his second wife Joan, who has one child from a previous marriage, had homes in Portola Valley, California and Princeville, Hawaii. Together, the Porters had ten grandchildren. Joan Porter was the founder and president of the Stillheart Institute in Woodside, CA. In 1999, Porter and his wife Joan gave $25 million to the MIT Sloan School of Management. In 2007, the Porters gave 250,000 shares of E-Trade stock to Adams State College (worth approximately $5.8 million at the time), the largest gift in school's history.

Duke Gardens consist of approximately of landscaped and wooded areas at Duke University located in Durham, North Carolina. There are of all√©es, walks, and pathways throughout the gardens. The gardens are divided into four areas, the Historic Core and Terraces, the H.L Blomquist Garden of Native Plants, the William Louis Culberson Asiatic Arboretum and the Doris Duke Center Gardens (including the Page-Rollins White Garden). The gardens are a memorial to Sarah Pearson Angier Duke, mother of Mary Duke Biddle and wife of Benjamin N. Duke, one of Duke University's benefactors.  History  In the early 1920s, Duke University's planners intended to turn the area where the Sarah P. Duke Gardens are currently located into a lake. Funds for this project ran short and the idea was subsequently abandoned. The gardens then officially began in 1934, when Dr. Frederic Moir Hanes, a faculty member at the Duke Medical School, persuaded Sarah P. Duke to give $20,000 to finance the planting of flowers in the debris-filled ravine. By 1935, over 100 flower beds consisting of 40,000 irises, 25,000 daffodils, 10,000 small bulbs and assorted annuals graced the lawns. Unfortunately, the heavy rains of that summer and the flooding stream completely washed away the original gardens. By the time Sarah. P. Duke died in 1936, the gardens were completely destroyed. Dr. Hanes was able to convince Sarah P.Duke's daughter, Mary Duke Biddle, to finance a new garden on higher ground as a memorial to her mother. Ellen Biddle Shipman, a pioneer in American landscape design, was chosen to create the new garden, known as the Terraces, in the Italianate style. They are considered by many to be her greatest work.  Trivia  The 36th line of latitude goes directly through the Duke Gardens; there is a plaque designating a spot through which the parallel runs.

He had a long career, split by World War II, and ending when he was aged 44. Washbrook, who is most famous for opening the batting for England with Len Hutton, which he did 51 times, played a total of 592 first-class cricket matches, of which 37 were Tests. Washbrook was named one of the five Wisden Cricketers of the Year in 1947. Career Washbrook was born in Barrow, Clitheroe, Lancashire. After being schooled at Bridgnorth Grammar School, aged 18, he went to Lancashire County Cricket Club, although it was not until two years later, in 1935, that he was fully established in the side, after scoring 1,724 runs and coming fifth in the national averages. He was selected to play his first Test in 1937, against New Zealand at The Oval. However, he could only make 9 and 8 not out, and was not selected for the Australian Tests the next year. The war then interrupted his career, with Washbrook becoming a physical training instructor in the Royal Air Force, and it was in the 1946‚Äì47 Ashes series that he finally took on Australia. Hutton and Washbrook made three consecutive century stands, as Washbrook, with his cricket cap cocked in a jaunty style, became a familiar figure to cricket fans in Australia and England. Washbrook was a strong leg side player, noted for his hooks and pulls, and was at his greatest in the late 1940s. He was made one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year in 1947, and was awarded a benefit by Lancashire in 1948, which raised ¬£14,000. He was an accomplished fielder at cover, and was adored by the Old Trafford faithful. During the tour of South Africa in 1948/9 Washbrook scored 542 runs in 5 Test matches, including his highest Test score of 195 made in the second Test at Johannesburg. He shared in a 359 run partnership with Hutton which was the first wicket record at the time,Test matches ‚Äì Highest partnership for the first wicket. Stats.cricinfo.com.

He was a reluctant tourist in the 1950-51 Ashes series, and was beaten many times by Australia's spinner, Jack Iverson. After the first Test of 1951 against New Zealand, he was dropped from the Test side, reputedly against the wishes of his batting partner, Hutton. His average partnership with Hutton in Tests was 60. In 1954, Washbrook was appointed Lancashire's first ever professional captain, a role he held on till 1959, when he was awarded a second benefit, which raised ¬£1,520. Washbrook was appointed a Test selector in 1956. After England had lost the Second Test against Australia at Lord's, to go one-nil down in the five match series, the 41-year-old was asked by his fellow selectors to leave the room. When he returned, they asked him if he would play in the Third Test at Headingley. Washbrook made 98, sharing a stand of 187 with Peter May, after England had been reduced to 17 for three. England won the game, and Washbrook stayed in the team, scoring just 6 in the Fourth Test at Old Trafford, in which Jim Laker took his record-breaking 19 wickets as England went two-one up. The Fifth Test at The Oval saw Washbrook's last Test innings, a duck, but with the game drawn, England had won the Ashes. From 1989 to 1990, Washbrook was president of Lancashire. He was appointed CBE in the 1991 Birthday Honours. Washbrook died in Sale, Greater Manchester, at the age of 84.

He is best known for his contemporary criticism of the ontological argument for the existence of God which appeared in St Anselm's Proslogion. In his work In Behalf of the Fool, Gaunilo contends that St Anselm's ontological argument fails because logic of the same kind would force one to conclude many things exist which certainly do not.An Introduction to the Philosophy of Religion, Michael J. Murray and Michael Cannon Rea, Cambridge University Press, 2008, pg. 126. An empiricist, Gaunilo thought that the human intellect is only able to comprehend information provided by the senses.The History of Theology: Middle Ages, Giulio D'Onofrio and Basil Studer, Liturgical Press, 2008, pg. 155. Little beyond this essay is known of Gaunilo; no other extant writings bear his name. Anselm wrote a reply to it, essentially arguing that Gaunilo had definitely missed his point. The \\"Lost Island\\" refutation Anselm claimed his ontological argument as proof of the existence of God, whom he described as that being for which no greater can be conceived. A god that does not exist cannot be that than which no greater can be conceived, as existence would make it greater. Thus, according to St. Anselm, the concept of God necessarily entails His existence. He denies Gaunilo a Godless epistemology.Anselm of Canterbury: The beauty of Theology, David S. Hogg, Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2004, pg. 104. Gaunilo criticised Anselm's argument by employing the same reasoning, via reductio ad absurdum, to \\"prove\\" the existence of the mythical \\"Lost Island\\", the greatest or most perfect island: if the island of which we are thinking does not exist, it cannot be the greatest conceivable island, for, to be the greatest conceivable island, it would have to exist, as any existent island would be greater than an imaginary one. This, of course, is merely a direct application of Anselm's own premise that existence is a perfection. Since we can conceive of this greatest or most perfect island, it must, by Anselm's way of thinking, exist. While this argument is absurd, Gaunilo claims that it is no more so than Anselm's. Anselm had no difficulty in rejecting this parody, because Gaunilo had described the Lost Island as \\"an island more excellent than any other lands\\". Anselm correctly pointed out that nowhere had he had put forward the kind of argument which Gaunilo alleged, \\"because the phrase 'greater than everything' does not have the same force for the purpose of proving that what is spoken of is in reality as [his own phrase] \\"than which a greater cannot be conceived\\" . Because Gaunilo's phrase did not contain the words \\"can be conceived\\", his counter-argument cannot generate the contradiction from which Anselm concludes that something than which a greater cannot be conceived is in reality. Philosophers often attempt to prove the ontological argument wrong by comparing Anselm's with Gaunilo's. The former runs: # God is that being than which no greater can be conceived. # It is greater to exist in reality than merely as an idea. # If God does not exist, we can conceive of an even greater being, that is one that does exist. # Therefore, God must indeed exist in reality. Gaunilo's parody runs along the same lines: # The Lost Island is that island than which no greater can be conceived. # It is greater to exist in reality than merely as an idea. # If the Lost Island does not exist, one can conceive of an even greater island, that is one that does exist. # Therefore, the Lost Island exists in reality. If one of these arguments is sound, it has been asserted, they must both be sound. By Gaunilo's reckoning, however, one (and, therefore, the other, too) is unsound. The Lost Island does not exist, so there is something wrong with the logic that proves that it does. Because the argument proves true in one case that which is patently false (the Lost Island), it is fair to ask whether it may fairly be regarded as proving true the other case. Criticisms Gaunilo's objection to the ontological argument has been criticised on several grounds. Anselm's own reply was essentially that Gaunilo had missed his point: any other being's existence is derived from God's, unnecessary in itself, and nonamenable to his ontological argument which can only ever properly apply to the single greatest being of all beings. Indeed, while we can try and conceive of a perfect island, that island is yet greater if it creates other beings, whereupon it would no longer be an island as we can understand it. Similarly, Alvin Plantinga tendered a reply to Gaunilo's remonstrance by arguing that the concept of \\"that than which nothing greater can be conceived\\" is not applicable to an island, or any other object, in the special way that it is applicable to God. Plantinga defends Anselm's proof by averring that it applies exclusively to Him. A necessary being is both existent and the greatest conceivable and greatest possible being. Only God, as Anselm defines him, meets all of those criteria and can, therefore, be dubbed a necessary being. Another criticism of Gaunilo's argument points out that, whereas God is that thing than which no greater can be conceived, Gaunilo's is that island than which no greater can be conceived. Thus, while no island may exceed it in greatness, it is perfectly reasonable to suppose that some non-island could. \\"Consequently,\\" wrote William L. Rowe in his summary of the polemic, \\"if we follow Anselm's reasoning exactly, it does not appear that we can derive an absurdity from the supposition that the island than which none greater is possible does not exist.\\"William L. Rowe: \\"The Ontological Argument\\" in Feinberg; Shafer-Landau: Reason & Responsibility, p. 15. Gaunilo's refutation is also criticized on the grounds that it misinterprets the argument set forth by Anselm. Richard Campbell contends that the argument criticized by Gaunilo is incomplete because it represents only one of three stages of a larger argument, one that is not meant to be read as a proof for God but rather as the basis for the following chapter. He argues that since Anselm himself says in Reply I that if something than which a greater cannot be thought exists, it cannot be thought not to exist, a defender of Gaunilo must allow that this island cannot be thought not to exist. But in Proslogion III Anselm deduces that God exists from the premise that \\"Whatever is other than You can be thought not to exist\\". Thus, altering Anselm's formula but adopting his premises, entails that the Lost Island both can and cannot be thought not to exist. Since that is a contradiction, it follows that it is not legitimate to alter Anselm's formula. Parallels David and Marjorie Haight took a very similar tack with Anselm's proof attempt as did Gaunilo.The Scandal of Reason: Or Shadow of God, David Frederick and Marjorie A. Haight, University Press of America, 2004 However, whereas Gaunilo changed the target noun of Anselm's proof, \\"God\\", to an alternate noun that he felt was more obviously absurd, a \\"Lost Island\\", the Haights inverted the adjective in Anselm's reasoning. Where Anselm used the word \\"greater\\" to define god into existence, the Haights point out that the logic can be inverted by replacing \\"greater\\" with \\"worse\\". The statement then follows to a conclusion that the very most bad thing has to be an existent bad thing, because it would be worse for this bad thing to exist than to not exist, therefore it must exist in its absolute badness. Therefore, the Devil must also exist, so long as Anselm's proof is held as consequential. Both Gaunilo and the Haights arguments point out that there may be other nouns, and other bivalent adjectives that when conceived as an Anselm proof (in an extreme that demands existence) could also be argued to necessitate their existence as well. For example, with cold or heat: Surely an absolutely cold (or hot) being that exists in reality is more absolutely cold (or hot) than one that only exists in imagination. Therefore, it must indeed exist in reality. And so on. The Haights show that the word \\"great\\" may not be the only adjective that pushes for existence when conceived in the extreme, just as the phrase \\"that God thing\\" may not be the only noun interacting with \\"great\\" in this way, as Gaunilo observed. The remainder of Gaunilo's text Gaunilo's treatise is divided into eight sections. The first seven of these sections are criticisms of Anselm's argument from the point of view of a rational non-believer. The last section (8) is simply praise for the remaining chapters of the Proslogion. The full title of Gaunilo's treatise is: What Someone in Behalf of the Fool Replies to these Arguments.Gaunilo's name does not appear in early manuscripts. This means Gaunilo does not write as a fellow Christian who believes, rather, he pretends to be a rational non-believer. The scholarly debate has focused on section 6 (the Lost Island Refutation). Very few scholarsSee Thomas Losoncy and recently Miroslav Imbrisevic engage with the remaining sections of Gaunilo's text.

Uaxaclajuun Ub ºaah K ºawiil (also known by the appellation \\"Thirteen Rabbit\\"), was the 13th ajaw or ruler of the powerful Maya polity associated with the site of Cop√°n in modern Honduras (its Classic Maya name was probably OxwitikStuart 1996.). He ruled from January 2, 695, to May 3, 738. History Uaxaclajuun Ub ºaah Kawiil ascended to the throne of Copan upon the death of the 12th ruler in the line of the founder, Smoke Imix, in 695. He began his reign with the construction of the Esmeralda Structure in order to entomb the remains of Smoke Imix. This ritually terminated the adjacent ancient temple of Papagayo constructed 250 years earlier by the celebrated Ruler 2, son of K ºinich Yax K ºuk º Mo º.Sharer 2006. He later constructed the original hieroglyphic stairway on the east side of the Esmeralda Structure. A passage on the stairway commemorates its construction 15 years after the death of Smoke Imix.Fash 2001. Architecture The Hieroglyphic Stairway. Based on the number of structures and monuments constructed during his reign, Uaxaclajuun Ub ºaah Kawiil is considered the greatest patron of the arts in Copan's history. This period was characterized by a deep, florid relief, which represents the culmination of the sculptural tradition of Copan. =The living mountain= The reign of Uaxaclajuun Ub ºaah Kawiil saw the construction of several structures, some of which were lost to erosion by the Copan River. The most impressive of these is Structure 10L-22, which represents a sacred man- made mountain. The inner chamber of 10L-22 was likely central in the performance of auto-sacrificial bloodletting rituals. The corners of the structure are decorated with stone masks, textually labeled as 'stone mountain'. The entrance was carved in the likeness of an arching Celestial Monster,Shele 1990. representing the mouth of a cave and a symbolic entrance into the earth. =Ballcourt= The final version of the ballcourt was dedicated by Uaxaclajuun Ub ºaah K ºawiil in AD 738.Martin & Grube 2000 The final architectural achievement of Uaxaclajuun Ub ºaah Kawiil was Ballcourt A-III. It is one of the most imposing in Mesoamerica, surpassed only by that of Chichen Itza. It is remarkable for the sloping benches used by players of the game, and by six macaw markers, the function of which is not completely resolved. Many of the stone macaws associated with the ballcourt wear the sign for darkness, akbal, on their tails. The macaw is typically symbolic of the sun, so these akbal macaws may be symbolic of sun in the Underworld. This could make the players symbolic combatants in the battle between light and dark. The inclined benches of the ballcourt are inscribed with hieroglyphic text, one of these being the commemoration date. It was dedicated in 738, only 113 days before Uaxaclajuun Ub ºaah Kawiil's death. Sculpture Between 711 and 736, Uaxaclajuun Ub ºaah Kawiil commissioned the construction of seven monuments. Stelas C, F, 4, H, A, B, and D (erected in that order) represent one of the greatest achievements in Classic Maya sculpture.Martin 2008. Each stela depicts Uaxaclajuun Ub ºaah Kawiil in ritual pose, with a two-headed centipede bar clasped to his chest. The text of Stela A proclaims that Copan ranked with three other kingdoms, Calakmul, Palenque, and Tikal, as the four great polities of the Maya World. Death and aftermath =Beheading= Uaxaclajuun Ub ºaah Kawiil was captured and beheaded by K ºak º Tiliw Chan Yopaat, ruler of the small polity of Quirigua, on May 3, 738. Quirigua was a vassal of Copan, founded by a subordinate of K ºinich Yax K ºuk º Mo º in 426. Though only about one-tenth the size of Copan, it was an important location controlling the Motagua River trade route. About 35 years into his reign, Uaxaclajuun Ub ºaah Kawiil presided over the accession of K ºak Tiliw Chan Yopaat, who was to be subject to Copan's authority. In 734 on Altar M at Quirigua, K ºak Tiliw Chan Yopaat gives himself the title k ºuhul ajaw, thus declaring Quirigua's independence from Copan. In 738, a date given conspicuous prominence in Quirigua's monuments, K ºak º Tiliw Chan Yopaat captured and beheaded Uaxaclajuun Ub ºaah Kawiil. This event is recorded on Quirigua's monuments as an 'ax event', referring to the beheading of Uaxaclajuun Ub ºaah Kawiil. The only reference at Copan is on the Hieroglyphic Stairway, recording the death of Uaxaclajuun Ub ºaah Kawiil by 'flint and shield'. There is no evidence of a large-scale battle at or around Copan during the 730's, suggesting that Uaxaclajuun Ub ºaah Kawiil was captured abroad. Stela P at Cop√°n, depicting Quirigua's K ºak º Chan Yopaat. =Political implications= It is unlikely that a polity only one-tenth the size of Copan could overthrow centuries of regional hegemony by acting alone. Stela I at Quirigua states that in 736, two years before Uaxaclajuun Ub ºaah Kawiil's defeat and two years after the inscription declaring Quirigua's independence, K ºak º Tiliw Chan Yopaat hosted a delegation from the polity of Calakmul, including its ruler Wamaw K ºawiil. This suggests that Calakmul played a role in Copan's defeat, possibly even providing the armed forces necessary to overpower a polity the size of Copan. Calakmul's possible motives include control of important trade routes, but more importantly striking a blow against its rival polity Tikal, Copan's greatest ally. =Aftermath= The effects of Uaxaclajuun Ub ºaah Kawiil's death were profound. After an era of unprecedented architectural and sculptural achievement, no new structures or monuments were erected for 18 years after Copan's defeat. K ºak º Joplaj Chan K ºawiil succeeded Uaxaclajuun Ub ºaah Kawiil as ruler of Copan, but his was likely under K ºak Tiliw Chan Yopaat's jurisdiction. Inscriptions at Quirigua name K ºak Tiliw Chan Yopaat as the 14th ruler in the line of the founder, a possible reference to him as successor of Uaxaclajuun Ub ºaah Kawiil. At the very least, the loss of the Quirigua trade routes would have meant a substantial economic and political setback.

It is generally an inexpensive lens priced at the lowest end of the manufacturer's range so as to not add much to a camera kit's price. The kit consists of the camera body, the lens, and various accessories usually necessary to get started in SLR photography. A kit lens can be sold by itself outside of a kit, particularly the ones that are moderately expensive; for instance a kit lens included in a prosumer SLR kit is often marketed as an upgrade lens for a consumer SLR. In addition, retailers often have promotions of standalone low-end SLR bodies without the lens, or a package that bundles the SLR body with one or two more expensive lenses. Originally kit lenses were of normal focal length; more recently kit lenses tend to be inexpensive zoom lenses that range from medium wide angle to mid telephoto for added versatility. Prime lenses are generally faster (smaller f-number) than comparably priced zoom lenses, so the change to zoom lenses means that recent kit lenses are usually also slower (higher f-number). However, in most cases the inclusion of an inexpensive zoom lens is to maintain a low entry price and maximize usability for the beginner photographer. More expensive camera bodies are often paired with a likewise more expensive, thus possibly faster, lens. Originally high end SLRs were always sold body-only without a lens as most buyers were experienced users who already had lenses. Today however this is not always the case and even high end SLRs can be purchased with a lens, albeit an appropriately higher-quality lens. In these cases the typically uncomplimentary term \\"kit lens' is somewhat of a misnomer. Sometimes the lens is added by the retailer at a reduced price over separate body+lens pricing.

He was a co-producer of Grease (1978) ‚Äì the soundtrack for the film Grease. Farrar also produced Newton-John's first American number-one hit single, \\"I Honestly Love You\\", which was awarded the Grammy Award for Record of the Year in 1975. In 1969, Farrar married the Australian singer, Pat Carroll ‚Äì formerly Ms. Newton-John's singing partner. In July 1970, Farrar and Carroll relocated to the United Kingdom, and starting in late 1975, they have resided in the United States. They are the parents of Sam Farrar (a Phantom Planet bassist and Maroon 5 touring member) and Max Farrar (a Golden Ghost guitarist and keyboardist). Biography John Clifford Farrar was born on 8 November 1945, and grew up in Moonee Ponds, a suburb of Melbourne. He has an older brother, Reginald, and the family lived in a large household with aunts and uncles. Farrar's mother bought him a country music guitar, which he began playing at twelve years old. In 1961, he began playing in a band, The Jaguars, with his older brother Reg. When he was fifteen , the family relocated to nearby Niddrie. In 1963, he joined The Mustangs, alongside Johnny Cooper on vocals, Peter Ramis on bass guitar and Billy on drums. In late January 1964, he joined The Strangers, replacing the founding guitarist Laurie Arthur, and adding another lead vocalist to the group. Other members were Peter Robinson on the bass guitar and lead vocals, Graeme Thompson on drums, and Fred Weiland on guitar and backing vocals. They had formed as an instrumental band in Glenroy in 1961, working in the Melbourne dance scene. In June 1964, the band issued its first vocal single, \\"If You Gotta Make a Fool of Someone\\", which reached the top 30 on the Melbourne charts in July. They became a popular backing and session band. In August 1964, The Strangers were hired as the house band for the ATV O pop music program, The Go!! Show. Both Farrar's future wife, Pat Carroll, and their close friend, Olivia Newton-John, appeared on The Go!! Show as singers backed by The Strangers. Carroll and Newton-John formed a vocal duo, \\"Pat and Olivia\\", and in 1967, they first toured the United Kingdom, including a gig at the infamous Raymond Revuebar club in Soho. After returning to Australia from a tour, Carroll was obliged to remain since her work visa had expired, while Newton-John was able to stay on due to her British origins. Farrar dated and married Carroll, and following their wedding in 1969, Carroll ceased to pursue headliner status. She occasionally reprised the duo with Newton-John, and worked as a session singer on Farrar's or Newton-John's work. During 1968, The Strangers supported the Australian leg of a tour by the British instrumental group, The Shadows. In June 1970, The Strangers released their most successful hit, \\"Melanie Makes Me Smile\\", which peaked at No. 14 on the Go-Set National Top 60 in August. In July 1970, Farrar left The Strangers, and he and Carroll moved to Britain, where he was invited to become a member of Marvin, Welch & Farrar, a vocal harmony group featuring two former members of The Shadows, Hank Marvin and Bruce Welch. By that time, Newton-John and Welch were engaged, and Farrar and Welch became two of her songwriters and producers. Welch and Farrar co-produced and performed on Newton-John's cover of Bob Dylan's track, \\"If Not for You\\", and the album of the same title released in November 1971. Farrar also worked with Cliff Richard as a backing guitarist and vocalist. Marvin, Welch & Farrar put out two albums, an eponymous one in 1971, and Second Opinion (in both quadraphonic and stereo formats) in 1972. In 1973, a third album featured just Marvin and Farrar. The Shadows reformed soon after, and Farrar joined as second lead guitarist and vocalist. In 1975, the group represented the UK in the Eurovision Song Contest with \\"Let Me Be the One\\". In 1973, Farrar had appeared at the same contest as a backing guitarist and vocalist for Richard's entry, \\"Power to All Our Friends\\"; the following year he backed and produced Newton- John on her effort, \\"Long Live Love\\". From 1971 to 1976, various members of The Shadows were employed as session musicians for Newton-John's early albums, recorded at London's Abbey Road Studios. Aside from Farrar and Welch, they included Brian Bennett, Alan Hawkshaw, Alan Tarney, Dave Richmond, and Trevor Spencer; some other session musicians were the fellow Australians Kevin Peek and Terry Britten ‚Äì both also worked with Richard ‚Äì and some other musicians. They worked under co-producers Farrar and Welch until midway through Newton- John's second album, Olivia. Thereafter, Farrar was her main producer. He produced her number-one albums, If You Love Me, Let Me Know (1974), Have You Never Been Mellow (1975), and Olivia's Greatest Hits Vol. 2 (1982). Farrar also produced Newton-John's first American number-one hit single, \\"I Honestly Love You\\", which was awarded the Grammy Award for Record of the Year in 1975. His last production for Newton-John was her album, Warm and Tender in 1989. In 1974, Farrar used the vocoder \\"SFX unit\\" on an instrumental track, \\"No, No, Nina\\", well before Peter Frampton's 1975 single, \\"Show Me the Way\\", which featured the same device for its talk box effect. However, Farrar's track was held back from release by EMI until 1997, when it appeared on the CD album, The Shadows at Abbey Road, containing mostly unreleased material. A vocal version of \\"No, No, Nina\\" appeared on the Specs Appeal album as a Eurovision contender track, but it was voted sixth out of six initial entries. Aside from instrumentation and vocals, Farrar worked as an arranger on The Shadows' albums: Rockin' with Curly Leads, Specs Appeal, Tasty and Live at the Paris Olympia. Farrar's work with Newton-John embraced a wide range of styles, from \\"You're the One That I Want\\" (duet with John Travolta) to \\"Physical\\". Farrar's biggest success with Newton-John as a writer-producer came with the film version of the musical, Grease. In 1977, during filming, its producers were replacing some of Jim Jacobs and Warren Casey's pieces from the original score and wanted some more commercial songs, including a solo number for Newton- John, so Farrar wrote and submitted two originals, \\"Hopelessly Devoted To You\\" and \\"You're the One That I Want\\". Both were accepted (despite strong reservations from director Randal Kleiser, who believed that the songs didn't fit the style),Gibb Songs 1978 and became two of the soundtrack's most successful singles, being international number-one hits during 1978. In June 2004, Farrar recalled writing the two songs: \\"'You're the One That I Want': The weird thing was it was the fastest song I ever wrote. It came so fast, the actual melody and the feel of it. 'Hopelessly Devoted To You': I spent the longest period writing the lyrics of any song I've ever written. Every thesaurus and every rhyming dictionary I had, just trying to really make it work properly\\". Other number-one hits for Newton-John that were written and produced by Farrar are \\"Have You Never Been Mellow\\" (1975), \\"Don't Stop Believin'\\" (an easy-listening chart-topper from 1976, not the Journey song of the same name), and \\"Magic\\" (1980). Farrar produced one side of the Xanadu soundtrack for the 1980 film of the same name. The other side featured tracks by Electric Light Orchestra and was produced by their guitarist-vocalist, Jeff Lynne. In March 1981, Farrar was nominated for a Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Original Song for the song \\"Suspended in Time\\" from Xanadu. In 1995, Farrar collaborated with Newton-John and lyricist Tim Rice for the musical score of Cliff Richard's musical, Heathcliff based on the Emily Bront√´ novel Wuthering Heights. Farrar also co-wrote songs for a musical based on the 1959 film, Gidget, which, , was indefinitely postponed. Farrar runs the Moonee Ponds Studio at Sweetwater Road in Malibu. =Personal life= Farrar and Carroll are the parents of Sam Farrar (born 29 June 1978, Phantom Planet bass guitarist) and Max Farrar (Golden Ghost guitarist and keyboardist). , Farrar and Carroll reside in Malibu, California. Instruments According to AllMusic John Farrar has been credited with: vocals (lead, backing), guitars (lead, rhythm, bass guitar, acoustic, slide guitar, acoustic slide, electric slide), piano (electric), keyboards, mellotron, synthesizer, vocoder, synclavier, mandolin, and horn.

Some taxonomic authorities, including the American Ornithological Society, continue to place this species in the genus Picoides. Range and habitat The ladder-backed woodpecker is fairly common in dry brushy areas and thickets and has a rather large range. The species can be found year-round over the southwestern United States (north to extreme southern Nevada and extreme southeastern Colorado), most of Mexico, and locally in Central America as far south as Nicaragua. Description The ladder-backed woodpecker is a small woodpecker about 16.5 to 19 cm (6¬Ω to 7¬Ω inches) in length. It is primarily colored black and white, with a barred pattern on its back and wings resembling the rungs of a ladder. Its rump is speckled with black, as are its cream-colored underparts on the breast and flanks. Southern populations have duskier buff breasts and distinctly smaller bills. Adult males have a red crown patch that is smaller in immatures and lacking in adult females. The ladder-backed woodpecker is very similar in appearance to Nuttall's woodpecker, but has much less black on its head and upper back, and the range of the two species only intersects a minimal amount in southern California and northern Baja California. Hybrids are known. Comparison of ladder-backed (above) and Nuttall's woodpeckers Ladder-backed woodpeckers nest in cavities excavated from tree trunks, or in more arid environments a large cactus will do. The female lays between 2 and 7 eggs, which are plain white. The eggs are incubated by both sexes, but the nesting period and other details are unknown. Like most other woodpeckers the ladder-backed woodpecker bores into tree- trunks with its chisel-like bill to hunt for insects and their larva, but it also feeds on fruit produced by cacti.

Driscoll, a Naval Flight Officer, and aircrewmate Duke Cunningham, a Naval Aviator, were their service's only aces of the Vietnam War. They remain the Navy's most recently minted aces. Driscoll received the service's second-highest decoration, the Navy Cross, for his role in a 1972 dogfight with North Vietnamese MiGs. Early life and education Driscoll was born March 5, 1947, and received a Bachelor of Arts degree in Economics from Stonehill College in North Easton, Massachusetts, in 1968, and a Master of Science degree in Systems Management from University of Southern California in 1978. Naval career In 1968, Driscoll graduated from Aviation Officer Candidate School and received his commission as an Ensign (ENS) in the Naval Reserve. After initial flight training at Naval Air Station Pensacola, Florida, he completed advanced flight training at Naval Air Station Glynco, Georgia, and received his Naval Flight Officer wings in 1970. He was assigned to the F-4 Phantom II as a Radar Intercept Officer (RIO), part of the two-man aircrews that had been developed to employ the air-to-air missiles that had become the primary weapons of aerial combat. He was assigned to Fighter Squadron 21 (VF-21) at NAS Miramar, California, for fleet replacement squadron training in the F-4J, then to Fighter Squadron 96 (VF-96) The Fighting Falcons, also based at NAS Miramar. As a lieutenant junior grade (LTJG), he served as a RIO with his primary pilot, Lieutenant Randy \\"Duke\\" Cunningham. They became the Navy's only two flying aces during the Vietnam War while VF-96 was embarked on a Western Pacific deployment aboard the aircraft carrier USS Constellation. Cunningham and Driscoll made their first two kills on separate missions. Their third, fourth, and fifth kills occurred during a single day: May 10, 1972. The engagement became one of the most celebrated aerial dogfights in the war. After they bombed their intended ground target, they engaged 16 MiG interceptors that converged on a bomber convoy of USAF Boeing B-52 Stratofortresses attacking a railyard in H·∫£i D∆∞∆°ng. Cunningham shot down two MiG-17s, and became separated from the other aircraft in their strike package. The pair headed for the coast, where they spotted and shot down a lone North Vietnamese MiG-17. Their fighter was then hit by a missile, and they ejected over the Gulf of Tonkin and were rescued. Driscoll was awarded the Navy Cross for his actions. During the war, Driscoll was promoted to lieutenant. Besides the Navy Cross, he was awarded two Silver Stars, a Purple Heart, and ten Air Medals. He was also nominated for the Medal of Honor. He flew 170 combat missions in total and accumulated over 3,300 flying hours in jet aircraft and 500 carrier landings., WillyDriscoll.com, accessed 30 November 2018 Driscoll later became an instructor at the U.S. Naval Fighter Weapons School (TOPGUN). He then shifted to the F-14 Tomcat and became an instructor at Fighter Squadron 124 (VF-124), the F-14 Fleet Replacement Squadron for the Pacific Fleet at NAS Miramar (now MCAS Miramar), in San Diego, California. He left active duty in 1982, but remained in the United States Navy Reserve, flying the F-4 Phantom II and later the F-14 Tomcat in a Naval Air Reserve fighter squadron at NAS Miramar, eventually retiring with the rank of commander (O-5). He has remained an air combat consultant at TOPGUN, and has spoken to all 107 graduating TOPGUN classes., WillyDriscoll.com, accessed 30 November 2018 Post-military career Driscoll works in real estate in San Diego, though he continues to serve as a consultant and public speaker focusing on military aviation issues.

Biography Bugaev was born in Georgia, Russian Empire into a somewhat unstable family (his father was an army doctor), and at the age of ten young Nikolai was sent to Moscow to find his own means of obtaining an education. He succeeded, graduating in 1859 from Moscow University, where he majored in mathematics and physics. He went on to study engineering, but in 1863 wrote a Master's thesis on the convergence of infinite series. This document was sufficiently impressive to win him a place studying under Karl Weierstrass and Ernst Kummer in Berlin. He also spent some time in Paris studying under Joseph Liouville. He earned his doctoral degree in 1866 and returned to Moscow, where he taught for the remainder of his career. Some of his most influential papers offered proofs of previously unproven assertions of Liouville, but his most original work centered around the development of formal analogies between arithmetic and analytic operations. Bugaev was the active member of the Moscow Mathematical Society and the president of it (1891-1903). He also wrote influential philosophical essays in which he trumpeted the virtues of mathematical analysis and decried the influence of geometry and probability. Many feel he is largely responsible for the pronounced predilection towards \\"hard analysis\\" which is characteristic of so much of the best Russian mathematics. Through Bugaev's star student, Dmitri Egorov, many famous Russian mathematicians, such as Andrei Kolmogorov and Nikolai Luzin, directly \\"descend\\" from Bugaev‚Äîand thus from the Prince of Mathematicians, Carl Friedrich Gauss. Nikolai Bugaev was also a talented chess player; some of his games are available at orangutan-people site. Bugaev was a memorable \\"character\\" whose life was touched by scandal. He was not, it is said, much admired for his looks, but his wife was brilliant, beautiful, and rich, and the Bugaevs were socially prominent. Their mathematically, musically, and artistically talented son, Boris Nikolaevich Bugaev (14 October 1880 O.S.-8 January 1934), went on to adopt the pseudonym Andrei Bely, under which name he helped found the Symbolist movement. Professor Korobkin, the main character of Bely's innovative novel Moscow, was inspired by Nikolay Bugayev. In view of his father's prejudices, Boris Bugaev was fascinated by probability and particularly by the notion of entropy, which is mentioned in several of his novels and poems.

Jonathan served under his brother and took active parts in the battles against the Seleucid forces. His reputation for courage is lesser to that of Judas but hardly questionable. His courage had been frequently tried. Judas fell in the Battle of Elasa (161/160 BCE) against Bacchides, a Seleucid general under Demetrius I Soter. Bacchides proceeded with crushing rigor against the Maccabean party while at the same time a famine broke out in the land. The Jewish rebels required a new leader and Jonathan was chosen. Jonathan noticed that Bacchides was trying to entrap him. He reacted by retiring with his brothers Simeon and John, and his followers to a desert region in the country east of the Jordan River. They set camp near a morass by the name of Asphar. But Bacchides followed him there and overtook them during a Sabbath. Jonathan gave all the baggage into the hands of his brother John who took a small force and headed towards the friendly Nabataeans. The plan was to secure their baggage there but the \\"sons of Jambri of Medeba\\", a hostile tribe apparently, ambushed them during their journey. John and his companions were killed and their cargo was looted.I Macc. 9.32-36; Josephus, Antiquities of the Jews 13.1.2 Subsequently, Jonathan was informed that one of the sons of Jambri was leading home a noble bride in great pomp, the Maccabean brothers proceeded to Medaba, ambushed the bridal procession, killed the entire party, to the number of 300, and seized all the treasure.I Macc. 9.37-49 places this before the battle with Bacchides; Josephus, 13.1.4 places it after. Jonathan and his companions met Bacchides in battle at the River Jordan. Jonathan had encountered and had raised his hand to slay Bacchides, when the latter evaded the blow; the Jews, defeated, sought refuge by swimming through the Jordan to the eastern bank. In this battle Bacchides is reported to have lost either 1,000 or 2,000 men and he did not make another attempt to cross the river, instead returning to Jerusalem. Jonathan and his forces remained in the swamp in the country east of the Jordan.I Macc. 9.43-53; Josephus Antiquities of the Jews 13.1.3 Following the death of Alcimus, High Priest in Jerusalem sometime later, Bacchides left the country.I Macc. 9.54-57  Turn of fate  However Jonathan was not idle. He continued activities against the Jews influenced by the Hellenistic civilization. Two years after the departure of Bacchides from Judea, Acra felt sufficiently threatened to contact Demetrius and request the return of Bacchides to their territory. Jonathan was now more experienced in guerrilla warfare, the primary tactic used by the Maccabean forces, and was constantly on guard to avoid direct confrontations with enemy forces even while continuing hostile operations. A frustrated Bacchides reportedly took out his anger on the Hellenists and reportedly killed fifty of their leaders out of frustration. Jonathan and Simeon thought it well to retreat farther, and accordingly fortified in the desert a place called Beth-hogla;(\\"Bet ·∏§oglah\\" for ŒíŒ∑œëŒ±ŒªŒ±Œ≥Œ¨ in Josephus; I Macc. has ŒíŒ±ŒπŒ¥Œ≤Œ±œÉ·Ω∂, perhaps = Bet Bosem or Bet Bassim [\\"spice-house\\"], near Jericho or Beth-basi (ŒíŒ±ŒπŒ∏Œ≤Œ±œÉŒØ - 1 Maccabees 9:62, 64) meaning \\"house of marshes.\\" Per https://www.biblicaltraining.org/library/bethbasi \\"According to G. A. Smith there is a Wady el-Bassah East of Tekoa in the wilderness of Judea. The name means \\"marsh,\\" which Dr. Smith thinks impossible, and really 'an echo of an ancient name.'\\" - See more at: http://www.biblicalcyclopedia.com/B/bethbasi.html ) there they were besieged several days by Bacchides. Jonathan perceived that Bacchides regretted having set out. He contacted the rival general with offers of a peace treaty and exchange of prisoners of war. Bacchides readily consented and even took an oath of nevermore making war upon Jonathan. He and his forces then vacated Judea. The victorious Jonathan now took up his residence in the old city of Michmash. From there he endeavored to clear the land of \\"the godless and the apostate\\".I Macc. ix. 55-73; Josephus, l.c. xiii. 1, ¬ß¬ß 5-6). The chief source, the First Book of the Maccabees, says that with this \\"the sword ceased in Israel\\"; and in fact nothing is reported for the five following years (158 - 153 BCE  High Priest Jonathan must have used this peaceful period to good advantage, for he was soon in possession of great power. An important external event brought the design of the Maccabeans to fruition. Demetrius I Soter's relations with Attalus II Philadelphus of Pergamon (reigned 159 - 138 BCE), Ptolemy VI of Egypt (reigned 163 - 145 BCE) and his co-ruler Cleopatra II of Egypt were deteriorating. They supported rival claimant to the throne Alexander Balas against him who claimed to be the son of Antiochus IV Epiphanes and a first cousin of Demetrius. Demetrius was now forced to recall the garrisons of Judea, except those at Jerusalem's Akra fortress and at Beth- zur; he also made a bid for the loyalty of Jonathan, whom he permitted to recruit an army and to take the hostages kept in the Akra fortress. Jonathan gladly accepted these terms and took up residence at Jerusalem in 153 BCE. He soon began fortifying the city. Alexander Balas also contacted Jonathan with even more favorable terms. Including official appointment as High Priest in Jerusalem. Withdrawing his support from Demetrius and declaring allegiance to Alexander, Jonathan was the first member of his dynasty to achieve appointment as High Priest. The title was not merely nominal. Jonathan became the official leader of his people and the Hellenistic party could no longer attack him without severe consequences. On the Feast of Tabernacles of 153 BCE, Jonathan put on the High Priest's garments and officiated for the first time. It is unknown whom Jonathan displaced as High Priest, though some scholars suggest that this was the Teacher of Righteousness, later founder of the Essenes. In this theory, Jonathan is considered the \\"Wicked Priest\\".van der Water, 2003, p. 397. Jonathan had determined to side with Alexander Balas, not trusting Demetrius, who in a second letter made promises that he could hardly have kept and conceded prerogatives that were almost impossible.I Macc. x. 1-46; Josephus, \\"Ant.\\" xiii. 2, ¬ß¬ß 1-4 Demetrius subsequently lost his throne and life in 150 BCE. Alexander Balas was victorious and sole ruler of the Seleucid Empire. He was given the further honor of marriage to Cleopatra Thea, daughter of his allies Ptolemy VI and Cleopatra II. The wedding took place in Ptolemais in the presence of Ptolemy VI. Jonathan was invited but arrived after the wedding ceremony while celebrations continued. He appeared with presents for both kings, and was permitted to sit between them as their equal; Balas even clothed him with his own royal garment and otherwise accorded him high honor. He would not listen to the Hellenistic party that still accused Jonathan, but appointed Jonathan as strategos and \\"meridarch\\" (i.e., civil governor of a province; details not found in Josephus), and sent him back with honors to Jerusalem.I Macc. x. 51-66; Josephus, \\"Ant.\\" xiii. 4, ¬ß 1 Victory over Apollonius Jonathan destroying the temple of Dagon, by Gustave Dor√© Jonathan proved grateful. In 147 BCE, Demetrius II Nicator, a son of Demetrius I Soter, started claiming the throne against Alexander Balas. Apollonius Taos, governor of Coele-Syria was probably supporting Demetrius. But he used the opportunity to challenge Jonathan to battle, saying that the Jews might for once leave the mountains and venture out into the plain. Jonathan and Simeon led a force of 10,000 men against Jaffa where the forces of Apollonius lay. Not expecting an attack this early in the hostilities, Jaffa was not prepared for a siege. The gates of which were opened before the Jewish forces out of fear. But the victory was not yet certain. Apollonius received reinforcements from Azotus and appeared in the plain in charge of 3,000 men. They were clearly outnumbered but Apollonius was relying on his superior cavalry and forced Jonathan to engage in battle. Jonathan assaulted, captured and burned Azotus along with the resident temple of Dagon and the surrounding villages. In reward of his victory, Alexander Balas granted the victorious High Priest the city of Ekron along with its outlying territory. The people of Azotus vainly complained to King Ptolemy VI, who had come to make war upon his son-in-law Alexander Balas, that Jonathan had destroyed their city and temple. Jonathan peacefully met Ptolemy at Jaffa and accompanied him as far as the River Eleutherus. He then returned to Jerusalem, maintaining peace with the King of Egypt despite their support for different contenders for the Seleucid throne.I Macc. x. 67-89, xi. 1-7; Josephus, l.c. xiii. 4, ¬ß¬ß 3-5 Under Demetrius II In 145 BCE, the Battle of Antioch resulted in the final defeat of Alexander Balas by the forces of his father-in-law Ptolemy VI. Ptolemy himself was however among the casualties of the battle. Demetrius II Nicator remained sole ruler of the Seleucid Empire and became the second husband of Cleopatra Thea. Jonathan owed no allegiance to the new King and took this opportunity to lay siege to the Seleucid fortress in Jerusalem and the symbol of Seleucid control over Judea. it was heavily garrisoned by a Seleucid force and offered asylum to Jewish Hellenists.I Macc. 11.20; Josephus, Antiquities of the Jews 13.4.9 Demetrius was very angry; he appeared with an army at Ptolemais and ordered Jonathan to come before him. Without raising the siege Jonathan, accompanied by the elders and priests, went to the king, and pacified him with presents, so that the king not only confirmed him in his office of high priest, but gave to him the three Samaritan toparchies of Mount Ephraim, Lod, and Ramathaim- Zophim. In return for a present of 300 talents the entire country was exempted from taxes, the exemption being confirmed in a letter which is preserved by I Maccabees and Josephus.I Macc. 11.30-11.37; Josephus, Antiquities of the Jews 13.4.9 Soon however, a new claimant to the Seleucid throne appeared in the person of the young Antiochus VI Dionysus, son of Alexander Balas and Cleopatra Thea. He was three years old at most but general Diodotus Tryphon used him to advance his own designs on the throne. In face of this new enemy, Demetrius not only promised to withdraw the garrison from Jerusalem, but also called Jonathan his ally and requested him to send troops. 3,000 of Jonathan's men protected Demetrius in his capital, Antioch, against his own subjects.I Macc. 11.21-52; Josephus, Antiquities of the Jews 13.4.9; 13.5.2-3; \\"R. E. J.\\" 45.34 Support for Tryphon As Demetrius II did not keep his promise, Jonathan thought it better to support the new king when Diodotus Tryphon and Antiochus VI seized the capital. The latter confirmed all his rights and appointed his brother Simeon strategos of the seacoast, from the \\"Ladder of Tyre\\" to the frontier of Egypt. Jonathan and Simeon toured the region removing Demetrius II's garrisons; Ashkelon submitted voluntarily while Gaza was forcibly taken. Jonathan defeated a force of Demetrius II which invaded from the north, in the plain of Hazar, and drove them back over the Eleutherius River. Meanwhile, Simeon took the strong fortress of Beth Zur and replaced Demetrius II's garrison with his own.I Macc. 11.53-74; Josephus, Antiquities of the Jews 13.5.3-7 The sources report that Jonathan sought alliances with foreign peoples at this time. He renewed the treaty with the Roman Republic, and exchanged friendly messages with Sparta and other places.I Macc. 12.1-12.23 Capture by Diodotus Tryphon and death In 143 BCE, Diodotus Tryphon went with an army to Judea and invited Jonathan to Scythopolis for a friendly conference, and persuaded him to dismiss his army of 40,000 men, promising to give him Ptolemais and other fortresses. Jonathan fell into the trap; he took with him to Ptolemais 1,000 men, all of whom were slain; he himself was taken prisoner.I Macc. 12.33-38, 41-53; Josephus, Antiquities of the Jews 13.5.10; 13.6.1-3 When Diodotus Tryphon was about to enter Judea at Hadid, he was confronted by the new Jewish leader, Simon Thassi, ready for battle. Tryphon, avoiding an engagement, demanded one hundred talents and Jonathan's two sons as hostages, in return for which he promised to liberate Jonathan. Although Simon did not trust Tryphon, he complied with the request in order that he might not be accused of the death of his brother. But Tryphon did not liberate his prisoner; angry that Simon blocked his way everywhere and that he could accomplish nothing, he executed Jonathan at Baskama, in the country east of the Jordan.I Macc. 13.12-30; Josephus, Antiquities of the Jews 13.6.5 Jonathan was buried by Simon at Modi'in. Nothing is known of his two captive sons.

Storyeum was located in the largely touristy area of the Gastown neighbourhood of Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Storyeum offered up a live, interactive, educational, re-creation of British Columbia's history through special effects, actors and actresses in a 65-minute show. Storyeum, in the wake of diminishing profits and revenue, ran its last show on October 17, 2006 and has since ceased daily operations. The City of Vancouver continued as the property landlord and occasionally rented parts of the space for events such as Vancouver Fashion Week, the Juno Awards After Party, Vancouver Film School projects, and entertainment and cultural celebrations. The space sits underneath the Woodward's parkade and with the City's largest revitalization project underway across the street, the Storyeum site has been divided into two retail spaces. At 142 Water Street a German/Iranian furniture store now occupies , and at 151 West Cordova Street, W2 Community Media Arts is operating Storyeum as a conference and festival venue, titled W2 Storyeum. Whereas the venue previously housed heritage displays and gift shops aimed at tourists, it now plays host to a community media lab, cafe, art studio, exhibition space, offices, and community meeting room. Excalibur Entertainment (of Surrey, BC) proposed to turn the basement into a 40+ lane bowling alley but their business model was incumbent upon securing a ground floor liquor permit. This combination made the idea unlikely to occur with the new Woodward's across the street that has a 150-seat restaurant and bar. Creditors went through the approximately basement in 2006 for auctionable value. The space is currently being used by Vancouver Film School for student and small production sets, including green screens and one-take live action shots.  History  Storyeum's main entrance as seen from Vancouver Gastown's Water Street The Storyeum concept was officially conceived in 2000 by its founder Danny Guillaume and architect Al Waisman. To help fulfill their concept, they founded Historical Xperiences Inc. (HXP) to create and manage Storyeum. Storyeum officially opened in June 2004. Many local businessmen and the City of Vancouver invested over CAD $22 million into the concept, but not enough people visited the attraction, and Mr. Guillaume owed his creditors over CAD $6 million when Storyeum closed.Vancouver's Storyeum granted protection from creditors  Facts  * Storyeum was bigger than six NHL regulation size ice rinks, . * Storyeum was one of the biggest tourist attractions built since EXPO 86. * The passenger lifts used in the first and last set were some of the world's biggest. * The passenger lifts were capable of transporting 200 people or 25,000 pounds. * Storyeum's replica locomotive in Set No. 7 was an exact replica of the Canadian Pacific Railway Locomotive#374, the first to pull passenger cars across Canada. * Storyeum initially was a CAD $22 million private investment project and was built in 6 months.  The show  The theatrical adventure predominantly took place under the streets of Gastown. The entire show duration was approximately 65 minutes. Storyeum broke from the traditional performance/play by making guests move from set to set. In total, there were eight sets, including the 360 degree visual demonstrations in the two passenger lifts. The Storyeum experience started when guests entered the first passenger lift to descend below the grounds of Gastown. Upon descent, they were guided from set to set. The sets are, in order of appearance: # GOING UNDERGROUND ‚Äî introductory visual presentation into Canada and Vancouver's values and brief overlook into pivotal moments of Canadian history. Moments include Terry Fox run, EXPO 86, Men's and Women's Hockey Team Canada winning Olympic Gold Medals in Salt Lake City, U.S., Vancouver being awarded the rights to host the 2010 Winter Olympics, etc. Brief safety and courtesy guidelines are also presented. # ANCIENT TRAILS ‚Äî first of the real sets involving British Columbia's story with real actors/actresses, sets and special effects. Guests experience the retelling of the creation of man, from wolf, and woman, from bottom of the sea sediments, through the point of view of the British Columbia Tsleil-Waututh native people in a rainforest-like setting; presumably being British Columbia's coastal temperate forests. # THE BIG HOUSE ‚Äî Guests here experience the love story of the first descendants of the man and woman created in the second set. Taking place over many years, the story marks the finish of the Great Circle of Life. # NEW ARRIVALS ‚Äî there are two versions of this set that is alternated between seasons. However, the set story remains to be the same, only the physical point of view is alternated between. One version gives the guest a vantage point of looking at a ship while it is coming into harbour in a first contact type scenario between Europeans and the indigenous people. The second version is from the vantage points of actually being on the ship as it comes into harbour during a similar first contact type scenario. In this set, guests are told of the establishment of the Hudson's Bay Company of Canada. There is also mention of fur trading, introduction of small pox, and long distance relationships between sailors and their loved ones in Europe. During special holidays such as British Columbia's Victoria Day, other issues presented in a satirical yet educational atmosphere include addressing present-day Canadian and American differential sentiments and the use of the 49th parallel to set much of the border between the United States of America and Canada. # GOLD SEEKERS ‚Äî taking place circa 1862 in Barkerville, British Columbia, covers the Gold Rush of the Pacific North-West particularly its role in British Columbia. Other issues covered include: the Royal Decree to unite and confederate Canada, the Barkerville fire, law and order issues in the remote vastness of British Columbia, and the low female to male ratio. # NATIONAL DREAM ‚Äî In this set, guests experience the unification of Canada by a national rail line spanning the nation from coast to coast. Other issues presented include the Women's Suffrage in Canada, the role of the Chinese in building the railway, and the Chinese Head Tax. # LAST STOP ‚Äî This set's story takes place at a railway station. The set is presumably set in Vancouver because of a replica Gastown Steam clock present on set. In this part of the experience, circa 1944, guests see a Canadian soldier, waiting at the station to depart for reconstruction efforts in Italy, with a wife waiting for her husband, who is a Canadian Forces soldier, return from fighting in Europe. As the show progresses, a replica Canadian Pacific Railway locomotive steams into the station with the husband. The set ends with a grand musical performance with underlying feelings of promoting multiculturalism and acceptance. This set marks the end of the experience with real actors/actresses, sets, and special effects. # BC SPIRIT ‚Äî In this last set, guests enter a passenger lift to return to street level. During the ascent, a visual mosaic of individuality and society cohesiveness is celebrated. The end of the presentation officially marks the end of the Storyeum experience.

It is situated along Bedok North Interchange and Bedok North Drive, on the second level of Bedok Mall. It is connected to Bedok MRT station. It is the 2nd busiest bus interchange in Singapore, with 39 bus services operating from it. History The original facility opened on 25 February 1979. It was the first interchange in Singapore to use a colour-coded queue scheme. Soon after it opened, in 1981, the interchange was partially demolished and expanded at a cost of S$3 million, and work was completed in 1983. After the expansion, the interchange covered ands had 32 end-on berths, 7 sawtooth berths and 33 remote parking bays. Several bus services were moved to the interchange from Chai Chee Bus Terminal when the terminal closed in 1985. Bedok MRT station opened in 1989 at the south of the original facility, complementing the bus interchange to serve people travelling within Bedok town and also the nearby East Coast Park. In the 2003 URA Masterplan, it was indicated that the bus interchange would be redeveloped. This was confirmed in early 2011 when HDB announced plans to rejuvenate Bedok, which involved redeveloping the Bedok town centre and rebuilding the original facility into an air-conditioned one, integrated with a proposed commercial development (Bedok Mall) and proposed residential development (Bedok Residences), resembling Boon Lay Bus Interchange. The original facility has been completely demolished. On 19 November 2011, after operating from the original facility for 32 years, the bus interchange moved to its temporary facility along Bedok North Drive to allow the original facility to be rebuilt as planned. With the opening of the temporary facility, some amendments were made to three services, Service 9, 18 and 35. The new Bedok Integrated Transport Hub (ITH) began operations on 30 November 2014. With the completion of the ITH, Bedok residents are able to transfer in air-conditioned comfort between bus and MRT services at Bedok MRT station. It is the 7th air-conditioned bus interchange in Singapore. Bus Contracting Model Under the new bus contracting model, all the bus routes were split into 10 route packages, the most for a single interchange in Singapore shared with Marina Centre Bus Terminal - 854 under Sembawang-Yishun, 66 under Bulim, 17 under Loyang, 26 and 155 under Bishan-Toa Payoh, 7, 32, 33 and 197 under Clementi, 18, 38 and 69 under Tampines, 16 under Bukit Merah, 87 under Sengkang-Hougang, 60 under Serangoon-Eunos and the rest under Bedok Bus Packages. It is the only bus interchange in Singapore that has services run by all 4 major bus operators of Singapore (till 5 September 2021, when Bus Service 854 will be managed by Tower Transit) .

Located in Trois-Rivi√®res, Quebec, Canada, it is, within the unique Quebec education system, a secondary school. Historically religious, it is now relatively secular but still holds many links with the religious and its community. History The roots of the S√©minaire are found in 1860, when was founded the Coll√®ge des Trois-Rivi√®res. Saint Joseph was then chosen as patron saint and Religion et Patrie (or Religioni et Patriae, referring to the Christian faith and the Quebec homeland) as motto. In 1874, the college is given to the care of the Trois- Rivi√®res diocese. The latter makes it then its own diocese seminary and bestows upon it the denomination of S√©minaire Saint-Joseph des Trois-Rivi√®res. The old tradition of calling the city les Trois-Rivi√®res (plural grammatical inflection) now being obsolete, S√©minaire Saint-Joseph de Trois-Rivi√®res is now the proper way to call the institution. The STR offered the classical course of the former Quebec educational system until the end of the 1967‚Äì1968 scholar year. It officially became a secondary school in September 1968. It became a co-education school in 1998 while, as a boarding school, continuing to provide dormitory residence to male students. Architecture The current massive building that houses the institution was built in 1929 and constitutes an example of pure neoclassical architecture. A new house for the seminary was made necessary by the destruction by fire of the former building in the same year, on the same present estate of the Laviolette Boulevard. The modern building was actually built around the chapel it now harbours. The structure is mainly consisted of grey Quebec Beauce granite. The high and impressive facade is dominated by a large dome of bronze. The large main doors were designed by the French ironwork artist that created the Monument of the Flame beneath the Arc de Triomphe of Paris. Like the school arms, the doors display symbols of the Christian religion and of Quebec, an embodiment of the motto \\"Religion et patrie\\". The presence, above the door, of a Saint Joseph statue and a mast displaying the flag of Quebec also underlines the motto of the school. Mus√©e Pierre Boucher The main exposition areas of the Mus√©e Pierre Boucher are found at the very main central entrance of the building. The museum preserves 7,500 works of art of all eras, paintings, drawings, prints, sculptures and fine arts, as well as 13,000 artifacts illustrating the religious history of the diocese, of the city and the region and the life and customs of the 19th and 20th century. The Museum is affiliated with: CMA, CHIN and Virtual Museum of Canada. It is named after Pierre Boucher, an early Canadian settler who studied under and worked with the Jesuit missions in Georgian Bay. Boucher was twice governor of Trois Rivieres, and the first Canadian settler to be ennobled under King Louis XIV. Archives The S√©minare houses a major service of historical archives, an important gateway to Trois-Rivi√®res and Mauricie history. The Service des archives du S√©minaire de Trois-Rivi√®res (ASTR) traces its own origins to 1918, when the authorities of the seminary asked a young priest, Abbot Albert Tessier, to act as archivist. Since 1929, the mandate of the archives center was broadened to the preservation and diffusion of more than 760 collections of private archives from individuals, families and organizations of the surrounding region. These documents include correspondence, photographs, postal cards and historical notes. They are accessible for free to all citizens. Further information It is known under more than one name: the \\"S√©minaire Saint-Joseph\\", the \\"S√©minaire de Trois-Rivi√®res\\" and, simply, the \\"STR\\". It not only houses the Archives and the Museum, but also a chapel, and a full wing of living quarters for the religious community. It is also well known for setting up a yearly musical school play of professional scope. Its students are colloquially and affectionately known as les suisses, a reference to the stripes of a former school uniform that made the wearer resemble a chipmunk, or un suisse in Quebec French (notably). Coincidentally, the name suisse was given to the chipmunk (or tamia in international normative French) because of clothing, more specifically because of the striped cloth of the Vatican Swiss Guard.:fr:Tamia Notable alumni *Richard B√©liveau - Cancer prevention researcher *Jean Chr√©tien - 20th Prime Minister of Canada *Maurice Duplessis - 16th Premier of Quebec *Ga√©tan Frigon - Entrepreneur and TV personality *G√©rald Gagnier - bandmaster, composer, and trumpeter *G√©rald Godin - Poet and Parti Qu√©b√©cois MNA *Fran√ßois Massicotte - Humorist *Laurent Poliquin - Poet *Denis Villeneuve - Film director See also *Trois-Rivi√®res *Mauricie *Education in Quebec References *L'historique du STR *Archives of the S√©minaire de Trois-Rivi√®res External links * *Virtual visit of the building *Mus√©e Pierre Boucher - official site *Mus√©e Pierre Boucher - partner site at S√©minaire Saint-Joseph de Trois-Rivi√®res Category:High schools in Quebec Category:Art museums and galleries in Quebec Category:Private schools in Quebec Category:Schools in Trois-Rivi√®res Category:Tourist attractions in Mauricie Category:Museums in Mauricie Category:1860 establishments in Canada ","title":"S√©minaire Saint-Joseph de Trois-Rivi√®res"},{"id":"2443188","text":"Azeem Ahmed Tariq () (died 1 May 1993) was a Pakistani politician who was the Chairman of the MQM (Muhajir Qaumi Movement).

That particular stage, doing the Reading Festival, was a definite wrong for us.\\"Tommy Vance's Friday Rock Show, BBC Radio 1, 28 June 1992, transcribed in Sabbath fanzine Southern Cross #14, October 1994, p40 Bevan rejoined Black Sabbath briefly in 1987, recording percussion overdubs for album The Eternal Idol, but was replaced by Terry Chimes after refusing to play shows in South Africa, at the time under apartheid rule. After the death of Carl Wayne in 2004, the drummer formed Bev Bevan's Move with Phil Tree and former ELO Part II colleagues Phil Bates and Neil Lockwood, to play a set comprising mostly The Move classics on tour. Bates left in July 2007 to re- join ELO Part II, by then renamed to The Orchestra. Bevan was then joined by former Move guitarist Trevor Burton. Bevan appeared on Paul Weller's 2010 album Wake Up The Nation and played drums on two songs: \\"Moonshine\\" and \\"Wake Up The Nation\\". Weller told him that he was his second choice; his first choice would have been Keith Moon. Bevan currently presents a radio show on BBC Radio West Midlands on Sunday afternoons. He also reviews records for the Midlands' Sunday Mercury and has a blog on their website. It was announced at the Best of Broad Street Awards on 17 January 2011 that Bevan would be honoured with a star on the Birmingham Walk of Stars. Bevan is also a patron of The Dorridge Music School (Knowle). In 2012, Bevan narrated the audiobook version of Tony Iommi's biography Iron Man ‚Äì My Journey Through Heaven and Hell. Bevan's 2014 calendar contained no fewer than 102 gigs in 11 months, some of which formed the final gigs for The Move, before Bevan and Burton went their separate ways again. Since 2017, The Bev Bevan Band has played gigs with Bev's former school mate Jasper Carrott under the name Stand up and Rock. Personal life He is a follower of Wolverhampton Wanderers FC.

He is best known as a member of the 1960s avant-garde jazz scene in New York City, playing alongside musicians such as John Coltrane, Archie Shepp, and John Tchicai. He performed on Coltrane's landmark 1965 album Ascension. Allmusic reviewer Scott Yanow called him \\"one of the brightest and most lyrical voices of the 1960s avant-garde.\\" Biography Brown, the grandson of an escaped slave from Georgia's Sea Islands, was born in Atlanta in 1931 and was raised by a single mother. He began studying the saxophone at an early age, inspired by Charlie Parker. He left high school in the 10th grade and joined the army. During his three-year enlistment, he played alto saxophone, clarinet, and baritone saxophone, and was stationed in Hokkaido for some time. In 1956, he returned to Atlanta and enrolled at Clark College, where he studied music, taking lessons from Wayman Carver. After graduating, he moved to Washington, DC, where he enrolled at Howard University's law school. During this time, he began listening to musicians such as John Coltrane, Ornette Coleman, and Archie Shepp, all of whom he would soon meet and come to know. In 1962, Brown left Howard and moved to New York City, where he befriended a number of musicians, as well as writers such as Amiri Baraka (then known as LeRoi Jones), who was also a Howard drop-out, and A. B. Spellman, a Howard graduate. According to Brown, \\"The writers who listened to me and liked my playing, they inspired me to be better, and I inspired them to keep listening. LeRoi Jones opened the door for me; he introduced me to the world. He was a very beautiful and very smart person.\\" He also met Ornette Coleman and Archie Shepp, and introduced Shepp to Baraka. Brown recalled that Shepp \\"offered me the opportunity to play with him. But I didn't have a saxophone, so Ornette Coleman let me use his white plastic saxophone to get started.\\" According to writer Aldon Lynn Nielsen, Brown's \\"conversations with Baraka and Shepp aided them in their thinking through of the relationships between the American jazz avant-garde and African musical traditions.\\" Brown later played a minor acting role in the original production of Baraka's Dutchman. In 1964, Brown performed with Shepp and Bill Dixon in Four Days in December, a series sponsored by the Jazz Composers Guild. The following year, he participated in the recording of Shepp's Fire Music as well as John Coltrane's Ascension. According to Brown, he was introduced to Coltrane by Shepp: \\"Archie told him about my music and he started to listen to it and he liked it. And then, several times, he would come to hear me play and he liked that. So when he decided to do Ascension, I fit the picture of somebody that he wanted in it.\\" Regarding the music on Ascension, Brown stated: \\"You could use this record to heat up your apartment on a cold morning.\\" Regarding the recording session, he recalled: \\"We did two takes, and they both had that kind of thing in them that makes people scream. The people who were in the studio were screaming. I don't know how the engineers kept the screams out of the record. Spontaneity was the thing. Trane had obviously thought a lot about what he wanted to do, but he wrote most of it out in the studio. Then he told everybody what he wanted: he played this line and he said that everybody would play that line in the ensembles. Then he said he wanted crescendi until we were together, and then we got into it.\\" During the mid-1960s, Brown began recording under his own name (Marion Brown Quartet, recorded in 1965 and released on ESP in 1966; Juba-Lee, recorded in 1966 and released on Fontana in 1967; Why Not, recorded in 1966 and released on ESP in 1968; and Three for Shepp, recorded and released in 1966 on Impulse!). (Coltrane had used his influence at Impulse! to help Brown secure his own recording date with that label.) Brown also performed with Sun Ra and Pharoah Sanders, and recorded with Burton Greene on the album Burton Greene Quartet. In 1967, Brown moved to Europe, where he continued performing and recording, and where he developed an interest in architecture, Impressionistic art, African music and the music of Erik Satie. He was an American Fellow in Music Composition and Performance at the Cit√© internationale des arts in Paris. Late that year, while in Holland, he recorded Porto Novo with Han Bennink and Maarten Altena. While in Europe, Brown met and befriended Gunter Hampel, and in 1968 they recorded the soundtrack for Marcel Camus' film Le temps fou, with a band featuring Steve McCall, Barre Phillips, and Ambrose Jackson. Brown and Hampel went on to record two more albums, Gespr√§chsfetzen (recorded in 1968) and Marion Brown In Sommerhausen, recorded in 1969. While in Europe, Brown also performed in duos with Leo Smith, recording Creative Improvisation Ensemble. In 1970, Brown returned to the United States, settling in Connecticut, where he at first worked in elementary schools, \\"teaching children how to make instruments and create their own music,\\" and where he continued his musical partnership with Leo Smith. He composed and performed incidental music for a Georg B√ºchner play, Woyzeck. From 1971 to 1976, he worked in a variety of teaching positions at Bowdoin College, Brandeis University, Colby College, and Amherst College, and in 1976 he earned a Masters degree in ethnomusicology from Wesleyan University. His master's thesis was entitled \\"Faces and Places: The Music and Travels of a Contemporary Jazz Musician\\". During this time, he also studied South Indian flute with P. Vishwanathan. In the early 1970s, Brown also recorded a trilogy of albums influenced by poet Jean Toomer, reflecting on his southern upbringing, in which \\"images of the Georgia countryside, many of them drawn from Toomer's poetry, and improvisational techniques of African, AfroAmerican, and European provenance enrich and revivify one another:\\" Afternoon of a Georgia Faun (1970, ECM), which featured Anthony Braxton, Bennie Maupin, Jeanne Lee, Chick Corea, and Andrew Cyrille among others; Geechee Recollections (1973, Impulse!), which featured Leo Smith and Steve McCall among others; and Sweet Earth Flying (1974, Impulse!, named after a line in a Toomer poem), which featured Muhal Richard Abrams and Steve McCall among others. Reviewer Robert Palmer wrote: \\"The trilogy as a whole is an exemplary demonstration of how... a thoughtful artist can explore a 'subject' through a variety of techniques, processes, and formal disciplines. The shifting of perspective and approach from work to work is reminiscent of Durrell's Alexandria Quartet and indeed Brown's examination of the emotional, intellectual, and aesthetic ramifications of his origins is the sort of thing one finds frequently in literature and rarely in improvisional music. During the 1970s, Brown also recorded with Archie Shepp (Attica Blues, 1972 and Attica Blues Big Band Live At The Palais Des Glaces, 1979), Leo Smith (Duets, 1973), Elliott Schwartz (Duets and Soundways, both 1973), Stanley Cowell (Regeneration, 1975), Harold Budd (The Pavilion of Dreams, 1976), and Grachan Moncur III (Shadows, 1977). He also released ten albums under his own name. In 1972 and 1976, Brown received grants from the National Endowment for the Arts, which he used to compose and publish several pieces for solo piano, one of which was based on poetry from Jean Toomer's book Cane. He also transcribed some piano and organ music by Erik Satie including his Messe des pauvres and Pages mysterieuses, and arranged the composer's Le Fils des √©toiles for two guitars and violin. In the 1980s, Brown continued recording, and also began focusing on drawing and painting, exhibiting his artwork at a number of shows. His charcoal portrait of blues guitarist Blind Lemon Jefferson was included in an art show called Jus' Jass at Kenkeleba Gallery in New York City, which also included works by artists such as Romare Bearden, Charles Searles and Joe Overstreet. In 1984, he published an autobiography titled \\"Recollections\\". In the 1990s, he occasionally performed and read his poetry at Studio 5C in New York. By the late 1990s, Brown had fallen ill; due to a series of surgeries and a partial leg amputation, Brown resided for a time in the Bethany Methodist Home, Brooklyn. He spent his final years in an assisted living facility in Hollywood, Florida, where he died in 2010, aged 79. In September 2010, Deval Patrick, then governor of Massachusetts, issued a proclamation naming September 15 \\"Marion Brown Day.\\" On June 25, 2019, The New York Times Magazine listed Marion Brown among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the 2008 Universal fire. Influence Pianist Amina Claudine Myers' debut album Poems for Piano: The Piano Music of Marion Brown (Sweet Earth, 1979) featured Brown's compositions predominantly. Aside from his influence in the jazz avant-garde, several other areas of music have taken interest in Brown's music. Indie rockers Superchunk included a song called \\"Song for Marion Brown\\" on their album Indoor Living, and Savath and Savalas released a piece entitled \\"Two Blues for Marion Brown\\" as part of Hefty Records's Immediate Action series. His Name Is Alive performed a tribute concert in 2004, performing solely Brown's music. In 2007, High Two released portions of the concert with studio versions as Sweet Earth Flower: A Tribute to Marion Brown. Thoughts on Music \\"It is wrong to say that free jazz does not swing. It swings to a high number of beats. It is polyrhythmic. But it is hard for people listening to it to realize that... Free jazz is closer to African beats than bop or swing were; African rhythm is very complex.\\" \\"My reference is the blues, and that's where my music comes from. I do listen to music of other cultures, but I just find them interesting. I don't have to borrow from them. My music and my past are rich enough. B.B. King is my Ravi Shankar\\".

With her husband William Huggins she was a pioneer in the field of spectroscopy and co-wrote the Atlas of Representative Stellar Spectra (1899).  Family and early life Margarey Lindsay Huggins was part of a family of four, Margaret, her brother, Robert Douglas, her Father, John Murray and her Mother, Helen Lindsay. Her father, John, was a solicitor,Becker, B.J. (2011). Unravelling Starlight: William and Margaret Huggins and the Rise of the New Astronomy.

Robert Douglas, attended Edinburgh Academy at the age of twelve, and then attended further education in Trinity College, Dublin in his later years. The family home was a Georgian style townhouse, at 23 Longford Terrace in Dun Laoghaire. Margaret's grandfather, Robert Murray, was a very important figure in her life. He was a wealthy officer at the Bank of Ireland but also enjoyed the hobby of astronomy. From a young age Margaret had a keen interest in astronomy as a result of the relationship between herself and her grandfather. When she was a young girl her grandfather brought her outdoors in the evening, and taught her about all the constellations and how they can be identified. This inspired her to be an astronomer, and she therefore attended private school in Brighton from a young age.  Education Margaret's early education took place privately at her home in Dublin, where she studied art, classics, literature, languages and music. She also spent some time at a school in Brighton, England. The exact location is unknown, but during this time period Brighton had at least two private boarding schools for girls, neither of which remain in their original location today. Despite her successful career in Astronomy, Mary received no formal training in this field. Instead, she studied popular Astronomy books, including Sir John Herschel's \\"Outlines of Astronomy\\". Margaret also developed a keen interest in photography, which she studied in her spare time; something which would later play a role in her career. In 1873, during a continued effort to educate herself, Margaret read a copy of the 19th century publication Good Words. Although a religious pamphlet, it often published articles on general subjects, and science. Here, Margaret found a piece by the group The British Association for the Advancement of Science (now the British Science Association) about the recent work done by William Huggins on the spectroscope and constructed a spectroscope after finding inspiration in that article. Huggins' interest and abilities in spectroscopy led to her introduction by astronomical instrument maker Howard Grubb to the astronomer William Huggins, whom she married on 8 September 1875 in the Parish Church at Monkstown, County Dublin. Evidence suggests that Margaret was instrumental in instigating William Huggins' successful program in photographic research. She was a contributor to the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Eleventh Edition. The London Times, in the notice of the death of Huggins, mentioned that Richard Proctor referred to her as the \\"Herschel of the Spectroscope\\". In her will she bequeathed to Wellesley College and to the College's Whitin Observatory some of her astronomy collection including cherished astronomical artefacts.  Marriage Prior to their first encounter, Margaret was already a fervent admirer of her husband to be, Sir William Huggins. William was an astronomical spectroscopist, whose line of work collaborated instantly with Margaret's. Their partnership was described as \\"one of the most successful husband and wife partnerships in the whole of astronomy\\". After their marriage on 8 September 1875, at the Monkstown Parish Church, the \\"two star-gazed\\" lovers devoted themselves to their research and their inspiring companionship resulted in an array of astronomical findings. Margaret and William Huggins were the first to \\"observe and to identify the series of hydrogen lines in the spectrum of the star Vega.\\" The pairs' detailed notebook entries contributed to their first paper publication in 1889, discussing the \\"studies of the spectra of planets\\". They were also among those who \\"observed the Nova of 1892, Nova Aurigae.\\" Margaret was specifically in charge of the visual observations, while together they collected \\"photographic spectra over several nights.\\" The couple's work had a major influence on their daily lives. Their home acted more as a work space, rather than a place for any kind of familial essence, and they never had any children. In 1903, Margaret and William Huggins' published their final piece of joint scientific research on the spectra of certain radioactive substances.  Career Margaret Huggins learnt the basic skills of photography early on in her life, and used these skills to assist her research at the Tulse Hill observatory. In 1875, Margaret and her husband William began photographic experiments, which were meticulously documented in observatory notebooks. Their early experiments photographed Sirius and Venus, and they used different techniques to capture them such as using wet and dry plates. Margaret made great improvements to their observatory equipment, and Margaret and William quickly rose to the forefront of spectroscopic astrophotography. Margaret worked alongside her husband William at the Tulse Hill observatory. At first, she is documented to being an assistant, but after extensive research into their observatory notebooks, this has been disproven. She conducted many of her own research projects, and was a collaborative assistant to William. After 1875, Margaret and William began a meticulous program of photographic experiments. During the 1880s, the pair were devoted to two projects; the first attempting to photograph the solar corona, and the second examining different Nebulae. The second project marked a milestone for Margaret, it was the first time she would be mentioned as the co-author of the paper alongside William. The Hugginses worked together for thirty-five years as equal collaborative investigative partners.  Death and legacy After 30 years of devoting her life to Science, Margaret felt that she had contributed the best of her work. Sadly, Margaret's husband, William Huggins died in 1910. She planned to write the biography of her late husband, but never succeeded. Margaret fell ill and underwent various surgeries and spent some time in hospital. Aware of her illness, she decided to donate her scientific and artistic treasures to Wellesley Women's College in the United States. Margaret greatly admired the achievements of American women in the academic world and supported women's education. Margaret Huggins died on 24 March 1915 at the age of 66. She was cremated and her ashes laid next to William's at Golders Green Crematorium.Br√ºck, M. T. & Elliott, I., \\"The Family Background of Lady Huggins\\", Irish Astronomical Journal, Vol.20, NO. 3/MAR, 1992 P.210 Margaret addressed in her will for a memorial to be erected in St.Paul's Cathedral, London, in honour of her husband. This memorial consists of a pair of medallions which are inscribed \\"William Huggins, astronomer 1824‚Äì1910\\" and the other \\"Margaret Lindsay Huggins, 1848‚Äì1915, his wife and fellow worker\\". There was a plaque established in 1997 that marks the house she grew up in on 23 Longford Terrace, Monkstown Dublin.

Adult males have a distinguishable red crown which females do not. However, this physical feature is present in the juvenile of both sexes. They have zygodactyl feet and stiff tail feathers which allows them to maintain a vertical position on trees; typical of woodpeckers.

Taxonomy The Nuttall's woodpecker is closely related to the ladder-backed woodpecker of Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, and Mexico.del Hoyo, Elliott and Sargatal. 1992. Handbook to birds of the world. Lynx Edicions, Barcelona, Spain The Nuttall's likely evolved via allopatric speciation when the two species were separated into smaller ranges by dry climate during the Pleistocene glaciation. Hybrids of the two species exist but are rare. Some taxonomic authorities, including the American Ornithological Society, continue to place this species in the genus Picoides. Habitat and distribution Nuttall's are a non-migratory species with a geographic range confined to northern California extending south towards the northwest region of Baja California, Mexico. Their preferred habitat is arid to mesic woodlands. In particular, these woodpeckers prefer oak woodlands, although they also occur in riparian sites and chaparral in the most southern parts of its range because of the decrease in oak abundance. Individuals are found from sea level to , rarely to . Although they have been found as far east as Central Wyoming. The birds are not considered globally threatened although the range is restricted to the California Endemic Bird Area. They are fairly common in California with a total world population estimated at over 100,000 individuals (density of about 20 birds per square kilometer in San Bernardino County). Surveys suggest no obvious population trends. Behaviour =Vocalizations= Vocalizations performed by Nuttall's woodpecker are considered to be not of any harmonic. Some vocalizations have been described: * Call note ‚Äì used between mated pairs to communicate their location to each other. * Double call ‚Äì same function as call note can but also be used as a low threat alarm call. * Rattle call ‚Äì used to establish territories when feeding * Kweek call ‚Äì used between sexes mainly by female prior to copulation. Both sexes drum. Rolls are relatively long, averaging over one second. =Diet= Nuttall's woodpecker feeds primarily on insect larvae such as those of wood borers, click beetles, and ants, found by tapping and probing into the crevices in oak trees. The bird also feeds on sap from sap holes created by red-breasted sapsuckers in birch and willow, and consumes a variety of berry seeds.Jenkins, J.M. 1979. \\"Foraging behaviour of male and female Nuttall Woodpeckers Picoides nuttallii\\". Auk, 96: 418-420 =Reproduction= Male and chick in a nest Pair bonding occurs in late January to March with egg-laying mostly in April and May. Nuttall's woodpeckers are socially monogamous and show displays of bi-parental care. New nests are excavated each year by males in the cavities of dead trees such as willow, oak, and alder. Clutch sizes range from 3 to 6 eggs with the male partner incubating the eggs at night and the female during the day. Incubation period can be up to 14 days. Fledglings are able to leave the nest around 29 days post hatch with parental care continuing for 14 days after that.

In 1966 he joined the Royal Air Force, but soon thereafter he left and signed up at the Newport School of Art for a year's foundation course. After that, he went on to complete a 3-year Diploma in Art and Design at Saint Martin's School of Art in London. When he left Saint Martin's in 1972 he had already joined the recently established illustration agency Young Artists. He has been with this agency, later renamed Arena, ever since. He is today a contemporary British science fiction illustrator. His work mostly deals with science fiction with erotic overtones. His paintings are generally intricate photo-realistic works of beautiful women set against advanced machines and spaceships. While his preparatory sketches are more erotically focused, his final works and published book covers have a more academic tone portraying far off and imaginary worlds. Apart from book and game covers, Burns briefly worked with Ridley Scott on Blade Runner, and his illustrations and paintings comprise much of the book Mechanismo by Harry Harrison. He has also had books of his own works published, including Lightship, Planet Story (written by Harry Harrison), Transluminal, and Imago. Burns won the Hugo award for best professional artist three times and has also been awarded 12 BSFA awards. Well regarded in fandom, he was artist guest of honour at the 1987 Worldcon. Portfolio Work by the artist includes cover art for: * The Fury of Dracula (1987) a boardgame by Stephen Hand * Two books by Daniel Keys Moran ** Armageddon Blues (1988) ** The Long Run (1989) * Artificial Things (1989) for Karen Joy Fowler * Over thirty books by Robert Silverberg including The Face of the Waters (1991) * Aristoi (1992) by Walter Jon Williams * Upland Outlaws (1993) by Dave Duncan * Infinity's Shore (1996) by David Brin * The Stone Dance of the Chameleon series by Ricardo Pinto ** The Chosen (1999) ** The Standing Dead (2002) ** The Third God (2009) * The Greg Mandel Trilogy by Peter F.

The Pitted Ware culture ( 3500 BC‚Äì 2300 BC) was a hunter-gatherer culture in southern Scandinavia, mainly along the coasts of Svealand, G√∂taland, √Öland, north-eastern Denmark and southern Norway. Despite its Mesolithic economy, it is by convention classed as Neolithic, since it falls within the period in which farming reached Scandinavia. The Pitted Ware people were largely maritime hunters, and were engaged in lively trade with both the agricultural communities of the Scandinavian interior and other hunter- gatherers of the Baltic Sea. The people of the Pitted Ware culture were a genetically homogeneous and distinct population descended from earlier Scandinavian Hunter-Gatherers (SHGs). The culture emerged in east-central Sweden around 3,500 BC, gradually replacing the Funnelbeaker culture throughout the coastal areas of southern Scandinavia. It subsequently co- existed with the Funnelbeaker culture for several centuries. From about 2,800 BC, the Pitted Ware culture co-existed with the Battle Axe culture, which was the successor of the Funnelbeaker culture in southern Scandinavia. By 2,300 BC, the Pitted Ware culture had been absorbed by the Battle Axe culture. The subsequent Nordic Bronze Age represents a fusion of elements from the Pitted Ware culture and the Battle Axe culture. Modern Scandinavians, unlike the Sami, display partial genetic origins from the Pitted Ware people. History Genetic studies suggest that the Pitted Ware peoples, unlike their Neolithic neighbors, were descended from earlier Scandinavian Hunter-Gatherers (SHGs). At the time of the emergence of the Pitted Ware culture, these hunter- gatherers persisted to the north of the agricultural Funnelbeaker culture. Their ceramic traditions are related to those of the Comb Ceramic culture. The Pitted Ware culture arose around 3,500 BC. Its earliest sites are found in east-central Sweden, where it appears to have replaced the Funnelbeaker culture. Its subsequent expansion is accompanied by the disappearance of settlements of the Funnelbeaker culture throughout large parts of southern Scandinavia. It came to occupy the coasts of Denmark, southern Sweden, southern Norway and various islands of the Baltic Sea, such as √ñland, Gotland, and √Öland. There were lively contacts with hunter-gatherer communities of Finland and the eastern Baltic. During its initial years, the Pitted Ware culture co-existed with the Funnelbeaker culture. Although the two cultures exchanged goods with each other, its peoples appear to have had widely different identities, and they did not mix with each other to any notable extent. During the period of Pitted Ware expansion, the Funnelbeakers constructed a number of defensive palisades, which may mean that the two peoples were in conflict with each other. Throughout its existence of more than 1,000 years, the Pitted Ware culture remained virtually unchanged. From around 2,800 BC, the Pitted Ware culture co-existed for some time with the Battle Axe culture and the Single Grave culture, which succeeded the Funnelbeaker culture in southern Scandinvia. Both were variants of the Corded Ware culture. Like the Funnelbeakers, the Corded Ware constructed a series of defensive palisades during this period, which may be a sign of violent conflict between them and the Pitted Ware. Though cultural influences of the Battle Axe culture are detectable in Pitted Ware burials, its peoples do not appear to have mixed with each other. By ca. 2,300 BC, the Pitted Ware culture had merged with the Battle Axe culture. The subsequent Nordic Bronze Age represents a fusion of elements from the Pitted Ware culture and the Battle Axe culture. Settlements Pitted Ware settlements were typically located along the coasts. They usually lived in huts. Economy Trindyxa (round stone axe), Gotland, Sweden The economy of the Pitted Ware culture was based on fishing, hunting and gathering of plants. Pitted Ware sites contain bones from elk, deer, beaver, seal, porpoise, and pig. Pig bones found in large quantities on some Pitted Ware sites emanate from wild boar rather than domestic pigs. The hunting of seal was particularly important. For this reason, the Pitted Ware people have been called \\"hard-core sealers\\" or the \\"Inuit of the Baltic\\". Seasonal migration was a feature of life, as with many other hunter-gatherer communities. Pitted Ware communities in Eastern Sweden probably spent most of the year at their main village on the coast, making seasonal forays inland to hunt for pigs and fur-bearing animals and to engage in exchange with farming communities in the interior. This type of seasonal interaction may explain the unique Alvastra Pile Dwelling in south-western √ñsterg√∂tland, which belongs to the Pitted Ware culture as far as the pottery is concerned, but to the Funnelbeaker culture in tools and weapons. The Pitted Ware peoples appear to have been specialized hunters who engaged in the trade of animal goods with peoples throughout the Baltic. Tools A pottery shard showing the characteristic pits, from Uppland, Sweden The repertoire of Pitted Ware tools varied from region to region. In part this variety reflected regional sources of raw materials. However the use of fish-hooks, harpoons, and nets and sinkers was fairly widespread. Tanged arrow heads made from blades of flintstone are abundant on Scandinavia's west coast, and were probably used in the hunting of marine mammals. Ceramics One notable feature of the Pitted Ware Culture is the sheer quantity of shards of pottery on its sites. The culture has been named after the typical ornamentation of its pottery: horizontal rows of pits pressed into the body of the pot before firing. Though some vessels are flat-bottomed, others are round-based or pointed-based, which would facilitate stable positioning in the soil or on the hearth. In shape and decoration, this ceramic reflects influences from the Comb Ceramic culture (also known as Pit-Comb Ware) of Finland and other parts of north-eastern Europe, established in the sixth and fifth millennia BC. Small animal figurines were modelled out of clay, as well as bone. These are also similar to the art of the Comb Ware culture. A large number of clay figurines have been found at Jettb√∂le on the island of Jomala in √Öland, including some which combine seal and human features. Graves A characteristic moose figurine, from √Öloppe, Uppland, Sweden The Pitted Ware people buried their dead in cemeteries. Most excavated Pitted Ware burials are located at Gotland, where around 180 graves have been found at numerous sites with several layers. One such site is at V√§sterbjers. Pitted Ware people were typically buried in flat inhumation graves, although cremation does occur. Unlike the Funnelbeakers, they did not have megalithic graves. Pitted Ware burials are also distinguished from Funnelbeaker burials through their use of red ochre. Grave goods include ceramics, boar tusks, pig jaws, pendants of fox, dog and seal teeth, harpoons, spears, fishhooks of bone, stone and flint axes, and other artifacts. The presence of slate artifacts and battle axes attest wide-ranging contacts between the Pitted Ware people and other cultures of Northern Europe and the Baltic. People of all ages and genders were buried in the same cemetery. There are no indications of difference in social status. Their mortuary houses and secondary burials are nevertheless evidence of complex burial customs. Culture The Pitted Ware people had an animistic cosmography similar to that of the people of the Comb Ceramic culture and other Mesolothic hunter-gatherers of the Baltic. Physical anthropology Examination of the skeletons of Pitted Ware people have revealed that they were of a more robust build than contemporary neighboring populations. In particular, they were much better adapted to cold temperatures. Genetics Genetic studies of the Pitted Ware peoples has found them to have been strikingly genetically homogenous, suggesting that they originated from a small founder group. In a genetic study published in Current Biology in September 2009, mtDNA was extracted from seventeen Pitted Ware people from Gotland. Eight individuals belonged to U4 haplotypes, seven belonged to U5 haplotypes, one belonged to K1a1, one belonged to T2b, and one belonged to HV0. The results debunked previous theories suggesting that the Pitted Ware were related to the Sami people. On the contrary, Pitted Ware people showed closer genetic kinship to modern Balts and Estonians. The examined Pitted Ware were genetically much closer to modern Scandinavians than to the Sami people. In a genetic study published in BMC Evolutionary Biology in March 2010, it was discovered that the Pitted Ware possessed a very low level (5%) of an allele (‚àí13910*T) strongly associated with the ability to consume unprocessed milk. This frequency is dramatically different from modern Swedes (74%). Whether the increase of this allele among the Swedes was a result of admixture or natural selection was uncertain. In a genetic study published in Science in April 2012, an individual from the Pitted Ware culture was examined. The individual was found to have \\"a genetic profile that is not fully represented by any sampled contemporary population\\". In another genetic study published in Science in May 2014, the mtDNA of six individuals ascribed to the Pitted Ware culture was extracted. Four samples belonged to U4d, one belonged to U, and one belonged to V. A genetic study published in August 2014 found that Pitted Ware peoples were closely genetically similar to people of the Catacomb culture, who like the Pitted Ware people carried high frequencies of the maternal haplogroups U5 and U4. These lineages are associated with Western Hunter-Gatherers and Eastern Hunter-Gatherers. In a genetic study published in Nature in September 2014, members of the Pitted Ware culture were determined to largely belong to the Scandinavian Hunter-Gatherer (SHG) cluster. In a genetic study published in Proceedings of the Royal Society B in January 2015, the mtDNA of thirteen PCW individuals from √ñland and Gotland was extracted. The four individuals from √ñland carried H1f, T2b, K1a1 and U4a1. Of the ten individuals from Gotland, four carried U4, two carried U5 haplotypes, two carried K1a1, and one carried HV0. The results indicated that the Pitted Ware culture was genetically distinct from the Funnelbeaker culture, and closely genetically related to earlier Mesolithic hunter-gatherers of Scandinavia and Western Europe. It was found that the Pitted Ware culture left a genetic imprint on Scandinavians, although this number is certainly not more than 60%. A genetic study published in Nature Communications in January 2018 indicated genetic continuity between SHGs and the Pitted Ware culture, and found that the Pitted Ware people were genetically distinct from the Funnelbeaker culture. A 2019 study published in Proceedings of the Royal Society B the remains of a Pitted Ware male were analyzed. He was found to the carrying the maternal haplgroup U5b1d2, and probably a subclade of the paternal haplogroup I2. He was estimated to be 25‚Äì35 years old and 165‚Äì175 cm tall. It was found that the Pitted Ware people only slightly contributed to the gene pool of the Battle Axe culture, who were almost wholly of Western Steppe Herder descent. A genetic study published in Proceedings of the Royal Society B in June 2020 examined the remains of 19 Pitted Ware individuals buried on the island of Gotland. The study included a number of individuals who had been buried in a way typical of the Battle Axe culture. The 6 samples of Y-DNA extracted belonged to the paternal haplogroup I2a-L460 (2 samples), I2-M438 (2 samples), I2a1a-CTS595 and I2a1b1-L161. The 17 samples of mtDNA extracted belonged overwhelmingly to the maternal haplogroups U4 and U5. The study found no evidence of Battle Axe admixture among the Pitted Ware. They were genetically very different from earlier Funnelbeaker inhabitants of Gotland, although they carried a tiny amount of EEF admixture. The evidence suggested that while the Pitted Ware culture was culturally influenced by the Battle Axe culture, it was not genetically influenced by it.

Individual leaves can be seen on the surface of the brick. Compressed tea, called tea bricks, tea cakes or tea lumps, and tea nuggets according to the shape and size, are blocks of whole or finely ground black tea, green tea, or post-fermented tea leaves that have been packed in molds and pressed into block form. This was the most commonly produced and used form of tea in ancient China prior to the Ming Dynasty. Although tea bricks are less commonly produced in modern times, many post- fermented teas, such as pu-erh, are still commonly found in bricks, discs, and other pressed forms. Tea bricks can be made into beverages like tea or eaten as food, and were also used in the past as a form of currency.  Production  Ernest Henry \\"Chinese\\" Wilson, an explorer botanist. In ancient China, compressed teas were usually made with thoroughly dried and ground tea leaves that were pressed into various bricks or other shapes, although partially dried and whole leaves were also used. Some tea bricks were also mixed with binding agents such as flour, blood, or manure to better preserve their form so they could withstand physical use as currency. Newly formed tea bricks were then left to cure, dry, and age prior to being sold or traded. Tea bricks were preferred in trade prior to the 19th century in Asia since they were more compact than loose leaf tea and were also less susceptible to physical damage incurred through transportation over land by caravans on the Ancient tea route. Tea bricks are still currently manufactured for drinking, as in pu-erh teas, as well as for souvenirs and novelty items, though most compressed teas produced in modern times are usually made from whole leaves. The compressed tea can take various traditional forms, many of them still being produced. A dome-shaped nugget of 100g (standard size) is simply called tu√≥ch√° (), which is translated several ways, sometimes as \\"bird's nest tea\\" or \\"bowl tea.\\" A small dome-shaped nugget with a dimple underneath just enough to make one pot or cup of tea is called a xi«éo tu√≥ch√° (; the first word meaning \\"small\\") which usually weighs 3g‚Äì5g. A larger piece around 357g, which may be a disc with a dimple, is called b«êngch√° (, literally \\"biscuit tea\\" or \\"cake tea\\"). A large, flat, square brick is called fƒÅngch√° (, literally \\"square tea\\"). To produce a tea brick, ground or whole tea is first steamed, then placed into one of a number of types of press and compressed into a solid form. Such presses may leave an intended imprint on the tea, such as an artistic design or simply the pattern of the cloth with which the tea was pressed. Many powdered tea bricks are moistened with rice water in pressing to assure that the tea powder sticks together. The pressed blocks of tea are then left to dry in storage until a suitable degree of moisture has evaporated. > Ya'an is the main market for a special kind of tea which is grown in this > part of the country and exported in very large quantities to Tibet via > Kangding and over the caravan routes through Batang (Paan) and Teko. > Although the Chinese regard it as an inferior product, it is greatly > esteemed by the Tibetans for its powerful flavor, which harmonizes > particularly well with that of the rancid yak's butter which they mix with > their tea.

Consumption  A brick of Hubei m«ê zh≈´an ch√° (), made of powdered black tea Due to their density and toughness tea bricks were consumed after they were broken into small pieces and boiled. Traditionally in Tang Dynasty, they were consumed after having been ground to a fine powder. The legacy of using tea bricks in powdered form can be seen through modern Japanese tea powders as well as the pulverized tea leaves used in the lei cha () eaten by the Hakka people and some people in Hunan province. = Beverage = In ancient China the use of tea bricks involved three separate steps: #Toasting: A piece was broken from the tea brick and usually first toasted over a fire. This was probably done to sanitize the tea brick and destroy any mold or insect infestation that may have occurred when the bricks were stored uncovered in warehouses and storerooms or in covered jars underground. Toasting also imparted a pleasant flavor to the resulting beverage. #Grinding: The toasted tea brick was broken up and ground to a fine powder. #Whisking: The powdered tea was mixed into hot water and frothed with a whisk before serving. The color and patterns formed by the powdered tea were enjoyed while the mixture was being drunk. In modern times bricks of pu-erh type teas are flaked, chipped, or broken and directly steeped after thorough rinsing; the process of toasting, grinding, and whisking to make tea from tea bricks has become uncommon. Tteokcha (), also called byeongcha (), was the most commonly produced and consumed type of tea in pre-modern Korea. Pressed tea made into the shape of yeopjeon, the coins with holes, was called doncha (), jeoncha (), or cheongtaejeon (). Borim-cha () or Borim-baengmo-cha (), named after its birthplace, the Borim temple in Jangheung, South Jeolla Province, is a popular tteokcha variety. = Food = Tea bricks are used as a form of food in parts of Central Asia and Tibet in the past as much as in modern times. In Tibet pieces of tea are broken from tea bricks, and boiled overnight in water, sometimes with salt. The resulting concentrated tea infusion is then mixed with butter, cream or milk and a little salt to make butter tea, a staple of Tibetan cuisine. The tea mixed with tsampa is called Pah. Individual portions of the mixture are kneaded in a small bowl, formed into balls and eaten. Some cities of the Fukui prefecture in Japan have food similar to tsampa, where concentrated tea is mixed with grain flour. However, the tea may or may not be made of tea bricks. In parts of Mongolia and central Asia, a mixture of ground tea bricks, grain flours and boiling water is eaten directly. It has been suggested that tea eaten whole provides needed roughage normally lacking in the diet.  Use as currency  A brick of tea presented to Tsar Nicholas II, 1891 Due to the high value of tea in many parts of Asia, tea bricks were used as a form of currency throughout China, Tibet, Mongolia, and Central Asia. This is quite similar to the use of salt bricks as currency in parts of Africa. Tea bricks were in fact the preferred form of currency over metallic coins for the nomads of Mongolia and Siberia. The tea could not only be used as money and eaten as food in times of hunger but also brewed as allegedly beneficial medicine for treating coughs and colds. Until World War II, tea bricks were still used as a form of edible currency in Siberia. Tea bricks for Tibet were mainly produced in the area of Ya'an (formerly Yachou-fu) in Sichuan province. The bricks were produced in five different qualities and valued accordingly. The kind of brick which was most commonly used as currency in the late 19th and early 20th century was that of the third quality which the Tibetans called \\"brgyad pa\\" (\\"eighth\\"), because at one time it was worth eight Tibetan tangkas (standard silver coin of Tibet which weighs about 5.4 grams) in Lhasa. Bricks of this standard were also exported by Tibet to Bhutan and Ladakh.Wolfgang Bertsch, 2006 The Use of Tea Bricks as Currency among the Tibetans (- Der Gebrauch von Teeziegeln als Zahlungsmittel bei den Tibetern\\" Der Primitivgeldsammler), Europ√§ische Vereinigung zum Erforschen, Sammeln und Bewahren von urspr√ºnglichen und au√üergew√∂hnlichen Geldformen (European Association for the Research, Collection and Preservation of Original and Curious Money), No. 75 Health effects All tea plant tissues accumulate fluorine to some extent. Tea bricks that are made from old tea leaves and stems can accumulate large amounts of this element, which can make them unsafe for consumption in large quantities or over prolonged periods. Use of such teas has led to fluorosis, a form of fluoride poisoning that affects the bones and teeth, in areas of high brick tea consumption such as Tibet. Pu-erh and other teas are claimed to have many beneficial effects on health.

The enemy's determined aggressiveness caused the flight to split into elements, and during a defensive maneuver, Major Harris' element was forced to break up. Immediately three of the enemy planes attacked the wingman and two attacked Major Harris. Disregarding his own precarious situation, Major Harris attacked the three MIGs, shooting one of them down and forcing the other two to break off. Then Major Harris switched his attention to his own attackers, but before he could gain the offensive, his wingman was again attacked by a flight of enemy planes. For a second time Major Harris completely disregarded personal safety to aid his wingman, and again he destroyed one of the enemy planes and forced the others to break off their attack. Through his high courage, aggressive airmanship, and outstanding devotion to duty in the face of direct enemy attack, Major Harris reflected great credit upon himself, the Far East Air Forces, and the United States Air Force.\\" * Fourth and fifth: 13:50 ‚Äì May 4, 1952 near Sinuiju, Korea **\\"Two YAK-9 type aircraft by strafing.

Biography Angiolini was born in Milan. In 1966 he was the first to illustrate one of Italy's most important adult comics, Isabella, written by Renzo Barbieri and Giorgio Cavedon. He was also involved in the creation of Goldrake, Vartan, Una, Belzeba and La Poliziotta. Amongst the group of Italian artists who created comic strips for adults between the 1960s and 1970s, (which had become increasingly pornographic by the eighties), the style of Sandro Angiolini stands out. This style originally owed much to Milton Caniff, one of his initial sources of inspiration, but followed a clear and marked line of development, parallel to the development of Italian fumetti, but unique. Characters are drawn in a sometimes simplistic fashion with an emphasis on essential features and strong expressions to complement and move the narration forward. A prolific artist, he has created illustrations for the most varied types of publication, and in periods of most intense activity was known, with the help of some colleagues, to produce two pocket books full of art in a month, amounting to 460 panels in two stories.

Illusionistic ceiling painting, which includes the techniques of perspective di sotto in s√π and quadratura, is the tradition in Renaissance, Baroque and Rococo art in which trompe l'oeil, perspective tools such as foreshortening, and other spatial effects are used to create the illusion of three-dimensional space on an otherwise two-dimensional or mostly flat ceiling surface above the viewer. It is frequently used to create the illusion an open sky, such as with the oculus in Andrea Mantegna's Camera degli Sposi, or the illusion of an architectural space such as the cupola, one of Andrea Pozzo's frescoes in Sant'Ignazio, Rome. Illusionistic ceiling painting belongs to the general class of illusionism in art, designed to create accurate representations of reality. Di sotto in s√π Andrea Mantegna, di sotto in s√π ceiling fresco in the Camera degli Sposi of the Ducal palace, Mantua Di sotto in s√π (or sotto in su), which means \\"seen from below\\" or \\"from below, upward\\" in Italian, developed in late quattrocento Italian Renaissance painting, notably in Andrea Mantegna's Camera degli Sposi in Mantua and in frescoes by Melozzo da Forl√¨. Italian terminology for this technique reflects the latter artist's influence and is called prospettiva melozziana (\\"Melozzo's perspective\\"). Another notable use is by Antonio da Correggio in the Parma Cathedral, which foreshadows Baroque architecture grandeur. The technique often uses foreshortened figures and an architectural vanishing point to create the perception of true space on a painted, most often frescoed, ceiling above the viewer. Quadratura Ceiling of the Jesuit Church, Vienna by Andrea Pozzo (1703) Quadratura, a term which was introduced in the seventeenth century and is also normally used in English, became popular with Baroque artists. Although it can also refer to the \\"opening up\\" of walls through architectural illusion, the term is most commonly associated with Italian ceiling painting. Unlike other trompe-l'oeil techniques or precedent di sotto in s√π ceiling decorations, which often rely on intuitive artistic approaches to deception, quadratura is directly tied to seventeenth-century theories of perspective and the representation of architectural space.Rudolf Wittkower, Joseph Connors, and Jennifer Montagu, Art and Architecture in Italy, 1600-1750, vol. 1, Pelican history of art, New Haven: Yale University Press (1999): 35-36. Due to its reliance on perspective theory, it more fully unites architecture, painting and sculpture and gives a more overwhelming impression of illusionism than earlier examples. The artist would paint a feigned architecture in perspective on a flat or barrel-vaulted ceiling in such a way that it seems to continue the existing architecture. The perspective of this illusion is centered towards one focal point. The steep foreshortening of the figures, the painted walls and pillars, creates an illusion of deep recession, heavenly sphere or even an open sky. Paintings on ceilings could, for example, simulate statues in niches or openings revealing the sky. Quadratura may also employ other illusionistic painting techniques, such as anamorphosis. Examples of illusionistic painting include: *Andrea Pozzo at Sant'Ignazio, Rome and the Jesuit Church, Vienna. He wrote the standard theoretical work of his artistic ideas in the two volumes of Perspectiva pictorum et architectorum Andreae Putei a societate Jesu (Rome, 1693-1700). *Holy Cross Church in the town of Brzeg, Poland, *Pietro da Cortona at the Palazzo Barberini, *Gianbattista Tiepolo in the Ca' Rezzonico in Venice, Villa Pisani at Stra, and the throne room at the Royal Palace of Madrid. Other examples were by Paolo Veronese at Villa Rotonda in Vicenza and Baldassare Peruzzi in the Villa Farnesina of Rome. Development The ceiling in Ljubljana Cathedral, painted by Giulio Quaglio the Younger in 1705‚Äì06 Italian Renaissance artists applied their confidence in handling perspective to projects for ceilings and overcame the problems of applying linear perspective to the concave surfaces of domes in order to dissolve the architecture and create illusions of limitless space. Painted and patterned ceilings were a Gothic tradition in Italy as elsewhere, but the first ceiling painted to feign open space was created by Andrea Mantegna, a master of perspective who went to Mantua as court painter to the Gonzaga. His masterpiece was a series of frescoes that culminated in 1474 in the Camera degli Sposi of the Ducal Palace. In these works, he carried the art of illusionistic perspective to new limits. He frescoed the walls with illusionistic scenes of court life, while the ceiling appeared as if it were an oculus open to the sky, with courtiers, a peacock, and putti leaning over a balustrade, seen in strongly foreshortened perspective from below;di sotto in s√π. This was the prototype of illusionistic ceiling painting that was to become an important element of Italian Baroque art. Correggio at Parma took the illusionistic ceiling a step farther in his frescoes of Christ and the Apostles for the cupola at the San Giovanni Evangelista and in the Assumption of the Virgin in the dome of the Parma Cathedral, which is Correggio's most famous work (1520-24); in these frescos Correggio treats the entire surface as the vast and frameless vault of heaven in which the figures float. In a visual continuity between the architectural interior and its painted surfaces, Corregio's clouds and figures appear to inhabit the same architectural space in which the spectator stands. Dome of Sant'Andrea della Valle In Baroque Rome, the long-standing tradition of frescoed ceilings received a push from the grand projects in Palazzo Farnese under the guidance of Annibale Carracci and his team, but the figural subjects were still enclosed within multiple framed compartments (quadri riportati), and the perspective of subjects seen from below was not consistently taken into consideration. From 1625 to 1627 Giovanni Lanfranco, a native of Parma who knew Correggio's dome, painted the enormous dome of the church of Sant'Andrea della Valle with an Assumption of the Virgin that overwhelmed contemporary spectators with its exuberant illusionistic effects and became one of the first High Baroque masterpieces. Lanfranco's work in Rome (1613‚Äì1630) and in Naples (1634‚Äì1646) was fundamental to the development of illusionism in Italy. Pietro Berrettini, called Pietro da Cortona, developed the illusionistic ceiling fresco to an extraordinary degree in works such as the ceiling (1633-1639) of the gran salone of Palazzo Barberini. From 1676 to 1679 Giovanni Battista Gaulli, called Baciccio, painted an Adoration of the Name of Jesus on the ceiling of the Church of the Ges√π, the Jesuit headquarters in Rome. From 1691 to 1694 Andrea Pozzo painted the Entrance of Saint Ignatius into Paradise on the nave vault of Sant'Ignazio, Rome, with theatricality and emotion.

Created by Namco's Project Soul division, she first appeared in the original Soulcalibur and its subsequent sequels, later appearing in various merchandise related to the series. She was voiced in Japanese by Yumi T≈çma between Soulcalibur and Soulcalibur III, Kanako T≈çj≈ç between Soulcalibur Legends and Soulcalibur: Broken Destiny, and Miyuki Sawashiro in Soulcalibur V, and Soulcalibur VI; in English, she was voiced by Renee Hewitt in Soulcalibur II and Lani Minella for the remainder of the series. In the game, she is the illegitimate daughter of undead pirate Cervantes de Leon who was raised by a noble family until her father became obsessed with the cursed sword, Soul Edge, leading to his death and later her mother's. Desiring to destroy the sword, she creates a segmented, animated blade-whip, only to become Soul Edge's pawn and learn that it intends to use her as its next host. After an attack by Cervantes results in the loss of her soul, Ivy uses a temporary artificial one to keep herself alive, and continues after the blade. Ivy is considered one of the most prominent characters in the series as well as one of its mainstays, having appeared in every installment since Soulcalibur. She is often referred to as the series' poster girl. Since her introduction, Ivy has been regarded as an attractive and strong character by critics, and has been noted for her sex appeal. Critical reception varies, with some saying the character's oversexualization is unnecessary, while others have argued that her sexuality is an essential aspect of her character design and has allowed for her to be more recognizable. Conception and history As a character introduced in Soulcalibur, Ivy's signature weapon, a \\"snake sword\\" designed to be unique amongst the other weapons in the game, was selected before other elements of the character. Her design and concept were then built to revolve around it, starting with gender, then physical measurements, and lastly background details. After her appearance and movement were fleshed out by a concept artist, her character was rendered as a 3D model by a design team that worked solely on her, and then animated mostly by Naotake Hirata using motion capture to create her in-game movements, with Yasushi Shibue designing the animations for her throws, and several animations created without the use of motion capture for positions difficult for the actors. During this phase the team additionally worked with the Soulcalibur story creators, refining the character's own role in the plot as needed throughout development. During development many alternatives for Ivy's design were considered, including a male ninja, a mummy, and a little girl, while the weapon remained constant, varying only in size. With Soulcalibur II, the development team chose her as their favorite character from the previous title. Producer Hiroaki Yotoriyama felt that her fighting style was not perfectly expressed in Soulcalibur, and focused on Ivy from the start of the project to make her more \\"uniquely lethal\\". Namco has called Ivy one of the three most popular characters in the series in North American markets, alongside Taki and Nightmare. Soulcalibur V producer Hisaharu Tago emphasized this as a reason for the character's inclusion for the game, additionally citing her fighting style and role in the game's storyline. =Design= Ivy's secondary designs contrast against her default appearance Ivy appears as a tall, large busted woman with short, white hair. A bluish-purple leotard covers her torso and arms, with patches of the fabric removed to expose her cleavage, buttocks and various parts of her abdomen. Similar leggings cover her legs midway below her thighs, connected to the leotard by garters at golden metal bands at their peak. A sleeve of the same material covers her right arm and hand, while armor covers her left arm, hand, and shoulder. A smaller pauldron covers her right shoulder, while high heels cover her feet, and a white glove covers her right hand. The left shoulder pauldron incorporates the Tudor Rose, a traditional heraldic symbol of England, while the plates of the armor were designed to resemble the links of her sword. A mask covering the right side of her face and eye were considered but abandoned after the initial character concept. While her design has been altered slightly as the series has progressed, the concept has remained consistent throughout the series, with the exception of the removal of the glove in later designs. Ivy stands tall, making her the series' tallest female character, and with a bust measurement of 100 cm (39 in) also the bustiest, though this was an aspect that the developers felt they had overdone by her appearance in Soulcalibur IV. Ivy's alternate character designs in the games are a contrast to her primary designs, with the secondary from Soulcalibur to Soulcalibur III consisting of countess attire of either blue or red pants, vest, and jacket, with white boots covering her feet and her hair combed back. In Soulcalibur II, a tertiary alternate design was added consisting of a red leotard and gloves with gold trimming, with red stockings on her legs; in addition, a fourth design resembling her appearance at the conclusion of Soulcalibur was considered, incorporating a cloak and the symbol of caduceus on the front of her leotard cupping her breasts, but was unused. In Soulcalibur III, a long, rose-themed dress with hat and veil was used as a tertiary alternate, one of several considered designs. For Soulcalibur IV, a similarly themed black dress was used as her sole alternate design for the game. Some versions of the original Soulcalibur arcade game censored Ivy's default costume by covering her bare skin with a lavender catsuit. With Soulcalibur IV, Ivy's look on the promotional artwork was modified on the English website to hide her undercleavage, leading to suspicion of censorship in the American release of the game. When asked about the censoring, director Katsutoshi Sasaki stated he had heard of nothing of the sort having taken place. When released in North America it was shown that no actual censorship had occurred within the game. Appearances =In video games= As introduced in Soulcalibur, Ivy was raised by the Valentines, a noble family in London, England. Ivy's father became obsessed with the cursed sword Soul Edge, and worked himself to death. Her mother died shortly afterward, and revealed to Ivy that she was not their biological daughter. Becoming an alchemist, Ivy learned of her father's obsession and decided to destroy Soul Edge. She created an animated, segmented sword, bringing it to life by unknowingly summoning Soul Edge's current host, Nightmare, and was convinced to become one of his servants without realizing he wielded the blade she sought. After learning the truth, and that her real father was the sword's previous host Cervantes and her to be its next, she departed. Continuing her quest to destroy the sword in later games, Ivy was attacked by Cervantes and her soul consumed in Soulcalibur IV. Using an artificial soul to keep herself alive, she acts as a teacher to younger warriors when Soul Edge re-appears years later. The new timeline of Soulcalibur VI retells Ivy's creation of her sword, her servitude to Nightmare, and the revelation of her true father Cervantes. She also broke into the Money Pit guarded by Voldo to steal the notes of his master Vercci. Ivy later gave back the notes to the blind guardian after obtaining the information she needed. Outside of the main series, Ivy appears in the prequel Soulcalibur Legends, allying herself with the protagonist Siegfried, and shares an understanding with another of his allies, Lloyd Irving. In Soulcalibur: Broken Destinys \\"Gauntlet\\" storyline, a side story set after the events of Soulcalibur IV, Ivy assists the character Hilde and her party develop a cure for her father's ailment. When told that Cervantes' soul would be required as payment, they attempt to renegotiate, only for Ivy to use the protagonist's back as a chair while repeating her terms. She was also featured in as a guest character in Queen's Gate: Spiral Chaos, utilizing her character design from Soulcalibur IV. Designed as a weapon with the longest reach in Soulcalibur, Ivy's sword Valentine consists of several smaller blades linked together by a chain, able to take either broadsword or chain whip forms. These forms are represented by different stances Ivy can use in the series, altering many of her attacks for each and applying different uses to either form of the weapon, with some, such as Spiral Lust, a component of an existing attack. In addition to these, the sword can also have the segments be split apart, in which case they will attack the opponent in different ways before recombining on the sword's chain. Due to her variety, Ivy has been noted as being able to attack from any range, but also difficult to properly use unless utilizing a range the opponent is weakest at. Some of her attacks, such as Summoning Suffering and Calamity Symphony, involve grappling with the opponent to damage them, though these utilize complex controller inputs that require them to be utilized in tandem with other moves. =Promotion and merchandising= A promotional model for Soulcalibur V at IgroMir 2011 Ivy was featured amongst other characters for Soulcalibur II's arcade flyer, and has been featured in other printed advertisements for games in the series. She has appeared on the cover on every Sony-based console game in the series, as well as Soulcalibur Legends for the Nintendo Wii. She is visible on the white Xbox 360 Soulcalibur IV arcade joystick alongside Hilde and Siegfried, and the box art for Korean distributions of the lilac-colored PSP. In addition, the character has been used to demonstrate the graphical features of both Soulcalibur IV and its follow-up title, Broken Destiny in a tech demo and promotional flyer respectively. Ivy was also featured alongside Siegfried in a manga adaptation of Soulcalibur Legends printed in the Japanese sh≈çnen Kerokero Ace; the manga, written in a humorous tone, used a running gag of Siegfried's annoyance that Ivy was significantly taller than him. In 2011, the Russian publisher of Soulcalibur V 1C Company hired model Arina Ryabinina to portray the character at that year's IgroMir convention to promote the game's release. A 1999 advertisement for the Dreamcast port of Soulcalibur mainly focused on her visual appeal, depicting a man at a drive-in theater kissing his girlfriend but stopping to focus on Ivy. Two print advertisements for Soulcalibur V prominently featured close-up images of Ivy's cleavage and buttocks, respectively, along with puns about them, and were featured in various mainstream Japanese newspapers including Nikkan Sports. Several action figures and figurines have been made bearing Ivy's likeness. Following the release of Soulcalibur, a resin kit by Kurushima was released, alongside a figurine by Kyosho. Epoch C-Works released a 1/12 scale Ivy action figure of in a set of three for the title as well, featuring equipable weapons. In August 2003, Todd McFarlane Productions released an Ivy sculpture amongst a set of five based on Soulcalibur II. The immobile figure was modeled after her primary outfit and stood six inches tall with a base and retracted sword. Yujin released a four inch tall figurine based upon her Soulcalibur II artwork as part of their \\"Namco Girls Series #5\\" line of gashapon figurines. A twelve inch tall immobile PVC figurine modeled after her Soulcalibur III appearance was released by Enterbrain in September 2008, using a white version of her outfit and extended sword; a dark blue outfit for an \\"international color\\" version of the sculpture was also produced. Hobby Japan created a mail order exclusive 1/8 scale PVC figure of Ivy in 2011 in honor of her appearance in Queen's Gate: Spiral Chaos. In 2012, an Ivy bobblehead was created by toy company Bobble Budds depicting her in her standard outfit was given to those who pre-ordered both the regular and Collector's Edition versions of Soulcalibur V. Reception Although commonly cited as one of the most difficult characters to play as in the Soul series, Ivy has received a great deal of positive reception and has been described as one of the series' best characters, as well as one of the most important and memorable characters in fighting games overall. In a 2015 community poll on the official Soulcalibur Facebook page, Ivy was voted the fourth most popular character in the series among fans. Among the outlets that have ranked her among the top characters in the series are IGN, which ranked her second and stated \\"Few, if any, Soul fighters so aptly sum up what the series is about as Ivy Valentine,\\"; Complex, which ranked her seventh; Fanbyte, which ranked her ninth, saying she was the series' \\"poster girl\\" and called her a \\"squarely Machiavellian jerk\\"; and TheGamer, which ranked her sixth, praising her strength as a fighter. In 2009, she was featured on the cover of French magazine Ig alongside other female video game characters as one of the top heroines of gaming. Ivy was cited in the book \\"Disconnected America\\" as an example of Soulcalibur II's contrast to titles including Mortal Kombat and Street Fighter in terms of a comparable real-world experience. Play magazine called her one of the \\"finest females in all of 3D fighting\\", adding of the characters in the series she was the one they enjoyed playing as the most. Tom's Games named her one of the fifty greatest female characters in video game history, stating that as \\"an anti- hero who frequently clashes with other Souls, Ivy is a fascinating character for a fighting game\\". UGO.com placed her sixteenth on their list of the \\"Top 50 Evil Women\\", noting her role as an antagonist in the first Soulcalibur while adding that it could be \\"difficult to truly appreciate [her] villainy\\" due to her attractiveness, and adding that her appearance and attitude made her \\"a feared competitor\\". IGN also included her in their list of guest characters they would have liked to have seen for Super Smash Bros. Brawl. GameSpy named her one of the \\"25 Extremely Rough Brawlers\\" in video gaming, praising the brutality of her fighting style and weapon. GameDaily named her, among other female characters in the Soul series, as an example of a strong and iconic female character in video gaming. The New York Times felt her appearance came from the same \\"Goth cyberaesthetic [...] that gave us The Matrix\\", one they felt was already becoming outdated. UGO named her one of the top eleven girls of gaming at number ten and one of the top eleven video game heroines at number eight, stating \\"What can you say about a chick that carries a whip? If you're talking about Ivy from the Soul Calibur series, you could say she's pretty intimidating.\\" GameCentral said that Ivy is such a favorite of the series that \\"it‚Äôs impossible to imagine the game without [her]\\". =Sex appeal= Ivy's appearance, body, outfit, and demeanor have all been at the center of discussions about the character, and have led to her status as a fan favorite. She is commonly compared to or described as a dominatrix, and has been noted both as the series' sexiest female. She has been displayed in various third-party media, her likeness appearing in material including magazine swimsuit issue pin-ups and periodicals such as Play's annual \\"Girls of Gaming\\" series. Other media outlets have compared her and Lara Croft in terms of attractiveness and sexualization. Other sources have used her as a standard for a character archetype, comparing later created female characters to her design and appearance. From her Soulcalibur II appearance, Ivy was nominated in G4's 2004 G-Phoria awards show under \\"Hottest Character\\", alongside Vanessa Z. Schneider and Rikku; she was further a character in their 2005 Video Game Vixens awards show, winning in the category of \\"Kinkiest Accessory\\". Several other \\"Top Ten\\" lists have also featured Ivy in similar context, including those by Team Xbox, Machinima.com, and Spike TV. Ivy appeared several times in GameDaily's \\"Babe of the Week\\" series of articles, including as a stand-alone article and at eleventh place in their \\"Top 50 Hottest Game Babes\\" article. UGO.com ranked her eighteenth in their \\"Top 50 Videogame Hotties\\" article, stating \\"However much she instills fear in our hearts, we revel in the opportunity to stare at her from the safety of our television sets.\\" Reception of the character's sex appeal has been varied, however, with many outlets describing her outfit and appearance as oversexualized and unrealistic. In a 2016 study done by researchers at Indiana University, Ivy was found to be the most sexualized character out of 571 playable female video game characters created between 1989 and 2014. The study used a character's \\"nudity, over-enlarged breasts or hips and unrealistically narrow waists\\" as \\"signs of hypersexualization\\". Giant Bomb lists her as the most famous example of a sexualized woman in gaming. The book Game On: The History and Culture of Videogames cited Ivy as an example of realistic character design affected by \\"the Japanese 'deformed' aesthetic and the global influence of cartoon animation\\", noting she made characters such as Lara Croft look \\"positively monastic\\" by comparison. Race, Gender, Media: Considering Diversity Across Audiences, Content, and Producers used her as an example of most female characters in video games, describing her body and clothing as being created solely for the viewing pleasure of players, often males. Rachael Hutchinson, Assistant Professor of Japanese Studies at the University of Delaware, described her sexualized appearance and behavior as devices used by the developers to emphasize her above-average height compared to other female characters in the title as \\"deviant\\", justifying \\"social and cultural expectation regarding the female form\\" in the process. In an article on Kotaku, Gamasutra's Leigh Alexander used Ivy as a primary example of video game representations of the ideal male and female versus the real world and the concept that \\"sex sells\\", noting the unconscious appeal of such a character to represent oneself as in a game. One study on video games noted Ivy in the subject of games \\"growing up\\", discussing the increasing popularity of \\"video game babes\\" and the reactions of men and women towards them. Joystiq bemoaned her appearance in Soulcalibur IV, describing it as an extreme in lieu of games such as Dead or Alive Xtreme Beach Volleyball and noting that while a full redesign was unnecessary, \\"At least [Dead or Alive] keeps its breasts in context.\\" MSNBC described her attire as \\"the pinnacle of preposterous\\", noting that while it revolved around her femme fatale design, it appeared physically painful and made little sense to wear into combat. Former GameSpot editor Jeff Gerstmann described the alterations to her appearance for Soulcalibur IV as unnecessary, stating \\"boobs are awesome, but there's a line. Ivy is over this line.\\" GamesRadar content editor David Houghton described her alongside similar characters as \\"festering adolescent wank-fantasies\\", adding directly regarding Ivy \\"[t]his is not female empowerment\\", and in another article called her a \\"ludicrously designed caricature of female sexuality\\", and said that her relatively youthful appearance in Soulcalibur V despite being 49 years old was a \\"cop out\\" which was caused by the game's developers not wanting to give up on the \\"adolescent fap-value of [their] series poster girl\\". At the 2011 PAX East convention, an all-female journal panel led by The Escapists Susan Arendt agreed that while the character was strong and difficult but rewarding to master in the original Soulcalibur, she was reduced to \\"a nice ass bouncing around the room\\" in later games. Commenting on her appearance in Soulcalibur VI, Bleeding Cool's Gavin Sheehan stated, \\"Every time we see Ivy Valentine make an appearance in SoulCalibur, she just seems to be getting bustier and losing a thread or two more clothing than before,\\" while referring to her armor as \\"practically lingerie\\". Comicbook.com writer Matthew Hayes referred to her as a \\"scantily-clad boob monster\\". GameCentral called Ivy's outfit and design \\"a lot more problematic today than they were when the series began.\\" VentureBeat's Mike Minotti described Ivy as \\"mostly boobs and butt\\", and described her outfit and bust size as \\"outlandish\\". Sam Brooks of The Spinoff commented that Ivy \\"is wearing no clothes\\", and called her \\"unrealistically proportioned\\". Game Rant described her outfit in Soul Calibur VI as \\"scanty\\" and \\"dominatrix\\". Forbes's Paul Tassi said Ivy's \\"chest seems to get larger with each new installment of the game while her clothing shrinks\\". Leif Johnson of Vice said Ivy \\"barely manages to keep her body stuffed in her battle gear.\\" Michael McWhertor of Kotaku called her \\"Soulcaliburs most anatomically outrageous fighter\\", as well as \\"embarrassingly underdressed\\" and \\"exceedingly curvaceous\\". In contrast, British magazine CVG cited her appearance in Soulcalibur IV as appealing, stating \\"Ivy...we like because she barely wears anything. Yes, we like videogame girls.\\" IGN in their \\"Babes of Soulcalibur\\" article noted that while her outfit pushed the line even by game standards, they had no actual complaint towards that aspect of the character. Team Xbox emphasized that while her appearance played a factor in her allure, her fighting skills and unique weapon were significant as well, adding that \\"Ivy never disappoints in a swordfight\\". Leigh Alexander in an article for GameSetWatch noted that while characters such as Samus Aran served as \\"bastions of dignity\\", characters such as Ivy filled an important role in video games too, stating \\"[i]t looks like Ivy‚Äôs back is set to snap ‚Äì but she‚Äôs a game character; she‚Äôll be fine. Why not just enjoy it?\\" The Escapist noted that the character's behavior and sex appeal defined the character rather than serving as an extraneous aspect, stating \\"Ivy's oversexed dominatrix demeanor perfectly complements her confident, punishing move set.\\" UGO.com repeated the sentiment, noting in their \\"Top 11 Girls of Gaming\\" article \\"Soul Calibur's mega-bombastic whip- wielding hottie isn't the only babe in the game, or even the best- endowed...but her combination of sultry moves and revealing outfits shoots her up the charts.\\" In an examination of feminist viewpoints regarding women in gaming, comedian and writer Liana Kerzner cited Ivy as an example of misperception of an empowered female character, noting that when compared to characters such as Wonder Woman the latter was considered a positive character for being \\"empowered\\" despite sharing similar exposing outfits and physical builds. She further went on to state that the character was interesting for having \\"to fight her own flawed battle with no help from anyone\\", and that women passionate about gaming had more in common with the character: \\"aggressive, intimidating, combative, and scrabbling through life by sheer will, armed with homemade weapons\\". In an article for Kotaku, Maddy Myers, despite questioning Ivy's choice of outfit (\\"Why does this woman, who was raised by an aristocratic family, waltz around medieval Europe in lingerie and knee-high boots?\\"), suggested that although she is a \\"a sex symbol designed predominantly by men\\", and in spite of her lack of humanization, women who play as her can reclaim her. Myers also mentioned that the \\"inexplicably sexy designs\\" of characters like Talim and Seong Mi-Na, the two youngest characters in the series, are inappropriate, but get criticized far less than Ivy's design because of the size of her breasts. Paul Tassi of Forbes expressed similar sentiments, comparing her to series mainstay Mitsurugi, saying \\"But what makes Ivy's chest ridiculous while no one bats an eyelash and Misturugi's head-sized biceps? Both are genetic mutants, by any stretch of the imagination, but one is sexual, and the other isn't.\\" See also * List of Soulcalibur characters References Category:Fantasy video game characters Category:Female characters in video games Category:Fictional alchemists Category:Fictional British people in video games Category:Fictional flexible weapons practitioners Category:Fictional swordsmen in video games Category:Soulcalibur series characters Category:Video game characters introduced in 1998 Category:Video game nobility Category:Woman soldier and warrior characters in video games ","title":"Ivy Valentine"},{"id":"2443372","text":"Scrumpy Jack is a brand of dry cider, 6% Alcohol by volume.

He won multiple production awards, including the Countdown Producer of the Year. In the late 1980s he developed Parkinson's disease.  Early days  Born in Timaru, New Zealand, Dawkins started in the music business as a drummer in his teens; he toured Europe in the mid-1960s with his freakbeat bands Me and the Others, and The New Nadir. In London they jammed at The Speakeasy with Jimi Hendrix, which eventually led to the recording of a lost 7\\" acetate for the UK Polydor Records label. Over 40 years later, in 2009 a whole album of 1966 ‚Äì 1967 recordings by Me and the Others and The New Nadir was finally released by Feathered Apple Records. After the breakup of The New Nadir, guitarist and lead vocalist Ed Carter moved to California to play for the Beach Boys, bassist Gary Thain joined the Keef Hartley Band, and then Uriah Heep before dying of an overdose in 1975. Dawkins returned home in late 1968 and started his production career with HMV Records, the NZ branch of EMI, where he produced a large number of recordings, scoring seven No.1 pop hits including \\"Nature\\" by The Fourmyula.  Australia and the 1970s  Dawkins moved to Australia in c.1972 and became a house producer for EMI Australia, where he succeeded fellow New Zealand expatriate Howard Gable as the producer of leading Australian progressive rock band Spectrum, for whom he produced the albums Warts Up Your Nose (1972, released under the pseudonym 'Indelible Murtceps'), Testimonial (1973), and the valedictory live album Terminal Buzz. Around 1972/1973 he also produced early singles for John Farnham (then known as Johnny Farnham), including \\"Don't You Know It's Magic\\" and \\"Rock Me Baby\\". In the mid-seventies Dawkins produced Spectrum's successor Ariel, including their acclaimed albums A Strange Fantastic Dream (1973) and Rock 'n' Roll Scars (1974), which was recorded at Abbey Road Studios in London, and engineered by the legendary Geoff Emerick. During 1973 Dawkins also created, co-wrote, and produced The Star Suite (EMI Records), a concept album based on astrological themes, released under the name 'Patch', and featuring an all-star lineup of players that included members of Ariel and Tamam Shud, as well as leading Australian session musicians. In 1975 he moved briefly to Festival Records, where he worked with Billy Thorpe (including Thorpe's 1975 solo hit \\"It's Almost Summer\\"), before moving to CBS Records. He then produced a string of successful recordings, including hits for the expatriate New Zealand rock group Dragon and Melbourne band Australian Crawl, as well as reggae-rock group Billy T (which included former Daddy Cool guitarist Ross Hannaford), and hard rock group Rabbit, which was fronted by original AC/DC vocalist Dave Evans. During this period, Dawkins also produced several albums and hit singles by singer-songwriter Ross Ryan, including Ryan's signature hit \\"I Am Pegasus\\". Remarkably, Dawkins had to fight to get the song released as a single, over the vocal objections of Ryan's then manager, who loudly declared, \\"There is no way in the world that is going to be a hit!\\" In fact, the song reached No. 3 on the national chart. Dawkins also produced hit albums and singles for expatriate NZ band Mi-Sex, the Australian group Pseudo Echo, the hugely successful album-oriented rock group Air Supply, country music star Slim Dusty, singer-songwriter Russell Morris and rocker Billy Thorpe, amongst many others. (See discography below). In early 1976, at the urging of Ariel's Mike Rudd, Dawkins went to see the recently arrived NZ band Dragon at the Recovery Wine Bar in Camperdown, Sydney, and he was so impressed by their material (mostly written by keyboard player Paul Hewson) that he immediately signed them to a recording contract with CBS' subsidiary label, Portrait. Dawkins' productions for Dragon included the hit singles \\"This Time\\", \\"Are You Old Enough?\\" and \\"April Sun in Cuba\\", and the LPs Sunshine, Running Free and O Zambezi. His success led to a move to Los Angeles for a year in 1976. In 1978 he flew to a Holiday Inn club in Baltimore, Maryland, to see singer songwriter Tony Sciuto, and signed him on the spot to a CBS Record contract. (Island Nights EPIC 1980)  1980s, illness and onwards  While working as A&R; Manager at CBS Australia in 1980, Dawkins discovered the band Matt Finish and left CBS to start his first label, The Giant Recording Label. Subsequently, Giant released Matt Finish's enduring cult classics Short Note and Fade Away. Giant later signed Melbourne band Little Heroes. Dawkins produced Australian Crawl's album Sirocco, which went to No. 1 in Australia and earned four platinum records. He went on to be general manager of EMI Australia in the mid-1980s. In 1986 he was appointed general manager of music publisher J. Albert & Son, running its London office. The death of CEO Ted Albert precipitated Dawkins' return to Australia and another change of employment. In 1990 Dawkins opened Giant Studios Balmain, Sydney, and started his second label (through BMG) called Nova. The earlier Giant name was bought by Irving Azoff, who was starting a label in the United States with the same name. Dawkins' development of Parkinson's disease meant that he had to gradually cease work over the next few years, with the shut- down of the studio in the mid-1990s. In 2005 he was able to afford further medical treatment, deep brain stimulation, after extensive fund-raising by his friends in the music industry. As part of that effort, in 2006, Sony/BMG issued a compilation album of Dawkins' productions, For Pete's Sake,For Pete's Sake sonybmg.com.au which included the Matt Finish hit Short Note, and a new song, \\"Understand\\", written by Dawkins' son Paul and the late Matt Moffitt, and sung by the Little River Band's Glenn Shorrock. It was produced at Sony Studios in Sydney and mixed by noted engineer Richard Lush. The CD included liner notes by rock music historian Glenn A. Baker. Dawkins died on 3 July 2014, from injuries sustained in a fall.

Pami was once assumed to be Pimay, the third son of Shoshenq III who served as the \\"Great Chief of Ma\\" under his father. However, the different orthographies of their names (Pami vs. Pimay) prove that they were 2 different individuals. In addition, the name Pami translates as 'The Cat' in Egyptian whereas the name Pimay means 'The Lion.' Pami's name was mistakenly transcribed as Pimay by past historians based upon the common belief that he was Shoshenq III's son. This is now recognised to be an erroneous translation of this king's nomen/name which should rather be written as Pami. While a previous Dynasty 22 king held the title 'Great Chief of the Ma' before ascending the throne-namely Shoshenq I-Shoshenq III's son, Pimay, was a different man from king Pami because their names are different. Moreover, if Pimay did indeed outlive his father, he should have then succeeded his father as king rather than the obscure Shoshenq IV who is not attested as a son of Shoshenq III. Consequently, it seems certain that Shoshenq III outlived all of his sons through his nearly 4 decade long reign. While a minority of scholars hold to the traditional view that Pami was Pimay, a son of Shoshenq III by his wife Queen Djed-Bast-Es-Ankh, no archaeological evidence proves that Pami was ever a son of Shoshenq III. The different spelling and meanings of the word Pami and Pimay and the fact that Shoshenq III was actually succeeded by Shoshenq IV‚Äîrather than Pimay as was once thought‚Äîsuggest rather that Pami was a son of his obscure predecessor--Shoshenq IV instead.

The Year 2 II Peret day 1 Serapeum stela from Pami's reign states that 26 Years passed between Year 28 of Shoshenq III-the burial of the previous Apis Bull‚Äîand Year 2 of Pami. Pami's Highest Year Date was originally thought to be his 6th Year based on his Year 6 Serapeum stela. However, in 1998, Pierre Tallet, Susanne Bickel and Marc Gabolde from the University of Montpellier publishedTallet, P., Bickel, S. & Gabolde, M.

According to the article, the block is 2 cubits (104 cm) large and likely formed the right inside side of a doorway. The block is essentially an Annal document which postdates Pami's reign and was originally part of a larger monument which catalogued the deeds of various Twenty-second Dynasty pharaohs. However, only the section concerning Pami's reign has survived. It chronicles this king's Yearly donations both to the gods of the Great Temple of Heliopolis and to other local deities and temples in this city. While the ending of the block is damaged, a 7th Regnal Year can be clearly seen for Pami and a brief 8th Year in the lost or erased section is possible. In any event, his Highest Year Date is now his 7th Year and Pami would have reigned for almost seven full years based upon this document.

It is within the locality of Horn within the Shire of Torres. The town of Wasaga is on the north-western coast of the island (). In the , the locality of Horn had a population of 531 people. Geography The island is in area. Horn Island is the site of Horn Island Airport, which also serves Thursday Island. Therefore, it is a gateway for travellers to the mainland and outer islands. The present-day population consists of islanders drawn from all islands of the Torres Strait, as well as non-islanders. Residents travel daily by ferry across the Ellis Channel to Thursday Island for work and school. Shire of Torres is the local government authority, providing the island community's municipal services. History Horn Island is known as N≈ìrupai (colloquially Nurupai) to the Kaurareg people and was given its English name by Matthew Flinders in 1802. The town of Wasaga was named on 1 April 1971 by the Queensland Place Names Board after Wasaga Billy, the first leader of the Horn Island community. After the 1871 massacre on Prince of Wales Island (Muralag), remnants of the people settled here for a short while, until the government relocated the Kaurareg to Hammond Island (K≈ìriri), where they remained until 1922. These islands (along with the other islands in the group) are the lands of the Kaurareg, each island ‚Äì or parts thereof ‚Äì owned by different clans. The language of the Kaurareg is Kala Lagaw Ya, in the form of Kaiwalgau Ya (called Kauraraigau Ya [colloquial variant Kauraregau Ya] in the 19th century). Gold was mined on Horn Island in the 1890s. In the early 20th century, a town flourished as a result of the pearling industry, but declined when non-islander residents were evacuated to southern Queensland during World War II. A major Allied airbase, known as Horn Island Aerodrome, was constructed on the island and this was attacked several times by Japanese planes. The World War II airbase on Horn Island is described in Jack Woodward's historical biographies Under It Down Under and Singing for the Unsung. Woodward was a World War II RAAF wireless operator stationed on Horn Island. Church influence was the London Missionary Society up until 1915 when the Anglican Church assumed responsibility. In 1946, some of the Kaurareg (N≈ìrupai) people moved back from (Kubin) on Moa Island to Horn and settled here in present-day Wasaga Village at the western end of the island. In the late 1980s, gold was mined again and Horn saw the rapid expansion of its population and building activity, as land on neighbouring Thursday Island became scarce. The Horn Island State School opened on 1 February 1993. It became a campus of Tagai State College on 1 January 2007. At the , Horn Island had a population of 585 people. At the , Horn Island had a population of 539. Climate Horn Island has a very warm tropical savanna climate with consistently hot temperatures all year round. The wet season lasts from December to April and features high humidity and frequent heavy downpours. Horn Island is occasionally affected by tropical cyclones; however it is too close to the Equator for them to be a significant threat. The dry season runs from May to November, and features lower humidity and little rainfall. Horn Island has never recorded a minimum temperature below or a maximum temperature below .  Education  Tagai State College is a government primary and secondary (early childhood - year 12) school for boys and girls that operates 17 campuses throughout the Torres Strait.

He is considered one of the best miniaturists of the early 14th century. He worked primarily under the patronage of the royal court and is believed to have been responsible for the introduction of the arte nuovo of Giotto and Duccio to Northern Gothic art. His work shows a distinct influence of the Italian trecento art Duccio is credited with creating. His style is characterized by delicate figures rendered in grisaille, accented with touches of color. Pucelle's most famous works include The Hours of Jeanne d'Evreux, a private prayer book done as a royal commission for the queen of France, Jeanne d'√âvreux (c. 1324‚Äì28), which reflects the Maest√† (c. 1325) by Duccio in the Belleville Breviary. He is also credited with the Franciscan breviary believed to have once been owned by Blanche of France. His earliest documented work is believed to be the design for the great seal of the Confraternity of the Hospital of in Paris, indicating that Pucelle worked and designed in a variety of media ranging from enamels to stained glass. Pucelle's proto-Renaissance style is evident in The Hours of Jeanne d'Evreux, the Belleville Breviary and the Bible of Robert de Billyng, which all displayed such features as sculpturally modeled figures, three-dimensional treatment of space and a new form of psychological expression.

The Supreme Court consists of the Court of Appeal and the High Court. The Court of Appeal exercises appellate criminal and civil jurisdiction, while the High Court exercises both original and appellate criminal and civil jurisdiction. The Chief Justice, Judges of Appeal, Judicial Commissioners and High Court Judges are appointed by the President from candidates recommended by the Prime Minister. The prime minister must consult with the Chief Justice before recommending the judges. The current Chief Justice is Sundaresh Menon. In 2006, the subordinate courts initiated a pilot scheme to appoint specialist judges to the Bench. These judges will come from the legal profession and academia and the scheme is aimed at bringing additional expertise to the subordinate courts as well as giving practitioners and academics an insight to the workings of the judiciary of Singapore. Jury trials were abolished in 1969 and the Criminal Procedure Code was amended in 1992 to allow for trials of capital offences to be heard before a single judge. The Court of Appeal is Singapore's final court of appeal after the right of appeal to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in London was abolished in April 1994. The president has the power to grant pardons on the advice of the cabinet. Singapore practices the common law legal system, where the decisions of higher courts constitute binding precedent upon courts of equal or lower status within their jurisdiction, as opposed to the civil law legal system in the continental Europe. The current criminal code was preceded by the Indian Penal Code which was adopted when Singapore was a crown colony. In 2004, the US Department of State claimed that although Singapore's judicial system provides citizens with an efficient judicial process, the judiciary is largely compliant and the government often uses defamation suits or the threat of such actions to discourage public criticism and intimidate the press.. Judicial independence Singapore has a reputation for fairness and impartiality in commercial law, and is a popular jurisdiction for arbitration and trial in Southeast Asia. The Canadian case of Oakwell Engineering v. Enernorth Industries called into question this impartiality and raised the issue of whether the judgments of Singaporean courts are enforceable outside Singapore, but claims of links between the judiciary, business and the executive arm in Singapore which were alleged to suggest a real risk of judicial bias were dismissed in appeals to the Court of Appeal for Ontario and Canadian Supreme Court.K.C. Vijayan, \\"Payout Fight Over 'Biased Judiciary' Rejected: Firm's Final Bid to Canada's Highest Court Fails, so S'pore Court Judgment Stands\\", The Straits Times (27 January 2007). The United States Department of State claims the President of Singapore and the Minister for Home Affairs have substantial de facto judicial power, leading \\"to a perception that the judiciary reflected the views of the ruling party in politically sensitive cases.\\" In addition, Singapore's \\"judicial officials, especially the Supreme Court, have close ties to the ruling party and its leaders\\". The President appoints judges to the Supreme Court on the recommendation of the Prime Minister and in consultation with the Chief Justice (Article 95). The President also appoints subordinate court judges on the recommendation of the Chief Justice. Government leaders historically have used court proceedings, in particular defamation suits, against political opponents and critics, leading to a perception that the judiciary reflected the views of the ruling party in politically sensitive cases. Notable cases include those against opposition leaders J. B. Jeyaretnam and Chee Soon Juan. In 1997, Australian Q.C. Stuart Littlemore observed the proceedings of a high profile defamation suit filed by Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong against Jeyaretnam on behalf of the Geneva-based International Commission of Jurists (ICJ).. This was followed by his ICJ report stating that the Singapore judiciary was compliant to the ruling People's Action Party (PAP),. observations which the Ministry of Law denied,. and the ICJ subsequently defended.. Littlemore's application to represent Chee Soon Juan in 2002 for another defamation suit was rejected by the High Court for his previous remarks about the judiciary that were seen as contemptuous and disrespectful.Re Littlemore Stuart QC, [2002] SGHC 16, [2002] 1 S.L.R.(R.) 198, High Court (Singapore), archived from the original on 21 August 2017; . On the other hand, Transparency International noted in its 2006 country study report on Singapore that truth was a defence to the \\"accusations and insinuations of nepotism and favouritism in government appointments\\" against government leaders that led to the defamation suits, and \\"[a]s such, if a serious accusation is made, the public hearing of these suits would give the defendant a prime opportunity to put forward the facts they allege. However, none of the defendants have proved the truth of their allegations.\\". See also . Ranking 14 September 2008 Political and Economic Risk Consultancy (PERC) survey reported Hong Kong and Singapore have the best judicial systems in Asia, with Indonesia and Vietnam the worst: Hong Kong's judicial system scored 1.45 on the scale (zero representing the best performance and 10 the worst); Singapore with a grade of 1.92, followed by Japan (3.50), South Korea (4.62), Taiwan (4.93), the Philippines (6.10), Malaysia (6.47), India (6.50), Thailand (7.00), China (7.25), Vietnam (8.10) and Indonesia (8.26).

Volga-Volga () is a Soviet musical comedy directed by Grigori Aleksandrov, released on April 24, 1938. It centres on a group of amateur performers on their way to Moscow to perform in a talent contest called the Moscow Musical Olympiad. Most of the action takes place on a steamboat travelling on the Volga River. The lead roles were played by Alexandrov's wife, Lyubov Orlova, and Igor Ilyinsky. According to Orlova, the name of the film is taken from a popular Russian folk song, Stenka Razin, that Alexandrov sang while rowing with Charlie Chaplin in San Francisco Bay. Chaplin jokingly suggested the words as a title for a movie, but Alexandrov took it seriously and named his new film Volga-Volga. The feature was said to be Soviet Premier Joseph Stalin's favourite film. Nikita Khrushchev in his memoirs says that in the pre-World War II period Stalin laughed at him since he resembled a character from the film. In 1961, a new version of a movie was released, with the \\"Joseph Stalin\\" ship cut. In 2006, a colorization of the original black- and-white film began. The colorized version premiered on the Russian First Channel on February 14, 2010.  Background  Before Volga-Volga, Grigory Aleksandrov has created a script about a female taper (ballroom cinema pianist), Katya Muratova who can't find a better job after finishing conservatory studies. It was based on his wife Lyubov Orlova's biography. When the film is torn, and it was happening often in those days of silent films, it takes time to glue the tape, and the pianist has to fill the pauses in order to calm down the audience who is shouting \\"shoemakers!\\" and whistling in rage. So, the female pianist is playing classical music and it usually works. But once the projectionist, delighted with her performance, deliberately delays the gluing, and Katya Muratova performs the entire classical piece. The \\"pure\\" part of the public demanded to perform \\"the classics\\" instead of vulgar films, the other, of course, is against it. There is a fight. In the end, the cinema theatre was smashed to pieces, and the taper, as a result, was kicked out of work. Unfortunately, the original film script was never given a green light but the collision about the supporters of classical and contemporary music was transferred by the director to the film Volga-Volga, with the addition of angst and Lyubov Orlova playing the opposite of her Katya Muratova part.

MTSAT-1 and 1R were built by Space Systems/Loral. MTSAT-2 was built by Mitsubishi.  MTSAT-1 and GOES-9  = Launch failure = The launch of MTSAT-1, on a Japanese H-II rocket, failed on November 15, 1999 and the spacecraft was destroyed. GMS-5, the satellite MTSAT-1 was intended to replace, was decommissioned on April 1, 2003 leaving Japan without weather satellite imagery. = NOAA loan = To fill in the void, The United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) loaned the GOES-9 satellite to the JMA and repositioned it over 155¬∞ East on May 22, 2003.  MTSAT-1R  MTSAT-1R (also known as Himawari 6) was successfully launched on a H-IIA on February 26, 2005 and became partially operational on June 28, 2005 ‚Äî the aviation payload was not functional as two MTSATs are required for air traffic control. GOES-9 was decommissioned when MTSAT-1R came online in June 2005. Its solar sail counteracts the torque produced by sunlight pressure on the solar array. The trim tab on the solar array makes small adjustments to the torque balance. MTSAT-1R was decommissioned on December 4, 2015, due to fuel limitations.  MTSAT-2  MTSAT-2 (also known as Himawari 7) successfully launched on February 18, 2006 and is positioned at 145¬∞ East. The weather functions of MTSAT-2 were put into hibernation until the end of MTSAT-1R's life (5 years from launch). The transportation and communication functions of MTSAT-2 are utilized prior to that time. It was replaced by Himawari 8 on 7 July 2015. = Attitude control malfunction = On November 5, 2007 JMA announced a malfunction in the attitude control of MTSAT-2. Attitude control was restored November 7, 2007. The presumed cause of the malfunction was improper functioning of an attitude control thruster. A spare thruster was used to return the spacecraft to normal operation.  Ground segment  Ground stations for both satellites are located in Kobe and Hitachiota, Japan.

It was fought from 8 to 10 September 1965, when the Pakistan Army thrust its tanks and infantry into Indian territory, capturing the Indian town of Khem Karan 5 km from the International Border. The Indian troops retaliated, and after three days of bitter fighting, the battle ended with the Pakistani forces being repulsed near Asal Uttar. Factors that contributed to this were the fierce fight put up by the Indian army, conditions of the plains, better Indian tactics and a successful Indian strategy. This battle is compared with the Battle of Kursk in the Second World War for how it changed the course of the India Pakistan war of 1965 in India's favour. War historians, including Dr. Philip Towle, regard the Indian resistance near Khem Karan as one of the key turning points of the war, one which tilted the balance of the war in favour of India. Peter Wilson states that the defeat of Pakistan Army in the battle of Asal Uttar was one of the greatest defeats suffered by Pakistan forces in the course of the Indo-Pakistan war of 1965.  Battle  The battle is described as one the largest tank battles in history since the Battle of Kursk in World War II. Pakistan's invading force, consisting of the 1st Armoured Division and 11th Infantry Division, crossed the International Border and captured the Indian town of Khem Karan. Considering the situation, GOC Indian 4th Mountain Division (Maj. Gen. Gurbaksh Singh) immediately ordered the division to fall back and assume a horseshoe shaped defensive position with Asal Uttar as its focal point. The battle strategy was the brainchild of Brigadier Thomas K.Theograj.http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp- sundaymagazine/unsung-hero/article6797696.ecehttp://www.bharat- rakshak.com/ARMY/Galleries/Wars/1965/XI/0100.jpg.htmlhttp://www.bharat- rakshak.com/ARMY/Galleries/Wars/1965/XI/6517.jpg.html In the night, the Indian troops flooded the sugar cane field, and the next morning, the Pakistani tanks of the 1st Armoured Division, consisting mainly of M47 and M48 Patton tanks, were lured inside the horse-shoe trap. The swampy ground slowed the advance of the Pakistani tanks and many of them could not move because of the muddy slush. Over 100 Pakistani tanks mostly Pattons, and a few Shermans and Chaffees, were destroyed and another 40+ captured while the Indians, by their account, lost only 10 tanks during this counter offensive.  Conclusion  Despite the initial thrust of the Pakistani Army into Indian territory, the battle ended in a decisive Indian Victory. The commander of Pakistani forces Maj. Gen. Nasir Ahmed Khan was killed in action. According to military historian Steven Zaloga, Pakistan admitted that it lost 165 tanks during the 1965 war, more than half of which were knocked out during the \\"debacle\\" of Asal Uttar. Pervez Musharraf, later Army Chief of Staff and President of Pakistan, participated in this battle as a lieutenant of artillery in the 16 (SP) Field Regiment, 1st Armoured Division Artillery.

The Pride of Baltimore was a reproduction of a typical early 19th-century \\"Baltimore clipper\\" topsail schooner, a style of vessel made famous by its success as a privateer commerce raider and small but nimble warship in the War of 1812 (1812‚Äì1815), against British merchant shipping and a vastly superior world-wide British Royal Navy. Commissioned on May 1, 1977 by the 44th Mayor of Baltimore, William Donald Schaefer, in an elaborate public ceremony in the historic Inner Harbor watched by thousands of Baltimoreans and Marylanders, she spent nine years at sea logging over 150,000 miles, equivalent to six times around the globe. On May 14, 1986, the first Pride of Baltimore was lost at sea in the Caribbean Sea, and her captain and three of the crew died. The Pride of Baltimore II was commissioned as the successor and memorial to the Pride in 1988, sailing in the same Goodwill Ambassador role for the city of Baltimore, but its role has now expanded to also representing the State of Maryland and the \\"Land of Pleasant Living\\" in the Chesapeake Bay region. Pride II has sailed nearly 200,000 miles and visited over 200 ports in 40 countries in its now near three decades of voyages. Chasseur: The inspiration for the Pride of Baltimore The Pride of Baltimore was built as an authentic reproduction of an early nineteenth- century \\"Baltimore clipper\\" topsail schooner. She was not patterned after any particular vessel, but was rather designed as a typical \\"Baltimore Clipper\\" of the type in its heyday. She was indirectly named for the Baltimore-built topsail schooner Chasseur sailed by the privateer captain Thomas Boyle - Chasseur was known as the \\"Pride of Baltimore\\" and participated in the War of 1812 (1812‚Äì1815). One of the most famous of the American privateers, Captain Thomas Boyle sailed Chasseur out of Baltimore's waterfront historic neighborhood of Fells Point, where she had been launched from Thomas Kemp's shipyard in 1812. On his first voyage as master of Chasseur in 1814, Boyle sailed east to the British Isles, where he harassed British shipping and sent a notice to King George III by way of a captured merchant vessel declaring that the entire British Isles were under naval blockade by Chasseur alone. Despite its implausibility, this boast caused the British Admiralty to recall many warships of the Royal Navy back to the home waters from the Napoleonic Wars in Europe and more intense real blockade on the American east coast to guard merchant shipping in convoys. Chasseur captured or sank 17 vessels before returning home to Baltimore on 25 March 1815, three months after a peace treaty in Ghent, United Netherlands had been signed ending the War of 1812. Perhaps her most famous accomplishment was the capture of the schooner HMS St Lawrence. On the Chasseur's return to Baltimore, the national newspaper published in the city, Niles Weekly Register dubbed the vessel, her captain, and crew the \\"pride of Baltimore\\" for their achievement. The Pride of Baltimore = Baltimore‚Äôs Renaissance Begins = In 1975, after many years of slow decay and decline, Baltimore was struggling to reinvent itself as the center of business and commerce that the city had been previously. The old municipal piers 1 through 6 along East Pratt Street around the north shore of the former \\"Basin\\" of the Northwest Branch of the Patapsco River, now rechristened \\"Inner Harbor\\" had been cleared in 1971 of their warehouses and buildings and rebuilt and by 1974, a new Pier 1, renamed \\"Constellation Dock\\" was constructed providing a new centerpiece home for the ancient warship sloop U.S.S. Constellation of 1854 to be moored /anchored for future visitors. A brick sidewalk promenade was built around the water's edge on the new extended bulkheads on the west shores along rerouted and rebuilt Light and South Calvert Streets, and the south shore below landmark Federal Hill Park, and running down the sides of the Pratt Street Piers 1 - 6. Citizens were beginning to discover, especially after the \\"Operation Sail\\" event of visiting sailing \\"tall ships\\" for the American Bicentennial celebration in the summer of 1976, that the harbor could become a magnet for people and recreation, as it had once been a magnet for shipping and trade. But something was still missing - a symbol, a trademark, an icon to link Baltimore to its harbor. City officials cast about for possibilities and an idea eventually emerged that captured the theme. Former Mayor, Governor and Comptroller William Donald Schaefer credits then city Housing Commissioner Robert \\"Bob\\" Embrey with the idea \\"Let's build a ship in the Inner Harbor to draw folks downtown.\\" With that seminal thought, a great sailing adventure and tradition was launched that would soon catapult Baltimore back into the imagination of the nation and the world as the home of adventurous seamen and romantic ships. A name was soon selected, a choice so natural as to be almost automatic - Pride of Baltimore. The name captured the spirit of the phoenix-like town. It also tapped into her maritime heritage since \\"Pride of Baltimore\\" was the nickname of the \\"Chasseur\\", the largest and boldest of the legendary, Baltimore-built topsail schooners known as \\"Baltimore clippers\\" that participated in the War of 1812, the second conflict with the British, that first launched the city as a commercial and maritime center. =Construction and service= In 1975, the City of Baltimore adopted a proposal from Charles Center-Inner Harbor Management for the construction of a replica sailing vessel as a centerpiece of the redevelopment of its Inner Harbor. The city requested proposals for \\"an authentic example of an historic Baltimore Clipper\\" to be designed and built using \\"construction materials, methods, tools, and procedures... typical of the period.\\" A topsail schooner design by Thomas Gillmer was chosen, and master shipwright Melbourne Smith oversaw the construction of the vessel next to the Maryland Science Center on the western shoreline of the Inner Harbor (the historic former \\"Basin\\" of the Northwest Branch of the Patapsco River / Baltimore Harbor and Port). During construction, residents and visitors/tourists could watch the craftsmen working with tools and techniques of two centuries earlier. U.S. Representative (Congresswoman) Barbara Mikulski of Baltimore, (who grew up in Fells Point, the nearby waterfront neighborhood where many Baltimore clippers were built 180 years earlier), performed the launching ceremonies on February 27, 1977, only 10 months after the start of construction. Mayor William Donald Schaefer (1922‚Äì2011, served 1971‚Äì1987), commissioned the Pride of Baltimore on behalf of the citizens of the City of Baltimore and the State of Maryland, two months later on May 1, 1977. The Pride sailed over during her nine years of service, visiting ports along the Eastern Seaboard from Newfoundland to the Florida Keys, the Great Lakes of North America, the Caribbean Sea and the West Coast along the Pacific Ocean from Mexico to British Columbia in Canada. She visited European ports across the Atlantic Ocean in the North Sea, the Baltic Sea and the Mediterranean Sea. =Sinking= On May 14, 1986, a microburst squall, possibly a white squall, struck the Pride while she was returning from the Caribbean, north of Puerto Rico. Winds of hit the vessel, capsizing and sinking her. Her captain and three crew died; the remaining eight crewmembers floated in a partially inflated life-raft for four days and seven hours with little food or water until the Norwegian tanker Toro came upon them and rescued them. A memorial on Rash Field in Baltimore's Inner Harbor memorializes the Pride's captain, Armin Elsaesser 42, and crewmembers Vincent Lazarro, 27, engineer; Barry Duckworth, 29, carpenter; and Nina Schack, 23, seaman. Pride of Baltimore II = Origins = After the sinking of the original Pride in May 1986, the Board of Directors of the non-profit public / private agency that operated Pride for the City were reluctant to build a replacement, but an outpouring of unsolicited financial support from the public encouraged the Board into going forward with a new ship. By late summer of 1986, plans for a replacement were under way. The ship was to be named Pride of Baltimore II and serve as a sailing memorial to the original Pride. She was to be another \\"Baltimore Clipper\\" topsail schooner that would continue the mission of the first ship. With an insurance payment of just under $500,000, along with a state grant of $1 million, and various contributions from private citizens, students, corporations, and foundations of over $2.5 million, sufficient funds were available to build a new ship and endow an operating fund.http://pride2.org/pride-of-baltimore-ii/history-of-pride/ = Construction and service = Thomas Gillmer was once again commissioned as designer and supervising architect. Peter Boudreau, one of the builders and captains of the original vessel, was named as master shipwright and builder. Guided by the experience of the original Pride, the Board determined that this vessel could better fulfill the mission of Globe-trotting Ambassador that had evolved over the years if she was larger and had more cruising range both under sail and under power. It was also determined that Pride II would have additional modern safety features so as to be licensed by the United States Coast Guard as a subchapter \\"T\\" vessel approved for carrying passengers. With these guidelines in hand, designer Gillmer set out to create a new Pride that would look much like the original on the outside but have more contemporary amenities and safety features below deck. Like the original Pride, the Pride II is not a replica of a specific vessel, and, although it represents a type of vessel known as a \\"Baltimore Clipper\\", it was built to contemporary standards for seaworthiness and comfort but like its predecessor, is a topsail schooner. On May 3, 1987, the keel was laid in Baltimore's Inner Harbor, and Pride of Baltimore II soon began to take shape in the temporary shipyard set up along the waterfront with its progress watched and monitored by thousands of daily tourists and citizen visitors. The keel and all the other framing and planking materials were shaped out of Central American hardwoods from Belize. On this ship, modern power tools and techniques were used to speed construction. When onlookers periodically opined that \\"Them 19th century shipbuilders sure didn't use no kinda power tools,\\" shipwright Leroy Suroski correctly pointed out, \\"They woulda if they woulda had 'em.\\" Built in the iconic \\"Baltimore Clipper\\" style, Pride II has heavily raked masts, and has 10 sails, she carries two large gaff sails (one on a boom and one loose-footed), a main gaff topsail, three headsails, and a square topsail and flying topgallant on the foremast. Also rare on modern traditional sailing vessels, she flies studding sails (stun's'ls), additional sails set along the edge of the square topsail and the gaff mainsail on temporary spars known as stun's'l booms. Pride II also carries a very unusual sail known as a ring-tail, set like a studding sail off the main boom and main gaff. Over two decades later in its storied career, on September 5, 2005, the Pride of Baltimore II suffered a complete dismasting while sailing in a squall in the Bay of Biscay off the western coast of France. The ship returned to port under motor power for repairs. Until 2010, the Pride of Baltimore II was owned by the citizens of the state of Maryland and operated by Pride of Baltimore, Inc., a private, nonprofit organization. Ownership was transferred to the ship's nonprofit operator with unanimous approval by Maryland's state governmental Board of Public Works on June 9, 2010.

He was born at Old Hill in Staffordshire.Telegraph, 95 Palmer also played one Test match for England. He later went on to become a respected cricket administrator. He was awarded his CBE in 1984 for services to cricket in the Queen's Birthday Honours. Life and career Palmer was a small man (five foot seven inches tall, only a slight build) with poor eyesight who played wearing glasses. Trevor Bailey joked that he looked \\"a natural for the role of a hen-pecked bank clerk in a farce\\".Telegraph, 93 This did not stop him becoming a fine batsman and slow medium bowler because he \\"possessed deceptively strong wrists\\" which enabled him to play shots like the cut and drive with excellent timing.Telegraph, 93 Palmer first played cricket for Worcestershire in 1938, before World War II and a teaching career intervened, although he still played a few games for the Bombay Europeans in Indian domestic cricket in 1946, with some games for Worcestershire. In 1948, he scored 85 in a morning's play against Don Bradman's Australian tourists (the \\"Invincibles\\") with Ray Lindwall and Keith Miller both bowling. Bradman praised his effort but it did not bring a test match selection at that time. Palmer did tour South Africa with MCC in 1948‚Äì49 but didn't play in any of the tests there. He joined Leicestershire as captain and secretary in 1950, and passed 1,000 runs in each of the eight full seasons he played for them. In 1953, Leicestershire finished third in the County Championship, the highest they had achieved at that stage since entering the competition in 1895. As late as August that season, the team were top of the table for the first time ever and Palmer was praised as: \\"A leader without flourish, but indeed a leader\\".Wisden Obituary On the back of this, he was appointed player-manager of the England tour side to the West Indies in 1953-54, which was captained by Len Hutton, and it was here that he won his only Test cap, making 22 and 0 and taking no wickets in the five overs he bowled. The series was played in bad temper, but Palmer's good-natured style helped the situation. Palmer played two memorable innings for the Gentlemen versus the Players in matches at Lord's in 1952 and 1955, scoring 127 and 154 against some of the best bowlers in the country.Telegraph, 93 In 1955, Palmer was responsible for one of the most remarkable spells of bowling in cricketing history. Putting himself on to bowl against Surrey to allow his main two bowlers to change ends, he took 8 wickets for 7 runs, with his figures at one stage being 12-12-0-8. Ironically, his figures were \\"spoiled\\" by Jim Laker whose eight for two in 1950 is the world record return by a bowler taking eight wickets. A catch was dropped from a swing by Laker which deprived Palmer of a nine for none return and Laker then managed to edge a few more so that Palmer finished with eight for seven. Even worse for Palmer was that Surrey still won the match by seven wickets.Telegraph, 94 A curiosity of Palmer's bowling was his fascination with what is called the \\"donkey drop\\". This is usually an accidental delivery that flies high because the ball has been released too soon. Palmer used it deliberately, sending it twenty feet or so high with the intention of it dropping behind the batsman and onto his stumps. It sometimes paid off and in 1957 when leading Leicestershire against the touring West Indians, Palmer claimed the wickets of no less than Frank Worrell and Rohan Kanhai with it.Telegraph, 95 After retiring as a cricketer, Palmer was appointed chairman of Leicestershire, he became a member of the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) committee, was President of the MCC in 1978‚Äì79, and chairman of the Test and County Cricket Board between 1983 and 1985.

History St Mary's Church, also in Whittall Street The firm of Pursall and Phillips operated a 'percussion cap manufactory' at Whittall Street, in Birmingham, in the mid 19th century. In 1856, Scottish entrepreneur George Kynoch joined the company. An explosion in 1859 destroyed the works, killing 19 of the 70 employees. As a result, the firm moved to Witton in 1862, on a site adjacent to the London and North Western Railway's Grand Junction line. In 1863, Kynoch took over the business, which was subsequently renamed G. Kynoch and Co. A further series of explosions in the 1860s and in 1870 led to dozens of deaths and hundreds of injuries. In 1895 Kynoch built an explosives factory east of Shell Haven Creek, Essex (now known as Coryton). This opened in 1897, with an estate for employees called Kynochtown. Products included cordite, guncotton, gunpowder, and cartridges.Henry W. Macrosty. (1907). The Trust Movement In British Industry. The Chemical Industries. (p. 166). Batoche Books. After World War I many of the UK ammunition and explosives manufacturers were brought together under Nobel Explosives to become Nobel Industries, which was a founding element of Imperial Chemical Industries Ltd (ICI) in 1926. Once Nobel Industries, including Kynoch Ltd, had merged to form ICI,The Metals Division of ICI, ICI, Birmingham, 1950 : p4 the original Kynoch factory in Witton became the head office and principal manufacturing base of the \\"ICI Metals Division\\". Kynoch, along with names such as Eley, became brands of subsidiaries. Kynoch, established a munitions factory on the north side of Arklow, Ireland. This factory employed several thousand workers during World War I, but closed shortly after it, all production being moved to South Africa. Seventeen workers were killed in an explosion there on 21 September 1917. It was believed that the plant was shelled by a German U-boat During the 1950s, the sound of test firing of munitions still occasionally shattered the peace over Witton, but with the standardization of cartridges across the Western powers and a general downturn in ammunition requirements, the sidelines in sporting cartridges were discontinued by Imperial Metal Industries (IMI) in 1970. IMI became independent of ICI in 1977, still producing rimfire and shotgun cartridges for the sporting markets. The more economically viable production of shotgun and rimfire ammunition continued. The Ammunition Division was incorporated separately as Eley Limited in 1983. Kynoch has reopened in 2002 under the name Kynamco producing big game rifle ammunition from 6.5x54 to 700 nitro express and is situated at Mildenhall in Suffolk England  The Kynoch Press  The Kynoch Press was founded as a company press in 1876 to print packaging. To manage publicity, the company set it up as a fine press, which, when Kynoch became part of ICI in 1926, continued as a division and kept its name, The Kynoch Press.

After his resignation in 716, he still had great influence inside the imperial government, and his opinions often influenced the decisions of Emperor Xuanzong and the succeeding chancellors.  Background  Yao Chong was born in 650, during the reign of Emperor Gaozong. His father Yao Shanyi (ÂßöÂñÑÊÑè) served Emperor Gaozong's father Emperor Taizong as the commandant at Xi Prefecture (Â∑ÇÂ∑û, roughly modern Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture, Sichuan). Yao Chong himself started his civil service career serving as an attendant to Emperor Gaozong's son and crown prince Li Hong, and was known for being able to write quickly. He later served as the food supply officer at Pu Prefecture (ÊøÆÂ∑û, roughly modern Heze, Shandong). He was then moved in his office five times and eventually became Xiaguan Langzhong (Â§èÂÆòÈÉé‰∏≠), a low-level official at the ministry of defense.  During Wu Zetian's reign  During the Khitan invasion of 696-697, Yao Chong was serving at the ministry of defense, when there was much emergency paperwork due to the Khitan invasion. Yao conducted the official business with efficiency and gave much useful comments when he processed the paperwork. This impressed Emperor Gaozong's wife Wu Zetian, then \\"emperor\\" (the only woman with that title in Chinese history) of her Zhou Dynasty, and she gave him an unusually steep promotion to be the deputy minister of defense (Â§èÂÆò‰æçÈÉé, Xiaguan Shilang). In 697, after Wu Zetian's secret police official Lai Junchen, who had been responsible for falsely implicating many officials in treason accusations and executing them, was himself executed, Wu Zetian made a comment that after Lai's death, she had not heard of any accusations of treason. Yao pointed out that Lai, along with other secret police officials, had been making false accusations, and that he believed that in the future there would not be any treason accusations at all. Pleased with Yao's comment, she awarded him money. In 698, Wu Zetian gave Yao the designation Tong Fengge Luantai Pingzhangshi (ÂêåÈ≥≥Èñ£È∏ûËá∫Âπ≥Á´†‰∫ã), making him a chancellor de facto, probably at the recommendation of the senior chancellor Di Renjie. In 702, Wu Zetian considered launching a campaign against Eastern Tujue, and she put her son Li Dan the Prince of Xiang in command of the army, assisted by her family members Wu Sansi the Prince of Liang, Wu Youning the Prince of Jianchang, and the chancellor Wei Yuanzhong. Yao Yuanchong was to serve as secretary general for Li Dan on this campaign, but eventually the campaign was not launched. Around this time, there was an ethnic Tujue chieftain named Zhali Yuanchong (ÂêíÂà©ÂÖÉÂ¥á) who rebelled against Zhou. Wu Zetian did not want Yao to share a name with Zhali, and therefore had him use his courtesy name of Yuanzhi. In 704, Yao, who was by that point Fengge Shilang (È≥≥Èñ£‰æçÈÉé), the deputy head of the legislative bureau of government (È≥≥Èñ£, Fengge), citing the fact that his mother was old, requested to be relieved of his office so that he could attend to his mother. In summer 704, Wu Zetian made him Li Dan's secretary general, but allowed him to have the salary and prestige as officials of the third rank (i.e., chancellors‚Äîwhile the secretary general for an imperial prince was only ordinarily fourth rank, second division, first classNew Book of Tang, vol. 49, part 2.). Less than a month later, she made him also the minister of defense (Â§èÂÆòÂ∞öÊõ∏, Xiaguan Shangshu) and chancellor de facto again, with the greater designation of Tong Fengge Luantai Sanpin (ÂêåÈ≥≥Èñ£È∏ûËá∫‰∏âÂìÅ). However, he declined the post of minister of defense, explaining that while he was serving Li Dan, for him to be in command of the army would hurt Li Dan (i.e., possibly bring suspicions on Li Dan). Therefore, Wu Zetian instead made him the minister of rites (Êò•ÂÆòÂ∞öÊõ∏, Chunguan Shangshu). Around this time, Wu Zetian's lover Zhang Yizhi wanted to move 10 senior Buddhist monks from the capital Luoyang to a temple that he had built in Ding Prefecture (ÂÆöÂ∑û, roughly modern Baoding, Hebei). These monks did not wish to go and petitioned Yao, who ruled that the monks did not have to go, despite repeated requests by Zhang. Zhang therefore spoke to Wu Zetian against Yao, and Yao was demoted to be the minister of husbandry (Âè∏ÂÉïÂçø, Sipu Qing), although he remained chancellor. Soon, Wu Zetian, while letting Yao remain chancellor, made him the commanding general of the army at Lingwu, apparently again contemplating a campaign against Eastern Tujue. Before Yao departed for Lingwu, Wu Zetian met him personally and asked him to recommend someone who is suitable for being chancellor, and Yao recommended Zhang Jianzhi. She then made Zhang Jianzhi chancellor. In spring 705, while Yao was still away from Luoyang, Wu Zetian was ill, and the affairs of state were largely decided by Zhang Yizhi and his brother Zhang Changzong, also Wu Zetian's lover, and there were rumors that Zhang Yizhi and Zhang Changzong were planning on formally seizing power. Zhang Jianzhi, distressed over the situation, entered into a plot with other officials Cui Xuanwei, Jing Hui, Huan Yanfan, and Yuan Shuji, as well as the generals Li Duozuo and Li Dan (ÊùéÊπõ, note different character than the Prince of Xiang), to carry out a coup. Once Yao returned from Lingwu, Zhang Jianzhi and Huan discussed the plot with him, and he joined the plot. Soon, the coup was carried out, and Zhang Yizhi and Zhang Changzong were killed. Wu Zetian, while still carrying the title of emperor, was forced to yield the throne to her son Li Xian the Crown Prince (formerly emperor), and Li Xian was restored to the throne as Emperor Zhongzong. For his participation in the coup, Yao was created the Marquess of Liang.  During Emperor Zhongzong's second reign  Soon, Wu Zetian was moved from the main palace to the secondary palace Shangyang Palace (‰∏äÈôΩÂÆÆ), under heavy guard, although Emperor Zhongzong still honored her with the title of Emperor Zetiandasheng (ÂâáÂ§©Â§ßËÅñÁöáÂ∏ù, from which \\"Wu Zetian,\\" by which she was later known, was derived). When she was moved, most officials celebrated, but Yao Yuanzhi wept bitterly. Huan Yanfan and Zhang Jianzhi told him, \\"This is no time for you to cry. It may be that today is the start of a disaster for you.\\" Yao responded: Huan and Zhang Jianzhi thereafter demoted Yao to be the prefect of Bo Prefecture (‰∫≥Â∑û, roughly modern Bozhou, Anhui). Perhaps because of this, he survived the subsequent reprisal that Emperor Zhongzong later carried out at the suggestion of his cousin Wu Sansi (Wu Zetian's nephew) against the coup leaders in 706, and he later was made the prefect of Chang Prefecture (Â∏∏Â∑û, roughly modern Changzhou, Jiangsu), then Yue Prefecture (Ë∂äÂ∑û, roughly modern Shaoxing, Zhejiang), then Xu Prefecture (Ë®±Â∑û, roughly modern Xuchang, Henan).  During Emperor Ruizong's second reign  In 710, Emperor Zhongzong died suddenly‚Äîa death that traditional historians believed to be a poisoning carried out by his wife Empress Wei and daughter Li Guo'er the Princess Anle so that Empress Wei, like Wu Zetian, could become \\"emperor\\" and Li Guo'er could become crown princess. For the time, however, Emperor Zhongzong's son by a concubine, Li Chongmao the Prince of Wen, became emperor (as Emperor Shang), with Empress Wei as empress dowager and regent. Less than a month later, a coup led by Emperor Zhongzong's sister Princess Taiping and Li Dan's son Li Longji the Prince of LInzi killed Empress Wei and Li Guo'er. Emperor Shang was deposed, and Li Dan, himself a former emperor, became emperor again (as Emperor Ruizong). Emperor Ruizong recalled Yao Yuanzhi, then serving as the prefect of Xu Prefecture, to the central government to serve as the minister of defense (now with the changed title of Bingbu Shangshu (ÂÖµÈÉ®Â∞öÊõ∏)) and gave him the chancellor designation of Tong Zhongshu Menxia Sanpin (Âêå‰∏≠Êõ∏ÈñÄ‰∏ã‰∏âÂìÅ). He and another chancellor, Song Jing, were said to be concentrating on ending the problematic policies of Emperor Zhongzong's reign, including reforming the civil service system and removing officials who had improperly received offices by bribing powerful people at court. In particular, one abuse he and Song sought to reverse was how Emperor Zhongzong had commissioned several thousands of officials without review by the examination bureau (ÈñÄ‰∏ãÁúÅ, Menxia Sheng), which was in charge of reviewing imperial edicts, and at their requests, Emperor Ruizong removed these officials from their offices. (Because Emperor Zhongzong signified that a review by the examination bureau was not necessary by sealing the envelopes containing the commissions in a slanted manner, these officials were known as the \\"slanted-sealed officials\\" (ÊñúÂ∞ÅÂÆò).) Later that year, Yao was made Zhongshu Ling (‰∏≠Êõ∏‰ª§) -- the head of the legislative bureau (now named Zhongshu Sheng (‰∏≠Êõ∏ÁúÅ)) and a post considered one for a chancellor. Meanwhile, Li Longji, while he was not Emperor Ruizong's oldest son or born of his wife, the deceased Empress Liu, was made crown prince after Emperor Ruizong's return to the throne because of his accomplishment in the coup against Empress Wei. He soon frequently clashed with his aunt Princess Taiping, however, on matters of politics, and Princess Taiping tried to spread the sentiment that Li Longji should not be crown prince, and that his older brother Li Chengqi the Prince of Song, who was born of Empress Liu, or his cousin Li Shouli the Prince of Yong (the son of Emperor Ruizong's older brother Li Xian (note different character than Emperor Zhongzong)) should be crown prince. In 711, Song and Yao, trying to end to political uncertainty, suggested sending Li Chengqi and Li Shouli out of the capital Chang'an to serve as prefectural prefects, while sending Princess Taiping and her husband Wu Youji (Wu Zetian's nephew) to settle in the eastern capital Luoyang. Emperor Ruizong accepted the suggestion except as to Princess Taiping's place of settlement (sending her to the closer Pu Prefecture (Ëí≤Â∑û, roughly modern Yuncheng, Shanxi) rather than Luoyang). When Princess Taiping found out, however, she complained bitterly to Li Longji, and Li Longji, in fear, publicly requested that the orders be rescinded and that Song and Yao be put to death for alienating him from his aunt, brother, and cousin. In response, Emperor Ruizong cancelled the orders and demoted both Song and Yao to be prefectural prefects‚Äîin Yao's case, to be the prefect of Shen Prefecture (Áî≥Â∑û, roughly modern Xinyang, Henan). He was then moved several times in his office, to be the prefect of Xu Prefecture (ÂæêÂ∑û, roughly modern Xuzhou, Jiangsu‚Äîa different Xu Prefecture than where he had served before) and then Lu Prefecture (ÊΩûÂ∑û, roughly modern Changzhi, Shanxi). He was then made the secretary general at Yang Prefecture (ÊèöÂ∑û, roughly modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu), and was said to have governed it so well that the people built a monument dedicated to him. Eventually, he became the prefect of Tong Prefecture (ÂêåÂ∑û, roughly modern Weinan, Shaanxi).  During Emperor Xuanzong's reign  In 712, Emperor Ruizong passed the throne to Li Longji (as Emperor Xuanzong), but, at Princess Taiping's suggestion, retained most imperial powers as Taishang Huang (retired emperor). In 713, after Emperor Xuanzong, claiming that Princess Taiping was planning to kill him, carried out a reprisal against her, forcing her to commit suicide and executing many of her associates, Emperor Ruizong transferred his authorities to Emperor Xuanzong. In winter 713, Emperor Xuanzong carried out a major review of troops at Xinfeng (Êñ∞Ë±ê, in modern Xi'an, Shaanxi), during which, due to the ceremony not being properly organized as it was supposed to be, he removed and exiled the chancellor Guo Yuanzhen, who was also minister of defense. While at the ceremony, Emperor Xuanzong met a number of prefectural prefects, including Yao Yuanzhi, who personally made 10 suggestions of how he should govern (now known in Chinese as ÂçÅ‰∫ãË¶ÅË™™), and Emperor Xuanzong considered making Yao chancellor. The chancellor Zhang Yue, jealous of Yao, initially had the imperial censor Zhao Yanzhao submit articles of impeachment against Yao, but when that failed, had the official Jiang Jiao (ÂßúÁöé), a close associate of Emperor Xuanzong, suggest that Yao should be made the commandant at Hedong (Ê≤≥Êù±, in modern Yuncheng) -- which made Emperor Xuanzong suspicious that Zhang was behind the recommendation, and Jiang admitted that that was the case. The next day, Emperor Xuanzong summoned Yao to his presence and made him minister of defense and chancellor with the designation Tong Zhongshu Menxia Sanpin, and created him the Duke of Liang. It was said that Yao was experienced and quick in his reaction, and that he had great knowledge of military matters. It was also said that he, more than other chancellors, took much effort to take responsibility for important matters, and thus was well-trusted by Emperor Xuanzong, who delegated the matters to him. (However, the biographies of other chancellors and key officials at the time also suggested that Yao was jealous of them and took actions to remove them from power by making false accusations against them‚Äîincluding Zhang, Liu Youqiu, and Zhong Shaojing, accusing Zhang of improper association with Emperor Xuanzong's brother Li Fan (ÊùéÁØÑ) the Prince of Qi and accusing Liu and Zhong of complaining against Emperor Xuanzong for not giving them more important positions.See, e.g., New Book of Tang, vol. 121 [biographies of Liu Youqiu and Zhong Shaojing].) Around that time, Yao also stopped using the name Yuanzhi‚Äîinitially changing back to Yuanchong, but then, because Emperor Xuanzong's era name was Kaiyuan, removed \\"Yuan\\" from his name and went by the name of Chong. Emperor Xuanzong also made him again the head of the legislative bureau (now with the title Ziwei Ling (Á¥´ÂæÆ‰ª§), with the bureau itself renamed Ziwei Sheng (Á¥´ÂæÆÁúÅ)). Around that time, many men took tonsure to be Buddhist monks in order to avoid taxation and labor. In 714, Yao, pointing out that veneration of Buddhist monks did nothing to save Later Zhao, Later Qin, Northern Qi, and Liang Dynasty, suggested that Emperor Xuanzong order a thorough review of the ranks of Buddhist monks and nuns and force those who were not truly devout to return to civilian life and be subject to taxation and labors. Some 12,000, as a result, were forced to return to civilian life. Meanwhile, however, when Yao spoke against a campaign that the general and fellow chancellor Xue Na advocated against the Khitan, Emperor Xuanzong did not listen to him and had Xue attack Khitan anyway. (Xue's campaign eventually ended in failure in fall 714.) Yao and his fellow chancellor Lu Huaishen, meanwhile, also did much to try to eliminate the culture of the nobles exerting influence in civil service matters. By this time, however, Yao was himself nearly caught in a scandal involving his sons' trying to influence the civil service system. Yao's fellow chancellor Wei Zhigu had previously been a subordinate of Yao's who had become progressively promoted to become chancellor with Yao. Yao had once offended Wei because he asked Wei to review the civil service commissions at Luoyang‚Äîbut then had Song Jing, who was then the minister of civil service affairs, carry out a further review of Wei's actions. Meanwhile, while Wei was at Luoyang, two sons of Yao's, who were officials at Luoyang, because of the relationship that Yao and Wei previously had, accepted bribes from others and tried to influence Wei in his actions. After Wei returned to Chang'an, he reported this to Emperor Xuanzong‚Äîwho then, on another occasion, tried to discreetly figure out the situation by asking Yao about his sons‚Äîand Yao, realizing what must have happened, indicated that it must be the case that his sons improperly tried to influence Wei. Emperor Xuanzong, in turn, became impressed that Yao was willing to admit this and displeased that Wei had tried to remove a former superior, initially wanting to exile Wei. At Yao's insistence that that not happen, he only removed Wei as a chancellor and made him the minister of public works (Â∑•ÈÉ®Â∞öÊõ∏, Gongbu Shangshu). After Wei's removal (along with Xue's, after the defeat against Khitan), Yao and Lu were the only remaining chancellors, and Yao bore the brunt of the responsibilities. It was said that in 715, when Yao had to take about half a month of vacation due to his son's death, the important affairs stacked up at the legislative bureau, which Lu was unable to handle, and that once Yao returned from vacation, he was able to handle the matters quickly. Lu, realizing that he was not as capable as Yao, usually yielded to Yao in important matters, and the people at the time derogatorily referred to Lu as \\"the chancellor who simply ate together\\" (‰º¥È£üÂÆ∞Áõ∏). Also that year, when there was a major locust infestation in central China, Yao advocated capturing and killing the locusts‚Äîa strategy that initially yielded no results, and Emperor Xuanzong considered abandoning it. Yao insisted on the strategy, and eventually this led to the improvement of the situation. Lu opined that killing many locusts may lead to disharmony in the spiritual world, but Yao stated that locusts were harming farmers and that he was willing to take any supernatural punishment for killing locusts. Later that year, when Emperor Xuanzong considered eliminating the posts of circuit-reviewing officials (ÊåâÂØü‰Ωø, Ancha Shi), Yao advocated keeping the posts, as he believed that it would be relatively easier to find people suitable to be these officials than to make sure that the prefectural prefects were all suitable officials without Ancha Shi reviewing their acts. In 716, another locust infestation occurred, and Yao again ordered the capture and killing of locusts. Ni Ruoshui (ÂÄ™Ëã•Ê∞¥), the prefect of Bian Prefecture (Ê±¥Â∑û, roughly modern Kaifeng, Henan), resisted the orders, claiming that Yao's strategy was carried out by the Han Zhao emperor Liu Chong and failed miserably, and that only if people in power enhanced their virtues could the locusts be eliminated; Ni went as far as refusing to have imperial censors enter Bian Prefecture to carry out the order. Yao wrote a formal order to Ni, stating: Ni thereafter did not dare to resist further. In winter 716, Lu died, and Yuan Qianyao became chancellor to serve alongside Yao. Around this time, Yao suffered a bout of malaria, and as he did not have a mansion in Chang'an, stayed at Wangji Temple (ÁΩîÊ•µÂØ∫). While Yao was ill, Emperor Xuanzong often sent eunuchs to look after Yao and had Yuan go to Wangji Temple to consult Yao. It was said that when Yuan made suggestions to Emperor Xuanzong that satisfied Emperor Xuanzong, Emperor Xuanzong would state, \\"This must be the will of Yao Chong,\\" and that whenever Yuan made suggestions that Emperor Xuanzong was dissatisfied about, Emperor Xuanzong would state, \\"Go consult with Yao Chong first.\\" Around the new year 717, at Yuan's suggestion, Yao was moved from Wangji Temple to the imperial diplomatic pavilion Sifang Pavilion (ÂõõÊñπÈ§®), where foreign diplomats would stay when they visited Chang'an, allowing Yao to be closer to the palace‚Äîa suggestion that Yao initially declined since he did not believe it appropriate for an ill person to stay there, but which he agreed to at Emperor Xuanzong's insistence. However, at that time, Yao's sons Yao Y√≠ (ÂßöÂΩû) and Yao Y√¨ (ÂßöÂºÇ) (note different characters and tones),It is unclear whether Yao Y√≠ and Yao Y√¨ were the sons who were said to have tried to improperly influence Wei Zhigu, as Yao Chong had six sons who were known to have been officials. See New Book of Tang, vol. 74, part 2. who were both deputy ministers at this time, often received gifts from others, something that the popular opinion at the time criticized them and Yao Chong for. Meanwhile, Yao Chong's associate Zhao Hui (Ë∂ôË™®) was found to have accepted bribes from foreigners, a crime punishable by death but which Yao tried to save him from death for, displeasing Emperor Xuanzong. At that time, Emperor Xuanzong was set to declare a pardon for the criminals of Chang'an, but Emperor Xuanzong modified his pardon to specifically exclude Zhao, ordering that Zhao be caned 100 times and then exiled to the Lingnan region. Yao, in fear, offered to resign and recommended Song to succeed him. Emperor Xuanzong thus removed Yao and Yuan from their chancellor posts‚Äîwith Yao receiving the honorific title Kaifu Yitong Sansi (ÈñãÂ∫úÂÑÄÂêå‰∏âÂè∏) but no other offices. Song and Su Ting became chancellors to succeed Yao and Yuan. In 717, after Yao made a comment that pleased Emperor Xuanzong, blaming the collapse of a hall of the imperial ancestral temple on the wood being too old rather than on divine displeasure, Yao became restored to Emperor Xuanzong's good graces and, while not made chancellor again, was allowed to meet Emperor Xuanzong once every five days. Yao died in 721. He wrote a will to his sons that disapproved the possibility of a Buddhist or Taoist funeral, stating:  Notes and references  ;Citations ;Sources * Old Book of Tang, vol. 96. * New Book of Tang, vol. 124. * Zizhi Tongjian, vols. 205, 206, 207, 208, 209, 210, 211, 212.

They are also known as litigation friends. When a relative who is next of kin acts as a next friend for a person, that person is sometimes instead described as the natural guardian of the person. A next friend has full power over the proceedings in the action as if he or she were an ordinary plaintiff, until a guardian or guardian ad litem is appointed in the case; but the next friend is entitled to present evidence only on the same basis as any other witness. Uses This disability often arises from minority, mental incapacity, or lack of access to counsel. Consequently, every application to the court on behalf of a minor, a mentally incapacitated person, or a person detained without access to an attorney, who does not have a legal guardian or someone authorized to act on his or her behalf with a power of attorney, must be made through a next friend (prochein ami, prochein amy, or proximus amicus). A minor frequently defends a suit not by a next friend but by a guardian ad litem, often appointed by the court with jurisdiction over the case or by a court with probate jurisdiction. Some jurisdictions, such as the English civil and family courts, have recognized the right of mature minors to instruct solicitors and apply to the court on their own behalf since the 1990s. Before the Married Women's Property Act 1882 in English Law and Irish Law (and similar acts during the same period in American law), it was usual for a married woman to sue by a next friend but that act, allowing a married woman to sue in all respects as a feme sole, has rendered a next friend unnecessary in the case of married women. Historically, in the case of a minor, the father was prima facie the proper person to act as next friend; in the father's absence, the testamentary guardian, if any, was next friend; but any person not under disability could act as next friend so long as he has no interest in the action adverse to that of the minor. A married woman could not historically act as next friend (feme covert) but this practice is no longer current, at least in the United States, where either or both of a minor's parents may act as next friend. (An exception is in divorce cases or other cases affecting child custody; in such cases courts often appoint a guardian or attorney (independent of the parents) to represent the child's interests, which may not be aligned with either parent's interests.) In the case of mental incapacity, a conservator, guardian, or committee represents the person in court, but if they have no such representative, or if the committee has some interest adverse to the claimant, they may sue by a next friend. One use of next friend status was in connection with many suits brought by detainees at Guantanamo Bay before the enactment of the Military Commissions Act of 2006. Another case arose following the Monkey selfie affair, when the animal rights organization People for Ethical Treatment of Animals sued photographer David Slater, asserting itself as the next friend of a Celebes crested macaque.

He is often identified with Cyrus, Patriarch of Alexandria, who administered Egypt on behalf of the Christian Byzantine Empire. However, this identification is challenged as being based on untenable assumptions. An alternative view identifies al-Muqawqis with the Sassanid governor of Egypt. He was a Greek man and was known as Kirolos, leader of the Copts. Account by Muslim historians Ibn Ishaq and other Muslim historians record that some time between February 628 and 632, Muhammad sent out letters to Arabian and non-Arabian leaders, including the Byzantine ruler, al-Muqawqis: Tabari states that the delegation was sent in Dhul-Hijja 6 A.H.

This is consistent with his assertion that Mariya bore Muhammad's son Ibrahim in late March or April 630,Bewley/Saad p. 149. so Mariya had arrived in Medina before July 629. Letter of invitation to Islam The letter that Muhammad sent to al-Muqawqis, through his emissary Hatib ibn Abi Balta'ah, and his reply are both available. The letter read:Translation of the letters and commentary Al-Muqawqis ordered that the letter should be placed in an ivory casket, to be kept safely in the government treasury, and he sent the following reply: The two maids mentioned are Maria al-Qibtiyya and her sister Sirin. Muhammad's letter to Muqawqis was eventually preserved in the Christian monastery of Akhmim in Egypt. There a recluse pasted it on his Bible. The letter was written on a parchment. From there a French orientalist obtained it and sold it to Sultan Abd√ºlmecid of Turkey, for a consideration of ¬£ 300. The Sultan had the letter fixed in a golden frame and had it preserved in the treasury of the royal palace, along with other sacred relics. Some Muslim scholars have affirmed that the letter was written by Abu Bakr. Contemporary analytical historiography doubts the precise content of the letter (together with the similar letters sent to several power figures of the ancient Near East). Authenticity of the preserved samples and of the elaborate accounts by the medieval Islamic historians regarding the events surrounding the letter has also been questioned by modern historians.O. G. Bolshakov. The History of The Khalifate (–ò—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—è –•–∞–ª–∏—Ñ–∞—Ç–∞) Dialog with Mughira ibn Shu'ba According to another account, Al-Muqawqis also had a dialogue with Mughira ibn Shu'ba, before Mughira became a Muslim. Mughira said: Explanation of the name The name al-Muqawqis is explained as an Arabization of the Greek word ŒúŒµŒ≥Œ±ŒªŒµŒπœåœÑŒ±œÑŒµ, meaning \\"His Majesty\\", a title that was used as an enthronement in the Byzantine empire and its patriarchs. The word was subsequently used by Arabian writers for some other Christian Patriarchs in Alexandria. It is not clear, however, whether the epithet applied to all vicegerents of Egypt, including the one during the brief period of the Persian empire, Sassanid rule, or later during the Greco-Roman rule to the Patriarchs. Since the Sassanid Empire extended all the way to the Caucasus, it is possible that the Sassanid governor of Egypt was called Pikaukasos, and later on Arabians used the same epithet for succeeding governors of Egypt. Identification Al-Muqawqis is often identified with Cyrus, Patriarch of Alexandria, who administered Egypt on behalf of the Byzantine Empire. This widely held view is challenged as being based on untenable assumptions. Considering the historical facts, the opponents of the identification, point out that: *Cyrus did not succeed to the See of Alexandria until 630 AD, after Heraclius had recaptured Egypt. After the Persian invasion, \\"The Coptic patriarch Andronicus remained in the country, experiencing and witnessing suffering as a result of the occupation (Evetts, 1904, p. 486 ll. 8-11). His successor in 626, Benjamin I, remained in office well beyond the end of the occupation; during his time the Sassanians moderated their policy to a certain extent.\\"EGYPT iv. Relations in the Sasanian period Adherents to this criticism state that al-Muqawqis was not a Patriarch but the Persian governor during the last days of the Persian occupation of Egypt. There must have been an abundance of Alexandrine women left after the massacre. \\"Severus b. al-Moqaffa...also reported that in Alexandria every man between the ages of eighteen and fifty years had been brutally massacred (Evetts, 1904, pp. 485 l. 10-486 l. 3).\\" So from among the captive women, it seems that the Muqawqis took two Coptic sisters and sent them to Muhammad as gifts, realizing that the Byzantines were gaining ground and would soon re-take Alexandria. One possible reason that the Sasanian governor was kind towards Muhammad is that it is alleged that Christian Arabs assisted in Persian victory over the Byzantines, and al-Muqawqis simply wanted to reward Muhammad whom he saw as one of the Arab kings. \\"According to a Nestorian Syriac chronicle attributed to Elias, bishop of Merv (?), Alexandria was taken by treachery. The traitor was a Christian Arab who came from the Sassanian-controlled northeastern coast of Arabia.\\" References Category:7th-century Islam Category:Muslim conquest of Egypt Category:7th- century Egyptian people Category:Egyptian people of Greek descent ","title":"Al-Muqawqis"},{"id":"2443547","text":"The GBU-57A/B Massive Ordnance Penetrator (MOP) is a precision-guided, \\"bunker buster\\" bomb used by the United States Air Force.B-2/Massive Ordnance Penetrator (MOP) GBU-57A/B.

The Massive Ordnance Penetrator (MOP) is a weapon system designed to accomplish a difficult, complicated mission of reaching and destroying an adversary's weapons of mass destruction located in well-protected facilities. Development In 2002, Northrop Grumman and Lockheed Martin were working on the development of a earth-penetrating weapon, said to be known as \\"Big BLU\\". But funding and technical difficulties resulted in the development work being abandoned. Following the 2003 invasion of Iraq, analysis of sites that had been attacked with bunker buster bombs revealed poor penetration and inadequate levels of destruction. This renewed interest in the development of a larger bunker buster, and the MOP project was initiated by the Defense Threat Reduction Agency to fulfill a long-standing Air Force requirement. The U.S. Air Force has not officially communicated a specific military requirement for an ultra-large bomb, but it does have a concept for a collection of massively sized penetrator and blast weapons: the so-called \\"Big BLU\\" collection, which includes the MOAB (Massive Ordnance Air Blast) bomb.

He was said to be the first official during Emperor Xuanzong's reign who became powerful on account of his ability to increase government revenue.  Background  Yuwen Rong's family was from the Tang Dynasty capital Chang'an, and traced its ancestry to Yuwen Yidougui, the last chief of the Xianbei tribe Yuwen, which was destroyed by the Former Yan ruler Murong Huang.New Book of Tang, vol. 71. His great-grandfather Yuwen Bi (ÂÆáÊñáÂºº) was a major general for Tang's predecessor Sui Dynasty, and Yuwen Rong's grandfather Yuwen Jie served as a chancellor during the reign of Emperor Gaozong of Tang. Yuwen Rong's father Yuwen Jiao (ÂÆáÊñáÂ∂†) served as a prefectural secretary general.  During Emperor Xuanzong's reign  Early in the Kaiyuan era (713-741) of Emperor Xuanzong, Yuwen Rong served as the treasurer for Fuping County (ÂØåÂπ≥, in modern Weinan, Shaanxi), which was then part of Jingzhao Municipality (i.e., the municipality encompassing Chang'an), and was said to be capable in that capacity. While the officials Yuan Qianyao and Meng Wen (Â≠üÊ∫´) successively served as the mayors of Jingzhao, both of them respected his abilities. He later served as Jiancha Yushi (Áõ£ÂØüÂæ°Âè≤), an imperial censor. At that time, there were many people who tried to evade labor conscription and taxes by avoiding being enrolled on census rolls, or fraudulently claiming exemptions, causing a drain on the imperial treasury. In 721, Yuwen requested that he be specially commissioned to go after census evaders and fraudulent exemption claimers, and, with support from Yuan, who was then a chancellor, Emperor Xuanzong agreed. Yuwen was able to locate some 800,000 alleged census evaders‚Äîalthough traditional historians believed that this figure was inflated‚Äîadding much to the imperial treasury. When the county magistrate Huangfu Jing (ÁöáÁî´ÊÜ¨) submitted a petition arguing that this was causing a panic among the people, Emperor Xuanzong moved Huangfu to a more distant county as punishment. When the deputy minister of census Yang Yang (Ê•äÊöò) also pointed this out, Yang was sent out of the capital. Subsequently, apparently at Yuwen's urging, Emperor Xuanzong issued an amnesty period for the census evaders to report themselves and allowed them to be exempted from retroactive taxation. When Yuwen toured the realm to announce this, the census evaders, not realizing his earlier role in investigations into them, were exceedingly thankful to him. For his role in the project, Yuwen was promoted to be the deputy imperial censor (Âæ°Âè≤‰∏≠‰∏û, Yushi Zhongcheng). In 725, Emperor Xuanzong gave Yuwen the additional office as deputy minister of census (Êà∂ÈÉ®‰æçÈÉé, Hubu Shilang). He also decreed that the grains submitted as taxes by the census evaders were to be put aside in storage in case of famine, and also established agriculture promotion offices in the prefectures and counties to try to enhance agriculture. Later that year, when Emperor Xuanzong suspected the ministry of civil service affairs to be unfair in its selection of officials, Yuwen suggested that he appoint 10 officials to review the selections, and then further review the 10 examiners' decisions. Emperor Xuanzong agreed and carried out the plan, despite objections submitted by the official Wu Jing (Âê≥ÂÖ¢), although in 726 he stopped the scheme. Meanwhile, it was said that the senior chancellor Zhang Yue despised Yuwen, but also did not view him as a threat, despite warnings from his subordinate Zhang Jiuling. In 726, Yuwen, along with Li Linfu and another official who resented Zhang Yue, Cui Yinfu (Â¥îÈö±Áî´), submitted accusations of corruption against Zhang Yue. Subsequently, Zhang was removed from his chancellor position, but at the intercession of the powerful eunuch Gao Lishi, avoided further punishment. Fearing that Zhang Yue would eventually return to the chancellor position, Yuwen and Cui formed a faction with other officials, against Zhang Yue and his faction. In 727, Emperor Xuanzong, tired of that situation, ordered Zhang Yue to retire, Cui to return home to serve his mother, and demoted Yuwen to be the prefect of Wei Prefecture (È≠èÂ∑û, in modern Handan, Hebei). In 728, Emperor Xuanzong gave Yuwen the additional posts as the examiner of Hebei Circuit (Ê≤≥ÂåóÈÅì, roughly modern Hebei, Beijing, and Tianjin) as well as deputy minister of census. Later that year, he made Yuwen the prefect of Bian Prefecture (Ê±¥Â∑û, roughly modern Kaifeng, Henan), and gave Yuwen the additional responsibility of managing the Yellow River levees. Yuwen proposed that the ancient routes of the Yellow River‚Äîwhen the lower Yellow River divided into nine river routes‚Äîbe located, and that the routes be used for irrigation of rice fields; further, he also proposed that the routes could then be used for transportation. Emperor Xuanzong approved of the plan, which however did not have much progress despite expenses. In 729, tired of the constant arguments between the chancellors Li Yuanhong and Du Xian, and Yuan's inabilities to moderate them, Emperor Xuanzong removed all three from chancellor positions, replacing them with Yuwen and Pei Guangting‚Äîwith Yuwen given the position of Huangmen Shilang (ÈªÉÈñÄ‰æçÈÉé), the deputy head of the examination bureau of government (ÈñÄ‰∏ãÁúÅ, Menxia Sheng), and given the de facto chancellor designation of Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi (Âêå‰∏≠Êõ∏ÈñÄ‰∏ãÂπ≥Á´†‰∫ã). It was said that Yuwen tried to further increase revenues by establish special offices, which caused the previously commissioned officials to have much less responsibilities. It was further said that Yuwen was intelligent and capable in increasing revenues, drawing Emperor Xuanzong's favor, but was frivolous, talkative, and nepotistic, once commenting, \\"Let me sit on this seat for a few months, and the realm will have no troubles.\\" However, it was also said that he was praised for recommending the well-respected officials Song Jing, Pei Yaoqing, and Xu Jingxian (Ë®±ÊôØÂÖà). He soon became jealous of another favorite of Emperor Xuanzong's -- Emperor Xuanzong's second cousin Li Hui (ÊùéË§ò) the Prince of Xin'an, who had drawn Emperor Xuanzong's favor for his contributions as a general and was then the military governor (jiedushi) of Shuofang Circuit (ÊúîÊñπ, headquartered in modern Yinchuan, Ningxia). Yuwen persuaded the imperial censor Li Zhou (ÊùéÂÆô)According to Yuwen's biographies in the Old Book of Tang and the New Book of Tang, the censor's name was Li Zhou, but according to the Zizhi Tongjian, the censor's name was Li Yin (ÊùéÂØÖ). Compare Old Book of Tang, vol. 105 and New Book of Tang, vol. 134 with Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 213. to submit an indictment against Li Hui, but the news was leaked to Li Hui. Li Hui, finding out he was to be indicted, reported this to Emperor Xuanzong through Emperor Xuanzong's sister Li Chiying (ÊùéÊåÅÁõà) the Princess Yuzhen and Gao, defending himself. When Li Zhou, as Li Hui had predicted, submitted the indictment, Emperor Xuanzong knew that it was at Yuwen's urging and became angry at them. He demoted Yuwen to be the prefect of Ru Prefecture (Ê±ùÂ∑û, roughly modern Zhumadian, Henan) -- after serving 100 days as chancellor.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 213.Yuwen's term of service was from July 15 to October 21., which should be 99 days, but the traditional historians called his term 100 days. However, after Yuwen's removal, it was said that revenues decreased sharply, and Emperor Xuanzong questioned Pei Guangting and other officials who had criticized Yuwen, \\"You all claim that Yuwen Rong is evil, and I have removed him. Now, what should we do if there is not enough money in the treasury? What are you here for?\\" Pei and the other officials were fearful and unable to answer, but Emperor Xuanzong did not punish them. Meanwhile, as Pei was also serving as chief imperial censor by this point, he submitted an indictment against Yuwen for corruption and improper association with others, and he was demoted to be the sheriff of Pingle County (Âπ≥Ê®Ç, in modern Guilin, Guangxi). After he had spent more than a year at Pingle, the deputy minister Jiang Cen (Ëî£Â≤ë) further accused Yuwen of corruption while serving as prefect of Bian Prefecture. Yuwen was thus further removed as sheriff and exiled to Yan Prefecture (Â∑ñÂ∑û, roughly modern Laibin, Guangxi). It was said that the environment of Yan Prefecture was humid and unhealthy, causing Yuwen to be ill. He thus went on sick leave in Guang Prefecture (Âª£Â∑û, roughly modern Guangzhou, Guangdong). After his leave was to be over, however, he remained in Guang Prefecture, causing the commandant of Guang Prefecture, Geng Renzhong (ËÄø‰ªÅÂø†) to force him to leave. He died on the way back to Yan Prefecture. When Emperor Xuanzong heard this, he remembered Yuwen's contributions and posthumously made him a prefectural prefect.

Harae is one of four essential elements involved in a Shinto ceremony.(Ben Yari, 1991) The purpose is the purification of pollution or sins (tsumi) and uncleanness (kegare).(Norbeck, 1952) These concepts include bad luck and disease as well as guilt in the English sense. Harae is often described as purification, but it is also known as an exorcism to be done before worship. Harae often involves symbolic washing with water, or having a Shinto priest shake a large paper shaker called ≈çnusa or haraegushi over the object of purification. People, places, and objects can all be the object of harae. History  An ≈çnusa, which is used in certain types of harae. Harae stems from the myth of Susano-o, the brother of the Sun goddess Amaterasu. According to the myth, while Amaterasu was supervising the weaving of the garments of the gods in the pure weaving hall, Susano-o broke through the roof and let fall a heavenly horse which had been flayed. This startled one of her attendants who, in her agitation, accidentally killed herself with the loom's shuttle. Amaterasu fled to the heavenly cave Amano-Iwato. Susano-o was subsequently expelled from heaven and Amaterasu's sovereignty resumed. The traditional Shinto purification ritual harae is represented when Susano-o is removed from heaven.(Miller, 1984)  Practice  There are various ways in which harae is practiced. In Ise Grand Shrine, \\"the holiest of all Shinto shrines\\",(Chamberlain, 1893) wooden charms named ≈ç-harai, another name for harae or harai, are hung all over the shrine.(Chamberlain) In all Shinto religious ceremonies, harae is performed in the beginning of the ritual to cleanse any evil, pollution or sins away before anyone gives offerings to the kami. Often, water and salt are used for the ceremonies to rinse hands and the face, as well as the shrine before it is prepared with offerings of goods and food.Boyd & Williams, 2005. Then the priest, along with the rest of the participants of the ritual chant a solemn liturgy before the assistant priest purifies the offerings using a wand called haraigushi.(Boyd & Williams, 2005) Another method used to perform harae is misogi, in which a participant stands under a cold waterfall while chanting a liturgy. Misogi (Á¶ä) is said to be done on the 11th day of the month, including the winter months at the Tsubaki Grand Shrine. As both are related they are collectively referred to as . ≈åharae is another method performed as a cleansing ritual to cleanse a large group of people. This ritual is practiced mostly in June and December to purify the nation, as well as after a disaster occurs. The practice is also performed at the year-end festival and also before major national festivals.(‚ÄúBasic Terms of Shinto‚Äù, 1997) Shubatsu (‰øÆÁ•ì), a cleansing ritual performed by sprinkling salt, is another practice of the Shinto religion. Salt is used as a purifier by placing small piles in front of restaurants, known as or , for the two-fold purposes of warding off evil and attracting patrons.Can you pass the salt, please?, Robert Camara, March 30, 2009 In addition, sprinkling salt over a person after attending a funeral is also practiced commonly in the Shinto religion. Another example of this cleansing ritual is to sprinkle water at the gate of one's home, both in the morning and evening. A significant and visible form of this ritual is when sumo wrestlers sprinkle salt around the fighting ring before a match, to purify the area.(‚ÄúHarae‚Äîpurification rites‚Äù, 2009)  See also  * Consecration * Misogi * The Glossary of Shinto for an explanation of terms concerning Japanese Shinto, Shinto art, and Shinto shrine architecture.

It was the first French car to sell over a million units, and was superseded by the Dauphine. The 4CV was of monocoque construction, in length with front suicide doors. CV is the abbreviation of cheveaux-vapeur, the French equivalent to \\"horsepower\\" as a unit of power. The name 4CV thus refers to the car's tax horsepower. Conception and development The 4CV was originally conceived and designed covertly by Renault engineers during the World War II German occupation of France, when the manufacturer was under strict orders to design and produce only commercial and military vehicles. Between 1941 and 1944 Renault was placed under the technical directorship of a francophile engineer, Wilhelm von Urach (between 1927 and 1940 employed by Daimler Benz) who failed to notice the small car project emerging on his watch. A design team led by the company's technical director, Fernand Picard, recently returned from Renault's aero-engine division to the auto business and Charles-Edmond Serre, who had been with Renault for longer than virtually anyone else, envisioned a small, economical car suitable for the period of austerity expected after the war. This was in contrast to Louis Renault himself who, in 1940, believed that after the war Renault would need to concentrate on its traditional mid-range cars.In Autumn 1940, a few months after the German invasion, Renault expressed himself to Serre, \\"Apr√®s la fin de cette maudite guerre, nous ferons des Juvaquatre et Primaquatre modernis√©es, rien d'autre\\" (After the end of this damned war we will make modernised Juvaquatres and Primaquatres: nothing else). Picard and Serre persisted nevertheless. Jean-Auguste Riolfo, head of the test department, was made aware of the project from an early stage as were several other heads of department. In May 1941 Louis Renault himself burst into an office to find Serre and Picard studying a mock-up for the car's engine. By the end of an ad hoc meeting, Renault's approval for the project, now accorded the code \\"106E\\", was provided. However, because the Germans had forbidden work on any new passenger car models, the 4CV development was defined as a low priority spin-off from a project to develop a new engine for a post-war return of the company's 1930s small car, the Juvaquatre: departmental bosses installed by the Germans were definitely not to be trusted in respect of \\"Project 106E\\", while von Urach, their overlord, always managed to turn a blind eye to the whole business. Volkswagen influence In November 1945 the government invited Ferdinand Porsche to France to explore the possibility of relocating the Volkswagen project to France as part of the reparations package then under discussion. On 15 December 1945, Porsche found himself invited to provide Renault with advice concerning their forthcoming Renault 4CV. Earlier that year, newly nationalised Renault had officially acquired a new boss, (after the death in suspicious circumstances of Louis Renault), the former resistance hero Pierre Lefaucheux, (he had been acting administrator since September 1944). He had been arrested by the Gestapo in June 1944, and deported to Buchenwald concentration camp. The Gestapo transferred him to Metz for interrogation, but the city was deserted because of the advancing allied front, the Germans abandoned their prisoner. Lefaucheux was enraged that anyone should think the by now almost production-ready Renault 4CV was in any way inspired by the Volkswagen, and even more enraged that the politicians should presume to send Porsche to provide advice on it. The government insisted on nine meetings involving Porsche which took place in rapid succession. Lefaucheux insisted that the meetings would have absolutely no influence on the design of the Renault 4CV, and Porsche cautiously went on record with the view that the car would be ready for large scale production in a year. Lefaucheux was a man with contacts. As soon as the 4CV project meetings mandated by the politicians had taken place, Porsche was arrested in connection with war crimes allegations involving the use of forced labour including French in the Volkswagen plant in Germany. Porsche was accompanied on his visit to the Renault plant by his son Ferry, and the two were offered release in return for a substantial cash payment. Porsche was able to provide only half of the amount demanded, with the result that Ferry Porsche was sent back to Germany, while Ferdinand Porsche, despite never facing any sort of trial, spent the next twenty months in a Dijon jail. The first prototype had only two doors and was completed in 1942, and two more prototypes were produced in the following three years. Later Pierre Lefaucheux, appointed to the top job at Renault early in 1945, tested the 4CV prototype at Louis Renault's Herqueville estate. Ready for release In 1940, Louis Renault had, according to one source, directed his engineering team to \\"make him a car like the Germans'.\\" Until the arrangement was simplified in 1945, the 4CV featured a 'dummy' grille comprising six thin horizontal chrome strips, intended to distract attention from the similarity of the car's overall architecture to that of the German Volkswagen, while recalling the modern designs of the fashionable front-engined passenger cars produced in Detroit during the earlier 1940s. An important part of the 4CV's success was due to the new methodologies used in its manufacture, pioneered by Pierre B√©zier. B√©zier had begun his 42-year tenure at Renault as a tool setter, moving up to tool designer and then becoming head of the tool design office. As director of production engineering in 1949, he designed the transfer lines (or transfer machines) producing most of the mechanical parts for the 4CV. The transfer machines were high-performance work tools designed to machine engine blocks. While imprisoned during World War II, B√©zier developed and improved on the automatic machine principle, introduced before the war by General Motors (GM). The new transfer station with multiple workstations and electromagnetic heads (antecedents to robots), enabled different operations on a single part to be consecutively performed by transferring the part from one station to another. Launch and market reception Rear view, with cooling louvres over the engine The longitudinally-mounted rear engine (1960 750 cc) The 4CV was ultimately presented to the public and media at the 1946 Paris Motor Show and went on sale a year later. Volume production was said to have commenced at the company's Billancourt plant a few weeks before the Paris Motor Show of October 1947, although the cars were in very short supply for the next year or so. Renault's advertising highlighted the hundreds of machine-tools installed and processes adopted for the assembly of the first high volume car to be produced since the war, boasting that the little car was now no longer a prototype but a reality.\\"La Premiere des nouvelles voitures fran√ßaises construite en grande s√©rie depuis la guerre....La 4 CV n'est plus un prototype mais une r√©alit√©\\" On the 4CV's launch, it was nicknamed \\"La motte de beurre\\" (the lump of butter); this was due to the combination of its shape and the fact that early deliveries all used surplus paint from the German Army vehicles of Rommel's Afrika Korps, which were a sand-yellow color. Later it was known affectionately as the \\"quatre pattes\\", \\"four paws\\". The 4CV was initially powered by a 760 cc rear-mounted four-cylinder engine coupled to a three-speed manual transmission.Renault 4CV at www.motorcase.com Retrieved on 16 September 2010 In 1950, the 760 cc unit was replaced by a 747 cc version of the \\"Billancourt\\" engine producing . Despite an initial period of uncertainty and poor sales due to the ravaged state of the French economy, the 4CV had sold 37,000 units by mid-1949 and was the most popular car in France. Across the Rhine 1,760 4CVs were sold in West Germany in 1950, accounting for 23% of that country's imported cars, and ranking second only to the Fiat 500 on the list. The car remained in production for more than another decade. Claimed power output increased subsequently to as increased fuel octanes allowed for higher compression ratios, which along with the relatively low weight of the car () enabled the manufacturers to report a time of 38 seconds and a top speed barely under . The engine was notable also for its flexibility, the second and top gear both being usable for speeds between ; the absence of synchromesh on first gear would presumably have discouraged use of the bottom gear except when starting from rest. Handling The rear mounting of the engine meant that the steering could be highly geared while remaining relatively light; in the early cars, only 2¬º turns were needed from lock to lock. The unusually direct steering no doubt delighted some keen drivers, but road tests of the time nonetheless included warnings to take great care with the car's handling on wet roads. In due course, the manufacturer switched from one extreme to the other, and on later cars 4¬Ω turns were needed to turn the steering wheel from lock to lock. Broadening the range downmarket Early in 1953 the manufacturer launched a stripped-down version of the 4CV bereft of anything which might be considered a luxury. Tyre width was reduced, and the dummy grille was removed from the front of the car along with the chrome headlamp surrounds. The seats were simplified and the number of bars incorporated in the steering wheel reduced from three to two. The only colour offered was grey. The car achieved its objective of retailing for less than 400,000 Francs. With the Dauphine already at an advanced stage of developmentTwo night time \\"scoop\\" photographs of a prototype under test that appeared in L'Auto- Journal in October 1952 demonstrate that the body design of the Renault Dauphine had already been virtually finalised in 1952 even though the car would not be launched in the market for another four years it may have made sense to try and expand the 4CV's own market coverage downwards in order to open up a clearer gap between the two models which would be produced in parallel for several years, but reaction to the down-market 4 CV, branded as the \\"Renault 4CV Service\\", must have disappointed Renault as this version of the car disappeared from the Renault showrooms after less than a year. The poor sales performance of the stripped-down \\"4CV Service\\" may have been linked to the growing popularity of the Citro√´n 2CV: although at this stage powered by an engine of just 375 cc and offering sclerotic performance, the 2CV was bigger than the Renault and in 1952 came with a starting price of just 341,870 francs. Replacement The 4CV's direct replacement was the Dauphine, launched in 1956, but the 4CV remained in production until 1961. The 4CV was replaced by the Renault 4 which used the same engine as the 4CV and sold for a similar price. Around the world The first car of the Renault 4CV manufactured by FASA-Renault at the factory of Valladolid. The factory was opened in 1951. This copy is located in the Valladolid Science Museum. Although most of the cars were assembled at Renault's √éle Seguin plant located on an island in the river opposite Billancourt, the 4CV was also assembled in seven other countries. In December 1949 it was announced that the car had replaced the company's Juvaquatre at the company's factory in Acton, West London, where right hand drive 4 CVs were assembled using, for the most part, components imported from France. Other countries where 4 CVs were assembled included Australia, Belgium, England, Ireland, Japan (where the Hino-assembled cars gained a reputation for superior quality), Spain and South Africa. Across the world 1,105,543 cars were produced; the 4CV became the first French car to sell over a million units.1962 Hino PA62 *In Spain, the 4CV was produced by FASA's Valladolid factory from 1951-1961. *The 4CV was also manufactured in Japan under licence by Hino Motors, Ltd. from 1953-1961, rebadged as the Hino Renault 4CV, then later replaced by the Hino Contessa while still using the Renault powertrain. *The 4CV was marketed in Australia from 1949-1961, initially as the Renault 760 and later as the Renault 750. It was imported in both fully assembled and CKD form, with assembly of the latter undertaken in Sydney. The 4CV was easily modified, and was used extensively as a racing car. The first collaboration between the Alpine company and Renault was the Alpine A106 which was based on the 4CV. The partnership would go on to win the 1973 World Rally Championship with the Alpine A110.

A satellite image of the Gulf of C√°diz. Map showing the Gulf of C√°diz and surrounding area. The Gulf of Cadiz (, ) is the arm of the Atlantic Ocean between Cabo de Santa Maria, the southernmost point of Mainland Portugal and Cape Trafalgar at the western end of the Strait of Gibraltar. Two major rivers, the Guadalquivir and the Guadiana, as well as smaller rivers, like the Odiel, the Tinto, and the Guadalete, reach the ocean here. The Gulf of Cadiz is located in the north-eastern Atlantic Ocean between 34¬∞N and 37¬∞15‚Ä≤N and 6¬∞W to 9¬∞45‚Ä≤W. It is enclosed by the southern Iberian and northern Moroccan margins, west of Strait of Gibraltar.  Geology  The geological history of the Gulf of Cadiz is intimately related to plate tectonic interaction between Southern Eurasia and North Africa and is driven by two major mechanisms: * subduction associated with the westward emplacement of the Gibraltar Arc and formation of the Gulf of Cadiz accretionary wedge. The current activity of the subduction is unclear, with some advocating ongoing active subduction. Others suggest that subduction is inactive and that a new plate boundary has recently formed along a series of prominent WNW‚ÄìESE trending lineaments acting as a dextral strike-slip (transform) plate boundary. * oblique lithosphere collision between Iberia and Nubia. Oblique convergence between Africa (Nubia) and Iberia (Eurasia) occurs here at about per year in a NW‚ÄìSE direction. Some have suggested this may also be causing active thrusting in the Gulf of C√°diz. Tectonic map of the Gulf of C√°diz region It is now well established that the whole area is under compressive deformation and that mud volcanism and processes associated with the escape of hydrocarbon-rich fluids sustain a broad diversity of chemosynthetic assemblages. The accretionary wedge formed by subduction represents an extensive area which encompasses over forty mud volcanoes (a type of cold seep), at depths ranging from (confirmed by coring), and active methane seepage has been documented on several locations.  Biota  The occurrence of chemosymbiotic biota in the extensive mud volcano fields of the Gulf of Cadiz was first reported in 2003. There were found mainly pogonophoran worms, but also gastropods and bivalves, polychaetes, crustaceans and echinoderms. There were also recorded dead corals of genera Madrepora and Lophelia. The chemosymbiotic bivalves collected from the mud volcanoes of the Gulf of C√°diz were reviewed in 2011. There were reported the following species of chemosymbiotic bivalves of Solemyidae: Acharax gadirae, Solemya elarraichensis; Mytilidae: Bathymodiolus mauritanicus, Idas sp.; Lucinidae: Lucinoma asapheus; Thyasiridae: Thyasira vulcolutre, Spinaxinus sentosus; Vesicomyidae: Isorropodon perplexum, Isorropodon megadesmus, Callogonia cyrili, Christineconcha regab, Laubiericoncha chuni and Pliocardia sp. There is high degree of endemism within chemosymbiotic bivalve assemblages.

It was the first Metro edition published in North America and the ninth edition since the first in Stockholm in 1995. Overview Lawyers representing the publishers of the Philadelphia Inquirer, Philadelphia Daily News, U.S.A. Today and The New York Times filed an action in Federal Court three days before Metro's first publication to block local transit authority SEPTA from giving what they considered to be a competitive advantage to Metro.Philadelphia.about.com The front page of the first Philadelphia edition of Metro. SEPTA signed a five- year contract with TPI Metro. Part of the contract allows SEPTA to produce one page in each edition; however, aside from that page SEPTA has no control over any other aspect of the paper. The contract calls for Metro to pay $45,000 a month to SEPTA, which they stopped paying in March, 2003, claiming SEPTA failed to live up to the terms of the contract. Despite lawsuits and counter- suits, in 2004 TPI Metro PA and SEPTA signed a three-year contract which increased payments to $65,000 a month. The daily is primarily distributed by old-time newspaper hawkers paid to station themselves in areas with high pedestrian traffic, who offer the free paper to anyone who passes by. In addition, Metro can be found in distinctive green boxes on corners and in train and subway stations, echoing the colorful green and orange template used in all editions. There are also Metro editions in two other American cities, Metro New York and Boston which are run by the same publishing company. In 2009, Metro International sold its US papers to a former executive. In March 2019, the paper eliminated three of its four general news staffers.

The Government presents it on the first day of February so that it could be materialised before the beginning of new financial year in April. Until 2016 it was presented on the last working day of February by the Finance Minister in Parliament. The budget, which is presented by means of the Finance bill and the Appropriation bill has to be passed by Lok Sabha before it can come into effect on 1 April, the start of India's financial year. An interim budget is not the same as a 'Vote on Account'. While a 'Vote on Account' deals only with the expenditure side of the government's budget. An interim budget is a complete set of accounts, including both expenditure and receipts. An interim budget gives the complete financial statement, very similar to a full budget. While the law does not disqualify the Union government from introducing tax changes, normally during an election year, successive governments have avoided making any major changes in income tax laws during an interim budget. , Morarji Desai has presented 10 budgets which is the highest count followed by P Chidambaram's 9 and Pranab Mukherjee's 8. Yashwant Sinha, Yashwantrao Chavan and C.D. Deshmukh have presented 7 budgets each while Manmohan Singh and T.T. Krishnamachari have presented 6 budgets. Chronology =Pre-liberalisation= The first Union budget of independent India was presented by R. K. Shanmukham Chetty on 26 November 1947.with the total revenues was mere Rs.171.15 crore,A fiscal deficit was a paltry Rs.24.59 crore. total expenditure estimated at Rs.197.29 crore,Defense expenditure at Rs.92.74 crore. The Union budgets for the fiscal years 1959-61 to 1963-64, inclusive of the interim budget for 1962-63, were presented by Morarji Desai. On 29 February in 1964 and 1968, he became the only finance minister to present the Union budget on his birthday. Desai presented budgets that included five annual budgets and an interim budget during his first term and three final budgets and one interim budget in his second tenure when he was both the Finance Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister of India. After Desai's resignation, Indira Gandhi, the then Prime Minister of India, took over the Ministry of Finance to become the first woman to hold the post of the Finance Minister. Pranab Mukherjee, the first Rajya Sabha member to hold the Finance portfolio, presented the annual budgets for the financial years 1982-83, 1983‚Äì84 and 1984-85. Rajiv Gandhi presented the budget for 1987-89, after V. P. Singh quit his government, and in the process became the third Prime Minister to present a budget after his mother and grandfather. N. D. Tiwari presented the budget for 1988-89, S. B. Chavan for 1989-90, while Madhu Dandawate presented the Union budget for 1990-91. Dr. Manmohan Singh became the Finance Minister and presented the interim budget for 1991-92 as elections were forced. Due to political developments, early elections were held in May 1991 following which the Indian National Congress returned to political power and Manmohan Singh, the Finance Minister, presented the budget for 1991-92. =Post-liberalisation= Manmohan Singh under P. V. Narasimha Rao, in his next annual budgets from 1992‚Äì93, opened the economy, encouraged foreign investments and reduced peak import duty from 300 plus percent to 50 percent. After elections in 1996, a non-Congress ministry assumed office. Hence the financial budget for 1996-97 was presented by P. Chidambaram, who then belonged to Tamil Maanila Congress. Following a constitutional crisis when the I. K. Gujral Ministry was on its way out, a special session of Parliament was convened just to pass Chidambaram's 1997-98 budget. This budget was passed without a debate. After the general elections in March 1998 that led to the Bharatiya Janata Party forming the Central Government, Yashwant Sinha, the then Finance Minister in this government, presented the interim and final budgets for 1998-99. After general elections in 1999, Sinha again became the Finance Minister and presented four annual budgets from 1999-2000 to 2002-2003. Due to elections in May 2004, an interim budget was presented by Jaswant Singh. Former Finance Minister Morarji Desai presented the budget ten times, the most by any. The Union Budget of India for 2012-2013 was presented by Pranab Mukherjee, on 16 March 2012, which was the 7th budget of his career. These budgetary proposals would be applicable for financial year 1 April 2012 to 31 March 2013. The Union Budget of India for 2013-2014 was presented by P. Chidambaram on 28 February 2013. The Interim Union Budget for 2014-2015 was presented on 17 February 2014. The Union Budget of India for 2014-2015 was presented by Arun Jaitley on 10 July 2014. The Union Budget of India for 2015-2016 was presented by Arun Jaitley on 28 February 2015. The Union Budget of India for 2016-2017 was presented by Arun Jaitley on 29 February 2016. The Union Budget of India for 2017-2018 was presented by Arun Jaitley on 1 February 2017. The Union Budget of India for 2018-2019 was presented by Arun Jaitley on 1 February 2018. The Interim Union Budget for 2019-2020 was presented by Piyush Goyal on 1 February 2019. The Union Budget for 2019-2020 was presented by Nirmala Sitharaman on 5 July 2019. The Union Budget for 2020-2021 was presented by Nirmala Sitharaman on 1 February 2020. Traditions =Time of Budget announcement= Until the year 1999, the Union Budget was announced at 5:00 pm on the last working day of the month of February. This practice was inherited from the Colonial Era. Another reason was that until the 1990s, all that budgets seem to do was to raise taxes, a presentation in the evening gave producers and the tax collecting agencies the night to work out the change in prices. It was Mr.Yashwant Sinha, the then Finance Minister of India in the NDA government (led by Bharatiya Janata Party) of Atal Bihari Vajpayee, who changed the ritual by announcing the 1999 Union Budget at 11 am.the tradition started from 2001. =Date of Budget announcement= Also again in 2016, departing from the colonial-era tradition of presenting the Union Budget on the last working day of February, Minister of Finance (India) Arun Jaitley, in the NDA government (led by Bharatiya Janata Party) of Narendra Modi announced that it will now be presented on 1 February. Additionally Rail Budget, presented separately for 92 Years, merged with union budget. =Halwa Ceremony and Budget briefcase= The printing of budget documents starts roughly one week ahead of presenting in the Parliament with a customary 'Halwa ceremony' in which halwa (a sweet dish) is prepared in large quantities and served to the officers and support staff involved. They remain isolated and stay in the North Block office until the Budget is presented. The Halwa is served by the Finance Minister. This ceremony is performed as a part of the Indian tradition of having something sweet before starting an important work. Until 2018, as a part of tradition, Finance ministers carried the budget in a leather briefcase. The tradition was established by the first Finance minister of India, Mr. RK Shanmukham Chetty. On 5 July 2019, Nirmala Sitharaman, broke this tradition by carrying the budget in a Bahi-Khata.

It is less than one kilometre to the south of Lake Avernus and is separated from the Gulf of Pozzuoli by a narrow strip of land. Also known as the maricello (\\"little sea\\"), the size of present-day Lago Lucrino was significantly reduced by the rise of the volcanic cone of Monte Nuovo in 1538.Antonio Parascandola. \\"Il Monte Nuovo ed il Lago Lucrino\\", in: Bollettino della Societ√† dei Naturalisti in Napoli, vol. LV, 1944-1946. The lake's modern dimensions are long and about deep. Mario Sirpettino \\"At the bottom of the sea: the remains of Portus Julius\\" The recorded history of Lucrinus Lacus dates back to Sergius Orata, who is credited with creating the first oyster beds there. The lake was also a resort destination for residents of Baiae (cf. Martial i. 62). Its banks were covered with villas, of which the best known was Cicero's villa Cumanum on the east bank, which was the seat of his Academia. The remnants of this villa, and the nearby village of Tripergole, disappeared beneath ejecta from the eruption of Monte Nuovo in 1538. According to a history by Tacitus, Agrippina the Younger was murdered by the emperor Nero's assassins in her villa on the shores of Lucrinus Lacus in AD 59 after escaping a unsuccessful murder attempt while sailing on another craft nearby https://www.jstor.org/stable/4435315?seq=1 . The Via Herculanea and a railway traverse the strip of land between the lake and the Gulf of Pozzuoli. The road runs on an embankment, which Strabo credited to Heracles with constructing. This strip was reinforced with a sea wall and then opened by Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa to make a harbour of Lucrinus Lacus. He then joined Lucrinis Lacus to Lago d'Averno by a canal, as recorded in Virgil's Georgics.Virgil, Georgics ii.161-64. Today Lucrino is a frazione of the comune of Pozzuoli.

Edigu's Golden Horde. Edigu (or Edigey) (also ƒ∞deg√§y or Edege Mangit) (1352‚Äì1419) was a Turkic Muslim Emir of the White Horde who founded a new political entity, which came to be known as the Nogai Horde. Edigu was from the Crimean Manghud tribe, the son of Baltychak, a Turkic noble who was defeated and killed by Khan Tokhtamysh of the Golden Horde in 1378. He gained fame as a highly successful general of Tokhtamysh before turning the arms against his master. By 1396, he was a sovereign ruler of a large area stretching between the Volga and Ural (known locally as Yayyk) rivers, which would later be called the Nogai Horde. In 1397 Edigu allied himself with Timur-Qutlugh and was appointed General and commander-in-chief of the Golden Horde armies. In 1399 he inflicted a crushing defeat on Tokhtamysh and Vytautas of Lithuania at the Vorskla River. Thereupon he managed to unite under his rule all Jochi's lands, albeit for the last time in history. In 1406 he located his old enemy Tokhtamysh in Siberia. Edigu's agents killed Tokhtamysh. The following year he raided Volga Bulgaria. In 1408, he staged a destructive Tatar invasion of Russia, which hadn't paid the tribute due to the horde for several decades. Edigu burnt Nizhny Novgorod, Gorodets, Rostov, and many other towns but failed to take Moscow, though he had still burnt it. Two years later Edigu was dethroned in the Golden Horde and had to seek refuge in Khwarezm. Though he had previously had relations with the Timurid ruler Shah Rukh, including marrying his daughter to the latter's son Muhammad Juki,Devin DeWeese, Islamization and Native Religion in the Golden Horde (2010), p. 338 Shah Rukh later had Edigu expelled back to Sarai. There he was assassinated by one of Tokhtamysh's sons in 1419. Edigu's dynasty in the Nogai Horde continued for about two centuries, until his last descendants moved to Moscow, where they took baptism and became known as Princes Urusov and Yusupov.

Taxonomy Lewis's woodpecker was described and illustrated in 1811 by the American ornithologist Alexander Wilson in his American Ornithology; or, the Natural History of the Birds of the United States. Wilson based his description on some bird skins that had been collected on an expedition across the western portion of the United States led by Meriwether Lewis and William Clark in 1803‚Äì1806. Wilson coined the English name \\"Lewis's woodpecker\\" and the binomial name Picus torquatus. Unfortunately, the specific epithet was preoccupied by the ringed woodpecker, Celeus torquatus (Boddaert, 1783) and so in 1849 the English zoologist George Robert Gray coined a new name Picus lewis. \\"M. torquatus Add: Picus Lewis Drap.\\" This is a revision to p. 444. In the copy scanned for the BHL the pages are not numbered. The type locality is Montana. Lewis's woodpecker is now placed in the genus Melanerpes that was erected by the English ornithologist William John Swainson in 1832. The title page gives the date as 1831 but the volume was not actually published until the following year. The species is monotypic: no subspecies are recognised. Description One of the largest species of American woodpeckers, Lewis's woodpecker can measure up to in length. It is mainly reddish-breasted, blackish-green in color with a black rump. It has a gray collar and upper breast, with a pinkish belly, and a red face. The wings are much broader than those of other woodpeckers, and it flies at a much more sluggish pace with slow, but even flaps similar to those of a crow. Its calls have a harsh sound relative to other woodpeckers', and it may use a repertoire of several different phrases.https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Lewiss_Woodpecker/sounds Measurements: * Length: 10.2-11.0 in (26-28 cm) * Weight: 3.1-4.9 oz (88-138 g) * Wingspan: 19.3-20.5 in (49-52 cm) Range and habitat Lewis's woodpecker is locally common, dwelling mostly in open pine woodlands, and other areas with scattered trees and snags. Unlike other American woodpeckers, it enjoys sitting in the open as opposed to sitting in heavy tree cover. It ranges mostly in the western to central United States, but can winter as far south as the US border with Mexico and summer as far north as Canada. It has been seen in five Midwestern states: South Dakota, Michigan, Illinois, Minnesota, and Wisconsin. Feeding Lewis's woodpecker engages in some rather un-woodpecker-like behavior in its gregarious feeding habits. Although it does forage for insects by boring into trees with its chisel-like bill, the bird also catches insects in the air during flight, (typical insect hawking), a habit that only a few other woodpeckers, such as the Acorn woodpecker, the red-headed woodpecker and the northern flicker, engage in. Lewis's woodpecker also feeds on berries and nuts, and will even shell and store nuts in cracks and holes in wood to store until winter. It will also feed at flat, open bird feeders where it might act aggressively toward other birds. Breeding Lewis's woodpecker nests in a cavity excavated from a dead tree branch. The nest is constructed mainly by the male. The female will lay between 5 and 9 eggs, which are plain white in coloration. Both sexes incubate‚Äîthe female during the day and the male at night. Incubation lasts approximately 12 days, after which the young will hatch. The young leave the nest 4 to 5 weeks after hatching.

Arnold announced his retirement from running the hedge fund on May 2, 2012. Arnold now focuses on his philanthropy and political activism through Arnold Ventures LLC, and through Laura and John Arnold Foundation. Early life Arnold was raised in Dallas, Texas, and he was the younger of two sons. His mother later would work as an accountant at Arnold's Centaurus.New York Times: \\"CORPORATE CONDUCT: THE TRADER; Enron Trader Had a Year To Boast of, Even If...\\" By DAVID BARBOZA July 09, 2002 His father was a lawyer and died when Arnold was 17. A 1995 graduate of Vanderbilt University, he completed a degree in mathematics and economics in only three years. He is a member of Lambda Chi Alpha. Career =Enron= After college, he began his career at Enron as an oil analyst, but soon was promoted to assistant trader. In 1996, he moved to the Natural Gas Desk upon the departure of Jeff Bussan, trading natural gas derivatives. Using their new Internet-based trading network, EnronOnline, he is credited with making three quarters of a billion dollars for Enron in 2001 and was rewarded with the largest bonus in Enron history, some $8 million, days before the company declared bankruptcy costing shareholders $74 billion.New York Times, \\"Energy Trading, Post-Enron\\", January 15, 2006 His former colleagues dubbed him \\"king of natural gas.\\" (His brother, Matthew, also traded at Enron.) =Centaurus= In the wake of the Enron scandal in 2002, he founded Centaurus with his previous year's bonus. According to Arnold, \\"After Enron collapsed, there was a general revaluation of credit risk among energy companies. The better credits were less willing to take on the lesser credits as counter parties. So the lesser credits found themselves with fewer counter parties willing to trade with them, even though they still needed to hedge the pricing risks in their business. Hedge funds previously had not been involved in the over-the-counter market, except for the very largest, because the other participants were reluctant to grant credit to that type of entity.\\" During the collapse of Amaranth Advisors, Centaurus is widely credited as being one of the major players on the other side of their position, returning as much as 150% in 2005. At an energy conference, Arnold stated that he looks \\"to place bets on a market that he determines is 'biased'... we ask ourselves can we identify what is forcing a market to price a product at an unfair value, and then, what will push it back to fair value.\\" Referring to the speculative trading taking place on the unregulated over-the-counter Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) and NYMEX's Clearport Trading, he said: \\"Trading never went away... what has changed is the non-commercial type of interest... because of this there has never been as much investor interest as there is today.\\" During August 2008, Centaurus acquired around 10% of the shares of National Coal Corporation (NCOC).Houston Business Journal, \\"Centaurus scoops up National Coal shares\\" August 29, 2008 Arnold gave a public speech to the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), in which he opposed limits on financially settled trading positions but supported limits in the physical energy futures as they near expiration.

In October 2018, it was reported that Arnold had spent more than $100 million in health-care related grants since 2014, with a particular focus on reducing pharmaceutical drug costs. Arnold also has been an influential supporter of Democrats‚Äô efforts to pass a drug-price reform bill. Since 2008, the foundation has invested more than $1 billion, ostensibly in the areas of pension reform, pretrial and criminal justice reform, prescription drug price reform, the quality of academic research, combating predatory higher education practices, the evaluation of social programs, school system governance reform, and electoral reform. However, the organization has also generated controversy with its algorithmic pretrial risk assessment tool that has been sued for potentially leading to at least two murders. In 2016, the group funded allegedly unconstitutional aerial surveillance of Baltimore's historic neighborhoods. In 2019, the organization was transformed into a limited-liability company composed of the former foundation, a donor-advised fund, and the Action Now Initiative advocacy organization - the new entity is known as Arnold Ventures LLC with the charter \\"to remove barriers between data and decisive action, working swiftly across the policy-change spectrum.\\" Controversy Arnold Ventures LLC is embroiled in controversy for \\"using a personal fortune to bend criminal justice and bail reform to one‚Äôs ideological worldview\\" by funding a pre-trial web tool that is designed to help decide whether bail is necessary and how much.

Development of a special rifle (AS) \\"Shaft\\" began in the first half of the 1980s in the Central Research Institute of Precision Engineering (TSNIITOCHMASH), in the city of Klimovsk, Moscow region. The lead designer of the rifle is . It was developed in 1987 by TsNIITochMash (Central Institute for Precision Machine Building). Since 1987, it was added to the arsenal of the Soviet Army and the KGB and is used by Russian Spetsnaz and the MVD, FSB, OMON, SOBR, GRU, and select units of the Russian Army. Due to the rifle being both expensive and in limited quantity, it is very rarely deployed according to some Russian Spetsnaz operators. It is deployed in special operations that are either sabotage or reconnaissance units behind enemy lines and is a favorite of Spetsnaz operators. The AS Val and VSS proved to be very effective and remain in service with elements of the Russian army and special forces and Moscow‚Äôs intelligence and security forces. The suppressed rifles saw action during the last years of the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan and played prominent roles in the Chechen wars and the conflict in Georgia. Most recently, they have seen action during Russia‚Äôs interventions in Crimea and Syria. Design left left The AS Val has an effective range of approximately 300 m, as it uses heavy subsonic 9√ó39mm SP-6 (high-performance armor-piercing) ammunition, as well as the SP-5 ball cartridge used by the VSS Vintorez suppressed sniper rifle. It can also use the same 10- or 20-round magazines of the VSS Vintorez and the 30-round magazine of the SR-3M. Controls are similar to all AK-type rifles with charging handle on the right side, tangent rear sight, magazine release button behind the magazine well, and safety lever above the trigger guard. The fire selector is, however, located within the trigger guard, behind the trigger. The rifle has two modes of fire, semi-automatic and fully automatic fire, and has a cyclic rate of fire of 900 rounds per minute (RPM). According to its users, the AS Val is reliable, accurate, and well liked. The rifle has an AK-type side mount for various optical sights, including the 4x PSO-1 scope and night sights such as the 1PN51 calibrated for use with the 9√ó39mm cartridge. The standard open sights are graduated up to 400 m in 25 m increments. The AS Val shares 70% of its components with its sister-gun, the VSS Vintorez. The differences are a skeletonized steel stock which folds to the left for storage and transportation (gun can operate with stock folded but it cannot be fitted with a scope while the stock is folded). The reliability of the rifle is said to be equivalent to the AKM, including functioning in difficult conditions such as dust, dirt, sand, rain, at a temperature range from -50 ¬∞C to +50 ¬∞C. Variants A right-side view of the ASM Val. ASM Val - The ASM Val is a modernised variant of the AS Val, GRAU designation 6P30M.

The principal writer was Peter Heylin but Birkenhead brought satire, slanders and incisive polemics which the parliamentary party found difficult to rebuff. His loyalty to the royalist party was rewarded on the restoration of the monarchy when he was made licenser of the press and joint editor, with Henry Muddiman, of the new official news-book Mercurius Publicus. His contribution to journalism after the restoration was slight, concentrating more on a political career and being elected MP for Wilton, Wiltshire in June 1661.

It includes nearly of plant collections, gardens and natural areas. The site includes approximately 12 miles (19 km) of hiking trails and roadways for a four-mile (6 km) driving tour.  History  Beman Dawes was born in 1870 and grew up in Marietta, Ohio. His father ran a lumber business and also served one term as a U.S. Representative. Bertie Burr was born in 1872 in Lincoln, Nebraska. Her father served as mayor of Lincoln and as a U.S. Senator. The two married in 1894 and eventually had five children. Around 1917, the couple bought a 140-acre farm in Licking Township and dubbed it \\"Daweswood.\\" The farm served as a retreat for the family, who also had a home in Columbus, and a place to nurture trees and plant specimens collected from around the world. The arboretum had doubled in size by the time it was officially founded in 1929. Beman and Bertie Dawes created the foundation \\"to encourage the planting of forest and ornamental trees ... to give pleasure to the public and education to the youth.\\" Dawes Arboretum was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2016. Around 270,000 visitors a year come to the park. Beginning in 2019, Dawes Arboretum plans to charge admission to visitors for the first time in the organization's history.  Features  The Dawes Arboretum's features more than 15,000 living trees, shrubs, flowers and other plants, as well as the Daweswood House Museum, which features Dawes family memorabilia and antiques. The grounds include a number of gardens and natural areas. The Japanese Garden, designed by landscape architect Dr. Makoto Nakamura in 1963, includes a reflecting pond and meditation area. The arboretum features one of the northernmost native bald- cypress swamps in North America, which visitors can walk through on a boardwalk. Jefferson salamander and spotted salamanders are present in the swamp from late winter through spring. The Dutch Fork Wetlands is a 70-acre wetland and grassland ecosystem located on the arboretum grounds. The original wetlands and habitats disappeared and changed due to years of agriculture practice. The area was restored into a diverse ecosystem, and mammals, birds and insects make the wetlands their home. Visitors either explore the wetlands alone or take a guided tour.

At times he was referred to by his relatives as \\"weeping willow\\"Maylunas, Mironenko, p.12 and was a much beloved member of the imperial family. Childhood Grand Duke George as a child with his parents, brother Nicholas and sister Xenia. George was named after his mother's elder brother, King George I of Greece.Lerche, Mandal, p.174 As an infant, he was stronger and healthier than his brother Nicholas. He could be described as a typical Romanov. George was tall, unlike his elder brother Nicholas, handsome and full of fun. He was always getting into mischief and, because his mother had a great weakness for him, getting away with it.Hall, p.93 Like his siblings, he was brought up in a spartan fashion in the English manner. They slept on camp beds, rose at six and took a cold bath, although occasionally they were allowed to take a warm bath in their mother's bathroom. Breakfast was usually porridge and black bread; mutton cutlets or roast beef with peas and baked potatoes were served for lunch; bread, butter and jam at tea-time. Cake was a special treat. Nicholas and George had a sitting-room, dining-room, play-room and bedroom, all simply furnished. The only trace of ostentation was an icon surrounded by pearls and precious stones.Hall, p.61 George's mother taught him that family life was important. Because of his parents' happy marriage, he was brought up in an atmosphere of love and security missing in many royal households. On 27 May 1883, George's parents were crowned in a magnificent ceremony in the Uspensky Cathedral in the Kremlin in Moscow. The Emperor and Empress received the homage of the Imperial Family, including their sons, Nicholas and George, both in uniform. It was a major occasion in the life of the young Grand Duke.Hall, p.103 The family lived mostly in the security of the palace at Gatchina. Education, career and health George was considered to be the cleverest of the Imperial children. He was also outgoing, like his mother.Hall, p.94 George and Nicholas shared the same tutors, but studied in adjoining rooms. They followed the course of the Academy of the Russian General Staff. Their tutors were distinguished professors. Their English teacher, Charles Heath, had once been tutor to their uncles, Grand Dukes Sergei and Pavel. Both brothers spoke and wrote faultless English. From Mr. Heath they acquired a love of sport, particularly shooting and fly-fishing. They also spoke fluent French and passable German and Danish. George displayed signs of a promising career in the Navy before falling ill with tuberculosis in 1890.Lerche, Mandal, p.181 The Emperor and Empress both decided to send Nicholas and George on a nine-month-long trip to Japan in 1890. George would go as a naval cadet and Nicholas to complete his education by seeing something of the world. Their mother hoped the warm sun and the sea air would improve George's health. They left Gatchina on 4 November 1890. The Empress had never been separated from her sons for such a long time and she missed them terribly. \\"You cannot imagine how sad and hard it is to be without you, my angel, and how dreadfully it hurts to think of this long separation\\", she wrote sadly.Hall, p.144 Nicholas and George first went by warship to Athens where they were joined by their cousin, Prince George of Greece, known as \\"Greek Georgie\\". From there, they traveled to Egypt. From Bombay in India, Nicholas telegraphed that his brother George had to remain on ship because he had trouble with his leg. Although George assured his parents that he was perfectly well, they were suddenly informed he had a fever and would have to return home. The Empress was alarmed. \\"You can't imagine in what anguish I have passed these last few days\\", she wrote. \\"In spite of all the reasoning ... I had to take things calmly, and to tell myself that it ... is only this horrible malaria that will pass with a change of air ...\\" Hall, p.145 George, in fact, had acute bronchitis and was sent back to Athens where he could be examined by the Imperial doctors. The Empress was distressed for both brothers: George, whose disappointment she felt deeply and Nicholas, who was now deprived of his brother's company. Tsesarevich Grand Duke George Alexandrovitch. In November 1894, Alexander III died and Nicholas mounted the throne as Emperor. At the time, Nicholas had no children, thus according to the laws of succession of the Russian Empire, the Grand Duke George became Tsesarevich, the heir presumptive to the throne.Sometimes the non-Russian world rendered this as Tsarevich. This was an older title commonly used in Russia before Peter the Great's 1721 reforms for any son of a Tsar, including non-Russian Tsars. After 1721, sons of the Russian Tsar were titled Grand Duke.Barkovets, Tenikhina, p.97 George's ill-health had forced him to relocate to Likani. It was impossible for him to return to St. Petersburg for the funeral of his father, Alexander III. The doctors had forbidden it.Hall, p.165 Nicholas wrote to his brother, \\"... constantly pray to God to send you a full and speedy recovery, and to comfort you, because it is so much more difficult to be alone after such great sorrow than it is for us who are at least together!\\" Maylunas, Mironenko, p.108 George also missed the christenings of Nicholas' elder daughters, Olga and Tatiana. Shortly after the birth of Nicholas' third daughter, Maria, in June 1899, George wrote to his brother, \\"I am terribly sad that I have not yet been able to see your daughters and get to know them; but what can I do! It means it's not my fate, and everything is the will of God.\\" Maylunas, Mironenko, p.172 Visits from his mother to Likani were greatly enjoyable. In 1895, George and his mother visited Denmark. They had not seen their Danish relatives for four years. It was sad as it was the first time for both of them without the late Tsar. Then suddenly, his health deteriorated, \\"Yesterday, in the garden, he expectorated some blood...that frightened me more than I can tell - the surprise of it was shocking, because he had been so well of late...I am quite desperate that this should have happened here\\" Maylunas, Mironenko, p.176 As a result, George was forbidden to smoke and confined to bed until he was fit enough to return to Likani. Writing to Nicholas back home once again, George said about his trip to Denmark, \\"Of course it was good to see the family after 4 years, but it did not really do me any good, as I lost more than 5 pounds which I had put on with such difficulty in May and June. I also get out of breath more easily. So these are the results of my trip. Very annoying.\\" Maylunas, Mironenko, p.119 Death Grand Duke George Alexandrovich in 1889 George died suddenly in Abastumani, on 10 July 1899, at the age of 28. He had been out alone on his motorcycle and some hours later, when he failed to return, his worried staff sent out a search party. By the time they found him it was too late. A peasant woman had discovered him collapsed at the side of the road, blood oozing from his mouth as he struggled to breathe. She supported him in her arms until he died.Hall, p.186 George and brother Nicholas Deathplace of George Alexandrovich in Abastumani, Georgia The news reached Nicholas by telegram and he had the difficult task of telling his mother. She broke down and wept. He had seldom been out of her thoughts for the last few years and his death came as a terrible shock. His family were completely devastated. Nicholas was especially grief-stricken at losing his younger brother and childhood playmate. Grand Duke Konstantin Konstantinovich wrote, \\"Everyone was struck, as if by lightning, by this sad and unexpected news.Hall, p.173 Queen Victoria wrote to Nicholas II, \\"Pray accept the expression of my sincerest sympathy in this great sorrow, for I know the affection you had for your poor brother Georgy, whose life was so sad and lonely.\\" The Dowager Empress telegraphed Queen Victoria, \\"Thank you so much for kind sympathy in this terrible sudden bereavement... My poor dearest son died quite alone. Am heartbroken.\\" On 14 July 1899, he was laid to rest in the St. Peter and Paul Cathedral in Saint Petersburg, not far from his late father, Alexander III. During the service, his mother stood without tears, only deep suffering was imprinted on her face. When the coffin was put down into the tomb, Maria Feodorovna stood next to Xenia, holding her arm-in-arm and suddenly, looking at her daughter with widely open, unseeing eyes, she loudly said, \\"Let's go home. Let's go home, I cannot stand it anymore!\\" and she rushed out. When a board was laid down for leaving the tomb, she went away so quickly that it was difficult for others to keep pace with her. Nobody even had enough time to throw flowers on to the tomb. In the carriage she sobbed for a long time, pressing to her breast George's hat that she took off the coffin's cover.Diary of Grand Duchess Xenia Alexandrovna for 1899, State Archives of the Russian Federation f.662, op.1, d.13, 1,97-97v Legacy Nicholas II always remembered George and his wonderful sense of humour. He would tell great jokes that amused his brother very much. Nicholas would dutifully write out the best jokes on pieces of paper and save them in a box. Years later, the Tsar would be heard laughing by himself in his room, looking through his old box of George's jokes. George's title as Heir Presumptive was passed to his younger brother, Michael, until the birth, in 1904, of Nicholas' son, Alexei. In 1910, Michael named his newborn son, George, after his late brother. This George would also die young; he was killed in a car crash in 1931 at the age of 20. DNA evidence Decades later his body was disinterred from the grave in the Cathedral of St. Peter and Paul in St. Petersburg so that a sample of DNA could be taken from the remains to see whether skeletal remains allegedly belonging to his older brother, the last Tsar of Russia, Nicholas II, were legitimate or not. The DNA sample obtained from the Grand Duke's remains indicated that he was closely related to the DNA sample from the presumed remains of Nicholas II, confirming their identity. After the completion of DNA testing, the remains of Grand Duke George Alexandrovich were once again laid to rest not far from those of his older brother and family.Hall, p.356 Titles, styles and honours =Titles and styles= *9 May 1871 ‚Äì 1 November 1894: His Imperial Highness Grand Duke George Alexandrovich of Russia *1 November 1894 ‚Äì 10 July 1899: His Imperial Highness The Tsesarevich of Russia =Honours= * : Knight of St. AndrewJustus Perthes, Almanach de Gotha 1899 (1899) p. 94 * : Grand Cross of St. Stephen, 1885\\"A Szent Istv√°n Rend tagjai\\" * : ** Knight of the Elephant, 9 October 1889 ** Commemorative Medal for the Golden Wedding of King Christian IX and Queen Louise, 1892 * : Grand Cordon of the Order of the Chrysanthemum, 14 May 1891 * : Knight of the Black Eagle * : Knight of the Golden Fleece, 22 April 1896 Ancestry Notes References   Category:1871 births Category:1899 deaths Category:Russian grand dukes Category:Honorary Members of the St Petersburg Academy of Sciences Category:19th-century deaths from tuberculosis Category:House of Holstein-Gottorp-Romanov Category:Burials at Peter and Paul Cathedral Category:19th-century Russian people Category:Tsesarevichs of Russia Category:Sons of emperors Category:Recipients of the Order of St. Andrew Category:Grand Crosses of the Order of Saint Stephen of Hungary Category:Recipients of the Order of the Black Eagle Category:Knights of the Golden Fleece of Spain ","title":"Grand Duke George Alexandrovich of Russia"},{"id":"2443669","text":"The Regional Chair of Ottawa-Carleton was the head of the regional council which controlled the Regional Municipality of Ottawa-Carleton since its formation in 1968.

It was originally developed in the 1980s by Jean-Raymond Abrial in France and the UK. B is related to the Z notation (also originated by Abrial) and supports development of programming language code from specifications. B has been used in major safety-critical system applications in Europe (such as the automatic Paris M√©tro lines 14 and 1 and the Ariane 5 rocket). It has robust, commercially available tool support for specification, design, proof and code generation. Compared to Z, B is slightly more low-level and more focused on refinement to code rather than just formal specification ‚Äî hence it is easier to correctly implement a specification written in B than one in Z. In particular, there is good tool support for this. The same language is used in specification, design and programming. Mechanisms include encapsulation and data locality. Recently, another formal method called Event- BEvent-B.org ‚Äî Event-B and the Rodin Platform. has been developed. Event-B is considered an evolution of B (also known as classical B). It is a simpler notation, which is easier to learn and use. It comes with tool support in the form of the Rodin tool. The main components B notation depends on set theory and first order logic in order to specify different versions of software that covers the complete cycle of project development. =Abstract machine= In the first and the most abstract version, which is called Abstract Machine, the designer should specify the goal of the design. =Refinement= *Then, during a refinement step, he may pad the specification in order to clarify the goal or to turn the abstract machine more concrete by adding details about data structures and algorithms that define, how the goal is achieved. *The new version, which is called Refinement, should be proven to be coherent and including all the properties of the abstract machine. *The designer may make use of B libraries in order to model data structures or to include or import existing components. =Implementation= *The refinement continues, until a deterministic version is achieved: the Implementation. *During all of the development steps the same notation is used and the last version may be translated to a programming language for compilation. Software =B-Toolkit= The B-Toolkit, developed by Ib Holm S√∏rensen et al., is a collection of programming tools designed to support the use of the B-Tool, a set theory based mathematical interpreter, for the purposes of a formal software engineering methodology known as the B method.

History Originally named the Captain Scott after explorer Robert Falcon Scott, Shabab Oman was built as a standing topgallant yard schooner by Herd and McKenzie of Buckie, Scotland in 1971. Built for the Dulverton Trust, she was run by the Loch Eil Trust in programs which combined sail training with onshore expeditions. In 1967, Victor Clark and Kurt Hahn had enlisted Prince Philip's aid in finding sponsorship for a new youth- training ship. Clark then skippered her until 1974. In 1977, the vessel was sold to Sultan QƒÅb≈´s bin Sa‚Äòƒ´d of Oman and placed under the purview of the Ministry of Youth. Her name was changed to Shabab Oman, which can be translated as \\"Youth of Oman.\\" In 1979, she was inducted into the Royal Navy of Oman (RNO) as a sail training ship. In 1984, Shabab Oman was refitted as a barquentine. Construction Shabab Oman is constructed of Scottish oak and pine from Uruguay. Her lower masts are aluminum alloy, and her upper masts and spars are rattan plywood She is 52 metres long and 30 meters high. Career In 1992 the ship took part in the Gran Regatta de Colon sailing from C√°diz to San Juan, Puerto Rico along with other tall ships from throughout the world led by recreations of the Ni√±a, Pinta, and Santa Mar√≠a. In 1989, J Lawson Modelmakers of Lincolnshire, England were tasked to build a half scale replica of the ship as part of the Sultanate of Oman Navy involvement in the 21st national Day celebrations.

Licensed to Monroe, Louisiana, the station is owned by Holladay Broadcasting. Most of KMLB's schedule is made up of nationally syndicated conservative talk shows, including Rick and Bubba, Moon Griffon, Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, Dave Ramsey, Michael Savage, and Coast to Coast AM with George Noory. Weekends feature Kim Komando, Bill Cunningham, Ben Ferguson, Bill Handel and Somewhere in Time with Art Bell. Most hours begin with world and national news from ABC News Radio. KMLB operates at 4000 watts by day, using a non-directional antenna, covering parts of Louisiana, Arkansas and Mississippi. But because AM 540 is a clear-channel frequency reserved for Canada and Mexico, the station must drastically reduce power at night to 26 watts. All programming is simulcast on FM translator K289CG at 105.7 MHz. History On July 1, 1930, KMLB first signed on at 1440 kHz.Broadcasting Yearbook 1977 page C-90 It was founded by the Liner Family of Monroe. In July 1946, the station signed on an FM sister station, KMLB-FM, eventually broadcasting on 104.1 MHz (now KJLO-FM). In 2008, KMLB purchased 540 KNOE and moved all programming to that dial position because the coverage was better than 1440 AM. On October 4, 1944, KNOE first signed on, at 1230 kHz. It was founded by former Governor of Louisiana James A. Noe. In November 1948, the Federal Communications Commission approved a frequency shift for KNOE from 1230 to 1390 kHz with a concurrent increase in power from 250 watts to 5000 watts. At that time, the station was an NBC Red Network affiliate. On September 27, 1953, the station signed on a TV station, Channel 8 KNOE- TV.Broadcasting Yearbrook 1977 page B-108 On January 9, 1967, 101.9 WNOE-FM (now KMVX) came on the air. Noe's son, James Albert \\"Jimmie\\" Noe Jr., ran KNOE for almost four decades, along with its FM and TV sister stations. When Jimmie Noe died from cancer in 2005, the remaining family members agreed to place the stations up for sale and exit broadcasting. In November 2006, the Noe family reached an agreement to sell this station to Clay Holladay's Holladay Broadcasting; the following year, its other stations would be sold, with KNOE- FM sold to another Holladay subsidiary, Radio Monroe; and KNOE-TV sold to Hoak Media Corporation. On March 6, 2007, the station announced extensive programming changes, moving Rush Limbaugh to KNOE and adding new programming. According to the news story, KMLB, then at 1440 AM, would be a \\"general interest talk\\" station while 540 KNOE would become a \\"political talk\\" station. In the summer of 2008, KNOE became KMLB. All programming was consolidated on 540 AM from the higher frequency. The 1440 AM frequency was taken off the air, with its license surrendered to the Federal Communications Commission.

His film appearances included popular releases such as Brighton Rock (1947), The Dam Busters (1955), The Great Escape (1963), The Lion in Winter and The Lost Continent (both 1968), and Russian Roulette (1975). Between 1964 and 1968, Nigel Stock became a household name in the UK for his portrayal of Dr. Watson in a series of Sherlock Holmes dramas for BBC television. Later in life, he portrayed the mentor of Sherlock Holmes in Young Sherlock Holmes. His other numerous television credits included Danger Man (1965), The Avengers (1964 & 1966), The Prisoner (1967), The Doctors (1969-71), Owen, M.D. (1971‚Äì73), Quiller (1975), Van der Valk (1977), the Doctor Who serial Time Flight (1982), Yes Minister (1982), Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy (1979) and for a BBC dramatisation of A Tale of Two Cities (1980) as well as The Pickwick Papers (1985) as Mr. Pickwick. Stock and his third wife, Richenda Carey, had just appeared together on stage in the world premiere of Mumbo Jumbo in May 1986, when, on 23 June 1986, he died in Camden, London of a heart attack, aged 66. Personal life Stock was married three times. He married his first wife, Catherine Hodnett, in 1943; the couple had one son and divorced in 1947. His second marriage was to Sonia Williams in 1951. They divorced in 1980 after having three children together. Stock's third and final marriage was to actress Richenda Carey in 1979. They remained married until his death in 1986.

Carmines was born in Hampton, Virginia. Although his musical talent appeared early, he decided to enter the ministry, attending Swarthmore College, majoring in English and philosophy, and then Union Theological Seminary in the City of New York, earning a bachelor of divinity in 1961 and a master of sacred theology in 1963. Carmines was hired by Howard Moody as an assistant minister at Judson Memorial Church on Washington Square Park, New York, to found a theater in the sanctuary of the Greenwich Village church in conjunction with playwright Robert Nichols. He began composing in 1962 and acted as well. His Bible study group grew into the Rauschenbusch Memorial United Church of Christ, with Carmines as pastor. Carmines taught at Union Theological Seminary and received the Vernon Rice Award for his performance and the Drama Desk Award for Lyrics and Music and was awarded the Obie award for Life Time Achievements. Carmines is perhaps best remembered in the church for the hymn \\"Many Gifts, One Spirit\\" #114 in the United Methodist Hymnal. He was commissioned by the United Methodist Women to write this hymn for their General Assembly in 1974. Carmines' musicals reflected his eclectic interests, including: * Abraham Lincoln, * Christmas, * Gertrude Stein, * Aristophanes, * Winnie the Pooh, * gay relationships, and * St. Joan. Carmines' Judson Poets' Theater, with other burgeoning theatres Caf√© Cino, La MaMa E.T.C. and Theatre Genesis were experimental and vibrant challenges to the commercialization and conformity of Off Broadway and Broadway houses. His 1973 musical The Faggot was a succ√®s d'estime which transferred from the Judson Memorial Church to the Truck and Warehouse Theatre and ran for 203 performances. In 1977, he had a cerebral aneurysm that required months of therapy. He underwent surgery a second time in 1985, which only then cured his crippling headaches. He died in St. Vincent's Hospital in New York, survived by his partner Paul Rounsaville. Carmines found as much spiritual meaning in the theater as the church: \\"If you want to know how to live, go to church. If you want to know how your life is in its deepest roots, go to the theater.\\"  Theatre credits  * What Happened (1963) - composer; a setting for the works of Gertrude Stein * Home Movies/Softly Consider the Nearness (1964) - composer, actor * Patter for a Soft Shoe Dance (1964) - composer * Sing Ho for a Bear (1964) - composer, actor (as Winnie the Pooh) * Gorilla Queen (1967) - composer, lyricist * San Francisco's Burning (1967) - composer * Song of Songs - composer; a cantata based on the Bible * The Sayings of Mao Tse-tung (1968) - composer; another cantata * In Circles (1968) - composer, actor * Peace (1969) - composer; an adaptation from Aristophanes * Christmas Rappings (from 1969) - lyrics, music, actor, director; annual Xmas show held at Judson Memorial Church, and eventually taped for a television special * Promenade (1969) - composer, musical director * The Urban Crisis (1969) - composer, lyricist; a \\"secular oratorio\\" * About Time (1970) - composer; another oratorio * W.C.

Unlike lindy hop, however, it is a choreographed dance designed for performance. It is danced by both couples (usually of mixed gender) and groups, either all-female or four to eight couples together. This is normally a very fast and physically demanding dance.  History  During the development of the musical genre rock and roll, dances to go with the music were also created. From swing, which came into being around 1920, Lindy Hop emerged, the first partner dance ever to feature acrobatic elements. Lindy Hop was modified around 1940 to suit faster music, creating the style known as boogie woogie.  Technique and basics  Like other forms of dance, Rock and Roll has evolved around the world over time. Depending on your location, the basic kick step style starts with the Basic 6 step: Leader starts with left foot kick ball change, kick step (left), kick step (right) Follower starts with right foot kick ball change, kick step (right), kick step (left) There is another form of tap step basic footwork that is quite easy to learn: Leader starts with their left foot and does a back step, then a tap step (left), tap step (right) Follower starts with the right foot and does a back step, then a tap step(right), tap step(left) The most obvious feature of the Acrobatic rock and roll dance are its kicks (into thin air) and its acrobatic elements like lifts, jumps, throws and flips. Today's rock and roll is focused on show and competition dance and - with the exception of its name - has nearly nothing in common with the former rock and roll movement. It is danced in pairs or in formation and can even be danced with one male and two females simultaneously which is called \\"triples\\". Over the years rock and roll dancing has experienced several important changes: the former 6-basic step was converted into the modern tournament's 9-basic step with its typical kick ball change. Other characteristics are techniques such as the man's body wave movement, that he uses to fling his partner from a sitting position upwards, and the throwing basic movement, where she steps onto his hands and is catapulted upwards into neck breaking jumps. Because of its demanding technique, high speed, and acrobatics, Rock and Roll is a straining high-performance dance and is most often performed by young dancers. The name of the basic comes from the number of separate actions. With the 6-basic one counts (1)step (2)step (3)kick (4)settle (5)kick (6)settle or (1)kick (2)settle (3)kick (4)settle (5)kick (6)settle, with the 9-basic it is (1)kick (2)ball (3)change (4)kick (5)settle (6)settle (7)kick (8)settle (9)settle. This means that a correct rock and roll kick will have the supporting foot settling on the floor a tiny moment before the kicking foot settles.  Dance categories  The \\"swan\\", a popular acrobatic move in the Junior class. The World Rock'n'Roll Confederation recognizes the following dance categories for international competitions: WRRC - Rules - Rock'n'Roll retrieved 2010-03-10 * Youth: No acrobatics allowed. Couples are 14 years old or younger. * Juniors: A maximum of four acrobatic moves are allowed under the category's safety regulations. Couples are between 12 and 17 years of age. * B-Class: Two dances per couple and round. One is a dance program with no acrobatics allowed (footwork, or foot technique), the other an acrobatic program (acrobatic) requiring six acrobatic moves. The male may throw the female into the air, but no flips are allowed. Minimum age is 14 years. * Main Class: Two dances, like in B-Class. Only difference to B-Class is that almost all acrobatics (e.g. lifts, jumps, throws and flips) are allowed. Minimum age is 15 years. National associations usually have additional classes (e.g. a C class for beginning competitive dancers). However, all have the four classes listed above (though some rules may differ).  Rhythm and music  Rock and roll dance works on the 4/4 measure. One basic comprises six beats and therefore one and a half measures. Differently than the offbeat of rock and roll music, the dance puts stress on the first and third beats of each measure. The music is very fast, between 176 and 208 bpm. Due to non-off beat stressing and speed traditional rock and roll music has been replaced by modern disco and pop music.  Clothes  Currently advanced tournament rock and roll dancers don't wear petticoats and jeans - as the original rock and roll dancers did - but rather multi-coloured costumes that are made of elastic artificial fibre and can only be purchased as individual pieces by special tailors. One reason for that is that acrobatic elements have grown more and more dangerous, requiring both freedom of movement and enough durability to avoid tearing. The shoes worn is one of the most important elements in Rock & Roll dancing. Their soles need to possess both \\"slip\\" & \\"grip\\" characteristics. The most common footwear are light jazz shoes for the dance programs, while the acrobatic programs require more support for the female so sneakers made for aerobics dancers are usually chosen.  Organization  The World Rock‚Äôn‚ÄôRoll Confederation is the organization that takes care of national and international rules and guidelines for tournaments. They organize the World Cups, European championships and World championships that occur every year for couples and formations. All international competitors are ranked according to points acquired during competitions. The future for acrobatic Rock ‚Äôn‚Äô Roll seems bright, the hope and main goal is to have the dance as a part of the Olympic games within the near future. WRRC is today recognised by the IOC.

In accordance with the prevailing preference for Italian artists, he changed the spelling (but not the pronunciation) of his name and was always known as 'Signor Foli.' His family emigrated, and Foli spent much of his youth in Hartford, Connecticut.'Signor Foli says we are savages', San Francisco Call Vol 79 no. 180, 28 May 1896. Originally a carpenter, he studied singing under Bisaccia at Naples and made his first appearance at Catania in 1862. From the Paris Op√©ra he was engaged by Mapleson for the season of 1865, and made his London debut as St Bris in Les Huguenots. In the absence of Antonio Giuglini the company toured in late 1865 with Mario as principal tenor in Manchester, Dublin, Belfast and Liverpool. In January‚ÄìApril 1866 Mapleson split the company into two parties for a very extensive British provincial tour, Foli joining the ensemble of Mario, Grisi and Lablache under Arditi.J.H. Mapleson, The Mapleson Memoirs 1848‚Äì1888 (Chicago, New York & Sand Francisco: Belford, Clarke & Co., 1888 edition), I, 86‚Äì89. Opera, oratorio and concert In that year of 1866 he was introduced at the Royal Philharmonic Society.R. Elkin, Royal Philharmonic. The Annals of the Royal Philharmonic Society (London: Rider & Co. 1946), 63. Thereafter he appeared regularly as principal basso for Mapleson, with much success in various parts. In 1866 he appeared in a short run of Il Seraglio with Th√©r√®se Tietjens, Hans von Rokitansky and Clarice Sinico:C. Santley, Student and Singer: the Reminiscences of Charles Santley, 3rd Edition (London: Edward Arnold 1892), p. 244. and in 1868 he was with Clara Louise Kellogg, Z√©lia Trebelli, Bettini and Charles Santley in La Gazza Ladra (Il Podest√†).Santley, Student and Singer, p. 259. In 1869, the season in which the Gye and Mapleson resources were combined, Foli was in the opening production of Norma with Tietjens, Sinico and Mongini, and in the Rigoletto which followed it.Santley, Student and Singer, p. 272. He took the role of Daland in the first performance of The Flying Dutchman in England in 1870 with Santley as Vanderdecken and Ilma de Murska as Senta.Santley, Student and Singer, p. 285-86. Herman Klein mentions his Bertramo in the 1872 Drury Lane production of Robert le Diable with Christine Nilsson, Italo Gardoni, Mongini and de Murska.H. Klein, Thirty Years of Musical Life in London 1870‚Äì1900 (New York: The Century Co., 1903), 154. He was famous for his Sparafucile (Rigoletto) and Commendatore (Don Giovanni), and had a repertoire of some 60 operas. Foli's career in concert and oratorio at the principal festivals developed alongside his operatic work, often with the same colleagues. In 1866 he appeared with Santley in a performance of Israel in Egypt given by the National Choral Society at the old St Martin's Hall.'Death of Signor Foli', The Graphic, 28 October 1899, p. 610. In February 1867 he scored a success in Haydn's The Creation with the Sacred Harmonic Society.A. Chitty, 'Signor Foli', in G. Grove (Ed.), A Dictionary of Music and Musicians (1900). Santley and Foli sang The Lord is a man of war in the Handel Festival of 1868.Santley, Student and Singer, p. 264. He took the role of Jacob in the first production of Macfarren's Joseph at the Leeds Festival, 21 September 1877, and Herod in that of L'Enfance du Christ of Berlioz under Charles Hall√© in Manchester (30 December 1880) and London (26 February 1881).Chitty, 'Signor Foli', Grove 1900. He sang in the first performance of Gounod's La R√©demption in 1882. In Sydney, Australia in May 1892 Foli had a great success with Haydn's The Creation but, in July, a failure with Mendelssohn's Elijah, for which he was suffering from a sore throat.'Mendelssohn's Elijah', Sydney Morning Herald, 7 July 1892: 'Haydn's Creation,' Sydney Morning Herald, 6 August 1892. During the 1890s, in his late fifties, he was singing Messiah in England in company with Adelina Patti, Emma Albani and Edward Lloyd.San Francisco Call 28 May 1896. He appeared in concert, oratorio and opera in various countries. He toured in Russia (Moscow and St Petersburg) in 1873, where he made a great success in Israel in Egypt and as Pietro in Auber's opera Masaniello. In Mapleson's first American tour in the autumn of 1878 he was in company with Etelka Gerster, Minnie Hauk, Z√©lia Trebelli, Italo Campanini and many others, and appeared in a particularly notable I Puritani with Gerster and Campanini at Chicago.Mapleson Memoirs, I, 199, 207‚Äì08. He returned several times to America, was also heard in Vienna, and in the 1890s he toured in Australia'Signor Foli in Australia', Barrier Miner (Broken Hill, New South Wales), 21 December 1918. and New Zealand,Review of a Concert in Auckland 1892 and in Canada.Foli Concerts in Toronto, April‚ÄìMay 1897, see Daily Mail and Empire 21 April 1897, 4 May 1897 In addition to stage performance, through the 1870s Foli appeared regularly with leading singers in the Grand Operatic Concerts at the Royal Albert Hall.See Davidson's Musical Programmes, Cat. e.1399.a (British Library Music Collections) In 1877, with Santley, Nilsson and Ciro Pinsuti,Sims Reeves was also involved, but unable to take part. assisted by Arthur Chappell, he gave a benefit concert which raised ¬£1500 towards an annuity for their colleague Mario, who was then living in Rome in straitened circumstances.C. Santley, Reminiscences of My Life (London: Sir Isaac Pitman & Sons 1909), 146. He was among the contributors at the Retirement Concert of Sims Reeves at the Royal Albert Hall on 11 May 1891,C.E. Pearce, Sims Reeves: Fifty Years of Music in England (London: Stanley Paul & Co. 1924), p. 296. and sang in two concerts in the first Promenade season (1895), including the final concert, the benefit for Robert Newman.H.J. Wood, My Life of Music (London: Victor Gollancz Ltd 1946 edition), p. 83. In England he also appeared frequently at the Boosey popular Concerts. Songs described in the tours of Australia and Canada give some idea of his recitals, such as Pinsuti's Bedouin Love Song, Formes's In Sheltered Vale, Battison Haynes's Off to Philadelphia, Schubert's The Wanderer, Loder's The Diver, Knight's Rock'd in the Cradle of the Deep, the 'Drinking' song In cellar cool, Gatty's True till Death, and stand-alone operatic pieces such as Qui sdegno non-s'accende (Mozart, Die Zauberfl√∂te), She alone charmeth my sadness (Gounod, La reine de Saba) and O ruddier than the cherry (Handel, Acis and Galatea), all of which remained in the standard English concert repertoire well into the twentieth century, and were recorded by such singers as David Bispham, Peter Dawson, Robert Radford or Norman Allin. Foli's voice was powerful but of beautiful quality, its compass from the bass E to F above middle C.The Graphic, 28 October 1899, p. 610. With his vigorous, straightforward delivery, he was a great favourite in London for many years. George Bernard Shaw referred to the certainty and spontaneity of his roulades.G.B. Shaw, Music in London 1890‚Äì1894 (3 Vols) (London: Constable & Co 1932), I, p. 72. Recordings Foli was one of the very earliest classical musicians to make a phonograph recording. He did this at The Crystal Palace in 1878, and the fact was described and reported in the press.Public demonstrations of the phonograph in the Board- room at the Crystal Palace are mentioned (for instance) in the London Daily News 20 April 1878, and over the following three months. A description drawn from The Daily Telegraph shows that at a private recording session at the Crystal Palace on Good Friday 1878, \\"both duets and solos were successfully tried by Madame Lemmens-Sherrington, M. Lemmens, Signor Foli, M. Manns and other skilled musicians.\\"See, e.g., 'The Wonderful Phonograph', The Worcestershire Chronicle, Saturday 27 April 1878, page 6, col. 4. In another report of Foli's recordings, \\"... the accomplished vocalist, to test the powers of the phonograph, sang a verse of 'Jack's Yarn' into it. In a few seconds the ruby point was properly adjusted over the sheet of tinfoil, and the selection repeated as sung by the Signor, though, of course, in not so loud a tone (the sound issues from the machine as from a distance). Thereupon Signor Foli's friend purchased the sheet of tinfoil, with the remark that when he returned to New Jersey he would give the many friends of Signor Foli there a treat. He meant to put the tinfoil on an exactly similar phonograph at New Jersey, and have the song repeated. Whether the experiment succeeded has not yet transpired.\\"'Facts and Scraps', The Worcestershire Chronicle, Saturday 7 September 1878, page 6, col. 1. The recording is not known to have survived, nor, probably, is any recording of him known. Character In 1879 he appeared as witness at the Old Bailey, in a forgery case relating to authorship of a song, 'The Tar's Return', which had been written for Foli and sold to him for his public endorsement.Old Bailey Proceedings Online: Dobrowolski, 20 October 1879. He apparently possessed a frightening temper: the story is told of a disagreement with a head waiter in a well-known restaurant, in which Foli threw his dinner, plate and all, out of the window to make the point that the meal was unsatisfactory, shouting 'That's what's wrong with it, and now what are you going to do about it?' Amid the general laughter his anger soon evaporated.P. Dawson, Fifty Years of Song (Hutchinson & Co Ltd: London 1951), 120‚Äì21. He is said to have been an inveterate gambler, and a successful one, and to have visited Monte Carlo annually.Barrier Miner, 21 December 1918. Signor Foli died very suddenly in October 1899 at Southport, having gone to Liverpool to see off Miss Clara Butt, who was sailing for America on a tour.The Graphic, 28 October 1899, p.610. Having been a frequent and successful operator on the Stock Exchange, he left his wife Rosita and his brothers and his two sisters (who lived at Tacoma, Washington) well provided for. The estate led to a lawsuit.New York Times, 31 October 1900.

Born in Liverpool, Ashcroft began his career with several local sides, briefly signing as an amateur with Everton, before moving south and joining Southern League side Gravesend United in 1899. He was quickly spotted by nearby Woolwich Arsenal of the Football League, and signed as a professional for the Gunners in June 1900. Ashcroft immediately made his debut against Burton Swifts on 15 September 1900; although Arsenal lost 1‚Äì0, Ashcroft kept his place and remained an ever-present for that season, and the following one. In 1901‚Äì02, Ashcroft kept 17 clean sheets in 34 League matches for Woolwich Arsenal, including six clean sheets in a row (a club record, that has only been equalled once since, by Alex Manninger in 1998); Arsenal finished fourth in the Second Division that season, and third the season after that. Ashcroft kept 20 clean sheets in 1903‚Äì04, a club record, as Arsenal gained promotion to the First Division, and in 1904‚Äì05 set a then record of 154 consecutive matches for the club (since only bettered by Tom Parker). Arsenal reached the 1905‚Äì06 and 1906‚Äì07 FA Cup semi-finals twice with Ashcroft in goal, and he also won three caps for England, playing in all three of England's British Home Championship matches of 1906 (England won twice and lost once, sharing the 1905‚Äì06 championship with Scotland). Ashcroft thus was Arsenal's first England international. In all, Ashcroft played 303 first-class games in eight seasons for Arsenal. He was sold to Blackburn Rovers in the summer of 1908, in order to alleviate the club's financial problems at the time. For Rovers, he played over 120 times and reached another FA Cup semi- final in 1910‚Äì11, and won the First Division title in 1911‚Äì12. In 1913 he was released by Blackburn on a free transfer; unable to find a club he was forced to place an advert in The Athletic News, which read: :J Ashcroft, goalkeeper, Blackburn Rovers, open for engagement; free transfer ‚Äì Willaston Road, Walton, Liverpool.

Molecularly, gingerol is a relative of capsaicin and piperine, the compounds which are alkaloids, though the bioactive pathways are unconnected. It is normally found as a pungent yellow oil in the ginger rhizome, but can also form a low-melting crystalline solid. This chemical compound is found in all members of the Zingiberaceae family plant and is high in concentrations in the grains of paradise as well as an African Ginger species. Cooking ginger transforms gingerol via a reverse aldol reaction into zingerone, which is less pungent and has a spicy-sweet aroma. When ginger is dried or mildly heated, gingerol undergoes a dehydration reaction forming shogaols, which are about twice as pungent as gingerol.NSF International Determination of Gingerols and Shogaols in Zingiber officinale rhizome and powdered extract by High-Performance Liquid Chromatography This explains why dried ginger is more pungent than fresh ginger. Ginger also contains [8]-gingerol, [10]-gingerol, and [12]-gingerol, collectively deemed gingerols. Physiological potential In a pre-clinical meta-analysis of gingerol compounds anticancer, anti-inflammatory, anti- fungal, antioxidant, neuroprotective and gastroprotective properties were reported, which include studies in-vitro and in-vivo. A few in-vivo studies have proposed that gingerols facilitate healthy glucose regulation for diabetics. Many studies have been around the effects of gingerols on a wide range of cancers including leukemia, prostate, breast, skin, ovarian, lung, pancreatic and colorectal. There has not been much clinical testing to observe gingerols physiological impacts in humans. While many of the chemical mechanisms associated with the effects of gingerols on cells have been thoroughly studied, few have been in a clinical setting. This is due to the high variability in natural phytochemicals and the lack of efficacy in research. Most herbal medicine, which include gingerols, are under the restrictions of the Food and Drug Administration in the United States and experimental methods have not held up to scrutiny which has decreased the value in phytochemical research. Herbal medicine is untested for quality assurance, potency and effectiveness in clinical settings due to a lack of funding in eastern medical research. Most research on [6]-Gingerol has been on either mouse subjects (in-vivo) or on cultured human tissue (in-vitro) and may be used in the future to discuss possible applications for multi-target disease control. An investigation scrutinizing gingerol's anti-fungal capabilities remarked that an African species of ginger tested higher in both gingerol and shogaol compounds than the more commonly cultivated Indonesian relative. When tested for the anti-fungal properties the African ginger combated against 13 human pathogens and was three times more effective than the commercial Indonesian counterpart. It is thought that gingerol compounds work in tandem with the other phytochemicals present including shogaols, paradols and zingerone. A few established cellular pathways effected by [6]-gingerol that result in apoptosis of a cancerous cell. ABBREVIATIONS: CDK: Cyclin-dependent kinase; PI3K: Phosphoinositide 3-kinase; Akt: Protein kinase B; mTOR: Mammalian target of rapamycin; AMPK: 5‚Äôadenosine monophosphate- activated protein kinase; Bax: Bcl-2-associated X protein; Bcl-2: B-cell lymphoma 2. In a meta analysis looking at many different phytochemical effects on prostate cancer, two specific studies using mice observed [6]-gingerol compounds induced apoptosis in cancer cells by interfering with the mitochondrial membrane. There were also observed mechanisms associated with the disruption of G1 phase proteins to stop the reproduction of cancer cells which is also an associated benefit of other relevant anticancer studies. The main mechanism by which gingerol phytochemicals act on cancer cells seems to be protein disruption. The anti-carcinogenic activity of [6]-gingerol and [6]-paradol was analysed in a study observing the cellular mechanisms associated with mouse skin cancer which targeted the activator proteins associated with tumor initiation. Gingerol compounds inhibited the transformation of normal cells into cancer cells by blocking AP-1 proteins and when cancer did develop paradol encouraged apoptosis due to its cytotoxic activity. [6]-Gingerol exhibits cell cycle arrest capabilities, apoptotic action and enzyme-coupled cell signaling receptor degradation in cancer cells. Gingerol has been observed to stop proliferation through inhibiting the translation of Cyclin proteins necessary for replication during G1 and G2 phase of cell division. To promote apoptosis in cancer cells Cytochrome C is ejected from the mitochondria which ceases ATP production leaving a dysfunctional mitochondria. The Cytochrome C assembles an apoptosome which activates the Caspase-9 and initiates an executioner Caspase cascade, effectively breaking down DNA into histones and promoting apoptosis. [6]-Gingerol also inhibits the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins on the surface of mitochondria, which in turn increases the capabilities for the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins to initiate cell death. Cancer cells exhibit high amounts of growth hormone activator proteins that are expressed through enzyme-coupled signaling pathways. By halting the phosphorylation of PI-3-Kinase the Akt protein cannot bind with its PH domain, effectively deactivating the downstream signal. Successively keeping Bad proteins bound to anti-apoptotic proteins which keeps them from promoting cell growth, consequently, a double negative cellular signaling pathway to promote apoptosis. Cultured human breast cancer cells were subjected to various concentrations of [6]-gingerol to determine the impacts on live cells. These concentration dependent results concluded that there was no impact at 5 ŒºM but a reduction of 16% occurred at 10 ŒºM. [6]-gingerol targeted three specific proteins in breast cancer cells that promote metastasis and while adhesion remained relatively unchanged, [6]-gingerol inhibited the cancer cells from invading and increasing in size. This study suggests the mechanism by which cancer cell growth was impacted was due to a reduction in specific mRNA that transcribes for extracellular degrading enzymes called matrix metalloproteinases (MMP's). An examination using human cells in-vitro displayed gingerols capabilities in combating oxidative stress. The results concluded that gingerol had anti-inflammatory effects though shogaol showed the most promising effects combating free radicals. There was an inverted dose- concentration response and as dosage concentration increased the amount of free radicals in cells decreased. Cisplatin is a chemotherapy drug that if used in high dosages causes renal failure which is considered a limiting factor for this life saving drug. By using [6]-gingerol it prevented the occurrence of renal failure in rats. [6]-gingerol improved glutathione production in dose-dependent results which suggested that the higher a dosage the more of an effect [6]-gingerol had. Gingerol compounds are thought to help in diabetic patients because of increases in glutathione, a cellular toxin regulatory factor. Anti- hyperglycaemic effects were studied in diabetic and severely obese mice. Gingerol compounds increased glucose uptake in cells without the need of a synthetic insulin activator, while also increase fasting glucose and decreasing glucose tolerance. In a different study the exact metabolic mechanisms associated with the physiological benefits of gingerol phytochemicals concluded that there was increased enzyme activity (CAT) and glutathione production while decreasing lipoprotein cholesterol and improving glucose tolerance in mice. Cardio-arrhythmia is a common side effect of diabetic patients and the anti-inflammatory effects of gingerol suppressed the risks by lowering blood glucose levels in-vivo. The anti-oxidant properties of [6]-gingerol has been considered as a defense against Alzheimer‚Äôs. A study observed the molecular mechanisms responsible for the protection against DNA fragmentation and mitochondrial membrane potential deterioration of cells which suggests a neuroprotective support of gingerol. This study indicates that ginger up-regulates glutathione production in cells, including nerve cells, through anti-oxidative properties which decreases the risk of Alzheimer's in human neuroblastoma cells and mouse hippocampal cells. While many studies suggest the low risk of using ginger phytochemicals to combat oxidation damage to cells, there are a few studies that suggest potential genotoxic effects. In one study too high of a dose to human hepatoma cells resulted in DNA fragmentation, chromosomal damage and organelle membrane instability which could result in apoptotic behavior. There are some pro- oxidant behaviors to gingerol compounds when the concentration reaches high levels although also considered, in normal conditions these phytochemicals observed have anti-inflammatory and ant-oxidant qualities. In another study [6]-Gingerol notably inhibited the metabolic rate of rats when given an intraperitoneal injection which induced a hypothermic reaction though, when consumed orally in excess there were no changes in body temperature.  Biosynthesis  Proposed gingerol biosynthesis Both ginger (Zingiber officinale) and turmeric (Curcuma longa) had been suspected to utilize phenylpropanoid pathway and produce putative type III polyketide synthase products based on the research of 6-gingerol biosynthesis by Denniff and Whiting in 1976 and by Schr√∂der's research in 1997. 6-Gingerol is the major gingerol in ginger rhizomes and it possesses some interesting pharmacological activities like analgesic effect. While the biosynthesis of 6-gingerol is not fully elucidated, plausible pathways are presented here. Alternative proposed pathway In the proposed biosynthetic pathway, Scheme 1, L-Phe (1) is used as the starting material. It is converted into Cinnamic acid (2) via phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL). Then it is turned into p-Coumaric acid (3) with use of cinnamate 4-hydroxylase (C4H). 4-coumarate:CoA ligase (4CL) is then used to get p-Coumaroyl-CoA (5). P-Coumaroyl shikimate transferase (CST) is the enzyme that is responsible for the bonding of shikimic acid and p-Coumaroyl-CoA. The complexed (5) is then selectively oxidized at C3 by p-coumaroyl 5-O-shikimate 3'-hydroxylase (CS3'H) to alcohol. With another action of CST, shikimate is broken off from this intermediate, thereby yielding Caffeoyl-CoA (7). In order to get desired substitution pattern on the aromatic ring, caffeoyl-CoA O-methyltransferase (CCOMT) converts the hydroxyl group at C3 into methoxy as seen in Feruloyl-CoA (8). Up until this step, according to Ramirez-Ahumada et al., the enzyme activities are very active. It is speculated that some polyketide synthases (PKS) and reductases are involved in final synthesis of 6-Gingerol (10). Because it is unclear whether the methoxy group addition is performed before or after the condensation step of the polyketide synthase, alternative pathway is shown in Scheme 2, where methoxy group is introduced after PKS activity. In this alternative pathway, the enzymes involved are likely to be cytochrome p450 hydroxylases, and S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent O-methyltransferases (OMT). There are three possibilities for the reduction step by Reductase: directly after PKS activity, after PKS and Hydroxylase activity, or in the end after PKS, Hydroxylase, and OMT activity.

His latest recording is music by the famous Norwegian violinist and composer Ole Bull (1810-1880) 1984 aircraft emergency  In February 1984 he participated in an emergency evacuation on an SAS flight that ended up in the water off of JFK airport. Although instructed to leave their possessions, he refused to abandon his priceless Guarneri violin as they evacuated onto an inflatable raft. The evacuees had to paddle away from the airliner with their bare hands, and due to the lack of oars there arose several suggestions (though mostly in jest) to use the precious instrument as a replacement thereof.

Directed by Joel Lamangan, it stars Maricel Soriano, Assunta de Rossi, Angelica Panganiban, John Estrada, and Jason Abalos. Synopsis Vietnam Rose follows the journey of Nguy·ªÖn ƒê·∫∑ng Thi√™m Y·ªÉu, a Vietnamese woman, who embraces life in a foreign land to forget the memory of her tragic past. Y·ªÉu, resembling the plight of thousands of Vietnamese in the turbulent years of the War, was pushed out of her beloved nation. As her father, a Vietcong, fights out the invading forces, she discovers that her mother has betrayed them by having an affair with a Filipino soldier. Later on, this illicit affair comes back to haunt Y·ªÉu‚Äôs family, as her father is killed by the Filipino soldier. In the succeeding moments, Y·ªÉu is washed away to a foreign land ‚Äì the Philippines ‚Äì where she starts and builds a new life as a Filipino with a Vietnamese heart. Years pass and little Y·ªÉu has grown into Carina Mojica dela Cerna, a successful businesswoman who is married to man who belongs to one of the most powerful families in the Philippines. Seemingly living a perfect life, Carina has learned to adapt to Philippine ways, but continues to pay respects to her cultural background as a Vietnamese. All the while she also successfully hides a dark secret to her past. That is, until one mysterious night, when an image of her dying mother appears to her and begs her to come home to Vietnam. Carina is now being haunted by the past and thus realizes that her present unhappiness stems from her not being able to confront her past. She goes back to Vietnam to face her mother and settle things once and for all. However, as she arrives in Vietnam in an effort to move on, a complication confronts her. Carina meets her half-sister, ƒêo√†n ƒê·∫∑ng Thi√™n T√≠n, a smart young Vietnamese who has grown up in the outskirts of Ho Chi Minh City. Living a hard life with her mother, T√≠n has grown resentful of the sister who has abandoned them and was the source of her mother‚Äôs heart break. The two sisters are now forced to be together, bound by their sense of duty and a promise they had made to their dying mother to take care and love each other. Now is the start of an overly complicated relationship of love, hate, revenge and the attainment of ultimate happiness as Y·ªÉu, in her journey through life with her sister, learns that only through coming to terms with the past will she realize where her heart, caught between two worlds and two loves, truly lies.

Caparas' Panday or simply Panday () is a Philippine fantasy television series on ABS-CBN. The pilot episode of the first book (Panday: Unang Yugto) aired on November 7, 2005 replacing Ikaw ang Lahat sa Akin and ended with its last episode on December 9, 2005. The second book (Panday: Ang Ikalawang Yugto) aired its pilot episode on April 3, 2006 and ended with the series finale on May 26, 2006. The series is based on the fictional comics character of the same name, which was created by Carlo J. Caparas and illustrated by Steve Gan. Background Panday literally means \\"the blacksmith\\". Ang Panday is the TV adaptation of the Fernando Poe Jr. film series Ang Panday from the early 1980s. It is about a blacksmith who made an enchanted sword that gives him special powers to battle the dark forces. Some of the location shots were taken in a remote town in Bohol, where the beach is white. Locals called it \\"colgate-white\\". Plot A meteor crashes into the desert of Sto. Sepulcro. The town blacksmith, Flavio, forges a dagger and a churchbell from the remains of the meteor. He uses the dagger to fight off the evil Sombra Oscura, who constantly attacks the town. By some mystical power, the dagger transforms into a great sword every time Flavio wields it. In his final battle against evil, the Panday faces off against Lizardo, the son of Rodgin and the leader of the Sombras. The battle is intense, but Flavio prevails in the end, vanquishing Lizardo. Having saved Sto. Sepulcro, Flavio decides to give up his sword. He goes to the church and casts his fabled weapon into the bell he also made. A white light then shoots out from the sky, and it lifts up Panday into the heavens. The people of Sto. Sepulcro rejoice now that Panday has brought them peace. Unbeknownst to them, the Sombras discover that there is a part of Lizardo that is still alive -- his brain. To bring him back to life, they must transcend time and space to look for the girl who can resurrect their master. In that time, Tristan, (played by Jericho Rosales) as the town's blacksmith, forges another sword with the same Flavio created.

He was son of Jean de Foix, comte de Carmain, by his wife Aldonce. He studied Greek and Roman literature at Paris, and jurisprudence at Toulouse, where shortly after finishing his curriculum he delivered a course of lectures on civil law, which gained him great reputation. At the age of nineteen he was named councillor of the parlement of Paris. He was arrested on suspicion of harbouring Huguenot sympathies, but escaped punishment, and subsequently regained the favour of the French court.

It was the flagship station of the Radyo Patrol Network owned by ABS-CBN. The station's studio is located at the ABS-CBN Broadcast Center, Sgt. Esguerra Avenue, corner of Mother Ignacia St., Brgy. South Triangle, Diliman, Quezon City; its 50,000 watt transmitter is located at F. Navarette St., Brgy. Panghulo, Obando, Bulacan. DZMM was simulcasted via The Filipino Channel and also has a television channel aired on Sky Cable, Destiny Cable and Sky Direct, and as an exclusive cable news channel named TeleRadyo where the studio and hosts of its programs can be seen by its listeners and viewers. It can also be received in the United States on DirecTV Channel 2066. Some of the station's selected programming were also simulcasted via satellite over (Visayas Regions) DYAP Radyo Patrol 765 in Puerto Princesa, Palawan, DYAB Radyo Patrol 1512 in Mandaue City, Cebu, and (Mindanao Region) DXAB Radyo Patrol 1296 in Davao City. (these stations mentioned also broadcasts local programming in-between). As of May 5, 2020, the station suspended its broadcasting activities, together with that of its free television and sister radio stations, following the cease-and-desist order issued by the National Telecommunications Commission due to the expiration of ABS-CBN's legislative license to operate. At 05:00 (Philippine Standard Time) on May 8, 2020 however, most DZMM programming resumed as an online feed and through the TeleRadyo channel. History =Radyo Patrol's first literation: the early years= It began on October 19, 1953, when DZAQ, the forerunner of DZMM was the first radio station of the former ABS (Alto Broadcasting System) of the Quirinos under President Elpidio Quirino's brother, Antonio (originally came from the pre-1953 experimental station DZBC), opened its doors as a radio station using the Filipino language in its broadcasts, following what DZBC had done before as the first-ever radio station in Manila using Filipino instead of the English language used by other stations at that time. DZAQ 620 kHz featured news, variety and music programs on an AM format which then the progenitor of DZAQ-TV 3. Eddie Ilarde, Ike Lozada, German Moreno and Joey de Leon were the personalities of the station at that time. Its first radio studios were in Manila, sharing the same building with the television studios. In 1957, with the opening of the then new ABS radio and television studios in Pasay City, the DZAQ radio studios moved there. Years later, when ABS and the Lopez-owned Chronicle Broadcasting Network (CBN) were formally merged into a single network in 1967, DZAQ 620 kHz switched frequencies with CBN-owned DZXL 960 kHz and was later rebranded as DZAQ Radyo Patrol 960 kHz, one of the pre- martial law flagship AM stations of ABS-CBN until 1972. Orly Mercado, who was one of the station managers from 1969 to 1971, together with Ben Aniceto, came up with a vision to establish a 24-hour all-news and all-talk radio station and ABS-CBN conceptualized it under the Radyo Patrol brand ‚Äì the de facto successor of the ephemeral 24 hour news station DZQL Radyo Reloj, which CBN launched in 1956 (the very year it launched), and the first-ever 24-hour news radio station in the country and in Southeast Asia. The first and original Radyo Patrol team was unceremoniously organized following the aftermath of Super Typhoon Welming (International name: Emma) in 1967, at the old ABS-CBN Radio Broadcast Center in Aduana Street, Intramuros, Manila, which housed the station since it was moved in 1958. The then program manager Ben Aniceto and Chief Engineer Emilio Solidum created a solution to broadcast typhoon damage news from Manila and the surrounding areas. Using two VW Combis attached with a UHF transmitter, two teams of reporters were dispatched. Combi One had Al Mendez and Zoilo Paragas Jr as reporters; and Combi 2 with Bar Samson. DZQL and DZXL became the carrying stations with then current DJs Naldy Castro, Buddy Medina, Boots Baker, Mary Jane Madamba and even the late Ike Lozada alternating as anchors. Cesar Mortega was assigned to coordinate the broadcasts. The broadcasts proved to be a huge success for the corporation, and for its news service. Then came the magnitude 7.6 earthquake in Casiguran (in which Manila was severely affected by that quake). This strong earthquake lead to the collapse of the Ruby Tower in the capital's downtown districts. This was the second major news event as a progenitor to the current Radyo Patrol; this time, DZAQ took on the gargantuan task of informing the nation live as it happened. The Radyo Patrol Ruby Tower project was then handled by former DZAQ station manager Orly Mercado, and veteran broadcaster Joe Taruc; the first reporters assigned as Radyo Patrol reporters were Mercado himself, Jun Ricafrente, Mario Garcia, Chris Daluz and Ismael Reyes. The marathon radio-TV simulcast of a major coverage ‚Äî the first of its kind by a Philippine media firm, was a success, and the Radyo Patrol format later became an integral part of DZAQ's broadcasts, with the station's field reporters being assigned to cover breaking news stories and then calling the station to convey these stories as they happened. Encouraged by the success of the field reports of breaking news stories in the Greater Manila Area and beyond, DZAQ was later that year converted into a 24-hour uninterrupted news and commentary station by orders of the corporation management, covering many national events of great importance to listeners, as DZXL took over its entertainment and music programming. Based on a survey conducted by Seamark, Inc., DZXL was the most popular radio station in the country by mid-1970. At the same time, the original team of 5 field reporters was later expanded to include both young announcers, most notably Rey Langit (now with DZRJ-AM), Ernie Baron, and Manolo Favis (now with Radyo La Verdad 1350), and industry news veterans. By 1971, the success of the Radyo Patrol format in the Greater Manila Area had led to select ABS-CBN provincial radio stations establishing Radyo Patrol news services within their areas. =Martial law period and until 1986= However, on the night of September 23, 1972, operations of DZAQ, DZXL, DZMM-FM, DZAQ-TV and DZXL-TV along with 4 other ABS-CBN AM radio stations were halted as Metrocom forces seized ABS-CBN Broadcasting Centre two days after President Ferdinand Marcos declared martial law, even DZAQ/DZXL personalities were arrested because of strict censorship as it went off the air. Two years after the forced shut down of all radio and television stations, DWWW (Radyo Broadcast City), a crony-owned AM station of Kanlaon Broadcasting System or KBS (now known as Radio Philippines Network or RPN) began to air in 1973 which contained news, public service programs, drama and music. Veteran anchors and new recruits like Johnny de Leon, Rod Navarro, Joe Taruc and Vic Morales came into DWWW at that time. Dely Magpayo, Henry Jones Ragas, Gel Santos-Relos and Noli de Castro were among those who worked as station announcers. Under the Marcos crony control, the station was dubbed Pinakamatatag sa Buong Pilipinas (The strongest in the Philippines). Following the switch from NARBA- implemented 10 kHz to GE75-implemented 9 kHz in 23 November 1978, DWWW's frequency was reassigned from 620 to 630 AM, and gained a new home in Broadcast City in Diliman, Quezon City. On the third day of the 1986 EDSA Revolution, reformist rebels stormed into the RPN broadcast complex and DWWW knocked off from the air following the capture of channel 4 on the morning of February 24, 1986 and Channel 9 the day after. At the end, both DWWW of RPN and DWOK of BBC were sequestered by the government with ABS-CBN getting both stations as a result. =The return of ABS-CBN= The fall of the Marcos regime in the immediate aftermath of the People Power Revolution had paved the way for the return of ABS-CBN in the Philippine broadcasting scene. In April 1986, then newly formed Presidential Commission on Good Government handed over two radio stations, DWWW of RPN and DWOK of BBC, back to the network's control. DWWW then changed its callsign to DZMM and started preparations for the resumption of broadcasts. Lito Balquierda Jr., vice-president for radio, together with attorney Jake Lopez and Mr. Ben Aniceto spearheaded the return of the giant network to the local broadcasting scene. The network started recruiting both experienced and new employees including a new generation of Radyo Patrol Reporters. Their studios were initially located at the Chronicle Building in Pasig (where Benpres Corporation is currently located). After days of careful planning and a period of test broadcast which took place from July 16‚Äì21, 1986 (alongside DWKO-FM 101.9, which started broadcasting and the network's mother TV station ABS-CBN Channel 2, which re-opened on September 14), DZMM officially signed on the air with the new tagline \\"Ang Himpilan ng Malayang Mamamayan\\" (Station of the Independent People) on the afternoon of July 22, 1986 at 3 pm. Rene Jose (now with DWIZ and UNTV) delivered the first sign-on spiels, while Magpayo (who came from DWWW) was the first-ever anchor to grace the airwaves of the new station with her program Dear Tiya Dely (before she transferred to DZRH to continue her program until her death in September 2008), followed by other broadcast icons like Jun Ricafrente (who also became one of the original reporters of the pre-Martial Law Radyo Patrol era), Cesar Mortega, Ric Tierro and de Castro, newly recruited women Mel Tiangco (now with GMA Network) and Angelique Lazo (now with Radyo Veritas and PTV), as well as Ernie Baron and Kuya Cesar. Knowledge Power, the first-ever full-length program of the station was launched. It was also the country's first-ever scholastic program on AM radio. Mario Garcia, who was part of the original Radyo Patrol core and recruited from DWAN 1206, was the first station manager, months after its reopening. It was only in 1987 that the station was transferred to its current studios inside the ABS-CBN Broadcast Center in Quezon City from the former Chronicle Building in Ortigas Center, Pasig City. During its first years of operations, DZMM operated from sign-on to sign-off on a 19-hour-a-day to 20-hour-a-day schedule during that time. In 1987, the first-ever tandem on local AM radio was introduced. Mel Tiangco and Jay Sonza were the hosts of Mel & Jay and immediately became a hit to the listeners and lasted for a couple of years. It was also in the same year when DZMM build a remarkable roster of radio talents, including Ted Failon, Korina Sanchez, Frankie Evangelista, Gel Santos-Relos, Ernie Angeles (who also served its station's voice over during its first decade of operations), Neil Ocampo (deceased) and Jake Maderazo (now with Radyo Inquirer 990). As it was in the past, DZMM held on the tradition of the stalwart ABS-CBN Radyo Patrol (field reporters) of the 1960s and early 1970s to further develop the station's capabilities in serving the public. Jun Ricafrente, Radyo Patrol #3 (later transferred to Vic de Leon-Lima, now with DWIZ), one of the original members of the team, started training new recruits. The first of the 2nd generation reporters to be selected were RP #2 Claude Vitug, RP #4 Emil Recometa, RP #1 Lito Villarosa and RP #5 Neil Ocampo.Abs-Cbn ‚Äì Dzmm Main It was also in this year when military insurgents took over the station during the 1987 coup attempts. However, this did not stop DZMM from delivering news to the public, the booth was moved to then undisclosed location and immediately resumed broadcasting. In 1989, DZMM eventually evolved into a 24-hour round-the-clock broadcast service, in keeping up with the demands of delivering the news to the listeners. Failon, who is known for his distinct style of broadcasting, changed the landscape of Philippine radio broadcasting as he joined DZMM's roster of broadcasters the following year. And at the same time, he had a program with the station entitled Gising Pilipinas (originally known as Good Morning Pilipinas; unrelated to the now defunct morning show aired on PTV-4), formerly aired everyday at 2‚Äì4 am. =News coverages and events= Since 1986, DZMM reporters covered the biggest events in the late 80s and the early 90s like the Mendiola riot, August 1987 coup, Supertyphoon Sisang, MV Do√±a Paz tragedy, death of Ferdinand Marcos, December 1989 Christmas coup, Luzon earthquake, Mt. Pinatubo eruption and Gulf War. All of these were witnessed and listened on AM radio to listeners, together with ABS-CBN News team of reporters. These reports would be a source of pride for the station, reaping high praise from the public for its live and accurate reporting of news stories. =Public service on radio= In 1991, Aksyon Ngayon (Action Now), the first-ever program on AM radio devoted solely to public service was created. First anchored by Korina Sanchez and Ted Failon, Aksyon Ngayon instantly soared to the top of the ratings list. Because of the thousands of less-fortunate listeners flocking the station asking for assistance from the program, the executives decided to create DZMM Public Service Center, the first-ever separate office exclusively created for public service by a local AM station. However, Aksyon Ngayon aired its final broadcast on December 30, 2016, and was replaced by ABS-CBN Lingkod Kapamilya sa DZMM, hosted by Julius Babao and Bernadette Sembrano. On November 5, 1993, DZMM launched Pulis, Pulis Kung Umaksiyon, Mabilis. The program was first anchored by broadcast icons, Noli de Castro, Jay Sonza, and Mel Tiangco. It was created to keep the public informed on the activities of the Philippine National Police. It also became a venue for comments and grievances of the listening public on issues concerning the law enforcers. In 1996, DZMM became the first AM station in the Philippines to be made available in the World Wide Web with its inclusion in ABS-CBN website. All programs of the stations are broadcast live and can be enjoyed by Filipinos around the world via The Filipino Channel (TFC). =New slogan, Sky Patrol= In 1998, from Himpilan ng Malayang Mamamayan, DZMM, under the leadership of de Castro, then vice-president for Radio Network Division, was re-launched as DZMM Radyo Patrol 630 (named as counterpart of ABS-CBN's flagship primetime newscast, which de Castro is by then main anchor until 2001 and from 2010). By the end of 1999, DZMM moved its transmitting facilities from Libis, Caloocan City since before martial law to the state-of- the-art 50,000-watt transmission equipment were moved to Obando, Bulacan. On September 14, 1998, ABS-CBN Sky Patrol, the first-ever news chopper in the country, was launched. Anchored by Ricky Velasco, Sky Patrol changed the way of delivering and gathering news. ABS-CBN Sky Patrol is the news chopper of DZMM, ABS-CBN and the ABS-CBN News Channel. As of 2016, the Sky Patrol is not used anymore by the network and its sister stations; it was replaced by video drones as of 2017. =Kabayan= Since 1986, Kabayan (Kapangyarihan ng Mamamayan, Balita at Talakayan) is the longest-running radio program hosted by de Castro allowing to place a timeslot after DZMM Balita which focused on issues related to political and social situation. In February 2001, the last episodes of Kabayan (Kapangyarihan ng Mamamayan, Balita at Talakayan) aired. At the time, it was DZMM's top-rating morning radio program. The show had to end its run in order to allow de Castro to run for the Senate and the program was replaced by Todo Balita with RP #5 Neil Ocampo until 2010, when the show Kabayan (Kapangyarihan ng Mamamayan, Balita at Talakayan) officially returned to DZMM, with De Castro as the current host on Weekdays. In 2001, DZMM celebrated its 15th anniversary of broadcasting on-air by adapting its richly deserved positioner, \\"Una sa Balita, Una sa Public Service\\" (First in News, First in Public Service). It was also on the same year when the station tapped the power of text messaging with DZMM TxtPatrol (via 2366). DZMM's trademark drama theatre aired weekday afternoons, changing the way people perceived radio drama. The drama theatre featured the real life-stories of DZMM anchors like Bro. Jun Banaag, Joey Galvez, Sen. Alfredo Lim, and other personalities. It was also on the same year when Sports Talk was launched. This jam-packed sports-oriented program won CMMA's Best Sports Program on its first year of airing. Sports Talk was later renamed as Fastbreak since 2014. In 2005, listeners‚Äô first heard the DZMM theme. It was composed by Jessie Lasaten, with words of Bing Palao, Robert Labayen, and Peter Mus√±gi (former host of \\"Teka Muna\\", then later became the new host of Pasada Sais Trenta, and consultant of ABS-CBN Sports and the current voiceover of the network), and sung by Reuben Laurente, a former member of the music group The Company. On February 7, 2006, SikaPinoy was conferred with the Anvil Award of Merit by the celebrated Anvil Awards of the Public Relations Society of the Philippines (PRSP). =2006‚Äì2010= It was also in 2006 when DZMM celebrated its 20th Anniversary in Araneta Coliseum with a bang- dubbed as Happy 20 DZMM. The theme of DZMM was given a different twist with Sharon Cuneta singing the anthem. TeleRadyo is first televised via SkyCable channel 22 (then later channel 26), then later expanded on other cable providers and until eventually on the ABS-CBN TVplus as an exclusive news channel on digital free TV. In 2010, for the first time in Philippine radio history, DZMM and its rival station DZBB of GMA Network made history as they joined forces in the name of public service, when they had two children named James and Jesus Bantillan, asked for help to find the missing parents named Pascual and Norma Bantillan from Bohol on the now defunct Aksyon Ngayon and eventually reunited through the defunct rival program Aksyon Oro Mismo of DZBB. =2011‚Äì2016= On February 25, 2011, DZMM introduced their tagline Silveradyo, celebrating their 25th anniversary. Takbo Para sa Karunungan (Literacy Run), a fun run succeeding Takbo Para sa Kalikasan, was held at the Quirino Grandstand on March 13, 2011. A trade event of DZMM was held at One Esplanade at SM Mall of Asia on May 2011. The new station ID for the station's 25th anniversary was launched on June 12, 2011. Philippine Philarmonic Orchestra, UP Concert Chorus, Erik Santos and Angeline Quinto performed the anthem. In 2012, DZMM launched Red Alert (Response in Emergencies and Disasters) for regular citizens to prepare in times of natural calamities. The radio program temporarily went off the air in 2013, but returned in 2014 after the onslaught of Typhoon Yolanda (Haiyan). Because of this, the program became popular for its slogan Ligtas ang May Alam, and held various contests like Alert U and held the Red Alert Emergency Expo. Red Alert also became a TV program as a segment in Pinoy True Stories every Wednesday (formerly airs on Friday). The radio program later won different awards from the Philippine Quill Awards and the Hildegarde Awards respectively. In 2013, Radyo Patrol 24 Jun Lingcoran was appointed as the chief of Radyo Patrol Reporters, and served in his position until he retired in 2015. Lingcoran died on April 8, 2016, due to complications from his esophageal cancer. On April 19, 2016, the website of DZMM (dzmm.abs-cbnnews.com) was hacked by Bloodsec International and Anonymous Philippines, which both claimed responsibility of hacking the website. The hacking took place days before the final PiliPinas Debates 2016 presidential debates in Pangasinan, which was hosted by ABS-CBN and was also related to the COMELEC hacking, also done by Anonymous Philippines. The text posted by the hackers on that website said that our minds are constantly being invaded by legions of half-truths, prejudices, and false facts and the great needs of mankind is to be lifted above the morass of false propaganda. The hacking of the site did not affect their social media accounts nor the operations of the station and TeleRadyo, but did affect live streaming. The hacked website was later taken down by the mother network ABS- CBN and later replaced by a message that the site was down due to heavy traffic; days later the site was redirected to the main page of ABS-CBN News, but later replaced with a newer DZMM website (news.abs-cbn.com/dzmm/home). =30th Anniversary (2016)= In 2016, DZMM 630 celebrated its 30th anniversary on the airwaves since its inception in 1986. The new music video (coinciding with the anniversary) performed by Kapamilya actor and singer Piolo Pascual was launched during the Isang Pamilya Tayo: The ABS-CBN Flag Raising Ceremony held on Philippine Independence Day, June 12, 2016. The music video for the newest station ID was premiered on July 1 following TV Patrol, which the full video of the station ID was aired on ABS-CBN, ABS-CBN HD and DZMM TeleRadyo. An audio-only edition of this station ID was also broadcast, but only aired on this station and through its live streaming. The slogan for its 30th anniversary is \\"Balita, Public Service, Tatlong Dekada\\". DZMM TeleRadyo also had a refurbished datascreen on the same day after the new station ID. On July 22, 2016, exactly 30 years after its first sign-on, DZMM aired its anniversary special called Kuwento ng Tatlong Dekada ([The] Story of Three Decades), in different portions. An interview portion with former and present Radyo Patrol reporters #12 Rod Izon, #2 Claude Vitug, #26 Dindo Amparo and #38 Noel Alamar recalling the most notable stories of the past 30 years and their experiences was aired with Noli de Castro on Kabayan, while the most notable stories in the past 30 years were aired in between shows (mostly before) and some throwback remembrances are aired in some shows like Dr. Love Radio Show, Tandem: Lima at Oro, Dos Por Dos, Failon Ngayon, Pasada Sais Trenta, Todo-Todo Walang Preno, Aksyon Ngayon, Sakto, OMJ, Magandang Morning with Julius and Zen, Teka Muna, Usapang de Campanilla, Suhestiyon, Reaksyon at Opinyon, Ito ang Radyo Patrol, Radyo Patrol Balita Linggo and Omaga Diaz Report.

On July 19, 2019, Radyo Patrol Balita Alas- Dose aired its final episode to give way to the expansion of Headline Pilipinas which had moved to an early timeslot of 12:00 p.m. On January 27, 2020, DZMM has refurbished its title cards of most DZMM programs such as Failon Ngayon sa DZMM, Garantisadong Balita, Radyo Patrol Balita, Gising Pilipinas, Kabayan, Good Vibes, Todo-Todo Walang Preno, S.O.C.O. sa DZMM, On the Spot, Dos Por Dos, S.R.O. and Pasada Sais Trenta. On February 14, 2020, Just in time for the celebration of Valentine's Day, DZMM has launched its new program LOL: Labor of Love, (hosted by Arnell Ignacio and Rica Lazo), replacing the Friday edition of Usapang de Campanilla as well as MMK Klasiks on DZMM TeleRadyo. It airs Friday nights from 9:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m. On February 15, 2020, DZMM has launched its new program, Usapang Kalye (hosted by \\"Manong\\" Tim Orbos and Tina Marasigan), replacing Healthy Sabado. It airs every Saturdays from 1:00 p.m. to 2:00 p.m. On the same day, Headline Pilipinas started airing on weekends, replacing Radyo Patrol Balita Alas-Dose Weekend and Ito ang Radyo Patrol (which ended on February 8). However, it is set in a DZMM Studio instead of its main studio, as well as the introduction of weekend anchors, Joyce Balancio and Ricky Rosales presenting on Saturdays and Adrian Ayalin and Raya Capulong on Sundays. However, the Sunday edition runs at 30 minutes given that Yesterday airs at 12:30pm afterwards, while the Saturday edition runs for a full hour like the weekday editions. On February 16, 2020, Chismax and Salitang Buhay both reverted to its original timeslots, 7:00 p.m. to 8:30 p.m., and 8:30 p.m. to 10:00 p.m., replacing Pinoy, Panalo Ka!.

On the same day, the ANC, as an emergency measure, temporary simulcasts DZMM programs to local and international viewers but with own commercials, cutting its feed for the flagship Top Story. On March 19, 2020, DZMM, formally stops temporary the replay broadcasts of ABS-CBN News and Current Affairs programming at 1:00 p.m. (which began Monday as a result of the decision for the temporary halt of broadcasts of Good Vibes) and replaces them with a news simulcast from the ABS-CBN News Channel, another unprecedended decision, thus DZMM becomes the first radio station in many years, since the end of English broadcasts on DZRJ in the 2010s, to air English language news programming on the AM brand and by extension DZMM TeleRadyo becomes a pioneer in airing bilingual (Filipino and English) news programming in both cable and digital FTA television. The English broadcasts air from 1:00 p.m. (following Headline Pilipinas) to 10:00 p.m., Tuesdays, Thursdays and Sundays, with ANC's relay of DZMM programs on Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays and Saturdays (Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays starting at 8:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. following Early Edition), with a break at 9:00 a.m. for Market Edge during trading days in the Philippine Stock Exchange and 5:00 p.m. for Top Story. With this decision, DZMM TeleRadyo airs The World Tonight for the first time on FTA digital television on Tuesday, Thursday and Sunday nights for the first time since 1999, while taking a 6:30 p.m. break for the live simulcast of TV Patrol (weekdays only). After 10:00 p.m., DZMM 630 switches to hookup to sister station MOR 101.9, while TeleRadyo continues its simulcast of ANC regardless of schedule. On March 20, 2020, DZMM made history with the use of Zoom videotelephony software for the Friday night broadcasts of Labor of Love, Saturday afternoon broadcasts of Usapang Kalye, Good Job and Omaga-Diaz Report are simulcast on ANC, making it a pioneer among the country's news channels. On March 22, 2020, DZMM TeleRadyo moved to full 24/7 broadcasts provisionally on digital free-to-air and cable, with ANC programming being aired on Sunday late nights till 4:30 a.m. Mondays. On March 25, 2020, Headline Pilipinas aired for 90 minutes on DZMM TeleRadyo (and on ANC on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays) instead of the usual full hour as a provisional measure. On April 1, 2020, Kuwentuhang Lokal and Pasada 630 both became the first-ever DZMM programs to be aired fully using the Zoom platform. On the same day, DZMM Radyo Patrol 630 and DZMM TeleRadyo has switched to simultaneous telecast with the English language ABS-CBN News Channel starting at 10:00 p.m. As DZMM temporarily suspended its regular programming after asking all concerned on-duty personnel to go on self-quarantine for 14 days following their exposure to two Persons Under Investigation. The studio and facilities of DZMM have been vacated and will be immediately disinfected. Those who have not been exposed shall work from home. With this move, DZMM and DZMM TeleRadyo, as well as the provincial regional AM radio station, become English-only (for the first time in history after many years) as a provisional measure. From 5:30 p.m. to 10:00 p.m., the channel aired the best of ABS-CBN News and Current Affairs programming in their place with a 6:30 p.m. break for TV Patrol. On April 3, 2020, DZMM Radyo Patrol 630 and DZMM TeleRadyo resumes transmissions, with all programming are now aired via the Zoom platform; as DZMM TeleRadyo shares infrastructure, graphics, and commercials from ANC. On April 9‚Äì11, 2020, by virtue of a partnership between The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in the Philippines, given the effects of the enhanced community quarantine in Luzon and many other provinces, for the first time ever, the 190th General Conference of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, aired from the Conference Center in Temple Square, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA was officially broadcast countrywide on both free-to-air and cable, not just to members of the Church, but also to non-members on DZMM TeleRadyo during the Easter Triduum period, making it the first time it had been ever done via satellite delay. All the broadcasts on DZMM TeleRadyo on the same days were also simulcast as well on the ABS-CBN News Channel. This event was the very first time it had aired on Philippine television. On April 13, 2020, commercial feeds for both ANC and DZMM TeleRadyo for Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays and Saturdays are now separated after days of using a singular commercial feed. In addition, DZMM and DZMM TeleRadyo now resume use of the radio studios following disinfection measures, with SRO: Suhestyon, Reaksyon at Opinion as the first broadcasts to be aired from there. On April 20, 2020, after 4 weeks, the timesharing of programming between both DZMM TeleRadyo and ANC ends, with ANC now resuming separate programming on Mondays and DZMM slowly resuming broadcasts from the radio studios, though some programs are still produced through Zoom. On the same day, Headline Pilipinas now extends its time slot on DZMM TeleRadyo, starting at 12:15 p.m. and ending at 2:00 p.m. to accommodate more national and local reports. However, the overnight simulcasts on MOR 101.9 (for radio) and ANC (for TeleRadyo) were retained and broadcast after Dr. Love Radio Show starting at 11:00pm. On May 5, 2020, the station together with its ABS-CBN, S+A, and MOR Philippines subsequently signed off at 7:52pm due to its expiration of its franchise the day before. At 8:20pm, DZMM and its television counterpart went off the air followed by S.R.O.: Suhestyon, Reaksyon at Opinyon. On May 7, 2020, ABS-CBN, through its lawyers, filed a motion for a temporary restraining order (TRO) with the Supreme Court of the Philippines to stop the implementation of the NTC's cease-and-desist order and thus allow the DZMM and other ABS-CBN TV and radio stations to return to the airwaves whilst proceedings related to its franchise renewal are still ongoing. A decision on that motion is still pending. At 05:00 Philippine Standard time on May 8, 2020, DZMM-AM's television counterpart resumed operations, this time with its new name TeleRadyo with its refurbished logo and bumper, and its general commentary program, Pasada 630, was renamed Pasada sa TeleRadyo on the same day. However, the DZMM name is retained on its station bumper and its old DZMM TeleRadyo logo was reverted moments later. DZMM's online audio feed also resumed. On May 10, 2020, its television counterpart had its refurbished bumper and logo on use permanently. On May 13, 2020, a bill to grant ABS-CBN a provisional franchise (which will allow DZMM-AM to return to the airwaves whilst legislative proceedings for a longer-term franchise is ongoing) until 31 October 2020 was approved at the House of Representatives on second reading. It is still awaiting approval on third reading and if successful, the bill will go to the Senate for consideration. On May 17, 2020, TeleRadyo's first all new program debuted, the Sunday morning public service program Lingkod Aksyon co-produced with the Philippine Red Cross, with Henry Omaga-Diaz and PRC Chairman of the Board of Governors Senator Richard J. Gordon hosting. It airs as provisional replacement of Ma-Beauty Po Naman on 9 am Sundays. On June 10, 2020, Lingkod Kapamilya sa TeleRadyo, hosted by Bernadette Sembrano and Julius Babao, has expanded to two hours (10am to 12pm). Previously on March 17, the program has moved to 10am slot provisionally replacing \\"Sakto\\" to give way for the airing of PTV's \\"Public Briefing #LagingHandaPH\\" until June 9. On June 16, 2020, Health and infotainment program Good Vibes has returned this time on TeleRadyo, remotely hosted by Ni√±a Corpuz with Ahwel Paz and Dra. Luisa, replacing the 2pm edition of TeleRadyo special coverage on COVID-19 pandemic. On July 31, 2020, Dos Por Dos and Garantisadong Balita both air its final episodes after Gerry Baja and Anthony Taberna had announced on their programs that they will leave ABS-CBN, and it is now replaced by Kapamilya Daily Mass (through its hook-up via the Kapamilya Channel except Saturdays) and the expansion of Pasada sa TeleRadyo.

There are two full-time taught postgraduate courses: the MSc in Computer Science (approx 50 students total) and the MSc in Mathematics and the Foundations of Computer Science (MFoCS) (approx 15 students total). The department also offers the part-time Software Engineering Programme, a modular course for industry professionals, leading to either the MSc in Software Engineering (approx 240 students at present) or the M.Sc. in Software and Systems Security (approx 45 students at present). Research The department is home to around 145 academic and research staff. The department's doctoral programme has over 140 research students (studying for a D.Phil. ‚Äì the Oxford term for a PhD) working across a wide range of subjects in computer science and software engineering. After fifty years within the department, the Numerical Analysis group moved in 2009 to be part of the university's Mathematical Institute. Today the department's research is classified into eight broad themes: * Algorithms and Complexity Theory * Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning * Automated Verification * Computational Biology and Health Informatics * Cyber Physical Systems * Foundations, Structures, and Quantum * Human-Centred Computing * Information Systems * Programming Languages * Security Notable faculty the department employs 36 Professors. * Nigel Shadbolt, Professor of Computing * Samson Abramsky, Christopher Strachey Professor of Computing * Tim Berners-Lee, Professor of Computer Science * Richard Bird, Emeritus Professor * Luca Cardelli, Royal Society Research Professor * Bob Coecke, Professor of Quantum Foundations, Logics and Structures * Nando de Freitas, Professor of Computer Science * David Gavaghan, Professor of Computational Biology * Jeremy Gibbons, Professor of Computing * Leslie Ann Goldberg, Professor of Computer Science * Georg Gottlob, Professor of Informatics * Tony Hoare, Emeritus Professor * Ian Horrocks, Professor of Computer Science * Daniel Kroening, Professor of Computer Science * Marta Kwiatkowska, Professor of Computing Systems * Gavin Lowe, Professor of Computer Science * Bill Roscoe, Professor of Computing Science * Michael Wooldridge (computer scientist), Professor of Computer Science * Marina Jirotka, Professor of Human Centred Computing History Starting in 1952, mathematician Charles Coulson sought funding for Oxford to own its own computer. At this time university members had to hire computer time from elsewhere. In 1956 the University Grants Committee decided to fund the purchase of a Ferranti Mercury and the Oxford University Computing Laboratory was born (shortened OUCL or Comlab). As well as facilitating research elsewhere in the university, the new department had its own academic function, performing research in numerical analysis, and lecturing for mathematics and engineering students. The first director, Leslie Fox, was appointed in 1957 and the following year the department moved into its first home, 9 South Parks Road. In 1963 the department moved to 19 Parks Road. The Computing Services (From 2012 part of IT Services) was administratively split from the academic department in 1969, although complete independence was only gained in 1978. Complementing the Numerical Analysis Group, the Programming Research Group was set up in 1966 at 45 Banbury Road under the leadership of Christopher Strachey with the aim \\"to bring some coherence into the present ad hoc nature of programming and software\\". These two groups operated mostly separately until 1984 when both of the laboratory's research groups moved into 8‚Äì11 Keble Road, opposite Keble College. However the laboratory soon outgrew this space, and occupied space in 2 South Parks Road, until in 1993 the Wolfson Building opened behind the Victorian 8‚Äì11 Keble Road houses. The neighbouring houses at 5‚Äì7 Keble Road and a new \\"e-Science building\\" behind these provided additional space upon opening in 2007. However this space is not sufficient, and the department has additional space within the Thom Building and the Robert Hooke building. As of 2014, the department is hoping to obtain funding for a new building large enough to bring together all its activities. From 2003 to 2014 the department was led by Bill Roscoe, who oversaw the 2011 renaming from the Oxford University Computing Laboratory to the Department of Computer Science, University of Oxford. The current head is Michael Wooldridge.

It was formed in 2005 as University College for the Creative Arts at Canterbury, Epsom, Farnham, Maidstone and Rochester when the Kent Institute of Art and Design was merged into the Surrey Institute of Art & Design, which already had degree-awarding status; both constituent schools had been formed by merging the local art schools, in Kent and Surrey respectively. It was granted university status in 2008, and the name changed to the present one. In 2016 it merged with the Open College of the Arts. History The origin of the University for the Creative Arts lies in the establishment of various small art schools in the English counties of Kent and Surrey in the nineteenth century. In Kent the first of these was Maidstone College of Art, founded in 1867, and in Surrey the Guildford School of Art, founded in 1856. During the second half of the twentieth century many of these small art schools merged, eventually forming Kent Institute of Art & Design in 1987, and Surrey Institute of Art & Design in 1995. These two organisations joined forces in 2005 to become the University College for the Creative Arts at Canterbury, Epsom, Farnham, Maidstone and Rochester. In May 2008 the University College for Creative Arts was granted full university status by the Privy Council, and adopted its current name, the University for the Creative Arts, officially in September 2008.See David Haste, The Art Schools of Kent (London: Werther Press, 2013) Following the election of a Coalition government, the Department for Business Innovation and Skills introduced legislation to increase tuition fees while reducing government spending on Higher Education in real terms and the University for the Creative Arts was revealed to be the fourth most-cut university in England with a cut of 7.8% (10.2% in real terms). The University for the Creative Arts announced in February 2011 that it was discussing designating part of its Maidstone campus for use by MidKent College. Further to this, MidKent College expressed its willingness to buy the Maidstone campus from 2012 and phase out the UCA presence at the campus by 2014. =Timeline= * 1856 - Guildford School of Art is founded as Guildford Working Men's Institution * 1866 - Farnham School of Art is founded * 1867 - Maidstone College of Art is founded as Maidstone School of Art * 1868 - Canterbury College of Art is founded as the Sidney Cooper School of Art * 1886 - Medway College of Design is founded as Rochester School of Art * 1896 - Epsom School of Art & Design is founded as Epsom Technical Institute & School of Art * 1969 - Farnham School of Art and Guildford School of Art merge to form West Surrey College of Art & Design * 1987 - Canterbury College of Art, Maidstone College of Art and Medway College of Design merge to form Kent Institute of Art & Design * 1995 - Epsom School of Art & Design and West Surrey College of Art & Design merge to form Surrey Institute of Art & Design * 1999 - Surrey Institute of Art & Design receives University College Title from the Privy Council and is renamed Surrey Institute of Art & Design, University College * 2005 - Kent Institute of Art & Design and Surrey Institute of Art & Design, University College merge to form University College for the Creative Arts at Canterbury, Epsom, Farnham, Maidstone & Rochester * 2008 - University College for the Creative Arts at Canterbury, Epsom, Farnham, Maidstone & Rochester receives University Title from the Privy Council and is renamed University for the Creative Arts Campuses UCA has campuses in Canterbury, Epsom, Farnham and Rochester, together with teaching bases at the Royal School of Needlework and The Maidstone Studios, and a project and exhibition space in Folkestone Creative Quarter. It previously had a campus in Maidstone, which was closed in 2014. The university also validates provision at, or co-delivers courses with, a number of other educational institutions and arts organisations in the UK and overseas: Farnham Maltings, Laine Theatre Arts, London School of Design & Marketing, Millennium Performing Arts, Turner Contemporary and MIT Institute of Design. On 1 November 2016, the Open College of the Arts became part of UCA. This built on a close working relationship established in 2010. Organisation and academic life , and offers courses in a very wide range of architecture, art, design, fashion, media and performing arts subjects. Courses are offered at pre-degree further education, undergraduate, taught postgraduate and doctoral levels. The University is organised into seven academic schools: Canterbury School of Architecture; Communication Design; Crafts & Design; Fashion; Film, Media & Performing Arts; Fine Art & Photography; and Further Education. It has five research centres: Centre for Digital Scholarship, Centre for Sustainable Design, Crafts Study Centre, Fine Art & Photography Research Centre, and International Textile Research Centre.http://www.uca.ac.uk/news/gestures-resistance/ The UK's first Business School for the Creative Industries is based at UCA Epsom.http://www.uca.ac.uk/business-school/ =Rankings and reputation= =Chancellor= * 2010 - Zandra Rhodes * 2018 - Magdalene Odundo =Pro- Chancellors / Chairs of the Board of Governors= * 2008 - Loyd Grossman * 2012 - Robert Taylor =Vice-Chancellors= * 2005 - Elaine Thomas * 2011 - Simon Ofield-Kerr * 2017 - Alan Cooke (Acting) * 2017 - Bashir Makhoul  Alumni  *William McGregor, film and television director, directed programmes such as Poldark and Misfits *PJ Liguori, YouTube filmmaker *Chris Butler, storyboard artist, writer and director, known for his works at Laika, such as ParaNorman References External links * Category:Education in Canterbury Category:Education in Medway University for the Creative Arts University for the Creative Arts University for the Creative Arts University for the Creative Arts Category:Fashion schools in the United Kingdom Category:Design schools in the United Kingdom Category:2005 establishments in England Category:Educational institutions established in 2005 Category:Universities and colleges formed by merger in the United Kingdom ","title":"University for the Creative Arts"},{"id":"2443920","text":"Arbizu is a village and municipality in the province and autonomous community of Navarre, northern Spain, neighbouring Etxarri-Aranatz.

Known for her great charm and elegance as well as for her social commitment, she was an important promoter of the work of the German composer Richard Wagner and the Czech composer Bed≈ôich Smetana. She was also instrumental to the creation of the haute couture industry.http://www.fashionintime.org/history-haute-couture-first-couturier/  Life  Countess Pauline S√°ndor, daguerreotype by Hermann Krone, 1854 Pauline was born in Vienna into the Hungarian noble family of . Her father, Count M√≥ric S√°ndor (1805‚Äì1878), described as \\"a furious rider\\", was known throughout the Habsburg empire as a passionate horseman. Her mother, Princess Leontine von Metternich-Winneburg (1811‚Äì1861), was a daughter of the Austrian state chancellor Prince Klemens Wenzel von Metternich (known as the architect of the Concert of Europe). It was at his home in Vienna that Pauline spent almost her whole childhood. In 1856, she married her uncle, Prince Richard von Metternich (1829‚Äì1895), whereby her grandfather Prince Klemens Wenzel von Metternich also became her father-in-law.Paulina Sandor at thePeerage.com http://www.thepeerage.com/p44523.htm#i445229 The couple lived a happy conjugal life, despite Richard's frequent love-affairs with actresses and opera prima donnas. Their first child was Sophie (born 1857); her second daughter, Pascaline (b. 1862), married Count Georg von Waldstein-Wartenberg, an insane and alcoholic Czech aristocrat who was said to have murdered her in delirium in Duchcov (today in the Czech Republic) in 1890. Her youngest daughter, Clementine (b. 1870), was badly injured by her dog as a child and decided never to marry due to her scarred face. Socialite Princess Pauline, portrait by Edgar Degas, around 1865 Pauline accompanied her husband, an Austrian diplomat, on his missions to the royal Saxon court in Dresden and in 1859 to the imperial French court in Paris, where they lived for more than eleven years until the Franco-Prussian war of 1870/71. She played an important role in the social and cultural life of both Dresden and Paris, and, after 1871, Vienna. Pauline's regular travels between, and extended stays in, Paris and Vienna, permitted her to act as a cross-cultural transmitter of the many trends that interested her in music, political ideas, and sport. She was a close friend and confidante of French Empress Eug√©nie, and, with her husband, was a prominent personality at the court of Emperor Napoleon III. In 1860 she introduced fashion designer Charles Frederick Worth to the Empress and thus started his rise to fame. Princess Pauline was an ardent patron of music and contemporary arts, and also became a leader of fashionable society. Whether in Paris or Vienna, she set the latest social trends. She taught French and Czech aristocrats to skate, and ladies to smoke cigars without fear of their reputations. She was acquainted with many composers and writers, including Charles Gounod, Camille Saint-Sa√´ns, Prosper M√©rim√©e and Alexandre Dumas), and corresponded with them. She befriended music composers Richard Wagner (who dedicated a piano composition to her) and Franz Liszt, and backed their career. At her request, Emperor Napoleon III invited Wagner to substantially amend his Tannh√§user for a special 1861 performance by the Paris Op√©ra, a revision that forms the basis of what is today known as the \\"Paris version\\". The project failed (it closed after three performances) and became a celebrated fiasco and one of the greatest music-related scandals of the nineteenth century. Nevertheless, Pauline continued to spread the music of Wagner and other now-famous composers. Wagner later called her his most substantial support beside the Berlin socialite Marie von Schleinitz. One of her prot√©g√©s was the leading Czech musician of that time, Bed≈ôich Smetana, whom she introduced to the music circles of Vienna and Paris. Thanks to Pauline, Smetana's comic opera The Bartered Bride was produced in Vienna in 1892, to popular acclaim. She also organised salon performances of abridged versions of many famous operas, including Richard Wagner's Der Ring des Nibelungen, in which she took part both as a stage director and singer. The composer Karl Michael Ziehrer dedicated her one of his dances. In her private life, however, Pauline suffered several crises and disasters. As a child, she was an eyewitness to the bloody Revolution of 1848 in Vienna. In 1870 she remained at the side of Empress Eug√©nie in Paris during the Franco-Prussian War. Later she aided the Empress' escape from Paris to Great Britain by secretly sending Eug√©nie's jewels to London in a diplomatic bag. In Vienna, she was admired for her social engagement, but also feared for her gossiping. Her enmity with Empress Elisabeth of Austria was almost legendary and was enjoyed by the Habsburg court. After Elisabeth's death in 1898, Pauline together with Princess Eleonora Fugger von Babenhausen took the leading role of grand dames of the Vienna society. Duel Princess Pauline Metternich on the Beach, painting by Eug√®ne Boudin It is claimed that in August 1892, Pauline took part in a duel with Countess Anastasia von Kielmannsegg. The disagreement reportedly stemmed from a floral arrangement at the Vienna Musical and Theatre Exposition, of which the nobles were Honorary President and President of the exhibition, respectively. However there are no primary sources for the story, only accounts from foreign newspapers; furthermore, a denial by the Princess was printed in a French newspaper not long after the first accounts were published in which she calls the story a \\"ridiculous invention by Italian journalists.\\" The duel reportedly involved the participants stripping to the waist to reduce the risk of a wound becoming infected; the image of two topless nobles captured the imagination of artists and scandalized Victorians.  Legacy  Princess Pauline died in Vienna in 1921. She lived through the glory and fall of the Austrian and French empires and was believed to be a living symbol of these two lost worlds. A portrait of her by French impressionist Edgar Degas, painted from a photograph, now hangs in the National Gallery, London. She wrote two books of memoirs. The first, Gesehenes, geschehenes, erlebtes, in German, honored her grandfather, Chancellor Metternich, and father, Count Moritz S√°ndor, and the second, √âclairs du pass√©, in French, recalled her life and times in the court of Emperor Napoleon III and Empress Eug√©nie. Both were published posthumously in the 1920s.  Issue  Richard and Pauline von Metternich had three children : * Princess Sophie von Metternich-Sandor Winneburg (1857‚Äì1941) * Princess Pascalina Antoinette von Metternich-Sandor Winneburg (1862‚Äì1890) * Princess Klementina Marie von Metternich-Sandor Winneburg (1870-1963) Since the marriage produced no sons, Richard's title of \\"Prince von Metternich\\" passed to his half-brother, Paul von Metternich.

This population has been extinct since the 1950s. It was formerly regarded as a distinct tiger subspecies, under the scientific name Panthera tigris balica, which had been assessed as extinct on the IUCN Red List in 2008. In 2017, felid taxonomy was revised and this subspecies subordinated to P. t. sondaica, which also includes the still surviving Sumatran tiger. Results of mitochondrial DNA analysis of 23 tiger samples from museum collections indicate that tigers colonized the Sunda Islands throughout the last glacial period 11,000‚Äì12,000 years ago. In Bali, the last tigers were recorded in the late 1930s. A few individuals likely survived into the 1940s and possibly 1950s. This population was hunted to extirpation and its natural habitat converted for human use. Balinese names for the tiger are harimau Bali and samong.  Taxonomic history  In 1912, the German zoologist Ernst Schwarz described a skin and a skull of an adult female tiger in the Senckenberg Museum collection, that had originated in Bali. He named it Felis tigris balica and argued that it is distinct from the Javan tiger by its brighter fur colour and smaller skull with narrower zygomatic arches. In 1969, the distinctiveness of the Bali tiger was questioned, since morphological analysis of several tiger skulls from Bali revealed that size variation is similar to Javan tiger skulls. Hue and striping pattern of fur neither differs significantly. A comparison of mitochondrial DNA sequences from 23 museum specimens of Bali and Javan tigers with other living tiger subspecies revealed a close genetic resemblance of the tigers in the Sunda Islands. They form a monophyletic group distinct and equidistant from tigers in mainland Asia. In 2017, the Cat Classification Task Force of the Cat Specialist Group revised felid taxonomy, and now recognizes the extinct Bali and Javan tiger populations, as well as the Sumatran tiger population as P. t. sondaica.  Characteristics  The Bali tiger was described as the smallest tiger in the Sunda islands. In the 20th century, only seven skins and skulls of tigers from Bali were known to be preserved in museum collections. The common feature of these skulls is the narrow occipital plane, which is analogous with the shape of tiger skulls from Java. Skins of males measured between the pegs are long from head to end of tail; those of females . The weight of males ranged from , and of females from . Habitat and ecology Most of the known Bali tiger zoological specimens originated in western Bali, where mangrove forests, dunes and savannah vegetation existed. The main prey of the Bali tiger was likely Javan rusa.  Extirpation  At the end of the 19th century, palm plantations and irrigated rice fields were established foremost on Bali‚Äòs rich volcanic northern slopes and the alluvial strip around the island. Tiger hunting started after the Dutch gained control over Bali. During the Dutch colonial period, hunting trips were conducted by European sportsmen coming from Java, who had a romantic but disastrous Victorian hunting mentality and were equipped with high-powered rifles. The preferred method of hunting tigers was to catch them with a large, heavy steel foot trap hidden under bait, a goat or a muntjac, and then shoot them at close range. Surabayan gunmaker E. Munaut is confirmed to have killed over 20 tigers in only a few years.Vojnich, G. (1913). A Kelet-Indiai Szigetcsoporton [in the East Indian Archipelago]. Budapest: Singer √©s Wolfner. In 1941, the first game reserve, today's West Bali National Park, was established in western Bali, but too late to save Bali‚Äòs tiger population from extinction. It was probably eliminated by the end of World War II. A few tigers may have survived until the 1950s, but no specimen reached museum collections after the war. A few tiger skulls, skins and bones are preserved in museums. The British Museum in London has the largest collection, with two skins and three skulls; others include the Senckenberg Museum in Frankfurt, the Naturkunde Museum in Stuttgart, the Naturalis museum in Leiden and the Zoological Museum of Bogor, Indonesia, which owns the remnants of the last known Bali tiger. In 1997, a skull emerged in the old collection of the Hungarian Natural History Museum and was scientifically studied and properly documented.Buzas, B. and Farkas, B. (1997). An additional skull of the Bali tiger, Panthera tigris balica (Schwarz) in the Hungarian Natural History Museum. Miscellanea Zoologica Hungarica Volume 11: 101‚Äì105.  Cultural significance  The tiger had a well-defined position in Balinese folkloric beliefs and magic. It is mentioned in folk tales and depicted in traditional arts, as in the Kamasan paintings of the Klungkung kingdom. The Balinese considered the ground powder of tiger whiskers to be a potent and undetectable poison for one's foe. A Balinese baby was given a protective amulet necklace with black coral and \\"a tiger's tooth or a piece of tiger bone\\". The traditional Balinese Barong dance preserves a figure with the mask of a tiger called Barong Macan. Balinese people are fond of wearing tiger parts as jewelry for status or spiritual reasons, such as power and protection. Necklaces of teeth and claws or male rings cabochoned with polished tiger tooth ivory still exist in everyday use. Since the tiger has disappeared on both Bali and neighboring Java, old parts have been recycled, or leopard and sun bear body parts have been used instead.

He was created by Richard Starkings. Overview The character of Hip Flask first appeared in a number of advertisements for Comicraft comic book fonts in the late 1990s in which he was originally depicted as a private detective (this has since changed in the pages of his own comics). The character was created by Starkings when he failed to receive authorization from Marvel or DC Comics to use their characters in his Comicraft ads. He later graduated to his own series of one-shots by writers Richard Starkings, Joe Casey and artist Ladr√∂nn. His strip adventures have placed him firmly in the science fiction genre, in a dystopian future (2262). Much of the imagery of Hip Flask's world is reminiscent of the movie Blade Runner, especially as both are set in Los Angeles. The comics have been published once every one or two years, with three issues available as of July 2006. A monthly series called Elephantmen was first available for sale in stores in July 2006,shipping list for 2006 July 19, Diamond Comic Distributors, 2006. published by Image Comics. Set in the same universe, it focuses mainly on other human/animal hybrids, and fleshing out the continuity of the main series, though Hip features as well. In 2001, the character's similarities with an Australian comic book character called Hairbutt (a bumbling anthropomorphic hippopotamus private detective) led Hairbutt co- creator Bodine Amerikah and Darren Close of OzComics to accuse Hip Flask creator Richard Starkings of plagiarism. Starkings replied that he created Hip Flash without any knowledge of Hairbutt, and that their similarities were a bizarre coincidence.Brice, Jason. \\"Sentinels, Not Senators\\" . Comics Bulletin. accessed October 17, 2011.  Fictional character biography  Some two hundred years from now, the MAPPO Corporation, headed by the misanthropic and megalomaniacal Japanese scientist, Dr. Kazushi Nikken, breeds human/animal hybrids in a secure, top secret facility somewhere in North Africa. The Hybrids are composed of numerous African animal species including Warthogs, Elephants, Camels, Zebras, Rhinos, Hippos, Giraffes, Hyenas, and Crocodiles. The process involves implanting embryos into the wombs of kidnapped local women who are disposed of after giving birth. Each child is branded after birth marking them as the property of MAPPO. Hip Flask's scar is distorted so that \\"Hippopotomas Hybrid Flask #7A\\" instead reads just \\"Hip Flask #7A\\", hence his name. These Elephantmen are trained from birth to be soldiers and killers, they are indoctrinated in an Orwellian mindset to think of themselves as property of the MAPPO Corporation and to deny any concept of free thought. Hip Flask was possibly the only Elephantman who dared to ask questions during his childhood education, an act for which he was placed in solitary confinement. The U.N. upon discovering these experiments sends in an army to storm MAPPO's secret base. While their mission has not been elaborated at this stage it seems to be a combination of liberating the Elephantmen, investigating the attacks on the local populace and ending the development of MAPPO's illegal army. MAPPO turns the Elephantmen on the U.N. troops, and horrendous casualties are inflicted on both sides. Ultimately the U.N. succeed in subduing the Elephantmen and the MAPPO Personnel are arrested. The Elephantmen are rehabilitated and released to establish their own lives in the outside world where they are generally welcomed with distrust and horror from humans. Many of the Elephantmen were assigned jobs by the government. The intervening years of Hip Flask's life have not yet been revealed but many years later he appears as an advisor for the Information Agency, a government body tasked with monitoring data and information as an aid to law enforcement. He is partnered by a beautiful young woman named Vanity Case who seems to have romantic feelings towards him (much to Hip's embarrassment). Despite his traumatic childhood Hip Flask is shown to be a calm, kind and friendly individual, unlike many of the other Elephantmen who display a great deal of bitterness.  Other Elephantmen  So far the series has also introduced a number of other Elephantmen including Casbah Joe, a Camel hybrid (resembling Joe Camel) who runs a floating restaurant/nightclub called the Eye of the Needle, Jeremiah Granger, a Giraffe hybrid and proprietor of the tailor's All Creatures Great and Tall and Ebony, a true Elephant/Man and a colleague of Hip's. The most famous Elephantman in this world is Obadiah Horn (a rhino hybrid) who has risen in prominence as a businessman, though this may hide more underhanded dealings. He is married to a human named Sahara, daughter of a prominent business rival of Horn's named Serengheti. She is a former member of the U.N. team that rescued the Elephantmen from MAPPO.

It is the largest music academy in Norway and offers the country's highest level of music education. As a university college, it offers both undergraduate and postgraduate courses. Throughout the years the Academy has educated many of Norway's most renowned musicians. The Norwegian Academy of Music educates performers, composers and pedagogues, and attempts to lay the foundation for research within various fields of music. It educates musicians within folk music genres, church music, classical music and, quite notably in later years, a string of successful performers within the jazz realm. The Academy is also Oslo's biggest concert organizer, presenting approximately 300 concerts a year. As is the case with all schools in the Norwegian educational system, the school is free of charge. Students can only be accepted by auditioning and/or other verifiable qualifications.  History  The Norwegian Academy of Music was established in 1973. The current Academy is a result of a merger with the former √òstlandets musikkonservatorium in 1996, which was a successor to the music school at Veitvet founded by Olav Selvaag. The request for a governmental institution for music education goes back to the 19th century. In 1883 Ludvig Mathias Lindeman (father) and Peter Brynie Lindeman (son) started the so- called \\"School for Organists\\" in Kristiania (former name for Oslo). It developed to become the first and biggest conservatory of music in Norway, and made an important foundation for the Norwegian Academy of Music. The Lindeman conservatory was discontinued in 1973. To honour the memory of the Lindeman family, the biggest concert hall at the Academy is named the Lindeman Hall, which has a capacity of more than 400 people.

The name Setmurthy Common is sometimes used (including by Alfred Wainwright in his book The Outlying Fells of Lakeland) to refer to the area including the highest point, with \\"Watch Hill\\" describing the area to the west of the summit. It should not be confused with another Watch Hill some 19 km to the south-west, near Whitehaven, which is only 172 m (564 ft) high. The name \\"The Hay\\" is also used when referring to the area west of the summit. Despite its low height (just 833 feet) it is a Marilyn (a hill with topographic prominence of at least 150m) because of the large height separation from its neighbours. This 'detachedness' means that it is an excellent viewpoint. Skiddaw, Blencathra, the Lord's Seat group and Grisedale Pike are all seen, and there is a first-class view of the Cockermouth area and the Solway Coast AONB. The hill is a popular climb with Cockermouth folk, along with its lower neighbour Slate Fell. Wainwright recommends an ascent from the west and a return on the same route. He comments that \\"It is easily attained with a minimum of effort: a stroll on grass so simple that boots are incongruous footwear for it and bare feet appropriate\\".

The university offers 35 undergraduate majors and includes a school of nursing and graduate schools in education, criminal justice, and management.(https://www.mhu.edu/academics/graduate-degrees/) From 1859 to 2013 the school was called Mars Hill College; in August 2013 it officially changed its name to Mars Hill University.  History  College Street, on the University campus Mars Hill University was founded in 1856, and it is the oldest college or university in western North Carolina.https://www.mhu.edu/about/ It started as the French Broad Baptist Institute, sharing a name with the nearby French Broad River. In 1859, the university changed its name to Mars Hill, in honor of the hill in ancient Athens on which the Apostle Paul debated Christianity with the city's leading philosophers. During the American Civil War the university was closed for two years, but it reopened after the war. From 1897 to 1938 the university, under the leadership of Dr. Robert Moore, enjoyed substantial financial and physical growth. In 1921 Mars Hill became an accredited junior college. Dr. Hoyt Blackwell served as president from 1938 to 1966, and under his leadership Mars Hill became an accredited four-year college in 1962. From 1966‚Äì1996 Dr. Fred Bentley served as the college's president. Dr. Bentley was, at the time of his appointment in 1966, one of the youngest college presidents in the United States. Dr. Dan Lunsford, a 1969 graduate of MHU, served as university president from 2002 to 2018. Under Dr. Lunsford, Mars Hill University constructed three new dormitories, a new health sciences building to house its nursing program, a new classroom building to house the business department (the most popular major on campus), completely renovated and greatly expanded the math and sciences classroom building, upgraded its athletic facilities, tripled its endowment, increased its student enrollment, and started a graduate school in education.https://www.mhu.edu/wp- content/uploads/2017/08/academic-catalog-mhu-2013-14.pdf In June 2018, John Anthony \\"Tony\\" Floyd became the university's sixth president in 121 years. Mars Hill is accredited by the Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools to award bachelor's and master's degrees, and is an affiliate of the National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities, Council of Independent Colleges, the Appalachian College Association, and other similar organizations.

Description  Hip flasks were traditionally made of pewter, silver, or even glass, though most modern flasks are made from stainless steel. Some modern flasks are made of plastic so as to avoid detection by metal detectors. Hip flasks can vary in shape, although they are usually contoured to match the curve of the wearer's hip or thigh for comfort and discretion in a design also known as a kidney flask. Some flasks have a \\"captive top\\", which is a small arm that attaches the top to the flask in order to stop it from getting lost when it is taken off. A hip flask is most commonly purchased empty and then filled by the owner. However, the term \\"flask\\" also applies to smallest bottle sizes of alcohol in commercial markets. Some flasks come with small cups to make sharing easier, although generally liquid is consumed directly from the flask.  History  garter in 1926, during Prohibition in the United States. Similar to the wrist watch, the hip flask began to appear in the form it is recognized today in the 18th century, initially used by members of the gentry. However, less compact versions had been in production for several centuries. Notably, in the Middle Ages, there are several accounts of gutted fruit being used to store liquor. During the 18th century, women boarding docked British warships would smuggle gin into the ship via makeshift flasks, created from pig's bladders and hidden inside their petticoats. Following the act of prohibition in 1920s America, the state of Indiana banned the sale of cocktail shakers and hip flasks. Antique hip flasks, particularly those made of silver, are now sought-after collector's items. In the Royal Air Force, ‚Äúhip-flask‚Äù was used as code for a revolver.  Legality  Carrying a hip flask filled with alcohol in a public place is illegal in many locations in the United States due to open container laws. These laws prohibit possession of an unsealed container of alcohol in public or within the passenger compartment of a vehicle.  In popular culture  The hip flask appears frequently in comedy, in part because it allows drinking in inappropriate situations where a bottle would not normally be found‚Äîfor instance, in Two and a Half Men, where Charlie Harper (Charlie Sheen) drinks alcohol from a hip flask during a funeral. It also appears rarely in The Simpsons, when Homer drinks from it on occasion, and even allows Bart to take a drink during particularly intolerable occasions. In Family Guy, the character Brian Griffin also carries around a hip flask in the earlier seasons. In another adult animation, Rick and Morty, the character Rick Sanchez, who is shown to be notably alcoholic, carries a hip flask under his lab coat. In the TV series Lucifer, a flask is usually carried around by the title character Lucifer Morningstar.

He was described by The New York Times as \\"a central figure in the postwar American crafts movement\\".Sam Maloof NY Times, May 27, 2009 Early life and education Maloof was born Samuel Solomon Maloof, a member of the large Maalouf family, in Chino, California, to Lebanese immigrants.Sam Maloof - Taunton Press Maloof's father, Slimen Nasif Nadir Maloof, and mother, Anisse, had immigrated to the U.S. in 1905 from Lebanon, which was at that time a region of the Ottoman Empire. Maloof learned to speak Spanish from a Mexican-born housekeeper and Arabic from his parents even before he learned English. He was engaged in woodworking even as a child, made a broad spatula for his mother for turning bread, carved dollhouse furniture, cars and other toys. He attended high school first at Chaffey High School in Ontario, California, where he took his first woodworking class and was recognized by his art teacher as having extraordinary skill. Later he attended Chino High School. Career Shortly after completing high school, Maloof began working in the art department of the Vortox Manufacturing Company in Claremont, California. He was drafted into the United States Army on October 11, 1941.Adamson, J., \\"The Furniture of Sam Maloof\\", Smithsonian American Art Museum, W. W. Norton & Company, 2001 Maloof was soon promoted from private to master sergeant while doing display work in Alaska. He was one of 35,000 WW II troops sent to protect Alaska from the Japanese, an engagement the Allies expected to be a \\"bloodbath.\\" In actuality, the Japanese forces had left Kiska before the Allies arrived. Maloof was one of the few soldiers who had a camera, and while not trained as a photographer, Maloof took 1,800 photographs which were \\"alive and clear and informative.\\"War stories: A close-up look at the Aleutian front in WWII Alaska Dispatch News, Jan. 8, 2011 After completing his service, Maloof left the army in 1945 to return to Southern California. Maloof married Alfreda Ward on June 27, 1948 and the couple moved into a house at 921 Plaza Serena, Ontario, California, where Sam set up a furniture workshop in the garage. Mostly from necessity, Maloof designed and built a suite of furniture for his home using salvaged materials. Commissioned pieces followed and, from 1949 to 1952, Maloof continued working in the garage of his Ontario home. In 1953, Maloof relocated to Alta Loma, California. Over time, he added 16 rooms, including a furniture- making shop and studio, to the original 6-room house. In 2000, when the path of the new CA-210 freeway extension included the Maloof property, the home was moved about 3 miles to its current location at 5131 Carnelian Street (at the northeast corner of the intersection with Hidden Farm Road; ). The Sam and Alfreda Maloof Compound serves as the office of the Sam and Alfreda Maloof Foundation for Arts and Crafts which offers tours of the Historic Home on Thursdays and Saturdays.Grimes, William. \\"Sam Maloof, Furniture Craftsman, Dies at 93,\\" New York Times.

In 1985 he was awarded a MacArthur \\"Genius\\" grant. Presidents Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan have both owned Maloof rockers.Harrington, Walt. - \\"An American Craftsman\\" - This Old House Magazine - March/April 1998 He is featured in the 2007 PBS series \\"Craft in America: Memory, Landscape, Community\\", produced by Carol Sauvion. Maloof's chairs, for which he is perhaps most famous, have a sculptural quality about them, yet are also very ergonomic, and austere in their simplicity. They can be characterized by completely rounded over corners at mortise and tenon joints (which are always plainly visible); carved ridges and spines, particularly on the arm rests; decorative Ebony dowels; deep, dished-out seats (always made from several boards glued together); and clear finishes. Maloof tended to favor only a handful of woods: Claro Walnut, Cherry, Oak, Rosewood and Yew. On larger pieces, he often used Poplar in areas that would not be visible during ordinary use. He was described by the Smithsonian Institution as \\"America's most renowned contemporary furniture craftsman\\" and People magazine dubbed him \\"The Hemingway of Hardwood.\\" But his business card always said \\"woodworker.\\" \\"I like the word,\\" he told a Los Angeles Times reporter, his eyes brightening behind large, owl-eyed glass frames. \\"It's an honest word.\\"Janet Eastman, Los Angeles Times, A1, May 23, 2009 L.A.

It stands on the end of the long ridge coming down from High Raise over Silver How towards Ambleside, and is separated from its neighbours by the depression of Red Bank. Topography The fell is surrounded by an unusual amount of open water. To the north the River Rothay flows through Grasmere and Rydal Water before bending around the eastern side of Loughrigg. On the southern flank the River Brathay runs from Elter Water and is also fed by the outfall from Loughrigg Tarn. The two rivers merge at Clappersgate on the south eastern corner of the fell, just before flowing into Windermere. The western boundary is formed by Red Bank (535 ft) on the ridge to Silver How. Unnamed becks fall north and south into Grasmere and Elter Water. Loughrigg has two subsidiary ridges on its eastern flank. Lanty Scar provides the obvious line of ascent from Rydal, while the spur rising over Todd Crag leads up from Clappersgate. There are many areas of woodland on the lower slopes, giving way to a wide expanse of bracken-clad knolls and small tarns on the top. The summit is on the western side of the plateau and is identified by an Ordnance Survey column. Many lower tops also decorate the fell, sometimes to the confusion of visitors. Despite the girdle of lakes only Windermere is visible from the summit. The vista is open to the south over the green and blue country of Furness, with many fells in view on the other three sides. The fell is easily accessible, being surrounded by roads on all sides. Ambleside and the smaller settlements of Skelwith Bridge, Elterwater, Grasmere and Rydal are all within reach, as is the popular double car park at White Moss Common. Many paths run over the fell including the well known Loughrigg Terrace, a level path with superb views of Grasmere, Helm Crag and the Fairfield group. Just beyond the eastern end of the Terrace are some quite remarkable caves, caused by quarrying. They penetrate about into the hillside and are often full of water; there are other small mines on the fell. Geology The geology is complex with the dacitic welded lapilli-tuff and volcaniclastic sandstone of the Lincomb Tarns Formation outcropping on the south-eastern slopes. Nearer the summit are intrusions rhyolite and sills of basaltic andesite. Drift deposits overlie the north-western flanks.British Geological Survey: 1:50,000 series, sheet 38: BGS (1998) Summit The highest rocky knoll can be identified by an Ordnance Survey triangulation column beside a large cairn, both standing out from the turf. The view includes intimate views of the Langdale Pikes and the fells around Grasmere, together with the Fairfield horseshoe and the Coniston Fells. Elter Water, Grasmere and a large part of Windermere can also be seen.Mark Richards: The Central Fells: Collins (2003): Panorama of the summit of Loughrigg Fell Ascents An easy way up Loughrigg is from the White Moss car park, on the A591 between Grasmere and Rydal Water. This simple walk entails only around of ascent over . From the car park a trail leads through woods onto Loughrigg Terrace. From the end of the terrace a path leads up left steeply over steps to the wide, undulating top area. Ascents are also possible from any of the surrounding settlements with manifold variations. Loughrigg Fell is on the route of the Windermere Way, a long distance footpath that circumambulates Windermere. The summit is the middle one of three visible knolls.

She was named for Isaac Hull. History Hull was launched by Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation, San Francisco, California, 18 February 1921; sponsored by Miss Elizabeth Hull; and commissioned 26 April 1921, Lieutenant T. J. Doyle in command. Following shakedown along the California coast, Hull engaged in operations and tactical exercises out of San Diego, California for the remainder of the year. During 1922, she took part in charting and sounding operations along the coast of southern California. Upon completion of winter maneuvers off Panama and training exercises out of San Diego, Hull sailed 28 June 1923 to act as escort vessel on President Warren G. Harding's trip to Alaska. It was on this voyage that the President was taken ill, and he died in San Francisco 2 August. The destroyer returned to San Diego 8 September and resumed operations and exercises in that area. Hull sailed 2 January 1924, for operations in the Caribbean, which included a visit to Veracruz, Mexico, to protect American lives and property. In April the ship steamed to Seattle, Washington, and operated between that city and Seward, Alaska, taking soundings for the new Alaskan cable. Upon her return in early May Hull resumed operations along the coast. The destroyer continued to operate out of San Diego with occasional voyages to Panama until 1927. She then sailed in company with the Battle Fleet 17 November for tactical maneuvers in the Caribbean. Hull visited New York before returning to San Diego 26 June to resume her training operations. Fate The ship arrived at Mare Island 11 June 1929 for overhaul, and returned to San Diego in October, where she decommissioned 31 March 1930. Hull was sold for scrap 10 June 1931, in accordance with the London Treaty of 1930. The bell, however, was saved and made its way to Marquette University in Milwaukee, WI where it was rung by the band to start football games. Since Marquette no longer has a football team, the bell was decommissioned and now is in storage.

Originally named Normanton the town was renamed Port Elgin when it was incorporated in 1874, after James Bruce, 8th Earl of Elgin, a former Governor General of the Province of Canada. Although road signs indicate the name Port Elgin, it is no longer an entity, per se. In 1998, the Town of Southampton, the Town of Port Elgin and Saugeen Township were amalgamated to form the Town of Port Elgin- Saugeen-Southampton. On December 17, 1998, the Province renamed the new municipality as the Town of Saugeen Shores. Unlike \\"beach towns\\" such as Sauble Beach, this is a four seasons community where most businesses are open all year and activities for locals are available most months. The primary employment categories are agriculture, small business, tourism and work at the Bruce Power nuclear power station. Close to MacGregor Point Provincial Park and Southampton, the community has several beaches on Lake Huron. Although the seasonal population is significantly higher due to the many cottages and campgrounds in the area, the permanent population was 6,880 in 2016 in the town's land area of 5.36 square kilometres according to the most recent Census. History The area that is now Port Elgin was first settled in 1849, by Lachlan McLean (\\"Loch Buie\\") who first built a shanty and later ran a tavern, serving settlers and sailors passing through the little port. In spring 1852 George Butchart built a dam and saw-mill on Mill Creek. According to a Government of Ontario historic plaque, Butchart sold the mill to Benjamin Shantz who subsequently built a grist-mill and within three years a community of 250 people had developed around these mills. Stores, hotels and tanneries were constructed and in March, 1857, a village plot named Port Elgin was laid out. The enterprise of its businessmen, notably Henry Hilker, Samuel Bricker and John Stafford, contributed to the development of the settlement, which had a population of over 600 by 1867. The arrival of the Wellington, Grey and Bruce Railway in 1872 further stimulated the growth of the community and it was incorporated as a Village in 1874 with a population of about 950. Early industries included a steam sawmill, foundry, and woolen mill. By 1869 the population was 650 and there was connection by steamship to Southampton and to Goderich.https://books.google.ca/books?id=z6wOAAAAYAAJ, page 392 The first shipping pier was built in 1857. In 1873, the railway arrived, allowing Southampton and Port Elgin products to travel far from Lake Huron. Agriculture prospered and the shipping industry benefitted from the natural harbour. Timber, coal, general merchandise and passengers arrived by ship. Warehouses for storing grain were constructed, and a tannery opened for business, becoming the second largest in Ontario. By the 1880s, tourism was becoming a factor in the economy; passenger boats, largely from the U.S., began visiting this area. In the 1900s, industry in the area declined in the 1900s and the harbour began getting fewer ships as the other modes of transportation improved. View of the north end of the business district of Port Elgin in 1933 Tourism became more important in the early 1900s. Development began to be directed in that direction; for example, the harbour was modified for pleasurecraft, the town was beautified and an increasing number of cottages were built. The library was built in 1908 with assistance from the Carnegie Fund, a secondary school was completed in 1889, with additions made in 1939. The school was replaced with a more modern structure in 1975. The Government of Ontario also erected another historic plaque in Port Elgin, titled The \\"Nodwell\\" Indian Village Site. \\"This important Iroquoian village site was discovered about 1900, and named after the family which then owned the property. Subsequent archaeological examinations have uncovered a mid-14th century village, consisting of twelve longhouses, from 42 to 139 feet in length, protected by a double palisade. It was probably occupied for about 10 to 20 years by a group of some 500 people who were predecessors of the Huron and Petun Indians. Although primarily farmers who grew corn, tobacco and probably pumpkins and sunflowers, they also engaged in considerable fishing and hunting. A large number of artifacts have been retrieved from this site including fragments of pottery cooking vessels, smoking pipes, arrow heads, adzes, awls and netting needles.\\" = Historical timeline, 1849 to 1906 = Although specific dates vary depending on the source, the following are excerpted from a reliable source, History of the County of Bruce, Ontario, Canada, by Norman Robertson, published in 1906. * 1849: The first settler in the bush is Lachlan (\\"Loch Buie\\") McLean. * 1852: George Butchart, an early Bruce pioneer, erects a dam and sawmill on Mill Creek. * 1854: The first commercial store and post office are opened in the community called Normanton; other buildings include three houses, a tavern and an unfinished log house. * 1855: A grist mill is completed. By now, the community consists of five houses and two taverns. * 1856: A steam sawmill is erected by Samuel Bricker. * 1857-58: A commercial pier is built by private enterprise for landing passengers and goods. (Previously, a large scow rowed out to steam ships in order to transport visitors and goods.) The piers of the harbor would continue expanding until at least 1899. * 1859-60: A small foundry and brick works are opened. A woollen mill is already operating. * 1866: The population is about 630. There are five churches, two schools, a large Town Hall, four stores, three hotels, a job printing office, a brewery, two tanneries, a woollen factory, a foundry, two sawmills, a grist mill, a pottery, many retailers of handicrafts and one physician. * Circa 1869: Electric telegraph reaches the community. * 1873: The village is incorporated on June 7, to be effective in 1874, with a population of 941. The name is changed from Normanton to Port Elgin. The railway has arrived and is helping to increase trade with other areas. * 1889: The first high school opens. * 1905: A large sawmill opens; work begins on a spur line from the railway station to the mill. * 1906: Port Elgin is becoming more popular as a summer resort. \\"The splendid beach, the bracing breezes that blow from off Lake Huron, and the mineral spring and baths are attracting each season an increased number of visitors.\\" Economy While tourism is the primary industry, the community has many year round residents, some living on the tree lined streets that run from downtown to the beach area In addition to serving the many farmers in the area, the original economic development of Port Elgin during the 19th century was based on its harbour facilities on Lake Huron constructed in 1857‚Äì1858. This made the village a distribution centre for the surrounding agricultural region. The increasing urbanization of Ontario and the increased importance of the road network for transporting goods resulted in a declining economy and population. More recently, tourism and the nearby Bruce Nuclear Generating Station, which is a major employer of the workforce living in Saugeen Shores, have dominated the local economy. The nuclear station in nearby Tiverton, Ontario started a $13 billion refurbishment program in 2016 which will provide employment for many residents and maintain demand for other services. According to Bruce Power, this multi-year plan \\"will generate between 1,500 and 2,500 jobs on site annually ‚Äì and 18,000 across Ontario directly and indirectly ‚Äì while injecting up to $4 billion annually into Ontario‚Äôs economy\\".

(Young singles tend to prefer Sauble Beach some 18 kilometres north of Southampton.) Port Elgin is renowned for its beautiful sunsets. There is a common urban legend in Port Elgin that National Geographic selected the town as having the world's best sunsets. This has since been proven wrong. However, in 2007 CBC Television held a competition to discover the Seven Wonders of Canada. While not being in the top seven, Saugeen Shores and its sunsets were one the finalists.CBC.ca Cottage Life magazine also rates Port Elgin highly in its article 10 spectacular places to watch a sunset in Ontario. \\"With clear skies, a dry atmosphere, and an unobstructed view of the skyline, many of the west-facing towns along the shores of Lake Huron have the perfect conditions for a breathtaking sunset. Port Elgin, a Saugeen Shores community, has been earning rave reviews for years. For the best view, take a leisurely walk along the beach out to the harbour break wall.\\" pumpkin entered by Jane and Phil Hunt in the 2009 Port Elgin Pumpkinfest Every year, on the first weekend in October, Port Elgin hosts a Pumpkinfest. Pumpkinfest is a competition between farmers to grow the largest pumpkin and other common farm crops. In 2004, a new record for the world's largest pumpkin (656 kg) was set at the festival. A new record (761 kg) was again set in 2009. The record was broken in 2016 with an 851 kg (1,877 lb.) vegetable. The previous Canadian record for a pumpkin was 824.86 kg (1818.5 lbs.). Pumpkinfest also features a large classic car show on both days of the festival. Pumpkinfest offers many activities for children, such as a junior fire fighter obstacle course, the kiddie karnival, and amusement rides. The Port Elgin and North Shore Railroad is located in Port Elgin by the beach parking area; it runs in warm weather, giving rides to families along a 1.5 kilometre loop. During July and August, seven days a week, the S.S. Trolley shuttles passengers between downtown Port Elgin and Southampton along the roadway for a modest fee. This trolley provides convenient access to the attractions in nearby Southampton. The TripAdvisor travel web site recommends the nearby MacGregor Point Provincial Park, the Saugeen Rail Trail walking/cycling route, the Brucedale Conservation Area with small camp sites, and the several nearby golf courses. One of the many restaurants serving the numerous tourists during the warm months MacGregor Point Provincial Park is an all-season destination for camping, hiking, swimming, wildlife and bird watching. In winter, visitors can camp in yurts, cross-country ski, hike, or go skating. TripAdvisor users rated the following as the best restaurants in Port Elgin: The Wismer House, Lord Elgin Fish & Chips, Saffron, Andre's Swiss Country Dining, Allen's Fireside Grill and Ashanti Coffee Port Elgin. =Saugeen RailTrail= After the railways ceased to service the area, the tracks were removed and the beds were vacant and overgrown. According to the Rail Trail Association, a group of volunteers founded the group in 1990 and convinced Port Elgin, Southampton and Saugeen Township to acquire sections of the then unused rail bed. Over the years, the bed has been developed as trails for walking and cycling. The trail connects Southampton and Port Elgin. The trail also connects to the 80 kilometre long Bruce County Trail Network which leads to towns such as Paisley, Walkerton, Mildmay and Kincardine. The trailhead can be accessed at River Street in Port Elgin, a few blocks north of the town centre and east of Hwy 21. There are other access points in both towns, some with parking. The trail is not groomed for cross country skiing during the winter but is used frequently for that purpose. Maps of the trails are available on the web site of the Saugeen RailTrail Association.

Dabney, great-granddaughter of Commodore Thomas Macdonough; and commissioned 30 April 1921, Lieutenant Commander H. J. Ray in command. Based at San Diego, California throughout her naval service, Macdonough operated primarily along the west coast. Periodic maneuvers and cruises with the Battle Fleet off the Pacific coast of Central America, the Hawaiian Islands, and in the Caribbean, as well as special assignments, intervened in her normal operations schedule. Included in her special assignments was a good will cruise with the fleet to Samoa, Australia, and New Zealand, 20 June to 26 September 1925. On 22 March 1929, Macdonough returned to San Diego from fleet exercises held off Balboa, Panama Canal Zone, and operated off southern California until decommissioning at San Diego 8 January 1930.

It is the largest of the 10 species of chevrotains, basal even-toed ungulates which are similar to deer, but are barely larger than small dogs. Description Skull of a water chevrotain Unusually for most mammals, female water chevrotains are larger than males. On average, they weigh over 2 kg more than the 10-kg males. Their body length is about 85 cm, and their shoulder height is around 35 cm. Water chevrotains have a rich, sleek, red-brown coat on top, and the underside of the coat is white. On the body is a pattern of white stripes that runs horizontally from the shoulder to the tail, with vertical rows of white stripes in the back. The chin, throat, and chest are covered in very coarse hair with a pattern of white V shapes. The back end of the water chevrotain has many powerful muscles and is higher than the shoulders, which makes the body slope down toward the front. The head is held down toward the ground while walking, which allows the water chevrotain to navigate easily through thickets of dense brush. A layer of thick, reinforced skin is on the dorsal surface, which protects the back from injuries caused by the thick brush. The legs look short and thin compared to the bulky body, and the hooves are similar to a pig's. The tail is short with a fluffy white underside that resembles a cotton ball. Distribution and habitat The water chevrotain is endemic to the tropical regions of Africa. While it primarily lives in the coastal regions, the species can be found from Sierra Leone to western Uganda. They can be found in closed-canopy, moist, tropical lowland forest, and within this habitat, they only occupy areas within close range to streams or rivers. The area is rarely inhabited by the species if it is further than 250 m away from water. During the day, chevrotains cannot be found outside of the dense forest, but at night, they can be observed in exposed clearings and open river banks. Behavior The water chevrotain is exclusively nocturnal, and forages for food in clearings at night. Fallen fruits, such as figs, palm nuts, and breadfruit make up the majority of the water chevrotain's diet, although it has also been known to feed on insects, crabs, and scavenged meat and fish, and is the only species of chevrotain known to do so. It relies on its sense of smell to locate food.Kingdon, J. (1997) The Kingdon Field Guide to African Mammals. Academic Press Limited, London. During the day, the water chevrotain hides in the dense cover of the African brush. The resting postures of the species include lying down and sitting up. Because they are such a solitary species, the interactions between water chevrotains are only antagonistic and reproductive encounters. Males fight other males, mainly over territory. Their fights are typically short, and in them the two competing males run at each other, mouths open. They poke each other with their muzzles and bite. These aggressive fights are thought to be the reason that mature males normally live no closer than several kilometers apart. The water chevrotain makes several different noises, which include a scream when injured/wounded and an alarm bark. When females fight, they make a high-pitched chattering noise, and when pursuing a female, a male makes a noise through a closed mouth. Conservation status The total population of the water chevrotain species estimated to be around 278,000. The ICUN Red List has given the status least concern to the water chevrotain. Because of its solitary nature, very little about its population in each individual country is known, but recent evidence shows the population is declining in some areas.

As self-defense Self-deprecation was recommended by philosophers of Stoicism as a response to insults. Instead of getting defensive, we should join in by insulting ourselves even more. According to the Stoics, this will remove the sting from the insult. It will also disappoint our interlocutor because we failed to show upset in response to words that were supposed to hurt us, thereby reducing the chance that they will try to upset us like that again.William Irvine, 2013, 'A Slap in the Face' As an element of politeness In traditional British-English culture, self-deprecation is considered to be an element of modesty. Modesty is considered a virtue, often contrasted to the North American demonstration of self-confidence, often taken for boasting.Sara Mills, English Politeness and Class, Cambridge University Press, 2017, , Section 3.3.4: \\"Self-deprecation\\" This is characteristic such as in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia and New Zealand, where \\"blowing one's own trumpet\\" is frowned upon.

In Hay's first game in charge, New Zealand lost 1‚Äì3 playing a friendly against the Republic of Ireland. Controversy Hay, then a teacher and coach at Sacred Heart College, Auckland, courted controversy in June 2012 by criticising New Zealand coach Ricki Herbert's tactics following a defeat in the 2012 OFC Nations Cup to the Solomon Islands. Hay was quoted as saying \\"It's a little bit scary that you've got one person dictating all the ideas and there's nothing fresh coming through. He's got tactically lazy and to play three at the back in Honiara was horrific in those conditions, with the type of players we had available to us.\\" Also while coaching at Sacred Heart, Hay was banned for four games after a sideline outburst at match officials, calling the referee and the assistant referee \\"f***ing cheats\\". Hay later stated that he regretted his actions and apologised to his players and parents of young children, who might have heard his outburst. During his playing career, Hay had never been sent off for abusing a match official.

She was named for Oscar Farenholt. History Farenholt was laid down on 13 September 1920 by Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation, Union Iron Works, San Francisco, California. She was launched on 9 March 1921, sponsored by Mrs. Richard H. Fairweather, and commissioned on 10 May 1921 with Commander N. W. Post in command. Farenholt first arrived at San Diego, California, her home port, 28 May 1921, and joined the Pacific Fleet in its yearly schedule of exercises and maneuvers along the west coast from the Pacific Northwest to the Panama Canal Zone. Gunnery drills, proving torpedoes, acting as plane guard for seaplane-carrying battleships and cruisers, fleet problems, and practice war maneuvers with the Army kept Farenholt almost constantly at sea. In 1924 and 1927, Farenholt passed through the Panama Canal for fleet concentrations in the Caribbean, and during the second cruise, sailed north to visit Norfolk, Virginia, and Newport before returning to San Diego. Between May and August 1925, the destroyer sailed to the Hawaiian Islands for a fleet problem and joint exercises, then sailed on with the Battle Fleet to visit Pago Pago, Samoa, and ports in Australia and New Zealand, returning to the west coast by way of Honolulu. Again in 1928 she sailed to Pearl Harbor for large scale exercises in Hawaiian waters. During the summer of 1929, in her last year of service, Farenholt cruised along the west coast with Naval Reserve members embarked for training, visiting Victoria, British Columbia, as well as United States ports. Fate She was decommissioned 20 February 1930 and stricken from the Navy List on 12 July 1930. After partial scrapping, she was sold as a hulk on 10 June 1931 in accordance with the terms of the London Naval Treaty.

Biography He was born at Gie√üen, in Hesse-Darmstadt, Germany, to Christoph Follen (1759-1833) and Rosine Follen (1766-1799). His father was a counselor-at-law and judge. In 1814 he and his brother, Charles Follen, fought in the Napoleonic Wars as Hessian volunteers. Before joining the volunteers, he had studied theology and philology at the University of Giessen. On his return, he studied law at University of Heidelberg for two years, and after leaving the university in 1817 edited the Elberfeld Allgemeine Zeitung. Suspected of political agitation and connection with some radical plots, in 1819 he was imprisoned for two years in Berlin. When released in 1821, he went to Switzerland, where he later became a citizen of Zurich. He taught in the canton school at Aarau, farmed from 1847-1854 the estate of Liebenfels in Thurgau, and then retired to Bern, where he lived until his death. Works Besides a number of minor poems, he wrote Harfengr√ºsse aus Deutschland und der Schweiz (1823) and Malegys und Vivian (1829), a knightly romance after the fashion of the romantic school. Of his many translations, mention may be made of the Homeric Hymns in collaboration with R. Schwenck (1814), Tasso's Jerusalem Delivered (1818) and Siegfrieds Tod from the Nibelungenlied (1842); he also collected and translated Latin hymns and sacred poetry (1819). The Argument about Atheism in Zurich: (left to right) Arnold Ruge, A. L. Follen, Karl Heinzen, F. W. Schulz In 1846 he published a brief collection of sonnets entitled An die gottlosen Nichtsw√ºteriche (To the godless nothing maniacs). This was aimed at the liberal Hegelian philosophers Arnold Ruge and Karl Heinzen, and was the occasion of a literary duel between Follen and Ruge where Follen fronted for a belief in God and immortality. Follen's posthumous poem Tristans Eltern (1857), was notable, but his best-known work is a collection of German poetry entitled Bildersaal deutscher Dichtung (1827). Family He was the brother of Charles Follen and Paul Follen, who both emigrated to the United States. Biologist Carl Vogt was his nephew.

It was directed by Karyn Kusama, written by Phil Hay and Matt Manfredi, and produced by Gale Anne Hurd, David Gale, Gary Lucchesi and Greg Goodman. The film was produced by MTV Films, Lakeshore Entertainment, Babelsberg Film Studio and Valhalla Motion Pictures. It stars Charlize Theron as the title character, Marton Csokas, Jonny Lee Miller, Sophie Okonedo, Pete Postlethwaite, and Frances McDormand. The film was released on December 2, 2005 by Paramount Pictures in the United States. The film was poorly reviewed by critics and grossed $52.3 million on a production budget of $65 million. Plot In 2011, a deadly pathogenic virus has killed 99% of the Earth's population, forcing the survivors to regroup and scatter across the Earth. 404 years later, in late 2415, all of the survivors inhabit Bregna, a dystopianAeon Flux Review. empireonline.com (January 27, 2006). Retrieved on August 30, 2020. walled futuristic city-state, which is ruled by a congress of scientists. Although Bregna is largely an idyllic place in the destroyed Earth, people routinely disappear and the population has nightmares. A skilled warrior, named √Üon Flux, is a member of the Monicans, an underground rebel organization who communicate through telepathy-enabling technology and are led by the Handler. After a mission to destroy a surveillance station, √Üon comes home to find her sister Una has been mistaken for a Monican and killed. When √Üon is sent on a mission to kill the government's leader, Trevor Goodchild, she discovers that both she and the Monicans are being manipulated by council members in a secret coup d'√©tat. √Üon questions the origins of everyone in Bregna, and in particular, her personal connection to Trevor. Everyone in Bregna is revealed to be a clone, grown from recycled DNA. With the dead constantly being reborn as new individuals and bearing partial memories of their previous lives, their troubling dreams have increased. Cloning was required because the antidote to the virus made humans infertile. Trevor's ongoing experiments were attempts to reverse the infertility. His ancestors had also worked on this problem. √Üon learns that she is a clone of the original Trevor's wife Katherine, and is the first \\"Katherine\\" clone in over 400 years. One of Trevor's experiments, Una, was successful: she had become pregnant. However, in order to stay in power, Trevor's brother, Oren Goodchild, had her killed along with the other members of the experimental group. He ordered all of Trevor's research to be destroyed. In a confrontation with Trevor and √Üon, Oren reveals that nature has corrected the infertility problem and that some women are becoming pregnant. Oren has had them all killed to maintain the Goodchild reign. √Üon then goes against both Oren and her former allies who want to kill Trevor. She convinces the other Monicans to ignore the Handler and to help her kill Oren and his men. √Üon goes to destroy the Relical, the dirigible that stores the DNA for cloning. There she meets Keeper, the old man who monitors everything. She discovers that he preserved Katherine's DNA for years, although Oren had ordered it to be destroyed so \\"Katherine\\" could not influence Trevor in any way. The dirigible crashes into the city wall, breaking it down to reveal the surrounding land for the first time in centuries. It is lush and fertile, not a wasteland as they were taught.

It was based on the animated TV series by Peter Chung, who had a minor role in this film version of his work. In the early stages of production, actress Michelle Rodriguez was considered for the part of √Üon. She had previously worked with Kusama in Girlfight. Kusama had originally suggested filming in Bras√≠lia, the capital of Brazil, because the 20th-century modern architecture of that city fit with her vision of Bregna. The producers rejected the idea because Bras√≠lia lacked the infrastructure and technical expertise to support a major film production. After several cities were scouted, Berlin and Potsdam in Germany were chosen for filming. Berlin had several locations that fit into the organic yet structured world of √Üon Flux. The crew gained permission to film in several locations that had never allowed such access before, including the Treptow Crematorium, the Adlershof Trudelturm and Windkanal wind tunnel facility, and the Haus der Kulturen der Welt (\\"House of the World's Cultures\\"). Additional locations included the Bauhaus Archive and a dissection theatre built in 1790 to train veterinarians, part of the Berlin animal shelter. It was used as the Handler space.√Üon Flux DVD, The Locations of '√Üon Flux' featurette. Filming was temporarily suspended for a month during September 2004 while Theron recovered from a neck injury she sustained during stunt-work on the tenth day of shooting. She was hospitalized in Berlin for five days and required about six weeks of physiotherapy to recover. Director Karyn Kusama claims that after finishing the film, the studio took it away from her and heavily re-edited it, changing storylines and characters, claiming that her version was too much of an art film. Release =Box office= Paramount chose not to screen √Üon Flux for critics prior to its release. The film opened at number two at the U.S. box office, making $12,661,112 in its opening weekend, held off the top spot by Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. √Üon Flux suffered a decline of 63.97% in box office earnings, going down to number six the following week when The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe and King Kong were released during the holiday season. On February 9, 2006, it completed its theatrical run, grossing a domestic take of $25,874,337 and a worldwide box office total of $52,304,001, making it a write down and a box office bomb against its $62 million budget. =Critical reception= The film holds a 9% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 107 reviews; the average rating is 3.38/10. The consensus states, \\"Aeon Flux lacks the gravity- defying pace of its animated predecessor, and, despite some flash, is largely a dull affair.\\" With a score of 36 out of 100 based on 23 critics, the film's reception is rated \\"Generally unfavorable\\" on Metacritic. Variety said it was \\"savaged by terrible reviews\\". Theron said that she had doubts about the project but trusted Kusama, whom she respected. Theron said they \\"fucked it all up\\" because they did not know how to execute the concept. Although Peter Chung was initially optimistic about the film and was impressed with the sets,Gale Anne Hurd's DVD commentary at 1:06:49 he ultimately described it as \\"a travesty,\\" adding: Chung primarily objected to the film's portrayal of √Üon and Trevor, and their re-imagined history and relationship. He said, \\"Ms. Flux does not actually appear in the movie.\\" Screenwriters Hay and Manfredi asserted in an interview that the film was re-cut by the studio prior to release. They said the original director's cut contains nearly 30 minutes of additional footage, which Chung acknowledged in his criticism. Music Graeme Revell composed the score for √Üon Flux; the soundtrack is available via Var√®se Sarabande as advertised on the film's official website. Comic book prequel In late 2005, Dark Horse Comics published a four-issue comic book limited series tying in with the movie. The storyline serves as a prequel to the film and is a mixture of Chung's original TV series designs and characters, combined with the setting and story elements of the film; the comic book version of √Üon loosely resembles Theron, while her colleague Sithandra, played by a black actress in the film, is depicted as white in the comic book. The first issue sets up Flux's mission for the miniseries: sabotage the Bregnan government's plan to destroy the forest outside of Bregna's walls. The last two issues of the limited series were published after the film had been released. By the time the final issue was published, the film had already ended its run in most areas. Dark Horse has not announced if additional √Üon Flux-based comics will be published. Video game On November 15, 2005, a video game tie-in prequel of the same name was released in North America for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox gaming consoles. The game takes place in eras before the film's setting of 2030 to 2338. The likenesses and voices of actors from the film were used. To help add to the box office gross of the film and to sell more games, specially marked copies sold in the US came with a pass to see the √Üon Flux film.√Üon Flux game manual Home media √Üon Flux was released on DVD on April 25, 2006. As of July 16, 2006, the DVD has grossed $31.80 million in rental sales.

The programs mixed locally produced news with nationally produced news and an opinion segment from Sinclair's Hunt Valley, Maryland studios, along with weather segments customized for each market also originating from Hunt Valley. News Central was broadcast between October 2002 and March 2006. History News Central was launched on October 28, 2002 with WSMH's News At Ten. The format was original announced to be rolled out to Sinclair stations currently not offering news. But after a successful beta run at WSMH, Sinclair announced that three stations with newscasts would be next in converting to the format during the first quarter of 2003. By April 2003, News Central was planning to launch its own Washington bureau. By December 2003, 12 Sinclair stations were using the News Central format. News Central ended all newscasts effective March 31, 2006; after that date, its stations either returned to a more traditional in-house newscast format, outsourced their newscast to a larger station in the market, or cancelled their newscasts entirely. Others, like WSMH, teamed up with non-affiliate stations in their market to either simulcast other stations' newscasts or jointly produce a news program. WYZZ and WUHF went into LMAs with other stations in their markets. Content The local station news operation provided the first ten minutes of news. Then national News Central operation produced 12 minutes of international and national news of the total newscast, along with customized local weather forecasts produced from the national operation, and with other content such as stories prepared by the publicity departments of that station's network as a video news release (for instance, WVTV would carry a feature on Gilmore Girls or One Tree Hill produced by The WB as a tie-in to that evening's episodes). The national operation also provided nightly The Point commentary by Mark E. Hyman, Sinclair's Vice President of Corporate Relations.

Prospero Fontana (1512‚Äì1597) was a Bolognese painter of late Renaissance and Mannerist art. He is perhaps best known for his frescoes and architectural detailing. The speed in which he completed paintings earned him commissions where he worked with other prominent artists of the period. He was a prominent figure in the city of Bologna, whose roles included art instructor and consultant on the reformation of religious art. Professional life Prospero Fontana was likely taught by Innocenzo da Imola, but there is a degree of uncertainty surrounding the relationship between the two men. As a teenager, Fontana was an assistant on Perino del Vaga's Palazzo Doria in Genoa. However, art historians cannot definitively identity Fontana's contributions to the decorations. In the 1550s, Fontana painted Pope Julius III's portrait and was pensioned at the pontifical court. He also decorated the Palazzo di Firenze for the Pope's brother, Balduino del Monte. During his time in Rome, he collaborated with Taddeo Zuccaro on the Villa Giulia in Rome (1553). J. A. Gere suggests that Fontana supervised the project and was responsible for the paintings in the North Room. Fontana worked with Giorgio Vasari on a few commissions, which are briefly described in the Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors and Architects. Vasari notes that Fontana was unable to complete his work on the Chateau of Fontainebleau (1560) in France due to a health issue. Finished collaborative work includes the Palazzo Vecchio in Florence (1563-5). Florian H√§rb observes the similarities between several of Vasari's drawings and Fontana's larger paintings, which indicate that the drawings were the basis for much of Fontana's commissions. There are multiple explanations offered by H√§rb and Charles Davis, including Fontana's admiration of Vasari's style and prominence in Renaissance Italy. In 1565, Fontana was elected to the Accademia delle Arti del Disegno in Florence. In 1576, Fontana was one of several artists and intellectuals consulted by Cardinal Gabriele Paleotti in the debate over the reformation of religious art. Pellegrino Tabaldi and Fontana worked on the Cappella Poggi in S Giacomo Maggiore in Bologna. Towards the end of his career, Fontana opened a school of art in Bologna. Some of his most notable students were Ludovico Carracci, Agostino Carracci, Lorenzo Sabbatini, and Denys Calvaert. In Bologna, Fontana served as a arbitrator and resolved professional disputes. Robert W. Gaston explains that this was a prestigious position at the time. Fontana died in Bologna in 1597. The altarpiece of the Adoration of the Magi, in the church of Santa Maria delle Grazie, is considered to be his masterpiece. A large quantity of his work remains in Bologna.  Artistry  = Artistic influences = The majority of the artists who trained and collaborated with Fontana were heavily influenced by Raphael. He also looked to the work of Antonio da Correggio, Sebastiano del Piombo, and Giulio Romano. = Style = Fontana was well-known for the speed in which he completed commissions. Carlo Cesare Malvasia criticized him for being careless and unprofessional. His early style is considered conservative. He gradually incorporated elements of Mannerism into his style after working with prominent artists of the movement. He is an early representative of the Bolognese school of painting. His style has been compared to that of Paolo Veronese.

Overview Approach-avoidance conflicts occur when there is one goal or event that has both positive and negative effects or characteristics that make the goal appealing and unappealing simultaneously. For example, marriage is a momentous decision that has both positive and negative aspects. The positive aspects, or approach portion, of marriage might be considered togetherness, sharing memories, and companionship while the negative aspects, or avoidance portions, might include financial considerations, arguments, and difficulty with in-laws. The negative effects of the decision help influence the decision maker to avoid the goal or event, while the positive effects influence the decision maker to want to approach or proceed with the goal or event. The influence of the negative and positive aspects create a conflict because the decision maker has to either proceed toward the goal or avoid the goal altogether. For example, the decision maker might approach proposing to a partner with excitement because of the positive aspects of marriage. On the other hand, he or she might avoid proposing due to the negative aspects of marriage. The decision maker might initiate approach toward the goal, but as awareness of the negative factors increases, the desire to avoid the goal may arise, producing indecision. If there are competing feelings to a goal, the stronger of the two will triumph. For instance, if a person was thinking of starting a business they would be faced with positive and negative aspects. Before actually starting the business, the person would be excited about the prospects of success for the new business and they would encounter (approach) the positive aspects first: they would attract investors, create interest in their upcoming ideas and it would be a new challenge. However, as they drew closer to actually launching the business, the negative aspects would become more apparent; the person would acknowledge that it would require much effort, time, and energy from other aspects of their life. The increase in strength of these negative aspects (avoidance) would cause them to avoid the conflict or goal of starting the new business, which might result in indecision. Research pertaining to approach and avoidance conflicts has been extended into implicit motives, both abstract and social in nature.

The title alludes to the first seven letters of the NATO phonetic alphabet. The LP album cover claimed it was produced by no-one, in fact, it was recorded independently by engineer Tony Cohen and the group, prior to signing with Mushroom Records. It was released in November 1980, but no singles were released commercially from the album, although \\"Two People Per km¬≤\\" and \\"Uncontrollable Boy\\" were on a 12-inch disc released to radio stations, and a music video was made for \\"Two People Per km¬≤\\". The album was re-released on CD in 1990. Background Models had formed in Melbourne in 1978 by former members of Teenage Radio Stars and JAB. Following some line-up changes they consolidated into Andrew Duffield on keyboards, Mark Ferrie on bass guitar, Janis Friedenfelds (aka Johnny Crash) on drums and percussion, and Sean Kelly on vocals and lead guitar. Their first release in October 1979 was a give-away single, \\"Early Morning Brain (It's Not Quite the Same as Sobriety)\\" backed with The Boys Next Door's \\"Scatterbrain\\". Friction within the band led to their break-up in November, record producers Vanda & Young asked Models to cut some demos - so they reformed at the end of December. Their second single was another giveaway, \\"Owe You Nothing,\\" composed of tracks from the Vanda and Young sessions. It appeared in August 1980. In November of that year the Duffield, Ferrie, Friedenfelds and Kelly line-up released Models' first album, Alphabravocharliedeltaechofoxtrotgolf, on Mushroom Records. It peaked at #43 on the Australian albums chart. NOTE: Used for Australian Singles and Albums charting until ARIA created their own charts in mid-1988. The album was well received by audiences familiar with the group from the live pub circuit. No singles were released commercially from the album, although \\"Two People Per km¬≤\\" and \\"Uncontrollable Boy\\" were on a 12-inch disc released to radio stations, and a music video was made for \\"Two People Per km¬≤\\". The video was directed by Ray Argall as part of a short film about the group. The band performed extensively both locally and interstate, supporting the Ramones and Midnight Oil on a national tour. Early in 1981, Friedenfelds was replaced by Buster Stiggs from New Zealand band The Swingers. In June, Models released a 10\\" album, Cut Lunch, which consisted of further tracks originally intended as demos, produced by Tony Cohen and Models except one produced by Split Enz keyboard player Eddie Rayner.

It has weak androgenic and estrogenic activity and no other important hormonal activity. The medication is a prodrug of norethisterone in the body. NETA was patented in 1957 and was introduced for medical use in 1964. It is sometimes referred to as a \\"first-generation\\" progestin. NETA is marketed widely throughout the world. It is available as a generic medication.https://www.drugs.com/availability/generic-aygestin.html Medical uses NETA is used as a hormonal contraceptive in combination with estrogen, in the treatment of gynecological disorders such as abnormal uterine bleeding, and as a component of menopausal hormone therapy for the treatment of menopausal symptoms. =Available forms= NETA is available in the form of tablets for use by mouth both alone and in combination with estrogens including estradiol, estradiol valerate, and ethinylestradiol. Transdermal patches providing a combination of 50 Œºg/day estradiol and 0.14 or 0.25 mg/day NETA are available under the brand names CombiPatch and Estalis. NETA was previously available for use by intramuscular injection in the form of ampoules containing 20 mg NETA, 5 mg estradiol benzoate, 8 mg estradiol valerate, and 180 mg testosterone enanthate in oil solution under the brand name Ablacton to suppress lactation in postpartum women. Contraindications Side effects Side effects of NETA include menstrual irregularities, headaches, nausea, breast tenderness, mood changes, acne, increased hair growth, and others. Overdose Interactions Pharmacology Norethisterone (17Œ≤-deacetyl-NETA), the active form of NETA. Norethisterone and ethinylestradiol levels over 24 hours after a single oral dose of 10 mg NETA in postmenopausal women. NETA is a prodrug of norethisterone in the body. Upon oral ingestion, it is rapidly converted into norethisterone by esterases during intestinal and first-pass hepatic metabolism. Hence, as a prodrug of norethisterone, NETA has essentially the same effects, acting as a potent progestogen with additional weak androgenic and estrogenic activity (the latter via its metabolite ethinylestradiol). In terms of dosage equivalence, norethisterone and NETA are typically used at respective dosages of 0.35 mg/day and 0.6 mg/day as progestogen-only contraceptives, and at respective dosages of 0.5‚Äì1 mg/day and 1‚Äì1.5 mg/day in combination with ethinylestradiol in combined oral contraceptives. Conversely, the two drugs have been used at about the same dosages in menopausal hormone therapy for the treatment of menopausal symptoms. NETA is of about 12% higher molecular weight than norethisterone due to the presence of its C17Œ≤ acetate ester. Micronization of NETA has been found to increase its potency by several-fold in animals and women. The endometrial transformation dosage of micronized NETA per cycle is 12 to 14 mg, whereas that for non-micronized NETA is 30 to 60 mg. NETA metabolizes into ethinylestradiol at a rate of 0.20 to 0.33% across a dose range of 10 to 40 mg. Peak levels of ethinylestradiol with a 10, 20, or 40 mg dose of NETA were 58, 178, and 231 pg/mL, respectively. For comparison, a 30 to 40 Œºg dose of oral ethinylestradiol typically results in a peak ethinylestradiol level of 100 to 135 pg/mL. As such, in terms of ethinylestradiol exposure, 10 to 20 mg NETA may be equivalent to 20 to 30 Œºg ethinylestradiol and 40 mg NETA may be similar to 50 Œºg ethinylestradiol. Due to its estrogenic activity via ethinylestradiol, high doses of NETA have been proposed for add-back in the treatment of endometriosis without estrogen supplementation. Generation of ethinylestradiol with high doses of NETA may increase the risk of venous thromboembolism. Chemistry NETA, also known as norethinyltestosterone acetate, as well as 17Œ±-ethynyl-19-nortestosterone 17Œ≤-acetate or 17Œ±-ethynylestra-4-en-17Œ≤-ol-3-one 17Œ≤-acetate, is a progestin, or synthetic progestogen, of the 19-nortestosterone group, and a synthetic estrane steroid. It is the C17Œ≤ acetate ester of norethisterone. NETA is a derivative of testosterone with an ethynyl group at the C17Œ± position, the methyl group at the C19 position removed, and an acetate ester attached at the C17Œ≤ position. In addition to testosterone, it is a combined derivative of nandrolone (19-nortestosterone) and ethisterone (17Œ±-ethynyltestosterone). =Synthesis= Chemical syntheses of NETA have been published. History Schering AG filed for a patent for NETA in June 1957, and the patent was issued in December 1960. The drug was first marketed, by Parke-Davis as Norlestrin in the United States, in March 1964. This was a combination formulation of 2.5 mg NETA and 50 Œºg ethinylestradiol and was indicated as an oral contraceptive. Other early brand names of NETA used in oral contraceptives included Minovlar and Anovlar. Society and culture =Generic names= Norethisterone acetate is the , , and of NETA while norethindrone acetate is its and . =Brand names= NETA is marketed under a variety of brand names throughout the world including Primolut-Nor (major), Aygestin (), Gestakadin, Milligynon, Monogest, Norlutate (, ), Primolut N, SH-420 (), Sovel, and Styptin among others. =Availability= United States NETA is marketed in high-dose 5 mg oral tablets in the United States under the brand names Aygestin and Norlutate for the treatment of gynecological disorders. In addition, it is available under a large number of brand names at much lower dosages (0.1 to 1 mg) in combination with estrogens such as ethinylestradiol and estradiol as a combined oral contraceptive and for use in menopausal hormone therapy for the treatment of menopausal symptoms. Research NETA has been studied for use as a potential male hormonal contraceptive in combination with testosterone in men.

Further south lies an open area, Wormwood Scrubs Park, and Wormwood Scrubs prison. Willesden Junction station lies to the north of the area. In the mid nineteenth century it was a centre for pig farming. History Originally Old Oak Common was a stretch of land defined by what became the Harrow Road at its northern end, and its eastern edge was the northern source of Stamford Brook, forming a boundary with Wormwood Scrubs. By 1801Paddington Canal#The branches the Paddington Canal had cut it in half, further reducing its size. With the coming of the railways, most of the common was lost and what remained became part of Wormwood Scrubs. The Great Western Railway's Great Western Main Line (GWML) of 1838-1841 from London Paddington to Bristol and the 1903 Acton- Northolt line to the Great Western and Great Central Joint Railway at Northolt divided at Old Oak junction. The partially singled Acton-Northolt line closed in December 2018 to allow for the construction of Old Oak Common railway station, which will offer interchange between GWML trains, the Elizabeth line and the High Speed 2 (HS2) line to Birmingham. Additional rail interchanges may be provided with the construction of two new London Overground stations, on the West London line and Old Oak Common Lane on the North London line. In summer 2011, the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham launched a wide- ranging 'Park Royal City' plan for Old Oak Common, including the proposed station, and with light-rail lines to the surrounding areas. Regeneration In December 2013, The Independent reported that Antony Spencer, Founder of Stadium Capital Development, was to head up a ¬£5 billion regeneration scheme in the area, with partner Queens Park Rangers.

Biography Folengo was born of noble parentage at Cipada near Mantua, Italy. From his infancy he showed great vivacity of mind, and a remarkable cleverness in making verses. At the age of sixteen he entered the monastery of Sant'Eufemia near Brescia, and eighteen months afterwards he became a professed member of the Benedictine order. For a few years his life as a monk seems to have been tolerably regular, and he is said to have produced a considerable quantity of Latin verse, written, not unsuccessfully, in the Virgilian style. About the year 1516 he forsook the monastic life for the society of a well-born young woman named Girolama Dieda, with whom he wandered about the country for several years, often suffering great poverty, having no other means of support than his talent for writing. Maccheronee His first work, under the Latin pseudonym Merlinus Cocaius, was the macaronic narrative poem Baldo (1517), which relates the adventures of a fictitious hero named Baldo (\\"Baldus\\"), a descendant of French royalty and something of a juvenile delinquent who encounters imprisonment; battles with local authorities, pirates, shepherds, witches, and demons; and a journey to the underworld. Throughout his adventures Baldo is accompanied by various companions, among them a giant, a centaur, a magician, and his best friend Cingar, a trickster. Baldo blended Latin with various Italian dialects in hexameter verse. Though frequently censured, it soon attained a wide popularity, and within a very few years passed through several editions and was later expanded by Folengo. Folengo's next work was Orlandino, an Italian poem of eight cantos, written in rhymed octaves. It appeared in 1526, and bore on the title-page the new pseudonym of Limerno Pitocco (Merlin the Beggar) da Mantova. In the same year, wearied with a life of dissipation, Folengo returned to his ecclesiastical roots; and shortly afterwards wrote his Caos del tri per uno, in which, partly in prose, partly in verse, sometimes in Latin, sometimes in Italian, and sometimes in macaronic, he gives a veiled account of the vicissitudes of the life he had lived under his various names. We next find him about the year 1533 writing in rhymed octaves a life of Christ entitled L'Umanit√† del Figliuolo di Dio; and he is known to have composed, still later, another religious poem upon the creation, fall and restoration of man, besides a few tragedies. These, however, have never been published. Some of his later years were spent in Sicily under the patronage of Ferrante Gonzaga, who served the emperor Charles V as Viceroy of Sicily (1535‚Äì1546). He appears to have been based at the abbey of San Martino delle Scale (Monreale). In 1543 he retired to the Santa Croce monastery of Campese, near Bassano; and there he died on December 9, 1544.

Despite having been 1-0 down after two Tests, England won the next three Tests to finish 3-1 victors (with two draws), thus retaining the Ashes. The series is popularly known as Botham's Ashes, owing to the remarkable performances of Ian Botham with both bat and ball. Australian squad Australia's captain Greg Chappell made himself unavailable for selection. The Australian squad selected for the tour was as follows: *Batsmen ‚Äì Kim Hughes (captain), Allan Border, Graeme Wood, John Dyson, Graham Yallop, Martin Kent, Dirk Wellham, Trevor Chappell *Fast bowlers ‚Äì Dennis Lillee, Terry Alderman, Rodney Hogg, Geoff Lawson *Spinners ‚Äì Ray Bright, Graeme Beard *Wicketkeeper ‚Äì Rod Marsh, Steve Rixon =Selection controversies= Doug Walters was overlooked despite a strong summer at home. This resulted in protests from fans and Walters' eventual retirement from first class cricket. Bruce Yardley had been Australia's most successful spinner that summer with 47 wickets, followed by Jim Higgs with 38. The selectors preferred Ray Bright (22 wickets at 40) and Graeme Beard (29 wickets at 25). =Replacements= Mike Whitney was called up as a replacement during the tour. Test series summary =First Test= =Second Test= =Third Test= =Fourth Test= =Fifth Test= =Sixth Test= Test series Although the two teams were generally disappointing by the world standards being set by West Indies at that time, the 1981 Ashes is nevertheless widely regarded as one of the most entertaining Test series ever due to the see-sawing nature of both the individual games and the series as a whole. England won the series 3-1 despite being 1-0 down after the first two Tests. Before the third Test at Headingley, the inspirational Mike Brearley was reinstated as England captain, replacing Ian Botham, whose 12-Test tenure as captain had been winless and whose previously excellent form with both bat and ball had fallen away (he had made a pair in the second Test at Lord's). A galvanised Botham took 6 for 95 in Australia's first innings and scored 50 in England's, but Australia nonetheless compiled 401 for 9 declared (John Dyson scoring 102) and bowled England out for 174, thus forcing England to follow on 227 runs in arrears. Despite a stubborn 46 from Geoff Boycott, in the second innings Botham came to the crease with England on 105 for 5, still requiring 122 runs to avoid an innings defeat. He played an outstanding innings of 149 not out, sharing partnerships of 117 with Graham Dilley for the eighth wicket, 67 with Chris Old for the ninth and 37 with Bob Willis for the tenth, to set Australia a target of 130. Australia then reached 56 for 1, seemingly well set, before Brearley switched Willis' bowling end to allow him to bowl down the slope. Willis bowled a superb spell of 8 for 43 to dismiss Australia for 111; England became only the second team in Test Match history to win a match after being made to follow on.Cricinfo - The great escape The fourth Test at Edgbaston was a similarly inspired comeback victory for England. England conceded a 69-run first innings deficit, and set Australia a target of only 151 in the fourth innings. Australia reached 105 for 4 before Botham took five for 11, including a spell of five wickets for a solitary run, to end Australia's second innings at 121 and give England victory by 29 runs. England also went on to win the fifth Test at Old Trafford to retain the Ashes, including another century for Botham (who reached his hundred in 86 balls). Botham scored 118 from 102 balls, dominating a chalk-and-cheese partnership of 149 with Chris Tavar√©, who blocked his way to 78 from 289 balls. Botham's innings included 6 sixes, which was an Ashes record until Ben Stokes's innings of 135 at Headingley in the 2019 Ashes series. Second-innings centuries from Allan Border and Graham Yallop could not avert defeat. The sixth Test at the Oval was drawn, with Dennis Lillee taking 11 wickets in the match and Botham taking 10. One Day Internationals (ODIs) Three ODIs were played on this tour prior to the Test series. Australia won the Prudential Trophy 2‚Äì1, winning at Edgbaston and Headingley, after losing the first match at Lord's. =1st ODI= =2nd ODI= =3rd ODI= Visit to Sri Lanka The Australian team visited Sri Lanka in May 1981 en route to England.

Although the weapons and the reason for their use changed dramatically throughout these five centuries, a few fundamental traits have remained constant in the Italian school. Some of these are the preference for certain guards, the preoccupation with time (or \\"tempo\\") in fencing as well as many of the defensive actions. Of especial influence was the Dardi school of fencing with the spada da lato in the 16th to early 17th centuries, which gave rise to the classical early modern style of fencing with the rapier, including Elizabethan Fencing in England and the French school of fencing in the 18th century (which in turn developed into modern sport fencing).  Renaissance to Baroque period  One of the earliest known Italian treatises on swordsmanship and other martial arts is the Flos Duellatorum (Fior Di Battaglia/The Flower of Battle) written by Fiore dei Liberi around 1409. Fiore's treatise describes an advanced martial arts system of grappling, dagger, short sword, longsword, pollaxe, and spear. Another important treatise, De Arte Gladiatoria Dimicandi, was written by Filippo Vadi sometime between 1482 and 1487. Although different, Vadi's work appears to be based upon Fiore's earlier work. It has been suggested that Vadi's style of swordsmanship represents a transitional phase between that of Fiore and the later Bolognese masters.Guy Windsor, Vadi Guards (PDF) A general survey of the 16th-century Italian manuals shows instruction for the following weapon or weapon combinations in at least one published manual: *Sword alone *Sword and Dagger *Sword and Small Buckler *Sword and Broad Buckler *Sword and Targa *Sword and Rotella *Sword and Cape *Sword and Gauntlet *Two Swords *Sword for Two Hands (also referred to as the Spadone by some masters) *Dagger *Dagger and Cape *Halberd *Spetum *Ronca (weapon) *Partisan (weapon) *Partisan and Shield *Lance *Pike *Unarmed against Dagger The most significant group of authors from this time were those from the Bolognese school and it included such masters as Achille Marozzo, Antonio Manciolino, Angelo Viggiani and Giovanni dall'Agocchie. However, there were other Italian authors not directly associated with the Bolognese school including Camillo Agrippa (who has the distinction of codifying the four guards‚Äîprima, seconda, terza and quarta‚Äîthat survive to this day), Giacomo di Grassi who wrote a manual in 1570 which was translated into English in the 1590s. With the 17th century came the popularity of the rapier and a new century of masters, including Salvator Fabris, Ridolfo Capoferro, and Francesco Antonio Marcelli. Unlike the manuals of the previous century, those written for in the 17th century were generally restricted to covering only the rapier being used alone or with a companion arm (such as the dagger, cloak or rotella). By the end of the 17th century, the manuals begin to take on a more classical character in both the terminology and the presentation of the techniques.  Classical  Although there is a considerable gap in extant Italian treatises, between 1696 and 1800, we can see from the earliest 19th century treatises that the style had changed very little during that period. The only changes were the addition of certain techniques suitable for the somewhat lighter blades of the dueling swords typically used in 1800 as compared to the rapiers typical for the end of the 17th century (compare the techniques presented by Bond√¨ di Mazo in his 1696 manual with those in the 1803 manual of Giuseppe Rosaroll-Scorza and Pietro Grisetti). Even at the beginning of 19th century techniques for coming to grips were still being taught and the use of the dagger as an accompanying weapon was still discussed (although not as a prominent and popular choice). By the end of the 19th century, the immediate ancestor of modern fencing had developed with its familiar pedagogy and collection of techniques and theory. At this time, the two predominant schools within the Italian tradition are the Radaellian (after Maestro G. Radaelli) and the Neapolitan. In 1883 the Italian Ministry of War selected the treatise by Neapolitan Masaniello Parise to be the official syllabus of the newly founded Scuola Magistrale of fencing (now called Classical Italian Fencing). Parise's teachings survive to this day almost unchanged, although many of Radaelli's saber teachings were incorporated. Contemporary practice In Italy, the National Academy (Accademia Nazionale) certifies masters in both historical fencing and modern fencing based on careful adherence to the principles of Italian swordsmanship. Abroad, the Italian style is cultivated by professional institutions such as the San Jose State fencing program (California, United States), where Maestro William Gaugler ran a program largely based on the Classical style of Parise. The Historical European martial arts (HEMA) and the Western Martial Arts (WMA) communities in Europe and the United States have practitioners of Italian masters such as Fiore dei Liberi, Filippo Vadi, Achille Marozzo, Salvator Fabris, Ridolfo Capo Ferro, Francesco Alfieri, etc. Practitioners include Brian R. Price of the Schola Saint George, Bob Charron of St. Martin's Academy (both studying Fiore dei Liberi), Gregory Mele of the Chicago Swordplay Guild (studying Fiore and Vadi), Matt Easton of London's Schola Gladiatoria, Ken Harding of the St Louis School of Arms, and Guy Windsor, of Finland's School of European Swordsmanship.

During this period southern France was under the control of Vichy France and not occupied by Nazi Germany. At Cadix, the predominantly Polish team of cryptanalysts who had previously worked at PC Bruno was reassembled, and worked against German and other Axis ciphers, including the German Enigma machine cipher. Cadix shut down when Germany occupied southern France.W≈Çadys≈Çaw Kozaczuk, Enigma, 1984, pp. 118‚Äì47. History After the German conquest of Poland in 1939, key personnel of the Polish Cipher Bureau escaped to France. Major Gustave Bertrand of French intelligence established PC Bruno, where the Poles worked, via teletype line, with British cryptologists at Bletchley Park to break Enigma. During the German invasion of France, PC Bruno had to be evacuated. On 22 June 1940, France signed an armistice with Germany. Two days later, Major Bertrand flew the essential personnel of PC Bruno to French-controlled Algeria. Bertrand remained an officer of the official French intelligence service, nominally controlled by \\"Vichy France\\", the quasi-collaborationist regime headed by Marshal P√©tain. But Bertrand and the service retained substantial independence. In September 1940, Bertrand secretly returned the PC Bruno staff to the unoccupied area of southern France. At the Ch√¢teau des Fouzes, near Uz√®s on the Mediterranean coast, they formed a new intelligence center codenamed Cadix. (Cadix was apparently derived from the French name for the Spanish city of C√°diz.) There they resumed work against Axis ciphers. The staff at Cadix comprised 15 Poles, 9 Frenchmen, and 7 Spaniards (the latter worked on Italian and Spanish ciphers). From left: Top Polish analysts Zygalski, R√≥≈ºycki, and Rejewski. Photo taken at Cadix between September 1940 and June 1941. One unusual task came in July 1941. The Polish Cipher Bureau chiefs asked Polish analysts Marian Rejewski and Henryk Zygalski to test the security of the Polish Lacida (or LCD) rotor cipher machine. The device had evidently never been subjected to rigorous testing before being approved for production and wartime use. To the consternation of the Cipher Bureau chiefs, the two mathematicians made short work of the Lacida.Kozaczuk, Enigma, 1984, p. 134‚Äì35. Cadix had a branch office in Algeria, directed by Maksymilian Ciƒô≈ºki, which periodically exchanged staff with Uz√®s. When the passenger ship Lamorici√®re mysteriously sank on 9 January 1942, several Cadix staff sailing to France in one of these exchanges were lost. Those lost included Jerzy R√≥≈ºycki, one of the Cipher Bureau's three mathematician-cryptologists, Piotr Smole≈Ñski and Jan Grali≈Ñski of the prewar Cipher Bureau's Russian section, and Captain Fran√ßois Lane, a French officer accompanying the three Poles.Kozaczuk, Enigma, 1984, p. 128. On 8 November 1942, Allied forces landed in French North Africa. When the French authorities there submitted to the Allies and broke with Vichy France, Germany occupied southern France. Major Bertrand, anticipating this outcome, evacuated Cadix on 9 November, two days before the German forces moved.Kozaczuk, Enigma, 1984, p. 139. The Cadix staff dispersed, attempting to reach Allied territory. Rejewski and Zygalski eventually crossed into Spain, where they were arrested and imprisoned. Released after Red Cross intercessions, they went to Britain. There they were employed by British intelligence until the war's end, against German SS \\"hand\\" ciphers. Cadix's Polish military chiefs, Gwido Langer and Maksymilian Ciƒô≈ºki, were captured by the Germans as they tried to cross from France into Spain on the night of 10‚Äì11 March 1943. Three other Poles were captured with them, Antoni Palluth, Edward Fokczy≈Ñski, and Kazimierz Gaca. Langer and Ciƒô≈ºki became prisoners of war. The other three men were sent as slave labor to Germany, where Palluth and Fokczy≈Ñski perished. All five men protected the secret of Allied decryption of the Enigma cipher.Kozaczuk, Enigma, 1984, p. 156.

He went to the seminary at Padua in 1704, studied under Facciolati, and in due course attained the priesthood. From 1724 to 1730 he held the office of rector of the seminary at Ceneda, and from 1731 to 1765 that of father confessor in the seminary of Padua. The remaining years of his life were mainly spent in his native village. He died at Padua in 1768 before the completion of the great work on which he had long co-operated with Facciolati. This was the vast Latin Lexicon, which has formed the basis of all similar works that have since been published. He was engaged with his Herculean task for nearly thirty-five years, and the transcription of the manuscript by Luigi Violato occupied eight years more.

It starts at 5:15am and ended at 8:30am (UTC +8) on weekdays while the weekend edition which ran from 1999 to 2004 and airs from 5:30am to 7:00am PST on weekends. History =Alas Singko Y Medya (1996‚Äì2002)= The ABS-CBN management conceptualized the morning show in 1995 when Magandang Umaga Po was still on air. The show started on June 3, 1996 as Alas Singko Y Medya (literally means 5:30; derived from Spanish A las cinco y media) which premiered with original hosts Julius Babao and Panjee Gonzalez. Gonzalez temporarily left the show due to her upcoming marriage to Eugenio \\"Gabby\\" Lopez III, who would be ABS-CBN's chairman and CEO since 1997 but later returned a few months later until Tintin Bersola was named as the permanent replacement to her. Aida Gonzalez was the first female traffic reporter of the show (and of the network) was named host in 1996 and Alvin Elchico, an anchor from TV Patrol Western Visayas (now TV Patrol Negros), has been assigned to the main office in Quezon City and was in the show since 1997. With this addition, the show's ratings were increasing. On January 16, 1999, the show aired a weekend edition to cater the needs of the people every morning and to continue its ratings increase. The edition were initially hosted by Cosim with Mon Ilagan and RJ Ledesma. On January 17, 2000, the network launched Balita Alas Singko ng Umaga to serve as the pre- programming for the morning show. Babao and Cosim would serve as the main news anchors while Bersola, Jeff Fernando and Riki Kwek for lifestyle tips and other feature segments and Ira Panganiban for sports. Each host would switch roles for some who are not present, but share the same task to one another. On March 5, 2001, the would-be couple Babao and Bersola temporarily left the show to host Talk TV, a new talk show that served as the replacement of Today with Kris Aquino. Cosim and Ilagan, together with Cherie Mercado, Connie Sison and Pia Guanio were named as weekday hosts. On August 2, 2002, the network has decided to reformat the show and to retain some of its hosts, as part of their rechange of some of the news and current affairs shows like TV Patrol. It was confirmed that the show would undergo major changes and would be renamed as Magandang Umaga, Bayan on Monday followed by a new morning talk show that would replace Morning Girls. =Magandang Umaga, Bayan (2002‚Äì2005)= Part of the major change of morning shows on ABS-CBN to boost up against its competition, the show was renamed Magandang Umaga, Bayan (Good Morning, Nation) and premiered on August 5, 2002 retaining Julius Babao, Christine Bersola-Babao, Cheryl Cosim, Aida Gonzalez, Rikki Kwek (reprising as VJ Rikki), Ira Panganiban, Connie Sison, Pia Guanio, Erwin Tulfo and his wife Karen Padilla from Alas Singko Y Medya as the main hosts of the show. The show welcomed new hosts Bobby Yan, Aljo Bendijo (then anchoring TV Patrol with Korina Sanchez and Henry Omaga-Diaz), then-Cong. Juan Miguel Zubiri, Atty. Jesse Andres, and showbiz reporters Mario Dumaual and Jeff Fernando, and \\"Oooh La La Obet\\" (Obet Serrano). Upcoming segments for Magandang Umaga, Bayan include \\"Problema ng Pinoy\\", a public service portion for the daily concerns of the average citizen, as anchored by Cong. Miguel Zubiri, and \\"Itanong Mo Kay Atty.\\", a legal advice feature that tackles problems set in by viewers from all parts of the country, as anchored by Atty. Jesse Andres of the PECABAR law firm. =Magandang Umaga, Pilipinas (2005‚Äì2007)= In 2005, the first regional morning show was launched on March 7 entitled Maayong Buntag Kapamilya (ABS-CBN TV-3 Cebu) as a local counterpart along with Panay Sikat (ABS-CBN TV-10 Iloilo), launched on January 16, 2006 and Magandang Umaga South Central Mindanao (ABS-CBN TV-3 General Santos and ABS-CBN TV-5 Cotabato), launched on June 19. Also on June 6 of that year, it carried the title Magandang Umaga, Pilipinas with new hosts. The show ended on June 22, 2007 because of poor ratings and was replaced by Umagang Kay Ganda, as a customized format for MUP.

A professional since 1990, he was on top of the Mountain Bike World Championship podium for the first time in 1996 and most recently in 2004. Biography Frischi (as he is called) advocates staying 'fit for life' and dope free racing. He is considered an excellent example of a clean sportsman. In 1996 he was second at the World Cross-country Mountain Bike Championships, but after France's Jerome Chiotti confessed having used EPO when he won the title that year, he got the rainbow jersey from Chiotti, handed over as a friendly act in an unofficial ceremony. He won the Olympic silver medal in 1996. The next day he competed in the men's road race on a Ritchey cyclocross bike after fellow Swiss team member Tony Rominger fell ill. He finished the race in the middle of the pack. Frischknecht also competes in cyclo-cross, where he won an Amateur World Champion title, was Vice World Champion in 1997 and is a multiple-time Swiss Champion. Thomas first traveled to America in 1990 to compete in the then new genre of mountain biking. He became closely linked to Tom Ritchey, a major bike-components producer, who provided support and became a mentor and a good friend. Ritchey has sponsored him ever since. Other major sponsors include Swisspower, an electric utility consortium, and Scott bicycles. Frischknecht was author of a book on mountain biking, Richtig Mountainbiken. He is currently involved with the Frischi Bike School in the Engadin/St. Moritz area of Switzerland.

Built during the last years of the French Revolutionary Wars she was launched at the beginning of the Napoleonic Wars. Her brief career with the French included several major battles, though she spent the last 12 years of her life under the Spanish flag. Neptune was built at Toulon and launched in 1803. She was commissioned in time to join an abortive attempt to break the British blockade of the port in October 1804, but the fleet was forced back to port by bad weather. She sailed again with the fleet, under Vice-Admiral Pierre-Charles Villeneuve, in early 1805, and this time succeeded in breaking out of the Mediterranean, and sailing to the West Indies, where the fleet was joined by Spanish ships. After achieving little in the Caribbean, the fleet sailed back to Europe, where they were engaged by a British fleet in the Battle of Cape Finisterre. Neptune saw little action, and was relatively unscathed. She took part in the final fleet manoeuvres, and ended up blockaded in Cadiz by a British fleet under Lord Nelson. Villeneuve came out of Cadiz in late 1805, and was engaged by Nelson in the decisive Battle of Trafalgar on 21 October. During the battle Neptune fired on Nelson's flagship, , and duelled with several British ships including , and . As the British began to overwhelm the combined fleet, the relatively undamaged Neptune joined several ships in a retreat to Cadiz. She sortied again two days later in an attempt to recover some of the prizes, but the fleet lost more ships than they regained, and Neptune had to be towed back to harbour. There she remained, under a close British blockade, until the Spanish declared war on the French. Trapped in the port, the French handed their ships over to the Spanish, who renamed Neptune Neptuno, replacing a Spanish ship lost at Trafalgar. Neptuno served with the Spanish for a further 12 years, being broken up in 1820. Construction and commissioning Neptune was built at Toulon to a design by Jacques-No√´l San√©, with her keel laid down in 1801. One of San√©'s 80-gun Bucentaure-class, her lines were virtually identical to those of her contemporaries Bucentaure, Indomptable and Formidable, all of which fought at Trafalgar. She was also similar to another Trafalgar combatant, the 80-gun , which had previously been a French warship. She was still under construction on the resumption of the war in 1803 after the Peace of Amiens, but was launched later that year. She was fitted out with masts, yards and rigging, and in late 1804 she was commissioned under Commodore Esprit-Tranquille Maistral. Trafalgar campaign Neptune joined the rest of the Toulon fleet preparing to sail for the West Indies on 21 October 1804 under the command of Vice-Admiral Pierre- Charles Villeneuve. The fleet was to transport 6,500 troops to attack British possessions in the Caribbean, but was unable to leave Toulon owing to the presence of a British fleet under Vice-Admiral Horatio Nelson, that was blockading the port. It was not until early January that Villeneuve judged the situation favourable enough to make a sortie. Neptune sailed with the 20-strong fleet on 17 January, but were sighted by the patrolling frigates of Nelson's inshore squadron. Villeneuve struggled on, but bad weather in the Gulf of Lyons dispersed his fleet, and fearing an attack on his disorganised forces, returned to Toulon three days after setting out. Villeneuve had in fact managed to give Nelson the slip. The two patrolling frigates, and , had rushed to report the news to Nelson, anchored at La Maddalena, and in so doing, left the French unobserved. Nelson had rushed his fleet to sea, anticipating that Villeneuve would heading east. Nelson spent nearly six weeks sailing back and forth across the Mediterranean through heavy seas while the French remained in port, before news finally reached him of Villeneuve's location. It was not until March that the French made another attempt to break out of Toulon, putting to sea on 29 March. Neptune formed part of Villeneuve's division, consisting of the flagship, the 80-gun Bucentaure, and the 74-gun ships Pluton, Mont-Blanc, Berwick and Atlas. The other division was commanded by Rear-Admiral Pierre Dumanoir le Pelley, flying his flag aboard the 80-gun Formidable, and accompanied by the 80-gun Indomptable, and the 74-gun ships Swiftsure, Scipion and Intr√©pide. Accompanying the fleet were six frigates and two brigs. The French fleet reached Cartagena on 6 April, having evaded Nelson through sheer chance, and pressed on from there, sailing through the Strait of Gibraltar on 8 April. After resupplying briefly at Cadiz, the fleet sailed to the West Indies, arriving at Fort de France, Martinique on 14 May, where they were joined over the next two days by six Spanish ships of the line and a frigate under Frederico Gravina. The fleets resupplied and settled in to await the arrival of a large French fleet from Brest under Vice-Admiral Honor√© Joseph Antoine Ganteaume. Unbeknownst to Villeneuve, Ganteaume was still being blockaded in Brest. The combined fleet achieved little while in the West Indies, managing only to capture the British-held Diamond Rock after two weeks of sitting idle at anchor. The small garrison surrendered on 2 June, by which time the frigate Didon had arrived with orders. Villeneuve was instructed to attack and capture the British colonies in the West Indies, before sailing his entire force back to Europe, join Ganteaume at Brest and cover the invasion flotilla. Villeneuve gathered his forces and pressed northwards towards Antigua, but on 7 June he came across a lightly defended convoy of British merchants, and captured several of them the following day. From them he discovered that Nelson was in hot pursuit, and had arrived at Barbados. Villeneuve decided to break off operations and return to Europe. The fleet got underway on 11 June. Finisterre and Cadiz Villeneuve managed to evade Nelson on the return voyage, though his fleet was tracked by the brig , carrying Nelson's despatches. The Admiralty was notified and a reinforced fleet under Vice-Admiral Robert Calder was sent to intercept the Franco- Spanish fleet as it arrived in European waters. The combined fleet was spotted on 22 July as it sailed westwards towards Ferrol, and Calder manoeuvred to intercept it. Villeneuve formed up the line of battle, with Neptune being eleventh from the front, positioned astern of the Berwick and ahead of the Bucentaure. Neptune saw little action in the confused fighting, and consequently escaped with little damage. William Anderson She joined the fleet in entering Vigo Bay on 28 July, and went into Ferrol on 2 August. Neptune sailed with the rest of the fleet on 9 August, and put into Cadiz on 20 August. After spending several months there, watched by the blockading British fleet under Nelson, Villeneuve decided to put to sea in mid-October. Maistral prepared Neptune for sea, and the fleet sailed from Cadiz on 19 October. While in Cadiz Villeneuve had described Neptune as being 'In every respect one of the finest and most seaworthy ships of the Fleet.' As the British approached on the morning of 21 October, Villeneuve formed the line of battle heading northwards, with Neptune the twelfth in the line from the lead ship of the van. She was ahead of the flagship, Bucentaure, on her larboard quarter, and astern on the larboard quarter was the 74-gun Redoutable. Trafalgar Neptune entered the battle about 25 minutes after the start of the action, having by then drifted to leeward and fallen astern of Redoutable. Neptune should have had the position immediately astern of Bucentaure, but the Spanish 74-gun San Justo, which should have been four places astern of Neptune had drifted up to leeward. Maistral hailed San Justo > The San Justo not being in her station and edging down to place herself on > my windward beam hampered me; I at once hailed her to enquire if she knew > her station; I told her that mine was to be next astern to the Bucentaure; > she replied that she was about to place herself astern of me, which she did > not do, and continued to the wind and to fore-reach on me, which made me > fall off a little to leeward and to draw away from the flagship, of whom I > had been within hail in the first place. San Justos captain, Francisco Javier Garst√≥n, blamed the crew's inexperience for failing to keep her station. This would be significant in the coming battle as the position astern of the flagship would be the focus of British attention, and should have been occupied by a powerful ship like the Neptune. Meanwhile, the ship that should have been astern of Neptune, the Spanish 64-gun San Leandro, was following San Justo to leeward, leaving a considerable gap behind the flagship that the British could exploit. Redoutables captain, Jean Jacques √âtienne Lucas, saw the threat, and brought his ship forward in an attempt to close the gap. Despite his efforts, the British were able to break the line between Bucentaure and Redoubtable. The pell mell battle, depicted by J. M. W. Turner, (1806-1808) As the battle started Nelson's flagship, broke the line ahead of Neptune, passing by and raking Bucentaure. As Victory passed by Neptune fired into her with a broadside from her larboard battery, damaging Victorys foremast, bowsprit, spritsail yards, her forward hull and her anchors. Maistral then ordered Neptunes jib run up, to move her out of Victorys range. She briefly engaged at long range, and then wore back to support Villeneuve. Standing someway off to leeward Neptunes gunners reloaded, and then opened fire with a broadside into as the British ship came up through the gap created by Victorys passage. The broadsides cut Temeraires rigging, brought down her foreyard and main topmast, and damaged her fore mast and bowsprit. By now unmanageable, Temeraire came under fire from the San Justo, lying just astern of Neptune. Leaving Temeraire, and declining combat with the newly arrived , Maistral turned eastward, and at 2.30 pm came alongside the starboard bow of the 74-gun . Belleisle had become isolated and took the fire of several French ships until British ships were able to come to her rescue. Neptune battled briefly with the 64-gun , and as the British began to overwhelm the Franco-Spanish fleet, she prepared to run for Cadiz, giving supporting fire for the Principe de Asturias as the Spanish ship withdrew, before joining the retreat to Cadiz. During the fighting Neptune had sustained a relatively minor amount of damage, and had just 15 killed and 39 wounded. =Sortie= Having come through the battle relatively unscathed, Neptune was able to join the sortie made by Captain Julien Cosmao on 23 October, in an attempt to retake some of the captured prizes. Neptune put to sea in company with two French ships, the 80-gun Indomptable and the 74-gun Pluton, and two Spanish ships, the 100-gun Rayo and the 74-gun San Francisco de Asis. Also with the ships of the line were the smaller French ships that had been present at the battle but had not taken part, the frigates Corn√©lie, Th√©mis, Hortense, Rhin and Hermione, and the brigs Furet and Argus. In preparation for the counter-attack the British cast off several of the prizes and formed a defensive line, allowing the frigates to retake two of the captured prizes, both Spanish ships, the 112-gun Santa Ana and the 80-gun Neptuno. Of the two recaptured ships, only the Santa Ana made it back to Cadiz, when the sortieing ships ran into difficulties in the heavy storm that blew up after the battle. The Neptuno ran aground and was destroyed, while a similar fate befell both the Indomptable, after she grounded off Rota, and the San Francisco de Asis, in Cadiz Bay. The Rayo attempted to anchor off San Lucar and ride out the storm, but rolled out her masts in the heavy seas. came up, and being unable to resist, Rayo surrendered to her, but was driven on shore on 26 October and wrecked. Neptune had to be towed back into Cadiz. Blockade and Spanish service The remains of the French fleet were bottled up in Cadiz under Rear- Admiral Rosily, trapped there by the British blockade. With the Spanish entry to the war against France on 4 July 1808, Rosily realised that his fleet was in range of now hostile shore batteries. He attempted to move his fleet, consisting of the Neptune, the 74-gun ships H√©ros, Pluton, Algesiras and Argonaute and the 40-gun frigate Corn√©lie, out of the harbour, but on 9 July the squadron was attacked by Spanish forces from the land and sea. Rosily attempted to negotiate to keep his fleet, but on this being rejected, was forced to surrender it to the Spanish on 14 July. The Spanish took Neptune into their service, renaming her Neptuno as a replacement for the Neptuno lost at Trafalgar, and she served with them until being broken up in 1820. Notes a. The smaller ships were the 40-gun frigates Corn√©lie, Rhin, Hortense and Hermione, the 36-gun frigates Sir√®ne and Th√©mis, and the 18-gun brigs Furet and Pleiade.

Starting off his career with IFK Stockholm in Sweden, Gustafsson went on to play professionally in Norway for three different clubs and in Austria for Red Bull Salzburg. He won 10 caps for the Sweden national team.  Career  Eddie Gustafsson in his last match versus SV Ried = Early career = Gustafsson grew up in the United States before he moved to Sweden where he started playing for IFK Stockholm and IFK Norrk√∂ping before transferring to Norway in 2002, playing for Molde FK. He was their first choice for three seasons, but as his contract expired after the 2004 season he decided to find a new club. He went on several fruitless trials for clubs in Europe and the US, and joined another Norwegian club, Hamarkameratene. The stay only lasted for year. After the 2005 season, Gustafsson signed with FK Lyn. = Red Bull Salzburg = On 8 January 2009 it was announced that Gustafsson had signed a contract with FC Red Bull Salzburg. On 18 April 2010, in an Austrian Bundesliga match against LASK Linz, Gustafsson broke his leg when fouled by Linz forward Lukas Kragl. As Gustafsson went to clear the ball following a through pass, Kragl tried to block but was late and caught Gustafsson midway up his left shin. Gustaffson broke both his tibia and fibula in the tackle. Kragl only received a yellow card for the tackle, whilst the same punishment was given to Gustafsson's teammate Christoph Leitgeb for his reaction towards Kragl following the foul. Gustafsson underwent surgery the same night. Gustafsson celebrated his first post-injury appearance in a midseason friendly against FC Spartak Moscow on 20 January 2011.Salzburger Nachrichten 21 January 2011 Over the following years, Gustafsson never fully achieved a comeback to the starting lineup, instead filling the role of backup goalkeeper behind Alexander Walke and later P√©ter Gul√°csi. Gustafsson last appeared as a goalkeeper in Salzburg's final 2013-2014 Bundesliga home match on 4 May 2014 against SV Ried. He was substituted by P√©ter Gul√°csi in the 78th minute, marking his retirement from professional football.http://fcsalzburgwiki.at/index.php/35._Runde,_Saison_2013/14,_FC_Red_Bull_Salzburg_gegen_SV_Ried  International  Gustafsson made his debut for Sweden on 31 January 2000 in a 1‚Äì0 win against Denmark.

It is available both in combination with an estrogen and alone. It is taken by mouth. Side effects of norgestrel include menstrual irregularities, headaches, nausea, breast tenderness, mood changes, acne, increased hair growth, and others. Norgestrel is a progestin, or a synthetic progestogen, and hence is an agonist of the progesterone receptor, the biological target of progestogens like progesterone. It has weak androgenic activity and no other important hormonal activity. Norgestrel was patented in 1961 and came into medical use, specifically in birth control pills, in 1966. It was subsequently introduced for use in menopausal hormone therapy as well. Norgestrel is sometimes referred to as a \\"second-generation\\" progestin. It is marketed widely throughout the world. Norgestrel is available as a generic medication.https://www.drugs.com/availability/generic-lo-ovral-28.html In 2017, the version with ethinylestradiol was the 284th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than one million prescriptions. Medical uses Norgestrel is used in combination with ethinylestradiol or quinestrol in combined birth control pills, alone in progestogen-only birth control pills, and in combination with estradiol or conjugated estrogens in menopausal hormone therapy. It has also been used as an emergency contraceptive in the Yuzpe regimen. Side effects Pharmacology =Pharmacodynamics= Norgestrel is a progestogen, or an agonist of the progesterone receptor. The biological activity of norgestrel lies in the levo enantiomer, levonorgestrel, whereas the dextro isomer is inactive. As such, norgestrel is identical in its hormonal activity to levonorgestrel except that it is half as potent by weight. Levonorgestrel, and by extension norgestrel, have some androgenic activity, but no estrogenic, antimineralocorticoid, or glucocorticoid activity. =Pharmacokinetics= The pharmacokinetics of norgestrel have been reviewed. Chemistry Norgestrel, also known as rac-13-ethyl-17Œ±-ethynyl-19-nortestosterone or as rac-13-ethyl-17Œ±-ethynylestr-4-en-17Œ≤-ol-3-one, is a synthetic estrane steroid and a derivative of testosterone. It is a racemic mixture of stereoisomers dextronorgestrel (the C13Œ± isomer; l-norgestrel, L-norgestrel, or (+)-norgestrel) and levonorgestrel (the C13Œ≤ isomer; d-norgestrel, D-norgestrel, or (‚Äì)-norgestrel), the former of which is inactive (making norgestrel exactly half as potent as levonorgestrel). Norgestrel is more specifically a derivative of norethisterone (17Œ±-ethynyl-19-nortestosterone) and is a member of the gonane (18-methylestrane) subgroup of the 19-nortestosterone family of progestins. =Synthesis= Chemical syntheses of norgestrel have been published. History Norgestrel was first introduced, as a birth control pill in combination with ethinylestradiol, under the brand name Eugynon in Germany in 1966. It was subsequently marketed as a combined birth control pill with ethinylestradiol in the United States under the brand name Ovral in 1968, and was marketed in many other countries as well. In 2019 it was discontinued. ref name=\\"Publishing2013\\" /> Society and culture =Generic names= Norgestrel is the generic name of the drug and its , , , , , , and .https://www.drugs.com/international/norgestrel.html It is also known as dl-norgestrel, DL-norgestrel, or (¬±)-norgestrel. =Brand names= Norgestrel has been marketed under a variety of brand names including Cyclacur, Cryselle, Cyclo-Progynova, Duoluton, Elinest, Eugynon, Microgynon, Lo/Ovral, Low-Ogestrel, Logynon, Microlut, Minicon, Nordette, Neogest, Ogestrel, Ovral, Ovran, Ovranette, Ovrette, Planovar, Prempak, Progyluton, and Trinordiol among others.

Despite this, in 2007 it was one of 25 recordings chosen that year by the Library of Congress to be added to the National Recording Registry. It is Mitchell's first, and so far only, album to accomplish this feat. It is perhaps best known for the hit single \\"You Turn Me On, I'm a Radio\\", which Mitchell wrote sarcastically out of a record company request for a radio-friendly song. The single was indeed a hit, reaching No. 25 on the Billboard Hot 100 charts, becoming Mitchell's first top 40 hit released under her own name (as a songwriter, several other performers had had hits with songs that she had written). \\"Cold Blue Steel and Sweet Fire\\" ‚Äî a menacing and jazzy portrait of her then lover James Taylor's heroin addiction ‚Äì and the Beethoven-inspired \\"Judgment of the Moon and Stars\\" were also popular. Background Some of the songs were inspired by Mitchell's 1970‚Äì1971 relationship with James Taylor. Despite his difficulties, Mitchell evidently felt that she had found the person with whom she could pair-bond in Taylor. By March 1971, his fame exploded, causing friction. She was reportedly devastated when he broke off the relationship. By November 1971, he had taken up with Carly Simon, whom he married a year later. Songs * \\"Banquet\\" describes a metaphorical table from which \\"some get the gravy / Some get the gristle... and some get nothing / Though there's plenty to spare\\". * In \\"Barangrill\\", Mitchell uses the hunt for an elusive roadside eatery as a metaphor for the quest to \\"find herself\\", enjoying the journey, but with increasing impatience about reaching her destination. * \\"Lesson in Survival\\" is about the longing for greater privacy, a sense of isolation, the frustration of incompatibility, and a love for nature. * \\"Let the Wind Carry Me\\" contrasts thoughts of a more stable, conventional life, based partly on Mitchell's own adolescence, with the need to live with minimal constraints upon one's freedom. * The title song is both a self-portrait and a cool assessment of the frustration and sadness of a lover being a celebrity, dealing with the challenges of fame and fortune. * The second side opens with \\"See You Sometime\\", which deals with fleeting feelings, including jealousy and romantic competition. * \\"Electricity\\" extols the simplicity and serenity of the quiet country life against the way in which people in modern society think of themselves unconsciously as machines, and is thought to be motivated by a particular relationship triangle she was experiencing at the time. * \\"Woman of Heart and Mind\\" is a portrait of a flawed lover and the complexities of being emotionally involved. Critical reception For the Roses was met with critical acclaim. The New York Times said in 1973, \\"Each of Mitchell's songs on For the Roses is a gem glistening with her elegant way with language, her pointed splashes of irony and her perfect shaping of images. Never does Mitchell voice a thought or feeling commonly. She's a songwriter and singer of genius who can't help but make us feel we are not alone.\\" Writing for Rolling Stone, Stephen Davis applauded the singer's ability to explore a variety of emotional perspectives, sometimes in the course of one song: \\"Her great charm and wit, her intense vocal acting and phrasing abilities (the way she chooses to deal with a single word can change the feeling of an entire song) and the sheer power and gumption of her presence combine to bring it all off and make it shine.\\" Randall Davis from the Arcadia Tribune found it difficult to analyze but ultimately \\"a very nice album, pleasant to listen to and, as always with Joni, it is full of sensitive, meaningful lyrics placed against a background of light rock with folky rhythms.\\" In The Michigan Daily, Mike Harper called it the folk rock album of the year, \\"deeply personal and at times self-denyingly severe\\", saying \\"this album lacks the innocence of, say, Ladies of the Canyon but what it gains in womanly heart and wisdom is unmistakably greater: sincere but moreover real, For the Roses is emotionally fulfilling in the best sense of the word.\\" For the Roses was named the seventh best album of 1972 in Robert Christgau's year-end list for Newsday. In his review for Creem, he said the music lacked the liveliness of Blues \\"All I Want\\" and the lyrics' insularity diminished her voice, but he ultimately regarded the album as a \\"remarkable work\\" and the year's aesthetically boldest record. \\"Mitchell has integrated the strange shifts of her voice into an almost 'classical' sounding music\\", Christgau wrote, calling it \\"hypnotic when you give it a chance to work\\". It was voted number 148 in Colin Larkin's All Time Top 1000 Albums 3rd Edition (2000). In 2007, the Library of Congress added the album to its National Recording Registry. In an essay accompanying the selection, Cary O'Dell wrote that the record was \\"Mitchell's first overt foray into jazz, a genre that, for the next several years, would come to dominate her art.\\" Track listing All tracks are written by Joni Mitchell. ;Side one # \\"Banquet\\" ‚Äì 3:01 # \\"Cold Blue Steel and Sweet Fire\\" ‚Äì 4:17 # \\"Barangrill\\" ‚Äì 2:52 # \\"Lesson in Survival\\" ‚Äì 3:11 # \\"Let the Wind Carry Me\\" ‚Äì 3:56 # \\"For the Roses\\" ‚Äì 3:48 ;Side two # \\"See You Sometime\\" ‚Äì 2:56 # \\"Electricity\\" ‚Äì 3:01 # \\"You Turn Me On, I'm a Radio\\" ‚Äì 2:39 # \\"Blonde in the Bleachers\\" ‚Äì 2:42 # \\"Woman of Heart and Mind\\" ‚Äì 2:38 # \\"Judgement of the Moon and Stars (Ludwig's Tune)\\" ‚Äì 5:19 Personnel * Joni Mitchell ‚Äì vocals, guitar, piano * Tom Scott ‚Äì woodwinds, reeds * Wilton Felder ‚Äì bass * Russ Kunkel ‚Äì drums * Bobbye Hall ‚Äì percussion * Bobby Notkoff ‚Äì strings * James Burton ‚Äì electric guitar on \\"Cold Blue Steel and Sweet Fire\\" * Graham Nash ‚Äì harmonica on \\"You Turn Me On I'm a Radio\\" * Stephen Stills ‚Äì rock and roll band on \\"Blonde in the Bleachers\\" ;Technical *Henry Lewy ‚Äì sound engineer, production guidance *Anthony Hudson ‚Äì art direction, design *Joel Bernstein ‚Äì photography References External links * Joni Mitchell's New For The Roses, Robert Hilburn, Los Angeles Times, 21 November 1972; appears at the unofficial site JoniMitchell.com Category:1972 albums Category:Joni Mitchell albums Category:Asylum Records albums Category:Albums recorded at A&M; Studios Category:United States National Recording Registry recordings Category:Albums produced by Joni Mitchell ","title":"For the Roses"},{"id":"2444274","text":"Tele Vue Optics is a Chester, New York-based astronomical optics company known primarily for its premium brand of speciality eyepieces and apochromatic refractor telescopes. Founded in 1977 by Al Nagler, an optical engineer from The Bronx who designed simulators used in the Apollo program, the company originally made projection lenses for large projection-screen televisions, but is well known in the astronomy community for its products. Prior to October 1, 2006, Tele Vue's corporate headquarters has also served as the primary distribution point for Vixen America, a subsidiary of the Japan-based Vixen corporation, with the two companies building equipment that are compatible with each other, especially the Tele Vue refractor with Vixen's \\"sphinx\\" \\"go- to\\" mount. Although the company is no longer the principal distributor, Vixen America still maintains its address at Tele Vue's New York location.  Refractor telescopes  Tele Vue once manufactured a 5\\" refracting telescope named the MPT, the Multi-Purpose Telescope. It had a fast f/4 ratio, and had an adjustable diaphragm that ranged from f/4 to f/20. Only a small number were made, with the last being kept by Televue to use as a final optical quality control for all eyepieces they make. Recent examples of this telescope have sold for well into 5 figures. Today, Tele Vue's apochromatic refractor telescopes, which have reduced chromatic aberration, come in diameters ranging from 60mm (2.4 inches) to 127mm (5 inches). The imaging system (\\"is\\" series) telescopes are designed primarily for astrophotography.  Eyepieces  Tele Vue sells Plossl, Radian, Panoptic, Delos, Nagler, Ethos and Nagler Zoom eyepieces. They made their start with a variety of Plossl eyepieces for amateur astronomers. The introduction of the original Nagler 13mm Type 1 in 1982 with its wide field of view and an equally high price soon made their mark. Using different combinations of lenses of different types of high index optical glasses, the eyepieces produce, respectively, a 50¬∞, 60¬∞,68¬∞, 72¬∞, 82¬∞, 100¬∞ and 50¬∞ apparent field-of-view. Tele Vue calls the 82¬∞ and 100¬∞ apparent field-of-view a \\"spacewalk\\" experience. Wider apparent fields of view are helpful in viewing star clusters, galaxies and nebulae, especially large emission nebulae like the Orion Nebula, but the real reason for wide fields of view is to allow the same true field of view as is found in a lower power, narrower FOV eyepiece. This increases effective contrast and aids in visibility of certain details. Additionally, Tele Vue eyepieces are well corrected for most aberrations, providing edge to edge pinpoint stars, and are well suited to use in popular \\"fast\\" telescopes. The most expensive Tele Vue eyepiece is the Ethos line, which consists of eight eyepieces known for excellent image quality and ultra-wide 100 degree fields, which can retail for from $500 to $800 or more. At the North East Astronomy Forum 2010, they revealed the Ethos SX, a 3.7mm focal length eyepiece with an even greater 110¬∞ apparent field-of-view.Cloudy Nights Telescope Reviews, NEAF Part 1 by Tom Trusock, http://www.cloudynights.com/item.php?item_id=2423 In 2011, a new line of eyepieces was introduced called the Delos. These eyepieces are based on the Ethos but have a smaller field of view of 72¬∞. Instead, they boast a comfortable 20mm eye relief. Some Tele Vue eyepieces are over half a foot long and weigh over two pounds.Televue NP101is and Eyepiece Review, http://www.astrokev.com/2010/11/21/lets-talk-televue/  Mounts  Tele Vue sells several alt-azimuth mounts and tripods.Tele Vue Optics website, Mounts, http://www.televue.com/engine/page.asp?ID=336  Accessories  Tele Vue also manufactures special nebula filters, Barlow lenses, special image amplifiers known as Powermates, the \\"Paracorr\\" coma-corrector for \\"fast\\" (f/5 and below) Newtonian telescopes, and the \\"Dioptrx,\\" a special lens that fits over most Tele Vue eyepieces to correct eyesight astigmatism.

He married Gwenllian Mary Homfray (1905‚Äì2004) at Cowbridge in 1928, and they had three sons. In the Second World War he served as a major in the Territorial Army. He died at St Hilary, near Cowbridge, in 1973. Cricket career At Winchester College, Clay bowled mostly fast but occasionally leg-spin. He first played for Glamorgan as a fast bowler in 1920, the year before they achieved first-class status, but switched to off-spin after some back trouble.Wilfred Wooller, \\"Johnny Clay ‚Äì Pillar of Glamorgan Cricket\\", The Cricketer, Vol 54, No 10, October 1973, p. 19. He played for the club till 1949, as captain from 1924 to 1927 and then again in 1929 and 1946, when they finished sixth, their best position to that time, and at the age of 48 he took 120 wickets at an average of 12.72. Between 1933 and 1938, he served as the club's treasurer and with the captain, Maurice Turnbull, helped raise money through functions and contacts that kept the club afloat. In 1935 he was called up to play a Test match for England at the Oval against South Africa, but did not take a wicket and did not bat. 1937 was his most successful as a bowler, taking 176 wickets, which remains a Glamorgan record; against Worcestershire at Swansea he took 17 wickets in the match.Wisden 1970, p. 214. At the age of 50 he was a key player in Glamorgan's first County Championship title in 1948, taking 19 wickets for 145 runs in the two consecutive innings victories in August that clinched the title.Wisden 1949, p. 321. He took nine wickets in an innings three times. His best figures were 9 for 54 in the first innings against Northamptonshire in 1935; he also took 6 for 32 in the second innings. He was a useful lower-order batsman who hit two centuries, with a highest of 115 not out against the New Zealanders in 1927. In 1929 he made his only Championship hundred against Worcestershire at Swansea, batting at number 10; his stand of 203 with Joe Hills for the ninth wicket is still the club record. John Arlott thought Clay was the best off- spin bowler in England: \\"Some others, perhaps, spun the ball harder ‚Äì though not markedly so ‚Äì but no-one until Laker of a later generation combined his degree of spin and such accuracy, subtlety, and variety of flight.\\"John Arlott, \\"A Builder of Cricket in Wales\\", The Cricketer, Vol 54, No 11, November 1973, p. 73. After cricket Clay was a Test selector in 1947 and 1948. He contributed an annual essay to the Glamorgan County Cricket Club Yearbook from 1933 to 1950. On the basis of these essays, John Arlott declared that Clay was his favourite cricket writer.Benny Green, Benny Green's Cricket Archive, Pavilion Books, London, 1985, p. 73. He served as President of Glamorgan from 1961 until his death in 1973. He died at St Hilary, near Cowbridge, Glamorgan. Outside cricket he had various business interests which often prevented him from playing cricket, which he always played as an amateur. He was a keen fan of horse-racing and was the owner of several long- distance steeplechasers. He served as secretary of the Glamorgan Hunt, and steward and director of Chepstow Racecourse, which had been laid out in the grounds of his family home at Piercefield Park in the 1920s. A long-distance steeplechase is held there annually in his memory. References External links * Clay, John Charles at Dictionary of Welsh Biography * Brief profile of Johnnie Clay by Dr A. K.

The show is hosted by former Miss Philippines (Universe 1994) Charlene Gonzales-Muhlach with the addition to the show, actress comedian Eugene Domingo and Pokwang replacing Joross Gamboa and Roxanne Guinoo. It aired from February 8, 2004 to August 12, 2007 Theme and format \\"BAHAY at BUHAY\\" was the operative phrase for the show which had makeovers as its core component. At Home Ka Dito takes makeover to the next phase as it marries home makeover with life-changing makeover: a makeover that goes beyond the physical. The show is funky and serious, fun and emotional -- a blend of laughter and tears. Each episode tells a story about a celebrity needing a makeover of any space in their home (or anyone related to her) and, in return for the space makeover mission that the show will conduct, the celebrity agrees to do a charitable work for a person who is going through a hard time that the celebrity can relate to or be of assistance. Charlene Gonzalez anchors the show. Every episode kicks off with Charlene meeting Eugene Domingo to discuss the makeover mission for the day. They proceed to the celebrity's place. The teen pair is left to do the makeover with the aid of guest experts (for example, interior designers) and movers. They get to participate in the fun part of makeover activities (craft, carpentry, etc.) and impart practical tips to viewers. As this unfolds in real time, Charlene tags along with the celebrity to meet the chosen person who needs their help. They go through a step-by-step solution to the chosen person's problem (the range is wide: issues like dealing with teenage pregnancy, sibling rivalry, generation gap, insecurity, coping with the burden of being a breadwinner, etc.). The intercutting follow through of the progress of the home and life- changing makeovers. This culminates with a series of heart-rending reveal of surprises (mostly of wish-fulfillment related to the needs of the case study ex. Kabuhayan Showcase) for the chosen person as they arrive at a solution. The celebrity is then surprised with the space makeover output and the episode ends on a feel-good note.

It emerged when the former county of Hanau-M√ºnzenberg became a secundogeniture of Hesse-Cassel in 1760. When the reigning count, William IX, also became landgrave of Hesse- Cassel in 1785, the two governments began to merge, although the process was delayed first by French occupation, and later by incorporation into the French satellite duchy of Frankfurt. The incorporation of Hesse-Hanau with Hesse- Cassel was not completed until 1821. Secundogeniture When the hereditary prince of Hesse-Cassel, the later Frederick II, converted to Roman Catholicism, his father, the reigning landgrave William IX decided to do what he could to limit his son's future realm. He therefore made the county of Hanau-M√ºnzenberg, incorporated with Hesse-Cassel in 1736, a secundogeniture of Hesse-Cassel, transferring it to the oldest son of Frederic, the hereditary count William.N√∂ding 1836, pp. 231-240.Arnd 1858, pp. 347-348. Sovereignty Wilhelmsbad was built during the short sovereignty of Hesse-Hanau. As count William was underage, his mother the landgravine, princess Mary of Great Britain, ruled as his legal guardian. After his access to the throne of Hesse- Cassel in 1760, landgrave Frederick II repeatedly tried to reunite Hesse-Hanau with Hesse-Cassel, but his efforts failed due to the resistance of Great Britain and the Protestant estates. As further protection, troops from Hanover were garrisoned in Hanau. When William came of age in 1764 he took over the government of the county. At the death of Frederick II in 1785, William became landgrave of Hesse-Cassel. The government of Hesse-Hanau remained in general separate from Hesse-Cassel. Cabinet and war office were, however, merged with those in Hesse-Cassel, and the court of appeal of Cassel got jurisdiction over Hanau in 1792.Arnd 1858, pp. 348-349. Until then Hesse-Hanau was ruled as an independent state, undergoing extensive modernizations with the erection of significant buildings in the capital of Hanau.Dietrich 1993, pp. 208-211. Means for this came from the subsidies the reigning count received from his uncle, king George III of Great Britain. In return, Hesse-Hanau made available a contingent of 2,400 soldiers for the use of the British Crown in the American Revolutionary War.K√ºgler 1980, pp. 120. 158.

In 1806, however, Hesse-Cassel was incorporated into the French satellite kingdom of Westphalia, while Hanau came under French military occupation, then in 1810 being incorporated into the Grand Duchy of Frankfurt, another French satellite. It was first after the German War of Liberation in 1813, that the sovereignty of Hesse-Cassel was restored. The incorporation of Hanau in Hesse-Cassel was, however, not completed until the death of prince-elector William in 1821, and the administrative reforms under his successor William II, when the county became the landkreis of Hanau.Arnd 1858, pp. 349-357.

Grant National Historic Site is a United States National Historic Site located 10 miles (16 km) southwest of downtown St. Louis, Missouri, within the municipality of Grantwood Village. The site, also known as White Haven, commemorates the life, military career, and Presidency of Ulysses S. Grant. Five historic structures are preserved at the site, including the childhood home of Ulysses' wife, Julia Dent Grant. White Haven was an 850-acre plantation worked by enslaved people; Grant supervised their forced labor from 1854 to 1859. History After his marriage to Julia, Grant was stationed in Michigan and New York. Julia traveled with him to these posts, returning to White Haven in 1850 for the birth of their first child, Fred, in 1850. When Ulysses was sent west in 1852, Julia was not able to go with him, being pregnant with their second child. She returned to her parents' home after stopping at Ulysses' parents' home in Ohio, where Ulysses Jr., was born. Grant's army pay was insufficient to bring his family out to the West Coast, and he tried several business ventures to supplement his income. Suffering from depression and loneliness after being separated for two years, Grant finally resigned from the army in 1854 and returned to White Haven. Grant farmed the White Haven property for his father-in-law, working with the slaves owned by Julia's father. Two more children were born, Ellen, born on July 4, 1855, and Jesse, in February 1858. Due to a financial panic in 1857, along with bad weather that destroyed many farmers' crops, Ulysses worked for a short time in the city of St. Louis in real estate and as an engineer. In 1860, Ulysses, Julia, and their four children moved to Galena, Illinois. Ulysses worked with his brothers selling leather goods made in their father's tannery. =Slavery at White Haven= Many visitors to Ulysses S. Grant National Historic Site are surprised to learn that enslaved people lived and worked on the 19th-century farm known as White Haven. According to the National Park Service, during the 1850s the forced labor of enslaved people \\"was used extensively in the farming and maintenance of the 850-acre plantation.\\" From 1854 to 1859, Grant lived here with his wife, Julia, and their children, managing the farm for his father-in-law, Colonel Dent. His experience running this forced labor camp may have influenced him in his later roles as the Union general who won the war which abolished that \\"peculiar institution,\\" and as President of the United States. =The setting= Most slaveholders in Missouri enslaved few people; those who owned ten were considered wealthy. In the southeastern Bootheel area and along the fertile Missouri River valley known as \\"little Dixie,\\" large, single-crop plantations predominated, with an intensive use of enslaved labor. Elsewhere in the state, large farms produced a variety of staples, including hemp, wheat, oats, hay, and corn. On many of these estates the owner worked alongside his enslaved people to harvest the greatest economic benefit from the land. This forced labor system was less entrenched in the city of St. Louis, where the African American population was 2% in 1860, down from 25% in 1830. Enslaved people were often \\"hired out\\" by their masters in return for an agreed upon wage. A portion of the wage was sometimes paid to enslaved people, allowing a measure of self-determination and in some cases the opportunity to purchase their freedom. =Early farm residents and slavery= Each of the farm's early residents enslaved people during their tenure on the Gravois property. When Theodore and Anne Lucas Hunt purchased William Lindsay Long's home in 1818, there existed \\"several good log cabins\\" on the property‚Äîpotential quarters for the five enslaved people purchased earlier by Hunt. The work of Walace, Andrew, Lydia, Loutette, and Adie would be an important part of the Hunts' farming venture. The Hunts sold the Gravois property to Frederick Dent in 1820, for the sum of $6,000. Naming the property \\"White Haven\\" after his family home in Maryland, Colonel Dent considered himself a Southern gentleman with enslaved people whom he could force to do the farmwork. By the 1850s, 18 people were enslaved at White Haven. =Growing up as an enslaved person= In 1830, half of the people enslaved by Dent were under the age of ten. Henrietta, Sue, Ann, and Jeff, among other enslaved people, played with the Dent children. Julia Dent recalled that they fished for minnows, climbed trees for bird nests, and gathered strawberries. However, the enslaved children also had chores such as feeding chickens and cows, and they mastered their assigned tasks as the white children went off to school. Returning home from boarding school, Julia noted the transition from playmate to servant. She noted that the enslaved girls had \\"attained the dignity of white aprons.\\" These aprons symbolized forced labor, a departure from the less structured days of childhood play. =Household responsibilities= Enslaved adults performed many household chores on the Dent plantation. Kitty and Rose served as nurses to Julia and Emma, while Mary Robinson became the family cook. The wide variety of foods prepared in her kitchen were highly praised by Julia: \\"Such loaves of beautiful snowy cake, such plates full of delicious Maryland biscuit, such exquisite custards and puddings, such omelettes, gumbo soup, and fritters.\\" An enslaved man named \\"Old Bob,\\" who traveled with the Dents from Maryland in 1816, had the responsibility to keep the fires going in White Haven's seven fireplaces. Julia thought Bob was careless to allow the embers to die out, as this forced him \\"to walk a mile to some neighbors and bring home a brand of fire from their backlog.\\" Such \\"carelessness\\" provided Bob and many other enslaved people an opportunity to escape their masters' eyes. =Tending the farm= Forced labor was used extensively in the farming and maintenance of the 850-acre plantation. Using the \\"best improvements in farm machinery\\" owned by Colonel Dent, field hands plowed, sowed and reaped the wheat, oats, Irish potatoes, and Indian corn grown on the estate. Enslaved people also cared for the orchards and gardens, harvesting the fruits and vegetables for consumption by all who lived on the property. During Grant's management of the farm, he worked side by side with Dan, one of the enslaved people given to Julia at birth. Grant, along with Dan and other enslaved people, felled trees and took firewood by wagon to sell to acquaintances in St. Louis. More than 75 horses, cattle, and pigs required daily attention, while grounds maintenance and numerous remodeling projects on the main house and outbuildings used the skills of enslaved people. =Personal lives= Enslaved people claimed time for socializing amid their chores. Corn shuckings provided one opportunity to come together as a community to eat, drink, sing, and visit, often including enslaved people from nearby plantations. Participation in religious activities, individually or as a group, also provided a sense of integrity. Julia remembered \\"Old Bob\\" going into the meadow to pray and sing. According to historian Lorenzo J. Greene, \\"St. Louis‚Ä¶was the only place in the state where the organized black church achieved any measure of success.\\" It is unknown whether Dent allowed the people he enslaved to attend services. =Freedom= In Mary Robinson's July 24, 1885, recollections, during an interview for the Missouri Republican's memorial to Grant following his death, she noted that \\"he always said he wanted to give his wife's slaves their freedom as soon as he was able.\\" In 1859, Grant freed William Jones, the only person he is known to have enslaved. During the Civil War, some enslaved people at White Haven simply walked off, as they did on many plantations in both Union and Confederate states. Missouri's constitutional convention abolished slavery in the state in January 1865, freeing any enslaved people still living at White Haven. \\"I Ulysses S. Grant... do hereby manumit, emancipate and set free from Slavery my Negro man William, sometimes called William Jones... forever.\\" Post-Grant history The Grants turned White Haven over to William Henry Vanderbilt in 1881, to satisfy a loan Vanderbilt gave Grant after one of the latter's financial partners absconded with investment funds. A portion of the plantation was later purchased by Adolphus Busch, where he developed his Grant's Farm property, and the acreage around the main house was rescued from development of a Grant-themed amusement park in 1913 by Albert Wenzlick, a St. Louis real estate developer. The house was maintained by Wenzlick and his son until the latter's death in 1979. The property was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979, and was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1986. In 1989, White Haven became a part of the National Park Service, and is currently one of more than 400 sites managed by that agency. The current superintendent is M. Tucker Blythe.

John Freind (1675 ‚Äì 26 July 1728) was an English physician. Life He was younger brother of Robert Freind (1667‚Äì1751), headmaster of Westminster School, and was born at Croughton, Northamptonshire. He was under Richard Busby at Westminster School, and studied at Christ Church, Oxford under Henry Aldrich. After this he began the study of medicine, and having proved his scientific attainments by various treatises was appointed a lecturer on chemistry at Oxford in 1704. In the following year he accompanied the English army, under Charles Mordaunt, 3rd Earl of Peterborough, into Spain. Shortly after his return in 1713 from Flanders, where he had accompanied British troops, he took up residence in London, where he soon obtained a reputation as a physician. In 1716 he became a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians, delivered the Goulstonian Lectures in 1717, was chosen one of the censors in 1718 and Harveian orator in 1720. In 1722 he entered the House of Commons as Member of Parliament (MP) for Launceston in Cornwall; but, being suspected of favoring the cause of the exiled Stuarts, he spent half of that year in the Tower. In 1726 Freind was appointed physician to Queen Caroline, an office which he held till his death. He had purchased the manor of Hitcham in Berkshire and was buried there. There is also a memorial to him within Westminster Abbey.'The Abbey Scientists' Hall, A.R. p21: London; Roger & Robert Nicholson; 1966 Works While still very young, he produced with Peter Foulkes an edition of the speeches of Aeschines and Demosthenes on the affair of Ctesiphon. On returning home in 1707, he wrote an account of the expedition to Spain, which attained great popularity. In 1709 he published his Prelectiones chimicae, which he dedicated to Sir Isaac Newton. During his imprisonment he conceived his major work, The History of Physic, of which the first part appeared in 1725, and the second in the following year. Included in this volume was a paper by Dr. Henry Levett, also written in Latin, addressing the treatment of smallpox. A complete edition of his Latin works, with a Latin translation of the History of Physic, edited by John Wigan, was published in London in 1732.

They are thought to have originated as the Venetian Jewish del Banco family, Anselmo and Abraham Ha Levi Kahana de Palenzuela from Spain, one of the wealthiest Sephardic German families in the early 16th century.Our Crowd: The Great Jewish Families of New York, by Stephen Birmingham, Syracuse University Press 1996, page 190 Following restrictions imposed on banking and the Jewish community, they moved to Bologna, and thence to Warburg, in Germany, in the 16th century, after which they later took their name. The first known ancestor was Simon von Kassel. The family later established itself in Altona, near Hamburg in the 17th century, after the Thirty Years' War, and it was in Hamburg that M. M. Warburg & Co. was established in 1798, among the oldest still existing investment banks in the world. Other banks created by members of the family include M.M.Warburg & Co.; Warburg Pincus; and S. G. Warburg & Co., renamed UBS Warburg in 1995, following its acquisition by UBS. Family organization =Alsterufer and Mittelweg lines= The family is traditionally divided into two prominent lines, the Alsterufer Warburgs and the Mittelweg Warburgs. The Alsterufer Warburgs descended from Siegmund Warburg (1835‚Äì1889) and the Mittelweg Warburgs descended from his brother Moritz M. Warburg (1838‚Äì1910). They took their nicknames from the brothers' respective addresses in Hamburg's Rotherbaum neighborhood. The brothers were grandsons of Moses Marcus Warburg. Siegmund George Warburg was of the Alsterufer lines; the five brothers Abraham (Aby) M., Max M., Paul M., Felix M. and Fritz Moritz Warburg were of the Mittelweg line. The brothers Moses Marcus Warburg (1763‚Äì1830) and Gerson Warburg (1765‚Äì1826) founded the M. M. Warburg & Co. banking company in 1798. Moses Warburg's great-great grandson, Siegmund George Warburg, founded the investment bank S. G. Warburg & Co in London in 1946. Siegmund's second cousin, Eric Warburg, founded Warburg Pincus in New York in 1938. Eric Warburg's son Max Warburg Jr. (not to be confused with Eric's father Max Warburg) is currently one of the three partners of M.M.Warburg & Co., Warburg. Max Warburg's elder brother Aby Warburg used family resources to establish the Kulturwissenschaftliche Bibliothek Warburg in Hamburg, since 1934 The Warburg Institute in London. Paul Warburg is most famous as an architect of the US Federal Reserve System, established in 1913, as a member of the first Federal Reserve Board, and its Vice Chairman until his resignation in August 1918. =American and German Warburgs= A former townhouse of Felix Warburg's in Manhattan, New York City. Felix and Paul Warburg emigrated to the United States. Felix Warburg married Frieda Schiff, only daughter of Jacob H. Schiff, a banker who grew up in Frankfurt, and had ties to the German Warburgs. Schiff financed parts of the American rail system through his investment bank of Kuhn, Loeb & Co. and interacted with newly American Warburgs as all three worked for and married into the investment baking firm of Kuhn, Loeb & Co. Beginning with the marriage of Jacob Schiff in 1875 to Therese Loeb, a daughter of Solomon Loeb, becoming a full partner in the business firm. In 1895 Paul Warburg married Nina Loeb, daughter of Solomon Loeb of Kuhn, Loeb & Co.,having met her at the wedding of brother Felix Warburg who had married Jacob Schiff's daughter, Frieda. Originally it was Abraham Kuhn who concentrated his family wealth and business relations with newly immigrated distant cousin Solomon Loeb, by his marriage to Kuhn's sister. Shortly thereafter the two became full partners in their newly established New York banking investment firm of Kuhn, Loeb & Co.Naomi Wiener Cohen, Jacob H. Schiff: a study in American Jewish leadership In more recent times Schiff's great-great grandson Drew, previously was married to Al Gore's daughter, Karenna. Having ties to America and Germany like many other prominent Jewish financial families, the Warburgs abroad maintained close ties to their Jewish roots. Felix Warburg's house in New York City is now the Jewish Museum, and Kfar Warburg in Israel is named for him. Otto Warburg, a cousin of the German- based Warburgs was a wealthy botanist who was elected head of the World Zionist Organization in 1911. Felix's brother, Paul Warburg was one of the original founders of the board of the U.S. Federal Reserve System, a collection of 12 regional Reserve Banks headed by a Board of Governors which regulates and oversees private commercial banks. As one of the most prominent bankers of his time, his brother Max Warburg attended the Paris Peace Conference of 1919 at Versailles, as part of the German delegation. During the Weimar Republic, Max Warburg served on the board ('Generalrat') of the Reichsbank from 1924 to 1933, under two successive chairmen, Hjalmar Schacht, (until 1930), and Hans Luther (1930-1933); until 1934, he was also on the Board of the Bankenverband. Max Warburg emigrated in 1938. In the 1920s and 1930s, until the end of the Weimar Republic in 1933, Max Warburg also served on several Supervisory Boards (\\"Aufsichtsrat\\") in industry, notably HAPAG, Blohm &Voss;, Beiersdorf, and, until his resignation in 1932, as a member of the Supervisory Board (\\"Aufsichtsrat\\") of the German conglomerate/ chemical firm known as I.G. Farben (Interessen Gemeinschaft Farben). His brother Paul Warburg, who died in January 1932 - a year before Hitler was elected Chancellor - also served on numerous Supervisory Boards (\\"Aufsichtsrat\\") including allegedly that of an I.G. Farben wholly owned US subsidiary. Most members of the German Warburg family had fled to the United States or Great Britain by the end of 1938. However, Max Warburg's brother, Fritz Warburg, who was preparing his exile in Sweden, was arrested by the Gestapo in Hamburg in early November 1938 and spent some months in prison before he could leave for Stockholm in May 1939. His daughter Eva came to organize the emigration for 500 German Jewish children from Germany and Austria to Sweden in 1938 and 1939.Rudberg, Pontus, The Swedish Jews and the Victims of Nazi Terror, Uppsala 2015, pp. 48-49. Also, three cousins, mother, Gerta and daughters Betty and Helene Julie (Burchard) Warburg, stayed in Altona. Gerta and Betty died in the Sobibor extermination camp in 1940 and Helena Julie in Auschwitz in 1942. A life size portrait of Helene Julie by the Norwegian artist Edvard Munch today hangs in the Kunsthaus in Zurich (The Lady in White).Ron Chernow, The Warburgs (Vantage: 1993) Eric Warburg, son of Max Warburg, returned to Germany as an officer (colonel) in the American Air Force and was influential in restoring German-Jewish relations and rebuilding Germany's economic ties after the Second World War through his international business associations. Eric's son, also called Max, is currently a partner in M.M. Warburg & Co. in Hamburg. =Venetian origins= The Warburg family is thought to have originated from Venice, at which point they bore the surname del-Banco. The historical documents describe Anselmo del Banco as Jewish and as having been one of the wealthiest residents of Venice in the early 16th century. In 1513, del Banco was granted a charter by the Venetian government permitting the lending of money with interest. Del Banco left with his family after new restrictions were placed upon the Jewish community coinciding with the establishment of a Ghetto. The family settled in Bologna, and from there to the German town of Warburg, and adopted that town's name as their own surname, after having moved to Hamburg after the Thirty Years' War.

The character appeared in the New Universe imprint of Marvel Comics, primarily as the protagonist of a 32-issue comic book series of the same name published from 1986 to 1989. Most of its run was written by Peter David and penciled by Lee Weeks, though it also featured rare 1980s Marvel work from Keith Giffen. David later reintroduced Justice as a supporting character in Spider-Man 2099, a series with a very different setting. This version of the character, also known as the Net Prophet, was older and had different powers. In 2007, the New Universe concepts were also revived, in a modified form, as a single-title ongoing series, newuniversal. A new version of John Tensen is one of the main characters featured in that series and two other characters with 'Justice' powers have also appeared. This is a different character than the Justice of Marvel's standard Marvel Universe continuity, belonging instead as per the Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe: Alternate Universes 2005 to Earth-148611 (the New Universe). Publication history Justice was one of four New Universe titles created by Archie Goodwin, who also wrote the first issue of the series. The original premise didn't fit well with the central concept of the New Universe: as a visitor from another dimension, Justice contradicted the rule that there had been no superhumans before the White Event, and the fact that this other dimension was peopled by a race biologically identical to humans, who all spoke English, and who lived in a society closely resembling a romanticized Medieval Europe, overrode the New Universe's advertised basis in realism. The first regular creative team on Justice consisted of Steve Englehart (writer), Geoff Isherwood (penciler, occasional writer), and Vincent Colletta (inker). Isherwood had been suggested for the series by editor-in-chief Jim Shooter. However, only Colletta stayed on past issue #8, with Gerry Conway taking on writing chores and Keith Giffen becoming the penciler. This team lasted only three issues, and was unable to finish the story arc begun back in issue #1. With no new creative team ready, the series went over to fill-in issues for the next three months. Despite this, Justice was one of four New Universe titles (along with Psi-Force, D.P. 7 and Star Brand) to survive beyond the line's first year. Issue #15 introduced the new creative team of Peter David and Lee Weeks, and presented a wholesale retcon which revealed that almost all of the events of the past 14 issues had been a hallucination created by a comatose paranormal, and that Justice was actually a normal human, not from another dimension. This retcon, which was conceived by D.P. 7 writer Mark Gruenwald in order to bring Justice into line with the New Universe concept, allowed David to introduce an entirely new cast of characters in issue #16, along with a new costume for Justice. Only the title character's \\"sword\\" and \\"shield\\" powers and general likeness were retained from the series' first 14 issues. In issue #22 John Tensen joins the National Security Council, and Justice became essentially a team book, with the title character working alongside paranormals such as Playback and Kleenex. For the last year that they were published, the New Universe comics switched to direct sales format only. Justice was cancelled with issue #32. Justice later appeared (in his original costume) in Quasar and Starblast. In March 2006, Marvel Comics released a Justice special as part of the \\"Untold Tales of the New Universe\\" event. This issue, written by David, ostensibly takes place between Justice #16 and 18, but is inconsistent with the series canon. Fictional character biography Justice was a middle-aged DEA agent named John Tensen, whose wife was killed by vengeful members of organized crime. He was undercover at the time of the \\"White Event\\", investigating Daedalus Darquill and his son Damon Conquest, who were running drugs out of their front company, Conquest Dynamics. He begins experiencing headaches as his psionic powers manifest. Eventually his cover is blown, and Darquill uses his own newfound parability to remake himself, Tensen, and the others around him into characters from a fantasy dimension, the \\"Far Place\\". Tensen's new identity is that of a law-enforcing knight called a \\"Justice Warrior\\", who was having an illicit affair with Queen Endolana of the Land of Spring when he was exiled to Earth.Justice #1,15, 17 As a Justice Warrior, Tensen has a self-assured, black-and-white sense of right and wrong, supported by his ability to see people's inner auras and thus determine at a glance whether they are good or evil; it is never revealed whether Darquill was able to give him this power for real or the power of suggestion convinced Tensen that he was seeing people's auras, with a combination of simple observation and luck contributing to its accuracy. Using his normal paranormal powers, he almost invariably executes people with evil auras, even if they surrender. His primary mission is to stop Darquill and Conquest, who in Darquill's fantasy are evil wizards from the Land of Winter. He learns Earth's ways while befriending Rebecca Chambers, a DEA agent with a \\"golden aura\\" denoting utmost purity, and Arnie, a cab driver. He battles Hounds, soulless creatures created by Darquill.Justice #1-7 Eventually, Chambers is brainwashed by the Wizards of Winter against Justice. This helps Damon to manipulate Justice into deep despair and anger, and these dire emotions feed a machine constructed by the Wizards to destroy Spring.Justice #8-10 The wizard Webstral escapes to Earth and, as he tells of Spring's fall and the king's death, heals Justice of the impurity caused by his earlier injuries before perishing.Justice #11 Before he can return to liberate the land of Spring, Justice finds himself tormented by memories of his real past as John Tensen. He turns to dream therapist Keith Remsen. Darquill sends Chambers to kill them, and Justice is forced to kill her in their defense. He travels to the Far Place and kills Conquest before Darquill again banishes him to Earth. By this time, Remsen has determined that the Far Place is entirely constructed by a comatose Darquill, and shows his sleeping body to Justice as proof. Against Remsen's warnings, Justice kills Darquill in his sleep; this destroys his identity as the Justice Warrior and leaves only John Tensen.Justice #15 Afterwards, Remsen spends months honing Tensen's mental defenses so that he will never again be enthralled.Justice #17 However, whenever Tensen is drugged or fatigued these defenses are weakened, and he once again retreats into his \\"Justice Warrior\\" persona, suffering severe audiovisual hallucinations.Justice #21-22 and 31 No longer able to see good and evil auras, Tensen's ability to see the distinct aura of a paranormal surfaces, and he turns to executing paranormals who abuse their abilities, leaving only his victims' heads and hands intact and drawing the scales of justice in their ashes. He becomes known as \\"The Justice Killer\\" by newspapers. During this time, his interest is captured by Miriam Morse, a.k.a. Playback, a psychic who can replay images of crime scenes. The authorities, including the National Security Agency, pursue and catch Justice at Pitt-Aid, a benefit concert.Justice #16-20 Remembering his roots as an agent for the Department of Justice, Tensen agrees to serve as a special operative of the NSA. They reintroduce him to Playback, now one of his co-agents, and his teenage daughter, Angela, who has the paranormal ability to reanimate the dead. As his first assignment, the NSA tells him to deal with a gang of vigilantes who emulate him. An order from Justice for them to cease their activities is misinterpreted, and they commit mass suicide.Justice #23 This tragedy helps to convince Tensen to end his \\"Justice Killer\\" doings and to temper his justice with mercy.Justice #24 and 25 The NSA comes into conflict with Judge Mental, leader of the Forsaken, a group of freakish paranormals hiding at Coney Island. One of Judge Mental's agents blows up NSA headquarters. Tensen kills Judge Mental and his right-hand man, Seraph. Along with Angie and her boyfriend, Victor \\"Kleenex\\" Pasko, he then presides over the Forsaken in Judge Mental's place.Justice #31-32 Powers and abilities Justice was able to create a personal force-field with his left hand (which he referred to as his \\"shield\\"), and fire a deadly blast of energy with his right hand (his \\"sword\\"). Furthermore, he was able to see people's auras and thereby judge instantly whether they were inherently good or evil (this being the primary reason for his draconian morality, though later it was said he could mainly read paranormals). In addition, he was a master of hand-to-hand combat and could apparently heal severe injuries by concentrating. (At one point, he apparently regenerated his right hand over a period of one month after it had been lost in a fight with one of Darquill's creatures; however, for a time his \\"sword\\" no longer functioned reliably. Since Justice never performed such a feat after his illusions were dispelled [see below], and since these events happened during the period Justice had trouble differentiating fantasy from reality, it is unknown whether this power, too, was an illusion.) Later, when Justice surfaced in the Marvel Universe of 2099, his powers changed drastically (see below). The newuniversal version of Justice also has different abilities; he appears to possess a limited form of telepathy, allowing him to read misdeeds from someone else's mind. He also manifests solid constructs made from glowing energy; these appear as either flat, rectangular panels which he uses as shields or platforms, or angular shapes which he uses as cutting blades. Other versions =Marvel 2099= Despite the collapse of the New Universe, Peter David retained a fondness for the character, and in late 1993 re-introduced a version of Justice in the Marvel 2099 line's Spider-Man 2099 comic book as the \\"Net Prophet\\", a.k.a. the Prophet of Thor. He appeared from a portal into a dimension 2099 scientist Jordan Boone dubbed \\"Virtual Unreality\\", from whence also came Thanatos, an alternate-timeline version of Rick Jones in search of powerful relics from other worlds. Although Tensen claimed to remember Thanatos, the events surrounding any such encounter are unclear (it could be the object of power in question from Tensen's universe was the Star Brand). Tensen began his life in 2099 as an amnesiac, and with altered powers. Gone were his trademark psionic \\"sword\\" and \\"shield\\", replaced by Optic Beams, and Spatial Translocation powers that required his hands be freed. He and Spider-Man defeated Thanatos, then Tensen had adventures of his own, confronting similar themes of hero worship as on his Earth. Keeping near the Church of St. Patrick in New York's Downtown area, he befriended and later romanced Jennifer D'Angelo, a priest at the church and sister to Spider-Man's fiancee, Dana. When last seen in 2099, Tensen had remembered his real name and met Spider-Man's former girlfriend, Xina Kwan, who was then leaving New York City for parts unknown. He joined her, and in that particular timeline, neither was seen again. =Exiles= A version of Justice, along with many other characters from the New Universe, has appeared in Exiles as part of their \\"World Tour\\" story arc. The Justice depicted in this storyline is as the character originally appeared, ignoring the later changes by David, indicating a previous divergent point in continuity (perhaps as early as Justice #1 or 2). In this story, Justice battled Kevin MacTaggert, the mutant called Proteus (possessing the body of Mimic), in order to thwart his attempts to possess the Star Brand. He lost the battle, and Proteus possessed him. In a scenario similar to the events which brought Tensen to 2099 on Earth-928 (see above), Proteus and Justice arrived via Alchemax scientist Jordan Boone's Virtual Unreality portal. His body degenerating due to Proteus' abilities, he allied himself with Boone long enough to find a suitable replacement host: John Eisenhart, the Hulk of 2099. The Tensen of this divergent timeline apparently perished, his life force spent by the powerful mutant.Exiles #72-74 =newuniversal= The re-imagined New Universe called newuniversal presents three different versions of Justice. * John Tensen becomes Justice when the White Event in 2006 grants him the Justice glyph. John is a well known and respected NYPD detective who, having no family, has completely dedicated himself to his job. John and his partner are involved in a shootout, and the very same bullet that kills his partner lodges in his brain, sending him into a coma (declared \\"98% dead\\"). John is a deeply disturbed individual, having gone insane by having effectively died and been resurrected by the Justice glyph. He fully believes that he is dead and that he has been sent to hell, which has been made to look like New York. Further, the city has been completely populated by sinners. He takes it upon himself to kill them, cleansing hell. By the end of newuniversal: shockfront #1, John has fallen completely into his delusion, and is seen sitting amongst his latest victims (both men and women), talking to both them and to himself. John is in shock, saying that they (his latest victims) were worse than anything he'd found in two weeks of killing. John is too afraid to see if hell is larger than Manhattan, demanding that the dead bodies tell him how to kill more of them quicker. * Veronica Kelly was granted the Justice glyph during the failed White Event called The FireWorks, and is introduced in the newuniversal: 1959 one-shot. Veronica Kelly is a resident of Kansas City and the widow of a police officer who was killed by a corrupt colleague. Veronica is one of three people who become superhuman as a result of the Fireworks in April 1953, gaining the Justice glyph. Kelly's powers were portrayed slightly differently from John Tensen's, forming energy blades in the shape of scissors and knives. Although she evidently had a similar ability to see a person's guilt in their aura, newuniversal: 1959 does not show her manifesting any energy shields. * Ukru is newuniversal's first Justice, having gained the glyph in 2689BCE, some years after the first failed White Event, and is introduced in the newuniversal: conqueror one-shot. Conqueror details the events surrounding the first superhumans, explaining that Ukru helped found the Latvian city of Zardath, which is ruled by Starr the Slayer, bearer of the Starbrand. Ukru's mind has collapsed and he is being used as a hunting animal - drugged on \\"poppybrew\\", chained, controlled by handlers, and left to sleep in an \\"ice-engine\\" device when he is not required. It is later revealed that his mind has been deliberately destroyed by the city's Nightmask, Trull, who has been using Ukru to locate and abduct other superhumans before they can join Zardath. Ukru is a giant of a man, far taller than the other inhabitants of Zardath - large enough to grasp someone around the waist with one hand. It is never explicitly stated that this is due to the damage that Trull has done to his mind, but Trull's other superhuman victims are physically mutated by their uncontrolled powers after their minds are drained and Ukru is the only Justice to be transformed in this way. It is possible that Ukru is meant to be similar to Mastodon, the giant muscular team-mate of New Universe's DP7. Maintaining the shield part of his energy powers, Ukru utilizes them in order to create blue energy limbs to act as an accelerated mode of transportation to cover greater distances than he normally would on foot. In other media =Psi-Man references= A version of Justice's story completed itself in the 1992 novel, Psi-Man, Book 6: Haven, published by Diamond Books. Original Justice series writer Peter David wrote the novel under the pseudonym of David Peters. The novel's protagonist, Chuck Simon, possessed superhuman mental powers; as such, he was constantly chased by government operatives. In the finale of the six-book series, Simon arrived at Coney Island for a final showdown. Due to legal reasons, David could not use the name or likeness of Tensen, so instead he tweaked the character's name and role, inventing the character of Tom Jensen, a.k.a. The Magistrate, who presided over freakish superhuman beings at the former Coney Island amusement park circa 2021. With some deviations, Jensen shared most of the abilities and some history with his Marvel Comics counterpart. Jensen allied himself with Simon and saved his life, dying in the process. The entire Psi-Man novel series was rereleased in 2000 by Ace Books in new editions under David's real name.

The movement's leader was Zainuddin MZ, an Islamic preacher and chairman of the party's central leadership. He and other dissatisfied party members planned to establish a new party to be called the PPP Reformasi (PPP Reform). After a meeting between the discontents and Hamzah Haz, Hamzah agreed to accommodate the demands of Zainuddin's group for a restructuring and regeneration of the PPP leadership. Zainuddin said he did not want to be responsible for the breakup of the PPP. A \\"Team of 7\\" was established to undertake the changes, but Zainuddin sent the PPP leadership a letter stating that he was not prepared to sit on the team as it was not in accordance with party rules. On January 8, 2002, Zainuddin resigned from the PPP and on January 20 declared the formation of the PPP Reformasi with a logo similar to that of the PPP but with five stars added. As the 2002 Election Law did not allow parties to use existing party names or symbols, the PPP Reformasi became the Reform Star Party with a new symbol.Partai-Partai Politik Indonesia: Ideologi dan Program 2004-2009 (Indonesian Political Parties: Ideologies and Programs 2004-2009 Kompas (1999) pp328-338Tempo magazine No. 0931/March 31-April 06, 2009, p. 20 The party has been beset by internal conflict.

In its early years, the Garrick appears to have specialised in the performance of melodrama. The theatre later became associated with comedies, including No Sex Please, We're British, which played for four years from 1982 to 1986.  History  There was previously another theatre that was sometimes called the Garrick in London, in Leman Street, opened in 1831 and demolished in 1881.Allingham, Philip V. \\"Theatres in Victorian London\\", The Victorian Web, 29 November 2015 The new Garrick Theatre was financed in 1889 by the playwright W. S. Gilbert, the author of over 75 plays, including the Gilbert and Sullivan comic operas. It was designed by Walter Emden, with C. J. Phipps brought in as a consultant to help with the planning on the difficult site after an underground river was discovered in the excavation. Originally the theatre had 800 seats on four levels, but the gallery (top) level has since been closed and the seating capacity reduced to 656. The theatre's first manager was Gilbert's friend John Hare.\\"Garrick Theatre ‚Äì Theatre history\\", Best of Theatre, accessed 24 December 2015 The first play at the theatre, The Profligate, by Arthur Wing Pinero and starring Hare, opened on 24 April 1889. Sydney Grundy's long-running French-style comedy A Pair of Spectacles opened here in February 1890. Mrs Patrick Campbell starred five years later in Pinero's The Notorious Mrs. Ebbsmith. Afterwards, the theatre suffered a short period of decline until it was leased by Arthur Bourchier for six years, whose wife, Violet Vanbrugh, starred in a series of successful productions ranging from farce to Shakespeare.Littlewood, S. R. \\"Vanbrugh, Dame Irene (1872‚Äì1949)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edition, January 2011, accessed 7 Jan 2011 In 1900, the theatre hosted J. M. Barrie's The Wedding Guest. Rutland Barrington presented several stage works at the Garrick, including his popular \\"fairy play\\" called Water Babies in 1902, based on Charles Kingsley's book, with music by Alfred Cellier, among others. The only piece actually premiered by W. S. Gilbert here was Harlequin and the Fairy's Dilemma (retitled The Fairy's Dilemma after a few days), a \\"Domestic Pantomime\\" (1904). In 1921, Basil Rathbone played Dr. Lawson in The Edge o' Beyond at the Garrick, and the following year Sir Seymour Hicks appeared in his own play, The Man in Dress Clothes. In 1925, Henry Daniell played there as Jack Race in Cobra and appeared there again as Paul Cortot in Marriage by Purchase in March 1932. A proposed redevelopment of Covent Garden by the GLC in 1968 saw the theatre under threat, together with the nearby Vaudeville, Adelphi, Lyceum, and Duchess Theatres. An active campaign by Equity, the Musicians' Union, and theatre owners under the auspices of the Save London Theatres Campaign led to the abandonment of the scheme.\\"Theatre History\\", Vaudeville Theatre, accessed 12 June 2013 The gold- leaf auditorium was restored in 1986 by the stage designer Carl Toms, and in 1997 the front fa√ßade was renovated. The theatre has mostly been associated with comedies or comedy-dramas. More recent productions are listed below and include No Sex Please, We're British (1982), which played for four years at the theatre before transferring to the Duchess Theatre in 1986. In 1995, the Royal National Theatre's multi-award-winning production of J. B. Priestley's An Inspector Calls opened here, having played successful seasons at the Royal National Theatre's Lyttelton and Olivier theatres as well as the Aldwych Theatre and a season on Broadway. In 1986, the Garrick was acquired by the Stoll Moss Group, and in 2000 it became a Really Useful Theatre when Andrew Lloyd Webber's Really Useful Group and Bridgepoint Capital purchased Stoll Moss Theatres Ltd. In October 2005, Nica Burns and Max Weitzenhoffer purchased the Garrick Theatre, and it became one of five playhouses operating under their company name of Nimax Theatres Ltd, alongside the Lyric Theatre, Apollo Theatre, Vaudeville Theatre and Duchess Theatre.

He belonged to the monastic society of St Philip Neri, and was a zealous member of the literary association known as the Academy of Arcadians, in connexion with which he adopted the pseudonym of C√¢ndido Lusitano. He contributed much to the improvement of the style of Portuguese prose literature, but his endeavour to effect a reformation in the national poetry by a translation of Horace's Ars poetica was less successful. The work in which he set forth his opinions regarding the vicious taste pervading the current Portuguese prose literature is entitled Maximas sabre a Arte Oratoria (1745) and is preceded by a chronological table forming almost a social and physical history of Portugal. His best known work, however, is his Vida do Infante D. Henrique (1758), which has given him a place in the first rank of Portuguese historians, and has been translated into French (Paris, 1781). He also wrote a poetical dictionary (Diccionario poetico) and a translation of Racine's Athalie (1762), and his Reflexions sur la langue portugaise was published in 1842 by the Lisbon society for the promotion of useful knowledge.

It is four miles from Dromore and two miles from Dromara. The village has a shop, Post Office, Day Care center, Fair Hill Primary school and Nursery Unit, and an Orange Hall. Also First Dromara Presbyterian Church is located just beyond the townland boundary.  Education  There is one school in the village, Fair Hill Primary School and Nursery Unit (formerly Kinallen Primary School). The local secondary school students often attend Friends' School or Wallace High in Lisburn, Banbridge Academy or Dromore High School. Transport and communications The village surrounds a crossroads, where the Banbridge-Dromara and Lisburn-Katesbridge roads meet. In recent years, the village has seen much development, from only 300 residents in 1991 to 557 residents in 2001. This is mainly due to attractive house prices in the rural zones of Belfast's commuter belt, helped by Kinallen's desirable position in the countryside and its nearness to both the A1 dual-carriageway and the M1 motorway. The village's recent popularity as a place to live has turned the area into a dormitory settlement for both Belfast and Lisburn. Despite the growth in population, and the resulting increase in traffic, there has been little done to improve the area's infrastructure. The roads leading from the A1 Belfast-Dublin dual-carriageway are of low quality. The 'Kinallen Road' section of the route, itself unclassified, is very narrow in places and has dangerous bends and junctions. The village is served by Translink Ulsterbus bus service 26, which runs between Dromara and Lisburn through Kinallen, Drumlough and Annahilt. At peak times, the service extends to the Europa Bus Centre in Belfast city centre. Kinallen's official telephone dialling code, like the rest of Northern Ireland is 028. Kinallen lies within the Dromara telephone exchange area, meaning local numbers commence with 9753xxxx. Until the 2000 Big Number Change, the village constituted part of the 01238 area code (Saintfield/Ballynahinch/Dromara). Culture The village boasts a flute band who meet in the local Orange Hall, holding weekly band practice between 8:00pm‚Äì10:00pm every Wednesday evening. The band was formed in 1837 making it one of the oldest such bands in Northern Ireland and takes part in more than fifty parades during the summer marching season, travelling all over Northern Ireland and Scotland. The band holds a yearly parade in nearby Dromore on the last Friday in May.  2001 Census  Kinallen is classified as a small village or hamlet by the NI Statistics and Research Agency (NISRA) (i.e. with population between 500 and 1,000 people). On Census day (29 April 2001) there were 557 people living in Kinallen. Of these: *29.5% were aged under 16 years and 7.9% were aged 60 and over *50.6% of the population were male and 49.4% were female *6.3% were from a Catholic background and 89.2% were from a Protestant background *1% are from African descent *1.3% of people aged 16‚Äì74 were unemployed.

Located on Charing Cross Road in the City of Westminster, it was designed c.1898 by W. G. R. Sprague, the architect of six other London theatres between then and 1916. It was designed to seat 759 patrons on three levels; later refurbishment increased this to four seating levels. The theatre was Grade II* listed by English Heritage in September 1960. History Wyndham had always dreamed of building a theatre of his own, and through the admiration of a patron and the financial confidence of friends, he was able to realise his dream. Wyndham's Theatre opened on 16 November 1899, in the presence of the Prince of Wales. The first play performed there was a revival of T. W. Robertson's David Garrick. A number of successes followed, including Lena Ashwell playing the lead role in Mrs Dane's Defence in 1900, upon which Wyndham said that ‚Äúthe applause when the curtain fell was the most tremendous he had ever known‚Äù. In 1910, Gerald du Maurier began an association with the theatre which lasted 15 years and to include the stage debut of the screen actress Tallulah Bankhead. Du Maurier's small daughter, Daphne, often watched her father's performance from the wings. Thirty years later she presented her own play, The Years Between, on the same stage. In 1917 J. M. Barrie's Dear Brutus ran for more than 360 performances at Wyndham's. The same play was revived in 1922 for another lengthy run. In April 1953 the theatre premiered Graham Greene's first play, The Living Room, with a cast including Dorothy Tutin. In January 1954, a small-scale musical pastiche, Sandy Wilson's The Boy Friend, which had premiered at the much smaller Players' Theatre, was moved to the Wyndham stage. It ran for 2,078 performances, before eventually transferring to Broadway. During the 60s and early 70s, the theatre continued to provide a setting for stars such as Alec Guinness (Wise Child), Vanessa Redgrave and Diana Rigg. The blockbuster of the 1970s decade ‚Äì Godspell ‚Äì opened at Wyndham's in January 1972 and ran to October 1974. The original cast included David Essex, Marti Webb and Jeremy Irons. Wyndham's Theatre just before its opening on 16 November 1900. Among more recent distinguished productions were the world premiere of The Ride Down Mt. Morgan by American playwright Arthur Miller and the British premiere of Edward Albee's Three Tall Women, starring Maggie Smith. Twenty-five years after making her debut there, Diana Rigg returned to play a hugely successful season as Medea. The critically acclaimed comedy, Art, by Yasmina Reza, began its record-breaking run at Wyndham's in 1996 with Albert Finney, Tom Courtenay and Ken Stott in the cast. It opened in October 1996, and transferred to the Whitehall Theatre in October 2001. Madonna made her West End debut there in 2002, performing in a sell-out production of Up For Grabs. This was followed by many other dramatic productions, including Dinner and the National Theatre's Democracy during 2004, Holly Hunter in By The Bog Of Cats, American TV star Ruby Wax in a children's stage version of The Witches, which ran during March 2005; followed by a controversial limited season of Eve Ensler's The Vagina Monologues, which ran without the stars ‚Äì Sharon Osbourne and her daughter Aimee, who dropped out the night before the production opened. Since then, theatre patrons have seen Sienna Miller star alongside Helen McCrory, Reece Shearsmith and Clive Rowe in a new production of Shakespeare's As You Like It. A large-scale replica of the facade of the theatre was constructed at the Universal Studios theme park in Orlando, Florida as part of the park's London-themed area. Delfont Mackintosh era In May 2005, the theatre was taken over by Cameron Mackintosh's Delfont-Mackintosh Ltd., which began operations of the venue in September 2005. In October 2005 the theatre presented Tom Stoppard's Heroes, a translation of the French play Le vent des peupliers by G√©rald Sibleyras, which starred Richard Griffiths and John Hurt.Aleks Sierz, \\"Sir Tom in the doghouse\\", The Telegraph, 10 October 2005. Retrieved 2012-12-15. The following year the theatre hosted a new production of Joanna Murray-Smith's play Honour starring Diana Rigg, Martin Jarvis and Natascha McElhone, which ran between 7 February and 6 May 2006. It later hosted the West End transfer of the Menier Chocolate Factory's hit production of Stephen Sondheim's musical Sunday in the Park with George, which starred Daniel Evans and Jenna Russell and ran till September. Between December 2006 and April 2007, the theatre presented the West End commercial transfer of Alan Bennett's National Theatre hit The History Boys which played to sell-out houses during its run until April 2007. Bill Kenwright's production of Somerset Maugham's The Letter played through summer 2007. There was a short hiatus after Chita Rivera was forced to postpone a scheduled London return. Shadowlands, based on the life story of C. S. Lewis opened in October 2007, starring Charles Dance and Janie Dee, before another return of Alan Bennett's The History Boys from December 2007. The theatre closed temporarily for refurbishment works, before reopening in September 2008 with Kenneth Branagh starring in Michael Grandage's production of Chekhov's Ivanov. This new version by Tom Stoppard was the opening play in the Donmar West End twelve- month season at Wyndham's, with tickets at Donmar Warehouse prices. The Donmar West End season also included Derek Jacobi starring in Twelfth Night, Judi Dench in Yukio Mishima's Madame de Sade, and Jude Law in Hamlet, all staged by Grandage.

It is the national sport of Argentina since 1953. ' is Spanish for \\"duck\\", as early games used a live duck inside a basket instead of a ball. Accounts of early versions of pato have been written since 1610. The playing field would often stretch the distance between neighboring ' (ranches). The first team to reach its own ' (ranch house) with the duck would be declared the winner. ' was banned several times during its history because of the violence--not only to the duck; many gauchos were trampled underfoot, and many more lost their lives in knife fights started in the heat of the game. In 1796, a Catholic priest insisted that ' players who died in such a way should be denied Christian burial. Government ordinances forbidding the practice of ' were common throughout the 19th century. During the 1930s, ' was regulated through the efforts of ranch owner Alberto del Castillo Posse, who drafted a set of rules inspired by modern polo. The game gained legitimacy, to the point that President Juan Per√≥n declared ' to be Argentina's national game in 1953. In modern ', two four-member teams riding on horses fight for possession of a ball which has six conveniently-sized handles, and score by throwing the ball through a vertically positioned ring (as opposed to the horizontal rim used in basketball). The rings have a 100 cm (3.3 ft) diameter, and are located atop 240 cm (7.9 ft) high poles. A closed net, extending for 140 cm (4.6 ft), holds the ball after goals are scored. The winner is the team with most goals scored after regulation time (six 8-minute \\"periods\\"). The dimensions of the field are: length 180 to 220 m (196.9 to 240.6 yd), width 80 to 90 m (87 to 98 yd). The ball is made of leather, with an inflated rubber chamber and six leather handles. Its diameter is 40 cm (15.7 in) handle-to-handle and its weight is 1050 to 1250 g (2.3 to 2.8 lbs). The player that has control of the ' (i.e. holds the ball by a handle) must ride with his right arm outstretched, offering the ' so rival players have a chance of tugging the ' and stealing it. Not extending the arm while riding with the ' is an offense called ' (refusal). During the tug itself, or ', both players must stand on the stirrups and avoid sitting on the saddle, while the hand not involved in the tugging must hold the reins. The tug is usually the most exciting part of the game. ' is played competitively and also by amateurs, mostly in weekend fairs which usually include ' (Argentine rodeo). Its status as the national game of Argentina has been challenged by association football, which is much more widespread. While virtually the entire population of the country are avid football fans and players, it is estimated that 90% of Argentines have not seen a ' match, and there are only a few thousand players of the game. In light of this, a bill was introduced in the Argentine legislature in 2010 to elevate football to the status of national sport and reduce ' to a traditional sport.

It is dedicated to Vishnu, who is worshipped there as Varaha Narasimha. As per the temple's legend, Vishnu manifested in this form (lion's head and human body) after saving his devotee Prahlada from a murder attempt by the latter's father Hiranyakashipu. Except on Akshaya Trutiya, the idol of Varaha Narasimha is covered with sandalwood paste throughout the year, which makes it resemble a linga. Simhachalam is one of the 32 Narasimha temples in Andhra Pradesh which are important pilgrimage centres. It was regarded as an important centre of Vaishnavism in the medieval period along with Srikurmam and others. The earliest inscription at the temple belongs to 11th-century CE recording the gift by a private individual in the era of Chalukya Chola king Kulottunga I. In the later half of the 13th century, the temple complex underwent radical physical changes during the reign of the Eastern Ganga king Narasimhadeva I. Narahari Tirtha, a Dvaita philosopher and Eastern Ganga minister converted the Simhachalam temple into an educational establishment of renown and a religious centre for Vaishnavism. It later received patronage from many royal families, of which Tuluva dynasty of Vijayanagara Empire is a notable one. The temple underwent 40 years of religious inactivity from 1564 to 1604 CE. In 1949, the temple came under the purview of the state government and is currently administered by the Simhachalam Devasthanam Board. Simhachalam temple resembles a fortress from outside with three outer courtyards and five gateways. The architecture is a mixture of the styles of the Kalinga Architecture, Chalukyas, and the Cholas. The temple faces west instead of east, signifying victory. There are two temple tanks: Swami Pushkarini near the temple and Gangadhara at the bottom of the hill. The temple houses a number of sub-shrines and a few mandapams. The religious practices and customs of the temple are formulated by the Vaishnavite philosopher Ramanuja. They are modelled based on the Satvata Samhita, one of the 108 texts of the Pancharatra Agama. Simhachalam is the second-largest temple, after Tirumala in Andhra Pradesh, in terms of income earned. Devotees believe that the deity is capable of giving progeny to women and fulfilling the wishes of devotees. Kalyanotsava and Chandanotsava are the two major festivals celebrated in the temple, followed by Narasimha Jayanti, Navaratrotsava and Kamadahana. The festivals celebrated in Simhachalam have an influence of the Dravida Sampradaya. Apart from those by well-known poets, the temple is found in many literary references and lyrical works (dedicated by anonymous writers), which are preserved in the Government Oriental Manuscripts Library, Chennai.  Legends associated with the temple  The Sthala Purana (local legend) of Simhachalam consists of 32 chapters; the number denotes the manifestations of Narasimha. According to Dr. V. C. Krishnamacharyulu, the legends of Simhachalam and other Hindu temples in Andhra Pradesh were written in the 14th century after the attempted establishment of Islam in the region. He added that the writers wrote the legends inspired from the stories of Narasimha available in the Hindu puranas. Hence, Vishnu Purana and Bhagavata Purana form the major sources. However, the legend of Simhachalam provides new information about the previous life of the temple's founder Prahlada. The first four chapters of the legend cover the importance of Simhachalam, its deity and the principal water body Gangadhara. = Origins of the temple = Chamba painting showing the slaying of the demon Hiranyaksha by lord Vishnu as Varaha with four hands. Varaha is also shown balancing the earth on his tusks.alt=A blue skinned four armed Human with a boar's head decapitates a demon with a sword besides balancing a piece of land on the tusks. Once, the Four Kumaras visited lord Vishnu abode Vaikuntha as children. Jaya-Vijaya, the demigod gatekeepers of Vaikuntha, failed to recognise them and denied their entry. In resentment, they cursed the duo stating that they would have to give up divinity, born and live the lives of mortal beings on earth. Vishnu failed to revoke the curse of the Kumaras and felt sorry. He later offered two solutions: either being Vishnu's devotees in seven human lives or his enemies in three demonic lives. Jaya-Vijaya could not bear separation with Vishnu for a long time and chose the second possibility. In their first demonic lives, Jaya-Vijaya were born as Hiranyakashipu and Hiranyaksha to sage Kashyapa and Diti in an inauspicious time during a sunset. To tease lord Brahma and other gods, Hiranyaksha ensured that earth loses its vitality and sinks into the rasatala, the lowest level in the cosmic universe. Vishnu assumed the form of a boar referred to as Varaha and restored earth to its normal position. Varaha later killed Hiranyaksha in a war that lasted for thousand years. Hiranyakashipu vowed to seek revenge and prayed to Brahma. He gained a boon which made him invulnerable to death either by day or night, either in the morning or the night, and either by a human or a beast. When the gods headed by Brahma visited Vaikuntham to tell an account of the happenings to Vishnu, a guardian named Sumukha obstructed them. They manage to meet Vishnu and also convey the misbehaviour of Sumukha. Vishnu assured that Hiranyakashipu shall be killed and Sumukha would be the serving cause. Sumukha pleaded for a pardon but Vishnu denied, saying that an offence against his devotees is inexcusable. As per Vishnu's orders, Sumukha was born as Hiranyakashipu's son Prahlada. Prahlada displayed staunch devotion towards Vishnu in his childhood. As a result, he had to face many death trails. In one such instance, Hiranyakashipu's soldiers threw him from the top of a hill and placed the mountain on him. Vishnu jumped over the hill and lifted Prahlada from the sea. Prahlada asked Vishnu to assume a deity form where the avatars of Varaha, who killed Hiranyaksha and Narasimha, the one who would kill Hiranyakashipu soon, can be seen together. Vishnu assumed the form of Varaha Narasimha, for whom Prahlada built a temple after Hiranyakashipu's death. Worship was conducted and the place was named Simhachalam (lion's hill). This is covered from 5th to 29th chapters of the legend. = Reconstruction by Pururava = At the end of the life cycle, the temple Prahlada built was neglected and subsequently decayed. The moolavar of Varaha Narasimha was covered with crests of earth. In another life cycle, king Pururava of lunar dynasty acquired Pushpaka Vimana (divine air car) from Brahma as a boon. He saw Urvasi, an apsara at the Kailasa mountain and both fell in love. They visited Simhachalam and settled here for a while. Urvasi recollected a dream and located the idol. Pururava performed penance at Gangadhara for the same. They unearthed the idol and consecrated it after renovation. Despite his best efforts, Pururava could not find the idol's feet. A divine voice consoled him, saying that he need not worry about that, adding that the deity can provide salvation in its current form. Urvasi was instructed in the dream that the idol of Varaha Narasimha should be covered with sandalwood paste for the whole year except on the third day of the Vaisakha month. This custom is practiced strictly even today. The reconstruction of the temple by Pururava is covered in the last four chapters of the legend. = Ramanuja's visit = Srirangam Ranganathaswamy temple.alt=An idol made of black stone dressed in orange robes, with a flag in a hand and Thirunamam on the forehead, throat, chest and hands. In the 11th century AD, after winning a debate at the Puri Jagannath temple, Vaishnavite saint and philosopher Ramanuja visited Srikurmam and Simhachalam temples. Simhachalam's deity was believed to be Shiva due to some reasons. The notable ones were the unusual position of the deity's idol, the gate at the lower terrain named Bhairava Dwaram, and the second temple tank being referred to with the name Gangadhara. The annual celebration of Kamadahana, a tradition usually observed in Shiva's temples, was practiced here which added strength to the beliefs. Ramanuja argued that the idol of Varaha Narasimha is in a posture in accordance with the Pancharatra Agama rules. He added that Kamadahana is celebrated here for the temple's purification as per the Sishtachara traditions. Ramanuja pointed out that Shiva's manifestation Bhairava is neither the guardian of the Bhairava Dwaram nor worshipped as one. Ramanuja was able to defeat the scholars at Simhachalam and converted it into a Vaishnavite temple. Varaha Narasimha's idol, when covered with sandalwood paste, resembles a Shiva Lingam. Ramanuja took personal possession of the temple and ordered the priests to remove the paste. The conversion work began and before completion, the idol started bleeding. Feeling the deity's anger for violating the rule, sandalwood paste was applied again which stopped the blood stream. They presumed that the deity wished to look like a Lingam and continued the tradition except for one day. Few Vaishnavites oppose this legend, calling it a deliberate attempt to \\"debase the prestige of Vaishnava shrines in general\\" and of Ramanuja in particular. = Krishnamacharyulu's curse = Sri Kantha Krishnamacharyulu was a poet and musician who composed sankeertanas in praise of Varaha Narasimha. As Narasimha danced listening to those songs, Krishnamacharyulu began showing offensive attitude towards others with arrogance. When Ramanuja visited Simhachalam later, Krishnamacharyulu did not treat him properly. Ramanuja wanted to know whether Vishnu would grant him salvation and requested Krishnamacharyulu to ask Narasimha about the same. He obeyed and asked Narasimha, to which the deity replied that Ramanuja is capable of giving salvation to others and hence can gain the same later. Krishnamacharyulu requested Narasimha to grant him salvation. To teach him a lesson, Narasimha refused, saying that Ramanuja is the only one capable one to do so. Krishnamacharyulu was offended and cursed that the temple would be attacked in the upcoming days. It is believed that the attack on the temple in the 18th century by Muslim invaders was a result of the curse. Though this legend is considered imaginary, it is respected widely for emphasising the importance of teachers and spiritual masters over the divine.  History  alt=An inscription written on a black slab in Telugu language. Simhachalam temple has a past of nearly a thousand years. Epigraphists discovered nearly 500 inscriptions in the temple complex. Almost all of them were dana sasanas (donation records) which referred to the contributions made by the kings, their officers, and the citizens. Majority of the inscriptions are bilingual, written in Sanskrit and Telugu languages. While some are exclusively in Sanskrit, there are 46 Odia and three Tamil language inscriptions. As per the common acceptance of historians, Simhachalam temple has been recognised in the 11th century CE due to an inscription by the Chalukya Chola king Kulottunga I. The earliest inscription discovered in the temple, it belonged to the 11th century and was dated to 1087 CE. It recorded the gift of a garden by a private individual. The temple functioned well during this period and received liberal patronage from the Chalukya Cholas. After the Chalukya Cholas, the Eastern Ganga dynasty extended their patronage for the promotion and preservation of the temple complex. Their inscriptions ranges from 1150 AD to 1430 CE. In the later half of the 13th century, the temple complex underwent radical physical changes during the reign of Narasimhadeva I. Many additional architectural adjuncts were added to the temple which had a simple and modest look. An inscription dated 1293 CE refers to the addition of sub shrines by the Gangas in the temple, which were dedicated to manifestations of Vishnu: Vaikunthanatha, Yagnavaraha, and Madhavadevara. The renovators used the original slabs as much as possible and discarded a few of them. The removed ones were later used in the kitchen and other small shrines. The feudatory chiefs of the Ganga dynasty too contributed towards the temple's architecture and made donations in various forms. Four inscriptions of the temple recorded the donation of land, jewels, and villages by the kings of the Reddy dynasty, who did some substantial service to the temple. After the fall of the Eastern Gangas, the Gajapathis came into power. Nine inscriptions written in Odia language recorded the contributions by Kapilendradeva, Purushottama Deva and Prataprudra Deva. The temple received support from the Tuluva dynasty of the Vijayanagara Empire. Their inscriptions range from 1516 to 1519 CE. During his military campaigns at the Kalinga region, Krishnadevaraya erected a Jayastambha (pillar of victory) at Simhachalam. He gifted ornaments to the deity for the merit of his parents. His wives Tirumala Devi and Chinnamma Devi also gifted ornaments. The Tuluva kings supported the perpetuation of the property of Simhachalam up to 16th century CE. After the fall of the Vijayanagara Empire, the Muslim states of Deccan asserted independence. The Qutb Shahi dynasty began its rule with Golkonda as their capital. A solitary inscription dated 1604 CE records gifting the lands and resources of Narava village as a sarvamanya by Sarvappa Asraraya with a view to restore the regular religious practices and offerings. Apart from mentioning the military achievements of Asraraya, the inscription confirmed 40 years of religious inactivity from 1564 to 1604 CE. In these 40 years, two inscriptions were found dated 1579 and 1597 CE; they registered the gifts donated to the temple. Apart from the above, 300 inscriptions in between the 11th and 18th centuries make a note of the contributions made by private individuals. The latest inscription of the temple is dated 1798 CE, which recorded a gift made by Chengalvaraya of the Gode family. In 1949, the temple came under the purview of the endowment ministry of the State Government. The members of the Pusapati Gajapathi family of the princely state of Vizianagaram are the current hereditary trustees of the temple. The members of the family are serving the temple for the last three centuries.  The temple  = Geography = Simhachalam locality from hill top alt=A view of a pond with a hall like structure built in the middle, surrounded by green trees and the hills in the background. The temple is situated on Simhachalam Hill Range above the sea level at a distance of ten miles to the north of Visakhapatnam. The hill range is a part of the Eastern Ghats and is named Kailasa. It is situated on the top of the northern side of the hill in an amphitheatre like structure. The height of the temple is nearly above the sea level. A natural valley is seen running along the north western slope of the hill, which covers almost half of its height. The hill range, cut into terraces, was used later to cultivate large plantations of pineapple, jack fruit, and Banana. A small village grew around the temple in due course of time. Steps were built alongside the stream of water to serve as a way of approach to both the village and the temple. Due to the soil nature, rainfall and the climatic conditions influenced by the sea level, the growth of flora is abundant on the hill range. The hills also contain medical herbs used to cure the diseases of both humans and cattle. There are various ways to reach the temple. The most popular one is the flight of one thousand steps from the foot of hill whose entrance is referred to as the Bhairava Dwaram. On one side, a pathway runs from Madhava Dwaram to the top. On the other side, at the foot of the hill, roads were laid starting from the Bhairava Dwaram to the top. Simhachalam has two temple tanks: the Swami Pushkarini at the top and Gangadhara at the bottom, which is referred to as the Varaha Pushkarini. They are similar to the ones found in the Tirumala Venkateswara Temple. In addition, there are three natural springs named Akashadhara, Chakradhara, and Madhavadhara. At the foot of the hill, two gardens are available where festivals are celebrated. = Architecture = alt=A far view of a temple complex with its gate, the sanctum, the gateway towers and a small garden being viewed. Simhachalam temple resembles a fortress from outside with three prakarams (outer courtyards) and five gateways. Majority of the temple's present form is the one rebuilt by Narasimhadeva I. Its architecture is a mixture of the styles of the Orissan, Chalukyas and the Cholas. It faces west, an unusual case in the usual tradition of temple architecture. It is believed that the temple initially faced east, but was changed to west due to inexplicable reasons. As per the Hindu texts Purushottama Samhita and the Vishnu Samhita, a temple facing west signifies victory unlike the east ones which denotes prosperity. It is believed that the Gangadhara's flow from the east to the west might be a reason why the temple faces west. A prakaram covers the entire temple with two gateways on the northern and western sides. The temple has a five-tier rajagopuram (main tower) on the western gateway. Devotees enter the temple through a side door with a stairway, which leads into the Kalyana mandapa (wedding hall), which has 96 pillars. It has coloumns and walls on which the images of Vishnu, his consort Lakshmi and the Azhwars are carved. Near the entrance, the foot prints of Hindu saint Chaitanya Mahaprabhu installed by Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati in the year 1930 can be seen. At the end, a gateway leads to the main hall. Before the sanctum sanctorum, an altar with the images of Radha and Krishna can be seen. alt=A three-tier pyramid like structure with a golden dome on its top. The sanctum sanctorum of the temple is cubical- shaped whose walls feature sculptures carved in Hoysala style. The three-tier vimana, similar to that of the Konark temple, is shaped like a stepped pyramid with proper carving of sculptures. The corners of the base of the vimana bear lion statuettes symbolising Narasimha. On the eastern face of the vimana, images of Indra and Gajalakshmi are found. A gold plated dome with a Vaishnavite symbol caps the vimana. On the southern wall of the sanctorum, a sculpture of Narasimha killing Hiranyakashipu in Prahlada's presence is present. Narasimha is seen in a standing posture, a unique feature of the temple's architecture. The fore arms lay on Hiranyakashipu whose is kept on the left thigh, and the rear arms hold a weapon and a conch. On the northern wall, a sculpture of Varaha is seen, which is similar to the ones found in the Belur Chennakeshava and Hoysaleswara temples. Krishna's images are found above these two sculptures. The southern wall depicts a scene of Kalinga Marthana and the northern wall has an image of Krishna lifting the Govardhan Hill. In the north western corner of the temple, there are two halls named Vaisakha and Jyestha mandapas where special occasions are conducted. To the right of the northern entrance, there is a 16-pillared Natya mandapa (dance hall) where the pillars feature simhalalathas (lion heads) at their base. The temple has two jagattis (railed parapets). The outer jagatti around the artha mandapa carries a row of sculpted elephants denoting strength. The inner one, around the sanctum sanctorum contains a row of swans. Above this, a scrollwork with sculpted figures and a row of simhalalatas are found. On the supporting pillars, simhalalatas are seen on elephant sculptures, with convolution carrying figures in between. The eaves of the sidewalls feature stone-made filigree work. A study of the sculptures and pillars in the Kalyana mandapa revealed that basalt and schist were used in the construction. The thirty two manifestations of Narasimha, including the temple's deity, are carved on the pillars of the Kalyana mandapa. In the Mukha mandapa (main hall), there is a pillar named Kappam Stambham which is believed to have curative powers. It is consecrated using the Santana Venugopalaswamy Yantra and is known to grant unfulfilled wishes. = Shrines = alt=A three-tier yellow coloured pyramid like structure with sculptures and carvings to the left and a five tier tower to the right. The moolavar of Varaha Narasimha is kept in a separate hall named Prahlada mandapa. In its original form, the idol of Varaha Narasimha is two and a half feet tall. The deity stands in a tribhanga posture with a boar's head, a human torso and a lion's tail. On either side of the deity, the idols of Sridevi and Bhudevi holding lotus flowers are seen. The sculpture of Varaha Narasimha has no ornaments and drapery carved on the body. Its limbs and face are disfigured due to vandalism. The moolavar is covered with sandalwood paste imported from Srivilliputhur, Tamil Nadu. After application of the sandalwood paste, the moolavar resembles a four feet tall Shiva Lingam. There is enough space for the devotees to offer pradakshinas (circumambulations) to the deity inside the Prahlada mandapa. There are only four main ornaments used in the temple: a Thirunamam made of diamonds and rubies, a chain of emeralds, a 100-tola gold bracelet, and a golden crown. A number of sub shrines are housed inside the temple complex. Two of them are dedicated to Andal, one of the 12 Azhwars and Lakshmi, the consort of the principal deity. The latter is housed in a small room located near the north western wall; it served as a cell of the temple's treasury in the past. Lakshmi is referred to as Simhavalli Thayar, and her idol is in a lotus position with four hands. The fore arms display abhayamudra and varadamudra, and the rear arms hold a pair of lotus flowers. The remaining eleven Azhwars are accommodated in separate rooms. Sub-temples are dedicated to Ramanuja, Manavala Mamunigal and Vishvaksena inside the main complex. Shiva's manifestation Tripurantaka is the kshetrapala (guardian deity) of Simhachalam. The guardian deity is identified with Bhairava, a fierce manifestation of Bhairava. Tripurantaka and his consort have a temple dedicated to them which is located on the way to Gangadhara. It is one of the oldest South Indian temples dedicated to this deity. Bhairava was believed to be more fierce than Narasimha and hence, the devotees used to visit this temple first in the past to pacify him. The idol does not have any clothing and ornamentation in accordance to the legend, which terms Bhairava the god of seasons. Due to its obscure location and insufficient funds, the temple is currently in a dilapidated state. The other prominent sub-temples are the ones dedicated to Rama, Anjaneya, and Kasi Vishweswara, a form of Shiva. These temples are located near Gangadhara. = Administration and staff = The staff of the temple is divided into three groups: the ones involved in religious duties, those who help in preparations for worship, and the administration and supervision related personnel. The Parikshagar and the Sthanapati (or Sthanacharya) were the biggest dignitaries of the temple. These two posts were held by the family members of the Tirumala Peddinti family. At a later point, due to reluctance of the family members, the office of the Sthanapati was merged with that of the Parikshagar. The main duty of a Parikshagar was to ensure that all the daily and special rituals were being conducted in accordance with the injunctions of the past. On the other hand, the Sthanapati used to initiate every proceeding on the temple and served as the representative of the trustees. At present, the temple is maintained and administered by the Simhachalam Devasthanam board, which is under the purview of the Government of Andhra Pradesh. The priests of the temple are divided into three main groups: Archakas, Nambyas, and Paricharakas. The priests belong to the Sri Vaishnavite clan. These priests were classified into three groups: the local Vaishnavites, Tirupathi Vaishnavites (hailing from Tirumala), and Ekaki Vaishnavites (those who are unmarried and practice celibacy). Archakas look after the actual conduct of rituals in the main temple, of whom one is the head priest. Equivalent to Sthanacharya, the head priest has the additional responsibility of decorating the deity with ornaments on important occasions. The priests of the sub-temples and shrines are called Nambyas or Samardhaka Brahmins. Paricharakas assist the archakas by performing tasks such as cleaning vessels required for rituals, bringing water to the kitchen, and collecting items required for the prayer. Scholars are appointed by the temple to read various religious texts. One of them referred to as the Bhagavata Vishyam Pandit, along with six adhyapakas (teachers) recite the Dravida Prabandha text daily. These people belong to the Vaishnavite families of Simhachalam. Scholars who read out chapters from the Mahabharata, the Ramayana and the Bhagavata Purana are known as Parayandars (Parayana reading pandits). Apart from these, vedic scholars are also appointed for regular recital of the Rigveda, Samaveda, and Yajurveda. In the medieval period, a group of sanis or devadasis used to perform four important tasks: performing dance and music, singing mangalagitas and namasankirtanas, waving fly-whisks to the deity, and cleaning and decorating the temple's premises. They were looked upon with respect as the temple's dancers. Women were either gifted as sanis or voluntarily dedicated themselves for the same. They either remained unmarried (referred to as the sampradaya sanis) or had an independent marital life, working in the temple on a part-time basis. At present, the temple does not encourage the presence of such dancers. Cooks hailing from Vaishnavite families and well-versed in the Agni mantra were employed to prepare the bhoga (offerings) to the deity. Other important personnel include water carriers, gardeners, potters, fuel suppliers, goldsmiths, flag bearers, torch bearers, watchmen, repairers and renovators, and cattle maintainers.  Religious practices  alt=A man with 16 hands and two cross legs standing inside a circle and holding different weapons with his hands. The religious practices and customs of the temple are formulated by Ramanuja and his followers like Anandalvan. They are similar to the ones followed in South Indian Vaishnavite temples such as Tirumala, Srirangam, and the Varadharaja Perumal Temple in Kanchipuram. The prayers are made as per the Para, Vyuha, Vibhava, Antaryami, and Archa traditions of Vishnu. The religious practices are modelled based on the Satvata Samhita, one of the 108 texts of the Pancharatra Agama. There are five metallic idols associated with the deity which serve as the substitute of the moolavar for certain practices. Yogananda Narasimha is the snapana bera (bathing idol), Govindaraja is the utsava bera (festival idol), and Sudarshana Chakra is the bali bera (guardian idol). Madanagopala and Venugopala, two forms of Krishna, are the kautuka bera (representative idol) and the sayana bera (sleeping idol) respectively. The deity worship commences in the morning around 5:30 AM. The inner gates of the temple are opened and the Vayu mantra is recited. The priests chant the Suprabhatam for about an hour and half as a prelude to the regular worship activities. It is accompanied by people playing nadaswaram (pipe instrument). The laghvarchana (preliminary worship) is performed; priests offer jaggery and coconut after which the mangala harathi (incense) is provided to the deity. Devotees are allowed to visit the sanctum sanctorum from 6:30 AM for the next five hours. The actual worship continues up to 8:00 AM which consists of shodasha upachara (sixteen services). Abhisheka (anointment) is performed to the Yogananda Narasimha idol. The last phase of the morning worship is the Baliharana (pacification ceremony), where a portion of the consecrated food is offered to the spirits. Sudarshana Chakra idol is used in this phase. The morning rituals in the sub-temples follow a similar pattern, with the preliminary worship and offerings provided in each temple in succession. After 11:00 AM, the temple's mid day worship begins. After half an hour, rajabhoga (main offering) is offered to the deity. The pilgrims are not allowed to visit the sanctum for the next half an hour. Rajabhoga consists of cooked rice, dal, soup, cooked vegetables, ghee and curd. Another half an hour break is given to the deity at 2:30 PM. Devotees are then allowed to visit the sanctum up to 7:00 PM. In the evening worship, which begins at 6:00 PM, begins with the Divviti Salam (salute with torches) ceremony. Two men go round the temple; one holds a torch and the other plays a drum. The rituals offered in the evening are similar to that of the morning worship. The importance given to music is the major deviation. Night offering is provided to the deity. Devotees are allowed to have a glimpse of the deity for half an hour from 8:30 PM. At 9:00 PM, sayana seva (sleeping ritual) is performed and the temple is closed. Devotees can take part in two special rituals that are conducted in the temple. One is the Nithya kalyanam (regular marriage) of the deity which is conducted everyday. The other one is the Swarnapushpa archana (worship with golden flowers). It is conducted along with the morning worship rituals on every Thursday. Other notable rituals of similar nature are the Sahasranama archana (recital of thousand names), Garuda seva, and cow worship to name a few.  Festivals  Majority of the donations made to the Simhachalam temple are related to the conduction of festivals. The festivals are referred to with the name utsavas. Except for Kumara Punnami, almost all the utsavas are celebrated even today. The utsavas are divided into two categories: those governed by the Agama texts and the ones regulated by the customs and traditions (sishtachara). The performances and festivals are also classified into daily, weekly, fortnightly, monthly, and annual ones. These are meant for the material and spiritual progress of humans apart from their yogakshema (well being). The festivals celebrated in Simhachalam have an influence of the Dravida Sampradaya, the customs followed in Tamil Nadu. The influence is observed in the way the deities are referred to as, and the usage of the word 'Thiru' for few things connected with the temple and its practices. Also, the celebrations take place at a time governed by the Suryamaana (sun-centric) system followed in Tamil Nadu, unlike that of Andhra Pradesh which follows Chaandramaana (lunar-centric) system. Kalyanotsava (celestial marriage) and Chandanotsava (sandalwood festival) are the two most important annual utsavas celebrated in the temple among others. = Important festivals =  Kalyanotsava  alt=The metal idol of a man decorated with jewellery and flower garlands on whose thigh a woman is seated. Kalyanotsava, the annual celestial marriage of Varaha Narasimha, is celebrated on the 11th day of the first quarter of the Indian lunar Chaitra month. This utsava is celebrated for five days. This utsava is not mentioned in any inscriptions of the temple. However, an inscription dated 1401 AD records the gift of a flag staff named the Garudaroha Kamba for celebrating the Divya mahotsavas (sacred key festivals). The gift was made on the fifth day of the bright fortnight of the Chaitra month. For the same reason, Kalyanotsava is considered as the mahotsava of Simhachalam. Also, the principal items used for mahotsavas in other South Indian Hindu temples are utilised for this marriage event. The Kalyanotsava begins with hoisting of the Garudadhwaja (flag of Garuda). Kalyanotsava resembles the weddings seen in Hindu families. The procedure of this utsava consists of the following events in succession: Ankurarpanam (the formal start), Rathotsava (chariot ride festival), Avabhruta snana (purification ceremony), Bhaktotsava (rewarding a devotee), and sayana seva (sleeping ritual). Ankurarpanam happens on the 14th day; Brahma and the eight guardians of the directions are invoked by chanting hymns and sowing nine kinds of seeds in specially-made earthen pots. The priests make the mahasankalpa (great resolve). To mark this, they tie threads made of Kusha grass to their wrists and to those of the deities'. Preliminaries of the Kalyanotsava begin on the nightfall of the 15th day. Baliharana is performed not only in the temple but also extends over the entire village on the hill to appease the deities. Before entering the marriage hall, the deities are taken round the village on a ratha (temple car) pulled by devotees. This event is known as Rathotsava. The deities enter the marriage hall at around 10:00 PM and the marriage of Varaha Narasimha and his consorts is performed. From the 12th day, the daily worship is performed in the usual day. Religious discourses on sacred Hindu texts take place in the morning. In the night, musical, recital and other similar entertainment activities are performed by scholars. The next day, priests invoke the guardians of directions and selected hymns are chanted. Purnahuti (last sacrificial rite) is offered to Agni, the fire god on the last day. After conducting the purification ceremony at Gangadhara, Bhaktotsava is celebrated. Bhaktotsava is celebrated by reciting the legends of Thirumangai (one of the 12 Azhwars) in Telugu language. The Garudadhwaja is unhoisted to signify the end of Kalyanotsava. On the sixth day, the Telugu work Lakshmi Narayana Samvadam, which is about a game of wit between Vishnu and Lakshmi, is read aloud. After its completion, the deities are put to bed by performing sayana seva.  Chandanotsava  Bhadrachalam temple depicting both the original form of the moolavar and the Lingam-like one after applying sandalwood paste.alt=A painting showing a small idol covered with sandalwood paste. Two women are seen standing beside the central figure. Chandanotsava (sandalwood festival), also known as Chandan Yatra, is the most important festival celebrated in the temple. It is celebrated on the festival day of Akshaya Tritiya (April ‚Äì May) in accordance to the temple's legend. On this day, the Sandalwood paste, commonly referred to as Chandanam, covering the moolavar throughout the year is removed. As a result, devotees can see the original form of the deity's idol for 12 hours once in the whole year. Chandanam is applied to the moolavar on four days in a year: on Akshaya Tritiya and full moon days of the Vaisakha, Jyeshta, and Ashadha months. Every time, four manugus of Chandanam is applied. The sandalwood paste that covers the deity is removed early in the morning at 4:00 AM. The prayers and abhisheka are completed by 6:00 AM after which the devotees are allowed to enter the sanctum to see the original form of the deity's idol. The evening ritual begins with a number of bathing services to the moolavar; the prominent ones are Chandanabhisheka (abhisheka with water mixed with sandalwood powder) and Sahasrakalasabhisheka (abhisheka with water from thousand metal pots). All the three food offerings (Balabhoga, Rajabhoga, and night offering) are served to the deity at a time to compensate their omission during the day. This festival was observed elaborately in the ancient days and at least 40 inscriptions record the gifts made by various people on this occasion.  Narasimha Jayanti  alt=A man lion kills a demon by ripping his intestines. Narasimha Jayanti is celebrated on the fourteenth day of the first half of the Vaisakha month (Vaisakha Suddha Chaturdasi). As Vishnu manifested as Narasimha from a pillar in the evening of this day to save Prahlada, the celebrations are held in the twilight. An inscription dated 1287 AD recorded the arrangements made by Raghavanayaka and his grandson for the food offerings to the deity for this day. Another one dated 1356 AD notes a donation of 20 ganda madas on Vaisakha Suddha Chaturdasi for food offerings. The celebrations commence at around 6:00 PM. Most of the rituals carried out in the sanctum are the same as that of an ordinary day. However, the Rajabhoga is served late in the evening. Respite is given after the sacred bath and selected chapters of the temple's legend related to the manifestation of Narasimha are read out. The utsava idol of the deity is placed on a special prepared seat in the assembly hall throughout the event.  Navaratrotsava  The ten day Dussehra festival is celebrated as Navaratrotsava (Festival of nine nights) with Vijayadashami being the last day. These occur in the month of Ashvin and are conducted for the glory of the principal goddess Lakshmi. For the first nine days of the month, special rituals are carried out in Lakshmi's shrine in the temple. The utsava idol of the goddess, referred to as Chaturbhuja Thayar, is taken round the temple and is placed on a seat in the assembly hall. Sri Sukta is read aloud while performing a sacred bath to the deity. This is then followed by Pushpapuja (flower worship) and final offering. On the last day, Shami tree (prosopis cineraria) is worshipped and the deity is taken around the village on the hill. Elephant vehicle is used for the same and it marks the end of the celebrations.  Kamadahana  Kamadahana (Burning of desire) occurs on the full moon day in the month of Phalguna. It is considered as an auxiliary festival (not specified by ancient texts) of the temple. Followers of Sri Vaishnavism consider Kamadahana as a self-purification ceremony; it bears no relation with the legend of Shiva burning Kamadeva to ashes. Dolotsava (swing ritual) is performed as a prelude to Kamadahana on the same day. It is celebrated to mark the death of the demon Holika. The importance given to this festival shows the influence of Orissan culture in Simhachalam. Dolotsava starts in the afternoon as the deity's utsava idol is brought to the garden located at the foot of the hill. The deity is made to occupy a special seat and red powder is sprinkled on him as the priests chant the hymns. This procedure is referred to as Churnotsavam. The deity is then placed on the swing and are moved to and fro in a ceremonial way. The Kamadahana ceremony begins at 8:00 PM at a small hut built near the entrance of the temple. The hut houses the deity as the priests conduct a fire ritual. They offer sacrifices in an elaborate manner to burn every aspect of desire. The hut is then burnt, symbolically representing the annihilation of Kama (desire). This ceremony is one of the important utsavas conducted in the temple. = Other festivals =  Krishna Janmashtami  alt=Five children steal a pot of butter as a woman watches from behind. Krishna Janmashtami is an important utsava in the temple which celebrates the birth of Krishna, the eighth avatar of Vishnu. It occurs on the eighth day of the dark fortnight of Sravana month. An inscription dated 1233 AD records a gift of 100 cows to provide milk to the temple's deity from that year's Janmashtami onwards. The utsava idol of Andal is taken round the temple and then made to occupy an ivory throne. After completing the bathing formalities and prayers, the chapter related to Krishna's birth in Bhagavata Purana is read aloud along with few sections of the Dravida Prabandha. To glorify the pranks Krishna made in his childhood, Utlotsava (basket festival) is celebrated. For the purpose, a basket with a kalasa and a coconut is tied near the precincts of the temple. Young people are challenged to break the basket which keeps eluding them. At the end of the festival, milk offered to the deity is distributed among the devotees. As the temple's practices are influenced by the Dravida Sampradaya, Utlotsava is celebrated a day after Janmashtami. It differs from the tradition of Telugu people, who celebrate Utlotsava as a part of Janmashtami on the same day.  Karthika Deepavali  Karthika Deepavali is a festival of lights celebrated on the full moon day of Karthika month. On this occasion, an array of innumerable oil lamps are used to decorate the temple. An inscription dated 1270 AD records Chittana Gopala's gift of 50 cows, two akhandadipas (perpetual lamps) and stands supporting them. Another one dated 1278 AD records a gift of 47 cows by Allada Nayaka. Festival begins in the evening. 12 earthen containers with oil and wick are placed on a mandala (zone). Eight of the twelve lamps are dedicated to the guardians of the directions. The remaining four are dedicated to Brahma, Narasimha, Shesha and Garuda. These four lamps are placed at the cardinal points of the temple. In the last phase, a hut made of dried plantain leaves is erected. The utsava idol is taken around the temple and brought to the hut where fire worship takes place. Incense and camphor are offered to the deity and the hut is burnt. Amidst the recital of hymns, the deity is taken round the burning hut thrice and is taken back to the temple. However, there is no epigraphical evidence available in the temple which specifies the way this festival is celebrated.  Giripradakshina  Giripradakshina is an annual festival celebrated on the full moon day of the Ashadha month. It is based on the custom that the devotees can receive Narasimha's blessings by circumambulating around the hill on which he is seated. Devotees, majority of them hailing from the countryside, observe a fast on the day and offer pradakshinas to the hill. They cover a distance of and pay a visit to the sanctum after which they have dinner. Those who cannot afford to walk around the hill offer 108 pradakshinas in the temple. Another similar festival in Simhachalam is Grama pradakshina, where the utsava idol is taken to the villages nearby in a procession. An inscription dated 1242 AD records provision by Purushottama Nayaka for conducting this festival. Grama pradakshina is believed to be based on superstitions; people hoped that the utsava idol's entry would bring prosperity to the village and its inmates.  Minor festivals  alt=A four armed man with weapons rushes to save an elephant from a crocodile as a man-bird watches. The minor festivals of the temple include Vaarotsavas (weekly festivals), Pakshotsavas (fortnightly festivals), Masotsavas (monthly festivals). There are two specific phases in these festivals: the Thiruveedhi festival where the utsava idol is taken on a procession and the performance of the appropriate service to the deity. These festivals also include the ones performed during the Grahanakalas (eclipses), Nakshatrotsavas (star festivals), Sankranthi (selstices) and Vishuvas (equinexes). The Pakshotsavas are held usually on the eleventh day (Ekadashi) of the two fortnights of every month. Many inscriptions have recorded the donations by various people to the temple on the occasion of Ekadashi days. The most important one among the Pakshotsavas is the Jalasayana Ekadashi. It is believed that Vishnu retires to sleep on the serpent bed for four months, starting from that day (the 11th day of the former fortnight of Ashadha) until Uttana Dwadasi (the 12th day of the former fortnight of Karthika). Every month, special festivals are conducted in honour of the deity when one of the few auspicious nakshatras (stars) appear, which are known as Nakshatrotsavas. Vaishnavites consider Mrigashira, Punarvasu, Uttara and Sravana very auspicious among the 27 nakshatras. Sankaramanas, the festivals corresponding to the movement of sun in the heaven, are celebrated in the temple. Makar Sankranti and Karthika Sankranti are the major ones, followed by the relatively minor Vishnu Sankranti. Makaraveta (crocodile hunt) is celebrated a day after Makar Sankranthi. In the temple tank, the scenario of the Hindu legend Gajendra Moksha is recreated with the help of a mock crocodile hunt by the utsava idol. Teppotsavam (floating festival) is celebrated at the end of the Pausha month. In addition, Simhachalam celebrates two annual festivals: Dhanurmasotsava and Adhyayanotsava. Dhanurmasotsava celebrates Andal's attempts to marry Ranganatha, a form of Vishnu. She observed tapas (self disciplined meditation) for 30 days before merging herself with him. Those 30 days are celebrated for the entire month of Margashira by a special ritual at the Andal shrine. In Adhyayanotsava (study festival), the deity is conducted to the assembly hall where he is worshipped for 20 days. The 4000 verses of the Tamil text Naalayira Divya Prabhandham is read aloud along with other sacred texts, which lends the festival its name. This festival is divided into two phases: the first phases lasts for the first ten mornings of the fortnight. The eleventh day, which happens to be Vaikuntha Ekadashi, begins the second phase. The deity, seated on a specially made porch, is worshipped in the night during the second phase. Special services suited to each incarnation of Vishnu are offered during this phase.  Significance  = Religious and national importance = Simhachalam is one of the 32 Narasimha temples in Andhra Pradesh which are important pilgrimage centres alongside Ahobilam, Antarvedi, Kadiri and Mangalagiri among others. It was regarded as an important centre of Vaishnavism in the medieval period along with Srikurmam and others. Diana L Eck, the author of India: A Sacred Geography (2012) noted that at Simhachalam, Narasimha's \\"frightening\\" violence is softened by worshipping him in conjunction with Varaha, who is usually considered as a peaceful deity. Varaha Narasimha is referred to with many names such as Simhadrinatha, Simhadri Appanna and Apparu. It is believed that the deity is capable of giving progeny to women and fulfilling wishes of devotees. It was observed that parents who begot children after praying here named their children after the Simhachalam temple and its deity. Simhachalam is the second-largest after Tirumala in Andhra Pradesh in terms of income earned; as of 2013, the earnings stood at 60 crores (600 million). It is the first temple in the north coastal region of Andhra Pradesh and second in the entire state (after the Satyanarayana temple in Annavaram) to follow the cashless system. Point of sale systems. provided by the State Bank of India and Andhra Bank, are used for accepting donations and gifts from devotees. = Literary mentions = Simhachalam temple found many literary references and lyrical works dedicated by anonymous writers; some of the latter are preserved in the Government Oriental Manuscripts Library, Chennai. The earliest known literary mention of the temple is found in Lakshmi Narasimhapurana written by Telugu poet Yerrapragada. He mentioned it as a place of pilgrimage visited by a sage on a holy tour. But Yerrapragada did not describe the temple as the work was focused on Ahobilam temple. Srinatha described the Simhadri Thirunaal event, a festive gathering at the temple. He described the various classes of ladies assembled at the gathering in his Chatuvulu (extempore poems). Krishnamacharyulu wrote devotional vachanas (prose) in praise of Varaha Narasimha of Simhachalam. Written in churnika style, they are known as Simhagiri Vachanas and Simhagiri Narahari Vachanas. He was the first Telugu poet to use bhakti (devotion) in Telugu literature and was succeeded by Annamacharya, Kancherla Gopanna and Tyagaraja. Simhagiri Vachanas had features of the Shatakam-style of poetry. It is believed that Krishnamacharyulu was inspired by Ramanuja's Gadyatrayam and opted for prose to reach the ordinary people. Krishnamacharyulu wrote 400,000 vachanas on copper plates of which 75 are available after he left for Srirangam. The vachanas begin with an invocation to the deity. Simhagiri Vachanas are recited by the local villagers near Simhachalam during special occasions. These vachanas also inspired many other poets to compose similar devotional prose including Pothana and Srinatha; the latter introduced 12 laudatory pieces showing Krishnamacharyulu's impact in his works Bhimeswara Purana and Kasikandham. Krishnadevaraya mentioned his visit to Simhachalam in his epic poem Amuktamalyada. The king's visit was also documented by poets Allasani Peddana and Dhurjati in Manucharitra and Krishnaraya Vijaya respectively. The latter particularly mentions the event of Krishnadevaraya erecting a pillar of victory at Simhachalam. Pingali Suranna makes a mention of Simhachalam in Kalapurnodayam as a part of Manikandhara's pilgrims. Telugu poets Kuchimanchi Timmakavi and Kattamuri Kameswara Kavi composed prabandhas in favour of Varaha Narasimha, named Simhasaila Mahatyam and Lakshmi Narasimha Charita respectively. The story of Muslim invaders attacking Simhachalam and their defeat was documented in a satiric way by Kurmanatha Kavi in his work Simhadri Narasimha Satakam. This work is popular among Narasimha's devotees and is cited to show the efficacy of devotion towards him.

In the early-mid seventies, he was the leader of the jazz-rock group Placebo (not to be confused with the English alternative rock band with the same name). He went on to become a member of the avant-rock band Aksak Maboul in 1977 and also formed the pop group Telex in 1978. Moulin was one of Belgium's jazz legends, making jazz-influenced records for over 30 years.  Biography  Marc Moulin was born in Ixelles, Brussels in 1942 and was the son of L√©o Moulin, a sociologist and writer, and Jeanine Moulin, a Belgian poet and literary critic. Moulin began his career in the 1960s playing the piano throughout Europe and in 1961 won the Bobby Jaspar trophy for Best Soloist at the Comblain-la-Tour festival. Moulin made his first recording, the Jazz Goes Swinging LP with The Saint-Tropez Jazz Octet (also known as Johnny Dover Octet) in 1969. Two years later, he formed the band Placebo with his close friend, guitar player Philip Catherine. Placebo recorded three albums ('Ball of Eyes', '1973' and 'Placebo') and one 45 rpm single from 1971 until the group split up in 1976. After Placebo disbanded, Moulin formed Telex with Michel Moers (vocals) and Dan Lacksman (synthesizer) in 1978 and his style shifted to electro pop. He also began working as producer for artists such as Lio, Michel Moers, Sparks, Philip Catherine, French crooner Alain Chamfort and left-field artists such as Anna Domino and Kid Montana. During the '80s, Moulin worked as a radio producer, appeared regularly on radio shows, and wrote for various Belgian publications, including 'T√©l√©moustique'. Moulin died of throat cancer on 26 September 2008. He was 66 years old.

Despite its impressive size, more than ten times larger than contemporary Athens or Tiryns, Gla is not mentioned in the Iliad.Samuel Mark, Homeric Seafaring (College Station: Texas A&M; University Press, 2005), p. 11. Description =Location= The site is located on a limestone outcrop or hill that jutted into Lake Kopais (now drained) or formed an island within it. The flat-topped outcrop rises up to 38m above the surrounding area. It measures circa 900 x 575m (at the widest point). The ancient name of the site is unknown, it is unclear whether it is one of the Boeotian places named by Homer (some scholars suggest that Gla is Homer's Arne). The scholarly designation \\"Gla\\" is from the Albanian word for fortification; the modern local population calls the site Paliokastro (Greek for \\"ancient fortress\\").Nic Fields & Donato Spedaliere, 2004: Mycenaean Fortifications, Oxford: Osprey Publishing; p. 39 =Size= Excavation revealed much detail about the fortification walls (which were always visible) and, on the interior, remains of buildings from the Mycenaean period. The fortification encloses an area of nearly 20 hectares, about 10 times as much as the Mycenaean citadels of Athens or Tiryns. =Walls= The south gate, external view (note ashlar masonry) The walls surrounding Gla were about 3 m thick, and 2.8 km long, enclosing about 235,000 square meters of land. These massive walls were made from Cyclopean masonry. In many locations they are built directly on the cliffs that form the limit of the outcrop. It had four gates, an unusually high number for a Mycenaean fortification, in the north, west, south and southeast. Elaborate built ramps led to the gates. The fortification can be dated to early Late Helladic III B, that is, circa 1300 BC. Within the walls, there was thought to be a palatial complex, but recent evidence has pointed in the direction of a military establishment with much storage space. Of all the space that in enclosed within the walls of Gla, there are very few permanent structures, and they take up less than a quarter of the space inside the walls. Some of this empty space possibly was used to house temporary structures, especially in times when there was construction and draining in progress. =Draining of the Kopais= Much of the area within the walls is vacant, leading archaeologists to believe that it served as a refuge for farmers in the area of Lake Kopais in the event of attack. It is suggested that the land dominated by the citadel of Gla served as the \\"bread basket\\" of the Mycenaean world. This is supported by the fact that Lake Kopais, the largest lake in southern Greece, had been drained by a system of dams and canals (one of the most astonishing achievements of prehistoric engineering) at about the same time as the erection of Gla, producing a large fertile plain. The drainage system collapsed from destruction or neglect at or after the end of Mycenaean Civilisation; in Classical Antiquity, the lake existed again. It was drained a second time in the 19th century. The system comprised two large canals that met about 1 km north of Gla. These canals combined covered over 50 km in length, and collected water from the Boeotian Cephissus and Melas rivers and redistributed them into areas where the water flowed out to sea easily. Interior structures =Palace= The most striking interior feature is a large L-shaped building, often described as a \\"palace\\". It is in the north of the site, which is subdivided by several internal walls in this area. The \\"palace\\" is located on an artificial terrace and consists of three wings. Each of the wings contains mostly very small rooms, arranged in groups of six and accessed by corridors. At the two ends of the L, there are similar arrangements of rooms resembling the megaron complexes known from Tiryns, Mycenae Dimini and Pylos. Nevertheless, the lack of several typical features of other Mycenaean palaces, namely of a \\"throne room\\", a (circular) hearth and a \\"bathroom\\" casts some doubt on the designation of the structure as a palace. =Agora= Two further Mycenaean architectural complexes were found further south, in the area of the so-called \\"agora\\", which is separated from the \\"palace area\\" by a wall. The two complexes are parallel to each other (north- south orientation) and have similar plans. In each, a long corridor links buildings in the north and south of the complex. They are subdivided into small rooms. There is no scholarly consensus on their function. Suggestions include use as barracks, storage spaces/distribution centres, or workshops. The storage theory is supported by the discovery of large amounts of carbonised grain (probably burnt during the destruction of the site) in one of the buildings. Tiles An interesting feature of the buildings at Gla is the discovery of fired pan and cover tiles, suggesting that some Mycenaean buildings already featured pitched, tiled roofs similar to those known from Classical antiquity.Ione Mylonas Shear, ‚ÄúExcavations on the Acropolis of Midea: Results of the Greek-Swedish Excavations under the Direction of Katie Demakopoulou and Paul √Östr√∂m‚Äù, American Journal of Archaeology, Vol. 104, No. 1. (Jan., 2000), pp. 133-134 (134) There is some evidence that human occupation of Gla was not limited to the Mycenaean period. For example, the site yielded pottery from Neolithic and Byzantine times. It does not, however, appear to have been occupied during the Archaic-Classical Greek and Roman periods. Gallery Image:Gla.

Early years Evans's parents were Hollywood writers Dale Eunson and Katherine Albert. Her father wrote the book The Day They Gave Babies Away, which was made into the movie All Mine to Give (1957). She was named after actress Joan Crawford, her godmother. Before she appeared in movies, she played Gretel In a school performance of \\"Hansel and Gretel.\\" Acting =Sam Goldwyn= Evans appeared in three movies with actor Farley Granger. Her first film with him was as the title role in Roseanna McCoy (1949), based on the real-life romance between two members of the Hatfield-McCoy feud. She gained the role after producer Samuel Goldwyn conducted a national talent search after the original star, Cathy O'Donnell, pulled out. Evans was only 14 years old when she started work on Roseanna McCoy, and her parents added two years to her age so she could claim to be 16 when the film was released. Evans' film career was launched with her three pictures opposite Granger, including a supporting role in the drama Our Very Own (1950) and a featured part in the crime story Edge of Doom (1950). She had top billing as a suicidal teenager in RKO's drama On the Loose (1951), then second billing to Esther Williams in an MGM musical comedy, Skirts Ahoy! (1952). Goldwyn loaned her to Universal where she was third billed as Irene Dunne's daughter in It Grows on Trees (1952). She was Audie Murphy's leading lady in Column South (1953). =Television= At Republic, she starred as the love interest of John Derek in a western, The Outcast (1954), and started appearing on TV shows like General Electric Theatre, Climax!, The Millionaire, Schlitz Playhouse, Cavalcade of America, Lux Video Theatre, Cheyenne, Wagon Train, 77 Sunset Strip and Zorro. She had the lead in a crime film for Republic, A Strange Adventure (1956) and was reunited with Murphy for No Name on the Bullet (1959). For Sam Katzman she was one of The Flying Fontaines (1959). Her final performances were in The Chevy Mystery Show, The Rebel, Outlaws, Tales of Wells Fargo, The Brothers Brannagan, Ripcord, and The Tall Man. Her last feature film was The Walking Target. Her last role was in the episode \\"The Killer Legend\\" of Laramie as Julie Wade. She retired from acting in 1961. Journalism In the 1950s, Evans wrote articles for Photoplay magazine. Beginning in May 1966, she was editor of Hollywood Studio Magazine, using her married name, Joan Evans Weatherly. Later years Evans became an educator, and in the 1970s she was the director of Carden Academy in Van Nuys, California. Personal life When Evans was 17 years old, she announced that she would marry a car salesman named Kirby Weatherly. Her parents asked Crawford to dissuade her from marrying, since Evans was so young, but Crawford not only gave the couple her blessing, she had the wedding ceremony performed right in her own house without having the parents present. Evans's marriage to Weatherly lasted, but the friendship between Evans's parents and Crawford ended. The Weatherlys had a daughter on August 16, 1955.

He was a distinguished pupil of Duns Scotus, whose teaching (Scotism) he usually followed. He acquired a great reputation for ability in discussion at the Sorbonne, and was known as the Doctor Illuminatus 'Enlightened teacher', as Magister Acutus or Doctor acutus, and as Magister abstractionum 'Master of abstractions'. Biography Francis Meyronnes was not only an important medieval French philosopher, but also: a theologian, a student, a teacher, and a minister. He was born (c.a 1288) in Provence, France (located in the southwest region); Meyronnes was probably from a noble family, who were well connected to the house of Anjou. Meyronnes joined the Order of Friars Minor, more commonly known as the Franciscans. He studied philosophy and theology at the University of Paris (c.a 1304-1307) under John Duns Scotus at the University of Paris. Meyronnes was considered a Scotist; however, he was more of an independent-minded follower of Scotus1 Pasnau, Robert. \\"The Cambridge History of Medieval Philosophy\\" (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2010). Meyronnes lectured on the Sentences, in Paris, from 1320 to 1321. In that same year, Meyronnes and Pierre Auriol (both Franciscans) engaged in a famous debate with Pierre Roger (\\"the champion of Thomism\\" who would soon be Clement VI); the theological questions discussed were taken from the Sententiae of Peter Lombard (a scholastic theologian, bishop, and author of Four Books of Sentences).John E. Wrigley, \\"Clement VI Before His Pontificate: The Early Life of Pierre Roger, 1290/91-1342\\". The Catholic Historical Review, Vol. 56, No.3 (1970), Robert of Anjou, who was at the time the king of Sicily, requested to Pope John XXII to title Meyronnes as a master in theology. So, on 24 May 1323, the chancellor of the University of Paris (commanded by Pope John XXII) deemed Meyronnes to be a master in theology. Francis served as the Provincial Minister of Provence, from 1323 to 1328. During his Provincial Ministering, Francis actively preached, taught, and served as the pope‚Äôs ambassador in Gascogne. Francis Meyronnes died in 1328 in Piacenza, Italy, leaving behind an extensive collection of discourses on a wide, comprehensive range of topics. Topics include religion, economics, philosophy, human cognition, politics, the nature of space, and the possibility of other worlds.Garcia, Jorge J.E & Timothy B. Noone (eds.), \\"A Companion to Philosophy in the Middle Ages.\\" (Malden, MA: Blackwell, 2003). pg. 256-257 He took part in the discussions on the nature of Universals. Following Duns Scotus, he adopted the Platonic theory of ideas, and denied that Aristotle had made any contribution to metaphysical speculation. It is a curious commentary on the theories of Duns Scotus that one pupil, Francis, should have taken this course, while another pupil, William of Occam, should have used his arguments in a diametrically opposite direction and ended in extreme Nominalism.

Members of the movement have variously referred to themselves as Bible Students, International Bible Students, Associated Bible Students, or Independent Bible Students. The origins of the movement are associated with the formation of Zion's Watch Tower Tract Society in 1881, and the later formation of Jehovah's Witnesses whose beliefs have diverged considerably from Russell's teachings. A number of schisms developed within the congregations of Bible Students associated with the Watch Tower Society between 1909 and 1932. The most significant split began in 1917 following the election of Joseph Franklin Rutherford as president of the Watch Tower Society two months after Russell's death. The schism began with Rutherford's controversial replacement of four of the Society's board of directors and publication of The Finished Mystery. Thousands of members left congregations of Bible Students associated with the Watch Tower Society throughout the 1920s prompted in part by Rutherford's failed predictions for the year 1925, increasing disillusionment with his on- going doctrinal and organizational changes, and his campaign for centralized control of the movement. William Schnell, author and former Jehovah's Witness, claims that three-quarters of the original Bible Students who had been associating with the Watch Tower Society in 1921 had left by 1931., as cited by . cites The Watch Tower December 1, 1927 (p 355) in which Rutherford states, \\"the larger percentage\\" of original Bible Students had by then departed. In 1930 Rutherford stated that \\"the total number of those who have withdrawn from the Society... is comparatively large.\\"The Watch Tower November 15, 1930 p. 342 col 1. Between 1918 and 1929, several factions formed their own independent fellowships, including the Stand Fast Movement, the Pastoral Bible Institute, the Laymen's Home Missionary Movement founded by PSL Johnson, and the Dawn Bible Students Association. These groups range from conservative, claiming to be Russell's true followers, to more liberal, claiming that Russell's role is not as important as once believed. Rutherford's faction of the movement retained control of the Watch Tower Society and adopted the name Jehovah's Witnesses in July 1931. By the end of the 20th century, Jehovah's Witnesses claimed a membership of 6 million,See Demographics of Jehovah's Witnesses while other independent Bible Student groups were estimated to total less than 75,000.Present Truth February, 2006 pp 9‚Äì13. Foundation Charles Russell in 1911In 1869 Charles Russell viewed a presentation by Advent Christian preacher Jonas Wendell pointed to 1873 for the time of Christ's visible return. (influenced by the Millerites) and soon after began attending an Adventist Bible study group in Allegheny, Pennsylvania led by George Stetson. Russell acknowledged the influence of Adventist ministers including George Storrs, an old acquaintance of William Miller and semi-regular attendee at the Bible study group in Allegheny.Watch Tower, 1906, as cited by . In early January 1876 Russell met independent Adventist preachers Nelson H. Barbour and John H. Paton, publishers of the Herald of the Morning, who convinced him that Christ had returned invisibly in 1874.. Russell provided financial backing for Barbour and became co-editor of Barbour's magazine, Herald of the Morning; the pair jointly issued Three Worlds and the Harvest of This World (1877), written mostly by Barbour.. Various concepts in the book are still taught by the Bible Student movement and Jehovah's Witnesses, including a 2520-year period termed \\"the Gentile Times\\" predicted to end in 1914. Deviating from most Second Adventists the book taught that the earth would not be burned up when Christ returned, but that humankind since Adam would eventually be resurrected to the earth and given the opportunity to attain eternal perfect human life if obedient. It also revealed an expectation that all of the \\"saints\\" would be taken to heaven in April, 1878.Three Worlds, pp. 184‚Äì85. Russell continued to develop his interpretations of biblical chronology. In 1877, he published 50,000 copies of the pamphlet The Object and Manner of Our Lord's Return, teaching that Christ would return invisibly before the battle of Armageddon. By 1878 he was teaching the Adventist view that the \\"time of the end\\" had begun in 1799,\\"The 'Time of the End,' a period of one hundred and fifteen (115) years, from A.D. 1799 to A.D. 1914, is particularly marked in the Scriptures.\\" Thy Kingdom Come, 1890, p. 23. and that Christ had returned invisibly in 1874 and had been crowned in heaven as king in 1878. Russell believed that 1878 also marked the resurrection of the \\"sleeping saints\\" (all faithful Christians who had died up to that time) and the \\"fall of Babylon\\" which he taught to be God's final judgment of unfaithful Christendom.Thy Kingdom Come (1890), Volume 3 of Studies in the Scriptures, pp. 305‚Äì8.\\"This spuing out, or casting off, of the nominal church as an organization in 1878, we then understood, and still proclaim, to be the date of the commencement of Babylon's fall...\\"--\\"The Consummation of Our Hope\\" in Zion's Watch Tower, April 1883. Reprints pp. 474‚Äì5. October 1914 was held as the end of a harvest period that would culminate in the beginning of Armageddon, manifested by the emergence of worldwide anarchy and the decline and destruction of civilized society. The Watch Tower, July 1881, \\"Future Work and Glory\\"\\"Things to Come‚ÄîAnd The Present European Situation\\" , The Watch Tower, January 15, 1892, Reprints, p. 1355 Russell broke with Barbour in July 1879 over the doctrine of substitutionary atonement and began publishing his own monthly magazine, Zion's Watch Tower and Herald of Christ's Presence (now known as The Watchtower Announcing Jehovah's Kingdom), and the pair competed through their rival publications for the minds of their readers.Russell explained his side of the break with Barbour in the first issue of the Watch Tower. (Semi-monthly publication of the magazine began in 1892.) In early 1881, Russell predicted that the churches ('Babylon') would begin to fall apart and that the rapture of the saints would take place that year, although they would remain on earth as materialized spirit beings. In 1882 he outlined his nontrinitarian views concluding that the doctrine is not taught in the Bible. Readers of Zion's Watch Tower formed thirty Bible study groups in seven states in the United States in 1879-80, with each congregation electing its own elders. In 1880 Russell visited the congregations to conduct six-hour study sessions, teaching each congregation how to carry out topical Bible study. =Watch Tower Society= In 1881, Zion's Watch Tower Tract Society was formed as an unincorporated administrative agency for the purpose of disseminating tracts, papers, doctrinal treatises and Bibles, with Russell as secretary and William Henry Conley as president.\\"Modern History of Jehovah‚Äôs Witnesses\\", Watchtower, January 15, 1955, page 14. Three years later, on December 15, 1884, Russell became president of the society when it was legally incorporated in Pennsylvania.Holden, A. (2002) Jehovah's Witnesses: Portrait of a Contemporary Religious Movement. (p. 18) (The society was renamed Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society in September 1896). Russell wrote many articles, books, pamphlets and sermons, which by his death totaled 50,000 printed pages, with almost 20 million copies of his books printed and distributed around the world. In 1886, he wrote the first of what would become a six-volume Bible textbook series called Millennial Dawn, later renamed Studies in the Scriptures,Yearbook 1975, Watch Tower Society, 1975. which presented his fundamental doctrines. As a consequence, the Bible Students were sometimes called Millennial Dawnists. Russell advertised for 1000 preachers in 1881, and encouraged all who were members of \\"the body of Christ\\" to preach to their neighbors, to gather the \\"little flock\\" of saints while the vast majority of mankind would be given the opportunity to gain salvation during Christ's 1000-year reign. Russell's supporters gathered as autonomous congregations to study the Bible and his writings. Russell rejected the concept of a formal organization as \\"wholly unnecessary\\" for his followers and declared that his group had no record of its members' names, no creeds, and no sectarian name. He wrote in February 1884: \\"By whatsoever names men may call us, it matters not to us... we call ourselves simply Christians.\\" and cited by . Elders and deacons were elected by congregations and Russell tolerated a great latitude of belief among members. He opposed formal disciplinary procedures by congregation elders, claiming this was beyond their authority,, as cited by , \\"The Lord's word does not authorize any court of Elders, or anyone else, to become busybodies. This would be going back to the practices of the Dark Ages during the Inquisition and we would be showing the same spirit as did the inquisitors.\\" instead recommending that an individual who continued in a wrong course be judged by the entire congregation, which could ultimately \\"withdraw from him its fellowship\\" if the undesirable behavior continued. Disfellowshipping did not mean the wrongdoer was to be shunned in all social circumstances or by all Bible Students, though fellowship would be limited. From 1895, Russell encouraged congregations to study his Bible textbook series, Studies in the Scriptures, paragraph by paragraph to properly discern God's plan for humanity. In 1905 he recommended replacing verse-by-verse Bible studies with what he called \\"Berean Studies\\" of topics he chose. The Watch Tower Society opened overseas branches in London (1900),Jehovah's Witnesses in the Divine Purpose, Watch Tower Bible & Tract Society, 1959, page 32. Germany (1903), and Australia and Switzerland (1904).\\"The First One a Hundred Years Ago\\", Awake, December 22, 2000. The Society's headquarters were transferred to Brooklyn, New York in 1909.\\"Organized Testimony to the New World\\", Watchtower, July 15, 1950, page 215. In January 1914 the Bible Students began public showings of The Photo-Drama of Creation.Slides and film from the Photo-Drama can be viewed online at AGS Consulting ; the book is available online at Herald. It presented Russell's views of God's plan from the creation of the earth through to the establishment and administration of God's kingdom on earth. The Photo-Drama represented a significant advancement in film production, as the first major presentation to synchronize motion pictures with audio by use of phonograph records. Worldwide attendance in 1914 exceeded nine million.American Movie Classics, \\"Timeline of Influential Milestones... 1910s\\" , Retrieved 2009-04-15. =International Bible Students Association= In 1910, Russell introduced the name International Bible Students Association as a means of identifying his worldwide community of Bible study groups. He wrote: Russell explained that the Association would be directed and managed by the Peoples [sic] Pulpit Association which, in turn, represented the Watch Tower Bible & Tract Society. All Bible Student classes using Watch Tower Society publications could consider themselves identified with the Association and were authorized to use the name International Bible Students Association in connection with their meetings. The name was also used when advertising and conducting Bible Students conventions. Formative influences In addition to Russell other early influences include: * Nelson H. Barbour (1824‚Äì1905) * John Nelson Darby (1800‚Äì1882) * Henry Dunn (1801‚Äì1878) * Henry Grew (1781‚Äì1862) * Dunbar Isidore Heath (1816‚Äì1888) * William Miller (1782‚Äì1849) * George Stetson (1814‚Äì1879) * George Storrs (1796‚Äì1879) * Randolph E. Streeter (1847‚Äì1924) * Jonas Wendell (1815‚Äì1873) * Joseph Seiss (1823‚Äì1904) First schism In 1905 Paul S. L. Johnson, one of the traveling \\"Pilgrim\\" speakers and a former Lutheran minister, pointed out to Russell that his doctrines on the New Covenant had undergone a complete reversal: until 1880 he had taught that the New Covenant would be inaugurated only after the last of the 144,000 anointed Christians had been taken to heaven,\\"The Three Great Covenants\\", Zion's Watch Tower, March 1880. but since 1881 he had written that it was already in force.New Covenant vs the Law Covenant\\", Zion's Watch Tower, September 1887. Russell reconsidered the question and in January 1907 wrote several Watch Tower articles reaffirming his 1880 position--that \\"the new covenant belongs exclusively to the coming age\\"\\"The Mediator of the New Covernant\\", Zion's Watch Tower, January 1, 1907, pages 9, 10.--adding that the church had no mediator, but that Christ was the \\"advocate\\". He also taught that Christians making up the 144,000 would join Christ as a \\"joint heir\\" and assistant mediator during the millennium.\\"The Word Mediator Used Differently,\\", Watch Tower, January 1909. On October 24, 1909 former Watch Tower Society secretary- treasurer Ernest C. Henninges, who was by then the Australian branch manager based in Melbourne, wrote Russell an open letter of protest trying to persuade him to abandon the teaching, and calling on Bible Students to examine its legitimacy. When Russell refused, Henninges and most of the Melbourne congregation left Russell's movement to form the New Covenant Fellowship. Hundreds of the estimated 10,000 U.S. Bible Students also left, including pilgrim Matthew L. McPhail, a member of the Chicago Bible Students, and A. E. Williamson of Brooklyn, forming the New Covenant Believers. The group, which informally referred to members as Free Bible Students, published The Kingdom Scribe magazine until 1975. The group is currently known as the Berean Bible Students Church, with fewer than 200 members. Leadership dispute Joseph Rutherford Russell died on October 31, 1916, in Pampa, Texas during a cross- country preaching trip. On January 6, 1917, board member and society legal counsel Joseph Franklin Rutherford was elected president of the Watch Tower Society, unopposed, at the Pittsburgh convention. Rutherford then announced publication of The Finished Mystery, which he claimed was a posthumous volume of Russell's Studies in the Scriptures. By-laws passed by both the Pittsburgh convention and the board of directors stated that the president would be the executive officer and general manager of the society, giving him full charge of its affairs worldwide. By June, four of the seven Watch Tower Society directors--Robert H. Hirsh, Alfred I. Ritchie, Isaac F. Hoskins and James D. Wright-- had decided they had erred in endorsing Rutherford's expanded powers of management, claiming Rutherford had become autocratic. In June Hirsh attempted to rescind the new by-laws and to reclaim the powers of management from the president, but Rutherford later claimed he had by then detected a conspiracy among the directors to seize control of the society. In July, Rutherford gained a legal opinion from a Philadelphia corporation lawyer that the four were not legally directors of the society. On July 12, Rutherford filled what he claimed were four vacancies on the board, appointing Alexander H. Macmillan and Pennsylvania Bible Students W. E. Spill, John A. Bohnet and George H. Fisher as directors. Between August and November the society and the four ousted directors published a series of pamphlets, with each side accusing the other of ambitious, disruptive and dishonest conduct. The former directors also claimed Rutherford had required all headquarters workers to sign a petition supporting him and threatened dismissal for any who refused to sign. Police forcibly escorted the former directors from the Brooklyn headquarters on August 8. On January 5, 1918 Rutherford was returned to office. By mid-1919 about one in seven Bible Students had chosen to leave rather than accept Rutherford's leadership, forming groups such as The Stand Fast Movement, Paul Johnson Movement, and the Pastoral Bible Institute of Brooklyn. It is estimated that as many as three quarters of the Bible Students associating in 1921 left the movement by 1931 in protest against Rutherford's rejection of Pastor Russell's teachings. To reduce public confusion regarding the existence of several groups of Bible Students no longer associated with the Watch Tower Society, Rutherford's faction of Bible Students adopted the name Jehovah's witnesses on July 26, 1931 at a convention in Columbus, Ohio.Rogerson, Alan, Millions Now Living Will Never Die: A Study of Jehovah's Witnesses, Constable, London, 1969. pp 55-56: \\"In 1931 came an important milestone in the history of the organisation. For many years Rutherford's followers had been called a variety of names: 'International Bible Students', 'Russellites', or 'Millennial Dawners'. In order to distinguish clearly his followers from the other groups who had separated in 1918 Rutherford proposed that they adopt an entirely new name - Jehovah's witnesses.\\" The Watch Tower, \\"A New Name\\", October 1, 1931 pp 291: \\"Since the death of Charles T. Russell there have arisen numerous companies formed out of those who once walked with him, each of these companies claiming to teach the truth, and each calling themselves by some name, such as \\"Followers of Pastor Russell\\", \\"those who stand by the truth as expounded by Pastor Russell\\", \\"Associated Bible Students\\", and some by the names of their local leaders. All of this tends to confusion and hinders those of good will who are not better informed from obtaining a knowledge of the truth.\\" Associated Bible Students The Associated Bible Students groups, which adhere to Charles Taze Russell's teachings, include the Independent Bible Students, Stand Fast Bible Students and Dawn Bible Students. Congregations are autonomous, and may not necessarily have contact with other congregations, though many do. The Dawn Bible Students collectively form the largest segment of the Bible Student movement separate from the Watch Tower Society. =Pastoral Bible Institute= In 1918, the former directors held the first Bible Student Convention independent of the Watch Tower Society. At the second convention a few months later, the informal Pastoral Bible Institute was founded. They began publishing The Herald of Christ's Kingdom, edited by Randolph E. Streeter. An editorial committee continues publication of the magazine. in a reduced capacity, and reproduces other Bible Student movement literature, including Russell's six-volume Studies in the Scriptures. =Berean Bible Institute= The Australian Berean Bible Institute (BBI) formally separated from the Watch Tower Society in 1918. It published The Voice, and continues to publish the People's Paper magazine. There are several 'classes' of Bible students in Australia that hold similar beliefs to those promulgated by the BBI, but there is no official affiliation. Two conventions are held annually in Anglesea, Victoria and Alexandra Headlands, Queensland. There is no official creed; members are allowed to come to their own conclusions regarding interpretations of the Bible; the role of fellowship is to provide mutual help and stimulation. The number of Bible Students in Australia is estimated at approximately 100. =Stand Fast Bible Students Association= In December 1918, Charles E. Heard and others considered Rutherford's indifference\\"Could Not Talk of Loan\\", The New York Times, April 29, 1918, As Retrieved 2010-03-02, \\"Rutherford, the President, sa[id] that the buying of bonds was not a religious question, and that the [IBSA] association did not oppose the purchase of Liberty bonds by the members\\" regarding the purchase of war bonds to be a perversion of Russell's pacifist teachings, and contrary to scripture.Watch Tower, March 1, 1919:\\"'The International Bible Students‚Äô Association is not against the Liberty Loan.; in Watch Tower, June 1, 1919 Rutherford indicated regret about making any comment on the matter. As a result, they founded the Stand Fast Bible Students Association in Portland, Oregon, USA. The name originated from their decision to \\"stand fast\\" on principles involving war that Russell had espoused. Membership dwindled and the group was eventually disbanded. A splinter group known as the Elijah Voice Society, was founded by John A. Herdersen and C. D. McCray in 1923. They were especially noted for their preaching and pacifist activity. =Dawn Bible Students Association= In 1928, Norman Woodworth, cousin of Clayton J. Woodworth, left the Watch Tower Society after having been in charge of their radio ministry. Woodworth created an independent Bible Students radio program called Frank and Ernest. Funding was provided by the Brooklyn congregation of Bible Students and broadcasting continued into the 1980s. In 1929 the station sponsored the First Annual Reunion Convention of Bible Students at the old Bible House used by Russell in Pittsburgh. In 1931 Woodworth and others founded the Dawn Bible Students Association to resume publication of Studies in the Scriptures, which the Watch Tower Society had officially ceased printing in 1927. The Dawn Bible Students published a leaflet, The Bible Students Radio Echo, to follow up interest in the radio program. The leaflet was soon developed into a 16-page magazine and renamed The Dawn‚ÄîA Herald of Christ's Presence, which they continue to publish, along with radio, television, and Internet radio programs. =Independent Bible Students= Over the past thirty-five years, controversy surrounded the Dawn Bible Students Association as their publishing and editorial committee began to promote more- liberal points of view, distancing themselves from some of Russell's viewpoints, alienating many Bible Students as a result. In 1974, a group of Bible Students meeting at a convention in Fort Collins, Colorado formally ceased their spiritual fellowship with, and financial support of, the Dawn Bible Students Association. They refer to themselves as Independent Bible Students. The split was not intended to eliminate or restrict personal fellowship, but was viewed as a \\"stand for the truth\\" by ceasing sponsorship of elders associated with the Dawn Bible Students, and avoiding attendance at their conventions. In recent years, attempts have been made to reintegrate the groups. The Independent Bible Students publishes a non-doctrinal magazine, The Bible Students Newsletter. Free Bible Students The Free Bible Students separated very early from the Watchtower Society, as Russell began to change some teachings. =New Covenant Believers= In 1909, Matthew L. McPhail, a traveling elder (\\"Pilgrim\\") and member of the Chicago Bible Students, disassociated from Russell's movement when controversy arose over Russell's expanded view of the application and timing of the \\"New Covenant\\" mentioned by Jeremiah, and led the New Covenant Bible Students in the United States, founding the New Covenant Believers in that year. The community, which members informally refer to as Free Bible Students, published The Kingdom Scribe magazine until 1975. The founding group is now known as the Berean Bible Students Church in Lombard.Welcome to Berean Bible Students Church =Christian Discipling Ministries International= In 1928 the Italian Bible Students Association in Hartford, Connecticut withdrew its support from the Watch Tower Society and changed its name to the Millennial Bible Students Church or Christian Millennial Fellowship and later to Christian Discipling Ministries International. They came to reject many of Russell's writings as erroneous. Now located in New Jersey, the group is known as the Free Bible Students; it has published The New Creation magazine since 1940. =Free Bible Students Association= Conrad C. Binkele the former Branch Manager of Watchtower Society founded in 1928 the community of \\"Free Bible Students Association\\" in the German region (Germany, Austria, Switzerland) with other brethren and began publishing \\"Der Pilgrim\\" a religious magazine from 1931 to 1934. Free Bible Students in Germany were persecuted during World War II. Only after the war were rehabilitated in the Bible Students and approved the publication again. Jehovah's Witnesses Bible Students who submitted to Rutherford's leadership of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society became known as Jehovah's witnesses in 1931. The Watch Tower Society remains the denomination's primary administrative body, and their beliefs and organizational structure have diverged considerably from Russell's. Their literature states that Bible Students is the former name for their group, and does not acknowledge the continued existence of other Bible Student groups. In 1955, the Watch Tower Society claimed that those who separated from the movement during Rutherford's presidency constituted the \\"evil slave\\" of Matthew 24:48-51.The Watchtower, April 1, 1955, \\"Part 7‚ÄîNew Administration Amid World War I\\" (The Society altered its view in 2013, calling the \\"evil slave\\" a hypothetical warning to the 'faithful slave'.) Jehovah's Witnesses report worldwide membership of over 8 million. Laymen's Home Missionary Movement Paul S. L. Johnson founded the Laymen's Home Missionary Movement in 1919. Johnson's death in 1950 led to an internal disagreement over his role as a teacher chosen by God, and resulted in the formation of new splinter groups, such as the Epiphany Bible Students Association, and the Laodicean Home Missionary Movement. Johnson believed he had been appointed by God as Russell's official spiritual successor, that he was the last member of the 144,000 of Revelation 7, and that hope of a heavenly reward of immortality for the Christian faithful would cease after his death. His associate and successor, Raymond Jolly, taught that he himself was the last member of the \\"great multitude\\", also of Revelation 7. After Jolly's death, remaining members of the fellowship believed they would live on a perfected earth in God's kingdom as a group referred to as the \\"modern worthies\\", as associates of the \\"ancient worthies\\"--the ancient Jewish prophets God would resurrect to guide and instruct the world in his kingdom. Other groups =Friends of Man= Alexander FL Freytag, manager of the branch office of the Watch Tower Society in Switzerland since 1898, had disagreed with Russell's teachings before Russell's death in 1916. He began publishing his own views using the Watch Tower Society's printing equipment in 1917, and was ousted from the Watch Tower Society by Rutherford in 1919. In 1920, Freytag founded the Angel of Jehovah Bible and Tract Society, also known as the Philanthropic Assembly of the Friends of Man and The Church of the Kingdom of God. He published two journals, the monthly The Monitor of the Reign of Justice and the weekly Paper for All.

The instrument was designed by Felix Mottl, a conductor of Wagner's works, and constructed by Schweisgut, of Karlsruhe, Germany. Construction It is constructed on the principle of the grand piano. A massive frame is shaped like a snooker table. The instrument has five notes; each note has six strings (three are tuned to the fundamental pitch, and three an octave higher). The strings are struck by large hammers, covered with cotton-wool, which the performer sets in motion by a strong elastic blow from his or her fist, similar to the motion of playing a carillon. The hammers are attached to arms long, which are screwed to a strong wooden span bridge placed horizontally above the strings at about two-fifths of the length from the front. On the point of the arm is the name of the note, and behind this the felt ledge struck by the fist. Two belly bridges and two wrest-plank bridges, one set for each octave, determine the vibrating length of the strings, and the belly bridge, as in other stringed instruments, is the medium through which the vibrations of the strings are communicated to the soundboard. The arrangement of pegs and wrest-pins is much the same as on the piano. Need Difficulties arise whenever a composer writes a piece for orchestra in which he calls for reproducing the effect of church bells. Well- known examples include 1812 Overture, The Golden Legend, Cavalleria Rusticana, Pagliacci, Rienzi, and Parsifal. The most serious difficulty of all arose in Parsifal, where the bells are called for in an extremely solemn scene with deep religious significance. If real church bells were used for the notes Wagner wrote, they would overpower the orchestra and ruin the solemn atmosphere on the stage. Earlier Wagnerian church bell substitutes Various substitutes for bells were tried in vain, but no other instrument gave a tone similar to that of church bells. This is because a bell sound consists of rich harmonics composing the clang, plus two distinct simultaneous notes, first the tap tone, which gives the pitch, and the hum tone or lower accompanying note. The dignity and beauty of the bell tone depend on the interval separating the hum from the tap tone. A stringed instrument, similar to the Parsifal bell but having only four notes, was used at Bayreuth for the first performance of Parsifal in 1882, where it was combined with tam-tams or gongs in an attempt to replicate the sound of a church bell. The instrument was built by the Bayreuth-based pianoforte manufacturer Steingraeber & S√∂hne. After many trials the following combination was adopted as the best makeshift: # the stringed instrument with four keys; # four tam-tams or gongs tuned to the pitch of the four notes composing the chime; # a tuba, which plays the notes staccato in quavers to help make them more distinct; # a fifth tam-tam, on which a roll is executed with a drumstick. Modern church bell substitutes In most orchestral music, tubular bells are used when a bell sound is called for. In another special case, a special peal of hemispherical bells was constructed for use in performances of Sir Arthur Sullivan's cantata, The Golden Legend. Struck with mallets, they produced both tap and hum tone. But Parsifal presented a particular problem because the lowest of the Golden Legend bells was a minor tenth higher than the lowest note required for Parsifal, and the aggregate weight of the four bells was thousands of pounds. Modern productions of Parsifal typically use a synthesized, or electronically recorded, church bell sound.

Biography  Born at Pont-l'√âv√™que, Calvados (Normandy) to a notary father, Thouret became an avocat at the parlement of Rouen in 1773, and in 1787 produced a much-approved report on the state of Normandy. His brother, Michel Augustin Thouret (1748‚Äì1810), a physician, was a key opponent of the ideas of Franz Mesmer and a promoter of vaccination in France. =National Assembly= In 1788 he participated in the agitation that contributed to the recall of the Estates-General. Thouret was elected deputy to the Estates-General by the third estate of Rouen, and was instrumental in composing the local cahiers de dol√©ances. In the Constituent Assembly (beginning 17 June 1789) his eloquence gained him great influence. Like so many lawyers of his time, he was violently opposed to the clergy, and strongly supported the secularization of church property. He also advocated the suppression of the religious orders and of all ecclesiastical privileges, and actively contributed to the change of the judiciary and administrative system; in particular, he demanded the writing of a uniform civil code. He was four times elected president of the Constituent Assembly (3 August 1789, declined to serve; 12‚Äì23 November 1789; 8‚Äì27 May 1790; 11‚Äì30 September 1791, the final sessions of the Assembly), which is more times than anyone else. =Constitutional Committee= Thouret joined the Constitutional Committee late in September 1789. Article five of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen was adopted on his initiative, but his most important efforts surrounded the process by which France was divided into d√©partements though 1790. On 3 September 1791, a deputation of sixty members of the Constituent Assembly under the presidency of Thouret presented the 1791 Constitution to Louis XVI; on 13 September, the King addressed the Assembly, declaring that he accepted the Constitution. =Later days= After the Assembly's dissolution, Thouret became a member, and then in 1793 president, of the Court of Cassation. He was included in the proscription of the Girondists, whose political opinions he shared, and was guillotined in Paris, during the Reign of Terror, the same day as fellow Constitutional Committee member Isaac Ren√© Guy le Chapelier, and defense attorney for Louis XVI, Guillaume-Chr√©tien de Lamoignon de Malesherbes. Legacy Bust of Jacques- Guillaume Thouret in Rouen. A bust of Thouret created in 1879 by Jules- Constant Destreez can be seen in the gallery of the second floor of the Court of Cassation.

The valley was carved by the Kadisha River, also known as the Nahr Abu Ali when it reaches Tripoli. Kadisha means \\"Holy\\" in Aramaic, and the valley, sometimes called the Holy Valley. It has sheltered Christian monastic communities for many centuries. The valley is located at the foot of Mount al-Makmal in northern Lebanon. The integrity of the Valley is at risk due to encroachment of human settlements, illegal building and inconsistent conservation activity. Although it is not yet on the UNESCO \\"in danger\\" list, there have been warnings that continued violations may lead to this step.UNESCO Threatens to Remove Qadisha Valley from World Heritage List Nahar Net, 20 May 10, 08:03 Geography The holy river, Nahr Qadisha, runs through the valley for 35 km from its source in a cave (grotto) a little way below the Forest of the Cedars of God. The sides of the valley are steep cliffs that contain many caves, often at more than 1000m and all difficult of access. The most scenic section of the valley stretches for approximately twenty kilometers between Bsharri (Arabic: ), the hometown of Kahlil Gibran, and Tourza (Arabic: ). It is here also that the Holy River, Nahr Qadisha, flows, its source being in a sacred mountain celebrated in the Scriptures. =The Cedars of God= The Kadisha Valley is near the Forest of the Cedars of God, survivors of the ancient Cedars of Lebanon, the most highly prized building materials of the ancient world. The forest is said to contain 375 individual trees, two claimed to be over 3000 years old, ten over 1000 years, and the remainder at least centuries-old. The Lebanon Cedar (Cedrus Libani) is described in ancient works on botany as the oldest tree in the world. It was admired by the Israelites, who brought it to their land to build the First and the Second temples in Jerusalem. Historical sources report that the famous cedar forests were beginning to disappear at the time of Justinian in the 6th century AD. History One of the caves in the Qadisha Valley. The Qadisha Valley's many natural caves have been used as shelters and for burials back as far as the Palaeolithic period. The Aassi Hauqqa (cave) in particular, near Hawqa, Lebanon, has yielded archaeological items indicating Palaeolithic, Roman, and medieval periods of use. Since the early centuries of Christianity the Holy Valley has served as a refuge for those in search of solitude. Historians believe that the Kadisha Valley has had monastic communities continuously since the earliest years of Christianity. It was also at times a destination for Muslim mystics, or Sufis, who also visited it for meditation and solitude. Early Christian communities fleeing persecution found refuge in the Kadisha. Among these groups were the Jacobites (Syriac Orthodox), Melchites (Byzantine Catholic), Nestorians, Armenians, and even Ethiopians. The Maronites, however, are the dominant Christian group in the valley. From the late 7th century, Maronites fled to the valley from their original areas of settlement in the Levante. At that time, they feared persecution from the Jacobites, who were non-Chalcedonian, and who persecuted Chalcedonian Maronites, and from Islamic attacks. Maronite settlement intensified in the 10th century following the destruction of the Monastery of St Maron. The Maronite monks established their new center at Qannubin, in the heart of the Qadisha, and monasteries quickly spread over the surrounding hills. Early Maronite settlement in the valley combined both community and eremitic life. The Mameluk sultans Baibars and Qalaoun led campaigns in 1268 and 1283, respectively, against the fortress- caves, monasteries, and the surrounding villages. Despite these attacks, the Deir Qannubin monastery was to become the seat of the Maronite Patriarch in the 15th century and to remain so for 500 years. In the 17th century, the Maronite monks‚Äô reputation for piety was such that many European poets, historians, geographers, politicians, and clergy visited and even settled in the Valley. The first printing press in the middle east was founded in 1585 at the Monastery of Qozhaya in the Kadisha valley, and in 1610 printed its first book, the Book of Psalms in the Syriac language. It used Syriac characters. Also this printing press was the first to print in Arabic languageHistory of Lebanon = The Qadisha mummies = Eight well preserved natural mummies of Maronite villagers dating back to around 1283 A.D. were uncovered by Fadi Baroudy, Pierre Abi Aoun, Paul Kahawaja & Antoine Ghaouch, a team of speleologists Abi Aoun B., Baroudy F., Ghaouch A.

These were found in the 'Asi-al Hadath cave along with a wealth of artifacts. =World Heritage Site= In 1998, UNESCO added the valley to the list of World Heritage Sites because of its importance as the site of some of the earliest Christian monastic settlements in the world, and its continued example of early Christian faith. Christian monasticism in the valley Cross near the Monastery of Qozhaya The Kadisha (Holy) Valley is the site of some of the most ancient Christian monastic communities of the Middle East. The valley's natural caves, being comfortless, scattered, and difficult to access, provided monks and hermits sufficiently isolated and inhospitable conditions to live out Christian solitude, contemplation, and devotion. Many of the caves and irregularities in the cliff-sides were adapted to serve as individual dwellings (cells), chapels, and monasteries, and such buildings were further carved out of the cliff faces of the valley. Some have interiors covered with frescoes and facades. Around the caves there are terraced fields made by the hermits for growing grain, grapes, and olives. While there are numerous monasteries in the valley, there are several main monastic complexes: =The Qannubin Monastery= The Qannubin Monastery (Deir Qannubin (ÿØŸäÿ± ŸÇŸÜŸàÿ®ŸäŸÜ)), is on the northeast side of the Qadisha Valley. It is the oldest of the Maronite monasteries; although its foundation is often attributed to the Emperor Theodosius the Great in 375AD, it is more likely that it was established by a disciple of St Theodosius the Cenobite. For the most part it is cut into the rock cliff side - monastic cells, church, cloister, and accommodation for travelers. Qannubin used to be the See of the Maronite Patriarch. =The Monastery of St Anthony of Qozhaya= Monastery of Qozhaya - July 2003 The Monastery of Qozhaya (Deir Mar Antonios Qozhaya (ÿØŸäÿ± ŸÖÿßÿ±ÿßŸÜÿ∑ÔªÆŸÜŸäŸàÔ∫± ÔªóÔ∫∞ÿ≠Ÿäÿß)) sits on the opposite flank of the Qadisha from Qannubin Monastery. Tradition has its foundation in the 4th century by St Hilarion, in honour of the Egyptian anchorite, St Anthony the Great, though the earliest documentary records date back only to around 1000AD. It was destroyed in the 16th century but quickly restored. It comprises a corridor, meeting room, and chapel, with a mill and a number of hermitages cut into the rock nearby. =The Monastery of Our Lady of Hawqa= Saydet Hawqa is situated at an altitude of 1150m between Qannubin and Qozhaya Monasteries, at the base of an enormous cave. It was founded in the late 13th century by villagers from Hawqa. The hermitage appears to have been located on a wide platform at mid-level, where there is a water reservoir fed by channels. The upper level, only accessible by ladder, is a cave some 47m long, where the wealth of medieval pottery and arrowheads that have been found suggests its use as a refuge. Traces of fortifications have also been found in the Aassi Hauqqa (cave) at 1170m altitude. Archaeological finds show that this cave was in use in Palaeolithic, Roman, and medieval times. =The Monastery of Mar Sarkis= Monastery of Saints Sarkis & Bakhos, Ehden The Monastery of Mar Sarkis, also called Ras Al Nahr, overlooks Ehden, Kfarsghab, Bane and Hadath El Jebbeh. Given its exceptional location overlooking the valley at an altitude of 1500m, the monastery is called the Watchful Eye of Qadisha. It is dedicated to Saints Sarkis and Bakhos (Saints Sergius and Bacchus). The name Ras Al Nahr means the top of the river as it is in the vicinity of the Mar Sarkis source, the main contributor to the Qlaynsieh River which joins the Qannubin River in the valley. The first church of Saints Sarkis and Bakhos was built in the mid 8th Century A.D. on the ruins of a Canaanite temple dedicated to a god of agriculture. Next to it, another church dedicated to Our Lady was constructed in 1198 A.D. Several buildings were added from 1404 till 1690, when Patriarch Estephan DouaihyPatriarch Estephan Douaihy on Ehden Family Tree website restored part of the buildings. =The Monastery of Mar Lishaa= The monastery of Mar Elisha is perched on the cliff. Mar Lishaa or St Elisha (ÿØŸäÿ± ŸÖÿßÿ± Ô∫ÉŸÑŸäÿ¥ÿπ), mentioned first in the 14th century, is shared by two communities, a Maronite solitary order and the Barefoot Carmelite order. It consists of three or four small cells, a refectory, and some offices; the communal church includes four chapels cut into the rock-face. =Other monasteries= Other monastic establishments in the Qadisha are the Monastery of Mar Girgis, with the Chapel of Mar Challita, the Monastery of Mar Yuhanna, the Monastery of Mar Abun, with the Hermitage of Mar Sarkis, and the Monastery of Mart Moura, Ehden and others. There is another group of monasteries in the adjoining Hadchit Valley (Ouadi Houlat). These were founded by Ethiopian Monophysite monks expelled from the neighbouring town of Ehden and occupied by them before their communities scattered elsewhere. They include the hermitage-monastery complexes of Deir es-Salib, Mar Antonios, Mar Semaane, and Mar Assia, along with the isolated chapels of Mar Bohna and Mar Chmouna.

During a 13-year career for Nottinghamshire and England he took 1,274 wickets at an average of 13.73. In 1879/80 Morley toured North America with Richard Daft, and in 1880 he was selected to play in the match that later became known as the first Test match to take place in England, taking 8 for 146, including five wickets in the first innings. He toured Australia in 1882/3 as part of the Honourable Ivo Bligh's side that aimed to recover the Ashes. However, he was hampered by an injury to his rib that he picked up when the team's ship was involved in a collision in the harbour at Colombo.Cricinfo biography on Fred Morley. http://content.cricinfo.com/england/content/player/17092.html Official reports deemed the incident an \\"unfortunate incidence of chance\\". Rumours, however, soon surfaced regarding the supposed accidental nature of the collision, with some historians postulating malicious sabotage from rival cricket teams. After sustaining injuries, his subsequent bowling performances were poor. He never recovered from his injuries. Alienated from his family members due to his deteriorating health and subsequent inability to bring in income, Morley lived in seclusion during the remainder of his life.Ambrose, Don.

It is supported by Christian churches and churches of Christ, which is part of the Restoration Movement. MACU is a four-year, co-educational institution and is authorized to award Bachelor's degrees, Associate's degrees and certificates. MACU has been the primary source of Christian Church/Church of Christ preacher training in eastern North Carolina and Virginia for approximately 60 years. History MACU North Campus Mid-Atlantic Christian University was founded as Roanoke Bible College in 1948 by George and Sarah BonDurant to train preachers for churches in eastern North Carolina and the Tidewater region of Virginia. The BonDurants had previously founded Atlanta Christian College in 1937, and George BonDurant served as its first President until 1947, when he left over a dispute with the trustees. He then found employment as an evangelist of the Roanoke District Churches of Christ in eastern North Carolina in 1947. Less than a year later, the BonDurants founded MACU due to the extreme lack of preachers in the area at the time. Classes began in 1948 with 12 full-time students. The first group of transfer students graduated in 1950 and the first class to complete all four years at MACU graduated in 1952. MACU has graduated a class every year since. MACU has been accredited by the Association for Biblical Higher Education since 1979. It has been accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools since 1999. MACU absorbed the remaining funds, library holdings, and equipment of Eastern Christian College when it closed in 2005 after nearly 60 years of operation. Eastern's academic records are now archived at MACU. MACU officially changed its name to Mid-Atlantic Christian University in the summer of 2009. Enrollment at MACU reached 178 students in the fall semester of 2010. On October 3, 2010, sophomore Jonathan Schipper was shot to death in his room in the Pearl A. Presley Hall, bringing MACU national news attention. The school's official policy does not allow guns on campus. This is the only violent crime ever reported on MACU's campus during its history. Fellow student Christopher Amyx, a part-time police officer, was later convicted of first-degree murder in 2013.Hampton, Jeff.

Many sources note her as a dramatic coloratura soprano but some believe that she was a mezzo-soprano with a high extension, a soprano sfogato. She collaborated with opera composer Gioachino Rossini in the creation of a number of roles that remain in the repertory to this day; they were married on 22 March 1822. She was the composer of four collections of songs. Colbran in Naples Colbran, born in Madrid, studied under Girolamo Crescenti in Paris. By the age of twenty she had achieved fame throughout Europe for her voice. She moved to Naples, a hub of European music during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. The Teatro di San Carlo, built during the Bourbon dynasty, had been home to famous singers like the castrato Farinelli and represented a destination venue for talented singers. Colbran became the prima donna of the Teatro di San Carlo company, where she counted among her admirers the King of Naples as well as an adoring public. In time she became the mistress of the theater's impresario, Domenico Barbaia. Barbaia also managed gaming parlours and Colbran, materially well off as the result of her professional success and family fortune, developed a fondness for gambling.\\"The Gambling Mezzo Soprano ‚Äì Isabella Colbran\\", Barbara, 11 February 2010 To complement Colbran's talents Barbaia signed Gioachino Rossini to a seven-year contract as a composer of operas for the company. Upon his arrival in Naples in 1815 Rossini composed the title role of Elisabetta, regina d'Inghilterra (Elizabeth, Queen of England) especially for her. His next Neapolitan opera was Otello, ossia il Moro di Venezia in which Colbran sang the role of Desdemona. This opera proved to be immensely popular and found Colbran at the height of her powers. Her popularity led to demand for performances. Though her voice soon began to show signs of strain, Colbran continued to have a fertile career, creating the roles of Armida (Armida), Elcia (Mos√® in Egitto), Zoraide (Ricciardo e Zoraide), Ermione (Ermione), Elena (La donna del lago), Anna (Maometto II), and Zelmira (Zelmira), all written by Rossini for Naples. Colbran in Bologna The artistic collaboration between Colbran and Rossini that began in 1815 was accompanied by a romantic involvement. Colbran moved with Rossini, seven years her junior, to Bologna in 1822, where they married. The death of her father hit Colbran hard. Rossini, moved, commissioned a sculpture for the family mausoleum depicting a woman weeping at the foot of her father's sepulchre. The couple visited Vienna and later Venice, where Rossini composed Semiramide. Colbran created the title role, and even though the opera itself proved to be tremendously successful and was specifically designed to disguise her waning talents, she nonetheless disappointed the public. A visit to London in 1824 for a performance in the role commanded a high fee but received a poor critical response. After a disastrous appearance as Zelmira in 1824, she retired from the stage by the age of 42.\\"Colbran, Isabella [Isabel] (Angela)\\" by Elizabeth Forbes, Grove Music Online Colbran and Rossini separated in 1837 as the composer began a serious relationship with the artists' model Olympe P√©lissier in Paris. Colbran's health went into decline and she continued to live on her deceased father's estate in Castenaso near Bologna. As her gambling habit became more acute, she sold off parts of the estate but Rossini continued to send support. Colbran died in 1845 at age 60. She was buried near Bologna alongside her parents and Rossini's. Rossini married P√©lissier the following year. All his life Rossini credited Colbran as being the greatest interpreter of his music.Colbran, the Muse, review of Joyce DiDonato's Rossini album, by Christoph Rizoud, 20 June 2010 Voice Descriptions of Colbran's voice characterise the timbre as \\"sweet, mellow\\" with a rich middle register.\\"Semiramide dans la fosse\\", April 2006 Rossini's music for herThe library of the Royal Conservatory of Brussels conserves hundred eighty compositions from Rossini for Isabella Colbran (many of which autograph manuscripts), collected in the Edmond Michotte fund. suggests perfect mastery of trills, half-trills, staccato, legato, ascending and descending scales, and octave leaps.

It is the number 1 FM radio station in Metro Manila, Mega Manila as well as the entire Philippines according to KBP Radio Research Council.https://radioonlinenow.com/tag/kbp-radio-research-council/ DWRR was founded in 1956 as one of the radio stations of Chronicle Broadcasting Network (ABS-CBN).

It permenently ceased operations on August 31, 2020, as a result of the franchise denial made by the House of Representatives on July 10. History =DZYL-FM/DZYK- FM/DZMM-FM (1956‚Äì1972)= DZYL-FM 102 MHz, later named DZYK-FM 102.1 MHz, is the first FM radio station in the Philippines and sole FM station of the former Chronicle Broadcasting Network (CBN). DZYK-FM was founded in 1956 and played the latest songs of that time. In 1957, CBN bought Alto Broadcasting System (ABS) resulting in a merger under the name Bolinao Electronics Corporation, later named ABS-CBN Broadcasting Corporation in 1967. Staffed by eight DJs, DZYK-FM 102.1 MHz was popularized to listeners in Greater Manila area. DZYK-FM remained as the FM radio station of ABS-CBN until the station was forced off the air by Ferdinand Marcos under martial law. In 1968, DZYK-FM moved to its current permanent frequency of 101.9 MHz, and changed its call letters to DZMM-FM. =DWWK-FM/OK 101 (1973‚Äì1986)= When martial law was declared in 1972, DZMM-FM along with ABS-CBN's two TV channels and six AM radio stations in Manila were shut down under strict censorship. The FM station was taken over by Roberto Benedicto and changed to DWOK-FM (as OK 101.9) of the Banahaw Broadcasting Corporation, which had aired in 1973 as DWWK, a jazz format radio station. It was staffed by Jing Magsaysay, Wayne Enage, Ed Picson, Dody Lacuna, Ronnie Malig, Pinky Villarama and Ronnie Quintos. DWOK trailblazed another first in the Philippine radio industry at that time as the first AM-formatted FM station which features news, public service programs, and music from the 1950s to the 1970s. Helen Vela also came to the station in 1984 with her counselling program Lovingly Yours, Helen. However, DWOK, DWAN (formerly known as DWWA) and BBC-2 had been dissolved since the government-controlled radio and TV stations were stormed by reformist rebels. It was given back to ABS-CBN after the 1986 EDSA Revolution, and returned on the air as DWKO ‚Äî at that time it was on test broadcast. =Knock Out Radio (1986‚Äì1987)= The fall of the Marcos Regime in the immediate aftermath of the People Power Revolution had paved the way for the return of ABS-CBN in the Philippine broadcasting scene. In July 1986, then newly formed Presidential Commission on Good Governance turned two radio stations, DWWW (under 630 kHz) and DWOK-FM, over to ABS-CBN from Marcos ally Roberto Benedicto. DWOK (the former FM station of Benedicto-owned Banahaw Broadcasting Corporation) changed its callsign to DWKO and resumed broadcasting four months later. Lito Balquiedra Jr., Vice-President for Radio, spearheaded the return of the giant network to the local broadcasting scene. The station's former disc jockey Peter Mus√±gi (then known as Peter Rabbit has worked Knock-Out Radio 101.9 and Zoo FM 101.9) has been the network's voice- over since the reopening in 1986. The slogan of the station was \\"Panalo Ka Talaga!\\", voiced by Peter Mus√±gi. The network started recruiting both experienced and new employees and DJs. Prior to the adoption of masa format, all FM stations are English based with the use of the English language during the 1980s and 1990s. After days of careful planning and almost three months of test broadcast which took place on July 16 that year along with sister stations DZMM 630 (which it began broadcasting the following week) and the parent station ABS-CBN Channel 2 (which it began broadcasting in September of the same year), DWKO was born ‚Äì the first-ever FM radio station with an AM format, carrying the name Knock-Out Radio 101.9 on September 14, 1986 (the same day the re-airing of ABS-CBN on channel 2) and playing the hits during that time. Since then, KO-Radio has aired Pinoy hits from singers of the 1970s and 1980s such as Rico J. Puno, Yoyoy Villame, APO Hiking Society. The station also debuted the songs of Original Pilipino Music (OPM) stars like Gary Valenciano, Regine Velasquez, Janno Gibbs and Donna Cruz, as well as Filipino Christmas songs. DWKO-FM ended its broadcast on February 28, 1987, and became one of the shortest-lived iterations aired on the station in a span of almost 5 months. During that time, the station operated daily from 5:00 am to 2:00 am. =Zoo FM (1987‚Äì1989)= On March 1, 1987 (following The Star Network era), the station reformatted as Zoo FM 101.9 (DZOO-FM; read as D-Z-double O-FM), which is best known for its diamond logo and a slightly uptrend pop sound led to the introduction of OPM and disco hits. The jingles used for the station back then were produced by JAM Creative Productions. Manned by a group of eight DJs (most notably, George Boone, Jeremiah Jr., Bob Curry, Bill O'Brien, Andy Santillan, aka Dave Ryan, later known as \\"The Unbeatable\\", and Joe Monkey), the slogan of the station was Hayop Talaga!. It also served as the home of OPM stars like Gary V, Randy Santiago, Regine Velasquez, Ogie Alcasid, Sharon Cuneta, and others. Due to its popularity, Zoo FM 101.9 heavily played OPM songs after the implementation of Executive Order No. 255 by President Corazon Aquino and became a trend among listeners, because Zoo FM is being competed with other FM stations such as The Giant 97.1 WLS-FM (now Barangay LS 97.1), 99.5 RT (now 99.5 Play FM), Magic 89.9, 89 DMZ (now Wave 89.1), NU 107 (now Wish 1075) and more. But because of massive competition from the rival WLS, Zoo FM decided to end its broadcast, having faltered from WLS's dominant listener ratings (and with GMA-7's TV ratings uprisings, despite the uprising being cut short in 1988 by the resurgence of ABS-CBN and the network being catapulted to first place in the TV industry) in January 1989. Two years later, DZOO-FM ended its broadcast on the night of July 15, 1989 (at 12:00 mn). Listeners and DJs bade goodbye to Zoo FM which gave its final broadcast, and with the last song, \\"Farewell\\" by Raymond Lauchengco. =Radio Romance (1989‚Äì1996)= On the morning of July 16, 1989 (at 6:00 am), it reformatted again and this time it became popularly known as 101.9 Radio Romance, hence the initials RR, playing all easy-listening love songs manned by all-female jocks such as Amy Perez (fewer male jocks are also added), and also became the first FM station, whose musical playlists were originated from compact discs (a technological innovation then). That year also signaled the station's first nationwide reach when 103.1 MHz Baguio simulcasted its signals, ensuring travelers from Manila to as far north as Ilocos Sur, uninterrupted listening of its programs, until it eventually simulcasted via satellite to other stations across the country in the early '90s. At the same time, OPM songs are also played on DWRR to produce its weekend OPM program every Sunday. \\"Radio Romance\\" became a title of the movie and a theme song of the station composed by Jose Mari Chan during its popularity. On April 28, 1996 Radio Romance signed off due to its station reformat. =WRR 101.9 (1996‚Äì2009)= On April 29, 1996, DWRR relaunched itself into a mainstream pop music station branded WRR 101.9 and it became the first FM radio station to be fully broadcast in Filipino language in order to compete with rival English- language FM stations such as GMA Network's Campus Radio 97.1 WLS, Magic 89.9 and 99.5 RT. Before the end of that year, all ABS-CBN FM stations started to broadcast in their native languages switching from English. Initially, its slogan was All the Hits, All the Time!. On November 2, 1998, WRR adapted the tagline For Life! (which is based from a co-owned station in Cebu), giving life to listeners with entertainment. In late 1999, DWRR transmitting equipment moved from ABS-CBN Broadcast Center which was used before martial law to the new transmitter tower at the Eugenio Lopez Center in Antipolo City due to the upgrading of the Millennium Transmitter. In July 2005, the WRR brand was dropped from the name and adapted the slogan Alam Mo Na 'Yan! (You Already Know It!), lasting from July 2005 to October 2008. In November 2008, the station changed its slogan to Bespren! (Bestfriend!). The station had its last broadcast under the 101.9 For Life! brand on September 19, 2009 and underwent a transition period playing automated music in preparation for a relaunch of DWRR-FM's new branding on October 1, 2009. However, due to the onslaught of Typhoon Ondoy (Ketsana) in Manila, the station rebrand was postponed for almost a month. For the time being, DWRR-FM temporarily went under the name \\"ABS-CBN 101.9 FM\\" or simply \\"101.9\\". The postponed relaunch was set on November 4, 2009. Prior to the announcement of the launch date, the station's DJs began providing live spiels again every top of the hour since October 12. But as part of the ongoing transition, the jocks never mentioned its former brand or slogan & the format of the station's SMS syntax except the text hotline itself. =Tambayan (2009‚Äì2013)= The former logo of Tambayan 101.9 from November 4, 2009-May 2013. Some logos used in Tambayan TV when the station was named as 101.9 On November 4, 2009 at 9:00 pm, there was a broadcast about the history of DWRR. Following that, the station was relaunched as Tambayan 101.9 (tambayan is the Tagalog word for hangout) starting with the theme song & live debut at a venue in Makati. Tambayan launched its video streaming called Tambayan TV where DJs are seen live from the booth. In between songs playing, some information plugs were seen (such as Tambayan's Slumbook). Just like DZMM Teleradyo, plugs were also aired during commercial gaps. Tambayan TV is aired 24 hours over the Internet. The station was also launched via HD Radio technology. In May 2013, ABS-CBN Corporation decided to drop the Tambayan brand and revert to the name \\"ABS-CBN 101.9 FM\\" or \\"101.9\\", due to management decision and signifying another rebranding of the station. =MOR For Life! (2013‚Äì2020)= The former logo of MOR 101.9 from January 1, 2014 up to 2017. On July 8, 2013 at midnight, 101.9 FM rebranded as MOR 101.9 My Only Radio For Life!.101.9 For Life launches new radio station jingle ABS-CBN News. Retrieved July 7, 2013 Regular programming began at 5:00am, with Joco Loco, Maki Rena & Eva Ronda as the first jocks to go on board. DJs from WRR 101.9 For Life! (Toni, China Heart, Reggie Valdez, Martin D. and Geri) were still part of the on-air team, as well as DJs from the former Tambayan 101.9 roster (Charlie, Jasmin, Arnold Rei, Bea, ChaCha (Czarina Marie Balba) and Onse (Onse Tolentino)). The rebranding of this station created a unified brand for ABS-CBN's FM radio stations nationwide, which are under the MOR station brand. This also reverts the slogan of the station's second incarnation of \\"For Life\\" which was first used during the WRR 101.9 For Life! era. At the same time, the station pioneered the face of drama broadcasting on the FM band by launching the daily drama anthology program Dear MOR. In June 2018, MOR Manila and its regional stations announced its rebrand as MOR Philippines. The new brand will connect 101.9 and its provincial stations with unified program brands and strong music choices; thus, the new tagline \\"One Vibe, One Sound.\\" Under the new system, some of MOR Manila's shows may be converted as national programs; but plans have not yet been discussed at this moment. National programming blocks began in its first phase on August 11, 2018, with the station's launch of Dyis Is It and MOR Presents with David Bang. On June 1, 2019, MOR 101.9 video streaming is seen on Sky Cable Channel 239 replacing Sony Channel Asia. It can be seen on Channel 240 (MOR 97.1 Cebu) and Channel 241 (MOR 103.1 Baguio). On March 2020, the station implements a scaled-down programming operation due to the present situation and conditions affecting the radio station's staff due to the enhanced quarantine against COVID-19. On the same day, the station began its hookup with the sister AM-station DZMM Radyo Patrol 630. Shutdown On May 5, 2020, the station signed off together with sister stations ABS-CBN, S+A, and DZMM due to cease and desist order of the National Telecommunications Commission ordering the network to permanently suspend operations after its legislative franchise expired. DJ Jhai Ho was the last DJ to go onboard, with his emotional valedictory message, with an underscore of Yeng Constantino's \\"Salamat\\", as the last song to be broadcast by the station; after that, the MOR Philippines station ID was played for the last time before signing off. On July 15, 2020, ABS-CBN announced the painful pronouncement to its employees that the company will go into retrenchment on August 31, laying-off much of its employees after its new franchise was denied by the House of Representatives. The following day in an episode of Failon Ngayon sa TeleRadyo, DJ Chacha, anchor of Dear MOR and formerly Heartbeats confirmed that the radio station along with other regional MOR stations will fold on the said retrenchment date.

This theme was later reused - albeit with altered lyrics, by the Catholic Media Network's Spirit FM stations from 2002 to 2012, sung by local band Tellayouthska. *In 1998, the \\"For-Life\\" jingle was launched. This was sung by Jolina Magdangal-Escueta and Jimmy Bondoc. This also had other shorter versions by various recording artists, having used until March 6, 2004. The first verse would later be reused in the current MOR jingle with altered lyrics. A re-hashed version was used from March 7, 2004 to September 18, 2005, performed by Heart Evangelista-Escudero and Erik Santos. Even American singer Patti Austin sang a shorter version of the \\"For-Life\\" jingle. *On September 19, 2005 the station launched a new and hip station jingle courtesy of Vhong Navarro on vocals using the slogan Alam Mo Na 'Yan! in the lyrics, used until August 31, 2007. *On September 1, 2007, the last \\"For-Life\\" jingle under the station's independence was launched, composed by Raimund Marasigan of Sandwich (former drummer of The Eraserheads) and interpreted by Itchyworms and by Yeng Constantino-Asuncion of Pinoy Dream Academy, used until September 19, 2009. *As Tambayan 101.9, the 1st version jingle was popularized by Skabetche Band and Empoy, used from November 4, 2009 to December 2010. *In December 2010, the theme was remixed and sung by the DJs for the station's Christmas 2010 jingle, being used again in Christmas 2011. *The 2nd version of the Tambayan jingle, which is a DJ-like mixed jingle, was used by the station from January 2011 to February 14, 2012 which was done by the station's resident DJ Martin D. *The 3rd version of the Tambayan jingle was a remix of the 2nd jingle which was heard on the Budots Budots program. This was the jingle used by the station from February 15 to March 4, 2012, hence it was short-lived. *The 4th and final version of the Tambayan 101.9 jingle is sung by Jovit Baldivino, Yeng Constantino-Asuncion, Gloc-9 and Phylum Band, and is used from March 5, 2012 to May 17, 2013, when ABS-CBN ended the station's independence for its upcoming MOR branding. *The 2nd Tambayan Christmas jingle was sung by KZ Tandingan featuring Loonie, used from November 24, 2012 to January 6, 2013. This is their last Christmas jingle under the station's independence. = As an MOR station = *On July 8, 2013, together with the rebranding of the station to MOR, a new jingle & music video was launched on ASAP 18 and was performed by various artists. The current version of the new jingle was recorded by Toni Gonzaga-Soriano, Vice Ganda, and Daniel Padilla; and was adopted by all MOR stations. The jingle was used until August 7, 2016, in favor of a romance-themed version recorded by Bailey May and Ylona Garcia and used extensively on the Manila station from the day after, with provincial stations using it on an occasional basis; yet the management reverted to the original 2013 version of the jingle by June 4, 2017, with the newer rendition being used only as an alternate. Portions of the jingle contain elements from the first For Life jingle for its first verse with altered lyrics and the pre-2013 MOR jingle when it was a group of regional stations. On July 21, 2018, with the upcoming relaunch as MOR Philippines, a new network jingle was introduced during its Pinoy Music Awards, combining the 2013 jingle with David Bang's MOR regional stingers. Its new jingle was launched at noon of September 24, 2018. Toni, Vice, and Daniel were reintroduced to sing the revamped jingle. *The 1st version of the MOR Christmas jingle is sung by Angeline Quinto and Juris, used from November 30, 2013 to January 2014. *The 2nd version of the MOR Christmas jingle is sung by Michael Pangilinan and Morissette Amon, used from November 17, 2014 to January 2015. *The MOR Valentine's Day Jingle is used every February since 2015. *The 3rd version of the MOR Christmas jingle is sung by Marlo Mortel and Janella Salvador, used from November 28, 2015 to January 2016. *The 4th version of the MOR Christmas jingle is sung by CJ Navato and Kristel Fulgar, used from November 27, 2016 to January 2017.

Life Th√ºmmel was born on 27 May 1738 at Sch√∂nefeld near Leipzig. Educated at Ro√üleben, Thuringia and the University of Leipzig, where he studied law, from 1761 until 1783 he held various offices in the ducal court of Saxe-Coburg, where he became privy councillor and minister of state. He wrote a comic prose epic, Wilhelmine, oder der verm√§hlte Pedant (1764); and Die Inoculation der Liebe (1771), a tale in verse. His most famous work is his Reise in die mitt√§glichen Provinzen van Frankreich im Jahre 1785‚Äì1786 (1791‚Äì1805), a \\"sentimental journey\\" in ten volumes, in which the influence of Wieland is unmistakable. Schiller, in his essay \\"On Na√Øve and Sentimental Poetry\\", found this work wanting in aesthetic dignity yet allowed that the keen knowledge of men and things it displays makes it a valuable contribution to literature. Th√ºmmel's other writings are not as well known. Th√ºmmel retired in 1783 and died in Coburg on 26 October 1817. Works His collected works were published in Leipzig in eight volumes (1811‚Äì1839), with a biography by Johann E. von Gruner in volume 8 (1820), and again in 1856.

Before starting Bethlehem, Bartsch and Matton used to play in a German thrash metal band Morbid Vision. Many of their lyrics revolve around sickness, morbidity, suicide, death and madness, and may to some extent be personal to the band. History Bethlehem was formed by J√ºrgen Bartsch in 1991. They recorded a few demos in the early 90s before releasing their debut album \\"Dark Metal\\" in 1994, which featured Andreas Classen on vocals. On their second full-length album Dictius Te Necare (Latin: You must/should kill yourself), Classen was replaced with Rainer Landfermann on vocals (known as the bass player in the German death metal band Pavor). Landfermann's vocals were particularly extreme, described by critics and fans alike as \\"one of the sickest and most extreme voices you'll ever hear from a human being\\". On S.U.I.Z.I.D. his place is taken by Marco Kehren from the band Deinonychus. Guido Meyer de Voltaire, the vocalist from Schatten aus der Alexander Welt and Mein Weg, is also well-known with his band Aardvarks. Andreas Classen, vocalist on Dark Metal also did vocals for Shining (primary vocalist Niklas Kvarforth also provided vocals for Bethlehem on the album A Sacrificial Offering to the Kingdom of Heaven in a Cracked Dog's Ear), Dark Creation (German band), Paragon Belial, Made of Iron, Kadathorn, Darkened Nocturn Slaughtercult. Over the years Bethlehem modernized their style and so the early black and doom metal influences are now hardly present, the band favouring a more Neue Deutsche H√§rte (New German Hardness) and electronic approach. In 1998 Bethlehem collaborated on the soundtrack for the American underground movie Gummo with the tracks \\"Schuld Uns'res Kn√∂cherigen Faltpferds\\" and \\"Verschleierte Irreligi√∂sit√§t\\".

V. Desani, was a British-Indian novelist, poet, and social commentator. He was born in Kenya, reared in India and came of age in Britain. An adept in ancient Eastern spiritual and mental-culture traditions, Desani was best known as the author of All About H. Hatterr (1948), a comic farce which lampooned Anglo and Indian culture, spiritual traditions and an admixture of the two. An epic-like poetic work, Hali (1950), and its subsequent pairing with his short stories, Hali and Short Stories (1991) made up most of his fiction. Other writings included news reporting, humour and commentary. In later years Desani taught Eastern Philosophy in the United States. Biography =Early life= Born in Nairobi, Kenya, the son of a well-off wood merchant, he grew up in Sindh, now part of Pakistan. He described himself as a rebellious child who ran away from home three times and, at the age of 13, was expelled from school as unteachable. The third time he left home, he made it to England where, at 17, he connected with British gentry. He was personally recommended by George Lansbury, Deputy Leader of the Labour Party in the British House of Commons, for admission as a reader to the prestigious British Museum Library. By the age of 25, Desani had become a foreign correspondent for The Times of India, Reuters and the Associated Press. He was sponsored by the Central India Railway as a lecturer on antiquities. A circular from the Director of Education, Delhi, stressed the great value of his lectures. It was during this period that he changed the spelling of his last name from Dasani to Desani and, like many writers of the day, started going by his initials: G.V. He returned to Britain at the beginning of World War II. Waiving their academic requirements, the Imperial Institute, the Council for Adult Education in the British Armed Forces, the London County Council, the Wiltshire County Council, and the Royal Empire Society accepted him as a lecturer and teacher. =Career= Desani lectured at many well-known educational and research institutes including New College, Oxford, Rhodes House, Trinity College, Cambridge, and the Psychologisch Laboratorium of the University of Amsterdam. He was also a commentator for the BBC. The BBC's The Listener welcomed him as \\"... a broadcasting discovery ... a voice singular in its beauty.\\" Many of his public lectures were sponsored by the British Ministry of Information. By the end of the war he had become a media personality. Recalling his rise as an orator in Britain, Anthony Burgess writes that Desani demonstrated \\"... in live speech the vitality of the British rhetorical tradition, brilliant in Burke and Macaulay, decadent in Churchill, now dead.\\" =All About H. Hatterr and Hali= It was, however, the publication in Britain in 1948 of his poly- colloquial, multi-cultural novel, All About H. Hatterr, that attracted wide attention on both sides of the Atlantic and in India. T. S. Eliot said of it, \\"... In all my experience, I have not met with anything quite like it. It is amazing that anyone should be able to sustain a piece of work in this style and tempo at such length.\\" All About H. Hatterr broke publicity records for a book published that year (Writer, London). The tone of the reviewers was of surprise and awe (Newsweek, 1951). In the United States, too, Hatterr earned high critical acclaim. Orville Prescott, in his Book of the Week review, in The New York Times, said of it, \\"... To describe a rainbow to a child born blind would not be much more difficult than to describe the unique character of All About H. Hatterr ... as startling as a unicorn in the hall bedroom. Reading it issues dizzy spells, spots before the eyes, consternation, and even thought.\\" Saul Bellow, also in The New York Times, chose it for his 1952 Book of the Year selection, (calling it) the book \\"I love\\". Decades later Salman Rushdie wrote \\"Hatterr's dazzling, puzzling, leaping prose is the first genuine effort to go beyond the Englishness of the English language.\\" Desani's \\"\\"HALI: A Play,\\"\\" was published in 1950. It was described as \\"completely different from Hatterr,\\" by T.S. Eliot who ‚Äì along with E.M. Forster ‚Äì provided a brief forward to the 30-plus page booklet. Eliot called Hali's imagery \\"... often terrifyingly effective.\\" while Forster wrote, \\"... It keeps evoking heights above the Summit-City of normal achievement.\\" Other comments were less positive. Eliot added in his Forward, \\"Hali is not likely to appeal quickly to the taste of many readers.\\" Forster commented, \\"It depends upon a private mythology ‚Äì a dangerous device.\\" Hali and Collected Stories was published in 1991. =Spiritual Quest= After his return to India in 1952, he spent nearly 15 years in intense 'spiritual' pursuits. Under guidance of numerous gurus and sadhus, who he sought out based on referrals and reputation, he practiced many forms of mantras and tantric yoga, and experimented with several schools of Hindu and Buddhist thought. According to papers he presented in India, Burma and the U.S., his quest often consisted of living in remote, primitive conditions. His sƒÅdhanƒÅ's varied. Sometimes he would be holed up in a country house for weeks or months; in another case he was told to walk through a particularly dangerous forest area. Later, he spent several months in intense meditation at a Zen monastery in Japan. Despite this intense study, he once said that he did not \\"have a Guru franchise\\". In 1960, at the invitation of the Burmese Government, he devoted a year to the Pandit√£r√£ma Shwe Taung Gon Meditation Center in Rangoon (now Yangon) in the practice and study of ancient Theravada Buddhist techniques. At the conclusion, he was selected by the Burmese Foreign Office and the Ministry of Religion to address a specially-invited audience of the Diplomatic Corps in Rangoon on Buddhist ethics and techniques. Justice U Chan Htoon, an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of Burma and the President of the World Fellowship of Buddhists presided. =Social and Political Commentary= From 1962‚Äì67, as a special contributor to the Illustrated Weekly of India (The Times of India group), he published approximately 170,000 words of fiction, contemporary comment, criticism, book reviews and ‚Äì before leaving for the United States, for a year and a half ‚Äì wrote an unsigned weekly page called \\"Very High and Very Low\\". At that time, he was one of the most widely read and influential journalists in India. Some of his material was requested for publication in Britain and the States by, among others, the Transatlantic Review and The Noble Savage edited by Saul Bellow. He was critical of certain policies promoted by Mahatma Gandhi. Unlike Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru, who urged Indians not to help the British war effort, Desani encouraged his fellow Hindus to resist German and Japanese enslavement. =Philosophy Professorship= In 1967, based on his 15-year-long devotion to spiritual studies, he became a Fulbright Program lecturer on Oriental Philosophy at the University of Texas, Austin. Eventually, he chose to stay and become a tenured professor in the UT Philosophy Department. During the Spring breaks, he taught Theravada Buddhism. In the early 1970s, he became an American citizen. After he retired, in 1978, his health began to fail and he was looked after by some of his former students. He died at the age of 91, at a private home that had been converted to an ashram, near Fort Worth. Bibliography Novel(s) *All About H.

The lake, oriented in the Dinaric direction from northwest to southeast, is present for the most part of the year. When full, it is the largest lake in the country. The plain is surrounded by the Javornik Hills () to the south and Slivnica () to the north, both belonging to Dinaric Alps. The area of the lake mainly reaches , but can reach up to and the surface level varies from to above sea level.

The climate in the area is continental, with a mean temperature of and the annual precipitation about . The largest settlement at the border of the lake is Cerknica, located north of the lake. Various watersports, including rowing, are popular on the lake.  Intermittent behavior  The lake, which under ordinary conditions has an area of about and a mean depth of , communicates through a number of openings with a series of subterranean reservoirs or caverns, some of which are above the lake level in the surrounding hills. In the summer, when the rainfall is slight, the lake is completely drained into the reservoirs lying below its level, and its bed is speedily covered with rich vegetation. With the returning heavy rains in autumn, the surrounding higher reservoirs are filled and discharge suddenly through the subterranean passages into the lake, so that the latter very rapidly regains its ordinary volume and may even inundate the surrounding country. The changes in level are, however, very irregular. Sometimes the lake does not disappear for several years, and it can remain dry for over a year, as it did in 1834‚Äì35. It is rich in fish, which disappear and return with the water.  Research history  Illustration of Lacus Cirknicensis potiora phaenomena published in Acta Eruditorum, 1689 Strabo in his Geography mentions a \\"marsh called Lugeon\\" (helos Lougeon kaloumenon) which has been identified with Lake Cerknica,Strabo, Strabo, Geography, v. 7, ch. 5 at perseus.tufts.edu Lougeon being Strabo's Greek rendition of a local toponym, perhaps of Illyrian origin. It is Romanized as Lugeum. In November 1687 the Carniolan polymath Johann Weikhard von Valvasor described the lake in his letter to the Royal Society, an excerpt of which was published in the Society's Philosophical Transactions in December that year. He proposed a model of filling and emptying the lake, based on Cartesian mechanics. The first to accurately describe the functioning of Lake Cerknica was Tobias Gruber in 1781, followed in 1784 by Belsazar Hacquet.

Cooperative former Nazis, such as Wernher von Braun and Reinhard Gehlen, were occasionally given state protection in return for valuable information or services. At the time, Gehlen had been chief of the German Federal Intelligence Service or Bundesnachrichtendienst (federal intelligence agency), founder of the Gehlen Org, \\"a true life version of ODESSA\\" network, which helped exfiltrate Nazis from Europe. Other Nazis used ratlines to escape post-war Europe to places such as South America.Parton, Nigel R. \\"Book Review: The Beast Reawakens.\\" European History Quarterly 30, no. 2 (2000): 291‚Äì294.Mendes, Alfred. \\"Bosnia, Bohemia & Bilderberg: The Cold War Internationale.\\" In Common Sense: Journal of the Edinburgh Conference, vol. 16, pp. 5‚Äì15. 1994. In response, Nazis hunters sought out fugitives on their own or formed groups, such as the Simon Wiesenthal Center. Methods used by Nazis hunters include offering rewards for information, reviewing immigration and military records, and launching civil lawsuits. In later decades, Nazis hunters found greater cooperation with Western and South American governments and the state of Israel. By the end of the 20th century, pursuit of former Nazis declined, because most of the generation active in Nazi leadership had died. Notable targets The Simon Wiesenthal Center publishes an annual report on Nazi war criminals. Some notable targets of Nazis hunters have included: *Klaus Barbie, the \\"Butcher of Lyon\\", was extradited from Bolivia to France in 1983, after earlier attempts by Serge and Beate Klarsfeld to track him. Until Bolivia's transition to democracy, he had been protected by the US and German intelligence services for anti-Soviet intelligence purposes, and employed by the Bolivian army under an alias. Sentenced to life imprisonment in 1987, he died in 1991. *Herberts Cukurs, the \\"Butcher of Riga\\", was assassinated by Mossad agents in Montevideo, Uruguay, in 1965. *Adolf Eichmann was pursued by Wiesenthal before being captured and smuggled from Argentina in 1960 by the Israeli spy agency, Mossad, and was tried in Israel, after which he was executed. *Boƒºeslavs Maikovskis, a Latvian Nazi collaborator, was pursued to Mineola, New York by Welles. Maikovskis eventually emigrated to West Germany in 1987, where he was found unfit to stand trial due to age. *Josef Mengele, the \\"Angel of Death\\", was sought in various South American countries by Mossad, Wiesenthal, and the Klarsfelds. He evaded capture until his accidental death in Brazil in 1979; his remains were identified in 1985. *Erich Priebke, an SS officer responsible for the mass murder of Italian civilians, was interviewed openly in Argentina in 1994, by ABC Primetime Live host Sam Donaldson. He was subsequently extradited to Italy and, in 1998, sentenced to house arrest for life. *Eduard Roschmann was sought by Wiesenthal in Argentina. The Argentine government made plans for his extradition public in 1977, allowing him to escape to Paraguay. He apparently died the same year, but Wiesenthal was sceptical that the body was Roschmann's. *Dinko ≈†akiƒá was pursued to Argentina by Zuroff. Making no attempt to hide, he made several media appearances before being extradited to Croatia in 1998, where he was sentenced to 20 years, and died in 2008. *Josef Schwammberger was traced to Argentina by the Simon Wiesenthal Center and Welles. Extradited to West Germany in 1990, he was sentenced to life imprisonment in 1992 and died in 2004. *Franz Stangl, the commandant of the Sobib√≥r and Treblinka extermination camps, was caught by Wiesenthal in S√£o Paulo in 1967. He was extradited to Germany in 1970 and sentenced to life in prison, where he died the following year. *Gustav Wagner, the \\"Wolf\\", was exposed by Wiesenthal in Brazil in 1978. He was arrested, but Brazil refused to extradite him to West Germany. Wagner apparently committed suicide in S√£o Paulo in 1980.

Paradnye Seni (Principal Portal) of State Historical Museum (Moscow), frescoes by Foma Gavrilovich Toropov's artel, 1883. Dmitriy Yurievich Shemyaka (–î–º–∏—Ç—Ä–∏–π –Æ—Ä—å–µ–≤–∏—á –®–µ–º—è–∫–∞ in Russian) (died 1453) was the second son of Yury of Zvenigorod by Anastasia of Smolensk and grandson of Dmitri Donskoi. His hereditary patrimony was the rich Northern town Galich-Mersky. Shemyaka (1445, 1446‚Äì1447) was twice Grand Prince of Moscow. The causes of the Muscovite Civil War waged in the second quarter of the 15th century are still disputed. No small part, however, was played by Dmitri Donskoi's will, which ran contrary to Rurikid dynastic custom whereby the throne would pass from an elder brother to a younger one (agnatic seniority), rather than from father to son (primogeniture). The testament provided for the accession of his son, Vasily I, which was still in keeping with the tradition of lateral succession since Vasily was the eldest of his generation. In the event of Vasily having no surviving son at his death, his brother, Dmitry's second son, Yury of Zvenigorod, was to succeed as grand prince in Moscow. Upon Vasily I's death, however, Yury refused to come to Moscow and swear allegiance to his nephew, Vasily II, and claimed the throne himself in accordance with his right under the long-held custom of lateral inheritance. (He further claimed it was provided for in Dmitry's testament ‚Äì but this ignored the provision that voided Yury's succession in the event of Vasily I producing a son). Yury's son, Dmitry Shemyaka, actively participated in all of his father's incursions against Moscow, culminating in Yury's capture of Moscow and accession as grand prince in 1433. Yury of Zvenigorod died in Moscow in 1434. Meeting of Shemyaka with Vasily II after the Latter's Blinding. After Yury's death, Shemyaka continued to press his branch's claim to the grand princely throne, and was seldom at peace with Vasily II. Initially, Dmitry and his younger brother Dmitry Krasnyi concluded an alliance with Vasily against their elder brother Vasily Kosoy, who had proclaimed himself grand prince. They succeeded in driving Kosoy from Moscow and were rewarded with the towns of Uglich and Rzhev. The following year Shemyaka came to Moscow in order to invite Vasily II to his impending wedding with a princess of Yaroslavl, but was accused of siding with Kosoy and taken prisoner. He was released on the eve of a decisive clash between Vasily II and Vasily Kosoy. This action of Vasily II was successful - Shemyaka and his people did not help Vasily Kosoy and so he was completely defeated in the battle on the Cheryokha River in 1436, captured and blinded. Soon after, Shemyaka entered into an agreement with Vasily II, recognizing him as his suzerain (\\"older brother\\"). Next year, he was sent by Vasily II to expel the exiled Golden Horde Khan Ulugh Muhammad, but was defeated in the battle of Belyov. When Ulugh Muhammad in his turn besieged Moscow in 1439, Dmitry didn't sent his troops to Vasily and only the mediation of a Trinity hegumen could forestall a new civil war between the cousins. The two men maintained an uneasy peace for much of the next decade until 1445, when Vasily II was taken prisoner by Olug Moxammat after the Muscovite forces were surprised by the Tatar prince outside Suzdal, Shemyaka seized Moscow, had the recently released Vasily blinded and proclaimed himself the Grand Prince of Vladimir. He could claim this by right of lateral inheritance since his father had sat on the throne. (A prince was excluded from the succession (izgoi) if his father had not sat on the throne before him.) Shemyaka's lack of support among the Muscovite boyars forced him, however, to leave the city for Lake Chukhloma, but he continued to press his claim to the grand princely throne. Despite several peace treaties, Shemyaka continued to plot against his cousin. He suffered a series of defeats in 1450 and 1452 which forced him to seek refuge in Novgorod. There, on July 17, 1453, he was poisoned while eating a dinner of chicken in the Gorodishche, the princely compound south of the Market side of the city,Valentin Yanin, \\"Posmertnaia Sudba Dmitriia Shemiaki,\\" in Srednevekovyi Novgorod (Moscow: Nauka, 2004), 342. his cook having been bribed by Muscovite agents. Delighted at the news, Vasily II ennobled a herald who had first brought him the message of Shemyaka's death. Nikolai Karamzin famously wrote in his history that the grand prince showed \\"indecent joy\\" at the news of his rival's untimely demise. According to chronicle sources, Shemyaka was buried in the Church of St. George in the Yuriev Monastery south of Novgorod, Yanin, \\"Posmertnaia Sudba Dmitriia Shemiaki,\\" 342. however, twentieth-century archaeological excavations of the necropolis of the Cathedral of Holy Wisdom in the Novgorod Kremlin suggest that the prince was actually buried there and his grave has been misidentified since at least 1616 as that of Prince Fedor Yaroslavich (died 1233).Yanin, Nekropol' Novgorodskogo Sofiiskogo sobora: tserkovnaia traditsiia i istoricheskaia kritika (Moscow: Nauka, 1988), 89-113; Idem, \\"Posmertnaia Sudba Dmitriia Shemiaki\\", 337-346. In the aftermath of Shemyaka's murder, his wife and son fled Novgorod to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, where they were given Rylsk and Novgorod-Seversky in appanage. Shemyaka's male line died out by 1561, but there are many living descendants from his daughter's marriage to Prince Alexander Chertoryzhsky. Shemyaka's name survives in the Russian expression \\"Shemyakin sud\\" (\\"Shemyaka's Justice\\", \\"Shemyaka's Judgement\\"), which means hasty and unfair judgement. It comes from the 17th century literary work The Tale of Shemyaka's Judgement (see its translation here\\"The Judgment of Shemyaka\\"). However modern researchers question the identification of Dmitry Shemyaka with Judge Shemyaka in the tale.

Geographic range Amphisbaenids occur in South America, some Caribbean islands, and sub-Saharan Africa. Taxonomy One deep-branching and somewhat aberrant genus, Blanus, is native to Europe, and may represent a distinct family. More recent sources indeed place it in the family Blanidae. Description Members of the family Amphisbaenidae are limbless, burrowing lizards with carnivorous diets. As in other amphisbaenians, the body bears rings of scales, which gives amphisbaenids a worm-like appearance. The heads are massively constructed and used for burrowing, with powerful jaws and large, recurved teeth used for seizing prey. Some species have spade-like heads, while others have a narrow keel on their heads, and still others have a rounded skull. The eyes are highly reduced, while the ear bone, or stapes in the middle ear, is large and massive. Together with another bone, the extracollumella, the stapes detects vibrations caused by prey items, allowing amphisbaenids to hunt for invertebrates under ground. In this respect, apparently evolution exists convergent to the burrowing mammalian family Chrysochloridae, in which the malleus in the middle ear is greatly enlarged.

Biography John was born in Florence, the thirteenth child of the Habsburg Archduke Leopold of Tuscany and Maria Louisa of Spain. He was baptized with the name of John Baptist Joseph Fabian Sebastian, after the patron saint of the Tuscan capital. In 1790, Leopold succeeded his brother Joseph II as the Holy Roman Emperor and his family moved from the Grand Duchy of Tuscany to the Imperial court in Vienna. Only two years later, John's elder brother Francis II ascended the Imperial throne. Archduke John of Austria, John's native language was Italian, he learned to speak French and German fluently. Educated by the Swiss historian Johannes von M√ºller, he developed wide-ranging skills and interests, especially in the history and geography of the Alpine countries. =Military service= During the Napoleonic Wars, John was given command of the Austrian army in September 1800, despite his personal reluctance to assume the position. He showed personal bravery in the War of the Second Coalition, but his troops were crushed at the Battle of Hohenlinden on 3 December. Demoralized by defeat, the army nearly disintegrated in the subsequent retreat, which was only stopped by an armistice arranged on 22 December. After the Peace of Lun√©ville in 1801, Archduke John was made General Director of the Engineering and Fortification Service, and later commander of the Theresian Military Academy in Wiener Neustadt. In the War of the Third Coalition, John again fought the French and Bavarian forces. From 1805 he directed an able defence of several Tyrolean passes against the French and was awarded the Commander Cross of the Military Order of Maria Theresa. However, according to the Peace of Pressburg, Austria had to cede Tyrol and Vorarlberg to Bavaria. John remained obliged to Tyrol and maintained friendly contact with Baron Joseph Hormayr who forged a resistance movement against the Bavarian occupation. In 1808, John pressed for the creation of Tyrolean Landwehr forces based on the success of the Prussian Landwehr, which played a vital role in the Tyrolean Rebellion led by Andreas Hofer. At the commencement of the War of the Fifth Coalition in 1809 he became commander of the Army of Inner Austria, fighting against the French forces of Eug√®ne de Beauharnais in Italy. Under his command were the VIII Armeekorps led by Albert Gyulai and the IX Armeekorps headed by Albert's brother Ignaz Gyulai. After winning a significant victory at the Battle of Sacile on 16 April 1809, his army advanced almost to Verona. Having detached forces to besiege Venice and other fortresses, John's army was soon outnumbered by Eug√®ne's heavily reinforced host. Worse, news of the Austrian defeat at the Battle of Eckm√ºhl reached him and compelled him to order a retreat. Before withdrawing, he fought off Franco-Italian attacks at the Battle of Caldiero between 27 and 30 April. Attempting to blunt the Franco-Italian pursuit, he stood to fight on 8 May and was beaten at the Battle of Piave River. Trying to defend the entire border, he sent Ignaz Gyulai to defend Ljubljana (Laibach) in Carniola, while holding Villach in Carinthia with his own forces. Eug√®ne's pursuit overran the frontier defenses at the Battle of Tarvis and wrecked a column of hoped-for reinforcements at the Battle of Sankt Michael. Forced to flee northeast into Hungary, John offered battle again but was defeated at Raab on 14 June 1809. Ordered to join his brother Archduke Charles at the Battle of Wagram on 5 and 6 July, John's small army arrived too late to avert an Austrian defeat. His brother criticized him for tardiness. After the conclusion of the campaign, John again evolved plans for a widespread rebellion. However, upon the Treaty of Sch√∂nbrunn Austrian policies under Minister Klemens von Metternich sought a rapprochement to France. John's friend Baron Joseph Hormayr and other conspirators were arrested, the Archduke himself effectively was sidelined and retired to his estates in Thernberg. For many years thereafter, rumors dogged him that he and Hormayr had evolved plans to create a Kingdom of Rhaetia from out of Austrian and Bavarian Alpine possessions.The British and Foreign Review, vol. XIV, p. 437. These rumors increased his isolation from the Court.Treitschke, Heinrich. History of Germany in the Nineteenth Century, vol. 6, p. 508. =Post military= Tired of warfare, John turned away from the military and developed a great interest for nature, technology and agriculture. He collected minerals and was active as an alpinist and hunter in the Duchy of Styria. In his early days Archduke John and his brother Louis had the habit of travelling to France, where the latter married Madame de Gueroust. In 1815, on his visit to the United Kingdom, John received a Doctor honoris causa degree from the University of Edinburgh. In the history of Styria, he is remembered as a great modernizer and became an important figure of identification for Styrians. His proximity to the people is given evidence to by his many contacts with the common man, by wearing the local Tracht, the Steireranzug, and by collecting and promoting the material and spiritual culture of the country. In 1811, he founded the Joanneum Museum in Graz and the predecessor of Graz University of Technology. Some other foundations were initiated by him, such as the Styrian State Archive 1817, the Steierm√§rkisch- St√§ndische Montanlehranstalt, which was founded in 1840 in Vordernberg and later became the University of Leoben, the Styrian Society for Agriculture 1819, the Mutual Fire Insurance, the Styrian Building Society, the Landesoberrealschule in 1845 and the Society for Styrian History in 1850. His routing of the Austrian Southern Railway from Vienna to Triest over the Semmering Pass and through the Mura and M√ºrz valleys to Graz is particularly notable. The inheritance of his maternal uncle Duke Albert Casimir of Teschen enabled him to acquire a tin factory in Krems near Voitsberg and coal mines near K√∂flach, thereby he also became an industrialist. In 1840, he bought the Stainz dominion. He was already the lord of the Brandhof manor in Mariazell. In 1829, he married (1804-1885), the daughter of Jakob Plochl, postmaster of Aussee, and his wife Maria Anna Pilz, during a nocturnal ceremony in Brandhof. By this morganatic marriage, John was excluded from succession to the throne. Emperor Francis elevated Anna to a \\"Baroness of Brandhofen\\" in 1834 and in 1839 she gave birth to a son, Franz, the only child from the marriage. His descendants were styled \\"Counts of Meran\\" and \\"Barons of Brandhofen\\", Proprietors of Stainz and Brandhofen. John was also a passionate mountaineer in the Eastern Alps and attempted to be the first to climb the Gro√üvenediger. For that reason, the Erzherzog-Johann-H√ºtte (Adlersruhe) at the Grossglockner, and the Archduke John's Vanilla Orchid (Nigritella rubra subsp. archiducis- joannis), an orchid growing on mountain meadows, are named after him. =The toast to 'German unity' at Br√ºhl= On 4 September 1842, King Frederick William IV of Prussia inaugurated new construction to the as yet incomplete Cologne Cathedral.Treitschke, Heinrich. History of Germany in the Nineteenth Century, vol. 6, p. 505. Dignitaries from all over Germany and Austria were invited, including Archduke John and Chancellor Klemens Metternich. A farewell banquet was held in the Augustusburg Palace at Br√ºhl. There, Frederick William toasted all of the guests who had fought in the Napoleonic War, including Archduke John, \\"whose name exhilarates us as a fresh breeze from the mountains.\\"Treitschke, Heinrich. History of Germany in the Nineteenth Century, vol. 6, p. 508. As thanks to the King's kind words, the Archduke remarked, \\"As long as Prussia and Austria, and as long as the rest of Germany wherever the German tongue is heard, are united, we shall be steadfast as the rocks of our mountains.\\" However, the newspapers reported a different text of these remarks: \\"No longer shall be known Austria or Prussia, but a single Germany, lofty and sublime, Germany united and strong as her own mountains.\\"Treitschke, Heinrich. History of Germany in the Nineteenth Century, vol. 6, p. 509. This misquote was widely circulated among the reading public. =The Events of 1848= Even though the Archduke John did not consider himself a liberal, he promoted some liberal ideas. He was often in conflict with the rigid Habsburg court, especially because of his morganatic marriage, though he would never espouse rebellion. He had earned great recognition in the Styrian lands and, moreover, he gained general acceptance by his jovial manners and his marriage with a middle-class woman. The remarks he had reputedly made in favor of German unification at the banquet in 1842, added to circulating rumors that the Archduke was a man of political liberalism, even though he was kept very far from politics by the Court.Heinrich von Sybel, The Founding of the German Empire by William I., 1896. Volume I, page 163. Head of the Austrian Government Rioting in the streets of Vienna caused the Imperial household to flee to Innsbruck on 17 May 1848. Based on his reputation among the masses as a liberal and his personal character as a loyal prince of the reigning House, Archduke John was appointed on 16 June to be an effective viceroy in the absence of the Emperor. He was to both open the Constituent Diet and conduct the normal business of the government.William Cox, History of the House of Austria, 1905. Page 253. By a proclamation dated 25 June and written entirely by himself, the Archduke assumed his responsibilities and set the date to open the Diet for 22 July 1848. After he accepted the office of Regent of Germany on 5 July 1848 (see below), John maintained that he could not undertake his responsibilities in Frankfurt until he had fulfilled his responsibilities in Vienna. Therefore, he set out for Frankfurt on 8 July, the same day that the Austrian Ministry led by Baron Franz von Pillersdorf fell. After being appointed Regent in Frankfurt, he returned to Vienna on 17 July, and solemnly opened the Diet on 22 July as the Emperor's representative. Shortly thereafter, the Archduke resigned his official duties and departed for Frankfurt. This caused the Diet to petition for the Emperor's return to Vienna, and he did so on 12 August. Regent of Germany John's proclamation to the German people of 15 July 1848, after provisionally taking central control Karl Radnitzky, obverse. German double-headed Imperial Eagle. Upon the March Revolution of 1848, the Frankfurt Parliament discussed the appointment of an all-German government replacing the Federal Convention. On a proposal by the liberal politician Heinrich von Gagern, the assembly on 28 June 1848 voted for the establishment of a central authority (Provisorische Zentralgewalt) and on the next day a broad majority elected Archduke John regent of the realm (Reichsverweser). Archduke John accepted the nomination as head of the short-lived German Empire on 5 July 1848, and on 12 July the delegates of the Federal Convention, in response to public pressure, ceded their powers to him. On July 15, the day he left for Vienna, the Regent appointed the ministers Anton von Schmerling, Johann Gustav Heckscher and Eduard von Peucker to office, completed by Prince Carl of Leiningen as minister president and head of government. Nevertheless, his political office did not offer many opportunities, though all laws had to be signed by him. On 16 July 1848, War Minister von Peucker issued an order to all German Federal Army soldiers that, on 6 August 1848, they were to parade in honor of the Regent as the supreme commander of the Army in Germany. Upon his arrival in Vienna, the Archduke was greeted by Austrian War Minister Latour, who was quite upset with the interference of the provisional government in Austrian Army affairs. The whole Austrian Ministerial Council demanded action, and, as a result, the Archduke was forced to dispatch a formal complaint as Viceroy of Austria to himself as Regent of Germany.Heinrich von Sybel, The Founding of the German Empire by William I., 1891. Volume I, page 228. First attempts by the government to obtain supreme command of the German Federal Army faced entrenched resistance from the member states. To strengthen support, the left- wing politician Robert von Mohl joined the Leiningen Cabinet on 9 August. Leiningen himself resigned on 6 September, after the Frankfurt assembly rejected to ratify the armistice of Malm√∂, signed by Prussia during the First Schleswig War. Minister Anton von Schmerling acted as head of government, until from November 1848 the cabinet gradually lost the support of the centrist Casino faction and finally its majority in parliament. Schmerling was forced to resign and on 17 December, Archduke John had to appoint Heinrich von Gagern new minister president, though he opposed his 'Lesser German' ideas. By the terms of his Regency, Archduke John was forbidden to take part in the drafting of the Frankfurt Constitution, which was adopted on 28 March 1849 after lengthy negotiations led by Gagern. He pronounced against the strong position of Prussia and was determined to resign, but he was once more turned over by appeals from National Assembly President Eduard Simpson. When, in April 1849, King Frederick William IV of Prussia disappointed Gagern's hopes and openly rejected the Constitution, Archduke John remained passive and reminded his Prime Minister of the terms of his service as Regent, forbidding his interference in the process. Prime Minister Gagern handed in his resignation on 10 May. Prussia exerted pressure on the Regent to vacate the office that he had resigned, but the Archduke insisted that he would remain out of a sense of obligation, and had powerful backing from Austria's Prime Minister, Prince Schwarzenberg, who was eager to stifle Prussian ambitions in Germany. Nevertheless, he departed for a prolonged stay at the health resort of Bad Gastein. At this point, the National Assembly was reduced to a rump parliament led by radicals and in opposition to the Regent. The Regency existed in name only, though the Archduke continued formal correspondence with Vienna and Berlin as such. He finally was allowed to resign from his office on 20 December 1849. When Archduke John came back to Frankfurt on a visit in 1858, he openly regretted the failure of the German unification. Archduke John memorial in Graz =Mayor of Stainz= After nearly two years absence, the Archduke returned to Stainz, where he was elected the town's first mayor on 23 July 1850.

OAMC recipes usually involve freezing the meals until needed (termed freezer cooking).  Advantages  The primary advantage to this method of cooking is to save time over the course of the month by preparing meals ahead of time in one big cooking day. Preparation time for each meal is then cut down to reheating time only.Allen, Jody. Once A Month Cooking, 2014, Penguin This method also allows the home cook to save money by purchasing food items in bulk and taking advantage of sales at the market. Money is also saved on the family budget by having homemade convenience foods which can cut down on the frequency of fast food purchases or home dinner deliveries. Cooking ahead for the freezer can be a healthier alternative to purchasing prepackaged frozen meals at the grocery store, allowing the cook to choose wholesome ingredients and cater to individual food needs (allergies, sensitivities, etc.).

Kidd, Wild things: children's culture and ecocriticism (Wayne State University Press, 2004) The magazine offers feature articles and activities for children, ages 7 and up, in order to spark their interest in the outdoors and become more actively involved in the environment. The magazine's primary intention is to instill a passion for nature and promote activity outdoors.\\"About Us - National Wildlife Federation,\\" http://www.nwf.org/Kids/Ranger-Rick/Parents-and-Educators/About-Us.aspx. NWF also publishes two companion magazines, Ranger Rick Jr., which is aimed at ages 4‚Äì7, and Ranger Rick Cub, which is aimed at kids 0‚Äì4 years old. History Ranger Rick is the oldest and biggest children's nature magazine. The National Wildlife Federation first published the magazine as Ranger Rick's Nature Magazine, in January 1967 and readers have since passed on their interest to their own children. Publication information Ranger Rick has a circulation of 525,000, and an estimated 200,000 more children are exposed to the magazine by viewing pre-used copies. The magazine is published ten times a year by the National Wildlife Federation.National Science Resources Center (U.S.), Resources for teaching elementary school science (National Academies Press, 1996) The headquarters is in Reston, Virginia.

Features Each issue includes nonfiction articles about various environmental and animal topics, fictional story-like articles, and color photography throughout. Also included in the magazine are activities such as nature-themed games, activities that get children to actively learn more about their environments, riddles, and jokes. Most of the pages of the magazine feature multi-page photo stories of animals in their natural habitats. There are also illustrated stories, games, riddles, nature news, poetry, contests, and other features and columns. Ranger Rick is also the raccoon park ranger protagonist in the longstanding magazine feature Ranger Rick's Adventures (originally Ranger Rick and his Friends): an illustrated short story depicting Ranger Rick and his compatriots from Deep Green Wood exploring the world, often encountering threats to wildlife and environmental problems. Rick or any one of his friends, including Boomer Badger and Scarlett Fox, always finds a solution to whatever problem they encounter, thus encouraging children to do their part to protect the natural environment. December/January 2017 50th anniversary front cover Previous Ranger Rick magazines have featured these and other adventure stories: * recycling Christmas trees as a means of helping to provide proper habitat for fish (December 2009-January 2010); * Rick and Scarlett pulling an April Fool trick on Boomer Badger to get him away from his TV and computer and to get out into nature and fresh air (April 2009); * realizing the hazards of long fishing lines at sea (June and July 2008); illustrated by Rob Gilbert/Robby Gilbert. * struggling with alien species in the Florida Everglades (February 2007). illustrated by Rob Gilbert/Robby Gilbert. Characters The magazine is named after Ranger Rick, the raccoon protagonist who was first portrayed extinguishing a forest fire within the first issue. Ranger Rick and his friends, Scarlett Fox and Boomer Badger have many adventures together (as depicted in the magazine's regularly featured cartoon and fiction stories) and always look for new ways to help preserve the environment. In the classroom Ranger Rick is sometimes incorporated in elementary science classrooms to enhance the interest of environmental conservation in young children. Recent modifications Because technology has greatly influenced and impacted the lives of children today, Ranger Rick magazine has made modifications in order to appeal to the children, who are becoming increasingly distant in engaging in outdoor exploration. In order to inspire a new generation of conservationists, attracting young readers is essential to magazines that promote environmental awareness and preservation efforts.Brian Nearing, Linking kids to great outdoors: Agency starts magazine that aims to instill love of nature in the young (Times Union (Albany, NY), December 19, 2007). Ranger Rick magazine has realized this importance of maintaining natural interest in young people. The magazine has since made changes within their content in order to appeal to a changed generation of children, not only for profit, but for the future of conservational efforts. The magazine has made such changes, for example, in the amount of narrative, by replacing the majority of narrative pieces with more visually engaging elements. Also, the Ranger Rick character himself has had a transformation as he once appeared as an accurate representation of a real raccoon, to becoming a very unrealistic, cartoon-like figure. Some sections of the magazine have been modified as well, such as placing the text and titles in more modern and ideal locations to visually draw in readers.

The lustration was originally a sacrifice for expiation and purification offered by one of the censors in the name of the Roman people at the close of the taking of the census. The sacrifice was often in the form of an animal sacrifice, known as a suovetaurilia. These censuses were taken at five-year intervals, thus a lustrum came to refer to the five-year inter-census period. ' (from ', ) is a lustration or purification of the whole Roman people performed by one of the censors in the Campus Martius, after the taking of the census was over. As this purification took place only once in five years, the word lustrum was also used to designate the time between two lustra. The first lustrum was performed in 566 BC by King Servius, after he had completed his census, and afterwards it is said to have taken place regularly every five years after the census was over. In the earliest period of the republic, the business of the census and the solemnities of the lustrum were performed by the consuls. The first censors were appointed in 443 BC, and from this year down to 294 BC there had, according to Livy (X.47), only been 26 pairs of censors, and only 21 lustra, or general purifications, although if all had been regular, there would have been 30 pairs of censors and 30 lustra. Sometimes the census was not held at all, or at least not by the censors. The census might take place without the lustrum, and indeed two cases of this kind are recorded, in 459 and 214 BC. In these cases, the lustrum was not performed because of some great calamities that had befallen the republic. The time when the lustrum took place has been calculated. Six ancient Romulian years, of 304 days each, were, with the difference of two days, equal to five solar years of 365 days each, with one leap year of 366 days; or the six ancient years made 1824 days, while the five solar years contained 1826 days. The lustrum, or the great year of the ancient Romans, was thus a cycle, at the end of which, the beginning of the ancient year nearly coincided with that of the solar year. As the coincidence, however, was not perfect, a month of 24 days was interposed in every eleventh lustrum. It is highly probable that the recurrence of such a cycle or great year was, from the earliest times, solemnized with sacrifices and purifications, and that King Servius did not introduce them, but merely connected them with his census, and thus set the example for subsequent ages, which however, as we have seen, was not observed with regularity. The last lustrum was solemnized at Rome, in AD 74, in the reign of Vespasian. The word should not be confused with the homograph lustrum ( ), a haunt of wild beasts (and figuratively, a den of vice), plural lustra ( ).Oxford Latin Desk Dictionary (2005).

Released at the height of World War II, the film became one of Faye's highest-grossing pictures for Fox. The film tells the story of vaudeville performers in San Francisco, during the period of the 1915 Panama Pacific Exposition when Alexander Graham Bell made the first transcontinental phone call from New York City to San Francisco. The movie introduced the song \\"You'll Never Know\\", which was sung by Alice Faye and won an Academy Award for Best Original Song.

Nicknamed \\"Typhoon Tyson\\" by the press, he was regarded by many commentators as one of the fastest bowlers ever seen in cricketKilburn, p. 242.http://www3.sympatico.ca/qhokim/players/tyson.htm.p65-66, Clive Batty, The Ashes Miscellany, Vision Sports Publishing, 2006.Tom Graveney with Norman Giller, The Ten Greatest Test Teams, Sidgwick & Jackson, 1988. and took 76 wickets (18.56) in 17 Test matches. Tyson has the seventh-lowest bowling average in Test cricket for bowlers who have taken 75 wickets, and no bowler since Tyson has taken more than 20 wickets at a lower average. In 2007 a panel of judges declared him Wisden Leading Cricketer in the World for 1955 due to his outstanding tour of Australia in 1954‚Äì55 where his 28 wickets (20.82) was instrumental in retaining the Ashes. Tyson coached Victoria to two Sheffield Shield victories and later coached the Sri Lankan national cricket team.http://www.saxton.com.au/default.asp?sd8=187. He was a cricket commentator for 26 years on ABC and Channel Nine. Early life Tyson's mother was Violet Tyson (born 1892) and his father worked for the Yorkshire Dyeing Company, but died before his son was selected for England.p253, Tyson As a boy he played cricket with his elder brother David Tyson, who served in Australia during the war; at school he practised his run-up on the balcony. He was educated at Queen Elizabeth's Grammar School, Middleton, and studied English literature at Hatfield College, Durham University As a university graduate, Tyson was unusual among professional cricketers in the 1950s. He was a qualified schoolmaster and used to read the works of Geoffrey Chaucer, George Bernard Shaw and Virginia Woolf on tour. Instead of sledging batsmen he quoted Wordsworth: \\"For still, the more he works, the more/Do his weak ankles swell\\". He completed his National Service in the Royal Corps of Signals in 1952 as a Keyboard Operator and Cypher. Sportsmen were generally retained on headquarters staff and he played cricket for his platoon, squadron, regiment, area command and the Army.p31, Frank Tyson, The Cricketer Who Laughed, Stanley Paul, 1982 He served at the Headquarters Squadron 4 Training Regiment where he controlled the movements of men transferring in and out of Catterick, but not very well. He abhorred guns and when he took his rifle training he made sure that he always missed the target. In 1952‚Äì53 he worked felling trees, which John Snow regarded as an excellent exercise for developing the muscles of a fast bowler and attended Alf Gover's East Hill Indoor School for cricketers. In 1954‚Äì55 Gover covered the Ashes tour as a journalist and advised Tyson to use the shorter run-up from his league cricket days, which proved to be a turning point in the series. Early cricket career 1952‚Äì54 Before he became a professional cricketer Tyson played for Middleton in the Central Lancashire League, Knypersley in the North Staffordshire League, Durham University and the Army. Although invited for trials by Lancashire at Old Trafford he was turned down 'because he dipped at the knee', so he qualified for Northamptonshire in 1952 through residence. Tyson made his first-class debut against the Indian tourists in 1952, after his first ball the slips moved back an extra five yards and his first wicket was that of the Test batsman Pankaj Roy for a duck.Willis & Murphy, p. 89. Tyson's second first-class match was against the Australians in 1953. Richie Benaud was told that the unknown Tyson was a bowler fresh out of Durham University who would give them no trouble. They began to revise this estimation when they saw the wicket-keeper take position halfway to the boundary and young Tyson walked over to the sightscreen to begin his run up. The first ball ricocheted off the edge of Colin McDonald's bat to the boundary, the second trapped him lbw before he could play a stroke, the third was a bouncer that flew past Graeme Hole's nose and the fourth was a yorker that clean bowled Hole and sent his stumps cartwheeling over the wicket-keeper's head.p183, Bird, 1999. In 1954 at Old Trafford Tyson hit the sightscreen with the ball after it bounced once on the pitch. He is one of only four bowlers to have achieved this feat in the history of the game, the others being Charles Kortright, Roy Gilchrist and Jeff Thomson.. and he was given his county cap in the same year, his first full first-class season. Tyson reckoned that he received his Test call up when ex-England captains Gubby Allen and Norman Yardley saw him hospitalise Bill Edrich at Lords. Edrich, a noted hooker of fast bowling, mistimed his stroke due to the speed of the ball and his cheek bone was broken. The Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) were thereby convinced of the speed and hostility of Tyson's bowling and decided to take him to Australia.p8, Tyson He was selected to play for England against Pakistan at the Oval in 1954, taking 4‚Äì35 and 1‚Äì22 and making 3 runs in each innings batting at number eight, but Pakistan won the match by 24 runs thanks to the bowling of Fazal Mahmood. Although he batted at number eleven in league cricket \\"The Middleton groundsman was a fatalist. He used to start up the roller to refurbish the wicket when I went in to bat\\".p126, Frank Tyson, The Cricketer Who Laughed, Stanley Paul, 1982 Tyson worked on his batting and in 1954 \\"was building up a reputation as an all-rounder, scoring consistently with the bat\\",p19, E.W.

However, this did not develop as much as expected and he reverted to being a lower-order batsman. Tour of Australia and New Zealand 1954‚Äì55 Test Match Special commentary on the 1954‚Äì55 Ashes Series =First Test vs Australia at Brisbane= Tyson was chosen for the MCC tour of Australia in 1954‚Äì55, seen as a replacement for Fred Trueman who was controversially left behind. Freed of rationing Tyson increased his weight from to within a month of leaving the UK.p12, Tyson Hutton won the toss, put Australia in to bat and watched England drop 14 catches as Australia made 601/8 declared. Tyson was hit for 1/160 off 29 eight ball overs and England lost by an innings and 154 runs. Even so, Tyson hit Arthur Morris and Neil Harvey repeatedly with the ball and they were badly bruised. More to the point he bounced Ray Lindwall after the Australian all-rounder knocked several boundaries off the fast bowler on his way to 64 not out. Tyson also managed to run out Graeme Hole and made 37 not out in the second innings, which remained his highest Test score. =Second Test vs Australia at Sydney= Taking advice from his old coach Alf Gover, who was in Australia as a journalist, Tyson stopped using his laborious 38-yard run up and returned to a shorter run up used in league cricket with ten short then ten long final strides. With this he took 4/45 in the first innings, described vividly by Margaret Hughes: \\"Harvey received a beast of a ball from Tyson which spat up at him and splashed off his bat to Cowdrey\\". Ray Lindwall had bowled Tyson for a duck in the England first innings and was bounced again, so in the second innings the Australian fast bowler took his revenge: > \\"He let me have a very fast, short-pitched delivery...Instinctively I turned > a defensive back on the ball which skidded through and hit me a sickening > blow on the back of my head. I sank to the ground and as I slipped in and > out of consciousness, I was dimly aware of the players gathering round my > prostrate body. Indistinctly I heard my fellow batsman Bill Edrich saying: > 'My God, Lindy, you've killed him!'...I was very, very angry with Ray > Lindwall. And the whole of the Aussie team knew it...I would return the > bouncer with interest!\\"Frank Tyson, In the Eye of the Typhoon. Players did not wear protective helmets in the 1950s and he had to be helped off the field with a large bump on his head that was visible from the stands. He was taken to hospital for x-rays, but returned to loud applause only to be bowled by Lindwall for 9. The Australians needed 223 to win, but were afraid that Tyson would send down a barrage of fast, short-pitched bowling, but he was intelligent enough to bowl full-length deliveries that caught them unprepared.p131-132, Frank Tyson While Brian Statham bowled \\"up the cellar steps\\"p295-296, E. W. Swanton (ed), The Barclays World of Cricket, Collins, 1986. and into the wind Tyson tore down the slope from the Randwick End with \\"half a gale\\"p89, Swanton, 1977 behind him and bowled \\"as fast as man has ever bowled\\".David Frith, p421, Pageant of Cricket, The Macmillan Company of Australia Ltd, 1987. He took 6/85 in the innings and 10/130 in the match to give England a 38 run victory. The Australian captain Arthur Morris told the newspapers \\"Such fine bowling deserved to win\\".p134, Frank Tyson, In the Eye of the Typhoon. Peter Loader told Tyson, \\"you bowled like a 'Dingbat'\\" and the nickname 'Dingers' stuck\\".p135, Frank Tyson, In the Eye of the Typhoon. =Third Test vs Australia at Melbourne= The Third Test cemented the \\"Typhoon\\" reputation. He took 2/68 in the first innings and at the end of the fourth day Australia needed 240 to win and were 75‚Äì2, with Tyson on 1/11. Over 50,000 Australian fans came on the fifth day to see Neil Harvey and Richie Benaud knock off the remaining 165 runs, but what they got was 'the fastest and most frightening sustained spell of fast bowling seen in Australia'. as Tyson took 6/16 off 6.3 overs from the Richmond End. His 7/27 in the innings was his best Test innings analysis, the best by an England bowler in Australia since Wilfred Rhodes took 8/68 in 1903‚Äì04 and has not been bettered since. Australia added only 36 runs, were dismissed for 111 and England won by 128 runs. The game finished well before lunch and the caterers were left with thousands of unsold pies when the crowd deserted the ground. =Fourth Test vs Australia at Adelaide= The Ashes were decided at Adelaide, Hutton cunningly changing his bowlers to mix the pace of Tyson and Brian Statham with the spin of Bob Appleyard and Johnny Wardle. Tyson took 3/85 and 3/47 as Australia fell for 111 in the second innings to lose the Test by five wickets and the series 3‚Äì1. It was the first time England had won a series in Australia since 1932‚Äì33, they would not win another until 1970‚Äì71. =Fifth Test vs Australia at Sydney= Despite three days lost to rain an aggressive England team almost made it 4‚Äì1. Tyson took 2/45 and 0/20 as Australia followed on, needing 32 runs to make England bat again with only four wickets left. Tyson had taken 28 wickets in the series at 20.82 and was named one of the five Wisden Cricketers of the Year in 1956. Stokes McGown, a Botany Bay Sports Goods manufacturer made autographed cricket balls in his honour; ironically 'The Typhoon' ball was good for swinging, unlike its namesake.p205, Tyson =First Test vs New Zealand at Dunedin= After Australia England toured New Zealand, who had yet to win a Test match. Tyson took 3/23 and 4/16 in the First Test as New Zealand were dismissed for 125 and 132 and England won by 8 wickets despite making only 209/8 declared in their first innings. =Second Test vs New Zealand at Auckland= In this extraordinary Test Tyson took 2/41 in the New Zealand first innings of 200. When he joined Len Hutton on 164/7 the home side looked like getting a first innings lead and one gentleman even booked a flight to Auckland in the hope of seeing New Zealand's first Test victory.p328 The World of Cricket, Willow Press, 1986. Hutton told Tyson to \\"Stick around for a while Frank, we may not have to bat again\\", a prediction that Tyson later thought verged on second sight. He did hang round a bit and made 27 not out in England's 246. New Zealand spectacularly collapsed and were out for 26 to lose by an innings and 20 runs, the lowest completed score in Test cricket, Tyson taking 2/10 in the debacle. Later cricket career 1955‚Äì1959 See Main Articles English cricket team in Australia in 1958‚Äì59, 1958‚Äì59 Ashes series and Umpiring in the 1958‚Äì59 Ashes series Tyson returned to England a hero, but Northants refused to pay for a civic welcome, though the Supporters Club arranged a Welcome Home function at the Northampton Repertory Theatre. Northamptonshire was an unfancied county known for its \\"cabbage patch\\" home wickets which reduced the effectiveness of Tyson's bowling and would shorten his career. Management ignored his pleas for a faster wicket because of their spin bowlers George Tribe, Jack Manning and Micky Allen.pp255-256, Tyson Len Hutton advised him to move back to Lancashire to team up with Brian Statham, but county transfers were difficult in those days and Tyson stayed at Northants. In the Test arena he demonstrated the pace that had overpowered the Australians on a green wicket at Trent Bridge, taking 2/51 and 6/28 against South Africa as they fell to an innings defeat. In his first nine tests he had taken 52 wickets at 15.56, but this was effectively the end of his career as England's premier fast bowler. A badly blistered right heel forced him to miss the Second Test at Lord's and this injury would dog him for the remainder of his career. It was thought at the time that this was due to his violent pounding his foot received when he delivered the ball, but it was later found to be caused by the friction of his heel turning in ill-fitting boots. His place was taken by his Yorkshire rival Fred Trueman and Tyson's last eight Tests were played intermittently over a period of four years before he retired. He returned to play in the Third Test vs South Africa at Old Trafford taking 3/124 and 3/55, but missed the last two Tests. A series of injuries kept him out of the England team and he did not play until the Fifth Test against Australia at The Oval in 1956, when he took 1/34 in the first innings and did not bowl in the second. In South Africa in 1956‚Äì57 he barely bowled in the First Test at Johannesburg and was only recalled for the Fifth Test at Port Elizabeth, where he took 2/38 and 6/40 bowling off a five-yard run up.Duffus & Owen-Smith, pp 312‚Äì313. In 1957 he took his best first-class bowling; 8/60 against Surrey at the Kennington Oval with 5/52 in the second innings to return 13/112, his best match figures. Wisden reported '...nearly half the runs scored off him came from the edge'.Willis & Murphy, p. 167. Tyson toured Australia again in 1958‚Äì59, but the pitches were slower than four years before and the injury-struck Tyson only played in the Fourth and Fifth Tests, taking 3 wickets at 64.33. His last hurrah was in New Zealand, where he took 3‚Äì23 and 2‚Äì23 in the First Test at Christchurch and 1/50 in a rain affected draw in the Second Test at Auckland, taking a wicket with his last ball in Test cricket. He toured South Africa with the Commonwealth XI in 1959‚Äì60, taking 1/80 and 4/53 against Transvaal. Style > \\"His best pace was nothing short of startling to batsmen and spectators > alike. He represented an elemental force obscuring the details of his > technique and the highest tribute he received was the gasp of incredulity > frequently emitted by the crowd as the ball passed from his hand to the > distant wicket-keeper.\\" :J.M. Kilburn, Yorkshire Post In League, University and Army cricket Tyson had used a 'short' run up of 18 or 20 yards consisting of ten short steps and ten long final strides to the wicket.p117, Tyson When he moved to first-class cricket this increased to 38 yards, starting near the sightscreen and over 200 feet from the wicket-keeper, who was often reduced to an athletic long stop.Brown, p. 123. With a final leap to the wicket he released the ball with a high arm action and a heave of his shoulders, 'the ferocity of his delivery' was described as 'every muscle is in use, the right foot takes the strain, the right arm is straight ready for delivery and the left leg kicks out menacingly'.Lemmon, p. 41. Australian newspapers had accused Tyson of dragging his right foot over the popping crease on the 1954‚Äì55 tour and an English newspaper responded; \\"Will Tyson be \\"sacrificed\\" to avoid any risk of giving the Australians a chance to scream that Tyson persistently bowls no-balls by foot-drag over the crease?\\" with pictures of his bowling action.Tyson, p211 In the match between the Victoria and the M.C.C. he was photographed dragging his foot 18 inches past the crease, but Pat Crawford of New South Wales was photographed with his foot 36 inches over the crease. The caption reading \\"Oh Tyson. You are an Angel compared to Pat!\\"Tyson, p85 An enterprising Sydney newspaper paid Harold Larwood to give his name to an article declaring \\"Replay Tests ‚Äì Tyson Not Fair\\". Unlike the great swing bowler Fred Trueman he 'bowled straight and...never intentionally bowled an out-swinger.Trueman, p. 186. Instead Tyson relied on his tremendous pace to take most of his wickets, batsmen were often caught in mid-stroke by the speed of the ball coming onto the bat, or were too nervous to play fluently.Tyson On a green or crumbling wicket providing movement he could simply blast his way through the batting, and produced bounce and pace even off the placid Northamptonshire wickets. Tyson believed that a bouncer should 'pin the batsman against the sightscreen' and frequently used them to intimidate batsmen, even tailenders. His ungainly action and quest for raw speed took a toll on even his strong body and he suffered from a series of injuries which brought a premature end to his career. In 1994 he had operations to his right arm and knees and a further operation on his knees in 2001 rendered him practically immobile for a short time.http://content.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/86029.html. As he put it himself \\"to bowl fast is to revel in the glad animal action, to thrill in physical power and to enjoy a sneaking feeling of superiority over the mortals who play the game\\". However, he was no simple bowler, but thought hard how to dismiss and deceive batsman. John Arlott wrote \\"This was intelligence, rhythm and strength merged into the violent craft of fast bowling\\" and \\"He is intelligent beyond the usual run of fast bowlers: he is the type of cricketer whom improves rapidly through thinking about the game\\".p65-66, Batty Typhoon Tyson > \\"Frank Tyson, at his peak, was possibly the fastest bowler of all time. In > 1954‚Äì55, England convincingly beat Australia by three Tests to one, mainly > thanks to devastating bowling that earned Tyson the nickname 'Typhoon'. > Roaring off a long run, he generated tremendous pace that unnerved and > unhinged even the greatest batsmen.\\"p59, Tom Graveney with Norman Giller, > The Ten Greatest Test Teams, Sidgwick & Jackson, 1988. :Tom Graveney His fast bowling gave him the nickname \\"Typhoon Tyson\\", and despite his short career he achieved status as the fastest England bowler in living memory. Don Bradman called him \\"the fastest bowler I have ever seen\\" and Richie Benaud agreed, writing \\"For a short time, Frank Tyson blasted all-comers\\". Tom Graveney wrote 'I cannot believe any bowler was faster than Tyson at that time'. When fielding in the slips he had 'to stand 40 yards off the bat, and still. the ball was often going over our heads from edged shots'.p 125, Tom Graveney with Norman Giller, The Ten Greatest Test Teams, Sidgwick & Jackson, 1988, His Northants colleague Jock Livingston said 'When really firing, Tyson was the quickest of all over a period of three or four overs'.Willis & Murphy, p. 89. Livingston had seen Harold Larwood bowl Bodyline and batted against the Australian fast bowlers Miller and Lindwall in the Sheffield Shield. At the Aeronautical College in Wellington, New Zealand in 1955 metal plates were attached to a cricket ball and a sonic device was used to measure their speed, with Tyson's bowling measured at , but he was wearing three sweaters on a cold, damp morning and used no run up, Brian Statham bowled at . He certainly bowled faster than 89 mph in matches, and Tyson claimed that he could bowl at , but this cannot be proven.. The best that can be said was that he was noticeably faster than his contemporaries Ray Lindwall, Keith Miller, Fred Trueman, Brian Statham, Peter Heine and Neil Adcock. His great fast bowling rival Fred Trueman 'was forever being told that when it came to bowling I was very fast, but on his day Frank Tyson was faster than me'Trueman, p. 288. and it was Tyson who kept Trueman out of the England team in 1954‚Äì55. When they played together in a Gentlemen v Players match at Scarborough in 1957 the captain Godfrey Evans insisted Trueman bowl into the headwind so as to give the faster Tyson the advantage of the tailwind.Trueman pp 206‚Äì207. Dickie Bird, the famous England umpire, wrote \\"he was certainly the quickest bowler I ever seen through the air, and on one occasion the quickest bowler I never saw through the air\\".p184 Dickie Bird, White Cap and Bails, Hodder and Sloughton, 1999. When playing for Yorkshire vs the MCC at Scarborough in 1958 \\"I opened the innings against him and hit his first three deliveries through the off side for four. With supreme confidence I went on to the front foot for the fourth ball. Tyson dropped one short. It reared up and hit me on the chin. I went down as if I'd just been on the receiving end of a right hook...I still carry the scar to show my folly that day. There was blood all over and I saw stars. I could hear bells ringing in my head...\\".Bird, p. 29-30. Dickie came back to score his then-highest first-class score of 62 and Tyson took 4/30. When they met in Australia in 1998‚Äì99 Tyson joked 'You're looking well Dickie. See you still have the scars though'. Later career Frank Tyson met his wife Ursula Miels (born in 1936) in Melbourne on the 1954‚Äì55 tour, and they married in a Melbourne church on 22 November 1957 with much publicity. They had three children, Philip (a non-Typhoon medium-paced bowler), Sara and Anna, and eight grandchildren.. He retired from first-class cricket in 1960 and emigrated to Australia as a ten-pound pom, as his hero Harold Larwood had done ten years earlier. \\"It had struck me while I was over there that it was a wonderful country to bring up a family, with the open spaces, the climate and the job opportunities\\".http://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/sport/Tyson-fears- imaginative-Australians-hold.1088055.jp. He became a schoolmaster at Carey Baptist Grammar School in Melbourne, teaching English, French and History, later becoming a housemaster and the head of languages. Tyson worked as a cricket coach in Melbourne and was the captain-coach of University of Melbourne Cricket Club.http://www.mucc.info/history.html He also played for Todmorden Cricket Club in the Lancashire League in 1961, the Prime Ministers XI in 1963‚Äì64, International Cavaliers in 1968, Old England vs Old Australia in 1980 and Footscray Cricket Club. He was recruited as the Director of Coaching for the Victorian Cricket Association, taking them to two Sheffield Shield victories, and helped establish the Australian National Accreditation Scheme in 1974. From 1990 to 2008 he travelled to India to teach the coaches at the National Cricket Academyhttp://www.rediff.com/cricket/2003/may/21tyson.htm?zcc=ar. and Mumbai Cricket Association and coached the Sri Lankan national cricket team for the World Cup. On the 1954‚Äì55 tour he had written columns for the Empire News and Manchester Evening News, and when he retired he wrote for the London Observer, the Daily Telegraph and the Melbourne Age, and contributed to The Cricketer International magazine. He was also a cricket commentator on ABC radio for 26 years, and for Channel Nine from 1979 to 1986, forming a partnership with Tony Greig. Following his full retirement, Tyson enjoyed his house on the Gold Coast, where he could \\"wake up every day in the sun\\". He went to the gym three times a week, enjoyed swimming, and spent his time making oil paintings of cricketers and cricket grounds.

Lorenzo Ricci, S.J. Lorenzo Ricci, S.J. (August 2, 1703Van Ortroy, Francis. \\"Lorenzo Ricci.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 13. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1912. 30 May 2018November 24, 1775) was an Italian Jesuit, elected the eighteenth Superior General of the Society of Jesus. He was also the last before the suppression of the Jesuits in 1773. Early life and career Ricci was born in Florence, Italy, into one of the most ancient, and illustrious families of Tuscany. When very young, he was sent to Prato to the Jesuits Cicognini College. He entered the Society when he was scarcely fifteen, on 16 December 1718, at the novitiate of S. Andrea at Rome. Having completed his studies in philosophy (1722‚Äì25) and theology (1729‚Äì34) at the Roman College of Rome, he taught at Siena and Rome. He was formally professed in August 1736. From 1751 to 1755 he was spiritual Director at the Roman College.Syre SJ, Otto. \\"November 24th 1775 ‚Äì Ricci Lorenzo\\", Jesuiten, October 2, 2014 In fact this quiet and unassuming spiritual work ‚Äì in particular giving the Spiritual Exercises of Ignatius of Loyola (a form of guided retreat) ‚Äì seemed to have had his preference. In 1755, he was chosen secretary of the society. Superior General At the 19th General Congregation, in May 1758, Ricci was elected Superior General of the Society of Jesus at the second ballot. Guilio Cordara, who lived near Ricci and seems to have known him intimately, deplored this choice: \\"On account of his placid nature and too even temper, I regarded him as little suited for a time when disturbance and storm seem to require extraordinary application of unusual remedies to unusual evils\\". Cordara, Julius. \\"Denkwurdigkeiten der Jesuiten\\", Beitr√§ge zur politischen, kirchlichen und Culturgesch, III (Ignaz von D√∂llinger, ed.), 1882, p. 19 Ricci himself asked to be relieved of the responsibility.\\"The Jesuit Ordeal IV: Lorenzo Ricci, the Last General\\", John J. Burns Library, Boston College =Jesuits in Portugal= The crisis with the Catholic Bourbon royal courts was coming to a head. Four months after Ricci's election, an attempt was made on the life of King Joseph I of Portugal. Prime Minister Carvalho, jealous of Gabriel Malagrida's influence at court, charged the Jesuit with involvement in the plot. Malagrida was declared guilty of high treason, but, as a priest, could not be executed without the consent of the Inquisition, so he was executed for heresy instead. The Jesuits were expelled from Portugal in September 1759. The decree also included the Portuguese possessions of Brazil, Goa, and Macao.Neave, Barbara (Comtesse de Courson). The Jesuits: Their Foundation and History, Vol. 1, Benziger Brothers, 1879 =Jesuits in France= The Jesuits in France had earned the enmity of the influential Madame de Pompadour. According to the Comtesse de Courson, in 1752 Pompadour had approached the Jesuits requesting to be openly admitted the sacraments, in hopes of strengthening her position and influence to the detriment of the Queen and the Dauphin. Suspecting her motives were less than spiritual, the priests demurred until such time as she should cease to be the King's mistress. Within a few years she became one of the most ardent promoters of the destruction of the Society; the reason for her hostility suspected by many. Antoine de La Valette was the thirty-four-year-old Superior of the missions in Martinique, which were heavily in debt. Lavallette borrowed heavily, became over-extended, and went bankrupt when the British seized twelve of thirteen ships carrying produce from the plantations for sale in France. The Society's efforts to intervene with LaValette in Martinique were hampered by the Seven Years' War. The war had left France almost bankrupt, and the Duke de Choiseul, minister for foreign affairs and secretary of war, saw in the Jesuit assets an opportunity to rebuild crown revenue. The French Jesuits were making an effort to settle with the creditors, but when the case was brought before the courts, the whole Society was held responsible for the debt, and a decree was issued for the seizure of all their property. This rendered the Society in France bankrupt. An anonymous French author published a pamphlet supposedly of letters between Ricci and Corsican insurgents. The Society was expelled from France in 1764, from Spain and Naples in 1767, and from the Duchy of Parma in 1768. The helpless Ricci saw it all. As long as Clement XIII was pope, the Society was somehow protected in Rome. The Pope gave a new public approval of the Society (the bull Apostolicum pascendi, of 1769). The Pope advised courage, prayer and patience to Ricci who was inexperienced in the art of governing and who had always lived apart from the world and diplomatic intrigues. The spiritually inclined Superior General sent circular letters to the Jesuits on Fervent perseverance in Prayer (1763), On greater fervour in prayer in 1769, and just a few months before the suppression of the Society another one on a New Incentive to Prayer (February 1773). Clearly he was not in touch with what was going on. But pressure on the Holy See was increasing and at the conclave called (in 1769) to elect a successor to Clement XIII the suppression of the Jesuits was the main issue. Clement XIV was elected; it is not clear whether he made a promise to have the Society suppressed. After his election Clement XIV took harsh and humiliating decisions against the Society in order to placate its enemies, but political pressure went on unrelentingly and the Pope finally suppressed the order (Dominus ac Redemptor of 21 July 1773), the main reason being that he wanted to 'restore peace in the Church'. Death Jesuit communities were disbanded, libraries confiscated, and properties looted. Under pressure from Spanish ambassador Jos√© Mo√±ino, 1st Count of Floridablanca, Ricci was put behind bars at the Castel Sant'Angelo, Rome, where he suffered further humiliation and ill treatment (for example, he was not allowed to celebrate the mass). The charges leveled publicly against the Jesuits were never brought in a court of law: no process of justice was gone through. Before he died Ricci solemnly declared before witnesses: \\"I say and protest that the Society of Jesus did not give any ground warranting its suppression; nor is there any right reason why I should have been put in jail.\\"Byron SJ, Tim et al. \\"Jan 15 1776 ‚Äì Jesuit prisoners released from Castel Sant‚ÄôAngelo\\", Jesuit Restoration - 1814, January 14, 2014 He is buried in the crypt of the Ges√π Church in Rome. About six weeks after Ricci's death, Pope Pius VI ordered the release of Ricci's five assistants.

Founded in 1955 by Dr. Eugenie Clark in Placida, Florida, it was known as the Cape Haze Marine Laboratory until 1967. The laboratory aims to advance marine science and education, supporting conservation and sustainable use of marine resources. A public aquarium and associated education program interpret its research for the public. History The laboratory, founded by Dr. Eugenie Clark in 1955 in Placida, Florida, was known as Cape Haze Marine Laboratory until its 1967 renaming in honor of major benefactors of the laboratory William R. Mote, his wife Lenore, and his sister, Betty Mote Rose. Early research was focused on sharks and other fishes. Since 1960, it has been based in Sarasota, Florida, and has been located on City Island since 1978. The laboratory celebrated its 55th anniversary during 2010, and was recognized for its marine science with a resolution in the Florida House and Senate during March 2010. During March 2010 Eugenie Clark was inducted into the Florida Women's Hall of Fame. When the laboratory celebrated its 60th anniversary in 2015, it unveiled its first multi-year, comprehensive fundraising effort, Oceans of Opportunity: the Campaign for Mote Marine Laboratory. Clark was still working as senior scientist, director emerita, and trustee at the laboratory when she died in February 2015. As of 2017, the laboratory employed more than 200 staff members, including Ph.D. scientists conducting research through more than 20 research programs on coral health and disease, chemical and physical ecology, phytoplankton ecology, ocean acidification, marine and fresh water aquaculture, fisheries habitat ecology, stranding investigations, ecotoxicology, sharks and rays conservation research, fisheries ecology and enhancement, coral reef monitoring and assessment, coral reef restoration, environmental health, ocean technology, marine immunology, benthic ecology, marine biomedical research, environmental forensics, sea turtle conservation and research, manatee research, and dolphin research. http://www.sarasotadolphin.orgMote Marine Laboratory 2020 Vision&Strategic; Plan: Version 2.0 In partnership of the Chicago Zoological Society https://www.czs.org the laboratory conducts the world's longest- running study of a wild dolphin population. Since 1978, the laboratory has expanded to include a campus in Sarasota, the Elizabeth Moore International Center for Coral Reef Research and Restoration on Summerland Key, a public exhibit in Key West, a Boca Grande outreach office, and the Mote Aquaculture Research Park in eastern Sarasota County. In addition to staff members, the laboratory has about 1,400 volunteers who contribute more than 200,000 volunteer hours to the organization. Mote Aquarium Coral display at Mote Marine Laboratory The aquarium is the public outreach arm of the laboratory, displaying more than 100 marine species with a focus on species and ecosystems studied by staff scientists. The aquarium is accredited by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums, which accredits qualified facilities based on a rigorous application and inspection process focusing on animal care, conservation, and science, facilities and more. The aquarium opened in 1980 on City Island in Sarasota Bay to display sharks, manatees, sea turtles, seahorses, rays, skates, and invertebrates including cuttlefish, octopuses, sea jellies, anemones, and corals. Special exhibits have included \\"Otters and Their Waters\\" and \\"The Teeth Beneath: The Wild World of Gators, Crocs, and Caimans\\" that features animals found in the watershed (land that drains into the ocean and other waterbodies), including North American river otters, American alligators, and spectacled caimans. A special exhibit \\"Oh Baby! Life Cycles of the Seas\\" deals with marine courtship and reproduction and features the offspring of multiple species and their early-life survival challenges through an interactive game, a baby shark touch tank, and other features.https://mote.org/news/article/new-mote-exhibit-oh-baby-to-explore- ocean-animal-romance-babies-families The aquarium includes windows into working laboratories and interactive exhibits designed to make science accessible for all ages. The aquarium presents shark feedings, in which large sharks are trained to go to specific targets for a food reward. Other resident animals, such as sea turtles and river otters, are fed and trained similarly during sessions designed to enhance their care and provide healthy stimulation. All narrated training and feeding sessions are designed specifically for animal care, and in some cases, to allow behavioral research intended to inform conservation of wild populations. Until 2011, Harley, the last recorded spinner dolphin in captivity lived at Mote Aquarium. Education The education, aquarium, and outreach division of the laboratory includes a marine science school and public programs for all ages. The laboratory also offers internships, summer camps, school visits, field trips, on-demand learning experiences, an annual special lecture series featuring staff scientists and other marine experts, and a digital-learning program called SeaTrek.TV, which connects staff educators to students and other audiences via live videoconferencing, often using common computer programs and service, making scientific lessons accessible to classrooms across the U.S. and abroad. The laboratory also provides enhanced adult learning programs such as professional development workshops for teachers, and multiple aquarium tanks are maintained at other southwest Florida facilities, including at the Sarasota‚ÄìBradenton International Airport.  Library  A library has existed at the laboratory since its beginning in Cape Haze. For more than 35 years The Arthur Vining Davis Library and Archives has been providing resources, reference materials, and research publications at the laboratory. Its collections are maintained for the support of marine and environmental research and education. In addition to print and archival collections, the library maintains searchable online, open-access institutional repositories of staff publications, institutional papers, and items from historical collections. The library and archives are open to the public for study and exploration, however, appointments may be required. The library is a member of the International Association of Aquatic and Marine Science Libraries and Information Centers (IAMSLIC), an association of individuals and organizations interested in library and information science, especially as these are applied to the recording, retrieval, and dissemination of knowledge and information in all aspects of aquatic and marine sciences and their allied disciplines. Commercial programs From 2006 to 2014, the laboratory produced \\"Mote caviar\\" (Siberian malossol osetra) from Siberian sturgeon at Mote Aquaculture Research Park in eastern Sarasota County as part of a demonstration of sustainable eco-sensitive aquaculture.October 2012 Florida Trend pages 14,16 On November 24, 2014, the caviar production operation was sold to Southeast Venture Holdings, LLC (Seven Holdings).https://mote.org/news/article/mote- marine-laboratory-and-southeast-venture-holdings-announce-spin-off Meanwhile, the laboratory continued to own the entire 200-acre research park and continued its sustainable aquaculture and aquaponics research, emphasizing a range of goals from eco-friendly food production to restocking wild fish populations. In early 2017, Seven Holdings concluded the sturgeon program, for financial reasons. Staff at the park continue research programs investigating marine aquaponics (growing fish and salt-tolerant \\"sea vegetables\\" in prototype greenhouses), examining the potential for aquaculture production of the Gulf of Mexico stock of almaco jack, examining the effects of probiotic supplements on survival of larval fish, and other projects designed to inform and contribute to the growth of sustainable, commercial aquaculture.

Mikhail Illarionovich Artamonov (; in the village of Vygolovo, Tver Governorate, now Molokovsky District, Tver Oblast - July 31, 1972 in Leningrad Biography ) was a Soviet historian and archaeologist, who came to be recognized as the founding father of modern Khazar studies.  Biography  Artamonov was born into a peasant family in Tver Governorate. He moved to Saint Petersburg when he was nine years old to pursue secondary education, including studying painting under Kuzma Petrov-Vodkin and art history under Nikolai Sychov, as well as archaeology. He was an active participant in the Russian Revolution. Artamonov's scholarly career was centered on Leningrad University, where he taught from 1928, was a professor from 1935 and the head of the department of archaeology from 1949.Great Soviet Encyclopedia, 3rd edition, entry on \\"–ê—Ä—Ç–∞–º–æ–Ω–æ–≤\\", available online here He researched Bronze Age and Iron Age settlements by the Don River, in the North Caucasus and in the Ukraine. He excavated a great number of Scythian and Khazar kurgans and settlements (most famously, the Khazar fortress of Sarkel, which he discovered during the first excavation he arranged in 1929), and published a hefty monograph (Istoriya Khazar) on the Khazars in 1962. Early editions of this work (1937, 1939), which emphasized the enormous influence of the Khazars on the development of the early Rus' and other peoples, were denounced by Soviet authorities, compelling him to add a conclusion to his work stating essentially that they had in fact had no lasting influence. In 1939, he was appointed Director of the Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union's Institute of the History of Material Culture in accordance with the wishes of the Institute's staff, after they rebelled against Artamonov's predecessor, Joseph Orbeli, who had sacked many of its leading members - an about-face by the authorities which was unprecedented during Stalin's rule. Under his leadership the Institute launched a number of periodicals, including Sovetskaya arkheologiya, Brief Reports of the IHMC and Materials and Research on the Archaeology of the USSR, and also established a branch in Moscow. Artamonov was appointed director of the Hermitage Museum in 1951. Thirteen years later, he was ousted from office due to resisting interference from Communist Party officials in his running of the Museum, especially regarding his refusal to remove paintings by the French Impressionists - described by the government as \\"bourgeois decadents\\" - from display. Artamonov was awarded the Order of Lenin, the Order of the Red Banner of Labour and various medals. His many disciples include Lev Gumilyov, Anatoly Kirpichnikov, Dmitry Machinsky, and Igor Dubov. Among the students he trained were Svetlana Pletnyova and Leo Klejn. He died in 1972, whilst at his desk editing a scientific article.

Career Humberto Ramos began his career in 1989 at Kaboom C√≥mics. He was later hired by DC Comics as the regular penciller for their Flash spin- off Impulse, which launched in March 1995.\\"WonderCon 2012 Special Guests\\" . WonderCon. Retrieved June 2, 2012. Written by Mark Waid, the superhero/teen comedy series focused on young speedster Bart Allen, the grandson of the second Flash, Barry Allen, and his struggles with growing up in an alienated Alabama suburb. In 1998, Ramos co-founded the imprint Cliffhanger with comic book artists Joe Madureira and J. Scott Campbell. They created the imprint, housed by Jim Lee's Image Comics division Wildstorm, to publish their creator- owned comic books outside the mainstream superhero genre. Both Campbell and Madureira had already built large fanbases with their previous work on Gen¬π¬≥ and Uncanny X-Men respectively, and were two of the most popular comic book artists at the time. Ramos, on the other hand, was not as popular and his inclusion on the imprint was perceived as second choice, after fan-favorite Michael Turner declined because he was still under contract at Top Cow. Ramos' first Cliffhanger title Crimson ran for 24 issues and two one-shots, with poor success. It was followed by the fantasy/mystery series Out There, months later. Ramos also began illustrating the covers of Peter Parker: Spider-Man with issue #30 and--beginning with May 2002's Peter Parker: Spider-Man #44-- additionally did the interior artwork on the four-issue story arc \\"A Death in the Family\\" (later collected as Spider-Man: Return of the Goblin; ), written by Paul Jenkins. Ramos at Super-Con 2009 in San Jose, California After his Cliffhanger contract expired, and Out There concluded after 18 issues in early 2003, Ramos left the imprint, apparently not on the best terms, and launched a new Spider-Man title, The Spectacular Spider-Man. The book reunited Ramos with Peter Parker: Spider-Man writer Paul Jenkins and earned him a 2005 Harvey Award nomination as Best Cover Artist. While Ramos worked on Spectacular Spider-Man, another book created by him (although illustrated by Francisco Herrera), the six-issue miniseries Kamikaze, which had originally been planned for 2001, was published by WildStorm under the Cliffhanger imprint. In 2005, Ramos' creator-owned six-issue miniseries Revelations began publication by Dark Horse Comics. Following Revelations, Ramos returned to Marvel Comics, joining writer Marc Guggenheim as the new creative team on Wolverine, beginning with issue #42 in March 2006. The same month also saw the release of the first volume of the space opera Kookaburra K, a series of three 46-page comic albums Ramos illustrated for French comic publisher Soleil Productions, written by French comic book creator Crisse. Ramos worked with writer Terry Moore on Runaways from 2008-2009, and became one of the regular artists on The Amazing Spider-Man in 2010.

He lost his job and was subjected to a campaign of persecution and intimidation after he expressed concern to his managers in the US Department of Defense over testimony to congress that he believed to be false about Pakistan's nuclear weapon program during the presidency of George H. W. Bush. Since then, he has had occasional contract work for various federal agencies including the CIA, the State Department, the FBI and Sandia National Laboratories. In 2013 he had been unemployed since 2004 when his job at Sandia had been eliminated. \\"If they had busted those [Pakistani] networks,\\" he told journalist Jeff Stein, \\"Iran would have no nuclear program, North Korea wouldn't have a uranium bomb, and Pakistan wouldn't have over a hundred nuclear weapons they are driving around in vans to hide from us.\\".Similar comments about nuclear proliferation have been made by proliferation expert Robert Gallucci, as reported, e.g., by .  College and early career  In 1980 Barlow wrote a political science honors thesis as a senior at Western Washington University in Bellngham discussing US failures in attempting to stop Pakistan from acquiring nuclear weapons. After a stint with the State Department's Arms Control and Disarmament Agency (ACDA), he got a job in 1985 with the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). At the CIA he collated and examined information about nuclear programs in the Third World and contributed to the National Intelligence Estimates. Barlow's early work included an effort to sound the alarm about procurement activities in the US directed by Abdul Qadeer Khan, who had ‚Äúacquired‚Äù nuclear blueprints from a Dutch employer in 1975 and used those to get a job as head of Pakistan's nuclear program. The CIA had known about Khan's activities from the beginning. Barlow reportedly discovered that Pakistan's nuclear program depended upon clandestine and illegal procurement activity within the US. In mid-1986 Barlow became the CIA's delegate to the Nuclear Export Violations Working Group (N.E.V.W.G.), a newly formed top- secret panel that brought together the policy, law-enforcement, and intelligence communities in an effort to stop illegal American exports to non- nuclear nations. After a few failed sting operations, Barlow became convinced that the officials in the State Department were warning targets of sealed arrest warrants in FBI operations and illegally approving export licenses for restricted goods. Barlow and others in the working group stopped sharing their plans with the State Department. In July 1987, the FBI arrested Arshad Z. Pervez, a Pakistani-born Canadian, as he attempted to buy twenty-five tons of a specially strengthened steel, for which the primary use would be a uranium enrichment program, according to Barlow. This arrest was highly publicized and attracted the attention of the Asian and Pacific Affairs Subcommittee, chaired by Representative Solarz. Retired Army Major General David W. Einsel, then working for the CIA, and Barlow were asked to testify before that committee in a classified briefing. Einsel gave evasive answers when asked if Pakistan had attempted to purchase anything that would have been a violation of the Solarz amendment, either directly or via a third party in a different country. Solarz then asked essentially the same question of Barlow, who replied that the CIA knew of ‚Äúscores‚Äù of Pakistani attempts to violate American export law. Barlow said that after that testimony, he was so harassed by Einsel and other senior CIA personnel that he resigned in 1988, though not before receiving the CIA's Exceptional Accomplishment Award. In 1989 he was hired as a proliferation analyst for the Department of Defense. He was in a chain of command below Stephen J. Hadley, then Assistant Secretary of Defense for Global Strategic Affairs, who reported to the Under-Secretary of Defense for Policy when Dick Cheney was the Secretary of Defense. During the debate over the sale of F-16s to Pakistan in 1989, the U.S. administration was constrained by the 1985 Pressler amendment of the Foreign Assistance Act which prohibited the sale of any mat√©riel or armaments which might assist in the development or delivery of nuclear weapons. Barlow's analysis of Pakistan's nuclear program indicated that Pakistan possessed the capability to use the fighters to drop nuclear bombs, and the report which he submitted to Dick Cheney concluded that the F-16 sale indisputably violated the NPT and the Solarz and Pressler Amendments. He drew on details available to the intelligence community about how Pakistan had used the F-16s it already possessed. He then learned that Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Arthur Hughes had given testimony before Congress that stated the exact opposite, including that using F-16s to deliver nuclear weapons \\"far exceeded the state of art in Pakistan.\\" Barlow knew this was not true. He checked the files and found that his reports had been ‚Äúmysteriously substituted or altered‚Äù and \\"willfully falsified by officials at the Office of the Secretary of Defense\\", including then-Undersecretary of Defense for Policy Paul Wolfowitz and then-Deputy Undersecretary of Defense Scooter Libby. Barlow then told his superiors that congress had been misled and urged that the record be corrected. Within days, Barlow was fired. Events following dismissal Barlow is not a whistleblower in the traditional sense. He was persecuted for saying things in a classified briefing to a committee of the US Congress that his management did not want shared with Congress. Later he was fired for asking his managers to correct the record when blatantly false statements had been made to Congress. Barlow brought a legal action for wrongful dismissal that received considerable attention, including from the United States Congress. In this he was defended by Paul Wolfowitz, who said \\"there have been times on that issue when I specifically sensed that people thought we could somehow construct a policy on a house of cards that the Congress wouldn't know what the Pakistanis were doing\\". He concluded that the retaliation Barlow had faced was \\"wrong\\". Following congressionally ordered investigations, the inspector general at the State Department concluded that Barlow had been fired as a reprisal. However, the inspectors general at the CIA and the Defense Department stated that the Pentagon was within its rights to fire Barlow. A final investigation by Congress' own Government Accountability Office was completed in 1997 and \\"largely vindicated\\" Barlow, who had his security clearance restored. During the investigation, the State department inspector-general, Sherman Funk, described Barlow as \\"one of the most brilliant analysts I've ever seen\\". His security clearances were restored, but he was unable to get rehired permanently by the government, presumably because of the cloud over his record. He subsequently found occasional jobs as a contractor for federal agencies including the CIA, the State Department, the FBI and Sandia National Laboratories. However, in 2013 he had been unemployed since his last job at Sandia had been eliminated in 2004, and he was living in a motor home.. The activities of the Defense Department officials, however, including Cheney, Libby, Wolfowitz and Hadley, were never investigated. Rep. Stephen Solarz, a major player in counter-proliferation, told Seymour Hersh for the latter's famous expos√© of the Pakistani nuclear program that \\"If what Barlow says is true, this would have been a major scandal of Iran-Contra proportions, and the officials involved would have had to resign. We‚Äôre not dealing with minor matters. Stopping the spread of nuclear weapons is one of the major foreign- policy issues of the nation‚Äînot to mention the law of the land.‚Äù Barlow, however, was unable to find employment after his clearance was removed and marriage broke up. \\"They viciously tried to destroy my life, personally and professionally\\" he is quoted as saying. \\"Not just my career, but they went after my marriage, my livelihood, and smeared my name in truly extraordinary ways that no one had ever seen before or since‚Äîat least not until the Wilsons were victims of the same people years later.\\" According to Barlow the allegations included the \\"fabrication\\" that he \\"was an 'intended' Congressional spy\\", that he was an alcoholic, had not paid his taxes, and was an adulterer. \\"Then they accused me of being psychotic and used that to invade my marital privacy, including that of my now ex-wife who also worked at the CIA, and sought to destroy my marriage as punishment.\\" Although he was found to have breached no national security regulations and was vindicated, Barlow did not receive his government pension and has had trouble finding employment. The authors of The Nuclear Jihadist, a biography of A.Q. Khan, caused a sensation in 2005 when they revealed that they had tracked him down to a motor home in Bozeman, Montana where he lived with two dogs.  Wider implications  Pakistan has been the center of the world's largest atomic black market, according to nuclear-proliferation expert Robert Gallucci, who served in several high ranking positions in the administrations of George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton. Pakistan could not have entered that market without the violations of US law that Barlow tried to expose. \\"They were worried someone like Rich [Barlow], in his stickler approach, would insist that if there's going to be testimony on the Hill about the F-16 aircraft, that the answers be full and truthful. He was a thorn in their side, and they went after him. And they did a very good job of screwing up his life.\\" Gallucci's comments were supported by similar remarks from Danielle Brian, executive director of the Project on Government Oversight.For similar remarks by Barlow, see . In 2007 a spokeswoman for Senator Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), a known champion of whistle-blowers, said the Senator is contacted each week by four new whistle- blowers looking for help. It's possible that all these whistle-blowers are wrong. It's also possible that the structure of the US political economy effectively forces incumbent public servants to routinely violate US and international law in pursuit of short-term objectives and persecute people like Barlow, who try to expose what they feel compelled to do.

He was born in London, a son of Henry Williams Chisholm (1809‚Äì1901), Warden of the Standards at the Board of Trade. Hugh Chisholm was educated at Felsted School and Christ Church, Oxford. He graduated from the latter in 1888 with a first class in Literae Humaniores. He read for the Bar and was called to the Middle Temple in 1892. Chisholm worked for The St James's Gazette as assistant editor from 1892 and was appointed editor in 1897. During these years, he also contributed numerous articles on political, financial and literary subjects to the weekly journals and monthly reviews, becoming well known as a literary critic and conservative publicist. He moved in 1899 to The Standard as chief leader-writer and moved in 1900 to The Times, to act as co-editor with Sir Donald Mackenzie Wallace and President Arthur Twining Hadley of Yale University on preparation of the eleven volumes forming the 10th edition of the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. In 1903, he became editor-in- chief for the 11th edition, which was completed under his direction in 1910, and published as a whole by the Cambridge University Press, in 29 volumes, in 1911. He subsequently planned and edited the Britannica Year-Book (1913). Chisholm had been suggested as replacement as editor of The Times as an alternative to Dawson, and in 1913, following his return from America overseeing the printing of The Britannica Year-Book, he was appointed day editor. In August 1913 he was appointed a director of the company. He was financial editor throughout World War I, resigning in 1920 when he embarked on the editorship of the three volumes forming the 12th edition of Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, published in 1922.

Kelley, Deputy Director; Edward Durell Stone, and Dr. Winston E. Kock, Director The Electronics Research Center (ERC), was a NASA research facility located in Cambridge, Massachusetts, across the street from MIT at Kendall Square. The ERC opened in September 1964, taking over the administration of contracts, grants, and other NASA business in New England from the antecedent North Eastern Operations Office (created in July 1962), and closed in June 1970. The campus is now the site of the United States Department of Transportation's John A. Volpe National Transportation Systems Center. Mission It served to develop the space agency's in-house expertise in electronics during the Apollo era. A second key function was to serve as a graduate and post-graduate training center within the framework of a regional government-industry-university alliance. The ERC was just as important a NASA field center as the Langley Research Center or the Marshall Space Flight Center. By fiscal 1968, NASA planned for the ERC to be employing 1,600 professional and technical workers plus another 500 in administrative and support positions (Kelley, n.p.). History The John A. Volpe National Transportation Systems Center, originally the Electronics Research Center, in 2011 The Center was located in Cambridge after Massachusetts politicians unsuccessfully lobbied for the Manned Spacecraft Center. The center started its operations in Technology Square on Main Street while its campus was being built on Broadway. The location of the ERC allowed it to take advantage of the proximity to MIT and (to a lesser extent) Harvard University, MIT Lincoln Laboratory, the Air Force Cambridge Research Laboratories, and the electronics industry located along Route 128. At the time, the technical, industrial, and commercial aspects of microelectronics were ascendant, especially in the Boston-Cambridge technopolis. =Nature of research= Research at the ERC was conducted in ten different laboratories: space guidance, systems, computers, instrumentation research, space optics, power conditioning and distribution, microwave radiation, electronics components, qualifications and standards, and control and information systems. Researchers investigated such areas as microwave and laser communications; the miniaturization and radiation resistance of electronic components; guidance and control systems; photovoltaic energy conversion; information display devices; instrumentation; and computers and data processing. Although no publication to date has investigated the nature of the research or professional training conducted at the ERC, an internal NASA publication lists a few accomplishments identified with the center in passing: *a high-frequency (30 GHz) oscillator *a miniaturized tunnel-diode transducer *a transistor more tolerant of space radiation \\"One particularly interesting development,\\" the source added, \\"has been in the area of holography. At the Electronics Research Center, holography has been used for data storage, and has permitted a remarkable degree of data compression in the storing of star patterns\\" ( Preliminary History, 1:V-11, 1:V-34 & 1:V-35). A book on holography written by one of the ERC's directors, Dr. Winston Kock, indicates some of the facility's contributions, such as Lowell Rosen's improvement of so-called focused-image holography (Kock, 80-82). Controversy and funding The Electronics Research Center was at the heart of political controversy from the start. The conception, siting, and shutting down of the ERC is an engaging political tale. President John F. Kennedy and NASA administrator James Webb kept the project out of the budget process until after Ted Kennedy's successful first election to the Senate. His campaign slogan had promised that he could \\"do more for Massachusetts.\\" After the President belatedly put the ERC project in the budget process, Congress rebelled. In addition to Republican members, Representatives from the Midwest and other regions feeling swindled out of the NASA largesse repeatedly fought efforts to fund the ERC. The issue split the Congress along both party and regional lines.Murphy, Thomas. Science, Geopolitics, and Federal Spending. Lexington, MA: Lexington Books, 1971. As a result, the ERC had the most deliberated and defended existence and siting of any NASA Center. Although the only Center ever closed, the ERC actually grew while NASA eliminated major programs and cut staff. Between 1967 and 1970, NASA cut permanent civil service workers at all Centers with one exception, the ERC, whose personnel grew annually. Hardest hit by the cuts had been the Marshall Space Flight Center, whose future was then the subject of agency debate (Levine, 134-135). NASA Administrator James Webb, more than any other individual, shaped the ERC. Webb saw it as fulfilling a broader mission as part of the nation's Cold War struggle on the economic and intellectual battleground of the Space Race. The ERC was an archetype for Webb's regional \\"university-industry-government complex\\" analogous to the military-industrial complex, organized because Webb believed that no single institution had the requisite resources to fight this war. The ERC's training of critically needed engineers and scientists served the same Cold War aim (McDougall, 376 & 381). The ERC has received hardly any attention as a subject of scholarly or lay studies. No single work, neither book nor article, has been devoted to the ERC itself. The few works that consider the ERC other than in passing focus on the turbulent political circumstances surrounding its creation (Murphy, 225-264; Hechler, 219-231). A thesis written for the MIT Sloan School of Management is the only work that deals solely with the facility's closing (Rollins).Rollins, Robert H., II. \\"Closing of the NASA Electronics Research Center: A Studyof the Reallocation of Space Program Talent.\\" M.S.

Its name literally means \\"North Ward\\". It stretches roughly from the Ring Road to Mohwa into the north and out to the coast in the east. Demographics 149,676 people live in Ulsan Buk Gu's 80.41 km2. 77,214 of these are Korean males, 71,183 are Korean females, 961 are foreign males and 318 are foreign females (2006). In no \\"dong\\" (smaller division) do women outnumber men.

Most people in Ulsan go here infrequently, however, as it lies at the other end of a twisted road over the hills just south of Muryongsan (Î¨¥Î£°ÏÇ∞), Ulsan's second-highest hill. * Jujeon Mongdol beach (Ï£ºÏ†ÑÎ™ΩÎèåÌï¥Î≥Ä) Jujeon Mongdol beach (Ï£ºÏ†ÑÎ™ΩÎèåÌï¥Î≥Ä) is a beach that connects Jujeon (Ï£ºÏ†Ñ) and Gangdong (Í∞ïÎèô) and its length is about 1.5 km. It was also selected as one of the \\"12 must-see natural sights of Ulsan2 by Ulsan Metropolitan Government. Different from most beaches that are covered with sand, Junjeon Mongdol beach is covered with smooth pebble stones. Especially the seaside course that connects Jujeon (Ï£ºÏ†Ñ)-Jengja (Ï†ïÏûê)-Gangdong (Í∞ïÎèô) is well known for the best drive course of Ulsan. Transport Transport in Buk-gu is simple, as most of the population are in striking distance of either the Ring Road or National Road 7, which is the main road up the East Coast of South Korea and which, at this point, connects Ulsan with Gyeongju to the north. Ulsan's domestic airport (IATA Code: USN), which serves Seoul is located in Buk-gu.

Biography ≈†ovagoviƒá was born in the village of Ladimirevci, in the Slavonia region of Croatia, then Kingdom of Yugoslavia. He began acting in his youth and from the late 1950s he appeared in many films, becoming one of the most recognisable faces of Croatian and former Yugoslav cinema. He never became a star, but he built a reputation as one of the greatest character actors with memorable roles in many classic films and popular television series. Matija Gubec, whom he played in 1975 film Seljaƒçka buna, is one of his rare starring roles. In 1979 he played the role of a Dervish in Meetings with Remarkable Men, directed by Peter Brook. ≈†ovagoviƒá was also active in theatre and those experiences led him to begin writing plays of his own. The best known of them all is Sokol ga nije volio (\\"Sokol Did Not Love Him\\"), later adapted in 1988 film. It was his movie about his birthplace, Ladimirevci. His most unforgettable last role was of a Slavonian refugee man in the 1994 movie Vukovar se vraƒáa kuƒái (\\"Vukovar: The Way Home\\"). A man lost everything in war except his loving companion dog, and shares destiny of many of his fellow citizens who are exiled from the Slavonian town of Vukovar. Many believe his brilliant reflection of this tragic Slavonian character was due to a fact that ≈†ovagoviƒá being a native Slavonian Croat, have known this feeling firsthand himself. ≈†ovagoviƒá played brilliant role of policeman (≈Ωandar) in television series \\"Kuda idu divlje svinje?\\" (Where Do Wild Boars Go?). Through the last years of his life, ≈†ovagoviƒá struggled with the consequences of heart strokes. He died in Zagreb, on 1 January 2001, aged 68. Personal life ≈†ovagoviƒá was married his wife Maja Bla≈°kov, with whom he had two children; a daughter, Anja, and a son, Filip, both actors.

The second-generation Eclipse Gemini 2 was launched in 2009, followed by the third-generation Gemini 3 in 2013. Additionally, the body was available on Volvo Super Olympian chassis in Hong Kong between 2003 and 2005, marketed as the Wright Explorer. Production of the Gemini have been suspended as Wrightbus entered administration in September 2019. The original Eclipse Gemini was launched in 2001 on Volvo B7TL chassis; from 2006, the body was also built on the replacement Volvo B9TL chassis and, from 2013, on the B9TL's replacement, the Volvo B5TL. From 2008, the body was also available on Volvo B5LH hybrid chassis. Wright Eclipse Gemini bodied buses were mass-introduced on London Buses services from 2001. It has also been popular with FirstGroup, who have purchased over 1,200 into service. Dublin Bus and Bus √âireann have also acquired many Volvo B9TLs with Wright Eclipse Gemini bodywork.  First generation (2001‚Äì2009)  The Eclipse Gemini was launched in 2001, initially on Volvo B7TL chassis, as a double decker version of the existing Wright Eclipse body. The original Eclipse Gemini, and all versions up until the facelifted Gemini 3, have both the upper and lower deck front windscreens forming part of a single oval shape, with the destination blind in between. In London, as with most buses, Eclipse Geminis often have two doors for passenger loading, one at the front and one in the centre; elsewhere, a single door at the front is more common. Also on London examples, the staircase is situated across from the centre entrance, while on single door variants, the staircase is located at the front, directly behind the driver's cab. The staircase itself differs from other modern buses as rather than simply having a banister, the Eclipse Gemini features a glass panel underneath the handrail, giving a stylish appearance. All Eclipse Geminis are fitted with LED rear lights. Although London and Lothian Buses models retain calico blinds, most Eclipse Geminis are fitted with LED destination screens. As is common on most new buses, stop request buttons appear on both floors and should these be pressed, the word \\"Stopping\\" appears in red on a black glass effect panel, much more streamlined than the traditional box housing. The interior of the Eclipse Gemini features curves similar to its exterior, and continues the modern feel. = 2006 facelift = In 2006, the Volvo B7TL chassis was superseded by the Volvo B9TL; at the same time, Wrightbus launched a facelifted version of the Eclipse Gemini on the new chassis. The updated styling was largely confined to the rear of the body, where it has a more rounded appearance compared to the original and a central LED route number panel, housed within a smoked glass effect panel underneath the upper rear window. Other external modifications included the relocation of the rear number plate from its integrated position with the upper rear window to a more conventional siting at the bottom of the bus. Internally, the facelift consisted of an extension of the driver guard panel to include the on-bus vault (passengers now must put their hand through a gap in the panel to reach the vault) and a slightly modified staircase separation wall, which featured a glass panel, presumably to improve the view of passengers sitting in the seat directly in front of the wall. The Eclipse Gemini was also made available on the hybrid Volvo B5LH chassis in 2008. The first six hybrid Eclipse Geminis were delivered to Arriva London in 2009.Volvo hybrid double-deck handed over at historic venue Fleet Ireland 11 July 2009 Of the 2,555 produced between 2001 and 2009, FirstGroup purchased 1,133, Go-Ahead Group 281, Arriva 244, National Express 231 and Lothian Buses 225.Wright Eclipse Gemini Bus Lists on the Web = Wright Explorer = Between 2003 and 2005, Wrightbus bodied 100 Volvo Super Olympian chassis for Kowloon Motor Bus in Hong Kong; these received a modified version of the Eclipse Gemini body, marketed as the Wright Explorer. The bodywork was modified to fit the Super Olympian chassis, with the most noticeable difference being the tri-axle layout. The last Volvo Super Olympian to roll off the production line received Wright Explorer bodywork. Subsequently, the Super Olympian was replaced by a tri-axle variant of the Volvo B9TL. Wrightbus offered similar tri-axle bodywork, which was unnamed and had slightly different rear styling, to the chassis. After the introduction of Euro IV-engined Volvo B9TL, this bodywork became known as the Eclipse Gemini tri-axle, but no bodywork carrying this name were known to have been built.  Second generation (2008‚Äì2018)  The second generation Wright Eclipse Gemini, called the Eclipse Gemini 2, was launched in 2008 on Volvo B9TL and B5LH chassis. The Eclipse Gemini 2 features front and rear ends facelifted to match the Eclipse 2 single-decker, as part of Wrightbus' new design philosophy. A low-roof version was introduced in 2012. In March 2015, Delaine Buses took delivery of both the last Eclipse Gemini 2 and the last Volvo B9TL to be built for the United Kingdom and Ireland.\\"Last Gemini 2 enters service with Delaine\\" Buses issue 721 April 2015 page 11 Dublin Bus purchased 160 during 2012 and 2013.Dublin Bus Fleet Dublin Bus Like the Explorer, the Eclipse Gemini 2 was sold in Hong Kong, including a tri-axle variant that replaced the Explorer.

The Gemini 3 also remained available on Volvo B5LH hybrid chassis. Some design features were taken from the New Routemaster, another Wrightbus design. The two most noticeable aesthetic changes were a substantial redesign of the rear end and the introduction of smaller upper deck windows to save weight; the front light clusters were also slightly redesigned, in order to incorporate separate LED daytime running lights for the first time. Dublin Bus had a total of 546 of these buses in service by December 2019. = 2014 facelift = In 2014, to coincide with the launch of the integral Wright StreetDeck, the Gemini 3 underwent a facelift. Both the front and rear ends were substantially redesigned to match the StreetDeck. However, both the pre- and post-facelift versions of the Gemini 3 remain on sale concurrently.

Foundation schools were set up under the School Standards and Framework Act 1998 to replace grant-maintained schools, which were funded directly by central government. Grant-maintained schools that had previously been voluntary controlled or county schools (but not voluntary aided) usually became foundation schools. Foundation schools are a kind of \\"maintained school\\", meaning that they are funded by central government via the local education authority, and do not charge fees to students. As with voluntary controlled schools, all capital and running costs are met by the government. As with voluntary aided schools, the governing body employs the staff and has responsibility for admissions to the school, subject to rules imposed by central government. Pupils follow the National Curriculum.Types of School , Citizens Advice Bureau. Some foundation schools, also called trust schools, have a foundation or trust that owns the land and buildings. Otherwise the land and buildings are owned by the governing body. The foundation usually appoints about a quarter of the school governors, as in voluntary controlled schools, but in some cases it appoints the majority of governors, as in voluntary aided schools. Within the maintained sector in England, approximately 2% of primary schools and 15% of secondary schools are foundation schools. Almost all of these are non-faith schools. The proportion is considerably smaller in Wales, where four primary schools and eight secondary schools have foundation status.

The first one was primarily a foe of Batman and Robin, while the second was the archenemy to Nightwing. The latest version first appeared in the pages of the series 52 wherein he is directed into battle against Lex Luthor's team of superheroes. Publication history The Mark Desmond version of Blockbuster first appeared in Detective Comics #345 and was created by Gardner Fox and Carmine Infantino. The Roland Desmond version of Blockbuster first appeared in Starman #9 and was created by Roger Stern and Tom Lyle. Fictional character biography =Mark Desmond= The first Blockbuster was Mark Desmond, a chemist who desired to increase his physical strength. Experimenting on himself, he succeeded in making himself stronger and taller, but as a side-effect of the process he also became almost mindlessly aggressive. The mentally debilitated Desmond was cared for by his brother Roland, a local criminal, who kept their mother from discovering what Mark had done to himself. Roland manipulated his brother into committing crimes on his behalf until they came into conflict with Batman and Robin. Bruce Wayne had once rescued a young Desmond from drowning, and he discovered that he could calm the enraged adult Desmond by removing his cowl and showing his face. Desmond later found himself clashing with Batman on various occasions. He joined the Secret Society of Super Villains briefly for a battle with the Justice League. Later, Amanda Waller recruited Desmond for her revived Suicide Squad. He was killed fighting Darkseid's creation, Brimstone. In Pre-Crisis, Blockbuster absorbed energies from the Alfred Memorial which gave him some powers and was once substituted for the super-strong undead villain Solomon Grundy from Earth-2 due to a machine that was substituting people from both Earths. Green Lantern caused him to fight Solomon Grundy, leading to them both briefly getting the fight knocked out of each other. In September 2011, The New 52 rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, Mark Desmond is a patient of Dr. Phayne's. He lives on the estate and at night he undergoes procedures to enhance his intelligence. He is exposed to small amounts of a green compound intravenously. An accident is caused by a new patient believing he is in pain and the cascade of green liquid overdoses Desmond and creates an explosion. The overdose exposes a super-strong man calling himself Blockbuster. He rampages from the building in pain and knocks an attacking Hawkman unconscious.Savage Hawkman #18 Blockbuster was later mind-controlled by Necromancer to help her steal an artifact from a Washington D.C. museum, which brought the attention of Hawk and Dove. They teamed up with Batman and Robin to stop Blockbuster and Necromancer.Hawk and Dove (vol. 5) #6 Mark Desmond later appears as a member of the Secret Society of Super Villains upon having been recruited by Outsider. When Catwoman breaks out of Arkham Asylum, Mark Desmond and Signalman confronted Catwoman on a rooftop, which ended with Catwoman being knocked out.Justice League of America (vol. 3) #3 =Roland Desmond= Roland Desmond became the second Blockbuster after a severe illness forced him to be treated with experimental steroids. Like his brother Mark, Roland became a child-minded super-strong monster. He ran wild in the Southwest, but Batman and Starman (Will Payton) brought his rampage to an end.Starman #10 (May 1989) Desmond became obsessed with elevating himself greatly above his debilitated intellect. A pact with the demon Neron granted him a genius-level intellect and Desmond embarked once more on a career of crime and destruction. He began his revived criminal career by causing chaos in the town of Manchester, although his schemes were foiled by the speedster, Impulse. Desmond then moved to his mother's home town of Bl√ºdhaven. He forced the crime lord Angel Marin out of power and took over the city's criminal rackets. Roland's plan was to build a criminal empire in the 'Haven, that would eventually enable him to extend his dominion over Gotham, Star City, Metropolis, and New York's underworlds. For that purpose, he bought the corrupt elements of the city's police department, most notably Police Chief Redhorn and Inspector Dudley \\"Deadly\\" Soames. Despite his swift and vicious consolidation of power, Blockbuster's hold on Bl√ºdhaven's organized crime was nevertheless weakened by the intervention of the city's new protector, Nightwing (Dick Grayson, the former Robin), who, with Oracle's help, foiled Desmond's plans at every turn. Oracle often removes money from Blockbuster's accounts and he has a man working to stop and find Oracle, named Vogel.Nightwing #44 (June 2000) Desmond's primary goal became the elimination of the young vigilante. He placed a contract on Nightwing's life, employing the services of several assassins, including Lady Vic, Stallion, Brutale, the Trigger Twins, and Shrike. As a further result of his initial transformation, Desmond later developed albinism and a heart defect. He was restored to (comparative) health by a heart transplant from one of the talking apes of Gorilla City, and was consolidating his control over Bl√ºdhaven and contemplating a takeover of Gotham City, when he was killed by the new Tarantula, Catalina Flores.Nightwing (vol. 2) #93 (July 2004) As part of the Blackest Night event, Roland's corpse is reanimated by a black power ring and recruited to the Black Lantern Corps in Blackest Night: Batman #1 (October 2009). In the DC Rebirth reboot, Blockbuster appears, asking Nightwing to help with a job.Nightwing (vol. 4) #22 =Blockbuster III= Lex Luthor created a new Blockbuster in the pages of the miniseries event, 52, to serve as an opponent of his manufactured hero team, Infinity, Inc. Little is revealed about this Blockbuster, save for the fact that Luthor possesses some measure of control over his actions and level of strength. Luthor also comments that he is stronger than either of the previous two Blockbusters. This brute's cognitive abilities and appearance are very similar to the original. Blockbuster, with controlled interference from Lex Luthor, kills the superhero Trajectory. =Martian Manhunter's disguise= A Blockbuster appears among the villains exiled to an alien world in Salvation Run. In issue #3, it is revealed to be a disguised Martian Manhunter. =Female Blockbuster= A newer, female Blockbuster appears in the swamps of Louisiana and fights Mon- El.Superman #689 (August 2009) =The Blockbuster's Gang= The Blockbuster's Gang first appears in Nightwing (vol. 2) #2. The Blockbuster's Gang was one of the most powerful mobs in Bl√ºdhaven, made up of corrupt police officers and supervillains. Organization Leader: Roland Desmond. Current Members: Thrilldevil, Giz, Mouse and Mateo Flores. Former Members: Brutale, Electrocutioner II, Torque, Lady Vic, Shrike, Stallion, Tarantula, the Trigger Twins and Cicso Blane. Powers and abilities All Blockbusters have superhuman strength, stamina, and endurance. They also have a high degree of resistance to physical and energy attacks. In a straight fight, typically their greatest weakness is their comparatively slower speed, making it relatively easy to evade opposing attacks, although this is of limited use if confronting Blockbuster inside buildings. After selling his soul to Neron, Roland Desmond gained genius-level intelligence. Alternative versions =Batman/Aliens= The Roland Desmond version of Blockbuster is mentioned as using a construction company as a Trojan horse. However, the owner and multiple workers are killed by an Alien they unearth from a bioweapons lab at a construction site. =DC Animated Universe comics= The Roland Desmond version of Blockbuster appears in Adventures in the DC Universe #1 and DC Comics Presents: Wonder Woman Adventures #1. =Batman: Arkham= In Batman: Arkham Knight-Genesis, a prequel comic to Batman: Arkham Knight, the Mark Desmond version of Blockbuster and Catman brutally beat Jason Todd, the second Robin, while dressed in Batman costumes as part of the Joker's brainwashing of Todd. Todd fought back, but was reluctant to kill them. Harley Quinn encouraged him, shooting Blockbuster in the chest to prove her point. =Just Imagine...= In Stan Lee's Just Imagine... series, Blockbuster is reimagined as Brock Smith, a death row inmate notorious for a series of mass murders committed with his bare hands, who is rescued by the series' mysterious villain Dominic Darrk and re-empowered with extra super-strength (and a purple carapace) as part of a villainous Doom Patrol. He is defeated and de-powered by Batman and Wonder Woman (who crack his purple facade with Wonder Woman's staff), and dies after running over a live electrical cable. In other media =Television= * The Mark Desmond version of Blockbuster is first seen in Justice League Unlimited, voiced by Dee Bradley Baker. In the episode \\"Kid Stuff\\", he, Cheetah, Copperhead and KGBeast were fighting Green Lantern, Wonder Woman, Batman and Superman at Fort Knox's gold vault and were defeated before Mordred used an ancient amulet to transport all of the adults in the world to another dimension; Blockbuster being among the ones teleported to the other dimension. In the episode \\"I Am Legion\\", Blockbuster is also shown as a member of the Secret Society. In the episode \\"Alive\\", Blockbuster sides against Lex Luthor during the mutiny in favor of Gorilla Grodd. He is frozen by Killer Frost and blown up by Darkseid along with the other mutineers. * Mark Desmond appears in The Batman animated series, voiced by Kevin Michael Richardson. Unlike in the comics, he is African-American. In the episode \\"Meltdown\\", Desmond is a scientist working for Wayne Enterprises who is in charge of Ethan Bennett's parole agreement of not using shapeshifting powers. * The Mark Desmond version of Blockbuster appears in Batman: The Brave and the Bold, with Mark Desmond voiced by James Arnold Taylor and Blockbuster voiced again by Kevin Michael Richardson. In the teaser of \\"Death Race to Oblivion!\\", Batman has been keeping an eye on since he stole some chemicals from S.T.A.R. Labs and confronts evil child genius Desmond at a museum with a plot to steal a diamond called the Star of Bialya. The crowd objects to Batman grabbing Desmond until the boy drinks the serum that transforms him into Blockbuster. As Blockbuster, he subdues Batman. When Billy Batson steps forth, Blockbuster grabs and asks Billy if there are any last words. Billy shouts \\"Shazam!\\" and transforms into Captain Marvel who manages to defeat Blockbuster. In the episode \\"Night of the Batmen\\", Blockbuster assists Bane, Killer Croc, and Solomon Grundy in stealing a statue, only to be thwarted by Captain Marvel dressed as Batman. Young Justice. * The Mark Desmond version of Blockbuster first appears in the Young Justice animated series, with Mark Desmond voiced by Ren√© Auberjonois while sound effects were used for Blockbuster's vocal effects. This version of Blockbuster is very different in appearance from any of his comic book incarnations, having purposefully been redesigned as it was felt the original version was too similar to the Hulk. His transformation in the series involves his Blockbuster form ripping through his human skin. In the episode \\"Independence Day\\", Mark Desmond is shown as a senior member of Project Cadmus who takes his orders directly from the Light (Project Cadmus' Board of Directors) and uses the Blockbuster serum in order to combat Robin, Kid Flash, Aqualad and Superboy.

Her main career was as a recitalist and concert singer. Her voice, both powerful and deep, impressed contemporary composers such as Saint-Sa√´ns and Elgar; the latter composed a song-cycle with her in mind as soloist. Butt appeared in only two operatic productions, both of Gluck's Orfeo ed Euridice. Later in her career she frequently appeared in recitals together with her husband, the baritone Kennerley Rumford. She made numerous recordings for the gramophone. Early life and career Clara Butt was born in Southwick, Sussex, the eldest daughter of Henry Albert Butt, a sea captain, and his wife Clara n√©e Hook.Kennedy, Michael. \\"Butt, Dame Clara Ellen (1872‚Äì1936)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004.

Clara was educated at South Bristol High School, where her singing ability was recognised and her talent as a performer encouraged. At the request of her headmistress, she was trained by the bass Daniel Rootham (father of the composer Cyril Rootham) and joined the Bristol Festival Chorus, of which Daniel Rootham was musical director. Butt won a scholarship to the Royal College of Music (RCM) in January 1890.

She also studied in Berlin and Italy. Clara Butt in 1898 She made her professional debut on 7 December 1892 at the Royal Albert Hall in London in Sullivan's cantata The Golden Legend. Three days later she appeared as Orfeo in Gluck's Orfeo ed Euridice at the Lyceum Theatre. This was an RCM production, conducted by Charles Villiers Stanford.\\"Dame Clara Butt\\", The Times, 24 January 1936, p. 16 Bernard Shaw, who was then the music critic for The World, wrote that she \\"far surpassed the utmost expectations that could reasonably be entertained\\", and forecast a considerable career for her.Shaw, p. 765 Butt travelled to Paris and undertook further studies with Jacques Bouhy (the teacher of two other notable contraltos with international reputations, Louise Homer and Louise Kirkby Lunn). Later she polished her skills in Berlin with the famous retired soprano Etelka Gerster. The French composer Camille Saint-Sa√´ns heard her, and wanted her to study his opera Dalila, but at the time the representation of biblical subjects on the British stage was forbidden, and nothing came of it.Leonard, pp. 66‚Äì67 When the law changed and the work was given at Covent Garden in 1909 the part of Delila was sung by Lunn, to Butt's disappointment.Leonard, p. 67 Butt acquired a reputation in Britain for her vocal attributes and her physical presence on the concert platform: she was 6 feet 2 inches tall.

Retrieved 2 September 2010 her friend Fanny Ronalds bequeathed the original manuscript of the song to her. She was primarily a concert singer; her only operatic performances were in two productions of Orfeo ed Euridice. Britain's leading composer of the era, Edward Elgar, composed his song-cycle Sea Pictures for contralto and orchestra with her in mind as soloist; she sang at the first performance of the work at the Norwich Festival on 5 October 1899, with the composer conducting. Her only recording from the cycle was \\"Where Corals Lie\\". 20th century Butt with her husband Kennerley Rumford On 26 June 1900 Butt married the baritone Kennerley Rumford and thereafter would often appear with him in concerts. They had two sons and a daughter. Besides singing in many important festivals and concerts, Butt appeared by royal command before Queen Victoria, King Edward VII, and King George V. She made tours of Australia, Japan, Canada, New Zealand, the United States and to many European cities. During the First World War, Butt organised and sang in many concerts for service charities, and for this was appointed Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) in the 1920 civilian war honours. That year she sang four performances of Gluck's Orfeo ed Euridice at Covent Garden, with Miriam Licette, under the baton of Sir Thomas Beecham. According to The Times she was ill at ease on stage, and in the most famous number, \\"Che far√≤\\", her \\"attempt to sing it dramatically made her play fast and loose with the time and spoil the phrasing\\".\\"Dame Clara Butt in Opera\\", The Times, 2 July 1920, p. 10 It was her only appearance on the professional operatic stage.

One, Ethel Hook, became a famous contralto in her own right, made some solo recordings, and in 1926 appeared in an early sound film made in the Lee de Forest Phonofilm sound-on-film process. Later years In later years Clara's life was clouded by tragedy, with both her sons predeceasing her. During the 1920s, she became seriously ill with spinal cancer. Nevertheless, she continued to give concerts and make records. A devout Christian Scientist, she took part in revivalist meetings, singing, and giving sermons. She died on 23 January 1936. Voice Portrait of Dame Clara Butt (1927) Clara Butt's voice possessed at once power, sweetness, fullness, and extraordinary flexibility. W.J.Henderson described it 'the greatest contralto voice heard since Marietta Alboni'. She is always with her flawless diction and invariable sensitivity to both the words and the moods of the music, her interpretations are always utterly convincing. She is able to call upon a wide range of vocal effects, from booming fortissimo to the lovely light pianissimo. She sang regularly at the Crystal Palace, at the triennial Handel Festivals and at popular concerts. There, in its vast spaces, where other voices so easily evaporated she was supremely at home, pitting her voice against an orchestra and chorus of often 4,000 as well as the largest organ in the world. She studied Anton√≠n Leopold Dvo≈ô√°k's Biblical Songs with the composer. No other performances equal her overwhelming commitment and dedication in these songs. There is one unforgettable, almost stereophonic effect, as voice and organ, matching each other in plenitude of tone, echo round the recording hail.

A sub-group of the Kadazan- Dusun, they have a distinctive language, dress, architecture, customs, and oral literature. Subsistence As with most indigenous ethnic groups in Borneo, culture revolves around rice; however, coconut and banana groves provide cash income. Women weave cloth on backstrap looms, and make containers from vine or beadwork. Many Rungus now work in town, and have abandoned the communal life of the longhouse for modern Malaysian society. Traditionally animist, with female shamans, most Rungus are now Christian. Longhouses A large ceremonial bumbu ikan (fish trap) in a Rungus village in Kudat, Sabah in Borneo. A longhouse can be seen in the background, with distinct outward- sloped walls. Considered one of the most traditional ethnic groups in Sabah, many Momogun Rungus live in longhouses, with each family having its own separate quarters off a common hall. At the edge of the communal hall, a well- ventilated platform of split bamboo with outward sloping walls provides a place for socialising and communal work. The Rungus longhouse is quite different from the Murut longhouse. The houses are not perched on high stilts, but are usually only three to five feet above ground. The roof is low, and the walls are outward sloped. In olden times, longhouses of over 75 doors are said to have been common. Now, they rarely exceed 10 doors. Usually single story, more modern two-story versions of the longhouse also exist. Single-family houses are sometimes built near the longhouse ‚Äì these take the same form, but are curiously short, looking like a slice from a cake. Dress The traditional Rungus dress is black in colour, often with hundreds or even thousands of dollars worth of antique beads. Traditionally all of the Rungus women wore heavy brass coils around their arms, legs and necks. Brass arm coils are often accompanied by white and coral shell bracelets. Rings of brass may also be worn around the waist. =Beadwork= This beadwork and its designs easily distinguish the Rungus from the other ethnic groups of Sabah. \\"The beadwork often tells a story and this one in particular tells of a man going spear-hunting for a riverine creature\\". The pinakol consists of a pair of flat beaded bandoleer-type belts worn crossed over the chest and back. The sandang is a pair of long beaded strands, mostly with matching beads. These are worn crossed over the chest like the pinakol. The sullau is a flat beaded choker worn around the neck with two clamshell discs, one in front and one in back. Small bells are attached in the front. They make the discs out of plastic nowaday The tinggot is a short choker, either single beaded or with narrow beadwork. Men and women wear these. The togkul is a necklace some 26 inches (66 cm) long with beads similar to the sandang but smaller and worn around the neck. The sisingal is a narrow beaded band worn around the head. The rampai is made of cotton, flowers and beads worked into the hair. The orot. \\"Little brass rings and antique beads looped through thin strands of stripped bark (togung) becomes a wide and colorful hipband. To wear this the orot is slowly and carefully coiled around the hip. Then a last string of beads (Llobokon) is hung loosely from the coil. The orot is hand made by the Rungus men as the technique is known only to them\\". The bobolizan originates with the Tuaran Lotud group of Sabah, but according to Rose Sabala sometimes Rungus wear bobolizan to talk to spirits in the old language. There are also sad'ang, earrings that sometimes have beads attached. Many of the beads used by the Rungus are plastic and glass imitations of older heirloom beads. Materials such as plastic spoons were heated over a flame and the hot plastic are then winded onto a metal rod to make yellow beads. Cuisine Three Rungus ladies selling home-produced products in Sikuati Town, Sabah, Malaysia. Rungus cuisine is mainly prepared using cooking methods like braising, grilling and baking. Being a community of fishermen and farmers, the staple foods of the Rungus people usually consists of rice and cassava, supplemented with green vegetables and fish. Tinunuvan soguntung is the Rungus term for a preparation of grilled or roasted eggplant. The cooked eggplant is peeled, and served with chillies, lime juice, toasted ikan bilis or salted fish, and sprigs of lompodos (a local variety of basil). Tinonggilan is a slightly sparkling alcoholic drink made from maize. Akin to the Latin American corn beer, Tinonggilan is a Rungus speciality and is usually served during festive occasions, or as refreshments for guests during the performance of a ritual dance called Mongigol Sumundai. The Rungus also prepare simple sweet foods such as flatbread made from sweetened grated cassava (tinopis runti) and bintanok dalai, or mashed corn wrapped and steamed in corn husks. These are to be consumed for breakfast or as snacks. Festival Like the Kadazan-Dusun, Rungus people also celebrate Kaamatan. This festival is usually celebrated on 31 May every year. Even though there are many similarities the way of celebration between this two race but there is also comparison.

He served primarily as a utility infielder during his eight seasons in Major League Baseball, playing for the St. Louis Cardinals from 1921 through 1928. He batted left-handed and threw right-handed and was listed as tall and . Toporcer is widely considered as the first major league baseball position player to wear eyeglasses on the playing field.Spectacular players can wear spectaclesGlasses Half Full The distinction gained Toporcer his nickname, \\"Specs\\".  Early life  From an early age, like most children at the time, George Toporczer was obsessed with baseball. In an interview, he admitted that for the last seventy five years scarce a day had gone by that he had not contemplated the sport. He stated that in spite of his obsession he was always picked last during childhood games because of his slight build and glasses. He went to school and became friends with actor Jimmy Cagney, staying in touch into the later portions of their lives. Toporczer said the first thing that hooked him on baseball was when he was six and went to the 1905 World Series. At the World Series he watched the Giants‚Äô Christy Mathewson pitch three shutouts The experience was further reinforced by his two older brothers who, being diehard Giants fans, idolized the players, speaking of little else but the performance of their favorite team. The fanaticism of his older brothers soaked into young George and he too became a diehard Giants fan. He became so attached to the Giants that when they lost the pennant to the Chicago Cubs in , due to Merkle's Boner, he cried himself to sleep. By the time he was ten he would walk the five miles from his house to the Polo Grounds. Although the one cent allowance that his father, a shoe and boot seller, was not enough to get him a ticket, he found a spot on Coogan's Bluff that he could take advantage of an open space in the roof of the Polo Grounds. Unlike most of his peers, he was enthralled with what was known then as inside baseball which were the strategies and tactics of the \\"dead-ball\\" era. While still loving the Giant's players, Toporczer held a special admiration of the Giants‚Äô manager John McGraw, who he considered the best of his time. Out of all of the Giants players, George's favorite was the left fielder, George Burns. When he was thirteen Toporczer got a job at a local saloon as a scorekeeper, writing down the scores of the baseball games in exchange for fifty cents and free meals. While in seventh grade George's history teacher formed a school baseball team but he was turned down from it because of his slight figure and his glasses. Even though he was not on the team, Toporczer still went to all of their games to cheer them on. At one of these games, he was the only one there to cheer the team on and the team was short one player so he was drafted into play centerfield. During that game he made a difficult catch and contributed two hits. Around this time Toporczer's father died and passed the business on to George's older brother. George had to forgo high school and help his brother run the shoe and boot store. By working at the store and picking up odd jobs on the side, \\\\ Toporczer was making more than enough to buy tickets and would regularly go to the Polo Grounds.The Glory of Their Times, additional text.  Playing career  = Major leagues = Born and reared in the Yorkville section of Manhattan, he never played high school or college ball and went directly from the sandlots to major league competition in 1921. Now known as George Toporcer, he split his first professional season between the Cardinals and the minor league Syracuse Stars, the Cardinals' top farm team. He played all infield positions for the Cardinals, especially shortstop, and was the club's most-used midfielder in both and . In 1928, Toporcer got into only eight games for the Cardinals, and spent the bulk of the year with their top farm team, the Rochester Red Wings. In his eight-season major-league career, Toporcer was a .279 hitter with nine home runs and 151 RBI in 546 games. As a fielder, he appeared in 453 games at shortstop (249 games), second base (105), third base (95), first base (3) and right field (1). = Minor league player-manager = Following his major league career, Toporcer played for the Cardinals Triple-A affiliate Rochester on four straight pennant-winning teams (1929‚Äì1932), being named the International League MVP in 1929 and 1930. He became the Red Wings' manager in 1932, continuing to play and manage the team until 1934. He continued to play in the minors until 1941, typically serving as a player- manager. During his seven years playing for Rochester, the Red Wings won the International League pennant four consecutive years. For the last three years in Rochester, he served as the manager of the Rochester team. But after a financial dispute with general manager Branch Rickey, Toporcer left the St. Louis organization. He would pilot other minor league teams for the next seven years before he became the farm director for the Boston Red Sox. Toporcer left the Red Sox in 1948 and became the farm system director of the Chicago White Sox in 1949 and 1950. Loss of sight In 1951, while managing the Buffalo Bisons, Toporcer became blind after a fifth operation to save his failing eyesight was unsuccessful. During his time as the farm director for the Red Sox, Toporcer had begun to notice spots in his vision that were obstructing his sight. After visiting an eye specialist and having a lengthy examination, the doctor diagnosed him with a detached retina. Toporcer got the required surgery and the doctor proscribed a thirty-day bed rest, forbidden from moving his head so as not the dislodge the retina while it healed. Once the thirty days were over, the doctor removed the bandages to find the surgery had been unsuccessful; Toporcer had lost sight in his left eye. Another attempt was made to save his left eye, but it was unsuccessful. Then, while managing Buffalo in 1951, Toporcer began to experience problems with his right eye. After three more unsuccessful surgeries on that orb, Toporcer became blind in both eyes. The Cardinals and Red Sox held benefits to defray the expenses of Toporcer's eye surgeries, but because years of playing baseball had toughened his fingertipsSkelton, David E., Specs Toporcer.

He is best known for his popular essay/book Cosmic View (1957) which presents a seminal view of the universe, from the galactic to the microscopic scale, and which inspired several films. Boeke tried to reform education by allowing the children to contribute their ideas. He called this process sociocracy and regarded schools as workshops, with pupils as workers, and teachers as co- workers. Based on Quaker ideas, he wanted the children to respect democracy. In 1926, he founded a school in Bilthoven, which he led until 1954. As a child, the later Dutch Queen Beatrix attended the school. Biography Boeke was born on 25 September 1884 to a Mennonite family in Alkmaar, Netherlands, where he grew up. He studied architecture at the Delft University of Technology. As a student, he spent a year in England, where he met the Quakers. He became a Quaker and attended Woodbrooke Quaker Study Centres, a college in Selly Oak, Birmingham. There, he found inspiration in Bournville, the garden village which the Cadbury family (owners of the chocolate factory) had built for their workers. He met and married Beatrice (Betty) Cadbury. The couple went to modern day Lebanon in 1912 as Quaker missionaries, where Kees was headmaster at the Brummana School. In 1914, after the outbreak of World War I, they returned to England. They became active in peace work, the Fellowship of Reconciliation having come into being in 1914 through Henry Hodgkin. In 1915 Boeke traveled to Berlin, where he met Friedrich Siegmund- Schultze, with whom Hodgkin had been working at the outbreak of war. Boeke began to speak publicly in England: \\"The Germans are our brothers; God did not create man that he might kill; the war will find its quickest end when all soldiers lay down their weapons.\\" He was deported from Britain and returned to the Netherlands. His family followed; there they lived in Bilthoven, near Utrecht. Their home soon became a pacifist centre. Later in the Second World War, Boeke took part in the underground Dutch resistance movement against the same Germans that he called brothers before. This was, however, in line with his ideas of anti-authoritianism and his disapproval of war and prosecution. After the First World War, Boeke erected a large conference centre in Bilthoven, which he called \\"Brotherhood House.\\" The first international peace conference took place there between 4 and 11 October 1919. Present at the conference were Leon Revoyne, Mathilda Wrede, Leonard Ragaz, Pierre Ceresole, as well as Hodgkin and Schultze. Boeke and Ceresole became the secretaries of this movement, which initially called itself \\"Christian International\\", later the International Fellowship of Reconciliation. Together with Helene St√∂cker, and Wilfred Wellock, they founded the Service Civil International and in 1921 \\"Paco\\" (the Esperanto word for peace), which in 1923 became War Resisters' International (WRI). Kees and Betty Boeke considered war to be rooted in the entanglement of the state and capitalism. As Betty was a Cadbury, she inherited large shares in her family's firm. She renounced her wealth, transferring this money to various charitable organizations such as the Quaker-Help Organisation in Russia in 1920. Later, she gave the shares to a trust for the workers of the Cadbury factory. For a while, the Boekes abstained from using money, so as to avoid contributing to the state ‚Äî since public funds are also spent on weapons. They never used public transport, nor did they pay postage, tolls, or taxes. As a result, they were imprisoned several times. On one occasion the Dutch tax authorities auctioned off the estate in order to recover taxes. Queen Wilhelmina was in attendance at the auction, and purchased Kees' favorite violin, only to return it to him on the spot. Boeke supported his family by working in Utrecht in a building association which he had founded; he did not work as an architect (which was his training), but as a simple worker. In the late 1920s Boeke increasingly withdrew from international peace movements. Believing he could build a better society through educating children, he started a school called \\"De werkplaats\\" (the workshop). He founded his school in 1926 when all private schools, including the Montessori school his children attended, started receiving an equal amount of money per child from the state, to which he objected. Kees Boeke with Beatrix of the Netherlands (right) in 1946 His school, which uses Maria Montessori's methods, extended by Boeke's own educational ideas, became nationally known; even the Dutch queen Juliana sent her daughters there.(Dutch) De school van Beatrix. Andere Tijden, 25 september 2008 The school has been hugely influential for its creative way of making the students co-responsible for their own curriculum, together with the teachers; many students who failed in regular schools have blossomed at \\"De werkplaats\\", but on the other hand many talented children could not reach a high level in this school. Co-responsibility in school did not mean a freewheeling life at \\"the Werkplaats\\". Children had to perform tasks such as cleaning the school, growing vegetables and fruits, and helping with lunch cooking. Boeke's notion of sociocracy was, in effect, a secular implementation of the Quaker ideals applied to education in such a way that children were treated as adults, and were on first-name terms with their teachers. In WWII, Kees and Betty sheltered Jews at their own peril, saving several lives. For this work, they were enshrined in Yad Vashem (Yad Vashem 4963.1) in 1992. Boeke wrote a major book on education. One of his last works was Cosmic View (New York 1957). On 3 July 1966, Boeke died in the company of his family in Abcoude, Netherlands. Legacy Boeke's system of sociocracy still survives, and his work was expanded upon through the efforts of a well-known student of Boeke's ideas, Dr. Gerard Endenburg, who in the 1960s and '70s developed a governance and decision-making methodology by the same name while directing the Endenburg Electrotechniek company. Boeke's essay/book Cosmic View (1957) presents a seminal view of the universe, from the galactic to the microscopic scale. It inspired several films: * Cosmic Zoom (1968) produced by the National Film Board of Canada * Powers of Ten (1968; new version in 1977) by Charles and Ray Eames * The IMAX film Cosmic Voyage (1996) produced for the Smithsonian Institution's National Air and Space Museum. * Superpowers of Ten (2013), a theater piece produced by Andr√©s Jaque and performed at the Lisbon Triennial, the Chicago Architectural Biennial, Museo Jumex in Mexico and ZKM in Karlsruhe * Cosmic View is mentioned as an inspiration by Will Wright, creator of a video game, Spore (2008).Cosmic view, inspiration for a video game.

Barlow is best remembered for his batting partnership with A N Hornby, which was immortalised in nostalgic poetry by Francis Thompson. He was also an umpire and a football referee, including at the record 26‚Äì0 score between Preston North End and Hyde in the FA Cup. Overview Cricket was engrained in Barlow from an early age, and he went on to play for Lancashire for 20 years and continued to play at lower levels into his sixties. He left school aged fourteen to work in a printing office as an apprentice compositor. He was later an iron moulder with Dobson & Barlow in Bolton, and then in 1865 he moved to Derbyshire when his father got work at the Staveley Iron Works. It was for Staveley Iron Works Cricket Club that Barlow first played cricket, becoming a cricket professional with Farsley in Leeds in 1871, which was the year in which he first played for Lancashire. From 1873 to 1877 he was the professional for Saltaire in Bradford. Barlow played one match for Derbyshire in the 1875 season against a United North of England Eleven. Barlow was 5 ft 8 inches tall and weighed approximately eleven stone. He was strong and sturdily built. Barlow was known for his defensive batting, which made it hard to dismiss him, and which earned him the nickname Stonewaller. On one occasion he scored no runs in a partnership of 45 with AN Hornby, who was dismissed for 44. He holds the world first-class record for the lowest score by a batsman carrying his bat: against Nottinghamshire in 1882 he batted through the innings and made 5 not out when Lancashire were dismissed for 69. Barlow was also a good bowler with much variation. According to a (possibly apocryphal) story related by Alan Gibson, Barlow was working as a railway porter when Hornby first encountered him. Hornby happened to see him batting against the bowling of the station-master, and asked if he might have a bowl himself. \\"Ay, do,\\" was the reply. \\"He's been in for a fortnight.\\"Gibson, Alan (1989) The Cricket Captains of England, The Pavilion Library. p. 41. At Lord's Barlow is immortalised in one of the best-known pieces of cricket poetry, a poem called At Lord's by Francis Thompson. In it Thompson remembers back watching Barlow and A N Hornby play for Lancashire through rose-tinted glasses. The first verse of the poem, which is repeated as the final verse is the best known: It is little I repair to the matches of the Southron folk, Though my own red roses there may blow; It is little I repair to the matches of the Southron folk, Though the red roses crest the caps, I know. For the field is full of shades as I near a shadowy coast, And a ghostly batsman plays to the bowling of a ghost, And I look through my tears on a soundless-clapping host As the run-stealers flicker to and fro, To and fro: Oh my Hornby and my Barlow long ago! The Ashes urn Barlow took part in the original Ashes match and is commemorated by the poem pasted on the side of The Ashes urn: When Ivo goes back with the urn, the urn;'' Studds, Steel, Read and Tylecote return, return;'' The welkin will ring loud,'' The great crowd will feel proud,'' Seeing Barlow and Bates with the urn, the urn;'' And the rest coming home with the urn.'' Test career England team with Dick Barlow as umpire, Trent Bridge 1899. Back row: Dick Barlow (umpire), Tom Hayward, George Hirst, Billy Gunn, J T Hearne (12th man), Bill Storer (wkt kpr), Bill Brockwell, V A Titchmarsh (umpire). Middle row: C B Fry, K S Ranjitsinhji, W G Grace (captain), Stanley Jackson. Front row: Wilfred Rhodes, Johnny Tyldesley. Barlow played seven times for England against Australia in England: in the match which gave rise to the Ashes at the Oval in 1882; and at Lord's, the Oval, and Old Trafford in 1884 and 1886. He made no big score in these matches, but his partnership with Allan Steel was the turning point of the game at Lord's in 1884, and at Manchester, in 1886, his steadiness pulled England through when the Australian bowlers were in deadly form on a slightly crumbled wicket. Moreover, he took seven wickets for 44 runs in Australia's second innings. In 1884 at Trent Bridge, for the North of England against the Australians, Barlow played the game of his life. He scored not out 10 and 101 and took ten wickets‚Äîfour for six runs and six for 42. It is on record that when the North started their second innings on a slow and nasty wicket, Fred Spofforth, Australia's Demon bowler said, \\"Give me the ball: they won't get more than 60\\". As events turned out they got 255, Barlow and Flowers putting on 158 runs together after five wickets had fallen for 53. At the end of that afternoon Barlow was a very happy man. Barlow paid three visits to Australia, going out with Alfred Shaw and Arthur Shrewsbury in 1881/1882, with the Hon. Ivo Bligh in 1882/3, and again with Shaw and Shrewsbury in 1886/1887. He played in every match of all three tours. On the first of those tours, after scoring 75 at Sydney against New South Wales, a local wag presented Barlow with a commemorative belt. \\"I thought we had the champion sticker in Alec Bannerman,\\" said the wag, \\"but you've fairly won the belt.\\" Late life Dick Barlow's grave Near the end of his life Barlow was quoted in the Manchester Guardian: \\"I don't think any cricketer has enjoyed his cricketing career better than I have done, and if I had my time to come over again I should certainly be what I have been all my life ‚Äì a professional cricketer\\". Barlow had a wife, Harriet, and a daughter, Eliza. He died 31 July 1919 in Stanley Park, Blackpool, and is buried in Layton Cemetery. On his tombstone is inscribed 'bowled at last'.

It has a low viscosity, low specific gravity and high API gravity due to the presence of a high proportion of light hydrocarbon fractions. It generally has a low wax content. Light crude oil receives a higher price than heavy crude oil on commodity markets because it produces a higher percentage of gasoline and diesel fuel when converted into products by an oil refinery.  Varying standards  The clear cut definition of light and heavy crude varies because the classification is based more on practical grounds than theoretical. The New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) defines light crude oil for domestic U.S. oil as having an API gravity between 37¬∞ API (840 kg/m3) and 42¬∞ API (816 kg/m3), while it defines light crude oil for non-U.S. oil as being between 32¬∞ API (865 kg/m3) and 42¬∞ API (816 kg/m3). The National Energy Board of Canada defines light crude oil as having a density less than 875.7 kg/m3 (API gravity greater than 30.1¬∞ API). The government of Alberta, which produces most of the oil in Canada, disagrees and defines it as oil with a density less than 850 kg/m3 (API gravity greater than 35¬∞ API) The Mexican state oil company, Pemex, defines light crude oil as being between 27¬∞ API (893 kg/m3) and 38¬∞ API (835 kg/m3). This variation in definition occurred because countries such as Canada and Mexico tend to have heavier crude oils than are commonly found in the United States, whose large oil fields historically produced lighter oils than are found in many other countries. Canada also uses the SI of units to measure oil rather than American oil industry conventional units, and the base temperature for density calculations is different in Canada at than the US at , resulting in slightly different density values.  Examples of light crude oils  A wide variety of benchmark crude oils worldwide are considered to be light. The most prominent in North America is West Texas Intermediate which has an API gravity of 39.6¬∞ API (827 kg/m3). It is often referred to by publications when quoting oil prices. The most commonly referenced benchmark oil from Europe is Brent Crude, which is 38.06¬∞ API (835 kg/m3). The third most commonly quoted benchmark is Dubai Crude, which is 31¬∞ API (871 kg/m3). This is considered light by Arabian standards but would not be considered light if produced in the U.S. The largest oil field in the world, Saudi Arabia's Ghawar field, produces light crude oils ranging from 33¬∞ API (860 kg/m3) to 40¬∞ API (825 kg/m3)  U.S. price  In the United States, the price of the front month light sweet crude oil futures contract, traded on the NYMEX commodity exchange (symbol CL), is widely reported as a proxy for the cost of imported crude oil. These contracts have delivery dates in all 12 months of the year.List of Commodity Delivery Dates on Wikinvest From below $20 a barrel in early 2002, it rose to an intraday peak of $70.85 at the end of August 2005 in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. A new intraday record high of $78.40 was set on July 14, 2006, prompted by the firing of at least six missiles by North Korea on July 4‚Äì5, 2006, and escalating Middle East violence. Subsequently, the price declined until on October 11, 2006, the price closed at $66.04. But, by August 2007, the price had reached a record high of $78.71, amid production output concerns in the North Sea and Nigeria.

It is resident throughout its range. The blackstart is 14 cm long and is named for its black tail, which is frequently fanned; the rest of its plumage is bluish-grey or grey-brown (North African races being browner, Middle Eastern races bluer). The sexes are similar. The song is a clear melancholy whistle: CHURlee...TRUloo...CHURlee...TRUlur..., with short phrases from the song used as a call. It is a species of rocky deserts and mountain slopes which nests in a rock crevice where it lays its 3‚Äì4 eggs. It feeds on insects, taken mainly on the ground. The blackstart is a confident species, unafraid of man. Taxonomy The first formal description of the blackstart was by the Dutch zoologist Coenraad Jacob Temminck in 1824 under the binomial name Saxicola melanura. The 5 volumes were originally issued in 102 parts, 1820-1839 The blackstart was included as the type species in the genus Cercomela introduced by Charles Lucien Bonaparte in 1856. Molecular phylogenetic studies published in 2010 and 2012 found that the genus Cercomela was polyphyletic with five species, including the blackstart, phylogenetically nested within the genus Oenanthe. As part of a reorganization of the species to create monotypic genera, the blackstart was assigned to the genus Oenanthe. The specific epithet melanura is from the classical Greek melanouros meaning \\"with a black tail\\" from melas \\"black\\" and oura \\"tail\\". There are 6 subspecies: *O. m. melanura (Temminck, 1824) ‚Äì northeast Egypt to Israel, Jordan and central Saudi Arabia *O. m. neumanni (Ripley, 1952) ‚Äì southwest Saudi Arabia, Yemen and Oman *O. m. lypura (Hemprich & Ehrenberg, 1833) ‚Äì north-central Sudan to Eritrea *O. m. aussae (Thesiger & Meynell, 1934) ‚Äì northeast Ethiopia, Djibouti and north Somalia *O. m. airensis (Hartert, 1921) ‚Äì north Niger to central Sudan *O. m. ultima (Bates, 1933) ‚Äì east Mali and west Niger The subspecies differ slightly in the colour of their plumage. Description The blackstart is around in length with a wingspan of and a weight of around . The nominate race O. m. melanura has blueish ash-grey upperparts with darker wings and a black rump and tail. The belly and under-wings are greyish white; the bill and legs are black. The sexes are similar. The North African subspecies O. m. lypura and O. m. airensis are browner than the nominate.  Distribution and habitat  * In Egypt, the blackstart is common in the Sinai peninsula * In Israel the species is primarily found in the Negev Desert, Arava Valley and Dead Sea areas; it is present in areas of the Jordan River valley further north, but is scarcer there. * In Jordan, the species is only found in western parts of the country, in areas from the Jordan River valley south through the Dead Sea region to the Arava Valley and Aqaba Mountains. Breeding The blackstart is monogamous and pairs remain on their breeding territory throughout the year. The nest is built entirely by the female and can be placed between boulders, in a rock crevice or in a disused burrow. The nest is a shallow cup of grass and leaves lined with hair and fine plant material. The female usually places small pebbles around the entrance of the nest. The 3 or 4 pale blue eggs with fine red-brown speckles are laid at daily intervals. They measure and weigh . They are incubated by the female and hatch after 13‚Äì14 days. The chicks are fed by both parents and fledge after around 14 days. Up to three broods can be raised in a year. A study conducted in Israel on the west shore of the Dead Sea found that a major cause of nest failure was the predation of the eggs by Golden and Cairo spiny mice.

It is referred to as \\"heavy\\" because its density or specific gravity is higher than that of light crude oil. Heavy crude oil has been defined as any liquid petroleum with an API gravity less than 20¬∞. Physical properties that differ between heavy crude oils and lighter grades include higher viscosity and specific gravity, as well as heavier molecular composition. In 2010, the World Energy Council defined extra heavy oil as crude oil having a gravity of less than 10¬∞ and a reservoir viscosity of no more than 10,000 centipoises. When reservoir viscosity measurements are not available, extra-heavy oil is considered by the WEC to have a lower limit of 4¬∞ ¬∞API. In other words, oil with a density greater than 1000 kg/m3 or, equivalently, and a specific gravity greater than 1 and a reservoir viscosity of no more than 10,000 centipoises.Rodriguez H. A., Vaca P., Gonzalez O., and De Mirabal M. C., \\"Integrated study of a heavy oil reservoir in the Orinoco Belt : A field case simulation\\" http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&cpsidt;=6242344 Heavy oils and asphalt are dense nonaqueous phase liquids (DNAPLs). They have a low solubility and a viscosity lower than, and density higher than, water.page 118 Large spills of DNAPL will quickly penetrate the full depth of the aquifer and accumulate on its bottom. Related substances Heavy crude oil is closely related to natural bitumen from oil sands. Petroleum geologists categorize bitumen from oil sands as ‚Äòextra-heavy oil‚Äô due to its density of less than 10¬∞ ¬∞API. Bitumen is the heaviest, thickest form of petroleum. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, bitumen is further distinguished as extra-heavy oil with a higher viscosity (i.e., resistance to flow): ‚ÄúNatural bitumen, also called tar sands or oil sands, shares the attributes of heavy oil but is yet more dense and viscous. Natural bitumen is oil having a viscosity greater than 10,000 cP.‚Äù ‚ÄúNatural bitumen (often called tar sands or oil sands) and heavy oil differ from light oils by their high viscosity (resistance to flow) at reservoir temperatures, high density (low API gravity), and significant contents of nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur compounds and heavy-metal contaminants. They resemble the residuum from the refining of light oil. Most heavy oil is found at the margins of geologic basins and is thought to be the residue of formerly light oil that has lost its light-molecular-weight components through degradation by bacteria, water-washing, and evaporation. Conventional heavy oil and bitumens differ in the degree by which they have been degraded from the original crude oil by bacteria and erosion. Often, bitumen is more viscous than cold molasses and does not flow at ambient conditions. According to World Resources Institute, concentrations of remarkable quantities of heavy oil and oil sands are found in Canada and Venezuela. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) reported in 2001 that the largest reserves of heavy crude oil in the world were located north of the Orinoco river 270-mile long by 40-mile wide Orinoco Belt in eastern Venezuela. At that time Venezuela began authorizing \\"joint ventures to upgrade the extra-heavy crude resources.\\" Petroleos de Venezuela, S.A. (PDVSA) at that time estimated that there were 270 billion barrels of recoverable reserves in the area, the same amount as the conventional oil reserves of Saudi Arabia. The Orinoco Belt in Venezuela is sometimes described as oil sands, but these deposits are non-bituminous, falling instead into the category of heavy or extra-heavy oil due to their lower viscosity. Natural bitumen and extra-heavy oil differ in the degree by which they have been degraded from the original conventional oils by bacteria. Thirty or more countries are known to have reserves. Production, transportation, and refining of heavy crude oil present special challenges compared to light crude oil. Generally, a diluent is added at regular distances in a pipeline carrying heavy crude to facilitate its flow. Dilbit (diluted bitumen) is a means of transporting highly viscous hydrocarbon. Per the Alberta Oil Sands Bitumen Valuation Methodology, \\"Dilbit Blends\\" means \\"Blends made from heavy crudes and/or bitumens and a diluent usually condensate, for the purpose of meeting pipeline viscosity and density specifications, where the density of the diluent included in the blend is less than 800 kg/m3.\\" Economics Heavy crude oils provide an interesting situation for the economics of petroleum development. The resources of heavy oil in the world are more than twice those of conventional light crude oil. In October 2009, the United States Geological Survey updated the Orinoco deposits (Venezuela) recoverable value to , making this area one of the world's largest recoverable oil deposits. However, recovery rates for heavy oil are often limited from 5-30% of oil in place. The chemical makeup is often the defining variable in recovery rates. New technology utilized for the recovery of heavy oil is constantly increasing recovery rates. On one hand, due to increased refining costs and high sulfur content for some sources, heavy crudes are often priced at a discount to lighter ones. The increased viscosity and density also makes production more difficult (see reservoir engineering). On the other hand, large quantities of heavy crudes have been discovered in the Americas, including Canada, Venezuela and California.

(often less than 3000 feet) can contribute to lower production costs; however, these are offset by the difficulties of production and transport that render conventional production methods ineffective. Specialized techniques are being developed for exploration and production of heavy oil. Extraction Steam is injected into many oil fields where the oil is thicker and heavier than normal crude oil Production of heavy oil is becoming more common in many countries, with 2008 production led by Canada and Venezuela. Methods for extraction include Cold heavy oil production with sand, steam assisted gravity drainage, steam injection, vapor extraction, Toe-to- Heel Air Injection (THAI), and open-pit mining for extremely sandy and oil- rich deposits. Environmental impact With current production and transportation methods, heavy crudes have a more severe environmental impact than light ones. With more difficult production comes the employment of a variety of enhanced oil recovery techniques, including steam flooding and tighter well spacing, often as close as one well per acre. Heavy crude oils also carry contaminants. For example, Orinoco extra heavy oil contains 4.5% sulfur as well as vanadium and nickel. However, because crude oil is refined before use, generating specific alkanes via cracking and fractional distillation, this comparison is not valid in a practical sense. Heavy crude refining techniques may require more energy input though, so its environmental impact is presently more significant than that of lighter crude if the intended final products are light hydrocarbons (gasoline motor fuels). On the other hand, heavy crude is a better source for road asphalt mixes than light crude. With present technology, the extraction and refining of heavy oils and oil sands generates as much as three times the total CO2 emissions compared to conventional oil,J.R. Century. Tar Sands: Key geologic risks and opportunities. The Leading Edge, Vol. 27, No. 9, Pg. 1202-1204. September 2008. primarily driven by the extra energy consumption of the extraction process (which may include burning natural gas to heat and pressurize the reservoir to stimulate flow). Current research into better production methods seek to reduce this environmental impact. In a 2009 report, the National Toxics Network, citing data provided by the Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center of the government of the United States and the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers (CAPP), stated that emissions of CO2 per unit of energy produced were ~84% of those for coal (0.078/0.093) - higher than CO2 emissions of conventional oil. Environmental Research Web has reported that \\"because of the energy needed for extraction and processing, petroleum from Canadian oil tar sands has higher life cycle emission\\" compared with conventional fossil fuels; \\"up to 25% more.\\" Geological origin Most geologists agree that crude becomes ‚Äòheavy‚Äô as a result of biodegradation, in which lighter ends are preferentially consumed by bacterial activity in the reservoir, leaving heavier hydrocarbons behind. This hypothesis leans heavily on the techniques of petroleum geochemistry. Poor geologic reservoir sealing exposes the hydrocarbon to surface contaminants, including organic life (such as bacteria) and contributes to this process. Heavy oils can be found in shallow, young reservoirs, with rocks from the Pleistocene, Pliocene, and Miocene (younger than 25 million years). In some cases, it can also be found in older Cretaceous, Mississippian, and Devonian reservoirs. These reservoirs tend to be poorly sealed, resulting in heavy oil and oil-sands. Chemical properties Heavy oil is asphaltic and contains asphaltenes and resins. It is \\"heavy\\" (dense and viscous) due to the high ratio of aromatics and naphthenes to linear alkanes and high amounts of NSOs (nitrogen, sulfur, oxygen and heavy metals). Heavy oil has a higher percentage of compounds with over 60 carbon atoms and hence a high boiling point and molecular weight. For example, the viscosity of Venezuela's Orinoco extra-heavy crude oil lies in the range 1000-5000 cP (1-5 Pa¬∑s), while Canadian extra-heavy crude has a viscosity in the range 5000-10,000 cP (5-10 Pa¬∑s), about the same as molasses, and higher (up to 100,000 cP or 100 Pa¬∑s for the most viscous commercially exploitable deposits). A definition from the Chevron Phillips Chemical company is as follows: > The \\"heaviness\\" of heavy oil is primarily the result of a relatively high > proportion of a mixed bag of complex, high molecular weight, non-paraffinic > compounds and a low proportion of volatile, low molecular weight compounds. > Heavy oils typically contain very little paraffin and may or may not contain > high levels of asphaltenes.\\"What causes heavy oil if they don't have > asphaltene or paraffin problems?\\" - Chevron Phillips Chemical Heavy crude oil is generally categorized in two ways: # Those that have over 1% sulfur (high sulfur crude oils), with aromatics and asphaltenes. These are mostly found in North America (Canada (Alberta, Saskatchewan), United States (California), Mexico), South America (Venezuela, Colombia and Ecuador) and the Middle East (Kuwait, Saudi Arabia). # Those that have less than 1% sulfur (low sulfur crude oils), with aromatics, naphthenes and resins, and these are mostly found in Western Africa (Chad), Central Africa (Angola) and East Africa (Madagascar).

It was part of the AnsaldoBreda Firema range of vehicles, built specifically as a high- floor, articulated bi-directional tram to operate solely on the Manchester Metrolink system. Twenty-six T-68s were manufactured by AnsaldoBreda at its factory in Naples, Italy. Six modified variants (known as the AnsaldoBreda T-68A) were added in 1999. All 32 were replaced by Bombardier M5000s between 2012 and 2014.

Because low-floor tram technology was in its infancy at the time Metrolink was in its planning stages, and in order to be compatible with standard height railway platforms, used by Metrolink; the vehicles were high-floor, using the same 900mm platform height as British Rail trains. In the beginning, several stops in the city centre (, , and ) had dual height platforms, with one high part and one lower part, because of this, the T-68s were equipped with retractable steps to allow passengers to use the lower section of the platform. The dual height platforms have since been either rebuilt as high level platforms or removed. The T-68s could operate either as single units, or coupled together in pairs. The fleet later received various modifications, including electronic destination displays instead of destination blinds, retractable couplers, covered bogies, internal electronic displays, CCTV in place of mirrors and several other electronic modifications.Manchester Metrolink increases capacity Rail issue 260 30 August 1995 page 18 Fifteen were later fitted with air-conditioning.

However, the newer Bombardier M5000 trams introduced from 2009 proved to be considerably more reliable than the T-68/A fleet; which averaged 5,000 miles between breakdowns, while the M5000 trams at introduction averaged 20,000 miles. The M5000 trams are also 10 tonnes lighter than the T-68/A's, causing less track wear, and using less energy. In addition to this many of the T-68s were found to be suffering from corrosion to their solebars, which would have required further expensive repairs to keep them in service. In July 2012, Transport for Greater Manchester decided that it would be more cost effective to withdraw all of the T-68/T-68As and replace them with M5000s with the first T-68 withdrawn in 2012.Manchester tram fleet renewal starts Rail issue 695 2 May 2012 page 33End of the line for Metrolink's first tram fleet Manchester Evening News 30 April 2014 The final three T68s were withdrawn on 10 February 2014 and the last two T-68As on 30 April 2014.

Biography Blowitz began life as Heinrich Georg Stephan Adolf Opper, called Jind≈ôich in the Czech spelling, in a family of Jewish ancestry at Blowitz (now Blovice) in Bohemia, and left home at the age of fifteen to travel, acquiring a wide range of languages in the process. When financial constraints led him to plan emigration to America, he by chance met M. de Falloux, the French minister responsible for public education, and was appointed as a teacher of foreign languages at the Tours Lyc√©e in around 1849. He thereafter transferred to the Marseilles Lyc√©e. He resigned his job there in 1859 when he got married, in order to devote himself to literature and politics. When, in 1869, Ferdinand de Lesseps ran for election as deputy from Marseilles, Blowitz became involved in a scandal due to supplying information to a Legitimist newspaper. This led to calls for his expulsion from France, which he countered by retiring to the country. The next year, the calls began again, as he began to predict the collapse of the Empire during the Franco-Prussian War; this time, he evaded them by naturalising as a French subject whilst the Battle of Sedan was being fought. Three days after the battle, a Republic was proclaimed. Once naturalised, Blowitz returned to Marseilles, where he worked for Adolphe Thiers. He later worked gathering information for him at Versailles, and as a result Thiers offered him the French consulship at Riga. Shortly before he was to accept this, Blowitz became the assistant to Laurence Oliphant, the Paris correspondent of The Times, whilst the second correspondent was absent. When the second correspondent, Frederick Hardman, succeeded Oliphant, Blowitz remained as assistant, and when Hardman died in 1873 he himself became chief Paris correspondent. In this role Blowitz became famous, both as a journalist and for his insights into diplomacy. In 1875, the duc de Decazes, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, informed him of a confidential despatch from the French ambassador to Berlin, discussing German plans to attack France, and requested Blowitz publish an expos√©; he did so, provoking a storm of public opinion, and effectively preventing any chance of the German intention being carried out. In 1877 and 1888 he successfully exposed internal conspiracies against the Republic. Blowitz's most famous achievement was in 1878, when he managed to obtain the text of the Treaty of Berlin and publish it at the very moment that the Congress of Berlin was finally signing it. The same year he was made an Officier of the L√©gion d'honneur.Minist√®re de la culture ‚Äì Base L√©onore. Culture.gouv.fr. Retrieved on 2014-06-14. Blowitz finally retired from his work for The Times in 1902, to be replaced by the newspaper‚Äôs Vienna correspondent, William Lavino.American national biography, Volume 10 (1998), p. 186 He died a few months later, in January 1903. In fiction Blowitz appears as a character in the novella \\"The Road to Charing Cross\\" in Flashman and the Tiger (1999) by George MacDonald Fraser. He also appears as a character in the video game 80 Days.

It features a dual combustion chamber, dual-nozzle design and is fueled by a RP-1/LOX mixture. Currently, RD-180 engines are used for the first stage of the American Atlas V launch vehicle. The RD-180 is derived from the RD-170/RD-171 line of rocket engines, which were used in the Soviet Energia launch vehicle and are still in use in the Ukrainian Zenit launch vehicles. History The roots of the RD-180 rocket engine extend back into the Soviet Energia launch vehicle project. The RD-170, a four-chamber engine, was developed for use on the strap-on boosters for this vehicle, which ultimately was used to lift the Buran orbiter. This engine was scaled down to a two-chamber version by combining the RD-170's combustion devices with half-size turbomachinery. After successful performances in engine tests on a test stand and high-level agreements between the US government and the Russian government, the engines were imported to the US for use on the Lockheed Martin Atlas III, with first flight in 2000. The engine is also used on the United Launch Alliance Atlas V, the successor to the Atlas III. The engine has similar design features to the NK-33, which was developed by a different bureau (Kuznetzov) nearly a decade earlier. =2014‚Äì2015 availability concerns= Doubts about the reliability of the supply chain for the RD-180 arose following the Russian military intervention in Ukraine in March 2014. For over 13 years since the engine was first used in the Atlas III launch vehicle in 2000, there was never any serious jeopardy to the engine supply, despite an uneven record of US‚ÄìRussian relations since the Cold War. But worsening relations between the West and Russia after March 2014 have led to several blockages, including a short-lived judicial injunction from the US courts that were unclear on the scope of the US sanctions on importing the Russian engine. On 13 May 2014, Russian Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin announced that \\"Russia will ban the United States from using Russian-made rocket engines for military launches\\"‚Äîa frequent payload of the ULA Atlas V launch vehicle, which powers its first stage with a single RD-180 engine that is expended after each flight. In response, the US Air Force has asked the Aerospace Corporation to begin evaluating alternatives for powering the Atlas 5 booster stage with non-RD-180 engines. Early estimates are that it would require five or more years to replace the RD-180 on the Atlas V. Even if the Russian government does not cut off the supply to ULA of imported RD-180 engines, the US Congress, with emerging support from the Air Force, has come around to a view that it would not be advantageous to the US government to start up a US production line to produce the RD-180. However, the US Congress is advocating for the initiation of a new US hydrocarbon rocket engine program, to field a new engine by 2022. In June 2014, Aerojet Rocketdyne proposed that the US Federal government \\"fund an all-new, U.S.-sourced rocket propulsion system\\", the thrust kerosene/LOX AR-1 rocket engine. , Aerojet's early projection was that the cost of each engine would be under per pair of engines‚Äînot including the up to estimated development cost to be funded by the US Government. Aerojet believed that the AR-1 could replace the RD-180 in the US Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle fleet, and that it would be more affordable. On 21 August 2014, the U.S. Air Force released an official request for information (RFI) for a replacement for the RD-180. The RFI seeks information on \\"booster propulsion and/or launch system material options that could deliver cost-effective, commercially-viable solutions for current and future National Security Space (NSS) launch requirements. Air Force Space Command (AFSPC) is considering an acquisition strategy to stimulate the commercial development of booster propulsion systems and/or launch systems for Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV)-class spacelift applications.\\" The day before, the United Launch Alliance had taken delivery of two RD-180s, the first since the Russian annexation of Crimea. It is not clear when the replacement of the RD-180 would start, and the RFI asked input for several options including similarity to the Russian engine, whether it would come in a new configuration and the use of \\"alternative launch vehicles\\" for the EELV mission.http://www.airforcetimes.com/article/20140821/NEWS04/308210050/Air- Force-issues-RFI-new-rocket-engine-replace-Russian-made-model In 2014, RD- Amross were selling the RD-180s (to ULA) for $23.4m each.Reuters In Pentagon deal with Russians, big profit for tiny Florida firm nov 2014. In January 2015, Orbital Sciences Corporation have received all the necessary permissions from government bodies for the delivery of 60 engines from NPO Energomash. On 24 December 2015, United Launch Alliance announced that it placed an order for more RD-180 engines to be used by the Atlas V launch vehicle, in addition to 29 engines that the company had ordered before US sanctions against Russia were introduced over Crimea, and just days after the US Congress lifted the ban on the use of Russian engines to get American ships into space. = US production of the RD-180 = United Launch Alliance (ULA) announced in February 2015 that it was considering undertaking US production of the Russian RD-180 engine at the Decatur, Alabama, rocket stage manufacturing facility. The US-manufactured engines would be used only for government civil (NASA) and commercial launches, and would not be used for US military launches. This potential project is a backup plan to the new engine development work that ULA is undertaking with Blue Origin on the BE-4. = Replacement for the RD-180 engine on US Atlas launch vehicle = As a result of the geopolitical and US political considerations as 2014 progressed, United Launch Alliance initiated an effort to consider the possible replacement of the Russian-supplied RD-180 engine used on the first-stage booster of the ULA Atlas V. Formal study contracts were issued in June 2014 to a number of US rocket-engine suppliers. In September 2014, ULA announced that it has entered into a partnership with Blue Origin to develop the BE-4 LOX/methane engine to replace the RD-180 on a new first-stage booster that would succeed the Atlas V. At the time, the engine was already in its third year of development by Blue Origin, and ULA expected the new stage and engine to start flying no earlier than 2019. Two of the -thrust BE-4 engines will be used on the new launch vehicle booster. Dynetics and Aerojet Rocketdyne (AJR) have also offered their AR1 hydrocarbon- fueled rocket engine as replacement of the RD-180.http://aviationweek.com/defense/aerojet-rocketdyne-targets-25-million- pair-ar-1-engines ULA CEO Tory Bruno has said in early 2015 that both the AR-1 option and the US manufacture of the RD-180 by ULA under license are backup options to the primary option ULA is pursuing with the Blue Origin BE-4 engine. By March 2016, the US Air Force had signed development contracts with AJR and Blue Origin to provide funding toward engine development for both engines.http://spaceflightnow.com/2016/03/07/ulas-candidates-to-replace- rd-180-engine-win-air-force-funding/ , no replacement is expected to fly before 2021. , Alan Boyle, 10 October 2018. Design and specifications thumbnailSchematic of the RD-180 engine The combustion chambers of the RD-180 share a single turbopump unit, much like in its predecessor, the four- chambered RD-170. The RD-180 is fueled by an RP-1/LOX mixture and uses an extremely efficient, high-pressure staged combustion cycle. The engine runs with an oxidizer-to-fuel ratio of 2.72 and employs an oxygen-rich preburner, unlike typical fuel-rich US designs. The thermodynamics of the cycle allow an oxygen-rich preburner to give a greater power-to-weight ratio, but with the drawback that high-pressure, high-temperature gaseous oxygen must be transported throughout the engine. The movements of the engine nozzles are controlled by four hydraulic actuators. The engine can be throttled from 47% to 100% of nominal thrust. Applications During the early 1990s, General Dynamics Space Systems Division (later purchased by Lockheed Martin) acquired the rights to use the RD-180 in the Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV) and the Atlas program. As these programs were conceived to support United States Government launches, as well as commercial launches, it was also arranged for the RD-180 to be co-produced by Pratt & Whitney. However, all production to date has taken place in Russia. The engine is currently sold by a joint venture between the Russian developer and producer of the engine NPO Energomash and Pratt & Whitney, called RD Amross. The RD-180 was first deployed on the Atlas IIA-R vehicle, which was the Atlas IIA vehicle with the Russian (hence the R) engine replacing the previous main engine. This vehicle was later renamed the Atlas III. An additional development program was undertaken to certify the engine for use on the modular Common Core Booster primary stage of the Atlas V rocket. =Prospective uses= RD-180 was proposed to be usedhttp://survincity.com/2013/08/roscosmos-designing-a-new- space-rocket-complex-rus/ with a new family of Rus-M Russian space launch vehicles, proposed by Roskosmos contractors, but the program was canceled by the Russian Space Agency in October 2011. In March 2010, Jerry Grey, a consultant to the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics and Universities Space Research Association and a former professor of aerospace engineering at Princeton University, suggested using the RD-180 for a prospective NASA heavy-lift launch vehicle. For those who might be concerned about too much reliance on Russia, he pointed out that RD Amross was \\"very close to producing a U.S.-built version of the RD-180, and with some infusion of NASA funding could be manufacturing that engine (and perhaps even a thrust equivalent of the RD-170) in a few years\\". =Prospective alternative= In February 2010, despite the availability of necessary documentation and legal rights for producing RD-180 in the United States, NASA is considering development of an indigenous core-stage engine that would be \\"capable of generating high levels of thrust approximately equal to or exceeding the performance of the Russian-built engine\\". NASA considered in 2010 to produce a fully operational engine by 2020 or sooner, depending on partnership with the U.S. Defense Department.

It is the oldest existing sports club in Sweden and claims to be the oldest swimming club in the world. The society was founded by the mathematician and astronomer J√∂ns Svanberg (1771‚Äì1851) together with some colleagues at the university as a way to remedy the general lack of swimming skills. The same year the society was founded, Svanberg arranged a mock \\"graduation ceremony\\" (promotion), modelled after the academic ceremony, where he and some of his colleagues awarded themselves the master's degree (magister) and their pupils the degree of bachelor (kandidat) in swimming. The simpromotion and these \\"degrees\\" were taken over by other Swedish swimming clubs and are still used in Swedish swimming schools. After Svanberg had temporarily left Uppsala for Stockholm, Gabriel Marklin, otherwise remembered as an eccentric scientific collector, briefly took care of the swimming school, to be succeeded for a few years by Carl Gustaf Grahl, the first professional swimming instructor in Sweden. By that time, Svanberg had returned to Uppsala as professor of mathematics. In the middle of the 19th century, a bath house was built and later a springboard for diving. The Isander dive (or half gainer), one of the most common dives in springboard diving, was named after Lars Fredrik Isander (1828‚Äì1893), active in the Society and later lecturer at the Gymnasium in Link√∂ping, and the Mollberg dive (full gainer) was named after Anders Fredrik Mollberg, swimming instructor for the society (1878‚Äì1879), who supposedly invented it by accident when he was actually intending to do an Isander dive. It actually appears to be considerably older and is described already in Underr√§ttelser i simkonsten, a Swedish instruction book in swimming from 1839. Anecdotes describe Mollberg's extraordinary gymnastic ability and how he once made two consecutive \\"Mollberg\\" dives while slightly tipsy, leaving spectators wondering how he came out of the water alive. Although the original intent for the Society was elementary swimming instruction, it entered competitive swimming in 1910 and is one of the most successful swimming clubs in Sweden.

The term was occasionally applied to an abortive human fetus. The term derives from the once widespread superstition, present in many European folk traditions, that such malformed creatures were the product of the sinister influence of the Moon on fetal development. The earliest recorded use of the term was in 1565, referring to a human false pregnancy. Modern usage The term came to also refer to any monstrous or grotesque thing. Shakespeare, for instance, used the term to describe Caliban, the deformed servant of Prospero, in The Tempest. In H. G. Wells' 1901 novel The First Men in the Moon, large creatures domesticated by the Selenites are referred to as \\"mooncalves.\\" Mooncalf is used as a derogatory term indicating someone is a dullard, fool or otherwise not particularly bright or sharp. For example, W. C. Fields in The Bank Dick (1940) advises his prospective son-in-law to avoid being a \\"mooncalf\\" by buying shares he has been conned into believing are worth much more than the proffered price. Mooncalf is also the name of a species of magical creatures in the world of the Harry Potter series. It is described in Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them as a shy, nocturnal creature with a smooth, pale grey body, bulging eyes and four spindly legs with large flat feet. Mooncalves perform dances in the moonlight, and are apparently responsible for crop circles. In the film of the same name and its sequel, Newt Scamander's collection of creatures in his suitcase includes a herd of Mooncalves. Wilfred Maxwell, narrator and protagonist of occultist Dion Fortune‚Äôs 1938 novel, The Sea Priestess, refers several times to a mentally disabled character who falls into the sea and disappears as a \\"mooncalf\\".

It was developed for microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), which require these features, but is also used to excavate trenches for high-density capacitors for DRAM and more recently for creating through silicon vias (TSVs) in advanced 3D wafer level packaging technology. There are two main technologies for high-rate DRIE: cryogenic and Bosch, although the Bosch process is the only recognised production technique. Both Bosch and cryo processes can fabricate 90¬∞ (truly vertical) walls, but often the walls are slightly tapered, e.g. 88¬∞ (\\"reentrant\\") or 92¬∞ (\\"retrograde\\"). Another mechanism is sidewall passivation: SiOxFy functional groups (which originate from sulphur hexafluoride and oxygen etch gases) condense on the sidewalls, and protect them from lateral etching. As a combination of these processes deep vertical structures can be made. Cryogenic process In cryogenic-DRIE, the wafer is chilled to ‚àí110 ¬∞C (163 K). The low temperature slows down the chemical reaction that produces isotropic etching. However, ions continue to bombard upward-facing surfaces and etch them away. This process produces trenches with highly vertical sidewalls. The primary issues with cryo-DRIE is that the standard masks on substrates crack under the extreme cold, plus etch by-products have a tendency of depositing on the nearest cold surface, i.e. the substrate or electrode. Bosch process A silicon micro-pillar fabricated using the Bosch process The Bosch process, named after the German company Robert Bosch GmbH which patented the process,Basic Bosch process patent applicationImproved Bosch process patent applicationBosch process \\"Parameter Ramping\\" patent application also known as pulsed or time-multiplexed etching, alternates repeatedly between two modes to achieve nearly vertical structures: # A standard, nearly isotropic plasma etch. The plasma contains some ions, which attack the wafer from a nearly vertical direction. Sulfur hexafluoride [SF6] is often used for silicon. # Deposition of a chemically inert passivation layer. (For instance, Octafluorocyclobutane [C4F8] source gas yields a substance similar to Teflon.) Undulating sidewall of a silicon structure created using the Bosch process Each phase lasts for several seconds. The passivation layer protects the entire substrate from further chemical attack and prevents further etching. However, during the etching phase, the directional ions that bombard the substrate attack the passivation layer at the bottom of the trench (but not along the sides). They collide with it and sputter it off, exposing the substrate to the chemical etchant. These etch/deposit steps are repeated many times over resulting in a large number of very small isotropic etch steps taking place only at the bottom of the etched pits. To etch through a 0.5 mm silicon wafer, for example, 100‚Äì1000 etch/deposit steps are needed. The two- phase process causes the sidewalls to undulate with an amplitude of about 100‚Äì500 nm. The cycle time can be adjusted: short cycles yield smoother walls, and long cycles yield a higher etch rate. Applications RIE \\"deepness\\" depends on application: * in DRAM memory circuits, capacitor trenches may be 10‚Äì20 ¬µm deep, * in MEMS, DRIE is used for anything from a few micrometers to 0.5 mm. * in irregular chip dicing, DRIE is used with a novel hybrid soft/hard mask to achieve sub-millimeter etching to dice silicon dies into lego-like pieces with irregular shapes. * in flexible electronics, DRIE is used to make traditional monolithic CMOS devices flexible by reducing the thickness of silicon substrates to few to tens of micrometers. What distinguishes DRIE from RIE is etch depth: Practical etch depths for RIE (as used in IC manufacturing) would be limited to around 10 ¬µm at a rate up to 1 ¬µm/min, while DRIE can etch features much greater, up to 600 ¬µm or more with rates up to 20 ¬µm/min or more in some applications. DRIE of glass requires high plasma power, which makes it difficult to find suitable mask materials for truly deep etching. Polysilicon and nickel are used for 10‚Äì50 ¬µm etched depths. In DRIE of polymers, Bosch process with alternating steps of SF6 etching and C4F8 passivation take place. Metal masks can be used, however they are expensive to use since several additional photo and deposition steps are always required. Metal masks are not necessary however on various substrates (Si [up to 800 ¬µm], InP [up to 40 ¬µm] or glass [up to 12 ¬µm]) if using chemically amplified negative resists. Gallium ion implantion can be used as etch mask in cryo-DRIE. Combined nanofabrication process of focused ion beam and cryo-DRIE was first reported by N Chekurov et al in their article \\"The fabrication of silicon nanostructures by local gallium implantation and cryogenic deep reactive ion etching\\". =Precision Machinery= DRIE has enabled the use of silicon mechanical components in high-end wristwatches. According to an engineer at Cartier, ‚ÄúThere is no limit to geometric shapes with DRIE,‚Äù. With DRIE it is possible to obtain an aspect ratio of 30 or more, meaning that a surface can be etched with a vertical-walled trench 30 times deeper than its width. This has allowed for silicon components to be substituted for some parts which are usually made of steel, such as the hairspring. Silicon is lighter and harder than steel, which carries benefits but makes the manufacturing process more challenging.

It is the registered trade mark of British Polythene Limited in numerous countries throughout the world. It is commonly between 4 and 10 mils (0.004 to 0.01 in./0.1 to 0.25 mm) thick and is available in clear, opaque, blue, and black. Visqueen is used for many purposes. It is commonly used as a temporary tarpaulin, as a drop cloth when painting, to cover concrete as it sets, to line decorative ponds, and to cover the ground before applying stone or wood chips to prevent weed growth. Large (100 √ó 20 ft) sheets of Visqueen are used during floods to protect levees from wave wash erosion. It is often suggested for use in greenhouses. Visqueen is used as a condensation barrier inside walls when installing HVAC systems. It is also used as a ground cover in the crawl space of home foundations as a vapor barrier. The use of Visqueen underneath a basement is to prevent water infiltration from water present in the ground that would pass through the concrete or dirt floor and bring in unwanted dampness.  History  Visqueen was first produced circa 1950 by the Visking Corporation, a company founded in the 1920s by Erwin O. Freund for the purpose of making casings for meat products. Visking investigated the post- World War II emerging technology of polyethylene, and developed manufacturing techniques to make pure virgin polyethylene film. Originally spelled VisQueen, the film was an excellent moisture barrier and was marketed to many industrial, architectural, and consumer applications, such as moisture barriers, plant seedbed protection films, building fumigation barriers, drop cloths, case liners, and tarpaulins. At a time when Visking was the largest producer of polyethylene film in the U.S., Union Carbide acquired Visking in 1956. An antitrust ruling forced the sale of the polyethylene business of Visking to Ethyl Corporation in 1963. Ethyl, known best for its tetra ethyl lead gasoline additive, renamed the division VisQueen. In 1989, Ethyl Corporation, desiring to concentrate on chemical manufacture, spun off VisQueen as a new company, Tredegar Film Products Corporation.

Another theory suggests McCunn as a variant of 'McKeown', which comes from the Celtic 'Mac Eoin' ('Eoin' being the Irish form of John). Family history The first recorded bearer of the name was Gilcrist McKwnne, circa 1370, in the Calendar of the Laing Charters during the reign of King David II of Scotland. The surname was introduced to Ulster by Scottish settlers during the plantation of the province and later many McCunns emigrated during the Great Famine of Ireland. Since then, the McCunn family has spread throughout the world particularly to North America.

Each quarter, Coface publishes its assessments of country risk for 160 countries, based on its knowledge of companies‚Äô payment behaviour and on the expertise of its underwriters. History Coface was founded in 1946 as the French specialist export credit insurance company. During the 1990s, Coface developed internationally through internal and external growth, by acquiring credit insurance companies and by creating new subsidiaries or branches. External acquisitions included La Viscontea in 1992 (Italian safety and credit insurance company), London Bridge Finance in 1993 (UK financial company providing credit insurance services), Allgemeine Kredit in 1996 (German company providing domestic and export credit insurance options) and Osterreichische Kreditversicherung in 1997 (Austrian credit insurer) along with the acquisition of the Continental portfolio in the USA in 2002.

Coface services also include collection agency services, factoring and business information to prevent non-payment risk, as well as bonds (market, environmental, fiscal etc.). = Credit insurance process = A company dispatches a major order to a new client in a developing market. If the client fails to pay within the agreed timeframe, the company risks insolvency or even bankruptcy. Credit insurance helps companies avoid that risk. The credit insurer assesses the financial health of companies' clients, based on a real-time analysis of country, sector and credit risks, and provides information which enables transactions to be carried out more securely. The credit insurer alerts companies of any changes in the financial situation of their clients. If a risk is established, the credit insurer collects debts in their name and guarantees the payment of trade receivables. In providing that guarantee, credit insurance also enables improved credit and loan conditions from banks.  Country Risk Assessments  Coface's country risk analysis enables companies to assess the risk of a business defaulting in a given country, and to evaluate the overall quality of the business environment in the country to which it wishes to export goods or services. Coface assigns a rating to each of the 162 countries it monitors. This rating reflects the average risk of short-term non-payment for companies in this country. Eight ranks are used: * A1: very low risk * A2: low risk * A3: quite acceptable risk * A4: acceptable risk * B: significant risk * C: high risk * D: very high risk * E: extreme risk Coface publishes its country risks assessments on a quarterly basis.COUNTRY RISK ASSESSMENT MAP - JANUARY 2017 - 4TH QUARTER 2016, 24 January 2017  Head Office  Coface's head office is located in Bois-Colombes in the western suburbs of Paris, close to the business center La D√©fense.

She exhibited five miniatures at the Royal Academy in 1807, and founded the Bristol Fine Arts Academy in 1844 with a substantial gift. Biography Ellen Wallace was born in Bath or Birmingham into a Quaker family. She studied drawing with James Sharples in Bath, her only known art training, and married him in 1787. The couple had two children, both of whom were also painters: James Sharples, Jr. (b. 1788) and Rolinda Sharples (b. 1793). James, who had been widowed twice before, had two sons from his previous marriages, George, with his first wife, and Felix (b. 1786 and also an artist) with his second wife. =America, 1794-1801= George Washington, 1796-1797, Ellen Sharples The couple emigrated to the United States around 1794 in a harrowing voyage, in which their ship was commandeered by a French privateer. The family was interned at Brest for seven months, and Ellen would later write of the ordeal in her diary: \\"Our family have experienced; severely experienced much of its misery, and much did we witness during our seven months captivity in France, too heart rending to recall.\\" They eventually made it to America in a move that echoed the fashion of English artists who took advantage of the growing demand for portraiture in the New World.Waggoner, p. 6 Living in Washington, DC James had great success painting portraits of American leaders (including George Washington). Around 1797, while they were living in Philadelphia, Ellen first began to draw portraits professionally in order to supplement the family‚Äôs income. Responding to the great demand for affordable copies, Ellen's career thrived in copying her husband's original portraits on commission, and her miniature copies were priced the same as her husband's. Small portraits, such as the Sharples turned out, were a viable and affordable alternative to the large scale formal portraits of Gilbert Stuart and John Trumbull.Metz p. 3 Competition from other small portrait painters was stiff, and in looking for opportunities for commissions, the family became itinerant. They lived and worked in Philadelphia and New York City, and traveled through New England in a specially constructed carriage that carried the family, their collection, and their equipment.Metz, p. 3 When they very still young, the Sharples children began to draw, and Ellen began to personally train her daughter, Rolinda, in the art of painting and drawing. The children joined the family enterprise when they were still in their teens, Felix at the age of 17, James Jr. at the age of 15, and Rolinda at the age of 13. =Return to England, 1801-1809= In 1801, the family returned to Bath because of their fears of the Franco-American war. Much of the information that is known about the family during this period comes from Ellen Sharples' diaries and letters, and in 1803, Ellen wrote about her daughter: > Drawing, reading and instructing my dear Rolinda continues greatly to > interest me, as they have done for many years....Mr. S. delights to instruct > her in arithmetic and natural philosophy...I attend to her reading, writing, > drawing, geography, French, etc. During this interim period, Ellen also exhibited her miniatures at the Royal Academy of Arts. =America, 1809-1811= In 1806, the family had plans to return to America, but their ship was damaged in a storm and they had to return to port. Felix and James Jr. were given permission to return at this time, and James, Ellen, and Rolinda joined them three years later. During their second stay in America, they lived in New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania, continuing their portrait commissions. James Sharples became ill in 1810, and in the winter of 1811, he died. After settling the will, Ellen, Rolinda, and James Jr. returned to England, and Felix elected to remain in America, pursuing a career as a portrait artist.Metz, p. 4 =Bristol, England, 1811-1849= An 1816 chalk drawing of Charles Darwin at age six with his sister Catherine, by Ellen Sharples Ellen's itinerant life was over after her husband's death, and she settled permanently in Clifton, where she, James Jr. and Rolinda rented an apartment. The three members of the family concentrated on establishing a portrait practice. Rolinda's career took on a different and more ambitious direction, for she began to paint large portraits and complicated group scenes in oils. James, Jr., who lived a more independent life from his mother and sister, continued to paint portraits. Ellen's diary references to Felix end in 1823, and she made no mention that her children ever married. The family was successful, but both her children predeceased her. Rolinda died of breast cancer in 1838, and James Jr. died of tuberculosis in 1839. Of her loss, Ellen wrote to her friend, Miss Sarjeant: > that in my recent losses, my feelings must have been agonizing; for you knew > how uniformly exemplary were the affectionate kindness of my dear highly > gifted son & daughter to their mother, how devoted she was, placing all her > happiness in them....Waggoner, p. 23 She was near 72 years of age when she wrote those words. When Ellen died in 1849 she left a substantial estate of ¬£4,000 to the Bristol Academy for the Promotion of Fine Arts which was instrumental in financing Bristol's first art gallery, now the Royal West of England Academy. She had helped found the Academy several years earlier with a gift of ¬£2,000.Waggoner, p. 25 Personal papers Letters, legal papers, bank and account books relating to James and Ellen Sharples and their family are held at Bristol Archives (Ref. 15395) (online catalogue). A number of paintings by Ellen and Rolinda Sharples can be seen on display at Bristol City Museum and Art Gallery and M Shed museum. Paintings Joseph Priestley, 1794, Ellen Sharples Ellen Sharples began her artistic career making copies of her husband's pastel portraits. Between 1794-1810, her copies followed a similar format of 9\\"x 7\\" portraits on gray or tanned paper. She taught herself how to make miniature watercolor copies on ivory, and between 1803-1810 she made miniature portraits either from copies or from life.Mtz p. 4 The income from Ellen's and her children's paintings made the family affluent, and she wrote in her diary: > Copies were frequently required; these I undertook, and was far successful, > as to have as many commissions as I could execute; they were thought equal > to the original, price the same: we lived in good style associating in the > first society. Self-portrait of Rolinda Sharples with her mother Ellen Sharples, 1816 After 1810, Ellen no longer mentions her own work in her diaries, yet the family continued to practice as portrait painters in Bristol. Ellen's subjects included Joseph Priestley, Martha and George Washington, Benjamin Rush, John and Mrs. Bard, Eleanor Parke Custis, Alexander Hamilton, Sir Joseph Banks, and the Marquis de Lafayette. Today, her works can be found in many museums in the United States, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the National Gallery of Art, and the Independence National Historical Park Collection. She died in Wybunbury, Cheshire. Ellen's daughter Rolinda Sharples became an oil painter of some renown. One of her largest pieces of work was The Trial of Colonel Brereton, painted in 1834, which is on display at M Shed in Bristol.

She competed in her first Romanian national championships in 1998, winning the floor exercise event in the junior division. The following year, she was invited to join the Romanian national team, and began working with coaches Octavian Belu and Mariana Bitang at the elite training facility in Deva.

At the 2002 World Championships in Debrecen, Ban won a silver medal on the balance beam, one of Romania's only victories of the competition, and placed fourth on the floor finals.Gymn Forum Results 2002 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships Later that year she placed second all around at the Chunichi Cup (behind teammate Oana Petrovschi)Gymn Forum Results 2002 Chunichi Cup and won the Massilia Cup.Gymn Forum Results 2002 Massilia Gym Cup In 2003, Ban had a similarly strong showing, contributing to the Romanian team's silver medal at the 2003 World Championships and placing sixth in the all-around final.Gymn Forum Results 2003 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships Women TeamGymn Forum Results 2003 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships Women All Around That year she successfully competed in several international competitions, winning the all around silver medal at the Gander Memorial behind CƒÉtƒÉlina PonorGymn Forum Results 2003 Gander Memorial and the all around bronze medal at the 2003 Chunichi cup behind Andreea Munteanu and Svetlana Khorkina.Gymn Forum Results 2003 Chunichi Cup She also won silver on beam at the 2003 Cottbus CupGymn Forum Results 2003 Cottbus Cup and the 2003 DTB CupGymn Forum Results 2003 DTP Cup and won the Swiss cup together with Marian DrƒÉgulescu.Gymn Forum Results 2003 Swiss Cup =Athens 2004= Oana's career highlight came at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, where she, along with teammates Monica Ro»ôu, Alexandra Eremia, CƒÉtƒÉlina Ponor, Daniela »òofronie and Silvia Stroescu, won the gold medal in the team competition. Ban contributed heavily to the Romanian victory, competing on uneven bars, balance beam, and floor in the team finals.Gymn Forum Results 2004 Athens Olympic Games Women Team Finals Individually, she qualified for both the all-around and the floor exercise final. She also placed fifth in the qualifications for the balance beam final but she could not compete due to the two per country rule. Unfortunately, an injury sustained on her last event in the team competition forced her to sit out both competitions and essentially ended her Olympic experience. For Ban, the situation was unfortunate: she had qualified to the all-around in an impressive third place; her qualifying floor score would have been good enough for second place. She was replaced in the floor final by Daniela ≈ûofronie who won the silver medal.Sports Reference Daniela ≈ûofronie Post retirement Ban retired from gymnastics after the Olympics; she is currently a coach in her hometown of Cluj-Napoca, Romania. She participated in the 4th televised competition of Kunoichi in Japan. She made it past the First Stage of the competition, but failed on the Floating Bridge of Stage 2. Skills During her career, Ban specialized on floor exercise and beam. Her favorite event was floor; she was renowned for her difficult tumbling and fast-paced, playful, crowd-pleasing choreography. As many of her Romanian teammates, her weakness was the uneven bars. In spite of her powerful tumbling skills and strength, Ban was not an especially strong vaulter. Nonetheless, she was able to perform as an all-around gymnast for the Romanian team, and posted scores that frequently placed her in the top ten at major competitions. She qualified in third place for the Olympic all-around in Athens and would have been a medal contender had injury not prevented it.

() (born September 3, 1974) is an American comics artist and social media personality. He is known for illustrating or drawing covers for a number of superhero titles in the 2000s, primarily for DC Comics, including Green Lantern and The Flash: Rebirth, and New X-Men for Marvel Comics. In the late 2010s he became known for his \\"ComicArtistPro Secrets\\" channel on YouTube, through which he became a central figure in Comicsgate. Early life Ethan Van Sciver was born September 3, 1974 in Utah. He and his younger brother, alternative cartoonist Noah Van Sciver, grew up in southern New Jersey. Van Sciver decided on a career in the comic-book field after seeing the 1978 movie Superman as a child, but only began to read comics intently with John Byrne's The Man of Steel in 1986. He cites Chris Claremont and Jon Bogdanove's Fantastic Four vs. the X-Men (1987) as a strong influence. Career While in high school, Van Sciver did various art-related jobs, which included painting murals of Native Americans, drawing caricatures for mall customers, illustrating children's books, and airbrushing t-shirts. Van Sciver's first comics work was published in 1994, writing and drawing what he later called \\"a horrible little character called Cyberfrog\\", published by Hall of Heroes and later Harris Comics. = Mainstream publishers = His first work for DC Comics was in 1998, which led to him being hired in 1999 as the artist on the series Impulse, with writer Todd Dezago. This was followed in 2001 by the first of what would become several collaborations with writer Geoff Johns, on the superhero-horror one-shot The Flash: Iron Heights. Ethan Van Sciver drawing at Comicon fest, Athens, 2008 Van Sciver was hired by Marvel Comics in 2001 to work on New X-Men, a retitled and revamped series (beginning with #114) written by Grant Morrison. The series' primary artist Frank Quitely was not expected to illustrate the necessary twelve issues per year, so Van Sciver was scheduled to illustrate two issues per year, which expanded to more issues as Igor Kordey was also hired as a semi-regular artist. Van Sciver drew a total of four issues. In issue #133 of this series, Morrison and Van Sciver co-created the character Dust, a Sunni Muslim mutant who can transform into sand. Returning to work primarily for DC, Van Sciver worked with Johns on the six-issue miniseries Green Lantern: Rebirth (2004) which restored the Silver Age character Hal Jordan as the publisher's primary Green Lantern. They then worked together on an ongoing series featuring the character. During this time Van Sciver was one of the artists who contributed to a series of instructional books for amateur comics artists, published by Wizard magazine. In 2006, Van Sciver penciled the cover art for metal band Winger's fourth studio album. The cover art was also sold as a poster called \\"Guardian of Freedom\\". Johns, Van Sciver, Dave Gibbons, Ivan Reis, and others produced \\"Sinestro Corps War\\", a high-profile 11-issue story appearing in DC's two Green Lantern monthly series in 2007.Cowsill \\"2000s\\" in Dolan, p. 330 Van Sciver and Johns produced the six-issue mini-series The Flash: Rebirth (2009) which ‚Äì like the earlier Green Lantern mini-series ‚Äì reintroduced the Silver Age character Barry Allen as the Flash.Cowsill \\"2000s\\" in Dolan, p. 337: \\"Writer Geoff Johns and artist Ethan Van Sciver...joined forces again to relaunch Barry Allen as the Flash.\\" The same year, he drew variant covers for DC's crossover storyline Blackest Night. In 2011, as part of DC's \\"New 52\\" initiative, he was the artist ‚Äì and co-writer with Gail Simone ‚Äì of The Fury of Firestorm: The Nuclear Men. Starting in 2016, as part of the \\"DC Rebirth\\" relaunch of DC's titles, Van Sciver drew issues of the Hal Jordan and the Green Lantern Corps series. = Social media, independent publishing = In 2017, he penciled illustrations for 12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos, a self-help book by Canadian psychologist and social activist Jordan Peterson. That year he also began a YouTube channel called ComicArtistPro Secrets, which originally featured demonstrations of illustration tools and techniques, but has since focused on commentary about comics, other comics creators, and fan culture. Through it, Van Sciver became a central figure in Comicsgate, a movement which objects to certain \\"political\\" themes in current mainstream superhero comics, but which has been criticized as a harassment campaign against those who produce them. Van Sciver has also been a prominent figure in the Fandom Menace, a Star Wars fan movement with similar goals and methods to Comicsgate. No longer employed by DC, in 2018 Van Sciver announced that he would instead produce his own comics, and in 2019 he published Cyberfrog: Bloodhoney featuring his early character Cyberfrog, for which he had raised over $500,000 through crowdfunding. A campaign in 2020 raised over $1 million for a follow-up Cyberfrog: Rekt Planet, promised to ship in 2021. Awards and recognition *Inkwell Awards Ambassador (2010‚Äì2018) *2008 Will Eisner Comic Industry Awards ‚Äì nominee for Best Penciller/Inker for Green Lantern: Sinestro Corps Personal life As of August 2005, Van Sciver resided in Orlando, Florida.

It is named as a part of East Main Street. The structure was built as a part of the Welland By-Pass project. Its construction was relatively easy since, like the Townline Tunnel, it was constructed at the same time as the channel above it and a simple cut and cover. The tunnel was officially opened on May 20, 1972.  Description  The tunnel links Highway 406 on the west side of the canal, which travels north to St. Catharines to Highway 140 on the east side, which travels south to Port Colborne. Niagara Regional Road 27 also provides a connection from Welland eastward to Niagara Falls. The tunnel provides four lanes for traffic, two in each direction, separated by a full-height concrete wall. There is also a sidewalk for pedestrian use in the westbound section.  History  The Main Street Tunnel, like the nearby Townline Tunnel to the south, was constructed in the early 1970s as part of the Welland Bypass of the Welland Canal. It was built using a cut and cover technique, whereby the tunnel was excavated, the concrete poured, and the structure buried, on top of which the canal channel was built. This avoided costly boring beneath an active waterway; the structure cost C$11 million. This price was split 50‚Äì50 between Transport Canada and the St. Lawrence Seaway Authority. The tunnel opened with a parade featuring the Welland Police pipe band and various officials on the morning of May 20, 1972.Tunnel Opening  References   External links  *Newspaper clippings about the tunnel's construction Category:Buildings and structures in Welland Category:Transport in Welland Category:Welland Canal Category:Tunnels in Ontario Category:Tunnels completed in 1972 Category:Road tunnels in Canada ","title":"Main Street Tunnel"},{"id":"2445103","text":"The Adaro were malevolent merman-like sea spirits found in the mythology of the Solomon Islands.

He is especially noted for his design of market buildings, including Covent Garden Market in London. Life =Education and early work= Fowler was born at Cullompton, Devon on 17 May 1792, and baptised on 26 December 1800, also at Cullompton. He was educated at Taunton Grammar School After serving an apprenticeship of seven years with John Powning of Exeter, Powning, who died in Exeter on 16 July 1832, aged 69, was described in his death notice as \\"Member of the Corporation of the Poor for many years, and from 1808 surveyor to the Chamber of Exeter.\\" See he moved to London in 1814, and entered the office of David Laing, where he assisted him on the designs for the Custom House. He then set up his own practice, working from an address in Great Ormond Street, and later, from 1830, at 1, Gordon Square. Fowler generally worked in a classical style, often freely interpreted. Thomas Leverton Donaldson described him as \\"gifted with a practical rather than an imaginative turn of mind.\\". An important early work was the court of bankruptcy in Basinghall Street, finished in 1821. This was a substantial brick building, raised over a granite basement and stuccoed in imitation of rusticated stonework. It had a courtyard, two sides of which had open arcades, supported on square granite columns. In 1822 Fowler entered the competition to design the new London Bridge, and won first prize, with a proposal for five-arched bridge. However, the scheme was rejected by a committee of the House of Commons, and the commission awarded to John Rennie. Four years later he rebuilt the bridge across the River Dart at Totnes in his native Devon. =Markets= Covent Garden Market In 1818 Fowler began work on the new market at Gravesend in Kent, with a pair of colonnades, 80 feet long, connected by a covered building at one end. In around 1826, the Duke of Bedford commissioned him to construct buildings to house the market in the Piazza at Covent Garden, which until then had been accommodated in sheds and hovels. There, as in many other of his buildings, he used Haytor granite mined in Dartmoor, partly for its strength and partly out of a desire to encourage an industry in his native Devon. Just across the Strand, on a site sloping down towards the Thames, he later built Hungerford Market. His involvement with the project predated his designs for Covent Garden, as he had been asked to survey the site as early as 1824, but the act allowing the work and incorporating the company was not enacted until May 1830. Fowler's building was finally opened in 1833. Donaldson praised the way in which Fowler exploited the complex, multi-level site, describing the \\"playful picturesqueness of the group, where court rose above court, galleries above galleries, and where the series of roofs outtopped each other.\\" In this building, Fowler demonstrated his preference for lightweight construction. He later added an iron roof over the main courtyard. Later in the 19th century the building was demolished to make way for Charing Cross Station. He later designed the Cornmarket at Tavistock (1835) for the Duke of Bedford and the Lower Market at Exeter, where he also supervised the construction of the Higher Market, following the death of its architect . =Conservatory at Syon House= In 1827 he designed and built a Conservatory at Syon House for the Duke of Northumberland. This ambitious building, which still exists, is composed of several glasshouses of varying width and height, with a total frontage of ; the central tropical house is in the form of a Greek cross, with a glass dome wide. =Churches= Interior of St Paul, Honiton At Honiton, Devon, Fowler built the church of St Paul (1837‚Äì8) in what Nikolaus Pevsner described as \\"the Norman style, or at least with plenty of Norman motifs\\". Fowler's roof there was of an experimental design, incorporating cast-iron ribs supporting a cement and tile covering; this, however, had to be replaced due to the excessive amount of condensation it collected. His other ecclesiastical work included a chapel at Kilburn and several churches in the Gothic style, including: * Church at Teffont Evias, Wiltshire, later dedicated to St Michael (rebuilding and enlargement, 1824‚Äì26) * St John the Evangelist, Hyde Park, London (1829‚Äì32)originally intended to be called Connaught Chapel: see * St Andrew's church at Charmouth, Dorset (1836) * St Mary's church, Bickleigh, Devon (rebuilding and enlargement, 1838) =Hospitals= In around 1842, after winning a competition, Fowler built the Devon County Lunatic Asylum, designed on a radial plan of the panopticon type pioneered at Millbank Prison. He was also responsible for the London Fever Hospital. in Liverpool Road, Islington. This commission he received due to the influence of the Earl of Devon. The circumstances caused some controversy: a competition had been held to choose a design, and one by David Mocatta had been formally decided upon by the committee, but it was set aside and Fowler was brought in to carry out the work. =Other works= He entered many architectural competitions, coming third in the contest for the Nelson monument in Trafalgar Square with a proposal submitted jointly with the sculptor R.W. Sievier. He was architect and surveyor to the Amicable Society, and to the West of England Fire and Life Insurance Office.The West of England Fire and Life Insurance Company was acquired in 1894 by Commercial Union Assurance Company, which in 1998 merged with General Accident to form CGU. In 2000 Norwich Union merged with CGU. He was employed by Sir Ralph Lopes, the Bishop of Exeter, and the Courtenay family for whom he executed considerable alterations and additions to Powderham Castle. One of his last buildings, constructed in 1852 was the hall of the Wax Chandlers' Company, of which he was a member, and eventually its Master. =Institute of British Architects= Fowler was a founder-member of the Institute of British Architects, and served as its honorary treasury and later vice-president. =Exhibited work= He exhibited at the Royal Academy between 1825 and 1847. =Later life= He retired from architecture in 1853, and died at Great Marlow, Bucks, on 26 September 1867.

He also stated that though many of the Disney characters are not normally dark and serious, there were not many challenges making them so for the story, and despite this, their personalities shine because they maintain their own characteristics. Though Disney gave Nomura freedom in the characters and worlds used for the games, he and his staff tried to stay within the established roles of characters and boundaries of the worlds. When deciding which worlds to include in the game, the development staff tried to take into account worlds with Disney characters that would be interesting. The inclusion of specific Final Fantasy characters was based on the opinions of fans and the development staff. Another criterion for inclusion was whether the staff felt the characters would fit into the storyline and in the Kingdom Hearts universe. Nomura was hesitant to use characters he did not design because he was unfamiliar with the background work of such characters. For Kingdom Hearts II, he changed his mind after receiving pressure from his staff. Throughout the development of the games, Nomura has often left certain events and connections between characters unexplained until the release of future games. Nomura did this because he feels that games should have room for fans to speculate and use their imagination. He stated that with speculation, even though a game may get old, people can still be happy with it. Original characters =Main playable characters= Sora : :Young Sora : is the main protagonist of the Kingdom Hearts series, and the sole playable character of the original game. He is portrayed as a cheerful teenager who lives on the Destiny Islands with his two childhood friends, Riku and Kairi. When his world is beset by creatures of darkness known as the Heartless, Sora comes into possession of a weapon of light called the Keyblade, and he embarks on a journey alongside Donald Duck and Goofy to protect other worlds from the Heartless and nobodies and other forces of evil. Nomura has stated that Sora's name can be interpreted as \\"sky\\", as the Japanese word for sky is . Riku : :Young Riku : is a childhood friend and rival of Sora who resides with him and Kairi on the world of Destiny Islands. Originally appearing as a non-playable character in the original game, where he is introduced as 15 years old, he has a playable role in the \\"Reverse/Rebirth\\" story mode of Chain of Memories, the multiplayer mode of 358/2 Days, and the core story of Dream Drop Distance. He is also a computer-controlled party member exclusive to the final level of Kingdom Hearts II, and is temporarily playable during a sequence where Sora is incapacitated in the game's final boss battle. Riku is also briefly playable at several points in the \\"Dark World\\" in Kingdom Hearts III and is playable a few times in the Re Mind expansion of Kingdom Hearts III. His signature weapon is the \\"Soul Eater\\" sword, a manifestation of the darkness in his heart. During the first game, Riku is revealed to be the rightful owner of Sora's Keyblade, which is bequeathed onto the five-year-old Riku by Terra during the events of Birth by Sleep; however, his reliance on the power of darkness causes the Keyblade to reject Riku in favor of Sora. In Kingdom Hearts II, the 16-year-old Riku acquires another Keyblade of his own, the \\"Way to the Dawn\\"; this Keyblade is later broken in Kingdom Hearts III, leading him to obtain a new Keyblade, \\"Braveheart\\". During the invasion of Heartless in Kingdom Hearts, Riku immerses himself in darkness to discover new worlds beyond his home. Arriving at Hollow Bastion, Riku is manipulated by Maleficent into aiding her plans for world conquest in exchange for knowledge to restoring Kairi's missing heart. He is later tricked into allowing Xehanort's Heartless, Ansem, to possess his body. Following Ansem's defeat, Riku helps Sora and King Mickey close the door to Kingdom Hearts, remaining on the other side with the king. In Chain of Memories, DiZ helps Riku escape from the dark realm. Initially rejecting his darkness out of guilt for his betrayal, Riku resolves to wield both powers of light and darkness to battle Ansem, whose essence lingers in his heart. In Kingdom Hearts II, Riku is forced to harness Ansem's power to capture Roxas in order to restore Sora's missing memories, assuming the Heartless's physical appearance as a result; after the Heartless is destroyed by DiZ's exploding heart encoder, Riku returns to his regular appearance, and he and Sora return to the Destiny Islands together following Xemnas's defeat. In Dream Drop Distance, he and Sora undertake a Mark of Mastery exam in preparation for Xehanort's return. Riku is promoted to Keyblade Master after venturing into Sora's dreams twice in the form of a Dream Eater to protect him from Xehanort. He subsequently embarks with Mickey in Kingdom Hearts III to rescue Aqua from the realm of darkness. Nomura has stated that Riku's name can be interpreted as \\"land\\", since the on'yomi pronunciation of Japanese word for \\"land\\" is , similar to how Sora's name is identical to the Japanese word for \\"sky\\", . Riku's character represents one of the series' main themes, \\"the light and the dark sides of hearts,\\" alongside Sora. On the character's role in Dream Drop Distance, Nomura emphasized Riku as the game's main focus as it shows the character's growth across the series. Kairi : :Young Kairi : is the main female protagonist of Kingdom Hearts, and the best friend of Sora and Riku. She is a non-playable character in most games of the series, but debutes as a playable character in the Re Mind scenario of Kingdom Hearts III. As one of the seven Princesses of Heart, she is cast adrift from her homeworld of Radiant Garden at a young age as part of Xehanort's experiment to locate the key bearer, which eventually brings her to the Destiny Islands, piquing Sora and Riku's interest in other worlds. In Birth by Sleep, it is revealed that her arrival on the islands is the result of an encounter with Aqua, who gives the four-year-old Kairi a protective charm to shield her from the darkness as well as Kairi gaining the ability to wield a Keyblade after touching the one belonging to Aqua. During Kingdom Hearts, the 14-year-old Kairi's heart is stolen by the Heartless commanded by \\"Ansem\\", sending her body into a coma while her heart takes refuge within Sora's. Upon learning her identity as a Princess of Heart and the location of her heart, Sora sacrifices his own heart in order to release hers and return to her body. While Sora disappears, Kairi escapes from a revived Ansem along with Donald Duck and Goofy. Soon after, Kairi finds Sora's Heartless and restores to human form. Kairi later remains behind on the restored Destiny Islands to await Sora's return from this journey. In Kingdom Hearts II, Kairi is approached by Axel to come with her, but she runs away with the help of Pluto. She is soon kidnapped by Sa√Øx to motivate Sora towards acting in the Organization's wishes. She escapes with the help of Namin√© and Riku, receiving her Keyblade \\"Destiny Embrace\\" from the latter to fight alongside Sora while the former merges with her to become a whole being once again. After Sora and Riku defeat the Organization's leader Xemnas, Kairi reunites with them at the Destiny Islands. In Dream Drop Distance, she is summoned by Yen Sid to train as a Keyblade wielder in order to combat Xehanort's reconfigured Organization XIII. In Kingdom Hearts III, Kairi trains with a reformed Axel in a secret place created by Yen Sid's magic. After completing her training, she reunites with her friends and participates in the final battle against Xehanort and Organization XIII, but Xehanort destroys her body to motivate Sora into helping recreate the œá-blade. Following Xehanort's defeat, Sora departs to restore Kairi by using the power of waking; in the final scene of the game, Kairi is shown to have been revived by Sora before he fades away as a consequence. In the \\"Limitcut\\" episode of Re Mind, Kairi is revealed to be in a deep sleep in Ansem's lab, as Ansem The Wise and his apprentices analyze her heart for clues on Sora's whereabouts. Nomura has stated that Kairi's name can be interpreted as \\"sea\\", as the on'yomi pronunciation of the Japanese word for \\"sea\\" is . Roxas : is the initial player-controlled character of Kingdom Hearts II, featured during the game's prologue segment. Introduced as a youth living in a virtual simulation of Twilight Town, he discovers himself to be Sora's Nobody, born when Sora transformed into a Heartless to restore Kairi's heart during the events of the first game. He is also revealed to be a defector from Organization XIII, which sought to utilize his ability to wield the Keyblade. Roxas serves as the main protagonist of Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days, which revolves around the circumstances leading to his eventual defection from the Organization. Roxas sacrifices his own existence to merge with Sora at the end of Kingdom Hearts II's prologue sequence, but is restored in a replica body during the events of Kingdom Hearts III. Terra : is one of the three playable characters of Birth by Sleep. He is a Keyblade wielder who is trained by Master Eraqus alongside Aqua and Ventus, developing a strong sibling-like bond and sharing his dream of becoming a Keyblade Master with them; gameplay-wise, he performs slower, heavier-hitting attacks than Aqua and Ventus. During an exam to obtain the Mark of Mastery, Master Xehanort manipulates the trials to stimulate the darkness that resides inside of Terra, for which he is denied the rank. He is thus easily manipulated by Xehanort's encouragements to channel his darkness into power, and becomes Xehanort's first vessel. Terra is ultimately freed from Xehanort's control and restored to normal during the events of Kingdom Hearts III. Ventus : , commonly nicknamed , is one of the three playable characters of Birth by Sleep who is later revealed to be a member of the Dandelions who survived the Keyblade War before being displaced from his time by Xehanort. Throughout the plot of Birth by Sleep, Xehanort intended Ventus to recreate œá-blade for his agenda. After Ventus sacrifices his heart to prevent the œá-blade's completion, his comatose body is sealed within Castle Oblivion while his heart takes refuge within Sora's, which factors into the physical appearance of Roxas. In Kingdom Hearts III, Sora becomes aware of Ventus's heart within him and uses the power of waking to send it back to his body, reviving him. Ventus later aids Sora and his allies in the final battle with Xehanort. Aqua : is a Keyblade Master who serves as one of the three playable characters of Birth by Sleep, and the sole playable character of A Fragmentary Passage, a direct sequel bundled in Kingdom Hearts HD 2.8 Final Chapter Prologue. She is also playable during one fight in Kingdom Hearts III. She is a nimble character who specializes in magic attacks while dealing weak physical damage. As the only one among her friends to achieve the rank of Keyblade Master by the start of the game, she is tasked by Master Eraqus to watch over Terra and retrieve Ventus when he runs away from home. While attempting to protect Ventus and save Terra from Xehanort's control, she becomes trapped in the realm of darkness, where she remains suspended in time throughout the series while fending off the endless swarms of Heartless. In Kingdom Hearts III, Sora rescues her from the realm of darkness, and she joins him in the final battle against Xehanort. =Other characters= Xehanort :Master Xehanort : :Terra-Xehanort : :Young Xehanort : is the foremost antagonist of the Kingdom Hearts series. Initially introduced as the original form of the sentient Heartless Ansem and superior Nobody Xemnas, Xehanort is further reestablished as an elderly Keyblade Master from the Destiny Islands who acquired the means to transplant his heart into the bodies of others, which he uses to orchestrate the events of the games up to Kingdom Hearts III to suit his agenda. Throughout the series, Xehanort is driven by an obsessive interest in the Keyblade War, a historic cataclysm that resulted in the universe's present, fragmented state. In Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep, he attempts to use the hearts of his pupils Ventus and Vanitas to forge the œá-blade and unlock Kingdom Hearts to incite another war, desiring to create a new world where light and darkness exist in perfect balance. He also transfers his heart into Terra's body, prolonging his own life. However, he is defeated through the combined efforts of Ventus, Terra and Aqua, sustaining amnesia in the process. In Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance, Xehanort returns to his original form following the destruction of Ansem and Xemnas who are revealed to have been created to reenact his original plan by gathering seven \\"guardians of light\\" and thirteen \\"seekers of darkness\\" in the form of the Princesses of Heart and Organization XIII respectively; he also uses time travel to assemble Ansem, Xemnas, and other versions of himself from across time into a new Organization, sending their hearts into replica bodies to co- exist with their present self. In Kingdom Hearts III, Xehanort acquires the œá-blade and summons Kingdom Hearts after his past selves are eliminated during a showdown between the Organization and Sora's group. Upon losing to Sora, Xehanort surrenders and allows his heart to pass on together with his former friend Eraqus. The character's name is an anagram of \\"no heart\\" and \\"another\\" with the additional letter \\"X\\". The character's other featured incarnations are: *Ansem, Xehanort's Heartless and the main antagonist of the first game. He uses Maleficent to gather the Princesses of Heart and produce the Keyhole to Kingdom Hearts, later possessing Riku's body to regain his human appearance; his incorporeal form allows him to travel to the past in Dream Drop Distance. *Xemnas, Xehanort's Nobody and the main antagonist of Kingdom Hearts II.

Despite being an amnesiac, he steals his mentor's identity while conducting his experiments involving Heartless and Nobodies. In Kingdom Hearts III, Terra's heart takes control of the Dark Figure and returns to its body with Sora's help, expelling Xehanort's heart. *Young Xehanort, Xehanort's adolescent self and the primary antagonist of Dream Drop Distance, whom the Heartless Ansem summons from the past to assemble the \\"real\\" Organization XIII from his other incarnations and certain member of the previous Organization. Though he loses his memories upon returning to his time, he remains motivated by the destiny \\"etched in [his] heart\\" to carry out all of his future self's plans. Namin√© : Introduced in Chain of Memories, is revealed in Kingdom Hearts II to be Kairi's Nobody, created when Sora releases Kairi's heart from within himself during the events of the first game. She has the ability to change, rearrange, or erase the memories of Sora and those close to him, for which she is called a witch. Originating at Castle Oblivion, she is forced by Marluxia to alter Sora's memories so he remembers her as a close friend from the Destiny Islands, allowing Marluxia to manipulate him. She later defies Marluxia to reveal the truth to Sora, and oversees the year-long process to restore Sora and his friends' memories to their original state. Namin√© also saves Riku in \\"Reverse/Rebirth\\" from Zexion, disguising herself as Kairi. In Kingdom Hearts II, Namin√© visits Roxas in the virtual Twilight Town to help him discover his true identity as Sora's Nobody. Namin√© returns in the game's final world to help Kairi escape from the Organization's dungeon, after which she merges with Kairi to complete her. In Kingdom Hearts III, Namin√© plays a role in summoning the Lingering Will to help Sora against Terra-Xehanort after being temporarily separated from Kairi's heart. Later, when Kairi's body is destroyed by Xehanort, Namin√©'s heart is released and stored in a replica body provided to Ansem the Wise and his apprentices by Riku, restoring Namin√©'s existence as a separate person, which also takes away Namin√©'s abilities of changing memories in the process. Organization XIII is a group created by Xehanort in his plan to acquire the œá-blade, introduced as thirteen Nobodies who seek the power of Kingdom Hearts to become complete humans, with Xehanort's Nobody Xemnas ranked first as their leader. With the exception of Xemnas using Ansem's name, each Organization member's name is an anagram of their original self's name with the letter \\"X\\" inserted. While Nobodies initially lack true emotion and morality at first, they gradually grow hearts over time. In Dream Drop Distance, it is revealed that the Organization's true purpose is to serve as vessels for Xehanort's heart in his plan to forge the œá-blade, with a second, \\"real\\" Organization XIII being assembled from several of the Organization's older members, who willingly return to their Nobody forms, and various incarnations of Xehanort brought from the past using artificial replica bodies.

He possesses an eye with prophetic vision that allows him to transcribe the Book of Prophecies, embedding it within the \\"No Name\\" Keyblade and passing it down to maintain his future sight until it is acquired by Xehanort at the beginning of the series storyline. In Back Cover, he is shown to have a playful and mischievous personality that conceals his true nature. The Master of Masters is voiced by Tomokazu Sugita in Japanese and Ray Chase in English. * is a character who appears in \\"Toy Box\\" world based on Toy Story as the lead of the in-series video game Verum Rex. He later appears physically in the secret ending of Kingdom Hearts III, and encounters Sora within the Final World in Kingdom Hearts III Re Mind as the boss of the expansion's Secret Episode. Yozora is voiced by Tasuku Hatanaka in Japanese and Dylan Sprouse in English. Xehanort's generation (Kingdom Hearts Dark Road) The following characters debuted in Kingdom Hearts Dark Road, a mobile game focused on Xehanort's youth and training with fellow apprentice Eraqus, under the tutelage of Master Odin. * Master Odin is a senior Keyblade Master and mentor to the pupils at Scala ad Caelum. After the disappearance of seven upperclassmen, he sends his new students to search the worlds. * Vor, Urd, Hermod and Bragi are Xehanort' and Eraqus's fellow keyblade wielders-in- training, apprenticed under Master Odin. They are set on a mission to discover the whereabouts of their vanished colleagues. * Baldr is another Keyblade wielder who lives and trains in Scala ad Caelum. He is only mentioned as being the younger brother of one of the vanished upperclassmen Disney and Square Enix characters = Mickey Mouse = : Mickey Mouse is depicted in the Kingdom Hearts series as the king of Disney Castle, frequently referred to in- game as \\"King Mickey\\" or simply . He is also an experienced Keyblade Master, alternatively wielding a golden version of Sora's \\"Kingdom Key\\" retrieved from the realm of darkness, and the \\"Star Seeker\\" he is seen using during his apprenticeship to Yen Sid in Birth by Sleep. Mickey is absent for most of the original game, which sees him departing his world to discover a solution to the Heartless' invasion, leaving instructions for Donald and Goofy telling to find and protect the Keyblade wielder. He has a more active role fighting alongside Sora and his allies in later installments, which first required the approval of Disney. He is a playable character in Kingdom Hearts II, stepping in to replace Sora whenever the player is defeated during certain boss battles until he is able to revive Sora. He is also available for play in the \\"Mission Mode\\" of Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days as an unlockable character. =Donald Duck and Goofy= :Donald Duck : :Goofy : In various games, Donald Duck and Goofy serve as the player's main computer-controlled partners. They are both depicted as members of Disney Castle's royal court; Donald is a magician who is proficient with a variety of offensive and supportive spells, and Goofy is a peaceful knights' captain who performs supportive and defensive techniques with a shield. In Kingdom Hearts, Donald and Goofy embark on a journey to find their missing king, with orders from a letter left by Mickey to find the Keyblade wielder. They accompany Sora for this reason, initially viewing him as little more than a means to track down the king, and reluctantly abandoning him upon the discovery that Riku is the rightful owner of Sora's Keyblade. However, both eventually grow to care for Sora as a friend and remain with him. The two are also unlockable characters for play in 358/2 Days's \\"Mission Mode\\". =Maleficent= : Maleficent, an evil fairy and the antagonist of the 1959 film Sleeping Beauty, appears as a secondary antagonist in the Kingdom Hearts series. During the first game, she leads a group of other Disney villains‚ÄîHades from Hercules, Jafar from Aladdin, Ursula from The Little Mermaid, Oogie Boogie from The Nightmare Before Christmas, and Captain Hook from Peter Pan‚Äîto capture the Princesses of Heart and harness the power of Kingdom Hearts, which she intends to use to conquer all worlds. In reality, she is an unwitting pawn of Xehanort, who first informs her of the princesses during the prequel Birth by Sleep as part of his own plan to gather components for the œá-blade. Her defeat results in her becoming trapped in the realm of darkness, but she returns after her raven forces Flora, Fauna, and Merryweather to recall their memories of her, allowing her to resume her conquest of worlds. Following Maleficent's attempts to acquire a new lair after losing Hollow Bastion, she and Pete proceed to search for the Master of Master's Black Box for much of Kingdom Hearts III before witnessing Luxu summoning the Foretellers. =Pete= : Pete is included in Kingdom Hearts II as Maleficent's bumbling henchman who first encounters Sora's group while amassing a Heartless army for her, unaware of her earlier defeat. Originally a steamboat captain based on his depiction in Steamboat Willie, Pete is banished to another dimension by Queen Minnie for incessantly causing mischief around Disney Town under the masked superhero guises \\"Captain Justice\\" and \\"Captain Dark\\", as seen in Birth by Sleep. He becomes indebted to Maleficent when she frees him, and he vows to help conquer the worlds in return. He makes recurring appearances throughout Kingdom Hearts II and later installments, menacing Sora's group alongside Maleficent and various other Disney villains. A version of Pete based on his depiction in Mickey, Donald, Goofy: The Three Musketeers also appears in the \\"Country of the Musketeers\\" world based on the film. =Yen Sid= : Yen Sid is the sorcerer from \\"The Sorcerer's Apprentice\\" segment of Fantasia, appearing as King Mickey's old mentor and a retired Keyblade Master who resides in the Mysterious Tower. He first appears in Kingdom Hearts II, where he informs Sora's group of their task at hand on Mickey's behalf. In addition to providing counsel to the main characters of Birth by Sleep, he proctors Sora and Riku's Mark of Mastery exam in Dream Drop Distance to prepare them for an inevitable showdown with Master Xehanort, training Kairi and Lea to serve as two of the potential seven \\"guardians of light\\" as well. =Princesses of Heart= The Princesses of Heart, known as the in the Japanese language version, are maidens whose hearts are made of pure light and devoid of darkness, with the original character Kairi as one such maiden. The roster of the other Princesses includes five official Disney Princesses‚ÄîSnow White from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, Cinderella from the Disney film of the same name, Aurora from Sleeping Beauty, Belle from Beauty and the Beast, and Jasmine from Aladdin, plus Alice from Alice in Wonderland. Kingdom Hearts III introduces new inheritors of the original maidens' powers called the ‚Äîincluding Rapunzel from Tangled and the sisters Anna and Elsa from Frozen‚Äîwith only Kairi retaining her original role. Throughout the original game, Maleficent kidnaps the princesses for their ability to summon the Keyhole to Kingdom Hearts when brought together. Xehanort's Heartless \\"Ansem\\" later uses six of the princesses' hearts to forge a Keyblade with the power to unlock people's hearts, intending to free Kairi's heart from Sora's. Sora restores their hearts after using Ansem's Keyblade on himself to revive Kairi, destroying it. The other princesses remain at Hollow Bastion to contain the darkness spilling from the Keyhole until the door to Kingdom Hearts is sealed, subsequently returning to their homeworlds. In the prequel Birth by Sleep, it is revealed that Master Xehanort seeks out the Princesses of Heart, spurring Maleficent into gathering them as well; it is later explained in Dream Drop Distance that the princesses' hearts represent the seven fragments of light broken off from the œá-blade, which Xehanort intends to use in his plan to forge the weapon. To prevent this, Yen Sid prepares to substitute the princesses with seven Keyblade wielders to clash with Xehanort's reformed Organization XIII. =Party members and summons= Several games in the Kingdom Hearts series feature computer-controlled characters that are added to the player's party in a specific world. The first game features six different party members in addition to Donald and Goofy: Tarzan in the Deep Jungle; Aladdin in Agrabah; Ariel in Atlantica from The Little Mermaid; Jack Skellington in Halloween Town from The Nightmare Before Christmas; Peter Pan in Never Land; and Beast from Beauty and the Beast in Hollow Bastion, a world exclusive to the series. In addition, there are six characters that can be acquired as summoned allies in the game: adult Simba from The Lion King, Genie from Aladdin, Dumbo, Bambi, Tinker Bell from Peter Pan, and Mushu from Mulan. Chain of Memories features the same party and summoned characters from the first game, with the inclusion of Cloud Strife as an additional summon. Aladdin, Jack, and the Beast return as party members in Kingdom Hearts II, with Ariel appearing in a non-playable capacity, and Peter Pan appearing as a summon in tandem with Tinker Bell. Adult Simba is featured as a full party member in The Lion Kings Pride Lands, while Mushu becomes a supporting ally in tandem with new party member Mulan in the film's Land of Dragons. Other new party members include Final Fantasy X character Auron in the Hercules-inspired Olympus Coliseum world, Jack Sparrow in the Pirates of the Caribbeans Port Royal, and Tron in Space Paranoids. Chicken Little and Stitch are included as new summons. Birth by Sleep removes the standard party system utilized by previous games, instead using characters as temporary partners during certain portions of the game. These characters are Prince Phillip in Enchanted Dominion, based on Sleeping Beauty; Hercules and Zack Fair in Olympus Coliseum, with the latter being based on his Final Fantasy VII: Crisis Core appearance; and Stitch, named \\"Experiment 626\\", in the Lilo & Stitch-inspired Deep Space. Hercules and Jack Sparrow return as party members in Kingdom Hearts III, with new party members including Woody and Buzz Lightyear from Toy Story, Rapunzel and Flynn Rider from Tangled, James P. Sullivan and Mike Wazowski from Monsters, Inc., Marshmallow from Frozen, and Baymax from Big Hero 6, all in worlds based on their respective films. Wreck- It Ralph, Simba, Ariel, and Stitch also appear as summonable \\"Link\\" characters alongside the \\"Meow Wow\\" Dream Eater from Dream Drop Distance. =Other Disney characters= One of the common elements in the Kingdom Hearts series is the inclusion of levels based on various Disney and Pixar films, as well as related media. Several key characters from the films appear in their respective worlds, closely following their roles from the film and play a small role in the main story. Several characters from the Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck universes appear in the Kingdom Hearts series, most of them appearing at the original world Disney Castle and its adjacent urban area, Disney Town. Minnie Mouse is portrayed as the queen of Disney Castle who rules in the absence of her husband, King Mickey. Daisy Duck, Donald Duck's girlfriend, is Queen Minnie's lady-in-waiting. Pluto reprises his role as Mickey's pet and makes recurring appearances throughout the series, accompanying Donald and Goofy's search for the king in the first game. Chip and Dale act as Disney Castle's technicians, managing the Gummi Ship that Sora's party uses to travel between worlds; they play a major role in Coded, where they construct the machine used to digitize the contents of Jiminy Cricket's journal. Donald's nephews Huey, Dewey, and Louie appear as shop owners in Kingdom Hearts and Kingdom Hearts II, where they attempt to save up money to go on their own adventure. Scrooge McDuck appears in Kingdom Hearts II, Birth by Sleep, and Kingdom Hearts III where he attempts to open business venues, such as a transit system between worlds, an ice cream business, and a restaurant in Twilight Town. The Beagle Boys, as depicted in Mickey, Donald, Goofy: The Three Musketeers, reprise their roles from the film as Pete's minions in the Dream Drop Distance level \\"Country of the Musketeers\\". Other characters such as Horace Horsecollar, Clarabelle Cow, and Clara Cluck make minor appearances in Kingdom Hearts II and Birth by Sleep. Ludwig Von Drake does not appear physically, but is mentioned on the Classic Kingdom posters found in Twilight Town in Kingdom Hearts III. Characters from other Disney films also play prominent roles in the games' story. Jiminy Cricket appears as a chronicler of Sora's travels, recording information about the people, places and events they encounter in his journals; he also retains his role from Pinocchio as the title character's conscience. Merlin from The Sword in the Stone acts as Sora's mentor in performing magic, and he keeps an enchanted book that allows players access to the Hundred Acre Wood world based on Disney's Winnie the Pooh franchise. The Fairy Godmother from Cinderella appears in Merlin's house in Kingdom Hearts, where she transforms \\"summon gems\\" collected throughout the game into summoned allies; she also appears in Birth by Sleep as a resident of her original world, the Castle of Dreams. The One Hundred and One Dalmatians are featured in a side-quest in the first game, where players retrieve Pongo and Perdita's 99 puppies scattered throughout the game's worlds in exchange for prizes. Flora, Fauna, and Merryweather from Sleeping Beauty appear in Kingdom Hearts II, where they provide Sora with new clothes that grant him access to Drive Forms. Kingdom Hearts III includes Remy from Pixar's Ratatouille as the chef of Scrooge McDuck's bistro, where he hosts a cooking minigame. =Other Square Enix characters= In addition to Disney elements, Kingdom Hearts features characters from other Square Enix- developed titles, most prominently Final Fantasy. A majority of the games include Moogles, small creatures that are a recurring element throughout the Final Fantasy series; they serve to run shops where players can create and purchase items used in the game. Kingdom Hearts prominently depicts several Final Fantasy characters as residents of the ruined world Radiant Garden, known as Hollow Bastion prior to Kingdom Hearts II. Led by Squall Leonheart from Final Fantasy VIII, who goes by the name out of shame for his inability to save his home, the group also includes Final Fantasy VII characters Aerith Gainsborough, a flower girl and healer; Yuffie Kisaragi, a friendly ninja; and Cid Highwind, an expert in the games' \\"Gummi Ship\\" feature. These characters form the \\"Hollow Bastion Restoration Committee\\" in Kingdom Hearts II, with the goal of rebuilding their destroyed world following Maleficent's defeat, using the home of Merlin as a base. In both games, Leon and Yuffie are featured as opponents in the Olympus Coliseum. The Restoration Committee return in Kingdom Hearts III Re Mind, helping Riku search for clues to the missing Sora's disappearance. Youthful versions of Final Fantasy X characters Tidus and Wakka, as well as Final Fantasy VIII character Selphie Tilmitt, make recurring appearances as residents of the Destiny Islands. The three serve as optional sparring partners early in the first game. Cloud Strife appears in Kingdom Hearts at Olympus Coliseum, based on Disney's Hercules. In the game, he is a mercenary hired by Hades to kill Hercules in exchange for the whereabouts of Sephiroth, who is an optional boss included in the North American, PAL, and Final Mix releases of the game. Cloud and Tifa Lockhart later appear in Kingdom Hearts II as allies of the Hollow Bastion Restoration Committee; Sephiroth also returns here as an optional boss, and is depicted as the embodiment of Cloud's darkness. Younger incarnations of Final Fantasy VIII characters Seifer Almasy, Fujin, and Raijin‚Äîthe latter two named \\"Fuu\\" and \\"Rai\\", respectively‚Äîappear in Kingdom Hearts II as members of Twilight Town's self-proclaimed disciplinary committee. Twilight Town also depicts Final Fantasy IXs Vivi Ornitier as an admirer of Seifer, and Final Fantasy VIs Setzer Gabbiani as a champion of the local Struggle sport; neither character was designed by Nomura, who included them under pressure from his staff. The Gullwings from Final Fantasy X-2‚ÄîYuna, Rikku and Paine‚Äîare depicted as fairy- like creatures in Kingdom Hearts II, where they are initially sent by Maleficent to spy on the Hollow Bastion Restoration Committee, but later switch sides to help Sora's group in exchange for treasure. The main characters of The World Ends with You‚ÄîNeku Sakuraba, Yoshiya \\"Joshua\\" Kiryu, Shiki Misaki, Daisukenojo \\"Beat\\" Bito, and Raimu \\"Rhyme\\" Bito‚Äîappear in Dream Drop Distance as players of a Reapers' Game in Traverse Town. They are depicted as figments of their original selves, saved from fading out of existence by Joshua following Shibuya's destruction. Merchandise Kingdom Hearts character figurines; a Play Arts figure of Roxas appears in the center and Formation Arts Volume 1 & 2 figures are arrayed around him. The characters of the Kingdom Hearts series have had various types of merchandise modeled after their likeness. Square Enix has released a collection of Formation Arts figurines that feature several of the main characters from the first game. A series of Play Arts action figures has also been released. Other merchandise includes jewelry and key chains modeled after character apparel and accessories. The characters are also featured on posters, desktop wallpapers, and trading cards that are part of the Kingdom Hearts Trading Card Game. Reception Overall, the characters within the Kingdom Hearts series have been well received and have garnered praise for the quality of their voice acting as well as their visual style. IGN, GameSpy, and Game Informer all praised the animation quality of the characters. IGN's David Smith's impressions of the characters were very positive, referring to them as an \\"engaging cast\\", and stating the \\"characters' acting is helped immensely by the facial expressions and body\\". The design of the characters created specifically for Kingdom Hearts was seen as the highlight of the first game, stating \\"the majority of its best visual moments are based on original designs\\". One complaint he expressed was \\"the odd bit of cheating with the lip-synching, where textured facial features are substituted for full 3D animation\\". GameSpy stated the Disney characters \\"slide perfectly into Square's visual style\\", and complemented the realistic characters from Pirates of the Caribbean, describing them as \\"remarkably accurate\\". GameSpot commented the first game created a \\"fascinating world\\" using the Disney and Final Fantasy characters. GameSpy stated the inclusion of the Disney and Square Enix characters was handled well. The main character Sora has also received press comments. In January 2007, Sora was listed the 4th biggest dork of 2006 by Game Informer, citing the Atlantica singing portions of the game. IGN listed him as a possible character in Super Smash Bros. Brawl; though he was not chosen as the \\"reader's choice\\". GameSpy praised the voice cast and voice acting in the first and third games. G4TV awarded Kingdom Hearts II \\"Best Voice Over\\" in their 2006 G-phoria Awards. Game Informer praised the voice acting of the third game, particularly the performances by Haley Joel Osment, Christopher Lee, and James Woods. They also stated the voice talent \\"shines across the board.\\" Reception towards the voice acting in Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep, however, was decidedly mixed, with praise aimed at the performances of Jesse McCartney, Mark Hamill and Leonard Nimoy, while Willa Holland and Jason Dohring's performances received a more mixed reaction, with GameSpot referring to Dohring's performance as \\"abysmal\\".

It is a very strategic game that rewards careful planning, since the cards that potentially block the game are presented at the start, and with care it can be completed about half the number of attempts.\\"Terrace\\" (p.247) in The Complete Book of Card Games by Peter Arnold, Hamlyn Publishing, 2010. Rules First, the player deals eleven overlapping cards in a row. These cards form the reserve or terrace. After leaving a space below the terrace for the foundations, the player lays four cards in a row. The player then chooses which of these four cards starts the first foundation. The player places the chosen card on the foundation row, immediately fills the gap it left with a new card from the stock. The player adds five new cards beside these four to form the tableau. The player builds the foundations in alternating colors, wrapping from King to Ace if necessary. The cards on the tableau are available to build either on the foundations, or on other cards in the tableau. Cards on the tableau are built down on each other, also in alternating colors, and the player immediately fills any gap with a card from the stock. The player moves one card at a time, and when building cards form a column, only the top card is available for play. The top card (the exposed card) of the terrace is the only card available for play and the player can only use it to build on the foundations. When there are no more possible moves on the tableau, the stock is dealt one card at a time and placed on the wastepile, the top card of which is available to be built on the foundations or the tableau. The top card of the wastepile is also used to fill a gap on the tableau whenever it occurs. However, when the stock runs out, there is no redeal; the game ends soon after. The player wins the game when all cards end up in the foundations--and loses when stuck after dealing the entire stock. Variations Since this is an old and classic game, several common variations exist, including Blondes and Brunettes, Redheads, and Falling Star, and General's Patience. In some cases the initial foundation card is decided by the deal rather than the player. In other cases empty spaces are filled automatically from the stock or by the waste pile, or can be filled by using cards from the tableau. Sometimes a single re-deal is allowed. General's Patience requires the foundations to be built up by suit rather than alternate colours.

Origins A traditional Iranun house in the Heritage Village of Kota Kinabalu, Sabah The name \\"Iranun\\" has the same meaning as the name of the Maranao people, meaning \\"people of the lake\\", referring to Lake Lanao. They are both closely related, along with the Maguindanao people (whose name can also be translated to mean \\"people of the lake\\"), \\"Iranun\\" (archaic \\"Iranaoan\\") may have been the original endonym of the ancestral group which later split into the Iranun, Maranao, and Maguindanao people. The Iranun and Maranao still speak the language closest to the ancient Proto-Danaw among all of the Danao languages spoken by these groups. The modern Iranun are believed to be descendants of Maranao who left Lake Lanao and settled elsewhere. These migrations were usually of merchant clans of the Maranao which established trading routes near the coast. Some Iranun clans, however, are descendants of outcast clans that left Lake Lanao after one of their clan members committed a murder. This was to avoid the open retaliatory conflicts that usually result due to the tradition of rido. This has occurred multiple times in the history of the Maranao, with one recorded incident in 1966 when an entire kin group disappeared overnight after a murder. Most Iranun settled coastal areas of the Illana Bay and Maguindanao, but a few migrated to Sulu or further onward to Sabah. A clear evidence of this is recorded in the salsilas (genealogies) of the Iranun, which still mention grar (titles) with place-names that are clearly from Lanao, even though they do not inhabit those regions anymore. History 1890 illustration by Rafael Monle√≥n of a late 18th-century Iranun lanong warship For centuries, the Iranun were involved in pirate-related occupations in Southeast Asia. Lanun means pirate in Malay language. Originally from the Sultanate of Maguindanao, in southern Mindanao, Iranun colonies spread throughout Mindanao, the Sulu Archipelago and the north and east coast of Borneo. Most Iranuns are Muslim. Their language is part of the Austronesian family, and is most closely related to the Maranao people of Lanao. Historically, the Iranun were given the exonym Ilanun (also spelled variously as Illanun, Illanoan, Illanoon, Ilanoon, etc.) during the British colonial era. The Malay term Lanun or pirate originated from the exonym. In the case of inter-marriages of an Iranun woman and an outsider man, the cultural influences of the woman's family will be more dominant that the outsider man would be considered as an Iranun man; although in a lot cases this does not happen. For several centuries, the Iranuns in the Philippines formed part of the Sultanate of Maguindanao. In the past, the seat of the Maguindanao Sultanate was situated at Lamitan and Malabang. Both of which were the strongholds of the Iranun society. Iranuns fought the Western invaders under the flag of the Maguindanao Sultanate. They formed part of the Moro resistance against the USA occupation of the Philippines from 1899 to 1913. The Iranun were excellent in maritime activity as they are traditionally sailors and pirates. They used to ply the route connecting the Sulu Sea, Moro Gulf to Celebes Sea, and raided the Spanish held territories along the way.

American Journalism 1690-1940, Volume 4 (Psychology Press, 2000), p. 591. It became a dominant player in the syndication market in the early 1930s. In March 1930, United Features acquired the Metropolitan Newspaper Service (ostensibly from the Bell Syndicate). And in late February 1931, Scripps acquired the New York World, which controlled the syndication arms of the Pulitzer company: World Feature Service and Press Publishing Co. (which unlike other syndicates were owned by the paper rather than being separate entities). The Metropolitan Newspaper Service acquisition brought over the comic strips Tarzan and Ella Cinders. The World Feature Service acquisition brought over the comic strips The Captain and the Kids, Everyday Movies, Fritzi Ritz, Hawkshaw the Detective, Joe Jinks, and Little Mary Mixup. From this point, United Features became a successful distributor of newspaper comics,Ron Goulart, The Adventurous Decade. Arlington House, New Rochelle, N.Y. 1975.

The oldest syndicate still in operation, the NEA was originally a secondary news service to the Scripps Howard News Service; it later evolved into a general syndicate best known for syndicating the comic strips Alley Oop, Our Boarding House, Freckles and His Friends, The Born Loser, Frank and Ernest, and Captain Easy / Wash Tubbs; in addition to an annual Christmas comic strip. Along with United Feature Syndicate, the NEA was part of United Media from 1978 to 2011, and is now a division of Andrews McMeel Syndication. The NEA once selected college All-America teams, and presented awards in professional football. Corporate history On June 2, 1902, the Newspaper Enterprise Association, based in Cleveland, Ohio, started as a news report service for different Scripps-owned newspapers. It started selling content to non-Scripps owned newspapers in 1907, and by 1909, it became a more general syndicate, offering comics, pictures and features as well. NEA moved headquarters from Cleveland to Chicago in 1915, with an office in San Francisco. NEA rapidly grew and delivered content to 400 newspapers in 1920. At that time, it had some 100 features available. From 1918 to 1928, Major League Baseball umpire Billy Evans served as NEA's sports editor and produced a syndicated sports column titled Billy Evans Says. His staff featured well- known sportswriters Jimmy Powers and Joe Williams. Alfred O. Andersson was general manager of the NEA from 1919 to 1921. By 1930, NEA had about 700 client newspapers. In 1934 and 1935, Mary Margaret McBride was the women's page editor for the NEA. Boyd Lewis became the executive editor of the NEA service in 1945; he was president in 1968. Writer Russell R. Winterbotham was fiction editor of the NEA throughout the 1940s and 1950s. Sports cartoonist and writer Murray Olderman had a long association with NEA. Firstly, his columns and cartoons were syndicated by the agency.Horgan, Richard. \\"SO WHAT DO YOU DO, MURRAY OLDERMAN, ICONIC SPORTS JOURNALIST AND CARTOONIST?,\\" Media Bistro (May 21, 2014). He officially joined the company in 1952; becoming its sports editor in 1964; executive editor in 1968; and a contributing editor in 1971. He was the founder of the Jim Thorpe Trophy, for the National Football League's Most Valuable Player, and distributed by the NEA.Olderman bio , Jewish Sports.net. Accessed Aug. 25, 2014. He also founded the NEA All-Pro team in 1954, which ran through 1992. Although Olderman \\"retired\\" in 1987, he was active until the news service was overtaken by a larger corporation. In 1968, the NEA was offering about 75 features to more than 750 client newspapers.Maley, Don. \\"Super Roads to Riches are Paved with Comics,\\" Editor & Publisher (Nov. 30, 1968).

Landon (1878‚Äì1937) joined NEA as art director. Founder of the Landon School of Illustration and Cartooning, a mail-order correspondence course that trained a generation of cartoonists, Landon personally hired some graduates to draw features at the syndicate.

One of these, titled Freckles, began as a one-column daily gag panel on August 16, expanding into a full comic strip on September 20 when it was retitled Freckles and His Friends. One by one, each of the other panels were dropped. In July 1916, Blosser started another strip, Miniature Movies, which evolved into Chestnut Charlie, continuing until early in 1918 when Blosser concentrated exclusively on Freckles and His Friends.The Albertan, October 3, 1945. Cartoonist Edgar Martin joined the NEA in 1921 as a cartoonist.University of Missouri: MU Libraries Special Collections Retrieved October 18, 2015Reynolds, Moira Davidson. Comic Strip Artists in American Newspapers, 1945-1980. McFarland, 2003. While working in NEA's art department, Martin experimented with several strips: Efficiency Ed, Fables of 1921, Taken from Life, and Girls. In 1924, NEA was looking for a \\"girl strip,\\" and several artists who had previously submitted strips were asked to resubmit them. Martin's sample was unsigned. When an editor examined Martin's strip and asked, \\"How soon can we get this artist?\\", the art director responded, \\"In one minute. He works here.\\" Thus, Girls became Boots and Her Buddies on February 18, 1924, although some newspapers continued to use the first title. NEA became a successful distributor of newspaper comics in the 1920s and 1930s.Ron Goulart, The Adventurous Decade. Arlington House, New Rochelle, N.Y. 1975. (p. 26-7,93-5). In 1921 Gene Ahern introduced the Nut Brothers, Ches and Wal, in the new strip Crazy Quilt. That same year, NEA General Manager Frank Rostock suggested to Ahern that he use a boarding house for a setting. Our Boarding House began September 16, 1921, scoring a huge success with readers after the January 1922 arrival of the fustian Major Hoople. The Nut Bros: Ches and Wal ran as a topper strip above Our Boarding House. Other long-running NEA strips that launched during the 1920s included Martin's Boots and Her Buddies, Roy Crane's Wash Tubbs, Ethel Hays' Flapper Fanny Says, and J. R. Williams' Out Our Way. Popular NEA strips that originated in the 1930s include V. T. Hamlin's Alley Oop, Crane's Captain Easy , and Stephen Slesinger & Fred Harman's Red Ryder. Bela Zaboly started at NEA as an office boy and eventually was a staff cartoonist. During the early 1930s he created the Sunday strip Otto Honk about moon-faced, dim-bulb Otto, who was variously employed as a private eye, movie stunt man and football player. Otto Honk lasted until 1936. Zaboly was an assistant to Roy Crane on Wash Tubbs.Zaboly entry, Lambiek's Comiclopedia. Accessed Dec. 13, 2018. Cartoonist Herb Block (\\"Herblock\\") moved to Cleveland in 1933 to become a staff cartoonist for the NEA, which distributed his cartoons nationally. While there, he won his first Pulitzer Prize in 1942 for \\"British Plane\\". Dell Publishing's ongoing comic book series The Funnies (launched 1936) utilized a number of NEA strips to start out, including Alley Oop and Captain Easy.Goulart, Ron. \\"The Funnies: II\\" Comic Book Encyclopedia, p. 163 By 1936 Gene Ahern was making an annual $35,000 at NEA, and King Features Syndicate offered to double that figure. Ahern left NEA in March 1936 for King Features, where he created Room and Board. Similarly, in 1943 Roy Crane exited the NEA (abandoning his strips Captain Easy and Wash Tubbs) for King Features to begin Buz Sawyer, a strip he would own outright.Mason, Tom. \\"Roy Crane, Wash Tubbs, Captain Easy and Buz Sawyer\\", June 14, 2010. NEA's Bugs Bunny strip launched in 1942 and was syndicated for 51 years. Al Vermeer's Priscilla's Pop was a long-running strip that launched in 1946. Dick Cavalli's Winthrop (originally called Morty Meekle) debuted in 1955 and lasted 39 years. Three strips that debuted in the 1960s and 1970s are still in syndication via the NEA: The Born Loser (launched 1965), Frank and Ernest (launched 1972), and Kevin Fagan's Drabble, which debuted in 1979. The Newspaper Enterprise Association brand has persisted both under the United Media umbrella and now Universal Uclick/Andrews McMeel Syndication.  Sports All-America team selections and awards  = All-America team selections = From 1924 to 1996, the NEA was the selector of college football All-America teams. It was a granting institution in the selection of the NCAA Men's Basketball All-Americans teams in 1938 and from 1953 to 1963. =NFL awards= Beginning in 1954 the Newspaper Enterprise Association, under the guidance of Murray Olderman, began to poll NFL players and award what became known as the Players' All-Pro team. In addition, the NEA awarded a Rookie of the Year, a Most Valuable Player (since 1955), and a Defensive Player of the Year (George S. Halas Trophy; 1966‚Äì96). All were accepted as official and were published in the NFL Record and Fact Book alongside the Associated Press, United Press International, and the Pro Football Writers Association All-Pro teams and awards. The NEA last announced awards in 1997 and last had an All-Pro team in 1992, ending a 34-year tradition of the \\"Player's All-Pro Team\\". (The NEA list's successor, the Sporting News All-Pro team, currently polls players along with coaches and managers for its teams.) From the early 1980s the NEA All-Pro team was released in the World Almanac which was an NEA publication. The NFL MVP award was called the Jim Thorpe Trophy and began in 1955 (not to be confused with college football's Jim Thorpe Award). The Defensive Player of the Year was named after Chicago Bears founder George S. Halas and its inception was 1966, the Rookie of the Year award was named after NFL commissioner Bert Bell and began in 1964. In the early 1960s the NEA began awarding the Third Down Trophy that symbolized each team's MVP. That began in the American Football League and included the NFL after the 1970 AFL-NFL merger and ran through 1979. Currently the Jim Thorpe Trophy is still awarded, through the Jim Thorpe Association of Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. It is awarded to the NFL Most Valuable Player and is voted upon by members of the NFLPA. Olderman, the driving force behind the Players' All-Pro teams and awards, was also a fine artist and cartoonist. When the NEA news service released its stories on the annual NFL awards they were accompanied by artwork provided by Olderman to illustrate the stories.

This year, Universal, which now owns the syndicate, said they wouldn't be issuing one. And I very much doubt they'll change their mind in coming years\\". They typically ran for three to four weeks before Christmas, with the concluding installment on December 25 or a nearby date. Strip historian Allan Holtz notes that over the years these strips featured regular NEA characters, adapted classic Christmas stories, and original stories with single-appearance characters. Cartoonist Walt Scott was responsible for the Christmas strip for many years, starting in 1937, and then from 1950 to 1962. He illustrated the strip in 1937, 1949, 1960, and 1961; and wrote & drew it from 1950 to 1959 (with 1954 being a reprint) and in 1962. Hal Cochran wrote the strip from 1937 to 1943. The 1942 strip, \\"Santa's Victory Christmas,\\" had a World War II-era theme of conserving raw materials to further the war effort, and was drawn by Superman ghost artist Leo Nowak.\\"Santa's Victory Christmas,\\" Hogan's Alley, 2012 The 1967 entry, Bucky's Christmas Caper, was written and drawn by famed comic book creator Wally Wood. Phil Pastoret wrote the Christmas strip in 1971, 1974, and 1977.
