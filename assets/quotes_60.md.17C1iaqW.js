Heinz Maier-Leibnitz (28 March 1911 in Esslingen am Neckar - 16 December 2000 in Allensbach) was a German physicist. He made contributions to nuclear spectroscopy, coincidence measurement techniques, radioactive tracers for biochemistry and medicine, and neutron optics. He was an influential educator and an advisor to the Federal Republic of Germany on nuclear programs. During World War II, Maier-Leibnitz worked at the Institute of Physics of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Medical Research, in Heidelberg. After the war, he spent a year working in North America, after which he returned to the Institute of Physics. In 1952, he assumed the Chair for Technical Physics and directorship of the Laboratory for Technical Physics at the . He became a leader in establishing and building centers which used nuclear reactors as neutron sources for research. The first was the Research Reactor Munich, which was the seed for the entire Garching research campus of the . The second was the German-French project to construct a high-flux neutron source and found the in Grenoble, France; he was also its first director. His leadership also helped establish the Physics Department at the . Maier-Leibnitz was the chairman of a special committee for designing the German Nuclear Program, and thus he was the architect of the first full-scale nuclear program of the Federal Republic of Germany. He was a signatory of the G√∂ttingen Manifest. In his honor, the German Research Foundation annually awards six scientists with the . The research reactor is officially named . Education Maier-Leibnitz studied physics at the University of Stuttgart and the University of G√∂ttingen. He received his doctorate in 1935, from the University of G√∂ttingen, under the Nobel Laureate James Franck and Georg Joos ‚Äì Franck had emigrated from Germany in 1933 and his successor was Joos. Maier- Leibnitz was in the field of atomic physics, and he discovered metastable, negative helium ions, which later had applications in particle accelerators.Eckert, 1988, 88-89.Kienle, 2001, 65-66. Career Shortly after receipt of his doctorate in 1935, Maier-Leibnitz became an assistant to Walther Bothe, Director of the (Institute for Physics) of the (KWImF, Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Medical Research), in Heidelberg. [Note: After World War II, the KWImF was renamed the Max-Planck Institut f√ºr medizinische Forschung. In 1958, Bothe's was spun off and elevated to become the (MPIK, Max Planck Institute for Nuclear Physics).] Bothe had first met Maier-Leibnitz while on a recruiting trip to the University of G√∂ttingen during which Robert Pohl and Georg Joos highly recommended Maier-Leibnitz for his intelligence and creativity. Maier-Leibnitz arrived at the Institute for Physics shortly after the arrival of Wolfgang Gentner, who became recognized as Bothe's second in command and took Maier-Leibnitz under his wing to become his mentor, critic, and a close friend. Maier-Leibnitz worked on nuclear spectroscopy, electron- gamma-ray coincidence measurements, radioactive tracers, and energy conservation in Compton scattering.Walther Bothe and the Physics Institute: the Early Years of Nuclear Physics Nobelprize.org. In the early years of World War II, Maier-Leibnitz first served in the German air defense and then as a meteorologist at air bases in France. In 1942, he returned to continue his work with Bothe, who, since 1939, had been a principal in the German nuclear energy project, also known as the (Uranium Club). After World War II, due to the ravages of war and the Allied occupation policies, Bothe's Institute for Physics fell on hard times. Maier-Leibnitz, Kurt Starke, and other younger colleagues of Bothe left for employment in North America. Maier-Leibnitz left in the spring of 1947. When his contract expired in the spring of 1948, he returned to again work for Bothe. Maier-Leibnitz continued to work on nuclear spectroscopy and radioactive tracers in biochemistry and medicine. He also took up the study of positron annihilation in solids, which became a new tool for measuring the momentum distribution of bound electrons.Walker, 1993, 179 ‚Äì 181. In 1952, upon the retirement of Walther Meissner, Maier-Leibnitz assumed the (Chair for Technical Physics) and directorship of the (Laboratory for Technical Physics) at the (in 1970 renamed the ). This became the nucleus of the Maier-Leibnitz school for nuclear solid state physics. The far-sightedness of Maier-Leibnitz led to reorganization and expansion of physics at the and the formation of the Physics Department in 1965. One of his first major expansions was done with the appointment of Nikolaus Riehl, who had returned to Germany in 1955, after having been taken to the Soviet Union in 1945 to work on the Soviet atomic bomb project. Riehl was an authority on the purification of uranium, and he greatly contributed to bringing about the construction of a new research tool at the . Through the initiative and leadership of Maier-Leibnitz, the (FRM, Research Reactor Munich) was built in Garching bei M√ºnchen; it was the first nuclear reactor built in Germany. This reactor, popularly called the (atomic egg), based on its characteristic shape, was built in 1956 and became operational in 1957. Rather than being used to study reactor physics and technology, the swimming-pool-type reactor was used as a neutron source, and it became a versatile tool for interdisciplinary research. Furthermore, it was the seed for the entire Garching research campus. A second reactor built nearby, (FRM II, Research Reactor Munich II), went critical for the first time four years after the death of Maier-Leibnitz; it was named the in his honor.Gerhard Abstreiter History, . .. During 1956 and 1957, Maier-Leibnitz was a member of the (Nuclear Physics Working Group) of the (Commission II ‚ÄúResearch and Growth‚Äù) of the (DAtK, German Atomic Energy Commission). Other members of the Nuclear Physics Working Group in both 1956 and 1957 were: Werner Heisenberg (chairman), Hans Kopfermann (vice-chairman), Fritz Bopp, Walther Bothe, Wolfgang Gentner, Otto Haxel, Willibald Jentschke, Josef Mattauch, Wolfgang Riezler, Wilhelm Walcher and Carl Friedrich von Weizs√§cker. Wolfgang Paul was also a member of the group during 1957.Horst Kant Werner Heisenberg and the German Uranium Project / Otto Hahn and the Declarations of Mainau and G√∂ttingen, Preprint 203 (Max-Planck Institut f√ºr Wissenschaftsgeschichte, 2002). Maier-Leibnitz was also a member of the (Nuclear Reactor Working Group) of the DAtK, and it was considered to be the most active and influential board of the DAtK. Some of the other members of the group were Erich Bagge, Wolfgang Finkelnburg, and Karl Wirtz. For the first decade of nuclear energy development in the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG), it was the center of decision making, and it had representative membership from German industry. Maier-Leibnitz was also the chairman of a special committee for designing the (German Nuclear Program). From this position, he became the architect of the first full-scale nuclear program of the FRG.Eckert, 1988, 91, 91n26, and 94. In 1961, became an (professor ordinarius) of technical physics at the . Also in 1961, Rudolf L. M√∂√übauer, a former student of Maier-Leibnitz at , received the Nobel Prize in Physics for his discovery of recoil-free emission and absorption of gamma radiation in solids known as the M√∂√übauer Effect, which led to numerous applications in solid state physics, chemistry, biophysics, medicine and archeology. Maier- Leibnitz, along with his colleagues Wilhelm Brenig, Nikolaus Riehl and Wolfgang Wild, in a memorandum in 1962, proposed the establishment of a Physics Department at the . This was used as bargaining tool to bring M√∂√übauer from the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena back to the in 1964. The Physics Department was founded on 1 January 1965, replacing the three former independent institutes, but now with ten full professors, one of which was Maier-Leibnitz; the three institutes replaced were the , the , and the . Through his experience and expertise in instrumental techniques, particularly neutron optics, Maier-Leibnitz was one of the first to realize that the neutron flux from the FRM was too low for some interesting experiments. Maier- Leibnitz was instrumental, along with Louis N√©el, in bringing about the German-French project to construct a high-flux neutron source and founded the in Grenoble in 1967, named in honor of the physicist Max von Laue and Paul Langevin. The reactor had the first source of cold neutrons.

The Safi tribe comprises a majority in the Pech Valley of Kunar and are present in significant numbers in Parwan Province (Kohi Safi), Kapisa Province, Kabul Province, Laghman Province, Nuristan Province and the whole of Kunar Province. A reasonable majority also resides in different urban and rural areas of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, particularly Peshawar, Charsadda, Mardan, Nowshehra, Swabi. A large number also settled in Rawalpindi, Tarnol, Lahore, Multan. They are also present in large number in Mohmand, Bajaur Agency, Federally Administered Tribal Areas and in Zhob District, Balochistan, Pakistan. Safi divisions Currently, Safi tribesmen are found everywhere in Afghanistan and north west Pakistan. The Safi are divided into three main clans: the 1-Gurbuz; the 2-Mehsud or Masawad; and the 3-Wazir or Wadair, also known as Qandahari. The exact population number of this clan is not known; however, it is estimated to be around 2.5 million, both in Afghanistan and in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas of Pakistan. Safis have played an important role in Afghan society, especially in the Afghan Government; they were known to be opposed to the Afghan monarchy. The Safis have also had an important role in Pakistan. Currently, Safis serve in key posts in different public sector institutions. On 10 September 2007, Safi elders in the Mohmand Agency played a key part in reaching an agreement with Taliban fighters to stop attacks on the Pakistani military and security forces, and on institutions such as schools and hospitals in the Mohmand Agency. The Safis, because of their association with the Mohmand, are also called Safi Mohmands but in fact are not Mohmand in origin. Origins Safi refers to one of the major Pashtun sub-tribes that are descended from Ghurghakht. Safi is a major branch of the greater Ghurghakht Pashtun tribe. The Safi are divided into three main clans: the 1-Gurbuz; the 2-Mehsud or Masawad; and the 3-Wazir or Wadair, also known as Qandahari. The exact population of this clan is not known; however, it is estimated to be around 3 million, both in Afghanistan and Pakistan (Khyber Pakhtoonkhwa, Balochistan and in different cities of Punjab). History The ancestry of the Safis reaches back to the inhabitants of the ancient kingdom of Gandhara, and they are related to the neighboring Nuristanis. Besides Pashto, some clans of the Safis speak a Kohistani Pashayi dialect. Throughout Pashtun history, the Safi have been mentioned, most famously during resistance against Aurangzeb, when a major war broke out in 1668. A rebellion was sparked by a general in the ranks of the Mughal Empire who had insulted a woman of this clan; in revenge Safi tribesmen killed the sepoy who had raped the safi woman. When news reached Aurangzeb that his sepoy was killed, he appealed to the tribe to hand over the killers, but the elders refused and challenged the Emperor. Soon Aurangzeb set out with a large force against the Safi and their allies from among other Khattak, Afridis, Shinwari, Mohmands in the command of Khushal Khan Khattak, who was at that time the tribal chief of Khattak tribe. Sources claim that Aurangzeb suffered a humiliating defeat, with a reported loss of 40,000 Mughal soldiers and only four left alive. Akhund Burkhurdar Khan, a famous freedom fighter, migrated towards Multan during his fights. His clan kept on fighting for years; today, this clan is headed by Khalid Khan Safi. Currently, the Safi tribe is well known for its resistance to the Taliban regime, and many fierce clashes have broken out between the two. Some Safi tribesmen also live in Zabul close to the Durand line led by Haji Khudai-Dad Khan Safi, in Sibi District, with two sub clans: the Meerzai; and the Kamalzai. Safi also live in Zobh District In Balochistan; they are together under Safi Ithad and their office is located at Mizan Chock in Mizan Plaza quetta. In Sibi, Safi have the lion's share of water, 8 Pao of water in Nari River.

He is most famous for Wagner's function describing unsteady lift on wings and developing the Henschel Hs 293 glide bomb. Early life Wagner attended the Austrian Naval Academy from 1914 to 1917 and served as an Ensign in the Austrian Navy during World War I. He survived the sinking of his ship after it was struck by an enemy torpedo. After the war he returned to his studies, earning a doctorate from the Technical University of Berlin when he was only 23. His doctoral thesis entitled \\"Origin of the dynamic lift of wings\\"Ernst-Heinrich Hirschel, Horst Prem, Gero Madelung, \\"Aeronautical research in Germany: from Lilienthal until today\\", Volume 147. Springer, 2004. contained the solution of one of fundamental unsteady aerodynamics problems concerned with lift force on wings that are suddenly set into motion. The result later became known as \\"Wagner's function\\". In the mid-1920s he worked for Rohrbach Metall-Flugzeugbau on new designs for flying boats. During that time he also invented the so-called Wagner beam,Based on a discovery related in the article , commonly known as the Wagner effect, also known among entomologists. a method of constructing aircraft structural components from sheet metal. Following a short stint as a professor at the Technical University of Berlin, he returned to industry at Junkers Flugzeugwerke, helping to design aircraft and aircraft engines working together with Hans von Ohain. There he played an instrumental role in the development of the first jet engines. He left Junkers following a disagreement with the management, and settled at Henschel Flugzeugwerke in Berlin. World War II research Wagner helped the computer pioneer Konrad Zuse as an intermediary concerning orders that Zuse got from the Reich Ministry of Aviation.Konrad Zuse und die ETH Z√ºrich, page 10 While at Henschel, Wagner began to study remotely controlled aircraft. In July 1940 he began work on a prototype glide bomb that could be used to attack thinly armored warships and merchant ships. This ultimately evolved into the Hs 293 guided missile, used with considerable effectiveness in late 1943 and early 1944. Several notable successes were achieved, including the first sinking of a ship by a remotely controlled weapon, the destruction of HMS Egret on 27 August 1943. Another notable success for the Hs 293 was the sinking of the transport HMT Rohna with the loss of over 1000 soldiers, sailors and crewmen. However, the Allies developed several electronic countermeasures against the Hs 293 and other radio guides weapons, such as electronic jammers. Those and the increasing Allied air superiority prevented the Hs 293 from having any significant impact in the later war years. He also designed the Henschel Hs 117 Schmetterling surface-to-air guided missile. Post-war activities After the war, Wagner was the first of many German scientists brought to America as part of Operation Paperclip, arriving at Frederick, Maryland on 18 May 1945 with seven large cases of blueprints and other technical data. Wagner and his team were moved to the Special Devices Center, a U.S.-Navy run research unit housed at the Castle Gould and Hempstead House, the former estate of Daniel and Florence Guggenheim at Sands Point, Long Island. There he supported U.S. efforts to deploy glide bombs against Japan. Wagner then moved to the new Naval Air Missile Test Center in Point Mugu, California, the centerpiece of the U.S. Navy's research into guided missiles. There he helped develop the control mechanisms for advanced missiles, several of which remain (in upgraded forms) in service today. A formerly classified FBI counterintelligence report describes his approach to his work: > An excellent German scientist of good character and who is not interested in > politics... He has given no evidence of being either pro-Nazi or pro- > Communist and is disinterested politically...

He sold this company to Curtiss-Wright in 1957 and returned to Germany to take up a position as professor of Technical Mechanics and Space Technology at the RWTH Aachen University. He continued to serve as technical advisor to several U.S. defense companies during this period. Wagner was awarded the Ludwig-Prandtl-Ring from the Deutsche Gesellschaft f√ºr Luft- und Raumfahrt (German Society for Aeronautics and Astronautics) for \\"outstanding contribution in the field of aerospace engineering\\" in 1980.

Levin was born in Chicago, and his family's name, Levinshefski, was shortened to Levin a few years before his birth. Levin joined the band when he was 16 years old, which earned him the nickname \\"The Kid\\" from Paul Revere. His addition helped establish Paul Revere and the Raiders as a premier showband in the Northwest United States. Levin's performances included synchronized dance steps, playing on his knees, standing on his amplifier and playing his guitar behind his head. After a performance at Seattle's Spanish Castle Ballroom, a young man who had watched from the front of the stage all evening approached Drake. He said that Drake's playing had inspired him and said he was a really good showman. As Drake thanked him and they shook hands, Drake asked the young man his name and he replied, \\"Jimi Hendrix.\\" The Raiders became a national teen sensation from their daily television exposure on the ABC television show Where The Action Is. It was during that time that Levin and the Raiders produced many hit records. Levin's blues-based guitar style helped drive the band's raw, edgy sound. Levin's synchronized dance steps and stage antics with fellow Raider bassist Phil \\"Fang\\" Volk earned the pair the nickname \\"The Twins\\". In 1966, Levin left the performing version of the band to fulfill his military service obligation by joining the National Guard. This enabled him to continue recording in the studio with the group during his time off. Levin's guitar work and background vocals can be heard on Raiders albums through The Spirit of '67, although his name and photo do not appear on the album cover with the band. Jim \\"Harpo\\" Valley had stepped into Levin's place on the Raiders' television and concert performances, thus Valley's photo appears with the band on that particular album. When Volk became ill and could not tour, Levin stepped in to cover for his friend on a few dates, filling in for Volk on bass. When Levin's performing replacement, Valley, decided to leave the band after a little over a year with the group, Levin again rejoined the Raiders to help them finish their spring 1967 tour. Levin was to perform with the Raiders on the Ed Sullivan Show on April 30, 1967, but band leader Paul Revere was upset at the pending departure of Volk and drummer Mike \\"Smitty\\" Smith and believed Levin to be partially responsible.Phil Volk Interview October 19, 2009 ‚Äì Grady Martin Radio Show Unknown to the group, Revere had hired a replacement guitarist, Freddy Weller, to perform with the group on the Sullivan show, leaving Levin to watch the Raiders only Ed Sullivan Show performance as a spectator.  Brotherhood  Volk and Smith left the band after the Sullivan performance and Levin re-teamed with them in Brotherhood. The band was signed to RCA, but were hindered by the members' lingering contractual obligations to Columbia Records from their Raiders work. The power trio released three albums, two under the Brotherhood name in 1968 and 1969 and a third album in 1969 called Joyride under the name Friendsound. Joyride was an experimental album that is listed on the \\"Nurse with Wound\\" list. The cover art for this album was illustrated by Edna Marie O'Dowd. Ms. O'Dowd was an emerging artist and a friend of Drake Levin during the recording of the album.  Guitars  Levin owned and played a triple-pickup Epiphone Crestwood Custom Deluxe in his early Raiders days, including the pilot episode of Where The Action Is. A few TV performances appearances of the band showed Drake playing a Mosrite six- and 12-string doubleneck that was offered to him from Mosrite, but he found it too heavy to play comfortably. He was also seen televised with a Vox Phantom VI, because of the band's Vox endorsement deal. However, he did not use them live or even in the studio as he thought they were poorly made instruments. Drake did use bandmate Phil Volk's 1960 Fender Stratocaster in the studio. In his later years, Levin played a reissue 62 Fender Stratocaster and a Fender Telecaster. However, he is most widely associated with his cherry red 1963 Epiphone Sheraton, with which he recorded his double-tracked guitar solo on \\"Just Like Me.\\" After his death, it was purchased by the Musicians Hall of Fame in Nashville, TN in early 2010, but it was severely damaged just a couple of months later in the May 2010 Nashville flood.  Later career and death  Levin subsequently performed with artists such as Ananda Shankar, Emitt Rhodes, and Lee Michaels (on the album Barrel). He also participated in reunions of various ex-members of the Raiders, and worked with his friend Phil Volk on several occasions. Drake Levin died of cancer July 4, 2009 at his home in San Francisco, with his wife Sandra at his side.RIP: Drake Levin, guitarist with Paul Revere & Raiders The Louie Report.

Use  Electronic document and records management is used by organizations to manage documents and records throughout the document life-cycle, from creation to destruction. Typically, systems consider a document or file to be a work-in- progress until it has undergone review, approval, lock-down, and (potentially) publication, where it will wait to be used. The version of the form that is saved containing user content will become a formal record within the organization. Once a document achieves the status of a record, the organization may apply best-practice or legally enforced retention policies which state how the second half of the record life-cycle will progress. This typically involves retention (and protection from change), until some events occur which relate to the record and which trigger the final disposition schedule to apply to the record. Eventually, typically at a set time after these events, the record undergoes destruction.  EDRMS software  A range of software vendors offer these systems at an enterprise level (i.e. targeted at managing all documents and records within an enterprise). These vendors have historically provided electronic document management systems and have acquired smaller records management system companies.

Early life  As a child in Kabul, Sayed Jalal was known in Afghanistan and abroad for his prodigious skills in mathematics. At the age of 9, Jalal came to the United States where he interviewed with several top American colleges, including Columbia University. However, Jalal was not able to attend college in the U.S., because Hafizullah Amin demanded his return to Afghanistan and then forced to him and his father to move to Russia. There, Jalal attended Moscow University where he was the youngest student ever, but he did not earn any degrees. After leaving Russia, Jalal and his father took refuge in Pakistan before finally immigrating to Saudi Arabia.  Political background  Sayed Jalal has negotiated ceasefires and hostage releases between The Northern Alliance, The Taliban, and Iran. He operates within a network of influence that once included Benazir Bhutto. Jalal claims to campaign on a platform that rejects the notion that Afghan politics must be tribal and divisive. He claims to seek an end to warlord politics and is a strong critic of the government of Hamid Karzai, which he views as weak, incompetent, and corrupt. The current political atmosphere of Afghanistan combined with Jalal's message of unity and hope has led some Afghans to compare him to Barack Obama. A concern in the elections was that Jalal lacked political experience and international support.

Miranda fantasizes about the speech she plans to make when, one day in their future, she will give this tiny infant away at her wedding. Tragically, when Quincey is 3, Miranda is killed in a car accident and Rawdon is left alone, unmoored, to continue life without the love of his life. Staying as strong as he can Rawdon takes Quincey to the roof of a skyscraper and explains that Mommy is now an angel. It is up here that for the first time they see a vision of Miranda as an angel. Rawdon continues to see visions of her. Initially these visions help him‚Äîat home she gives him advice about parenting; in Portugal she softens his hardness; when he hides in the closet to isolate himself she snaps some sense into him and insists that Rawdon keep her mother, father and brother‚ÄîQuincey's Grandparents (Jerry Hardin, Diane Hardin) and Uncle Jack (Don Michael Paul) ‚Äì firmly in Quincey's life. Rawdon explains these visions to his therapist Paula (Brenda Strong) as she helps him with the long grieving process and over a period of years, with Quincey growing before our eyes, Rawdon tries to move on with his life. He tries to date other women. Disastrously. He falls instantly in love with Sam (Amy Pietz) who ends up becoming his good friend and a surrogate Aunt to Quincey. He dates a woman named Kimberly (Joely Fisher) who Quincey wisely suggests is far better suited to her Uncle Jack. And she is right. When Jack and Kimberly get married, Rawdon is their best man. All the while Miranda's metaphysical presence is with him. He goes from needing her, to blaming her, to being angry at her. But for a long, long time he won't let her go away. Part of him wants her to stay alive in his imagination forever and gradually this presence that helped him initially becomes an impediment to his moving on with life. In contrast to her Dad's stagnation, Quincey is growing up fast (Allison Mack as a 20-year-old), and in no time she is dating, stealing cars, trying to set her Dad up with her best friend's divorced Moms, going off to University and falling in love with a Frenchman named Philippe. It is not until Rawdon finally plucks up the courage to ask out somebody who might just be right for him that he finally, tearfully, asks Miranda to leave him. This is ultimately a coming of age story. We watch Quincey literally come of age whilst her father, emotionally, comes of age. He eventually gives up the now stultifying memory of his dead wife and arrives at a new beginning. The end of this story is also the beginning of another where Rawdon, surrounded by the people he loves‚Äîbut without Miranda‚Äîfinds himself giving Quincey away at her wedding to Philippe. And here he makes the speech that Miranda made in bed with him and Quincey so many years before.

National People's Action National People's Action was a federation of 29 grassroots organizations in 18 states working together for racial and economic justice. Headquartered in Chicago, the organization was founded in 1972 by Austin neighborhood activist Gale Cincotta and professional organizer Shel Trapp. History Founded in 1972 by Cincotta and Trapp, the organization pushed for federal housing legislation including the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act of 1975, the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977, and the National Affordable Housing Act of 1990. For many years, Cincotta and Trapp offered training to the group's affiliates through their National Training and Information Center. The organization continued after the retirement of Trapp and the death of Cincotta in 2001, but refocused its efforts on organizing, issue campaigning, and direct action, de-emphasizing the training programs once offered through NTIC.

The events, dubbed \\"Showdown In America\\", \\"called for the end of corporate lobbying and too-big-to-fail financial institutions\\". According to the group, it existed as a network to create a society in which \\"racial and economic justice are realized in all aspects of society, resulting in more equity in work, housing, health, education, finance, and other systems central to people's well-being\\". The organization pushed for stricter regulations on lending and financial institutions, including increased taxes.

In August 2018, People's Action sponsored 50 community cookouts across the country to emphasize the value of families. Criticism The organization was notable for aggressive tactics, especially protests against the residences of their opponents. Nina Easton of Fortune magazine wrote in her column about one such protest, at the home of her neighbor, a lawyer for Bank of America. In association with the Service Employees International Union, demonstrators trespassed on the executive's property, protesting while only his son was home, Easton said.

Concrete cast of books on library shelves turned inside out. Casting is a manufacturing process in which a liquid material is usually poured into a mold, which contains a hollow cavity of the desired shape, and then allowed to solidify. The solidified part is also known as a casting, which is ejected or broken out of the mold to complete the process. Casting materials are usually metals or various time setting materials that cure after mixing two or more components together; examples are epoxy, concrete, plaster and clay. Casting is most often used for making complex shapes that would be otherwise difficult or uneconomical to make by other methods. Heavy equipment like machine tool beds, ships' propellers, etc. can be cast easily in the required size, rather than fabricating by joining several small pieces. Casting is a 7,000-year-old process. The oldest surviving casting is a copper frog from 3200 BC. History Dancing girl of Mohenjo-daro Throughout history, metal casting has been used to make tools, weapons, and religious objects. Metal casting history and development can be traced back to Southern Asia (China, India, Pakistan, etc). Southern Asia traditions and religions relied heavily on statue and relic castings. These items were frequently made from a copper alloy laced with lead. Since the beginning of metallurgy the majority of castings were simple one to two piece molds fashioned from either stone or ceramics. However, there is evidence of lost wax castings in numerous ancient civilizations. Early civilizations discovered lead aided in the fluidity of molten copper, allowing them to cast more intricate designs. For example, the dancing girl of Mohenjo-daro is a copper alloy casting that most likely utilizes the lost wax technique. Lost wax casting can be dated back to 4000 BC or the Chalcolithic period. One of the oldest studied examples of this technique is a 6,000-year old amulet from Indus valley civilization.Thoury, M.; et al. (2016). \\"High spatial dynamics-photoluminescence imaging reveals the metallurgy of the earliest lost-wax cast object\\". Nature Communications. 7. doi:10.1038/ncomms13356. India is attributed as one of the first civilizations to use casting methods to mass produce coins. Around the middle of the first millennium BC (1000 BC - 1 BC), coins used were made from silver but as the millennium progressed the coins shifted to a cast copper alloy. New technology was developed to mass produce the new copper coins. Introduced was a multi piece stackable coin template mold. Multiple molds were placed on top of one another into a clay cylinder so molten metal could be poured down the center, filling and solidifying in the open spaces. This process allowed one hundred coins to be produced simultaneously. In the Middle East and West Africa the lost wax technique was used very early in their metallurgy traditions while China adopted it much later. In Western Europe lost wax techniques are considered to have been hardly used especially in comparison to that of the Indus valley civilization. There were no pieces of lost wax found in the capital of Anyang during the Shane dynasty (1600-1040 BC) while a large amount (100,000 pieces) of piece-mould fragments were found. This led to the conclusion that lost wax was not performed in the capital during this dynasty. However, the discovery of a mask made using the investment moulding dated at around 1300 BC indicated that the lost wax technique may have influenced other regions in China. Historians debate the origin of the development of the cannon but most evidence points to Turkey and Central Asia in the 18th and 19th century. The casting process of a cannon is a bit more complex with the use of a clay core, a template which has clay moulded around it and then broken out followed by an assembly in a casting pit that involves binding the casting with iron bands. Types Metal In metalworking, metal is heated until it becomes liquid and is then poured into a mold. The mold is a hollow cavity that includes the desired shape, but the mold also includes runners and risers that enable the metal to fill the mold. The mold and the metal are then cooled until the metal solidifies. The solidified part (the casting) is then recovered from the mold. Subsequent operations remove excess material caused by the casting process (such as the runners and risers). Plaster, concrete, or plastic resin Plaster and other chemical curing materials such as concrete and plastic resin may be cast using single-use waste molds as noted above, multiple-use 'piece' molds, or molds made of small rigid pieces or of flexible material such as latex rubber (which is in turn supported by an exterior mold). When casting plaster or concrete, the material surface is flat and lacks transparency. Often topical treatments are applied to the surface. For example, painting and etching can be used in a way that give the appearance of metal or stone. Alternatively, the material is altered in its initial casting process and may contain colored sand so as to give an appearance of stone. By casting concrete, rather than plaster, it is possible to create sculptures, fountains, or seating for outdoor use. A simulation of high-quality marble may be made using certain chemically-set plastic resins (for example epoxy or polyester which are thermosetting polymers) with powdered stone added for coloration, often with multiple colors worked in. The latter is a common means of making washstands, washstand tops and shower stalls, with the skilled working of multiple colors resulting in simulated staining patterns as is often found in natural marble or travertine. Fettling Raw castings often contain irregularities caused by seams and imperfections in the molds, as well as access ports for pouring material into the molds. The process of cutting, grinding, shaving or sanding away these unwanted bits is called \\"fettling\\". In modern times robotic processes have been developed to perform some of the more repetitive parts of the fettling process, but historically fettlers carried out this arduous work manually, and often in conditions dangerous to their health. Fettling can add significantly to the cost of the resulting product, and designers of molds seek to minimize it through the shape of the mold, the material being cast, and sometimes by including decorative elements. Casting process simulation Casting process simulation uses numerical methods to calculate cast component quality considering mold filling, solidification and cooling, and provides a quantitative prediction of casting mechanical properties, thermal stresses and distortion. Simulation accurately describes a cast component's quality up- front before production starts. The casting rigging can be designed with respect to the required component properties. This has benefits beyond a reduction in pre-production sampling, as the precise layout of the complete casting system also leads to energy, material, and tooling savings. The software supports the user in component design, the determination of melting practice and casting methoding through to pattern and mold making, heat treatment, and finishing. This saves costs along the entire casting manufacturing route. Casting process simulation was initially developed at universities starting from the early '70s, mainly in Europe and in the U.S., and is regarded as the most important innovation in casting technology over the last 50 years. Since the late '80s, commercial programs (such as AutoCAST and MAGMA) are available which make it possible for foundries to gain new insight into what is happening inside the mold or die during the casting process.

However, in 2002, a team of paleontologists in Mexico discovered the remains of a pliosaur nicknamed as \\"Monster of Aramberri\\", which is also estimated at in length. This species is, however, claimed to be a juvenile and has been attacked by a larger pliosaur. Some media sources claimed that Monster of Aramberri was a Liopleurodon but its species is unconfirmed thus far.

Kriegsmarine). She was named for the 19th century Austrian Field Marshal Joseph Radetzky von Radetz. Radetzky and her sisters, and , were the last pre-dreadnoughts built by the Austro-Hungarian Navy‚Äîthey were followed by the larger and significantly more powerful dreadnoughts. Radetzky was built by the shipbuilding company Stabilimento Tecnico in Trieste and commissioned into the fleet on 15 January 1911. The ship conducted training cruises in the Mediterranean before the outbreak of World War I in mid-1914. During the war, Radetzky operated largely as part of a fleet in being alongside the rest of the Austro-Hungarian Navy; in doing so, the ships tied down considerable naval forces from the Triple Entente. Radetzky did participate in some offensive operations, primarily shore bombardments in the Adriatic Sea against French, Montenegrin, and Italian targets. Towards the end of 1918, with the war going against the Austrians, Radetzky was prepared to be transferred to the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs. On 10 November 1918 ‚Äî six days after the Austrian armistice ‚Äî Yugoslav navy officers sailed the battleship out of Pola and surrendered it to a squadron of American submarine chasers. Under the terms of the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye, the transfer was not recognized; instead, Radetzky was given to Italy and broken up for scrap.  Construction  alt= Illustration of SMS Radetzky; the ship carried two large gun turrets on either end and four smaller turrets arranged around two tall smoke stacks in the center. Radetzky was built at the Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino dockyard in Trieste, the same place where her sister ships were built. She was the second ship of her class to be constructed and her kneel was laid down on 26 November 1907. The teak used on Radetzkys deck was the only material Austria-Hungary had to purchase abroad to build the ship. Radetzky was launched from the slipway on 3 July 1909, and commissioned into the Austro-Hungarian navy on 15 January 1911 and had a crew of 880 to 890 officers and men. Radetzky was 138.8 m (455 ft 4 in) long, and had a beam of 24.6 m (80 ft 8 in) and a draft of 8.1 m (26 ft 9 in). She displaced normally, and up to with a full combat load. The ship was powered by two-shaft four-cylinder vertical triple expansion engines rated at 19,800 indicated horsepower and a top speed of . She had a maximum range of at a cruising speed of . The ship's primary armament consisted of four 30.5 cm (12 in) 45-caliber guns in two twin gun turrets. This was augmented by a heavy secondary battery of eight 24 cm (9.4 in) guns in four wing turrets. The tertiary battery consisted of twenty 10 cm L/50 guns in casemated single mounts, two L/18 landing guns, four L/44 and one 47 mm L/33 quick-firing guns. After 1916-17 refits four ≈†koda 7 cm K16 anti-aircraft guns were installed. Three 45 cm (17.7 in) torpedo tubes were also carried, two on the beams and one in the stern.  Service history   Pre-war  One of Radetzkys first duties was to attend the British Coronation Review for King George V in Spithead in June 1911. Following her return to the Austro-Hungarian fleet, she conducted several training cruises in the eastern Mediterranean with her two sisters in 1912. Later that year, Radetzky and her sisters, under the command of Vice Admiral Maximilian Njegovan, took part in an international fleet demonstration in the Ionian Sea to protest the Balkan Wars. Among the ships from other navies were the British pre-dreadnought , the Italian pre- dreadnought , the French armored cruiser , and the German light cruiser . The combined flotilla, under the command of British Admiral Cecil Burney, proceeded to blockade the Montenegrin coast to prevent Serbian reinforcements from supporting the siege at Scutari. During the operation, the first seaplanes to be used in combat were operated from Radetzky and her two sisters. This proved unsatisfactory, however, because the ships lacked cranes with which to lift the planes onto the deck, as well as the fact that the deck was too small to accommodate the aircraft. As a result of the pressure from the international blockade, Serbia withdrew its army from Scutari, which was then occupied by a joint Allied ground force. By 1913, the new dreadnoughts of the were coming into active service, and so Radetzky and her sisters were shifted from the 1st Division to the 2nd Division of the 1st Battle Squadron.  World War I  At the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, the German battlecruisers and Breslau were coaling in Messina; British warships had begun to assemble outside the port in an attempt to trap the German ships. The German navy called upon its Austro-Hungarian allies to come to their aid; the Austro-Hungarian high command was initially hesitant, as they wished to avoid initiating hostilities with the British. However, when the Germans made clear they wanted the Austro-Hungarian fleet to steam only as far as Brindisi, the high command relented and sent the portion of the fleet that had by that time been mobilized, which included Radetzky, on the operation. The fleet sailed to the designated latitude, under strict orders to only actively assist the German ships while they were in Austro-Hungarian waters. After the German ships successfully broke out into the Mediterranean, the Austro-Hungarian fleet returned to port. In October 1914, the French army established artillery batteries on Mount Lovƒçen to support the Army of Montenegro against the Austrian army at Cattaro. By the time they were operational, on 15 October, the Austro-Hungarians were ready with the pre-dreadnoughts of the . However, their 24 cm guns were insufficient to dislodge the French artillery batteries, and so Radetzky was sent to assist them. On 21 October, the ship arrived, and the gunfire from her 30.5 cm guns forced the French to abandon the position. On 23 May 1915, between two and four hours after the Italian declaration of war reached the main Austro-Hungarian naval base at Pola, Radetzky and the rest of the fleet departed to bombard the Italian and Montenegrin coast. Their focus was on the important naval base at Ancona, and later the coast of Montenegro. The bombardment of Montenegro was part of the larger Austro- Hungarian campaign against the Kingdoms of Montenegro and Serbia, who were members of the Entente, during the first half of 1915. During the attack on Ancona and the surrounding coastline, Radetzky, as well as the cruisers and , and the destroyers , , and traveled south to cover the ships attacking Ancona. Upon finding no enemy ships in the region, the group bombarded the Termiti Islands, Viests, Manfredonia, and Barletta. After leaving the Gulf of Manfredonia Radetzky and the rest of the ships accompanying her sighted the first enemy ships of the day, two Italian destroyers. During the encounter, one Italian destroyer managed to escape the Austrian ships but the other, , was severely damaged. Only when a larger Italian force appeared did Radetzky and her accompanying ships abandon their attempts to capture the damaged destroyer. Aside from the encounter with Turbine, Radetzky managed to destroy a railroad bridge near the town of Fermo, severely hampering the movement of troops and supplies in the region. Sixty-three Italian civilians and military personnel were killed in the bombardment. By the time Italian ships from Taranto and Brindisi arrived on the scene, the Austro-Hungarians were safely back in Pola. The attack on Ancona was an immense success, and the Austro- Hungarian ships were largely unopposed during the entire operation. The objective of the bombardment was to delay the Italian Army from deploying its forces along the border with Austria-Hungary by destroying critical transportation systems. The surprise attack on Ancona succeeded in delaying the Italian deployment to the Alps for two weeks. This delay gave Austria- Hungary valuable time to strengthen its Italian border and re-deploy some of its troops from the Eastern and Balkan fronts. Aside from the attack on Ancona, the Austro-Hungarian battleships were confined to Pola for the duration of the war. Their operations were limited by Admiral Anton Haus, the commander of the Austro-Hungarian Navy, who believed that he would need to husband his ships to counter any Italian attempt to seize the Dalmatian coast. Since coal was diverted to the newer Tegetthoff-class battleships, the remainder of the war saw Radetzky and the rest of the Austro-Hungarian Navy acting as a fleet in being. This resulted in the Allied blockade of the Otranto Strait. With his fleet blockaded in the Adriatic Sea, and facing a shortage of coal, Haus attempted to use mines and submarines, rather than battleships, to reduce the numerical superiority of the Allied navies.  End of the war  By October 1918, Austria prepared to transfer her entire fleet to the newly created State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs (later to become the Kingdom of Yugoslavia) in order to keep it out of Italian hands. On 10 November 1918, one day before the Allied Armistice with Germany, and six days after the Austrians and Italians agreed to the Armistice of Villa Giusti, Yugoslav officers with scratch crews sailed Radetzky and Zr√≠nyi out of Pola. Once outside Pola, the ships spotted heavy units of the Italian fleet; the two battleships hoisted American flags and sailed south to escape. A squadron of US Navy submarine chasers operating off the city of Spalato accepted the surrender of Radetzky and Zr√≠nyi. However, under the subsequent peace treaty, the Allied powers ignored the transfer of the Austro-Hungarian ships to the Yugoslav navy which had already taken place; instead, the ships were ceded to Italy. Radetzky was broken up in Italy between 1920 and 1921.

A Pashtun nationalist from Kakar tribe of Kandahar, Afghanistan, he began as a young teacher who made his way up to become a writer, scholar, politician and Dean of Faculty of Literature at Kabul University. He is the author of over 100 books but is best known for editing Pata Khazana, an old Pashto language manuscript that he claimed to have discovered in 1944; the academic community, however, does not unanimously agree upon its genuineness.Lucia Serena Loi: Il tesoro nascosto degli Afghani. Il Cavaliere azzurro, Bologna 1987, p. 33  Biography  Habibi was born in Kandahar city of Afghanistan in 1910, in a Pashtun family of scholars of Kakar tribe. He was the great grandson of Allamah Habibullah, the eminent scholar known as \\"Kandahari intellectual\\" who authored many books. Habibi's father died at an early age and he grew up studying in the mosques of Kandahar, and in 1920 he was admitted to the primary school of Shalimar. Being good at his studies, he received his diploma at the age of 15 and began working as a teacher in the primary schools of Kandahar. In 1927 he was appointed as the deputy editor of Tulo Afghan weekly newspaper in Kandahar and 3 years later became the editor of the newspaper. In 1950s, he was forced to exile by living in Peshawar, Pakistan, because of his opposition to Afghan Prime Minister Shah Mahmud Khan. While in exile, he published a journal called Azad Afghanistan (Free Afghanistan). He was permitted to return to Afghanistan in 1961 to become professor in the faculty of literature of Kabul University. In 1966, he was appointed president of Afghan Historical Society and he published a number of books on Afghan history. As an academic, Habibi worked diligently throughout his life. He is the author of 115 books and over 500 papers and articles on the literature, history, philosophy, linguistics, poetics and the culture of the people of Afghanistan. Several of his books have been translated to English, Arabic, German and other foreign languages. Abdul Hai Habibi died on 9 May 1984, in Kabul, during the Soviet‚ÄìAfghan War.

Criticism Pata Khazana, one of Habibi's major works, has been questioned by several prominent scholars for lacking strong evidence. British Iranologist, David Neil MacKenzie, concludes from the anachronisms that the document was fabricated only shortly before its claimed discovery in 1944. MacKenzie's central argument refers to the use of the modern Pashto letters Dze (⁄Å ) and Nur (⁄º ) throughout the script. These letters were only introduced into the Pashto alphabet in 1936 when the Afghan government reformed the Pashto orthography. The two letters have never been found simultaneously in any genuine manuscript before 1935.David Neil MacKenzie: David N. Mackenzie: The Development of the Pashto Script.

Its mission statement declares that it seeks to advance the science, education, and practice of forestry; to enhance the competency of its members; to establish professional excellence; and, to use the knowledge, skills and conservation ethic of the profession to ensure the continued health and use of forest ecosystems and the present and future availability of forest resources to benefit society. Its headquarters are located in Bethesda, Maryland. Official Logo History The Society of American Foresters was founded on November 30, 1900 by Gifford Pinchot and seven colleagues in the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Division of Forestry.https://foresthistory.org/november-19-1900-society-of-american- foresters-founded/Pinchot, G. 1947. Breaking new ground. New York, NY:Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, Inc. 510 p. See p. 150-151 for his description of founding the Society of American Foresters. Membership and Structure , SAF had 11,000 members.The Forestry Source Vol 23(1):10 SAF is structured around two different networks--a geographic network and a network of scientific disciplines. The geographic network has 31 state societies, further subdivided into divisions and chapters.https://www.eforester.org/Main/Community/StateSocieties.aspx Student chapters exist at many forestry schools. The scientific disciplinary network has 20 working groups.https://www.eforester.org/Main/Community/Join_a_Working_Group/Main/About/Working_Groups.aspx Each working group is a self-selected cluster of SAF members interested in a particular area of science. Education Accreditation The SAF is active in improving the quality of postsecondary forestry education in the United States, however, SAF was denied recognition by the Council for Higher Education Accreditation as an accrediting organization in 2015, after being recognized since 2001 for academic degree programs in professional forestry, both at a Bachelor's and Master's level. Accreditation is provided for selected programs, not institutions or academic departments. SAF maintains a list of its accredited programs in forestry, urban forestry, natural resources and ecosystem management, and forest technology on their website. It also publishes an annual college guide to help secondary school students and guidance counselors become better informed about career opportunities in forestry and natural resources. Continuing Education SAF offers a Continuing Forestry Education (CFE) program and a Certified Forester credential program. Some states with licensing or registration statutes and regulations for professional foresters require continuing education credits to renew a license or registration. For example, Maine https://www.maine.gov/pfr/professionallicensing/professions/foresters/education.html and Alabama http://asbrf.alabama.gov/continuingeducation.asp accept SAF's CFE credits. Publications The SAF produces two periodic journals, published by Oxford University Press: the Journal of Forestryacademic.oup.com/jof and Forest Science.academic.oup.com/forestscience Past volumes and issues of both journals are available through their respective Oxford University Press websites. Journal of Forestry, in print since 1902, is a peer-reviewed journal published bimonthly: January, March, May, July, September, and November. . The current Editor-in-Chief is Dr. Keith A. Blatner. Impact factors for Journal of Forestry can be found on the Oxford University Press website.https://academic.oup.com/jof/pages/About Forest Science, in print since 1955, is a peer-reviewed scientific journal published bimonthly: February, April, June, August, October, and December. . The current Editor-in- Chief is Dr. Scott Roberts. Impact factors for Forest Science can be found on the Oxford University Press website.https://academic.oup.com/forestscience/pages/About From 1977 to 2013, SAF published three regional journals: the Southern Journal of Applied Forestry; the Northern Journal of Applied Forestry; and the Western Journal of Applied Forestry. In 2013, the three regional journals were absorbed into the applied research section of Forest Science.https://academic.oup.com/njaf/article/30/3/100/4757027 Issues are archived online by Oxford University Presshttps://academic.oup.com/sjaf/issuehttps://academic.oup.com/njaf/issuehttps://academic.oup.com/wjaf/issue SAF also publishes a variety of technical publications, such as the Dictionary of Forestry.Deal, R.(ed). 2019. Dictionary of forestry. 2nd ed. Bethesda, MD:Society of American Foresters. 208 p. The Forestry Source, , is a monthly newspaper for SAF members that reports on current events. The E-Forester is an electronic newsletter emailed to SAF members weekly. Conventions and Meetings State societies of SAF hold annual or semi-annual meetings to advance networking among members, review recent scientific findings, conduct continuing forestry education, and plan local outreach activities. Each year, SAF also holds a national convention--open to both non-members and members. Each convention has a specific theme, plenary sessions, and a wide variety of concurrent technical sessions, each a cluster of scientific papers focused on a specific topic. The concurrent sessions span the breadth and diversity of the ecological, economic, and social sciences related to forests. The location of the national convention rotates around the United States to make it easier for SAF members from different parts of the country to attend. Proceedings are published in a subsequent issue of the Journal of Forestry. For example, proceedings from the October 3‚Äì7, 2018 convention in Portland, OR were published in the January 2019 issue.https://academic.oup.com/jof/article/117/1/89/5285017 See also *Forestry *List of forestry universities and colleges *Journal of Forestry *Xi Sigma Pi Forestry Honors Society References External links *Official Website, Society of American Foresters * Accredited and Candidate Degree Programs in Forestry, Urban Forestry, and Natural Resources and Ecosystem Management * Position Statements of the Society of American Foresters Category:Forestry societies Category:Professional associations based in the United States ","title":"Society of American Foresters"},{"id":"21501323","text":"William Paul Modibo (born 18 May 1979) is a Cameroonian professional footballer who plays for G.D.

Although he played only 16 Major League Baseball games in his career, for the 1953 Detroit Tigers, Carswell was one of the top minor league hitters of the post-World War II era. Born in Palestine, Texas, Carswell attended Rice University. He threw and batted right-handed, stood tall and weighed . He signed with the Tigers in 1941, and batted .338 in 275 at bats for the Jamestown Falcons of the Class D PONY League. But the U.S. entered World War II after that season, and Carswell lost four years while serving in the United States Marine Corps. By the time he returned to pick up his baseball career, he was 26 years old and his prospects for MLB stardom had been dimmed. After spending the 1946 season with the Dallas Rebels of the Double-A Texas League, Carswell was demoted to lower minor leagues for much of 1947‚Äì50, where he put up prodigious batting numbers. With the 1947 Paris Red Peppers of the Class B Big State League, Carswell earned All-Star third baseman honors, batting .364 with 36 home runs and 145 runs batted in. Two years later, with the Texarkana Bears of the same circuit, Carswell led the league in RBIs (145) and batting average (.386). But Carswell's slugging was not confined to the mid-minor leagues. The parent Tigers promoted him, at age 31, to the Buffalo Bisons of the Triple-A International League in 1951, and Carswell batted .302. In 1952, he led the International League in homers (30) and batting average (.344). Then in 1953 he once again batted over .300 for Buffalo and, at 33, had his \\"cup of coffee\\" in the American League for the Tigers. In six weeks, Carswell appeared in 16 games and batted 15 times with four hits, all singles, and two RBIs for a .267 batting mark. He then returned to Buffalo to hit over .300 for the remainder of 1953 and all of 1954. All told, Carswell played 13 minor league seasons, compiled a lifetime batting average of .337 and hit 209 home runs. His managing career began in early 1957 when, still an active player, he was interim manager of the Portland Beavers of the Pacific Coast League after the sudden death from a perforated ulcer of skipper Bill Sweeney on April 18. The following season, he rejoined the Detroit farm system as a full-time manager, working his way up from Class D to Triple-A (including assignments with the Syracuse Chiefs and the Toledo Mud Hens) over the next 13 years (1958‚Äì70). Carswell died at age 78 in Houston, Texas. He was named to the International League Hall of Fame in 2010.

Story Nishihama Junior High School is haunted by the legend of Sayoko. Every three years a student is chosen to play the role of Sayoko by his or her predecessor. Sayoko has three missions to accomplish. If they are completed it is to the advantage of the school. If not, the school is doomed... Shu has been chosen to be Sayoko. Disbelieving the legend, Shu lets his pal Rei assume the role. But, when the new term begins, one of the tasks has already been completed. By whom? This is just the prelude to a string of spooky happenings. \\"Sayoko is Back\\" is no ordinary horror story. The youngsters explore the unknown while caught up in the drama of adolescence.

Serialities take the form of labels which are either imposed onto persons or voluntarily adopted by them. A seriality can be \\"unbound\\" and self- identified, for example workers, patriots, or anarchists, or \\"bound\\" and identified by authority census and elections, such as Asian-Americans or Tutsis. Benedict Anderson describes bound seriality as an insidious power grab by political authority. When a state gains an interest in power they may serialize their citizens in order to identify them, for example, forcing citizens to adopt a family name or (more recently) a national identification number. The term is also used in gender studies. See also *patronymic *matronymic *family name References * Benedict Anderson. The Spectre of Comparisons. 1998.

Evolutionary thought, the recognition that species change over time and the perceived understanding of how such processes work, has roots in antiquity‚Äîin the ideas of the ancient Greeks, Romans, and Chinese as well as in medieval Islamic science. With the beginnings of modern biological taxonomy in the late 17th century, two opposed ideas influenced Western biological thinking: essentialism, the belief that every species has essential characteristics that are unalterable, a concept which had developed from medieval Aristotelian metaphysics, and that fit well with natural theology; and the development of the new anti-Aristotelian approach to modern science: as the Enlightenment progressed, evolutionary cosmology and the mechanical philosophy spread from the physical sciences to natural history. Naturalists began to focus on the variability of species; the emergence of paleontology with the concept of extinction further undermined static views of nature. In the early 19th century Jean-Baptiste Lamarck (1744‚Äì1829) proposed his theory of the transmutation of species, the first fully formed theory of evolution. In 1858 Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace published a new evolutionary theory, explained in detail in Darwin's On the Origin of Species (1859). Unlike Lamarck, Darwin proposed common descent and a branching tree of life, meaning that two very different species could share a common ancestor. Darwin based his theory on the idea of natural selection: it synthesized a broad range of evidence from animal husbandry, biogeography, geology, morphology, and embryology. Debate over Darwin's work led to the rapid acceptance of the general concept of evolution, but the specific mechanism he proposed, natural selection, was not widely accepted until it was revived by developments in biology that occurred during the 1920s through the 1940s. Before that time most biologists regarded other factors as responsible for evolution. Alternatives to natural selection suggested during \\"the eclipse of Darwinism\\" (c. 1880 to 1920) included inheritance of acquired characteristics (neo-Lamarckism), an innate drive for change (orthogenesis), and sudden large mutations (saltationism). Mendelian genetics, a series of 19th-century experiments with pea plant variations rediscovered in 1900, was integrated with natural selection by Ronald Fisher, J. B. S. Haldane, and Sewall Wright during the 1910s to 1930s, and resulted in the founding of the new discipline of population genetics. During the 1930s and 1940s population genetics became integrated with other biological fields, resulting in a widely applicable theory of evolution that encompassed much of biology‚Äîthe modern synthesis. Following the establishment of evolutionary biology, studies of mutation and genetic diversity in natural populations, combined with biogeography and systematics, led to sophisticated mathematical and causal models of evolution. Paleontology and comparative anatomy allowed more detailed reconstructions of the evolutionary history of life. After the rise of molecular genetics in the 1950s, the field of molecular evolution developed, based on protein sequences and immunological tests, and later incorporating RNA and DNA studies. The gene-centered view of evolution rose to prominence in the 1960s, followed by the neutral theory of molecular evolution, sparking debates over adaptationism, the unit of selection, and the relative importance of genetic drift versus natural selection as causes of evolution. In the late 20th- century, DNA sequencing led to molecular phylogenetics and the reorganization of the tree of life into the three-domain system by Carl Woese. In addition, the newly recognized factors of symbiogenesis and horizontal gene transfer introduced yet more complexity into evolutionary theory. Discoveries in evolutionary biology have made a significant impact not just within the traditional branches of biology, but also in other academic disciplines (for example: anthropology and psychology) and on society at large. and Antiquity Greeks Anaximander of Miletus argued that humans originated from fish. Proposals that one type of animal, even humans, could descend from other types of animals, are known to go back to the first pre- Socratic Greek philosophers. Anaximander of Miletus (c. 610‚Äî546 BC) proposed that the first animals lived in water, during a wet phase of the Earth's past, and that the first land-dwelling ancestors of mankind must have been born in water, and only spent part of their life on land. He also argued that the first human of the form known today must have been the child of a different type of animal (probably a fish), because man needs prolonged nursing to live. In the late nineteenth century, Anaximander was hailed as the \\"first Darwinist\\", but this characterization is no longer commonly agreed. Anaximander's hypothesis could be considered \\"evolution\\" in a sense, although not a Darwinian one. Empedocles (c. 490‚Äî430 BC), argued that what we call birth and death in animals are just the mingling and separations of elements which cause the countless \\"tribes of mortal things.\\" Specifically, the first animals and plants were like disjointed parts of the ones we see today, some of which survived by joining in different combinations, and then intermixing during the development of the embryo, and where \\"everything turned out as it would have if it were on purpose, there the creatures survived, being accidentally compounded in a suitable way.\\" Other philosophers who became more influential at that time, including Plato (c. 428/427‚Äî348/347 BC), Aristotle (384‚Äî322 BC), and members of the Stoic school of philosophy, believed that the types of all things, not only living things, were fixed by divine design. Plato (left) and Aristotle (right), a detail from The School of Athens (1509‚Äî1511) by Raphael Plato was called by biologist Ernst Mayr \\"the great antihero of evolutionism,\\" because he promoted belief in essentialism, which is also referred to as the theory of Forms. This theory holds that each natural type of object in the observed world is an imperfect manifestation of the ideal, form or \\"species\\" which defines that type. In his Timaeus for example, Plato has a character tell a story that the Demiurge created the cosmos and everything in it because, being good, and hence, \\"... free from jealousy, He desired that all things should be as like Himself as they could be.\\" The creator created all conceivable forms of life, since \\"... without them the universe will be incomplete, for it will not contain every kind of animal which it ought to contain, if it is to be perfect.\\" This \\"principle of plenitude\\"‚Äîthe idea that all potential forms of life are essential to a perfect creation‚Äîgreatly influenced Christian thought. However some historians of science have questioned how much influence Plato's essentialism had on natural philosophy by stating that many philosophers after Plato believed that species might be capable of transformation and that the idea that biologic species were fixed and possessed unchangeable essential characteristics did not become important until the beginning of biological taxonomy in the 17th and 18th centuries. Aristotle, the most influential of the Greek philosophers in Europe, was a student of Plato and is also the earliest natural historian whose work has been preserved in any real detail. His writings on biology resulted from his research into natural history on and around the island of Lesbos, and have survived in the form of four books, usually known by their Latin names, De anima (On the Soul), Historia animalium (History of Animals), De generatione animalium (Generation of Animals), and De partibus animalium (On the Parts of Animals). Aristotle's works contain accurate observations, fitted into his own theories of the body's mechanisms. However, for Charles Singer, \\"Nothing is more remarkable than [Aristotle's] efforts to [exhibit] the relationships of living things as a scala naturae.\\" This scala naturae, described in Historia animalium, classified organisms in relation to a hierarchical but static \\"Ladder of Life\\" or \\"great chain of being,\\" placing them according to their complexity of structure and function, with organisms that showed greater vitality and ability to move described as \\"higher organisms.\\" Aristotle believed that features of living organisms showed clearly that they had what he called a final cause, that is to say that their form suited their function. He explicitly rejected the view of Empedocles that living creatures might have originated by chance. Other Greek philosophers, such as Zeno of Citium (334‚Äî262 BC) the founder of the Stoic school of philosophy, agreed with Aristotle and other earlier philosophers that nature showed clear evidence of being designed for a purpose; this view is known as teleology. The Roman Stoic philosopher Cicero (106‚Äî43 BC) wrote that Zeno was known to have held the view, central to Stoic physics, that nature is primarily \\"directed and concentrated...to secure for the world...the structure best fitted for survival.\\" Chinese Ancient Chinese thinkers such as Zhuang Zhou (c. 369‚Äî286 BC), a Taoist philosopher, expressed ideas on changing biological species. According to Joseph Needham, Taoism explicitly denies the fixity of biological species and Taoist philosophers speculated that species had developed differing attributes in response to differing environments. Taoism regards humans, nature and the heavens as existing in a state of \\"constant transformation\\" known as the Tao, in contrast with the more static view of nature typical of Western thought. \\"Notes for a lecture delivered to the Royal Asiatic Society, Shanghai on January 8, 2008\\" Roman Empire Lucretius' poem De rerum natura provides the best surviving explanation of the ideas of the Greek Epicurean philosophers. It describes the development of the cosmos, the Earth, living things, and human society through purely naturalistic mechanisms, without any reference to supernatural involvement. De rerum natura would influence the cosmological and evolutionary speculations of philosophers and scientists during and after the Renaissance. This view was in strong contrast with the views of Roman philosophers of the Stoic school such as Cicero, Seneca the Younger (c. 4 BC ‚Äì AD 65), and Pliny the Elder (23‚Äî79 AD) who had a strongly teleological view of the natural world that influenced Christian theology. Cicero reports that the peripatetic and Stoic view of nature as an agency concerned most basically with producing life \\"best fitted for survival\\" was taken for granted among the Hellenistic elite. =Origen and Augustine= Augustine of Hippo, shown in this sixth-century AD Roman fresco, wrote that some creatures may have developed from the \\"decomposition\\" of previously existing organisms. In line with earlier Greek thought, the third-century Christian philosopher and Church Father Origen of Alexandria argued that the creation story in the Book of Genesis should be interpreted as an allegory for the falling of human souls away from the glory of the divine, and not as a literal, historical account: In the fourth century AD, the bishop and theologian Augustine of Hippo followed Origen in arguing that the Genesis creation story should not be read too literally. In his book De Genesi ad litteram (On the Literal Meaning of Genesis), he stated that in some cases new creatures may have come about through the \\"decomposition\\" of earlier forms of life. For Augustine, \\"plant, fowl and animal life are not perfect ... but created in a state of potentiality,\\" unlike what he considered the theologically perfect forms of angels, the firmament and the human soul. Augustine's idea 'that forms of life had been transformed \\"slowly over time\\"' prompted Father Giuseppe Tanzella-Nitti, Professor of Theology at the Pontifical Santa Croce University in Rome, to claim that Augustine had suggested a form of evolution. Henry Fairfield Osborn wrote in From the Greeks to Darwin (1894): In A History of the Warfare of Science with Theology in Christendom (1896), Andrew Dickson White wrote about Augustine's attempts to preserve the ancient evolutionary approach to the creation as follows: In Augustine's De Genesi contra Manich√¶os, on Genesis he says: \\"To suppose that God formed man from the dust with bodily hands is very childish. ...God neither formed man with bodily hands nor did he breathe upon him with throat and lips.\\" Augustine suggests in other work his theory of the later development of insects out of carrion, and the adoption of the old emanation or evolution theory, showing that \\"certain very small animals may not have been created on the fifth and sixth days, but may have originated later from putrefying matter.\\" Concerning Augustine's De Trinitate (On the Trinity), White wrote that Augustine \\"...develops at length the view that in the creation of living beings there was something like a growth‚Äîthat God is the ultimate author, but works through secondary causes; and finally argues that certain substances are endowed by God with the power of producing certain classes of plants and animals.\\" Middle Ages Islamic philosophy and the struggle for existence A page from the KitƒÅb al-HayawƒÅn (English: Book of Animals) by al-JƒÅ·∏•i·∫ì Although Greek and Roman evolutionary ideas died out in Europe after the fall of the Roman Empire, they were not lost to Islamic philosophers and scientists. In the Islamic Golden Age of the 8th to the 13th centuries, philosophers explored ideas about natural history. These ideas included transmutation from non-living to living: \\"from mineral to plant, from plant to animal, and from animal to man.\\" In the medieval Islamic world, the scholar al-JƒÅ·∏•i·∫ì (776 ‚Äì c. 868) wrote his Book of Animals in the 9th century. Conway Zirkle, writing about the history of natural selection in 1941, said that an excerpt from this work was the only relevant passage he had found from an Arabian scholar. He provided a quotation describing the struggle for existence, citing a Spanish translation of this work: \\"Every weak animal devours those weaker than itself. Strong animals cannot escape being devoured by other animals stronger than they. And in this respect, men do not differ from animals, some with respect to others, although they do not arrive at the same extremes. In short, God has disposed some human beings as a cause of life for others, and likewise, he has disposed the latter as a cause of the death of the former.\\" Al-JƒÅ·∏•i·∫ì also wrote descriptions of food chains. Some of Ibn Khald≈´n's thoughts, according to some commentators, anticipate the biological theory of evolution. In 1377, Ibn Khald≈´n wrote the Muqaddimah in which he asserted that humans developed from \\"the world of the monkeys,\\" in a process by which \\"species become more numerous\\". In chapter 1 he writes: \\"This world with all the created things in it has a certain order and solid construction. It shows nexuses between causes and things caused, combinations of some parts of creation with others, and transformations of some existent things into others, in a pattern that is both remarkable and endless.\\" The Muqaddimah also states in chapter 6: Christian philosophy Drawing of the great chain of being from Rhetorica Christiana (English: Christian Rhetoric) (1579) by Diego Valad√©s During the Early Middle Ages, Greek classical learning was all but lost to the West. However, contact with the Islamic world, where Greek manuscripts were preserved and expanded, soon led to a massive spate of Latin translations in the 12th century. Europeans were re-introduced to the works of Plato and Aristotle, as well as to Islamic thought. Christian thinkers of the scholastic school, in particular Peter Abelard (1079‚Äì1142) and Thomas Aquinas (1225‚Äì1274), combined Aristotelian classification with Plato's ideas of the goodness of God, and of all potential life forms being present in a perfect creation, to organize all inanimate, animate, and spiritual beings into a huge interconnected system: the scala naturae, or great chain of being. Within this system, everything that existed could be placed in order, from \\"lowest\\" to \\"highest,\\" with Hell at the bottom and God at the top‚Äîbelow God, an angelic hierarchy marked by the orbits of the planets, mankind in an intermediate position, and worms the lowest of the animals. As the universe was ultimately perfect, the great chain of being was also perfect. There were no empty links in the chain, and no link was represented by more than one species. Therefore, no species could ever move from one position to another. Thus, in this Christianized version of Plato's perfect universe, species could never change, but remained forever fixed, in accordance with the text of the Book of Genesis. For humans to forget their position was seen as sinful, whether they behaved like lower animals or aspired to a higher station than was given them by their Creator. Creatures on adjacent steps were expected to closely resemble each other, an idea expressed in the saying: (\\"nature does not make leaps\\"). This basic concept of the great chain of being greatly influenced the thinking of Western civilization for centuries (and still has an influence today). It formed a part of the argument from design presented by natural theology. As a classification system, it became the major organizing principle and foundation of the emerging science of biology in the 17th and 18th centuries. Thomas Aquinas on creation and natural processes While Christian theologians held that the natural world was part of an unchanging designed hierarchy, some theologians speculated that the world might have developed through natural processes. Thomas Aquinas went even farther than Augustine of Hippo in arguing that scriptural texts like Genesis should not be interpreted in a literal way that conflicted with or constrained what natural philosophers learned about the workings of the natural world. He saw that the autonomy of nature was a sign of God's goodness, and detected no conflict between a divinely created universe and the idea that the universe had developed over time through natural mechanisms. However, Aquinas disputed the views of those (like the ancient Greek philosopher Empedocles) who held that such natural processes showed that the universe could have developed without an underlying purpose. Aquinas rather held that: \\"Hence, it is clear that nature is nothing but a certain kind of art, i.e., the divine art, impressed upon things, by which these things are moved to a determinate end. It is as if the shipbuilder were able to give to timbers that by which they would move themselves to take the form of a ship.\\" Renaissance and Enlightenment Pierre Belon compared the skeletons of humans (left) and birds (right) in his L'Histoire de la nature des oyseaux (English: The Natural History of Birds) (1555) In the first half of the 17th century, Ren√© Descartes' mechanical philosophy encouraged the use of the metaphor of the universe as a machine, a concept that would come to characterise the scientific revolution. Between 1650 and 1800, some naturalists, such as Beno√Æt de Maillet, produced theories that maintained that the universe, the Earth, and life, had developed mechanically, without divine guidance. In contrast, most contemporary theories of evolution, such of those of Gottfried Leibniz and Johann Gottfried Herder, regarded evolution as a fundamentally spiritual process. In 1751, Pierre Louis Maupertuis veered toward more materialist ground. He wrote of natural modifications occurring during reproduction and accumulating over the course of many generations, producing races and even new species, a description that anticipated in general terms the concept of natural selection. Maupertuis' ideas were in opposition to the influence of early taxonomists like John Ray. In the late 17th century, Ray had given the first formal definition of a biological species, which he described as being characterized by essential unchanging features, and stated the seed of one species could never give rise to another. The ideas of Ray and other 17th-century taxonomists were influenced by natural theology and the argument from design. The word evolution (from the Latin evolutio, meaning \\"to unroll like a scroll\\") was initially used to refer to embryological development; its first use in relation to development of species came in 1762, when Charles Bonnet used it for his concept of \\"pre-formation,\\" in which females carried a miniature form of all future generations. The term gradually gained a more general meaning of growth or progressive development. Later in the 18th century, the French philosopher Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon, one of the leading naturalists of the time, suggested that what most people referred to as species were really just well-marked varieties, modified from an original form by environmental factors. For example, he believed that lions, tigers, leopards, and house cats might all have a common ancestor. He further speculated that the 200 or so species of mammals then known might have descended from as few as 38 original animal forms. Buffon's evolutionary ideas were limited; he believed each of the original forms had arisen through spontaneous generation and that each was shaped by \\"internal moulds\\" that limited the amount of change. Buffon's works, Histoire naturelle (1749‚Äì1789) and √âpoques de la nature (1778), containing well-developed theories about a completely materialistic origin for the Earth and his ideas questioning the fixity of species, were extremely influential. Another French philosopher, Denis Diderot, also wrote that living things might have first arisen through spontaneous generation, and that species were always changing through a constant process of experiment where new forms arose and survived or not based on trial and error; an idea that can be considered a partial anticipation of natural selection. Between 1767 and 1792, James Burnett, Lord Monboddo, included in his writings not only the concept that man had descended from primates, but also that, in response to the environment, creatures had found methods of transforming their characteristics over long time intervals. Charles Darwin's grandfather, Erasmus Darwin, published Zoonomia (1794‚Äì1796) which suggested that \\"all warm-blooded animals have arisen from one living filament.\\" In his poem Temple of Nature (1803), he described the rise of life from minute organisms living in mud to all of its modern diversity. Early 19th century Richard Owen's 1861 geological timescale from Pal√¶ontology, showing the appearance of major animal types Paleontology and geology In 1796, Georges Cuvier published his findings on the differences between living elephants and those found in the fossil record. His analysis identified mammoths and mastodons as distinct species, different from any living animal, and effectively ended a long-running debate over whether a species could become extinct. In 1788, James Hutton described gradual geological processes operating continuously over deep time.: \\"...we find no vestige of a beginning, no prospect of an end.\\" In the 1790s, William Smith began the process of ordering rock strata by examining fossils in the layers while he worked on his geologic map of England. Independently, in 1811, Cuvier and Alexandre Brongniart published an influential study of the geologic history of the region around Paris, based on the stratigraphic succession of rock layers. These works helped establish the antiquity of the Earth. Cuvier advocated catastrophism to explain the patterns of extinction and faunal succession revealed by the fossil record. Knowledge of the fossil record continued to advance rapidly during the first few decades of the 19th century. By the 1840s, the outlines of the geologic timescale were becoming clear, and in 1841 John Phillips named three major eras, based on the predominant fauna of each: the Paleozoic, dominated by marine invertebrates and fish, the Mesozoic, the age of reptiles, and the current Cenozoic age of mammals. This progressive picture of the history of life was accepted even by conservative English geologists like Adam Sedgwick and William Buckland; however, like Cuvier, they attributed the progression to repeated catastrophic episodes of extinction followed by new episodes of creation. Unlike Cuvier, Buckland and some other advocates of natural theology among British geologists made efforts to explicitly link the last catastrophic episode proposed by Cuvier to the biblical flood. From 1830 to 1833, geologist Charles Lyell published his multi-volume work Principles of Geology, which, building on Hutton's ideas, advocated a uniformitarian alternative to the catastrophic theory of geology. Lyell claimed that, rather than being the products of cataclysmic (and possibly supernatural) events, the geologic features of the Earth are better explained as the result of the same gradual geologic forces observable in the present day‚Äîbut acting over immensely long periods of time. Although Lyell opposed evolutionary ideas (even questioning the consensus that the fossil record demonstrates a true progression), his concept that the Earth was shaped by forces working gradually over an extended period, and the immense age of the Earth assumed by his theories, would strongly influence future evolutionary thinkers such as Charles Darwin. Transmutation of species Lamarck's two-factor theory involves a complexifying force driving animal body plans towards higher levels (orthogenesis) creating a ladder of phyla, and an adaptive force causing animals with a given body plan to adapt to circumstances (use and disuse, inheritance of acquired characteristics), creating a diversity of species and genera. Jean-Baptiste Lamarck proposed, in his Philosophie Zoologique of 1809, a theory of the transmutation of species (transformisme). Lamarck did not believe that all living things shared a common ancestor but rather that simple forms of life were created continuously by spontaneous generation. He also believed that an innate life force drove species to become more complex over time, advancing up a linear ladder of complexity that was related to the great chain of being. Lamarck recognized that species adapted to their environment. He explained this by saying that the same innate force driving increasing complexity caused the organs of an animal (or a plant) to change based on the use or disuse of those organs, just as exercise affects muscles. He argued that these changes would be inherited by the next generation and produce slow adaptation to the environment. It was this secondary mechanism of adaptation through the inheritance of acquired characteristics that would become known as Lamarckism and would influence discussions of evolution into the 20th century. A radical British school of comparative anatomy that included the anatomist Robert Edmond Grant was closely in touch with Lamarck's French school of Transformationism. One of the French scientists who influenced Grant was the anatomist √âtienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, whose ideas on the unity of various animal body plans and the homology of certain anatomical structures would be widely influential and lead to intense debate with his colleague Georges Cuvier. Grant became an authority on the anatomy and reproduction of marine invertebrates. He developed Lamarck's and Erasmus Darwin's ideas of transmutation and evolutionism, and investigated homology, even proposing that plants and animals had a common evolutionary starting point. As a young student, Charles Darwin joined Grant in investigations of the life cycle of marine animals. In 1826, an anonymous paper, probably written by Robert Jameson, praised Lamarck for explaining how higher animals had \\"evolved\\" from the simplest worms; this was the first use of the word \\"evolved\\" in a modern sense. Robert Chambers's Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation (1844) shows fish (F), reptiles (R), and birds (B) branching from a path leading to mammals (M). In 1844, the Scottish publisher Robert Chambers anonymously published an extremely controversial but widely read book entitled Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation. This book proposed an evolutionary scenario for the origins of the Solar System and of life on Earth. It claimed that the fossil record showed a progressive ascent of animals, with current animals branching off a main line that leads progressively to humanity. It implied that the transmutations lead to the unfolding of a preordained plan that had been woven into the laws that governed the universe. In this sense it was less completely materialistic than the ideas of radicals like Grant, but its implication that humans were only the last step in the ascent of animal life incensed many conservative thinkers. The high profile of the public debate over Vestiges, with its depiction of evolution as a progressive process, would greatly influence the perception of Darwin's theory a decade later. Ideas about the transmutation of species were associated with the radical materialism of the Enlightenment and were attacked by more conservative thinkers. Cuvier attacked the ideas of Lamarck and Geoffroy, agreeing with Aristotle that species were immutable. Cuvier believed that the individual parts of an animal were too closely correlated with one another to allow for one part of the anatomy to change in isolation from the others, and argued that the fossil record showed patterns of catastrophic extinctions followed by repopulation, rather than gradual change over time. He also noted that drawings of animals and animal mummies from Egypt, which were thousands of years old, showed no signs of change when compared with modern animals. The strength of Cuvier's arguments and his scientific reputation helped keep transmutational ideas out of the mainstream for decades. Richard Owen's 1848 diagram shows his conceptual archetype for all vertebrates. In Great Britain, the philosophy of natural theology remained influential. William Paley's 1802 book Natural Theology with its famous watchmaker analogy had been written at least in part as a response to the transmutational ideas of Erasmus Darwin. Geologists influenced by natural theology, such as Buckland and Sedgwick, made a regular practice of attacking the evolutionary ideas of Lamarck, Grant, and Vestiges. Although Charles Lyell opposed scriptural geology, he also believed in the immutability of species, and in his Principles of Geology, he criticized Lamarck's theories of development. Idealists such as Louis Agassiz and Richard Owen believed that each species was fixed and unchangeable because it represented an idea in the mind of the creator. They believed that relationships between species could be discerned from developmental patterns in embryology, as well as in the fossil record, but that these relationships represented an underlying pattern of divine thought, with progressive creation leading to increasing complexity and culminating in humanity. Owen developed the idea of \\"archetypes\\" in the Divine mind that would produce a sequence of species related by anatomical homologies, such as vertebrate limbs. Owen led a public campaign that successfully marginalized Grant in the scientific community. Darwin would make good use of the homologies analyzed by Owen in his own theory, but the harsh treatment of Grant, and the controversy surrounding Vestiges, showed him the need to ensure that his own ideas were scientifically sound. Anticipations of natural selection It is possible to look through the history of biology from the ancient Greeks onwards and discover anticipations of almost all of Charles Darwin's key ideas. As an example, Loren Eiseley has found isolated passages written by Buffon suggesting he was almost ready to piece together a theory of natural selection, but states that such anticipations should not be taken out of the full context of the writings or of cultural values of the time which made Darwinian ideas of evolution unthinkable. When Darwin was developing his theory, he investigated selective breeding and was impressed by Sebright's observation that \\"A severe winter, or a scarcity of food, by destroying the weak and the unhealthy, has all the good effects of the most skilful selection\\" so that \\"the weak and the unhealthy do not live to propagate their infirmities.\\" Darwin was influenced by Charles Lyell's ideas of environmental change causing ecological shifts, leading to what Augustin de Candolle had called a war between competing plant species, competition well described by the botanist William Herbert. Darwin was struck by Thomas Robert Malthus' phrase \\"struggle for existence\\" used of warring human tribes. Several writers anticipated evolutionary aspects of Darwin's theory, and in the third edition of On the Origin of Species published in 1861 Darwin named those he knew about in an introductory appendix, An Historical Sketch of the Recent Progress of Opinion on the Origin of Species, which he expanded in later editions. In 1813, William Charles Wells read before the Royal Society essays assuming that there had been evolution of humans, and recognising the principle of natural selection. Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace were unaware of this work when they jointly published the theory in 1858, but Darwin later acknowledged that Wells had recognised the principle before them, writing that the paper \\"An Account of a White Female, part of whose Skin resembles that of a Negro\\" was published in 1818, and \\"he distinctly recognises the principle of natural selection, and this is the first recognition which has been indicated; but he applies it only to the races of man, and to certain characters alone.\\" Patrick Matthew wrote in his book On Naval Timber and Arboriculture (1831) of \\"continual balancing of life to circumstance. ... [The] progeny of the same parents, under great differences of circumstance, might, in several generations, even become distinct species, incapable of co-reproduction.\\" Darwin implies that he discovered this work after the initial publication of the Origin. In the brief historical sketch that Darwin included in the 3rd edition he says \\"Unfortunately the view was given by Mr. Matthew very briefly in scattered passages in an Appendix to a work on a different subject ... He clearly saw, however, the full force of the principle of natural selection.\\" However, as historian of science Peter J. Bowler says, \\"Through a combination of bold theorizing and comprehensive evaluation, Darwin came up with a concept of evolution that was unique for the time.\\" Bowler goes on to say that simple priority alone is not enough to secure a place in the history of science; someone has to develop an idea and convince others of its importance to have a real impact. Thomas Henry Huxley said in his essay on the reception of On the Origin of Species: Charles Darwin's first sketch of an evolutionary tree from his \\"B\\" notebook on the transmutation of species (1837‚Äì1838) Natural selection The biogeographical patterns Charles Darwin observed in places such as the Gal√°pagos Islands during the second voyage of HMS Beagle caused him to doubt the fixity of species, and in 1837 Darwin started the first of a series of secret notebooks on transmutation. Darwin's observations led him to view transmutation as a process of divergence and branching, rather than the ladder-like progression envisioned by Jean-Baptiste Lamarck and others. In 1838 he read the new 6th edition of An Essay on the Principle of Population, written in the late 18th century by Thomas Robert Malthus. Malthus' idea of population growth leading to a struggle for survival combined with Darwin's knowledge on how breeders selected traits, led to the inception of Darwin's theory of natural selection. Darwin did not publish his ideas on evolution for 20 years. However, he did share them with certain other naturalists and friends, starting with Joseph Dalton Hooker, with whom he discussed his unpublished 1844 essay on natural selection. During this period he used the time he could spare from his other scientific work to slowly refine his ideas and, aware of the intense controversy around transmutation, amass evidence to support them. In September 1854 he began full-time work on writing his book on natural selection. Unlike Darwin, Alfred Russel Wallace, influenced by the book Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation, already suspected that transmutation of species occurred when he began his career as a naturalist. By 1855, his biogeographical observations during his field work in South America and the Malay Archipelago made him confident enough in a branching pattern of evolution to publish a paper stating that every species originated in close proximity to an already existing closely allied species. Like Darwin, it was Wallace's consideration of how the ideas of Malthus might apply to animal populations that led him to conclusions very similar to those reached by Darwin about the role of natural selection. In February 1858, Wallace, unaware of Darwin's unpublished ideas, composed his thoughts into an essay and mailed them to Darwin, asking for his opinion. The result was the joint publication in July of an extract from Darwin's 1844 essay along with Wallace's letter. Darwin also began work on a short abstract summarising his theory, which he would publish in 1859 as On the Origin of Species. Othniel Charles Marsh's diagram of the evolution of horse feet and teeth over time as reproduced in Thomas Henry Huxley's Prof. Huxley in America (1876) 1859‚Äì1930s: Darwin and his legacy By the 1850s, whether or not species evolved was a subject of intense debate, with prominent scientists arguing both sides of the issue. The publication of Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species fundamentally transformed the discussion over biological origins.: \\"The centrality of Origin of Species in the rise of widespread evolutionary thinking has long been accepted by historians of science. However, some scholars have recently begun to challenge this idea. James A. Secord, in his study of the impact of Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation, argues that in some ways Vestiges had as much or more impact than Origin, at least into the 1880s. Focusing so much on Darwin and Origin, he argues, \\"obliterates decades of labor by teachers, theologians, technicians, printers, editors, and other researchers, whose work has made evolutionary debates so significant during the past two centuries.\\" Darwin argued that his branching version of evolution explained a wealth of facts in biogeography, anatomy, embryology, and other fields of biology. He also provided the first cogent mechanism by which evolutionary change could persist: his theory of natural selection. One of the first and most important naturalists to be convinced by Origin of the reality of evolution was the British anatomist Thomas Henry Huxley. Huxley recognized that unlike the earlier transmutational ideas of Jean-Baptiste Lamarck and Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation, Darwin's theory provided a mechanism for evolution without supernatural involvement, even if Huxley himself was not completely convinced that natural selection was the key evolutionary mechanism. Huxley would make advocacy of evolution a cornerstone of the program of the X Club to reform and professionalise science by displacing natural theology with naturalism and to end the domination of British natural science by the clergy. By the early 1870s in English-speaking countries, thanks partly to these efforts, evolution had become the mainstream scientific explanation for the origin of species. In his campaign for public and scientific acceptance of Darwin's theory, Huxley made extensive use of new evidence for evolution from paleontology. This included evidence that birds had evolved from reptiles, including the discovery of Archaeopteryx in Europe, and a number of fossils of primitive birds with teeth found in North America. Another important line of evidence was the finding of fossils that helped trace the evolution of the horse from its small five-toed ancestors. However, acceptance of evolution among scientists in non-English speaking nations such as France, and the countries of southern Europe and Latin America was slower. An exception to this was Germany, where both August Weismann and Ernst Haeckel championed this idea: Haeckel used evolution to challenge the established tradition of metaphysical idealism in German biology, much as Huxley used it to challenge natural theology in Britain. Haeckel and other German scientists would take the lead in launching an ambitious programme to reconstruct the evolutionary history of life based on morphology and embryology. Darwin's theory succeeded in profoundly altering scientific opinion regarding the development of life and in producing a small philosophical revolution. However, this theory could not explain several critical components of the evolutionary process. Specifically, Darwin was unable to explain the source of variation in traits within a species, and could not identify a mechanism that could pass traits faithfully from one generation to the next. Darwin's hypothesis of pangenesis, while relying in part on the inheritance of acquired characteristics, proved to be useful for statistical models of evolution that were developed by his cousin Francis Galton and the \\"biometric\\" school of evolutionary thought. However, this idea proved to be of little use to other biologists. Application to humans This illustration (the root of The March of Progress) was the frontispiece of Thomas Henry Huxley's book Evidence as to Man's Place in Nature (1863). Huxley applied Darwin's ideas to humans, using comparative anatomy to show that humans and apes had a common ancestor, which challenged the theologically important idea that humans held a unique place in the universe. Charles Darwin was aware of the severe reaction in some parts of the scientific community against the suggestion made in Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation that humans had arisen from animals by a process of transmutation. Therefore, he almost completely ignored the topic of human evolution in On the Origin of Species. Despite this precaution, the issue featured prominently in the debate that followed the book's publication. For most of the first half of the 19th century, the scientific community believed that, although geology had shown that the Earth and life were very old, human beings had appeared suddenly just a few thousand years before the present. However, a series of archaeological discoveries in the 1840s and 1850s showed stone tools associated with the remains of extinct animals. By the early 1860s, as summarized in Charles Lyell's 1863 book Geological Evidences of the Antiquity of Man, it had become widely accepted that humans had existed during a prehistoric period‚Äîwhich stretched many thousands of years before the start of written history. This view of human history was more compatible with an evolutionary origin for humanity than was the older view. On the other hand, at that time there was no fossil evidence to demonstrate human evolution. The only human fossils found before the discovery of Java Man in the 1890s were either of anatomically modern humans or of Neanderthals that were too close, especially in the critical characteristic of cranial capacity, to modern humans for them to be convincing intermediates between humans and other primates. Therefore, the debate that immediately followed the publication of On the Origin of Species centered on the similarities and differences between humans and modern apes. Carolus Linnaeus had been criticised in the 18th century for grouping humans and apes together as primates in his ground breaking classification system. Richard Owen vigorously defended the classification suggested by Georges Cuvier and Johann Friedrich Blumenbach that placed humans in a separate order from any of the other mammals, which by the early 19th century had become the orthodox view. On the other hand, Thomas Henry Huxley sought to demonstrate a close anatomical relationship between humans and apes. In one famous incident, which became known as the Great Hippocampus Question, Huxley showed that Owen was mistaken in claiming that the brains of gorillas lacked a structure present in human brains. Huxley summarized his argument in his highly influential 1863 book Evidence as to Man's Place in Nature. Another viewpoint was advocated by Lyell and Alfred Russel Wallace. They agreed that humans shared a common ancestor with apes, but questioned whether any purely materialistic mechanism could account for all the differences between humans and apes, especially some aspects of the human mind. In 1871, Darwin published The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex, which contained his views on human evolution. Darwin argued that the differences between the human mind and the minds of the higher animals were a matter of degree rather than of kind. For example, he viewed morality as a natural outgrowth of instincts that were beneficial to animals living in social groups. He argued that all the differences between humans and apes were explained by a combination of the selective pressures that came from our ancestors moving from the trees to the plains, and sexual selection. The debate over human origins, and over the degree of human uniqueness continued well into the 20th century. Alternatives to natural selection This photo from Henry Fairfield Osborn's 1917 book Origin and Evolution of Life shows models depicting the evolution of Titanothere horns over time, which Osborn claimed was an example of an orthogenetic trend in evolution. The concept of evolution was widely accepted in scientific circles within a few years of the publication of Origin, but the acceptance of natural selection as its driving mechanism was much less widespread. The four major alternatives to natural selection in the late 19th century were theistic evolution, neo-Lamarckism, orthogenesis, and saltationism. Alternatives supported by biologists at other times included structuralism, Georges Cuvier's teleological but non-evolutionary functionalism, and vitalism. Theistic evolution was the idea that God intervened in the process of evolution, to guide it in such a way that the living world could still be considered to be designed. The term was promoted by Charles Darwin's greatest American advocate Asa Gray. However, this idea gradually fell out of favor among scientists, as they became more and more committed to the idea of methodological naturalism and came to believe that direct appeals to supernatural involvement were scientifically unproductive. By 1900, theistic evolution had largely disappeared from professional scientific discussions, although it retained a strong popular following. In the late 19th century, the term neo-Lamarckism came to be associated with the position of naturalists who viewed the inheritance of acquired characteristics as the most important evolutionary mechanism. Advocates of this position included the British writer and Darwin critic Samuel Butler, the German biologist Ernst Haeckel, and the American paleontologist Edward Drinker Cope. They considered Lamarckism to be philosophically superior to Darwin's idea of selection acting on random variation. Cope looked for, and thought he found, patterns of linear progression in the fossil record. Inheritance of acquired characteristics was part of Haeckel's recapitulation theory of evolution, which held that the embryological development of an organism repeats its evolutionary history. Critics of neo-Lamarckism, such as the German biologist August Weismann and Alfred Russel Wallace, pointed out that no one had ever produced solid evidence for the inheritance of acquired characteristics. Despite these criticisms, neo-Lamarckism remained the most popular alternative to natural selection at the end of the 19th century, and would remain the position of some naturalists well into the 20th century. Orthogenesis was the hypothesis that life has an innate tendency to change, in a unilinear fashion, towards ever-greater perfection. It had a significant following in the 19th century, and its proponents included the Russian biologist Leo S. Berg and the American paleontologist Henry Fairfield Osborn. Orthogenesis was popular among some paleontologists, who believed that the fossil record showed a gradual and constant unidirectional change. Saltationism was the idea that new species arise as a result of large mutations. It was seen as a much faster alternative to the Darwinian concept of a gradual process of small random variations being acted on by natural selection, and was popular with early geneticists such as Hugo de Vries, William Bateson, and early in his career, Thomas Hunt Morgan. It became the basis of the mutation theory of evolution. Diagram from Thomas Hunt Morgan's 1919 book The Physical Basis of Heredity, showing the sex-linked inheritance of the white-eyed mutation in Drosophila melanogaster Mendelian genetics, biometrics, and mutation The rediscovery of Gregor Mendel's laws of inheritance in 1900 ignited a fierce debate between two camps of biologists. In one camp were the Mendelians, who were focused on discrete variations and the laws of inheritance. They were led by William Bateson (who coined the word genetics) and Hugo de Vries (who coined the word mutation). Their opponents were the biometricians, who were interested in the continuous variation of characteristics within populations. Their leaders, Karl Pearson and Walter Frank Raphael Weldon, followed in the tradition of Francis Galton, who had focused on measurement and statistical analysis of variation within a population. The biometricians rejected Mendelian genetics on the basis that discrete units of heredity, such as genes, could not explain the continuous range of variation seen in real populations. Weldon's work with crabs and snails provided evidence that selection pressure from the environment could shift the range of variation in wild populations, but the Mendelians maintained that the variations measured by biometricians were too insignificant to account for the evolution of new species. When Thomas Hunt Morgan began experimenting with breeding the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, he was a saltationist who hoped to demonstrate that a new species could be created in the lab by mutation alone. Instead, the work at his lab between 1910 and 1915 reconfirmed Mendelian genetics and provided solid experimental evidence linking it to chromosomal inheritance. His work also demonstrated that most mutations had relatively small effects, such as a change in eye color, and that rather than creating a new species in a single step, mutations served to increase variation within the existing population. 1920s‚Äì1940s Population genetics The Mendelian and biometrician models were eventually reconciled with the development of population genetics. A key step was the work of the British biologist and statistician Ronald Fisher. In a series of papers starting in 1918 and culminating in his 1930 book The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection, Fisher showed that the continuous variation measured by the biometricians could be produced by the combined action of many discrete genes, and that natural selection could change gene frequencies in a population, resulting in evolution. In a series of papers beginning in 1924, another British geneticist, J. B. S. Haldane, applied statistical analysis to real-world examples of natural selection, such as the evolution of industrial melanism in peppered moths, and showed that natural selection worked at an even faster rate than Fisher assumed. The American biologist Sewall Wright, who had a background in animal breeding experiments, focused on combinations of interacting genes, and the effects of inbreeding on small, relatively isolated populations that exhibited genetic drift. In 1932, Wright introduced the concept of an adaptive landscape and argued that genetic drift and inbreeding could drive a small, isolated sub- population away from an adaptive peak, allowing natural selection to drive it towards different adaptive peaks. The work of Fisher, Haldane and Wright founded the discipline of population genetics. This integrated natural selection with Mendelian genetics, which was the critical first step in developing a unified theory of how evolution worked. The modern synthesis Several major ideas about evolution came together in the population genetics of the early 20th century to form the modern synthesis, including genetic variation, natural selection, and particulate (Mendelian) inheritance. This ended the eclipse of Darwinism and supplanted a variety of non-Darwinian theories of evolution. In the first few decades of the 20th century, most field naturalists continued to believe that alternative mechanisms of evolution such as Lamarckism and orthogenesis provided the best explanation for the complexity they observed in the living world. But as the field of genetics continued to develop, those views became less tenable. Theodosius Dobzhansky, a postdoctoral worker in Thomas Hunt Morgan's lab, had been influenced by the work on genetic diversity by Russian geneticists such as Sergei Chetverikov. He helped to bridge the divide between the foundations of microevolution developed by the population geneticists and the patterns of macroevolution observed by field biologists, with his 1937 book Genetics and the Origin of Species. Dobzhansky examined the genetic diversity of wild populations and showed that, contrary to the assumptions of the population geneticists, these populations had large amounts of genetic diversity, with marked differences between sub-populations. The book also took the highly mathematical work of the population geneticists and put it into a more accessible form. In Britain, E. B. Ford, the pioneer of ecological genetics, continued throughout the 1930s and 1940s to demonstrate the power of selection due to ecological factors including the ability to maintain genetic diversity through genetic polymorphisms such as human blood types. Ford's work would contribute to a shift in emphasis during the course of the modern synthesis towards natural selection over genetic drift. The evolutionary biologist Ernst Mayr was influenced by the work of the German biologist Bernhard Rensch showing the influence of local environmental factors on the geographic distribution of sub-species and closely related species. Mayr followed up on Dobzhansky's work with the 1942 book Systematics and the Origin of Species, which emphasized the importance of allopatric speciation in the formation of new species. This form of speciation occurs when the geographical isolation of a sub-population is followed by the development of mechanisms for reproductive isolation. Mayr also formulated the biological species concept that defined a species as a group of interbreeding or potentially interbreeding populations that were reproductively isolated from all other populations. In the 1944 book Tempo and Mode in Evolution, George Gaylord Simpson showed that the fossil record was consistent with the irregular non-directional pattern predicted by the developing evolutionary synthesis, and that the linear trends that earlier paleontologists had claimed supported orthogenesis and neo-Lamarckism did not hold up to closer examination. In 1950, G. Ledyard Stebbins published Variation and Evolution in Plants, which helped to integrate botany into the synthesis. The emerging cross-disciplinary consensus on the workings of evolution would be known as the modern synthesis. It received its name from the 1942 book Evolution: The Modern Synthesis by Julian Huxley. The modern synthesis provided a conceptual core‚Äîin particular, natural selection and Mendelian population genetics‚Äîthat tied together many, but not all, biological disciplines: developmental biology was one of the omissions. It helped establish the legitimacy of evolutionary biology, a primarily historical science, in a scientific climate that favored experimental methods over historical ones. The synthesis also resulted in a considerable narrowing of the range of mainstream evolutionary thought (what Stephen Jay Gould called the \\"hardening of the synthesis\\"): by the 1950s, natural selection acting on genetic variation was virtually the only acceptable mechanism of evolutionary change (panselectionism), and macroevolution was simply considered the result of extensive microevolution. 1940s‚Äì1960s: Molecular biology and evolution The middle decades of the 20th century saw the rise of molecular biology, and with it an understanding of the chemical nature of genes as sequences of DNA and of their relationship‚Äîthrough the genetic code‚Äîto protein sequences. At the same time, increasingly powerful techniques for analyzing proteins, such as protein electrophoresis and sequencing, brought biochemical phenomena into realm of the synthetic theory of evolution. In the early 1960s, biochemists Linus Pauling and Emile Zuckerkandl proposed the molecular clock hypothesis (MCH): that sequence differences between homologous proteins could be used to calculate the time since two species diverged. By 1969, Motoo Kimura and others provided a theoretical basis for the molecular clock, arguing that‚Äîat the molecular level at least‚Äîmost genetic mutations are neither harmful nor helpful and that mutation and genetic drift (rather than natural selection) cause a large portion of genetic change: the neutral theory of molecular evolution. Studies of protein differences within species also brought molecular data to bear on population genetics by providing estimates of the level of heterozygosity in natural populations. From the early 1960s, molecular biology was increasingly seen as a threat to the traditional core of evolutionary biology. Established evolutionary biologists‚Äîparticularly Ernst Mayr, Theodosius Dobzhansky, and George Gaylord Simpson, three of the architects of the modern synthesis‚Äîwere extremely skeptical of molecular approaches, especially when it came to the connection (or lack thereof) to natural selection. The molecular-clock hypothesis and the neutral theory were particularly controversial, spawning the neutralist-selectionist debate over the relative importance of mutation, drift and selection, which continued into the 1980s without a clear resolution. Late 20th century Gene-centered view In the mid-1960s, George C. Williams strongly critiqued explanations of adaptations worded in terms of \\"survival of the species\\" (group selection arguments). Such explanations were largely replaced by a gene-centered view of evolution, epitomized by the kin selection arguments of W. D. Hamilton, George R. Price and John Maynard Smith. This viewpoint would be summarized and popularized in the influential 1976 book The Selfish Gene by Richard Dawkins. Models of the period seemed to show that group selection was severely limited in its strength; though newer models do admit the possibility of significant multi-level selection. In 1973, Leigh Van Valen proposed the term \\"Red Queen,\\" which he took from Through the Looking-Glass by Lewis Carroll, to describe a scenario where a species involved in one or more evolutionary arms races would have to constantly change just to keep pace with the species with which it was co-evolving. Hamilton, Williams and others suggested that this idea might explain the evolution of sexual reproduction: the increased genetic diversity caused by sexual reproduction would help maintain resistance against rapidly evolving parasites, thus making sexual reproduction common, despite the tremendous cost from the gene-centric point of view of a system where only half of an organism's genome is passed on during reproduction. However, contrary to the expectations of the Red Queen hypothesis, Hanley et al. found that the prevalence, abundance and mean intensity of mites was significantly higher in sexual geckos than in asexuals sharing the same habitat. Furthermore, Parker, after reviewing numerous genetic studies on plant disease resistance, failed to find a single example consistent with the concept that pathogens are the primary selective agent responsible for sexual reproduction in their host. At an even more fundamental level, Heng and Gorelick and Heng reviewed evidence that sex, rather than enhancing diversity, acts as a constraint on genetic diversity. They considered that sex acts as a coarse filter, weeding out major genetic changes, such as chromosomal rearrangements, but permitting minor variation, such as changes at the nucleotide or gene level (that are often neutral) to pass through the sexual sieve. The adaptive function of sex, today, remains a major unresolved issue in biology. The competing models to explain the adaptive function of sex were reviewed by Birdsell and Wills. A principal alternative view to the Red Queen hypothesis is that sex arose, and is maintained, as a process for repairing DNA damage, and that genetic variation is produced as a byproduct. The gene-centric view has also led to an increased interest in Charles Darwin's old idea of sexual selection, and more recently in topics such as sexual conflict and intragenomic conflict. Sociobiology W. D. Hamilton's work on kin selection contributed to the emergence of the discipline of sociobiology. The existence of altruistic behaviors has been a difficult problem for evolutionary theorists from the beginning. Significant progress was made in 1964 when Hamilton formulated the inequality in kin selection known as Hamilton's rule, which showed how eusociality in insects (the existence of sterile worker classes) and many other examples of altruistic behavior could have evolved through kin selection. Other theories followed, some derived from game theory, such as reciprocal altruism. In 1975, E. O. Wilson published the influential and highly controversial book Sociobiology: The New Synthesis which claimed evolutionary theory could help explain many aspects of animal, including human, behavior. Critics of sociobiology, including Stephen Jay Gould and Richard Lewontin, claimed that sociobiology greatly overstated the degree to which complex human behaviors could be determined by genetic factors. They also claimed that the theories of sociobiologists often reflected their own ideological biases. Despite these criticisms, work has continued in sociobiology and the related discipline of evolutionary psychology, including work on other aspects of the altruism problem. Evolutionary paths and processes A phylogenetic tree showing the three- domain system. Eukaryotes are colored red, archaea green, and bacteria blue One of the most prominent debates arising during the 1970s was over the theory of punctuated equilibrium. Niles Eldredge and Stephen Jay Gould proposed that there was a pattern of fossil species that remained largely unchanged for long periods (what they termed stasis), interspersed with relatively brief periods of rapid change during speciation. Improvements in sequencing methods resulted in a large increase of sequenced genomes, allowing the testing and refining of evolutionary theories using this huge amount of genome data. Comparisons between these genomes provide insights into the molecular mechanisms of speciation and adaptation. These genomic analyses have produced fundamental changes in the understanding of the evolutionary history of life, such as the proposal of the three-domain system by Carl Woese. Advances in computational hardware and software allow the testing and extrapolation of increasingly advanced evolutionary models and the development of the field of systems biology. One of the results has been an exchange of ideas between theories of biological evolution and the field of computer science known as evolutionary computation, which attempts to mimic biological evolution for the purpose of developing new computer algorithms. Discoveries in biotechnology now allow the modification of entire genomes, advancing evolutionary studies to the level where future experiments may involve the creation of entirely synthetic organisms. Microbiology, horizontal gene transfer, and endosymbiosis Microbiology was largely ignored by early evolutionary theory. This was due to the paucity of morphological traits and the lack of a species concept in microbiology, particularly amongst prokaryotes. Now, evolutionary researchers are taking advantage of their improved understanding of microbial physiology and ecology, produced by the comparative ease of microbial genomics, to explore the taxonomy and evolution of these organisms. These studies are revealing unanticipated levels of diversity amongst microbes. One important development in the study of microbial evolution came with the discovery in Japan in 1959 of horizontal gene transfer. This transfer of genetic material between different species of bacteria came to the attention of scientists because it played a major role in the spread of antibiotic resistance. More recently, as knowledge of genomes has continued to expand, it has been suggested that lateral transfer of genetic material has played an important role in the evolution of all organisms. These high levels of horizontal gene transfer have led to suggestions that the family tree of today's organisms, the so-called \\"tree of life,\\" is more similar to an interconnected web or net. Indeed, the endosymbiotic theory for the origin of organelles sees a form of horizontal gene transfer as a critical step in the evolution of eukaryotes such as fungi, plants, and animals. The endosymbiotic theory holds that organelles within the cells of eukorytes such as mitochondria and chloroplasts, had descended from independent bacteria that came to live symbiotically within other cells. It had been suggested in the late 19th century when similarities between mitochondria and bacteria were noted, but largely dismissed until it was revived and championed by Lynn Margulis in the 1960s and 1970s; Margulis was able to make use of new evidence that such organelles had their own DNA that was inherited independently from that in the cell's nucleus. From spandrels to evolutionary developmental biology In the 1980s and 1990s, the tenets of the modern evolutionary synthesis came under increasing scrutiny. There was a renewal of structuralist themes in evolutionary biology in the work of biologists such as Brian Goodwin and Stuart Kauffman, which incorporated ideas from cybernetics and systems theory, and emphasized the self-organizing processes of development as factors directing the course of evolution. The evolutionary biologist Stephen Jay Gould revived earlier ideas of heterochrony, alterations in the relative rates of developmental processes over the course of evolution, to account for the generation of novel forms, and, with the evolutionary biologist Richard Lewontin, wrote an influential paper in 1979 suggesting that a change in one biological structure, or even a structural novelty, could arise incidentally as an accidental result of selection on another structure, rather than through direct selection for that particular adaptation. They called such incidental structural changes \\"spandrels\\" after an architectural feature. Later, Gould and Elisabeth Vrba discussed the acquisition of new functions by novel structures arising in this fashion, calling them \\"exaptations.\\" Molecular data regarding the mechanisms underlying development accumulated rapidly during the 1980s and 1990s. It became clear that the diversity of animal morphology was not the result of different sets of proteins regulating the development of different animals, but from changes in the deployment of a small set of proteins that were common to all animals. These proteins became known as the \\"developmental-genetic toolkit.\\" Such perspectives influenced the disciplines of phylogenetics, paleontology and comparative developmental biology, and spawned the new discipline of evolutionary developmental biology also known as evo-devo. * 21st century Macroevolution and microevolution One of the tenets of population genetics since its inception has been that macroevolution (the evolution of phylogenic clades at the species level and above) was solely the result of the mechanisms of microevolution (changes in gene frequency within populations) operating over an extended period of time. During the last decades of the 20th century some paleontologists raised questions about whether other factors, such as punctuated equilibrium and group selection operating on the level of entire species and even higher level phylogenic clades, needed to be considered to explain patterns in evolution revealed by statistical analysis of the fossil record. Near the end of the 20th century some researchers in evolutionary developmental biology suggested that interactions between the environment and the developmental process might have been the source of some of the structural innovations seen in macroevolution, but other evo-devo researchers maintained that genetic mechanisms visible at the population level are fully sufficient to explain all macroevolution. Epigenetic inheritance Epigenetics is the study of heritable changes in gene expression or cellular phenotype caused by mechanisms other than changes in the underlying DNA sequence. By the first decade of the 21st century it had become accepted that epigenetic mechanisms were a necessary part of the evolutionary origin of cellular differentiation. Although epigenetics in multicellular organisms is generally thought to be a mechanism involved in differentiation, with epigenetic patterns \\"reset\\" when organisms reproduce, there have been some observations of transgenerational epigenetic inheritance. This shows that in some cases nongenetic changes to an organism can be inherited and it has been suggested that such inheritance can help with adaptation to local conditions and affect evolution. Some have suggested that in certain cases a form of Lamarckian evolution may occur. Extended evolutionary syntheses The idea of an extended evolutionary synthesis is to extend the 20th century modern synthesis to include concepts and mechanisms such as multilevel selection theory, transgenerational epigenetic inheritance, niche construction and evolvability‚Äîthough several different such syntheses have been proposed, with no agreement on what exactly would be included. Unconventional evolutionary theory Omega Point Pierre Teilhard de Chardin's metaphysical Omega Point theory, found in his book The Phenomenon of Man (1955), * describes the gradual development of the universe from subatomic particles to human society, which he viewed as its final stage and goal, a form of orthogenesis. Gaia hypothesis The Gaia hypothesis proposed by James Lovelock holds that the living and nonliving parts of Earth can be viewed as a complex interacting system with similarities to a single organism, as being connected to Lovelock's ideas. The Gaia hypothesis has also been viewed by Lynn Margulis and others as an extension of endosymbiosis and exosymbiosis. This modified hypothesis postulates that all living things have a regulatory effect on the Earth's environment that promotes life overall. Self-organization The mathematical biologist Stuart Kauffman has suggested that self-organization may play roles alongside natural selection in three areas of evolutionary biology, namely population dynamics, molecular evolution, and morphogenesis. However, Kauffman does not take into account the essential role of energy (for example, using pyrophosphate) in driving biochemical reactions in cells, as proposed by Christian DeDuve and modelled mathematically by Richard Bagley and Walter Fontana. Their systems are self-catalyzing but not simply self-organizing as they are thermodynamically open systems relying on a continuous input of energy.

Biography Born in Norland, near Sowerby Bridge, Yorkshire in 1958, Holden emigrated from England to New Zealand with his family in 1973. He was the most successful of all Ducati Supermono racers. In 1994 Holden placed second in the Isle of Man TT, then returned to the 1995 Isle of Man TT to win the singles title. Holden also won in Ireland's North West 200 Supermono class in 1995. Holden died the following year in practice at the Isle of Man TT while riding a Ducati 916. Holden would ride up to four different machines stepping off his Superbike onto a 250 Production machine then straight onto a 600 sports production bike followed by 15 laps and his Rotax 250 GP bike, it seemed at the time that Holden's only rest was during the sidecar race although he did passenger for Kevin Maxwell for a season of road racing on one. . He was helped early on in his career by Steve Dundon from Wellington Motorcycle Centre the combination of Dundon's experience and technical skills and Holden's hard riding led to many NZ titles. One of Holden's more famous exploits was known as \\"The Holden Sign\\" incident. This happened at the Manfeild Autocourse in Feilding. While leading the Open Production Race on his 1135 GSX Suzuki, he crashed at 200 km/h, the bike slid and cartwheeled through a large sign advertising \\"Holden\\" cars. The whole incident was televised and was shown on the 6 o'clock news. Holden was unhurt and walked back to the pits to the applause of the crowd. Later on in his career, Holden teamed up with retired Ducati racer turned team manager Dallas Rankine. The BMS team supplied Holden with four-valve Ducati 916 motorcycles and a Ducati Supermono. Some of New Zealand's best racing was seen during the early nineties between Holden on the Ducati and Andrew Stroud on the famous Britten V1000. Holden's death at the Isle of Man in 1996 was a devastating loss for New Zealand racing. Dallas Rankine withdrew from all professional involvement in racing after losing his rider and close friend. The Robert Holden Memorial feature race at the famous Cemetery Circuit meeting in Wanganui, New Zealand is named in his honour.

His 46-year broadcasting career also included work in Iowa and Minnesota, before he spent eight years as an announcer and classical music DJ for KVNO radio in Omaha. During his time at WOWT, Munson saw at first hand the devastation caused by the 1975 Omaha tornado, which caused particularly serious damage to his own neighborhood. The following year Munson was the victim of a violent attack in the station's lobby, where a woman who had asked to see him stabbed his cheek and arm with a knife. The injuries required hospital treatment, and the attacker was temporarily institutionalized. Munson retired in 1991, but he was chosen by NOAA Weather Radio to present a program on the Omaha tornado's 25th anniversary in 2000, and he has continued to appear at Omaha public events. He received a lifetime achievement award from the University of Nebraska at Omaha's Department of Communication in 2000, and was named a member of the Nebraska Radio Personalities Hall of Fame in 2004.

Of particular interest are the effects of disturbance (fires, succession, weather events and climate change) on these basic processes. Additional research questions involve the detection of plant physiology, ecosystem function, species composition, and biodiversity using non-contact sampling methods. Much of this work is done with optical monitoring (remote sensing and automated field methods), and entails the development of new monitoring methods and related informatics tools. To encourage wider usage of these methods, Gamon co-founded SpecNet, (Spectral Network), a network of collaborating sites and investigators using optical sampling methods (particularly spectral reflectance) to study ecological questions.

Biography Baumgarten studied theology at the University of Halle, and in 1728 the 22-year-old Baumgarten, a Hallensian Pietist and bibliophile, was appointed as minister of the \\"Marktkirche Unser Lieben Frauen\\" (Market Church of Our Dear Lady). In 1730 he became an associate professor at Halle, where in 1734 he was appointed a full professor of theology. In 1748 he was named as university rector. At the end of his life he translated encyclopedic articles and biographies from English into German. Baumgarten was a follower of the philosophical teachings of Christian Wolff (1679-1754), and is regarded as a transitional theologian from the Pietism of Philipp Jakob Spener (1635-1705) and August Hermann Francke (1663-1727) to that of modern rationalism. He was a prodigious writer and published works on exegesis, hermeneutics, dogmatics and history.

They may be deployed anywhere in the United States for resource benefits (fire use), prescribed fire and hazard fuel reduction projects. As inter-agency national resource personnel, fire use modules have expertise in the areas of fire monitoring, ignition, holding and suppression, prescribed fire preparation and implementation support, hazard fuels reduction, and fire effects monitoring. Fire use modules are funded by different US government agencies including the National Park Service, USDA Forest Service, and the Bureau of Land Management. The Nature Conservancy is the sole non-government entity to sponsor and support a Fire Use Module.Feature article, Where We Work  History  In 1995 the US National Park Service (USNPS) founded fire use modules and hosted them in five different park units across the United States: Bandalier NM, Saguaro NP, Whisky town NRA, Zion NP, and Yellowstone NP. In 1999 the USMPS created four more modules; Black Hills FUM, Cumberland Gap FUM, Great Smokes FUM, and Buffalo River FUM.USNPS Announcement Checking a map showing the area of a planned burn.The modules were developed with the primary purpose of assisting the National Park units with fire use (wildland fire use and prescribed fire), meeting the objectives of the agency in the areas of project preparation and execution with narrow burn prescription windows. Secondarily the modules were intended to be used in monitoring fire effects, and manually reducing hazard fuels on various park units. Modules were also anticipated to be used to assist other agencies in fire use and fuels treatment projects when all the park unit objectives were met.FUM Ops Guide Other modules came into existence as the use and flexibility of fire use modules became more apparent. Most notable of these fire use modules includes those on the Stanislaus National Forest (Calvarase FUM, Summit FUM, etc.), The Ashley National Forest (Flaming Gorge WFM, Kings Peak WFM), The Bureau of Land Managements Unaweep WFM and The Nature Conservancy's Southern Rockies.http://www.nature.org/wherewework/northamerica/states/colorado/features/art25387.html Since 2005, The U.S. Department of Agriculture (Forest Service) has also implemented the use of fire use modules (known as wildland fire modules) as well throughout the country. As of 2010 there were 17 wildland fire modules in the United States.

Umpierre-Herrera works on the topics of activism and social equality, the immigrant experience and bilingualism in the United States, and Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender (LGBT) issues. Umpierre has published ten poetry books and has had numerous essays published in academic journals. Life Luz Mar√≠a Umpierre was born in Santurce, Puerto Rico, in 1947, and grew up in a working-class neighborhood called \\"La veintiuna\\" (Stop 21) in a household with sixteen people. Her mother was born in Puerto Rico and grew up in New York City; for this reason, Umpierre was exposed to English and Spanish as a child. Her father was a government worker. Umpierre studied at the Sacred Heart Academy and at the Universidad del Sagrado Coraz√≥n, both in Puerto Rico, graduating from both with honors. After several years of teaching at the Academia Mar√≠a Reina in San Juan, Umpierre felt that she was in \\"sexile.\\" The prejudice she experienced as an open lesbian in the island was one of the contributing factors to her moving to the mainland in 1974. As she followed her academic path, she was shocked to see that in the United States it wasn't just her sexual orientation that was prejudiced against, but also her Puerto Rican origin and ethnicity. These experiences made her decide to mentor underprivileged and exiled students, American-born like her and immigrant alike. Education and career She earned her B.A., with honors, in Spanish and Humanities from the Universidad del Sagrado Coraz√≥n in 1970. In 1976, she received her M.A. in Spanish (Caribbean Literature) from Bryn Mawr College in Pennsylvania, where we also completed her Ph.D. in Spanish (1978). She has also completed Post Doctoral Studies in the Fields of: Literary Theory at the University of Kansas (1981-1982), University Administration (Recruitment and Retention of Minorities) as a State of New Jersey/Woodrow Wilson International Center Fellow (1986), and Management and Policy at the New School for Social Research, Milano School-Syracuse Campus (1995-1996). After receiving her Ph.D. in 1978, Umpierre went on to teach at several institutions. She was the first Puerto Rican to receive tenure at the Department of Spanish and Portuguese at Rutgers University, where she taught the very first graduate level course on Colonial Latin American Literature. She also created the first courses on Caribbean Literature and Culture at Rutgers University, as well as one of the first courses on Latinas in the U.S. to be taught in the country.She was the first openly Lesbian Latina Scholar in Residence in Women Studies at Penn State University. Her presence as an open lesbian Latina academic at Rutgers was met with a conservative backlash. She was banned in 1989 from teaching at the university for her inclusion of Gay and Lesbian texts in her literature classes and after she spoke at the March on Washington, DC of 1987. This setback only reinforced her activism regarding LGBT Studies, as she's continued to be an activist for the inclusion of LGBT topics in academia. After leaving Rutgers, she worked as Head and Professor of the Department of Modern Languages and Intercultural Studies and Folklore at the Western Kentucky University (WKU). It was while working at WKU, that Umpierre received the \\"Woman of the Year\\" award. She continued to work with the underprivileged and societal outcasts. In 1992, she became a faculty member at the State University of New York ‚ÄìBrockport (SUNY) and was a Professor of Foreign Languages and Literatures. Again, she was met with academic backlash for her activism in LGBT rights. In 1992, she was accused by SUNY of \\"exposing students to homosexuality\\" for teaching literature from a Homocriticism view and was suspended for two years. She subsequently became homeless, yet continued her work as an advocate for equality in academia. Umpierre eventually relocated to Bates College in Lewiston, Maine, where she was an Associate Professor for Classic and Romance Languages and Literatures, along with Women Studies in 1998. She expanded the curriculum of this university as well, to include adding courses dealing with Latina Literature and Culture, Creative Writing, and Latin American Studies. She eventually left Bates College of her own choosing in 2002 to nurture her writing career and continue in promoting activist causes. Poetry Umpierre has published six books of poetry and two chapbooks or \\"hojas po√©ticas.\\" She has received critical attention, particularly from women, feminist and queer scholars.La Fountain- Stokes, Lawrence.

New York: Garland Publishing, 1996. Umpierre is a bilingual poet who writes in English and Spanish and sometimes mixes both languages in the same poem.Aparicio, Frances. \\"La Vida es un Spanglish Disparatero: Bilingualism in Nuyorican Poetry.\\" In European Perspectives on Hispanic Literature in the United States, ed.

Her work was published by tatiana de la tierra in de la tierra's bilingual magazine, Esto no tiene nombre, for Latina lesbians. She also supported de la tierra's other magazine, conmoci√≥n, which was a continuation and expansion of esto meant to be a platform for conversation about Latina lesbians through publishing work like Umpierre's.De La Tierra, Tatiana. \\"Activist Latina Lesbian Publishing: esto no tiene nombre and conmoci√≥n.\\" I am Aztldn: The Personal Essay in Chicano Studies, ed. Chon A. Noriega and Wendy Belcher (Los Angeles: UCLA Chicano Studies Research Center Press, 2004) 194. In her work, she establishes a conversation with many American, Latin American, and Puerto Rican women poets and writers such as Sylvia Plath, Virginia Woolf, Sor Juana In√©s de la Cruz, Julia de Burgos, and Sandra Mar√≠a Esteves. Noted among these is the poetical exchange she carried for years with Nuyorican minor poet Sandra Mar√≠a Esteves; this exchange was lauded in Europe and the US and was included in a special radio program of the MLA because of its uniqueness. Umpierre started out her poetry career with the publication of Una puertorrique√±a en Penna (1979), whose title can be translated as \\"A Puerto Rican woman in Pennsylvania\\" or \\"A Puerto Rican woman in pain.\\" In this book, the author offers poems that comment on the discrimination that the Puerto Rican community faced in Philadelphia. The final poem in that collection: \\"Mascarada la vida\\", signals towards the lesbian themes which she would develop further in other collections. Umpierre also comments on the prejudice against Puerto Ricans in institutions of higher education, particularly in Spanish departments that judged Puerto Rican Spanish as deficient or incorrect. She also explores these topics in her second and third books, En el pa√≠s de las maravillas (Kempis puertorrique√±o) (1982) and . . . Y otras desgracias/And Other Misfortunes. . . (1985), which shows a marked turn towards more bilingualism and carries openly Lesbian poems. The same book was included as an Stonewall Era publication. One of Umpierre's books is The Margarita Poems (1987), where she discusses her lesbianism and offers highly erotic poems about lesbian love. The book also discusses issues of feminist sisterhood, Puerto Rican independence, and immigrant experience. In the 1990s, she published her book For Christine (1995). In the 2000s, she published two chapbooks or \\"hojas po√©ticas\\": Pour toi/For Moira (2005) and Our Only Island‚Äîfor Nemir (2009). A volume of her complete works edited by Carmen S. Rivera and Daniel Torres was published in 2011.Umpierre, Luz Mar√≠a. I'm Still Standing: Treinta a√±os de poes√≠a/Thirty Years of Poetry, eds. Carmen S. Rivera and Daniel Torres. [Orlando and Fredonia,FL,NY]: SUNY: Fredonia, 2011. Scholarship Umpierre has published two books of literary criticism focusing on Puerto Rican literature and numerous critical articles mostly on Caribbean literature and women authors. She is one of the few people who has written on Nemir Matos' poems. She is advances a \\"homocritical\\" theory of reading, which she labels as \\"Homocriticism\\", suggesting that homosexual readers can be more attuned to perceiving hidden queer meaning in a literary work. Her first article on this subject, appeared in Collages & Bricolages in 1993 under the title \\"On Critical Diversity\\" and dealt with the book Fragmentos a su im√°n by Jos√© Lezama Lima although it was written in the early 1980s and taught at Rutgers University in Graduate Seminars during that decade. She developed her ideas further on this topic in an article on Carmen Lugo Filippi's short story \\"Milagros, calle Mercurio\\" [Milagros, Mercury Street].Umpierre, Luz Mar√≠a. \\"Lesbian Tantalizing in Carmen Lugo Filippi's 'Milagros, calle Mercurio'\\" which was presented at the MLA in the early 1980s also and later published in ¬øEntiendes?

It was separated from the village of Brighton by a creek. These two villages were connected to other settlements such as Albion and Strongville by the Cleveland and Columbus road.  History  It was founded in 1812 by James Fish and became the first settlement west of the Cuyahoga River. Two years later, around 200 people lived at Brooklyn Centre. Of mixed heritage today, the original settlers of the area were Connecticut residents who had purchased land from investors of the Connecticut Western Reserve. By 1812, Brooklyn Centre became a township. German immigrants moved in starting in the late 19th century They were followed by the Polish and the Irish by the early 20th century who settled at the eastern end of Brooklyn Centre. These new settlers relocated to the area so that they would be close to the factories in and around the Cuyahoga River such as the tanneries and steel mills. In the early 1960s the neighborhood was changed dramatically with the construction of I-71. Entire streets were lost and new cul-de-sacs and dead ends were created, changing the fabric of the neighborhood. In 1984, the City of Cleveland created the Brooklyn Centre Historic District, recognizing the location's historic and architectural importance. In November 2004, The Brooklyn Centre Historical Society published Reflections from Brooklyn Centre: Presentations and Oral Histories from The Brooklyn Centre Historical Society. In November 2008, Brooklyn Centre became a National Wildlife Federation registered Community Wildlife Habitat Site, and was among the very first city neighborhoods to obtain the designation. The eastern portion of Brooklyn Centre is known as Barbarowa. Brooklyn Centre is bordered on the east by the Cuyahoga River I-176/The Jennings Freeway. The west border is I-71. The border to the south is Big Creek which runs through the Cleveland Metroparks Zoo and is the largest tributary that flows into the Cuyahoga. The northern border is a city street named Trowbridge.

He gave up filmmaking in the 1990s as he felt systematically excluded from the state support programs of the Portuguese Ministry of Culture, the only financial source for film production in Portugal in that time. As a consequence, he dedicated himself entirely to writing, investigation and teaching. He published several books, essays, philosophy and fiction. Biography Filmmaker Macedo was born in Lisbon, where he graduated in architecture at the ESBAL (Escola Superior de Belas-Artes), the Faculty of Fine Arts, in 1958. From then until 1964, he worked as an architect in the Town Hall of Lisbon. He abandoned his architect career in 1964 to devote himself to filmmaking as director and scriptwriter. He also dedicated to literature and research in the fields of religion and spirituality. He specialized in the history and Sociology of Esoteric Christianity. In 2010 he earned a doctor's degree summa cum laude in Sociology of Culture (in the field of Sociology of Religion), at the Nova University of Lisbon. As a filmmaker, he was one of the pioneers of the Portuguese Cinema Novo and one of the founder members of the first film cooperative societies in Portugal, the \\"Centro Portugu√™s de Cinema\\" (1970). He started his career as a film director with his avant-garde short film Ver√£o Coincidente [Coincident Summer] and Nicotiana (1963). These films were noticed by the producers Francisco de Castro and Ant√≥nio da Cunha Telles, who invited Macedo to direct his first feature film, Domingo √† Tarde [Sunday Afternoon], 1965, which was selected for the Venice Film Festival of that year. During the prime minister Ant√≥nio de Oliveira Salazar and later of Marcello Caetano dictatorship, Macedo's movies were almost always at odds with the Portuguese censorship, specially Domingo √† Tarde [Sunday Afternoon] and A Promessa [The Vow], which were seriously affected by censors. Nojo aos C√£es [Even Curs Feel Disgust] was totally forbidden. Nevertheless, A Promessa had a good reception at the Cannes Film Festival and it won the first prize at the Cartagena Film Festival. Nojo aos C√£es was selected for the Bergamo Film Festival, had good reviews and a final nomination for the first prize as well. At the Benalm√°dena Film Festival it won the prestigious \\"FICC Award\\" (annual film prize of the \\"F√©d√©ration Internationale des Cin√©-Clubs\\"). Just before the Carnation Revolution in 1974, Macedo founded in that same year, together with other filmmakers, a new cooperative film production company, Cinequanon. There he worked as a director until 1996. His latest film made with this new film company was Santo Ant√≥nio de Todo o Mundo [Saint Anthony of the Whole World], shot in 1996. After the fall of the dictatorial regime of Salazar / Caetano in 1974, Macedo worked intensively in many television films and TV series: films \\"engag√©s\\", political cinema denouncing the crimes committed by the former dictatorship. Meanwhile, he kept on making full-length pictures, such as O Princ√≠pio da Sabedoria [The Principle of Wisdom] or As Horas de Maria [Twelve Hours with Maria]. This last one, when released in 1979 was hardly attacked by the Portuguese Catholic Church under the charge of \\"blasphemy\\" and \\"moral and religious outrage\\". His next feature, Os Abismos da Meia-Noite [The Magic Springs of Gerenia], was a box office hit in Portugal, and won three national film awards: \\"Best Portuguese Film\\", \\"Best Script\\" and \\"Best Sound Design,\\" and also \\"Best Actor\\" at the Rimini Film Festival. Ch√° Forte com Lim√£o [Black Tea With Lemon] was his last feature. Notwithstanding his extensive and original filmography, and in spite of the cultural trend of his cinema, Macedo's applications to get support from the film financing programs of the Portuguese Ministry of Culture were systematically rejected. When asked about the reasons why his film projects were so ill-regarded by the juries, some jurors would state that the negative verdicts were consequence of a \\"uninteresting cinema\\", \\"detached from reality\\", \\"fanciful and too much whimsical\\" (See as reference the interviewhttps://web.archive.org/web/20090524223101/http://spautores.pt/Revista.aspx?idCat=234&idMasterCat;=67&idContent;=880&idLayout;=7 published at the magazine of the Portuguese Authors Society). They alluded to the genre of most of Macedo's movies, which include weird elements, magic fantasy, dark fantasy, science-fiction and so on. Without being able to go on filming, Macedo went on along with his other specializations, namely investigating and teaching film theory, film aesthetics, speculative fiction as well as comparative religion, spirituality, history of religion, sociology of religion, esoterology. He died in Lisbon, aged 86. Teacher and writer After 1996, Macedo devoted himself exclusively to literature and to university teaching . Alongside his career of motion-picture director, Macedo has also applied himself to teaching: since 1970 until 1974 he was a teacher in \\"Theory and Workshops of Film Direction\\" at the INP Institute (Lisbon), and until 1990 he taught \\"Cinema Aesthetics\\" and \\"Visual Semiotics\\" at the IADE Institute (\\"College of Fine Arts and Design,\\" in Lisbon). After 1994 he was a professor of \\"Visual Semiotics\\" at the Lus√≥fona University (Lisbon), and of \\"Filmic Language\\" and \\"Scriptwriting\\" at the Moderna University of Lisbon. From 2002 on, and at present, he is a professor of \\"Biblical Studies\\" and \\"Esoterology\\" at the Nova University of Lisbon. literature and essays Macedo implied himself in writing and publishing novels, all of them of science-fiction and fantasy, pervaded by a Gothic and often magic atmosphere. Referring to Macedo's novels A Sonata de Cristal [The Crystal Sonata], Contos do Androthelys [Tales of the Androthelys], and others, the Portuguese scholar Teresa Sousa de Almeida, a Professor of Literature at Nova University of Lisbon, states: > Mixing SF with fantastic literature, Antonio de Macedo presents us with a > strange and disturbing world, in which irony is always present. [. . .] Also > surprising is the transfiguration that the real world sees itself going > through when it is affected by the strangeness of a different reality. In > the fantastic universe of Antonio de Macedo, the real world merely provides > a set of signs which can only be deciphered with a key coming from another > universe, to which only a few people have access. Thus, the reading of his > works becomes an initiatory process in which the reader seeks out the occult > truth hidden behind the story.Teresa Sousa de Almeida, 'Science Fiction in > Portugal: The Drawing up of a Territory‚Äô, in: Maria Augusta, Antonio de > Macedo (eds.), Frontiers: On the Edge of the Empire, stories by Portuguese > and English authors. Cascais: Simetria FC&F;, 1999, pp. 20‚Äì21. ‚Äî See also: > Gardner Dozois (ed.), The Year's Best Science Fiction: Sixteenth Annual > Collection, New York: St. Martin's Griffin, 1999; p. xxxvii. He also wrote essays on religion and Christian esotericism. One of them, Esoterismo da B√≠blia [Esotericism of the Bible], is a treatise on Biblical esotericism which includes the lessons (from 2002 through 2006) of the course on \\"Biblical Esoterology\\" which Macedo taught at the Faculty of Human and Social Sciences (Nova University of Lisbon). This book deals with the conditions surrounding the birth, rise and fast expansion of Christianity in its early manifold currents, esoteric and exoteric, and its numberless manifestations, either official or marginal, in present times: > Its author, with his discreet and accessible erudition, explains the > connections between the ancient texts and their historical, philosophical > and religious antecedents, as well as their connection with the Mysteries, > ancient and modern.Helena Barbas, ‚ÄòLeituras de Ver√£o‚Äô, in: Expresso: Actual, > no. 1761, July 29, 2006; p. 6. Macedo's doctorate dissertation is a comprehensive research on sociology of culture, sociology of religion and on esoterology of the New Testament texts, and was published in 2011 with the title Cristianismo Inici√°tico [Christianity and Initiation]. In a dense volume of 663 pages Macedo makes a deep study of the History and Sociology of the biblical texts, discussing especially the highest importance of the esoteric and heterodox interpretations of the Bible, and respective authors and currents since the production of the ancient biblical texts until today, and the profound significance of those interpretations to the development of mentality, culture, and science of the western civilisation.

The district covers of land, including the villages of Morrow, Butlerville, and Maineville, Hamilton Township , and other townships. Little Miami Schools has raised media attention in recent years for being the only school district in southwestern Ohio to fall under ‚Äúfiscal emergency‚Äù designation from the Ohio Department of Education. Despite its financial woes, Little Miami has maintained its ‚Äúabove- average‚Äù rating from the Ohio Department of Education for the past three years. The Little Miami Local School District consists of Little Miami High School, Little Miami Junior High School, Little Miami Intermediate School, Salem Township Elementary School (grades K, 3, 4), Harlan-Butlerville Primary School and Hamilton-Maineville Primary School. Little Miami Preschool is located within Salem Township Elementary School. History The Little Miami School District was formed in 1954 after the residents of the Butlerville, Maineville and Morrow school districts agreed to consolidate. Emery Bethel was named as the district's first superintendent. A bond issue was soon passed to build a new central high school on Welch Road in Morrow, Ohio, and the class of 1957 was the first to graduate from the new building. Until that time, the existing Morrow Elementary building had served as the area's high school. Dedicated in 1914, the original Morrow building housed grades 1-12. To fund its construction, the Morrow Board of Education passed a resolution on Oct. 14, 1913, to place a $40,000 bond issue on the ballot. The bond issue passed by a vote of 96 for, 93 against. It would be more than 40 years before another stand-alone school building was constructed in Little Miami. In November 1997, voters approved a 5.44 mill, 27-year bond issue that would raise $17.6 million for the purpose constructing a new high school building. The new Little Miami High School was dedicated in 2000. Around this time, the district entered into a period of unprecedented growth. Beginning with the 2001-2002 school year, the district grew by 200 students on average for the next seven years, with student enrollment rising from 2,826 in 2001-2002, to 4,313 in 2008-2009. In response to this growth, the district created a five-year facility use plan that called for the continued operation of ‚Äúneighborhood‚Äù schools in Butlerville, Morrow and Maineville, while planning for the construction of a new intermediate and new junior high facilities. This plan set out to alleviate overcrowding in the former high school building on Welch Road that was serving as an intermediate/junior high complex, and to house anticipated future growth. In May 2006, voters approved a 6.15 mill bond issue to fund facility improvements at Morrow, Harlan-Butlerville and Hamilton-Maineville Elementaries and to construct a new intermediate school and a new junior high school. Little Miami Intermediate School, built on donated land at the corner of Zoar and Stephens Road in Hamilton Township and Little Miami Junior High School, built contiguous to the high school, were both dedicated in 2009 and opened to students. After another six years of unprecedented enrollment growth, in May, 2018, voters approved a $64.6 million bond issue to construct a new preK-1 building, and additions to the high school, junior high and intermediate school. Financial Issues In July 2007, a new two-year state budget was released that changed the formula that the state used to fund public schools. As a result, Little Miami lost $6 million in projected state revenue that year. The following year financial and credit markets crashed, plunging the national economy into recession and affecting the local community's ability to financially support its schools. Despite the economic downturn, Little Miami continued to grow rapidly in student population. In October, 2008, net enrollment increased by 335 students over the previous school year. Decreased funding coupled with increased student enrollment forced the district to begin looking at a combination of budget cuts and ballot issues to remain solvent. In November, 2008, voters rejected a one- percent earnings tax to fund schools, launching a string of eight levy defeats for Little Miami. The failed issues were: * May 2009 ‚Äì 9.95 mill, three-year property tax * November 2009 ‚Äì 7.95 mill, five-year incremental property tax * February 2010 ‚Äì 16.95 mill, five-year property tax * May 2010 ‚Äì 6.48 mill, five-year property tax and a one-percent, five-year earnings tax * November 2010 ‚Äì 10.95 mill, five-year incremental property tax * May 2011 ‚Äì 13.95 mill, five-year property tax State Takeover Following the November 2009 ballot defeat, Little Miami Local Schools were placed in state-designated ‚Äúfiscal caution.‚Äù Fiscal caution is the first of level of state oversight for schools with actual or projected fiscal deficits that trigger corrective assistance from the Ohio Department of Education. After the February, 2010 defeat, the district was placed in ‚Äúfiscal watch‚Äù and was projecting an $5 million shortfall by the end of the fiscal year. After the May 2010 ballot defeat, the district was placed in ‚Äúfiscal emergency.‚Äù In July 2010, a state-appointed fiscal planning and supervision commission convened its first meeting in Little Miami. This commission, provided for in the Ohio Revised Code, supersedes the local board of education, and has the power to review all district finances, the power to approve or reject actions taken by the local board and the power to create and enforce a district recovery plan to regain solvency. The district received its first solvency assistance loan from the state in December 2010 in the amount of $5,071,000 to cover its budget shortfall for the remainder of the fiscal year. A second loan payment of $5,952,000 was received in July 2010, resulting in a total of more than $11 million in no-interest loans the district would be required to pay back into the solvency assistance fund in two years. During the course of Little Miami's financial spiral downward, the district cut 105 positions, cut approximately $10 million from its operating budget, closed Morrow and Harlan-Butlerville Elementary Schools, cut art, music and physical education classes at the elementary school level, reduced bus service to state minimums, instated athletics pay-to-participate fees of $651 per student per sport, reduced course offerings at the high school and eliminated community use of buildings due to staff shortages. The media consistently covered Little Miami's financial woes during this period and the district's nine trips to the ballot box. Local newspapers and television crews ran numerous stories on the cuts the district had instituted and were on hand each election night to capture the latest results. Of particular interest was the nearly 50-50 split of ‚Äúyes‚Äù and ‚Äúno‚Äù voters in the district. Little Miami also gained national attention from the Wall Street Journal and from educational trade magazines as many parties wished to study what happened when a community cannot or will not choose to support its schools financially. In 2011, as part of the district's recovery plan, the fiscal planning and supervision commission required Little Miami to begin operating at state minimum standards. These included reducing graduation requirements to 20 hours from 24, and increasing student teacher ratios. The commission also directed the district to close Maineville Elementary School and to place a levy on the November 2011 ballot. Financial Recovery After nine similar attempts, a 13.95 mill, five-year property tax passed by a margin of 74 votes in November 2011. Voter approval of this measure allowed the district to begin planning for repaying its solvency assistance loan and for restoring a handful of services. In February, 2012, the Little Miami Local School Board approved a reconfiguration plan that would restore full busing services, return half-day, every day kindergarten, re-open Harlan-Butlerville and Hamilton-Maineville Elementaries and the return of art, music and physical education in grades K-8. The state fiscal planning and supervision commission rejected this plan at its February meeting, but then reversed its decision in March 2012. On April 17, 2012, the Little Miami Local School Board approved a measure to reduce pay-to-participate fees to $350 per student per sport at the high school level and $275 per student per sport at the junior high level. The fiscal planning and supervision commission approved the same measure on April 24, 2012. On May 22, 2013, the state Fiscal Planning and Supervision Commission voted to release Little Miami Local Schools from fiscal emergency and also voted to disband, ending 34 months of state oversight of district operations. By the end of the 2014 fiscal year, the district will have repaid a total of $11 million in solvency assistance loans and will be free of that debt.

An urban planner may focus on a specific area of practice and have a title such as city planner, town planner, regional planner, long-range planner, transportation planner, infrastructure planner, environmental planner, parks planner, physical planner, health planner, planning analyst, urban designer, community development director, economic development specialist or other similar combinations. An international association of planning professionals - ISOCARP - was established in 1965 in the Netherlands and currently has about 700 members in more than 80 countries.  Responsibilities  The responsibilities of an urban planner vary between jurisdictions, and sometimes within jurisdictions. The following is therefore a general description of the responsibilities of an urban planner, of which an urban planner may well typically practise two or more of. An urban planner may also specialize in one responsibility only. Land use planning Urban planners specializing in land use planning are predominantly concerned with the regulation of land use, development and subdivision, with the intent of achieving the desired urban planning outcome. Regulation of land use and development is achieved via the drafting and adoption of planning instruments designed to influence the land use and built form goals of the jurisdiction. The planning instruments take the form of legislation and policy, and have a wide variety of terms across jurisdictions including acts and regulations, rules, codes, schemes, plans, policies, and manuals; and often a combination of some of these. The planning instruments often spatially zone land or reserve the land for certain purposes, presented in the form of a zoning map or plan. The urban planner is tasked with preparing planning instruments and zoning plans. Further, given urban development is rarely static and the goals of urban planning change from time to time, the urban planner will be responsible for continuously maintaining planning instruments and zoning plans to ensure they are kept up-to-date. Consultation with the community and other stakeholders is generally desired by urban planners in most jurisdictions when planning instruments are prepared and updated. The level of consultation will vary depending on the project. The urban planner will also be responsible for implementing the planning instruments. This is achieved through a permit process, where the proponent of a proposed development, a change in land use, or the proposed subdivision of an allotment will be required to obtain a permit, approval, licence, or consent for the proposed development or change of use. An urban planner will be tasked with considering the proposal and determining whether it complies with the intent and the specific provisions of the applicable planning instruments and zoning plans. Depending on the jurisdiction, the urban planner may have authority to determine the proposal; otherwise the planner will present a recommendation to the decision-maker, often a panel of non-planners (for example, the elected council of a local government). While concerned with future development, an urban planner will occasionally be responsible for investigating development or land use which had been undertaken without authorization. In many jurisdictions urban planners can require that unauthorized land use cease and unauthorized development is returned to its predevelopment condition; or alternatively retrospectively approve the unauthorized development or land use. Strategic urban planning In order to plan effectively for long term development and growth, an urban planner will be responsible for the preparation of a strategic plan (also known in different jurisdictions by names such as development plan, core strategy, comprehensive plan, planning strategy, structure plan, etc.). Strategic urban planning sets the high-level goals and growth principles for a jurisdiction, which will in turn inform the preparation and amendment of the legal planning instruments within that jurisdiction. Regional planning Regional planning deals with the planning of land use, infrastructure and settlement growth over a geographical area which extends to a whole city or beyond. In this sense, the urban planner's role is to consider urban planning at a macro scale. Regional planning is not concerned with planning at the local (neighborhood) level. Heritage and conservation An urban planner may be responsible for identifying, protecting and conserving / restoring buildings and places which are identified by a community as having cultural heritage significance. This may include the task of compiling and maintaining a heritage register, finding and making available incentives for encouraging conservation works, and the consideration of proposals to redevelop or use a heritage-listed place. Urban Revitalization As urban areas decline, an urban planner may be tasked with preparing a plan for the redevelopment of an urban area. Such plans are not limited to an individual development site, but rather encompass a locality or district over which an urban redevelopment plan is prepared. Urban revitalization often relies on obtaining funding from government sources to assist in the regeneration of an area; the funding may be used for a variety of purposes such as improvement of public roads, parks and other public spaces, development of infrastructure, and acquisition of land. The urban planner will be responsible for costing an urban revitalization plan and obtaining funding for infrastructure works necessary to implement the urban renewal plan. The urban planner for an urban revitalization project will need to liaise closely with stakeholders during the preparation and implementation of the plan, including government agencies, landowners and community groups. Master planning A master plan will be prepared for many greenfield development projects. The purpose of a master plan is to plan for the ultimate spatial layout of the land uses for a future development area. A master plan will consider the required infrastructure to service the development and determine the need and location of urban amenities including commercial and industrial land, community facilities, schools, parks, public transport, major roads, and land uses, both within and outside the master plan area, and consider the staging of development of a master planned area. The urban planner will be responsible for coordinating the various professional consultant inputs, and to lay out the master plan infrastructure and land uses. It will often be necessary for the urban planner to consult with landowners and government agencies affected by the master plan. Transportation planning An urban planner may be responsible for planning for transport facilities and infrastructure in urban and inter-regional areas. Economic development An urban planner's responsibility may extend to economic development. In this sense, an urban planner may be responsible for identifying opportunities for economic growth, and encourage investment in an area. Environmental planning An urban planner may be concerned with the impact of land use, development and subdivision on the natural environment including land, water, flora, and fauna, to achieve sustainable outcomes. Urban design An urban planner will develop the design of public spaces (streets, squares, parks, etc.) and the relationship between built form and public spaces. Depending on the country and planner's training they may work with other design professionals such as civil engineers, architects or landscape architects to complete and construct the design. Infrastructure planning An urban planner may be required to plan for the future provision of public works infrastructure such as water supply, sewerage, electricity, telecommunications, and transport infrastructure, and community infrastructure including schools, hospitals and parks. Education and training See Urban planning education for a discussion of this topic. Urban Planning as a profession is a relatively young discipline. Few government agencies restrict or license the profession. As a result, a number of other related disciplines actively claim to have the training, expertise and professional scope to practise urban planning. While organizations such as the American Planning Association, the Canadian Institute of Planners and the Royal Town Planning Institute certify professional planners, others in related fields like Landscape Architecture also claim to have professional autonomy in urban planning. Efforts internationally have attempted to define the role of urban planners through licensure acts. The State of New Jersey licenses Professional Planners. The Canadian Provinces of Ontario and Alberta protect the title of Registered Professional Planner to only those who have an accredited CIP education and experience or equivalent. Urban planners by nation Canada Urban planners in Canada usually hold bachelor's degrees in planning or a master's degree, typically accredited as an M.Pl. (Master of Planning), MUP (Master of Urban Planning) MCP (Master of City Planning), MSc.Pl. (Master of Science in Planning), M.Pl.(Master of Urban and Regional Planning), MES (Master of Environmental Studies) or simply an MA (Master of Arts). Greece Urban planners in Greece typically graduate from Engineering faculties. Aristotle University of Thessaloniki and University of Thessaly are the two universities that provide undergraduate studies in urban planning in Greece. India Though planning is not a recognized profession under Indian law, the profession began in 1941 with the School of Planning and Architecture as a Department of Architecture of Delhi College of Engineering now the Delhi Technological University. It was later integrated with the School of Town and Country Planning which was established in 1955 by the Government of India to provide facilities for rural, urban and regional planning. On integration, the school was renamed as School of Planning and Architecture in 1959. Today, it is one of the premier schools of pursuing planning studies at bachelor, masters and post doctorate levels. The Institute of Town Planners, India (ITPI), set up on the lines of the Royal Town Planning Institute in London is the body representing planning professionals in India. A small group formed itself into an Indian Board of Town Planners which after three years of continuous work formed the ITPI. The institute, which was established in July 1951, today, has a membership of over 2800, apart from a sizable number of student members, many of whom have qualified Associateship Examination (AITP) conducted by ITPI. As of 2012, the institute has 21 regional chapters across India. School of Planning and Architecture(SPA),Delhi is one of the premier institute in dissemination knowledge of Architecture and Planning in India. It was established in 1941. In 1979, the Government of India, through the then Ministry of Education and Culture, conferred on the School of Planning and Architecture the status of \\"Deemed to be a University\\"(http://spa.ac.in/Home.aspx?ReturnUrl=%2f) School of Planning and Architecture-Bhopal (M.P.)http://www.spabhopal.ac.in/ and School of Planning and Architecture-Vijayawada established in year 2008 by Ministry of Human Resource Development, Government of India. Centre for Environment Planning and Technology (CEPT) University in Ahmedabad and Malaviya National Institute of Technology (NIT) Jaipur, Maulana Azad National Institute of Technology (N.I.T) in Bhopal along with NIT Patna are one of the pioneering Institutes in India where urban planning is taught. Israel The Israel Planners Association was founded in 1965. Urban planning is taught by two institutions. the Technion Faculty of Architecture and Urban Planning in Haifa and the Center for Urban and Regional Studies. The second institution is The Hebrew University of Jerusalem qualifying a Graduate Degree (M.A.) in Geography and Urban and Regional Planning. Mexico Urban planners in Mexico typically graduate from an Architecture background provided by major universities in the country. Most of such degrees can be awarded at Masters' graduate studies, although there are also bachelor's degrees available. New Zealand A planner brings professional expertise and knowledge to the development and implementation of policy in the interests of productive, liveable and sustainable environments. Planners support communities and provide leadership in making informed choices about the consequences of human actions and in bridging the gap between the present and the future. Planners must consider and balance a range of strategic, policy, technical, legal, administrative, community and environmental factors in their contributions to informed decision-making. Planners are employed in diverse public and private roles. They use their knowledge and experience in various institutional and community settings to provide leadership, undertake research, solve problems, evaluate alternatives and outcomes, manage change, and envision, advise on and enact desirable future directions. In applying their expertise, planners must be aware of and responsive to cultural, social, economic, environmental, ethical and political values. In New Zealand, these include the bicultural mandate for planning, including the partnership relationships established by the Treaty of Waitangi/te Tiriti o Waitangi, and New Zealand‚Äôs increasingly multicultural society. A key attribute of a planner is the ability to work across disciplinary and institutional boundaries and to integrate knowledge from a range of disciplines within the distinctive framework of the discipline of planning. A professional planner is someone who has gained a professional qualification through tertiary study, continues to learn post qualification, undertakes continuing professional development, is a member or is working towards becoming a member of the New Zealand Planning Institute (NZPI), contributes to the planning profession, and is committed to upholding the principles and ethical practices of the planning profession. Nigeria In Nigeria, the Nigerian Institute of Town Planners (NITP) and the Town Planners Registration Council (TOPREC) are the leading bodies tasked with the responsibility of improving the training, education and professional practice of planning in Nigeria. To be a town planner in Nigeria, first must complete a degree in Urban and regional planning or a relevant discipline and then complete a final year in the form of a masters in Urban and regional planning which must be accredited by the Town Planners Registration Council (TOPREC ), or a four-year degree encapsulating all aspects. they can then become eligible to be a member of the Nigerian Institute of Town Planners (NITP), but must first complete two years work based training, to be a full member, and subsequently register and sit for the TOPREC professional examination, to become a registered town planner. South Africa The South African Council for Planners (SACPLAN) is the statutory Council of nominated members appointed in terms of the Planning Profession Act, 2002 (Act 36 of 2002) by the Minister of Rural Development and Land Reform (Department of Rural Development and Land Reform) to regulate the Planning Profession(Planning is both the organizational process of creating and maintaining a plan) in terms of the Act. The Planning Profession Principles applies to all registered planners. The SACPLAN through the Act assures quality in the planning profession through the identification of planning profession work that only registered planners can undertake. The functions of the SACPLAN are contained in Section 7 of the Act. The powers and duties of the SACPLAN are contained in Section 8 of the Act. The Act further prescribes a Professional Code of Conduct for registered planners United Kingdom Those wishing to be a town planner, in the United Kingdom, first must complete a degree in a relevant discipline and then complete a final year in the form of a masters in town and country planning which must be accredited by the Royal Town Planning Institute (RTPI), or a four-year degree encapsulating all aspects. They can then become eligible to be a member of the RTPI, but must first complete two years work based training, to be a full, chartered member. Town planners in the UK are responsible for all aspects of the built environment, wherever you are within the UK a town planner will have at sometime planned the built aspects of the environment. Local planning authorities grant planning permission to individuals, private builders and corporations, and employed officers of these authorities (which usually is a specific council for an area) involved in the decision-making process are referred to as planning officers (though those employed with a specialisation may have a different role title, such as conservation officer or landscape officer). United States Planners in the U.S. typically complete an undergraduate or graduate degree from a university offering the program of study. Professional certification is only offered through the American Institute of Certified Planners (AICP), a branch of the American Planning Association. To gain AICP certification, a planner must meet specific educational and experience requirements, as well as pass an exam covering the nature and practice of the discipline. Although AICP certification is not required to be a practicing planner, it does serve as a means in which a planner can verify his or her professional expertise. Palestine Planners in Palestine took responsibility after the Palestinian Authority took governance in the West Bank and Gaza- Palestine. Planners have been trained by a Norwegian consultants As Plan Viak at the very beginning as part of the institutional capacity training project funded by the Norwegian Government. Both Birzeit and Alanjah Universities run bachelor and master degree in planning and planners could specialize in different fields.  Urban planning in media  In the Seinfeld episode \\"The Van Buren Boys\\", George offers a scholarship to an average student who is initially interested in becoming an architect, but later decides they are more interested in urban planning.

Rizzitello's criminal record stretched back to 1947.https://web.archive.org/web/20101031083538/http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2005/Nov-04-Fri-2005/news/4153039.html He was also featured in several biography novels by mobsters-turned-informants Jimmy Fratianno (The Last Mafioso and Vengeance Is Mine), Anthony Fiato (The Animal in Hollywood), and Kenny Gallo (Breakshot). Early life Rizzitello was born in Montreal, Quebec, Canada on March 29, 1927. He later moved to New York City and as an adult became associated with organized crime. He worked for \\"Crazy Joe\\" Gallo in the 1950s who was a member of the Profaci crime family (later named the Colombo crime family). When Gallo attempted to take over the Profaci crime family, Rizzitello was one of his key gunmen. Rizzitello allegedly participated in the murder of mobster John Guariglia and Paul Ricci at the HiFi Lounge in Brooklyn on November 11, 1961, along with future LA mob soldier Tommy Ricciardi. Soon in 1956, Mike Rizzitello moved to California. In California, Rizzitello first became affiliated with the Los Angeles crime family working as a debt collector and extortionist for Salvatore \\"Dago Louie\\" Piscopo along with a friend of his named Louie \\"Lefty\\" Castiglione. He was also mentored by Joseph Sica; an associate of Piscopo. Los Angeles In 1962, Rizzitello was arrested by the LAPD for a string of armed robberies of restaurants and businesses in the Hollywood area, and after conviction he served nine years in prison. In 1970. Rizzitello met inmate William Carroll in prison at Chino prison. The two men became quick friends. In the mid 80's Carroll would become the manager of the Mustang Club, a well known exotic dance club in Santa Ana that Rizzitello received \\"protection\\" money from. Carroll later testified in court the protection amount was $5,000 per week. Allegedly, he became associated with Joe \\"Pegleg\\" Morgan and Rodolfo Cadena, two members of the Mexican Mafia while in prison. During his time in Los Angeles, Rizzitello also became associated with the Los Angeles crime family. He became involved in illegal gambling, loan sharking, mail fraud, insurance fraud, and extortion. After working extensively with the L.A. Mob, On June 6, 1976, Louie Piscopo allegedly sponsored Rizzitello to become a made man. Attending the ceremony were, consigliere Frank Bompensiero, acting boss Aladena \\"Jimmy the Weasel\\" Fratianno and co-acting boss Louis Tom Dragna. Later in 1976, he was arrested and convicted of insurance fraud and was subsequently arrested and acquitted of strong-arming an acquaintance over a gambling debt. In 1977, he was arrested in a mail-billing scheme and convicted. He was sentenced to three years for the two convictions. Rizzitello quickly moved up in the L.A. family and was promoted to caporegime by acting boss Jimmy Fratianno a year later, in 1977. In 1977, Rizzitello was charged with extortion and filing a false insurance claim. Rizzitello pleaded no contest on May 2, 1977 to one count of insurance fraud. A second grand theft charge was dismissed. On May 22, 1977 he was sentenced to serve 2 to 3 years in state prison, but was allowed to remain free after a $20,000 bond was secured. Rizzitello had quickly became well respected, and was a large cash earner for the L.A. family. In 1977, the Chicago Outfit sent Rizzitello to pressure casino owner Moe Dalitz into giving the Outfit $1,000,000. However, the FBI was tipped off by new informant Jimmy Fratianno, and they intervened in the extortion incident. In 1978 mob boss Dominic Brooklier had tried to get Rizzitello to set up the murder of Jimmy Fratianno. Fratianno later turned state's evidence and testified against many of his fellow mobsters. Rizzitello was later put on trial for conspiring with Fratianno to attempt to kill a government witness for Pennsylvania crime boss Russell Bufalino, but was acquitted. In November 1980, Rizzitello was convicted of racketeering and extortion, and sentenced two months later to five years in prison. He was released from prison in 1986, he was put on trial again on charges that he and others tried to defraud a Montana firm in a fraudulent transfer of stock. He was acquitted. In 1987, he was put on trial again; this time charged with trying to market $1 million in stolen bonds. For the third straight time he was acquitted, using attorney Anthony Brooklier, the son of L.A. Mafia boss Dominic Brooklier, as his attorney. Jimmy Fratianno wrote extensively about his working relationship and friendship with Rizzitello in his best selling book about the Los Angeles mob, The Last Mafioso. When Rizzitello was released from prison in early 1986, Peter Milano had become the new boss of the Los Angeles crime family. While Milano and Rizzitello had worked together in the 1970s, they now had a distant relationship. Rizzitello then went to the Gambino crime family in New York City to seek permission to start his own crime family in California, but it never came to be. However, he was able to run an independent crew under Milano's family. Rizzitello worked closely with and mob mentored Anthony Fiato in the 1980s, before Fiato secretly decided to cooperate with the FBI. In 1988, Rizzitello was blacklisted from every casino in Las Vegas due to his involvement in crime and specifically illegal gambling in the city. Conspiracy to commit murder On May 1, 1987, Rizzitello and Joey Grosso attacked William Carroll, the chief financier for the Mustang Club in Santa Ana, over an extorted money dispute. In an empty parking garage in Costa Mesa, Carroll survived three shots to the back of his head, but left him permanently blind. A month later, Rizzitello was returned to federal prison for a parole violation‚Äîassociating with known criminals. In October 1988, Carroll named Rizzitello and Grosso as his attackers. Defended again by attorney Anthony Brooklier, Rizzitello was sentenced on April 20, 1990, to a total of 33 years in prison; 25 years for conspiracy to commit first-degree murder, three years for great bodily injury to Carroll, two years for use of a firearm, and three more because Rizzitello was a convicted felon with a firearm. Terminally ill, Rizzitello died of complications of cancer at the age of 78, on October 26, 2005, in Palm Springs, California. He was still in custody at the time of his death.

He worked as a journalist in S√∏rlandet from 1934, and in Bergens Arbeiderblad from 1939. These newspapers belonged to the Labour Party, and were thus subject to repression during the occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany from 1940 to 1945; Brunvand was imprisoned by the Germans from 1941 to 1945. He was arrested in October 1941, spent time in Ulven concentration camp in November before being sent via Bergen to Hamburg-Fuhlsb√ºttel in December. In August 1943 he was transferred to Rendsburg, later to Dreibergen. During his stay in German prisons he made notes which were later published in newspaper articles, and issued in 1968 as the book Smil og t√•rer i tukthus. The manuscript was written on toilet paper and smuggled out by Hiltgunt Zassenhaus, who buried it and sent it to Brunvand after he had returned to Bergen in 1945.

The temple is famed for the giant Shivalinga, a 28-feet tall Shiva statue assumed to be the largest in the world. Though the Hindu Lord Shiva, who is called the Kal Bhairab is the main attraction, Goddess Kali is also worshipped there. The statue of Kali is situated on the right side of the Kal Bhairab and the statue of the Goddess Parvati is placed on the left. The temple is a major pilgrimage place for Shaivites in Bangladesh. History The temple dates back to the 19th century. It is said that approximately 200 years ago a sculptor named Durgacharan Acharjee saw a dream which motivated and influenced him to make preparations to build the statue from soil. Noor Muhammad, the famous landlord of Sarail donated the land to build this temple. Location Before the Brahmanbaria city was established, Medda was the market located beside the famous Titas river. This market is almost 300 years old. Durgacharan first built this statue by the bank of the river with soil. Regular prayers were held by the local fans until 1971. Damage and restoration During the Bangladesh Liberation War the Pakistani soldiers damaged and looted a lot of Hindu temples in Bangladesh. This temple was one of the damaged temples. The soldiers damaged the parts of this statue using dynamite. Later the statue was made again. It took four years to build this statue again but it reached the height of 24 feet. The current statue is made of stone. Prayers and management Both regular and annual prayers are held. People from different regions come to visit this temple. This place is also referred as one of the tourist attractions of the Brahmanbaria district. There are management committees to look after the temple. The giant statue of the Shiva is mostly locked for maintenance issues. The Government of Bangladesh looks after the charges for maintenance.

Cole won the Grammy Award for Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album for Still Unforgettable at the 51st Grammy Awards. Background Speaking in July 2008 to noted UK soul writer Pete Lewis of the award-winning Blues & Soul, Cole discussed the thinking behind 'Still Unforgettable': \\"While we were still trying to create that same 'Unforgettable'-type mood or environment, this time I wanted to expand. Rather than just doing another Nat 'King' Cole tribute ‚Äì which was not necessary ‚Äì I wanted to go deeper into the American Songbook, by not just getting songs from my father, but also from other singers of his time like Frank Sinatra, Lena Horne, Sammy Davis Jr. and Peggy Lee. You know, there was something about the approach that the writers from that era had to the lyrics and the melodies that was so intentional, so purposeful.

The film stars Katja Riemann, Jasmin Tabatabai, Nicolette Krebitz and Jutta Hoffmann. Both the film and soundtrack album were commercially successful in Germany, but Bandits grossed less than $25,000Bandits-movie.de in the United States. Much of the soundtrack was written and performed by the actresses themselves. The soundtrack reached number one in the German album charts. Plot As part of socio-professional reintegration in a German prison, four women form a band named Bandits. Drummer Emma Moor, a former member of a Jazz group, was abused by the bandleader and shot him. Angelika Angel Kleinschmidt is imprisoned for marriage fraud, she plays the bass. Singer and guitarist Ludmilla Luna Nabiba was arrested for aggravated robbery. Marie Irrgang poisoned her husband, is schizoid and suicidal, she plays the piano. On the way to a performance at a prom the band manages to escape from custody. On their way towards Hamburg they hear one of their own songs on the radio, which they sent to record producer Michael Gold. Due to the media attention the Bandits gained, Gold senses profitable business. The four women trick him into paying them without signing the contract he offers, financially securing their escape. In light of their growing fanbase, the Bandits play a spontaneous concert in a club, however they are interrupted by the police. To evade arrest, they take the American tourist West hostage. The good-looking male causes faction within the group, as he seduces both Angel and Luna. The Bandits leave him behind soon after. With the police led by Kommissar Schwarz still chasing them, they get surrounded on a bridge. Marie dies of a natural death, and the other bandmembers set the car on fire. Luna and Angel jump into the river, while Emma gets arrested. Soon after, she is freed by the other musicians. With the help of a contact Marie had, they concoct a plan play a gig on a cruise liner and thereby leave the country. Prior to their departure the Bandits play a farewell show on a rooftop in the harbor. As the police is informed about this, Kommissar Schwarz and a Sondereinsatzkommando rush to the scene. Constrained by the audience and makeshift barriers, the SEK reaches the rooftop only to see the band stage dive down. While Luna, Angel and Emma run towards the cruise liner, Marie appears to be standing behind the guard rail, wearing a red evening dress. Meanwhile, police snipers get into position. As the Bandits reach the gangway, Kommissar Schwarz addresses them with a bullhorn. Facing the police, they draw their weapons and throw them away. Kommissar Schwarz, however, misinterprets the move and orders the police snipers to shoot. Realizing his mistake, he looks shocked, while shots are heard. The film ends with Marie's hand reaching down to the hands of Luna, Angel and Emma. Reception Rotten Tomatoes reports 88% approval of Bandits among eight critics.

Educated at King Edward's School, Birmingham he left school at 16 and spent several years working for an auctioneer before qualifying as a barrister and being called to the Bar in 1894. Despite his lack of a university degree and the business connections that went with it McCardie built up a successful practice in Birmingham and the Midland and Oxford Circuit through a combination of clear arguments, confident advocacy and intense work; he worked so late in his chambers that they became known as \\"the lighthouse\\". He moved to London to continue work in 1904 and was a popular barrister, on one day handling twenty-one cases in twenty-one different courts. At the peak of his career he was earning ¬£20,000 while still a junior barrister; a large amount for that period. He was appointed as a judge of the High Court King's Bench Division in 1916 at the personal recommendation of the Prime Minister H. H. Asquith despite only being a junior barrister (his application to become a King's Counsel in 1910 had been withdrawn), a rarity as most High Court judges were KCs. He became known for two things; firstly the quality and detail of his written judgments, and secondly his tendency to rebel against the judicial norm and criticise the system, which prevented him from advancing further up the judicial hierarchy. He was popular with the Bar and became a bencher of the Middle Temple in 1916 and a reader in 1927, but received much criticism from the judiciary for his judgements. After several bouts of illness and depression while on circuit he committed suicide on 26 April 1933 in his flat. Numerous theories have been advanced as to the cause of the fatal act, and it may be that it resulted from a combination of several causes. Early life and education McCardie was born on 19 July 1869 in Edgbaston to Joseph McCardie, an Irish merchant and button maker, and his English wife Jane Hunt. His father died when McCardie was eight, and as a result he and his six siblings were raised by their mother alone. He was educated at King Edward's School, Birmingham and was noted as intelligent but lazy. He left the school when he was sixteen to get a job and for several years worked in an auctioneers office before being admitted to the Middle Temple in 1891. He was called to the bar on 18 April 1894 and almost immediately began work at the chambers of James Parfit (known as J.J. Parfit) in Birmingham. Work at the Bar McCardie became well known on the Midlands and Oxford Circuit for his clear arguments and the amount of time he spent working on cases and studying the law as to present the best case for his client; he worked so late that his chamber became known as \\"the lighthouse\\" as there was always a light on in the windows. He was frequently called upon by solicitors to present cases, whether alone or with a KC, and at the height of his career was earning over ¬£20,000. During his time at the bar McCardie represented large organisations such as railway companies and banks, and was a popular barrister. On one occasion he and the QC he was working with, Edward Marshall-Hall, walked out of court in the middle of a case; it was felt that such a popular and effective junior barrister McCardie must have been in the right in doing so . McCardie applied to Robert Reid the Lord Chancellor to become a King's Counsel in 1910, but the delay while Reid considered the application harmed McCardie's business, and he withdrew it. In 1916 on the promotion of Sir Thomas Scrutton to the Court of Appeal he was asked to become a judge in the High Court of Justice King's Bench division, something considered extraordinary as most High Court judges were KCs. High Court As a judge McCardie used common language to make his judgements easier to understand, but at the same time he also made them very long and detailed. He was noted for his tendency to rebel against the opinions held by the rest of the judiciary and much of society as a whole; as early as 1931 he was supportive of the legalisation of abortion, saying that \\"I cannot think it right that a woman should be forced to bear a child against her will\\". He made several judgments in areas that previously had no case law; in Cohen v Sellar [1926] 1 KB 536 he decided that a fianc√©e who breaks off the engagement is not entitled to the return of the ring, and his ruling in Hartley v Hymans [1920] 3 KB 475 was one of the cases used by Lord Denning in his resurrection of promissory estoppel. His decisions and his differing opinions from that of the judiciary as a whole led to criticism from the Lord Chancellor and Lord Chief Justice, as well as several members of the Court of Appeal, particularly Scrutton, whose increasingly bitter attacks suggest that he cherished a personal antipathy, which became so extreme that the two men ended by shouting at each other in open court. While on circuit in 1933 McCardie caught influenza, and the illness and lack of sleep that resulted from it drove him into a deep depression. On 26 April 1933 he shot himself in his flat; the coroner ruled that it was suicide. After his death it came out that he had massive gambling debts, and that he was being blackmailed as a result. It was also suggested that his dabbling in the occult had given him a morbid premonition of death, and that he had come to believe that he was fated to die on a certain day. Several other causes have been suggested, including his quarrel with Scrutton, and it is possible that in his depressed condition a number of factors contributed to the act. In 2003, McCardie was identified in the autobiography \\"Mr Hardie\\" by Henry Archer as his father; the kind but secretive gentleman known to him by his mother as Mr Hardie and who went on holiday with them turned out to be Sir Henry McCardie. Henry Cecil Leon in his memoir Just Within the Law wrote that \\"I have only the happiest memories of appearing before him\\".

History Martoccio, head of the F.A. Martoccio Macaroni Company, acquired a defunct candy factory in 1911 for the sole purpose of replacing one of his own factory's machines that had burned out. Martoccio was talked into buying the entire Pratt and Langhoft Candy plant and found himself in the confectionery business.2 Archived copy He purchased another candy company, the Pendergast Candy Company of Minneapolis, in 1927, changing the name to Hollywood Brands in 1933. The Pendergast Company had discovered the method of making a fluffy nougat for candy bars, which was copied by Frank Mars for his Milky Way bars. Martoccio invented a synthetic coating for his candy bars to keep them from melting in warm temperatures. He used only the very best ingredients‚Äîreal cocoa butter, eggs, etc.-- and was still able to sell his milk chocolate bars for 3 cents compared to the 5 cent Hershey bar (1955). That was not continued after the company was sold in 1967. Hollywood Candy Company moved to Centralia, Illinois, in 1938. During the 1950s, Hollywood Candy Company owned a Crosley Super Sport, which was painted to look like the Zero candy bar wrapper and employed a midget to impersonate a character called Zero and drive around advertising the candy bar. In 1967, the Martoccio family sold Hollywood Brands to Consolidated Foods, later Sara Lee. The Centralia plant was destroyed in a fire in 1980. In 1988 Hollywood Brands was acquired by the Leaf Candy Company, then became part of The Hershey Company in 1996. Products Amongst Hollywood's confectionery products were: *Butter-Nut (1916) with use of the name successfully defended in a court case challenging the name for use in a chocolate bar *Zero (1920) White coating that did not melt in heat.

Football career Southampton McGibbon was born in Netley, Hampshire, the son of Charlie McGibbon (1880‚Äì1954), who was a centre forward for several clubs, including Southampton, in the 1900s. At the time Doug was born, his father had retired and was employed as the Chief Clerk in the Statistical Office at Netley Hospital. Doug McGibbon played his youth football with the Air Service Training at Hamble. During a charity cricket match, he approached the Southampton manager Tom Parker for a trial. Parker gave McGibbon a game with the \\"Saints\\" \\"A\\" team, against Lymington, during which he scored a hat trick. This was sufficient to persuade Southampton to offer him a professional contract, which he signed in December 1938, going on to make his first-team debut in the final match of the 1938‚Äì39 season, replacing Reg Tomlinson in a 2‚Äì0 defeat at Plymouth. McGibbon remained in Southampton at the start of the Second World War, making 16 appearances (scoring 7 goals) in the wartime leagues in 1939‚Äì40 before he moved to Swindon to work as an aircraft mechanic as part of the war effort. While at Swindon, he played for Swindon Railway in 1944 and then for Swindon Town in the 1945‚Äì46 season where he made five appearances, scoring three goals. Swindon Town approached Southampton with a view to signing him on a full-time basis, but the Saints board refused and McGibbon returned to Southampton. During the 1945‚Äì46 season, Southampton played in the League South pending the resumption of League football following the end of the war. During the league season, McGibbon made 30 appearances scoring 27 goals, including six in a 7‚Äì0 victory over Chelsea on 29 December 1945. In this match, McGibbon scored his third goal within five seconds of the kick-off for the second half. McGibbon kicked off to Ted Bates, who passed the ball wide to Bill Stroud, who immediately hit a long ball into the path of McGibbon, who had sprinted upfield. McGibbon hit a firm volley into the back of the net without a Chelsea player having touched the ball. The referee timed the goal at 4.6 seconds from the kick-off ‚Äì this remains the fastest goal ever scored by a Southampton player from a kick-off, although the Dell pitch had been shortened slightly due to bomb damage at the Milton Road end. In total, including FA Cup matches, McGibbon scored 29 goals from 34 appearances in 1945‚Äì46, although his form did tail off towards the end of the season. McGibbon made his home League debut in the opening match of the first season of League football after the war, scoring a hat trick in a 4‚Äì0 victory over Swansea Town. He scored three more goals in the next five games, before an injury forced him to sit out five games, with George Lewis taking over. On McGibbon's return he continued to score regularly until he was dropped, in favour of Lewis, in December before manager Bill Dodgin sold him to Fulham for a fee of ¬£4,250 at the start of January. In his 13 league games for the \\"Saints\\", McGibbon scored nine goals. Fulham McGibbon scored a hat-trick against Plymouth Argyle in his Fulham debut, becoming only the second Fulham player to achieve such a feat. He subsequently found goals harder to come by, scoring a total of 18 in 43 league appearances up to the end of the 1947‚Äì48 season when he was transferred to Bournemouth & Boscombe Athletic in September. Bournemouth At Bournemouth, playing in the Football League Third Division South, McGibbon again found his goal-scoring form and in each of his three seasons at Dean Court was the club's top scorer, with goal tallies of 30, 18 and 17 respectively. Later career In the summer of 1951, McGibbon dropped out of League football, moving to Newport, Monmouthshire to play for Lovells Athletic in the Welsh League. His footballing days came to an abrupt end when he smashed his head following a collision with a cross bar. After a spell in hospital, he returned to Hamble to work as an aircraft engineer and then as a sports officer. He later moved to Isleworth in Middlesex where he was sports secretary for Gillette before finishing his working life with Sperry Flight Systems in Basingstoke. On his retirement, he initially settled in Isleworth before spending the last few years of his life in an Aylesbury care home, where he died in October 2002.

(accessed 17 July 2015) He was elected mayor in 1974, and served until his convictions forced him to resign in 2009. Early life and education Leonis Clos Malburg was born in 1929 to Raymond S. Malburg and Adelina Leonis, Jr. at the French Hospital of Los Angeles, in Chinatown, Los Angeles. Malburg's father was a mortuary director from San Francisco who played a prominent role in forensic examinations in the Los Angeles Coroner's Office. Malburg's grandfather, John B. Leonis (J. B.) was a Basque immigrant who with ranchers Thomas and James Furlong founded Vernon, the first exclusively industrial city in the California, in September 1905. His great uncle was Miguel Leonis, a 19th century Alta California pioneer based at the Leonis Adobe in present day Calabasas, who owned Rancho El Escorpi√≥n and other ranch properties in the western San Fernando Valley and Simi Hills. Malburg received both public and private education. His early school years were spent at Third Street Elementary and John Burrows Junior High, both in Los Angeles. While living at his parents house, he also spent time with his grandfather, J. B. Leonis, who had residences in Hancock Park, Los Angeles, and on a working ranch in the Angeles National Forest. J. B. was one of the founders of the City of Vernon. In its early days, Vernon was noted for its sporting events, including professional boxing and baseball and the 'world's longest bar' at Jack Doyle's Saloon located on land leased from J. B. Leonis. J. B. served for 45 years as a Vernon city councilmember. He was also the founder and president of the First Citizens Bank of Vernon. Malburg's relationship with his grandfather influenced him to pursue a banking career and Vernon city politics. In 1943, Malburg was accepted to and attended the Harvard Military Academy in Los Angeles. He was regarded for his shooting skills and graduated a two-time champion in rifle marksmanship. After returning from his service in the U.S. Air Force, Malburg attended Woodbury University in Los Angeles and majored in Business Administration. He was later on Woodbury's Board of Trustees. He and his wife made a donation for the naming of the Malburg Atrium in the business school building. Career Banking Malburg began his banking career as a messenger for First National Bank of Vernon, which was chartered in 1919. He rose within the bank to oversee loans for construction projects and eventually became the bank's Vice President. In 1956, he became the President of First National Bank. When, through a merger, First National became Citizens National Bank, and Malburg stayed on as Vice President and Chairman of the advisory board. Eventually, Citizens National merged with Crocker National Bank and later with Wells Fargo. Malburg retired from banking to manage his family interests and investments. He was chairman of the Sanitation District of Los Angeles County.,Sanitation District of Los Angeles County a partnership of 24 independent districts, encompassing 78 cities, which serves nearly 5¬Ω million people in Los Angeles County. The Sanitation Districts build and maintain facilities to manage solid, industrial, and water waste in Los Angeles County. Malburg was also chairman of the Barlow Group, which oversees the operations of the Barlow Respiratory Hospital in Los Angeles. He was President and lifelong member of the Societe Francaise De Bienfaisance Mutuelle De Los Angeles. He formerly served as director of the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California (MWD), a consortium of 26 cities and water districts that provide drinking water to six counties in Southern California. Politics Malburg's career in politics began when he accepted an appointment to the Vernon city council following the death of a sitting councilman. After eighteen years on the council, Malburg was elected mayor by the council and served in that capacity until 2009. Under Malburg's leadership, the city had multiplied its surplus while providing businesses within its borders with natural gas service, fiber optic systems, and its own light and power company, with rates up to 40% lower than those outside the city. As mayor, he also oversaw ongoing land development and the city's expanding infrastructure, including a power generation station which bears his name. In 1978, the Mayor and city council made the controversial decision during a labor dispute to dismiss striking firefighters who refused to report for duty or take acting positions on fire calls. It was the opinion of city leaders that the firefighter's illegal actions, which came after their union rescinded its agreement to a solution brokered by a state mediator, left the city with a dangerously thin line of fire defense. Superior Court Judge Harry L. Hupp upheld the city's decision in October, 1978, ruling that the firefighter's strike was indeed illegal. However, after four days of negotiations with the union, the city reinstated the dismissed firefighters. Still, the L.A. County Board of Supervisors, responding to political pressure from labor unions seeking retaliation for the initial firings, cancelled its mutual aid agreement with the City of Vernon (a move that was criticized by the president of the 40-member Independent Cities of Los Angeles County Association). The county district attorney's office also charged Malburg and other administrators with crimes unrelated to the strike. In Malburg's case, the district attorney office accused the mayor of falsely declaring his domicile to be the family residence he built in Vernon, charging that his true domicile was the Los Angeles home he inherited from his grandfather. In 1979, Judge William Keene dismissed the charges when it was revealed that the district attorney's office had withheld evidence from the grand jury which directly contradicted the prosecution's claims. Similar charges were filed again, twenty-seven years later, after the city attempted to suppress a report by a city attorney that the city administrator was stealing from the city. In the course of that investigation the District Attorney's new Public Integrity Division learned that Malburg and his wife and son all claimed to live in apartments within an office building in Vernon. The city's attempt to suppress the report was unsuccessful and the city administrator, Bruce Malkenhorst, Sr., was charged with misappropriating public funds. The mayor and his family were charged with voter fraud. Leonis's son, John Malburg, was sent to prison for child molestation discovered during the same investigation. After being sued by the City of Vernon over nearly $1.5 million in attorney fees, Malburg resigned the office of mayor on July 1, 2009.\\"Embattled Vernon Councilman Resigns\\" In December 2009, Leonis Malburg and his wife were convicted of conspiracy, perjury, and voter fraud. (see editorial, Los Angeles Times, December 9, 2009, \\"Justice Comes to Vernon\\") In January 2010, they were ordered to pay over $600,000 in restitution and fines.

First described to science in 1805, and given its current name in 1889, the species is commonly known as the charcoal loving elf-cup, dwarf acorn cup, stalked bonfire cup, or pixie cup. The small, goblet-shaped fruitbodies of the fungus are reddish-brown with a whitish fringe and measure up to across. They have a short, tapered stalk. Fruitbodies are commonly found on soil where brush has recently been burned, sometimes in great numbers. The fungus is distributed throughout many temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is found in Europe, Turkey, and North America. Although it is primarily a saprotrophic species, feeding on the decomposing organic matter remaining after a fire, it also forms biotrophic associations with the roots of Norway spruce. Taxonomy The fungus was first described scientifically in 1805 by Johannes Baptista von Albertini and Lewis David de Schweinitz as Peziza carbonaria. Mordecai Cubitt Cooke illustrated the fruitbodies, spores, and asci in his 1879 work Mycographia, seu Icones fungorum. Figures of fungi from all parts of the world. In 1889, Pier Andrea Saccardo transferred the fungus to the genus Geopyxis, giving the species its current name. Pustularia carbonaria, published by Heinrich Rehm in 1884, is a synonym of G. carbonaria. Louis-Joseph Gr√©let proposed the variety Geopyxis carbonaria var. sessilis in 1937, referring to forms producing fruitbodies without a stalk, but the taxon is not considered to have independent taxonomic significance. In 1860 Miles Berkeley and Moses Ashley Curtis described the species Peziza lepida from collections made in Japan as part of the North Pacific Exploring and Surveying Expedition (1853‚Äì1856). This taxon was synonymized with G. carbonaria by Mien Rifai in 1968, a taxonomic opinion corroborated by Donald Pfister about a decade later. The specific epithet carbonaria derives from the Latin word for \\"charcoal\\". Common names given to the fungus include \\"charcoal loving elf- cup\\", \\"dwarf acorn cup\\", \\"pixie cup\\", and the British Mycological Society approved \\"stalked bonfire cup\\". Description The fruitbodies (ascocarps) of Geopyxis carbonaris are cup shaped, 1‚Äì2 cm wide, and have fringed whitish margins. The inner spore-bearing surface of the cup, the hymenium, is brick red and smooth, while the exterior surface is a dull yellow, and may be either smooth or have blister-like spots (pustules). The stipe is small (1‚Äì1.5 mm long and 1‚Äì2 mm wide), whitish in color, and expands abruptly into the cup. The brownish flesh of the fungus is thin and brittle. It does not have any distinctive taste, but has an unpleasant smell when crushed in water. The edibility of the fungus is not known, but the fruitbodies are insubstantial and unlikely to be harvested for eating. Microscopic characteristics In mass, the spores are whitish. The spores are elliptical, smooth, hyaline, devoid of oil droplets (eguttulate), and have dimensions of 13‚Äì18 by 7‚Äì9 ¬µm. They are thin walled and germinate and grow rapidly in vitro in the absence of external stimuli. The asci are 190‚Äì225 by 9‚Äì10 ¬µm. The paraphyses are slightly club-shaped, unbranched, and have irregular orange-brown granules, with tips up to 5 ¬µm wide, and are not forked or lobed. The hypothecium, the layer of cells below the hymenium, is made of densely packed, small irregular cells. Similar species Geopyxis vulcanalis (shown above) has yellower coloration than G. carbonaria. The closely related vulcan elf cup (Geopyxis vulcanalis) has a pale orange to yellowish fruitbody that is deeply cup shaped before flattening in maturity, and its crushed flesh often has an odor of sulfur. It may be distinguished microscopically by its paraphyses, which lack the orange-brown granules characteristic of G. carbonaria. It also has larger spores, measuring 14‚Äì22 by 8‚Äì11 ¬µm. Unlike G. carbonaria, it grows on substrates other than burned wood, including mosses, and needle duff. Tarzetta cupularis, which grows habitats similar to G. carbonaria, is distinguished microscopically by its spores that contain two oil droplets. Other genera with similar species with which G. carbonaria may be confused in the field include Aleuria, Caloscypha, Melastiza, and Sowerbyella. Habitat and distribution Geopyxis carbonaria is widespread on burned soil or charcoal in the spring and throughout the growing season. It is one of the most common pioneer species found on burned ground. The charred litter on the forest floor increases the underlying soil pH as well as the availability of minerals. Fruitbodies are produced from 16 to 139 weeks after a forest fire in areas with coniferous trees. Most fruitbodies are produced in the first year after a burn. The fungus prefers fruiting in microhabitats with thin postfire duff near standing burned tree trunks. Geopyxis carbonaria fruitbodies are often found in the same post-fire stands as morels, although the former is usually more abundant. Because the pixie cup fruits earlier than morels, it may serve as an indicator of imminent morel fruiting. Other cup fungi often found fruiting in the same area as G. carbonaria include those from the genera Aleuria, Anthracobia, Peziza, and Tarzetta. The fungus is found in Europe (from where it was originally described), and is widespread throughout North America. The North American distribution extends north to Alaska. In 2010, it was reported for the first time from Turkey. Ecology A solitary G. carbonaria fruitbody growing on burnt woody debris Although primarily a saprotrophic fungus involved in the post-fire breakdown of duff and coniferous roots, Geopyxis carbonaria has been shown to be capable of forming ectomycorrhizae with Norway spruce (Picea abies). It had been demonstrated earlier in laboratory experiments that the fungus has a biotrophic interaction with lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta). The hyphae of G. carbonaria were able to infect the cortex of the tree seedling, but did not penetrate the endodermis. These traits suggest that the fungus is a moderate pathogen, with limited ability to cause reductions in seed germination. Additionally, the fungus produces the enzyme polyphenol oxidase, and can break down the complex organic polymer lignin‚Äîfeatures characteristic of saprotrophic fungi. The formation of a rudimentary Hartig net, a characteristic of mycorrhizal fungi, indicated that G. carbonaria might be capable of forming mutualistic relationships under the right conditions. Vr√•lstad and colleagues suggest that its below-ground association with spruce roots protects it from physical damage in the event of a fire, and the extensive fruitbody production after a fire may reflect \\"a successful fungal escape from a dying host where the fungus no longer can maintain its biotrophic association\\". Large fruitings of the fungus are often associated with damage to the host tree, such as that which occurs with burning. A field study conducted in Norway demonstrated that fruit bodies were more likely to be found in areas that were heavily burned, compared to locations with light to moderate burning where the trees remained viable, or in clearcut areas. Fruiting was much denser in spruce forests‚Äîwith up to 700‚Äì1000 fruitbodies per square meter‚Äîthan in pine forests, where fruitbodies were sporadic. Fruitbodies grew by the millions in the year following the Yellowstone fires of 1988.

It employs various methods of recycling and re- using production waste, basing its production process on the utilization of clean raw materials and, steel making technology that is the lowest producer of emission per ton. * Environment Management Program *: Under an Environment Management Program, the company's most significant environmental contribution is centered on diffusing dust emissions, which to a large degree are the results of technology utilized in the 1970s. The revamping of the dust collection system in the existing facilities is within the scope of these projects. *: As a part of waste management, Qatar Steel continues to study various options to re-using / re-cycling its production waste. Palletizing DR product dust and EF dust, recycling of Refractory bricks and extracting iron from slag are some of the programs under progress. The utilization of used tyres as a carbon source in the steel melting process is an achievement in the right direction. This project may be able to contribute to solving or reducing a major community waste problem. * ISO 14001:2004 *: The company migrates to the new environmental ISO 14001:2004 standard as another move towards these globally accepted environment standards. The alignment of environmental objectives, targets and programs with the corporate HSEHealth, Safety and Environment objective were considered significant achievements during this transition.

Biography Before acquiring a taste in music, Weingarten gained an interest in photography early on; at seven years old, he received his first camera as a Christmas gift. By junior high, Weingarten moved on to shooting Super 8 films. However, in high school, he also aspired to teach himself how to play slide guitar after his first exposure to blues. Weingarten later earned a degree in cinema production which would go hand in hand with the atmospheric music he would later become known for. According to Weingarten, \\"The cinematic tone in my music comes from my visual arts background. I try to paint it all in sound.\\" However, breaking into the film industry proved difficult, and he began writing and recording his own film scores and other music for modern dance companies. But as Weingarten stated in a 2007 interview, \\"I had been my own creative boss for too long, and my attitude got me chased off one too many movie sets.\\" This led him to join the indie label movement.Carl Weingarten The Open Mic Documentary (July 2007).

That same year gave birth to Weingarten's instrumental electronic rock band Delay Tactics. The group, featuring Walter Whitney on synths and guitarists David Udell and Reed Nesbit, took heavy influence from Robert Fripp and served as more of a recording unit than live act.

In the 1990s, Weingarten moved to San Francisco and continued producing his own solo and collaboration albums and toured. He reunited multiple times with Walter Whitney among other musicians in producing a broad catalog of studio recordings. In 1995, several musicians were brought together under the Court Musicians moniker to record an album fusing various cultural styles; two of such tracks featured Weingarten on guitar, and his experience with the project's Indian themes had a profound influence on him musically.Y2K6 Musician Biographies ‚Äì Carl Weingarten Y2KLoopfest (2006).

The bat (also called the , , or ) is a heraldic symbol sometimes used as a charge, but most prominently used as a crest on or around the crown in municipal arms of the former Crown of Aragon‚Äîspecifically in Valencia, Catalonia and the Balearic Islands. Origins The heraldic use of the bat has its origins in the \\"royal dragon\\" crest (') of the coat of arms of the Kings of Aragon. The royal helmet has a ', a traditional Catalonian dragon, emerging from a crown as its crest. Although traditionally the dragon helmet is ascribed to king James I of Aragon (1208 ‚Äì 1276),Diario de Palma - Vicisitudes hist√≥ricas en torno a la cimera de Jaime I reliable documents state that the winged dragon didn't appear over the helmet until Peter IV of Aragon's reign (1319 ‚Äì 1387). This crest was then transformed into a bat by municipalities. There is also a legend of a bat causing King James I of Aragon to win a crucial battle against the Saracens that allowed him to win Valencia for his kingdom. However, original documents state that the animal was a swallow and not a bat.Luis Tramoyeres Blasco, Lo Rat Penat en el escudo de armas de Valencia The bat in official heraldry The coats of arms of certain cities in eastern Spain, like Valencia, Palma, MallorcaAntoni I. Alomar i Canyelles, L'Estendard, la festa nacional m√©s antiga d'Europa (s. XIII-XXI) Palma 1998 and Fraga have the bat over the shield. Some smaller towns, like Catarroja and Novallas, also use this symbol. Formerly the Barcelona city coat of arms had a bat crowning it as well, but the bat was removed at the beginning of the 20th century for unknown reasons. The city of Teruel used to have the bat surmounting the coat of arms' crown. There the bat represents a commemoration of the role of this city in the conquest of Valencia.Old Teruel city coat of arms The bat now rests just below the crown in Teruel's seal. While the use of the bat as a heraldic symbol is prevalent in the territories of the former Crown of Aragon it is rarely used elsewhere. However, it can be found in a few places, including in the coats of arms of the city of Albacete in Spain, the town of Montchauvet, Yvelines in France, Fiefbergen in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany and the former Borough of Brecknock and historic county of Brecknockshire in Wales, UK. Outside of Europe, the coat of arms of Santa Fe de Antioquia, Colombia includes multiple bats; it was granted to the town in 1545 by Charles I of Castile and Aragon and his mother, Joanna of Castile.REUNA - Municipio de Santa F√© de Antioquia Other uses Based on the heraldic symbol of their city, certain Spanish association football club badges, like Albacete Balompi√©, CD Alcoyano, Levante UD and Valencia CF, have a bat on them. The ancient badge of the FC Barcelona, used during the 1899-1910 period, had a small bat crowning it as well. The Burgee of the Royal Valencia Yacht Club (Reial Club N√†utic de Val√®ncia) displays a bat on a golden field in its center. Lo Rat Penat, a political organization based in Valencia in 1878, was named after the heraldic bat. Established by Constant√≠ Llombart, Teodor Llorente and F√®lix Pizcueta, its aim was originally to foster a movement similar to the Catalan Renaixen√ßa in the region of Valencia. The No. 9 Squadron RAF adopted the bat badge in 1917 along with the Latin motto Per Noctem Volamus \\"We fly through the night\\". The badge was approved by King Edward VIII in November 1936.

Sun-n-Fun 2003, Lakeland, Florida EDO Aircraft Corporation was an American aircraft manufacturing company known primarily for manufacturing pontoons for floatplanes. History The EDO Aircraft Corporation began operations on October 16, 1925 in College Point, New York. Although its founder, Earl Dodge Osborne, had dreamed of building airplanes, his first successful product line was EDO floats. Because of a new innovative design, the use of aluminum rather than wood, and the scarcity of hard-surfaced runways in the 1920s, demand built quickly for the floats. With the outbreak of World War II, the company's focus shifted, and EDO began to provide subassemblies for military aircraft of the U.S. Naval Air Corps, U.S. Army Air Forces, and foreign air forces.EDO Float Gear. // Flying, July, 1942, v. 31, no. 1, p. 74. This shift in emphasis led to the company's being renamed the EDO Corporation in November 1947. EDO built a factory in 1940 on Long Island, designed by the NYC firm of Mamfeldt, Adams & Prentice.

On 1 March 1952 its operations were reorganized as Garwin Inc., whose business was rebuilding aircraft instruments and accessories. By late 1952 it was also manufacturing its own instruments. In 1963 it became Garwin-Carruth Inc. In 1966 it was sold to Weston Instruments. By 1966 it was marketing throughout South America and Europe as well as the United States. In 1969, EDO Corporation purchased the Wichita Division of the Weston Instrument Company. In 1969 EDO also purchased control of Electronic Equipment Engineering, Inc. of Dallas, Texas. EEE designed and produced radio/audio control equipment for long-range aircraft. EEE was moved to Wichita in 1970. The consolidated company was named EDO-Aire. By the 1980s, the light aircraft industry was in a prolonged deep slump. Annual production had shrunk from over 12,000 units to around 1,600. In 1982, EDO Aircraft Corporation made a business decision to divest itself of the EDO-Aire Group, ending a 60‚Äìyear presence in the aviation industry. In April 1983, four former directors of EDO-Aire Wichita formed Sigma Tek, Inc. and purchased the assets of EDO-Aire Wichita from EDO Corporation (the deal was finalized on 25 May 1983).Sigma Tek Company Background, accessed 28 September 2016 A Wichita Kansas aviation services company, Sigma Tek, was founded in 1983 after its principals had been employed by EDO Corporation. EDO Floats EDO earned its original fame as the world's principal producer of pontoon floats for aircraft, starting before World War II. Edo floats were developed for the most popular aircraft, ranging from Piper Cubs to the Douglas C-47. EDO's leadership in this field continued well into the 1970s, when it began to get significant competition from Wipaire and their Wipline floats. The Kenmore Air Company, a small transportation company founded in the Seattle Washington area after World War II, soon augmented its charter operations with maintenance, sales and restoration work. It acquired the sales rights for EDO floats in the northwestern USA.

He belonged to the Norwegian Labour Party from the start, being party secretary as well as editor of the party organs Social-Demokraten and Ny Tid, but politically he was described as a \\"reformist pragmatic\\", and was thus a member of the breakaway Social Democratic Labour Party of Norway from 1921 to 1927. Early life and education Buen was born in Gransherad as the son of farmer Jon Olsen Buen (1823‚Äì1906) and his wife Aslaug Olsdatter (1826‚Äì1906). He finished primary school, and attended a secondary school in Vang, Hedmark for two years, before entering apprenticeship as a book printer at W.C. Fabritius in Kristiania in 1879. He then educated himself, and worked, as a typographer. Labour movement In 1885 Buen was among the founders of the association Socialdemokratisk Forening. The association took control over the newspaper Vort Arbeide ('Our Work'), founded in 1884 by Christian Holtermann Knudsen, and Buen was hired there as a journalist. The name was changed from Vort Arbeide to Social-Demokraten ('The Social Democrat') in 1886. Buen was appointed editor-in-chief of Social-Demokraten in 1900, and as this was the main organ for the Labour Party, Buen became party secretary as well. He also chaired his local trade union from 1897 to 1898, and served one term in Kristiania city council from 1901 to 1903. In 1903 a conflict in the party forced the retreat of Buen as editor-in-chief. He was also replaced as party secretary. Instead, he was sent to Trondhjem to edit the party organ in that city, Ny Tid. He served as a member of Trondhjem city council from 1907 to 1910 and from 1913 to his death. He was also elected to the first session of the Norwegian Parliament in 1906, 1909, 1912, 1915 and 1918, representing the single-member constituency of Lademoen. He led the Labour Party parliamentary group from 1913 to 1921, and from 1919 to 1921 he served as President of the Storting. Labour parliamentary group 1906; Buen second from the right in the lower row. In the meantime Buen had been succeeded as editor of Ny Tid by Martin Tranm√¶l. Tranm√¶l belonged to the radical wing of the Labour Party, and in 1921 the moderate wing broke out to form the Social Democratic Labour Party of Norway, due to disagreements over the Labour Party's membership in the Comintern and adaption of the Twenty-one Conditions. Buen, described as a \\"reformist pragmatic\\", joined the Social Democratic Labour Party. From 1922 to 1927 he edited the newspaper Tr√∏ndelag Social-Demokrat, which can be considered an offshoot of Ny Tid. Labour Party had officially scrapped the Twenty-one Conditions in 1923, and in 1927 the Labour Party and the Social Democratic Labour Party reconciled, and reunited. Tr√∏ndelag Social-Demokrat was disestablished, but since Ny Tid had been usurped when the Communist Party of Norway broke away from the Labour Party in 1923, the Labour Party organ in Trondhjem was now Arbeider-Avisen. Buen worked as a journalist here for a few years. He also managed the local branch of Norges Bank from 1916 to his death in 1933, and had been a member of the board of the Norwegian Water Resources and Energy Directorate from 1921 to 1923.

It was later adapted into anime series, produced by TV Tokyo and Sunrise. This show was broadcast from October 8, 1987 to September 28, 1989 with a total of 99 episodes and one TV Special. The series was unsuccessfully pitched for broadcast on the Food Network in the United States. Plot Ajiyoshi Youichi is a culinary prodigy who manages a restaurant with his mother. One day, Murata Genjirou appears in the restaurant and is surprised at the delicious taste and delicate culinary skills of the katsu-don prepared by Youichi. Subsequently, Youichi is invited to the Ajiou (literally meaning taste emperor) Building in which he is involved in a spaghetti match with the in-house Italian chef, Marui. Youichi's novel culinary ideas, coupled with his enthusiasm of serving the best for his guests, allow him to defeat Marui in the match. From then on, Youichi begins to compete with other rivals in the race for the best tastes and dishes. Characters Hinode Eatery Meaning \\"sunrise\\" the is a local restaurant in an unnamed part of Tokyo where Ajiou Company is also based. It serves cheap, simple Japanese fare and is largely patronized by working-class people, but as Youichi defeats more and more opponents, the winning dishes are added to the menu periodically. ; : :Youichi is the young head chef of his family's restaurant, he is passionately devoted to cooking and coming up with new and interesting culinary creations. His age was 14 when he first started (revealed when he entered the Tough Steak competition for a year's supply of Sirloin beef.) Showing a great level of cooking skill at a young age, Youichi's mother lets him take over cooking at the restaurant as she admits he's better than she is at it. He first encounters Murata Genjirou (usually referred to as Ajiou-sama) in the first volume/episode of the series when the surly company head stops in on a whim. After impressing him with a super-thick katsudon (pork cutlet), Ajiou invites Youichi to the Ajiou Building where through a series of comical events he runs afoul of the head of Ajiou's Italian cooking department, Chef Marui. After winning a spaghetti battle against the chef, Youichi's reputation as a \\"genius boy cook\\" becomes more widespread. He spends the rest of the series in a succession of cooking battles brought about by circumstance, direct challenges, or tournaments. He is strongly dedicated to Hinode, as well as his friends at school. However, this dedication and pride is also his main fault. He cannot take having Hinode or his skill as a cook insulted; and finds it impossible to back down from direct challenges. Youichi's mother calls this tendency his \\"sickness\\" and it gets him into trouble several times, all of which have to be resolved through cooking competitions. In the series, he only lost twice, once in an unofficial match, the other as to recreate his late father's signature dish. ; : :Youichi's mother and the current owner of the Hinode Eatery after her husband died. Noriko runs everything about the restaurant except for the cooking which she leaves to her son, unless he has left on some cooking related trip. As she is a good cook herself, he often has her taste his dishes beforehand to get her opinion on what he has done. She remarks that Youichi is very much like her late husband in personality, as well has his passion for cooking and supports him whenever he has to go and compete. ; : :Youichi's deceased father. It is never revealed exactly what he died of, but that it was about five years before the story starts. Takao was apparently known for being both an excellent chef and passionate about cooking. He left behind a book of recipes and cooking techniques that Youichi refers to in times of need, but it left out a page about a rare soup. ; : :An anime original character. Youichi's classmate. Mitsuko works part-time at Hinode as a waitress in part as a favor to Youichi's mother and in part because she wants to be close to Youichi (who is largely unaware and uninterested in romance). She gets jealous if other girls take his attention. She is not a terribly good cook, but does her best to support Youichi and is often part of the group who taste tests his dishes. She only appears in the anime and is also there to help advance the explanation of whatever unusual cooking techniques are being used in the battle. ; : :An anime original character. Shigeru is Mitsuko's little brother. He is 7 years old when he first appeared. He hangs out at the Hinode Eatery because he gets free food and he likes Youichi's cooking better than Mitsuko's. He also does a lot of taste testing and only appears in the anime. He is also an avid baseball fan. Ajiou Company The is the largest conglomerate of chefs and cooks in the country. While it is never directly stated what the Ajiou Group does, it can be assumed they have restaurant chains, training schools, and other products related to cooking. ; - : :Head of the Ajiou group, it's stated that Ajiou- sama has been the head of the cooking world in Japan for the last thirty years. An accomplished chef with a discerning tongue, he oversees his empire directly and awards talent when he finds it. He is recognizable by his grey hair, beard, and mustache; and his Japanese style clothing. After he encounters Youichi, he becomes very interested in him, possibly as additional talent or a successor. He often shows up wherever Youichi is doing battle, sometimes going so far as to provide the facilities. He also decides to start holding the \\"Ajiou Company Grand Prix Contest\\", a cooking competition for young and upcoming chefs to quash any rumours of him retiring. Of the two times it is held in the manga, Youichi ties for the title in the first one and wins out right the second time. ; : :Ajiou's personal secretary, he isn't seen much in the series. He wears a suit and carries a brief case. He is responsible for accompanying Ajiou-sama wherever he goes, and presumably takes care of things like bills at restaurants and arranging transportation and such. His name means droopy eyes. ; : :Head of the Italian cooking department at the Ajiou Company. He is a short, rotund man with a thick black mustache (the name Marui may be a nod to Mario, from the Super Mario Bros. game series). Marui meets Youichi when the boy is mistakenly put in his Italian cooking class where he upstages the famous chef over the best way to cook al dente pasta. In response, Marui demands a spaghetti battle between him and Youichi from Ajiou-sama. After he's beaten, Marui accepts defeat gracefully and becomes one of Youichi's strongest supporters, next to Ajiou-sama. He tends to check in and advise Youichi during the preparation before battles and has also helped out at Hinode while Youichi has been absent due to training or competitions. There are some small indications that he may be attracted to Noriko, but it is never explored in the manga. He returned to Italy after his 41st birthday, in a friendly battle against Youichi, but both defeated a robot. He is also the second person after Ajiou-sama to get the Golden Plate, 10 years before Youichi eventually got his. ; : :Head of the French cooking department at the Ajiou Company. Shimonaka is much younger than the other department heads. He has blond hair that flips up at the bottom. He was formally trained in France and is the only member of the Ajiou Company department heads who competes in the GP Contest as a representative. He conceded defeat in the second round after his dish had too much leftover bones of a fish, and returns to France to train. Upon his return he is dead set on defeating Youichi, but ultimately while he comes to respect and consider Youichi a friend, he is never successful. ; : :Head of the Japanese cooking department at the Ajiou Company. Shiba is an older gentleman with light hair that he wears brushed back. He also wears Japanese style clothing. Shiba is usually a judge during any of the battles involving the Ajiou Company and helps judge the very last battle which is between Youichi and Ajiou-sama himself. His father is a squid shop vendor. ; : :Head of the German cooking department at the Ajiou Company. Sekiba has short, dark, curly hair that is receding. He wears a cravat under a collared coat. Sekiba is another judge during any of the battles involving the Ajiou Company. Youichi helps him defend the Ajiou Company's reputation in a bratwurst battle. ; : :Head of the Chinese cooking department at the Ajiou Company. Yonemoto has black hair and eyes that always look like they're closed. He tends to wear suits. He is the last of the judges during any of the battles involving the Ajiou Company. Aji Shougun Group The is a less reputable company similar to Ajiou; bent on driving many of the local restaurants (including Hinode) in Youichi's neighborhood out of business, having already forced Youichi's father to close of his former business - a traditional Japanese floating teahouse. Though they make good food, they also try to use flashy decorations or gimmicks like trailer trucks to attract more customers. Whenever one of members of this group shows up, the restaurant shop owner in danger usually comes to Youichi for help. Other Rivals Youichi has many one off battles over the course of the series, however; there are several chefs whom he faces multiple times and considers to be personal rivals. ; : :Sakai is also considered to be a \\"genius boy chef\\" and his biggest peer rival. Like Youichi, he is short with dark hair, but is mainly recognizable by his one fang when he smiles or opens his mouth. Youichi first encounters him for the first time in defense of Hinode. Sakai is working for someone who wants to buy the building and put up a high rise food complex (who is also his legal guardian because he is also 14). The two compete in a curry battle, which Youichi wins by a clever use of pineapple and instant coffee. They face off several more times, including during both GP Contests. Youichi wins most of these matches, although they did tie for first in the first GP Contest. He ended up being inspired enough to open a curry shop next to Hinode. He was formerly a Yellow Plate holder for the best Custodian Chefs in Japan. ; : :Konishi is an adult who has a specialty in cooking meat. He has shaggy dark hair and a large chin with a pronounced cleft in it. Youichi first runs into him during a steak contest (the winner would get a year's worth of steak for their restaurant). Konishi lost thanks to Youichi's clever use of a specially made heated steak plate. Angry and embarrassed, he vows to face Youichi again. They meet again at the GP Contest, where Konishi is the first to be eliminated. He takes this loss with a little more dignity and becomes one of the cast members who regularly appears to watch Youichi compete and occasionally help out at Hinode. He did become a member of Aji Shogun Group until he escaped and became a sushi chef apprentice. ; : :Nakae is a man in his early twenties. Based in Kyuushu, he his very passionate and devoted to growing his own ingredients and making good food. Nakae is quite tall and bulky, with long dark hair and usually has a band aid over the bridge of his nose. Nakae differs from many of Youichi's other rivals in that he is very good natured and pleasant. In their first encounter, Nakae actually beats Youichi, but there is no ill will and they meet again in the second GP Contest, where he loses in the last round over a steak battle. Nakae also has a couple of friends who challenge Youichi, but both lose. He lost the battle to win the Red Plate (Best International Chef), Blue Plate (Best Sea-based Chef), Green (Best Herbal and Medical Chef), for the right to compete against Kazuma. ; : :Ryuu is a 19 (holds a motorbike license, in which the minimum legal age is 18) and cooking prodigy from Hong Kong. Ryuu has spiky hair that is dark at the top and light at the bottom. He wears a white Chinese style coat. He and Youichi meet during a trip the latter takes to Hong Kong with a family friend. Ryuu and Youichi have one match up in Hong Kong which go either way, but he is eliminated in the second round of the second GP contest. He appears a couple times more, and once or twice actually assists Youichi in defeating Ryu's former master, who betrayed him.

It is one of the grandest examples of Tai Ahom architecture. The Talatal Ghar is also the largest of all Tai Ahom monuments. Visitors nowadays are only allowed to scout through the ground floor, the first floor, and what remains of the 2nd and 3rd floors of the Talatal Ghar. The floors of the Talatal Ghar below the ground have been sealed off, as visitors tended to get lost within its mazy structure and were never heard of thereafter. History Swargadeo Rudra Singha shifted the capital of the Ahom Kingdom from talatal Garhgaon to Rangpur in AD 1702-03. For about a century thereafter, Rangpur remained the capital. It is located in the western part of Sivasagar. The earliest constructions were commissioned by Swargadeo Rudra Singha in AD 1698. Rangpur was the capital of the Ahom Kingdom and served as its military- station. Architecture ;Talatal Ghar(‡¶§‡¶≤‡¶æ‡¶§‡¶≤ ‡¶ò‡ß∞) The Talatal Ghar is a place which was initially built as an army base. It houses two secret tunnels, and three floors below ground level which were used as exit routes during the Ahom wars (and which give the structure its name). The Rangpur Palace is a seven- storied structure (1751-1769 CE). * ‡¶∏‡ßç‡¶¨‡ß∞‡ßç‡¶ó‡¶¶‡ßá‡¶â ‡ß∞‡¶æ‡¶ú‡ßá‡¶∂‡ßç‡¶¨‡ß∞ ‡¶∏‡¶ø‡¶Ç‡¶π(Swargadeo Rajeswar Singha) added the three floors below ground, which make up the Talatal Ghar. This is made of brick and an indigenous type of cement (a mixture of Bora Chaul - a sticky variety of rice grain - eggs of swan, etc.). The Talatal Ghar had two secret tunnels. One, about 3 kilometres in length, connected the Talatal Ghar to the Dikhow River, while the other, 16 kilometres long, led to the Garhgaon Palace, and was used as an escape route in case of an enemy attack. * From east to west, several rooms run along a long corridor; and from north to south are numerous smaller wings. The ground floor served as stables, store rooms, and servants' quarters. The Kareng Ghar was built mainly of wood, which was largely destroyed over time. The Royal apartments were on the upper storey, of which only a few rooms now remain, close to an octagonal room on the northern wing which once served as the Puja Ghar (prayer house). There are stairs leading up to the terrace. An isolated room stands on the south which is believed to have been used by the queen during her confinement. However the first Ground Penetrating Survey (GPR) in the northeast, undertaken at two Ahom monuments in Sivasagar district in early Apr 2015, has not revealed the existence of any secret tunnel. The survey was carried out by IIT-Kanpur, in collaboration with the Guwahati circle of the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), over a period of five days at Talatal Ghar and Ahom Royal Palace (Kareng Ghar), both in Sivasagar district.http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/guwahati/Ahom-monuments-have- no-hidden-tunnels-Survey/articleshow/46995148.cms Visitors nowadays can only view the ground floor, the first floor, and what remains of the 2nd and 3rd floors .The floors of the Talatal Ghar below ground have been sealed off, and most of the wooden parts of the palace have disappeared over time.

An actor is a person who portrays a character in a performance (also actress; see below).\\"The dramatic world can be extended to include the 'author', the 'audience' and even the 'theatre'; but these remain 'possible' surrogates, not the 'actual' referents as such\\" (Elam 1980, 110). The actor performs \\"in the flesh\\" in the traditional medium of the theatre or in modern media such as film, radio, and television. The analogous Greek term is (), literally \\"one who answers\\".Hypokrites (related to our word for hypocrite) also means, less often, \\"to answer\\" the tragic chorus. See Weimann (1978, 2); see also Csapo and Slater, who offer translations of classical source material using the term hypocrisis (acting) (1994, 257, 265‚Äì267). The actor's interpretation of their role‚Äîthe art of acting‚Äîpertains to the role played, whether based on a real person or fictional character. This can also be considered an \\"actor's role,\\" which was called this due to scrolls being used in the theaters. Interpretation occurs even when the actor is \\"playing themselves\\", as in some forms of experimental performance art. Formerly, in ancient Greece and Rome, the medieval world, and the time of William Shakespeare, only men could become actors, and women's roles were generally played by men or boys. While Ancient Rome did allow female stage performers, only a small minority of them were given speaking parts. The commedia dell‚Äôarte of Italy, however, allowed professional women to perform early on: Lucrezia Di Siena, whose name is on a contract of actors from 10 October 1564, has been referred to as the first Italian actress known by name, with Vincenza Armani and Barbara Flaminia as the first primadonna's and the first well documented actresses in Italy (and Europe). Giacomo Oreglia (2002). Commedia dell'arte. Ordfront. After the English Restoration of 1660, women began to appear on stage in England. In modern times, particularly in pantomime and some operas, women occasionally play the roles of boys or young men. History The first recorded case of a performing actor occurred in 534 BC (though the changes in calendar over the years make it hard to determine exactly) when the Greek performer Thespis stepped onto the stage at the Theatre Dionysus to become the first known person to speak words as a character in a play or story. Before Thespis' act, Grecian stories were only expressed in song, dance, and in third person narrative. In honor of Thespis, actors are commonly called Thespians. The exclusively male actors in the theatre of ancient Greece performed in three types of drama: tragedy, comedy, and the satyr play.Brockett and Hildy (2003, 15‚Äì19). Western theatre developed and expanded considerably under the Romans. The theatre of ancient Rome was a thriving and diverse art form, ranging from festival performances of street theatre, nude dancing, and acrobatics, to the staging of situation comedies, to high-style, verbally elaborate tragedies. As the Western Roman Empire fell into decay through the 4th and 5th centuries, the seat of Roman power shifted to Constantinople and the Byzantine Empire. Records show that mime, pantomime, scenes or recitations from tragedies and comedies, dances, and other entertainments were very popular. From the 5th century, Western Europe was plunged into a period of general disorder. Small nomadic bands of actors traveled around Europe throughout the period, performing wherever they could find an audience; there is no evidence that they produced anything but crude scenes.Brockett and Hildy (2003, 75) Traditionally, actors were not of high status; therefore, in the Early Middle Ages, traveling acting troupes were often viewed with distrust. Early Middle Ages actors were denounced by the Church during the Dark Ages, as they were viewed as dangerous, immoral, and pagan. In many parts of Europe, traditional beliefs of the region and time meant actors could not receive a Christian burial. In the Early Middle Ages, churches in Europe began staging dramatized versions of biblical events. By the middle of the 11th century, liturgical drama had spread from Russia to Scandinavia to Italy. The Feast of Fools encouraged the development of comedy. In the Late Middle Ages, plays were produced in 127 towns. These vernacular Mystery plays often contained comedy, with actors playing devils, villains, and clowns.Brockett and Hildy (2003, 86) The majority of actors in these plays were drawn from the local population. Amateur performers in England were exclusively male, but other countries had female performers. There were several secular plays staged in the Middle Ages, the earliest of which is The Play of the Greenwood by Adam de la Halle in 1276. It contains satirical scenes and folk material such as faeries and other supernatural occurrences. Farces also rose dramatically in popularity after the 13th century. At the end of the Late Middle Ages, professional actors began to appear in England and Europe. Richard III and Henry VII both maintained small companies of professional actors. Beginning in the mid-16th century, Commedia dell'arte troupes performed lively improvisational playlets across Europe for centuries. Commedia dell'arte was an actor-centred theatre, requiring little scenery and very few props. Plays were loose frameworks that provided situations, complications, and outcome of the action, around which the actors improvised. The plays used stock characters. A troupe typically consisted of 13 to 14 members. Most actors were paid a share of the play's profits roughly equivalent to the sizes of their roles. A 1596 sketch of a performance in progress on the thrust stage of The Swan, a typical Elizabethan open-roof playhouse. Renaissance theatre derived from several medieval theatre traditions, such as the mystery plays, \\"morality plays\\", and the \\"university drama\\" that attempted to recreate Athenian tragedy. The Italian tradition of Commedia dell'arte, as well as the elaborate masques frequently presented at court, also contributed to the shaping of public theatre. Since before the reign of Elizabeth I, companies of players were attached to households of leading aristocrats and performed seasonally in various locations. These became the foundation for the professional players that performed on the Elizabethan stage. The development of the theatre and opportunities for acting ceased when Puritan opposition to the stage banned the performance of all plays within London. Puritans viewed the theatre as immoral. The re-opening of the theatres in 1660 signaled a renaissance of English drama. English comedies written and performed in the Restoration period from 1660 to 1710 are collectively called \\"Restoration comedy\\". Restoration comedy is notorious for its sexual explicitness. At this point, women were allowed for the first time to appear on the English stage, exclusively in female roles. This period saw the introduction of the first professional actresses and the rise of the first celebrity actors. 19th century The Bells, 1874. In the 19th century, the negative reputation of actors was largely reversed, and acting became an honored, popular profession and art. The rise of the actor as celebrity provided the transition, as audiences flocked to their favorite \\"stars\\". A new role emerged for the actor-managers, who formed their own companies and controlled the actors, the productions, and the financing.James Eli Adams, ed., Encyclopedia of the Victorian era (2004) 1:2-3. When successful, they built up a permanent clientele that flocked to their productions. They could enlarge their audience by going on tour across the country, performing a repertoire of well-known plays, such as those by Shakespeare. The newspapers, private clubs, pubs, and coffee shops rang with lively debates evaluating the relative merits of the stars and the productions. Henry Irving (1838-1905) was the most successful of the British actor-managers.George Rowell, Theatre in the Age of Irving (Rowman & Littlefield, 1981). Irving was renowned for his Shakespearean roles, and for such innovations as turning out the house lights so that attention could focus more on the stage and less on the audience. His company toured across Britain, as well as Europe and the United States, demonstrating the power of star actors and celebrated roles to attract enthusiastic audiences. His knighthood in 1895 indicated full acceptance into the higher circles of British society. 20th century Shubert Theatre presentation of John Hudson's Wife By the early 20th century, the economics of large-scale productions displaced the actor-manager model. It was too hard to find people who combined a genius at acting as well as management, so specialization divided the roles as stage managers and later theatre directors emerged. Financially, much larger capital was required to operate out of a major city. The solution was corporate ownership of chains of theatres, such as by the Theatrical Syndicate, Edward Laurillard, and especially The Shubert Organization. By catering to tourists, theaters in large cities increasingly favored long runs of highly popular plays, especially musicals. Big name stars became even more essential.Foster Hirsch, The Boys from Syracuse: The Shuberts' Theatrical Empire (Cooper Square Press, 2000). Techniques * Classical acting is a philosophy of acting that integrates the expression of the body, voice, imagination, personalizing, improvisation, external stimuli, and script analysis. It is based on the theories and systems of select classical actors and directors including Konstantin Stanislavski and Michel Saint-Denis. * In Stanislavski's system, also known as Stanislavski's method, actors draw upon their own feelings and experiences to convey the \\"truth\\" of the character they portray. Actors puts themselves in the mindset of the character, finding things in common to give a more genuine portrayal of the character. * Method acting is a range of techniques based on for training actors to achieve better characterizations of the characters they play, as formulated by Lee Strasberg. Strasberg's method is based upon the idea that to develop an emotional and cognitive understanding of their roles, actors should use their own experiences to identify personally with their characters. It is based on aspects of Stanislavski's system. Other acting techniques are also based on Stanislavski's ideas, such as those of Stella Adler and Sanford Meisner, but these are not considered \\"method acting\\".Guerrasio, Jason. (2014-12-19) What It Means To Be ‚ÄòMethod‚Äô. Tribecafilminstitute.org. Retrieved on 2016-02-10. * Meisner technique requires the actor to focus totally on the other actor as though he or she is real and they only exist in that moment. This is a method that makes the actors in the scene seem more authentic to the audience. It is based on the principle that acting finds its expression in people's response to other people and circumstances. Is it based on Stanislavski's system. As opposite sex Formerly, in some societies, only men could become actors. In ancient Greece and ancient Rome and the medieval world, it was considered disgraceful for a woman to go on stage; nevertheless, women did perform in Ancient Rome, and again entered the stage in the Commedia dell'arte in Italy in the 16th-century, were Lucrezia Di Siena became the perhaps first professional actress since Ancient Rome. France and Spain, too, also had female actors in the 16th-century. In William Shakespeare's England, however, women's roles were generally played by men or boys. When an eighteen- year Puritan prohibition of drama was lifted after the English Restoration of 1660, women began to appear on stage in England. Margaret Hughes is oft credited as the first professional actress on the English stage. Previously, Angelica Martinelli, a member of a visiting Italian Commedia dell' arte company, did perform in England as early as 1578, M.A. Katritzky: Women, Medicine and Theatre 1500‚Äì1750: Literary Mountebanks and Performing but such foreign guest appearances had been rare exceptions and there had been no professional English actresses in England. This prohibition ended during the reign of Charles II in part because he enjoyed watching actresses on stage. Specifically, Charles II issued letters patent to Thomas Killigrew and William Davenant, granting them the monopoly right to form two London theatre companies to perform \\"serious\\" drama, and the letters patent were reissued in 1662 with revisions allowing actresses to perform for the first time.Fisk, Deborah Payne (2001). \\"The Restoration Actress\\". In Owen, Susan J. A companion to restoration drama, pg. 73, (1. publ. ed.). Oxford [u.a.]: Blackwell. . The first occurrence of the term actress was in 1608 according to the OED and is ascribed to Middleton. In the 19th century, many viewed women in acting negatively, as actresses were often courtesans and associated with promiscuity. Despite these prejudices, the 19th century also saw the first female acting \\"stars\\", most notably Sarah Bernhardt.'Studies in hysteria': actress and courtesan, Sarah Bernhardt and Mrs Patrick Campbell In Japan, onnagata, or men taking on female roles, were used in kabuki theatre when women were banned from performing on stage during the Edo period; this convention continues. In some forms of Chinese drama such as Beijing opera, men traditionally performed all the roles, including female roles, while in Shaoxing opera women often play all roles, including male ones.Richard Gunde, Culture and Customs of China (2002), page 63. In modern times, women occasionally played the roles of boys or young men. For example, the stage role of Peter Pan is traditionally played by a woman, as are most principal boys in British pantomime. Opera has several \\"breeches roles\\" traditionally sung by women, usually mezzo-sopranos. Examples are Hansel in H√§nsel und Gretel, Cherubino in The Marriage of Figaro and Octavian in Der Rosenkavalier. Women playing male roles are uncommon in film, with notable exceptions. In 1982, Stina Ekblad played the mysterious Ismael Retzinsky in Fanny and Alexander, and Linda Hunt received the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for playing Billy Kwan in The Year of Living Dangerously. In 2007, Cate Blanchett was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for playing Jude Quinn, a fictionalized representation of Bob Dylan in the 1960s, in I'm Not There. In the 2000s, women playing men in live theatre is particularly common in presentations of older plays, such as Shakespearean works with large numbers of male characters in roles where gender is inconsequential. Having an actor dress as the opposite sex for comic effect is also a long-standing tradition in comic theatre and film. Most of Shakespeare's comedies include instances of overt cross-dressing, such as Francis Flute in A Midsummer Night's Dream. The movie A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum stars Jack Gilford dressing as a young bride. Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon famously posed as women to escape gangsters in the Billy Wilder film Some Like It Hot. Cross-dressing for comic effect was a frequently used device in most of the Carry On films. Dustin Hoffman and Robin Williams have each appeared in a hit comedy film (Tootsie and Mrs. Doubtfire, respectively) in which they played most scenes dressed as a woman. Occasionally, the issue is further complicated, for example, by a woman playing a woman acting as a man‚Äîwho then pretends to be a woman, such as Julie Andrews in Victor/Victoria, or Gwyneth Paltrow in Shakespeare in Love. In It's Pat: The Movie, film-watchers never learn the gender of the androgynous main characters Pat and Chris (played by Julia Sweeney and Dave Foley). Similarly, in the aforementioned example of The Marriage of Figaro, there is a scene in which Cherubino (a male character portrayed by a woman) dresses up and acts like woman; the other characters in the scene are aware of a single level of gender role obfuscation, while the audience is aware of two levels. A few modern roles are played by a member of the opposite sex to emphasize the gender fluidity of the role. Edna Turnblad in Hairspray was played by Divine in the 1988 original film, Harvey Fierstein in the Broadway musical, and John Travolta in the 2007 movie musical. Eddie Redmayne was nominated for an Academy Award for playing Lili Elbe (a trans woman) in 2015's The Danish Girl.Andrea Mandell, Can Eddie Redmayne nab Oscar No. 2?, December 20, 2015, USA Today The term actress In contrast to Ancient Greek theatre, Ancient Roman theatre did allow female performers. While the majority of them were seldom employed in speaking roles but rather for dancing, there was a minority of actresses in Rome employed in speaking roles, and also those who achieved wealth, fame and recognition for their art, such as Eucharis, Dionysia, Galeria Copiola and Fabia Arete, and they also formed their own acting guild, the Sociae Mimae, which was evidently quite wealthy. Pat Easterling, Edith Hall: Greek and Roman Actors: Aspects of an Ancient Profession The profession seemingly died out in late antiquity. While women did not begin to perform onstage in England until the second half of the 17th-century, they did appear in Italy, Spain and France from the late 16th-century onward. Lucrezia Di Siena, whose name is on an acting contract in Rome from 10 October 1564, has been referred to as the first Italian actress known by name, with Vincenza Armani and Barbara Flaminia as the first primadonnas and the first well documented actresses in Italy (and Europe). After 1660 in England, when women first started to appear on stage, the terms actor or actress were initially used interchangeably for female performers, but later, influenced by the French , actress became the commonly used term for women in theater and film. The etymology is a simple derivation from actor with added. When referring to groups of performers of both sexes, actors is preferred. Actor is also used before the full name of a performer as a gender-specific term. Within the profession, the re-adoption of the neutral term dates to the post-war period of the 1950 and '60s, when the contributions of women to cultural life in general were being reviewed. When The Observer and The Guardian published their new joint style guide in 2010, it stated \\"Use ['actor'] for both male and female actors; do not use actress except when in name of award, e.g. Oscar for best actress\\". The guide's authors stated that \\"actress comes into the same category as authoress, comedienne, manageress, 'lady doctor', 'male nurse' and similar obsolete terms that date from a time when professions were largely the preserve of one sex (usually men).\\" (See male as norm.) \\"As Whoopi Goldberg put it in an interview with the paper: 'An actress can only play a woman. I'm an actor ‚Äì I can play anything. The UK performers' union Equity has no policy on the use of \\"actor\\" or \\"actress\\". An Equity spokesperson said that the union does not believe that there is a consensus on the matter and stated that the \\"...subject divides the profession\\". In 2009, the Los Angeles Times stated that \\"Actress\\" remains the common term used in major acting awards given to female recipients (e.g., Academy Award for Best Actress). With regard to the cinema of the United States, the gender-neutral term \\"player\\" was common in film in the silent film era and the early days of the Motion Picture Production Code, but in the 2000s in a film context, it is generally deemed archaic. However, \\"player\\" remains in use in the theatre, often incorporated into the name of a theatre group or company, such as the American Players, the East West Players, etc. Also, actors in improvisational theatre may be referred to as \\"players\\".

These directions are based on the actor's point of view as he or she stands on the stage facing the audience. Actors also have to learn the meaning of the stage directions \\"Upstage\\" (away from the audience) and \\"Downstage\\" (towards the audience) Theatre actors need to learn blocking, which is \\"...where and how an actor moves on the stage during a play\\". Most scripts specify some blocking. The Director also gives instructions on blocking, such as crossing the stage or picking up and using a prop. Some theater actors need to learn stage combat, which is simulated fighting on stage. Actors may have to simulate hand-to-hand fighting or sword-fighting. Actors are coached by fight directors, who help them learn the choreographed sequence of fight actions. In film =Silent films= From 1894 to the late 1920s, movies were silent films. Silent film actors emphasized body language and facial expression, so that the audience could better understand what an actor was feeling and portraying on screen. Much silent film acting is apt to strike modern-day audiences as simplistic or campy. The melodramatic acting style was in some cases a habit actors transferred from their former stage experience. Vaudeville theatre was an especially popular origin for many American silent film actors. The pervading presence of stage actors in film was the cause of this outburst from director Marshall Neilan in 1917: \\"The sooner the stage people who have come into pictures get out, the better for the pictures.\\" In other cases, directors such as John Griffith Wray required their actors to deliver larger-than-life expressions for emphasis. As early as 1914, American viewers had begun to make known their preference for greater naturalness on screen. Pioneering film directors in Europe and the United States recognized the different limitations and freedoms of the mediums of stage and screen by the early 1910s. Silent films became less vaudevillian in the mid-1910s, as the differences between stage and screen became apparent. Due to the work of directors such as D W Griffith, cinematography became less stage-like, and the then-revolutionary close-up shot allowed subtle and naturalistic acting. In America, D.W. Griffith's company Biograph Studios, became known for its innovative direction and acting, conducted suit the cinema rather than the stage. Griffith realized that theatrical acting did not look good on film and required his actors and actresses to go through weeks of film acting training. Lillian Gish has been called film's \\"first true actress\\" for her work in the period, as she pioneered new film performing techniques, recognizing the crucial differences between stage and screen acting. Directors such as Albert Capellani and Maurice Tourneur began to insist on naturalism in their films. By the mid-1920s many American silent films had adopted a more naturalistic acting style, though not all actors and directors accepted naturalistic, low- key acting straight away; as late as 1927, films featuring expressionistic acting styles, such as Metropolis, were still being released. According to Anton Kaes, a silent film scholar from the University of Wisconsin, American silent cinema began to see a shift in acting techniques between 1913 and 1921, influenced by techniques found in German silent film. This is mainly attributed to the influx of emigrants from the Weimar Republic, \\"including film directors, producers, cameramen, lighting and stage technicians, as well as actors and actresses\\". =The advent of sound in film= Film actors have to learn to get used to and be comfortable with a camera being in front of them. Film actors need to learn to find and stay on their \\"mark.\\" This is a position on the floor marked with tape. This position is where the lights and camera focus are optimized. Film actors also need to learn how to prepare well and perform well on-screen tests. Screen tests are a filmed audition of part of the script. Unlike theater actors, who develop characters for repeat performances, film actors lack continuity, forcing them to come to all scenes (sometimes shot in reverse of the order in which they ultimately appear) with a fully developed character already. \\"Since film captures even the smallest gesture and magnifies it..., cinema demands a less flamboyant and stylized bodily performance from the actor than does the theater.\\" \\"The performance of emotion is the most difficult aspect of film acting to master: ...the film actor must rely on subtle facial ticks, quivers, and tiny lifts of the eyebrow to create a believable character.\\" Some theatre stars \\"...have made the theater-to-cinema transition quite successfully (Laurence Olivier, Glenn Close, and Julie Andrews, for instance), others have not...\\" In television \\"On a television set, there are typically several cameras angled at the set. Actors who are new to on-screen acting can get confused about which camera to look into.\\" TV actors need to learn to use lav mics (Lavaliere microphones). TV actors need to understand the concept of \\"frame\\". \\"The term frame refers to the area that the camera's lens is capturing.\\" Within the acting industry, there are four types of television roles one could land on a show. Each type varies in prominence, frequency of appearance, and pay. The first is known as a series regular‚Äîthe main actors on the show as part of the permanent cast. Actors in recurring roles are under contract to appear in multiple episodes of a series. A co-star role is a small speaking role that usually only appears in one episode. A guest star is a larger role than a co- star role, and the character is often the central focus of the episode or integral to the plot. In radio Recording a radio play in the Netherlands (1949; Spaarnestad Photo). Radio drama is a dramatized, purely acoustic performance, broadcast on radio or published on audio media, such as tape or CD. With no visual component, radio drama depends on dialogue, music and sound effects to help the listener imagine the characters and story: \\"It is auditory in the physical dimension but equally powerful as a visual force in the psychological dimension.\\"Tim Crook: Radio drama. Theory and practice . London; New York: Routledge, 1999, p. 8. Radio drama achieved widespread popularity within a decade of its initial development in the 1920s. By the 1940s, it was a leading international popular entertainment. With the advent of television in the 1950s, however, radio drama lost some of its popularity, and in some countries has never regained large audiences. However, recordings of OTR (old- time radio) survive today in the audio archives of collectors and museums, as well as several online sites such as Internet Archive. , radio drama has a minimal presence on terrestrial radio in the United States. Much of American radio drama is restricted to rebroadcasts or podcasts of programs from previous decades. However, other nations still have thriving traditions of radio drama. In the United Kingdom, for example, the BBC produces and broadcasts hundreds of new radio plays each year on Radio 3, Radio 4, and Radio 4 Extra. Podcasting has also offered the means of creating new radio dramas, in addition to the distribution of vintage programs. The terms \\"audio drama\\"Compare the entry to H√∂rspiel e.g. in: dict.cc ‚Äì Deutsch-Englisch- W√∂rterbuch or \\"audio theatre\\" are sometimes used synonymously with \\"radio drama\\" with one possible distinction: audio drama or audio theatre may not necessarily be intended specifically for broadcast on radio. Audio drama, whether newly produced or OTR classics, can be found on CDs, cassette tapes, podcasts, webcasts, and conventional broadcast radio. Thanks to advances in digital recording and Internet distribution, radio drama is experiencing a revival.

It was Maud herself who devised a plan for the escape of Prince Edward after he had been taken hostage by Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester following the Battle of Lewes. On 28 May 1265, when the Prince was held in custody at Hereford Castle, Maud sent a party of horsemen to carry him away to Wigmore Castle while he was out in the open fields, some distance from the castle, taking exercise by racing horses with his unsuspecting guardians as she had instructed him to do in the messages she had smuggled to him previously. At a signal from one of the horsemen, Edward galloped off to join the party of his liberators, and they escorted him to Wigmore Castle, twenty miles away, where Maud was waiting. She supplied the Prince with food and drink before sending him on to Ludlow Castle where he met up with the Earl of Gloucester who had defected to the side of the King.

Devices may also display cost of energy used, and estimates of greenhouse gas emissions. Various studies have shown a reduction in home energy use of 4-15% through use of home energy display. Electricity use may be measured with an inductive clamp placed around the electric main, via the electric meter (either through an optical port, or by sensing the meters actions), by communicating with a smart meter, or by direct connection to the electrical system. The display portion may be remote from the measurement, communicating with the sensor using a cable, network, power line communications, or using radio. Online displays are also available which allow the user to use an internet connected display to show near real-time consumption. A means to reduce household energy consumption is to provide real-time feedback to homeowners so they can change their energy use. In 2010, UK based Current Cost announced a partnership with Google PowerMeter, a former online tool that connected to Current Cost devices, enabling users to receive real-time energy information on their customised Google homepage, wherever they were. Real-time data on how much energy is being consumed in the home was sent directly to the Google PowerMeter.

The film's title comes from a traditional Irish song that Gloria Jean sings at a family gathering. Her 2005 biography is similarly titled: Gloria Jean: A Little Bit of Heaven. The film is an unofficial sequel to 1939's The Under-Pup, featuring several cast members from that film, but as different characters.

() is a 1972 giallo film directed by Massimo Dallamano, and starring Fabio Testi, Karin Baal, Joachim Fuchsberger, Cristina Galb√≥, and Camille Keaton. The plot follows a series of violent murders occurring at a Catholic girls' school in England where a young student has gone missing. The film is a co-production between Italian production companies Italian International Films S.r.l., Clodio Cinematografica and West German company Rialto Film. Plot While in a boat making out with a college professor, a young woman sees a man with a knife stabbing another woman in the woods on the nearby shore. The professor convinces his mistress to keep silent about what she saw, especially after it turns out that the dead victim was one of her classmates and was killed by having a long knife pushed deep into her pelvis. Another girl is killed later by the same attacker. The victim was another college student. Shortly afterwards, the professor's mistress is murdered in her bathroom. Police suspect the professor, who admits his affair to his sexually repressed wife in hopes of getting her assistance in order to clear his name. The professor is cleared when a common denominator is determined by the later killings. The victims all had seen a local priest and were friends with a young woman named Solange, who began attending the school the previous semester but had mysteriously vanished. The professor's investigation ultimately leads to the existence of a hedonistic secret club of college girls that his mistress and the other murder victims had belonged to. The police further learn that the priest that several of the victims had spoken to was not a real priest. He was instead Solange's father, a wealthy tenured professor at the same school. Ruth Holden (aka \\"Tata\\") is the elderly maid of Brenda, one of Solange's classmates who was also involved in the sex parties. Ruth is found alongside her dog, viciously murdered by having a shovel rammed into her vagina. The professor, his wife, and the police confront the father, who at first denies any wrongdoing until his daughter Solange appears. Mute and appearing emotionally disturbed, she leads the professor's wife to the place where the final sex club member was kidnapped. The father then confesses to why he murdered his victims. His daughter Solange had befriended the members of the sex club and was granted membership. However, after her first orgy, she became pregnant. The other girls in the sex club insist Solange take care of the situation by meeting with Ruth Holden, who also functions as a back-alley abortionist. She performs the procedure with a long sharp needle. This event traumatizes Solange physically, mentally and emotionally beyond hope. She is henceforth in a very dull mental state where she functions as a baby would, is no longer able to speak and unable to become pregnant. After confessing to the murders, the father then takes his own life. At some point, he realized that an abortion was what led to Solange becoming an invalid and symbolically performed a similar deed on the girls once they'd given him details of what trauma really befell Solange.

The relationship to the genre is enhanced by the appearance of cast members Joachim Fuchsberger and Karin Baal who appeared in several Edgar Wallace adaptations produced by Rialto Film in the 1960s.Mackenzie 2015 (0:08:15) American actress Camille Keaton was cast in the film‚Äîher debut role‚Äîas Solange. Keaton had originally sent in photos for a casting call for a Franco Zeffirelli film. She was not cast in his film, but received a call from director Massimo Dallamano later to invite her in for the role. Keaton described working with Dallamano as challenging as she was only learning to speak Italian and he spoke very little English. For her role, Dallamano told her that she was looking for someone who looked frail and ordered her not to tan while filming.

Reception In contemporary reviews, the German newspaper Hamburger Abendblatt found the film to be \\"too broad\\" but stated that quality acting from Karin Baal, Fabio Testi, Joachim Fuchsberger and G√ºnther Stoll enhance the film. Italian newspaper La Stampa praised the acting of Fabio Testi, Joachim Fuchsberger and Karin Baal while stating the director developed the mystery in the story well. From retrospective reviews, AllMovie called the film a \\"first-rate thriller,\\" a \\"creepy mystery\\", and noted \\"Massimo Dallamano's direction is assured.\\" Video Librarian stated that the film is \\"considered a classic of the Italian horror genre known as giallo\\" but \\"For all the characteristic sloppiness of the screenplay, this film remains unusual and surprising, with some well-directed murder scenes and startling imagery.\\" and it was \\"shamelessly salacious in its exploitation of girls as sexual objects and unsavory in that these minors are assaulted in a vicious, sadistic, and hateful manner\\" and that ultimately \\"the extreme violence against young women makes it hard to enjoy\\". Danny Shipka, author of a book on European exploitation films found the film to be \\"One of the most satisfying gialli of its day\\" and that it had \\"the right amount of sleaze and story to carry the audience through all the twists and turns with an emotionally satisfying ending.\\" The review commented that Dallamano took a \\"serious approach to the subgenre, creating situations that will stay long after you've finished the film.\\" The Herald proclimed the film as \\"a prime example of \\"giallo\\"\\" and that the film was \\"better than it sounds\\" and described it as an influence on Peter Strickand's film The Duke of Burgundy.

One is Arlen Bales, formerly of a small hamlet who, after many hard lessons, has become the Warded Man (so called because he has covered himself in demon- warding runes). Another contender is a desert warrior, a former friend and betrayer of Arlen, who carries a mystical spear (stolen from Arlen) and heads a vast army intent on a holy war against the demons and anyone else who stands in the way. Brett's novellas include the 2010 book The Great Bazaar and Other Stories, the 2011 book Brayan's Gold, and the 2014 book Messenger's Legacy.http://www.subterraneanpress.com/Merchant2/merchant.mv?Screen=PROD‚àè_Code=brett02&Category;_Code=B‚àè_Count=24 Personal life Brett lives in Manhattan with his wife Lauren and his daughters Cassandra and Sirena.

Brett"},{"id":"21504531","text":"H. David Kotz, also known as Harold David Kotz (born June 24, 1966), is a managing director at Berkeley Research Group. Kotz was a litigation associate at three law firms from 1990‚Äì99, and then a labor attorney at the U.S. Agency for International Development from 1999‚Äì2002. He worked at the Peace Corps as a lawyer handling labor and violent crime matters, as well as Inspector General, from 2002‚Äì07. He then was Inspector General at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) from December 2007 until his resignation in January 2012.Weidner, David, \\"SEC losing credibility with Kotz‚Äôs exit\\", MarketWatch, January 17, 2012. Retrieved January 17, 2012. At the SEC, his department conducted investigations about improprieties, conflicts of interest, and the SEC's failure to uncover Ponzi schemes. He referred 30 cases to the Justice Department; 2 were prosecuted, leading to 1 conviction. In 2012, an independent review of his conduct by the Inspector General of the U.S. Postal Service concluded that Kotz violated conflict of interest rules by conducting investigations on persons with whom he had a personal relationship. One conflict involved Kotz accepting three tickets to a football game at a subsidized cost from a financial adviser. Education Kotz graduated cum laude from the University of Maryland, College Park in 1987, with a B.A. in government and politics, and earned his J.D. at Cornell Law School in 1990. Law firms (1990‚Äì99) In his early career, Kotz worked as a litigation associate at three law firms, working on commercial litigation, discrimination, personal injury, and sexual harassment matters: Graham & James (1990‚Äì92) and Stults & Balber (1992‚Äì94) in New York City, and Pepper Hamilton LLP (1994‚Äì99) in Washington, DC. US Agency for International Development (1999‚Äì2002) Kotz worked at the US Agency for International Development (USAID) from 1999‚Äì2002, where he was an Attorney Advisor in the Office of the General Counsel and later a Chief in the Office of Labor and Employee Relations. Peace Corps (2002‚Äì07) Kotz joined the Peace Corps in 2002, and worked there until 2007, during which time he handled labor arbitrations, employee grievances, and prosecutions of rapes, sexual assaults, and other violent crimes against volunteers. For three years, he was an Associate General Counsel. Starting in 2006, he worked for the Peace Corps as Inspector General. SEC (2007‚Äì12) In December 2007, Kotz next became the Inspector General at the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), following the resignation of his predecessor, Walter Stachnik. He was tasked with conducting independent objective audits of SEC procedures and practices promote economy, effectiveness, and efficiency. His reports touched on the SEC not uncovering the Madoff Ponzi scheme and the SEC's office-leasing program after the Dodd- Frank financial overhaul. Kotz's tenure at the SEC was contentious and controversial, marked by critical investigations, charges that some of his investigations lacked evidence of wrongdoing and distorted facts to build a case, criticisms of him for conflicts of interest and ethics violations, and a determination that he had an inappropriate relationship with an SEC employee.Eaglesham, Jean, and Andrew Acherman, \\"SEC to Lose a Loud Critic: Its Watchdog\\" (intro only without subscription), The Wall Street Journal, January 17, 2012. Retrieved January 17, 2012. According to his reports, he referred about 30 cases to the Justice Department, of which 2 were prosecuted, leading to 1 conviction, as of September 2011. Mary Schapiro, Chairman of the SEC, in her announcement of his departure from the SEC praised Kotz as a \\"committed public servant who has served the agency with great distinction.\\" Investigations = Madoff = Kotz investigated why the SEC failed to detect the $19 billion Madoff fraud. Madoff pleaded guilty to fraud and is now serving a 150-year sentence.Diana B. Henriques, \\"Lapses Helped Scheme, Madoff Told Investigators\\", October 30, 2009, The New York Times He also investigated the responses by the SEC to written complaints about Madoff since 1992. In September 2009, Kotz issued a 477-page report that described numerous failures on the part of the SEC in failing to uncover Madoff's Ponzi scheme, despite three examinations and two investigations.Jaffee, Mathew (September 2, 2009). \\"SEC Incompetent in Investigating Madoff Ponzi Scheme, Inspector General Finds‚Äù, ABC News Kotz followed that up with extensive recommendations for improvements to SEC procedures and training.Kouwe, Zachary (September 29, 2009). \\"In Harsh Reports on S.E.C.‚Äôs Fraud Failures, a Watchdog Urges Sweeping Changes‚Äù, The New York Times Speaking of the Madoff victims, Kotz observed: \\"People's lives are destroyed, but they can find some solace in knowing there was change as a result.\\" Kotz's investigation found that the SEC received more than ample information in the form of detailed and substantive complaints over the years. The OIG found that between June 1992 and December 2008 when Madoff confessed, the SEC received six substantive complaints that raised significant red flags concerning Madoff's hedge fund operations and should have led to questions about whether Madoff was actually engaged in trading. One of his findings in his Madoff-related investigations was that the SEC's General Counsel, David M. Becker, had a conflict of interest, as his family had invested $2 million with Madoff.Louse Story and Gretchen Morgenson (September 20, 2011) \\"S.E.C. Hid Its Lawyer‚Äôs Madoff Ties\\", The New York Times Kotz referred the matter to the U.S. Justice Department's criminal division. Becker's lawyer said that SEC officials knew about the investments, and did not recommend that he recuse himself. Becker said: > I have seen Inspector General Kotz do this before, make a big fuss... about > sending reports to the Justice Department. Nothing has happened in any of > them, and some of them ... from my time at the SEC were laughable. The Justice Department declined to pursue the matter. He also investigated whether the romantic relationship between Eric Swanson, the SEC Assistant Director of the Office of Compliance Inspections and Examinations, and Bernie Madoff's niece and in-house compliance attorney Shana Madoff, whom Swanson met in 2003 while he was investigating her uncle Bernie and his firm for running a Ponzi scheme, influenced the SEC's closing of the Madoff investigation. Swanson left the SEC in 2006, became engaged to Shana Madoff three months later, and married her in 2007. Kotz concluded that there was no evidence that their relationship influenced the SEC's closing of the inquiry. \\"Report Details How Madoff‚Äôs Web Ensnared S.E.C.\\", by David Stout, September 2, 2009, The New York Times Financial analyst and whistleblower Harry Markopolos said that Kotz \\"was unflagging [and h]e restored my faith,\\" in the Madoff affair.Greene, Jenna,\\"The Conversation Stopper: SEC Inspector General H. David Kotz: Staffers may not like riding the elevator with him, but the SEC is taking his advice\\", Corporate Counsel, July 27, 2011. Retrieved August 18, 2011. =Stanford= In March 2010, Kotz issued another report finding the SEC also failed to uncover a $7 billion Ponzi scheme perpetrated by Allen Stanford. Kotz found that the SEC had suspected since 1997 that Stanford was running a Ponzi scheme, but did not order a formal investigation until 2005. Kotz accused Spencer Barasch of having a conflict of interest, in that he participated in decisions not to investigate Stanford when he was head of enforcement in an SEC regional office, and then briefly representing Stanford before the SEC after leaving the SEC. In 2012, Barasch agreed to pay a $50,000 fine to settle a Justice Department conflict of interest claim. He stated he did not think he was guilty, but settled to avoid a lengthy court battle. A subsequent 66-page report on Kotz's behavior by Inspector General David C. Williams of the U.S. Postal Service found that Kotz himself \\"appeared to have a conflict of interest\\" and shouldn‚Äôt have opened the investigation, because one of the lawyers involved was a personal friend of his. = Thomsen/Pequot Capital = Kotz investigated a controversy reported by a former SEC lawyer who claimed he was fired in order to thwart his investigation of insider trading at Pequot Capital Management. Kotz recommended that disciplinary action be commenced against Linda Chatman Thomsen, the Director of the Division of Enforcement for the SEC. His recommendation was not accepted, and no disciplinary action was taken. =Pornography= Kotz's investigations in 2010 and 2011 revealed that employees of the SEC had been using their work computers to access pornography sites during business hours. He released two reports documenting his findings. =SEC office lease= In 2011, Kotz issued a report criticizing the SEC for its 900,000-square-foot, $557 million, 10-year lease for new office space. Controversy and departure ;Employee Complaints At least two formal complaints were filed against Kotz by SEC staff members (including Linda Baier, acting Branch Chief of Acquisition Policy, and Nancy McGinley, an enforcement attorney, in April 2011), with the Council of Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency (CIGIE). They alleged that Kotz distorted facts to build a case, and that he created a culture of fear at the SEC of Kotz's \\"false allegations and retaliations\\". Kotz sought to have Baier disciplined, but her managers declined to take action. Kotz similarly sent a criminal referral to federal prosecutors regarding trading by McGinley, but the Justice Department declined to act. Kotz denied the allegations, but ultimately left the SEC in the midst of a scandal concerning ethics and potential conflicts of interest. The allegations, which Kotz denied, were eventually dismissed. Another complainant against Kotz was the office's former Chief of Investigations, David Weber, who accused Kotz of improper conduct in the Madoff investigation. In November 2012, after he was terminated by the SEC, Weber filed a federal lawsuit alleging that the Madoff and Stanford cases might have been compromised by Kotz's personal relationships with some of the people involved. An independent, outside review of Weber's charges by Inspector General David C. Williams of the U.S. Postal Service found that Kotz may have had conflicts of interest in several investigations due to having a personal relationship with the people being investigated. Kotz responded to the civil lawsuit saying that: \\"for some inexplicable reason, my name has been dragged through the mud in the most ludicrous and unbelievable allegations,\\" saying that Weber was hired for a position a couple of weeks prior to Kotz' departure from the SEC, that Kotz barely interacted with him, and did not know anything about why Weber was placed on leave and eventually terminated or about Weber's allegations of retaliation. The SEC settled with Weber for $580,000, one of the highest SEC settlements in a whistleblower retaliation case, in May 2013. ;Report on improper conduct by Kotz Because of concerns of improper conduct by Kotz, Inspector General David C. Williams of the U.S. Postal Service was brought in to conduct an independent, outside review of Kotz's alleged improper conduct. Williams concluded in his Report that Kotz violated conflict of interest rules by conducting investigations on persons with whom he had a personal relationship. He also concluded that Kotz may have had an inappropriate relationship with an SEC employee. One conflict of interest for which Kotz was criticized was his decision to buy three box-seat tickets to a Philadelphia Eagles football game from a financial adviser who had interviewed him for a radio program. Kotz paid $95 each for the tickets (less than half their actual value). Commenting on the matter, Professor Geoffrey Hazard, a legal ethics specialist, said that \\"However passionate a fan you might be of the Eagles, it's just imprudent\\" to take the tickets. Kotz called the incident: \\"an insignificant matter,\\" saying that he paid face value for the tickets and got approval from the ethics office before he made the purchase. The Report questioned Kotz's work on the Madoff investigation, because Kotz was friends with Harry Markopolos, who reported the case to the SEC. Investigators were unable to determine when the friendship began, and thus could not determine conclusively whether or not ethics rules had been violated. The Report also found that Kotz should not have participated in a probe of the re-organization of the SEC‚Äôs office, because he engaged in ‚Äúextensive‚Äù and ‚Äúflirtatious‚Äù communications with a female SEC staffer associated with the project during the probe. Among other things, he emailed her in 2008 a suggestion that she buy a \\"short skirt or two,\\" and as to the dress code he indicated that she would qualify for a ‚ÄúSpecial exemption for after work get togethers.‚Äù Kotz stated he didn't think he had said anything inappropriate, and denied having a personal relationship with the woman. Senator Charles Grassley (R-Iowa) said in a statement that the Report revealed \\"poor judgment\\". ;Departure On January 17, 2012, Kotz resigned amid criticisms of his behavior and questions about his conduct, and the SEC announced that he would leave the agency at the end of January. Kotz announced that he was leaving the SEC, describing the reports he had issued as being \\"significant to the agency, Congress and the investing public\\".Wyatt, Edward (January 17, 2012) ‚ÄúInspector General to Leave S.E.C.‚Äù, The New York Times Senator Grassley, an Iowa Republican who was a frequent critic of the SEC, said: \\"David Kotz produced strong, conclusive reports, even as critics claimed he was too aggressive. An aggressive, independent inspector general is best for the agency in the long run, even if that's uncomfortable for management.\\" Gryphon Strategies (2012) In late January 2012, Kotz joined Gryphon Strategies, a small New York corporate fraud investigation firm, as its Washington representative and managing director. Berkeley Research Group (2012‚Äìpresent) In August 2012, Kotz joined the anti-corruption team as a director in the Financial Institutions practice at Berkeley Research Group. Kotz had become familiar with Berkeley when he hired the firm while he was at the SEC, during the Madoff investigation. In 2013, at Berkeley Research Group, Kotz issued a report commissioned by the National Futures Association regarding a $215 million fraud perpetrated by Russell Wasendorf, as CEO of Peregrine Financial Group. The report found regulators missed warning signs as far back as 1994 and multiple opportunities to catch the fraud. Family Kotz's wife Deborah is a reporter for the Boston Globe. The couple has three children.

Description  Built on J.P. Guilford's work and created by Ellis Paul Torrance, the Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking (TTCT), a test of creativity, originally involved simple tests of divergent thinking and other problem-solving skills, which were scored on four scales: *Fluency. The total number of interpretable, meaningful, and relevant ideas generated in response to the stimulus. *Flexibility. The number of different categories of relevant responses. *Originality. The statistical rarity of the responses. *Elaboration. The amount of detail in the responses. The third edition of the TTCT in 1984 eliminated the Flexibility scale from the figural test, but added Resistance to Premature Closure (based on Gestalt Psychology) and Abstractness of Titles as two new criterion-referenced scores on the figural. Torrance called the new scoring procedure Streamlined Scoring. With the five norm- referenced measures that he now had (fluency, originality, abstractness of titles, elaboration and resistance to premature closure), he added 13 criterion-referenced measures which include: emotional expressiveness, story- telling articulateness, movement or actions, expressiveness of titles, syntheses of incomplete figures, synthesis of lines, of circles, unusual visualization, extending or breaking boundaries, humor, richness of imagery, colourfulness of imagery, and fantasy. According to Arasteh and Arasteh (1976) the most systematic assessment of creativity in elementary school children has been conducted by Torrance and his associates (1960a,1960b, 1960c, 1961,1962,1962a,1963a 1964), who have developed and administered the Minnesota Tests of Creative Thinking (MTCT), which was later renamed as the TTCT, to several thousands of school children. Although they have used many of Guilfords concepts in their test construction, the Minnesota group, in contrast to Guilford, has devised tasks which can be scored for several factors, involving both verbal and non-verbal aspects and relying on senses other than vision. These tests represent a fairly sharp departure from the factor type tests developed by Guilford and his associates (Guilford, Merrifield and Cox, 1961; Merrifield, Guilford and Gershan,1963), and they also differ from the battery developed by Wallach and Kogan (1965), which contains measures representing creative tendencies that are similar in nature (Torrance, 1968). To date, several longitudinal studies have been conducted to follow up the elementary school-aged students who were first administered the Torrance Tests in 1958 in Minnesota. There was a 22-year follow-up,Torrance, E. P. (1980). Growing Up Creatively Gifted: The 22-Year Longitudinal Study. The Creative Child and Adult Quarterly, 3, 148-158.Torrance, E. P. (1981a).

DOI: 10.1080/10400419.2010.523393. Torrance (1962) grouped the different subtests of the Minnesota Tests of Creative Thinking (MTCT) into three categories. # Verbal tasks using verbal stimuli # Verbal tasks using non-verbal stimuli # Non-verbal tasks  Tasks  A brief description of the tasks used by Torrance is given below:  Verbal tasks using verbal stimuli  ; Unusual Uses: The unusual uses tasks using verbal stimuli are direct modifications of Guilford‚Äôs Brick uses test. After preliminary tryouts, Torrance (1962) decided to substitute tin cans and books for bricks. It was believed the children would be able to handle tin cans and books more easily since both are more available to children than bricks. ; Impossibilities task: It was used originally by Guilford and his associates (1951) as a measure of fluency involving complex restrictions and large potential. In a course in personality development and mental hygiene, Torrance has experimented with a number of modifications of the basic task, making the restrictions more specific. In this task the subjects are asked to list as many impossibilities as they can. ; Consequences task: The consequences task was also used originally by Guilford and his associates (1951). Torrance has made several modifications in adapting it. He chose three improbable situations and the children were required to list out their consequences. ; Just suppose task: It is an adaptation of the consequences type of test designed to elicit a higher degree of spontaneity and to be more effective with children. As in the consequence task, the subject is confronted with an improbable situation and asked to predict the possible outcomes from the introduction of a new or unknown variable. ; Situations task: The situation task was modeled after Guilford‚Äôs (1951) test designed to assess the ability to see what needs to be done. Subjects were given three common problems and asked to think of as many solutions to these problems as they can. For example, if all schools were abolished, what would you do to try to become educated? ; Common problems task: This task is an adoption of Guilford‚Äôs (1951) Test designed to assess the ability to see defects, needs and deficiencies and found to be one of the tests of the factors termed sensitivity to problems. Subjects are instructed that they will be given common situations and that they will be asked to think of as many problems as they can that may arise in connection with these situations. For example, doing homework while going to school in the morning. ; Improvement task: This test was adopted from Guilford‚Äôs (1952) apparatus test which was designed to assess ability to see defects and all aspects of sensitivity to problems. In this task the subjects are given a list of common objects and are asked to suggest as many ways as they can to improve each object. They are asked not to bother about whether or not it is possible to implement the change thought of. ; Mother- Hubbard problem: This task was conceived as an adoption of the situations task for oral administration in the primary grades and also useful for older groups. This test has stimulated a number of ideas concerning factors which inhibit the development of ideas. ; Imaginative stories task:In this task the child is told to write the most interesting and exciting story they can think of. Topics are suggested (e.g., the dog that did not bark); or the child may use their own ideas. ; Cow jumping problems: The Cow jumping problem is a companion task for the Mother- Hubbard problem and has been administered to the same groups under the same conditions and scored according to the similar procedures. The task is to think of all possible things which might have happened when the cow jumped over the moon.  Verbal tasks using nonverbal stimuli  ; Ask and guess task:The ask and guess task requires the individual first to ask questions about a picture ‚Äì questions which cannot be answered by just looking at the picture. Next they are asked to make guesses or formulate hypotheses about the possible causes of the event depicted, and then their consequences both immediate and remote. ; Product improvement task: In this task common toys are used and children are asked to think of as many improvements as they can which would make the toy ‚Äòmore fun to play with‚Äô. Subjects are then asked to think of unusual uses of these toys other than 'something to play with‚Äô. ; Unusual uses task: In this task, along with the product improvement task another task (unusual uses) is used. The child is asked to think of the cleverest, most interesting and most unusual uses of the given toy, other than as a plaything. These uses could be for the toy as it is, or for the toy as changed.  Non-verbal tasks  ; Incomplete figures task: It is an adaptation of the ‚ÄòDrawing completion test‚Äô developed by Kate Franck and used by Barron (1958). On an ordinary white paper an area of fifty four square inches is divided into ten squares each containing a different stimulus figure. The subjects are asked to sketch some novel objects or design by adding as many lines as they can to the ten figures. ; Picture construction task or shapes task: In this task the children are given shape of a triangle or a jelly bean and a sheet of white paper. The children are asked to think of a picture in which the given shape is an integral part. They should paste it wherever they want on the white sheet and add lines with pencil to make any novel picture. They have to think of a name for the picture and write it at the bottom. ; Circles and squares task: It was originally designed as a nonverbal test of ideational fluency and flexibility, then modified in such a way as to stress originality and elaboration. Two printed forms are used in the test. In one form, the subject is confronted with a page of forty two circles and asked to sketch objects or pictures which have circles as a major part. In the alternate form, squares are used instead of circles. ; Creative design task: Hendrickson has designed it which seems to be promising, but scoring procedures are being tested but have not been perfected yet. The materials consist of circles and strips of various sizes and colours, a four- page booklet, scissors and glue. Subjects are instructed to construct pictures or designs, making use of all of the coloured circles and strips with a thirty-minute time limit. Subjects may use one, two, three, or four pages; alter the circles and strips or use them as they are; add other symbols with pencil or crayon.

They refer to the local vegetation. The settlement was known as Bukuje in German in the past. History During the Second World War, the Partisans had facilities for preparing and storing food in Bukovje. A Partisan lookout station was located on ƒåelo Hill near the settlement, and a relay station was located in the nearby ≈Ωnidar Shaft ().

History  Early Years (2002‚Äì2007)  Illuminatus formed in 2002 and shortly afterwards entered the Battle of the Bands competition in Nottingham, winning the competition and using the prize money to record and release their first EP, Suburban Symmetry in 2002, which gained acclaim from local press. Their first commercial release, the Aborted Revolutions EP was recorded with Harvey Birrell (Therapy?, Ministry) at Southern Studios in Wood Green, London, and was released in 2003 to good reviews, including I Will Be Heard, who described the EP as \\"...a dark, emotionally charged and often claustrophobic atmosphere that is performed with enthusiasm and masses of vitality, like telling a brothers Grimm tale while hiding in the shadows and then using a loud hailer...\\" A video for the track Wargasm was released shortly afterwards. The success of the EP led to the band securing a space on the Darwin (Unsigned) stage at the Bloodstock Open Air festival in 2003, the first of 3 appearances at the festival with further appearances in 2004 and 2006, supporting acts such as Children of Bodom, Primal Fear and Gamma Ray. The performance introduced the band to Carbon 13 studios based in Runcorn, where they recorded their last EP, the Carbon 13 recordings. This EP was never due for commercial release and was released free to their fans at shows under an agreement with Carbon 13 studios. From 2006 to 2007, the band went through a number of line up changes, and finally the decision was made to continue as a 4 piece without keyboards, with the band returning to the studio to re-arrange their existing tracks.  The Wrath of the Lambs  In 2008, the band began to focus on their newly recorded album, The Wrath of the Lambs, securing the release of the album through AntHill Records with distribution provided by Pinnacle. The album was released on 26 May 2008, receiving good reviews from Room Thirteen and Rock 3 Music magazine. Three videos for the tracks Black and Wait were released in 2008, and another was released in 2009 for Captive State. To support the release, the band went on tour during July 2008, and secured dates on the UK Leg of Ministry's final UK tour, the C-U-LaTour. Their first full UK and Ireland tour took place in October 2008, supporting LA's My Ruin. and they were billed as main support on Breed77 & Susperia's UK tour in May 2009. Illuminatus were also granted the opportunity to play on three dates in June 2009 as support for Prong.  Glasnost  The end of 2009 and early 2010 saw Illuminatus return to the studio to start finalising the writing for their second album, Glasnost. In June 2010, they made a trip over to Hanover, Germany to visit the Institut f√ºr Wohlklangforschung and record the new album with Willi Dammeier. The two-week recording process was documented by the band on their website. The album was released on 7 February 2011 and gained highly praised reviews from a number of international magazines and fanzines including Circle Pit, This Is Not A Scene, Pure Rawk and Dead Press A video for Murdocracy was released on 6 May 2011. In support of the album, the band went on a headline UK tour in February and March, and secured a slot at the 2011 Download Festival. The band have also announced a three date UK tour with Sworn to Oath, and a European tour with Hawklords.

Genetic research from the Stanford University School of Medicine and the University of California, Los Angeles revealed that wolves with black pelts owe their distinctive coloration to a mutation which occurred in domestic dogs, and was carried to wolves through wolf-dog hybridization. Besides coat and knee colour, they are normal grey wolves. Early encounters and speculation Europe Linnaeus gave the black wolves of Europe the binomial name Canis lycaon, under the assumption that the species was distinct from grey and white coloured wolves. Cuvier and other naturalists largely followed his example.Fauna Boreali- americana, Or, The Zoology of the Northern Parts of British America: Containing Descriptions of the Objects of Natural History Collected on the Late Northern Land Expeditions, Under Command of Captain Sir John Franklin, R.N.

They also occurred in the mountains of Friuli (Italy) and around Kotor (Montenegro). Black wolves were also reported in Siberia as the Vekvoturian Mountain-wolf. Colonel Smith erroneously believed that the so-called \\"Rossomak\\" of the Lenas in Siberia was of the same variety. However, in fact, \\"Rossomak\\" in Russian exactly corresponds with the English \\"wolverine\\", a mustelid species, in English (Gulo gulo in Latin). Black wolves were considered rare in northern Europe, however, Dr H√∂ggberg, a medical practitioner at Karlstad mentioned five black wolves being killed in the Swedish province of V√§rmland in 1801. These wolves were completely black and were bigger than the more common grey variety. Their pelts were considered exotic enough to be sold for 3‚Äì4 times the price established for more common colour morphs.Field Sports of the North of Europe: Comprised in a Personal Narrative of a Residence in Sweden and Norway, in the Years 1827‚Äì28 by Llewelyn Lloyd, Published by H.

John Wright, Published by Gray & Bowen, 1831 Historically, the natives of the banks of the Mackenzie River, Saskatchewan River and southern Canada apparently never viewed black wolves as a distinct species. In his 1791 book Travels, William Bartram mentioned seeing black wolves among the few red wolf populations he saw in Florida. He stated that they were \\"perfectly black\\", except the females which were described as having a white spot on the breast. Bartram also described a \\"black wolf-dog of the Florida Indians\\" which was identical to the local wolves, save for the fact that it could bark, and could be trusted around horses. The fur of a black wolf was once considered by the natives of New England to be worth over 40 beaver skins. A chieftain accepting a gift of black wolf fur was seen as an act of reconciliation.

They apparently produced a foul odour.American Natural History, by John Davidson Godman, Edition: 3, published by Hogan & Thompson, 1836 On January 15, 2009, a black male wolf from \\"Mollie's Pack\\" in the Yellowstone National Park's Pelican Valley was weighed in at 143 lbs, making it the largest Yellowstone wolf on record.Bigger is better if you're a hungry wolf, by BRETT FRENCH Of The Billings Gazette Adolph Murie was among the first wolf biologists to speculate that the wide color variation in wolves was due to interbreeding with dogs;Adolph Murie speculated on dog-wolf hybridization as the source of unusual color In 2008, Dr. Gregory S. Barsh, a professor of genetics and pediatrics at the Stanford University School of Medicine used molecular genetic techniques to analyze DNA sequences from 150 wolves, half of them black, in Yellowstone National Park, which covers parts of Wyoming, Montana and Idaho. It was discovered that a gene mutation responsible for the protein beta-defensin 3, known as the K locus, is responsible for the black coat color in dogs. After finding that the same mutation was responsible for black wolves in North America and the Italian Apennines, he set out to discover the origin of the mutation. Dr. Barsh and his colleagues concluded that the mutation arose in dogs 12,779 to 121,182 years ago, with a preferred date of 46,886 years ago after comparing large sections of wolf, dog and coyote genomes. At the University of California, Los Angeles, Robert K. Wayne, a canine evolutionary biologist, stated that he believed that dogs were the first to have the mutation. He further stated that even if it originally arose in Eurasian wolves, it was passed on to dogs who, soon after their arrival, brought it to the New World and then passed it to wolves and coyotes. Black wolves with recent dog ancestry tend to retain black pigment longer as they age. This beta-defensin K locus mutation is a dominant black mutation that occurs in many domestic dog breeds.http://research.hudsonalpha.org/Barsh/wp- content/BarshLabManuscriptPDFs/KernsDogAgoutiMammGenome2004.pdf p.802. However, a recessive black gene also occurs in a few domestic dog breeds (notably in all black German Shepherds, but also in some black Border Collies, Australian Shepherds, and Belgian Shepherds).http://research.hudsonalpha.org/Barsh/wp- content/BarshLabManuscriptPDFs/KernsDogAgoutiMammGenome2004.pdf . p804. This recessive allele is a recessive allele in the Agouti gene in dogs (R96C arginine to cysteine mutation at codon 96). This recessive black gene is also thought to have derived from wild Eurasian black wolves, with one such Russian wolf (a gray male heterozygous recessive carrier who sired black offspring with a domestic black sheepdog) was identified in studies conducted in the 1920s by a Russian biologist.http://research.hudsonalpha.org/Barsh/wp- content/BarshLabManuscriptPDFs/KernsDogAgoutiMammGenome2004.pdf p.804. Scientists have recently discovered a melanistic Indian wolf, a member of the lineage of wolves that has been described by some scientists as \\"the oldest lineage of wolves\\".Lokhande, Amolkumar S.; and Bajaru, Sameer B. 2013. \\" First record of melanistic Indian wolf Canis lupus pallipes from the Indian subcontinent. Journal of the Bombay Natural History Society. 110(3) Sept-Dec: 220-221. Accessed at: https://www.academia.edu/8278227/FIRST_RECORD_OF_MELANISTIC_INDIAN_WOLF_CANIS_LUPUS_PALLIPES_FROM_THE_INDIAN_SUBCONTINENT These scientists (Lokhande and Bajaru) have argued that the presence of melanistic Indian wolves may indicate that the cause of wolf melanism may be more complex than the hypothesis that a single gene for melanism in ancient Old World wolves was acquired by domestic dogs, then lost in wild wolf populations, and then reintroduced into wild wolf populations by interbreeding with domestic dogs. These scientists argue that the melanistic Indian wolf \\"challenges the hypothesis of complete disappearance of the gene responsible for the black coat colour from the gene pool of the Old World wolves\\" and \\"may indicate the recent re-introduction of the gene from dogs to Indian wolves through hybridisation, or recurrence of an independent mutation in Indian wolves.\\" Function As black-colored wolves occur more frequently in forested areas than on the tundra (black coats occur in about 62% of wolves in the forested areas of the Canadian Arctic, compared with about 7% in the icy tundraThe big black wolf is a legacy from dogs, study finds), melanism was concluded by the researchers to give those wolves an adaptive advantage. The mutation's purpose has not yet been identified. Dr. Barsh ruled out camouflage, as wolves have few natural predators, and there is no evidence that a black coat color leads to any increase in hunting success rates.Black Wolf Mystery Solved Dr. Barsh observed that beta-defensin is involved in providing immunity to viral and bacterial skin infections, which might be more common in forested, warmer environments. It has been suggested that the mutation's association with forested habitats means that the prevalence of melanism should increase as forests expand northward. Dark fur is believed to be dominant in wolves.Wolf In Dog's Clothing? Black Wolves May Be First 'Genetically Modified' Predators A mating between a black and a gray wolf resulted in 10 pups with dark fur out of a total of 14. Distribution Black wolves rarely occur in Europe and Asia, where interactions with domestic dogs have been reduced over the past thousand years due to the depletion of wild wolf populations. They have occasionally appeared, as wolf-dog hybrids are known in Russia as \\"black wolves\\", and currently, 20‚Äì25% of Italy's wolf population is composed of black animals. They are more common in North America; about half of the wolves in the reintroduced wolf population in Wyoming's Yellowstone National Park are black. Like Pyrenean wolves, black wolves do not live in France. A wolf's dark pelt is a gift from the dogs In southern Canada and Minnesota the black phase is more common than the white, though gray-colored wolves predominate.

Count Philipp Ludwig II of Hanau- M√ºnzenberg was born in the castle at Hanau and baptised two weeks later on 3 December. His parents were Count Philipp Ludwig I of Hanau-M√ºnzenberg (1553‚Äì1580) and Countess Magdalena of Waldeck (1558‚Äì1599). Guardianship He nominally succeeded his deceased father on 4 February 1580, albeit under the guardianship of Counts John VI, Count of Nassau-Dillenburg (1536‚Äì1606), Louis I, Count of Sayn-Wittgenstein (1568‚Äì1607) and Philipp IV, Count of Hanau- Lichtenberg (1514‚Äì1590), who was replaced in 1585 by his son, Count Philipp V of Hanau-Lichtenberg (1541‚Äì1599). His widowed mother, Magdalena, remarried on 9 December 1581 to Count John VII, the Middle, of Nassau-Siegen (1561‚Äì1623), the son of one of the guardians. In consequence Philipp Ludwig II and his younger brother, Count Albrecht, joined the Nassau-Dillenburg court, a centre of the Reformation movement in Germany and closely tied to the Electorate of the Palatinate of the Rhine. The new ideas he encountered here greatly influenced his life. The guardianship was ended only in 1608 at the behest of the Elector Palatine Friedrich IV (1574‚Äì1610). Family During a wedding feast in Dillenburg that lasted from 23 October 1596 - 3 November 1596, he married Katharina Belgica, third daughter of William the Silent, producing the following children: #Charlotte Louise (1597‚Äì1649 Kassel), not married #Daughter (29 July 1598 ‚Äì 9 August 1598), died unbaptised #Philipp Ulrich (2 January 1601 ‚Äì 7 April 1604 Steinau) #Amalia Elisabeth (1602‚Äì1651 Kassel), married to Wilhelm V, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel #Katharina Juliane (1604‚Äì1668 Hanau), married first on 11 September 1631 to Count Albrecht Otto II of Solms- Laubach, R√∂delheim and Assenheim and secondly on 31 March 1642 to Moritz Christian of Wied-Runkel #Philipp Moritz (1605‚Äì1638), who succeeded him, buried in the Marienkirche in Hanau #Wilhelm Reinhard (1607‚Äì1630 Aachen), buried in the Marienkirche in Hanau #Heinrich Ludwig (1609‚Äì1632) died during the Siege of Maastricht #Friedrich Ludwig (27 July 1610 ‚Äì 4 October 1628 Paris), buried in the family tomb of the Duke of Bouillon in Sedan #Jakob Johann (1612‚Äì1636 Zabern), buried in St. Nikolaus in Strasbourg  Policies  Count Philipp Ludwig II's policies are notable for their drive of modernisation for his tiny state. With his marriage, he came of age, although the regency continued for his younger brother Albrecht. By using his rights under the Cuius regio, eius religio rule, he changed the confession of his county to Calvinism. He succeeded with this nearly everywhere in his sphere of influence, except in a few villages in the district Bornheimerberg, which surrounded Frankfurt and the condominiums shared with the Roman Catholic archbishop-elector of Mainz. The villages in the vicinity of Frankfurt had strong ties to this (mainly) Lutheran city and a majority of the villagers just went to Lutheran services in ‚Äúforeign‚Äù Frankfurt territory. Also in the condominiums Philipp Ludwig II shared with the Archbishopric of Mainz he couldn‚Äôt change anything -- whether they had become Lutheran during the reformation or had remained Roman Catholic. The introduction of Calvinism and its location, at only half a day‚Äôs journey away from Frankfurt with its trade fair, made Hanau an attractive place to settle for Calvinist refugees from France and later from the Southern Netherlands. They were often wealthy traders and were attractive subjects for a ruler in need of tax revenues. In 1597 and 1604, the count and the refugees entered into two treaties which gave them a large degree of self-government and founded the ‚ÄúNew Town‚Äù of Hanau, south to the historic mediaeval settlement. This proved to be a big success and initiated an economic growth for Hanau which lasted even into the 19th century. Philipp Ludwig II also reinstated a Jewish community in Hanau. Space was allocated for the Jews on the southern fortifications of the historic town, which was no longer needed, due to the new town which protected this side of the old town. This Ghetto was not part of one either town, but placed directly under the administrative control of the county. Count Philipp Ludwig II also tried to found a university. He founded the ‚ÄúHohe Landesschule‚Äù in Hanau. It was modeled on the Herborn Academy, where he had studied himself. Even so, it did not develop into a university and it still exists until today as a secondary school.

He ran the leading workshop in Brussels, Belgium, and was appointed instrument maker to the Royal Conservatory in Brussels. His instruments won a number of medals at exhibitions. Biography Nicholas Fran√ßois Vuillaume (NFV) was born in Mirecourt, Vosges, in 1802, the fourth of five sons to Claude-Fran√ßois Vuillaume. The Vuillaume family had been luthiers in Mirecourt for several generations. MillantR. Millant: J.B. Vuillaume ‚Äì sa vie et son oeuvre (J.B. Vuillaume ‚Äì his life and his work) traces a family tree, identifying \\"for sure\\" a great-great-grandfather Claude-Francois Vuillaume (born about 1700). There is a legendary ancestor, one Jean Vuillaume, who was supposedly a pupil of Stradivari, but this remains a legend, and perhaps was invented as a joke.R. Millant Most of the Vuillaume family were destined to become instrument makers, the most famous being NFV's elder brother, the second son Jean-Baptiste Vuillaume (JBV) who became perhaps France's pre- eminent maker and dealer in stringed instruments. From the start, J.B. Vuillaume was the boldest, most audacious and most business-like of the family, moving to Paris at the age of 19, where he worked first in the workshops of Fran√ßois Chanot and Lete, and joining them in partnership before finally setting up his own.A. Mason Clarke: The Violin and old violin makers NFV, like his other siblings, joined his brother business in Paris, and initially made instruments that were labeled J B Vuillaume. While in Paris NFV quickly gained a fine reputation for producing outstanding instruments. With an elder brother of the stature of J.B. Vuillaume, N.F. Vuillaume took perhaps the only course of action open to him in seeking to establish himself as a maker and dealer in his own right ‚Äì he moved to set up his own establishment in Brussels, Belgium. (Millant gives this date as 1820, but 1830 seems more likely given the limited number of his named instruments dating from this period.) Though he owned his own shop, NFV continued to make instruments for JBV, and as JBV's business grew rapidly, NFV was his first choice for work.R. Millant: (English translation by A. Hill) p.96 Examples attributed to NFV as late as 1857 imply that he continued to supply instruments to JBV in addition to those made in his brother's substantial workshop. This convenient arrangement may explain that it took until the year 1833 for NFV to label the 41st instrument in his own name. Over the next few years N.F. Vuillaume sold instruments in his own name at a rate of around 10 a year. Away from the shadow of his brother, NFV flourished and by 1836 had been appointed instrument maker to the Royal Conservatory of Music in Brussels. NFV won a clutch of medals at various exhibitions, including the Medal de Vermeil in 1841 and the Medal First Class at the Universal Exposition in Paris in 1855. In 1873 he was appointed Chevalier to the Order of Leopold. In terms of violin making, Belgium and the Vuillaume family is part of the French School, and for a time the two Vuillaume brothers were the pre-eminent figures in France and Belgium. Over his working life, N.F. Vuillaume produced in excess of 340 instruments bearing his label, and an unknown number under his brother's label. Millant notes that in 1823, JBV started the unusual practice of numbering his instruments - and that Gand and Bernadel adopted the same practice, as did NFV.R. Millant: (English translation by A. Hill) p.90 NFV's instruments are typically branded or signed on the underside of the table with instrument number and date and labeled. In his earlier years he appears to have favoured instruments in the style of Giovanni Paolo Maggini, while later on he moved more towards Stradivari models. Initially he may have operated largely on his own, but as his workshop became established he employed a number of craftsmen who were top makers in their own right including three members of the Darche family‚ÄîCharles Francois, Hilaire and Nicholas (who subsequently set up own shop in Aachen)‚Äîas well as Jean Baptiste Collin-Mezin (prior to setting up his own establishment in Paris in 1867).James N. McKean N.F. Vuillaume operated as a dealer as well as maker and, though never approaching his brother's legendary cache of Cremonese instruments, records on Cozio indicate that the Stradivari cello \\"General Kyd\\" (1684) was bought by N.F. Vuillaume in 1857, and that the Matteo Grofriller cello \\"ex-Muller\\" (1710) and the \\"Cessole\\" Stradivari violin of 1715 also passed through his hands. The Hill brothersW. Henry Hill, Arthur F. Hill & Alfred E. Hill: Antonio Stradivari, His Life and Work (1644-1737) tell that after the death of J.B. Vuillaume in 1875, \\"Le Messie\\" (the Messiah) Stradivari violin was offered to NFV for the price of 12,000 francs, but the offer was refused. Before his death in 1876, N.F. Vuillaume's business and title as \\"Luthier du Conservatorie Royal de Musique Bruxelles\\" had been taken on by Georges Mougenot. For a number of years afterwards, at least as late as 1885, instruments bearing NFV labels were still produced from his workshop. A double bass by Georges Mougenot labeled from 1875, the year he took over the shop of NFV in Brussels, reads as the \\"Royal Maker of Liege\\". This double bass is a Vuillaume model but with a Mougenot label from Liege.

Built in a disused quarry, it is one of the largest indoor climbing walls in the world. It was purchased by the City of Edinburgh Council and fully reopened in May 2007 after a further programme of works costing around . The centre is now used by both recreational climbers and for competitions, and is also home to the Scottish National Judo Academy. History Interior of the Arena Originally used for supplying stone to the Central Belt of Scotland due to its proximity to the Union Canal, the quarry expanded from around a third of its present size in 1853 to the current outline in 1895. Edinburgh climbers Rab Anderson, Duncan McCallum and architect David Taylor formed the Ratho Quarry Company, and purchased the quarry in 1995 as the site for the climbing centre. The quarry, which had been unused for around ninety years, was filled with compacted rubble and heavily overgrown with trees and shrubs, making assessment of the site difficult until significant work had been carried out, but the assumption that the floor of the quarry was flat proved to be correct. Plans unveiled in late 2001 showed the estimated cost to be , with funding of to come from a Sportscotland lottery fund grant. The climbing centre is located in the smaller of two lobes of a figure of eight that make up the quarry. After of rubble was removed, the quarry was shown to have a broadly level floor and be almost deep. During construction in April 2002, the partially completed roof was ripped off in a storm. When it opened in December 2003, the centre was the largest indoor climbing arena in the world, but problems during construction increased the final cost to . In March 2004 the centre went into receivership due to a leaky roof, poor management, and a lack of money, leaving a number of contractors unpaid.

His family emigrated to the United States in 1904, following the Kishinev pogrom. He began his medical studies at Harvard University in 1919 and, on graduating in 1923, entered Harvard Medical School, receiving his M.D. in 1927. Shortly after finishing medical school, Diamond studied briefly with Florence Sabin at the Rockefeller Institute before returning to New England, where he spent several years studying pediatrics at Boston Children's Hospital under the guidance of Dr. Kenneth Blackfan. Diamond set up one of the first pediatric hematology research centers in the United States at Children's. Focusing on anemias, by 1930, he had succeeded in identifying thalassemia, a hereditary anemia that affected children of Italian and Greek ancestry. In 1932, along with Blackfan, he identified erythroblastosis fetalis, later called hemolytic disease of the newborn, at that time a significant disorder among newborns. In 1938, Diamond and Blackfan described 4 cases of infant erythroid hypoplastic anemia and which was to become known as Diamond-Blackfan Anemia.Diamond, L. K., Blackfan, K. D. Hypoplastic anemia. Am.

First mentions   First phone call  On September 2, 1999 a journalist working for the Agence France-Presse news agency in Grozny received a phone call from someone by the name of Khasbulat. The caller identified himself as a member of the Army of the Liberation of Dagestan and claimed that it was responsible for the explosion at Manezhnaya Square in Moscow on 31 August 1999. He added that similar acts would occur throughout the Russian Federation until Russian soldiers left Dagestan. According to Khasbulat, the Army of the Liberation of Dagestan was a subdivision of the Islamic Army of Caucasus led by Sheikh Muhammed Baggaudin. The leader of the Wahhabi community, Sheikh Baggaudin, a native in the village of Karamakhi, had created this army in response to the assault of the federal troops on his birthplace.  Anonymous phone call  On September 9, 1999, an anonymous person speaking with a Caucasian accent called the Interfax news agency, saying that the blasts in Moscow and Buynaksk were \\"our response to the bombings of civilians in the villages in Chechnya and Dagestan.\\"Dr Mark Smith, A Russian Chronology July 1999 - September 1999–í–∑—Ä—ã–≤ –∂–∏–ª–æ–≥–æ –¥–æ–º–∞ –≤ –ú–æ—Å–∫–≤–µ –ø–æ–ª–æ–∂–∏–ª –∫–æ–Ω–µ—Ü —Å–ø–æ–∫–æ–π—Å—Ç–≤–∏—é –≤ —Å—Ç–æ–ª–∏—Ü–µ  Second phone call  On September 15, 1999, an unidentified man, again speaking with a Caucasian accent, called the ITAR-TASS news agency, claiming to represent the Liberation army of Dagestan. He said, that the explosions in Buynaksk and Moscow were carried out by his organization. According to him the attacks were a retaliation to the deaths of Muslim women and children during Russian air raids in Dagestan. \\"We will answer death with death,\\" the caller said.Russia caught in sect's web of terror  Reception   Officials  Russian officials from both the Interior Ministry and FSB at the time expressed skepticism over the claims. Sergei Bogdanov of the FSB press service in Moscow said that the words of a previously unknown individual representing a semimythical organization should not be considered as reliable. Bogdanov insisted that the organization had nothing to do with the bombing.‚Äô‚ÄôIslam in Russia‚Äô‚Äô by Shireen Hunter, Jeffrey L. Thomas, Alexander Melikishvili, J. Collins. P.91 On September 15, 1999 a Dagestani official also denied the existence of a \\"Dagestan Liberation Army\\".  Reddaway and Glinski  According to professor Peter Reddaway and researcher Dmitri Glinski, the involvement of the Liberation army of Dagestan is a more plausible theory than others and may indeed have perpetrated them, with or without Russian government assistance. They wrote that if this was the case the group would likely originate from the religious conservative villages Karamakhi, Chabanmakhi and a few other neighbouring villages in central Dagestan. They also wrote that if so, they believe \\"it is impossible that the Moscow authorities did not know of the plans, at least in general terms\\", noting that \\"even before Stepashin visited the district a year earlier, they must have been receiving numerous reports from, in particular, the FSB, the Interior ministry and probably eavesdropping agency FAPSI.\\" A journalist who in mid- August 1999 traveled to Karamakhi and interviewed some villagers and their military Commander General Dzherollak, wrote: \\"The Wahhabis' trucks go all over Russia. Even one wrong move in Moscow or Makhachkala, they warn, will lead to bombs and bloodshed everywhere.\\" According to the journalist the Wahhabis had told him, \\"if they start bombing us, we know where our bombs will explode.\\" In the last days of August, Russian military launched an aerial bombing of the villages.  Murphy  According to former US counter- terrorism official Paul J. Murphy, Russia's official investigation of the bombings proved, that the Liberation Army of Dagestan is the same as Al- Khattab's Islamic Army of Dagestan, which launched the invasion of Dagestan from Chechnya in August 1999.

Competing for his daughter Diana, ranch hand Colby sabotages recovering alcoholic foreman Bull, and takes his job. The local stage is repeatedly robbed of gold bullion from the owner's mine, and Bull is suspected. The cowardly sheriff does not take action on the robberies. Rich Easterner Wainwright tries to buy the mine and ranch for a low price, but Henders refuses the offer and discusses the property's true value with Diana. She is intrigued by Wainwright's Eastern-educated son Jefferson, who proposes marriage. However, when they are attacked by Indians during the roundup, he runs rather than defend her. Henders is mortally wounded in the battle. Henders will bequeaths his property to his brother John back East so that he can take care of Diana, but John dies too. The Wainwrights pretend that Henders had agreed to a sale, but Diana knows better. Diana's Eastern cousin Lillian brings Corson, a lawyer, to try to seize the ranch and gold mine. They insist that the ranch and mine are nearly played out, and that they should sell the property, offering her a small amount. They show their ignorance about western ways. Bull encourages Diana that the property is worth more than they say, and advises her that the Wainwrights are often at the mine. The Eastern lawyer finally announces that Diana has no property rights due to the wills. As pressure from the opposing forces builds, a mob goes to hang Bull for the stage robberies, but Diana warns him in time. Bull discovers there are papers that will prove Diana's claim to the property, and that Lillian has seduced Colby to obtain his help. Bull actually does rob the stage, simply to obtain the papers supporting Diana. Diana recognizes him at the robbery, and is devastated because she is starting to have feelings for him. She orders the Wainwrights, Lillian and Corson off the property, and fires Colby. Bull has the Mexican Gregorio deliver the important papers to Diana, showing that Lillian is not related to John and thus not entitled to the property. The villains try to take over the ranch.

Biography  Adrian Jack was born on 16 March 1943, in Datchet, near Slough, Buckinghamshire, England. He was educated at Merchant Taylors' School, Northwood (1954‚Äì60), and the Royal College of Music, London (1961‚Äì64), where he studied composition with Peter Racine Fricker, fugue and orchestration with Gordon Jacob, piano with Antony Hopkins and organ with John Birch. From 1967 to 1969 he studied composition and electronic music with W≈Çodzimierz Koto≈Ñski at the State Higher School of Music in Warsaw, Poland. Jack started composing at the age of 13. He later studied at the Royal College of Music. The main conscious influence at that time was Messiaen. Hearing Boulez's \\"Le marteau sans maitre\\" brought a new atonal complexity to his music, replaced by an austere paring-down following his discovery of Edgard Var√®se. He actually wrote to Var√®se to ask if he could study with him in New York and received a letter of refusal, not very long before Var√®se died in November 1965. For the next 20 years, Jack composed somewhat intermittently, but his works included \\"Holly Bush\\", written in Poland and given a public rehearsal by the London Sinfonietta under Roger Norrington at the Queen Elizabeth Hall, London; a piano concerto for Roger Woodward, which was never performed; a monodic piece for any instruments or voices, \\"You told me so yourself\\", which received performances by different soloists and groups both in England and abroad; and \\"A piece for learning\\" ‚Äì a \\"variable\\" score performed under Richard Bernas's direction at the Dartington Summer School. Jack lectured at the Royal College of Music from 1969 to 1977, then he joined BBC Radio 3 as a script-writer for music programmes. He left the BBC in 1993 and for the next ten years was active as a freelance music critic and devised and presented several radio programmes on music and architecture for BBC Radio 3 with the producers Tim Thorne and Antony Pitts, and two notable examples of radiogenic work, \\"Chromatic Fantasy\\" and \\"From the Diary of a Fly\\".Antony Pitts - producer Jack had written about music regularly since 1970, first for the monthly Music and Musicians, then for Time Out, where he was Classical Music and Opera Editor from 1975 to 77, as well as for most of the quality national papers, notably The Guardian and, later, The Independent. The other activity was as director of a series at the Institute of Contemporary Arts (ICA) in London, devoted to new music. It ran from 1978 to 1995. In 1986 the American pianist Yvar Mikhashoff requested a tango (\\"Tin-Pan Tango\\") to perform at the Almeida Festival in London. This kick-started a revival in Jack's composition. Reacting against his own earlier music and most of the experimental or avant-garde music he promoted at the ICA, Jack now wrote music which is, broadly speaking, tonal, and in which the emphasis is on continuity and a sense of line. Among his ensemble pieces, \\"Jigsaw\\" and \\"Notelette\\" were requested and performed by Sounds Positive, while \\"Zigzag\\" was requested and performed (including a broadcast on Radio 3) by Cambridge New Music Players (now known as \\"New Music Players\\". His \\"Piano Trio\\" (the first of three works for the medium) was originally requested and performed by London New Music and became his most widely played work, taken up by three other groups and broadcast twice in different performances. Jack's first two string quartets were played and broadcast by The Smith Quartet, and the third, fourth, fifth and sixth recorded by the Arditti Quartet for the Deux-Elles. Of over 50 solo piano pieces, many have been performed and broadcast by Noriko Kawai and Iain Burnside, and all of Jack's music for piano duo has been performed by the Danish-based duo, Ingryd Thorson and Julian Thurber. Many of his scores are lodged with the British Music Information Centre (BMIC) and recordings at the British Library Sound Archive. Owing to ill health Adrian Jack no longer composes or makes public appearances.

He was a leading landowner and enlightened in the way he ran his business, studying agricultural science. He was a patriot even before the unification of Italy (). After the annexation of Sicily by Italy in 1860, Turrisi Colonna was made leader of the Palermo National Guard. He became a member of the Italian Senate (1865) and in the 1880s served twice as mayor of Palermo.Lupo, History of the Mafia, pp. 43-44 In 1864, Turrisi Colonna wrote a study, Public Security in Sicily, in which he described a \\"sect of thieves\\" that operated across Sicily and which is considered to be an early description of the Mafia, although he did not mention the term. This \\"sect\\" had special signals to recognize each other, had political protection in many regions, and a code of loyalty and non- interaction with the police known as umirt√† or omert√† (\\"humility\\").Dickie, Cosa Nostra, pp. 39-46 The sect was mostly rural, comprising plantation wardens and smugglers, among others. The sect made \\"affiliates every day of the brightest young people coming from the rural class, of the guardians of the fields in the Palermitan countryside, and of the large number of smugglers; a sect which gives and receives protection to and from certain men who make a living on traffic and internal commerce. It is a sect with little or no fear of public bodies, because its members believe that they can easily elude this.\\"Paoli, Mafia Brotherhoods, p. 33 Turrisi Colonna warned in his report that the Italian government's brutal attempts to crush unlawfulness only made the problem worse by alienating the populace. He seemed to have known what he was talking about, as there was widespread suspicion that he was the protector of some important Mafiosi in Palermo. Domenico Farini, longtime president of the Senate, recalled that some members of Parliament told him in private in 1876 that Turrisi Colonna was the head of the Mafia.

ENSI's headquarters are located in Brugg in the Canton of Aargau. For its part, ENSI is supervised by the ENSI Board: this body is elected by the Swiss Federal Council, to which it reports directly.  History  Until the end of 2008, the Principal Nuclear Safety Division (HSK) within the Swiss Federal Office for Energy (SFOE) was the technical supervisory body responsible for nuclear plants in Switzerland. Its headquarters were located at W√ºrenlingen in the Canton of Aargau. The HSK monitored the safety of the five nuclear power plants operating in Switzerland and the country's other nuclear facilities. At the same time, HSK performed the function of supervising radiation protection for all the nuclear plants, as well as tasks in connection with the interim and final storage of radioactive waste. HSK was then monitored by the Swiss Federal Nuclear Safety Commission (KSA), a body consisting of non-executive experts in nuclear safety. These tasks mentioned above have been performed by the Swiss Federal Nuclear Safety Inspectorate ENSI since 1 January 2009. In accordance with a law adopted by the Federal Assembly, the HSK was separated from the Swiss Federal Office of Energy (SFOE) and was converted into an independent regulatory supervisory authority. This step satisfied the requirement for the independence of the regulatory body as stipulated in the Convention on Nuclear Safety, a legal text adopted at the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in 1994 and setting the bases for nuclear safety worldwide and ratified by Switzerland subsequently.  Legal basis  ENSI's organisation is governed by the Swiss Federal Nuclear Safety Inspectorate Act (ENSI Act, ENSIG). Most of the legislative bases for ENSI's supervisory activities are laid down in the Swiss Federal Nuclear Energy Act (NEA/KEG) and the Swiss Federal Law on Radiological Protection (LRaP/StSG).\\"Classified Compilation of Federal Legislation\\"  ENSI's remit  According to the Swiss Federal Nuclear Energy Act, an operator is responsible for the safety of its plant.\\"Swiss Federal Nuclear Energy Act\\" ENSI verifies whether the operator fulfils this responsibility, and organises its own analyses, inspections and supervisory discussions in order to obtain its own bases for this assessment. ENSI's supervisory activities can be divided into two main areas: assessment of facilities and surveillance of operations.  Assessment of facilities  = Basic principles and guidelines = Nuclear plants are assessed and monitored on the basis of laws, guidelines and underlying technical and scientific principles which define the safety requirements and assessment criteria to be applied by ENSI. The Inspectorate continues to develop these basic principles and guidelines according to the state-of-the-art in science and technology. For this purpose, ENSI promotes research into nuclear safety, is represented in over 70 international committees and bodies specialising in the field of nuclear safety and security, and participates in the continuous development of international safety standards. Aspects covered by the guidelines include the definition of radiation protection objectives for the operation of nuclear plants, arrangements for reporting on the operation or organisation of nuclear power plants, and specification of requirements for deep geological repositories. = Expert reports = ENSI draws up expert safety reports when nuclear plant operators submit applications that go beyond the scope of their existing operating licences. For example, the periodic safety reviews (PSRs) undertaken by all the nuclear power plants are assessed by ENSI, and the results are recorded in an expert report together with any conditions that may be imposed. = Permits = ENSI processes applications for changes to nuclear plants which are covered by existing operating licences and issues permits if the decisions are positive. Examples include changes to components and systems that are classified as important to safety, or changes to technical specifications.  Surveillance of operations  = Monitoring, inspection and approval = ENSI reviews reports from operators, conducts supervisory discussions and monitors nuclear plants (including their organisation and operation) by carrying out on-site inspections. ENSI only permits individuals with the necessary skills and education to occupy safety- relevant positions in nuclear plants. = Planned Maintenance Outages = Each nuclear power plant organises an annual planned maintenance outage lasting several weeks, when maintenance work and repairs are carried out in the plant. The fuel is renewed at the same time. ENSI is present during these planned maintenance outages, which it also supervises. = Radiation monitoring = ENSI monitors compliance with the radiation protection regulations and dose limits. It monitors discharges of radioactivity from nuclear plants and compliance with the discharge limits. ENSI also determines radiation exposure for the general public and the plant staff. = Remote monitoring and forecasting = ENSI operates a measuring system around each nuclear plant for the purpose of automatic dose rate monitoring, together with a system to transmit plant parameters from the nuclear power plants. In case of an incident, this data enables ENSI to issue forecasts regarding the potential dispersion of radioactivity in the surrounding area.Dispersion modelling of the Swiss Federal Nuclear Safety Inspectorate ENSI = Processing events = Events at Swiss and foreign nuclear plants are systematically assessed to determine their significance in terms of nuclear safety. Based on an assessment of the measures implemented by the operator, ENSI examines whether the knowledge gained can be applied to other nuclear plants in Switzerland; if necessary, ENSI requests improvements. = Emergency preparedness = ENSI is integrated into a nationwide organisation to deal with serious incidents, which includes the National Emergency Operation Centre (among other bodies).Emergency Preparedness and Zone Plans = Safety assessment = ENSI collates all the data acquired during the course of a year into a Systematic Safety Evaluation, from which it derives any measures that may be required as well as the plans for its future supervisory activities. ENSI also provides information to the public in its annual reports on the safety of nuclear plants, radiation protection and the experience accumulated from operation and research.Compilation of ENSI annual reports  Analyses following the reactor accident at Fukushima  Following the Fukushima nuclear disaster, ENSI analysed the events with the help of an interdisciplinary team of experts. The results, including the \\"Lessons Learned\\", were presented to the public in four reports published between August and December 2011.Compilation of information on Fukushima After Fukushima, Swiss nuclear power plants also had to prove their ability to cope with a 10,000-year flood, a 10,000-year earthquake and a seismically induced flood. In addition, Switzerland voluntarily took part in the EU Stress Test.Compilation of information on EU Stress Test Swiss nuclear power plants had to implement various improvement measures as a result of these reviews.  The 2009 operating year  The Swiss nuclear plants registered 24 reportable events during 2009. Eleven of these events took place in the two reactors of the Beznau nuclear power plant, four at M√ºhleberg, three at G√∂sgen and four at Leibstadt. There were also two events in the nuclear facilities of the Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI). The event on 3 August 2009 at Beznau was assigned to level 2 on the International Nuclear Event Scale (INES); the event at G√∂sgen on 24 June 2008 (which was reported after a delay) was assigned to level 1, and the other events during the reporting year were classified as level 0. As regards events of this sort, this was definitely the worst operating year for the Swiss nuclear power plants since at least 1995.ENSI Oversight Report 2009  The 2010 operating year  The 41 reportable events in 2010 were distributed as follows among Switzerland's nuclear plants: a total of ten for the two reactors at the Beznau nuclear power plant, eleven for G√∂sgen, five for Leibstadt and fourteen for M√ºhleberg. To put the events at M√ºhleberg into context, ENSI states that the disturbances occurred \\"essentially\\" during the commissioning of new equipment. Two reportable events at INES level 0 took place in the nuclear facilities of the PSI during 2010. ENSI did not register any events at the two research reactors of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Lausanne and the University of Basel. 40 out of the 41 events can be classified at INES level 0. ENSI assigned one event to INES level 2: this occurred during the planned maintenance outage at the Leibstadt nuclear power plant on 31 August 2010. In this case, the permitted radiation dose of 20 millisievert (mSv) per year was exceeded for one diver. However, this event did not constitute an infringement of the Federal Law on Radiological Protection.ENSI Oversight Report 2010  The 2011 operating year  There were 31 reportable events in the Swiss nuclear power plants during 2011. Of these, 30 were assigned to level 0 of the INES International Nuclear Event Scale and one was classified at level 1 on the scale. Seven events concerned the Beznau nuclear power plant, units 1 and 2; five events affected G√∂sgen, and there were eleven at the Leibstadt nuclear power plant, four at the M√ºhleberg nuclear power plant, three in the nuclear facilities of the Paul Scherrer Institute, and one in the research reactor of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Lausanne. ENSI did not register any events at the Swiss national central interim storage facility for radioactive waste (ZWILAG) or in the research reactor at the University of Basel. The INES-1 event was reported as the consequence of a potential blockage of the water intake for the special emergency system during an extreme flood at the M√ºhleberg nuclear power plant. This finding prompted the operator of the power plant, BKW-FMB Energie AG, to shut the plant down prior to the date of the planned maintenance outage in order to carry out back-fitting.ENSI Oversight Report 2011  The 2012 operating year  There were 35 reportable events at the Swiss nuclear plants during 2012. 14 of these concerned the two units of the Beznau nuclear power plant; eight were at the G√∂sgen nuclear power plant, five occurred at the Leibstadt nuclear power plant, six took place at the M√ºhleberg nuclear power plant and two involved the nuclear facilities of the PSI. ENSI did not register any reportable events in the Swiss national central interim storage facility for radioactive waste (ZWILAG) at W√ºrenlingen, or at the research reactors of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Lausanne and the University of Basel. The reportable events included four reactor scrams: one each at the M√ºhleberg and G√∂sgen nuclear power plants, and two at the Beznau plant. ENSI classified one event during 2012 at level 1 on the INES scale, which ranges from 0 to 7. This involved a disturbance in unit 2 of the Beznau nuclear power plant: the special emergency diesel generator (SEDG) failed to start during a periodic function test. The unit was started with compressed air but did not ignite. The plant's specialist staff were summoned to vent the fuel feed line, after which the unit started when another attempt was made. All the other events during the year were below the range of the INES event scale, i.e. they were classified at level 0.ENSI Oversight Report 2012  The 2013 operating year  In 2013, there were 37 reportable events in the Swiss nuclear power plants: seven events at the two Beznau units, seven at G√∂sgen, seven at Leibstadt and 13 at M√ºhleberg. During operation, there were no reactor scrams recorded. On the INES scale, ranging from 0‚Äì7, ENSI rated all reportable events in nuclear power plants in 2013 as Level 0. ENSI did not register any events at the ZWILAG, the two research reactors or the Paul Scherrer Institute. ENSI evaluates the safety of each nuclear power plant as part of a systematic safety evaluation. This reflects both reportable events and other findings, in particular the results of the approximately 460 inspections conducted by ENSI during 2013.ENSI Oversight Report 2013  The 2014 operating year  As for 2014, there were 39 reportable events in the Swiss nuclear facilities: five events at each of the two Beznau units, eleven at G√∂sgen, nine at Leibstadt and eight at M√ºhleberg. There was one reportable event at the University of Basel research reactor.

A Textbook on Polarized-Light Spectroscopy. . The Royal Society of Chemistry ‚Äì London 2010 It is the property of a material whose transmittance depends on the orientation of linearly polarized light incident upon it. As a technique, it is primarily used to study the functionality and structure of molecules. LD measurements are based on the interaction between matter and light and thus are a form of electromagnetic spectroscopy. This effect has been applied across the EM spectrum, where different wavelengths of light can probe a host of chemical systems. The predominant use of LD currently is in the study of bio-macromolecules (e.g. DNA) as well as synthetic polymers.  Basic information  Linear polarization LD uses linearly polarized light, which is light that has been polarized in one direction only. This produces a wave, the electric field vector, which oscillates in only one plane, giving rise to a classic sinusoidal wave shape as the light travels through space. By using light parallel and perpendicular to the orientation direction it is possible to measure how much more energy is absorbed in one dimension of the molecule relative to the other, providing information to the experimentalist. As light interacts with the molecule being investigated, should the molecule start absorbing the light then electron density inside the molecule will be shifted as the electron becomes photoexcited. This movement of charge is known as an electronic transition, the direction of which is called the electric transition polarisation. It is this property for which LD is a measurement. The LD of an oriented molecule can be calculated using the following equation:- :LD = A‚ïë\\\\- A‚î¥ Where A‚ïë is the absorbance parallel to the orientation axis and A‚î¥ is the absorbance perpendicular to the orientation axis. Note that light of any wavelength can be used to generate an LD signal. The LD signal generated therefore has two limits upon the signal that can be generated. For a chemical system whose electric transition is parallel to the orientation axis, the following equation can be written: :LD = A‚ïë\\\\- A‚î¥ = A‚ïë > 0 For most chemical systems this represents an electric transition polarised across the length of the molecule (i.e. parallel to the orientation axis). Alternatively, the electric transition polarisation can be found to be perfectly perpendicular to the orientation of the molecule, giving rise to the following equation: :LD = A‚ïë\\\\- A‚î¥ = - A‚î¥ < 0 This equation represents the LD signal recorded if the electric transition is polarised across the width of the molecule (i.e. perpendicular to the orientation axis), which in the case of LD is the smaller of the two investigable axes. LD can therefore be used in two ways. If the orientation of the molecules in flow is known, then the experimentalist can look at the direction of polarisation in the molecule (which gives an insight into the chemical structure of a molecule), or if the polarisation direction is unknown it can be used as a means of working out how oriented in flow a molecule is.  UV linear dichroism  Ultraviolet (UV) LD is typically employed in the analysis of biological molecules, especially large, flexible, long molecules that prove difficult to structurally determine by such methods as NMR and X-ray diffraction. DNA DNA is almost ideally suited for UV LD detection. The molecule is very long and very thin, making it very easy to orient in flow. This gives rise to a strong LD signal. DNA systems that have been studied using UV LD include DNA-enzyme complexes and DNA-ligand complexes,Hannon, M.J., Moreno, V., Prieto, M.J., Molderheim, E., Sletten, E., Meistermann, I., Isaac, C.J., Sanders, K.J., Rodger, A. ‚ÄúIntramolecular DNA coiling mediated by a metallo supramolecular cylinder‚Äù Angewandte Chemie, 2001, 40, 879‚àí884 the formation of the latter being easily observable through kinetic experiments. Fibrous protein Fibrous proteins, such as proteins involved in Alzheimer‚Äôs disease and prion proteins fulfil the requirements for UV LD in that they are a class of long, thin molecules. In addition, cytoskeletal proteinsElaine Small, Rachel Marrington, Alison Rodger, David J. Scott, Katherine Sloan, David Roper, Timothy R. Dafforn and Stephen G. Addinall ‚ÄòFtsZ Polymer-bundling by the Escherichia coli ZapA Orthologue, YgfE, Involves a Conformational Change in Bound GTP‚Äô 2007, Journal of Molecular Biology, 369: 210-221. can also be measured using LD. Membrane proteins The insertion of membrane proteins into a lipid membrane has been monitored using LD, supplying the experimentalist with information about the orientation of the protein relative to the lipid membrane at different time points. In addition, other types of molecule have been analysed by UV LD, including carbon nanotubesAlison Rodger, Rachel Marrington, Michael A. Geeves, Matthew Hicks, Lahari de Alwis, David J. Halsall and Timothy R. Dafforn ‚ÄòLooking at long molecules in solution: what happens when they are subjected to Couette flow?‚Äô 2006, Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics, 8: 3161-3171. and their associated ligand complexes.  Alignment methods  Couette flow The Couette flow orientation system is the most widely used method of sample orientation for UV LD. It has a number of characteristics which make it highly suitable as a method of sample alignment. Couette flow is currently the only established means of orientating molecules in the solution phase. This method also requires only very small amounts of analysis sample ( 20 - 40 ¬µl) in order to generate an LD spectrum. The constant recirculation of sample is another useful property of the system, allowing many repeat measurements to be taken of each sample, decreasing the effect of noise on the final recorded spectrum. Its mode of operation is very simple, with the sample sandwiched between a spinning tube and a stationary rod. As the sample is spun inside the cell, the light beam is shone through the sample, the parallel absorbance calculated from horizontally polarised light, the perpendicular absorbance from the vertically polarised light. Couette flow UV LD is currently the only commercially available means of LD orientation. Stretched film Stretched film linear dichroism is a method of orientation based on incorporating the sample molecules into a polyethylene film.Heinz Falk, Gunther Vormayr, Leon Margulies, Stephanie Metz and Yehuda Mazur ‚ÄòA Linear Dichroism Study of Pyrromethene-, Pyrromethenone- and Bilatriene-abc-Derivates‚Äô 1986, Monatshefte fur Chemie, 117 : 849-858. The polyethylene film is then stretched, causing the randomly oriented molecules on the film to ‚Äòfollow‚Äô the movement of the film. The stretching of the film results in the sample molecules being oriented in the direction of the stretch.  Associated techniques  Circular Dichroism LD is very similar to Circular Dichroism (CD), but with two important differences. (i) CD spectroscopy uses circularly polarized light whereas LD uses linearly polarized light. (ii) In CD experiments molecules are usually free in solution so they are randomly oriented. The observed spectrum is then a function only of the chiral or asymmetric nature of the molecules in the solution. With biomacromolecules CD is particularly useful for determining the secondary structure. By way of contrast, in LD experiments the molecules need to have a preferential orientation otherwise the LD=0. With biomacromolecules flow orientation is often used, other methods include stretched films, magnetic fields, and squeezed gels. Thus LD gives information such as alignment on a surface or the binding of a small molecule to a flow-oriented macromolecule, endowing it with different functionality from other spectroscopic techniques. The differences between LD and CD are complementary and can be a potent means for elucidating the structure of biological molecules when used in conjunction with one another, the combination of techniques revealing far more information than a single technique in isolation. For example, CD tells us when a membrane peptide or protein folds whereas LD tells when it inserts into a membrane.Hicks, M.R.; Damianoglou, A.; Rodger, A.; Dafforn, T.R.; ‚ÄúFolding and membrane insertion of the pore-forming peptide gramicidin occurs as a concerted process‚Äú Journal of Molecular Biology, 2008, 383, 358-366 Fluorescence detected Linear Dichroism Fluorescence-detected linear dichroism (FDLD) is a very useful technique to the experimentalist as it combines the advantages of UV LD whilst also offering the confocal detection of the fluorescence emission.Gabor Steinbach, Istvan Pomozi, Otto Zsiros, Aniko Pay, Gabor V. Horvat, Gyozo Garab ‚ÄòImaging Fluorescence detected linear dichroism of plant cell walls in laser scanning confocal microscope‚Äô 2008, Cytometry Part A, 73A : 202-208. FDLD has applications in microscopy, where can be used as a means of two-dimensional surface mapping through differential polarisation spectroscopy (DPS) where the anisotropy of the scanned object allows an image to be recorded. FDLD can also be used in conjunction with intercalating fluorescent dyes (which can also be monitored using UV LD). The intensity difference recorded between the two types of polarised light for the fluorescence reading is proportional to the UV LD signal, allowing the use of DPS to image surfaces  References  Category:Spectroscopy ","title":"Linear dichroism"},{"id":"21505777","text":"John Walters (11 June 1760 ‚Äì 28 June 1789) was a Welsh Anglican priest and poet.

From the time of its drafting, the Convention took more than 17 years to enter into force on 17 August 2014.Current Status of Convention, United Nations\\"Convention on the Law of the Non-Navigational Uses of International Watercourses: Entry into Force\\", 19 May 2014. With the treaty having been ratified by just 36 states, the majority of countries, especially the key ones, remain outside its scope. The convention, however, is regarded as an important step in establishing international law governing water. In northern hemisphere autumn of 2008, the UN began reviewing a law proposed by the International Law Commission to serve similar purpose to the unratified document, but was considering adopting the proposal as guideline rather than immediately attempting to draft it into law. Background The International Law Commission (ILC) was requested by the United Nations in 1970 to prepare viable international guidelines for water use comparable to The Helsinki Rules on the Uses of the Waters of International Rivers, which had been approved by the International Law Association in 1966 but which failed to address aquifers that were not connected to a drainage basin. After the ILC completed its project in 1994, the UN Sixth Committee drafted the Convention on the Law of Non-Navigational Uses of International Watercourses based on their proposal. The General Assembly adopted the document on 21 May 1997 with only three dissenting in a vote of 106. Provisions The document sought to impose upon UN member states an obligation to consider the impact of their actions on other states with an interest in a water resource and to equitably share the resource, mindful of variant factors such as population size and availability of other resources. Each member state that shares in a resource is required to provide information to other sharing states about the condition of the watercourse and about their planned uses for it, allowing sufficient time for other sharing states to study the use and object if the use is perceived to be harmful. The document permits a state with urgent need to immediately utilize a watercourse, providing that it notifies sharing states both of the use and the urgency. In the event that a use is perceived to be harmful, it requires member states to negotiate a mutually acceptable solution, appealing for arbitration as necessary to uninvolved states or international organizations such as the International Court of Justice. The treaty also requires states to take reasonable steps to control damage, such as caused by pollution or the introduction of species not native to the watercourse, and imposes an obligation on states that damage a shared water resource to take steps to remedy the damage or to compensate sharing states for the loss. It includes provisions for managing natural damage to waterways, such as caused by drought or erosion, and mandated that sharing states notify others immediately of emergency conditions related to the watercourse that may affect them, such as flooding or waterborne diseases. Article 7 controversy Article 7 of the document, entitled, \\"Obligation not to cause significant harm,\\" requires that member states \\"in utilizing an international watercourse in their territories ... take all appropriate measures to prevent the causing of significant harm to other watercourse states\\" and compensate sharing states for any such harm. According to Stephen McCaffrey of the McGeorge School of Law, this is \\"the most controversial provision\\" of the Convention, with conflict stemming from the fact that a state may have legitimate uses for a watercourse in its nation that can negatively impact other nations.McCaffrey, \\"Chapter 2: The UN Convention on the Law of Non-Navigational Uses of International Watercourses\\", 20-21. He offers the following example: > Suppose ... upstream State A has not significantly developed its water > resources because of its mountainous terrain. The topography of the > downstream states on the watercourse, B and C, is flatter, and they have > used the watercourse extensively for irrigation for centuries, if not > millennia. State A now wishes to develop its water resources for > hydroelectric and agricultural purposes. States B and C cry foul, on the > ground that this would significantly harm their established uses. McCaffrey indicates that controversy here stemmed from the UN's adaptation of text by the ILC with the intention of strengthening the obligation to do no harm, as the ILC's language more heavily emphasized the \\"equitable utilization\\", or balance of the various needs of the states.McCaffrey, \\"Chapter 2: The UN Convention on the Law of Non-Navigational Uses of International Watercourses\\", 21.

The MicVac method is a pasteurization method for the food processing industry producing ready meals. Food ingredients are inserted into a package, which is sealed. The food is then cooked and pasteurized in the sealed package. During the heating process a valve on the package opens and releases steam and oxygen. The process time is short since the food is pasteurized with microwaves. When the microwave heating process stops the valve closes. Remaining steam condenses and causes an underpressure in the package. The final result is a cooked, pasteurized and vacuum-packed product. The short cooking time in combination with the absence of oxygen in the pack is unique for the method and has many advantages. The method has been used in the food industry since 2005. The inventor of the technique is Dr. Joel Haamer and the company MicVac was founded in August 2000. Already in the 1970s, when Haamer tried to find a solution for better taking care of mussels, which are heat-sensitive and easily get rancid, he got the first ideas to the method. In the end of the 1990s, the microwave technology had reached such a progress that Haamer's idea was patented. During 5 years the development work took place and then, in 2005, the method was commercialized.

He was born in Saint Peter, Jersey and died in Surrey. The autobiographical accounts of his survival of Fort de Romainville, Buchenwald and the Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp complex were published as The Faramus Story in 1954 and Journey into Darkness in 1990. Two books about Agent Zigzag, the double agent Eddie Chapman, also document aspects of Faramus's 'ruse' to join the Nazis as a collaborator and a spy, his imprisonment in Jersey, Paris and the concentration camps. Arrest Faramus worked as a hairdresser in a Saint Helier salon and later, during the early stages of the German occupation of the Channel Islands, was employed in the kitchen of the Miramar Hotel. In the spring of 1940 he attempted to join the Royal Air Force but was not accepted. Faramus was also a petty criminal and in December 1940, at the age of 20, he received a 6-month prison sentence for obtaining ¬£9 under false pretenses. Faramus was incarcerated in H.M. Prison Jersey, sharing the same cell as Eddie Chapman, who later described Faramus as \\"a hopeless crook\\". Under the conditions of military occupation, the administration of civil law and order was subject to the dictates of the German authorities. As at the time of his arrest Faramus had in his possession an anti-Nazi leaflet, the German authorities added 1 month to his sentence. Faramus names Centenier Arthur Tostevin, an Honorary Police officer of Saint Helier and Detective Constable Benjamin Shenton as the officials who had informed the Germans about the leaflet. Faramus and Chapman quickly struck up a friendship while in prison. They arranged to meet after they were released, and consequently shared a flat. For a short period they ran a barber shop together. Their customers included civilians and German soldiers alike. The shop also served as a useful front for the black market activities of another of Faramus's criminal associates, Douglas Stirling. Deported In late 1941, Chapman hatched a plan to get himself, Faramus and Stirling off the island. The plan was simple: they would turn traitor and offer to work as spies for the Nazis. Stirling was the most enthusiastic, while Faramus was cautious of the risks of becoming an open collaborator, but agreed to follow the plan. Chapman and Faramus composed a letter in German, offering their services as German spies, which they sent to the German Command post in St. Helier, addressed to General Otto von St√ºlpnagel, the officer in command of occupational forces in France and the Channel Islands. Late one night in November 1941 Chapman and Faramus were summoned by the Germans ‚Äì‚Äì but they were not being recruited, they were being arrested. Their plan to join and work for the Nazis backfired spectacularly, as the pair were taken to mainland France, and thence by rail to Fort de Romainville in Paris where they worked and using their skills, stole rations and fuel and make a key to enter the women's section of the prison. After a year, Faramus along with other prisoners from Romainville, was taken in terrible conditions by train via Compi√®gne onto the Buchenwald concentration camp near Weimar, Germany, 55 of the 120 dying in his carriage en route, from suffocation, dysentery and thirst. Anthony Faramus is on the right of the photo, prisoner No.(E)42324. Buchenwald. August 1944. In chapter 7 of Journey into Darkness, Faramus describes the crime for which he was taken out of the Buchenwald camp and forced on a journey to Mauthausen via Leipzig, Dresden and Prague: > \\"... a freezing cold morning, at my place of work ‚Äî ‚ÄòKommando das Grab' > (communal graves) ‚Äî I had momentarily set aside my shovel to blow into my > hands and fingers. I had not seen the approach of the SS Warrant Officer. > Failing to acknowledge the man's presence and not coming to attention and > removing my cap from my head until he had passed by was one crime, the > interruption of my work without permission was another. I was punched and > booted; worse, my number (E)42324 was noted in his book of reports.\\" The Nazi Party defined Mauthausen as \\"Grade III\\". Its purpose was to punish \\"Incorrigible Political Enemies of the Reich\\" with extermination through labour. In Journey into Darkness Faramus acknowledges Captain Maurice PertschuckProfile, BBC. Retrieved 13 June 2016. who was murdered in Buchenwald in 1944, Christopher Burney and Lt Jack H. Taylor. In film footage gathered by the US Department of Defense after the 11th Armored Division of the 3rd US Army entered the camp on 5 May 1945, Lt. Jack H. Taylor spoke about his capture, imprisonment and the conditions at Mauthausen. Faramus also mentions Pierre Serge Choumoff, a mathematician and engineer, imprisoned in Romainville and Mauthausen, who later investigated the Mauthausen-Gusen complex. Post- World War II Anthony Faramus (left) photographed by Mark Gerson with front cover artwork (right) by Michael Ayrton for Faramus's first account of the concentration camps; The Faramus Story 1954. For over a year after the war Faramus lived in Paris as he searched for some of the women and men that he had known whilst imprisoned in Fort de Romainville. During this period he lost a lung following surgery for tuberculosis which he contracted during his imprisonment in Mauthausen. He returned to Britain and after a series of jobs in hotels and bars he found work as an extra in various films produced at Pinewood Studios. Faramus emigrated to the United States with his wife Mary where they both had careers in the film industry. Faramus worked as an actor and played the roles of a British officer in The Colditz Story and a POW in King Rat. He also worked as Clark Gable's butler and chauffeur. After living in California, he and Mary moved back to Britain living in London and later in Farnham, Surrey. In the 1970s, he joined the Hunt Saboteurs Association an organisation whose aim is to disrupt blood sports using direct action tactics. In the late 1980s Faramus returned to his direct action past, believing that force, if it was ever justifiable, was so for a strictly defensive basis, such as to defend the weak and helpless from violence and aggression. He was arrested for his defence of wildlife at a hunt in Hampshire in 1989. He refused to be bound over to keep the peace in the sum of ¬£500 and was sent to Winchester prison for a month. He described his experience to a fellow hunt saboteur \\"as worse than his time at Fort de Romainville: no officer at Winchester Prison ever called him Tony\\", it was always the impersonal Faramus. An operation to remove his lung in the 1950s as a result of the TB contracted in the concentration camps led to his death in August 1990, aged 70. More than 100 people, including actors, hunt saboteurs and concentration camp survivors attended his funeral at St Andrew's Church, Farnham in 1990. Dave Wetton, a founder of the Hunt Saboteurs Association in the 1960s read a funeral address. References Notes Bibliography *Anthony Faramus. Journey into Darkness. Foreword by Greville Janner.

No compositions by him survive, and his historical importance lies chiefly in his activities as a teacher. The first recorded reference to Bredemers is in a 1488 document which lists him as one of the singers of Cathedral of Our Lady (Onze-Lieve-Vrouwekathedraal), Antwerp. In 1491‚Äì1492 he served as organist of Saint James' Church (Sint- Jacobskerk) of the same city, and in 1493 he occupied a similar position at the Confraternity of Our Lady at Our Lady's church. Bredemers must have attained a considerable reputation in the following years: by 1501 he was distinguished enough to enter the chapel of Philip the Handsome as organist.Picker, Grove. The chapel, known then as Grande chapelle, was the main musical establishment of the Burgundian-Habsburg court, and one of the most important court chapels of the Renaissance: it had a long and illustrious history associated with composers of the Burgundian School, particularly Guillaume Dufay. And at the time Bredemers joined it, members of the chapel included important composers such as Pierre de la Rue and Alexander Agricola. He was charged with performance duties as well as organisation of the chapel.Brauchli 1998, 52. Bredemers and other musicians of the chapel travelled with the court on multiple occasions: there were two voyages to Spain (in 1501‚Äì1503 and 1505‚Äì1506) and one to Heidelberg (in 1503). On the latter occasion Bredemers must have met Arnolt Schlick, court organist to the Electoral Palatinate.Keyl 1989, 120. Eleanor of Austria, one of Bredemers' pupils, was reported to be a particularly talented and passionate performer on the clavichord When Philip died in 1506 at Burgos, Spain, it was Bredemers who arranged for the transport of the chapel's liturgical and music books to Antwerp. Philip's eldest son, Charles, was too young to succeed his father, and so Margaret of Austria was appointed regent. At her court in Mechelen, Bredemers was chosen in 1507 as music teacher of Philip's children (Charles and his sisters Eleanor, Mary and Isabella) and organist of Charles' domestic chapel. He was also to instruct court entertainers and choirboys, as well as purchase and maintain instruments. Bredemers taught Charles and his sisters clavichord daily, as well as other instruments. Bredemers' influence was spread far by Philip's children. Isabella's lessons came to an end in 1514 when she married Christian II of Denmark, and Eleanor left in 1518, after marrying Manuel I of Portugal (and after Manuel died, she married Francis I). Before leaving, both sisters asked Bredemers to buy them clavichords to take with them; Eleanor was known as a particularly fine performer.Brauchli 1998, 53. Bredemers retired to Lier in 1518, but continued assisting at Margaret's private chapel, and accompanied Charles during his visit to England in 1520‚Äì1521. He probably attended Charles' coronation in 1520. In May 1521 Bredemers was made provost at St Aubin's Cathedral, Namur. However, he resigned this position after only a year, in April 1522. He died the following month. No compositions by Bredemers are known, although two were mentioned by F√©tis in his Biographie universelle in the second half of the 19th century. Bredemers' importance lies in the influence he must have exerted over European keyboard music during his voyages to Spain, England and Germany, as well as through his pupils.

The adaptation made is usually [always?] to non-functional characteristics rather than functional ones. Something of a misnomer, because the thing that adapts is the working system, rather than the (more abstract) architecture which defines the adaptability that is required of that system. Adaptive software architecture: Used by programmers in relation to a program. An adaptive algorithm \\"is an algorithm which changes its behavior based on the resources available. For example‚Ä¶ in the C++ Standard Library, the stable partition [program] acquires as much memory as it can get (up to what it would need at most) and applies the algorithm using that available memory.\\" Adaptive infrastructure architecture: Used by infrastructure engineers in relation to the configuration of processors. The computing resources used by applications (the partition size, or the number of servers in a cluster, or the share of a processor, or the number of processes) are configured so that they shrink or grow with demand. Adaptive business architecture: Could also be used (for example) in connection with a workflow system that assigns human resources to a task or service to match the demand for that task or service. Or an organisation structure that flexes in response to business changes.

You guess!) is a mimic show where the contestants mimic a famous celebrity. The show aired on STAR One on Saturdays at 9pm from 27 December 2008 to 5 April 2009. It is basically a mimicry contest. Every week eight artists are called upon to mimic well- known personalities (Johny Lever, Lal Krishna Advani, Manoj Kumar, Salman Khan etc.) and three best are chosen. Overview The show is hosted by well-known mimic Navin Prabhakar, who first shot to fame from his celebrated appearances in the show The Great Indian Laughter Challenge (season one). Prabhakar mimics different celebrities in different episodes. He has mimicked well-known actors Jeetendra, Pran, Johnny Walker, Kamal Hasan, Sunil Dutt, and several others. His own performance is inarguably one of the best mimicries in the entire show. The show is innovative as the first a mimicry contest on Indian TV. The show is judged by Chunky Pandey and Suresh Menon. The name of the show is a take on the catchphrase Pehchan Kaun (translation: Guess Who?) first popularized by Navin Prabhakar in his appearances in The Great Indian Laughter Challenge. After several dialogues of Sholay entered into the psyche and mannerisms of Indians, this is perhaps the first catchphrase to do so. Being the pioneers in original comedy concepts, STAR One has come back with a new show Hello Kaun? Pehchaan Kaun. This show is the hunt for India's best mimic. It's the hunt for that mimic who can walk the walk and talk the talk of a celebrity.

In the case of the catalytic hydrogenation the aromatic, planar part of the diisononyl phthalate is transformed to a cyclohexane ring by a formal addition of 6 hydrogen atoms while the alkyl and ester groups are not affected by the hydrogenation. Based on the catalysator used, the resulting product consists of 90% of the cis and 10% of the trans isomer of the cyclohexane-1,2-dicarboxlic acid diisononylester.  Regulatory approval  Food contact In the European Union the European Food Safety Authority has approved 1,2-cyclohexane dicarboxylic acid diisononyl ester for a wide variety of food contact applications in October 2006.EFSA: Opinion of the Scientific Panel on food additives, flavourings, processing aids and materials in contact with food (AFC) on a request related to a 12th list of substances for food contact materials, EFSA-Journal, 2006, 395‚Äì401, 1‚Äì21.

New Safety Law Doesn't Mean All's Well In Toyland. NPR. Accessed 2009-02-12. In the European Union 1,2-cyclohexane dicarboxylic acid diisononyl ester was not listed in directive 2005/84/EC. These restrictions for certain phthalates are now transferred into Annex XVII, 51 and 52 of Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 which ban the use of certain phthalates in toys and childcare articles and thus DINCH can be used safely in toys and childcare articles.Official Journal of the European Union: Directive 2005/84/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 December 2005 amending for the 22nd time Council Directive 76/769/EEC on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States relating to restrictions on the marketing and use of certain dangerous substances and preparations (phthalates in toys and childcare articles)  Possible Health Effects  A research group from Harvard and CDC found suggestive negative associations between urinary MHiNCH, the monoester of DINCH, a minor urinary metabolite. . Their research at a fertility clinic showed that women who had been exposed to DINCH had lower, but statistically not significant estradiol hormone levels and fewer, again not statistically significant number of oocytes in their ovaries. However, urinary MHiNCH concentrations were unrelated to mature oocyte yield and endometrial wall thickness. The results are inconclusive and therefore, the authors suggest that more epidemiological studies would be needed for clarification. The Swedish IVL Environmental Research Institute and researches from the Department of Environmental Science and Analytical Chemistry of Stockholm University recommend that \\"children's exposure to DINCH should be investigated in more detail and exposure to the general population should be closely monitored\\" as DINCH is used as an alternative plasticizer in e.g. children's toys. The Chronic Hazard Advisory Panel of the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission \\"strongly encourages the appropriate U.S. agencies to obtain the necessary toxicological and exposure data to assess any potential risk from DINX\\" because of \\"lack of publicly available information\\". A French group from the University of Clermont-Ferrand noted that clinical data and data regarding the migration from Medical Devices would be rare. The Project was funded by the French Agency for the Safety of Health Products (ANSM). It remains unclear why this Research Group was not able to identify the published human biomonitoring data which give a perfect overview on population exposure of alternative plasticizers (e.g. DINCH/DINX) and their metabolites. A report by the Danish Ministry of the Environment states that the available data for DINCH do not indicate a need for further investigations. Further, the conclusion is that 3 of the evaluated plasticizers, namely the substances COMGHA, DEHT and DINCH may be seen as the most promising alternatives, as these substances have an extended data set (complying to Annex X data requirements, i.e. a two-generation reproduction study) without indicating specific concern for reproductive toxicity or endocrine activity. Toxicogenomic screening showed that 648 genes were significantly changed after 48 hours exposure to DINCH suggesting that \\"DINCH is biologically active\\".

He was arrested on 25 February 2009 by British police and convicted for the murder of Graham McKenna that occurred on The Wirral the previous 10 January 2009. Murder of Graham McKenna Graham McKenna was a former soldier, having served 22 years with the 22nd (Cheshire) Regiment. He was still involved with the military, holding the rank of corporal. He had taught Territorial Army recruits at 42 Brigade‚Äôs Regional Training Centre at Altcar, Formby, on the morning of his death. Mr McKenna and his son were walking towards a bus stop on Upton Road, Claughton, when Finlay ambushed them. They were repeatedly shanked in the abdomen but managed to stagger to nearby Speedwell Road. Both were taken to Arrowe Park hospital where Mr McKenna died. Despite multiple stab wounds Michael survived. Although the police had not yet released details of the conversation which took place during the incident, there seemed to be little doubt as to the identity of the attacker. Finlay connection to the McKenna was that his ex-wife is a sister of McKenna's widow. His motive was that McKenna had offered to give evidence in Finlay's acrimonious divorce proceedings. Finlay also stabbed Graham's son, Michael McKenna, age 14, a pupil at Ridgeway school in Prenton. Both victims were attacked shortly after leaving their home to go to watch a football match at Goodison Park, the home of Everton Football club. Father and son were season ticket holders. Following the murder, Finlay went on the run. The hunt for him received massive publicity on Thursday 12 February 2009, after an emotional and moving appeal for information made by McKenna's widow was repeatedly broadcast on BBC Radio 5. His older brother, Paul appealed for him to give himself up to police. Members of the public were advised not to approach him, as he was considered to be dangerous, and that if anyone saw him they should report the sighting to their nearest police station. Gary Finlay appeared on UK's \\"most wanted list\\" and on UK TV news. The story was featured in the UK National newspapers and was also carried by international news agencies. Finlay was sentenced to a minimum of 25 years after admitting to the murder of Graham McKenna and attempted murder of his son Michael McKenna.

Playing career Wakefield Trinity career One of the most under-rated players in Wakefield Trinity‚Äôs history is three-time Wembley winner, Keith Holliday. The wily scrum half was one of the club‚Äôs great servants and ranks sixth on the club‚Äôs all-time appearance list, with ten winner's medals, as well as county and international recognition. Holliday's Trinity career spanned fourteen years (1952‚Äì66); he played 438 times. Only Neil Fox has played more post-war Trinity games. He was an outstanding local product and arrived at Wakefield Trinity via Cathedral School and Eastmoor ARLFC. He progressed through the intermediate and A-teams before making his d√©but in the first match of the 1952‚Äì53 season, scoring a try in a 30‚Äì21 victory over Doncaster. Holliday made steady progress, starting out as a stand off and alternating in the centres and within four years of his d√©but, he represented Great Britain, partnering Don Fox, in an unofficial 18‚Äì10 victory over France at Odsal Stadium, Bradford in 1956. He added to his representative honours a season later when he was stand off for Yorkshire, in defeat by Cumberland at Recreation Ground (Whitehaven), Whitehaven. By the late 1950s, Trinity were coming out of the wilderness on the domestic front, reaching their first major final in five years. A 23‚Äì5 Yorkshire Cup Final victory over Hunslet gave Keith the first of his cup winner's medals in 1956. He had now formed a formidable half back partnership with Ken Rollin, and it was not until 1958 when he moved to scrum half when Harold Poynton became his half back partner. The try-maker turned try scorer with two scorching tries at Wembley in 1960, when Trinity defeated Hull FC, 38‚Äì5 to win the RL Challenge Cup. It was the first of three Challenge Cup winners medals for Keith as he was at scrum half, again, in 1962 and 1963 which went alongside four Yorkshire League Championship winners medals (1959, 1960, 1962 and 1966) and two further Yorkshire Cup winners medals (1961‚Äì62 and 1964‚Äì65). He was also one win away from the League Championship on two occasions after final losses in 1960 and 1962; Keith playing in nine major finals for Trinity, winning six. Keith remained the major tradesman at scrum half throughout the early 1960s, the club being one win away from winning ‚ÄòAll Four Cups‚Äô on 1961‚Äì62 and being rewarded with a testimonial season in 1962‚Äì63. He gained his second county cap in 1961, captaining Yorkshire in defeat by Lancashire at Hilton Park, Leigh. He moved to loose forward in 1964 before playing his last game for Trinity, in defeat by Hull, in March 1966. He then moved to Bramley as player coach.

It consisted of three large BL 15-inch Mk. I naval guns installed on land by the British government in the late 1930s to defend the approaching path to the east of the island to their large naval base located at Sembawang in the north (accessed via the Johor Straits) from an attacking enemy naval force.  History  Five massive 15‚Äìinch naval guns were installed in Singapore by the British government before 1940, with three based in Changi to the east and two located in Buona Vista to the southwest. Collectively, the three naval guns in Changi formed the Johore Battery, named after the King of Johor, Sultan Ibrahim, who gave King George V of the UK a grand royal gift of ¬£500,000 for his Silver Jubilee in 1935, of which ¬£400,000 of the amount was used by the British government to fund the installation of the three large naval guns in Changi. In early 1942, the Johore Battery was employed in the Allied artillery bombardment of Johor Bahru, which at that time was under Japanese military occupation following the retreat of all Allied forces from British Malaya to Singapore. Singapore in early February 1942, with the disposition of Allied ground forces shown in red. The British naval base at Sembawang is on the northern tip of the island and Changi being on the small peninsula on the easternmost side. Built by the British government in 1939 for the naval defence of Singapore (in particular, to defend Singapore from an aggressive Imperial Japan, which had possessed a strong and a powerful navy by the later part of the 1930s and was expanding deeper and deeper into China), the Johore Battery is a large gun emplacement site consisting of a labyrinth of tunnels. These tunnels were used to store quantities of ammunition for the three 15-inch guns (most of which were of the armour-piercing (AP) type rather than the high-explosive (HE) type as these naval guns were intended to be employed against heavily armoured enemy warships). A 15-inch AP shell in the process of being hoisted up to the gun- breech in Singapore in 1940 (note the size of the shell in relation to the soldier standing beside). These naval guns were the largest to be installed on land outside of Britain itself during World War II. They were all destroyed before the official surrender of the British Army on 15 February 1942 to the conquering Imperial Japanese military and the related tunnels (for the storage of the ammunition for the guns and gun-crew quarters) were sealed up and almost forgotten after the war in 1945. In 1948 one of the guns was demolished and returned to England as scrap. In 1950 the Royal Army Ordnance Corps began an exercise to remove live gun shells that were buried at Changi during the British evacuation in 1942. The location remained a largely-unknown secret until the Singapore Prisons Service re-discovered them by chance in April 1991.  Conservation  The former site of the Johore battery now includes a replica of the large naval gun and a dummy 15-inch shell, placed upon a modern large lifting-lever; allowing visitors to have a feel of its 800kg weight by trying to hoist it up from the ground. The old, and still inaccessible, tunnels are marked out in a maze of above ground trails. A plaque detailing the history of the battery is present at the hut forming the entrance to the site. Admission to the site of the battery is free with opening hours 09:00 to 17:00 Monday to Friday. The compound also includes a restaurant. .

He was one of the first and youngest American soccer players to have played in continental Europe, joining PSV Eindhoven's youth side in 1991 and playing there for two years. Coming from a sporting family, his grandparents were leading Swedish figure skater Vivi-Anne Hult√©n and Finnish figure skater Gene Theslof. Biography Playing career Having grown up in a family of renowned skaters, with both his grandparents and parents being skaters, Theslof was exposed to sports being a viable career option from a very early age. While his younger brother Tyler initially chose to become an ice hockey goaltender (though he later changed to being a soccer midfielder himself, playing for UC Irvine), Nick was interested in soccer and began playing for the youth indoor soccer club, the Cleveland Crunch. In 1991, his coach at the club, former English striker Ron Wigg, advised then PSV Eindhoven head of youth development Huub Stevens to have a look at Theslof, during a match for which PSV's reserve team had come to Cleveland. Stevens, impressed with Theslof's potential, offered him a youth contract at PSV, which Theslof accepted and moved from his home in Columbus to Eindhoven, the Netherlands. He subsequently played for PSV for the next two years, before his career abruptly ended due to an Achilles injury. He later moved back to the United States and attended UCLA, where he later played for their soccer team, where his performances were lauded. On February 1, 1998, the Columbus Crew selected Theslof in the 1998 MLS College Draft, but he was released during the 1998 season without playing a first team game. He moved to the Orange County Waves for the 2000 USL A-League season.2000 Orange County Waves In 2005 and 2006, Thesloff inserted himself into several Blue Star games.2004 Orange County Blue Star 2006 Orange County Blue Star Coaching career Theslof began his coaching career as Dr. Jay Martin's assistant at Ohio Wesleyan University between 1998 and 2000, winning the NCAA Division III national title in 1998. Following his stay at Ohio Wesleyan, Theslof became head coach of the Orange County Blue Star, a team of the American Premier Development League and spent time with Juergen Klinsmann who enjoyed Amateur Soccer in Southern California. During that time he also coached future American national team players Sacha Kljestan and Sal Zizzo. In 2004, Theslof coached his old club PSV's youth squad in the Netherlands. After Klinsmann became manager of the German national team, he appointed Theslof as coach and scout in 2006 during the 2006 FIFA World Cup, where he wrote detailed match summaries and reports for Klinsmann. In February 2008, after he was appointed manager of FC Bayern Munich, Klinsmann appointed Theslof as a second assistant coach and scout. On April 27, 2009 Klinsmann and his two assistant coaches were released early, even though they had won five of the previous seven league games and were only three points behind league leader VfL Wolfsburg.

It appears to be a variant of the , otherwise known as the , and , which are depicted as ape-like, bird-like, or torso-less (cephalopod-like) and usually 3-legged.  Legend  An amabie appeared in Higo Province (Kumamoto Prefecture) according to legend, around the middle of the fourth month, in the year K≈çka-3 (mid-May 1846) in the Edo period. A glowing object had been spotted in the sea, almost on a nightly basis. The town's official went to the coast to investigate and witnessed the amabie. According to the sketch made by this official, it had long hair, a mouth like bird's bill, was covered in scales from the neck down and three- legged. Addressing the official, it identified itself as an amabie and told him that it lived in the open sea. It went on to deliver a prophecy: \\"Good harvest will continue for six years from the current year; if disease spreads, draw a picture of me and show the picture of me to those who fall ill and they will be cured.\\" Afterward, it returned to the sea. The story was printed in the ' (woodblock-printed bulletins), where its portrait was printed, and this is how the story disseminated in Japan.  Amabiko group  seen in Higo, painting, property of There is only one unique record of an amabie, whose meaning is uncertain. It has been conjectured that this amabie was simply a miscopying of \\"amabiko\\", a y≈çkai creature that can be considered identical. Like the amabie, the amabiko is a multi-legged prophesizing creature which prescribes the display of its artistic likeness to defend against sickness or death. There are at least 9 accounts of (var. ) extant (counting the amabie). Four describe appearances in Higo Province, one report the in neighboring Hyuga Province (Miyazaki prefecture). Beyond those clustered in the south, two are localized in Echigo Province in the north. Torso-less version: An illustrated manuscript of an 1844 encounter in Echigo depicts a rather cephalopod-like amabiko consisting of a head with three long appendages growing out of it, and hardly any torso. It has \\"short hair growing from its whole body including its face, with human-like ears, round eyes and a slightly protruding mouth\\". The creature doomed the death 70% of the Japanese population that year, which could be averted with its picture-ward. Ape-like version: An ape-like of Higo Province appears in one painting owned by , an authority in the study of this y≈çkai. Its text relates that ape voices heard by night was tracked down by one Shibata Hikozaemon, who discovered this amabiko. Yumoto insists this painting depicts a quadruped. But there were also mass-printed copies of ape-like amabiko, with very similar accompanying text, seen as having just 3 legs, as reported by the 's article dated 10 June 1876. The texts of both identify the sighting of the ape-like creature at , a non- existent county in Higo Province. Amabiko-no-mikoto: The was spotted in a rice paddy in Yuzawa, Niigata, as reported by the dated 8 August 1875. The crude newspaper illustration depicts a daruma doll-like, hairless-looking four- legged creature. This example stands out since it was discovered not in the sea but in a wet ricefield, it professed to serve the heavenly gods (of Shinto) and was conferred the imperial/divine title of \\"-mikoto\\". Arie: A similar creature named appeared in \\"Aotori-k≈çri\\" county, Higo Province, according to the K≈çfu Nichinichi Shimbun newspaper dated 17 June 1876, although this report has been debunked by another paper.  Similar y≈çkai  The in the folklore of Amakusa is believed to haunt the mountains. Although neither of these last two emerge from sea, other similarities such as prophesying indicate they belong to the same kind. There are various other y≈çkai creatures that are vastly different in appearance, but have the ability to predict, such as the kudan, the or \\"shrine princess\\", the or \\"bumper crop year turtle\\", and the \\"turtle woman\\". A tradition in the West ascribes every creature of the sea with the ability to foretell the future, and there is no scarcity of European legends about merfolk bringing prophecy. For this reason, the amabie is considered to be a type of mermaid, in some quarters. But since the amabie is credited with the ability to repel pestilence as well, it should be considered as more of a deity according to some.  COVID-19  The STOP!

Henry, P. Lagier, D. Plaindoux. FSE Grid Middleware: Collaborative Grid Environment for Distributed Computing, FSTJ, vol. 40, no. 2, pp. 269‚Äì281, Dec. 2004. This virtualised IT framework is service-oriented, meaning that applications are run as services, which are a system-independent view of applications. Several applications can be linked in a workflow, and data exchange between the applications participating in the workflow is implicitly managed by the IT framework. SynfiniWay is platform- independent, allowing almost any distributed heterogeneous platform to be linked into its virtualised IT framework. IT framework Schema of framework with two neighborhoods A virtualised IT framework is implemented with SynfiniWay by installing a component with specific software agents on each of the systems in the framework. There are three major types of components in SynfiniWay:White Paper on SynfiniWay * Director, which manages end-user connection, authentication & authorisation, and workflow task scheduling and execution. * Service Manager, which publishes and runs services on behalf of users and which executes data migration. * Acquaintance Manager, which links one remote network, known as a SynfiniWay neighborhood, to another to allow resource discovery and file transfer between components residing in different neighbourhoods. All components are based on Java, so that they can be deployed in a multi-platform environment. An example framework with two neighbourhoods is shown in the figure. Adding or removing components is automatically detected by the framework. The SynfiniWay meta-scheduler automatically adjusts to changes in Service Manager or service availability. Service management SynfiniWay is geared towards service management. This means that an application or a command that will be utilised is defined as a service and published on the SynfiniWay IT framework. Simple or complex tasks can be abstracted into services for execution. By using these abstracted services, a user can easily run applications or commands regardless of how complex they may be or what underlying IT infrastructure is required. They provide a form of virtualisation of computing resources since the user need not be aware of where the service is available or how it is run. Workflow management A technical or business process is created by linking services in a workflow.SynfiniWay au service du calcul, CAD Magazine 129 (Dec 2005 ‚Äì Jan 2006), p. 18. Workflows in SynfiniWay are based on WfMC version 1.0. A workflow defines one or more tasks that will be executed with a given execution logic (branch, loop, conditional). SynfiniWay supports multi- instance tasks which run a service multiple times concurrently. Also it supports a workflow of workflows, whereby a workflow can be executed as a task of a higher level workflow. Data handling Data transfer across several networks Files needed by a service are automatically transferred to the computer executing that service so that the user is freed from having to manage file transfers. A file transfer mechanism is used allowing files to be transferred directly from the source to the target computer system, going through any number of firewalls between source and target, without being stored on any of the intermediary systems. This mechanism uses the shortest path for transferring files to a target computer from the source. Meta- scheduling SynfiniWay employs a meta-scheduling capability,K. Suzuki, N. Uchida, H. Kuraishi, J. Wagner. HPC Solutions for the Manufacturing Industry, FSTJ, vol. 44, no. 4, pp. 458‚Äì466, Oct. 2008. optimizing computational workloads by combining the multiple distributed Resource Managers an organisation is using, into a single aggregated view, allowing batch jobs to be directed to the best location for execution, using local resource managers such as LSF, PBSPro, SGE, LoadLeveler.

He spent his summers in his youth at the family's home in Matunuck, across Narragansett Bay from Newport. He attended Cornell University, graduating in 1931 with a degree in mechanical engineering. He graduated from Cornell University in 1931 with a degree in mechanical engineering, but became an insurance and investment banking executive in New York City, retiring as senior vice president of a securities firm in 1978. Business career After an offer of employment from Alcoa was retracted during the Great Depression, he took employment selling life insurance in Toledo, Ohio before moving to New York City. There he would go from building to building trying to sell insurance, but there was little interest. Carpenter became a pension plan consultant, obtaining Bristol-Myers as a customer and later becoming partner at Reynolds and Company, an investment bank. Antiques Carpenter developed an interest in antiques that began as a way to acquire inexpensive furniture to fill his Scarsdale, New York apartment. He would visit dealers in Manhattan, purchasing items crafted by George Hepplewhite and Thomas Sheraton. His 1954 book, The Arts and Crafts of Newport, Rhode Island, 1640-1820, helped bring attention to American Colonial-era cabinetmakers to public attention. He continued his search for antiques, first keeping them in a warehouse and then constructing a custom- built house in Scarsdale in the 1950s to accommodate the collection. He sold the house and moved to Newport in the 1970s. Historic renovations Hunter House in Newport, Rhode Island. In the 1940s, while antiques-hunting in New England, he revisited the city and was dismayed by the rundown appearance of many of its buildings. After the Hunter House was purchased in 1945 to forestall its destruction, Carpenter was appointed to oversee the restoration of the building by the nascent Preservation Society of Newport County. As part of the restoration effort, Carpenter acquired furniture from Goddard and Townsend, two of the great cabinetmaking families of the area. Morrison Heckscher called the house \\"a brilliant restoration that gets better with age, and that book of his, written with great intelligence, simplicity and clarity, is one I still turn to 50 years later.\\" He was asked to reconstruct the Wayside Inn in Sudbury, Massachusetts following a destructive fire in 1955. He also renovated other Newport structures, including the 1673 White Horse Tavern, the 1726 Trinity Church, the Redwood Library and Athenaeum built from 1748-1750 and the 1762 Brick Market, later home to the Museum of Newport History.

Life He was born in Lille. His father was passionate about art and was himself a painter. Sent to Paris with a pension for some years, Victor was recalled due to the poor state of his father's finances and his studies were cut short. He followed courses at the √âcole de dessin in Lille and worked under the direction of his father and his father's painter friends such as √âdouard Li√©nard, student of Jacques-Louis David. He returned to Paris from 1828 to 1829 to enter the √âcole des Beaux-Arts and at first studied under the direction of Fran√ßois-√âdouard Picot, then as a free student of Dominique Ingres. The Mottez family was highly religious and devoted to the House of Bourbon, and so the July Revolution in 1830 came as a catastrophe to them. Victor was again recalled to Lille by his father and married shortly afterwards. From there he made many trips, of which the longest and most notable was that to Italy and he came to consider its old masters as the absolute masters of painting. In Rome he met Ingres again - Ingres liked him very much and often gave him advice. His Christ in the Tomb (now in the √©glise Sainte-Catherine de Lille) and The Martyrdom of Saint Stephen (now in the √©glise Saint-√âtienne de Lille) date to this era. Also on this trip to Italy he became hugely interested in fresco art‚ÄîMottez painted his wife Julie in this medium and, showing Ingres the end result, pulled it off the wall at Ingres' request (it was later given to the Louvre by Mottez's two children). Returning to France in 1838, he set up shop in Paris and exhibited at the Paris Salons, especially turning more and more towards the neglected genre of frescoes, notably religious ones. He also translated the Treatise by the 14th century Florentine painter Cennino Cennini and learned from his techniques. His most remarkable works are those for churches (at √âglise Saint-Germain-l'Auxerrois in the 1840s, and at the Saint-S√©verin in the 1850s), which were admired by Ingres and Delacroix. However, the clergy's hostility to them, the materials used, the saltpeter walls and their situation all meant that they were already deteriorated by the end of the 19th century and are now largely lost (except for Saint Martin cutting his cloak in two at St-Germain l'Auxerrois), though Mottez's cartoons for them survive. During the same years he frequented the Bertins' salon, alongside the main writers and artists of the time (a sketch of his for a portrait of Victor Hugo survives). He produced two frescoes for this salon, destroyed in 1854. After the 1848 Revolution Mottez set out for the United Kingdom, where he produced several portraits of British nobles and personalities and the exiled minister Fran√ßois Guizot, which were exhibited at the Royal Academy salons. He was an excellent portraitist throughout his career and it was that which mainly occupied him in the last years of his career. He returned to France in 1853 and worked with Delacroix at the √âglise Saint-Sulpice, at the start of the 1860s, where their highly opposed styles clearly showed the struggle between the neo-classical and romantic visions. Maurice Denis considered these frescoes at St-Sulpice (another Saint Martin) as \\"unforgettable\\". He designed the stained glass windows at the √©glise Saint- Maurice de Lille. Marriage and issue He married three times: #Julie Odevaere, a relation of the painter Joseph Denis Odevaere and through her mother related to a Belgian family of artists - she is known via Mottez's portraits in oil and the Italian fresco in Lille #Georgiana Page, whom Mottez married in the United Kingdom, and with whom he had a son (Henri-Paul Mottez, who also worked as a painter but died without issue) #Madeleine Jos√©phine Bonnasier, with whom he had another son, contre-amiral Jean Mottez (1866‚Äì1942), who became director of the fleet's military personnel, commander of the Mediterranean schools and sous-chef d'√âtat-Major g√©n√©ral of the Navy, and who had many descendants Victor Mottez died on 7 June 1897 in Bi√®vres.

History The library in 2010 Interior of the library ca. 1925 Construction of the Mount Pleasant Branch was funded primarily by the Carnegie Corporation and was built to serve the rapidly growing communities of Mount Pleasant and Columbia Heights. The architect, Edward Lippincott Tilton of New York City, was an accomplished library designer who planned numerous libraries nationwide. The library site at Lamont and 16th Streets was made available for purchase by Mary Foote Henderson who was instrumental in the development of 16th Street in the early 20th century. The Italian Renaissance design of the building harmonizes with the monumental architecture of the churches and embassies that line 16th Street. The Mount Pleasant Neighborhood Library stands in the Mount Pleasant National Register Historic District designated in 1987. The Mount Pleasant Library was the third and last DC Neighborhood Library to be built with Carnegie funding. Andrew Carnegie had funded the construction of the Central Library and, at its dedication in 1903, he offered to finance branch buildings as they were needed. Congress was slow to authorize the acceptance of his offer. In 1910, it authorized acceptance of funds for the first Carnegie Neighborhood Library which opened in Takoma Park in 1911. By the time the Board of Library Trustees next sought funds for a Neighborhood Library, Carnegie had died without providing in his will for the construction of additional libraries. The Carnegie Corporation honored the promise by granting the Trustees‚Äô requests for the funding of two more branches, the Southeast Branch in 1921 and Mount Pleasant in 1923. One of the most distinguishing features of the building today is the murals painted during the 1930s by Aurelius Battaglia under a Works Progress Administration program. The murals depict a fantastical world where the animals take over the circus. With the lion as the ringmaster and the hippos as ballerinas, the murals may have served as studies for Walt Disney's Fantasia for which Battaglia worked as an illustrator years later. In October 2012, the District of Columbia completed an $11.5 million renovation and expansion of the historic building. The project included expanding into a new building at the rear of the property and a glass atrium linking to two spaces. There is a new 100-person meeting room as well as dedicated space for teens. The lower level houses adult non-fiction while the main level contains adult fiction and a large collection of Spanish-language materials. The upper level is dedicated to children and includes a performance space and a dedicated space for very young children. The project removed a three-level stack of cast-iron shelving and a sunroom and aimed to reach a minimum of LEED Silver for its sustainability and energy efficiency.

The topography of the seabed determines the shape of the wave and type of break. Since shoals can change size and location, affecting the break, it takes commitment and skill to find good breaks. Some surf breaks are quite dangerous, since the surfer can collide with a reef or rocks below the water. Surf breaks may be defended vehemently by surfers, as human activities and constructions can have unintended and unpredictable consequences which can be either positive, negative, or unknown. Types There are numerous types of surf breaks. These are defined as permanent or semi permanent obstructions that causes a wave to break, rather than by the nature of the wave itself (see under 'Types of surfable waves' below). Artificial wave pools are an example of technology changing what is considered a 'surf break' or 'surfable wave'. Some 'surf break' locations may be partly or wholly formed and influenced by human activities (see under 'Human influence on surf breaks' below). These effects are variable and may be either negative or positive with respect to the effect on local surf quality. Point break Currumbin Alley A point break refers to the place where waves hit a point of land or rocks jutting out from the coastline. Bells Beach in Australia and Jardim do Mar in Madeira, Portugal are examples of point breaks. They can break either left or right, and in rare cases forms a central peak which breaks both ways around a central headland. (E.g. beach in the Punta Negra District of Peru). The bottom can be made of rocks, sand, or coral. Beach break A beach break takes place where waves break on a usually sandy seabed. An example of a classic beach break is Hossegor in Southern France, which is famous for waves of up to . Sometimes 'beaches' can contain little or no sand, and the 'beach' bottom may be only rock or boulders and pebbles. A 'boulder beach' is an example. Reef break Cloudbreak A reef break happens when a wave breaks over a coral reef or a rocky seabed. Examples are Cloudbreak in Fiji and Jaws in Maui. A reef break may occur close to the shore, or well offshore from the shoreline, breaking in open ocean and petering out before the wave reaches the shore. Examples include Queenscliff Bommie in Australia and Dungeons in South Africa. In Australia these open ocean reefs are sometimes called Bombora or 'Bommie' waves, after the aboriginal word for offshore reef, 'bombora'. Sometimes reefs which occur in open ocean but which do not breach the surface are also called 'Banks'. The Cortes Bank off California is an example. There are also examples of man-made reefs specifically designed and made for surfing. Some artificial harbours also create new reef break waves. Examples include Newcastle Harbour in Australia. Shipwreck break thumb A \\"Shipwreck break\\" usually forms from sand built up over submerged or partly submerged shipwrecks. They may be either temporary or more or less permanent, depending on whether the wreck remains in place for a significant period. Examples occur at the SS Monte Carlo at the Silver Strand, The Wreck, Byron Bay, NSW, and at Stockton Beach, Newcastle, NSW. Shore break A shore break is a wave that breaks directly on, or very close to the shore. This happens when the beach is very steep at the shoreline. These waves are really just a form of beach or reef break, but breaking very close to the shore. Rivermouth break A rivermouth break breaks at or near the entrance to a river or creek. It can break as either a left-breaking or right-breaking wave, or a peak which breaks both ways. The bottom is usually sand, but can be pebbles, rocks, or even coral reef. Examples include Mundaka in Spain, and Merimbula bar in Australia. They are sometimes called 'Bar' breaks because of the way the sand piles up along the shoreline. Jetty break The Wedge These waves break along or near a jetty. They are also called 'groynes' in some places. Examples include Long Beach in New York, The Wedge in California, and Duranbah Groyne in Australia. Jetty and groyne style waves are known for often exhibiting constructive interference between different incoming waves to produce a significantly larger, 'wedging' style of wave, due to the unusual extension of obstruction that juts out significantly from the shore, and which wave shape is often favored by surfers. This is an example of a human influence which actually may improve a wave's shape and quality for surfing, however in other cases the effect for surfing may be negative. Natural 'wedge' style constructive interference can however occur on any type of surf break, provided the local wave dynamics are favorable. Outer banks A type of open ocean surf break, these occur where sand build ups occur well offshore to produce breaking waves in the open ocean, which are sometimes called 'Outer Banks', which are similar to open ocean reefs except that they are generally made of sand, and may disappear or change with storms. The 'Outer Banks' in North Carolina is an example. They can also be made of more permanent rocky reefs. Tidal bore breaks Severn Bore Numerous tidal bore waves are known, some of which have also been surfed for several kilometres or more and many kilometres from the ocean, making them the longest rideable waves in the world. They are formed where stronger and larger tides enter a river or deltaic system, allowing the tide to forcefully push and extend up the river, sometimes forming rideable waves. The waves can be singular or multiple crested. They form at specific times of the day, month, and year due to tidal currents, and can be accurately predicted. Well known examples include several in the Amazon Basin, in Brazil, at the Severn Bore in the United Kingdom, and in Sumatra, Indonesia. Standing river breaks These are waves which are created in some fast flowing rivers or creeks, allowing a surfer to ride a wave for several minutes or more whilst standing or lying more or less stationary within the river. The force of the flow along an uneven river bed allows a standing wave to form, and the surfer to be able to ride the wave successfully. They are relatively rare as local wave dynamics tend to be very specific. Examples include on the Zambesi River in Africa, and on the Eisbach river in Munich, Germany. They also sometimes form when an inland lagoon or lake breaches its entry to the sea, forming standing waves in the channel between the lagoon and sea. Examples include at Waimea in Hawaii. Artificial wave pools These are waves generated in an artificially created pool with a powerful wave-generating device, to form waves which can be surfed without any need for an existing, natural water environment, such as an ocean or shoreline. Wave pools can therefore be built almost anywhere, and several designs and models (which have also been patented) are under construction throughout the world as of 2016. In December 2015, former world surfing champion and current professional surfer Kelly Slater revealed a new type of wave pool at an unknown location, which was able to demonstrably show well-shaped barrelling style waves over several hundred metres at around head- high or more, which quality and size had not previously been achieved by any wave pool design or construction. The ability to create genuine, long, barreling surfable waves at locations far from natural shorelines might prove to be a game-changer within surfing culture and history. Wave pools are currently the subject of much research and development, and there are a number of planned and existing commercial operations. Types of surfable waves As opposed to permanent or semi permanent obstructions which cause waves to break, surfable waves are sometimes defined by the nature of their generation. Swell waves Ocean swells form from the longer term amalgamation of wind- generated waves on the surface. The stronger the wind and the longer the area over which it blows, generally the larger the swell. Wind waves If large enough, local wind-generated chop can be surfed, but usually only after it has amalgamated into genuine swell from a distance. Ship waves A large ship such as an oil tanker can sometimes create rideable waves at the shoreline. These are usually surfed only when the waves are otherwise very small, such as in a large inland lake. There has been unconfirmed reports of an offshore boat being used to make waves during surf contests when the surf was otherwise very small. Tsunami waves Although rare, surfable tsunami waves from earthquakes have been recorded. One documented place an earthquake-generated tsunami has been surfed is at Punta Hermosa in Peru, at the offshore Kon Tiki reef, where tsunami-generated waves from the 1974 Lima earthquake were ridden about from the shore, before further rising and crashing into the nearby shoreline. The surfers did not know these were tsunami waves until after the event. Surfable seismic-style waves generated from landslides, volcanic eruptions or meteorite impacts into the ocean are all possible, but all of these are very rare, unpredictable, and have not been documented as being surfed. Glacial calving waves Waves have been surfed and documented from the action of calving ice from glaciers, which falls into the adjacent water and forms a tsunami-type wave which surges away from the glacier. Storm surges These form when a large storm or hurricane forces water in front of it, due to the combined action of strong winds over long distances. The water can pile up towards the shore and create a moving surge of water. These surges can be surfed, although they have not been specifically documented. Backwash and sidewash waves These occur where waves are formed from the returning backwash of a wave which has previously gone up a steep shoreline or beach, or sometimes reflected from an ocean rockface or wall. They can sometimes form a surfable wave in a direction oblique to, or opposite from the original wave direction. An example was shown in the film Endless Summer, in Tahiti, called 'Ins and Outs'. Backwash breaking parallel to or obliquely to the angle of the shore is sometimes also called sidewash, which can form from the reflection of a wave breaking against adjacent obstructions such as jetties, groynes, or rockwalls, or simply from the action of backwashing waves which strike a shoreline at an angle. Sidewash and backwash is relatively common, and may amplify another incoming breaking wave's size due to constructive interference. When this process happens with an open ocean swell the resulting wave can also be significantly larger due to constructive interference from either deep water refraction or diffraction, or both. This type of effect is suggested to occur at two of the largest surf breaks in the world, at Nazar√© in Portugal, and Jaws in Hawaii. Backwash and sidewash also sometimes form in conjunction with rips on beaches. Standing river waves These are formed from the action of fast flowing water over an uneven river or creek bed. The dynamics are very specific and not many naturally occurring surfable standing river waves are known, but examples include on the Zambesi river and near Munich, Germany. Some rivers can also exhibit a surfable wave 'front' during flash flood events, particularly within narrow canyons. These have been ridden by people on surf craft caught in a flash flood event, such as on an inflatable tyre, although not usually intentionally. It is technically a wave front, with a breaking wave which can carry one downstream, so may be classified as a 'surf break', but others may classify this as simply a type of river riding. Tidal bore waves These form where strong tidal currents enter a river or deltaic system, pushing shorewards and creating a surfable wave, and can extend for many kilometers. Surfable examples are known in China, Sumatra, the Amazon Basin, and the United Kingdom. They can be multiple or single crested wave fronts. Artificial wave pool waves These are made in an artificially created pool with a powerful wave generating device, to form generally small waves, which can be surfed without any need for an ocean or shoreline. They are currently the subject of much research and development, and there are a number of commercial operations. Human influence 'Surf break' locations and the quality of surf may be negatively or positively affected by human activities. In some cases, surf breaks themselves may be partly formed from the influence of human activities. These include from the construction of local jetties (e.g. at Ocean Beach, New York), or from the dredging and dumping of nearby river sand (at Coolangatta's 'Superbank', Queensland, which sand sourced from the nearby Tweed River which commenced in the late 1990s and has now formed an almost continuous 2 km long sand bottomed point break), or from sand build up around local shipwrecks (such as at Stockton Beach, New South Wales). These effects may be either temporary, or more or less permanent. The effects of human influences are variable, and may be either negative or positive with respect to the effect on local surf quality, and in some cases may affect one nearby surf break positively and another negatively. Generally speaking, local surfers are opposed to potential unintentional consequences of local constructions or development which may not have adequately assessed or considered the effect on local surf quality, particularly where the local surf quality is considered substantial or culturally or socio-economically significant. Such effects may not have been taken into account during various development proposals. There are examples of world-renowned surf breaks which have been significantly and negatively effected or destroyed by various engineering or other human influences, although it is important to note that some renowned surf breaks have also been markedly improved by various human influences. Construction of jetties and rock groynes These constructions create local sand build up which may improve the local surf quality. Examples occur at Ocean Beach New York, and Duranbah Groyne New South Wales. They are also called 'groynes' in some places. Negative effects on surf quality from such constructions are also known. Construction of artificial harbours These may create changes to local surf dynamics which can be either negative or positive with respect to surf quality. Most were made in previous decades and centuries and the effects on surf quality at the time were not known. Examples include at Newcastle Harbour, in New South Wales. Shipwrecks These unintentional 'constructions' may allow sand to build up around the wreck, sometimes forming surfable waves. Sand dredging and dumping Sand dredging and dumping from nearby rivers can affect the quality of nearby surf breaks, due to changes in the amount of sand available to form over the bottom. In many sand bottom point breaks, more sand often means better quality. The 'Superbank' in Queensland is a world class surf break, partly formed from the influence of nearby sand dredging and dumping. This sand is sourced form the nearby Tweed River, which dredging program began in the late 1990s. This program has generally improved the surf quality, forming a now more or less continuous 2 km long sand bottomed surf break, linking up what was previously 3 different point breaks (Snapper, Greenmount, and Kirra) into now one more or continuous surf break, and now also one of the longest point breaks in the world. Whilst the surf quality at Snapper and Greenmount has generally improved, the bottom section of the break, the world-class Kirra point break, which was formerly considered one of the best in the world, has generally suffered. Proposals have been put forward to attempt to alleviate or change the program, to attempt to restore the quality of previous surf at Kirra, however it is not clear how the improvements made to nearby Snapper and Greenmount would also be then affected. There may be an optimum amount of sand dredging and build up which allows all three breaks to be generally improved, as was perhaps the case in the early 2000s. Artificial reef breaks 'Artificial reef breaks' are an example of a construction which intentionally alters the local seabed dynamics to attempt to improve the local surf quality. The success of these has proved to be variable to date, with both positive and neutral cases known. Reactions to local artificial reef construction proposals is mixed and variable, and is usually examined on a case-by-case basis. Artificial wave pools Artificial wave pools use a powerful wave generating device which creates surfable waves without the need for a coastline or shoreline. They can therefore allow surf activity to occur many kilometers inland from the sea or ocean. They are the subject of current research and development, and a number of commercial operations are in existence. Artificial standing waves These form where lagoons disconnected to the ocean are deliberately breached, which allows a narrow fast flowing channel to form which lowers the water level and re-connect the inland water system with the ocean. Sometimes surfable 'standing waves' are formed and surfed during these events, which can become a cultural attraction. Reef bombing This is largely an illegal fishing activity which occurs in some countries whereby explosives are used over coral reefs to kill and stun the fish, allowing them to be then netted and caught more easily. The practice is largely illegal, as it negatively effects both marine life and also changes and destroys the local seabed and coral topography, creating largely negative effects on local surf conditions. Development and stabilization of sand dunes The mobility of sand dunes sometimes allows a greater supply of sand to be deposited in adjacent local point breaks, creating more even surf conditions on these point break style waves. When these dunes are destroyed or stabilised, the supply of sand may be reduced, effecting local surf conditions. This has occurred at the Bruce's Beauties surf break in South Africa, where wave quality was no longer the same once the adjacent dunes were developed with residential style housing. Areas adjacent to river systems where the supply of sand is reduced can also be similarly affected. In the world renowned surf movie: The Endless Summer director Bruce Brown comments on the \\"perfect breaking wave\\" - Cape St. Francis in South Africa. In The Endless Summer II, the cape has a different break to it due to the housing development requiring a sand mound to protect the houses from wind/sand erosion. The sand removed from the beaches drastically altered the wave and how it breaks. Cape St. Francis is just one of the surf points altered from humans. Reformation of beaches, coastlines, and beach-front property alter the sand underneath the waves and degrades surfing conditions. By blocking the natural wind flow to the ocean lessens the offshore wind, low tide surf conditions all surfers envy.  Effect of climate change  Surfing conditions change due to the global change in climate. The combustion of fossil fuels translates to rising sea levels through the melting of Earth's ice caps and thermal expansion. The rising sea levels increase the amount of condensation through the hydrologic cycle. With more precipitation in the atmosphere and increased global temperatures storms carry increased power. Swells and ocean currents in turn fuel surfable waves, though their quality is yet to be known. As Earth evolves with increased carbon emissions into the atmosphere, surf breaks see alterations in size, speed, location, and quality of waves. Climate change affects surf breaks through altering the environment surrounding the surf break. There are also ways as a surfer to combat the future degradation of your local surf location. Sea Level Rise Over Time  Rising sea levels  With an increase in sea level, the way certain waves break will alter. Waves break due to the distance between the surface water and the sea floor. The average wave across the Earth will get smaller due to there being more water from melting ice caps. Combustion of fossil fuels as well as surface heating have increased the global temperature by 2 degrees Fahrenheit. If a reef break depends on the tides, then the increase of water to the reef alters the tides. If a reef break breaks well on a high tide, after rising sea levels the reef break will break well on the low tide. More critically, a surf spot that currently breaks only on a low tide will cease to break. Beach breaks are highly susceptible to sea level rise due to their reliance on the sea floor below. With the increased sea level, more sediment deposition occurs which can have various effects on surface waves. Rising sea levels may have various effects on waves, though one thing is certain: rising sea levels will inevitably lower the size of waves. = Ocean Currents = Ocean Surface Currents Across the world, Earth's currents push cold and warm water. See Ocean current. With increased water from melting ice caps, currents have a larger body of water to push. Currents are slowing down globally, in some cases up by 15%. These currents can allow certain areas of the world to get cold when it's supposed to be warm, and vice versa. Reduced current power limits the power swells have on daily surf breaks.  Storms  Storms are increasing in quantity and potency. We are seeing higher category 4 and 5 storms; translating to intense swells. Storms drive powerful swells; so for an increase in storm power the waves will actually in turn become increased in size. Though storms are supposed to create larger swells and better surf, waves are actually decreasing in size globally. Rising sea levels decrease the potency of storms; hurricanes and winds have a smaller impact on surf breaks only when the tides are higher. = Swells = Globally, with an increase in storm frequency and power, swells will become stronger and happen more often. The quality of surf is not yet known to the future swells due to variables such as sea level, ocean currents, and location on the earth. Additionally, the force driving the swells may vary due to the condition of global ocean currents.  Coral reef degradation  Since Earth's oceans are affected by global warming, thermal stress affects the coral reefs, slowly withering away until the coral bleaches. Coral bleaching eventually kills the coral. Sea level rise expands the ocean's area, acquiring more sediment as it grows. With more sediment under the sea, coral begins to become buried alive. As sedimentation occurs, reef breaks turn into beach breaks; which can have positive or negative impacts; depending on the circumstances of the break (wind, depth, location). Anthropogenic waste running off into the sewage lines that feed to the ocean, sprouting harmful algae blooms and murky water that limit the amount of sunlight coral reefs can absorb. Coral reefs provide some of the world's best waves; though they may not be around for long. Coral reefs have a narrow window of temperature in which they can live. With an average increase in global temperatures of one degree per decade, and 90% of the heat being absorbed by the ocean. Coral reefs are in danger of becoming extinct by 2030. Coral reef loss creates beach breaks; which alter the nature of the wave. = Ocean acidification = With an increase of carbon emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels, the ocean acts as a sink for all of the extra CO2 in the atmosphere. CO2 naturally increases the acidity of the ocean, throwing the pH of the ocean to a more acidic state. Currently the acidity of the ocean has increased by 30%. The increase has led to coral reefs degrading, therefore impacting all of the reef breaks. Carbon dioxide absorbed into the ocean from the atmosphere reduces calcification rates in reef-building and reef-associated organisms by altering seawater chemistry through decreases in pH. Actions In 2008, surfers and environmentalists opposed a toll road project in Orange County, California that would have changed sediment patterns and affected the world-class Trestles surf break north of San Onofre State Beach which attracted 400,000 surfers in 2007. In 2007, the NSW Geographical Names Register began formally recognizing names of surf breaks in Australia, defining a surf break as a \\"permanent obstruction such as a reef, headland, bombora, rock or sandbar, which causes waves to break\\". One of the largest surf breaks in the world is the Jaws surf break in Maui, Hawaii, with waves that reach a maximum height of . However waves which break off Nazar√© in Portugal have been recorded to exceed , with estimates of waves ridden up to over , from trough to peak. The peculiar ocean bathymetry off Nazare is largely responsible for the very large wave faces.

In spite of its adoption by the ILA, there is no mechanism in place that enforces the rules. Notwithstanding the guideline's lack of formal status, its work on rules governing international rivers was pioneering. It led to the creation of the United Nations' Convention on the Law of Non-Navigational Uses of International Watercourses. In 2004, it was superseded by the Berlin Rules on Water Resources. Provisions Applicable to all drainage basins that cross national boundaries, except where other agreement between bordering nations exists, the Helsinki Rules assert the rights of all bordering nations to an equitable share in the water resources, with reasonable consideration of such factors as past customary usages of the resource and balancing variant needs and demands of the bordering nations. It also mandates protection of the resource by bordering nations with respect to water pollution in Chapter 3 (Articles IX to XI) and sets forth recommendations for resolving disputes over usage of such watercourses. The Helsinki rules consist of 37 articles spread over 6 chapters. Chapter 2, Article 4 states: \\"Each basin State is entitled, within its territory, to a reasonable and equitable share in the beneficial uses of the waters of an international drainage basin\\". In determining what is reasonable and equitable share, all relevant factors are to be considered together and a conclusion reached on the basis of the whole. The list provided in Article 5 (2) is produced in full below: 1\\\\. The geography of the basin, including in particular the extent of the drainage area in the territory of each basin State 2\\\\. The hydrology of the basin, including in particular the contribution of water by each basin State 3\\\\. The climate affecting the basin 4\\\\. The past utilization of the waters of the basin, including in particular existing utilization 5\\\\. The economic and social needs of each basin State 6\\\\. The population dependent on the waters of the basin in each basin State 7\\\\. The comparative costs of alternative means of satisfying the economic and social needs of each basin State 8\\\\. The availability of other resources 9\\\\. The avoidance of unnecessary waste in the utilization of waters of the basin 10\\\\. The practicability of compensation to one or more of the co-basin States as a means of adjusting conflicts among uses 11\\\\. The degree to which the needs of a basin State may be satisfied, without causing substantial injury to a co-basin State Article 6 precludes inherent preference of any use over others. Article 7 prohibits denial of reasonable use to a basin state on the basis of future uses of other states. Article 8 relates to \\"existing reasonable uses\\". Section 8 (1) states: \\"An existing reasonable use may continue in operation unless the factors justifying its continuance are outweighed by other factors leading to the conclusion that it be modified or terminated so as to accommodate a competing incompatible use\\". Section 8 (2) defines the entry & exit criterion of an existing use. Section 8 (3) prohibits a use that is incompatible with an already existing reasonable use at the time of becoming operational from being treated as an existing use. Limitations Although \\"an important set of draft rules,\\" according to Stephen McCaffrey of the McGeorge School of Law, the Helsinki Rules do not address independent aquifers, but only those connected to a river. Accordingly, the United Nations decided in 1970 to create a more inclusive set of guidelines, which after more than twenty years of investigation by the International Law Commission resulted in the adopting of the Convention on the Law of Non-Navigational Uses of International Watercourses in 1997. The ILA itself addressed this limitation in adopting the Rules on International Groundwaters, also known as the Seoul Rules, in Seoul, Korea in 1986 and the Berlin Rules on Water Resources in 2004, which superseded this guideline.

Cullen (1936‚Äì1990) was the director of the AMC Cancer Research Center, and Deputy Director of the National Cancer Institute.Biographical Info History Joseph Cullen grew up in the Boston, MA, area and attended the Boston Latin School. He received his Doctorate in Clinical Psychology from Florida State University in 1968. He served on the faculty at the University of California at Los Angeles, and also worked at the Pavlovian Research Laboratory. Throughout his life, he was an active volunteer with the American Cancer Society. He was the first Director of the Division of Cancer Control at the Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center at the University of California at Los Angeles.http://cebp.aacrjournals.org/content/1/6/427.full.pdf In this position, he became a leader nationally and internationally in focusing attention among the cancer prevention and control community on the importance of what would make the most significant differences in preventing cancer. Through his work with the International Union Against Cancer (UICC),http://www.uicc.org/index.php?option=com_search&searchword;=ress he developed a strong international network of colleagues who were confronting the tobacco problem worldwide, including Nigel Gray (Australia), head of the UICC Tobacco Program from 1974‚Äì1990,https://www.who.int/tobacco/global_interaction/tobreg/members/gray/en/index.html and Richard Doll (UK), Richard Peto (UK), Sir John Crofton (UK), Keith Ball (UK), Takeshi Hirayama (Japan), Dimitrios Trichopoulos (Greece), Judith Mackay of the Hong Kong Anti-Cancer Society, Kjell Bjartveit (Norway), D. David Simpson of UK's Action on Smoking and Health, Allan C. Erickson of the American Cancer Society and Michael Pertschuk (USA). From 1982 - 1989 Cullen served as Deputy Director of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Division of Cancer Prevention and Control. Together with Dr. Peter Greenwald, the Director for the NCI Division of Cancer Prevention and Control, he established a new scientific approach to cancer control based upon a five-phase decision-making model: (1) hypothesis development, (2) method development, (3) controlled intervention trials, (4) defined population studies, and (5) demonstration and implementation studies.Greenwald P and Cullen JW. The Scientific Approach to Cancer Control. CA. A Cancer Journal for Clinicians. 1984;34:328-332. A major component of how this model was put into action at NCI was the new Smoking Tobacco and Cancer Program (STCP) which Cullen created in 1982. During his tenure at NCI, he was a vocal advocate for increasing program funding to develop and test intervention strategies to reduce tobacco use and then to apply the best strategies in large target populations. By 1989, the STCP included 55 smoking prevention and cessation trials, affecting 25 states and active in over 200 North American cities.Cullen JW. The National Cancer Institute's Smoking Tobacco, and Cancer Program. Chest 1989;96:9S-13S. One of the major achievements of the STCP was the establishment of the American Stop Smoking Intervention Study for Cancer Prevention, widely known as ASSIST, which represented a major shift in federal funding for tobacco control from a primary focus on individuals to include a focus on the community and social environment. Based upon the leadership of Cullen within NCI and Dr. Harmon J. Eyre, representing the American Cancer Society (ACS), and their presentations before the NCI's Board of Scientific Counselors, ASSIST was approved for funding in 1989 and launched in 1991 through a collaborative public/private partnership between NCI and the ACS. ASSIST funded 17 state health departments to conduct the first comprehensive tobacco prevention and control programs on a statewide basis. This seven-year demonstration project served as a model for national tobacco control efforts and led to the current National Tobacco Control Program administered by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Office on Smoking and Health, which continues to fund state health departments in all 50 states and the District of Columbia.https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/sgr/2000/complete_report/pdfs/chapter7.pdf During the 1980s, Cullen developed a close working relationship with the Surgeon General C. Everett Koop. Cullen became a key technical consultant to Dr. Koop as he developed into an international leader in tobacco control.

It has been classed as a monument historique since 1987 and is dedicated to Saint Stephen. Eglise Saint-Etienne It is one of the largest Jesuit churches in France. History First building The first parish church of this name was on the north corner of the city's Grand'Place (as shown by the names of the streets in that area - rue Saint-√âtienne, rue des d√©bris Saint-√âtienne, rue du cur√© Saint-√âtienne) and mainly dated to the 14th and 15th centuries. It was richly endowed by the Hangouart family, whose main members served the dukes of Burgundy. It was a Dutch-style hall church with two aisles and a nave, with many chapels along both sides of the nave. It was destroyed by fire in 1793 during the Austrian siege of the city, and replaced in 1796 by the present church. Current building The present parish church originated as a Jesuit chapel. The Jesuits set up a base in Lille in 1562 and they were put in charge of the municipal coll√®ge built in 1529 on the decision of the city magistrate. The Jesuits' chapel of the immaculate conception (now the parish church of Saint-√âtienne) was built from 1605 to 1610, but then destroyed by fire on 8 October 1740. From 1743 onwards Fran√ßois-Joseph Gombert rebuilt it to plans by Dominique Delesalle and, though works were delayed in 1744 by the War of the Austrian Succession and in 1745 by the siege of Tournai, they were finally completed in 1748 and the new building consecrated by the bishop of Tournai in 1750. The Jesuits were expelled from France in 1765, on which the chapel became the chapel of the coll√®ge and of the military hospital which took over the coll√®ge from 1778. Description left The church's stone fa√ßade is 29m high and its height is accentuated by the very straight rue de l'H√¥pital militaire. Its style is resolutely classical and inspired by the Roman Baroque, with two superimposed orders (Ionic order at the bottom, Corinthian order at the top). A 57m high square bell tower topped with a campanile is to the left of the choir. The church's interior is 61m long, sobre, light and on a Latin cross plan. The nave has 7 bays, with side chapels all along the aisles, and the choir extends the nave and ends in a semi- circular apse. The choir and aisles are covered by an ogive vault and the nave by a barrel vault. The black and white marble flooring comes from the former chapel and the stained glass windows by Charles Gaudelet between 1854 and 1862. The pulpit was carved by the sculptor Fran√ßois Rude between 1825 and 1828. It is made up of a tent topped by an angel and cherubs, with Faith and Hope supporting a vessel adorned with a bas-relief of St Stephen's martyrdom. The 1840 organ was built by the Daublaine Callinet house. It has been modified four times (by Cavaill√©-Coll in 1899 then by Mutin in 1901) and now has 39 jeux, 3 keyboards and pedals.

It is known from a juvenile specimen, holotype CYGB-0035, an almost complete articulated skeleton of a hatchling also showing soft parts, such as the flight membrane and pycnofibres, compressed on a plate and counterplate. It was in 2009 the smallest toothed pterosaur specimen even found in China. The type species Ningchengopterus liuae was in 2009 named and described by L√º Junchang. The genus name combines a reference to the Ningcheng district in Inner Mongolia with a Latinised Greek pteron, \\"wing\\". The specific name honours Ms Liu Jingyi who collected the fossil and donated it to science. Ningchengopterus was typified by the possession of about fifty teeth, twelve in each upper jaw and thirteen in each lower jaw. The teeth are curved, conical and pointed. The skull has a length of thirty-eight millimetres. The snout is elongated and tapering. The lower jaws show an incipient crest. The specimen could not be more precisely determined than Pterodactyloidea. It shared the relative proportions of the first and second phalanx of the flight finger with the Ctenochasmatidae, and especially Eosipterus found in the same formation, but showed no further synapomorphies of that group, so that L√º abstained from placing it in that clade. The teeth suggested that Ningchengopterus was a fish eater. The fully formed flight membrane was seen as confirmation of a hypothesis by Mark Unwin that pterosaurs displayed little parental care, their \\"babies\\" being able to fly shortly after hatching.

As the name suggests, the station was located at the junction of two railway lines. The first was a branch line off the main line between Belfast and Dublin, which connected Drogheda and Oldcastle, and opened in 1850. The second, which opened in 1862, was also a branch line, this time off the line from Dublin to Sligo, connecting Clonsilla and Navan. This line was later extended as far as Kingscourt in 1865. Although Navan had two railway stations, Navan Junction was the main one serving the town, with a total of four platforms serving the two routes. However, following the nationalisation of the railways in Ireland in 1945, a major rationalisation programme led to the closure of many branch lines. Passenger services on the Kingscourt line ended in 1947, and led to the line between Clonsilla and Navan being lifted, while services on the Oldcastle line ended in 1958, with the line between Navan and Oldcastle lifted in 1963. This saw the final closure of Navan Junction station itself. Today, little remains of the station. Most of the buildings have been demolished, with the exception of the Midland Great Western Railway goods shed and the Great Northern Railway (Ireland) down platform.Navan Junstion - eiretrains.com However, freight trains still pass through the site - until 2001, trains transported gypsum from the Gypsum Industries plant at Kingscourt through the site, while trains from the Tara Mine continue to use the remaining part of the Oldcastle line to transport zinc and lead to Drogheda.

The practice of capturing and displaying these whales in exhibitions began in the 1960s, soon becoming popular attractions at public aquariums and aquatic theme parks due to their intelligence, trainability, striking appearance, playfulness, and sheer size. As of August, 2019, there were 60 orcas in captivity worldwide, 33 of which are captive-born.Fate of orcas in captivity As of January 2019 there were 19 live orcas in the Seaworld parks.SeaWorld Orlando orca whale Kayla dies after illness The practice of keeping killer whales in captivity is controversial, due to the separation of their familial \\"pod\\" during capture, and their living conditions and health in captivity. There have been 4 human deaths involving orcas as of 2018, 3 of which involved a whale called Tilikum. Of the reported killer whale attacks in the wild, none have been fatal. Orcas Transient orcas near Unimak Island, eastern Aleutian Islands, Alaska Killer whales are large, active and intelligent. Males range from and weigh over , while females range from and weigh . The killer whale (Orcinus orca) is the largest species of the Dolphin family. The species is found in all the world's oceans, from the frigid Arctic and Antarctic regions to warm, tropical seas. Killer whales are intelligent, versatile and opportunistic predators. Some populations feed mostly on fish, and other populations hunt marine mammals, including sea lions, seals, walruses, dolphins, large whales and some species of shark. They are considered an apex predator, as no animal predates on them. There are up to five distinct killer whale types, some of which may be separate races, subspecies or even species. Killer whales are highly social; some populations are composed of matrilineal family groups, which are the most stable of any animal species. The sophisticated social behavior, hunting techniques, and vocal behavior of killer whales have been described as manifestations of animal culture. Although killer whales are not an endangered species, some local populations are threatened or endangered due to bioaccumulation of PCBs pollution, depletion of prey species, captures for marine mammal parks, conflicts with fishing activities, acoustic pollution, shipping vessels, stress from whale-watching boats, and habitat loss. Capture and breeding It is extremely difficult to capture killer whales and to provide a healthy environment for the captives. Early attempts in the 1960s caused many injuries and deaths. However, with experience the teams who specialized in the business became more adept and post-capture survival rates improved. Live captures peaked in the early 1970s, but have become increasingly rare as the marine parks have learned how to maintain theme park populations through captive breeding and artificial insemination. North Eastern Pacific captures The right The first capture in the North Eastern Pacific occurred in November 1961. A collecting crew from Marineland of the Pacific in Los Angeles, took the orca to a tank at the aquarium, where she repeatedly crashed into the walls. She was named Wanda and died the following day.

During the 1960s and early 1970s, nearly 50 killer whales were taken from Pacific waters for exhibition. The Southern Resident community of killer whales in the Northeast Pacific lost 48 of its members to captivity. By 1976, only 80 killer whales were left in the community, which remains endangered. With subsequent captures, the theme parks learned more about avoiding injury during capture and subsequent care of killer whales, and discovered that they could be trained to perform tricks, making them a great attraction to visitors. As commercial demand increased, growing numbers of Pacific orcas were captured, peaking in 1970.Heimlich, Sara and Boran, James. Killer Whales (2001) Voyageur Press, Stillwater, Minnesota. Lolita, the second oldest captive orca who was six years old at the time of capture. A turning point came with a mass capture of orcas from the L-25 pod in August 1970 at Penn Cove, Puget Sound off the coast of Washington. The Penn Cove capture became controversial due to the large number of wild killer whales that were taken (seven) and the number of deaths that resulted: four juveniles died, as well as one adult female who drowned when she became tangled in a net while attempting to reach her calf. In his interview for the CNN documentary Blackfish, former diver John Crowe told how all five of the whales had their abdomen slit open and filled with rocks, their tails weighted down with anchors and chains, in an attempt to conceal the deaths. The facts surrounding their deaths were discovered three months later after three of the dead whales washed ashore on Whidbey Island. Public concern about the welfare of the animals and the effect of captures on the wild pods led to the Marine Mammal Protection Act being passed in 1972 by the US Congress, protecting orcas from being harassed or killed, and requiring special permits for capture. Since then, few wild orcas have been captured in Northeastern Pacific waters.\\"The Capture of Orcas\\" In Kokomo. Retrieved February 14, 2009. \\"Since first orca capture, views have changed\\".

When the US Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 effectively stopped the capture of Pacific orcas, exhibitors found an area more tolerant of killer whale captures in Iceland. Icelandic herring fishermen had traditionally seen killer whales as competitors for their catch, and sale of live killer whales promised a large new source of income. 48 live killer whales captured in Icelandic waters were exported to marine parks between 1976 and 1988. The capture process was based on luring the orcas by dumping leftovers from herring fishing in front of the pod, capturing the killer whales in a purse seine net, selecting desirable animals and hauling them on board in a specially designed frame, then placing them in foam-lined boxes full of seawater.The Icelandic live- capture fishery for killer whales 1976‚Äì1988 Orca Home.

To maintain their alertness, the killer whales are fed at sporadic intervals throughout the day (as would happen in the wild) and feeding is often combined with training and shows.

Issues with captivity The practice of keeping killer whales in captivity is controversial, and organizations such as World Animal Protection and the Whale and Dolphin Conservation campaign against the captivity of killer whales. Orcas in captivity may develop physical pathologies, such as the dorsal fin collapse seen in 80‚Äì90% of captive males. The captive environment bears little resemblance to their wild habitat, and the social groups that the killer whales are put into are foreign to those found in the wild. Critics claim that captive life is stressful due to small tanks, false social groupings and chemically altered water. Captive killer whales have been observed acting aggressively toward themselves, other killer whales, or humans, which critics say is a result of stress. Disease and lifespan The lifespan of killer whales in captivity versus wild killer whales is disputed. Several studies published in scientific journals show that the average mortality rate for captive killer whales is approximately three times higher than in the wild. A 2015 study in the Journal of Mammalogy, authored by SeaWorld's vice-president of theriogenology, Todd Robeck, concluded that the life expectancy for killer whales born at SeaWorld is the same as those in the wild. In the wild, female killer whales have a typical lifespan of 60‚Äì80 years, and a maximum recorded lifespan of 103 years. The average lifespan for males in the wild is 30 years, but some live up to 50‚Äì60 years. The 2015 study has been criticised by Trevor Willis, senior lecturer in marine biology at the University of Portsmouth, who stated that the study is misleading, \\"clearly wrong\\" and indicative of \\"poor practice\\". He stated that it is misleading in two ways: \\"First, it compares two completely different circumstances: the controlled environment of a swimming pool, with highly trained vets on hand; and the wild ocean. \\"There are no predators in a swimming pool. Second, and in the absence of any other information, it appears they‚Äôve looked at the survival rate of calves in the first two years of life and extrapolated it out 50 years into the future.\\" He also stated that no captive orca has lived for 55.8 years, the recorded average life expectancy of adult orcas at SeaWorld. SeaWorld San Antonio's 14-year-old Taku, born in captivity, died suddenly on October 17, 2007. Trainers were notified that Taku had been acting differently a week before his death. The necropsy determined that Taku had died from a sudden case of pneumonia, a common illness among captive orcas. It was also discovered that Taku was infected by the West nile virus, transmitted by mosquitos. The shallowness of orca tanks forces orcas to spend a lot of time at the surface, where they are exposed to ultraviolet (UV) rays. Sunburns and the development of cataracts in orcas in captivity are attributed to this exposure. Orcas in the wild live at higher latitudes, meaning less intense sun, and spend more time in deeper, darker waters. While the effects of prolonged UV exposure on orcas' skin is uncertain, since captive orca necropsies are extremely secretive, it is thought that prolonged exposure to UV rays on unprotected skin would have the same negative effects such as melanoma (skin cancer) on orcas as it does on humans. The original Namu developed a bacterial infection which damaged his nervous system, causing him to become unresponsive to people. During his illness he charged full-speed into the wire mesh of his pen, thrashed violently for a few minutes and then died. Dorsal fin collapse This male (Tilikum), at SeaWorld Orlando, had a collapsed dorsal fin. Most captive male killer whales, and some females, have a dorsal fin that is partially or completely collapsed to one side. Several hypotheses exist as to why this happens. A dorsal fin is held erect by collagen, which normally hardens in late adolescence. Scientists from the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) have reported that \\"the collapsed dorsal fins commonly seen in captive killer whales do not result from a pathogenic condition, but are instead thought to most likely originate from an irreversible structural change in the fin's collagen over time. Possible explanations for this include: (1) alterations in water balance caused by the stresses of captivity dietary changes, (2) lowered blood pressure due to reduced activity patterns, or (3) overheating of the collagen brought on by greater exposure of the fin to the ambient air.\\" According to SeaWorld's website, another reason for the fin to bend may be the greater amount of time that captive whales spend at the surface, where the fin is not supported by water pressure. The Whale and Dolphin Conservation says that dorsal fin collapse is largely explained by captive killer whales swimming in small circles due to the inadequate space in which they have to swim. Collapsed or collapsing dorsal fins are rare in most wild populations and usually result from a serious injury to the fin, such as from being shot or colliding with a vessel. After exposure to the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill, two male resident killer whales experienced dorsal fin collapse, and the animals subsequently died. In 2002, the dorsal fin of a stranded killer whale showed signs of collapse after three days but regained its natural upright appearance as soon as the orca resumed strong normal swimming upon release. A study in 1998 recorded that 7 out of 30 (23%) adult male killer whales off the coast of New Zealand had abnormal dorsal fins. Fins were considered abnormal if they displayed collapse, partial collapse, or bends. This is a higher prevalence of these deformities than in other areas of the world, as studies have reported rates of abnormal fins in wild adult males at 4.7% in British Columbia and 0.57% in Norway. Researchers in 1994 found that of the ~300 killer whales photographed off the coast of British Columbia, fewer than 1% were observed to have \\"droopy\\" dorsal fins. Attacks on humans ABC News reported that captive killer whales have attacked nearly two dozen people since the 1970s. Studies of killer whales in the wild have identified at least two categories, based on their territorial range. Those living in a limited area, such as Puget Sound or the Strait of Juan de Fuca, are termed \\"resident\\" whales, while \\"transient\\" whales roam the oceans at will. These \\"transient\\" types have to be more aggressive, in order to assert themselves in a wide range of territories and to prey on a variety of different species. This increased aggressiveness does not disappear in captivity. Furthermore, captivity itself has been asserted to aggravate aggressive behavior, resulting in a \\"cetacean equivalent of anxiety disorder.\\" Captive killer whale attacks on humans seem to fall mostly into the categories of: biting during feeding, ramming in the water, and holding under water. Killer whales biting trainers during feeding or shows is generally the mildest form of attack seen, but can escalate to an animal dragging the trainer underwater and holding them there until they lose consciousness or drown. Trainers who have had killer whales ram into them in the water tend to suffer from a range of injuries including internal bleeding, broken bones, ruptured organs, and heart attack. Tilikum, a large bull male killer whale who died in early 2017, had been involved in the death of three individuals since his capture near Iceland in November 1983.

Trainers believe that Gudrun's behavior towards Nyar may have confused Taima, as she may have learned by example that this was how to raise a calf. In May 1998, Taima gave birth to a male calf named Sumar. They were separated when he was about eight months old because of the aggression between them. On one occasion while performing, Taima started biting Sumar and throwing him out of the pool onto the trainer's platform. She then slid out herself, and continued to bite him. In November 2000, Taima gave birth to a male named Tekoa. The two were separated after only nine months due to aggression between them.\\"Beyond the Blue: Taima\\" Free Webs. Retrieved February 12, 2009. \\"Sumar\\" Beyond the Blue. Retrieved February 12, 2009. On March 12, 2007, Taima gave birth to her third calf, Malia. Taima seemed to be a better mother this time, and no notable occurrences of aggression were reported; this may be in part due to the fact that Kalina acted as \\"aunt\\" to Malia and helped Taima to look after her. Kalina was a very experienced mother and was often kept with Malia, while Taima was given time with her mate, Tilikum. Taima died in 2010 during the birthing process of her fourth calf. The calf, fathered by Tilikum, was stillborn. Kayla, a killer whale born in captivity, gave birth to her first calf on October 9, 2005, a female named Halyn. Kayla rejected her calf, perhaps because she had never been exposed to a young calf before and did not know how to deal with it. Halyn was moved to a special animal care facility to be hand raised. Halyn died unexpectedly on June 15, 2008. On October 13, 2010, Kohana, an eight- year-old female killer whale, gave birth to a male calf at Loro Parque's \\"Orca Ocean\\" exhibit after a four-hour labor. The calf weighed about 150 kilograms (330 lb), and was two meters (6 ft 7 in) long. Kohana has yet to establish a \\"maternal bond\\" with her calf, forcing trainers to take the first steps in hand rearing him. The outcome of this pregnancy was not considered surprising, since Kohana was separated from her own mother, Takara, at three years of age, and was never able to learn about maternal care, compounded by the fact that she spent the formative years of her life surrounded by the three other juvenile killer whales at Loro Parque.

The small town of Zangasso (or Sangasso), the administrative centre (chef-lieu) of the commune, is 30 km southwest of Koutiala on the Route Nationale 11 that links Koutiala with Sikasso. The French explorer Ren√© Cailli√© stopped at Zangasso on 12 February 1828 on his journey to Timbuktu. He was travelling with a caravan transporting kola nuts to Djenn√©. In his book Travels through Central Africa to Timbuctoo published in 1830, he spelled the name of the village as Sanasso. He wrote: > As we advanced the soil became sandy and well cultivated.

These meltwater channels can have different sizes, ranging from very small channels of a metre deep and wide to big valleys which can be up to a kilometre wide. The dimensions of these channels are regulated by several factors: water temperature, meltwater volume, debris content in the water, ice wall closure rates (governed by the ice thickness) and squeezing of fluidized sediment.van der Meer, Jaap JM, John Menzies, and James Rose. 2003. \\"Subglacial till: the deforming glacier bed.\\" Review of. Quaternary Science Reviews 22 (15):1659-85. In the glaciological literature three forms of subglacial meltwater channels are commonly mentioned. R-channels The first type of channel is the R-channel after Hans R√∂thlisberger who initiated work on water pressures in tubes under glaciers.R√∂thlisberger, H. 1972, Water pressure in intra- and subglacial channels. Journal of Glaciology, Vol. 11, No. 62, p. 177-203. These are semi-circular channels cut upward into the ice. The balance between channel enlargement by viscous heating and closure by ice deformation when the channels are water-filled reflects their size and water pressure. He stated the equation :\\\\frac{dp_w}{dx}=const\\\\cdot Q^{-2/11}\\\\Big(\\\\frac{p_i-p_w}{nA}\\\\Big)^{8n/11} where Q is the discharge, A and n the same as in Glens's Flow Law, p_w is the steady state pressure, p_i is the initial pressure, and x is the distance upstream.

H-channels The second type mentioned are H-channels, after Roger Hooke.Hooke, Roger LeB, T. Laumann, and J. Kohler. 1990. \\"Sub glacial water pressures and the shape of subglacial conduits.\\" Journal of Glaciology 36 (122):67-71. These channels are similar to R channels, cut upward into the ice that tends to follow the local bed slope but are broad and flatter than R channels. Such channels form where water flows at atmospheric pressure beneath thin ice and on steep downglacier bedslopes. N-channels The final type, the N-channel (after John Nye), are those incised into bedrock, perhaps suggesting long-term channel stability under some glaciers.Gray, H H. 2001.

They are known for their high energy live performances and their pioneering use of social media . History The band was formed by brothers Axel and P√•l Vindenes, together with school friends Jonas Nielsen and Stian S√¶vig. All classically trained musicians, the band was formed to play a one-off show at a local youth centre, Ungdomshuset 1880, but after positive response the band continued to play many live shows around Norway. In 2006, the band made their first recording and released the EP Already Your Favourite EP which was produced by Matias Tellez and featured the track \\"OOO\\". Kakkmaddafakka released its first LP Down to Earth on 24 September 2007, which reached number twenty on the VG Topp30 Album list and brought the band nationwide attention in their native Norway, despite a largely negative critical response. The band is one of many artists who emerged from Bergen, which the Norwegian press has called the \\"New Bergen Wave\\", as it is reminiscent of the many successful bands that emerged from Bergen in the late 1990s and the early 2000s. Kakkmaddafakka has performed at numerous festivals including Iceland Airwaves, Montreux Jazz Festival, NXNE, CMJ Music Marathon, Southside Festival, Hurricane Festival, Eurosonic Festival, by:Larm, Area 4 Hove and Melt! Festival in Germany, where they were introduced on stage by prominent Bergen musician and friend Erlend √òye. Kakkmaddafakka live at Dockville Festival, Germany, 2011 In 2008, Kakkmaddafakka was nominated as Best Norwegian Act in the MTV Europe Music Awards, along with Madcon, Ida Maria, Karpe Diem and eventual winners Erik og Kriss.  Hest (2011)  On 25 February 2011, Kakkmaddafakka released their second album Hest. The album was produced by Erlend √òye and released on the label Bubbles. The first single taken from the album was \\"Restless\\".  Six Months is a Long Time (2013)  On 28 June 2013, the band released their third album Six Months Is a Long Time. It was again produced by Erlend √òye and released on Universal Music Germany. featuring the singles \\"Someone New\\", \\"Young\\" and \\"Forever Alone\\". In early 2014, pianist and founder member Jonas Nielsen left the band and was replaced by Sebastian Emin Kittelsen.  2016 & 2017  The band released their fourth album titled KMF on 18 March 2016. In 2017, after 12 years playing in the band, the guitarist and singer P√•l Vindenes started a parallel solo project under the name Pish publishing the two singles Compromised and Crime.

The RB3011 was renamed from RB2011, because Rolls-Royce employees kept confusing the 2011 with the expected service entry date. Rolls-Royce bought the Allison Engine Company in 1995, and has studied the Pratt & Whitney/Allison 578-DX propfan engine built in the 1980s. The engine has two contra-rotating rotors (fans) on the outside of the engine nacelle, either at the front of the assembly (\\"tractor\\") or at the rear (\\"pusher\\"). Both pusher and tractor open rotor designs form part of Rolls-Royce's long-term \\"15-50\\" vision, which is examining various architectures to tackle the 150 seat-aircraft market. Within 15-50 group -named for specific fuel consumption reductions of 15‚Äì50% compared with current generation engines- there are various options based on technology availability and maturity.Aviation Week & Space Technology/24 November 2008 The open rotor design is known to have increased noise compared to normal turbofan engines, where noise is contained by the engine duct. The forward rotor is larger in diameter than the rear rotor, to avoid problems with eddies from the forward rotor tips. The rotors are powered by the engine shaft via an epicyclic gearbox. These produce a large amount of heat. In late 2008, the RB3011 was considered a contender for the powerplant of the Irkut MS-21. Rolls-Royce felt it could develop and certificate the engine before the aircraft's planned (at the time) certification in the first quarter of 2015. The engine has been tested at the Aircraft Research Association in Bedford, Bedfordshire. Wind tunnel testing has taken place at DNW in Marknesse in the Netherlands.Home ¬ª DNW Aero It is hoped to reduce the fuel consumption of an aircraft, compared to those with normal turbofan engines, by up to 30%. This is the main reason for choosing this design of engine. Certification is planned for 2017‚Äì2018, with market entry with airlines by 2020.

Although primarily known as the remains of an Iron Age proto-urban hill fort (or oppidum), the excavations at the site have revealed evidence of sequential settlement, extending from the Bronze to Middle Ages.Francisco Sande Lemos & Gon√ßalo Correida da Cruz (2007) History Cit√¢nia de Briteiros during an 1877 archaeological campaign Castro houses reconstructed by Martins Sarmento at the Cit√¢nia de Briteiros The lattice grid of walls that divide the Cit√¢nia structures The contextual view of the \\"residences\\" within the structure The site was probably constructed between the first and second century BCE. Notes by Martins Sarmento and from recent explorations show that the Monte de S√£o Rom√£o was a favoured location for rock art engravings of the Atlantic Bronze Age, in the beginning of the first millennium BCE; it is not known when or why this first group left. Numerous early engraved rock surfaces were destroyed when many boulders were cut to build the ramparts and family compounds as the Castro settlement grew. Little is known of the beginnings of the Castro occupation, as no structures from the late Bronze Age have been found. Pottery from the early Iron Age has been found, when the settlement would already have been fortified. The majority of the ruins visible today have been dated from the second Iron Age, especially the last two centuries BCE. The Castro inhabitants are believed to have been Celtic.Pr√≥sper, B. M. (2002) Lenguas y religiones prerromanas del occidente de la pen√≠nsula ib√©rica. Universidad de Salamanca. 2002. . pp. 374-380 Approximately half the pre-Latin toponyms of Gallaecia were Celtic, while the rest were either non Celtic western Indo-European, or mixed toponyms containing Celtic and non-Celtic elements. Sometime in the first century AD the settlement was occupied by Roman settlers. Expansion of the Roman Empire into the region has left evidence in the oppidum at Briteiros, in the form of coins (those of Augustus and Tiberius are the most numerous found, with smaller numbers of coins of the Republic, and the Flavians and the Antonines) ranging from the 1st century BCE to the 2nd century CE. A small number of amphorae and red pottery pieces have been found, and there is some evidence of Romanization in the architecture of the alleys and buildings of the eastern slope, but overall the visible impact of Roman occupiers is not strong. The reduced number of later coin and pottery finds suggests that occupation of the oppidum was declining from the 1st century CE, resulting in the 2nd century with very few people living within the ramparts. Evidence shows that there was a transitory reoccupation in the High Middle Ages, which included the building of a medieval chapel and graveyard on the acropolis. The site has been studied extensively since 1874, with the first excavations beginning in 1875, when the Portuguese archaeologist Francisco Martins Sarmento began annual excavation campaigns while helping to develop methods of archaeological research and preservation in Portugal. Sarmento's campaigns led to the discovery of much of the ruins of the acropolis (the highest portion of the settlement), and he reconstructed a pair of dwellings on the site from his research. Continuing discoveries during the first decades of work led Martins Sarmento to purchase the land on which the settlement lay, which was regularly continued by the Sociedade Martins Sarmento. The land and Martins Sarmento's research materials were bequeathed to the Society. From the 1930s through the 1960s, new excavations were carried out by the Society, supervised by M√°rio Cardozo, which led to the discovery of large parts of the settlement on the eastern slope and additional portions of the acropolis. Further surveys were made in the 1970s (in the north-eastern section), and in 2002, 2005 and 2006. The site was classified and protected by IPPAR as a Portuguese National Monument in 1910.Instituto Portugu√™s do Patrim√≥nio Arquitect√≥nico (IPPAR) classification of the site (in Portuguese) As research methods developed over the 19th and 20th centuries, the successive excavations at the Briteiros site adapted to evolving concepts, and gaps remain in the scientific knowledge of the site. In 2004 a project was initiated under the responsibility of Minho University with the collaboration of the Martins Sarmento Society to integrate the past studies and improve the conservation of the site. Beginning in 1956, the excavations took on a new character, as archaeological objects began being collected from the site, a process that continued in digs in 1958 to 1961, 1964 and 1968. In 1962, the archaeological work was carried out by the Servi√ßos de Conserva√ß√£o (Conservation Services). In 1974 and 1977, there were works to conserve and clean the area, including various larger projects. Between 1977 and 1978, archaeological interventions were handled by a team that included Armando Coelho Ferreira da Silva and Rui Centeno, from the Faculty of Letters of the University of Porto. Following excavations and surveys by archaeologist Francisco Sande Lemos, the Sociedade Martins Sarmento (UAM) proposed (in 2006) the creation of a proto-history biological estate, as a form of interpretative centre, alongside the site, to revitalize the location. Strata were discovered during this time that indicated a human occupation before the reorganization of the urban space. Between October and November, a secondary baths near the national E.N.306 roadway. Architecture Panorama of the hill of the Cit√¢nia de Briteiros, view from the south The site is situated on a small promontory called Monte de S√£o Rom√£o between the civil parishes of Salvador de Briteiros and Donim, about northwest of Guimar√£es. Situated over the Ave River, the site offers an extensive view over the river and its valley, and over an early north-south trade and communication between the Douro and Minho river valleys. The moderate elevation of the site, the temperate and humid climate and the nearby river also provided rich natural resources for exploitation and settlement.Sande Lemos, Francisco: Cit√¢nia de Briteiros: Visitor's Guide. Sociedade Martins Sarmento (2007) The Briteiros site is called a cit√¢nia or cividade (from Latin civitas, for city), due to its large size and city-like structure; other examples from the region and period include the Cit√¢nia de Sanfins and Cividade de Terroso. The visible ruins of the walled village or hill fort includes a plan of great dimensions with four lines of walls and approximately oval shape. The main platform covers area of 24 hectares, following along two principal axis. The defensive ramparts includes a partially maintained fourth line to the north and a pair of moats. The preserved walls measure thick and less than high; a portion of the wall was restored by Martins Sarmento that measures almost high. The walls were built using irregular dry stone masonry methods, edged on both sides. The innermost rampart was partially absorbed into the urban development by being incorporated as a support wall for several family compounds. Gates were cut through each of the ramparts to provide passage; some of the gate openings still have hollows where palisades were placed. Ramps and stairs providing access to the top of the third rampart are evident. Briteiros is an unusual castros, having its streets arranged into a roughly grid pattern.Paul MacKendrick (1969) The \\"urbanized\\" area of the settlement includes an acropolis surrounded by the first rampart in an elevated area of about 7 hectares. The Pedra Formosa from the baths of the Cit√¢nia de Briteiros Around 100 residential compounds were found in this area, grouped into small blocks divided by several streets. Each of the compounds, were delimited by masonry walls, and provided living and working space for a large family. These structures included one to three circular stone houses, some large with an atrium, where the nuclear family lived; other structures within the compound housed other family members, served as stables or stored agricultural tools, food, and rain or spring water. Daily tasks and crafts were performed in the stone-paved courtyard of the compound, which formed the center of family life in the cit√¢nia. Assuming around 6 people per family unit, a population of the acropolis of around 625 people has been estimated, but estimates may reach as many as 1500 for the entire settlement when excavations are made of the eastern and south-western extremities. The ramparts and main roads are the most visible part of the site, although there are conduits that carried water from a spring on the hill, fountains, two public bath structures and a large meeting or council house. The ruins of one bath (accidentally found during road work in the 1930s) is the best-preserved construction of its kind in northern Portugal and Galicia. Including a decorative monolith of almost , called the Pedra Formosa (the \\"handsome stone\\") thought to have once formed part of a burial chamber.) Between the second and third line of defences, along the south, is a structure with kiln.

It is anti-angiogenic and also acts as an immunomodulator. Pomalidomide was approved in February 2013, by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a treatment for relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma. It has been approved for use in people who have received at least two prior therapies including lenalidomide and bortezomib and have demonstrated disease progression on or within 60 days of completion of the last therapy. It received a similar approval from the European Commission in August 2013. Origin and development The parent compound of pomalidomide, thalidomide, was originally discovered to inhibit angiogenesis in 1994. Based upon this discovery, thalidomide was taken into clinical trials for cancer, leading to its ultimate FDA approval for multiple myeloma. Structure-activity studies revealed that amino substituted thalidomide had improved antitumor activity, which was due to its ability to directly inhibit both the tumor cell and vascular compartments of myeloma cancers. This dual activity of pomalidomide makes it more efficacious than thalidomide in vitro and in vivo. Mechanism of action Pomalidomide directly inhibits angiogenesis and myeloma cell growth. This dual effect is central to its activity in myeloma, rather than other pathways such as TNF alpha inhibition, since potent TNF inhibitors including rolipram and pentoxifylline do not inhibit myeloma cell growth or angiogenesis. Upregulation of interferon gamma, IL-2 and IL-10 as well as downregulation of IL-6 have been reported for pomalidomide. These changes may contribute to pomalidomide's anti-angiogenic and anti-myeloma activities.  Pregnancy and sexual contact warnings Because pomalidomide can cause harm to unborn babies when administered during pregnancy, women taking pomalidomide must not become pregnant. To avoid embryo-fetal exposure, a \\"Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy\\" (REMS) program was developed to ensure pregnancy prevention or distribution of the drug to those who are or might become pregnant. Women must produce two negative pregnancy tests and use contraception methods before beginning pomalidomide. Women must commit either to abstain continuously from heterosexual sexual intercourse or to use two methods of reliable birth control, beginning four weeks prior to initiating treatment with pomalidomide, during therapy, during dose interruptions and continuing for four weeks following discontinuation of pomalidomide therapy. Pomalidomide is present in the semen of people receiving the drug. Therefore, males must always use a latex or synthetic condom during any sexual contact with females of reproductive potential while taking pomalidomide and for up to 28 days after discontinuing pomalidomide, even if they have undergone a successful vasectomy. Males taking pomalidomide must not donate sperm. Clinical trials Phase I trial results showed tolerable side effects. Phase II clinical trials for multiple myeloma and myelofibrosis reported 'promising results'. Phase III results showed significant extension of progression-free survival, and overall survival (median 11.9 months vs. 7.8 months; p = 0.0002) in patients taking pomalidomide and dexamethasone vs. dexamethasone alone.
