History  SKUvantage was founded in 2012 by Daniel Roberts and Joshua Gavin. During their experience of launching e-commerce projects for Woolworths Australia, Woolworths UK and Tesco, the founders realised that product photography and product content was a major challenge for retailers. They developed SKUvantage to provide a service with associated technology for retailers to minimise the effort and cost of delivering product content for their ecommerce platforms. In June 2012 the business secured funding from a number of investors including Breon Corcoran and The Foundry, an Australian Private Equity company. SKUvantage commenced formal operation in September of that year.  Services  Product content is the information presented by retailers and their vendors about their products to enable consumers to make an informed purchase choice. This information includes images, data, descriptions, video and other forms of digital content. Product content is different to long form product content, in that it is specific to products. Studies show that retailers are increasingly investing in both forms of product content to drive conversion rate. SKUvantage is recognised within Australia as providing value add services particularly in the grocery / FMCG sector for help suppliers display better product content to consumers. SKUvantage provides a number of services under the \\"SKU\\" prefix to support retailers and brands in this area. SKU stands for Stock Keeping Unit in a retail context. These services include: * SKUvantage - A suite of content capture services including product photography, product data transcription and product description writing service * SKUlibrary - A product content syndication platform, used to share product content between supplier and retailers * SKUcapture - A product content portal to manage the acquisition of product content from suppliers SKUvantage is used by many of Australia's leading retailers. It also manages content forthe majority of FMCG leading FMCG brands via the SKUlibrary platform for distribution into retailers. SKUvantage is involved in providing full product content, which includes product photography, nutritional information and marketing copy, for grocery products within Australia.  Operations  The SKUvantage platform of SKUlibrary is built on the hybris ecommerce platform, owned by SAP. A customisation of this platform has enabled SKUvantage to pioneer a flexible way of publishing product photography and other product content into consumers of content such as retailers and brand web sites. The SKUlibrary platform, is used extensively within the grocery/ FMCG sectors in Australia to deliver product content to retailers and end consumers. A partnership with the Drinks Association of Australia, has resulted in dedicated version of the platform for the drinks industry.

Life The son of Michael Taylor, an Edinburgh merchant, was born at Portobello in Midlothian on 29 January 1824. He was educated at Portsmouth, and matriculated at the University of Edinburgh in 1840, studying botany and graduating with an MD in 1843. In the following year he obtained a diploma from the Edinburgh College of Physicians and Surgeons. He was appointed assistant to Professor John Hutton Balfour, and was also one of the founders and early presidents of the Hunterian Medical Society. During 1844 Taylor studied surgery at Paris for nine months, and then visited European cities collecting botanical specimens. In 1845 he settled at Penrith in Cumberland, and soon after that succeeded to the practice of Dr John Taylor. In 1858 he discovered that scarlet fever might be caused by contamination in the milk supply. In 1868 he assisted in founding the border counties branch of the British Medical Association, and was the second to hold the office of president. Taylor as an antiquary made local discoveries: the vestiges of Celtic occupation on Ullswater, the starfish cairns of Moor Divock, the prehistoric remains at Clifton, and the Croglin moulds for casting spear-heads in bronze. He was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London on 27 May 1886, and was a fellow of the Scottish Society of Antiquaries, a member of the Epidemiological Society, and a member of the council of the Royal Arch√¶ological Institute. He joined the Cumberland and Westmorland Antiquarian and Arch√¶ological Society soon after its formation in 1866. Taylor retired from medical practice in 1884, and died in London on 24 November 1892. He is buried at Penrith in the Christ Church burial-ground.

All three species are endemic to Florida scrub habitat of peninsular Florida, and F. penneri is considered a critically imperiled species by NatureServe. Prior to the description of F. orini, the genus (then only a single species) was considered the sole member of the family Floridobolidae, named by William T. Keeton in 1959, however studies in 2014 have argued that Floridobolus does not represent a distinct family but rather is a basal member of the family Spirobolidae, representing the subfamily Floridobolinae, and tribe Floridobolini. Description Species of Floridobolus range from long with 45 to 50 body rings or segments as adults. The body is not purely cylindrical, but rather is widest around the 12th or 13th rings, and tapers towards the head and telson (rear end). The body is oval in cross section whereas most other related millipedes are circular in cross section. The body color ranges from slate gray to olive, with some species more uniform while others having lighter yellowish bands on the rear margin of body rings. Species The three species of Floridobolus differ primarily in shape and proportion of the gonopods (male reproductive appendages), and in geographic location, each occurring on different sand ridges running from north to south in Florida. =Floridobolus penneri= NatureServe Floridobolus penneri was described in 1957 by Nell B. Causey based on individuals collected near the Archbold Biological Station. Mature individuals generally range from long and 10.8 to 11.6 mm wide. Its known natural predators include larval Phengodes laticollis (glowworm beetles) and adult Mastigoproctus giganteus (giant whip scorpions). F. penneri has been assessed by NatureServe as critically imperiled globally and nationally due to a range of less than 1,000 square kilometers (400 square miles), few populations known, and historic decline in Florida scrub habitat. =Floridobolus orini= Floridobolus orini was described in 2014 and is only known from the Ocala National Forest. Individuals grow from long, 10 to 13 mm wide, and possess 47 to 50 body rings (segments). The body color is gray with body rings bordered in yellow. =Floridobolus floydi= Floridobolus floydi was also described in 2014, based on individuals collected in Citrus and Hernando counties, occurring further west than other Floridobolus species.

It is located 29 miles northeast of Manhattan at the crossroads of K-99 and K-16. History Many of the first settlers or their family members had originally immigrated to America during the Great Famine of Ireland and then slowly moved westward. The immigrants established the settlement of Butler City along Bluff Creek which served as the first settlers' main water source. Butler City was officially platted at tier 6 south, ranges 9 and 10 east on October 14, 1879; the young town's namesake was Father Thomas Ambrose Butler, an Irish Priest in St. Louis, who encouraged the original settlers to \\"colonize\\" in and around modern day Blaine. The community initially was settled by 60 Irish Catholics families in 1873. The Irish emigrants came from a poor Irish neighborhood of St. Louis known as the ‚ÄúKerry Patch‚Äù. A post office was opened in Butler City in 1874 Since another town was already named Butler City in Kansas, residents decided to rename the town to Blaine after James G. Blaine. A railway was built a short time later. The rail line that originally ran through Blaine was built as a narrow-gauge railroad called the Kansas Central. It was standard-gauged by the Union Pacific and was finally abandoned in 1934. Another little railroad was built from Blaine seven miles south to Westmoreland called the Kansas, Southern & Gulf Railway. It was later changed to the Westmoreland Interurban Railway and used a touring car and trailer on railroad wheels to move freight. It was razed in 1915. Although Irish Catholics made up the majority of Blaine and the surrounding area, these people did not exist in cultural isolation. The original Irish settlers in Blaine were joined by a few German families throughout the latter part of the 19th century. At Blaine's peak, there were approximately 200 people living in the community. Today it is around 30, a majority of whom are the descendants of the original settlers. File:Thomas A. Butler (retouched).jpgThomas Butler, for whom the town was originally named. File:Butler City.pdfThe original planned layout for Butler City. Demographics =Religion= Blaine is historically and to this day primarily Catholic. In 1881, the first church was completed. The church was named St. Columbkille Catholic Church and Mount Calvary cemetery was established in 1885. In 1908, a larger red brick gothic-style church was built to replace the previous church. It's Knights of Columbus Council was chartered in 1921, and remains active today. The church has remained open through parish consolidation has occurred in rural areas. Weekly Mass is still celebrated, although instead of a resident priest, the parish shares a priest with several other churches in the area.

Education A Catholic school was opened in 1919 and was active until 1966. A storm damaged both the school and church in June 2010, the church was fixed but the school couldn't be economically repaired, so it was razed.

It was aired on June 19, 2014. The episode was written by Kevin Murphy and directed by Michael Nankin. Plot Nine months later... Datak (Tony Curran), who was elected as the new mayor of Defiance at the end of Season One, is now imprisoned in Earth Republic's Camp Reverie after murdering Colonel Marsh. He is replaced as \\"provisional\\" mayor by the E-Rep-appointed Niles Pottinger (James Murray). Stahma (Jaime Murray) visits Datak in the prison camp, and he asks her to get him out sooner than the ten years to which he was sentenced, fearing that otherwise his business empire will collapse. Stahma tells him that their solicitor is working on it and reassures him that Alak (Jesse Rath) has taken over the business and he is doing really well. When Stahma leaves, Doc Yewll (Trenna Keating) who's also imprisoned, approaches Datak and asks for his help to a plan she has on how to escape. Datak takes her offer and agrees to help. Back in Defiance, Amanda (Julie Benz) has taken over the Need/Want, her sister's business, after Kenya's (Mia Kirshner) disappearance. Stahma, who killed Kenya and knows she is not coming back, tries to convince Amanda to move on but Amanda is sure that Kenya will return. Rafe (Graham Greene) works in the gulanite mines, now \\"nationalized\\" by E-Rep order. While working, an accident happens and Large (Roman LeBeau) dies. His distraught sons, Josef (Ryan Kennedy) and Hyatt (Sam Earle), are caught vandalizing an E-Rep poster and are arrested. Niles orders his bio-man assistant Churchill (Rob Archer) to \\"take care of them.\\" Driving them to prison, Churchill lets the two boys escape, and they run into Hellbug territory where Hyatt is killed. Josef returns home and announces Hyatt's death. Amanda realizes their escape was arranged so as to make examples of the boys, and confronts Niles in his office demanding to know what happened. Niles shows her a video of the moment the boys escaped and says he didn't have anything to do with it, but Amanda doesn't believe him. She regrets having turned down Niles' offer to make her his chief of staff months earlier, speculating that if she hadn't, Hyatt might still be alive, and agrees to take the job \\"for now.\\" Alak deals with a supplier, Skevur (Michael Dyson), who delays the delivery of the drug called Blue Devil and convinces Alak to give him more time. Stahma warns Alak that he showed weakness and his father would never do that. She then takes action on her own, having Skevur beaten into returning Alak his payment. Alak realizes that his mother is responsible and confronts Stahma, who reveals that the family business really belongs to her and demands that Alak follow her orders from now on. Meanwhile, in New Chicago, Nolan (Grant Bowler) continues his search for Irisa (Stephanie Leonidas). Nolan tracks down Daigo (Ben Cotton), the man who tortured Irisa when she was a little girl, interrogating and killing him. He heads to the Angel Arc to continue his search. Running into an old enemy who tries to kill him, he is reunited with Irisa, who appears and saves his life. When Nolan asks what happened to her, Irisa lies to him, saying that E-Rep forces caught her. Nolan doesn't believe her, saying he saw her fall into the artifact in a vision, then woke up healed of his wounds. Irisa dismisses it as post- traumatic stress and says that she must return to Defiance after seeing \\"Young Irisa/Irzu\\" (Katie Douglas). While getting supplies, Irisa walks off and kills a woman for no reason. Irisa doesn't tell Nolan anything about her visions or her actions, and the two of them leave for Defiance. At the end of the episode, Irisa has another vision of herself killing Nolan while Young Irisa/Irzu is there; Amanda uses Blue Devil; and it is revealed that Niles has a camera on Amanda's room and watches/spies on her.

Yet it does so without betraying or ignoring the events and characterizations of its early episodes. [...] I think the thing I admire most about \\"The Opposite Of Hallelujah\\" is that it's a commitment. Defiance could quite easily have reverted to the status quo, or it could have pressed ahead with some totally different mythological tone.

Granted, it doesn‚Äôt have the same amount of action that we became accustomed to, but it does an excellent job of taking a series of events and somewhat foreshadowing the future of the show. With so many loose ends left in the premiere, the second season of Defiance is sure to be action packed.\\" Abbey White from Screen Spy gave a good review to the episode saying that it was a pretty sound one. \\"There was not a lot of action nor were there too many physical world changes. The character interactions, however, were some of the series best written. Perhaps this season will, despite the show‚Äôs heavy mythology and universe building, rely more on its characters to propel the narrative. If that‚Äôs the way they plan to go, things should definitely be interesting.\\" Kevin Yeoman from Screen Rant gave a good review to the episode. \\"'The Opposite of Hallelujah' benefits greatly from the additions to the cast, as Mayor Pottinger and Viceroy Mercado help break up the tenuous peace that defined the town of Defiance all last season, by drawing a clear line in the sand between the oppressors and the oppressed. That offers a different kind of dynamic than has been seen, and it opens the door for even more interesting and unlikely pairings\\" Ricky Riley from The Celebrity Cafe also gave a good review to the episode, saying that the season started with a bang. \\"Over all, this was very good season opener. I will have to say that this show knows how to choreograph fight scenes like no one else can. Action movies should take note. Hell, all TV should take note. [...] This season is looking up. It has all the potential of being better than the first.\\" Jesse Schedeen from IGN rated the episode with 7.8/10 saying that the nine months time-jump might be \\"a comfortable way to ease back into the series, though it's not the most exciting way to kick off a new season.\\" Schedeen closes the review saying: \\"Defiance's second season gets off to a good start, but not necessarily a great one. The new status quo allows for interesting changes in the lives of all the main characters, but the overall vibe and direction of the show hasn't changed as much as might have been expected given how Season 1 wrapped.\\" Andrew Clark from ThreeIfBySpace says that the season opener was weak. \\"I was disappointed with the content and was left still waiting for something to happen that never did. [...] The plot for this episode jumped around multiple times. In my opinion there are too many story arcs going on at the same time [...] With so many story arcs there is a lot of content, but not exclusive to one arc. This prevents me from finding a character I like and from being able to follow a clear story line.\\" References External links * Category:2014 American television episodes Category:Defiance (season 2) episodes ","title":"The Opposite of Hallelujah (Defiance)"},{"id":"43115940","text":"Phillip Gwynne (born 1958) is an Australian author.

When the post office was opened in Flush in 1899, the postmaster-general could not pronounce 'Floersch' and changed the name to Flush. Postal service to flush was discontinued in 1927. The church and community were settled predominately with German-speaking immigrants. The church maintained German- speaking priests until 1927. The church also opened a parish school in the 1890s which ceased operation in 1976. The town was poised for increased growth with the planned expansion of a railroad through Flush in 1908. The Floersch family even constructed a grain mill in flush that was designed to serve the railroad. However, the railroad was never constructed and the town never saw the growth the immigrants in the region expected.

With the advent of the concept of g factor or general intelligence, many researchers have argued that there are no significant sex differences in general intelligence, although ability in particular types of intelligence does appear to vary. While some test batteries show slightly greater intelligence in males, others show greater intelligence in females. In particular, studies have shown female subjects performing better on tasks related to verbal ability, and males performing better on tasks related to rotation of objects in space, often categorized as spatial ability. Some research indicates that male advantages on some cognitive tests are minimized when controlling for socioeconomic factors. Other research has concluded that there is slightly larger variability in male scores in certain areas compared to female scores, which results in more males than females in the top and bottom of the IQ distribution.  Historical perspectives  Prior to the 20th century, it was a commonly held view that men were intellectually superior to women. In 1801, Thomas Gisborne said that women were naturally suited to domestic work and not spheres suited to men such as politics, science, or business. He stated that this was because women did not possess the same level of rational thinking that men did and had naturally superior abilities in skills related to family support. In 1875, Herbert Spencer said that women were incapable of abstract thought and could not understand issues of justice and had only the ability to understand issues of care. In 1925, Sigmund Freud also stated that women were less morally developed in the concept of justice and, unlike men, were more influenced by feeling than rational thought. Early brain studies comparing mass and volumes between the sexes concluded that women were intellectually inferior because they have smaller and lighter brains. Many believed that the size difference caused women to be excitable, emotional, sensitive, and therefore not suited for political participation.Margarete Grandner, Austrian women in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries: cross-disciplinary perspectives, Berghahn Books, 1996, , In the nineteenth century, whether men and women had equal intelligence was seen by many as a prerequisite for the granting of suffrage. Leta Hollingworth argued that women were not permitted to realize their full potential, as they were confined to the roles of child-rearing and housekeeping. During the early twentieth century, the scientific consensus shifted to the view that gender plays no role in intelligence. In his 1916 study of children's IQs, psychologist Lewis Terman concluded that \\"the intelligence of girls, at least up to 14 years, does not differ materially from that of boys\\". He did, however, find \\"rather marked\\" differences on a minority of tests. For example, he found boys were \\"decidedly better\\" in arithmetical reasoning, while girls were \\"superior\\" at answering comprehension questions. He also proposed that discrimination, lack of opportunity, women's responsibilities in motherhood, or emotional factors may have accounted for the fact that few women had careers in intellectual fields. Research on general intelligence  =Background= Chamorro-Premuzic et al. stated, \\"The g factor, which is often used synonymously with general intelligence, is a latent variable which emerges in a factor analysis of various cognitive ('IQ') tests. They are not exactly the same thing. g is an indicator or measure of general intelligence; it's not general intelligence itself.\\" All or most of the major tests commonly used to measure intelligence have been constructed so that there are no overall score differences between males and females. Thus, there is little difference between the average IQ scores of men and women. Differences have been reported, however, in specific areas such as mathematics and verbal measures. Also, studies have found the variability of male scores is greater than that of female scores, resulting in more males than females in the top and bottom of the IQ distribution. = In favor of males or females in g factor = Research, using the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS III and WAIS-R), that finds general intelligence in favor of males indicates a very small difference. This is consistent across countries. In the United States and Canada, the IQ points range from two to three points in favor of males, while the points rise to four points in favor of males in China and Japan. By contrast, some research finds greater advantage for adult females. For children in the United States and the Netherlands, there are one to two IQ point differences in favor of boys. Other research has found a slight advantage for girls on the residual verbal factor. A 2004 meta-analysis by Richard Lynn and Paul Irwing published in 2005 found that the mean IQ of men exceeded that of women by up to 5 points on the Raven's Progressive Matrices test. Lynn's findings were debated in a series of articles for Nature. He argued that there is a greater male advantage than most tests indicate, stating that because girls mature faster than boys, and that cognitive competence increases with physiological age, rather than with calendar age, the male-female difference is small or negative prior to puberty, but males have an advantage after adolescence and this advantage continues into adulthood. = In favor of no sex differences or inconclusive consensus = Most studies find either a very small difference in favor of males or no sex difference with regard to general intelligence. In 2000, researchers Roberto Colom and Francisco J. Abad conducted a large study of 10,475 adults on five IQ tests taken from the Primary Mental Abilities and found negligible or no significant sex differences. The tests conducted were on vocabulary, spatial rotation, verbal fluency and inductive reasoning. The literature on sex differences in intelligence has produced inconsistent results due to the type of testing used, and this has resulted in debate among researchers. Garcia (2002) argues that there might be a small insignificant sex difference in intelligence in general (IQ) but this may not necessarily reflect a sex difference in general intelligence or g factor. Although most researchers distinguish between g and IQ, those that argued for greater male intelligence asserted that IQ and g are synonymous (Lynn & Irwing 2004) and so the real division comes from defining IQ in relation to g factor. In 2008 Lynn and Irwing proposed that since working memory ability correlates highest with g factor, researchers would have no choice but to accept greater male intelligence if differences on working memory tasks are found. As a result, a neuroimaging study published by Schmidt (2009) conducted an investigation into this proposal by measuring sex differences on an n-back working memory task. The results found no sex difference in working memory capacity, thus contradicting the position put forward by Lynn and Irwing (2008) and more in line with those arguing for no sex differences in intelligence. A 2012 review by researchers Richard E. Nisbett, Joshua Aronson, Clancy Blair, William Dickens, James Flynn, Diane F. Halpern and Eric Turkheimer discussed Arthur Jensen's 1998 studies on sex differences in intelligence. Jensen's tests were significantly g-loaded but were not set up to get rid of any sex differences (read differential item functioning). They summarized his conclusions as he quoted, \\"No evidence was found for sex differences in the mean level of g or in the variability of g. Males, on average, excel on some factors; females on others.\\" Jensen's conclusion that no overall sex differences existed for g has been reinforced by researchers who analyzed this issue with a battery of 42 mental ability tests and found no overall sex difference. Although most of the tests showed no difference, there were some that did. For example, they found female subjects performed better on verbal abilities while males performed better on visuospatial abilities. For verbal fluency, females have been specifically found to perform slightly better in vocabulary and reading comprehension and significantly higher in speech production and essay writing. Males have been specifically found to perform better on spatial visualization, spatial perception, and mental rotation. Researchers had then recommended that general models such as fluid and crystallized intelligence be divided into verbal, perceptual and visuospatial domains of g; this is because, as this model is applied, females excel at verbal and perceptual tasks while males excel on visuospatial tasks, thus evening out the sex differences on IQ tests. = Variability = Some studies have identified the degree of IQ variance as a difference between males and females. Males tend to show greater variability on many traits; for example having both highest and lowest scores on tests of cognitive abilities. Feingold (1992b) and Hedges and Nowell (1995) have reported that, despite average sex differences being small and relatively stable over time, test score variances of males were generally larger than those of females.\\" Feingold \\"found that males were more variable than females on tests of quantitative reasoning, spatial visualisation, spelling, and general knowledge. ... Hedges and Nowell go one step further and demonstrate that, with the exception of performance on tests of reading comprehension, perceptual speed, and associative memory, more males than females were observed among high-scoring individuals.\\"  Brain and intelligence  Differences in brain physiology between sexes do not necessarily relate to differences in intellect. Although men have larger brains, men and women typically achieve similar IQ results. For men, the gray matter volume in the frontal and parietal lobes correlates with IQ; for women, the gray matter volume in the frontal lobe and Broca's area (which is used in language processing) correlates with IQ. Women have greater cortical thickness, cortical complexity and cortical surface area (controlling for body size) which compensates for smaller brain size. Meta-analysis and studies have found that brain size explains 6‚Äì12% of variance among individual intelligence and cortical thickness explains 5%. Mathematics performance Girl scouts compete in the USS California Science Experience at Naval Surface Warfare. In 2008, the National Science Foundation reported that, on average, girls perform as well as boys on standardized math tests, while boys are overrepresented on both ends of the spectrum. A performance difference in mathematics on the SAT and international PISA\\"Gender differences in mathematics performance\\", p.196. OECD 2015. exists in favor of males, though differences in mathematics course performance measures favor females.Ann M. Gallagher, James C. Kaufman, Gender differences in mathematics: an integrative psychological approach, Cambridge University Press, 2005, , In 1983, Benbow concluded that the study showed a large sex difference by age 13 and that it was especially pronounced at the high end of the distribution. However, Gallagher and Kaufman criticized Benbow's and others' reports, which found that males were over-represented in the highest percentages, on the grounds that they had not ensured representative sampling. In nearly every study on the subject, males have out- performed females on mathematics in high school, but the size of the male- female difference, across countries, is related to gender inequality in social roles. In a 2008 study paid for by the National Science Foundation in the United States, however, researchers stated that \\"girls perform as well as boys on standardized math tests. Although 20 years ago, high school boys performed better than girls in math, the researchers found that is no longer the case. The reason, they said, is simple: Girls used to take fewer advanced math courses than boys, but now they are taking just as many.\\"Lewin, Tamar (July 25, 2008).\\"Math Scores Show No Gap for Girls, Study Finds\\", The New York Times. However, the study indicated that, while boys and girls performed similarly on average, boys were over-represented among the very best performers as well as among the very worst.Winstein, Keith J. (July 25, 2008). \\"Boys' Math Scores Hit Highs and Lows\\", The Wall Street Journal (New York). A 2011 meta-analysis with 242 studies from 1990 to 2007 involving 1,286,350 people found no overall sex difference of performance in mathematics. The meta-analysis also found that although there were no overall differences, a small sex difference that favored males in complex problem solving is still present in high school. With regard to gender inequality, some psychologists believe that many historical and current sex differences in mathematics performance may be related to boys' higher likelihood of receiving math encouragement than girls. Parents were, and sometimes still are, more likely to consider a son's mathematical achievement as being a natural skill while a daughter's mathematical achievement is more likely to be seen as something she studied hard for.Wood, Samuel; Wood, Ellen; Boyd Denise (2004). \\"World of Psychology, The (Fifth Edition)\\", Allyn & Bacon This difference in attitude may contribute to girls and women being discouraged from further involvement in mathematics-related subjects and careers. Stereotype threat has been shown to affect performance and confidence in mathematics of both males and females.  Spatial ability  Examples of figures from mental rotation tests. A man playing a video game at the Japan Media Arts Festival. Spatial abilities can be affected by experiences such as playing video games, complicating research on sex differences in spatial abilities. Metastudies show a male advantage in mental rotation and assessing horizontality and verticality and a female advantage in spatial memory.Halpern, Diane F., Sex differences in cognitive abilities, Psychology Press, 2000, , Ellis, Lee, Sex differences: summarizing more than a century of scientific research, CRC Press, 2008, , A proposed hypothesis is that men and women evolved different mental abilities to adapt to their different roles in society.Eals, Marion, and Irwin Silverman. 1992. Sex differences in spatial abilities: evolutionary theory and data. In The Adapted Mind: Evolutionary Psychology and the Generation of Culture, edited by J. H. Barkow. New York: Oxford University Press. This explanation suggests that men may have evolved greater spatial abilities as a result of certain behaviors, such as navigating during a hunt. A number of studies have shown that women tend to rely more on visual information than men in a number of spatial tasks related to perceived orientation.Witkin, H. A., Lewis, H. B., Hertzman, M., Machover, K., Meissner, P. B. & Wapner, S. (1954) Personality Through Perception. An Experimental and Clinical Study. Harper, New York. Results from studies conducted in the physical environment are not conclusive about sex differences, with various studies on the same task showing no differences. For example, there are studies that show no difference in finding one's way between two places. Performance in mental rotation and similar spatial tasks is affected by gender expectations.Paula J. Caplan, Gender differences in human cognition, Oxford University Press US, 1997, , For example, studies show that being told before the test that men typically perform better, or that the task is linked with jobs like aviation engineering typically associated with men versus jobs like fashion design typically associated with women, will negatively affect female performance on spatial rotation and positively influence it when subjects are told the opposite.Newcombe, N. S. (2007). Taking Science Seriously: Straight thinking about spatial sex differences. In S. Ceci & W. Williams (eds.), Why aren't more women in science? Top researchers debate the evidence (pp. 69‚Äì77). Washington, DC: American Psychological Association. Experiences such as playing video games also increase a person's mental rotation ability.Devlin, Ann Sloan, Mind and maze: spatial cognition and environmental behavior, Praeger, 2001, , The possibility of testosterone and other androgens as a cause of sex differences in psychology has been a subject of study. Adult women who were exposed to unusually high levels of androgens in the womb due to congenital adrenal hyperplasia score significantly higher on tests of spatial ability. Some research has found positive correlations between testosterone levels in healthy males and measures of spatial ability. However, the relationship is complex.  Sex differences in academics  A 2014 meta- analysis of sex differences in scholastic achievement published in the journal of Psychological Bulletin found females outperformed males in teacher-assigned school marks throughout elementary, junior/middle, high school and at both undergraduate and graduate university level. The meta-analysis, done by researchers Daniel Voyer and Susan D. Voyer from the University of New Brunswick, drew from 97 years of 502 effect sizes and 369 samples stemming from the year 1914 to 2011. Beyond sex differences in academic ability, recent research has also been focusing on women's underrepresentation in higher education, especially in the fields of natural science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM).S.

Tupanico used the excuse of cleaning Rock's rifle to load it with blanks. Before they can be killed, Rock and Andrea are rescued by natives friendly to the local missionary. After wandering lost in the jungle in the commotion, Andrea wakens to find herself and Rock at the mission. A grateful native, whom she treated earlier, gives her some gifts: the shrinking drug she was searching for, and the shrunken head of Tupanico.

Rudolph Icey handled cinematography, Raoul Kraushaar composed the score and Terry Morse served as editor. After filming, Siodmak had 10,000 feet of color film left over that he could not export. Love Slaves of the Amazons was the result, and used some of the same cast members. Reynold Brown, painter of numerous iconic Hollywood film posters, designed a poster for the film depicting a giant claw and a creature's glowering eye.Keep Watching the Skies!: American Science Fiction Movies of the Fifties by Bill Warren Release Curucu, Beast of the Amazon was released to theaters by Universal Studios in December 1956, with The Mole People. The film is now extremely rare, since it has never been officially released on either VHS or DVD.https://thestopbutton.com/2011/11/16/curucu-beast-amazon-1956/ Reception Author and film critic Leonard Maltin awarded the film 1.5 out of 4 stars, calling it \\"one of the most infamous disappointments for monster- loving kids of the 1950s\\". On his website Fantastic Movie Musings and Ramblings, Dave Sindelar gave the film a negative review, criticizing the film for using too much talking and exploring scenes just to fill its running time. Sindelar also noted that the only thing the film had going for it was Garland's \\"tough girl\\" character, but also wrote, \\"Unfortunately, the movie decides to punish her for her toughness; the last 30 minutes of the movie seems designed solely to frighten this woman into realizing that it'‚Äôs arrogant of her to think of herself as being as tough as a man\\". TV Guide awarded the film 1 out of 5 stars, calling it \\"a moderately amusing jungle adventure\\".

The royal vill was the centre for the administration of a subdivision of a kingdom, and the location where the subdivision would support the royal household through the provision of food rent. Royal vills have been identified as the centres of the regiones of the early Anglo-Saxon period, and of the smaller multiple estates into which regiones were gradually divided by the 8th century. The British Isles during the early Middle Ages lacked the sophisticated long distance trade in essential foodstuffs required to support agriculturally unproductive households in a single location. Kings and their entourages could therefore only support themselves by constantly moving between territories with an obligation to support them, and they maintained networks of halls and accommodation distributed throughout their kingdoms for this purpose. These royal vills also provided points of contact between royal households and local populations. Substantial Anglo-Saxon royal vills have been excavated at sites including Yeavering in Northumbria and at Cowdery's Down in Basingstoke, revealing settlements with large timber halls for feasting purposes and other social venues.

It includes personal accounts of his interactions with presidents from Franklin D. Roosevelt to Richard Nixon. Media coverage of the book As the New York Times book review said, \\"It's the story of a modest man who succeeded extravagantly by remaining mostly himself -- succeeded in a demanding new medium, itself part of an exploding technology that made the world more complex by enabling peoples to know more about one another. And not unlike journalism itself, his memoir is a short course on the flow of events in the second half of this century -- events the world knows more about because of Walter Cronkite's work, and some of which might not have happened without it.\\" Publishers Weekly said that \\"Written with wry, self- deprecating humor, Cronkite's memoir gives us the veteran TV newscaster at his most relaxed and ingratiating as he recounts dozens of his scoops.\\" The LA Times recounts, \\"Cronkite is entitled to boast--especially in a book that is less surprising for its hubris than for the bitterness with which it ends. After almost 400 pages of great stories, unforgettable characters and impressive journalistic achievements at CBS, Cronkite complains that ultimately he was 'driven from the temple where for 19 years . . .

She was a Fellow of Linacre College, Oxford from 1968‚Äì1992, and then Honorary Fellow from 1992. She served as President of the International Neuropsychological Society in 1985 and was made an Honorary Fellow of the British Psychological Society in 1994. She was awarded an honorary degree by the University of Essex in 1995.  Education  Newcombe took a Bachelor of Arts degree with Distinction in Psychology at the University of Manchester in 1946, before going on to post-graduate training in Clinical Psychology at the Institute of Psychiatry, London. She then moved to Greece, where she worked with the International Welfare Organization in Athens, before returning to the UK in 1961. In 1963 she was recruited by Professor William Ritchie Russell at the University of Oxford to study the effects of brain injuries caused by shrapnel wounds in British servicemen during World War II. This study formed the basis of her Doctor of Philosophy thesis, which was awarded in 1966, on \\"Selective Intellectual Deficit in Relation to Focal Cerebral Lesions.\\"  Research  Newcombe's doctoral studies on ex-servicemen were the basis for her 1969 book Missile Wounds of the Brain: a study of psychological deficits, in which she detailed relationships between cognitive deficits and lesion location. She retained a life-long interest in the group of ex-servicemen whom she studied, extending her studies to consider the impact of brain injury on cognitive aging. Her research was characterized by an interest not just in group data but also in detailed investigation of single cases. One of these, known in the literature as GR, had a surprising problem with reading words, in that he made semantic errors; for instance, when presented with the word 'canary' he would say 'parrot' - a word related in meaning but quite different in pronunciation. This cognitive profile, known as deep dyslexia was to provide a fertile source of data for theories of reading, and led to a long-lasting collaboration with John C. Marshall. Newcombe's research was funded by the Medical Research Council until her retirement in 1990, when she set up the Russell-Cairns Head Injury Unit with the Radcliffe Infirmary, Oxford, using funds from her medico- legal work. A list of her scientific papers is available on Google Scholar.  Personal life  In 1971 Newcombe married David Ellis, who died in 1981. In 1994 she married Sir Bryan Cartledge, then Principal of Linacre College. She took formal retirement in 1996. Obituaries can be found in Neuropsychologia and The Psychologist.

A columnist for the liberal Russian paper New Times, Viktor Shenderovich. The young center-left independent politician; Maria Gaidar. The passionate leader of the RPR-PARNAS party; Ilya Yashin. The unofficial leader of the radical communist group, the Vanguard of Red Youth; Sergei Udaltsov. The Bolshevik opposition-party leader; Maxim Gromov. The former adviser to President Vladimir Putin; Andrei Illarionov. The editor-in-chief of the popular dissident website Pravda Beslan; Marina Litvinovich. The former police officer and politician for 'Putin's Party,' United Russia; Anatoly Yermolin. The Moldovan investigative journalist for the Russian magazine New Times; Natalya Morar, and human rights activist Vissarion Aseev. Events * Taking place a year before the presidential election scheduled on March 2, 2008, the St. Petersburg march also came a week ahead of the local elections of the Saint Petersburg Legislative Assembly. The protest was organized by The Other Russia, a broad umbrella group including both left and right-wing opposition leaders; including the far-left Vanguard of Red Youth and its leader Sergei Udaltsov, with the National Bolshevik Party and its leader Eduard Limonov; as well as center-right 'liberals' such as former world chess champion and United Civil Front leader Garry Kasparov, and former Prime Minister of Russia and People Democratic Union leader Mikhail Kasyanov. Those of the Twelve not already listed were among the masses of journalists and unaffiliated civilians taking part in the assembly. Despite widespread support, the large numbers garnered by the protestors, and the initial 'success' of the first march; when more marches were planned for 14 April, in Moscow, and 15 April, in St. Petersburg, local and state police were prepared for the protestors, quickly overwhelming and arresting the resistance. Analysis * Despite distinctly different backgrounds, all twelve individuals became allies during their participation in the historic Dissidents March 2007. The March was purposefully and peacefully in violation of increasingly restrictive laws forbidding political demonstrations. Although each of the Twelve had their own personal reasons for taking part in the march, they also shared in the conviction that under Vladimir Putin the Russian government was (and is) becoming increasingly totalitarian, autocratic, and repressive. As a book published less than a decade ago, Panyushkin provides critical and essential insight for students of Russian history into the deteriorating democracy of post-Soviet Russia. If there is an underlying theme or message in 12 that Don't Agree, it is one of knitting together a tattered tapestry made up of the disjointed and oftentimes contradictory patchwork of different people and ideas, to unite them all under the common cause of democracy, and the sacred duty of tyrannicide for the preservation of liberty.

Churches =St Andrew's Presbyterian Church= St Andrew's Presbyterian Church, 149 Goondoon Street, Gladstone Central, 2014 Foundation stone of original St Andrew's Presbyterian Church laid 1867 St Andrew's Presbyterian Church is located at 149 Goondoon Street on the corner of Bramston Street. This is the second church built on this site. A Presbyterian minister, Alexander Proudfoot, arrived in Gladstone in September 1865; he was the first religious leader in Gladstone. However, for two years, there were not sufficient funds to build a church until a generous donation of ¬£200 was received from a local settler. The church was designed by Mr Ramsay, the town surveyor in Maryborough. The foundation stone of the first church was laid on 30 October 1867 by Mrs Proudfoot, wife of Rev. Proudfoot. The brick Gothic church to accommodate 250 worshippers were built by local contractors, Smith, Hay and Day, at a cost of ¬£457; it could accommodate 250 worshippers. In April 1870 W. S. Robertson donated a marble font which he designed and executed using marble from his own quarry on the Calliope River. This was the first church to be built in Gladstone. Still the only religious leader in Gladstone, Alexander Proudfoot died on 11 April 1873 aged 42 years in Rockhampton (where he had been taken for medical treatment as Gladstone had no doctor). His widow established a ladies' school in Rockhampton 4 months later. The Rev. A. A. Laing took charge of the parish from 8 February 1874. Rev. Laing was replaced by Rev. J. Blaine in June 1875. The church was destroyed by a cyclone on 2 March 1949. On 11 September 1955, the Governor of Queensland, Sir John Lavarack laid the foundation stone for the new St Andrew's church. The original foundation stone, font and pulpit were recovered from the demolished church and were incorporated into the new church. =Our Lady Star of the Sea Catholic Church= Our Lady Star of the Sea Catholic Church, 2014 Our Lady Star of the Sea Catholic church is located on the south-west corner of Goondoon and Herbert Streets. It has an adjoining school. It is the third Catholic church to be built in Gladstone. The first Catholic church in Gladstone was St Mary's Church in Auckland Street. It was opened on 1 March 1874 by the Rev. Dean Murlay, but did not have a resident priest until 1885. However, in 1902, the land was resumed to build a new railway line between Gladstone and Rockhampton. A site of bounded by Goondoon Street, Herbert Street and Glenlyon Road was purchased with a plan to build a precinct to eventually comprise a church, a school, a convent and a monastery. The monastery would serve as both a presbytery and a sanitorium for missionaries working in the Pacific islands. The architects for the new church and school were Eaton and Bates; the builders were Robinson & Freeman. The new church was opened on 19 January 1902 by the Bishop of Rockhampton, Joseph Higgins. A larger church was required to meet the growing parish, leaving to the current church being built in 1924 at a cost of ¬£2700. The foundation stone was laid on 13 April 1924 by the Bishop of Rockhampton, Rev. Joseph Sheil. It was officially opened on 16 November 1924. The second church continued to be used as part of the school. In the cyclone of 2 March 1949, the convent and school were destroyed but the church survived.

Domingo and Intramuros of Sta. Rosa, is an old two-storey Spanish barracks building in Santa Rosa, Laguna in the Philippines. It is currently used as the headquarters of the Special Action Force of the Philippine National Police.  Profile  The bastion is strategically located in Brgy. Sto Domingo, Santa Rosa, Laguna near the municipality of Silang. It is named after St. Dominic, a Dominican saint and founder of the Dominican order which owns the lands around Santa Rosa, Bi√±an and Calamba. The whole cuartel is built across an 8.2 hectare stretch of land. Its walls are made up of adobe stones. Some of the interior walls inside were part of the ruins of the old fort. Watchtowers are not presently used since the building is covered with huge trees.  History  The fort was built in 1877 as headquarters of the guardia civil against tulisanes or bandits. Standing close to Silang, its adobe walls were built to protect the town, particularly the Dominican haciendas of Santa Rosa and Bi√±an, from tulisanes coming from Cavite. During the revolution, it served as headquarters of the Spaniards led by Gen. Jose Lachambre against the army of Gen. Emilio Aguinaldo from Cavite in 1897. The fort also served as a refuge for women from Cabuyao and Calamba to protect them from being abused by the Japanese Imperial Army and transformed as a center of commerce during the Japanese occupation. It was used by the Philippine Army from 1957 to 1990 and since 1992 has been used by the Philippine National Police.  The Fort today  The fort was declared a National Historical Landmark by the National Historic Institute (now National Historical Commission of the Philippines) under NHI Resolution No. 3, series 2005 on July 21, 2005. A marker was unveiled on September 20, 2005 Currently, the fort serves as the headquarters and training camp of the Philippine National Police's Special Action Force and as a detention center for many big-time political detainees such as former President Joseph Estrada, Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) chair Nur Misuari, Sen. Gregorio Honasan and PDAF Scam Queen Janet Lim Napoles. Since it now served as prisoners of high-profile detainees, the cuartel is off-limits to the public. The use of the fort as a detention facility was strongly opposed by Laguna First District Representative Dan Fernandez.  Management  Since 2000, the people of Santa Rosa through an organization called Kilusan Cuartel de Santo Domingo have \\"wanted to return the fort to the Local Government Unit of Santa Rosa from the ownership of the military and the police\\". Laguna First District Representative Dan Fernandez also appealed to Congress that the government unit owns it and not the military nor the police.''

It contained infantry, cavalry and artillery units. Background Before the reign of Maharaja Ranjit Singh the armies in Punjab were consisting purely of cavalry. As Ranjit Singh became the Sardar of Sukerchakia Misl The tried to unify with his conquests most of the Punjab. With clever diplomacy and many battles he gradually unified most of Punjab under him. However the Afghans, The British and the Gurkhas were still a very big threat, while his empire was still in its infancy. Therefore, in 1805, he started recruiting regular forces and employing East India Company deserters as officers or soldiers. This didn't went very well as most of these deserters were constantly in touch with the British. The British where alarmed with the rapid conquests of Ranjit Singh and sent many diplomatic missions to help the Phulkian sardars from a possible conquest of their lands and check the growing power of the Sikh Sovereign. A Muslim regiment under Charles Metcalfe, 1st Baron Metcalfe was sent to Amritsar for talks with the Maharaja. The soldiers created noise through their chants as they approached Ranjit Singh‚Äôs fort in Amritsar and passed near the Golden Temple and caused an irregular detachment of Nihang guards to inquire about the disturbances during prayer, before they were challenged by the Muslim soldiers who fired upon them. The Sikh Nihangs shot off many Musket and matchlock volleys rather than a sword charge. It resulted in the death of many of Metcalfe's escorts, while others were wounded. This impressed Ranjit Singh and left a deep impact on him, as the Nihangs had quickly adopted the line formations of Metcalfe's escorts and then shot off their volleys. The Maharaja then accepted The Treaty of Amritsar (1809), and saw the British as allies for the moment as he took the British refusal to engage after the assault on Metcalfe's convoy as well as the Sikh army's frequent unanswered incursions and attacks south of the Sutlej on British army officers in Ludhiana as signs of weakness on the British's part. Formation It was the Maharaja Ranjit Singh who started to hire European officers to train and command parts of his army. It started in 1805 and continued to grow until 1839. Infantry Ranjit Singh was fully aware of the importance of infantry. The task of recruitment in this army had started after 1805, which continued throughout his reign. In the beginning, the number of Sikhs in this army was nominal. The reason being that the Sikhs looked down upon infantry. Therefore, in the beginning, Ranjit Singh recruited some Pathans and Gurkhas in this section of his army. Afterwards, owing to Ranjit Singh's efforts, Sikhs too began to join it. In 1822, he employed General Jean-Baptiste Ventura to train the infantry in western pattern. Under his guidance, the infantry became the most disciplined army of within a few years. By 1838-1839 the strength of the infantry had risen to 45,000. It was divided into battalions, companies and sections. Each battalion consisted of 800 soldiers. It was put under a Commandant. Each battalion was divided into eight companies. Each company was put under a Subedar. Each company was divided into 4 sections. Each section consisted of 25 soldiers. It was put under a Jamadar. The Fauj-i- Khas, was also part of the Fauj-i-Ain. It consisted of the elite soldiers of the Sikh Khalsa Army. It had a separate emblem and harsh training. Cavalry SIkh Khalsa cavalry at the Battle of Sobraon The second most important part of the army was cavalry. In order to organize it on western lines, Ranjit Singh appointed General Jean-Francois Allard. Under his command, the cavalry became very strong. In 1838‚Äì39, the overall strength of the cavalry was 10,000. The cavalry was divided into regiments. Each regiment consisted of 250 to 600 cavaliers. The regiments were further divided into risalas (corps). Each Risala consisted of 150 to 250 cavaliers. The officers and other non- combatants of cavalry were similar to those of infantry. The pay of the cavalry was, however, higher than that of the infantry. Artillery Fauj-i- Ain Sikh Artilleryman Ranjit Singh I was fully aware of the importance of artillery in the modern warfare. Therefore, he paid a special attention to the development of artillery in 1810. In 1812 he employed General Claude Auguste Court and Colonel Alexander Gardner in 1832 and organized Topkhana-i-Khas. Under their able guidance the artillery made matchless progress in a few years. Maharaja Ranjit Singh divided his artillery into four categories: * Topkhana-i-Fili: Heavy cannons pulled by elephants * Topkhana-i-Shutri consisted of those guns which were pulled by camels. * Topkhana-i-Aspi consisted of light guns pulled by horses * Topkhana-i-Gavi consisted of medium cannons pulled by oxen The artillery was divided into batteries or deras. Each battery consisted of 10 guns and 250 gunners. Each battery was under a commandant. The batteries were further divided into sections. Each section compromised 2 guns and 8 to 10 gunners. Each section was under a Jamadar. The entire artillery was under a General. In 1838-39, the strength of the Sikh artillery was 182 heavy cannons, 20 Howitzers, and 60 light cannons. It had at least 5,000 gunners.

The early medieval British Isles lacked the sophisticated trade in essential foodstuffs that had supported the urban economies of Roman Britain, and which would be necessary to support large agriculturally unproductive households remaining static in a single location. Kings and their entourages therefore constantly toured the subdivisions of their kingdoms, staying at networks of royal properties where they could expect to be supported by the territory's inhabitants. In the words of historian Thomas Charles-Edwards: \\"it made much more sense to take a royal household to the food than the food to the royal household\\". Food renders were distinct from the tribute that Kings extracted from other subjugated kingdoms. Food renders consisted of the varied range of foodstuffs that constituted a balanced diet and were consumed within the donor's territory. If the King or members of his household did not visit the donor was freed from his obligations for the year. Kings did not routinely travel through subjugated kingdoms, however, and tribute extracted from such areas often took the form of livestock that could easily be transported to the dominant kingdom. The late 7th century laws of Ine of Wessex list the food render expected of an estate of ten hides as \\"10 vats of honey, 300 loaves, 12 ambers of Welsh ale, 30 ambers of clear ale, 2 full-grown cows or 10 wethers, 10 geese, 20 hens, 10 cheeses, a full amber of butter, 5 salmon, 20 pounds in weight of fodder, and 100 eels.\\" Grazing would also have been made available for visitors mounts. Customary food renders in England declined through the twelfth and thirteenth centuries as currency became more readily available. Eel-rents, however, were collected in large numbers at least through the fourteenth century, and in smaller numbers throughout the later Middle Ages. The last active eel rents appear in records from the seventeenth century.

He kept his royal compound in Waipi'o Valley. Lƒ´loa was the firstborn son of Kiha-nui-lulu-moku, one of the noho ali ªi (ruling elite). He descended from HƒÅna-la ªa-nui. Lƒ´loa's mother Waioloa (or Waoilea), his grandmother Ne ªula, and his great-grandmother La ªa-kapu were of the  ªEwa ali ªi lines of Oahu.

Their names were Kaunuamoa, Makaoku, Kepailiula, and (by Kiha's second wife Hina-opio) Hoolana. Hoolana's descendants were the Kaiakea family of Molokai, from whom Abraham Fornander's wife Pinao Alanakapu was descended. Lƒ´loa had two sons: his firstborn, HƒÅkau, from his wife Pinea (his mother's sister); and his second son,  ªUmi-a-Lƒ´loa, from his lesser-ranking wife, Akahi-a-Kuleana.

Gbowee talked about how Adeleye-Fayemi, as head of AWDF, had supported the women's peace movement in Liberia in its infancy, saying: \\"We crave change, but wait for someone to come and save us. Most times, our reluctance to creating change and acting accordingly means that we don't change perception about us. But, Bisi, you have helped us to achieve change. You have used your position to sew dreams and show that change is possible and helped to set our minds to it. That I won the Nobel prize is because of people like you. That day, you didn't see me.

Officially called Spj√¶r√∏y kirke, the church was built in 1889 and is part of the Fredrikstad Domprosti (rural deanery), Diocese of Borg.  History  In the 1880s, the increasing population in Hvaler had brought about the need to either expand the existing Hvaler church or construct a new building to accommodate the growing number of church-goers. In May 1887, the plan to construct a new granite church in Dypedal was approved by the municipal officials. The design was made by Architect Jacob Wilhelm Nordan, while the construction was supervised by master mason Peder Emanuelsen Utengen from Kirke√∏y. In May 1889, the cornerstone was laid and in July 1891 Bishop Carl Peter Parelius Essendrop dedicated the church.  Architecture and interiors  The church building was built primarily of granite derived from a nearby mountain. The church interior was originally maintained in a dark brown color, but after several decades until the present is maintained in white, dark red and blue. The church's chancels has three stained glass windows‚Äîdesigned by Rolf Klemetsrud and Ivar Johansen in 1951‚Äîportray the Lamb and Cross, the Resurrection and a pelican. The church bell was cast by Anders Riise of T√∏nsberg in 1837. The altarpiece, which at first was a huge white Christian cross set on a dark background, was replaced in 1941 with an altar painting by Alfhild B√∏rsum Johnsen from Kirke√∏y. The partition in the pulpit, which has four reliefs depicting the Four Evangelists, was sculpted by Sverre Johnsen. In 1965, a new organ was installed in the church, which was manufactured by the J.H. J√∏rgensen Organ Co. of Oslo. The church had been renovated several times since its dedication, first in 1941 for its 50th Anniversary, then in 1958, and the latest in 1991 for its 100th Anniversary.  Cultural heritage  Aside from its inherent religious nature, Spj√¶r√∏y Church is also considered as a historical monument and is included in the Norwegian Directorate for Cultural Heritage database, No. 85531. Key historical and current aspects of the church were discussed in a chapter of a book written by Thorkildsen.

Synopsis Five years after being attacked at knifepoint by his wife, Yehuda Kaminka returns to Israel from the United States in order to divorce her. The novel follows the lives of individuals in the Kaminka family, including Naomi (Yehuda's institutionalized wife), and the couple's adult children (Tsvi, Asa, and Ya'el), among others. Each of the children's lives is fraught with peril: Asa, a university lecturer in Jerusalem, is caught in a sexless marriage with the aspiring writer Dina, Tsvi spends his days in Tel Aviv lamenting over his relationship with his father and using his middle-aged homosexual lover, and Ya'el, the couple's daughter, is married to a widely- disliked lawyer. The novel, like Yehoshua's debut novel The Lover, is told from a first-person point of view, with each chapter from the view of a different character, and explores themes of unfulfilled romance, Jewish diaspora, social crises, and generational estrangement.

It was the last of several attacks made by the Home Fleet during 1944 which sought to damage or sink Tirpitz and thereby eliminate the threat it posed to Allied shipping. Previous raids on Kaafjord conducted by Fleet Air Arm aircraft had involved only one air attack; in Operation Goodwood several attacks were made in a single week. The Royal Navy hoped that these raids would wear down the formidable German defences. The British fleet departed its base on 18 August and launched the first raid against Kaafjord on the morning of 22 August. The attack failed, and a small raid that evening inflicted little damage. Attacks were conducted on 24 and 29 August and were also failures. Tirpitz had been hit by two bombs during the raid on 24 August, but neither caused significant damage. British losses during Operation Goodwood were 17 aircraft to all causes, a frigate sunk by a submarine, and an escort carrier badly damaged. German forces suffered the loss of 12 aircraft and damage to 7 ships. In late August 1944, responsibility for attacking Tirpitz was transferred to the Royal Air Force. In three heavy bomber raids conducted during September and October 1944, the battleship was first crippled and then sunk. Historians regard Operation Goodwood as a significant failure for the Fleet Air Arm and attribute its results to the shortcomings of the force's aircraft and their armament.  Background  From early 1942, Tirpitz posed a significant threat to the Allied convoys transporting supplies through the Norwegian Sea to the Soviet Union. Stationed in fjords on the Norwegian coast, the battleship was capable of overwhelming the close-escort forces assigned to the Arctic convoys or breaking out into the North Atlantic.Ellis (1999), pp. 294‚Äì295 To counter this threat, the Allies needed to keep a powerful force of warships with the British Home Fleet, and capital ships accompanied most convoys part of the way to the Soviet Union.Bennett (2012), p. 9Faulkner and Wilkinson (2012), p. 109 Aerial photo of Tirpitz moored in Kaafjord Several air and naval attacks were launched against Tirpitz in 1942 and 1943. On 6 March 1942, torpedo bombers flying from the aircraft carrier attacked the battleship while she was attempting to intercept Convoy PQ 12 but did not achieve any hits.Bennett (2012), p. 11Bishop (2012), pp. 78‚Äì83 Bombers from the Royal Air Force and Soviet Air Forces also attempted to strike Tirpitz in her anchorages several times in 1942 and 1943 but failed to inflict any damage. On 23 September 1943, two British X-class midget submarines penetrated the defences around the battleship's main anchorage at Kaafjord in northern Norway during Operation Source, and placed explosive charges in the water beneath her. This attack caused extensive damage to Tirpitz, putting her out of service for six months.Woodman (2004), p. 340 Following Operation Source, the task of attacking Tirpitz was assigned to the Home Fleet's aircraft carriers. Following months of preparations, a successful attack (Operation Tungsten) involving two strike forces of 20 Fairey Barracuda dive bombers escorted by 40 fighters was conducted on 3 April 1944. While Tirpitzs crew suffered heavy casualties during this operation, the battleship was not badly damaged.Bennett (2012), pp. 14‚Äì17 Nevertheless, she was placed out of action for several additional months while repairs were completed.Garzke and Dulin (1985), p. 267 The Home Fleet initiated a further four raids against Tirpitz between April and July 1944, though the battleship was only attacked during the last of these operations. These attacks were hindered by the transfer of many of the Home Fleet's airmen to other units following Operation Tungsten, as the replacement aircrew were less experienced.Zetterling and Tamelander (2009), p. 283 The first raid (Operation Planet) began on 21 April, but it was cancelled three days later when agents stationed near Kaafjord reported bad weather over the target area. The Home Fleet put to sea to attack Tirpitz again in mid-May in what was designated Operation Brawn.Zetterling and Tamelander (2009), p. 280Bishop (2012), p. 310 A strike force of 27 Barracudas escorted by Vought F4U Corsair and Supermarine Seafire fighters took off from the carriers and Victorious on 15 May, but returned to the ships without attacking after they encountered heavy clouds over Kaafjord.Brown (1977), p. 36 The next raid, Operation Tiger Claw, was initiated in late May but cancelled due to bad weather on the 28th of the month. The subsequent attack (Operation Mascot) was timed for mid-July, before the resumption of the Arctic convoys, which had been suspended since April 1944 to free up ships for the Normandy landings.Tarrant (1994), p. 129 The strike force of 44 Barracudas and 40 fighters dispatched on 17 July reached the target area, but found Tirpitz cloaked in a protective smokescreen and the attack failed to inflict any damage on the battleship.  Preparations  In the weeks after Operation Mascot, Tirpitz continued to prepare for potential combat operations. Following trials in the sheltered waters of Altafjord, she put to sea on 31 July and 1 August to train with her protective destroyers. Additional smoke generators were also installed around Kaafjord to improve the area's already strong defences.Bishop (2012), p. 311 These activities were reported by spies, and the British Admiralty interpreted them to mean that Tirpitz was being readied for a raid against Allied shipping. To defend against this threat, it was decided to conduct further attacks against the battleship at her anchorage in Kaafjord at the time of the next series of Arctic convoys.Sweetman (2000), p. 78 In reality, the German Navy was not planning to use Tirpitz offensively as she would be very vulnerable to the superior Allied naval and air forces if she put to sea. Instead, the battleship was being maintained in active service to tie down Allied warships and aircraft.Bishop (2012), pp. 316‚Äì317 The failure of Operation Mascot convinced the commander of the Home Fleet, Admiral Sir Henry Moore, that the Fleet Air Arm's main strike aircraft, the Fairey Barracuda dive bomber, was not suited to operations against Kaafjord. As the dive bombers' slow speed gave the defenders of Kaafjord enough time to cover Tirpitz in a smoke screen between the time incoming raids were detected and their arrival over the target area, Moore concluded that further attacks using these aircraft would be futile. However, the Admiralty judged that repeatedly striking Kaafjord with Barracudas over a 48-hour period might wear down the German defences and exhaust the supply of fuel for Tirpitzs protective smoke generators. Consideration was also given to flying fast and long-ranged de Havilland Mosquito bombers off the carriers in an attempt to achieve surprise, but none of these land-based aircraft could be spared from supporting the Allied bombing of Germany. Despite his misgivings, Moore agreed to make another attempt to strike Tirpitz.Roskill (1961), p. 156 As proposed by the Admiralty, Moore's plans for the new attack on Kaafjord involved the Home Fleet's aircraft attacking the region over several days. While the fighter aircraft involved in the previous raids had used only their machine guns to strafe German defences in order to reduce the threat they posed to the Barracudas, it was decided to use some of these aircraft as dive bombers during Operation Goodwood. In preparation, the two squadrons of Corsairs and a single squadron of Grumman F6F Hellcats selected to participate in the attack received training in dive-bombing tactics during the period between Operations Mascot and Goodwood. Another new element of the plans was a decision to use Fleet Air Arm aircraft to drop mines near Tirpitz and the entrance to Kaafjord. The mines dropped near the battleship were to be fitted with time- delay fuses, and it was hoped that the explosions of these devices would cause Tirpitzs captain to try to move the warship into safer waters and pass through the minefield at the fjord's entrance.Zetterling and Tamelander (2009), pp. 282‚Äì283Brown (1977), p. 37 During the period before Operation Goodwood, the Home Fleet's flying squadrons conducted training exercises using a target range at Loch Eriboll in northern Scotland; the terrain in this area is comparable to that around Kaafjord, and the loch had also been used for this purpose as part of the preparations for Operation Tungsten.Sweetman (2000), p. 79Bishop (2012), p. 297  Opposing forces  The Operation Goodwood attack fleet was divided into three groups. Admiral Moore embarked on board the battleship , which sailed with the fleet aircraft carriers (the flagship of Rear Admiral Rhoderick McGrigor, commander of the 1st Cruiser Squadron), and Furious, as well as two cruisers and fourteen destroyers. The second force comprised the escort carriers and , cruiser and a group of frigates. A pair of fleet oilers escorted by four corvettes sailed separately to support the two attack groups.Roskill (1961), p. 159 The aircraft carriers embarked the largest group of Fleet Air Arm aircraft assembled up to that point in the war. Their main striking element was the 35 Barracudas assigned to 820, 826, 827, and 828 Naval Air Squadrons which operated from the three fleet carriers. The two units of 6 Naval Fighter Wing, 1841 and 1842 Squadrons, flew 30 Corsairs from Formidable. A total of 48 Seafires were assigned to 801, 880, 887 and 894 Squadrons on board Indefatigable and Furious. In addition, 1770 and 1840 Squadrons operated 12 Fairey Firefly and 12 Hellcat fighters respectively from Indefatigable. The two escort carriers embarked a total of 20 Grumman TBF Avengers (which had responsibility for the mine-dropping element of Operation Goodwood) and 8 Grumman F4F Wildcat fighters; these aircraft were split between 846 Squadron on board Trumpeter and 852 Squadron on Nabob.Brown (2009), p. 24 Tirpitzs anchorage at Kaafjord was heavily defended. Prior to Operation Tungsten, eleven batteries of anti-aircraft guns, several anti- aircraft warships and a system of smoke generators capable of hiding Tirpitz from aircraft were located around the fjord.Tactical, Torpedo and Staff Duties Division (Historical Section) (2012), pp. 135, 151 After the attack, additional radar stations, and observation posts were established and the number of smoke generators was increased. Tirpitzs air defences were strengthened by fitting her with additional cannons, modifying the guns so they could be used to attack aircraft, and supplying anti-aircraft shells for her main guns. The German Air Force (Luftwaffe) had few fighters stationed at airfields near Kaafjord, and their operations were constrained by a lack of fuel.Bennett (2012), p. 14Tactical, Torpedo and Staff Duties Division (Historical Section) (2012), p. 135  Attacks  = 22 August = HMS Nabob after being torpedoed on 22 August The Operation Goodwood attack force sailed on 18 August. The timing of the operation was set to allow the Home Fleet to also protect Convoy JW 59, which had departed from Scotland on 15 August bound for the Soviet Union. After an uneventful journey north, the attack forces arrived off Norway on 20 August. While the first attack against Kaafjord had been planned to take place on 21 August, weather conditions that day were unsuitable for flying operations, and Moore decided upon a 24-hour postponement. The Germans were first alerted to the presence of the British fleet on 21 August when radio messages from the carriers were detected.Hinsley et al. (1988), p. 277 The first strike against Kaafjord was launched on 22 August. While flying conditions were poor due to low cloud, Moore decided to attack that day as some of his ships were starting to run low on fuel and would soon need to move away from Norway to refuel.Sweetman (2000), p. 80 At 11:00 am a force comprising 32 Barracudas, 24 Corsairs, 11 Fireflies, 9 Hellcats and 8 Seafires was launched from the three fleet carriers.Brown (1977), p. 38 No Avengers were dispatched as the cloudy conditions were unsuitable for the execution of their task. Because few mines were available and the Avengers could not safely land while still carrying these weapons, the mine-dropping element of the plan would fail if the aircraft were unable to locate Tirpitz and had to dump their loads into the sea. As the strike force neared the coast, heavy cloud was sighted covering the hills near Kaafjord. Because the clouds prevented accurate bombing, the Barracudas and Corsairs returned to the carriers without attacking. The Hellcat and Firefly fighters continued on, and approached the fjord below the cloud base.Tarrant (1994), p. 134 These aircraft achieved surprise, and Tirpitz was not obscured by smoke when they arrived over Kaafjord. The Fireflies initiated the attack at 12:49 pm by strafing German anti-aircraft guns on and around Tirpitz. Two minutes later nine Hellcats attacked the battleship with bombs but did not achieve any hits. As the strike force returned to the carriers it destroyed two of Tirpitzs seaplanes in Bukta harbour and badly damaged the submarine U-965 at Hammerfest. At Ing√∏y, north of Hammerfest, three Hellcats strafed a German radio station. The attack set the station's buildings ablaze and damaged the aerials. The eight Seafires made diversionary attacks on the Banak area and a nearby seaplane base, destroying five German seaplanes. Three British aircraft were lost during the attack on the morning of 22 August; one Hellcat and a Seafire were shot down, and one of the Barracudas was forced to ditch into the sea during its return flight. After the strike force was recovered, much of the Home Fleet sailed away from the Norwegian coast to refuel. A group comprising Formidable, Furious, two cruisers and several destroyers set a course for the two fleet oilers, and the escort carrier group withdrew so that the carriers could refuel their escorts. At 5:25 pm, Nabob was struck by a torpedo fired from U-354. The carrier suffered serious damage and 21 fatalities but was able to continue limited flight operations.Brown (2009), p. 28Wragg (2005), p. 135 Shortly afterwards U-354 torpedoed the frigate as the latter searched for Nabobs attacker.Roskill (1961), p. 160 Nabob was forced to return to the Home Fleet's base at Scapa Flow that evening, escorted by Trumpeter, a cruiser and several destroyers. Formidable and Furious covered their withdrawal; during this period Furious also refuelled from the Home Fleet's tankers. The departure of both escort carriers meant that the mine- dropping component of Operation Goodwood had to be cancelled. Bickertons stern was wrecked by the torpedo, and she could have potentially been salvaged. However, the force's commander did not want to have to protect two crippled ships, and the frigate was scuttled at around 8:30 pm on 22 August.Brown (1990), p. 120 Shortly after the attacks on Nabob and Bickerton, Seafires from 894 Naval Air Squadron shot down two German Blohm & Voss BV 138 reconnaissance aircraft. During the evening of 22 August, a force of eight Fireflies and six bomb-armed Hellcats from Indefatigable raided Kaafjord again.Polmar (1969), p. 310 This was the first in what was intended to be a series of small harassing attacks conducted to wear down the German defences. German forces did not detect the aircraft before they arrived over Kaafjord at 7:10 pm, and the Fireflies' strafing attacks on German gun positions killed one member of Tirpitzs crew and wounded ten. However, the Hellcats' bombs failed to inflict any damage on the battleship. The British fighters also attacked German ships and radar stations on their return flight, damaging two tankers, a supply ship, and a patrol boat. No British aircraft were lost during this raid.Roskill (1961), p. 171 = 24 August = Fog caused the cancellation of Indefatigables flying operations on 23 August, including a planned diversionary attack against German shipping in Langfjord. The other two carriers and their escorts rejoined Moore and Indefatigable off Norway during the morning of 24 August. While conditions that day were initially foggy, the weather cleared enough in the afternoon to permit a strike against Kaafjord.Sweetman (2000), p. 81 The attacking force comprised 33 Barracudas carrying armour-piecing bombs, 24 Corsairs (including 5 armed with a 1,000-pound [450 kg] bomb), 10 Hellcats, 10 Fireflies and 8 Seafires. In an attempt to achieve surprise, the aircraft flew off from the carriers from a point further to the south of those used in previous raids. The strike aircraft then flew parallel to the coast, before making landfall and approaching Kaafjord from the south. A German radar station detected the force at 3:41 pm, and immediately alerted Tirpitz. A Barracuda landing on HMS Furious at the conclusion of one of the attacks on Tirpitz during Operation Goodwood The British attack began at 4:00 pm. It was initiated with attacks on German gun positions by the Hellcats and Fireflies, which were flying five minutes ahead of the Barracudas and Corsairs. Tirpitzs protective smokescreen was not fully in place at the start of the raid, but by the time the Barracudas and Corsairs arrived she was completely covered by smoke. As a result, these aircraft had to blind bomb the ship, releasing their weapons from altitudes between .Tarrant (1994), p. 135 Only two bombs hit Tirpitz. The first was a weapon dropped by a Hellcat that exploded on the roof of her \\"Bruno\\" main gun turret. The explosion destroyed the quadruple anti-aircraft gun mount located on top of the turret, but did not cause any significant damage to the turret itself. The second bomb to strike the ship was a armour- piercing weapon which penetrated through five decks, killed a sailor in a radio room and lodged near an electrical switch room. This bomb failed to explode, and German bomb disposal experts later determined that it had been only partially filled with explosives. The German report on the attack judged that if the bomb had gone off it would have caused \\"immeasurable\\" damage.Garzke and Dulin (1985), p. 268 British fighters also attacked other German ships and facilities in the Kaafjord area, damaging two patrol boats, a minesweeper and a radar station, as well as destroying an ammunition dump and three guns of an anti-aircraft battery. Tirpitzs last remaining Arado Ar 196 seaplane was attacked in Bukta harbour and damaged beyond repair.Brown (1977), p. 39 Four Corsairs and two Hellcats were shot down during the raid, and the battleship's crew suffered 8 fatalities and 18 men wounded. Casualties among the anti-aircraft units stationed around Kaafjord were heavy.Sweetman (2000), p. 83 At 7:30 pm on 24 August, a pair of Fireflies conducted a photo- reconnaissance sortie over Kaafjord to gather intelligence on the results of the attack; their presence caused the Germans to generate a smoke screen over the fjord and fire an intensive anti-aircraft barrage. In a separate action that day, U-354 was sunk off Bear Island by Fairey Swordfish operating from the escort carrier which was escorting Convoy JW 59.Woodman (2004), p. 401 The German command at Kaafjord judged that the attacks on 24 August had been \\"undoubtedly the heaviest and most determined so far\\", and requested that fighter units be transferred from northern Finland to bolster the area's defences. Due to the other demands on Germany's fighter force at this time, the request was turned down on 26 August by the Luftwaffes headquarters.Sweetman (2000), pp. 82, 84 Gales and fog prevented the British from conducting further attacks between 25 and 28 August.Bishop (2010), p. 313 On 25 August Indefatigable, Formidable, two cruisers and seven destroyers refuelled from the oilers. Both of the cruisers later detached from the force and returned to Scapa Flow. Duke of York, Furious, a cruiser and five destroyers also sailed to the Faroe Islands to load supplies. Before leaving the fleet, Furious transferred two Barracudas and a pair of Hellcats to Indefatigable. As the elderly Furious was judged to be no longer capable of combat operations, she proceeded from the Faroe Islands to Scapa Flow with the cruiser and several destroyers. On 29 August Duke of York and the remaining destroyers rejoined the main body of the Home Fleet off north Norway. During this period, the flying squadrons' maintenance personnel worked to repair aircraft which had been damaged during the 24 August attacks.Sweetman (2000), p. 82 Convoy JW 59 completed its journey on 25 August, with most of its ships docking at Kola in northern Russia. The convoy had been repeatedly attacked by U-boats from 20 to 24 August, and its escorting warships and aircraft sank two submarines. All of the merchant vessels arrived safely, with the only Allied loss being the sloop which was torpedoed and sunk by U-344 on 21 August.Woodman (2004), pp. 400‚Äì403 = 29 August = British sailors moving bombs along the deck of an aircraft carrier prior to \\"bombing up\\" Barracudas for one of the raids conducted during Operation Goodwood The final attack of Operation Goodwood was made on 29 August. The strike force comprised 26 Barracudas, 17 Corsairs (of which two were armed with 1,000-pound [450 kg] bombs), 10 Fireflies and seven Hellcats. Seven Seafires also conducted a diversionary raid on Hammerfest. In an attempt to give the bombers accurate aiming points once the artificial smokescreen was generated around Tirpitz, four of the Hellcats were armed with target indicator bombs. The aircraft began launching at 3:30 pm. The British aircraft failed to achieve surprise. German radar stations had been tracking the Home Fleet's routine anti- submarine and fighter patrols, and the Seafires were detected at 4:40 pm when they were from Kaafjord. In response to this report, the smoke generators around Kaafjord were activated and the fjord's defenders went to their battle positions. The arrival of the main body of British aircraft over Kaafjord was delayed by stronger than expected winds and a navigational error, and they did not reach the target area until 5:25 pm. By this time Tirpitz was covered in a very thick smokescreen, and none of the British airmen sighted the ship. The Barracudas and Corsairs were forced to blind-bomb Kaafjord, and while no hits were achieved on the battleship, six members of her crew were wounded by bomb fragments from near misses. German ships and gun positions were once again strafed by the fighters, but no significant damage was inflicted. Heavy anti- aircraft gunfire from Tirpitz, which was directed by a party of observers stationed on a mountain near Kaafjord, shot down a Corsair and a Firefly. Following the raid on 29 August, the Home Fleet sailed west to cover Convoy RA 59A which had sailed from northern Russia on 28 August bound for the UK. Due to fuel shortages, Indefatigable and three destroyers detached later that day to return to Scapa Flow and Formidable with two destroyers followed 24 hours later. Duke of York and six destroyers remained on station in the Arctic Sea until 11:00 am on 1 September when the convoy was judged to be safe from attack.Sweetman (2000), p. 85 Overall, Fleet Air Arm casualties during Operation Goodwood were 40 airmen killed and 17 aircraft destroyed. Nabob was also judged to be beyond economical repair, and was withdrawn from service. On the German side, Tirpitz suffered only superficial damage.  Aftermath  A New Zealand airman who flew from HMS Formidable and was killed during Operation Goodwood is interred at the Commonwealth War Graves section of Troms√∏'s main cemetery. Following the 29 August raid, the British learned from Ultra signals intelligence that Tirpitz had not sustained any significant damage during Operation Goodwood.Bennett (2012), p. 19 In public statements the Royal Navy claimed to have damaged or sunk 19 German warships during the attacks on Kaafjord, but did not report damage to Tirpitz. During the final days of Operation Goodwood, Royal Navy planners decided not to order further Fleet Air Arm operations against Kaafjord. The planners accepted that the Germans were now able to cover Tirpitz in smoke before Barracudas could reach the battleship, and these aircraft could not carry bombs large enough to inflict heavy damage. Further consideration was given to attacking Kaafjord using Mosquitos launched from aircraft carriers, but the light bombers continued to be in short supply and it was judged that they were not well suited to the task. Moreover, there was a growing need to transfer the carriers to the Pacific to strengthen Britain's contribution to the war against Japan.Zetterling and Tamelander (2009), p. 285Bishop (2010), p. 317 As Tirpitz was still considered a threat to shipping, the British Chiefs of Staff Committee and the Supreme Allied Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Force, General Dwight D. Eisenhower, decided in late August to conduct further attacks against her using Royal Air Force heavy bombers.Zetterling and Tamelander (2009), pp. 285‚Äì286 On 15 September, a force of Avro Lancasters attacked Kaafjord after refuelling at bases in northern Russia and inflicted irreparable damage on the battleship. Following this raid she sailed to an anchorage near Troms√∏ to be used as an immobile coastal defence battery. Another heavy bomber attack on 29 October caused only minor damage. In a third raid mounted on 12 November Tirpitz was struck by several Tallboy bombs and capsized, sinking with heavy loss of life.Bennett (2012), pp. 19‚Äì21 Historians have judged Operation Goodwood to have been a failure. Writing in 1961, the British official historian Stephen Roskill stated that the attacks marked the end of a \\"series of operations whose results can only be classed as intensely disappointing\\", and concluded that the possibility of sinking Tirpitz had been \\"remote\\" due to the shortcomings of the Barracudas and their armament.Roskill (1961), pp. 160‚Äì161 Similarly, Norman Polmar argued in 1969 that Operation Goodwood was \\"perhaps the most striking failure of the F.A.A. (Fleet Air Arm) during World War II and can be directly attributed to the lack of effective aircraft ‚Äì the Barracudas were too slow and could not carry large enough bombs to make effective attacks\\". More recently, Mark Llewellyn Evans judged the results of Operation Goodwood to have been \\"pathetic\\", and Mark Bishop concluded that \\"the Fleet Air Arm's greatest operation of the war ... ended in failure\\".Evans (1999), p. 132  References  = Footnotes = = Citations = = Bibliography =       *  External links  * Category:Aerial operations and battles of World War II Category:Naval aviation operations and battles Category:Naval battles and operations of World War II involving the United Kingdom Category:Naval battles of World War II involving Canada Category:Military operations of World War II involving Germany Category:Alta, Norway Category:1944 in Norway Category:August 1944 events Category:Conflicts in 1944 ","title":"Operation Goodwood (naval)"},{"id":"43116933","text":"Simmons-Harth House, also known as the Simmons-Harth-Gantt House, is a historic home located at Lexington, Lexington County, South Carolina.

Set during the Cold War, the film tells the story of lawyer James B. Donovan, who is entrusted with negotiating the release of Francis Gary Powers‚Äîa U.S. Air Force pilot whose U-2 spy plane was shot down over the Soviet Union in 1960‚Äîin exchange for Rudolf Abel, a convicted Soviet KGB spy held by the United States, whom Donovan represented at trial. The name of the film refers to the Glienicke Bridge, which connects Potsdam with Berlin, where the prisoner exchange took place. The film was an international co-production of the United States and Germany. Bridge of Spies was shot under the working title of St. James Place. Principal photography began on September 8, 2014, in Brooklyn, New York City, and the production proceeded at Babelsberg Studios in Potsdam. The film was released by Touchstone Pictures on October 16, 2015, in the United States and distributed by 20th Century Fox in other countries. It was a box office success, grossing $165 million worldwide, and was praised for its screenplay, Hanks and Rylance's performances, Spielberg's direction, Thomas Newman's musical score, and the production values. The film received six Academy Award nominations including Best Picture and Best Original Screenplay, and won Best Supporting Actor for Rylance.  Plot  In 1957 New York City, Rudolf Abel is arrested and charged with spying for the Soviet Union. Insurance lawyer James B. Donovan is appointed to defend Abel, so that Abel's trial will be seen as fair. Committed to the principle that the accused deserves a vigorous defense, he mounts the best defense of Abel he can, declining along the way to cooperate in the CIA's attempts to induce him to violate the confidentiality of his communications with his client. Abel is convicted, but Donovan convinces the judge to spare Abel the death penalty because Abel had been serving his country honorably, and he might prove useful for a future prisoner exchange; Abel is sentenced to 30 years. Donovan appeals the conviction to the Supreme Court based on the lack of a search warrant for the seizure of Abel's ciphers and photography equipment. For his principled stand Donovan and his family are harassed, including shots being fired at their home. The conviction is upheld. In 1960, Gary Powers, a pilot in the CIA's top secret U-2 spy plane program, is shot down over the USSR. He is captured and sentenced in a show trial to ten years confinement, including three years in prison. Donovan receives a letter from East Germany, purportedly sent by Abel's wife, thanking him and urging him to get in contact with their lawyer, whose name is Vogel. The CIA think this is a back-channel message hinting that the USSR is willing to swap Powers for Abel. They unofficially ask Donovan to go to Berlin to negotiate the exchange; he arrives just as the Berlin Wall is going up. Crossing in to East Berlin, he meets with a KGB officer in the Soviet Embassy and is then directed to Vogel, who represents the Attorney General of the German Democratic Republic (GDR) (East Germany). The Attorney General seeks to swap Abel for an American graduate student named Frederic Pryor, who had been arrested in East Germany; in the process the GDR hopes to gain official recognition by the United States. The CIA wants Donovan to disregard Pryor but he insists that both Pryor and Powers be swapped for Abel. In a message to the Attorney General he bluffs that they will either release Pryor with Powers or there will be no deal. The exchange of Powers and Abel takes place at the Glienicke Bridge, with Pryor to be released simultaneously at Checkpoint Charlie. Tension builds as Pryor fails to arrive. The CIA, still primarily concerned with Powers, tell Abel he can go, but he refuses to move. It is confirmed that Pryor has been released, and the exchange takes place. The next day, back in the United States, the government publicly acknowledges Donovan for negotiating the deal that rehabilitates his public image.  Cast   Production  = Development = Bridge of Spies is an American-German co-production based on a script written by Matt Charman and the Coen brothers. Studio Babelsberg co-produced and oversaw production services for the film.

His arrest and history were discussed by Truman Capote, another Heights resident at the time, in his book A House on the Heights. Charman became interested in Donovan's story after reading a footnote about him in An Unfinished Life: John F. Kennedy, 1917‚Äì1963. After meeting with Donovan's son in New York City, Charman pitched the story to several studios and DreamWorks bought it. Studio co-founder Steven Spielberg became interested in the film and decided to direct. Marc Platt and Kristie Macosko Krieger attached themselves as producers along with Spielberg. Joel and Ethan Coen revised Charman's original script. According to Charman, the brothers \\"were able to really punch up the negotiations on the back end of the movie, then they handed the baton back to me to do a pass after they did their pass, to make the movie just sit in a place we all wanted it to. The flavor they brought is so fun and enjoyable.

Amy Ryan, Alan Alda, Billy Magnussen, and Eve Hewson were reported to star in the film as well. Participant Media co-produced the film. Francis Gary Powers, Jr., founder of The Cold War Museum and the pilot's son, was brought on as a technical consultant and has a cameo in the film. In June 2014, Fox 2000 Pictures agreed to co-finance the film with DreamWorks and Participant Media, with the film's distribution rights being divided between Disney and Fox. During a March 3, 2015, interview with The Daily Pennsylvanian, Platt revealed the title to be Bridge of Spies; it was shot under the working title of St. James Place. The film also received funds of ‚Ç¨3.7 million, from the German Federal Film Fund (DFFF). = Filming = Principal photography began on September 8, 2014, in Brooklyn, New York City. On September 14, filming took place in DUMBO, a Brooklyn neighborhood, where crews transformed Anchorage Street to appear as it did in the 1960s. On September 15, filming took place in Astoria, between Astoria Park and Ditmars Boulevard. Filming was done on 18 Street and 26 Avenue in Astoria, where Spielberg was spotted transforming the 5 Corners Deli into a 1950s grocery store. On September 26, filming took place on 44th Street in Manhattan, as evidenced by crews stationed on 44th Street, between Madison and 6th Avenues. On September 27, Hanks was spotted filming scenes on Wall Street among extras wearing 1960s costumes. On September 28, filming of some day and night scenes took place on the corner of Henry Street and Love Lane in the Brooklyn Heights neighborhood of Brooklyn, where the block was set with vintage cars, street signs, rain machines, and spotlights. On September 29, filming took place on Hicks Street and Pineapple Street, where a shop, Perfect Paws, was transformed into a 1960s dress shop named Brooklyn Pearl, and at the NYS Appellate Division courthouse on Monroe Place and Pierrepont Street. On October 6, Hanks and the crew were spotted on the same location on Hicks Street. The scene in the Court hallway in which Hanks, to Alda's consternation, announces his intention to appeal the guilty verdict, was filmed on the first floor on the Queens County Supreme Courthouse at 88‚Äì11 Sutphin Blvd., Jamaica, New York. In early October, after filming wrapped in New York City, further production began at Babelsberg Studios in Berlin and Potsdam, Germany, and would last there through the end of November. Filming in Berlin began with shooting at the former Tempelhof Airport in October, for scenes that actually took place there, such as Donovan's descending from an historic C-54 Skymaster. The prisoner exchange scene was filmed on the Glienicke Bridge (the so-called \\"Bridge of Spies\\"), where the historical exchange actually took place in 1962. The bridge spans the Havel narrows between Berlin and Potsdam, and was closed to traffic for filming over the last weekend of November. German Chancellor Angela Merkel visited the set to watch the filming of these scenes. Principal photography officially ended on December 4, at Berlin Tempelhof. Shooting also took place in Wroc≈Çaw, Poland, in the second half of November. During mid- December, filming took place at Beale Air Force Base, located near Marysville, California. The film was shot on 35mm motion picture film, including Kodak Vision3 250D Color Negative Film 5207 and Vision3 500T Color Negative Film 5219. File:Glienicker Br√ºcke Film (9).JPGGlienicke Bridge in Potsdam/Berlin during filming File:St. James Place cars.jpgPeriod vehicles on Monroe Place in Brooklyn Heights during filming File:St. James Place filming.jpgSprinklers during filming in Brooklyn Heights = Historical accuracy = Bridge of Spies is based on the real events but the film departs from the historical record, though reviewers have praised the film and argued that such departures are permissible. Commentators have noted that the shortening of timespans in the film at times gives a misleading impression. A certain licence is taken in the depiction of the Berlin Wall; Donovan did not see Berlin wall escapees being shot; those most similar to the ones depicted was the killing of Peter Fechter, the summer after the Powers/Abel exchange on the Glienicke Bridge. The circumstances of Frederic Pryor's detention were not accurately portrayed ‚Äì he could not have crossed a partially built wall and was convicted of obtaining \\"confidential\\" material. Apart from the depiction of the Wall, it is notable that Donovan did not suffer the violence depicted: he was not shot at in his home and he did not have his overcoat stolen. The film also changed the location of Donovan's suggestion to the judge to spare Abel for the sake of a possible exchange, which was made in court. Donovan is presented in the film as a private practice attorney with little connection to the government or its intelligence services. During WWII Donovan served as the general counsel of the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), shortly before it was re-organized as the CIA. Abel, an English-born Soviet intelligence officer (whose real name was William G. Fisher) most likely did his best work for the Soviet Union not as a spy in a dishevelled New York City lair full of radio gear but before and during World War II, when he trained agents and radio operators for clandestine work in German-occupied regions. This training is thought to have been critical to what his mentor, Pavel Sudoplatov, later called one of the most important radio deception operations of the war. There was some controversy over Rylance's decision to portray Abel with a Scottish accent, despite Abel having been born and educated entirely within the Tyneside region of England where Geordie is spoken. Frederic Pryor stated in an interview that various details of the plot related to his involvement were incorrect. He did not cross the Berlin wall during its construction, as he was on vacation in Denmark at the time. He was detained after his return, when he crossed into East Berlin to visit a friend's sister; she had fled to West Berlin using \\"some sort of passport manipulation\\", and her apartment was under surveillance to catch anyone attempting to retrieve its contents. Pryor also stated that the film's depiction of Wolfgang Vogel was unfair. The film depicts Powers' U2 plane being hit by a volley of three SAMs but more than 14 were launched. A MiG-19 fighter that was scrambled to intercept the plane was also shot down by friendly fire during this salvo, killing the pilot Sergei Safronov. The visual blog Information is Beautiful deduced that, while taking creative licence into account, the film was 88.8 percent accurate, calling it \\"pretty damn truthful, reflecting a general trend in Hollywood towards more historically accurate tales\\".  Release  The theatrical poster for the film was released on June 4, 2015, with the first trailer appearing online the following day. It was distributed in North America by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, through the Touchstone Pictures banner. Disney held the film's world premiere on October 4, 2015 at the 53rd annual New York Film Festival. The film went into general theatrical release in the United States on October 16, 2015. 20th Century Fox distributed the film in the remaining international territories. = Home media = The film was released by Touchstone Home Entertainment on Blu-ray, DVD, and digital download in North America on February 2, 2016 and by 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment in other territories.  Reception  = Box office = Bridge of Spies grossed $72.3 million in North America and $93.3 million in other territories for a worldwide total of $165.6 million, against a budget of $40 million. In the United States and Canada, pre-release tracking predicted Bridge of Spies to open to around $15‚Äì20 million from 2,811 theaters. The film opened alongside Goosebumps, Crimson Peak, and Woodlawn on October 16, 2015, facing particular competition from the former, and also from The Martian, which was entering its third week. The film made $500,000 from its early Thursday night showings and $5.3 million on its first day. In its opening weekend, the film grossed $15.4 million, finishing third at the box office behind Goosebumps ($23.5 million) and The Martian ($21.5 million). Its biggest international markets have been Italy ($12.1 million) and United Kingdom (11.0 million). = Critical response = Bridge of Spies received critical acclaim. Richard Roeper of Chicago Sun Times gave the film four out of four stars and praised Spielberg's direction, saying: \\"Spielberg has taken an important but largely forgotten, and hardly action-packed slice of the Cold War, and turned it into a gripping character study, and thriller that feels a bit like a John Le Carre adaptation if Frank Capra were at the controls\\". Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune called the film a \\"a confident, slightly square, highly satisfying example of old-school Hollywood craftsmanship, starring a major movie star brandishing a briefcase, and a handkerchief, rather than a pistol\\". The A.V. Club's Ignatiy Vishnevetsky described it as \\"one of the most handsome movies of Spielberg's latter-day phase, and possibly the most eloquent [...] Bridge of Spies turns a secret prisoner exchange between the CIA and the KGB into a tense and often disarmingly funny cat-and-mouse game\\". On the other hand, Mike Scott of New Orleans Times-Picayune, had a more mixed reaction, saying: \\"Bridge of Spies, with its stop-and-go momentum, is also more merely interesting than it is full-on riveting. It's still quite good stuff, but despite its impressive pedigree... it doesn't feel as if it's quite the sum of all of its parts\\". Preston Jones of Fort Worth Star-Telegram gave the film 2 and a half stars out of five. Jones wrote that \\"For all Spielberg, his star-packed cast, led by Tom Hanks, and his on-screen and off-screen team (Joel and Ethan Coen co-wrote the screenplay) bring to the table, Bridge of Spies is remarkable only for how stuffy and surprisingly inert the film becomes\\". On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a rating of 90%, based on 307 reviews, with an average rating of 7.68/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"Bridge of Spies finds new life in Hollywood's classic Cold War espionage thriller formula, thanks to reliably outstanding work from Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks\\". On Metacritic, the film has a score of 81 out of 100, based on 48 critics, indicating \\"universal acclaim\\". On CinemaScore, audiences gave the film an average grade of \\"A\\" on an A+ to F scale. = Accolades =  Soundtrack  Frequent Spielberg collaborator John Williams was originally announced to compose the film's score. However, Williams had to drop out of production due to a health issue. Per a suggestion by Williams, Thomas Newman was then contacted by Spielberg to replace him, marking Spielberg's first film without Williams' music since 1985's The Color Purple, which was scored by Quincy Jones. Hollywood Records released the film's soundtrack on October 16, 2015.

The brother of one British Prime Minister and nephew of another, his career was built on family connections. His mother was the daughter of a Marquess, and his wife Frances, a noted suffragist, was the daughter of a Duke. Frances's sister in-law was Princess Louise, daughter of the reigning Queen Victoria. Balfour's initial work was on English and Scottish country houses, but he won only one major commission in this field. However, his appointment as surveyor of the Grosvenor Estate in London gave him architectural control over much of Mayfair and Belgravia in the 1890s and 1900s, and the opportunity to design many buildings himself. Balfour was a senior officer of the Volunteer Force in London. His outspokenness on military matters was a factor in his appointment as an aide-de-camp to King Edward VII. A fastidious and somewhat withdrawn individual, Balfour succumbed to alcoholism in his fifties. This brought about his early death.  Early life  Balfour was born at Whittingehame House in East Lothian, the youngest of five sons son of James Maitland Balfour and his wife Lady Blanche Mary Harriet Gascoyne-Cecil, daughter of James Gascoyne- Cecil, 2nd Marquess of Salisbury. His paternal grandfather James Balfour was a nabob who had made the family's fortune as a contractor supplying the Royal Navy in India and became a Tory Member of Parliament (MP), while his mother's father was a Conservative cabinet minister in the 1850s. Her brother, Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Lord Salisbury, was three times Prime Minister before being succeeded in 1902 by Eustace's elder brother Arthur Balfour. Eustace Balfour was educated at Harrow and at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he graduated in 1873. He then studied architecture under Basil Champneys, the designer of Newnham College, Cambridge, before setting up his own practice in 1879, with an office in Addison Road, North Kensington which was also his home until his death. On 12 May 1879 he wed Lady Frances Campbell, the fifth daughter and tenth of twelve children of George Campbell, 8th Duke of Argyll. The couple had met at a ball given in London by Lord and Lady Goschen, and married soon afterwards in St John's Presbyterian Church in London. Frances's father was shocked at their haste. Out of respect for Balfour's mother, who had died in 1878, the wedding was modest, with no formal meal and no honeymoon.  Architecture  Ampton Hall in Suffolk, rebuilt in the 1880s to the design of Balfour & Turner Balfour's first years of architectural practice consisted of small projects for family and friends. These included the restoration of Inveraray Castle for his father-in-law the Duke of Argyll, an extension to his brother Arthur's hunting lodge Strathconan House in Ross- shire, and the church of St Mary Magdalene in the hamlet of Hatfield Hyde. The church, which is now in Welwyn Garden City, was originally known as Hyde Chapel. Built as a chapel of ease within the parish of Hatfield for Balfour's uncle the Marquis of Salisbury, it became the parish church of Hatfield Hyde in 1928. In 1885, Balfour began a professional partnership with Hugh Thackeray Turner, which lasted until Balfour's death. Balfour had been a member of the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings since his undergraduate days in Cambridge, and Turner was the Society's secretary. Together the two men were engaged to rebuild Ampton Hall in Suffolk, which had been destroyed by fire Their design, in a restrained Jacobean style, was Balfour's only major country house commission. Hugh Grosvenor, 1st Duke of Westminster, who employed Eustace Balfour as surveyor of the Grosvenor Estate Work was scarce after Ampton's completion in 1889, and in 1890 Balfour applied for the post of surveyor for the 1st Duke of Westminster's Grosvenor Estate, to succeed Thomas Cundy. He seemed unlikely to be selected, but Frances made a direct approach to the Duke (who was also her uncle), and he got the job. Balfour's social standing appears to have been a significant factor in his appointment. He was the son-in-law of a Duke, nephew of a Marquess, and his wife was the sister- in-law of Queen Victoria's 4th daughter Princess Louise (who had married her oldest brother John in 1871). Balfour had a strong sense of social class, and Frances Balfour later described the 1st Duke of Westminster as having run the estate \\"not as today on commercial lines, but more as a Principality\\". Even so, his brother Gerald's wife Lady Elizabeth Balfour noted that when the surveyor called on the Duke in his professional role he was \\"never offered a chair and never expected one\\". The post involved a lot of design work for Balfour, who seems to have been able to take whatever commissions he wanted, often delegating them to Turner. In the 1890s, Balfour and Turner appear to have been the most prolific designers of private houses on the estate, and in 1892 Balfour was made a Fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects. Their own work included most of the wholly redeveloped Balfour Place in Mayfair, formerly known as Portugal Street and renamed for the architect. Balfour also supervised projects which were contracted to other designers. The Duke favoured the domestic revival style of architecture, and particularly insisted on red brick for dwelling houses. Balfour, who deplored the previously fashionable Gothic revivalism, laid down strict architectural guidelines, sometimes even redesigning the work of others. Belmont, Harrow, a Balfour & Turner design which was moved from its original location in Davies Street, London Balfour and Turner also designed Aldford House on Park Lane, an \\"ornate but stunted\\" free-standing stone mansion for the diamond magnate Alfred Beit which was replaced in 1932 by a modernist apartment block designed by Val Myer. Their other most notable work was St Anselm's Church in Davies Street, believed to have been mostly Turner's work, which was regarded as eccentric. Using an arts and crafts-style blending of influences, it had a plain frontage with a basilican interior, and some gothic tracery. When its demolition was planned in 1938, it was dismissed by H. S. Goodhart-Rendel as \\"a purely personal record of Thackeray Turner's particular tastes\\". However, the building was not in fact demolished. Instead, it was dismantled and reconstructed in altered form at Uppingham Avenue in the north-west London suburb of Belmont as the church of St Anslelm Belmont. The parish describes it as \\"a genuinely recycled building\\". Balfour held the surveyor's post until 1910, when he was succeeded by Edmund Wimperis. His second decade in the role was less significant than the first, because the death in 1899 of the 1st Duke brought the estate a bill for ¬£600,000 in death duties (equivalent to ¬£ in ). The resulting financial pressure meant that little rebuilding occurred until 1906, and when it resumed Balfour's influence was diminished. He had little affinity with the hedonistic young Hugh Grosvenor, 2nd Duke (grandson of the 1st), who Edwin Lutyens and others had persuaded to adopt a less rigid architectural policy.  Volunteer  In 1882, Balfour joined the Volunteer Force in 1882, becoming a Lieutenant in 1883, and Lieutenant-Colonel in command of the London Scottish Regiment of Volunteers from 1894 to 1902. He began to take a wider interest in defence issues, writing extensively on the subject, such as The Conditions and Requirements of the Volunteer Force (1886). In July 1899, as the Second Boer War loomed, Balfour offered to raise a thousand men to go and fight, but it was considered too early to begin that effort. His offer to the minister George Wyndham was ignored by the War Office, and Balfour reacted angrily, complaining that volunteers were \\"expected to be fit for service while we are vigorously debarred from seeing any\\". Eventually 20,000 volunteers were called up and fought in the war. However, Balfour's need to liaise with the 2nd Duke of Westminster, who had just inherited the Grosvenor Estate, prevented him from joining his force when they travelled to South Africa at the end of 1899. He remained in command of the London Scottish until late 1902, when he resigned in protest at financial controls that prevented payments to volunteers if there was an insufficient number of raised troops. On his resignation he was granted the honorary rank of colonel on 1 November 1902, with permission to wear the uniform of the corps in retirement. At the end of December 1902, Balfour was awarded the Volunteer Officers' Decoration. Despite his differences with government, or possibly because of them, King Edward VII appointed Balfour in January 1903 as a military aide-de-camp for Volunteer Forces.  Personal life and family  Eustace and Frances Balfour had five children: * Blanche Elizabeth Campbell Dugdale (1880‚Äì1948), a biographer of her uncle the Prime Minister Arthur Balfour, and later a noted Zionist * Francis Cecil Campbell Balfour (1884‚Äì1965), who became a colonial Governor in Sudan in the 1920s * Oswald Herbert Campbell Balfour (1894‚Äì1953), Military Secretary to the Governor- General of Canada, 1921‚Äì23 * Joan Eleanor Campbell Balfour (died 1939) * Alison Catherine Campbell Balfour (died 3 September 1955) Accounts of their marriage diverge widely. Frances's congenital hip dislocation left her in constant pain, and often irritable. The couple's temperament and interests were opposites, Frances's enthusiasm for politics and intellectual company contrasting with her husband's lifelong passion for shooting and his later interest in the military. Hartley writes that theirs was \\"not a particularly happy marriage\\". Knox confirms this view, noting that neither Blanche Dugdale's memoirs nor Frances Balfour's autobiography write much about their relationship with Eustace, and that Frances wrote at length about his brother Arthur whom she \\"far preferred to Eustace\\". Author Joan B. Huffman is more cautious, noting that crucial sources are unavailable since Frances destroyed all Eustace's letters to her. However, Huffman records that she did support her husband when his sister Alice repeatedly challenged him over his drinking.  Death  Balfour's drinking problem became serious around 1906, and in 1909 his health began to deteriorate seriously. In December 1910 he returned to Whittingehame, where he died aged 56 at 6 am on 14 February 1911, surrounded by his family. Eustace was the third of the five Balfour brothers to die relatively young, Cecil and Francis having both been killed in accidents in the early 1880s. Balfour was buried at Whittingehame, with his parents and grandparents. Frances survived him by 20 years (until 1931), and was buried alongside him. Rudyard Kipling, a member like Balfour of the Savile Club in London, described him as \\"a large, loveable man, and one of the best of talkers\\".

Direct Provision () is a system of asylum seeker accommodation used in the Republic of Ireland. The system has been criticised by human rights organisations as illegal, inhuman and degrading, while proponents argue that it ensures asylum seekers are housed and cared for, in accordance with international law. The system, operated by the Reception and Integration Agency (RIA) of the Department of Justice and Equality, provides asylum seeker residents with accommodation free of charge and a small allowance. Asylum seekers in Direct Provision are usually entitled to state- funded medical care, and children have full mainstream access to the education system.  History  Direct Provision was originally introduced as an emergency measure in 1999. In 2002 there were almost 12,000 applications for asylum. At the start of 2014, there were 4,360 people in direct provision, with more than 3,000 people having been in the system for two or more years. At the same time, there were more than 1,600 people who have spent five or more years in direct provision. There were 5,096 men, women and children, including 801 families, living in the 34 direct provision centres across 17 counties in Ireland by the end of December 2017. Human rights concerns The length of time people spend in Direct Provision has been criticised by human rights watchdogs, with the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission calling the delays faced by asylum applicants as \\"systemic and pernicious.\\" In CA v. Minister for Justice and Equality and others, a claim was made that Direct Provision was \\"inhuman and degrading\\", asserting that the system is illegal under both the Irish Constitution and the European Convention on Human Rights, and all other international human rights conventions that Ireland has subscribed to. This case was vigorously defended by the State on all grounds, including on the basis that it fulfills Ireland's obligations, that it is broadly in line with (and in many cases better than) the situation in other EU states, and that at a time of competing calls for finite resources, it was not feasible for the State to grant the right to work, access to full social welfare and access to the public housing and/or rent supplement to asylum seekers. Delivering his judgement on 14 November 2014, Justice Colm Mac Eochaidh found against the appellants on the substantive point of \\"inhuman and degrading treatment\\", but struck down the rules at that time regarding unannounced room inspections; the sign-in requirement; the requirement to notify intended absence; the rules on visitors and the lack of an independent complaints procedure. Court judgement of Justice Colm Mac Eochaidh Those points were subsequently addressed. RIA House Rules and Procedures 2017 The Irish Government's Special Rapporteur on Child Protection, Dr. Geoffrey Shannon, has called it \\"institutionalised poverty\\". As of March 2019 adults receive ‚Ç¨21.60 per week and children ‚Ç¨21.60. Some centres have cooking facilities, but the majority have canteen style eating halls. These have been criticised both for the quality of food, and for the attitude of the canteen workers when it comes to accommodating specific dietary needs. Many child asylum seekers have been sent here alone while some are born into the direct provision life and that is all they have ever known. In June 2014, there were more than 1,000 asylum cases waiting to be heard in the High Court. The Irish Refugee Council has reported that young people living in Direct Provision centres are more prone to depression and suicide, and in the case of three young people in particular, aged between 11 and 17, stated \\"for different reasons, these three young people have all expressed the view that they can‚Äôt see the purpose of living.\\" According to responses to parliamentary debates and the RIA, the majority of adults in Direct Provision have had their initial asylum applications rejected and are either appealing this or seeking to remain in Ireland under other criteria. On October 31, 2018 Donnah Sibanda Vuma asked staff at the Direct Provision centre in Knockalisheen where she resided for bread and milk for her sick child. The staff refused and told her that they had strict instructions not to give any food outside of canteen hours. The Department of Justice and Equality said that the Reception and Integration Agency said it was because of a miscommunication involving a new staff member. The Department of Justice described what happened as \\"regrettable\\". Donnah Vuma was living at the centre with her children for four years and had previously criticised Direct Provision centres for refusing to allow residents to use cooking facilities. In 2020, Direct Provision was widely criticised as not conducive to the COVID-19 restrictions on social distancing, self-isolating, and cocooning for those living in its Centres. In particular groups have highlighted the impact on children when there is no access to outdoor or leisure spaces, and the shared facilities with numerous other residents. Some advocacy groups such as Movement of Asylum Seekers in Ireland have been involved in Black Lives Matter protests and demonstrations in Ireland highlighting the treatment of people of colour in Direct Provision. Taoiseach Leo Varadkar responded by commenting that there was no direct comparison between the deaths of black people in the United States and the experiences of those living in Direct Provision.  Health and healthcare  In the Direct Provision system, refugees seeking asylum in Ireland have access to medical cards (which are also allocated to low income individuals in Ireland). These cards allow individuals to receive their medical care and prescriptions for free. However, because many asylum seekers experience mental health conditions and concerns in addition to any health problems they may have, researchers recommend that asylum seekers in DP have access to a multidisciplinary healthcare team overseeing their care. Asylum seekers are more likely to experience certain mental health conditions than the general population. A 2009 paper from the Irish College of Psychiatrists stated that migrants and asylum seekers in Ireland are 10x more likely to suffer from PTSD, and 3x more likely to suffer from psychosis. 53% of asylum seekers in Direct Provision reported having been tortured before their arrival in Ireland. People in DP also experience a variety of stressors that are not as prevalent in the general population including: legal status, a feeling of not being able to parent properly (due to lack of employment and inability to provide transportation for their children), not being able to have a job, uncertainty about involuntary transfers, language barriers, not being able to have access to food at a time when the canteen is not open, nutritional status of the food that is prepared for them, discrimination, and separation from their families or family members. Irish psychologists have stated the DP system is elongating the period of traumatic experiences for people in Direct Provision. Owing to the environment at Direct Provision centres, children living in DP are more likely to experience problems related to overcrowding. It has been reported that children in DP are more likely to present with burns and stress-related illnesses than children in the general Irish population. Additionally, due to a combination of poverty, deprivation, social isolation, and a stressful environment at home, children and adolescents in DP are likely to experience poor mental health. Children in DP experience social isolation due to strict meal times, inability to participate in extracurriculars, visitors being banned from DP centres, and lack of transportation to and from friends‚Äô homes. There have also been reports that children in DP experience social isolation due to stigma, racism, and bullying. Children who are alone and bored as many in DP are, are more likely to experience depression, and it is possible that children developing in a trauma-filled environment will experience cognitive impairment. Children need an environment that is both physically and emotionally safe in order to excel. Health professionals have argued that an environment with inadequately trained professionals and staff, physical abuse, lack of supervision of children, and close contact of many families with young children to unfamiliar adults is not the safe environment that children need. Room sharing and close contact in Direct Provision puts asylum seekers and staff at risk of contracting COVID-19. Many asylum seekers reported that they found it difficult to follow social distancing measures when sharing amenities like rooms and bathrooms with non-family members. Additionally, because people in Direct Provision who are able to work often work low-income jobs with conditions that are less than ideal for social distancing (such as meat packing plants), workers and the other people in their DP centres are at higher risk for contracting highly communicable illnesses. DP sites in Kildare and Cahersiveen have demonstrated how quickly contagious illnesses such as the COVID-19 virus can spread when many people in a small centre are in close contact.

Geographic distribution  B. ingae is endemic to Brazil, where it occurs in all regions of the country. The species' type locality is Lagoa do Sombrio (Sombrio lagoon) in Sombrio, Santa Catarina.  Description  B. ingae has a small shell, rarely reaching in length. The aperture is oval. The apex is rounded, not recurved, with a smooth apical depression. The protoconch shows a band of radially arranged punctuations after the smooth apical area. The radial lines on the teleoconch are curved and may cover the whole shell. In some specimens the periostracum forms rounded protuberances on the radial lines. The right anterior muscular impression is longitudinally elongated, the left anterior one rounded and the posterior one elongated-oval shaped. The mantle shows no pigmentation. The radula has a slightly asymmetric rachidian tooth with two main cusps and a minor cusp between them and two to four accessory cusps laterally. The marginal teeth are elongated, with four to seven lateral cusps to the ectocone.  Habitat and ecology  B. ingae (like all the other species in the genus Burnupia) lives in well-oxygenated freshwater habitats, especially on stones in streams and at the edges of lentic water bodies.

The walls of the nave of the present church are all that remains of this edifice. The church was successively enlarged and rebuilt until it received its present form in the middle of the 14th century. Internally, the church is decorated with different sets of murals, dating from the end of the 13th century and the 15th, the latter by the Master of the Passion of Christ.

The Trophy was presented to the Gosforth Road Club by Rex Beaumont who was a local cycle wholesaler on Tyneside. The Gosforth Road Club had been created in July 1951 as an offshoot of the Ridley Cycling Club as a result of young riders being unable to gain entry into local races. The race was run under BLRC Regulations from 1952 until 1959 when it came under the regulations of the newly formed British Cycling Federation. It has been run continuously since 1952 and is the longest-running road race in the UK. In the early 1950s the race started and finished in Gosforth Park where the clubhouse was situated. In the early '60s, the start/finish moved to Ponteland because of an increase in traffic. Race distances were normally 85‚Äì90 miles and the route was out and back finishing at Cottage Homes, Ponteland. In the early 1980s the start/finish moved to the west of Newcastle but this did not last long. In the mid-'80s the race moved to Stamfordham where it has remained ever since. When it became a Premier Calendar event followed by it becoming a UCI 1.2 and then part of the National Road race series the distance increased to over 100 miles and started to use a circuit that normally incorporated the Ryals. Full details of its history can be viewed on the website of the Gosforth Road Club, www.gosforthroadclub.com. The race became part of the Cyclone Festival of Cycling in 2007 as a British Cycling Premier Calendar Race. In 2011 it was the Men's British National Championships won by Bradley Wiggins; the Festival also ran the Women's National Road Race Championships won by Lizzie Armistead. The Beaumont Trophy was again the Men's National Road Race Championships in 2018 and was won by Connor Swift. Over the period of time the race has been held, it has used a number of different routes.

At a local theatre Kruh/Circle in the arts centre she acts, sings, writes, portrays friends. Her daughter Marketa was born in 1965, but marriage broke down and was divorced. In 1964 she submitted application for membership in the Czech Artists Association (CSVU) and during the Prague spring she grabbed opportunity to study abroad. In 1967 she was admitted to the Berlin University of the Arts (HfBK) in West Berlin, in the sculptor class of Prof. Joe Henry Lonas. She completed studies in master class in 1973. Since then, she had been working as a freelance sculptress in Berlin. Here she met her husband Rainer-Maria Seefried, received German nationality and decided to live in Germany. In the 1990s Ludmila Seefried-Matejkov√° was a founding member of the K√ºnstlersonderbundes-Realism in Germany in Berlin (1990) and of the international arts association PRO ARTE VIVENDI in Berlin and Mari√°nsk√© L√°znƒõ (1998). The projects are supported by the Czech Embassy in Berlin and the Deutsch Tschechischen Zukunfts-Fonds. In 1994 she became member of the Darmst√§dter Sezession in Darmstadt. She had several individual exhibitions in Germany and elsewhere in Europe. Seefried- Matƒõjkov√° lives and works in Berlin and Malcesine.  Works  On the edge, polychrome polyester, wood (1976-77) Ludmila Seefried-Matejkova studied figure sculpture under Prof.Marie Uchytilova-Kucova in Prague. She was able to look into the abstract form under Prof. Joe Henry Lonas. Her sculptures from this period were stylized anthropomorphic or bioform constructions in plaster. She soon realized that abstraction limits her possibilities of expression and returned to the figure sculpting. The hyper-realistic, life-size polyester figure‚Äù Hanna‚Äù (final work for master class at the HfBK 1973) marked out future direction of her sculptural works. The effect of her figural sculptures was often intensified by environment installations: Scream 1976, On Edge 1977, Outside the Door 1980 and others. Since 1980 she has returned to classic materials: clay, stone and wood. She takes her subjects from life around her, the city with its variety of human characters and their fates, the social differences to the fringes of society. A series of heads/busts of different characters, mainly in terracotta, were the Turkish Woman 1983, Homeless 1990, Cunning Stockbroker and Girl at the Exhibition 1996 and others. Her sculptures based on reality were transformed portraits of real people from everyday life, interpreted by the artist into her own sculptural language: Beggar Woman 1997, Underground 2001-2 and others. The sculpture Father\`s Hat 1995 is a self- portrait. Metro, polychrome terracotta (2001‚Äì02) Struck by her childhood and early youth experiences, she often depicts pain, violence and aggression as important themes in her work. She employs expressive symbols: Scream 1976, Strangling 1985, Homo homini lupus 1992/93, and Seed of Hatred 1993. The world of the human soul with its silent dramas such as self-torment, anxiety and loneliness (Solitude 2004) as well as internal experiences, self-awareness such as contemplation and meditation are equally reflected in her works: Catharsis 1979, Meditation 1980 and 2002. Her summer works in stone and wood were created in her Italian studio. The subjects are party biblical or influenced by her reading: Job 2003, Resurrection 2008, Ophelia 1997, Kafka/Metamorphosis 2000, Somnambulist 2013 and others. Drawings were always an important part of Ludmila Seefried-Matejkova's works ‚Äì from sketches in pubs, underground trains or on the beach to portraits and studies of people, mainly in pencil, charcoal, pastel or pen-and-ink. As a representative of realism, which has quite a tradition in Germany, Ludmila Seefried-Matejkova was successful in several Kunst am Bau competitions Justice 1984, Double- Admiral 1985, The Dance on the Volcano 1988 and several other sculptural objects in the cityscape of Berlin.

It was a 1974 nominee of the Nebula Award for Science Fiction. The novel is the last book in Anderson‚Äôs Polesotechnic League series. However, since the setting of the book is many generations after the series' two main characters, Nicholas van Rijn and David Falkayn, and many generations before Anderson's follow-up series, the Terran Empire; it is more proper to consider this book a bridge between the two series. Synopsis The People of the Wind is a story of the clash of two very different cultures living on a planet named Avalon. One culture consists of people who trace their ancestry to Earth and can thus be considered human. They have created a highly organized and complex society. The other culture is made up of winged creatures that have remained ‚Äòas free as the wind.‚Äô Despite the unlikelihood of such two different groups forming a unified society, they indeed created a single nation composed of the best of both races. Unfortunately the two groups are forced into a war, and the population of Avalon is forced to choose a side to support. Unless they choose they are going against both. Awards * 1974 Hugo Science Fiction Award nominee * 1974 Locus Award Nominee * 1974 Nebula Award Nominee Publication information The People of the Wind was first published in 1973.

Background  At the beginning of the Second World War the territory of Sand≈æak was a subject of territorial aspirations of all sides in the war. The Muslims wanted this region to be annexed to the Usta≈°e controlled Independent State of Croatia which pursued a genocidal policy toward Serbs, Jews and Roma People. On the other hand, the Germans designated it to be a part of their occupation zone, Italians wanted to control all of Sand≈æak while Albanians wanted it to be annexed to their Greater Albania. The Chetniks and Partisans struggled to keep Sand≈æak within Yugoslavia. Based on the agreement of July 1941, Sjenica was included in the Italian governorate of Montenegro. Hasan Zvizdiƒá was a wealthy Muslim whole- trader in Sjenica. He became a city governor and armed many local Muslims and organized them as militia during the war. In December 1941 Zvizdiƒá refused to allow Partisans to capture Sjenica because he was afraid that Chetniks, German and Italian forces would attack Partisans in Sjenica and kill many of its population as well. He explained to Partisans that he has around 5,000 members of Muslim militia under his command and that he will used them against Partisans or Chetniks if they try to capture Sjenica. According to historian ≈Ωivkoviƒá, Zvizdiƒá was actually concerned that his lucrative contracts to supply Italian and German army with livestock would be cancelled if Partisans capture the city.  Armed forces  The Partisan military units that attacked the town belonged to the 2nd Takovo Company commanded by Tadija Andriƒá, part of the Belgrade Company and part of the Serbian-Sand≈æak Company commanded by Vladimir Kne≈æeviƒá and Petar Stamboliƒá. The staff of the Belgrade Company was against the attack on Sjenica, but was outvoted. On 23 November the Partisans captured and executed several Chetnik commanders near Nova Varo≈°. This action compromised the Partisans in the eyes of many Serbs from Sjenica who developed animosity toward them. As a result, many Serbs from Sjenica joined forces of the town's militsiya to defend the town from the Partisans.  Battle  The attack on Sjenica began on 22 December 1941, in 4:30 a.m. The temperature was and snowdrifts were about 1 meter. The Partisans attacked the town from three directions. Initially, the Belgrade company managed to penetrate the town and capture its center. The Partisans faced with strong gunfire in period between 8 and 10 a.m. and even hot water thrown at them from the windows of the houses. The Belgrade company managed to retreat from the town only after 11 a.m. and reached Nova Varo≈° only on 23 December because they were carrying four heavily wounded Partisans. The remaining two groups failed to fulfill their tasks because they were easily repelled back to the town's periphery. On the same day the forces of Muslim militia from Prijepolje, commanded by Paƒçariz, and from Sjenica commanded by Zvizdiƒá successfully repelled the attack of Partisans who tried to capture Sjenica. They were supported by one company from German controlled Tutin, commanded by D≈æemail Koniƒçanin, who joined them based on invitation of Zvizdiƒá. Communist casualties included Andrija Tadiƒá, the commander of the 2nd Takovo company.  Aftermath  Josip Broz Tito criticized Partisan attack on Sjenica which, according to his position, was against direct order of the supreme command and Communist Party.

The event took place on September 23, 2014, in Okayama at the Convex Okayama. The event featured ten matches, three of which were contested for a championship. It was the ninth event under the Destruction name. Due to Ustream getting out of the PPV business, Destruction in Okayama was the first NJPW PPV in two years that was not available through the promotion's largest international internet pay-per- view provider. Storylines Destruction in Okayama featured ten professional wrestling matches that involved different wrestlers from pre-existing scripted feuds and storylines. Wrestlers portrayed villains, heroes, or less distinguishable characters in the scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. Originally announced top matches of the event saw Time Splitters (Alex Shelley and Kushida) defend the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship against Suzuki-gun representatives El Desperado and Taichi and Kazuchika Okada defend his certificate for an IWGP Heavyweight Championship match at Wrestle Kingdom 9 in Tokyo Dome against Karl Anderson. Okada earned the certificate by winning the 2014 G1 Climax in August. During the tournament, he suffered two losses, one of which was against Anderson. The card was revamped on September 8 with the addition of two more title matches. In the first Tencozy were set to defend the NWA World Tag Team Championship against Manabu Nakanishi and Yuji Nagata. The match came as a result of Nagata challenging Tencozy after he and Nakanishi had defeated the champions in a non-title main event on September 7. The second, which was originally announced as a non-title match, would feature Yujiro Takahashi defending the NEVER Openweight Championship against Yoshi- Hashi. This change came as a result of Yoshi-Hashi leading the Chaos stable to a win over their rival Bullet Club stable in a ten-man elimination tag team match on September 5, scoring the last elimination over Takahashi. Event In the first title match of the event, the Time Splitters made their second successful defense of the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship against El Desperado and Taichi. Post-match, the champions were challenged by both the Forever Hooligans (Alex Koslov and Rocky Romero) and The Young Bucks (Matt Jackson and Nick Jackson). Before the next match, NJPW played a vignette, where National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) president Bruce Tharpe announced that the NWA World Junior Heavyweight Champion Chase Owens would be taking part in NJPW's King of Pro-Wrestling event on October 13. After the video had ended, Bushi entered the ring to request a title match against Owens. The second title match saw Tencozy make their fourth successful defense of the NWA World Tag Team Championship against the team of Manabu Nakanishi and Yuji Nagata. In the third and final title match of the event, Yoshi-Hashi failed in his second attempt at a championship win in two days, when Yujiro Takahashi defeated him to make his first successful defense of the NEVER Openweight Championship. Afterwards, Takahashi was confronted by Yoshi-Hashi's stablemate, the previous NEVER Openweight Champion Tomohiro Ishii. In the semi-main event, Hiroshi Tanahashi and Tetsuya Naito defeated Bullet Club's IWGP Heavyweight Champion A.J. Styles and IWGP Tag Team Champion Doc Gallows. Following the match, Styles accepted Tanahashi's challenge for an IWGP Heavyweight Championship match between the two. In the main event of the evening, Kazuchika Okada successfully defended his Tokyo Dome IWGP Heavyweight Championship challenge rights certificate against Karl Anderson. Following his win, Okada named Tetsuya Naito, the other man who had defeated him during the 2014 G1 Climax, as his next challenger.

Nakamura had defeated Fale during the 2014 G1 Climax, taking himself to the finals and eliminating Fale from the tournament. On September 8, NJPW announced that a match between Bullet Club's Doc Gallows and Karl Anderson and Chaos' Kazuchika Okada and Yoshi-Hashi would be contested for the former's IWGP Tag Team Championship, instead of being the non-title match it was first announced as. This came as a result of Yoshi- Hashi leading Chaos to a ten-man elimination tag team match win over Bullet Club on September 5, after which he challenged Yujiro Takahashi to a match for his NEVER Openweight Championship, while Okada added his own IWGP Tag Team Championship challenge to Gallows and Anderson. Event The event featured several matches in the ongoing storyline rivalry between the Chaos and Bullet Club stables, including the opening six-man tag team match, where Chaos' Alex Koslov, Rocky Romero and Tomohiro Ishii defeated Bullet Club's Matt Jackson, Nick Jackson and Yujiro Takahashi. Also featured during the event was Toru Yano's rivalry with his former partner Takashi Iizuka, which had also branched into a rivalry between Yano's new partner Kazushi Sakuraba and Iizuka's Suzuki-gun stablemate Minoru Suzuki. During the event, the two teams faced off in a tag team match, where Yano cheated his way to a win over Iizuka. The first title match of the event saw Ryusuke Taguchi defeat Kushida to win the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship for the second time in his career and first time in seven years, becoming the 69th champion. Following the match, Taguchi and Kushida shook hands, before they were attacked by the Suzuki-gun trio of El Desperado, Taichi and Taka Michinoku, building up an IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship match between Kushida and Alex Shelley, the Time Splitters, and El Desperado and Taichi at Destruction in Okayama. In the second title match, Bullet Club's Doc Gallows and Karl Anderson made their sixth successful defense of the IWGP Tag Team Championship against Chaos' Kazuchika Okada and Yoshi-Hashi, after Yujiro Takahashi interfered to attack his upcoming NEVER Openweight Championship challenger Yoshi-Hashi. The event also featured two big singles match between some of NJPW's top heavyweights. In the matches, Togi Makabe and his tag team partner Hiroshi Tanahashi defeated Hirooki Goto and his tag team partner Katsuyori Shibata, respectively. Following his win, Tanahashi announced he was ending his one- year-long self-imposed exile from the IWGP Heavyweight Championship picture and was now looking to get a shot at Bullet Club's reigning champion A.J. Styles. In the main event of the show, Chaos' Shinsuke Nakamura defeated Bullet Club's Bad Luck Fale to regain the IWGP Intercontinental Championship, winning it for the record-setting fourth time. Reception Dave Meltzer of the Wrestling Observer Newsletter called the match between Hiroshi Tanahashi and Katsuyori Shibata a \\"must-see\\", writing \\"[i]t crossed the line for me as far as stiffness goes, and kind of bugs me because Tanahashi is smart enough to know the pitfalls of that kind of a match and following it. But as far as what they did when it comes to doing a simulated fight, it was incredible\\". The match was eventually given a rare five-star rating by Meltzer.

It is used to put the earnings of a breeding animal's progeny into proper perspective. Method The average earnings index measures the earning power of a stallion or mare's offspring by comparing the average earnings of a given horse's progeny with all other runners of the same age that raced in the same country in a given period of time. The average is stated as a value of 1.00. The AEI is calculated for each year a horse has offspring racing and can be averaged for all years that horse has had first generation descendants on the track. The AEI can be used for additional comparisons, such as the composite AEI of a sire or damsire based on all of his progeny. Another way it is used is to compare stallions from one generation to the next, because it compensates for the changing value of currency over time. Development The AEI was developed in 1948 by Joe Estes of The Blood-Horse magazine. It originally could only be used to calculate numbers for sires and, beginning in the 1950s, broodmare sires. It was only with the addition of computer power beginning in the 1970s and 1980s that a full analysis of mares could be added to the equations and determine the AEI for various crosses. Criticism Although considered by some an industry standard, the AEI is criticized as easily skewed by the influence of a single exceptional horse in a given year and favors horses that throw \\"durable types\\" of horses that have multiple starts in a given year, including at lower-level races. Examples A stallion's career AEI can be found by looking up the pedigree of any of their offspring in The Jockey Club's online pedigree database, equineline.com. The AEI figures for various leading American sires are: * Bold Ruler (leading sire from 1963-1969 and 1973) ‚Äì 7.86 * Nasrullah (1955, 1956, 1959, 1960) ‚Äì 5.81 *Alydar (1990) ‚Äì 5.11 * Nijinsky ‚Äì 4.49 * Bull Lea (1947-9, 1952-3) ‚Äì 4.37 * Northern Dancer (1971, 1977) ‚Äì 4.11 * Danzig (1991-3) ‚Äì 3.93 * Mr. Prospector (1987-8) ‚Äì 3.91 * Storm Cat (1999, 2000) ‚Äì 2.95 * Halo (1983, 1989) - 2.91 * A.P.

The remains of the fort are in the center of Utrecht, Netherlands, which takes its name from the fort. History In the Roman Empire Traiectum was one of the forts in the lower Limes Germanicus defensive lines. The Emperor Claudius defined the Rhine downstream from Bonn as the western part of the frontier. He ordered the legions further north to withdraw to this line, which was fortified in AD 47\\\\. The Rhine divides into several branches in the Netherlands. The army chose the branch on which modern Utrecht lies as the frontier. In AD 69-70 Gaius Julius Civilis led the revolt of the Batavi during which the fort was burned. One soldier or officer buried his savings of fifty gold coins at this time. They were found by archaeologists below the layer of burned wood. Once the Romans had restored their authority in the region they rebuilt the fort, again in wood. The fort was manned by about 500 troops. From tile stamps it appears that from AD 88-89 until 275 the fort was manned by ', an auxilia infantry cohort of the Imperial Roman army. The castellum of Traiectum seems to have been finally destroyed some time before 270, when the Franks invaded. Archeological evidence shows some Roman presence into 4th century, but the castellum was not rebuilt. During the Early Middle Ages another fortification was built on the site, which was destroyed by the Vikings and rebuilt in 818. The site of the fortifications became the center of the medieval town and location of the episcopal see of Utrecht. Layout The fort was rebuilt four times, and each time was raised up by adding fill. Periods I-II date from AD 47-69; periods III-IV date from 70 to the end of the 2nd century; and period V dates from the end of the 2nd century to the middle of the 3rd century. The fort was made of wood in periods I-IV, in size, with ramparts made of earth and wood. In period V it was rebuilt of stone and increased in size to . At this time the gates were flanked by stone gate towers with semi-circular bastions on the exterior. The fort contained the headquarters building, or principia, within a rectangular courtyard surrounded by a colonnade (portico). The building had hypocaust underfloor heating. Throughout the fort's existence the principia was about with an atrium, cross hall and five rooms. The central room was the shrine of the legions' standards, or sacellum. This room and the atrium both held stone altars in period V. A protective ditch surrounded the fort throughout its Roman occupation. There were vici to the east and west of the castellum where craftsmen lived who depended on the soldiers. The eastern vicus was at , on the river bank. Excavations Some remains of the original fort have been found below the cathedral square at a depth of . Several excavations have been undertaken, mostly between 1929 and 1949. The archaeologists were at first looking for the remains of two medieval churches that stood on the site, but changed their priority after the remains of the castellum were found. Parts of walls were found later, as were partial remains of wooden barracks and traces of the moat. Two of the fort's four gates have been excavated. Some parts of the barracks from different periods have been excavated. The main building, the principia, has been fully excavated. Beginning in 1992, the nearby Duitse Huis, headquarters of the Teutonic Knights' Bailiwick of Utrecht from 1348, was extensively renovated. This included building a new wing of the Grand Hotel Karel V. Traces of a Roman cemetery were found, perhaps associated with the fort.

Rozat Al Jannat in Ahval Al Ulama An Sayyeds, asadollah Esmaeilian Publication, Qom, 1392 Lunar) General religious leadership His moral courage and spirit of reconciliation between Muslims was the cause of his collaboration with the great contemporary scholars on the performing of social duties .

It first aired on CBS on October 14, 2010. In the episode, Howard and Bernadette go on a date following their breakup a few months prior. Sheldon and Raj engage in a series of \\"tit for tat\\" exchanges when working together. The title refers to Howard's virtual affair with a troll on World of Warcraft. The episode features guest appearances by actors Katee Sackhoff (Battlestar Galactica) and George Takei (Star Trek). They appear during Howard's fantasy and later, when Howard and Bernadette are \\"making out\\" in her car. Melissa Rauch became part of the main cast in this episode. \\"The Hot Troll Deviation\\" was watched by 12.57 million viewers with a Nielsen rating of 7.6/13 in the U.S. It received mixed reviews and ratings. Plot The guys go to the Cheesecake Factory and when Bernadette arrives, Howard hides under the table to avoid her. Later, Howard, to the theme music of Francis Lai's score from the 1966 film, \\"A Man and a Woman,\\" is having a sexual fantasy with Katee Sackhoff wearing a flight suit from Battlestar Galactica. Bernadette then appears in the fantasy; Katee says he still has feelings for Bernadette. George Takei then appears, making Katee question Howard's sexuality. Katee and George begin discussing their acting careers and the fantasy ends when Howard's mother starts shouting at him. Penny agrees to help Howard if he reveals why he and Bernadette broke up. Bernadette caught him having cybersex with a World of Warcraft player, later revealed to be a male Caltech colleague. They go on a date at the Cheesecake Factory, with Penny eavesdropping on them. Although they never had sex, Bernadette claims this was because Howard never \\"made the move\\". They decide to give the relationship another try, and after a miniature golf date, make out in Bernadette's car. Sachoff and Takei appear, giving Howard conflicting advice about whether to \\"make the move\\", but Bernadette stops him, saying she needs to get to know him again but assuring him that they will get there. Meanwhile, Raj insists he should get a desk, while Sheldon claims he does not need one, or have the money for one: As pointed out by Raj, Sheldon's money is for a marshmallow rifle, drawer full of Red Vines and a phosphorescent ant farm. They compromise: Raj is allowed to purchase a desk with his own money. The desk is huge and ornate, deliberately chosen to irritate Sheldon. This begins a series of \\"tit-for-tat\\" exchanges; Raj brings a bird into the office; Sheldon loudly plays annoying Indian music; Raj turns the heating up; and they start shooting at each other, Sheldon with marshmallows and Raj with a Nerf gun. Sheldon tries making foul-smelling hydrogen sulfide and ammonia gases to force Raj out; Raj attempts to counter the smell with scented aromatherapy candles, but accidentally ignites an explosion (hydrogen sulfide gas is highly flammable). A scorched and singed Raj walks out of the office with the bird, warning Sheldon that this is not over. Reception =Ratings= On the night of its first broadcast on October 14, 2010, the episode was watched by 12.57 million households in the U.S. It had a Nielsen rating of 7.6/13, with a 4.3/14 rating in its target demographic of ages 18‚Äì49. In Canada, the episode had 2.84 million viewers and a weekly ranking of 2. In the UK, the episode aired on November 25, 2010. On E4 it had 0.72 million viewers and 0.26 million watched on E4 +1. The episode ranked second and third on the channels, respectively, with a total of 0.98 million watches. In Australia, the episode was first broadcast on February 8, 2011 and had 0.92 million viewers. This gave it a nightly ranking of 11. =Reviews= Emily VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club gave the episode a C+. She complimented the cast and the \\"rare\\" Raj and Sheldon storyline filled with \\"mostly funny sight gags\\". However, the writers were criticized, as was how the show \\"rarely takes chances\\" (perhaps because it is \\"such a big hit\\"), and how it is filled with \\"lazy\\" and \\"easy\\" jokes. The TV Critic rated the episode 52 out of 100, concluding that there were \\"two good stories\\" but that \\"neither was well told\\". The recurring story arcs were said to \\"[reward] fans for paying attention\\" and the guest stars were complimented, George Takei for his \\"camp\\" acting and Katee Sackhoff for reappearing after a similar fantasy scene in \\"The Vengeance Formulation\\". However, the Sheldon and Raj plot \\"did not have time to develop properly\\" and Howard using his father abandoning him to pressure Penny was described as a \\"cheap joke\\". Jenna Busch of IGN rated the episode 9 out of 10. She was \\"thrilled\\" to get a \\"Howard-centric episode\\", although sad that Leonard had such a small role. The masturbation scene was complimented, particularly for the \\"good cop/bad cop\\" roles of Sackhoff and Takei. Eric Hochberger from TV Fanatic gave the episode 3.7 out of 5 stars. He also mentioned Leonard's lack of storylines. Bernadette's character was praised for fitting in better than on True Blood and George Takei was described as \\"fantastic\\". However, he points out that the show is \\"[playing] its storylines and jokes very safe\\", unlike in the first seasons.

Christ and the Four Hornsmen of the Apocalypse is an eight-piece power pop band from New York City, known for their humorous, adult-oriented lyrics. The band consists of lead singer and writer Risa Mickenberg, guitarist Joel Shelton, his brother, bassist Will Shelton, drummer Stan Mitchell, and, as their name suggests, four horn players. The band's horn players, who perform as \\"the Hornsmen\\", perform in Broadway musicals including The Producers and Fiddler on the Roof. History The band was established in 2003 after Mickenberg was given a song writing session with Shelton as a birthday gift from her boyfriend. The two wrote a song titled \\"I'm Disgusting (Will You Marry Me?)\\". They first became popular in 2006, when their song \\"Connecticut's for Fucking\\" attracted attention on the Internet and satellite radio. Mickenberg is from Connecticut, and so included references to many of her home state's cultural practices in the song. Their eponymous debut album, which included the song \\"Connecticut's for Fucking\\", was released later that year. The band released its second album, Happier than You, on October 21, 2008 in the United Kingdom and a week later in the United States. Reception \\"Connecticut's for Fucking\\" was commended by Niki D'Andrea of the Phoenix New Times for its \\"ridiculously catchy pop beat; dorky, nasal punk vocals (courtesy of the surprisingly sexy Risa Mickenburg); and lampooning of noodling '80s metal guitar solos,\\" and concluded that it was \\"like a bubblegum enema flushing pop punk out of mainstream music's bloated colon.\\" Ira Robbins also reviewed the song favorably, writing that it was \\"hysterical, a deadly putdown of the Nutmeg State as a nadir of middle-class tedium that proffers copulation as the only entertaining alternative.\\" Their self-titled debut album was reviewed by Jason MacNeil writing in PopMatters. MacNeil awarded the album a rating of 7 out of 10 and described the band's sound as \\"an odd blend of Sixpence None the Richer, Arcade Fire, and New Pornographers if they were all fronted by Amy Sedaris.\\" It was also reviewed by David Menconi, who wrote in No Depression that its sound was \\"NRBQ with a metallic pop edge and an expanded horn section, fronted by a singer who looks a bit like Julia Louis- Dreyfus, sounds a bit like Sarah Vowell, and writes a bit like Amy Rigby ‚Äî only much nastier.\\" Similarly, the New Yorker reviewed their debut album and praised it for its \\"crusading horn section and...fine guitar playing.\\" Another review appeared in the Tucson Weekly, and recommended that the reader buy the album \\"if you read and loved A Confederacy of Dunces or A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius...especially if you're having a bad day.\\" The reviewer, Linda Ray, also described the album's songs as \\"...a collection of intelligently observant and wryly amusing pop/rock/punk takes on gender politics.\\" Robert Christgau reviewed their debut album and gave it an A‚Äì, writing that \\"Some of these songs are funny, the rest very funny.\\" Like their debut album, Happier than You was also reviewed by PopMatters, where Stephen Haag gave the album a score of 4 out of 10. He also criticized the album for being inferior to their debut album, and said that it \\"mines the same territory‚Äîclever people writing songs about sex and relationships, backed by big guitars and, uh, four hornsmen‚Äîthough to much lesser effect.\\" Robert Christgau reviewed this album and was more favorable, giving it an A‚Äì and writing that Mickenberg \\"sings the way [Lina Lamont in Singin' in the Rain] talks--only she can carry a tune and use her brain.\\" In describing this album, NPR wrote that the band makes music that's \\"irreverent to some, but hilarious to others.\\" Discography *Jesus H.

Enslaved by the Turks, he was taken to Constantinople where he first served the heir apparent, Prince Mustafa, and then the Grand Seraglio. He was with the Ottoman armies in Persia, in the Balkan Peninsula and Asia (1472-1481). After about 1483 Angiolello‚Äôs career is uncertain.

El Kazzaz is best known for creating and producing Al-Bernameg with Bassem Youssef, the first and top political satire program in the Middle East.  Career  After graduating from the American University in Cairo with a bachelor's degree in construction engineering, El Kazzaz became determined to create a market for online digital entertainment in Egypt. He started working on several self-funded startups in the media production and digital media field, but none of them achieved the success he sought or the vision that he had in mind, a vision that would later change the media production industry in Egypt and the Middle East. In 2007, El Kazzaz founded Qsoft Ltd., the first company specialized in managing and monetizing online content in Egypt. Within five years, El Kazzaz's leadership had grown the company to become one of the top professional producers of commercial online video and TV content in the Middle East. In 2017 El Kazzaz was appointed as Head of Multi-Platform Network and Social Media at Middle East Broadcasting Center based in Dubai, heading all MBC's content creation and distribution on social media. He managed a team of 115 people across 4 countries to deliver around 8,000 videos a month, and pushed the MBC social video viewership to average 1 billion views a month, achieving according to Tubular Labs, the number 37 globally in the media and entertainment industry in viewership.  Discovering Bassem Youssef  After the tremendous success of managing and monetizing content on the internet, El Kazzaz decided to move a step further into the digital media industry, namely by creating his own online content. His objective was to create content that would succeed online and later move on to TV, reaching the largest possible number of viewers. Being lifetime friends with Bassem Youssef, El Kazzaz realized the talent Youssef had and decided to combine that talent with his expertise in digital entertainment to produce compelling content addressing the young Egyptian online community. Late in 2010, El Kazzaz and Youssef created a program discussing the different religious cults around the world. However, the project was never uploaded on YouTube due to the 2011 Alexandria bombings, that took place at the same time of the video production, making the topic too sensitive to address at the time. After the Egyptian Revolution of 2011, El Kazzaz and his carefully selected team of young professionals started executing a strategic plan to produce the number one entertainment show in the Middle East, namely Al-Bernameg with Bassem Youssef. The company started by producing the B+ Show on YouTube, gaining more than five million views in the first three months. In a few months, the team became the Executive Producers of Al-Bernameg with Bassem Youssef, making the show the first Internet to TV conversion in the Middle East. After leading an ambitious renovation project of Cairo‚Äôs glamorous Radio Theatre in 2012, the program became the first show of its kind in the Middle East with a live audience, and recording one of the highest ratings on TV with more than 40 million viewers every week and more than two million subscribers on its YouTube channel.Al Bernameg  Further Projects  Being a principal contributor to the success of a number of productions, such as ‚ÄúAmerica Bel ‚ÄòArabi‚Äù by Bassem Youssef and ‚ÄúThawra ‚ÄòAla Al Nafs‚Äù by Moez Massoud, El Kazzaz decided to unleash the potential of his team by co-founding ‚ÄúBIG Productions‚Äù, a specialized production company. He is also embarking on a new project under the name Tube Star Network that aims not only to create successful productions, but also to create an online platform for any talent in the region to be developed, nourished and professionally produced, and to reach the highest number of audience through the different entertainment channels. QSoft has now expanded into a holding company, employing more than 250 young professionals, with offices in Cairo, Dubai and Abu Dhabi. El Kazzaz remains CEO, leading the company‚Äôs corporate strategy, business growth plans, contract negotiations, new accounts acquisitions, promoting corporate brand and relations, and online campaigns design and management.

The distance, suitably quantified, to the limiting distribution can be made arbitrarily small by selecting a distribution sufficiently far along the sequence. This notion generalizes a limit of functions; a limit as a distribution may exist when a limit of functions does not. The notion is a part of distributional calculus, a generalized form of calculus that is based on the notion of distributions, as opposed to classical calculus, which is based on the narrower concept of functions.  Definition  Given a sequence of distributions f_i, its limit f is the distribution given by :f[\\\\varphi] = \\\\lim_{i \\\\to \\\\infty} f_i[\\\\varphi] for each test function \\\\varphi, provided that distribution exists. The existence of the limit f means that (1) for each \\\\varphi, the limit of the sequence of numbers f_i[\\\\varphi] exists and that (2) the linear functional f defined by the above formula is continuous with respect to the topology on the space of test functions. More generally, as with functions, one can also consider a limit of a family of distributions.  Examples  A distributional limit may still exist when the classical limit does not. Consider, for example, the function: :f_t(x) = {t \\\\over 1 + t^2 x^2} Since, by integration by parts, :\\\\langle f_t, \\\\phi \\\\rangle = -\\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^0 \\\\arctan(tx) \\\\phi'(x) \\\\, dx - \\\\int_0^\\\\infty \\\\arctan(tx) \\\\phi'(x) \\\\, dx, we have: \\\\displaystyle \\\\lim_{t \\\\to \\\\infty} \\\\langle f_t, \\\\phi \\\\rangle = \\\\langle \\\\pi \\\\delta_0, \\\\phi \\\\rangle. That is, the limit of f_t as t \\\\to \\\\infty is \\\\pi \\\\delta_0. Let f(x+i0) denote the distributional limit of f(x+iy) as y \\\\to 0^+, if it exists. The distribution f(x-i0) is defined similarly. One has :(x - i 0)^{-1} - (x + i 0)^{-1} = 2 \\\\pi i \\\\delta_0. Let \\\\Gamma_N = [-N-1/2, N+1/2]^2 be the rectangle with positive orientation, with an integer N.

The medal is awarded every two years to world poets and writers. N√¢zƒ±m Hikmet A famous Turkish poet, playwright, novelist, memoirist, painter, public figure, International Peace Prize laureate and the founder of the Turkish revolutionary poetry, N√¢zƒ±m Hikmet Ran was born on 15 January 1902 in Salonica. He was the son of an Ottoman government official and grew up in Anatolia. After briefly attending the Turkish naval academy, he studied economics and political science at the University of Moscow. Nazim Hikmet was repeatedly arrested for his political beliefs and spent much of his adult life in prison or in exile. His poetry has been translated into more than fifty languages, plays have been staged in several countries gaining huge popularity. Nazim Hikmet‚Äôs first book of poetry was ‚ÄúSong of the Sun-drinkers‚Äù, published in Baku in 1928. Many of his works have been translated into English, including \\"Human Landscapes from My Country: An Epic Novel in Verse\\" (2009), \\"Things I Didn‚Äôt Know I Loved\\" (1975), \\"The Day Before Tomorrow\\" (1972), \\"The Moscow Symphony\\" (1970), and \\"Selected Poems\\" (1967). In 1936 he published Seyh Bedreddin destani (‚ÄúThe Epic of Shaykh Bedreddin‚Äù) and Memleketimden insan manzaralari (‚ÄúPortraits of People from My Land‚Äù). In 1950 he won the Nobel Peace Prize. Hikmet died of a heart attack in Moscow in 1963. As the first modern Turkish poet, he is recognized around the world as one of the great international poets of the twentieth century. Nazim Hikmet Culture and Arts Foundation After the death of Nazim Hikmet his close friends under the leadership of his sister Samia Yaltirim and Prof.Dr.Aydin Aybay decided to set up a foundation in his name. Due to his friends efforts, the ‚ÄúNazim Hikmet Culture and Arts Foundation‚Äù was established by Samia Yaltirim in 1991. The purpose of ‚ÄúNazim Hikmet Culture and Arts Foundation‚Äù was to establish a center which will collect and introduce any articles, books, pictures, paintings, movies, music, sculpture, memorials and research about Nazim Hikmet to future generations. In order to always cherish the memory of Nazim Hikmet, to ensure the dissemination of his works and to assess contribution of contemporary poets the foundation established \\"International Nazim Hikmet Poetry Award\\". Award holders The first winner of the \\"International Nazim Hikmet Poetry Award\\" ceremony which held on January 14, 1995 considering the value of artistic and intellectual properties of works was Syrian poet Adonis, who is currently living in France. The second winner of \\"International Nazim Hikmet Poetry Award\\" was Aime Cesaire from Martinique in 1997. He won this award for explaining in detail the longing for freedom and equality of all oppressed people in the twentieth century. The third winner of \\"International Nazim Hikmet Poetry Award\\" was the Palestinian poet Mahmoud Darwish in 2003. Then a next winner was the Danish poet Erik Stinus in 2009. Erik Stinus moves his readers away from the ironic character of Danish poetry. On the other hand, Stinus is a great poet of Western poetry who focuses on life and who bears witness to his era. I n recent years there have been some problems for nominating the \\"International Nazim Hikmet Poetry Award\\" every two years, such as financial deficiencies and the attracting of voters from the international organization. Finally, after a long time off, on February 7, 2014 due to the positive contribution towards Turkish World and the tenderness of his poetry, Zalimkhan Yagub was awarded with \\"International Nazim Hikmet Poetry Award\\" by The International Academy of Sciences of Turkish World Investigation. Zalimkhan Yaghub was the first poet from Azerbaijan who was honoured with that medal.

It aired on tvN from August 29 to October 11, 2014 on Fridays and Saturdays at 20:50 for 14 episodes. The romantic comedy series is about four males who each confront different challenges in love and work at the cusp of a new decade in their lives. Plot There is a common Korean belief that anything plus nine (gu in Korean) is always \\"cursed\\" and brings about more hardship than usual, including the ninth year of every decade in one's life. Gu Kwang-soo is 39 years old. He was once the brilliant PD (production director) of the nation's top live music program. But his fall from grace occurs when members of an indie band he'd cast drop their pants onstage and flash the entire country during a live broadcast (based on a real-life incident on MBC in 2005). Kwang- soo loses his position and gets shunted to another program, a low-rated trivia quiz show. He is desperate to get married, but his workaholic ways leave him little time to date. Kwang-soo often thinks about \\"the one who got away,\\" his ex-girlfriend Joo Da-in who left him heartbroken when she suddenly broke up with him one day after publicly rejecting his marriage proposal. When they meet again, Da-in is a single mother whose life revolves around her young daughter Eun-seo, and they've just moved into the apartment one floor above Kwang-soo's. Kwang-soo lives with his superstitious older sister Bok-ja and her three sons, Kang Jin-gu, Kang Min-gu, and Kang Dong-gu. Kang Jin-gu is 29 years old. He is a tour planner for a large vacation travel agency, and he's self-assured, good at his job, and popular with women. But he starts having to reevaluate his whole future when he falls into a one-sided love for the first time in his life. Jin-gu almost confesses his romantic feelings for his friend and co-worker Ma Se-young, who's from a small town, is outspoken and rough around the edges but very loyal. But apart from his fear of being rejected, Jin-gu learns that his stoic best friend Park Jae-bum also likes Se-young. Kang Min-gu is 19 years old. He is a hot-tempered high school senior and judo athlete. Min-gu dreams of going to his dream college on a judo scholarship, which means giving his all to win a gold medal in his competitive matches. But an upset stomach during a semi-finals match causes him to lose and poop in his pants, and after that embarrassing episode, his judo ranking drops. Min-gu keeps running into a cute but mysterious girl named Han Soo-ah all over town, and he decides that they're fated to be together. Soo-ah is used to having the entire district's high school boys swooning over her, but Min-gu's sincerity eventually wins her over. But Min-gu doesn't know that Soo-ah's hiding some secrets: her real first name is the country bumpkin-sounding Bong-sook, she's two years older than he is and attends a cram school, and that she was once a legendary cussing, tough, party girl in high school. Kang Dong-gu is 9 years old. He is a child actor who became famous doing food commercials because of his healthy appetite. Dong-gu suddenly feels threatened when during a movie audition, he loses the role to a new rival child actor named Do Min-joon. He soon finds himself in a career slump, with the other stage parents whispering that since he's growing less cute as he gets older, it's become more obvious that he is not good at acting at all. The precocious Dong-gu has also been secretly dating 8-year-old child actress Jang Baek-ji for the past two years, but Baek-ji dumps him for Min-joon.

Its peak height is above sea level, making it the fifth-highest mountain in Columbia County. Streams that flow near the mountain include Roaring Creek, Catawissa Creek, and some of its tributaries. The mountain is near Nescopeck Mountain and Little Mountain. Sandstones and rock formations such as the Pocono Formation occur on Catawissa Mountain. The community of Catawissa is near Catawissa Mountain. There have also been several roads on or near the mountain in the past. In more recent times, all terrain vehicle trails were established there, as was Pennsylvania State Game Lands Number 58. There are vernal pools on the mountain, which are used as breeding grounds for amphibians. The mountain is part of a much larger tract of forest. Catawissa Mountain is located in southeastern Catawissa Township, southwestern Main Township, eastern Roaring Creek Township, among other places. Geography Catawissa Mountain in southern Beaver Township Catawissa Mountain's southeastern edge is at the border between Luzerne County and Columbia County. From here, it runs northwest through Beaver Township and Roaring Creek Township to the community of Catawissa. A spur of the mountain can be said to cross the Susquehanna River and turn west into Montour County, where it ceases to be a mountain. The peak height of Catawissa Mountain is above sea level. However, numerous places on the mountain rise to over above sea level. The mountain is the fifth-highest mountain in Columbia County, behind Red Rock Mountain, Central Mountain, Chimneystack Rock, and Buck Mountain. The community of Catawissa is close to Catawissa Mountain. Main Township and Locust Township are also located near the mountain. Geology Catawissa Mountain is relatively short and rounded, especially compared to nearby mountains such as Huntington Mountain, which are straight and narrow ridges. Catawissa Mountain has some rocky outcroppings. There are two zigzagging outcroppings of the Pocono Formation on Catawissa Mountain. These outcroppings pass through the mountain and south into Schuylkill County. They also have spurs and knobs at each point where they zigzag. The Northumberland Syncline passes through a spur of the mountain. The mountain also has an elbow which is part of a double synclinal that heads eastward to Nescopeck Mountain. A coarse and hard sandstone can be found on Catawissa Mountain. Sandstone of the Pocono Formation occurs on the summit of the mountain. Catawissa Mountain is part of a chain of mountains running from beyond Dauphin to Carbondale. The mountain is located near both Nescopeck Mountain and Little Mountain. The meeting point of Catawissa Mountain and Nescopeck Mountain is on the edge of a canoe valley. Hydrology Several tributaries of the lower reaches of Catawissa Creek originate on Catawissa Mountain. A number of these tributaries are affected by acid deposition. Roaring Creek is also close to the western side of the mountain. Catawissa Creek cuts a gap between Catawissa Mountain and Nescopeck Mountain at the community of Mainville. The creek also flows parallel to Catawissa Mountain downstream of this gap. There are vernal pools on Catawissa Mountain in Beaver Township and Roaring Creek Township. History and etymology The word Catawissa comes from the Algonquin word Gatawissi, meaning \\"growing fat\\". There was at least one Native American village in Catawissa, near Catawissa Mountain, and possibly several villages during different time periods. Historically, a road known as the Mine Gap Road climbed up Catawissa Mountain. In the past, a road led from the valley of the Schuylkill River to Catawissa via the southern part of the mountain. The Reading Road also passed from Catawissa to Philadelphia via the mountain. J.H. Beers stated in his 1915 book Historical and Biographical Annals of Columbia and Montour Counties, Pennsylvania that the height of Catawissa Mountain was estimated to be . The same author described the mountain as \\"majestic\\" and \\"towering\\" in his book. Since at least 2001, the Columbia-Montour Amateur Radio Club has had a receiver on Catawissa Mountain. Biology Catawissa Mountain is one of several places in Columbia County that has unbroken tracts of forest. It is part of a forested corridor between the Susquehanna River and Moosic Mountain. Amphibians use the vernal pools on Catawissa Mountain as breeding grounds, including American toads, wood frogs, and spotted salamanders. In Pennsylvania State Game Lands Number 58, the forests on Catawissa Mountain are hardwood/heath forests. Trees in these forests include red maple, chestnut oak, scarlet oak, mountain laurel, black huckleberry, and lowbush blueberry. Numerous plant species inhabit the mountain's vernal pools. These include cranberry, cinnamon fern, royal fern, tussock sedge, pitch pine, and numerous others. Recreation The Pennsylvania State Game Lands Number 58 are located on Catawissa Mountain. Use of all terrain vehicles on the mountain is increasing, as of 2004. The Columbia County Natural Heritage Inventory of 2004 suggested blocking all terrain vehicle trails near the mountain's vernal pools.

NB same definition is given for both \\"English\\" and \\"US English\\" It has been suggested that the name may be derived from the way the broad brim frames the face to create a \\"picture\\". This is a very broad category of hat; some versions may be similar to the halo or cartwheel hat. This style featured in virtually every decade of the 20th century, and has a history dating back to at least the 18th century. History of the hat Thomas Gainsborough portrait of Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire, said to be an inspiration for the picture or Gainsborough hat The picture hat was first popularised as a style at the end of the 18th century and is said to have been inspired by the hats seen on portraits of society women painted by Thomas Gainsborough. It was then often known as the Gainsborough Chapeau. Other names included garden hat. These early hats were large, with a wide brim and were designed to perch on top of the lavish hairstyles popular during this era. Hats incorporated details such as feathers and trims ‚Äì some are said to have even included whole stuffed birds. The picture hat became fashionable again from the end of the 19th century ‚Äì popularised in images of Gibson Girls in the United States and Canada and in the Gaiety Girls of the London theatre. 20th-century revival London's Gaiety Girls, here photographed in 1896, helped to popularise the fashion for picture hats In the early 1920s, The Times described Paris fashions of large picture hats in black velvet trimmed with traditional garden flowers. In the same year, the picture hat was described as: \\"greatly in favour\\", alongside the toque. As a fashion correspondent noted in 1922, its popularity may have been due to its adaptable nature: \\"They are wearable in every season, and vary more in the way they are put on than in shape\\". Styles were simpler than those worn in the Edwardian era ‚Äì following the prevailing fashion of cloches by including a more close-fitting crown to flatter shorter hairstyles. A 1920s advert for Harrods' spring hats showcased a black straw picture hat with a wide brim embroidered with silk and chenille. By the end of the 1920s, picture-style hats were changing shape, as noted by a fashion correspondent: \\"Hats with higher fronts to the crown are being made, and one new shape has a turned-back brim at the side, in the style of the old- fashioned picture hat, but smaller\\". =1930s designs= 1941 picture hat worn by Carole Landis in Topper Returns A 1930 review of millinery designs created by Madame Agn√®s ‚Äì who was also a sculptor ‚Äì noted a trend towards more unusual shapes for picture hats: \\"The brims of picture hats are irregular and are attached to the crown in such a way as to lift the front away from the forehead or to form a little point\\". Picture hats remained popular for sporting events and marriages, although by the middle of the decade some designs were becoming smaller. In 1935, The Times described summer designs worn forward on the head, with low crowns and trimmings of flowers, fruit or draped fabric. Picture hats continued to be worn for both day and evening events ‚Äì a Paquin evening gown of 1938 included a black velvet model with veil, worn with matching elbow-length gloves. The dramatic picture hat, as worn by Audrey Hepburn in the 1961 film Breakfast at Tiffany's, became fashionable from the late 1950s Post-war picture hats The Queen and other members of the British royal family continued to favour picture hats in the immediate post-war years, and they remained a fixture at weddings and sporting occasions. By 1955, however, The Times had announced the disappearance of the picture hat in fashion, as streamlined cloche, cocktail and new conical-shaped hats came into vogue. The article noted: \\"A solitary wide-brimmed classic among some 60 models selected from those now going into the shops...but such a shape has for long been beloved of many Englishwomen, and by comparison the rest of the hats were a chic and challenging assortment\\". The death knell was perhaps sounded too soon, as by 1958 hats were either very large or very small. Parisian milliner Claude Saint-Cyr was designing dramatic picture hats ‚Äì relying more on shape than on trimmings for effect ‚Äì very much in the style that would be worn three years later by Audrey Hepburn in Breakfast at Tiffany's. During the 1960s and 1970s, the picture hat persisted ‚Äì although designs such as the pillbox and bucket hat were more popular ‚Äì but tended to have a higher crown. The Victoria and Albert Museum archive has a photograph of a Madame Paulette model from 1963 that illustrates the fashion for height as well as width. By the early 1970s, there was a revival ‚Äì with memorable examples including the design worn at the Saint Tropez wedding of Bianca Jagger in 1971, and the outsize model worn by Farrah Fawcett at her wedding to Lee Majors in 1973. Marc Jacobs showcased enormous Victorian-style picture hats at New York Fashion Week A/W 2012 The picture hat remains a popular style for events such as Ladies' Day at Ascot and its high-profile fans include Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, who is known for her wide-brimmed designs. Picture hats still appear on the fashion catwalk; notably Marc Jacobs included oversized fur designs harking back to in the late Victorian age his 2012 autumn-winter show at New York Fashion Week.

It is typically subclassified into four distinct fibrinogen disorders: afibrinogenemia, hypofibrinogenemia, dysfibrinogenemia, and hypodysfibrinogenemia. *Afibrinogenemia is defined as a lack of fibrinogen in the blood, clinically <20 mg/deciliter of plasma. The frequency of this disorder is estimated at between 0.5 and 2 per million. Within the United States, afibrinogenemia accounts for 24% of all inherited abnormalities of fibrinogen, while hypofibrinogenemia and dysfibrinogenemia account for 38% each. *Congenital hypofibrinogenemia is defined as a partial deficiency of fibrinogen, clinically 20‚Äì80/deciliter of plasma. Estimated frequency varies from <0.5 to 3 per million. *Dysfibrinogenemia is defined as malfunctioning or non-functioning fibrinogen in the blood, albeit at normal concentrations: 200‚Äì400 mg/deciliter of plasma. Dysfibrinogenemia may be an inherited disease and therefore termed congenital dysfibrinogenemia or secondary to another disease and therefore termed acquired dysfibrinogenemia. The congenital disorder is estimated to a frequency varying between 1 and 3 per million. *Hypodysfibrinogenemia is a partial deficiency of fibrinogen that is also malfunctioning. Hypodysfibrinogenemia is an extremely rare inherited disease. Clinically, these disorders are generally associated with an increased diathesis, i.e. propensity, to develop spontaneous bleeding episodes and excessive bleeding after even minor tissue injuries and surgeries; however, individuals with any of these disorders may also exhibit a propensity to pathological thrombosis episodes. Treatment of these disorders generally involves specialized centers and the establishment of preventive measures designed based on each individuals personal and family histories of the frequency and severity of previous bleeding and thrombosis episodes, and, in a select few cases, the predicted propensity of the genetic mutations which underlie their disorders to cause bleeding and thrombosis.  Signs and symptoms  Afibrinogenemia is typically the most severe of the three disorders. Common symptoms include bleeding of the umbilical cord at birth, traumatic and surgical bleeding, GI tract, oral and mucosal bleeding, spontaneous splenic rupture, and rarely intracranial hemorrhage and articular bleeding. Symptoms of hypofibrinogenemia varies from mild to severe, but can include bleeding of the GI tract, oral and mucosal bleeding, and very rarely intracranial bleeding. More commonly it presents during traumatic bleeding or surgical procedures. Most cases (60%) of dysfibrinogenemia are asymptomatic, but 28% exhibit hemorrhaging similar to that described above while 20% exhibit thrombosis (i.e. excessive clotting).  Causes  The disorders associated with Factor I deficiency are generally inherited, although certain liver diseases can also affect fibrinogen levels and function (e.g. cirrhosis). Afibrinogenemia is a recessive inherited disorder, where both parents must be carriers. Hypofibrinogenemia and dysfibrinogenemia can be dominant (i.e. only one parent needs to be a carrier) or recessive. The origin of the disorders is traced back to three possible genes: FGA, FGB, or FGG. Because all three are involved in forming the hexameric glycoprotein fibrinogen, mutations in any one of the three genes can cause the deficiency. Diagnosis  Treatment  The most common type of treatment is cryoprecipitate or fibrinogen concentrate drip to increase fibrinogen levels to normal during surgical procedures or after trauma. RiaSTAP, a factor I concentrate, was approved by the U.S. FDA in 2009 for use when the fibrinogen level was below 50 mg/deciliter of plasma. Recently, antifibrinolytics have also been used to inhibit fibrinolysis (breaking down of the fibrin clot). In the case of dysfibrinogenemia that manifests by thrombosis, anticoagulants can be used. Due to the inhibited clotting ability associated with a- and hypofibrinogenemia, physicians advise against the use of Aspirin as it inhibits platelet function.

HCPA currently serves 2,350 students in the Minneapolis and St. Paul area, including a sizable cohort of Karen students and notable representation from a variety of other communities.. History Hmong College Prep Academy (HCPA) started in 2004 in North Minneapolis as a 8-10 school. In 2006, HCPA moved to the Midway neighborhood of St. Paul. The first graduating class was in 2007. Also, in 2007, Phase II of the school's expansion plan began with additional buildings being constructed. A new high school was built in 2013, signifying the start of HCPA's Phase III expansion. The most recent addition, a new elementary school, ended Phase IV expansion in 2017. A larger and more complete middle school in being constructed and plans to be opened for the start of the 2021-2022 school year. HCPA students listening to a police officer speaking at the annual School Picnic School Programs All HCPA students receive small group advising through HCPA's College Prep Program. This program is designed to help them strengthen their intrapersonal skills, create a individualized career plan, and develop post-secondary plans catered to meet their specific needs. Starting in 2010, the College Prep Program is a 6-12 plan in which students remain with a single teacher and student cohort for their entire stay in a particular school (MS, HS). These cohorts are designed to establish healthy relationships between classmates and between the student and their College Prep teacher. These advisory cohorts are represented by a college/mascot when competing with other CPs at HCPA's monthly and quarterly assemblies. HCPA Soccer field Traditions Students at HCPA celebrate student successes on a monthly basis and at a quarterly Warrior Day where students compete in academic, athletic and spirit competitions. Additionally, the school's annual World Culture Day provides a unique opportunity for students and staff to come together in celebration of their respective culture. The day is filled with food, song, dance and traditional clothing representing groups from around the world. To cap off the year HCPA students enjoy a school wide picnic. This event traditionally includes volleyball, soccer and badminton tournaments, but also allows time for students to relax with their friends before saying goodbye for the summer. Recently, the school picnic has also provided a platform for community outreach. Groups including the Saint Paul Police, Ramsey County Sheriff's Department, National Guard and Saint Paul Fire Department have regaled the students with demonstrations that range from K-9 exhibitions to helicopter fly-ins.

The 2012 puzzle platform game built around rotating between four 2D views of a 3D space was developed by indie developer Polytron Corporation and published by Polytron, Trapdoor, and Microsoft Studios. Over the course of the game's development, Fez designer and Polytron founder Phil Fish received celebrity status for his outspoken public persona and prominence in the 2012 documentary Indie Game: The Movie, which followed the game's final stages of development and Polytron's related legal issues. The game was released to critical acclaim as an Xbox Live Arcade timed exclusive, and was later ported to other platforms. It had sold one million copies by the end of 2013. Fish and Shawn McGrath collaborated on a puzzle game that became Fez. When McGrath left the project due to creative differences, Fish, the game's artist, pursued a platform game direction with Renaud B√©dard, the game's programmer, who wrote the game's level editor and game engine from scratch. Levels were built in 3D by extruding surfaces with Photoshop-created textures. B√©dard and Fish were joined by three different animators and other collaborators. The game was first announced in June 2007 and won an award at the 2008 Independent Games Festival and entered the public spotlight. Fish created a studio, Polytron Corporation, and was later aided by nearby developer-publisher Trapdoor when Polytron ran out of money. Fez won several more prerelease awards, including the 2012 Seumas McNally Grand Prize.  History  Fez development cycle developed a reputation for its protracted five-year length and public exposure. Nathan Grayson of VG247 likened the game's rocky development process to \\"an indie Duke Nukem Forever\\". Polygon reviewer Arthur Gies wrote that the game was an \\"underdog darling of the indie game scene\\" for four years prior to its release. The game's designer, Phil Fish, became renowned in a way unusual for game developers due to his prominence in Indie Game: The Movie, which released in 2012. While the game was released to wide acclaim, Fish himself became known for his outspoken and acerbic public persona. The game that became Fez began in a collaboration between Montreal-based Phil Fish and Toronto-based Shawn McGrath on McGrath's idea for a puzzle game: a four-sided 3D space with each side in 2D, similar to Fish's 3D pixels (voxels) as incorporated into Fez. The entirety of Fez design, lore, and art descends from this game mechanic. Fish provided the project's art and credited his influence to Shigeru Miyamoto and Hayao Miyazaki. Fish and McGrath's partnership crumbled due to creative differences, as Fish wanted to create a platform game. Fish continued to work on the game in his spare time and announced his search for a programmer on DeviantArt, and the first person to reply, Renaud B√©dard, became lead programmer. They were both the same age and living in Montreal. Though B√©dard had some hobbyist experience in 3D graphics and was studying computer science, Fez was his first professional game development project. His first task was to write the level editor and game engine. Fez was first announced in July 2007 on The Independent Gaming Source. A trailer released in October 2007 convinced Jason DeGroot to join the development team as a producer. DeGroot, also known as \\"6955\\", first met Fish at a 2006 E3 party, and started work on the game's soundtrack and sound effects. The soundtrack was ultimately composed by Rich \\"Disasterpeace\\" Vreeland and the sound effects by Brandon McCartin. The game was nominated for two awards at the 2008 Independent Games Festival (IGF) at the Game Developers Conference (GDC): Excellence in Visual Art and the Design Innovation Award. As Fez was a side project, Fish was employed full-time at Artificial Mind and Movement in Montreal, where he worked on a tie-in game for a film. He was not permitted time off to attend the event and thus decided to quit his job in January 2008‚Äîa moment he later marked as \\"when I became indie\\". The game won \\"Excellence in Visual Art\\", and created a surge of public interest in the game concurrent to a similar swell of interest in indie game developers. Fish received a Canadian government loan to open Polytron Corporation as a startup company and began full-time work on Fez. In July 2009, Polytron announced a release for Xbox Live Arcade in early 2010. Polytron and Microsoft agreed to release Fez as an Xbox exclusive, a deal Fish later recalled as sensible. Fish designed the game as \\"a console game, not a PC game\\", and felt that the way he intended the game to be experienced‚Äîwith a controller on a couch‚Äîwas \\"part of the medium\\". Polytron ruled out a WiiWare release due to problems Fish had with their platform and developer options. Development continued with a more experimental ethos until the company began to run out of capital. The Canadian government loan that had funded Polytron's prototyping phase was not renewed for their production phase. They also lost funding from the organization that preceded the Indie Fund as Polytron's producer left the company. Fish borrowed money from friends and family for three months to keep the company open. In dire straits, he considered canceling the project. In March 2011, the nearby Qu√©b√©cois developer-publisher Trapdoor offered to help Polytron, having just signed a deal with Electronic Arts to publish their own game, Warp. Trapdoor assisted with Polytron's finances and operations and offered to treat them as part of their company and let them keep their intellectual property rights in exchange for a portion of Fez earnings. Fish felt that partnership rescued the game. Fish is shown preparing for Fez March 2011 PAX East booth in the 2012 documentary film Indie Game: The Movie, which chronicles the stories of several indie developers at various stages of their games' development cycles. As a subplot, the film presents Fish amidst a legal dispute with a former business partner that jeopardizes the game's future. The partner, believed to be Jason DeGroot, is portrayed negatively and does not participate onscreen. The film's end credits were later corrected to reflect that Fish's business partner was not asked for input. Game Informer called Fish the film's \\"most memorable developer\\", and Rock, Paper, Shotgun wrote that Fish is portrayed as melodramatic, theatrical, and neurotic, in a way that exacerbates his outspoken public perception. Eurogamer said that the part where Fish resolves to kill himself if he does not release his game is \\"the film's most startling moment\\". Fez won the Audience Choice Award at the September 2011 Fantastic Arcade, Best in Show and Best Story/World Design at the October 2011 Indiecade, and the Seumas McNally Grand Prize at the 2012 GDC Independent Games Festival. It was also a 2011 Penny Arcade Expo \\"PAX 10\\" selection. Fez was displayed in its entirety in a secluded lounge room at the October 2011 GameCity festival in Nottingham, England. Fish considered the demo their most fruitful yet. Fish told a Gamasutra reporter that he had received positive feedback from Independent Games Festival Chairman Brandon Boyer and Braid designer Jonathan Blow. Near the end of development, Fish felt \\"burnt out\\" and that his personal health had suffered. The final game included almost none of the original work from the first two years of development. After several delays, Fez was submitted for certification in February 2012. = Release = Fez was released on April 13, 2012 and sold 200,000 copies in its yearlong exclusivity to the Xbox Live Arcade platform. Several months later, Polytron became embroiled in a high-profile dispute with Microsoft over the cost of patching the game. Polytron had released a fix that resolved many of the game's technical issues but introduced another that corrupted the saved games for about one percent of users. They withdrew the patch, but found Microsoft's fee for subsequent patch releases unviable, and chose to reinstate the withdrawn patch as their most utilitarian option. Polytron drew ire for the decision, which raised awareness for the business needs of indie developers. In July 2013, a year later, Microsoft announced that they no longer charged for patches, and Fish tweeted that Polytron's patch would take \\"a couple of months\\". Speaking in retrospect of the release, Fish \\"fiercely criticized\\" Fez co-publisher Microsoft Games Studios for botching the game's release. Fish cited a lack of promotion and publicity, and poor advertising of the game on Microsoft's digital market. In March 2013, Fish announced a May 1, 2013 release for the game's PC port, and opened preorders on GOG.com and Steam. The game's OS X and Linux ports debuted in the pay-what-you-want Humble Indie Bundle 9 on September 11, 2013. Polytron announced ports for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 3, and PlayStation Vita in August 2013 as in development through BlitWorks, which were released on March 25, 2014. The PlayStation releases include cross-console support for cross-buy (where one digital purchase allows access across multiple consoles) and \\"cross-save\\" (game save sharing between consoles), as well as support for 3D televisions, the DualShock 4 controller's decorative lightbar, and graphical upgrades due to the full port into the C++ programming language. Ports for Ouya and iOS were also announced. Fish announced eventual ports for pretty much' every platform\\" but the Nintendo 3DS. B√©dard planned to leave Polytron after finishing Fez to experience work with a full development team, but stayed to port the Windows release before joining Toronto's Capybara Games. He credited the game's long development cycle to his own inexperience in game development (compounded by the team's small size and difficulty in setting reasonable milestones), the game's scope, and Fish's perfectionism. Fish had hoped that players would discuss Fez nuances online after the game's release. Players collaborated online for a week to solve the final \\"monolith\\" puzzle by brute force. Ars Technica described the apparent end to the game's harder puzzles as \\"anticlimactic\\", but Fish told Eurogamer in March 2013 that hidden in-game secrets remain to be found. More than three years after its digital launch, Fez received a physical release designed by Fish and limited to a signed edition of 500 in December 2015. The deluxe package included the soundtrack and a stylized red notebook with gold foil inlay. An iOS port began development in April 2017 when a teaser trailer was released. It was released in December 2017.  Design  When B√©dard joined the project, the game focused on the 2D‚Äì3D mechanic and did not yet have open world ambitions. He coded the game in Microsoft Visual C# Express and XNA Game Studio Express. His first task, the level editor Fezzer, was coded from scratch in XNA and inspired by SketchUp. B√©dard also wrote the game engine, Trixel Technology, which turns 2D tiles (\\"triles\\") into sides of a 3D cube pixel. The engine tracks player-character Gomez in 3D space even though the game behaves as a 2D platformer. B√©dard also built the game to resolve collisions when converting between 3D and 2D space. Fish created pixel art in Photoshop for each tiled side (\\"trile\\") of the 3D trixel that B√©dard's custom software compiled into 3D game assets, which Fish would extrude as surfaces in Fezzer to build levels. Fish found the level design process \\"overwhelming\\", and B√©dard has said he was relieved that it was not his job. Fish compared his design process to playing with Lego blocks, and planned the more involved levels in graph paper to first visualize the 2D views before building the levels in the 3D software. The levels and puzzles were not preordained in a design document, and many of the drafts levels scrapped in 2008 resurfaced to be used later in the production process. So as to fit the rotation mechanic, the levels were made tall instead of wide, and the first part of the game was designed to acclimate the player to 2D controls before introducing the 3D element. As they worked, Fish first proposed ideas that B√©dard would implement. The two would then discuss and fine-tune the addition‚Äîthey worked well together. Fish describes the game's changes during development as \\"organic\\"‚Äîthey tested different kinds of levels and replicated the types of in-game exploration that the team appreciated most. It came to adopt Metroidvania mechanics, with \\"secret passages, warp gates, and cheat codes\\". Fish cited Myst as another touchstone and compared its open world, nonlinear narrative, and \\"obtuse metapuzzles\\" to Fez own alphabet, numeric system, and an \\"almost unfairly hard to get\\" \\"second set of collectibles\\". Fish originally fought against having an in-game map because he wanted players to draft their own. After attempting to do so himself, he changed his mind. Fish later called the in-game map \\"probably one of the weakest aspects of the game\\". Fish also fought against including the navigational assistant, Dot, but later felt that the addition was successful and a positive contribution to the game's mythology. The fez itself, Fish described as an \\"ancient symbol of understanding the third dimension\\". Fez had three different animators through its development: Paul Robertson of Scott Pilgrim vs. the World: The Game, who did the game's animals and some of Gomez's animations, Adam Saltsman of Canabalt, and Graham Lackey, who did some character animations. The game's mechanics were inspired by the Nintendo Entertainment System games Fish played in his youth, particularly Super Mario and The Legend of Zelda. Fish cited Fumito Ueda's Ico as the game's third inspiration, and he sought to emulate its feeling of nostalgic and isolated loneliness. Fish also sought to emulate Ueda's \\"design by subtraction\\" philosophy, where the Ico development team would periodically remove parts of the game so as to leave only what was essential to their vision. In this way, ideas like player health and object weight puzzles were gradually struck from Fez. Fish made a personal challenge of designing a game without relying on \\"established mechanics\\". As such, Fez was always a peaceful game and there was never an enemy coded into the game. So as to better emulate Hayao Miyazaki's signature \\"open blue sky\\", \\"feel- good\\" atmosphere, Fish watched all of the director's films one weekend early in the development cycle.

It is also known as Ma Dadatoko, Salwake, Saluwaku or Salawako in Galela, Salewaku-mu in Loloda, Hawau-mu in Madole, Emuli in Buru or O Dadatoko in Tobelo.  Description  A 17th‚Äì19th century salawaku from Halmahera, housed at Singapore‚Äôs Asian Civilisations Museum. This specimen is made from wood, nacre, porcelain, and hair. The Salawaku is an hour-glass shaped, long shield. The shield, including the handle, is carved from a single piece of wood. The upper and lower part are broad, and the shield is thinnest in the middle. At the front, it is rounded or has a slight V-shape so that the centre part comes to the foreground. The shield is slightly curved from top to bottom. On the rear, an elevated rib can be seen along the entire length, part of which is the handle in the middle. The front of the Salawaku is painted black using soot and plant juice. It is inlaid with mother-of-pearl and fragments of earthenware, and/or painted with kakean symbols (used by a secret society) and other ornaments; these materials often hint at the foreign aspect of the shields. The shield forms a 'body', and the inlaid patterns refer to certain bodily parts. The upper segment refers to the head, and the lower part to the feet. Arteries run lengthwise. The elevated rib on the rear side represents the spine and, just below the handle, the larynx. Inlays just above the centre represents the eyes. Their number allegedly refers to the number of enemies killed by the ancestors. The shield must be shorter than two arms‚Äô length, in order to avoid the shield's end, and held against the chin to avoid tears falling on the shield, as 'courage and sadness must be separated.'  Use  The term Salawaku means 'protection' and 'repellence': a reference to the supernatural protection of the ancestors; or 'to miss and to catch'. With this technique the defender catches his adversary's weapon, secures it in the wooden shield and then disarms him. The shield is not only a defensive weapon, but thanks to its peculiar, narrow shape may be easily moved to deliver blows with the sharp rims and corners.  Cultural  The Salawaku may be part and parcel of the bridegroom's marriage gifts and are worn during the Cakalele (war dance) or the Hoyla (war dance during the marriage ceremony among the Tobelorese people). During the Cakalele, the Salawaku is carried in the left hand and with a spear or sword in the other. Whereas in the Hasa dance which is only performed by men, who carry the Salawaku on the left hand and a wooden machete, Barakas on the other.

He was the Chief Archaeologist of English Heritage from 1989 to 1999, and visiting professor to a number of universities. He served as President of the Prehistoric Society from 1981 to 1985 and the Society of Antiquaries of London from 2007 to 2010. Early life and education Wainwright was born on 19 September 1937 in Angle, Pembrokeshire, Wales. He was educated at Pembroke Dock Grammar School. He studied archaeology at the University College of South Wales and Monmouthshire in Cardiff, and graduated with a first class Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree in 1958. He undertook postgraduate research in \\"the Mesolithic cultures of south- west Wales\\" at the UCL Institute of Archaeology, completing his Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) degree in 1961. Career From 1961 to 1963, Wainwright was professor of environmental archaeology at the University of Baroda in India. He then joined the Inspectorate of Ancient Monuments, English Heritage, serving as an inspector from 1963 to 1980, a principal inspector from 1980 to 1990, and as Chief Archaeologist from 1989 to 1999. He has been a visiting professor at the University of Southampton since 1991, and was a visiting professor at the UCL Institute of Archaeology from 1995 to 2005. Wainwright was involved in his first excavation as a university student: this was a Mesolithic settlement at Freshwater West, Pembrokeshire, Wales. In 1965, he excavated an entire Iron Age settlement in Tollard Royal, Wiltshire: unusually for the time, and with \\"consternation from traditional archaeologists\\", he used a JCB digger to clear the topsoil. He used the same technique at more Iron Age sites and also at some late Neolithic henges. In 1966, he excavated Durrington Walls, and he found two timber circles. In 1972, he excavated the Iron Age settlement at Gussage All Saints, Dorset. Later life In retirement, Wainwright lived in Pontfaen, Pembrokeshire, Wales. He died at home on 6 March 2017, aged 79. His funeral was held on 20 March at the Parc Gwyn Crematorium in Narberth, Pembrokeshire. Personal life Wainwright was first married to Sue Lukes and they had three children. Having divorced Sue, he married Judith Paton in 1977. Honours In the 1991 New Year Honours, Wainwright was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in recognition of his services as Principal Inspector of Ancient Monuments for English Heritage. In 2006, he was awarded the Grahame Clark Medal for Prehistoric Archaeology by the British Academy. On 2 March 1967, he was elected Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London (FSA).

The difficulty or impossibility of solving certain geometric problems like trisection of an angle using ruler and compass only is the basis for the various protocols in geometric cryptography. This field of study was suggested by Mike Burmester, Ronald L. Rivest and Adi Shamir in 1996. Though the cryptographic methods based on geometry have practically no real life applications, they are of use as pedagogic tools for the elucidation of other more complex cryptographic protocols. A geometric one-way function Some of the geometric cryptographic methods are based on the impossibility of trisecting an angle using ruler and compass. Given an arbitrary angle, there is a straightforward ruler and compass construction for finding the triple of the given angle. But there is no ruler and compass construction for finding the angle which is exact one-third of an arbitrary angle. Hence the function which assigns the triple of an angle to a given angle can be thought of as a one-way function, the only constructions allowed being ruler and compass constructions. A geometric identification protocol A geometric identification protocol has been suggested based on the one-way function indicated above. Assume that Alice wishes to establish a means of proving her identity later to Bob. Initialization: Alice publishes a copy of an angle YA which is constructed by Alice as the triple of an angle XA she has constructed at random. Because trisecting an angle is impossible Alice is confident that she is the only one who knows XA. Identification Protocol: #Alice gives Bob a copy of an angle R which she has constructed as the triple of an angle K that she has selected at random. #Bob flips a coin and tells Alice the result. #If Bob says \\"heads\\" Alice gives Bob a copy of the angle K and Bob checks that 3*K = R. #If Bob says \\"tails\\" Alice gives Bob a copy of the angle L = K + XA and Bob checks that 3*L = R + YA. The four steps are repeated t times independently. Bob accepts Alice's proof of identity only if all t checks are successful. This protocol is an interactive proof of knowledge of the angle XA (the identity of Alice) with error 2‚àít. The protocol is also zero-knowledge.

Considered as one of Bulgaria's top freestyle wrestlers in his decade, Paslar has claimed two career medals (one gold and one bronze) in the 69 and 74-kg division at the World Championships (2001 and 2005), and later represented his nation Bulgaria at the 2004 Summer Olympics. Throughout his sporting career, Paslar trained full time as a member of the wrestling squad for Slavia Sports Club in Sofia under his personal coach Ilian Stefanov. As a naturalized member of the Bulgarian squad, Paslar emerged into the international scene at the 2001 World Wrestling Championships in Sofia, where he thrashed Iranian wrestler Amir Tavakkolian for the gold in the 69-kg division. For displaying his early success to the sport, Paslar was highly acclaimed the Best Wrestler of the Year by the Bulgarian Sports Federation and the International Federation of Associated Wrestling (FILA). At the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Paslar qualified for his first Bulgarian team in the men's 74 kg class with an unforeseen result. Unable to fill an available spot from the World Championships, Paslar luckily received a ticket to the Olympics by defeating Georgia's Gela Saghirashvili for a first-place finish at the Olympic Qualification Tournament in Sofia. Paslar could not pull a 3‚Äì3 tie to overwhelm Poland's Krystian Brzozowski on his opening match, but eclipsed the neighboring Macedonia's Sihamir Osmanov with a 3‚Äì1 victory to close the round-robin. Finishing second in the prelim pool and eleventh overall, Paslar's performance fell short to advance him further into the quarterfinals. Determined to offer another shot of a medal from a four-year drought, Paslar had picked up a gold in the 74-kg division at the 2005 European Championships in Varna, and a bronze at the World Championships in Budapest, Hungary. He continued to flourish his sporting career at the next World and European Championships, but left them empty-handed before his impending retirement in 2007. In 2013, Paslar came out of retirement from the sport to compete again for the World Championships in Budapest. Fighting at ten kilograms heavier than his previous sporting years, Paslar qualified for the men's light heavyweight category, but made an unprecedented exit with a 5‚Äì0 loss to Georgian wrestler and 2012 Olympian Dato Marsagishvili in his opening match.

Many new furniture companies are now joining the furniture industry. Our handmade furniture is in high demand by high-end customers. Pakistani furniture manufacturers have expertise in this area, due to the type of wood used namely 'sheesham' (rosewood) which adds to this furniture's demand. The leading wood-furniture-making areas of Pakistan are Chiniot, Gujrat, Peshawar, Lahore and Karachi. Impact of increased consumer spending Consumer spending increased by an average of 26% - per the Bloomberg‚Äôs report, which was published on November 21, 2013. It‚Äôs not only that the Fast-moving consumer goods (FMCGs) companies get benefits from increased consumer spending; the furniture manufacturers also benefit from it. Pakistan‚Äôs furniture exports As per World Trade Organization‚Äôs statistics, the wooden furniture exports of Pakistan reportedly amounted to almost $51 million in the calendar year (CY) 2011.http://tribune.com.pk/story/520366/pakistans-furniture-makers-in-need-of- international-attention/, The Express Tribune newspaper, Published 14 March 2013, Retrieved 17 July 2016 Whereas, in 2009-2010 the furniture exports of Pakistan ranged between $25 million to $30 million (excluding undocumented exports of an approximate amount of $10 million). However, according to the All Pakistan Furniture Exporters Association (APFEA) founder Mr. Turhan Baig Muhammad, these exports represent a very small portion of the total furniture business of the country. According to him, the local furniture market is almost 50 times stronger than that of the exports. Keeping this in view, the approximate total furniture sale of the country is more than $2.5 billion. Fears for the furniture industry of Pakistan Total world trade of furniture is estimated to be $23.2 billion. Wood furniture accounts for 77 percent, metal furniture 17 percent, and plastic furniture 6 percent of the total. In 2010, the share of Pakistan in the international furniture market is trivial. Even though the country takes pride in having a history of craftsmanship, it does not share a significant position in the international wood furniture market.http://tribune.com.pk/story/19304/prospects-and-fears- for-pakistans-furniture-industry/ 'Fears for Pakistan's furniture industry', The Express Tribune newspaper, Published 7 June 2010, Retrieved 17 July 2016 Domestic furniture industry is suffering because furniture exports to Pakistan from some other countries have increased, whereas, the high cost of furniture- making business is increasing problems for the local furniture manufacturers. The prices of raw materials which includes timber, colour paints, chipboard, polish materials, and foams have increased manifold. Due to unchecked deforestation, timber production of the country is also suffering. Wood furniture industry of Pakistan is categorised as being small because old obsolete machinery is used in this industry, which is the reason for higher cost and low output. Traditional wood furniture in Pakistan is heavy and bulky. Pakistani furniture industry needs to go to light-weight and moveable furniture to be exported to the world market where demand is high to meet the needs of offices, shopping malls, buildings and shopping plazas. Pakistan furniture council urges the government to bar furniture imports. Mostly, office furniture, bar stools, visitor chairs are imported from other countries and there is a huge demand for these products in Pakistan. Chinioti Furniture A large amount of the Pakistan‚Äôs furniture demand is met by Chinioti furniture.

In this regard, FIEDMC has joined hands with the European-based IKEA company, the world's largest furniture retailer that designs and sells ready-to-assemble furniture, for the development of the furniture city in Faisalabad.

The country does not lack resources and skills when it comes to manufacturing quality furniture.

Specifications The successor of Sony Alpha 77 model, the Sony Alpha 77 II is similar in design to its antecedent, including the use of a SLT transparent mirror and electronic viewfinder.

Boesen that follows the latter's adventures with his 60-year-old parents at the \\"infamous\\", annual Burning Man arts festival in Black Rock Desert. Their journey takes them on a road-trip from Vancouver, British Columbia to northern Nevada in a 35-foot school bus. It provides an \\"intimate, behind-the-scenes look at the preparation for, the journey to and the adventures at the least-likely family vacation imaginable.\\" Selling out seven consecutive screenings, it won the Audience Choice Award for Best Documentary at both the 2014 Sonoma International Film Festival, where it had its world premiere, and the 2014 Newport Beach Film Festival. It also won the Micro-Budget Feature Award at the 2014 Maui Film Festival. It held its Canadian premiere at the Rio Theatre in May 2014. Production Boesen wanted to make a documentary about Burning Man, \\"so that the people that won't make it here; people like my parents, can see what it's all about and we'll try to define it for a bunch of people who have never been.\\" According to Boesen, it was his parents' decision to attend Burning Man, \\"I already wanted to shoot a documentary about the event and asked them [Charles and Lilice] if I could follow them on their adventure with a camera.\\" Boesen approached McCarthy while the two were finishing film school to make the documentary. In April 2012, after McCarthy maxed out two credit cards, he and Boesen launched a crowdfunding campaign on Kickstarter. After successfully raising over $10,000, Kickstarter refused to deliver payment due to an \\"administrative glitch\\" and despite Boesen having proof of being a dual US/Canadian citizen. The incident is incorporated into the feature. In December 2012 they relaunched their campaign, this time using indiegogo and again reached their $10,000 goal. About 40 hours of footage was shot, including on-location from August 27 to September 3, 2012, with the approval of Black Rock City, LLC. Reaction Peter Mehlman described it as, \\"Funny, oddly heart-warming and beautifully produced. But most importantly, this fim portrays Burning Man honestly.\\" Fellow Vancouver filmmakers the Soska sisters called it, \\"A truly moving, honest piece that bridges the generation gap and brings people together in the real spirit of Burning Man.\\" Chelsea Rush praised its depiction of the family bonding, \\"that can't help but tug at your heartstrings,\\" and that it, \\"truly grasps the experience of Burning Man.\\" Tommy Cook, although liking it, mentions it becomes, \\"an exercise in creativity-shunned, where the only answer to rampant corporate greed and the monotony of the '9 to 5' is to regress back to a constant state of adolescence.\\" References Category:2014 documentary films Category:Canadian documentary films Category:Canadian films Category:Documentary films about Burning Man Category:Films shot in Nevada Category:Documentary films about families Category:Kickstarter-funded documentaries Category:Indiegogo projects ","title":"Taking My Parents to Burning Man"},{"id":"43118997","text":"Hans Van de Bovenkamp (born 1938) is a Dutch-born American sculptor. Van de Bovenkamp was born in Garderen, Holland in 1938 and immigrated to the United States in 1958. He is best known for his large scale abstract work in bronze, stainless steel, painted steel, and aluminum. Van de Bovenkamp's works are often influenced by myth, symbol, and nature. He is a member of the International Sculpture Center, the New York Sculptors Guild, and the Royal Society of British Sculptors. Early life Hans Van de Bovenkamp was born in Garderen, Holland to parents Maria Johanna Le Jeu and Jan Albertus van de Bovenkamp in 1938. Van de Bovenkamp studied at the School of Architecture in Amsterdam, Netherlands until 1961. Following his parents emigration to Ontario, Canada, Van de Bovenkamp came to the United States to attend the University of Michigan in 1958. In 1958, during his first year of university, he was an apprentice for Richard Jennings, a sculptor of large kinetic fountains. Van de Bovenkamp studied with Joseph Goto, a sculptor and master welder from 1958 until 1961. Career Hans Van de Bovenkamp with Red Oracle Van de Bovenkamp moved to New York City and became a part of the 10th street gallery co-op movement following his graduation from the University of Michigan in 1961. In 1962, his first solo exhibit took place at the Little Gallery in Taos, New Mexico. The following year, Van de Bovenkamp developed sculptural ideas for the windows of Tiffany's on Fifth Avenue. Van de Bovenkamp began manufacturing limited edition fountains in a studio on Christopher Street in New York in 1967. He had fifteen assistants, including George Rhoads and Sybil and David Yurman. Together they produced more than five thousand fountains worldwide. Over the next ten years, Van de Bovenkamp exhibited his sculptures throughout the United States, including in New York City at New York University, Tiffany & Co., 10 Downtown, and Bryant Park; at Houston, Texas Contemporary Arts Museum; and at both the Stamford Museum and University of Connecticut. He is the founder of the New York's 10 Downtown project. His work has also been displayed in Italy, Lebanon, Venezuela, Switzerland, and Canada. Van de Bovenkamp's works have been featured in ten museums, embassies, and sculpture center shows, as well as numerous universities, public gardens and institutes. Kevin Miller has been Van de Bovenkamp's assistant since 1995. Van de Bovenkamp received his first commission in 1966 to design a copper fountain made of cubist shapes for the Georgetown Plaza, at Eight Street and Broadway in Manhattan with his brother, Gerrit. He received another commission to create a sculpture on a highway stop along Nebraska's Interstate 80 to commemorate the United States Bicentennial in 1976. The sculpture has intersecting curving pathways of metal near the ground, then sends dual angled shafts, symbolizing road travel, approximately forty feet into the sky. This project, Highway Confluence, was funded primarily by private contributions with additional financial support from the state government. Van de Bovenkamp was commissioned to create the Mariner's Gateway in 1968. The sculpture is located on the Hudson River in Haverstraw, New York. On September 9, 2000, the Danubiana Portal and 16 additional Van de Bovenkamp sculptures were purchased for the opening of the Danubiana Meulensteen Art Museum in Slovakia. Van de Bovenkamp began his \\"Menhirs\\" sculpture series in 2001. The sculptures consist of stacked balanced shapes. Hans was influenced by the piled boulders and stones from Stonehenge in England, the Baths at Virgin Gorda, and desert landscapes and conservation areas worldwide. In 2002, Van de Bovenkamp moved to the Twins Oak Farm, a horse farm in Sagaponack, New York. He renovated the barns and buildings into his home, studio, and gallery. Most of the horse pastures were turned into landscapes for sculptures. He also created a sculpture garden on the grounds of Twins Oak Farm. Van de Bovenkamp has work in the permanent collections of the City University of New York, Stony Brook University, Texas A&M; University, University of Missouri, Jing'an Park in China, Mount Sinai Medical Center, and the Butler Institute of University Art Museum. Van de Bovenkamp's sculptures are also a part of private collection of the Rockefeller family corporate collections including Neiman Marcus, the Georgetown Plaza building, the Hyatt Regency, the Louis K. Meisel gallery and the Manhattan house. Art created by Van de Bovenkamp has been featured in group and solo exhibitions including exhibitions at the Contemporary Arts Museum Houston, the Oakland Museum of California, the Chicago Fair, the Shanghai Art Fair, the Bernarducci Meisel Gallery and the Sculpturesite Galleries. Van de Bovenkamp served on the advisory board of the Institute for Symbolic Studies and the Omega Institute for Holistic Studies. He is currently represented by Louis K. Meisel Gallery, New York, New York, Gary Nader Gallery, Miami, Florida, Baker Sponder Gallery, Boca Raton, Florida, Sculpturesite, Sonoma, California, and Samuel Lynne Galleries, Dallas, Texas. Influence Van de Bovenkamp's ideas about creating effect through scale were inspired by his studies of stele and other sculptural structures of ancient cultures during his travels to Mexico, North Africa, India, and Nepal. Awards Van de Bovenkamp was awarded the Lowe sculpture award in 1964 for a \\"weldage\\" made of metal shapes. In 1976, he exhibited at the American Institute of Arts and Letters, and won the Nebraska Bicentennial Sculpture Competition in Sydney, Nebraska. Van de Bovenkamp won the Sanctuary Design Competition sponsored by the Omega Holistic Health Institute, in Rhinebeck, New York in 1996.

Life  Isaac was one of at least six brothers of Theodore I Laskaris, and had been honoured by the latter with the title of sebastokrator, a title habitually bestowed on brothers of the emperor. When Theodore I died in November 1221, he had no male heirs, and was succeeded by the husband of his eldest daughter, John III Vatatzes. This development displeased Theodore's brothers, and Isaac, together with his brother Alexios, also a sebastokrator, fled to the Latin Empire, taking along with them Theodore's daughter Eudokia, Shortly before his death, Theodore had tried to arrange a marriage between Eudokia and the Latin Emperor, Robert of Courtenay, and the brothers evidently hoped to use her to secure Latin assistance against Vatatzes. In the end, the marriage did not come to pass. Two other brothers, Michael and Manuel, also sought exile during John III's reign, perhaps in connection with the defection of Alexios and Isaac, but later returned to Nicaea and were active in the reign of John III's son, Theodore II Laskaris. Robert did, however, provide refuge and an appropriate place in his court to the two brothers, with whom he was related through the marriage of his sister Maria to Theodore Laskaris. Furthermore, one of the two brothers had already had considerable contact with the Latin court, having spent time at Constantinople as a prisoner ca. 1220‚Äì21. This act soured relations between Nicaea and the Latins, and in 1224 the two brothers Alexios and Isaac found themselves at the head of the Latin army sent to confront Vatatzes. In the resulting Battle of Poimanenon in 1224, however, Vatatzes secured a decisive success: in a hard-fought battle, the Latin army was defeated, the brothers were captured, and Vatatzes proceeded to reduce most of the fortresses the Latins held in northwestern Asia Minor.

Kelm tried to cross the border by swimming across the Havel river, but drowned during the attempt. Kelm was one of only eight women victims, and at the age of 53, was one of the oldest victims of the Berlin Wall. Biography Erna Kelm was born on July 21 1908 in Frankfurt an der Oder, German Empire. Kelm had at least two children and lived in Potsdam, but in 1947, shortly after the end of World War II, she illegally moved to L√ºbeck to work as a nurse. At the time Germany was occupied by the Allies, with Potsdam in the Soviet zone and L√ºbeck in the British Zone, Kelm moved without obtaining the necessary permit issued by the occupying powers. In 1948, a year later, she moved to West Berlin, taking a job as a nurse's aide in a children's home for refugees. Kelm frequently left West Berlin to visit her children in neighboring Potsdam, where she was \\"suspected of engaging in intelligence activities,\\" according to Soviet police data, but this accusation remained unconfirmed. However, the suspicion led to her being interrogated by East German authorities in November 1953, and a hearing in December 1953, after which she moved back to Potsdam. In her own words, Kelm returned because she missed her children, and began working as the director of a special care home/facility. Death On the morning of June 11, 1962, a fisherman found Kelm's body in the River Havel in Berlin-Zehlendorf, West Berlin. Her East German identification card, hidden in her sock, identified her as Erna Kelm from Sacrow, 53 years old, born on July 21, 1908 in Frankfurt an der Oder. Evidence suggested that she had tried to swim across the Havel to West Berlin, as the middle of the river formed the local border between East Germany and West Berlin. Berlin-Zehlendorf and Sacrow, an area of Potsdam just north of the main town where Kelm had lived, were both sparsely populated with minimal presence of the Berlin Wall and the East German border guards. Kelm was carrying other personal documents in a waterproof plastic bag on her body, and was also wearing a life jacket under her clothes. The investigation by the West Berlin police ended with the result that Erna Kelm drowned while trying to escape, and no crime was committed against her. Kelm's body was handed over to her relatives in Potsdam at their request. There was no trace of the body after it was transported to Potsdam, and nothing is known about the relatives of Erna Kelm or where she is buried. Even the West Berlin investigation, which documented the retrieval of the body from the water, was closed shortly thereafter and the file was sent to the Central Registry Office in Salzgitter. When the case was re-opened 30 years later, the original investigation findings were confirmed. Erna Kelm was one of only eight women killed at the Berlin wall, among the total of at least 140 victims. Further, of all the Berlin Wall victims that were classified as escapees/attempted escapees, Kelm was probably the only one who attempted to escape for totally unknown reasons. Aftermath In West Berlin, there were several press reports about her death, but these reports were given little attention. The main focus of the press at the time was over general concern regarding the rising tensions in Berlin as the Warsaw Pact members had submitted a statement announcing plans to sign a separate peace treaty with East Germany if American-Soviet talks were not able to \\"normalize\\" the situation in West Berlin and remove the \\"occupying regime.\\" The Soviet Union even sent a note of protest to the three western Allies, strongly criticizing the involvement of West Berlin police in border incidents at the Berlin Wall. Kelm was admitted to the official list of the victims of the Berlin Wall and in a brochure published by the Bundesministerium f√ºr innerdeutsche Beziehungen (Federal Ministry for Intra- German Relations) on the first anniversary of the Berlin Wall. This brochure mentioned her fatal escape attempt; this ensured the memory of the 53-year-old woman who drowned at the border to West Berlin was preserved.\\" Erna Kelm's \\"Chronic der Mauer\\" biographyErna Kelm, Chronic der Mauer, accessed June 22, 2014 has existed since at least 2007, according to the Internet Archive. However, her photoPhoto of Erna Kelm, Chronic der Mauer, accessed June 22, 2014 , listed as from a private collection, has only been added recently (as of 2014). This suggests that as of 2014, she still has immediately family alive that remember her.

That same year the name changed to Klub Sportowy Wƒôglowiec. In 1949 another name change meant that the club was called KS G√≥rnik. In 1955 a merger of the club with another local team W≈Ç√≥kniarz Nowa Ruda caused the new club to become ZKS Piast Nowa Ruda, a name which became legally recognised in 1957. Under the decision of the Minister of Mining and Energy in 1972 another merger took place when the local mine in Nowa Ruda was merged with another mine in S≈Çupiec to become one, which meant that its two football teams also merged, therefore ZKS G√≥rnik S≈Çupiec merged with Piast to become GKS Piast Nowa Ruda before finally reverting it original prefix KS in 1992, a name which remains to this day. The club's biggest footballing achievements came in the mid-1980s and early 1990s where the team has enjoyed spells in the higher leagues, including a season in the second highest division and several in the third tier.

The grinden reached their greatest extent in the early 19th century when they ran from the Kniebis mountain near Freudenstadt in the south to the heights near Dobel in the north. Today they are restricted to the highest parts of the Northern Black Forest around the summits of the Hornisgrinde, Schliffkopf and Kniebis (900 to ). They still cover an area of about 180 ha. Conservation measures and careful grazing by robust breeds of cattle (especially the Hinterwald), goats and sheep should enable the remaining grinden to be preserved for their great ecological value and as an important feature of the landscape. Most of them are under conservation orders.  Derivation and meaning of the word  The German term \\"Grinde\\" comes from Old High German and is related to the Swabian-Alemannic word \\"Grind\\", which means something like \\"bald head\\". This term was used to refer to the treeless summits of the region.  Emergence and usage  The grinden emerged mainly as a result of human influence. The growth of the population in the 14th century meant that the pastures of the Black Forest valleys were no longer sufficient for the grazing of cattle. For this reason, cattle and goats were driven to pasture on the flat highlands with their open stands of trees. The so-called Weidbrennen or pasture-burning at the end of the grazing year hindered the growth of trees, promoted the growth of grass and increased the areas for grazing. Through the use of the highlands as pasture the land nearer the villages could be used for the production of hay. However overgrazing of the highlands led to soil compaction and a loss of nutrients by the 16th century. The result was that the land became waterlogged and bogs formed due to the high level of precipitation of up to 2,200 mm/year. These processes led to the formation of the grinden. Grazing on the grinden lasted for 500 years until the 19th century. in the mid-18th century Weidbrennen had led to such large scale destruction of the forest that it was banned. With the emergence of cattle sheds, the grazing came to an end. The grinden, however, continued to be used for making hay, especially from matgrass (Nardus stricta), which the farmers believed had healing properties for the animals. In the mid-1950s, with the decline of cattle grazing, even this form of farming was increasingly abandoned. With the end of the agricultural use of the grinden the forest began to gradually re-establish itself. In addition to a natural reforestation by the natural seeding of pine trees, especially mountain pine, the areas were also reforested in a managed way from the 18th century. The grinden on the Enz heights were thus reforested by the 19th century.  Flora and fauna  The grinden lie on nutrient-poor soils of the main conglomerate of the bunter sandstone, which has a major effect on the characteristic grinde ecology. Typical plants: matgrass, German deergrass, moor grass, heather, bilberry, cowberry, bog bilberry, mountain pine, peat moss and cottongrass. Typical animals: capercaillie ruffed grouse.

In the 4th century, the tzange was a type of elegant shoe, but its use as an imperial vestment in Byzantium only began later, and was influenced by eastern, most likely, Persian, usage. Thus the first occurrence of the tzangia as a sign of royal power is in John Malalas' description of the coronation of Tzath I as king of Lazica under Justin I, where Tzath was dressed in Roman imperial garb, but wore tzangia, decorated with pearls \\"in the Persian manner\\", rather than the Roman emperor's kothornoi. By the 9th century, the wearing of red tzangia had become firmly associated with the imperial office, so much so that rebels putting them on signified their usurpation of the imperial title. In the mid-14th century, Pseudo-Kodinos reports that the tzangia were tall boots decorated with eagles out of pearls and precious stones. The term is the root for the Greek term for shoemaker, tsangaris (œÑœÉŒ±Œ≥Œ∫Œ¨œÅŒ∑œÇ), via tzangarios (œÑŒ∂Œ±Œ≥Œ≥Œ¨œÅŒπŒøœÇ), although a maker of imperial tzangia was called tzangas (œÑŒ∂Œ±Œ≥Œ≥Œ¨œÇ).

It was first recorded by Attitudes, a band consisting of Kortchmar, Paul Stallworth, Jim Keltner and David Foster, who met while backing George Harrison on his album Extra Texture (Read All About It). It was released on Attitudes' self-titled debut album in 1976. It was also released as a promotional single on Harrison's Dark Horse Records label. The lyrics of \\"Honey Don't Leave L.A.\\" are a plea to an \\"errant paramour.\\" Following a live solo performance in 2013, Kortchmar noted that he \\"was trying to be sensitive. We were all trying to be sensitive back then.\\" \\"Honey Don't Leave L.A.\\" was later covered by James Taylor, for whom it became a minor hit. Taylor included his version of \\"Honey Don't Leave L.A.\\" on his 1977 album JT. David Sanborn played saxophone on the track. It was also released as the third single from the album, following \\"Handy Man\\" and \\"Your Smiling Face,\\" which both reached the Top 20 of the Billboard Hot 100. Released more than six months after \\"Your Smiling Face\\" in February 1978. the \\"Honey Don't Leave L.A.\\" single did not perform as well, peaking at #61. It also reached #63 in Canada. Background Kortchmar, who played guitar on Taylor's JT album encouraged Taylor to record \\"Honey Don't Leave L.A.\\" Kortchmar later told Musician that he regretted having encouraged Taylor to record \\"more rock 'n' roll songs like 'Honey Don't Leave L.A.'\\" because that was not Taylor's forte. However, Taylor enjoyed recording the song, and his recording received praise from critics. Taylor biographer Timothy White described it as \\"humorous\\" and as \\"one of JTs best uptempo tracks.\\" Billboard described it as the \\"funkiest\\" of JTs three singles. Billboard particularly praised Sanborn's saxophone for adding to the track's \\"enthusiasm\\" and the \\"playful\\" way Taylor sang some French phrases, comparing his approach to the way Ray Charles and Stevie Wonder incorporated French phrases into contemporary recordings. Rolling Stone critic Peter Herbst describes the song as \\"seething\\" and praises Taylor as \\"a pretty convincing rock singer\\" on the track. Herbst particularly praises Taylor's \\"rough\\" and \\"authoritative\\" singing on the line \\"They don't know nothing down in St. Tropez.\\" Authors Don and Jeff Breithaupt described it as \\"chunky, soulful rock.\\" Seattle Post-Intelligencer critic James Arellano described it as a \\"fun and unexpected selection\\" from the compilation album The Essential James Taylor. \\"Honey Don't Leave L.A.\\" became a popular song in Taylor's live concerts, often with Sanborn playing saxophone. Taylor played the song as part of his set for the No Nukes concert at Madison Square Garden in September 1979, and it was included in the 1980 live album of the concert. Juan Rodriguez of The Montreal Gazette called the song one of the highlights of the album. Allmusic critic William Ruhlmann lamented the exclusion of \\"Honey Don't Leave L.A.\\" from Taylor's 2000 compilation album Greatest Hits Volume 2, but the song was included on the 2013 compilation album The Essential James Taylor.

The fortification was expanded to its current state between 1801 and 1808. It was also used as a check point until the abolishment of the sound dues in 1857. Following the outbreak of World War I, a base for seaplanes and submarines opened on the peninsula in 1916. After the end of the war, it was only used sporadically by small naval vessels and aircraft. During World War II, Slipshavn was used by the occupying German forces.

Early life  Jewkes was born in the United States on the 9th of October, 1913. After World War I, he and his parents travelled to Birmingham and there, he won a scholarship to study at Dudley Grammar School. At Northampton Institute and the London Polytechnic, he studied architecture and engineering before being hired as the chief engineer of British Steel Construction. He was associated with both the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) as well as the Institute of Civil Engineers in London. In 1941, Jewkes came to Malaysia to join the Public Works Department (PWD). He served first in the districts of Krian and Keroh. He was then asked to become the head of the new Design and Research Branch. Subsequently, Jewkes became the Director of the Public Works Department from 1959 to 1962. Soon after coming to Malaysia, war broke out in the peninsula and he was made a lieutenant in the Federated Malay States Volunteer Force. in 2001, he compiled and published his philosophical rumination about his life in relation to his own encounters in a book named ‚ÄúHumankind: Planet Earth‚Äôs Most Enigmatic Species‚Äù. At 98 years of age, Jewkes died peacefully at the Mission Oaks Hospice in Oxford, Florida on the 19th of June, 2011. He left behind his wife Ella, and their two children, Carole and Peter.  Buildings  Of the many buildings that he had designed and/or engineered, his most famous works are located at the Petaling Hill. *Merdeka Park *Stadium Merdeka *Stadium Negara  Contributions  With his help, he made sure that the PWD‚Äôs engineering department capabilities were on par with most developed nations in the world. He also reworked and clarified traffic circulations around the city, as well as supervised the construction of Klang Gates Dam for KL‚Äôs water supply. He even determined the site of the dam after extensive surveys. At the same time of being the Director of the PWD, Jewkes managed to find time to teach Advanced Engineering at the KL Technical College. He guided a whole generation of local engineers at PWD who would take over after his retirement from Malaysia. He was even responsible for the awarding of overseas engineering scholarships based on meritocracy rather than on race. As for his buildings, the Stadium Merdeka won an award given by the Badan Warisan Malaysia for having the tallest prestressed structure in the world during that time with the 140 feet tall lighting towers, as well as having one of the longest cantilevered shell roofs in the world.

On 2 September, the British fifty gun fourth rate HMS Chatham under Captain Andrew Snape Douglas was cruising off Cape Ann near Boston harbour and spotted the French frigate Magicienne, escorting a merchantman. She was a thirty six gun 800 ton frigate that was serving in comte d'Orvilliers fleet and was commanded by Captain Janvre de la Boucheti√®re with 280 men. Douglas ordered action stations, and the Chatham hove to and after a few hours chase opened the action; she overtook the French frigate. The London Gazette claims that after an hour's action, the Chatham got the better of the French and Magicienne soon struck; The New York gazette of 22 October 1781 gives a figure of 2 hours and a half, of which half at pistol range, and Magicienne only struck after her rudder and bowsprit were shot away. The Chatham had one man killed and one wounded while losses on the Magicienne were heavy; the London Gazette gives a figure of 32 killed and 54 wounded, while the New York Gazette states that 155 were killed or wounded, including Ensign Dethan, killed, and Captain de la Boucheti√®re, wounded. The rest of the crew was taken prisoner. She was subsequently taken to Halifax and recommissioned in the Royal Navy as HMS Magicienne. Sagittaire, Astr√©e and Hermione, which were anchored at Boston, scrambled in an attempt to support Magicienne, but they failed to arrive on time, and Chatam could escape with her prize. The merchantman that Magicienne was escorting managed to escape Chatam and arrived safely in a French-held harbour. Subsequently the action thwarted a planned French assault on British ships in the Saint John River.

Both countries were part of the Spanish Empire until the early 19th century. Mexico was part of Viceroyalty of New Spain while Bolivia was at first part of the Viceroyalty of Peru and then in 1776, it became part of the Viceroyalty of the R√≠o de la Plata. Soon after independence, both nations established diplomatic relations. In 1831, Mexico sent its first concurrent ambassador to Bolivia based in Buenos Aires, Argentina. In September 1902, the first Mexican consulate-general was opened in La Paz and thus the first official diplomatic mission of Mexico in the country. In 1934, Bolivia opened its first diplomatic mission in Mexico City.

The most prominent asylee at the embassy was Dr. Antonio Arguedas Mendieta, a Bolivian national and former Minister of the Interior who in 1968 arranged for copies of Che Guevara's captured diaries to be smuggled to Havana, Cuba after his death in Bolivia in October 1967. When the government of President Ren√© Barrientos discovered the documents to be missing, it was discovered that Dr. Arguedas Mendieta was a CIA agent who had been recruited to destroy Che Guevara's forces in the country, but he was soon to become disenchanted with the Bolivian government and decided to send Guevara's diaries to Cuba. Dr. Arguedas Mendieta was accused by the Bolivian State for selling state secrets and in July 1969, Dr. Arguedas Mendieta sought asylum in the Mexican embassy where he remained until May 1970 when he was granted safe-conduct out of Bolivia to Mexico.The Guardian: Maverick Bolivian linked to the repression of Che Guevara's guerrillas and publication of his diaries In 1960, Mexican President Adolfo L√≥pez Mateos had planned to visit Bolivia, however, his visit was suspended by force majeure.President Adolfo L√≥pez Mateos cancels visit to Bolivia (in Spanish) In 1963, President V√≠ctor Paz Estenssoro became the first Bolivian head-of-state to visit Mexico.

Referencing Christian von Ehrenfels' distinction between cultural and natural sexual morality, Freud explains the etiological significance of cultural sexual morality as a reason for neurosis. At the beginning, Freud states that cultural sexual mores impose constraints on the individual, which can cause damage to the person, which in turn threatens the culture as a whole. While von Ehrenfels argues primarily on the basis of Social Darwinism, saying social sexual morality may prevent male sexual selection in reproduction, Freud focuses on the consequences of socially-imposed repression of the sexual instinct as a cause of neurosis.However, Freud does not contradict Ehrenfels on this point, thereby supporting the latter's social Social Darwinist model. Culture is based on renunciation of drives. There is therefore a tension between a person's body, which seeks fulfilment of drives, and the demands of culture to renounce desire. Those who cannot conform to these requirements imposed by society are either viewed as criminals and perverts - if they cannot fulfil society's demand for renunciation - or escape into neurosis when the drives are suppressed to such an extent that neurotic substitute pleasures are developed in their stead. Neurosis is thus the negative counterpart of perversion, \\"because they [neurotics] have the same appetites as the positive perverts in a 'repressed' state.\\"At this point Freud comments on the gender differences between neurosis and perversion, and writes of neurosis in women and perversion in men. This is explained by a weaker sex drive in women. However, Freud himself states that as a woman is subject to a more strict upbringing and rigorous instruction than a man, she needs to practice more abstinence than a man. Nevertheless, he interprets the \\"weak sex drive\\" in women as a biological fact and not a result of socialization. Freud said that the \\"perverse\\" part of the libido is caused by a disturbance in development. The libido was originally meant for deriving pleasure, not only at the genitals but also at other erogenous zones; but education has the purpose of limiting autoeroticism and directing love towards objects other than oneself, finally achieving the \\"primacy of genitals put into the service of procreation\\". Thus Freud was one of the first people who said that sexuality by itself does not generate any internal conflict, and explained that the conflict arises only through interaction with the outside world, with its social norms and its expectation of repression of instincts, which leads to disease (repression thesis). The suppressed perverse drives are ideally channeled through sublimation and harnessed for cultural work. The sex drive in humans is aperiodicHere Freud goes back to referring to the smell stimulus and the taboo of menstruation. and is divorced from reproduction. Therefore, it can be metonymically shifted and applied to other areas. Thus, culture benefits to a great extent - and is even dependent - on sexual energy that is redirected through sublimation. Therefore, Freud concluded that a complete renunciation of the sex drive is detrimental to culture. Abstinence only produces \\"brave weaklings\\",This statement underlines all sorts of remarks by Freud on homosexuality and masturbation, which allegedly lead to impotence in marriage. but not great thinkers with bold ideas.At this point there is a conflict with the goal of psychotherapy: Perversion is to be \\"cured\\", but at the same time the therapist is also aware that perversion is useful for culture. Freud thus describes the dilemma of culture, which simultaneously calls for renunciation while still needing the sexual instinct to preserve itself. The repression model that imposes cultural sexual morality should therefore be abandoned in favor of a sublimation, displacement, and distribution model of sexual energies.

Harrington sold it to Mary Home, Countess of Home, a cousin of Lady Bedford, in 1621. The property was acquired from the Countess of Home by Sir Thomas Nott, a Royalist Army officer, in 1640. Nott remained there until 1659 when he sold it to a Mr Henry Murray. In 1668 Murray sold it to John Berkeley, 1st Baron Berkeley of Stratton, another Royalist Army officer, who died in 1678. In 1685 the Berkeley family sold the property to Robert Brudenell, 2nd Earl of Cardigan. The property was then bought by Sir Thomas Vernon, Member of Parliament for Whitchurch, in 1698 and by Algernon Coote, 6th Earl of Mountrath in 1743. In 1766 the property passed to the Harriet Pelham-Holles, Duchess of Newcastle-upon-Tyne, who set about mixed farming in the park, and in 1788 it passed to Lord Frederick Cavendish, a British Army officer. Following Cavendish's death in October 1803 the house passed to Sir William Abdy, 7th Baronet. Abdy sold the house at auction to Francis Gosling who in turn demolished it in 1809.

Butterfield grew up in Westborough, Massachusetts and played college baseball for Maine in the early 1950s and later was the head coach at Maine and South Florida. In the late 1970s, he became an executive in the New York Yankees organization before he died in a car crash in November 1979. Coaching career =Maine= Butterfield's coaching career began at Maine in 1956, when he assisted head coach Walter Anderson and coached the school's junior varsity team. For the 1957 season, Butterfield was named the head coach. He held the position from 1957‚Äì1974 and compiled an overall record of 240-169-2. Maine's best season under Butterfield was 1964, when the team went 21-8 and won the Yankee Conference outright to qualify for the program's first NCAA Tournament. In the best-of-three District 1 Regional held in Boston, Maine swept Northeastern in two games to advance to the College World Series. There, Maine won its opening game against Seton Hall, 5-1, before dropping its second to Minnesota, 12-0. In the loser's bracket, the Black Bears defeated Arizona State and USC but were eliminated by Missouri and finished third. Butterfield was named NCAA Coach of the Year, and Joe Ferris was named the tournament's Most Outstanding Player. In Butterfield's 17 seasons at Maine, the team won eight Maine State Series (a competition between Maine, Bowdoin, Colby, and Bates) and shared three other Yankee Conference titles, but did not qualify for another NCAA Tournament. Butterfield's players at Maine included Major Leaguers John Cumberland and Bert Roberge, college head coach Jack Leggett, baseball executive Bill Livesey, and New York Yankees manager Carl \\"Stump\\" Merrill. Butterfield coined Merrill's nickname during his freshman season in 1963. =South Florida= Following the 1974 season, Butterfield left Maine to become the head coach at South Florida (USF), in part due to tension with Maine's administration over the program's funding. He coached at USF for two seasons (1975‚Äì1976) and had an overall record of 61-24-1. At USF, future Toronto Blue Jays manager Carlos Tosca was Butterfield's equipment manager. =Head coaching record= Below is a table of Butterfield's yearly records as a collegiate head baseball coach.

The following year, he was named the organization's Director of Player Development and Scouting, a position he served in for the next three seasons. Death Early on November 16, 1979, Butterfield was killed in a car crash in Paramus, New Jersey. His car crashed into a street sweeper stopped on the side of road. Steinbrenner said of his death: \\"The magnitude of our loss cannot be expressed in words. He was the epitome of what you'd look for in a teacher of young men.\\" Personal =Family= Butterfield's son, Brian, played for him at Maine for one season and is currently a Major League Baseball coach for the Los Angeles Angels. Brian has also spent time as a coach with the Toronto Blue Jays and Boston Red Sox and in the Yankees and Diamondbacks minor league systems. Butterfield's brother, Jim, assisted him at Maine from 1957‚Äì1959 and later became the head football coach at Ithaca. Jim was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1997. =Awards named after= Following Butterfield's death in 1979, two awards were named for him.

A comedian, she played the title role in Pedro Bloch's production Dona Xepa and then repeated the performance in the film, adapted in 1959. Life and career At the age of 19 Alda Garrido formed with her husband, actor Am√©rico Garrido, the duo Dupla de Garridos, doing duets in S√£o Paulo until 1920. They moved to the Rio de Janeiro and organized a theater company for Teatro Am√©rica, debuting with Luar de Paquet√° by Freire Jr. in 1924, remaining successfully in theaters for six months. In 1923, the duo received an invitation to work with the entrepreneur Pascoal Segreto and his company, performing Ilha dos Amores, Quem Paga √â o Coronel, both by Freire Jr., and Francesinha do Bataclan, by Gast√£o Tojeiro, among others. The season projected Alda Garrido in such a way that she was hired by vaudeville businessman Manoel Pinto, father of Walter Pinto, to work for Companhia Nacional de Revistas, at Teatro Recreio. Alda's success in the genre makes her maintain a dual professional practice; on one side the usual comedies from her own production company, in which she works with her husband, on the other, the contracts with entrepreneurs in the vaudeville sector. But slowly, her company surrenders to the success of the musical theater, as in Brasil Pandeiro (1941), with text of her favorite author, Freire Jr. in partnership with Luiz Peixoto. In 1939, entrepreneur Walter Pinto makes Garrido and Aracy Cortes, in the show Tem Marmelada, by Carlos Bittencourt and Cardoso de Meneses, to share the stage at Teatro Recreio for the last time. Among the most successful revues of her career are Maria Gasog√™nio, satire about the shortage of gasoline in the years of World War II, and Da Favela ao Catete, (1935) by Freire Jr. and Joubert de Carvalho. The actress creates a unique style of interpretation by transforming the text into improvisations that, according to Pedro Bloch, are in reality meticulously studied beforehand. Style The 1950s enshrine Alda Garrido as Dona Xepa, a successful play (1953) by Pedro Bloch. The actress becomes the symbol of Brazilianness, as shown in the following excerpt from journalist Jota Efeg√™: \\"The market vendor Dona Xepa, right up to Alda Garridos's artistic invoice, gives rise to a spontaneous performance where her intuition prevails in the composition of the figure. Going beyond the script, Alda steps in with her precious collaboration and graft her insightful 'shards'.\\" Decio de Almeida Prado, theater critic, reveals: \\"[...] Properly, not even an actress she is. An actress is a professional specialized in not being the same person twice. Alda Garrido is none of this. Her theatrical technique in psychological characterization is the most precarious. On the other hand, she has something much rarer: a genuinely comical personality. When she performs, the comic part is never on the character, but on the artist, on what she possesses as unmistakably inimitable. What we most admire is not the play, but the very Alda Garrido, with her irreverence and madness, which allows her to always behave in a less conventional way and common sense, which makes her find the most disconcertingly prosaic answer in every situation. Alda Garrido is much more than an actress, she is a great eccentric person, like one of those comic cinema and theater American artists such as Groucho Marx, and Danny Kaye.\\" Curiosities * Alda debuts at Teatro Rival in 1912, with the play Das Cinco √Äs Sete, by Joracy Camargo, beside her husband Am√©rico Garrido. * In 1921, she starts her own theatrical company, eventually given the title \\"Queen of the Actresses\\" in 1928. * In 1940, she makes her film debut in the movie E o Circo Chegou, directed by Luiz de Barros. * In 1952, one of her plays is listed in The New York Times as one of the top ten hits of the year. * In 1953, she acts in what would be her most famous role in Dona Xepa by Peter Bloch, a play staged over 500 times, later coming to television (1977) and cinema (1953). * Alda abandons her career in 1965 with the play Entre Louras e Morenas. * In 1970, she prepares her come back on Maria Fofoca but dies before the premiere, on December 8, 1970, in Rio de Janeiro.

He served as a touring member for industrial rock act Nine Inch Nails in 2013 and has collaborated heavily over the years with Maynard James Keenan's solo project Puscifer, for which he also served as a touring member. Eustis' solo project is Sons of Magdalene, of which he began releasing music under in 2008. He is also a founding member of the band The Black Queen. Biography Eustis formed Telefon Tel Aviv with high school friend Charles Cooper in 1999. The duo released their debut album, Fahrenheit Fair Enough, in 2001 through Hefty Records. This was followed by Map of What Is Effortless in 2004 and Immolate Yourself in 2009. On January 22, 2009, Charles Cooper died, leaving the future of Telefon Tel Aviv uncertain. In 2011, Eustis co-produced Puscifer's second studio album, Conditions of My Parole. He also contributed to Puscifer's Donkey Punch the Night EP and All Re-Mixed Up remix album in 2013. In 2013, it was announced that Eustis would perform as a live member of Nine Inch Nails for the Tension 2013 tour. He mainly took the bass duties during the early tour, due to bassist Eric Avery's departure from the band. After bassist Pino Palladino's inclusion to the new line-up, he performed mainly on keyboards and different instruments accompanying key moments in some of the songs, such as the saxophone and erhu. In December 2013, it was announced that Eustis would not be performing with the band on the following 2014 tour. In 2014, Eustis announced that he would release a full-length solo debut as Sons of Magdalene, a moniker adopted in 2007, when his father was diagnosed with cancer.

Since 1972, the island has been part of the Lincoln National Park. Description Owen Island which is located approximately south-east of Port Lincoln and is located north of Taylor Island, has a maximum height of . Sandy beaches exist on the island‚Äôs west side with a submerged sand spit near the island‚Äôs south-western point. Sand dominates the island with wind-blown dunes extending beyond the limits of tide and storm surges which was reported in 1996 as ‚Äòproviding a bed for a high diversity of plants‚Äô. It is reported that the island is sheltered from the impact of the sea due to the closeness of the much larger Taylor Island plus the additional shelter offered by the mainland and other islands to the south. As of 1996, it is reported as being accessible by boat. Formation, geology and oceanography Owen Island was formed about 6000 years ago when sea levels rose at the start of the Holocene. The island is a granite outcrop capped with a residual layer of calcarenite. The island rises from the seabed at within to on its east side while on its west and south side while the same transition occurs over a distance of approximately . The passage between the island‚Äôs south coast and Taylor Island is relatively shallow with a maximum charted depth of due to both islands sharing the same geological base strata. Flora and fauna As of 1996, the flora is reported as consisting of two distinct areas. The coastal sand supports plants such as grey saltbush, sea spurge and two-horned sea rocket. The rest of the island supports a shrubland dominated by nitre bush and saltbush. Other species observed in the shrubland included Australian hollyhock, black-anther flax lily, bower spinach, coastal lignum, karkalla, native juniper and variable groundsel. As of 1996, the fauna was reported as consisting of the following vertebrates: five species of birds including Pacific gulls, rock parrots and a breeding colony of white-faced storm petrels, and one species of reptile, the southern grass skink. Naming The island was formerly known as Rabbit Island, however it was renamed under \\"the Crown Lands Act\\" around about 1960 in order to reportedly avoid confusion with the Rabbit Island located in Louth Bay. The new name acknowledged the Owen family who was leasing Taylor Island at the time of the name change. The island is known \\"locally known as Little Taylor Island due to its close proximity to Taylor Island.\\" Protected areas status Owen Island first obtained protected area status as a fauna conservation reserve declared under the Crown Lands Act 1929-1966 on 16 March 1967.

Jules Denis, Baron du Potet or Dupotet de Sennevoy (12 April 1796 - 1 July 1881) was a French esotericist. He became a renowned practitioner of mesmerism--the theories first developed by Franz Mesmer involving animal magnetism. Life He was born at Sennevoy-le-Haut, the son of Charles Jean- Baptiste Dupotet, seigneur de La Chapelle et de Sennevoy, and Pierrette Babeau Simone. He was married twice, to Agla√© Saunier in Paris in 1833, and the second time to Marie Isaure H√©rault. He died in Paris and is buried in the Montmartre Cemetery.C.A.P. 291 (1843), All√©e Samson, Division 23, Row 3, 15th tomb from the left; gravestone broken. Career Du Potet was a highly successful mesmerist. Some attributed this to the fact he was missing the thumb on his right hand. His reputation was such, apparently, that a man was convicted of murder and executed based on evidence given by \\"one of Du Potet's clairvoyantes\\". He operated a free school of magnetism in Paris from 1826 on, and from 1837 to 1845 practised magnetic healing in London, where he successfully treated epileptic girls at the North London Hospital and according to a letter to the editor of The Lancet his experiments became the talk of the town. For du Potet, who was in correspondence with mesmerists worldwide, mesmerism was, not unlike Utopian socialism, an aid in bringing about social transformation, even a revolution. An 1890 article in the English occult magazine Lucifer praises him as an ardent supporter of mesmerism whose \\"powerful voice\\" might have stopped the \\"travesty\\" of hypnotism. Du Potet also pursued occult applications of mesmerism. Eliphas Levi praised him highly in his History of Magic, and said that magnetism had unlocked for him the secrets of magic. Unlike Levi, he believed that trance enabled contact with the dead and with never incarnated spirits, and his circle believed in remote influence by means of magnetic currents. He was a member of the Theosophical Society; his writings were quoted extensively by Helena Blavatsky, who regarded him as an adept. In The Discovery of the Unconscious, Henri Ellenberger considers him to have \\"developed ... delusions of grandeur\\". Du Potet published and edited the Journal du magnetisme from 1845 to 1861. Books he wrote include Introduction to the Study of Animal Magnetism (1838) and La magie d√©voil√©e et la science occulte (1852), a copy of which was owned by Victor Hugo.

Franco is shot in the knees by McClane, and then smashes his head through a plate glass window as he stumbles--killing him instantly. He is portrayed by Bruno Doyon. Uli is the only Asian terrorist among the team. Uli is notably seen eating a candy bar during the shootout with the SWAT team. Uli is gunned down by McClane while Uli forces the hostages onto the roof. Fritz is a terrorist. He is killed by McClane, who shoots him with a sub machine gun. Kristoff is Theo's assistant. Kristoff is pistol whipped by McClane, and it is left unclear if he survived. James is one of the terrorists who fire the missile launcher. James is killed when McClane drops C4 down an elevator shaft leading to the floor James is on. Alexander is one of the terrorists who fire the missile launcher. Alexander is killed by exploding C4. Heinrich is the terrorist in charge of the C4 and detonators. He is shot dead by McClane in the boardroom immediately before McClane's shootout with Marco. Marco is an unhinged terrorist. Marco is shot dead by McClane, who tosses Marco's body out a window and onto Powell's car. =William Stuart= Colonel William Stuart is the main antagonist of Die Hard 2. He is an ex-Special Forces commander who leads a troop of soldiers who takeover Dulles Airport and use makeshift equipment from a church to control all flights from the main command Center, and to free dictator General Ramon Esperanza from Val Verde. He first meets McClane by chance when the two accidentally bump into each other. Stuart takes total control of the airport when his men destroy the main antenna array, and he discovers John McClane is foiling his mission. In retaliation for the soldiers he lost, Stuart causes a plane to crash and he warns the control tower and McClane to stay away from his business. He later receives contact from General Esperanza that he is landing the plane and to turn on the runway lights so he can safely land. Stuart and his men arrive to see him, only to be ambushed by McClane. Luckily, a soldier traps McClane in the cabin and Stuart commands his men to throw grenades in the cockpit. It explodes but McClane was barely able to escape the plane, and Stuart was forced to flee as cop cars were approaching. Back at the church, Stuart prepared a \\"shootout\\" with Major Grant and escaped via snowmobile. Now having Esperanza and Grant at his side, they leave the United States for an island on a jet, but are pursued by McClane. He gets the chance to fist fight McClane on the plane's wing and wins by knocking him off the wing. Unfortunately for Colonel Stuart, he did not see McClane pull the latch and cause fuel to leak, and Stuart is killed as the plane explodes. He is portrayed by William Sadler. = Major Grant = Major Grant is a corrupt Army special forces commander who appears in Die Hard 2. He is portrayed by John Amos. =Simon Gruber= Simon Peter Gruber (alias Peter Krieg) is the main antagonist of Die Hard with a Vengeance. He is Hans Gruber's older brother, who at first seems to be avenging his brother's death from the first film. A puzzler, Simon makes John McClane play a twisted version of Simon Says. After a bomb destroyed a department store in Manhattan, Simon calls the NYPD Headquarters, taking responsibility for the bomb. He then orders the police to send John McClane to Harlem wearing a racist sign that reads \\"I Hate Niggers\\". Simon then orders John and his new partner shopkeeper Zeus Carver to reach a nearby telephone booth or else he will blow up another downtown building. He gives them a riddle to solve and answer in the form of a phone number. When they fail, he fools them that a trash can is now set to explode, only to reveal he did not say \\"Simon Says\\". Next, he orders both men to get to Wall Street Station within 30 minutes before a bomb is set to explode in the subway. Because both men failed to arrive at the subway station together, the bomb just about explodes near the station. It still does but nobody is killed. The second explosion was part of a scheme by Simon to create a pathway to break into the New York Federal Reserve Bank and steal gold bullion worth millions to billions of dollars. Simon then sends a threat warning to the police if they bother contacting themselves by radio, it will result in an explosion in one of many schools in downtown Manhattan. As the police are being lured to the schools, Simon on the other hand goes briefly undercover to enter his way through the main entrance of the bank. His henchmen break through the rear and steal millions in gold bullion that they load onto many dump trucks. The gold is subsequently exported to Quebec, Canada before Simon imprisons John McClane and Zeus Carver in his barge, where he reveals luring the police away was part of his plan to steal the gold and the real bomb was within the ship the whole time. When Simon flees to Quebec, his men celebrate with beer and Simon dedicates his success by having sex with his female accomplice Katya. But his plan is foiled when McClane and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police raid the warehouse and recover the stolen gold. When Simon attempts his escape in a helicopter, he is killed when McClane shoots an electric cable that catches fire on the helicopter's rotors and explodes. He is portrayed by Jeremy Irons. =Katya= Katya is Simon Gruber‚Äôs right-hand woman in Die Hard with a Vengeance. = Mathias Targo = =Thomas Gabriel= Thomas Gabriel is a crazed former DOD (Department of Defense) agent turned traitor and cyber terrorist, and the main antagonist of Live Free or Die Hard. Gabriel is a hacker who attempted to show the DOD how the United States security features could be subject to a Fire Sale. No one believed him and he was relieved of his duties, which turned him against his country. He hired several criminal hackers all over the nation to assist him in his plot to shut down all computer-run systems in the United States. While at work with his task, his henchmen planted bombs in several homes with internet connectivity and killed every single one except for one young man named Matthew Farrell. John McClane, now an older man than when he last was involved in a deadly mission, saved him at the last minute; he was close to execution by Gabriel's bomb. Now with a victim on the loose, Gabriel orders his henchmen to track him and find him so he can continue his operation with his Fire Sale, a chain of events involving total control of the nations security systems and electrical power. With the help of Farrell, McClane works to stop Gabriel's Fire Sale, leading to Gabriel kidnapping McClane's daughter Lucy. During a final confrontation, Gabriel holds McClane at gunpoint and taunts him while digging his gun into a bullet wound in McClane's shoulder. In response, McClane grabs Gabriel's gun and fires it through himself and into Gabriel who is standing behind him, killing Gabriel. He is portrayed by Timothy Olyphant. =Mai Linh= Mai Linh is a Thomas Gabriel's girlfriend and second-in-command, who assists Gabriel in his plans to shut down the US infrastructure in order to steal billions of dollars from the Woodlawn Facility. She appeared in Die Hard 4.0. She is portrayed by Maggie Q. =Yuri Komarov= Yuri Komarov is a former Russian billionaire and political prisoner, and the main antagonist of A Good Day to Die Hard, although his true nature is not revealed until late in the story. A clever strategist, he pretends to be weak and feeble in the presence of his adversaries. He is initially held without trial for refusing to hand over a secret file containing incriminating evidence against former associate and corrupt politician Viktor Chagarin. Jack McClane, under arrest for an assassination attempt, agrees to testify against Komarov in court, in exchange for a shorter sentence. On the day of the trial, the courthouse is bombed by Chagarain's henchmen, led by Alik; in the confusion, Jack escapes with Komarov. John McClane, having come to Moscow to help his son, goes after them, and they are both pursued by Alik and his men. They lose their pursuers and go to a safe house, where Jack's CIA associates demand the location of the file from Komarov in order to bring down Chagarin. Komarov agrees to help on the condition that he and his daughter are given protection and safe passage out of Russia. The safe house is raided by Chagarin's men, but Komarov escapes with the McClanes; he leads them to a hotel to collect a key to the vault containing the file. His daughter Irina is there to meet him, as arranged, but she is revealed to be working for Chagarin for money. She and Alik take her father prisoner, traveling to Chernobyl, where the file is hidden. They enter the vault supposedly containing the file, but Komarov suddenly shoots Alik, before calling Chagarin and revealing that he and Irina planned all along to betray him. Komarov then has one of his men strangle Chagarin. The McClanes enter the vault, and Komarov tells them there never was a file; the vault is instead filled with vast stocks of weapons-grade uranium, worth billions. Irina comes to her father's aid, and a gunfight ensues; John pursues Irina, who escapes in a helicopter, while Jack goes after Komarov. The two face off on the roof, and Komarov taunts Jack, saying his father will soon be dead; enraged, Jack throws Komarov from the rooftop into the path of the whirling helicopter blades. He is portrayed by Sebastian Koch. Allies =Al Powell= Al is a Los Angeles Police sergeant who shared a friendship with John McClane after helping with the takeover of Nakatomi Building in Los Angeles. During the first movie, Al is dispatched to check out McClane's emergency radio call and is nearly killed by the terrorists after McClane drops the body of Marco on his police car. Following this, Al communicates with McClane by radio, keeping his spirits up and keeping him apprised of the situation outside. At the end of the movie, McClane and Al meet face to face and Al kills the last terrorist, Karl, who had a personal grudge against McClane. In the second movie, McClane calls Al to run the fingerprints of a man he has killed. Al identifies the man as a Special Forces soldier who was supposedly killed two years prior in Honduras. Al's favorite snack is a Twinkie. He is portrayed by Reginald VelJohnson and appears in both Die Hard and Die Hard 2. =Argyle= Argyle is the limo driver assigned to pick up John McClane from LAX and transport him to the Nakatomi Plaza for the Nakatomi Corporation's 1988 Christmas party. Argyle offers to wait in the garage until John knows for certain if he was riding home with Holly or if he needed other transportation. He is unknowingly locked in the garage by the Nakatomi vault heist team. Near the end of the film, Argyle notices Theo trying to prepare an ambulance for the terrorists' escape. Argyle then rams the ambulance with his limo and knocks out Theo with a punch to the jaw. Argyle drives John and Holly home to celebrate Christmas Eve. Argyle is portrayed by De'voreaux White and appears in Die Hard. =Marvin= Marvin is an airport janitor who helps McClane in his mission to save the planes from low fuel. When he meets McClane, he first finds him suspicious and thought he was stealing his record. He is portrayed by Tom Bower and appears in Die Hard 2. =Leslie Barnes= Barnes is a chief engineer at Dulles airport and communications specialist. He is portrayed by Art Evans and appears in Die Hard 2. =Trudeau= Trudeau is the chief of operations at Dulles airport, who appeared in Die Hard 2. He is portrayed by Fred Dalton Thompson. = Corporal Telford = Corporal Telford is a new transfer to Major Grant's unit, replacing a sick soldier, who appears in Die Hard 2. After the battle with Colonel Stuart's men at the church, Telford is killed by Grant, who was working with Stuart. He is portrayed by Patrick O‚ÄôNeal. =Zeus Carver= Carver is a black supremacist Harlem shop owner who saves McClane from a mob of gang members angered by the racist sign the latter was forced to wear by Simon. As punishment for interfering, Carver is forced by Simon to aid McClane through various dangerous tasks across New York City. Although he is prejudiced against white people, Carver eventually grows to respect McClane as the two effectively work together to complete each task. In the end after McClane kills Simon, Carver encourages McClane to patch things with his estranged wife, Holly. He is portrayed by Samuel L. Jackson and appears in Die Hard with a Vengeance. =Matt Farrell= Farrell is a computer hacker portrayed by Justin Long who inadvertently aids Thomas Gabriel in his Fire Sale. After being sent to bring Farrell in for questioning by the FBI, John McClane saves his life and teams up with Farrell to stop Gabriel. During the final confrontation, Farrell is forced to decode Gabriel's stolen data he'd previously encrypted to hinder him with the lives of McClane and his daughter Lucy on the line. After McClane kills Gabriel, Farrell is able to reach McClane's gun in time to shoot Gabriel's last henchman dead, saving McClane's life. He later expresses an interest in Lucy, something she returns to McClane's annoyance. He appears in Live Free or Die Hard. =Warlock= Warlock, real name Freddy Kaludis, is a hacker and an old friend of Matt Farrell's from space camp. When Thomas Gabriel shuts down the nation, Warlock is still online due to his generators and Farrell and John McClane enlist his help in finding Gabriel. Though reluctant, Warlock aids the two in tracking Gabriel who contacts them through Warlock's equipment and threatens the life of Lucy McClane. McClane later uses the CB radio in the terrorists hijacked truck to contact Warlock and ask him to connect McClane to Deputy Director Bowman of the FBI. While Warlock initially refuses to contact the head of the FBI's Cyber Division, he agrees after being informed that Lucy has been kidnapped by Gabriel and connects McClane and Bowman. He is portrayed by actor/comedian Kevin Smith and appears in Live Free or Die Hard. =Miguel Bowman= Bowman is a Deputy Director in the FBI and is in charge of the Cyber Division and thus the country's infrastructure. When Thomas Gabriel begins his Fire Sale, Bowman orders all known hackers brought in for questioning before a fake anthrax alarm forces Bowman and his men to evacuate. While dealing with the situation, Bowman is approached by John McClane and Matt Farrell, one of the hackers Bowman had ordered brought to him and who had been the target of an assassination attempt by Gabriel's men. While dismissing Farrell's theory of a Fire Sale, Bowman sends him to the Department of Homeland Security to tell them what he knows. McClane later notifies Bowman of the failure of their attempt to reach Homeland Security and the two men watch Gabriel start to terrorize the country before being cut-off. Bowman later identifies Gabriel for McClane after being sent a picture of him and explains Gabriel's history before losing contact. When Farrell sets off an alarm at the Woodlawn Building, Bowman personally leads an assault team to stop the terrorists before McClane contacts him once again with the help of the hacker Warlock. McClane warns Bowman that Gabriel has captured his daughter and Farrell and gives Bowman the license plate number of Gabriel's Hazmat van so Bowman can use its lo jack system to track the terrorists. At McClane's insistence, Bowman promises to take care of Lucy if anything happens to McClane. After the terrorists are dead, Bowman and his team finally arrive at their hideout. As his men threaten Matt Farrell, Bowman calls them off and later thanks McClane for his help. He is portrayed by actor Cliff Curtis and appears in Live Free or Die Hard. =Mike Collins= Mike Collins is a CIA Agent and Jack McClane's partner during the operation in arresting Victor Chagarin. Collins meets John, Komarov, and Jack. They are suddenly attacked by a sniper, who shoots Collins in the head. He is portrayed by Cole Hauser and appears in A Good Day to Die Hard.

Life He was the son of Thomas West of Beeston in Nottinghamshire, by his wife Anne, daughter of William Bradbury of the Peak. He was admitted a student of the Inner Temple in November 1568, being then described as of Darley, Derbyshire. He made a fortune by practice in law, and settled at Rotherham in Yorkshire. Works In 1590 West published Symbol√¶ographia, which may be termed the Art, Description, or Image of Instruments, Covenants, Contracts, &c.;, or the Notarie or Scriuener (London). This work, which was dedicated to Sir Edmund Anderson, was a general practical treatise on English law under its several divisions, and was held in great esteem at the time. The demand for it was so great that West immediately began to prepare a second edition, practically rewriting the whole book. He divided his treatise into two parts, and divested it of many superfluous classical quotations with which he had encumbered the first edition, thus rendering it more suitable for practical lawyers. The first part of the new edition (which dealt chiefly with covenants, contracts, and wills) appeared in 1592 (London). It was reissued in 1610, 1618, 1622, and 1632. The second part, with a new treatise on equity appended, appeared in 1594. It was dedicated to Edward Coke. New editions were issued in 1611, 1618, and 1627. Some of the later editions may have been edited by West's sons. West also edited Les tenures du monsieur Littleton (London, 1581) in Norman French; and contributed to Richard Crompton's edition of L'Office et Auctoryt√© des justices de peas by Anthony Fitzherbert. Family West was twice married: first, to Winifred, daughter of Adam Eyre of Offerton;There are three places in England called Offerton. Geography suggests Offerton, Derbyshire as the most likely; it is about 15 miles from Darley. whereas the other two are much further away. and, secondly, to Audrey Mann.

Located in Upper Enchanted Township, near Jackman, Maine, United States, the camps were established by Henry Patrick McKenney in the 1880s as a set of logging camps, were converted into an active sporting camp in the early 1900s, and remain a current member of the Maine Sporting Camp Association. Namesake The 800 ft. cliffs of Shutdown and Coburn Mountains that rise up abruptly from either side of Enchanted Pond used to significantly resemble the profile of two bulldogs looking across the pond at one another. The pond was nicknamed \\"Bulldog Pond\\" and since the camps on its north shore were the only ones on the lake (as they remain today), they were donned with the seemingly unusual name. History The camps were originally established in the 1880s by H.P. McKenney who ran the place as a logging camp for many years and it is the historic site of McKenney‚Äôs famous log sluice built to run his logs from Bulldog to the Dead River, saving him a significant amount of mileage to the mill compared to his old route. A wooden dam was constructed at the outlet of Enchanted Pond in order to hold the water back until it was needed for the drive in the spring, although there was much speculation as to whether or not his sluice would actually work. In the spring of 1900, the first load of logs were guided into the sluice with success and the remnants of the old dam and sluice can still be found at the outlet of the pond. Logging operations came to an end at Bulldog around 1908 and the place was immediately transformed into an active sporting camp. The camps were popular with anglers and sportsmen as the popularity of the region grew with visits from such notable figures as Henry David Thoreau and President Theodore Roosevelt. The Great Depression hit hard and business dropped in the 1930s and 1940s. The camps changed owners several times and in 1957, a couple by the name of Ruel & Hazel Orff bought the place and breathed new life into it, offering the traditional American Plan along with boat rentals, guide service, and float plane fly-in service. Unfortunately the main lodge burned down in the autumn of 1973, shortly after a change in ownership, and for the next few decades the cabins were available to rent on the housekeeping plan only. Bulldog Camps transforms into a winter wonderland December‚ÄìMarch. In 2005, current owner Darren Savage bought Bulldog and spent the next several years restoring it to its current state. One of the original 19th century cabins was converted into a new lodge and once again people can enjoy three home cooked meals a day on the traditional American Plan. As the camps had never been open during the winter before, all of the cabins were renovated with new roofs, porches, wood stoves, propane heaters, and full bathrooms with hot running water. A road was built down into the camps that were previously only accessible via 4x4 trail, hiking trail, or float plane. In 2009, the camps gained ownership of a remote camp on the southwest end of Enchanted, the only other building on the pond. This cabin, known as the ‚ÄúWarden‚Äôs Camp‚Äù was built in 1960 by the chief pilot for the Maine Warden Service and is rented out along with the six cabins at the main camp on the north shore. The camps bring in the fisherman and ATVers in the spring, annual family vacationers in the summer, and hunters and leaf peepers in the fall. Fishing & Hunting Brook trout caught out of Enchanted Pond, June 2007 Once believed to be bottomless, Enchanted Pond was eventually found to be little over 200 ft. deep, making it easily the deepest lake in the region and a great place to catch bright native brook trout in crystal clear oligotrophic waters. Hunts are run in the fall from the last week of August through the first week of December and include hunts for bear, whitetail deer, moose, coyote, grouse, woodcock, and rabbit.

It began in the later 1730s as congregations experienced intense \\"awakenings\\" of enthusiasm, renewed commitment and rapid expansion. This was first seen at Easter Ross in the Highlands in 1739 and most famously in the Cambuslang Wark near Glasgow in 1742. Most of the new converts were relatively young and from the lower groups in society. Unlike awakenings elsewhere, the early revival in Scotland did not give rise to a major religious movement, but mainly benefited the secession churches, who had broken away from the Church of Scotland. In the late eighteenth century and early nineteenth century the revival entered a second wave, known in the US as the Second Great Awakening. In Scotland this was reflected in events like the Kilsyth Revival in 1839. The early revival mainly spread in the Central Belt, but it became active in the Highlands and Islands, peaking towards the middle of the nineteenth century. Scotland gained many of the organisations associated with the revival in England, including Sunday Schools, mission schools, ragged schools, Bible societies and improvement classes. In the nineteenth century the Church of Scotland was divided between the evangelicals and the Moderate Party. Events came to a head in the Great Disruption in which many of the evangelicals, particularly in the North and Highlands left to form the Free Church of Scotland. The country began to gain relatively large numbers of non-conformist churches and congregations, which were evangelical in outlook, including the Quakers, Baptist, Congregationalist and Methodist churches. They were joined by the Salvation Army, the Open and the Exclusive Brethren. A strand of evangelicalism developed in the Scottish Episcopal Church in the early nineteenth century, leading a group in Edinburgh to form a separate English Episcopal congregation. A major emphasis of evangelical Protestantism were organised missions. In the eighteenth century the focus had been the Highlands and Islands. Missions also developed to fishermen and to the growing communities of the urban poor. The visit of American evangelists Moody and Sankey in 1874‚Äì75 revitalised the evangelical mission. David Livingstone became the most foreign missionary and after this death, Scottish missionary efforts were also fuelled by the rivalry between different denominations in Scotland. There continued to be spontaneous outbreaks of revival in the twentieth century. The most successful was the 1955 tour of Scotland by Billy Graham, which reversed the decline in church attendance in Scotland. In the late twentieth century the movement became divided. Evangelicalism had permeated Scottish leaving a legacy of strict Sabbatarianism and had helped foster local identities in the Highlands. Nature The revival was spread by regular preaching and intense local revivals, where whole communities became highly concerned for their souls. This often occurred at communion, which was the central occasion of the church, conducted infrequently, at most once a year. Where ministers refused or neglected parish communion, largely assemblies were carried out in the open air, often combining several parishes. These large gatherings were discouraged by the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, but continued. They could become mixed with secular activities and were commemorated as such by Robert Burns in the poem Holy Fair.D. Murray, \\"Religious life: 1650-1750\\" in M. Lynch, ed., The Oxford Companion to Scottish History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001), , pp. 513-4. These were transformed by evangelicals into sacred occasions, with sermons by popular preachers and the sharing of spiritual experience. The communion season lasted from Thursday to Monday. In the Highlands communicants travelled great distances and lodged with friends and family. On Friday, known as the question day, lay catechists, called \\"the men\\", would give their interpretations of Bible verses chosen by the minister. They would occasionally emerge as charismatic leaders of local revivals. The climax was the Sabbath day celebration of communion, often outdoors in a natural amphitheatre.D. Meek, \\"Religious life: 8 Highlands since the Reformation\\" in M. Lynch, ed., The Oxford Companion to Scottish History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001), , pp. 517-22. John Erskine, leading figure in the movement in the late eighteenth century Most of the new converts were relatively young and from the lower groups in society, such as small tenants, craftsmen, servants and the unskilled, with a relatively high proportion of unmarried women. This has been seen as a reaction against the oligarchical nature of the established kirk, which was dominated by local lairds and heritors. Unlike awakenings elsewhere, in the eighteenth century the revival in Scotland did not give rise to a major religious movement, but mainly benefited the secession churches, who had broken away from the Church of Scotland in the eighteenth century.G. M. Ditchfield, The Evangelical Revival (London: Routledge, 1998), , pp. 53 and 91. The Associate Presbytery and Presbytery of Relief had broken from the Church of Scotland over issues of patronage in the mid-eighteenth century. The Associate Presbytery then split over the Burgess oath imposed after the Jacobite rebellion of 1745, with one faction forming the separate General Associate Synod.M. Lynch, Scotland: a New History (London: Random House, 1991), , p. 293. Between 1799 and 1806 the Old and New Light controversy, with the \\"Old Lichts\\" following closely the principles of the Covenanters, while the \\"New Lichts\\" were more evangelical and focused on personal salvation,M. Lynch, Scotland: a New History (London: Random House, 1991), , p. 400. split both the Associate and General Associate Presbyteries. This paved the way for a form of reunification, as both the New Licht factions joined together in 1820 to form the United Secession Church, which claimed to have 361 congregations and 261,000 followers at its inception. Thanks to the revival, the secession churches had made headway in recruitment, and by 1830 30 per cent of the Scottish population were members. They made particular advances in the major urban centres. In Glasgow in 1835-36 40 per cent of the population were members and in Edinburgh and it was 42 per cent.M. Lynch, Scotland: a New History (London: Random House, 1991), , pp. 279-81. The leading figure in the evangelical movement within the Church of Scotland in the eighteenth century was John Erskine (1721‚Äì1803), who was minister of Old Greyfriars Church in Edinburgh from 1768. He was orthodox in doctrine, but sympathised with the Enlightenment and supported reforms in religious practice. A popular preacher, he corresponded with religious leaders in other countries, including New England theologian Johnathan Edwards (1703‚Äì58), whose ideas were a major influence on the movement in Scotland. The movement was supported by the publication of Bibles and tracts, such as those printed by Peter Drummond at Stirling from 1848. In the late eighteenth century and early nineteenth century, Scotland gained many of the organisations associated with the revival in England, including Sunday Schools, mission schools, ragged schools, Bible societies and improvement classes.M. Lynch, Scotland: a New History (London: Pimlico, 1992), , p. 403. First wave John Wesley, who visited Scotland over 20 times The evangelical revival was a movement that arose within Protestantism at roughly the same time in North America (where it is known as the First Great Awakening), England, Wales and Scotland. It put an emphasis on the Bible, the doctrine of atonement, conversion and the need to practice and spread the gospel.D. W. Bebbington, \\"Religious life: 6 Evangelism\\" in M. Lynch, ed., The Oxford Companion to Scottish History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001), , pp. 515-16. It began to manifest itself in Scotland in the later 1730s as Protestant congregations, usually in a specific locations, experienced intense \\"awakenings\\" of enthusiasm, renewed commitment and, sometimes, rapid expansion. This was first seen at Easter Ross in the Highlands in 1739 and most famously in the Cambuslang Wark (work) near Glasgow in 1742, where intense religious activity culminated in a crowd of perhaps 30,000 gathering there to hear the English preacher George Whitefield.D. Bebbington, Victorian Religious Revivals: Culture and Piety in Local and Global Contexts (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2012), , p. 5. Scotland was also visited 22 times by John Wesley, the English evangelist and founder of Methodism, between 1751 and 1790.J. D. Mackie, B. Lenman and G. Parker, A History of Scotland (London: Penguin, 1991), , p. 304. Second wave In the late eighteenth century and early nineteenth century the revival entered a second wave, known in the US as the Second Great Awakening. The early revival had mainly spread in the Central Belt, but the second revival became increasingly important in the Highlands and Islands. It was reflected in events like the Kilsyth Revival in 1839,M. Lynch, Scotland: a New History (London: Pimlico, 1992), , p. 401. the 1849-50 series of revivals that were particularly common among fishing communities and, in the following decade, the movement extended among Lanarkshire miners. Here the lack of a clear parochial structure led to a repeated pattern of spiritual enthusiasm, recession and renewal.M. Lynch, Scotland: a New History (London: Pimlico, 1992), , p. 364. Because the revival occurred at the same time as the transformation of the Highlands into a crofting society, evangelicalism was often linked to popular protest against patronage and the Highland clearances.M. Lynch, Scotland: a New History (London: Pimlico, 1992), , p. 365. Revivals in the Highlands probably peaked towards the middle of the nineteenth century, fed by the Ten Years Conflict and the Great Disruption. Third wave A wave of urban revivalism began in New York in 1858, sometimes called the \\"Layman's Revival\\" because of the prominence of lay preachers.M. E. Dieter, The Holiness Revival of the Nineteenth Century (Scarecrow Press, 2nd edn., 1996), , p. 75. It reached Scotland the next year following a trade depression and enthusiasm would continue in a heightened form until 1862. In the major manufacturing districts of the country, prayer meetings were held in offices and factories and in the streets of Edinburgh and Glasgow. Some viewed the revival with alarm, as it caused absenteeism from work and long prayer meetings disrupted the working day.C. G. Brown, Religion and Society in Scotland Since 1707 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1997), , p. 105. The revival saw an innovation in the introduction of the professional revivalist preacher, including Charles Grandison Finney (1792‚Äì1875), who visited Edinburgh in 1859.S. J. Brown, \\"Beliefs and religions\\", in T. Griffiths, G. Morton, eds, History of Everyday Life in Scotland, 1800 to 1900 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2010), , p. 135. Together with Edward Payson Hammond, he introduced the distinctive revivalist service of a short sermon, joyous hymns and calls for members of the congregation to come forward.Brown, Religion and Society in Scotland Since 1707, p. 117. Impact on the Church of Scotland The Disruption Assembly, painted by David Octavius Hill In the nineteenth century the Church of Scotland was increasingly divided between the evangelicals and the Moderate Party.J. T. Koch, Celtic Culture: a Historical Encyclopedia, Volumes 1-5 (London: ABC-CLIO, 2006), , pp. 416-7. While evangelicals emphasised the authority of the Bible and the traditions and historical documents of the kirk, the Moderates, who had dominated the General Assembly of the Church since the mid-eighteenth century, tended to stress intellectualism in theology, the established hierarchy of the kirk and attempted to raise the social status of the clergy. The major issue was the patronage of landholders and heritors over appoints to the ministry. Thomas Chalmers began as a Moderate, but increasingly became an evangelical, emerging as the leading figure in the movement.J. D. Mackie, B. Lenman and G. Parker, A History of Scotland (London: Penguin, 1991), , pp. 303-4. After prolonged years of struggle, in 1834 the evangelicals gained control of the General Assembly and passed the Veto Act, which allowed congregations to reject unwanted \\"intrusive\\" presentations to livings by patrons and the Chapels Act, which put the ministers of Chapels of Ease on an equal footing with ordinary parish ministers. The following \\"Ten Years' Conflict\\" of legal and political wrangling ended in defeat for the non-intrusionists in the civil courts, reaching the Court of Session and then finally the House of Lords in 1839, which declared the acts unconstitutional. In 1842 evangelicals presented to the General Assembly a Claim, Declaration and Protest anent the Encroachments of the Court of Session, known as the Claim of Right, that questioned the validity of civil jurisdiction over the church. When the Claim of Right was rejected by the General Assembly the result was a schism from the church by some of the non-intrusionists led by Thomas Chalmers, known as the Great Disruption of 1843.A. Roger, The Courts, The Church, and The Constitution: Aspects of the Disruption of 1843 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2008), , pp. 27-8. Some 454, roughly a third, of the 1,195 clergy of the established church, mainly from the North and Highlands, formed the separate Free Church of Scotland. The Free Church was more accepting of Gaelic language and culture, grew rapidly in the Highlands and Islands, appealing much more strongly than did the established church.G. Robb, \\"Popular Religion and the Christianisation of the Scottish Highlands in the Eighteenth and Nineteenth Centuries\\", Journal of Religious History, 1990, 16(1), pp. 18-34. Voluntary churches Scalloway Methodist Church, Shetland, one of the areas where Methodism put down extensive roots In the nineteenth century the country began to gain relatively large numbers of non-conformist churches and congregations, which were evangelical in outlook. Many of these were part of organisations that originated in England and Wales. They were known in Scotland as voluntary churches, since they stood outside the established system and participation and any payments were voluntary. The Quakers had established themselves in Scotland in the seventeenth centuryR. Mitchison, Lordship to Patronage, Scotland 1603‚Äì1745 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1983), , p. 66. and Baptist, Congregationalist and Methodist churches had appeared in the eighteenth century, but did not begin significant growth until the nineteenth century, partly because more radical and evangelical traditions already existed within the Church of Scotland and the free churches.G. M. Ditchfield, The Evangelical Revival (London: Routledge, 1998), , p. 91. The Congregationalists organised themselves into a union in 1812, the Baptists, who were divided into Calvinists and non-Calvinist tendencies, did the same in 1869. The Methodist Church had probably been limited by its anti-Calvinist theology, but made advances in the century, particularly in Shetland.D. W. Bebbington, \\"Protestant sects and disestablishment\\" in M. Lynch, ed., The Oxford Companion to Scottish History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001), , pp. 494-5. From 1879, they were joined by the evangelical revivalism of the Salvation Army, which attempted to make major inroads in the growing urban centres. The Open and Exclusive Brethren entered Scotland in the late nineteenth century and the Open Brethren had 116 meetings in Scotland by 1884.C. G. Brown, Religion and Society in Scotland Since 1707 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1997) , p. 38. Episcopalian Church The Scottish Episcopalian Church was a combination of non-juror churches who did not accept the House of Hanover until the death of the last member of the House of Stuart in 1788, and Qualified Chapels of those that accepted the Hanoverians or were members of the Church of England resident in Scotland.D. W. Bebbington, \\"Episcopalian community\\" in M. Lynch, ed., The Oxford Companion to Scottish History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001), , pp. 234-5. A strand of evangelicalism developed in the Church in the early nineteenth century, mainly among English and Irish immigrants to Lowland towns. It was less interested in the sacramental traditions of the church and put an emphasis on communicating a simple gospel message, leading to clashes with the high church tendency within the Church.S. J. Brown \\"Scotland and the Oxford Movement\\", in S. J. Brown and P. B. Nockles, eds, The Oxford Movement: Europe and the Wider World 1830‚Äì1930 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2012), , p. 60. In 1843, the same year as the Great Disruption, a group in Edinburgh, under its leading figure David Drummond, broke away to form a separate English Episcopal congregation. There were fears that the schism would spread, but the departures weakened the evangelical party within the church and it never recovered its position.D. M. Murray, \\"Presbyterian Churches and denominations post-1690\\" in M. Lynch, ed., The Oxford Companion to Scottish History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001), , pp. 83-5. Home missions Ira D. Sankey, whose with Dwight Lyman Moody helped to revitalise the movement in Scotland in the late nineteenth century Organised missions were a major emphasis of Scottish evangelical Protestantism.Frank Bardgett, 'Missions and Missionaries - Home' in In the eighteenth century the focus had been the Highlands and Islands through the Royal Bounty provided by the government and the Scottish Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge (SSPCK), who had 229 schools in the Highlands by 1795. Gaelic school societies were founded, beginning in Edinburgh in 1811, supporting travelling schools to the northern Highlands and western Isles. In 1797 James Haldane founded the non-denominational Society for the Propagation of the Gospel at Home, whose lay-preachers established independent churches across the Highlands. When Haldane and his brother Robert accepted the principle of adult baptism in 1808 most of them became Baptist chapels. The Congregational Union of Scotland was formed in 1812 to promote home missions. In 1827 the Baptists consolidated their efforts in the Baptist Home Missionary Society. In 1824 the government provided funds to build 32 churches and 41 manses in the Highlands. After the Disruption in 1843 most of the expansion was in new churches established by the Free Church.D. W. Bebbington, \\"Missions at home\\" in M. Lynch, ed., The Oxford Companion to Scottish History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001), , pp. 422-3. Missions to fishermen and seamen began with the Seamen's Friend Societies. In the cities much of the work was interdenominational. The first urban mission was founded by David Nasmith in Glasgow in 1826 and drew on all the Protestant churches. Chalmers' experiment in St. John's, Glasgow, published in The Christian and Civic Economy of Large Towns (1821‚Äì26), provided a model of urban mission based on lay visitation. It was widely adopted by the Free Church after the Disruption and would be taken up by the Church of Scotland under the leadership of A. H. Charteris in the 1870s. The visit of American evangelists Ira D. Sankey and Dwight Lyman Moody in 1874‚Äì75 revitalised the evangelical mission, leading to the founding of the Glasgow United Evangelistic Association. The Tent Hall was opened on Glasgow Green in the city in 1876, which hosted poor relief, serving 1,000 breakfasts a day, and evangelical meetings. The Faith Mission was founded in 1886 by John George Govan as a non-denominational mission focusing on rural society.K. Fiedler, The Story of Faith Missions (OCMS, 1994), , p. 219. Charteris was instrumental in the foundation of the Women's Guild in 1887, which underlined the role of women in the missions. They also acted as Biblewomen, reading scriptures, and in teaching Sunday schools. The Bible Training Institute for training lay evangelists was founded in 1892. Overseas missions David Livingstone preaching from a wagon in one of the illustrations that were used at home to relate missionary work to audiences in Britain The Scottish churches were relatively late to take up the challenge of foreign missions. The most famous Scottish missionary, David Livingstone, was not funded from his home country, but by the London Missionary Society. After his \\"disappearance\\" and death in the 1870s he became an icon of evangelic outreach, self-improvement, exploration and a form of colonialism.A. C. Ross, David Livingstone: Mission and Empire (London: Continuum, 2006), , pp. 242-5. The legacy of Livingstone can be seen in the names of many mission stations founded following his example, such as Blantyre (the place of Livingstone's birth) for the Church of Scotland and Livingstonia for the Free Church, both now in Malawi. As well as the cult of Livingstone, Scottish missionary efforts were also fuelled by the rivalry between different denominations in Scotland, and may have helped distract from problems at home. The missions were popularised at home by publications and illustrations, often particularly designed to appeal to children, and through the new medium of the magic lantern show, shown to audiences in church halls throughout the country.R. J. Finley, \\"Missions overseas\\" in M. Lynch, ed., The Oxford Companion to Scottish History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001), , pp. 245-6. Decline The evangelical effort began to decline in intensity in the final decades of the nineteenth century, both in Scotland and in major cities throughout the UK. There began to be shortages of volunteers and funds for a large number of organisations. Reasons for this transformation that have been advanced include changes in leisure habits, the rise of socialism and the Labour movement, loss of middle class certainty about the validity of the gospel and its imposition on the working class as a solution to social ills.Brown, Religion and Society in Scotland Since 1707, pp. 124-5. The migration of the middle classes away from inner city areas to newly built suburbs also removed them from contact with the working classes and a loss of willingness to engage in the evangelical project, particularly the new petite bourgeoisie of white collar workers and tradesmen.Brown, Religion and Society in Scotland Since 1707, pp. 127-9. As a result, urban religion became dominated by the working classes themselves, with new proletarian organisations such as the United Evangelistic Associations of Glasgow and Dundee, the United Working Men's Christian Mission, the Protestant Missionary Society of Glasgow, the Salvation Army and the various temperance societies. The imposition of evangelical religion above also began to be rejected by the working classes themselves, who began to abandon attendance at organised events and visitations.Brown, Religion and Society in Scotland Since 1707, pp. 130-1. Twentieth century Kelvin Hall in Glasgow, which saw the climax of the Tell Scotland Movement with the Billy Graham rallies in 1955 Despite declining church attendance, evangelicalism continued into the twentieth century. There were spontaneous outbreaks of revival, such as that led by Jack Troup among fishermen of the north-east in 1921. The Herbridean revival of 1949-53 was initiated by the preaching of Faith Mission evangelist Duncan Campbell (1898-1972). There were small revivals in Tiree in 1955 and North Uist in 1958. The Tell Scotland Movement (1953‚Äì66) associated with Tom Allan and D.P. Thomson, resulted in the 1955 Billy Graham All-Scotland Crusade, climaxing at the meeting in Glasgow's Kelvin Hall. The success was great enough to temporarily arrest the decline in church attendance, which returned to almost pre-war levels.R. J. Finley, \\"Secularization\\" in M. Lynch, ed., The Oxford Companion to Scottish History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001), , pp. 516-17. As a movement Scottish evangelicalism began to divide into those who welcomed modern knowledge and science and those that pursued a more rigidly literal view of the Bible. The divide was exemplified by the divisions among students between the more liberal Student Christian Movement and the more theologically conservative Inter-Varsity Fellowship. Gradually the more liberal followers dropped the label evangelical. However, in 1994 23 per cent of adult church goers were associated with a church that claimed to be evangelical. Legacy Evangelicalism came to permeate Scottish society by the late nineteenth century and can be seen in areas such as the Kailyard school of literature, which moved its focus beyond the middle class to encompass the religious life of working people. The revival left a legacy of strict Sabbatarianism and helped foster local identities in the Highlands.

With an average yearly rainfall of about 100 mm, the climate is extremely arid.  Fauna  The reserve is an important refuge for some endangered large mammal species, such as the wild Bactrian camel (Camelus ferus), which was identified as a separate species in 2008 by the Veterinary University of Vienna, the Gobi bear (Ursus arctos gobiensis), the snow leopard (Uncia uncia), the argali wild sheep (Ovis ammon) and the Mongolian wild ass (Equus hemionus hemionus). Especially for the wild camel the reserve is important, since it is one of three last locations, where the rare animal can be found. Due to the remoteness and large size of the reserve, it is hard to estimate population numbers or population trends. Estimates for the population of wild camels in the reserve range from about 350 to 1950 individuals. Wolves (Canis lupus), which are also found in the reserve, might be a threat for the calves of wild camels. However, the effects of these predators on the camel population are unclear.Chris Walzer & Petra Kaczensky: Wild camel training and collaring Twenty km from the reserve is the wild camel breeding centre at Zakhyn Us, which was established in 2004 with 12 wild camels which had been caught by Mongolian herdsmen. There were 22 wild camels at the breeding centre in 2014 and in 2013 two bull wild camels were released into the reserve with satellite collars. One of them has formed his own herd with five female wild camels. The breeding centre which is financed by the Wild Camel Protection Foundationhttp://www.wildcamels.com and administered by the Director of Gobi \\"A\\" covers 40 hectares.WCPF Newsletter 33 In 2008 the Veterinary University of Vienna confirmed after extensive DNA testing that the wild camel is a new and separate species which separated from any other known camel species over 750,000 years ago.\\"Hare\\":'WCPF Newsletter 28 Final report for UNDP for the short-term international expert contracts, 2005 PDF  References  Category:Protected areas of Mongolia Category:Gobi Desert Category:Nature reserves ","title":"Great Gobi A Strictly Protected Area"},{"id":"43120168","text":"Beatriz Camu√±as (born 26 or 27 March 1959) is a retired Mexican swimmer who competed in the 1976 Summer OlympicsBeatriz Camunas Sports Reference.

After the Royal Navy took her into service in her decade-long career she took part in one notable single-ship action and captured several privateers and other vessels, all off the coast of Spain and Portugal. She was wrecked off the coast of Portugal in 1808. Design Hobbs & Hellyer built six vessels to Bentham's design. Milbrook was a somewhat smaller version of his Dart-class vessels ( and ), and of another schooner, . Bentham's designs featured little sheer, negative tumblehome, a large-breadth to length ratio with structural bulkheads, and sliding keels. They were also virtually double-ended. Career =French Revolutionary Wars= Lieutenant Matthew Smith commissioned Milbrook in December 1798. She was re-rated as a gunvessel in 1799. In February 1800 Smith wrote that the Barrack-master-general (General Oliver de Lancey) had ordered that she continue to serve the board he headed because she was \\"extremely fast, in all weathers a good sea-boat, tight as a bottle.\\"United Service Magazine (1830), Part I, p.340. Still, she received coppering at Portsmouth in April 1800. Milbrook was part of Admiral Sir John Borlase Warren's squadron and so entitled to share in the proceeds from the squadron's cutting out of the French privateer Gu√™ppe on 30 August from Vigo Bay. A violent gust of wind drove the frigate on shore on 6 September in Vigo Bay. There was no loss of life, due in large part to Milbrook, which rescued many survivors. Stags officers blew Stag up to prevent the French salvaging anything useful, and her crew were distributed amongst the fleet.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 4, p. 254. On 26 September Milbrook captured the American brig Atlas, while Atlas was sailing between Vigo and Seville. ;Milbrook and Bellone Some two weeks later, on 13 October, Milbrook engaged a French privateer in a notable but ultimately indecisive action. Milbrook was lying becalmed off Oporto when she sighted a strange sail, apparently a French 36-gun frigate. Smith was escorting two brigs of the Newfoundland fleet and there were other vessels, possibly of that fleet, in the offing. To protect the merchantmen Milbrook sailed to intercept the enemy vessel. The action began at 8 a.m. and lasted until nearly 10 a.m., in almost complete calm, until the French vessel struck. However, Milbrooks rigging was so badly cut and her boats holed, that she was unable to take possession of her prize; seeing this, when a light breeze came up the French vessel used her sails and sweeps to escape. In the action Milbrook had ten of her carronades dismounted, and had 12 men (out of a crew of 47) wounded. At one point Milbrook had only three carronades firing as she used her sweeps to change her position and had to endure the raking fire from her opponent for 15 minutes. Milbrook was so damaged that she had to be towed into the Tagus.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 4, pp. 523‚Äì4. Later accounts reveal that the French vessel was the privateer Bellone, of Bordeaux. The reports credit Milbrook with having her carronades fixed on the non-recoil principle (i.e., fixed to the vessel so that the vessel absorbs the recoil and the cannons did not have to be run out before firing again), enabling Milbrook to fire 11 broadsides before the French vessel could fire three. Bellone had to put into Vigo and reports from there suggested that she had suffered 20 men killed, and her first and second captains and 45 men wounded, out of a crew of 220-260 men. Bellone had been armed with twenty-four 8-pounder guns and six or eight 36-pounder carronades.James (1837), Vol. 3, pp. 56‚Äì7.This would have given Bellone a broadside of 194 (French) pounds, to Milbrooks broadside of 128 (English) pounds. Thus the disparity in the weight of a broadside was less than that in the number of cannons, though the disparity in number of men much favored the French. Milbrook getting close to Bellone made moot the issue of the greater range of the French 8-pounder guns; at close range the ability to fire the short-barreled and fixed carronades more rapidly than the French guns gave Milbrook an advantage in terms of the weight of shot she was able to discharge during the initial course of the engagement. As a reward for his gallantry Smith received promotion to Commander.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 5, p.186. Also, the British factory of Oporto voted him their thanks, and presented him with a piece of silver plate worth ¬£50. Smith was still in command, and off Spain, on 19 December when Milbrook captured the Spanish privateer lugger Barcelo. At some point in 1800, Milbrook shared with and Loire in the capture of Francoise, and recapture of Princess Charlotte. In February 1801 Lieutenant Mauritius Adolphus Newton de Starck, who signed his name as Newton Starck, replaced Smith in command of Milbrook. On 15 September Milbrook was off Cape Montego when she sighted a Spanish privateer. After a long chase, Milbrook captured Baptista, of eight guns, which was carrying a valuable cargo of English prize butter from Vigo to Seville. On 6 September Milbrook was at Plymouth awaiting carry dispatches to Rear-Admiral Sir James Saumarez, and the garrison at Gibraltar. Two days later Milbrook left for Portsmouth, on her way to the fleet off Cadiz.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 6, p.454. Milbrook returned to Portsmouth from Lisbon on 22 August 1802.Naval Chronicle, vol.8, p. 175. She was paid off and Starck recommissioned her on 31 October in Portsmouth.Naval Chronicle, vol.8, p. 437. =Napoleonic wars= By July 1803 Milbrook had assumed her station off Dunkirk in company with and . On 11 August Milbrook convoyed 50 vessels from Portsmouth to the Downs.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 10, p.261. August‚ÄìSeptember she was in pursuit of a strange vessel when she grounded on Kentish Knocke. She lay there for some seven hours with the sea breaking over her before she was able to free herself. Subsequently, J. Helby, foreman of shipwrights, wrote that she had survived without any damage shocks that would bilge most other vessels.United Service Magazine (1830), Part I, pp.336 & 340. On 28 October 1803, Milbrook and were off Dunkirk when they pursued and drove on shore the French privateer lugger Sept Freres. Sept Freres was armed with two guns and had a crew of 30 men under the command of Citizen Pollet. Milbrook anchored close to the lugger and came under fire from some field guns on shore. Though she took some hits, the British suffered no casualties. Head money was finally paid in May 1827. On 28 March 1804 Milbrook and Starck sailed with a number of other vessels for the Boulogne station.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 11, p.341. Lieutenant John C. Carpenter was appointed to Milbrook on 30 April, and in May replaced Starck. On 3 June Milbrook and an armed ship sailed from Portsmouth to cruise off Calais.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 12, p.153. She returned to Deal on 22 July, having lost cables and anchors.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 12, p.248. Milbrook arrived at Portsmouth from the Downs on 24 August. she sailed on 17 September with the gun-brigs and to escort the Newfoundland fleet to Poole, where would relieve them.Naval Chronicle. Vol. 12, pp. 339‚Äì40. On 6 May 1805 Milbrook captured the Spanish privateer lugger Travela, of three guns and 40 men, off Oporto. Travela had the day before captured a brig carrying wine from Oporto. Carpenter suspected that Travela had sent the brig to Vigo, so he sailed there. On the morning of 9 May he intercepted the British brig Stork in the Bayona Islands (Baiona) outside Vigo. Stork, which was carrying salt, had been part of the Newfoundland convoy when the 12-gun Spanish privateer brig Fenix had captured her a month earlier. The vessel Travela had captured may have been Constantia, Luftman, master, which had just left Oporto for Belfast.Lloyd's List (LL) (4 June 1805, ‚Ññ4222. In early June the Portuguese vessel Rosalie, which Milbrook had detained as Rosalie was sailing from Lisbon to Nantes, arrived in Plymouth.LL 3 June 1806, ‚Ññ4058. On 18 May 1806, Milbrook was escorting John, Lothringen, master, from Lisbon to Oporto when they encountered a French 74-gun ship and a frigate off the Berlengas (known to the British as the Burlings). The French vessels captured John, but Milbrook escaped.LL (10 June 1806), ‚Ññ4060. In September Carpenter resigned from Milbrook, and Lieutenant James Leach replaced him in command. On 30 August 1807, Milbrook recaptured the brig Badger, of Dublin. A little over two weeks later, on, 17 September, Milbrook, in company with the letter of marque Ceres, captured the Danish brig Kraben. Kraben was condemned to the Crown. On 26 October, Tsar Alexander I of Russia declared war on Great Britain. The official news did not arrive there until 2 December, at which time the British declared an embargo on all Russian vessels in British ports. Milbrook was one of some 70 vessels that shared in the seizure of the 44-gun Russian frigate Speshnoy (Speshnyy), then in Portsmouth harbour. The British seized the Russian storeship Wilhelmina (Vilghemina) at the same time. The Russian vessels were carrying the payroll for Vice-Admiral Dmitry Senyavin's squadron in the Mediterranean. The British consul at Oporto, and the factory both wrote letters of thanks to Leach for his services to the British trade with Oporto and the factory gave him a piece of plate worth ¬£50.Marshall (1832), Vol. 3, Part 2, pp. 408‚Äì9. Fate Milbrook arrived off Berlenga Grande Island in the Berlengas ‚Äî known traditionally to the British as \\"the Burlings\\" ‚Äî in the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Portugal on 24 March 1808 and anchored. While she was changing to a better position a squall struck her and drove her onto a reef. Her crew hauled her off and into clear water where she rode out the night. However, at 8 a.m. on 25 March, her cable fasteners gave way and she was again driven on the rocks, where she bilged. She quickly fell on her side and was lost. The crew was saved. At the subsequent court martial the letters from Oporto were read into evidence, and the court martial not only exonerated Leach but \\"deemed his conduct highly meritorious and praiseworthy\\". His officers and crew presented him with a sword worth 50 guineas as a token of their esteem. He next captained the hired armed lugger Black Joke on a special service to the Spanish coast before taking command of the bomb vessel on the Downs station.

It is located within the Hieroglyphic Mountains. History The Apache Wars discouraged development of the area until the 1880s when the springs and the adjacent land were purchased by Frank Murphy for the construction of a health resort. The resort was completed in 1896 by the brother of the Arizona Governor Oakes Murphy, and the newly renamed \\"Castle Hot Springs\\" was heavily advertised to potential clients. During the resort's heyday in the 1920s it was visited by celebrities such as Zane Grey, as well as famous families such as the Rockefellers. The resort was used by the United States military as a rehabilitation center from 1943 to 1944 to treat injured veterans of World War II. Future president John F. Kennedy spent three months at the resort during this period to recover from his wounds suffered during the sinking of his ship, PT-109. The resort continued to be commercially operated until the main building was heavily damaged in a fire in 1976. The resort still comprises its swimming pool, administrative building and guest house along with the springs, which produce 180,000 gallons of hot water a day. The resort became a stop on the short-line Arizona and California Railroad in the 1990s. The property was sold in March 2014 for $1.95 Million.Historic Arizona Resorts sells for Millions In March 2018, the resort announced a restoration was underway with plans for reopening in October of that year.

Its purpose is making the lives and issues of lesbian, bisexual and transgender women more visible, along with seeking to aid these women with various cultural programs and discussion groups. Labrisz Lesbian Association is also one of the co-founders of the Rainbow Mission Foundation - the Foundation mainly responsible for organizing the Budapest gay Pride festival each year. The name 'Labrisz' is the Hungarian word for Labrys, the ancient double-headed axe. Although it is most commonly understood to be a weapon as well as a crop harvesting tool, some claim that it was most emphatically not a weapon It is also commonly used as a feminist and lesbian symbol around the world, associated with female empowerment. Activities =Budapest Pride= Labrisz is one of the co-founders of the Rainbow Mission Foundation that is responsible for organizing the Pride Festival each year in Hungary. Labris organizes female-focused programs (mostly workshops) for the festival. =Labrisz Evenings= These are monthly discussion groups for lesbian, bisexual and transgender women with the primary aim of breaking closet doors, reducing social isolation, and helping to develop self-acceptance and to build a community. Topics range from literary nights to practical questions such as love, dating, relationship issues to more theoretical ones like the representation of women in society. =LGBT History Month in Hungary= Labrisz, arm-in-arm with H√°tt√©r Support Society for LGBT People in Hungary, joined the worldwide program series for the first time in February 2013. The aim of the history month is to help in understanding the life and culture of LGBT people, and (re)discover LGBT history through artistic, cultural and public-life events. In 2014, on the II. LGBT History Month Labrisz hosted, among various other events, a carnival party where the Association's hobby band 'Pink Csikk Para P√°nik Zenekar' celebrated its 10th birthday with a show. The party also featured a woman politician costume competition. =Lesbian Identities Festival= The Association organized its first Lesbian Identities Festival (LIFT) in the fall of 2005. It was Hungary's first one-day lesbian cultural program with film screenings, workshops, literary events, a lesbian herstory exhibition (for more, see below) and a lesbian party. The festival, whose main purpose is dissolving stereotypes about lesbians and making lesbian lives more visible, is organized yearly since 2007. Since 2009 the timespan of the festival fluctuates between a week and three days. =Lesbian Herstory Archive= In 2008 the association started a lesbian herstory project, making interviews with lesbians above 45 (in which they talk about living as a lesbian before the change of regime in Hungary in 1989) in order to create the basis of an archive and an edited volume. \\"Secret Years\\", a documentary based on 11 interviews was shown in the 2009 LIFT Festival, the volume of interviews with the same title, containing 16 interviews, was published in Hungarian in 2011. The documentary film is available on DVD with subtitles in 12 languages including English, German, French, Spanish, Russian and more. =Queen of Spades Game Club= This is a monthly gathering where women can play card and board games with each other. The club is open for anyone so it is a great opportunity to see old friends and meet new people as well. Until 2014 the events were held at a gay-friendly bar in the heart of Budapest. =Book publications= The Association also published a number of books relevant to the lives of lesbians in Hungarian. Lesbian Space Published in 1999, this is a collection of essays about lesbian herstory, politics, feminism, identity, representation and coming out.

Usage The lobstick was created by cutting off most of the lower branches of tall pine or spruce trees. The remaining tuft on the top would make the tree conspicuous from a distance. Occasionally other trees surrounding the lobstick would be cut down to further improve its visibility. In some instances, the bark was removed and names were carved on the wood. The usages could be both practical and symbolic. Lobsticks would mark trails or portages, sources of food, or hunting grounds. They were also used as cultural markers, to signify meeting places, burial grounds, ceremonial sites, personal totems or to honour someone. Lobsticks could also be known as \\"lopsticks\\" or maypoles. Explorer Warburton Pike wrote in the 1800s: \\"In giving directions to a stranger it is hopeless to describe the points and bends of a monotonous river highway, but a lop-stick does the duty of a signpost and at once settles the question of locality.\\" History First Nations communities used lobsticks since pre-history to mark trails and hunting grounds. The practice was later adopted by the first Europeans who travelled through northern Canada. Explorer Alexander Mackenzie found lobsticks on his travels and wrote that they \\"denoted the immediate abode of the natives\\". In 1790, voyageur Peter Pangman created a lobstick at Rocky Mountain House to mark the furthest extent of discovery along the Saskatchewan River. In the 1820s fur trader Alexander Ross found a lobstick marking the mouth of the Berens River. Place names Many places across Canada are named after the lobsticks that once stood there.

Created nominally in 1938 but dissolved soon after, it reemerged during World War II. A clandestine group, it opposed the fascist regime of Ion Antonescu, although its own roots were planted in authoritarian politics. Looking to the Soviet Union for inspiration, the PS»ö was cultivated by the Romanian Communist Party (PCdR), and comprised a faction of radicalized social democrats, under Lothar RƒÉdƒÉceanu. Perceived as a communist tool, the PS»ö was prevented by other parties from participating in the August 23 Coup against Antonescu. It entered its legal phase in the late months of 1944, but was soon absorbed into the more powerful Ploughmen's Front. Roots Ralea entered politics as one of the National Peasants' Party (PN»ö) intellectuals in Ia»ôi, before his 1938 move to Bucharest.Boia, pp. 78, 100, 131, 184 In this context, he was a prominent figure in the centrist faction of the party, with Armand CƒÉlinescu as his ally.Cioroianu, p. 126; Harre, p. 72 A political and social theorist, he endorsed the PN»ö's agrarian-and-corporatist notion of a \\"peasant state\\", against the social-democratic wing of the party. As scholar Angela Harre notes, Ralea and other PN»ö leaders \\"tried to use the vague picture of a peasant state to counterbalance the growing fascist impact on society with an alternative democratic state model.\\"Harre, p. 72 During that time, Ralea had established contacts with the outlawed Communist Party, and already supported its antifascist agenda.Cioroianu, p. 126; TismƒÉneanu, p. 99 PCdR contacts viewed him as one of the \\"bourgeois personalities with antifascist views.\\"Udrea, p. 550 By the 1937 election, which saw pro-democratic parties unable to maintain a clear majority, the \\"peasant state\\" doctrine looked set to crumble. Harre argues: \\"A corporatist democracy became obsolete from the middle of the 1930s on, when the strongly polarized Romanian society did not resist the split between urban modernity and a rural traditional way of life any longer.\\"Harre, p. 73 In 1938, Ralea was editor of the National Peasantist organ, Dreptatea,FrunzƒÉ, p. 116 but at odds with PN»ö leader Iuliu Maniu. He broke away from the party to establish the PS»ö, in name only. According to Corneliu Coposu, at the time a leader of the PN»ö youth, Ralea's party was \\"stillborn\\". Marin Pop, \\"√ént√¢lniri secrete √Æntre Iuliu Maniu, Nicolae D. Cocea »ôi Mihail Ralea (1942‚Äì1944)\\", in Caiete Silvane, Issue 2/2013 After King Carol II banned the PN»ö and all other mainstream parties, Ralea transformed himself into a pillar of Carol's authoritarian-corporatist National Renaissance Front (FRN). He was highly decorated by the king, and appointed Minister of Labor in March of that year.Boia, pp. 127, 131, 133‚Äì134, 141‚Äì143, 146, 148, 176, 189, 259 In this capacity, he organized the MuncƒÉ »ôi Voe BunƒÉ leisure service, directly modeled on fascist precedents such as Dopolavoro, and converted the staples of socialist propaganda in support of the FRN.Boia, pp. 141‚Äì143, 146 In 1940, the FRN regime was unable to secure Romania against Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union: the country ceded Bessarabia and Northern Transylvania, after which the regime crumbled. It was replaced by the Nazi-aligned National Legionary State, an uneasy partnership between Antonescu and the Iron Guard. The latter made efforts to prosecute figures associated with the FRN, and Ralea was consequently stripped of his academic postings. He was reinstated in 1941, after the clash between the Guard and Antonescu.Boia, pp. 176, 199‚Äì200 However, owing to Ralea's communist sympathies, Antonescu ordered his constant surveillance by Siguran»õa, the country's secret police.Boia, pp. 200, 236‚Äì237 Reestablishment Ralea's contacts with the PCdR became a nuisance once Romania joined Nazi Germany's war against the Soviet Union. From December 1942 to March 1943, he was interned alongside other dissenters in T√¢rgu Jiu camp.Boia, p. 237 Upon his release, he resumed his contacts with other dissenting academics of Ia»ôi‚ÄîIorgu Iordan, Constantin Ion Parhon, Gheorghe VlƒÉdescu-RƒÉcoasa‚Äîwith whom, the Siguran»õa noted, he intended to start a \\"political action\\". It did not materialize into a political movement. During summer 1943, Ralea resumed his contacts with the PN»ö, and was received by Maniu. This interview surprised the mainstream National Peasantists, for whom Ralea was a pariah (Maniu himself had implied that Ralea had \\"not a trace of character\\"). According to Coposu, Maniu reminded Ralea of his 1938 defection, and rejected his offer to rejoin the \\"democratic opposition\\" to Antonescu. Maniu suggested instead that Ralea and other \\"former supporters of Carol II\\" create their own \\"antihitlerite combat front, independent from the consistently democratic elements\\". He appreciated Ralea's rejection of Antonescu's \\"catastrophic orientation\\" and commitment to \\"the country's salvation\\", but noted that they could only buy him a measure of leniency \\"for that hour when we shall be evaluating the past mistakes that have thrown this country into dejection.\\" During late 1943, Ralea and other dissident National Peasantists were in Bra»ôov, where they began referring to themselves as a distinct Socialist Peasants' Party, and worked closely with an antifascist economist and doctrinaire, Victor Jinga.Udrea, pp. 555, 558 With a mandate from the PCdR, Ralea also approached Petru Groza of the Ploughmen's Front and Gheorghe TƒÉtƒÉrescu, the former Premier and leader of the National Liberal Party (PNL), who had already publicized their opposition to Antonescu's foreign policy.Udrea, p. 555 The newly (re)established PS»ö, also known as \\"Socialist Union of Workers and Peasants\\", was soon joined by RƒÉdƒÉceanu. The latter, formerly a figure of importance in the Social Democratic Party (PSDR), had earlier established his own clandestine Marxist faction.FrunzƒÉ, pp. 116‚Äì117; TismƒÉneanu, p. 83 By the time of his recruitment, RƒÉdƒÉceanu was suspected of running errands for German businessmen, and as such criticized as a collaborator.Radu, p. 103 Another figure of relative importance was Stanciu Stoian, himself a PN»ö defector,Cioroianu, p. 132 who was doubly affiliated with another underground force, the Union of Patriots.CrƒÉciun, pp. 299‚Äì300 According to historian Adrian Cioroianu, the Socialist Peasants' Party, \\"entirely minor\\", had a \\"ghostly\\" existence under Antonescu's rule.Cioroianu, pp. 126, 132 It soon approached the PCdR and, represented by Ralea and Stoian, accepted inclusion into the \\"Patriotic Antihitlerite Front\\". Journalist Victor FrunzƒÉ claimed the latter was also a shady organization, also deeming the very existence (beyond the adoption of a name) doubtful.FrunzƒÉ, p. 187 However, according to the same author, RƒÉdƒÉceanu and Ralea were among the PCdR's more credible outside sympathizers: \\"they moved to the left of the left for reasons of a personal predisposition toward totalitarianism.\\"FrunzƒÉ, p. 120 Antihitlerite Front Alongside the PN»ö, PSDR, and National Liberals, the Communists were called in to organize the August 23 Coup against Antonescu. An understanding was reached in March 1944, when the four groups set up a National Democratic Bloc (BND). The PCdR, marginally relevant in this alliance, tried to extend his influence by obtaining seats for the \\"Antihitlerite\\" parties: Ralea's PS»ö, Groza's Ploughmen's Front, and the Union of Patriots. The move was vetoed by the mainstream parties. During a new meeting with Ralea, Maniu also rejected the PS»ö offer to reunite or align itself with the PN»ö. On May 24, 1944, the PS»ö also entered a \\"National- Democratic Coalition\\", formed around the National Liberal Party‚ÄìTƒÉtƒÉrescu, which had a platform of loyalism toward King Michael I and \\"active political collaboration with the Soviets.\\" It also comprised Groza's Front, the Union of Patriots, the PSDR, MADOSZ, and remnants of the Democratic Nationalist Party, under Petre Topa.Tiberiu Dumitru CostƒÉchescu, \\"Partidul Na»õional Liberal √Æn anii regimurilor autoritare (februarie 1938 ‚Äì august 1944)\\", in Transilvania, Issue 2/2006, p. 85 Ralea and his group continued to campaign on their own. A Siguran»õa report of June 27 mentions that the PS»ö had received pledges and support from leftists such as Demostene Botez, Scarlat Callimachi, N. D. Cocea, and D. I. Suchianu. Stelian TƒÉnase, \\" 'Prin»õul Ro»ôu' \\", in Sfera Politicii, Issue 135 In July 1944, Jinga produced a manifesto for the post- Antonescu era, prophesying a socialized economy and liberal democracy.Udrea, p. 558 Ralea had nevertheless lost the support of RƒÉdƒÉceanu and his followers, who returned to the PSDR as a distinctly pro-communist inner-party faction.FrunzƒÉ, p. 117; Radu, pp. 102‚Äì103; TismƒÉneanu, p. 83 A PS»ö man, Grigore GeamƒÉnu, still had a significant part to play in the preparation of the coup, helping PCdR's Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej to break out of T√¢rgu Jiu camp.Popescu, p. 33 The BND then put an end to Antonescu's regime, aligning Romania with the Allied Powers, but also led the way for the Soviet occupation of Romania. The PS»ö emerged into legality on September 2, one of the seven parties mentioned by Premier Constantin SƒÉnƒÉtescu in his decree on the transition to democracy.Georgescu & Radu, p. 189 Its newly established daily, Dezrobirea (\\"Liberation\\"), publicized Jinga's July manifesto as a PS»ö party program. Dezrobirea also praised Ralea's own antifascism, and claimed for the PS»ö a pedigree of \\"more than six years\\" of ideological combat.Boia, p. 259 As noted by historian Lucian Boia, such statements may imply that Ralea wished to present his FRN activity and his pro-communism as a coherent whole.Boia, pp. 131, 259 Almost immediately, Ralea's party was co-opted on other PCdR- controlled alliances. The \\"Antihitlerite Front\\" was formalized on September 6, when it denounced the alliance with the PN»ö and the PNL,CrƒÉciun, p. 301 and published its appeal to the populace on September 17.Georgescu & Radu, pp. 189‚Äì190 The Front then transformed itself into a broader \\"National Democratic Front\\", in stated opposition to SƒÉnƒÉtescu's government. As members of this coalition, the Ploughmen's Front and the Socialist Peasantists had a particularly close relationship.Georgescu & Radu, p. 200 In tandem, the PS»ö grew to include other figures formerly associated with the FRN including Mihail Ghelmegeanu, Octav Livezeanu, and Tudor Vianu (chairman of the National Theater Bucharest).Boia, pp. 262‚Äì263, 271, 273 The party also received into its ranks Ralea's student, poet Teohar Mihada»ô, Vasile Iancu, Al. Husar, \\"Caracterul dƒÉ autoritate sacerdo»õiului critic\\", in Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ, Issue 24/2005 who was hiding his earlier involvement with the Iron Guard. Alex. »òtefƒÉnescu, Cicerone Ioni»õoiu, \\"Constant Tonegaru - de»õinut politic\\", in Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ, Issue 3/2002 Disestablishment and aftermath In November 1944, the PS»ö was absorbed into the Ploughmen's Front.Boia, pp. 259, 271, 273; Cioroianu, p. 154; Georgescu & Radu, p. 200 Its leader, Groza, became Prime Minister of a communist-aligned cabinet in which Ralea was Arts Minister; he would later serve as Ambassador to the United States, while Stoian became Minister of Religious Affairs.Cioroianu, pp. 127, 132, 154, 289‚Äì290; Boia, pp. 259, 334 Already by 1945, former PS»ö politicians were manifesting their opposition to communization. Soviet advisers noted with concern that Ghelmegeanu was influencing Groza to unseal his agreements with the PCdR.Cioroianu, p. 161 During his time as a diplomat, Ralea pressed the Americans to intervene in Romania and balance out Soviet influence, as a guarantee against the collectivization of peasant property.Cioroianu, p. 127 Returning to Romania after the full imposition of a communist regime, he was awarded a seat in the Great National Assembly with the formal elections of 1948.Boia, pp. 310‚Äì311, 334 By 1949, the Securitate secret police was clamping down on some less loyal PS»ö members. Mihada»ô had established contacts with the anticommunist maquis and Western countries. He was arrested and tortured, being forced to invent a conspiracy that dragged into it various members of the political and literary underworld. Ralea himself was placed under Securitate surveillance, once he began expressing his mistrust of the Communist Party. His Securitate file lists him as an \\"opportunistic element, a danger to our regime.\\"Boia, p. 334 Ghelmegeanu and Vianu were also marginalized, while Suchianu was arrested and imprisoned. Throughout the late 1950s and early '60s, Ralea maintained cordial relations with the communist leader, Gheorghiu-Dej, and backed the regime's gradual adoption of nationalist principles.TismƒÉneanu, pp. 161, 220 He died in 1964, a member of the Romanian Council of State.Boia, p. 334; Popescu, p. 35 Notes References *Lucian Boia, Capcanele istoriei.

Built in the early 1850s by O.B. Bradford, it was first known as the Bradford House/Hotel. The Ealand family, who took over the house in 1882 after O.B. Bradford's sudden death, and renamed it the Arlington. The hotel was the site of many important social occasions, including the farewell gathering in 1940 for the first group of Paris soldiers before their departure overseas during the Second World War, which was chaired by Mayor J. P. McCammon. The hotel underwent many ownership changes through the years. In the mid-90s the hotel was bought and renovated before closing in the mid-2000s. In 2014 the hotel was bought by a group of owners who renovated the hotel and restaurant. The restaurant was re-opened as \\"The Forks at the Arlington\\", a tribute to Paris being the fork of the Grand and Nith Rivers. The hotel now boasts three eateries: edit. (formerly Woolfe & Wilde, and The Forks at the Arlington), 1851 Public House (available for private parties only), and The Library Bar at The Arlington (available for private parties only). The hotel was recognized as an Ontario Heritage Site on May 15, 1990. Ownership History The Bradford House was built in the early 1850s by O.B. Bradford, an immigrant from Pennsylvania. Mr. Bradford owned the hotel until his death in May, 1882. The hotel was then owned by a Mr. Ealand who planned to open a sulfur spring spa. Unfortunately the water turned brown due to rusting pipes. He also added an extension hotel and ran the hotel until his death in 1901. The hotel was then leased to a Mr. Cornish from 1901 to 1925 until the hotel was once again operated by the Ealand family. It was operated by Eva Ealand until 1956 and then Herbert Ealand until 1962. Herbert Ealand sold the hotel to William J. Ferguson. Ferguson became a councilor in Paris and made improvements to the hotel before selling it in 1967. The hotel was bought by Torontonians George Lookers and Art McGill, who sold the hotel later that year. The hotel was then bought by Bob and Rae Anderson, who ran the hotel from 1969-1972. In 1972 the hotel was sold to Michael Perdue who ran it until late 1983 when it was bought by Adrian Parker. Parker, after attempting renovations, sold the building to Athanasios Soliriow. In 1988 Edward Brokhusens sold the hotel to brothers Joe and John Skupnik. In 1998 the brothers completely renovated the hotel and reopened it in 2000. The hotel was closed again in the mid-2000s, only to be bought and renovated again by Nils Foss, reopening to the public in June 2014. The hotel changed hands in June 2016, over to The Other Bird partnership of Erin Dunham and Matthew Kershaw. The Arlington has once again been renovated with 24 literary themed rooms. The Other Bird is a Hamilton-based hospitality group currently owns 6 restaurants, along with this hotel.

It occurs on the night of Good Friday, beginning at the El Carmen Church, where it originated, and winds through the streets of the historic center of the city of San Luis Potos√≠. During the event there are the sounds of drums and bugles, but no participant or spectator speaks, giving the event its name. It is one of the most important Holy Week observances in Mexico and was declared part of the cultural heritage of the state of San Luis Potos√≠ in 2013. Significance Organized by the Tradiciones Potosinas association, the procession commemorates as an act of mourning the Passion of Christ. It is a reenactment of the Stations of the Cross, with each station marked by a heavy platform with the relevant images. This procession is one of the most important Holy Week observances in Mexico, one of the most important religious events for the state of San Luis Potos√≠ and emblematic for the city. It is also a major tourist event, attractive over 160,000 visitors to the city, with about fifteen percent coming from outside of Mexico. The main event First brotherhood leaving the El Carmen church The procession takes place on Good Friday, in the historical center of the city of San Luis Potosi, which is filled with churches and colonial era buildings. Illuminated with candles, the area has a church-like atmosphere and even though thousands of spectators line the streets, no one will speak during the hours of the procession, which gives it the name. The main participants of the procession are the members of various religious brotherhoods, who carry and accompany large platforms with religious images through the streets. In 2013, there were thirty such brotherhoods which included the Cofrad√≠a del Virgen del Carmen, the Cofrad√≠a del Santo Entierro, Cofrad√≠a del Descendimiento, Cofrad√≠a del Ecce Homo and the Cofrad√≠a de la Soledad, which carries an image of Our Lady of Solitude. The members of the various brotherhoods are identified by the colors of their garments, which identified their home parish and shows the influence of the processions of Seville. The most noticeable participants are the costaleros, which were a special tunic and pointed hoods with cloths covering the faces. The brotherhoods participate as a form of penance, with faces covered and some even walking with chains attached to their ankles. Other participants include adults and children in various dress which include altar boys, Nazarenes, Our Lady of Macarena, Roman soldiers, women wearing traditional Potosi rebozos and carrying candles, bullfighters, politicians and artists. Women in rebozos in the procession The procession begins at the El Carmen Church at exactly 8pm. The sound of a bugle summons the Praetorian Guard which marches from the Teatro de la Paz to the El Carmen Church. The centurian knocks three times at the main door and the bugler on horseback clears the way and silences the crowd for the procession. The procession contains hundreds of people and begins by crossing the Plaza del Carmen in front of the church. Just this portion of the procession takes two hours. The entire event lasts over four hours and winds its way along the main streets of the historic center, passing landmarks such as the Mask Museum, the Government Palace the main city plaza and the cathedral over 3.5 km. The main focal points are the platforms carried by members of the brotherhoods, which can weigh up to 500 kilograms, which bear religious images adorned with fresh flowers. Some of the platforms have been made by local artisans and others imported from Seville, Spain. The participants walk slowly and solemnly, with the pace measured by drumbeats. At certain points in the procession, trumpets are sounded. There are twenty three main platform, with the end of the procession marked by that dedicated to Our Lady of Solitude. This image is ornate Baroque and created by Manuel Tols√°. and wears a Seville style cloak. The procession as part of Holy Week in San Luis Potosi The procession is the highlight of two weeks of activities related to Holy Week, which include those of religious, cultural and sporting nature, beginning on the Viernes de Dolores, the Friday before Palm Sunday. On this day, crowds gather on a small alley called Callej√≥n del Buche to create altars dedicated to the Virgin Mary as Our Lady of Sorrows. During the rest of the week more altars are assembled depicting the various Stations of the Cross, with some of these destined to be carried during the Good Friday procession. Palm Sunday is marked with a simple procession to the city cathedral for the blessing of palms. On Maundy Thursday, there is another procession with seven platforms that visit the various main neighborhoods of the city and their main churches. In the churches, the images of saints are covered on purple cloths as a sign of mourning, bread is distributed to remember the Last Supper and sprigs of chamomile are blessed. During the day on Good Friday, the main event is a reenactment of the crucifixion in the San Juan de Guadalupe neighborhood, and on Holy Saturday, the Burning of Judas occurs on the Plaza de los Fundadores. The Holy Week season stretches for two weeks and various secular events are sponsored by government and private entities during this time. These include art exhibitions, concerts, conferences, guided tours and volleyball and basketball tournaments. They also include a half marathon between Venado and Charcas and a national youth tennis tournament. History The modern event has its origins in the traditions of processions during Holy Week established in New Spain early in the colonial period, which included the hiding of the faces of participants. The first procession of silence was instituted by the Carmelites in Mexico City. However, this particular procession was officially established in 1954. At this time, bullfighters Ferm√≠n Rivera, Carmelite priest Nicol√°s de San Jos√© and others began a small event to enact the Stations of the Cross and pay homage to Our Lady of Solitude by the guild of bullfighters at the El Carmen church. It is based on the annual procession in Seville, Spain in honor of Our Lady of Macarena, although this version is dedicated to Our Lady of Solitude, because of the devotion of the bullfighters to this image of the Virgin Mary. Today, it is the only procession in Mexico to include altars depicting all stations of the cross. It was declared part of the cultural heritage of the state of San Luis Potos√≠ in 2013 as well as the most important civic and religious event of the state. In 2014, the city paid homage to the founders of the modern event, including Ferm√≠n Rivera, Mar√≠a de los √Ångeles Ag√ºero Ere√±o, Marco Tulio Jim√©nez, Carlos Artol√≥zaga Noriega and Juan Hern√°ndez Auces.

Reily Township in Butler County, Ohio is named for him. Biography John Reily was born in Chester County, Pennsylvania on April 10, 1763, and moved with his parents to Augusta County, Virginia when young. From the age of 17, Reily served in the Revolutionary War, including the Battle of Camden, the Battle of Guilford Court House, and the Battle of Eutaw Springs. After the War, Reily moved to Kentucky. In 1790 he moved to Columbia, (now a neighborhood of Cincinnati) to build John Reily's Classical School and became its first school teacher. It was one of the first schools in the territory. The school grew and he soon hired a second teacher, Francis Dunlavy. In 1799, he was elected clerk of the Legislature of the Northwest Territory, and re- elected to that position in 1800 and 1801. In 1802 he was elected as one of the seven trustees of the new town of Cincinnati. Later that year he was a representative at the Constitutional Convention that drafted Ohio's first Constitution. In 1802 he was also one of the first subscribers who purchased shares to start the Cincinnati Library, one of the first libraries in the state. He moved to Hamilton, Ohio, and was elected the first Clerk of Court for Butler County by the associate judges of the court of common pleas, a position to which he was re-elected for 37 years. He was concurrently appointed as clerk for the supreme court of Butler County, a position which he also maintained until 1842. He was also a long time Postmaster of Hamilton, and he served as County Recorder from 1803-1811. At first he worked from a small building outside the old fort at Hamilton, before moving the offices to his home, and in 1824 to the newly built court house. Reily was appointed as one of the first trustees of Miami University, and was president of the board of trustees until 1824. In 1808 he married Nancy Hunter. The Reilys had two daughters and three sons, one of whom, Robert, founded the town of Wyoming, Ohio. Reily died in Hamilton June 7, 1850. Legacy In 1807, a new township was formed by in Butler County by splitting the existing St. Clair Township. The new township was named Reily Township after John Reily.> In his positions as clerk, Reily used high quality materials. The materials, combined with his \\"bold\\" character strokes meant that his hand-written records from the early 1800s were still clearly legible in the early 1900s.

It is currently located in Zaragoza. History =First era= The General Military Academy was founded under the reign of Alfonso XII, on February 20, 1882. La Academia General The first training center was located in Alc√°zar de Toledo. The first head of the Academy was the General M√©ndez The Great.Ej√©rcito de tierra The Academy was dissolved in 1893, and later, the Armed Forces and Corps had their own separate training centers. =Second era= In 1927, during the reign of Alfonso XIII, and under the dictatorship of Primo de Rivera, the center was reestablished in Zaragoza. Primo de Rivera came to the conclusion that one of the reasons of the dissents between the Armed Forces on the promotion system based on seniority or merits of war was based on the lack of an academy in which all four Army Corps were trained together. After the Debarkation of Alhucemas, Primo de Rivera developed a great admiration for Francisco Franco, a soldier with a great reputation after the African campaigns and the foundation of the Tercio de Extranjeros with Jos√© Mill√°n Astray. On January 4, 1928, by Royal Decree, Franco was named Director of the General Military Academy.Preston, 79 Historian Eduardo Gonz√°lez Calleja interpreted the designation of Franco as \\"a gesture of reconciliation with Africanists, achieved after the operation of summer 1925. Both Primo and Franco, and the majority of colonial soldiers that formed the teacher board wanted to train a kind of official not study- oriented, with a knightly concept of the profession and without any relationship with the social media at the time whatsoever\\". After the Second Republic was established and the military reforms were applied in June 1931 by the provisional Ministry of War, the center was closed. Aza√±a didn't trust the instructions provided at the center and believed its budget was huge in a moment in which military spending was trying to be cut.Preston, 108-109 Conservative, anti-republican officials, thought the closure of the Academy was an attack to the very spirit of the Army, since the Academy was the only place in Spain in which soldiers of all kinds studied together.Jackson, 53 Franco was devastated, and after the end of the Civil War he restored the institution.Preston, 109 However, he obeyed Aza√±a's commands at the time and closed the Academy. =Third era= After the end of the Spanish Civil War and the reorganization of military studies in Spain, the General Military Academy was established again on September 27, 1940 by Minister of the Army Jos√© Enrique Varela. The old buildings used for training in the second era were used. In 1942, 170 students started studying in the Academy. Francisco Hidalgo de Cisneros y Manso de Z√∫√±iga was named Director of the Academy. Notable alumni are Juan Carlos I of Spain, and his son Felipe VI of Spain.Historia de la Academia  Current curriculum  Just like so many military academies in the world, the General Military Academy is a medium-sized, highly residential baccalaureate college, with a full-time, five-year undergraduate program that emphasizes instruction in the arts, sciences, and professions with a graduate program, preparing men and women to take on the challenge of being officers of the Spanish Army and the Civil Guard. The academy is accredited by the Ministry of Education, Culture and Sport and is a directly reporting agency of the Army general staff. = Undergraduate program - academic = The academic program consists of a structured core of subjects depending on the cadet's chosen specialty as a future Army officer, balanced between the arts and sciences. For Civil Guard cadets, additional training is focused on their law enforcement role. Regardless of major, all cadets graduate with a Bachelor of Science degree with assistance from the Central Defense University and the University of Zaragoza. = Undergraduate program - military = As all cadets are commissioned as lieutenants upon graduation, military and leadership education is nested with academic instruction. Military training and discipline fall under the purview of the Office of the Commandant of Cadets. Entering freshmen, or 4th class cadets, are referred to as New Cadets, and enter the academy on Reception Day (in September) to start off their military service training as future officers and are recognized as full cadets in a ceremony in January the following year, where they make their pledge to the National Colour and receive ceremonial daggers. The 2nd, 3rd, and 4th years of study as cadets and their final year as commissioned second lieutenants, aside from the usual academic work in military and civil subjects, also involve specialty training in the combat arms of the Army in their respective combat training schools, and for the Civil Guard, alongside military instruction its cadets receive speciality training within its own institutions for law enforcement training in various specialties suited for potential graduates.

His work deserves to be noted for what the 2002 history of Scottish architecture remarks as an approach \\"of relentless surgery or concealment.\\". His most notable works are Killin and Ardeonaig Church, Stirlingshire (1744); Archerfield House, East Lothian (1745); Finlaystone House, Renfewshire (174647), Wardhouse (Gordonhall), Insch, Aberdeenshire (1757); and Campbeltown Town House, Argyll and Bute (175860). Several of these are listed buildings.  Biography  His date and place of birth are not known. In his will, he appears as John Douglas of Pinkerton,Pinkerton is not in the 2007 Times Atlas. The place may at the Burgh of Crail and in the Shire of Fife. late architect in Leith, who died on 20 June 1778.Will of John Douglas, 20 June 1778. National Archives of Scotland CC8/8/124 The Edinburgh Recorder (records of the Edinburgh Friendly Fire Insurance Company, which began in 1720 as a loose-knit association of Edinburgh property owners for mutual financial protection against loss by fire), shows that he owned properties in High Street North at Fleshmarket Close East (Thomson‚Äôs Close) (records 2754-2757) and at Old Provost Close, East Head (record 2717).  Work as architect  John Douglas designed and renovated several country houses during the middle of the 18th century. He was considered an efficient designer and many of his projects are characterised by a horizontal hierarchy which is signposted by a central projecting body (for example, Archerfield House and Campbeltown Town House). A cache of his drawings was discovered, curated and exhibited in 1989 by Ian Gow at the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland, entitled \\"John DouglasWilliam Adam's Rival?\\". This material has been further analysed, to reveal more about his style in both executed and unexecuted designs (Archerfield House, Galloway House, Finlaystone House, and two designs for Blair Castle ). A broader study of his work shows how his designs explored the plastic treatment of the volume and the materiality of elevation in rather eclectic manners beyond his period, often though deemed too fashionable or personal D. Theodossopoulos, \\"Mannerism in the work of the ‚Äúfashionable architect‚Äù John Douglas in 18th century Scotland\\" conference paper, 2015 https://www.dropbox.com/s/bavfuldyy2we1xt/John%20Douglas%20vocabulary%20and%20practice%20conference%20paper%202015.pdf?dl=0 . He is an interesting less-known case of the early 18th century context in Scotland characterised by the professional establishment of architectural practice and a more conscious exploration of personal styles and external influences, often treatises. Analysis of his major buildings (Archerfield (1745-9), Finlaystone House (1746-7), Wardhouse (1757); student halls in St. Salvator‚Äôs (1754-58); the disastrous intervention in Holyrood Abbey church (1760); and the town halls for Lochmaben (1756) and Campbeltown (1760)) show a characteristic treatment of the materiality of elevations and a mannerism that is restrained and more influenced by the earlier Palladianism of Inigo Jones than James Gibbs. More on his professional practice can be revealed from the study of the building contracts for Archerfield and Finlaystone for example, as also the litigation with his journeyman George Paterson (Lybell) State and Report in the Process George Patterson, Writer at Newmills (Pursuer) Against John Douglas, Architect in Edinburgh (Defender). Date 1762. National Records of Scotland CS232/P/3/18 , which also confirm disputed authorship of his work  List of buildings  A book by Howard Colvin lists several of his projects, but some of the facts are incorrect (for example, Douglas was indeed responsible for the disastrous repair of the church of Holyrood Abbey in 1760 and the dispute over non-payment of the rest of his fees was resolved only after his death).

One report suggested that actors wishing to break into this line of work should go to acting class and become experts in skills such as gunplay, sword fighting, dance, general body movement, running and jumping, gymnastics, and hand-to-hand fighting.

Fox & Co. from 1938 to 1959. Upon her father's death in 1938, she took over the Hartford, Connecticut-based G. Fox & Co. Under her stewardship, it became the largest department store in New England. While executive of this enterprise she also led the nation in labor reform programs such as the 40-hour work week and a retirement program. As a female executive, she recognized the importance of educating women in business and management. From 1938-1959 she made her store available to the Connecticut College for Women (now Connecticut College) as a training program for retail education. After creating the Beatrice Fox Auerbach Foundation, she began extensively investing her time in various philanthropies. In 1945, she established the Service Bureau for Women's Organizations. After 29 years as an executive, Auerbach sold the business to the May Company in 1965, declaring that ‚ÄúOne thing you can be certain of is that I won‚Äôt be spending it on yachts and horses, but for the benefit of the people.‚Äù Auerbach died in Hartford on November 29, 1968. She was inducted into the Connecticut Women's Hall of Fame in 1994.  Early life and education  Beatrice Fox was born to a Jewish family on July 17, 1887 in Hartford, Connecticut. Born to Moses and Theresa Fox, she was the eldest of two daughters. Her father Moses was the son of Gerson Fox, founder of the G. Fox and Co. department store in Hartford, CT; an enterprise of which she would later become the president. While Beatrice was well traveled and attended several schools, she did not obtain a degree. After marrying George Auerbach in 1911, Beatrice moved to Salt Lake City where his family owned a department store. While Auerbach did not graduate from college, she was awarded honorary degrees at Trinity College, Wesleyan University, and Saint Joseph College. = Adult life = In 1916, Auerbach gave birth to her first child, Georgette. In 1917, the family returned to Hartford to recover from a fire at G. Fox & Co. Their second child, Dorothy, was born in Connecticut in 1919. Upon her father's death in 1938, she took over the G. Fox & Co department store. Under her stewardship, it became the largest department store in New England. While executive of this enterprise she also led the nation in labor reform programs such as the 40-hour work week and a retirement program. After 27 of years as executive, Auerbach sold the business to The May Department Stores Company in 1965, declaring that ‚ÄúOne thing you can be certain of is that I won‚Äôt be spending [the profits from the sale] on yachts and horses, but for the benefit of the people.‚Äù Auerbach died in Hartford on November 29, 1968. After her death, one-third of her estate, which accumulated several million dollars, went to the Beatrice Fox Auerbach Foundation. Auerbach left the rest of her money to friends and employees, as well as the Koopman and Schiro Funds, which, established by her daughters, supported charitable, educational, and cultural philanthropic efforts.  Career  Auerbach took over her family business in 1938, after her father died. Under her leadership, G. Fox and Co. became the largest department store in America. There, she commanded a workforce of 3-5,000 people at a time. Auerbach was a labor reform pioneer, instituting the five-day, 40-hour work week, retirement plans and paid sick leave. She also gave interest-free loans to employees in crisis. As an executive, she revolutionized the industry with her free delivery service, telephone order service and automated billing. Auerbach also made it a priority to hire Black women and men to work in her store. In 1939, she established the Moses Fox Club, named for her father. This club gave membership to employees who had given 25 years of service to G. Fox and Co. Her generosity made her a well-loved boss, and she was known as ‚ÄúMrs. A.‚Äù to her staff. In addition to the Moses Fox Club, Auerbach invited employees to dine with her at the store‚Äôs cafeteria on their birthdays. Around the holidays, Auerbach was known to have walked the sales floor, shaking hands with each member of her staff and addressing each by their names. In addition to her full-time job, Auerbach also served on the Board of Trustees of the Hartford College for Women, the American School for the Deaf, and at Hebrew Union College, as well as being a delegate at the White House Conference on Education in 1955.  Philanthropy  Auerbach was dedicated to enriching not only the lives of her workers, but her community as well. With the wealth that she had accumulated from the success of G. Fox and Co., she founded the Beatrice Fox Auerbach Foundation, a charitable and educational organization dedicated to enriching the public \\"regardless of creed, sex, color, or race.\\"Connecticut College Archives Through her foundation, Auerbach donated to organizations, hospitals, and institutions of higher education, and made contributions to St. Francis, Mt. Sinai, and Hartford hospitals, and to subsidized programs for the Hartford Symphony and Wadsworth Atheneum Museum of Art. From 1938-1959, she worked with the Connecticut College for Women (now Connecticut College) in a retailing program. She found this to be important as one of the few women in her field at the time. In 1941, the foundation was poised to become a corporation. This move gained strong support from Secretary of State Chase Going Woodhouse, and was called \\"the solution to the problem\\" facing Hartford by Judge Elsner, who presided over this decision. Four years later in 1945, Auerbach established the Service Bureau for Women's Organizations. The goal of this was to teach women how to coordinate activities, run meetings and be effective lobbyists. On July 6th 1944, just one month after D-Day, the famous Ringling Brothers Barnum & Bailey Circus fire occurred in Hartford, causing over 100 deaths and many serious injuries. Mrs Auerbach sent 500 sandwiches and 25 gallons of coffee to Municipal Hospital, which was overwhelmed with many casualties. Hearing that there was a shortage of bedding and night clothes, she also sent over a truckload of brand new sheets and pajamas the G Fox price tags still attached.The Circus Fire by Stewart O'Nan 2002 = Auerbach major = Because of her work as one of the few women in business administration, Auerbach decided to form a major that prepared young women for higher-level positions. She felt that because ‚ÄúThere [were] a number of institutions offering such preparation to young men. The need of more such opportunities for young women [was] self- evident.‚ÄùConnecticut College Archives From 1938‚Äì1959, she worked with the Connecticut College for Women (now Connecticut College) in a retailing program. To gain this degree Auerbach proposed that women take classes in psychology, history, foreign language, economics, and English, focusing on business correspondence. During their junior year, the women would take part in a service learning at a business in their field to gain real-life experience. This major was not seen as a new department, but a collaboration between Gov, home economics, social science, and art. To start this program, Auerbach donated $1,350 ($22,634.25 USD today) for the preliminary planning period, and $10,000 ($167,661.11 today) for the two year development of the major. Chase Going Woodhouse, an economics professor at Connecticut College at the time, described Auerbach as having a ‚Äúforward way of looking at education.‚Äù Examples of the classes taken: * Economic History * Social and Intellectual History * Basic Statistical Concepts * Accounting * Banking * Corporation Finance * Investment Principles * Insurance * Labor problems After graduating, the women who completed the Auerbach Major went on to do great things: Seven women ended up in department store work; Eight were working for the government, two in Naval intelligence, and one working for the Office of Price Administration, where it was said that her experience through the Auerbach major lead them to hire her; one was a travelling instructor for a large business machine company; along with many other accomplishments. Although the major was dissolved in 1959, the Auerbach Foundation continued to support a lecture series at the college. In 1951, the Auerbach foundation supported the Service Bureau for Women‚Äôs Organizations Conference at Connecticut College.  Awards and recognition  Auerbach was on the board of Hebrew Union College in Cincinnati and won numerous awards such as the Tobe award for distinguished service by others in her industry, a certificate of lifetime membership in the NAACP, ‚ÄúBoss of the Year‚Äù from the Greater Hartford Jaycees, the Distinguished Public Service Award from the State Bar Association in 1962 and the Human Relations Award of the Connecticut-Western Massachusetts Region of the National Conference of Christians and Jews in 1964. The School of Business Administration at the University of Hartford named Auerbach Hall in her honor, the library at the Wadsworth Atheneum Museum of Art was renamed the Auerbach Art Library, and a new unit was built under her name at St. Francis Hospital in Hartford, CT. Awards she received included: * Tob√© Award, given to a retailer who benefits their community and retailing nationwide (1947) * ‚ÄúBoss of the Year‚Äù from the Greater Hartford Jaycees (1952) * The Distinguished Public Service Award from the State Bar Association (1962) * The Human Relations Award of the Connecticut-Western Massachusetts Region of the National Conference of Christians and Jews (1964). * She also received posthumous induction into the Connecticut Women‚Äôs Hall of Fame. * Recognition in other forms included honorary degrees at Trinity College, Saint Joseph College, and Wesleyan University. * The School of Business Administration at the University of Hartford named Auerbach Hall in her honor * The library at the Wadsworth Atheneum Museum of Art was renamed as the Auerbach Art Library References Category:1887 births Category:1968 deaths Category:Businesspeople from Hartford, Connecticut Category:American Jews ","title":"Beatrice Fox Auerbach"},{"id":"43121164","text":"Daniel R. \\"Dan\\" Gernatt Sr. (February 7, 1917 ‚Äì May 5, 2014) was an American entrepreneur, businessman, horseman, and dairy farmer in Collins, New York.

Background In 1927, the Gore Borough Council transferred its local power supply assets to the Southland Electric Power Board (later to become Power Co), in return for Power Co supplying all the council's electricity for 1 penny a unit \\"for all time hereafter.\\" THE Board further agrees to supply to the Council all electric energy required by the Council for street lamps, pumping water, sewage or other material, Town Hall and Borough Offices, Town Clock, all municipal buildings, including Fire Brigade Station, Electric-power Station, Public Library and other buildings under the control and management of the Council and all electric energy required by the Council for its own use in any municipal undertaking at the price of one penny per unit payable quarterly on the last days of March, June, September and December in each year,... THE provisions of this Deed shall be binding upon the Board and Council for all time hereafter. The Gore Borough Council has become the Gore District Council, and SEPB has become TPC, \\"The Power Company\\". With no mechanism for increasing the price to allow for inflation, etc., this contract subsequently became somewhat onerous for Power Co, as by 1994 the unit price of electricity had increased by 770%. On top of that, the council's power usage had also increased by 840%. Faced with an annual loss of $188,000 in supplying the council's electricity under the contract, in 1995 Power Co gave the council 15 months' notice of termination of the contract, citing that the ability to terminate the contract was implied, and failing that, that the contract was frustrated due to the change of circumstances that has occurred since 1927, including the substantial inflation. Decision The court ruled that a contract for an indefinite term whilst may be rare, is not forbidden under contract law. The court also denied the contract was frustrated as contracts are not frustrated just because they turn out to be bad bargains.

Background Harding sold their farm to Coburn. Unfortunately, the parties neglected to get the sale approved by the Court, as required under s25(4) of the Land Settlement Promotion and Land Acquisition Act [1952]. Under this Act, failure to obtain such a consent made the sale \\"unlawful and shall have no effect\\".

Malan is a public Afrikaans medium co-educational high school situated in the suburb of Boston, Bellville in the Western Cape province of South Africa - near Cape Town. It was named after D.F Malan, the prime minister of South Africa from 1948 to 1954.. In 2012 and 2013, the school was included in The Cambridge University Student Guide to Excellence, a selection of 100 top schools worldwide. In recent years, it has been one of the academically top-performing schools in the Western Cape. History The school was established in 1951. D Brink was the first principal up to 1969. He was followed by: E Smit 1970-1977, H Franzen 1978-186, C de Jager 1986-1988, B Volschenk 1989-1996, R Truter 1996-2007, Joe Dorfling 2007-2016 and currently Sias Conradie. Music scene DF Malan is also notable for producing several famous musicians on the local South African music scene, such as Pierre Greeff and Hunter Kennedy. Consequently, many local bands including aKing, Foto na Dans, Jax Panik, Lukraaketaar, Die Heuwels Fantasties and Frik13 are associated with the school. This, along with the fact that other similar musicians attended neighbour school Bellville, has led to the Bellville area, in which these schools are situated, earning the nickname \\"Bellville Rock City\\". Also on the music scene DF Malan produced musician Loki Rothman, who reached the final of SA's Got Talent in 2009 (while still a senior in the school), and the founding members of Cape Town alt-pop duo EMERGER: Emma de Goede and Gerrit \\"Gerry\\" Matthee. Their debut single \\"Break & Fall\\" was a winner of the international Avid and Abbey Road Studios Song Contest and they were featured as Apple Music's New Artist Spotlight in July 2018. Alumni Other notable alumni include former Springbok rugby player Werner Greeff, ballet dancer Eduard Greyling and the dean of Engineering at the University of Stellenbosch, Prof Arnold Schoonwinkel. Actors Leigh Wakeford, Albert Maritz and 7de Laan duo Chris Vorster and Corn√© Crous all attended DF Malan. Sister School DF Malan has a sister-school in Kortrijk, Belgium and some of the students from these schools usually visit each other yearly. Athletics DF Malan High School annually participates in the MTBS athletics competition, along with three other schools from the Bellville area: Bellville, Tygerberg and Stellenberg. MTBS is especially well known for the performance of these schools' non-participating pupils on the pavilion as they perform songs and cheers to encourage their athletes during the day - for which a trophy is also awarded. DF Malan has thus far been the second most successful school in the singing trophy - winning it two time less than Stellenberg. It is in the athletics, however, where the school achieved unprecedented success - winning the trophy all but three times in the first 19-years of the competition. Other events The school also participates in a yearly Interschools event (week-long derby) with its local rival Bellville High School, in which the schools contest on most platforms - including Rugby , Field hockey , Netball, Cross country, Chess, Debate, Mountain biking and, from 2013 onwards, EA Sports FIFA. The first team rugby, hockey and netball matches are the main events. In recent years Bellville has strongly dominated the rugby, DF Malan Ho√´rskool strongly dominating both Boys' and Girls' hockey (although Bellville won the 2012 girls hockey match). The netball is usually an unpredictable affair.

They described how many of the cave formations had been soiled by visitors' hands. They examined the Main Cave and reported that it was ‚Äúwell worth preserving‚Äù. Anderson (1924) similarly concluded that the caves were well worth preserving. In August 1932, 1000 specimens of cave formations were removed from the lower level of Cliefden Main Cave by the Australian Museum for the purpose of creating a cave exhibit in the museum. The material collected proved to be insufficient and a further 1000 specimens were collected in April 1934. In the 1950s Stevens was able to show the limestone was of Ordovician age, the first recording of limestone from this period in New South Wales.Proceedings of the Linnean Society of NSW,Vol77 1952 p114 Geologists around the world regard it as a superb example of an Ordovician island faunal assemblageAustralia's fossil heritage: a catalogue of important Australian fossil sites; Australian Heritage Council, published by CSIRO Publishing 2012 By the 1950s, the Cliefden caves had become popular with speleological groups.

Shell fossils The area is particularly rich in fossil material and has become known as one of the best documented Late Ordovician successions in Australia. The book \\"Australia's fossil heritage\\" states that \\"The site is unusual because of the well exposed, diverse faunas showing the progression from near-shore to deep water marine environments. It contains abundant examples of some of the earliest shell beds in the geological record and the earliest rugose corals known. More than 180 species have been recorded from the Cliefden Caves Limestone Group and the Malongulli Formation. The Cliefden Caves - Belubula River Valley sites contain the best exposures of Late Ordovician island marine invertebrate fossil assemblages in Australia. The sites include the type localities for over 100 species.\\"  Description  The Cliefden Caves area in the Central Tablelands of NSW is located between the towns of Carcoar and Canowindra. The caves are situated in the Belubula River valley. Much of the valley has been cleared for cropping on the river flats and grazing on the hillsides. Steeper areas of exposed limestone retain more of their original vegetation, including large areas of the critically endangered ecological community White Box - Yellow Box - Blakely's Red Gum Grassy Woodland. The Belubula Valley is excavated in rocks of the Late Ordovician Period, including (in ascending order) the Walli Volcanics, Cliefden Caves Limestone, Malongulli Formation and Angullong Volcanics. The region surrounding the Cliefden Caves is an internationally significant palaeontological and geological site that records the evolution of a tropical volcanic island over an interval of about 5 million years, from the development of a fringing lagoonal and atoll to its eventual subsidence and drowning. Superimposed on this history is the relatively recent Cliefden Caves karst system. The Ordovician limestone is particularly fossiliferous and the area has long been known nationally and internationally as having the best late Ordovician outcrops in Australia. The fossils include the world's oldest known in-situ brachiopod shell beds, some of the earliest- known rugose corals in the geological record, and (in the overlying Malongulli Formation) one of the most diverse deep-water sponge faunas ever recorded. Many genera and species of fossils are unique to the area. Many of the fossils are found in the rocks forming Fossil Hill, comprising spectacularly exposed dipping strata spanning a period of just over one million years. Fossils have also been described from the limestone on the adjacent Dunhill Bluff and Trilobite Hill, and from the siltstones and interbedded limestones between Trilobite Hill and Coppermine Creek. The Cliefden Caves karst system is one of the most cavernous limestone areas in New South Wales and contains over 100 recorded caves. The larger caves include Main Cave, Murder, Boonderoo, Trapdoor, Taplow Maze, Island, Transmission and Malongulli. More than 90 karst features have been identified, including well developed caves, dolines, tufa deposits and a warm (thermal) spring. The caves contain numerous and diverse speleothems, including extensive arrays of helictites, large dogtooth spar crystals, blue speleothems and \\"boxwork\\" ceilings in addition to more commonly found speleothems such as stalagmites, stalactites, shawls and flowstone. The speleothems at Cliefden range in colour from clear through pure white, yellow orange and several rare formations of sky blue and aqua green. All the major caves are locked and gated to protect them, however speleological and scientific work is allowed under a strict permit system. The landscape also provides evidence of a range of above-ground karst features such as karren and dolines. A thermal spring in the area is one of only three thermal springs associated with karst in NSW. Studies of the Tufa (calcite) deposits on Davis Creek have contributed to knowledge of the late Holocene period change. The area is a microbat hotspot with 15 confirmed species and another three species possibly present. One of the caves is used as an overwintering habitat for Miniopterus schriebersii oceanensis (Eastern Bentwing Bat) and another is used as a maternity cave for Rhinolophus megaphyllus (Common Horseshoe Bat). Rothery's Ruins The site contains features associated with the historical development of the place. These include Rothery's Ruins and the Old Barite Mine. = Condition of the caves = In common with most other karst of the Central West, the Cliefden karst has been cleared of native vegetation for grazing and cropping and suffered associated changes to groundwater. Grazing pressure and other human activity over 175 years have had profound impacts on the endemic flora of the region, especially the karst specific species and communities at Cliefden, which remain poorly conserved. The caves system and surface exposures of the fossil beds remain intact and retain a high degree of integrity, despite increasing pressure from over-collecting of specimens.  Scientific value The NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service states that \\"...lesser known karst environments can also contain extensive and well- developed karst features, like those at Cliefden and Walli. In some cases these features are of regional and state significance, highlighting the importance of all karst environments, whether publicly or privately managed.\\" The report also states that \\"Thermal springs ... are rare in NSW and, besides Wee Jasper, occur only at Cliefden and Yarrangobilly caves. The report also describes Cliefden Caves as an important karst site.Guide to New South Wales Karst and Caves, NPSW, Department of Environment, Climate Change4 & Water, 2010, pp 5, 29 & 38 With more than one hundred recorded caves,Australian Speleological Federation Inc, Karst DatabaseOsborne, R.A.L., 1978: Structure, Sediments and Speleogenesis at Cliefden Caves, New South Wales, Helictite, 16(1): 3-32. Cliefden Caves is one of the most cavernous limestone areas in New South Wales. The caves at Cliefden have a network pattern guided by geological structure. While they are located close to the Belubula River, there is no evidence that streams or the river have ever flowed through the caves. The caves show evidence of solution by rising groundwater possibly related to the adjacent thermal spring. One of the most significant caves at Cliefden is Taplow Maze Cave with a network of passages over 3 km long (survey in progress by the Sydney University Speleological Society). Compared with other scientifically studied caves in central-western NSW (Walli, Borenore, Stuart Town & Wellington), Cliefden Caves contain an abundance and great diversity of speleothems (stalagmites & stalactite etc.) most in very good condition, including significant deposits of helictites, rare blue stalactites Turner, K. 2002: Chromophores Producing Blue Speleothems at Cliefden, NSW. Helictite 38(1): pp. 3-6. known from only one other locality in NSW, and very rare polyhedral, monocrystalline stalactites and columns (Osborne, 1978). Some of the sediments at Cliefden Caves, particularly the laminated muds are quite unlike those other NSW caves. They contain unusual minerals and an important record of past environments. Deposits of fossil bones occur in several caves, but have been little studied. Molnar et al. identified a Ghost Bat tooth from Cliefden making Cliefden Caves one of the most southerly locations for this genus, now restricted to warmer parts of Australia with a minimum January temperature above 20 degrees.MOLNAR, M.E., HALL, L.S.& MAHONEY, J.H. 1984. New fossil localities for Macroderma Miller, 1906 (Chiroptera: Megadermatidae) in New South Wales and its past and present distribution in Australia. Australian Mammalogy 7(2): 63-73 Unlike the fossil sites, there has been little recent scientific research on Cliefden Caves, mainly due to a shortage funding and of cave science specialists. The caves have great research potential, particularly in relation to the determination of past climates and hydrological conditions. The construction of a dam at the Needles Gap site on the Belubula River will completely flood most of the caves, destroying their heritage value and preventing future study. Other dam sites called Cranky Rock and Cranky Rock Alternate also affect the Cliefden area.  Davys Creek Tufa Dams Active tufa dams in creeks are uncommon in NSW and have received little study. The tufa dams in Davys Creek are the most studied in the State. Drysdale et al.DRYSDALE, R., LUCAS, S. & CARTHEW, K. 2003. The influence of diurnal temperatures on the hydrochemistry of a tufa-depositing stream. Hydrological Processes 17: 3421‚Äì3441 showed that deposition at the tufa dams was dependent on weather conditions, making tufa dams a likely source of information about past climatic conditions. Carthew and Drysdale CARTHEW, K.D. & DRYSDALE, R.N. 2010. Late Holocene fluvial change in a tufa depositing stream: Davys Creek, New South Wales, Australia. Australian Geographer 34(1), 123‚Äì139 demonstrated that it was possible to use information from the tufa deposits to construct a history of stream development in Davys Creek. Both these papers illustrate the scientific potential of the geoheritage features at Cliefden Caves.  Thermal Spring A thermal spring is located on the Belubula River near the caves. It is only one of three thermal springs associated with karst in NSW.Guide to New South Wales Karst and Caves, NPSW, Department of Environment, Climate Change4 & Water, 2010, p 29 It was first recorded by Wilkinson in 1892,Records of Geological Survey of NSW 1982, iii, part1 p5 and an analysis of the water appears in a report by Oliver Trickett in 1908.Annual Report of the Department of Mines, 1908, p172 Warm springs rising from Palaeozoic rock (as opposed to those from the Australian Basin) are rare in NSW with only three documented, all in karst areas. These are the Cliefden Warm Spring, a warm spring at Wee Jasper and the warm spring at Yarrangobilly Caves. There has been little study of warm springs in NSW.Despite assertions to the contrary, the Cliefden Thermal Spring is not on private property and is accessed via a public road.  Threat from Dam Proposals for water storages on the Belubula River date back more than half a century. Sites exist between Carcoar and Canowindra and several of these would adversely affect Cliefden Caves and surrounding areas. The site most mentioned is at The Needles, where the river has cut a narrow gap through a resistant zone of conglomerates, quartzite and sandstones. Any dam at this site, only 2.5 km from the caves, would inundate most of the known caves, the thermal spring, most of the fossil sites, and large areas of the rich alluvial agricultural flats (see map at Dam Proposals). The NSW Government enacted State Heritage protection to the area in August 2017. The present landowners maintain an active interest in them and are well aware of their value and restrict access.  Heritage listing  Heritage boundaries for the natural and cultural landscape The Cliefden Caves Area is of state significance for its importance in the geological evolution of NSW. The area provides evidence of a lithological/sedimentological sequence that contributes to the understanding of the geological evolution of eastern Australia at a time when that part of the continent was submerged in the palaeo-Pacific Ocean. The area contains the best exposures of Late Ordovician island marine invertebrate fossil assemblages in Australia and is recognised, internationally, as an outstanding example of an Ordovician island faunal (shelly fossils) and floral (algae) assemblage. The fossil evidence is a record of rich biodiversity and includes several fossil species such as the Belubula spectacula that do not occur anywhere else in the world. The Cliefden Caves karst system is one of the most cavernous limestone areas in New South Wales and contains 67 recorded caves with more than 120 karst features identified, including well developed caves, dolines, tufa deposits and a rare thermal spring. The caves contain numerous and diverse speleothems, including extensive arrays of helictites, large dogtooth spar crystals, rare blue speleothems and \\"boxwork\\" ceilings in addition to more commonly found speleothems such as stalagmites, stalactites, shawls and flowstone. The area is important for its social values, being spiritually significant to Waradjuri traditional owners who continue to visit the site for ritual purposes and cultural obligations to the land. It is also highly regarded by scientific and speleological organisations and individuals, both in Australia and internationally. The Cliefden Caves Area is the subject of current, ongoing research in the areas of palaeontology, karst processes, climate change, geology, hydrology and archaeology. It is an outstanding resource with the potential for research in all these areas of study to contribute to an understanding of the natural history of NSW. Skeletal remains located within the caves provide evidence of human occupation more than 6,000 years before the present day. Together with a number of carved trees in the area, they have the potential to yield information on pre-European cultural history. Cliefden Caves is historically significant as the site of the first discovery of limestone in mainland Australia by surveyor G.W. Evans in 1815. The remnant structures known as 'Rothery's Ruins', located on Island Flat are associated with the Cliefden Estate and have the potential to yield further information on the functioning and significance of the Cliefden Estate. Cliefden Caves Area - Natural and Cultural Landscape was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 30 August 2017 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. ;Natural: The Belubula Valley and Cliefden Caves area is important in the geological evolution of NSW in preserving the development and decline of a volcanic island succession, which is a rarely preserved and relatively short-lived phenomenon in the geological timescale. Limestones deposited in the Cliefden Caves area over a period of 5 million years, and the contact of the limestone with the underlying volcanics, provides evidence of a lithological/sedimentological sequence that contributes to the understanding the geological evolution of eastern Australia when the eastern third of the continent was largely submerged in the palaeo-Pacific Ocean. The area contains well preserved geomorphic evidence for uplift and valley incision and the caves record the evolution of the area's hydrogeology. The Cliefden Caves - Belubula River Valley contains the best exposures of Late Ordovician island marine invertebrate fossil assemblages in Australia and is recognised, internationally, as an outstanding example of an Ordovician island faunal (shelly fossils) and floral (algae) assemblage. Fossil Hill, Dunhill Bluff and Trilobite Hill are recognised as icons of Australia's palaeontological heritage, having well preserved shell, coral, and trilobite- bearing strata. The fossil evidence is a record of a rich biodiversity in this area, with 191 genera and 263 species of fossils documented in the vicinity. Several fossil species, such as the trimerellide brachiopod Belubula spectacula do not occur anywhere else in the world. The fossils record also defines biogeographic affinities in places that are now quite remote from each other, for example, the genus Belubula is found only in Cliefden and Zhuhuia in South China, providing evidence that during the Ordovician period these regions were situated far closer together than their present geographic setting, having separated as a result of subsequent plate tectonic movement. The Cliefden Caves karst system is one of the most cavernous limestone areas in New South Wales containing over 100 recorded caves. The system contains an extensive range of karst features, including caves, dolines, tufa deposits and a warm (thermal) spring. The caves contain numerous and diverse speleothems, including helictites, large dogtooth spar crystals, blue speleothems and \\"boxwork\\" ceilings in addition to more commonly found speleothems such as stalagmites, stalactites, shawls and flowstone. The speleothems at Cliefden range in colour from clear through pure white, yellow orange and several rare formations of sky blue and aqua green. ;Cultural: The Belubula Valley, as part of the Lachlan River system was home to the Wiradjuri language group of the Aboriginal people where they existed as hunters and fishers till around the 1830s when early European settlement began along the rivers. Aboriginal skeletal remains in one of the caves, along with a number of carved trees in the vicinity, indicate the presence of Aboriginal people from at least 6000 years ago. Cliefden Caves is the site of the first discovery of limestone in mainland AustraliaSurveyor G.W. Evans in 1815(Oxley, 1820 in Webby and Packham, 1982). The Cliefden Caves area and the Belubula Valley has been the focus of study and visitation by the international scientific community to research the fossil beds and by speleological groups to map the caves and record their distinctive speleothems. The remnant structures known as 'Rothery's Ruins', located on Island Flat, are associated with the SHR-listed Cliefden Estate and have the potential to yield further information on the functioning and significance of the Cliefden Estate. The place has strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The Wiradjuri traditional owners of the Cliefden Caves Area value the place as part of the broader Lachlan River and Mount Canobolas landscape, significant in Wiradjuri lore as a creation place and considered to be sacred and powerful, being imbued with the spirits of their ancestors. The caves in particular, have special significance to traditional ceremonial practice and beliefs, as a place of reverence for certain spiritual beings. The Wiradjuri people retain a strong connection to the place, using the caves for ritual purposes, visiting the hot spring, collecting coloured ochres and fishing for native species in the Belubula River. Connection with the place allows continued cultural practice and the carrying out of responsibility and obligation to the land. It is important to the community's sense of place, cultural preservation and community wellbeing. The place is also highly regarded by caving organisations and by karst and fossil scientists, both in Australia and internationally. The high level of interest in the site is demonstrated by the overwhelming support for its listing. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. ;Natural: The Cliefden Caves Limestone Group is the subject of current, ongoing research in the areas of paleontology, karst processes, climate change, geology, hydrology and archaeology. It is an outstanding resource with the potential for research in all these areas of study to contribute to an understanding of the natural history of NSW. The region has been the subject of several palaeontological field excursions associated with major international scientific conferences held in Sydney and Orange over the past three decades. As a direct result of these field trips, ongoing collaborative research projects into various aspects of the fossils from this area have been established between NSW palaeontologists and those from China and the Czech Republic. The well preserved geomorphic evidence of the Belubula Valley and the Cliefden Caves record of the area's hydrogeology, have the potential to yield further information on the landscape evolution of the Eastern Highlands. Mud deposits in the caves contain minerals that contain a record of past environments. Tufa Dams on Davy's Creek hold evidence of past climate events. The Cliefden Caves and Belubula Valley are considered a bat \\"hot spot\\", with over fifteen species of bats identified in the area and two species inhabiting the caves year round - The Eastern Bentwing Bat (Miniopterus schreibersii) which is listed as \\"Vulnerable\\" under the NSW TSC Act (1995); and the Eastern Horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus megaphyllus) . The extremely high level of microbat activity and species richness in Cliefden Caves and the Belubula Valley has the potential to yield information on microbats. ;Cultural: Skeletal remains provide evidence of human occupation more than 6,000 years before the present day. Together with a number of carved trees in the area, they have the potential to yield information on pre-European cultural history. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Ordovician rocks in the Cliefden area contain many fossils unique in Australia and occasionally unknown elsewhere in the world, such as the brachiopod species Belubula spectacula. Particularly significant specimens include the world's oldest known in-situ brachiopod shell beds (from Fossil Hill), the earliest rugose corals found anywhere on Earth (also from Fossil Hill), well-preserved trilobite fossils (Trilobite Hill), and an exceptionally diverse deep-water sponge assemblage (Coppermine Creek and Gleesons Creek localities, both tributaries of the Belubula River). The thermal spring is a rare feature, as one of only three thermal springs associated with Karst in NSW. The tufa dams are also uncommon in NSW in being active, i.e., continually forming with new deposits. Mud deposits in the caves contain unusual minerals. Blue speleothems such as the pale blue flowstone in Taplow Maze Cave and azure blue stalactites in Boonderoo and Murder Cave are exceptionally rare in Australia. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. Cliefden Caves demonstrates a broad range of karst characteristics and ranks as one of the most diverse cave groups in NSW.

Bolt was the second child out of six daughters and went to school at Lasell Seminary, however rumor had it that she was not very good at mathematics which is ironic considering her later career. At 18, she was a timekeeper at the Dudley Hosiery Knitting Mill. She became forewoman of the sewing department within five years. Despite an influx of women into the textile industry, a forewoman was a novelty. Textile legacy Boit eventually became superintendent of Allston Mills in 1883 when she was 34. She formed a partnership with Charles N. Winship, who was fourteen years her junior, in 1888 and they founded the Harvard Knitting Mill, which specialized in women's undergarments. They moved the business to Wakefield and completed a plant there in 1897. Boit had an incredibly successful plant, having to expand it in 1901, 1903, 1907, and 1911, and at its height occupied a floor space of eight and half acres and employing an estimated 850 employees. Boit was known for her generosity and set up a profit-sharing program for her employees. At this time, she was the only woman that was actively engaged in such a successful textile business. At its peak, the plant had 850 employees and produced 24,000 garments per day. She turned over her interest in the business by the 1920s to Charles Winship, though she continued to invest in the mill and visit it daily. Boit never married, instead focusing her life on her mill and her extended family. In her final years, she fell ill and then died on November 14, 1932. Her home, the Elizabeth Boit House, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989.

The Strathbogie Ranges are located approximately north-east of Melbourne, Victoria.  Geology and ecology  The range is the remains of a granite uplifted plateau in the southern part of the ranges and volcanic eruption in the north which formed a wide cauldron volcano. The topography consists of a series of ridges dissected by streams. The Strathbogie Ranges are north of the main Great Dividing Range, separated by the Goulburn and Broken River valleys. This separation has produced unique biogeographic and ecological patterns.Strathbogie Ranges ‚Äì Nature View, Flora, fauna & natural history of the Strathbogie Ranges, Victoria, Australia. Some of the more prominent peaks of the range include Mount Strathbogie (), Mount Wombat (), Sugarloaf () and Mount Barranhet (). History The Strathbogie Ranges are located in Taungurong country (link). Although the documented white history of the area generally asserts that the mountain range was not often frequented by indigenous people (Strathbogie Centenary 1877-1977), stone artifacts are widely distributed across the Strathbogie Tableland (link), all of which was once forested (link). The discovery of these artifacts is evidence of regular, though perhaps seasonal, utilization of the region by indigenous people. Squatters running sheep and hundreds of cattle took up large tracts of land in the Ranges from about 1842. The stations included Bailey Hill, Strathbogie, Springs A and Wombat Hill, predominantly in the hill country, while parts of Saintfield and Borodomanin were also in the ranges. John Gall of Wombat Hill was one of the few early settlers to remain in the district. John Kissock of Strathbogie Station arrived in the 1847, while William Forlonge later owned Strathbogie totalling , and many of the other pastoral stations, between the early 1850s and 1867.Strathbogie Tableland, community web portal, 'History' In 1891 a butter factory was built at Strathbogie South (as Strathbogie was then known and a second factory was built in 1892 at Strathbogie North.Victoria Places, Stratbogie Butter Factory A Post Office opened in Strathbogie on 10 July 1878. There are several districts located within the Strathbogie Ranges including Strathbogie, Ruffy, and Highlands, but no towns and few major roads; Strathbogie township has a general store and Ruffy township has 'The Pantry'. Bushfires Due to the climate of the region, the type of vegetation and the topography, the Strathbogie Ranges likely experienced periodic bushfires prior to European settlement. Several bushfires of restricted extent have burnt parts of the ranges in recent years (Strathbogie 1990, Longwood East- Creighton's Creek 2014). The major bushfires of 1851, 1939, 1983, 2003, 2006 and 2009 did not reach the Strathbogie Ranges (link).

It is one of the most important Dutch Colonial era buildings in Sri Lanka, and is one of the oldest Protestant churches still in use in the country. History Watercolour painting of the Dutch Reformed Church (Wolvendaal), Colombo by J. L. K. van Dort (1888) In 1736 Governor of Ceylon, Gustaaf Willem van Imhoff, sought approval from the Dutch East India Company (Vereenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie or VOC) to demolish the existing church (Kasteel Kerk) within the Colombo Fort and construct a new one on the same site. However, the VOC refused this request, and it wasn't until the arrival of Governor Julius Valentyn Stein van Gollenesse in 1743 that the impasse was overcome. He decided that the new church would be erected in the area beyond the city walls, which at the time was swamp and marshland. The Europeans mistook the packs of roaming jackals for wolves, and the area became known as Wolvendaal (Wolf's Dale or Wolf's Valley). The site that was selected was on a hill which commanded views across the town and over the harbour and was in proximity to the town's entrance. The site was also occupied by a small church, which had existed from the earliest period of Dutch occupation, when the Wolvendaal neighbourhood was a quiet suburban parish. The foundations of the church were laid in 1749 and it took eight years to build. It was completed on 6 March 1757, when it was dedicated for public worship by Rev. Matthias Wirmelskircher, Rector of the Colombo Seminary. At the dedication there were two Governors present, Joan Gideon Loten and his successor Jan Schreuder, together with Members of the Council, Reverend Ministers (Predikants), prominent Burghers and their families. Architecture The church was constructed in the Doric style of the period, in the form of a Greek cross (i.e. legs of equal length), with walls nearly 1.5m (five feet) thick, constructed of unusually large kabok (clay ironstone) with coral and lime plaster. The high roof in the middle of the building resembles a dome and was originally arched with brick and roofed in blue Bangor slate roof tiles surmounted with a brazen lion. This lion had a crown on its head, bearing a sword in one hand and seven arrows in the other, representing the seven united provinces of the Dutch Republic. In 1856, a bolt of lightning destroyed the lion and seriously damaged the dome. The roof was later replaced with an iron covering. The church is capable of seating 1,000 persons.Tombstones of reverend Henricus Philipszoon and his wife Susanna ScharffInside the church there is a solidly constructed State Pew (to accommodate the Dutch governor) with numerous ebony and calamander church chairs (kerkstoels), dating back to the 17th and 18th centuries. The baptismal font, on an ornately carved tripod stand, dates back to 1667. The pulpit is typical for a Dutch Reformed Church, where the minister stands higher than the congregation on a richly ornamented wooden structure. On the walls of the Church are many mural tablets while there are many more built into the external walls. The floor is paved with granite flagstones (purportedly brought from Holland) interdispersed with engraved tombstones, of those who lie buried within the church or whose remains were relocated from the Kasteel Kerk. Many famous names of 300 year Sri Lankan history, Dutch, Burgher, Singhalese, Tamil and English, can be found amongst the gravestones within and outside the church. There are five Dutch Governors buried at the church, including the last Governor, Johan Gerard van Angelbeek, who died in Colombo in 1799, three years after the British occupation. From the time of its dedication through to the end of Dutch rule Wolvendaal was the principal place of worship, although Kasteel Kerk remained the main religious seat for the European and local officials of the VOC, until it was demolished in 1813. Current use The typically Dutch design-pulpit in the church. The Dutch Reformed Church is currently known as the Christian Reformed Church of Sri Lanka. The Church has several locations throughout the Colombo area. Wolvendaal Church is the only Dutch Church on the island that has been continually in use, with in 2018 services in Tamil, Sinhalese and English every Sunday. A similar Dutch Reformed Church building is the Groote Kerk in Galle. In January 2005 the Dutch Reformed Church (DRC) established the Wolvendaal Foundation to preserve the church's architecture. Its ultimate aim is to further cordial relations between the various races and religions on the island.

The film stars Harriet MacMasters-Green and Sabrina Jolie Perez. The film was released as part of the Bloody Disgusting Selects line. Plot Sophia is a recently divorced college professor who lives in Italy with her daughter Helena. The two of them are in a car accident on the same day that Helena loses her first tooth, and soon afterwards Helena begins to report strange visions to her mother. Investigating the history of the apartment in which they live, Sophia discovers that during the rule of Mussolini's Fascist party, the man who lived there brutally tortured his wife by removing her teeth and locking her in a closet to die. Helena begins speaking to an invisible apparition in the closet, and later begins buying teeth from other children at school, saying that she needs to give them to the tooth fairy. A teacher from her school investigates this cruel and unusual behaviour, only to be attacked by a swarm of mosquitoes and killed. After ignoring a warning to leave the apartment from the elderly man who lives upstairs, they are attacked by the toothless ghost of the woman who died there. Sophia throws the teeth at her and they escape while she attempts to insert them into her mouth. Eighteen months later, Helena has been institutionalized and is completely nonverbal. Her father has returned to Italy, and believes that Sophia is no longer capable of looking after her. While Helena is alone in her room, bloody teeth begin to rain from the ceiling, only to vanish moments later. The door to the closet in which the woman died begins to appear in other locations, and when Helena's father opens it he is consumed by a swarm of mosquitoes and killed. The doctors at the institution begin to question Sophia's fitness as a parent as her behaviour becomes increasingly erratic, and the pressure on her intensifies when her dead ex-husband's bloody teeth are found in Helena's locker. She begins to have visions of the murderer standing at the window of the abandoned psychiatric wing of the institution, and goes to investigate it. Locating the murderer's file, Sophia is able to piece the evidence together and discover the hiding place of the dead woman's teeth. When the closet door appears to her again she throws them in, believing that it will satisfy the spirit. Helena immediately begins to speak again, and it appears that the haunting has come to an end. When she views a recorded interview with the murderer, however, she discovers that his wife was a serial killer who preyed upon children, eating the flesh from their faces, and he killed her in order to stop her from killing others. It is revealed that the elderly man who tried to warn Sophia witnessed her crimes as a child. Running through the institution, she comes across a patient whose face has been mauled, and he tells her that the ogre has her teeth once more. Reaching Helena's room, she walks in, then slowly backs out. She finally collapses and screams in horror. Some time later, Sophia is a patient at the same institution. She is shown sitting on a bench, looking up at the abandoned psychiatric wing. Helena's ghost is now standing at the window along with the dead woman's husband, trapped in place with half of her face missing. Reception The Haunting of Helena has received primarily negative reviews, most of which have focused on the movie's clich√©d plot line and the poor acting ability of both leads. Chuck Bowen of Slate described the film as being so close to the work of Guillermo del Toro that \\"he could almost reasonably consider filing a plagiarism suit against The Haunting of Helena's producers,\\" while Bill Goodykoontz of The Arizona Republic stated that it \\"chugs along pretty well until the plot holes begin to pile up.\\" Yell! Magazine gave The Haunting of Helena 2.5 stars, stating that it had a few redeeming qualities, especially the final twist, but that overall the film \\"had too many issues to fall in love with it.\\" References External links * Category:2012 horror films Category:2012 films Category:Italian horror films Category:Italian films Category:English-language films Category:Films shot in Rome Category:Italian supernatural horror films Category:Italian films about revenge Category:Ghost films Category:Haunted house films Category:2012 directorial debut films ","title":"The Haunting of Helena"},{"id":"43121837","text":"Sphecomorpha chalybea is a species of beetle in the family Cerambycidae.

Its formations are Gravel Point, Charlevoix Limestone, Petoskey, and Whiskey Creek. The Gravel Point Formation consists of a lithographic gray to brown limestone with shale beds up to 0.5 meters thick; it also includes chert nodules and bioherms (fossilized reef mounds). The Charlevoix Limestone is a mildly argillaceous limestone with interbedded coquina. The Petoskey Formation is an arenaceous limestone named for its locale (Petoskey, Michigan), and contains the eponymous Petoskey stones. The Whiskey Creek Formation is a limestone. The Traverse Group formed as a shallow carbonate shelf during the Devonian period (~419 to 359 Ma), when the most recent supercontinent, Pangea, was just beginning to take shape.

Sequence of events  A-1324 (serial number - 4927, model L-82), was delivered from the 32nd Transport Squadron in June 1982. The military flight was from Jakarta to Bandung, and mainly consisted of Paskhas, (also called Orange Berets), returning to base after participating in an Indonesian Armed Forces Day ceremony. The aircraft had a crew of 12 and 122 airman passengers. The aircraft departed at 15:00 local time when, according to eyewitnesses on the ground, one of the engines caught on fire. The fire presumably damaged the wing mechanism, causing the left engine to fail. The aircraft lost control crashed into the Training Center of the Ministry of Labor, and exploded. Rescue operations were hampered by heavy rain which began an hour after the crash. One of the pilots, Major Samsul Ilham, was found in the wreckage alive but seriously injured. He later died in the hospital the same day. A man survived the crash. Two people on the ground were also killed. With 135 fatalities, the crash was the deadliest aviation disaster to occur in Indonesia until the crash of Garuda Indonesia Flight 152 in 1997. It is now the sixth-deadliest.

Life The son of Michael James Whitty, was born in London, and was educated at the Liverpool Institute and in Hanover. About 1844 he became a reporter on the provincial press, and from 1846 to 1849 he was the writer of the parliamentary summary of The Times. He was also the London correspondent of the Liverpool Journal. For several years Whitty served with George Henry Lewes and E. F. S. Pigott on the staff of The Leader, where his sarcastic style came out in parliamentary sketches. These columns built up with essays, published from 14 August 1852), to the innovative description of the debates by \\"The Stranger in Parliament\\" appearing from 13 November that year. In time, however, Whitty quarrelled with his colleagues on The Leader. Whitty was appointed editor of the Northern Whig early in 1857, but was sacked in the spring of 1858. He returned for a time to London, and on the death of his wife and two children emigrated to Australia to work on the Melbourne Argus. He died at Melbourne, at the house of a relative, on 21 February 1860. A few years later a monument was erected to his memory by Barry Sullivan. Works A selection from Whitty's parliamentary sketches was published anonymously in 1854 as the History of the Session 1852‚Äì3: a Parliamentary Retrospect. A volume entitled The Derbyites and the Coalition (1854?) is assigned to Whitty by Samuel Austin Allibone. A series of Whitty's Leader articles was collected in The Governing Classes of Great Britain: Political Portraits (London, 1854; with additions, 1859). The volume is said to have greatly impressed Montalembert. The phrase \\"the governing classes\\" is earlier found in Thomas Carlyle (Cromwell's Letters and Speeches, 1845, ii. 150), but became identified with Whitty's volume; Robert Barnabas Brough dedicated to him in 1855 his Songs of the Governing Classes. Whitty dashed off a novel Friends of Bohemia, or Phases of London Life (London, 1857, 2 vols.; New York and Philadelphia, 1864, with memoir). It contained satire and epigrams directed at former colleagues on The Leader.

He had also contested from Dang-4 in the CA Election 2013 representing CPN-UML. Early life Shankar Pokhrel was born in 1964 in Bijauri, Dang. He is the youngest son of Keshav Raj Sharma and Trilotama Upadhaya. Twitter controversy On September 6, 2016, Pokhrel received widespread criticism from Nepalese social media users for mocking Madheshis, based on their skin color in a controversial tweet. Madheshis hail from the southern part of Nepal and form about a third of the population of Nepal. For over a year now, they have been protesting against the controversial new constitution promulgated by Communist Party of Nepal (UML), the political party to which Pokhrel belongs. Later on September 6, owing to some major criticism, Pokhrel removed the tweet and in an interview by a local newspaper claimed that people \\"deliberately misinterpreted\\" his tweet. Pokhrel clarified that he had protested the tradition of using black as a sign of protest, which he said was related to racist European mindset, and tried to justify that he was not against people of dark complexion.

She was born as Tamar Javakhishvili () in Tbilisi, the daughter of the baritone Avtandil Javakishvili who was also her teacher. Career Iveri made her operatic debut in 1998 as Desdemona in Verdi's Otello. In 1999 she won first prize at the Mozart Competition in Salzburg. For several years at the beginning of the 2000s she was a member of the ensemble of Graz Opera where her roles included Elisabetta in Verdi's Don Carlo, the title roles in Francesco Cilea's Adriana Lecouvreur and Giacomo Puccini's Suor Angelica, Amelia in Verdi's Simon Boccanegra, and Desdemona. She made her debut at La Scala in Milan in December 2011 as Donna Anna in Don Giovanni under Daniel Barenboim. She has since performed with the Vienna State Opera, the Metropolitan Opera, the Royal Opera House Covent Garden, Op√©ra Bastille, and at the Salzburg Festival. She has sung the roles of Fiordiligi in Cos√¨ fan tutte, Vitellia in La clemenza di Tito, Elettra in Idomeneo, Mim√¨ in La boh√®me, and Tatyana in Eugene Onegin. Controversy Iveri has been the centre of controversy over statements she allegedly made concerning the 2013 Tbilisi anti-homophobia rally protests, in which a small gay rights rally in Tbilisi was attacked by thousands of anti- gay protesters, led by priests, causing over 20 injuries. Following this incident, Iveri allegedly posted on her Facebook page a letter to Georgian President Giorgi Margvelashvili which said (in Georgian): \\"I was quite proud of the fact how Georgian society spat at the parade... Often, in certain cases, it is necessary to break jaws in order to be appreciated as a nation in the future, and to be taken into account seriously. Please, stop vigorous attempts to bring West's 'fecal masses' in the mentality of the people by means of propaganda.\\" Following the appearance of this letter, the Georgian gay rights organisation Identoba wrote to the Paris Opera demanding that Iveri's upcoming concert be cancelled. Their letter said: \\"We would like to bring your attention to homophobic and hate inspiring activity by one of your opera singers, Ms Tamar Iveri, resulting in death threats and physical injuries to many Georgians.\\" Iveri then apologised, but did not at that time deny authorship of the letter. In June 2014, controversy broke out again while Iveri was in Sydney rehearsing Otello with Opera Australia. She then denied having written the letter, blaming her husband. After several days of intense criticism, Opera Australia announced on 23 June that it had \\"released\\" Iveri from her contract. Also the Th√©√¢tre Royal de la Monnaie in Brussels dropped her from its production of Un ballo in maschera in 2015.

It is the youngest unit of the Upper Mississippian-age Mauch Chunk Group. A pronounced unconformity separates the upper boundary of the Bluestone Formation from sandstones of the overlying Pennsylvanian-age Pocahontas Formation. Two formally named subunits of the Bluestone Formation, the Bramwell and Pride Shale Members, are quite fossiliferous. Plant fossils allow the top of the Bluestone Formation to be correlated with the Namurian A-Namurian B boundary, the European equivalent of the Mississippian-Pennsylvanian boundary. Conodonts belonging to the Adetognathus unicornis or lower Rhachistognathus muricatus conodont zones have been found in the Bramwell Member. This would make the Bluestone Formation the youngest occurrence of Mississippian-type conodonts in eastern North America. A diverse bivalve fauna was present in both the Bluestone Formation and the older Hinton Formation. Brachiopods were also fairly diverse, though not as dominant in the ecosystem as bivalves. Among the most abundant fossils were fossilized tubes of Microconchus hintonensis, a microconchid. The Pride Shale Member has produced Tanypterichthys pridensis, an endemic species of deep-bodied palaeonisciform fish. The Pride Shale Member of the Bluestone Formation preserves interbedded variations in sediment coarseness. This variation is cyclical at multiple scales, with cycles from smaller than a milimeter to up to several meters in thickness. The smallest- scale cycles likely represent sediments settling out during daily tides. The largest-scale cycles are tied to changes in the tides influenced by the 18.6-year lunar nodal cycle. Cycles are also observed at half-year, monthly, and half-month scales. These correspond to seasonal changes, perigee/apogee tidal variation, and neap/spring tidal variation, respectively. Together, the different cycles reconstruct a deltaic environment near the equator which was heavily influenced by tides and a monsoonal climate. Modern equivalents would be the deltas of the Amazon, Ganges/Brahmaputra, and Fly rivers. During glacial periods, the monsoonal climate would have mellowed out into a less seasonal tropical climate in equatorial regions.

It preserves fossils dating back to the Mississippian subperiod of the Carboniferous period. Sediments of this age formed along a large marine basin lying in the region of what is now the Appalachian Plateau. The Bluefield Formation is the lowest section of the primarily siliciclastic Mauch Chunk Group, underlying the Stony Gap Sandstone Member of the Hinton Formation and overlying the limestone-rich Greenbrier Group.  History  As with many other units in southeast West Virginia, the Bluefield Formation was first named by Campbell (1896). At the time it was called the \\"Bluefield Shale\\". Reger & Price (1926) later renamed it to the Bluefield Group and supplied an extensive list of subunits. Subsequent publications further altered the name to Bluefield Formation while also naming the encompassing Mississippian sequence as the Mauch Chunk Group. As originally designated, the Bluefield Formation pertained to an area in southeast West Virginia encompassed by Mercer, Monroe, and Summers counties, as well as a few exposures in Virginia adjacent to those counties. Further north in West Virginia, Mauch Chunk strata becomes thinner. Some geologists refrain from subdividing the Mauch Chunk Group north of Randolph County, and rename it to the Mauch Chunk Formation in northern exposures. However, others retain separate formations in the northern exposures, including the Bluefield Formation. Since the Mauch Chunk Group extends into parts of Maryland and Pennsylvania, the Bluefield Formation (or equivalent strata) may be identified in those areas as well. Equivalent strata is also found in southwest Virginia and southeast Kentucky as the upper part of the Newman Limestone.  Geology  = Sequences and cycles = The Bluefield Formation can be subdivided into four lithological units or \\"packages\\" at its thickest extent. The oldest two packages are primarily grey shale and fossiliferous limestone, while the younger two packages are primarily siltstone, sandstone, and red mudstone. Four distinct types of sediment deposition and flooding cycles are preserved, labelled types A-D. Type A and B cycles are most common in the younger packages and type C and D cycles are most common in the older packages. These cycles and sequences of the Bluefield Formation are most well preserved at the depocenter of the Bluefield Formation, at the eastern edge of Mercer County, West Virginia. Here, at least 28 cycles have been tracked. Elsewhere they may be incomplete due to erosion within the basin as it was experiencing deposition. Type A cycles involve fine black shale grading upwards to brown laminated mudstone, then thickly-bedded red mudstone and mudcracked siltstone layers, before a flood event returns the area to carbonate-rich mudstone. Ostracods, root casts, and intense bioturbation were common in many layers. Coal fragments are found in the basal black shale layers. Carbonate nodules and slickensides were present in red mudstone, indicating that they were vertisols. Type A cycles represent brackish lagoons which were able to dry out into mudflats in a hot, semi-arid climate. The mudflats accumulated soil, as well as streams that formed silty crevasse splay deposits. Type B cycles were similar to type A cycles but were thicker and differed in other ways. The basal black shale is richer in coal and grades into siltier brown mudstone and then interbedded layers of siltstone, sandstone, and silty mudstone. The top of a cycle is characterized by a thick layer of rippling cross-bedded sandstone filled with rootcasts. Type B cycles represent a delta influenced by tides which alternate the supply of fine and coarse sediments. However, bioturbation makes it difficult to precisely track tidal forces. The top of a cycle preserves a sandbar in the process of being colonized by plants. Once seawater re- submerges the area and starts a new cycle, plants contribute to the richness of coal within the basal shale. Type C cycles begin with bioturbated mudstone which abruptly transitions into a thick sequence of limestone. The limestone can be characterized as thin layers of fossil-rich grainstone interbedding with broader layers of packstone. Rarely, brown laminated mudstone may be present above the limestone. The upper part of the cycle involves conglomerate covered by sandstone and siltstone filled with plant fragments, ripple marks, and occasionally tetrapod footprints. In type C cycles, a transgression floods a mudflat and allows it to be colonized by marine organisms. Repeated storm event lead to alternating limestone grain size, and eventually tidally- influenced sandbars manifest as the shoreline shifts back. Type D cycles primarily involve a thick sequence of laminated mudstone grading from shale to siltstone. The sequence is occasionally interrupted by fossil-rich packstone which grades upwards into mudstone. The thickest packstone layer is often located at the top of the sequence, though dolomite-rich mudstone may lie in its place. Type D cycles are entirely marine deposits found on the continental shelf of the ancient marine basin. Though this is a mostly stable environment, it is regularly disrupted by storms (forming siltstone) and turbidity flows (forming packstone). The gradual increase in sediment size is tied to a regressing coastline, allowing shallow-water sediments to influence the environment more. Collectively, the cycles and \\"packages\\" of the Bluefield Formation represent a series of large-scale sea level changes, each lasting several hundred thousand years. This data is consistent with identifying each package as a fourth-order sequence. This likely means that they are tied to glacial periods as the earth was transitioning from a greenhouse to icehouse climate. The individual sediment cycles represent smaller-scale (50-100 thousand year) glacial sea level fluctuations, also known fifth-order sequences or parasequences. The upper two packages of the Bluefield Formation have more parasequences and more coal near the depocenter, but areas further away (towards the basin margin) had fewer parasequences and less coal. This indicates that the basin margins had less subsidence compared to the depocenter. The relatively larger impact of sea level changes leads to more erosion along the basin margin, allowing many parasequences and coal beds to be eroded away completely.  Paleobiota  Greererpeton, a colosteid from strata in Greer, West Virginia equivalent to the Bickett Shale member of the Bluefield Formation Bluefieldius, a fish found in delta sediments near the depocenter of the Bluefield Formation in Mercer County, West Virginia Fossils are common in limestone and shale layers of the Bluefield Formation. In the region of southeast West Virginia (and neighboring parts of Virginia) for which the Bluefield Formation was named, invertebrates are by far the most common fossils. These include a diverse assortment of bryozoans, brachiopods, bivalves, gastropods, corals, trilobites, ostracods, crinoids, and blastoids. Only one site in southeast West Virginia has produced vertebrate material. This site is a highway roadcut located across the state line from Glen Lyn, Virginia. It preserves a tidal deltaic sequence near the middle of the Bluefield Formation. Tetrapod trackways from this site have been given the species name Hylopus hamesi, and were likely made by Proterogyrinus or a closely related animal. The site has also produced a single complete skeleton of a basal actinopterygiian fish, the holotype of Bluefieldius mercerensis. The tentatively assigned northern exposures of the Bluefield Formation are also fossiliferous, preserving the same types of invertebrates as the southern exposures. Bivalves are particularly well-studied in the northern exposures. Among the most famous northern Mauch Chunk site is the Greer limestone quarry in Monongalia County, West Virginia. Exposures at this site have been equated with sediment units from the lower half of the Bluefield Formation, from the Lillydale Shale up to the Droop Sandstone. Apart from numerous invertebrates, a prominent vertebrate fauna is also known from the Bickett Shale of the Bluefield Formation at Greer. Preserved vertebrate fossils include acanthodians, lungfish, rhizodonts, and articulated tetrapod remains. Several new tetrapod genera have been named from Greer: Greererpeton (a colosteid), Proterogyrinus (a basal embolomere), and Mauchchunkia (a synonym of Proterogyrinus).
